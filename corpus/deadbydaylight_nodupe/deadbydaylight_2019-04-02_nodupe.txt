New DS isn't really in the spirit of Halloween, but it was way too broken to just stay the way it was.

April 2nd bro

Wouldn't Lee be better since he was about to turn and having him wake up in the entiy's realm would be better lore wise
---
That means that the survivors either don‚Äôt do gens and lose or do gens and likely still lose. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd call that a decent idea... 
---
With trapper it really depends. Sometimes you put 3 traps in the basement and everybody rush hooks and stepping into it
---
It was awesome. Now they're going to ruin it.
---
1: I meant find with the killers power 
---

---
2: if you play stealthy then it‚Äôs not an issue because then you avoid chases and those speed buffs negate because this is a killer where you have to play stealthy 
---
I‚Äôm on console and have been thinking about switching to pc. If you don‚Äôt mind me asking how good of computer do you need to run dbd and games in general decently?

This perk was a game changer for my grinding. And the actual ability it offers is super useful too. 
---
Did I miss something? Those "Legion" jokes?
---
To be fair, those Dwights are the shaved head variant (Dwearder) and not the full bald Dwight (Dweard). 
---
Dweard players are usually very good. 
---
This would be interesting to say the least.
---
Not to mention as survivor, if you want to farm BP, you‚Äôd be stuck with No Mither. üòÇ
---
April 2nd tjo
---
I think servers may be down
---
Hey, Vsauce, Dwight here. Killers are scary, and spooky. But do you know what else is? A whole team of bald Dwights with Diversion. 
---
you flair sound desperate, child... wanna go on a date? 
---
No wonder he eats up male survivors
---
He has such a nice belly myers can only be jelous of that belly
---
[Here's the artist's Twitter](https://twitter.com/Labell_xx)
---
Thought it would be AF, time to get me some DLC.
---
And used to have 3 blinks by default.
---
I love indoors maps way more than cornfields as a Survivor and Killer
---
I'm on PC, it's the only way I was able to even get this screenshot. I don't know why this is the way it is, but I guess it's a PC-only change?
---
Woo
---
AAaAAAAAAaaAAaaaaAaaaahaAhH STOP IT!
---
Just had one of my most infuriating games ever.
---
The map is Badham Preschool.
---
I‚Äôm the killer‚Äôs Rancor (no one had obsession perks ofc).
---
I rush the last gen even though the killer (Huntress) is approaching because all my teammates are on last hook so I‚Äôd rather sacrifice myself than get the whole team slaughtered.
---
Somehow she misses a swing so I can get a little bit of distance.
---
At this point there‚Äôs no pallets left on the map so I go to the school loop since slow killers struggle with it A LOT.
---
When I get there I notice the exit gate is there so I think:‚Äùoh, I can just loop her a bit until someone opens the door and then run straight to it since she‚Äôs too slow to catch me, I can actually make it!‚Äù
---
WRONG!
---
I looped that bloody window SIX TIMES and nobody fucking opened the damn door.
---
ALL THREE OF MY TEAMMATES, I repeat,  *ALL THREE OF THEM* decided to open the other door and sit there waiting for the entire time I was running for my life.
---
I NEVER had that happen to me.
---
Usually at the endgame everyone either opens both doors or goes around cleansing totems for some extra points.
---
The likelihood that 3 braindead idiots simultaneously decided to do the exact opposite of what common sense dictates right when the guy that saved their worthless asses needed just a tiny bit of collaboration is so miniscule that I‚Äôm still mindblown.
---
I should have let those idiots die, they deserved it.
---
It‚Äôs shit like this that makes me never want to play altruistic or just playing online games in general.
---
Looks amazing!
---
My friend and I take turns every time we are out to that. Sucks but getter than both being killed 
---
... I would love to see that.
---
The survivors trying to find each other on thw real world, thinking that wvery shadow was a killer. Sprinting every time they heard a bird or a loud noise...
---
Those kids were trend hoppers that rode it initial wave of popularity and they‚Äôve since left it so it‚Äôs now just genuinely chill community 
---
People enjoy cock and ball torture too 
---
When is babby due?
---
Is this a JoJo‚Äôs reference?
---
Thank you! ^.^
---
If you choose to play legion your a twat. You know full well everybody will have no fun playing against you and you do it anyways. Legion is just 4 man swf with flashlights and ds, but for killers.
---
Lawd please
---
That wouldn't be good for legion, though. You wouldn't be as inclined to use your FF because you can just one-shot them.
---
Even on first hook I‚Äôll say to my friends to get the hatch if they know where it is. Especially if they are new and don‚Äôt really understand how to judge safe (ish) unhooks. If I don‚Äôt say take the hatch we both die coz they rush the hook and get pulled off coz the killer saw them a mile away. That‚Äôs only with newer friends that play the game. When it‚Äôs me and other rank 5-1 Friends we always try to save off the hook so whoever survives the longest gets it.
---
Dwight X Dwight fanart is now needed tbh.
---
One time I went against a squad of Claudettes,idk how I killed them all 
---
Thank you! ^.^ I'm probably gonna try another DbD character (maybe a killer :D) first then after I think Hermione sounds like a fun idea! 
---
In b4 he has pill bottle add on and u die from OD
---
Omg the perks would be hilarious, like Scary Movie Brenda good
---
Hopefully they will fix this soon,  the wait times are unbearable, especially if you play late night or the early morning hours.
---
‚ÄúWhere have you been hooked!?‚Äù
---
*mori is heard in the basement*
---
As a doctor main I have to say I prefer the (green) high stimulus electrode. By the time you get a survivor into Moldy Electrode shock range, you're close enough to just hit them instead. Trying to shock with ME just seems to prolong chases so I zap them with HSE at loops/jungle gyms, I don't mind a longer charge time if it guarantees a shock
---
I don‚Äôt recommend it as a new player. It teaches bad habits and is suboptimal for Bloodpoints game. I main LF and wouldn‚Äôt listen to these people tbh, basement LF is a meme and traps killers into a shitty play style and prevents them from actually learning LF.
---
Fair point
---
It just seems like a wasted slot on killers with an insta-down already inbuilt in their power.
---
Bad killers will say anything to defend using NOED.Adrenaline like many other perks is awesome if it activates at the perfect time.Just like haunted grounds and make your choice.In theory it can work very well but there's a chance you won't even use it for numerous games.
---
I almost thought they would come out with some actual news for the sake of transparency. Looks like I really am the fool today LUL
---
People have always complained about adrenaline, though. 
---
Or everyone takes an ebony mori and kills each other
---
God I love it, it‚Äôs perfect. Should post it on r/DBDgonegay
---
It applies to ff as well 
---
Oh god lmao 
---
I don't care. Decisive Lagswitch is finally gone and nothing else really matters, lol. 
---
I believe this one
---
It's such BS! Killers and survivors shouldn't be punished if the other rage quits.
---
[removed]
---
Except that makes absolutely no sense in-game, lore wise and would mean tens of hours hours of work. It's not like "copy/paste killer skin graphics into survivor folder."
---
Devs messed this up? Or maybe some of y'all can't just be happy to get a cool surprise midway between new chapters.
---
You‚Äôre free to crosspost if you want :P I‚Äôm just happy people are enjoying it lol
---
It‚Äôs funny cuz they‚Äôd actually do this too
---
Na it's cool that they did this either way. Ash just has a lot of potential as a killer. 
---
All we had to do, was follow the damn train CJ!!!
---
Is there really an issue with slugging? If I'm crawling on the ground, I'm either healing and waiting for the pickup or frantically trying to find the hatch, either way it's never worse than just being hooked and eliminated, unless all four players are downed, in which case that team had bigger problems to begin with. 
---
Literally won't accept anything but Brenda 
---
Finish the damn gen, CJ.
---
That earrape. Downvote
---
Yeah it‚Äôs disgusting how long it takes..
---
chucky is too small to be a killer, would be hell to see him and would be hella funny to be carryed to a hook by a 30 cm doll
---
Claudette sneakily moving through the bushes towards you from twenty feet away when you can clearly see the aura of the injured survivor being chased across the map...god its awful
---
I like em‚Äô *round*,with ‚Äúsomething‚Äù *something*
---
i think it should be his default range
---
Literally today a guy was named "Farming4Ash", I switched David and popped a streamer and he and someone else did too, just out of kindness. 20 seconds into the loading screen, everyone gets DC'ed.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Every fucking time.
---
Why do people hate me
---
ALL YOU HAD TO DO WAS FOLLOW THE GODDAMN TRAIN CJ! 
---
You joke but my friend gets jumpscared by other survivors all the time. 
---
I'm gay, but I have standards. I would run the other way, screaming. Doesn't help that I hate clowns and he's at least several decades older than I am, and guys more than a few years older than me are a major turnoff to me.
---
Ahaha yeah that's exactly what happened. I was so sad, we were so close haha
---
i highly doubt any sort of m1‚Äôs are not going to work. it‚Äôs probably a bug from wherever you heard it. i mean, those hits activate franklins so i don‚Äôt see why they wouldn‚Äôt trigger tokens.
---
More like
---
Bing Bong boi: *bing bongs next to Claud*
---
Claudette: I'M GOING GHOST
---
Incorrect , the only time people got this excited was when Michael was released.
---
Without using The Beast add-on, Borrowed Time will not activate if you uncloak after someone gets unhooked, Wraith probably got bugged with the Plague update, which sucks considering we're probably going to have to wait until mid-chapter patch until it gets fixed.
---
Same problem yesterday. I threw down the Ormond offering cause I kept getting Wrecker‚Äôs map. When someone went down, I tried to look where they did go down but it was so hard to see them. Even when they got hooked, it was still too hard to see them.
---
My favourite is still The Last Breath, not only because it was quite fun, but that it really helped to save the game.
---
I would love this, The Last of Us is in my top 3 favourite games of all time so I would be ecstatic. 
---
"LOOK HERE, LOOK LISTEN"
---
Does he come out tomorrow?
---
Big smoke should be a new killer and CJ would be the surv
---
Yes officer, this is the one right here. 
---
The Perk says if you are in the Killers Terror Radius.
---
Wraith has no TR while cloaked (no Addons). So it should work.
---
I don't understand the purpose of having the same image of hag twice and saying it is the same picture. Yeah, pretty obvious.
---
Man even shitposting is getting shitter by the day.
---
I‚Äôm ruining your fun, but stop yelling at me it‚Äôs not my fault I‚Äôm playing a broken killer! 
---
Oh wait...
---
Hey dude, I‚Äôm not the one who wrote his backstory lol. Blame BHVR for that one.
---
It never says he did technically
---
Bloody valentine is a classic OP!
---
apparently, yes, there's been a few of these since they banned ds. it's also a trend to shit on self care, so adrenaline became the new victim
---
I would agree with this mentality in some other games, but unfortunately not for DBD.
---
Personally I still think it's because there's no exact standard/definition as to what tunneling means, worse, the word keep on losing its meaning when it simply used as an insult.
---
For example, if Startcraft players talk about cannon/bunker rush, it has a clean definition (build cannon/bunker right by the opponent's base as soon as possible to destroy it) and is wildly consider a "cheese" move. Completely fair when anyone watched the game to call it out. Opens up to each individual to discuss if doing it is unsportsmanship or not... This is just not the case when DBD players discuss what tunneling is.
---
In the end, while I am glad this kind of post still exists, I can't help but see this as a grim reminder of how chaotic the current state of the game is.
---
Ha ha very original and funny
---
I know, but still. Ugh.
---
And then you full heal with no skillchecks because this game fucking hates me 
---
So, hitting is like the doctor's new power?

---
Lmao sadly not even close to 20 though we were all purple ranks in that lobby 
---
Honestly though? This too. No matter who leaves the game, it fucks over everyone. The LOL model would definitely be great here. Or at least go back to survivors still getting bloodpoints when the killer disconnects. Maybe even increase the bloodpoint bonus for a disconnect.
---
I mean mettle of man is only nasty if you let the person recover to full then pick up lmao I feel it‚Äôs strong but situational, it‚Äôs a good perk for meme builds.
---
Sorry for super long post. I did it fairly quickly so I also apologize for spelling/grammar errors.
---
People can hack their ranks within 2 minutes, so they would have to fix that if they thought about any ranked related rewards.
---
You're welcome. &lt;3
---
He looks sleepy too.
---
Haha , wonder who acts as the mayor, the chosen one? Sorry, used to watch this show for 4 seasons
---
I honestly can't see people waiting three minutes to start a game, just to leave immediately and do it over and over again to avoid releasing this for that reason would be way overly cautious
---
It‚Äôs gonna be a joke. And even if it was real people will just emote 
---
People shouldn‚Äôt dc as it hurts the team and killer for points, but there‚Äôs a million post why this killer is bullshit, nice play though lol
---
Why?
---
That legion was a purple rank? So why are people complaining about the new rank system lmfao
---
Yeah but the thing is, now more often than not when they all load in its not even a swf squad. I think killers don't want to try as hard because they're afraid its gonna be a toxic SWF thats gonna just troll hard the whole game and disconnect. But I'm gonna be honest, more often than not I see survivors troll and be toxic to other survivors.
---
That would be sick, it‚Äôs November this year that 2 gets released right? It could line up with a December killer if they keep the 3 month thing going. 
---
Every time without fail
---
Gimme gimme
---
There is a strange, dark part of me that would consider playing dressed as him for the fill emersive experience.
---
It's still pretty good for me, all the matchmaking changes have been improvements to my queues.
---
So strong, so brave.
---
Man, that'd be legit. They can make a Telltale like game of the survivors post-Entity back in the real world.
---
Yup. That‚Äôs the way to do it... until the killer tunnels you and lets the other one go because they‚Äôre trash
---
Even if you could see the post what was it supposed to even be a picture of? 
---
Idk? I assumed they were trying legion for the first time maybe. Also you can see a bit of lag maybe that was giving them problems trying to hit me. You can‚Äôt really judge an entire ranking system from a 20 second clip of them having a hard time though o: I‚Äôm sure a lot of people have those moments
---
a meg doing a gen... should I just delete the post?
---
It's probably the best range increase addon, but quick charge time is so vital to me that I still don't like using it that much.
---
I stopped running STBFL when I realized I was always running into the obsession so there wasn‚Äôt a point. 
---
Now that DS doesn‚Äôt automatically make someone the obsession, I may throw it on again 
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt run doc as much now that I realize how unfun he is to play against
---
Idk man, even when he wasn‚Äôt using his power you could clearly see he was playing like a new player. 
---
Nah dude it's just you, pretty sure this sub isn't complaining about it 24/7.

I actually like the indoor map. As someone maining survivor, it has lots of loops because of window positioning. Also considering that the library area (the one w/ the window-counter loop) is a great area to waste the killer's time. As a killer, most favorable to the Trapper, it has lots of dark loop areas that can be used to his advantage. Not to mention, Scratch Mirror Myers is notoriously good in this area
---
Your power isn‚Äôt really to make loops unsafe, it‚Äôs to make *some* loops unsafe. The problem is some maps have so many pallets that there‚Äôs no way you‚Äôll be able to lock down every good loop. That‚Äôs what the 115% speed is for
---
I don't have a definitive answer, but I can say I have experienced what you're saying, it seems that BT and the wraith's TR are fucky. I've waited for what seems like an eternity to uncloak, specifically to avoid BT going off, yet the person still has BT.
---
Hmmm. 
---
Well I do need to see her perkset first. XD
---
[...Bobandy?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uch7T6arVbs)
---
does it even make much of a difference? last game i played ruin lasted all game (as most games tbh).  
---
it was on top of the ironworks of misery. hidden in a corner where you had no chance of seeing it unless you came in from the outer staircase.
---
it's not that they just spawn in extremely inconvenient parts of the map, they're also very well hidden.
---
Stop camping
---
I've literally loaded into a game just to have them quit immediately. Or get 1 gen popped on them or lose ruin and immediately quit 1 minute in
---
That sounds... not good. 
---
Pick leatherface ez face camp
---
I believe thats when it gets released, and I would love for that to be the December survivor. I know my friend loves the idea of a blind killer that works off of echo-location, which could implement a clicker technically. Even without that though, I would love for Ellie or Joel to be added this December. 
---
That happened to me today. The killer was right behind the guy that unhooked (he had borrowed time t3) and not even 3 seconds the killer downs me. 
---
It's actually worse now with new DS. Nothing worse than someone becoming the obession as soon as you pick them up and then suddenly having your obession on death hook.
---
Also DS will still create an obession. It's bugged right now so it'll actually be assigned to someone who *isn't* the obession.
---
O O F
---
Someone‚Äôs fun at parties. 
---
Sadly it wouldn‚Äôt be Joel probably as Ellie seems to be the main character for 2. 
---
To add a little more information:
---
Distressing is fun on certain killers with certain builds. It‚Äôs considered trash because outside of that it‚Äôs niche
---
STBFL gives you a stack whenever you hit a survivor and removes 2 if you hit the obsession. Each stack reduces attack cooldown by 5%, up to 40% cooldown reduction. It‚Äôs not great because not a ton of killers can capitalize on it and the obsession hurts it, but it‚Äôs definitely not inherently bad
---
Next survivor's buff
---
Nah dog im good...
---
True although I still have fun with some of them, I really don‚Äôt mind what killer I get as long as they don‚Äôt play like an absolute asshole. Which since the update is 90% of the games I get into sadly... facecamping dickholes. 
---
I really feel like Chucky doesn‚Äôt fit the aesthetic and overall feel of Dead by Daylight at all. Dead by Daylight has a dark and creepy feel to it. A colorful, talk-a lot, jokester killer like Chucky doesn‚Äôt fit in. And there‚Äôs no need for Pennywise considering that there‚Äôs already a Clown killer.   
---
Probably lol all we see is you standing taking a pic with your phone and some guy in a bed. 
---
Down she goes!
---
Oh man, I played against them last night. They must've been a 4-stack. They did the same stuff to me after the match, and were very upset that they weren't terribly good at the game. They also got a bunch of their friends to slam my Steam profile, to the point where I had to pull the comments private for a while.
---
Why not just make a new add on that does that? Maybe make it one rarity lower 
---
My friends and I save each other to a fault. We go for the save and then we all end up dying lol but if they find hatch, I‚Äôll take the L in hopes that they can get out. 
---
Care to elaborate? I‚Äôm getting pretty bored of Ruin, Bbq, Nc and Whispers for a build eh...
---
"Whatcha lookin' at my gut fer?" 
---
I REQUIRE THE PLEASURE OF INGESTING THIS SUPERFICIAL FOOD, BUT HOW CAN I PROCEED TO SUCH ACHIEVEMENT?
---
I ha e a theory that Joel will die at the beginning of the Last of Us 2, which means it would definetly be Ellie. I'm not going to go into crazy detail with my theory, but essentially since Joel only showed up in the first trailer which takes place before Lasr of Us 2, I believe hell die. Which is devastating, but best to prepare myself for the trauma now 
---
Or maybe The Scream game they announced awhile ago?
---
YASSS daddy work it! üî™
---
The reason for the remake is licensing issues. The publishers of the original movie gave the rights of the story to universal, who then made the sequels.
---
Now the original publishers want to make more Chucky movies. However because of some weirdness about the specific license, the original publishers have the rights to Chucky movies, but they can't be related to the original film's story. So their solution is to do a remake.
---
Small penis gang
---
Why...am I...turned on? Send help. 
---
She can‚Äôt run anymore though 
---
Amazing 
---
It is really bad on console. Makes it really hard to stream the game as well since the majority of the time you are just waiting to find a match. 
---
I saw a decent theory that we could play as a human possessed by Chucky, as that's something he's known to do. The doll itself could then be utilized in his power somehow. I'd expect that to be sort of disappointing, but bhvr usually does very well with licensed powers.
---
I could see why you say that, yeah. Especially since I was in panic mode running into walls n shit and they still had a hard time slapping me lol but he had to have gotten to the purples somehow which brought up the ‚Äúmaybe they were trying legion for the first time‚Äù though üßê guess we‚Äôll never know how they got to purple.
---
If you're running 1080p and shooting for medium/high settings, you could build one for under a grand, maybe $600-700 if you were super budget conscious. Anything over that starts getting expensive quickly though.
---
Oh god I hate that one so much 
---
It just makes the addon a lot weaker. 
---
Yea I don't know why no one is talking about that :D I found no post about this problem. Where are the Wraith Mains?! :(
---
Same. But it's just a theory. A GAME theory 
---
The shape checks out 
---
This sub needs more of the Boys
---
Since It shape shifts they could implement entity arms. Book two in one, spider killer and It
---
It would just make the game more toxic as everyone tries to secure pips in any dirty way possible.
---
I'm glad I can just ignore rank right now. I don't have to feel like I'm not playing the game right by playing it my way.
---
what have you brought into this world
---
üòÇ
---
Tru but detective tapp is dead and they got him back
---
Potatos...
---
I feel attacked 
---
Honestly after both playing with her for a a while, Rank 50'd her from level 1 using only her. Her puke hitbox is completely fucked in her favor. I've hit survivors multiple times with one puke, I've hit survivors dead harding away when I honestly should fucking not [have.](https://have.It) it needs a total revamp. Like, it's less a projectile line I feel more just a flat cone of fuck you.
---
More so they implied he didn‚Äôt die he was taken by the entity and healed before he died. It can heal people not restore limbs 
---
i would legitimately use this skin all of the time
---
His mori would just be him voring the survivor, lol

Legion's consistent but a little boring. The biggest issue with them is that people dc the instant they see a deep wound. I'm not kidding, most of your games will have atleast one dc if you play them. Their teachables also aren't too good except for Discordance, though iron maiden does work with huntress reloading.
---
So survivors bad? Killers good?/s
---
I mean running DS before wasn‚Äôt that hard to play against, and now it‚Äôs laughable, comparable to all survivor perks that BHVR nerfs
---
Explain
---
If we‚Äôre talking full-on Chapters, then an Alien Chapter with the Xenomorph and Ellen Ripley. If we‚Äôre talking DLC more generally, then a Hellraiser Paragraph with Pinhead.
---
Isn't it called Blackened Catalyst?
---
I wanna create her perks.
---
Duh. Why else would OP say that.
---
Shit how could I forget Candyman
---
I play on xbox (killer) and if anything I take longer to find a lobby that I host but after I find and create the lobby the survivors don‚Äôt take all that long to join. Maybe a min or two. I have heard finding matches would take long on PS4 in the past, so the changes might‚Äôve added on to the long wait time that was already there. Might be a PS thing or a survivor thing I think? 
---
I'm a survivor main and dont hate either, though I prefer the outdoor maps 
---
Hey, you just made a thread about that, let this guy have his thread.
---
A resident evil chapter where you play in the mansion
---
I had to stop running BPS/Cake/Pudding because everytime I would be the one crashing/infinite loading :/
---
Good players have played the game for thousands of hours just for that experience to be washed down the drain by a bad killer. I understand that it‚Äôs fun as killer just vaulting and swinging but from a survivor stand point it‚Äôs just stupid.
---
Would definitely rather have Rick
---
I did, and that's why I didn't go into any detail. Plus, if I really do want a chance of Ellie or Joel being added, I want to spread the idea as much as possible. 
---
That would be awesome if you do it please send it to me
---
Next you're going to tell me all the players in the trial had wildly different ranks!

---
Dwight x David
---
Yeah I guess so. I have probably been there. 
---
All we need now is a Myers skin for Clown called ‚ÄúOut of Shape‚Äù
---
People who play Legion &amp; Mei hate the thought of other people having fun.
---
Up to this man who read the lore. lol
---
I‚Äôm assuming the Blackened Catalyst is the ability that the Hag was given in order to place the phantom/phantasm traps.
---
I just had this happen when i ran from the killer in autohaven, hid behind a tree and suddenly i could only spin in a circle, crouch, recover, and heal.
---
I wouldn't hate Adrenaline if it didn't diddle Freddy, but a lot of the hate it's getting probably stems from one of 2 things:
---
A) Bad Killers that rely on NOED to do the work for them anyway
---
or
---
B) Killers that were hopeful for the Healing Nerfs to help them that are getting burned by Gen Speeds into Adrenaline.
---
?
---
I guess their crouch height is higher than females, or something?
---
Brutal. I slide off the top of the hill. I was in a never ending freefall... well until freddy had no issue downing me and then showing no mercy!
---
And both make you want to send your computer through the nearest window out of frustration at the lack of personal counter play.
---
I‚Äôm all for new content but the character you chose would be too short (I believe, not too familiar with FNAF stuff but I did see this character, unless she‚Äôs human sized then ignore my height comment.) for survivors to see and might be hard to see as the killer assuming they line up her pov to her low height. Her power seems a little too strong since just about anything would alert you to a survivor‚Äôs location. The ‚ÄúFavored‚Äù option seems too harsh of a thing for survivors (as it is base power). Faster movement speed would make chases far too short and the Exposed effect is overkill. Adding on that their aura is constantly shown for 8 seconds it would be easy to find them in 40 seconds and down them. The ‚ÄúFavored‚Äù cooldown is far too short for something this strong. 
---
Eternal Hunter: Way too crazy of a perk considering you can find survivors easily and bring them to an Exposed effect. The movement speed granted as a beneficial effect from being close to a favored survivor would allow you to be on top of a survivor and if they manage to get to a pallet this perk would render then a sitting duck.
---
Inner Sorrow: You said survivors who finished a gen suffer from a speed buff? I‚Äôm assuming you meant a speed nerf due to you saying suffer, meaning they get less speed than base speed when in chase. Again, exposed + no pallets + less speed = overkill. If you did mean buff as in they get more speed, idk why a killer would run this.
---
Joy of Creation: This perk seems ok if it is by missing a skillcheck but would work on lower ranks rather than high as survivors who are experienced wouldn‚Äôt miss skillchecks as often as lower ranked ones would. Then again it would be a worse perk when compared to similar perks that show aura with gens. (Discordance, BBQ, Bitter Murmur, Rancor) 
---
Resident evil kthx
---
Ash? Is that you?
---
It's available now. Go check. Ignore today's date.
---
I would so buy this cosmetics 
---
I think dlc for dbd usually releases later in the day
---
I like this idea, but would love to work for it with make your choice, or Devour hope and nail someone at distance when I get 3 stacks, or like them up with Blood Warden and NOED... her application is limiting currently due to perks not affecting her hatchets; I would love for this to change.
---
Maybe even allowing hatchets to ignore PEYG stacks could be an option too...
---
Or play with your food
---
It depends on how generous I‚Äôm feeling. 
---
\[in super deep black man voice\]
---
oh yeahhhhh
---
I love Hot Pants and Steel Ball Run is the best JoJo!
---
I've been through every rank since Freddy came out and I rarely see people playing Frwdsy this way. I dont know if you've just gotten lucky, but the majority odnplayers dont seem to do this 
---
Take a few to compare male and female crouch heights and you'll see bois
---
I mean kinda, I consider that camping as by definition it is but the community has made what we would define as camping, facecamping, and patrolling or staying near the hook is camping. I don‚Äôt fully understand it myself but yeah. 
---
Aye! I'd do it more often, but people tend to take advantage of this. 
---
This is the main reason why I don't prestige killers that I really enjoy playing! Also I feel your pain. Just got the plague and haven't gotten monitor and abuse even after spending like 20 bloodwebs worth of bloodpoints after rank 50. 
---
Oh I know and the same applies to my post! Since it‚Äôs the first of April, but look and see at all the butt heart little boys and girls!  :)
---
Fuck you
---
With the current pip system killers have to hit all the categories. And even more so get all the hooks. So yes in theory if they want the rewards they'd have to play pretty fair. BUT, the thing you're forgetting, is the salty ones who won't be able to pip and will take that out on survivors to screw them out of their rewards so they would play like a jerk lol.
---
Absolute unit.
---
No new killer
---
Yeah longtime fan of his, and It‚Äôs not like they are completely undoable it‚Äôs just better killers will next to never lunge against a 360 meaning they will always hit you. 
---
If you want to practice 360‚Äôs I‚Äôd say the best method is just joining a kyf with one or two people and fooling around for an hour or so practicing. Some people 360 differently than others as well so as for advice on how to do one, I just do the basic w a s d while flipping my mouse in a circle quickly. (I think, I‚Äôm trying to remember off the top of me head and I may be wrong)
---
&gt;Maybe even allowing hatchets to ignore PWYF stacks could be an option too...
---
why??? So Huntresse players can go around bloodlusting you with extra 15% to M1 you? That is boring as fuck from the survivor perspective.
---
r/bitchaboutdbd
---
RIP to Bi-Curious and Virgin. They‚Äôll be missed
---
You lose stacks if you M1...
---
This is only available with an ultra-rare addon.
---
Yeah thats what I was referring to maybe im underestimating how many unstable people are actually out there playing. And survivors have to do basically all the categories too. Not to mention share the generators and hooks amongst each other if you want everyone to pip. 
---
Idk man, in my experience, at least in the higher ranks, most Freddie‚Äôs play without merely tunneling one guy down at a time and I very rarely see someone talking about how they play Freddy or making a post about it and not saying basically the same thing your post says. 
---
I don't 'face camp' but I feel like patrolling is not that bad lol 
---
Yah I know, I accepted the Mori and was rooting for you guys to get out, but then the DC... figured it was some little kid and mommy said for him to get off his PlayStation for the night lol! 
---
I once putted the towel offering (yes i call it towel offering) and three survivors dc before the game even starts   
---
I think that would be a good idea! Thank you so much
---
Thank you!
---
I might just be unlucky then. Eh, it's not like I bump into many Freddys anyways 
---
That‚Äôs simply lowering yourself to their level. 
---
i‚Äôm solo queuing and it‚Äôs been on the ‚Äúfinding match‚Äù thing for 10 minutes lol.
---
&gt;You lose stacks if you M1...
---
Not before you bloodlust someone because you don't want to break a pallet.
---
Clem might be pretty easy as telltale went out of business. And yes we should get her! That would be awesome. Idk what skybound has in store for the serious but yes please get Clem!
---
Yah I was wondering about this, since I haven‚Äôt seen any toilets. The post above makes allot of sense, so make sure you got your tall boots on people! 
---
Yawn. 
---
thats proximity camping rather than face camping. 
---
basically if you attack the same person getting off the hook, survivors will find a way to bitch. 
---
I had a killer take in a shard for Freddy once and we all thought he had ebony Mori and two of the random just insta dc‚Äôd
---
Ok, ok, but where does vommy mommy's vomit go?
---
I agree with your commentüòÅ
---
Jane:I‚Äôm the new survivor!LOVE ME!
---
*Ash comes arounds*
---
Ash:Sorry sweetheart.But I‚Äôm more Well-known and iconic than you will ever be.
---
Jane:I‚Äôm becoming a killer now!
---
I don‚Äôt know many of the spawns, I just look around when I‚Äôm on generators because my Ruin always spawns by a gen
---
I want rewards, but I don't "exclusive must grind to rank 1 EVERY MONTH FOREVER to not miss out" cosmetics.
---
I greatly appreciate their store rules they started with that say anything you want to buy WILL be available.
---
Like hell you haven't.
---
The Game map is the best. 
---
-balanced landing
---
Mr stamina over here
---
The issue is that dbd requires a player to spawn near a killer belonging. Survivors should be required to spawn away from killer belongings to prevent this kind of stuff. While totem spawns do need revised, this would help a lot 
---
I'll still play killer. Need points for my Ash
---
There should be a killer V survivor mode where based on the killer,the survivor can pick up weapons (they are sent to the map the killer represents or came out with)that are meant for that specific killer.But they can still be hooked and it MORI‚Äôd 
---
/u/Title2ImageBot
---
Updates for dbd usually happen around 1 or 2ish in est time.
---
Trapper is kneeling right? Either way, super good colouring

I never got the whole Mei is the devil thing tbh. I never found her that bad to go against, but that‚Äôs just me.

Generally, if your trying to get better at killer you want to try to drop off your surv at the hook and go back to gen patrol. Your goal is to get in a chase before they get unhooked as that will leave 3 survs not doing gens. Camping near the hooks definitely gets you kills but when you go up against better survivors, they'll just blast through the gens while your waiting for the hook.
---
But if you're just learning, play how you want. I would disable the chat though, nothing good comes from there.
---
I'm on ps4 so I hope they catch on to my head nods
---
Personally I like getting with friends, name changing to ‚ÄúBlendette‚Äù and joining a lobby. On the off chance that the killer doesn‚Äôt dc he rage quits in game 
---
r/wosh
---
If I had to guess, the fog effects are being applied to auras. That‚Äôs why they fade away the further away you are. 
---
This actually happened to me twice today :(
---
I‚Äôm so excited for this
---
You bring up a good point that never crossed my mind. Looks like I might have to play some killer if need be.
---
I love doing this when I‚Äôm playing Jumpscare Myers. Play with the last two, final one gets the hatch but you can‚Äôt let them realize you‚Äôre giving it to them. Scratched Mirror on Lery‚Äôs is so good that the match is a slaughter if you don‚Äôt play around a little bit. There was one guy who decided to try to hide behind a pillar, and I just stared at him crouching there, expecting him to move. He didn‚Äôt, and then disconnected when I downed him.
---
Then he sent me hatemail for the next two hours, calling me a troll and a farmer and said I was ruining everybody‚Äôs  and screwing them over. I had fun, his teammates had fun, and they got screwed over more by the disconnect than me toying with them.
---
I WOULD NO JOKE PAY 50 BUCKS FOR THIS.
---
Probably shouldn‚Äôt be giving BHVR any ideas tho :/
---
I think that's their goal at this point. Making ranking up harder so it has more meaning.
---

---
Or it could be like this one game I had where it was a basement insidous Leatherface with rancor, so the obsession knew where he was and messaged us (xbox). he never left the basement.
---
 Honestly no matter how hard they make it it won‚Äôt give it a meaning other than longer load times and both sides sweating 
---
This is assuming people run DS. The stun isn't long enough if the killer has enduring and I don't see many people using it now.
---
I'm a newbie. How do I get it?
---
Yeah i always get confused when i write this word lol( its not my first language so yeah back off) 
---
Damn right. Gonna wake up early, too. 
---
I don't want it just because I'd actually have to try at the game again and that makes the game unfun and once you get to rank 1 you won't want to play just in case you lose the rank and have bad luck going back up. I remember back when the game first came out after a few seasons they said they'd have rank 1 rewards going within the next few seasons. If they actually work on making the pip system better and it goes by your overall rank for the season then maybe.
---
you should give us his twitch name so we can give him the recognition he deserves for being such a nice  and kind player
---
OP, lemme ask you 
---
What about sombra and baptise mains who throw down their invinciblity things the moment their about to die 
---
Those piss me off more
---
What actually is this? It happened to me earlier today too
---
I actually agree with you. I feel people make up all these rules for the killers. It's like they want the killers to go easy on them and when they don't they get all salty. People are honestly lucky there's all this "honor" involved and killers don't just tunnel and camp the survivors into oblivion 
---
Nah, I had a check to see if they were like, ten, but no videos at all.

I think they're a bit salty that following me around with a flashlight and missing every save didn't work out for them in the end, really.
---
(No issues with flashlight saves, they're in the game like).
---
They have decided that they want to die. 
---
Actually the time is fine, I think. If they aren't tunnelling you, then that minute goes by quick, I never got to use it if they weren't specifically going after me. I think they should just buff the stun time of DS. Only to 5 or 6 seconds, gives enough time to gain some distance. I don't care about the swapping obsession thing honestly. Only obsession perk I run as killer is STBFL and usually I hit the obsession anyway. Also fix the animation bug for killers when hit by ds.
---
Also, additional comment to say yes, matchmaking sucks, but if it helps, I barely play Plague and just needed a daily so it probably evened out. 
---
This would require her to sacrifice an add-on slot and a perk slot to gain one effect

The Evil Dead rights don‚Äôt work that way. They‚Äôd have to license from StudioCanal for ED2 stuff and MGM for AoD stuff (Universal owns video rights but MGM owns merchandise rights) on top of licensing AvED stuff from Lionsgate. Also, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and Rob Tapert own the original film.
---
So far everything announced is from AvED specifically which makes sense because they‚Äôve only specifically said they licensed from Lionsgate. It also uses the entire ‚ÄúAsh vs Evil Dead‚Äù name (as opposed to The Evil Dead, Evil Dead II or Army of Darkness) and logo.

Camping: any back and forth to a hooked survivor, ensuring that rescue is close to impossible. It ties to tunnelling as there's no reason for you to camp if it's not too tunnel the victim seconds later after they are freed. 
---
Tunnelling: an attempt to chase and down the same survivor again when they just got unhooked seconds ago. 
---
Is that just manipulation on meg or is she getting a skin with the Ash vs Evil Dead update. She kinda looks like Ruby in this picture.

Exactly why I don't run DH anymore. Very fun idea for a perk, in reality just ends up being a dead perk slot 90+% of the time.
---
Sometimes I delude myself. "They're a SWF, they're gonna call out that there's two live totems and not cleanse them in case it's haunted ground." Nope. Every time.
---
I don‚Äôt see the perk slot being a ‚Äòsacrifice‚Äô when it allows me to start to use a variety of builds, as opposed to meta-Bunny.

#BUTTSEX MYERS#
---
speak for yourself
---
imagine the frustration and pain of having 3 teammates running urban evasion, self-care who hide as soon as they hear the slightest of heartbeats and spend a total of 3 minutes every map healing in the corner (when they arent losing chases in 5 seconds)
---
now imagine how much worse that would be if you were missing out on rewards because of it
---
Let‚Äôs hope so 
---
I'm not sure what you mean by it "allowing you to start to use a variety of builds"
---
You can already use a variety of builds, all your suggestion would do is require an extra combination of add-ons and perks to use in builds
---
If people can't tell youre joking, you need a better delivery
---
Will try that if I found out how :)
---
I still agree with you on this one!
---
love mei. second main. she‚Äôs easy to counter so i dunno why people talk shit so much about her as a character

You've earned my respect.

people do not like me I understand now understand I love clown he‚Äôs one of my mains and is p3

Well i was going to try and get a good nights sleep but i guess i'm dealing with this now.
---
1: Lose and age? Really? those were the best insult you could come up with?
---
2: The whole "no one wants anything to do with fnaf" thing is a matter of pure opinion. 
---
3: There's a difference between criticism and bashing if you want and example of actual criticism then look at KingADerp, Mizuna752 and drkflame6666 as they all left decent and concise criticism without bashing as they were mostly calm and collected and had actual grievances with it and while i may disagree with some of their points that dose not mean i don't take them into account. 
---
In conclusion i need sleep and if your still being a general nuisance by the time i wake up then your a more determined troll than i. 
---
I like Lery‚Äôs and The Game. I‚Äôm a Leatherface main but I like them as survivor and killer 
---
7pm norway i think

Of the ones on the list, I‚Äôd have to choose **Child‚Äôs Play** just because the first **Child‚Äôs Play** is genuinely one of my favorite horror movies ever and I actually like most of the sequels, which is more than I can say for most similarly long running horror franchises.  However, in the ‚Äúother‚Äù category I‚Äôd personally fucking love a chapter based on **The Lost Boys**.  We haven‚Äôt had any vampires yet, and what better choice for a vampire killer than Kiefer Sutherland?  The survivor perks could also be pretty unique, if they used Sam while he was a half vampire.  And having a map set on a boardwalk/beach/beachside would be a great change of pace from the current maps and could be a lot of fun.

I‚Äôve made the idea of Chucky joining the game into a meme, even though it‚Äôs my wet dream, but truthfully if they will ever do him it‚Äôd be stupid not to during June update due to all the free promotion they‚Äôd get because of the film.

I used to think the one-liner spitting goofy horror comedy character portrayed by Bruce Campbell from films directed by Sam Raimi would never fit but if he can I‚Äôm 100% sure one of the most iconic 80‚Äôs slashers and arguably scariest to some can fit easily. The real issue would be making him work with his size, but with money put into it or an alternative route it could work if they really wanted it to. 
---
Im a juker myself, biggest tip from me is probably to not always do the same juke cuz they get predictable later in the game. For example: if you succeed a 360 to the right, then get hit the next time try to either go for a moonwalk juke: if you have a flashlight, or maybe spin to the left.

If youre PC and EU feel free to add me, we could maybe play some together and i might be able to teach you some things :)

Ah okay, just realized i can make it teachable at level 35. This gonna take a while lol
---
Thank you for my daily dose of cringe
---
My Huntress is only like level 13 and I only play her for rituals really, so I couldn't tell ya lmao
---
Ah I didn't know the pig had an addon like that. But from the time I've played (200ish hours) and from what I've watched yeah killer has to play in an unfun way (tunnel, slug) to get consistent 4ks. Im glad to know for the most part I'm not too far off the mark. I have heard people say recently huntress is overrated and pig is underrated. 
---
Thanks for the feedback though it helps a lot. üòÅ

Of course not! More clem = better.

Lol, would of been a top notch HP reference.

Who gave you a picture of me?

They never had to use any AoD rights. Basically someone at STARZ told them they could say Ash traveled back to medieval times without being sued by MGM or Universal because ED2 established that years before AoD.
---
They had to give credit to StudioCanal in the end credits of every show because they used elements from ED2 all the time. They never had to credit Universal or MGM because they never used anything that specifically originated in AoD. They didn‚Äôt use S-Mart or the gauntlet hand or Shiela or the AoD Evil Ash design or the Death Coaster. They did use the term ‚Äúboomstick‚Äù but that had been used in video games and comics for years without anyone getting sued.

One of my favorite things in Dead by Daylight is when a licensed character comes out I‚Äôll go and watch the entire series they are from. So the past couple days I‚Äôve watched all the films and I‚Äôm almost done with the show. I‚Äôm definitely a big fan of Evil Dead now.
---
3 I‚Äôd like to see are:
---
T-1000 and Sarah Connor
---
Pennywise and adult Jim(name may be wrong)
---
Demigorgon and Hopper in the Hawkins arcade.

I...uhhh....I‚Äôve got no idea what to say about this

I'm pretty sure the OP is, lol. Had to have their mom buy the game because they weren't old enough.
---
im a straight man, and this comment chain is hilarous
---
It would have been perfect if there were timestamps in chat.. we know he was still there 30 min in too
---
The one problem I can't see them getting around for Chucky is hooking unless he YEETS them onto a hook and it I don't think will be here because we have a clown (just my 2 cents not trying to be a contrarian)
---
Why is there a killer in this photo though
---
That claudette shirt.. omfg i wish that was a real shirt

I thought this was a ‚ÄúMei is Bae‚Äù/Julie best Girl reference.

How's your optimization, bud?

I'm not a big fan of it personally. I find it to boring and it's just unfair for the person being hooked. I want to play the game and so do they.
---
You're fucking up, bud.
---
Sometimes I play Unreakable, Tenacity, DS and intentionally get hit and fall myself Crawldette. 
---
??? 
---
Really makes me wonder how much time this killer wasted 
---
Also makes me wish they‚Äôd implement a hatch change to eliminate stand offs 
---
April Fools was yesterday.
---
(It's a joke about when you wait a bit, then go to tap someone up and they haven't done shit to recover.)
---

---
jk, i love ya
---
I would hold it against people though. I hate spending tine loading in to just be a one and done. you know? It feels like they dont have any decency to treat others how they'd like to be treated. 
---
I might be misunderstanding, but shouldn‚Äôt the choices be between Recover or Crawl? Excluding tenacity if you are crawling, you aren‚Äôt recovering...the decision would to either crawl or to recover, right?
---
Michael Scott (The Office US) vs. Gru (Despicable Me: Trilogy)
---
Heard bout it, really nice and funny 
---
It really bothers me that BHVR got the terminator license for their dead game instead of dead by daylight 
---
Sounds like a challange to try :p
---
That's good to hear. Evil Dead has been one of my favorite series for years. The movies, even the musical was great. I did enjoy the reboot(?) too, especially because it would've brought as back in the sequel but it didn't happen and we got Ash VS Evil Dead instead, which I haven't got to see I don't have tv. I think Ash is going to be one of my main survivors...along with Feng, Meg, and Kate. Basically my only male main survivor xD Get your 1mil bp ready!
---
All the more reason to keep talking.
---

It had counterlplay until 1.5 update, where dribbling got nerfed. You sure? Also, the survivors are part of the game, too. I have 4k hours and im a killer main trynna be a survivor main after long break.
---
Yeah, Frank is a literal S E X
---
OP, did you delete that comment where you used a dry ass meme to be a dick to someone trying to help you?
---
That's actually hilarious.
---
Hatch stand offs are only a thing if you're a bad survivor. Any semi competent survivor knows that with a hatch standoff you have the upper hand and that you can pressure the killer really ez to leave the hatch etc. 
---
It was the show's version of Negan so that's likely another hurdle. 
---
They think I'm chunky 
---
We want that beer belly
---
This just makes me bummed we didn't get a killer with Ash, but it makes sense if they pulled him from the tv series, noone from that seems to fit as killer (at least not that I'm aware of). People wanted Evil Ash, but he's only in Army of Darkness. The version of him people would want to see anyway.
---
What rank. Im 15 and it takes 2 seconds to find matches on both sides. Swf hasnt been slow with 2 people either. 
---
Then it just disappears 
---
My picks would have to be Scream and Alien because I think they have so much potential. 
---
Scream Chapter:
---
- Ghostface‚Äôs power could allow him to hide in lockers.
---
- Sydney Prescott would be a cool survivor
---
- phones could be implemented into the game in some way similar to the fountains for plague and the jigsaw boxes for pig
---
Alien Chapter:
---
- The map could be the Nostromo
---
- Ripley would be a badass survivor
---
- The Alien as a killer could have a really great mori 
---
Someone on the official DBD forum posted McLean said in a stream that Iri heads would be reworked.  I think 3 hatchets with an instadown from 20+meters would be a fine change.
---
R U N
---
Yes. 
---
Eh. Not really. Both sides have it pretty bad, and are pretty much forced into the standoff
---
I'm currently rank 10 on ps4 in EU and have no longer queues than 10 minutes. I did however meet a rank 2 killer with 3 survivors that were all 13 and higher, which was super weird. But the queue time for that game was short so I can't really complain

That would mean that she will have to die though. Unless they make her OP *wink wink*

My lobbies get filled in less than 30 seconds already.
---
Agreed, I dont think he was OP. Everyone just didnt understand him and didnt take the time to figure out how to play against him. I agree that he isnt very fun to play against, all I look for in a killer is fun to play as and against 
---
Survivors beeing scared? Thats a new one...
---
You aren‚Äôt lying. 
---
I really don't think he wasted more then the Meg, I guess he was just afk (like he said he was) and when he came back he just hit her and hooked her.
---
My wallet is ready devs
---
If the survivors start working on gens and there is no ruin, they are less likely to go look for a totem. It might give your DH a longer lifespan if they aren't trying to find a totem.
---
Many idiot teamamtes don't get the memo
---
Making things worse is when me abd a teammate had opened the gates and I got hooked and the killer camped I messaged my teammate telling them to leave and escape and they tried to unhook and we both died
---
Complain all you want there will always be times where people are too altheuostic
---
I think horror period fits. Do you read the lore? The entity wants anything dark or demented. Aliens kill people man. In space. 
---
It should spawn 3 perks and let us buy 2 after level 40 the grind has gotten ridiculous and only gets worse when perks that don‚Äôt fit your play style  clutter up your web. There is way too many perks now for bloodwebs to only give 2 perks, the grind has become insane for people who don‚Äôt have hours to spend on just playing this game 
---
Giving the shit bhvr has done to the dbd discord server I can just tell they are trying to be a walking shitpost 
---
is there a part of the entities realm that has nothing but romance, those are pretty strong feelings
---
never seen so much toxicity in one photo
---
I know this comments a joke, and taking it at face value is dumb, but this isn't really a win for inclusivity, its lazy, if you want inclusion actually write characters to be how you say they are.
---
What have you brought apon this cursed land
---
I don‚Äôt think healing as soon as possible is needed, just heal at your best judgment. Sometimes a gen should take priority over healing, especially if no teammates are around to heal for you. Also if you find it hard to depend on teammates, try to find maybe one other person to play with, it will make it much more bearable.
---
Every scream killer has always been a different person. The only thing is they shared a mask and tried to kill the same person. The new scream throws me off with the mask but man it feels like a scream movie. 
---
And Quentin 
---
i mean yeah i was 1000% joking lol i was making fun of ppl who think half-assed breadcrumbs like this are actually ‚Äúwins‚Äù for inclusivity
---
Report him lol
---
Yea...it's dumb...no idea why they keep breaking the audio ALL THE TIME
---
Nice perk , self care is trash now so i will make a dead hard build with it. The fact thats it counters even os damage from anything is great 
---
Dead hard , ds , New perk , and maybe deliverance , idw to put adrenaline because of noed , and you need to be injured to get the effect of protection 
---
If you do this you should test 3 cases: 10min/20min/30min to make sure the stealth percentage doesn‚Äôt increase exponentially as more time elapses 
---
I agree with what you said, but I dont think it all makes self care that bad
---
Maybe above Plague? I don't have lots of experience with Plague so I'm kinda shaky on where she stands, but Huntress and Hag have been pretty close in strength for a while, so I'd probably stick her up there.
---
Though, to be fair, I pretty much fully consider Huntress to be better simply because her skill cap is much higher, and a good Huntress can absolutely dominate.
---
Big oofs
---
Not on your list, but my number 2 most wanted update would be changes to SWF.
---
maybe they should just fix the ranking system so it doesn't ENCOURAGE toxic behavior, I also dislike how it discourages specialists and encourages generalists (for survivors) you gotta do everything in every category to rank up
---
Should just have a "moderately increase windup time"

---
you're right. I'm an idiot because I assumed a company made a fake post on april fools but instead it was someone else who faked a fake post on april fools. BIG OOF. Big brain plays, you're so smart DOOD
---
can we talk about how they added little sparkling circle things around traps when you place them down to define where its range is, it was never there before, they added it and no one said anything
---
what? was that supposed to be clever? I don't enjoy stupid humor. Period. 
---
Its holding the game hostage. So yes.
---
I'm 15, thank you very much
---
Omg yes please 
---
"The game to work and not be a bug filled mess" isnt an option sorry

End game has a report system otherwise if you know their gamer/steam name you can report it to BHVR with evidence for best results.

Thank you my friend!
---
The tall man dlc needs its name back.
---
I dont understand people in standoffs seroiously pathetic lol
---
I get way more hate with Symmetra than Mei, hell Brigitte and Moira get more hate from my experience.
---
glad to see we're all on the same page
---
I mean i agree messaging is pointless but id try to improve your abilities and not just tunnel or camp every survivor
---
I think it'd fall more under body blocking. If there was someone outside doing gens, it was really holding the *game* hostage, he was more holding the three people hostage
---
I caught on to it when they misused "then." 
---
They have the rights to childs play the original. Its why they made him a robot so universal cant go and make a sequel to the film they own the rights too because its different. 
---
Wraith is easy if you bring Object of Obsession and even easier if you bring a flashlight too.
---
I think Hag‚Äôs default clothing is more revealing than a bikini
---
They thought about that and they're joking about but they didnt want to add a realm of "good feelings" even thought it could be logical.
---

Where's the fix the fucking game check box? And the dedicated servers check box?
---
"still pipped". Damn, I bet OP won't be able sleep properly for a couple of nights now.
---
Claudette is so gross
---
Unpopular opinion, legion really isn't that bad unless they're playing scummy. I've always found that the shittiest killers play legion in the hope to be "Toxic" and in reality most don't know wtf they're doing
---
Relatable
---
See next week, on the next repost, of course.
---
I got a big bone for him too if you know what I mean
---
Is it? They would have to get rights from dead studio. I do not know who has the rights for the game after teltate gone bankrupt but that might be problematic 
---
Play killer and then you‚Äôll get better
---
It would be cool, but how would they do a Telltale's TWD killer?
---
Yeah. It's instantly loading into matches for both killers and survivors.
---
Please stop, Clown is mine. 
---
Survivors might finally start the trial on hooks if that happens 
---
is that Randy from trailer park boys
---
Oh hell yeah.  This perk seems great design
---
1 use to buy you an extra hit and a speedburst to run to a next loop, that depending on the map can hold the killer for minutes. Kinda like ds did
---
Goes off in any game, or you're not even in a danger of dying.
---
3 surprise ones of it. 
---
Has a downside that can be ignored by staying injured or near a strong loop til you're downed again.
---
 
---
Has no counter if you're not playing very specific killers
---
And most importantly, because it is mostly strong against spirit, hag, nurse, and lesser m1 killers, it will bring us back to the OG "Dead By Billy"-meta
---
Even if it turns out to be of low power level, it is still among the worst designed perks with NOED, Sprintburst and old DS.
---
There‚Äôs literally no way to tell what killer it‚Äôll be though so it doesn‚Äôt even matter. 
---
That's when you "tunnel" the weak link pretending you couldn't tell. 
---
*The killer of the match in the house, who would be myers by normal standards but lets just assume that its joey from the legion being like: YOU PICKED THE WRONG HOUSE FOOL!*
---
Skybound Entertainment picked up the rights and released the last two episodes of the final season after Telltale went under. 
---
OP was talking about himself and not other people. 
---
All brawn, no brain
---
When my boyfriend and I play together If we‚Äôre the last 2, whoever finds the hatch first gets to escape while the other leads the killer as far away as possible to be hooked and die. Sometimes though the killer sucks at chases the one of us who found the hatch does a gen or two and we can both get out. That‚Äôs especially satisfying when the killer has noed because when we play together we both do all totems lol
---
while this is an april fools. It would make the game so much more scary for survivors as it probably should be.

Agreed. Plus I'd like the stupid 1mil bp cap to be removed. I reach 1 mil regularly and I would like to save as much as possible instead of being forced to burn it on my characters (all rank 3 lvl 50)
---
Because killers have no more things to complain about. 
---
My friends and I would try to use ours together but quickly learn never to try 
---
If 2 were used there goes that. Kinda stupid how it is lost due to dc.
---
If you facecamp for no reason, you have a little pee-pee. 
---
y e s cosmetics 
---
Yea, its usually  bad killers who think playing an annoying killer will get them kills and most of the time it wont
---
Aaaand now there TWO jigsaw copycats!
---
UEH HA UEH HA HA 
---
I keep seeing about adept killer or survivor. What does that mean?
---
Ace: This, is a locker.
---
Dwight: Dear god.
---
Ace: There is more.
---
Dwight: No!
---
true I should be grateful. But it triggers me more
---
I think they broke it as a result of the audio changes in 2.6.0.
---
They made Survivors quieter in lockers, but I think they applied it universally. 
---
Footsteps, I think, are just being drowned out by the chase music. 
---
Or they will just camp
---
Everyone here loves to shit on DbD until there's another game to complain about.
---
Friendly end game chat how absurd
---
I've only had a few in my 1500 hours, I tend to sneak around locking for the hatch, if the killer is on i t I just do gens and save the one furthest away for last and hide when it pops, then I sneak for the hatch and if the killer is still there I open a door.
---
On PC I get this when EAC doesn't load up. Which is fixed by launching directly from my Steam Library instead of my shortcut.
---
Why is it a survivor thing? Why should I leave the hatch? Just take the hit and let the survivor go or stand there for hours because you absolutely need that extra few hundred of points. If you don't like survivors take the hatch then maybe you shouldn't patrol it and make it obvious where it is but patrol the map and see if you can find the survivor before he finds the hatch.
---
That scene of the movie was so epic :P
---
pretty much a 100% chance to camp then call you racial slurs in the post game chat
---
With the Legion, kill 1 survivor by your own hands.
---
No thank.
---
Dwight, it'd take forever for me to get another survivor to the status that my Dwight is since I have every perk on Dwight that's currently out.
---
(Stop complaining or they'll make it double pip as survivor too D: )
---
Big yes.
---
I'm all for shirtless Kate
---
Hol up, your username isn‚Äôt coolcreepers445!
---
Imo there‚Äôs a line between camping in general and just staring at the hook constantly. It really shouldn‚Äôt be a thing and it pains me that wraiths have a reputation for it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, repeatedly ‚Äòpatrolling‚Äô the hook can be very annoying but no killer tactic is on the level that facecamping is. Everything else has potential for counterplay
---
Obviously you can‚Äôt get hooked if you don‚Äôt get downed but the game is balanced around survivors getting at least two hooks. Taking out frustration on a facecamper is understandable but I personally  more satisfaction in gens being done to show the guy why it‚Äôs not fun or effective for anyone
---
I will be running tenacity + flip-flop later today :)
---
So many times my wigle bar is almost full! and I only use WGLF and Provethyself. So I don't really lose anything important :)
---
It's a teaser for the Evil Dead Killer secretly coming with Ash
---
Because I saw the exact same picture many times over on this subreddit. 
---
Shh, he‚Äôs just one of those new special ed kids, I think they call them survivor mains or something?
---
There was an evil Ash clone in the show, but he gets dispatched pretty easily and was nothing more than just mortal Ash Williams but bad
---
nono the real april fools be:
---
Scratched mirror and vanity mirror on outside maps.
---
padded jaws (with, without bloody coil).
---
speed limiter.
---
rusty shackles and scarred hand.
---
scrapped tape and high stimulus electrode.
---
The beast soot and Coxcombed Clapper.
---
mother daughter ring and prayer beads bracelet.
---
I cant think of any other ultra gimmicky/silly or unexpected combos
---
You would be correct (was developed by a 3rd party):  twitter.com/theoddgentlemen/status/941062837656363010
---
Also, in case your unaware, Illfonic also did not have any 3D artist working on the game. So all of the characters were also developed by a 3rd party: artbully.co/friday-the-13th-the-game
---
I learned from that (3d artist) that its not uncommon in the industry for developers to seek out established 3rd party studios, whom specialize in character models. Which in turn, made me have even more respect for the Dead By Daylight team, since all of their stuff is done in house.
---
DH is an instant down. 
---
I screamed internally before remembering it's that day
---
I think a shirtless bundle of all the killers would earn enough to make dedicated servers for life
---
I would destroy every chair in the entity‚Äôs realm, so if Myers wanted to sit, he would have to use my face as a chair. 
---
Good work mate. Big question here. Did you pip? XD.
---
Bruh
---
Have you played Resident Evil games? There are many awesome survivors you could play as and a shitton of Tyrant types of killers to choose from, Nemesis and Mr. X being some of them. 
---
I love the weapon. 
---
that's alright, i understand. i will still play as them because they give so many bloodpoints and i need as many as i can carry.
---
Herp derp Legion takes zero skill to play as, you don‚Äôt have to aim or anything it‚Äôs an auto kill. 
---
&gt; It would make for the perfect ant april fools joke! 
---
Not necessarily a good thing when we are talking out a licensed DLC which they are trying to sell.
---
&gt; nobody would probobly believe them 
---
This is why they would never do it, they would lose money because of it.
---
I love how everyone acts like teabagging is always malicious when it is the only expression a survivor can do - which isn't the really slow point and come animations.
---
I'll do what you describe but I'll teabag too out of respect.
---
God please no he‚Äôs such a cheesy killer. 
---
Since when tombstone is good/scary
---
ran into them yesterday too, but killer instant disconnected 
---
Console has inbuilt recording software, uses phone.  
---
no, nobody plays Tapp
---
That would have still been way more hype than what happened. I mean they even got Bruce Campbell. Heads would have been flying off into space. 
---
I bet you think spinning killers on console is impressive as well
---
Ruining the game for others playing with you nice!
---
No
---
Oh really? I haven't noticed, I'll have to take a look.
---
I mean, if you look, this is console gameplay, ofc legion is ass to play on console 
---
:D
---
So stop stressing out and be happy with what you get, that‚Äôs the only way to get better
---
It already works like that with Doc
---
and 1 killer
---
Still got me hyped
---
This is why I'm a Trapper main.
---
Bless you
---
I was joking! üò≤
---
It was more self-deprecation if anything cause I‚Äôve had that happen to me so many times. üò≠
---
I thought it was just kill everyone on the hook. 
---
The only 2 adepts I need is clown and plague. 
---
That's so sweet of you :)
---
Don't have time to watch the full video but yeah the lore seems accurate.
---
Yeah they whined enough to get the 1 OP perk nerfed into oblivion so now they have to get adrenaline nerfed too. Noed is totally balanced though.
---
I really want those filthy survivors to be punished for dcing. Btw, i am definitely not a Legion main that abuses the glitched addons on purpose.
---
Oh my bad, you never detect a Piggy until it‚Äôs too late.. *Turns as a growl sounds behind him*
---
‚ÄúOmG wALLhAcKs‚Äù
---
That's good? I don't see why you have to downvote me to say that however.  
---
If this game would first of all stop being Bug by Daylight and fix the necessity of ranking up and etc. thus giving fair game modes for once. Then maybe these rewards would be nice and all.
---
Also, they could at least give community green light on making mods. But we all know they're not okay with this.
---
Haven't downvoted any of your comments, so not sure what you mean, mate
---
Lee, not Clem.
---
chonky
---
I have to admit that catching survivors with traps is very satisfying.
---
The suggested extra BP?
---
They get self care nerfed into the ground, use sloppy butcher every game, and then get mad when everybody uses adrenaline. And still say noed is balanced.
---
Maybe you don‚Äôt care about the fps, but for us console players it‚Äôs very important 
---
I love it. They all look cool, Laurie looks unrelaxed like she is paranoid,which fits her character, and Nea looks pretty. Nice.
---
It's just that if you haven't genrushed against Myers with Judith and Thuft of hair, your team is screwed at certain moment and absolutely nothing can be done about it. No cooldown, no looping, he just patrols and insta kills everyone he sees
---
Dead hard also is very unreliable of the killer has bad ping. If the pings above 100 theres a 50/50 chance of dead hard working. 
---
Haha betch I got Unbreakable.
---
Well, rumour has it BHVR are either close to or atm working on Halloween 2018 cosmetics for Michael and Laurie. If that‚Äôs true... I‚Äôd be really fucking happy.
---
Will Ash also be on sale when he comes out?
---
Just uncloak in a distance or behind a wall. 
---
Or basically Survivor that doesn't know Wraith's weakness.
---
and then the panic when you get caught in one as the Trapper makes his way from the other side of the map, and you still aren't out after a dozen escape attempts
---
Don‚Äôt want to stop anyone from using anything. I just have a lot of fun already with long range BBQ/Bitter Murmur snipes and if survivors now bring the aura perks themselves that‚Äôs lovely.
---
am i the only one to think Ash was leaked on purpose to ease the hate of the community because of poor state of the game and give us something to look forward to because there won't be a hotfix any time soon?
---
Having just recently played Season 1, it is weird as shit to see Clementine fully grown
---
With sole survivor, urban evasion and spine chill or premonition?
---
Try to play killer with 25 fps
---
The effect of the Trapper is so strong that I find myself instinctively looking for traps in grass even when I already know it‚Äôs a different killer
---
Or when you see papa thicc doing his intimidating ass walk towards your crippled little survivor
---
After games against Trapper I'm so fucking paranoid even when I'm playing against a different killer
---
Can't change your mind if I agree.
---
Ash lookin like trash tbh
---
I was thinking Steve from Minecraft, but you this can also work.
---
Do keep in mind what they did with Legion, making other cosmetics turning him into other characters. We could very well get a Pig cosmetics that changes Amanda into Hoffman, Gordon or even Jigsaw himself (the killer power name wouldn‚Äôt make much sense there but eh).
---
There isn‚Äôt. Survivors have their definition and killers have theirs. If you aren‚Äôt purposely trying to play like a douche, then it doesn‚Äôt matter. Survivors will get salty regardless of how you play, so you might as well play to win.
---
Because it's a licensed killer, isn't it obvious that they just can't? Give it up people.
---
It‚Äôs the book of the dead‚Äôs work
---
He is absolutely lovely &lt;3 
---
Can't say anything except some good words about him. 
---
Only r12 though, gj anyways :-)
---
What about unnecessarily buff shirtless myers
---
I think she deserves a break.
---
I do not want to kill her.
---
Most Survivors tend to go and get trapped on most obvious chasing spots or jungle gyms.
---
I would just place them in most random spots as possible and they would still be furious at me even more.
---
Yeah I get that it's cool on the killer side, but nobody wants to play Quinton, Laurie, Tapp, or Bill as their main survivor because they are quite simply outdated models in comparison.  
---
Me too but I also don't feel like it would be a good dead by daylight fit. Still wouldn't be mad if they did it though.
---
Camping should be punished by keeping people that do it at rank 20. People who play leather face and camp with insidious belong forever at rank 20. Its the laziest and least skillful way to play the game. It's like sitting in the corner with a shotgun in an fps. And campers almost always do it for stupid reasons. Whenever I get facecaped I usually get an unhinged tirade in postgame chat written in broken english about how looping is an exploit.
---
I personally believe this would be very unhealthy for the game to suddenly allow microtransactions for bloodpoints. 
---
Not only would it leave a sour taste to the community to effectively pay to bypass the grind but it would also paint a very negative image of the devs for this game to newer players. This is something EA would do except they would also make iridescent shards cost money to purchase.
---
I believe there are much better ways to deal with the grind. 
---
Give better rewards to higher ranks. I have no idea why devs have not already done this.
---
Give more perks or overall increase the potential blood point gain throughout a match.
---
Add in extra rewards for devotion levels to increase both bp &amp; shard gainage 
---
Simple changes to the ranking to reward players for playing the game should be implemented as its a more healthy &amp; encouraging approach to keep veterans playing the game.
---
4 rank diff is nothing. thats an even game
---
The left one is Bloody Party Streamers (or BPS) and it doubles the BP everyone gains (all survivors and Killer as well) 
---
The right offering is a secret offering (doesn‚Äôt reveal in the loading screen). And there‚Äôs a offering named Ebony Memento Mori that is secret and once the killer hooks a person, he can kill with his own hands. 
---
There‚Äôs also others secret offerings but the ebony is the worst for survivors. But it‚Äôs pretty rare to come by
---
Immersed all the time when I play killer. I do the stare thing too, not even stalking. Just fool around
---
YES YES AND YES
---
&gt;getting triggered by looping in 2019, after it's been nerfed directly and indirectly a million times a million different ways
---
Oh yeah, give me more Clown
---
If you watch the movies early Ash was a bit of a pussy. He didn't really step up to being a badass until the latter part of the 2nd movie. Even then he had his moments of scared idiocy. Although we're going to be playing as Ash from the "...VS Evil Dead" series, so on that I could see your point. My main point I guess is even at his most badass level, he's still a bumbling jackass. Just like he's supposed to be. Without weapons, in a strange environment, and surrounded by strange new monsters I think it fits.
---
The Legion mask makes want to have a Legion Psycho mask from Borderlands
---
I had to gather some perks for clown but now he's super fun to me. And Spirit is definitely a little challenge, and that is what makes her fun. Also she can jump scare.
---
I'd get Legion, cause it's basically a survivor.
---
Can i have a Peppermint
---
Will take either Amanda or Ellen 
---
Remember when there was the 3x bp event? No? Because i do. When every killer had like 20 moris  and Survivors had like 30 purple flashlights after one or two days. There is a reason why the devs don't do another 3x bp event. And paying for bp should not be in the mind of the devs. This is not a mobile game or free to play game
---
Like I said, we were really bad. We didnt understand that you control how far you can blink. It was always: Max charge and after that the second charge also maxed out. We thought it was dumb that you charged the second time only to get stunned... 
---
He isn't even lying. Sales is a bitch.
---
&gt; but nobody wants to play Quinton, Laurie, Tapp, or Bill as their main survivor because they are quite simply outdated models in comparison.
---
Speak for yourself, I enjoy playing Laurie, Tapp and Bill and I'm certainly not the only one who don't care about their lack of cosmetics. Would it be nice to have more options? Sure! But it's not something that'll make or break a character to me.
---
Unfortunately the date is April 1st I will forever be sad
---
Hmm, I tend to enjoy a lot of the comedic moments in the series. Like when Ash kinda has a mental breakdown after cutting his hand off and is crouching up and down with the objects in the house in Evil Dead 2. I find the music selection in the TV series to be pretty comedic as it is usually relevant to a situation the group is in. I really enjoy the callbacks to the films and when Ash gets broken down at the Cabin in the first season, you can definitely appreciate the emotional range Campbell has playing Ash. But Army of Darkness is my favorite by far, such a campy but fun film with a great ending. I‚Äôll give that movie a shot though, as I grew up already liking Bruce Campbell from the Raimi Spider-Man films and games.
---
I need that knight gauntlet.

---
The worst are the people who wait at the exit gate while you chase the other survivors out of the other exit gate, only to just make you walk across the map so they can teabag before leaving...Those people can fuck off. Only time I won't say GG after a match, fuck people that just want to waste your time.
---
Or, you know, let different development apartments do their job. 
---
5 people working on the same code is never going to fix anything anyway.
---
I would hate for this game to turn into a pay to win game, which is essentially what it'll become. For now, none of the things that cost IRL money are P2W, as most of these are cosmetics or characters, of which you'll have a chance to get the perks for for free from the shrine. Reducing the grind would be good for the game, but P2W would not be the solution.
---
Oh ok, was confusing because you said it like it was a fact.
---
I too used to face camp people who tbagged. That was when I was utter shit at the game though. Once you achieve any sort of emotional maturity and get good at the game you realise tbagging wastes the survivors time and people who do it usually suck, you can easily kill them without camping or even tunneling them. And get the rest of their team.
---
They may be vets, but they lack intelligence so feel good :D
---
Also if you're like me and have developed a hate for the survivors to the point that you enjoy the salt that you get, you should be fiiiiiiiine &lt;3
---
What killer would she come with? Or she just standalone?
---
No toxicity in chat. This is obliviously photoshopped 
---
That reminded me of Entity'sLeftHand's stream.....What was up with his stream yesterday? April fools joke that nobody seemed to like, and he was completely out of character...
---
I'm assuming you know what I'm talking about, if not carry on!
---
Real quickly putting this here, I‚Äôm the Huntress in the clip and went into his stream afterwards only for them to be playing the clip as I joined. I‚Äôve never actually seen someone repeatedly jump in and out, but being who it was I expected no less.
---
I didn‚Äôt expect some entirely random guy to join in on it. I swear when I prestige Huntress for my last time I‚Äôm never using Iron Maiden again, holy shit.
---
Wait, wasn't yesterday April Fools. But this is pure yaoi.
---
Trapper. I got rekt. And I think I played Jane
---
PS4 player here also friendly killer who likes to meme and be silly from time to time... op doesn't represent me.
---
This is actually disgusting I hope everyone who upvoted this gets crushed by a fat fucking whale
---
Oh he's totally loony toons his way to victory, but ash would still be the one kicking ass. no was is ash gonna get killed by the likes of leatherface, even without his boomstick or chainsaw.
---
Sorry to say but I doubt they'll ever bring any changes to this. They'll lose such a large amount of the playerbase and the community is already not big enough.
---
Lots of killers justify being assholes with this.
---
"I got bullied as no perk freddy by a swf a year ago, so now I camp and tunnel every survivor in every game I play."
---
He is literally fat though why are people down voting you it's the literal truth. 
---
yup. he'd rather jump back into the entity's realm than work in sales again.
---
You forget that when a party streamer is played the game never loads.
---
Yeah I faced it all as well but usually I'm fine, Most of the time I don't get camped or tunneled once caught. Try playing some solo matches. SWF is a bad omen
---
Because its fucking disgusting. 
---
People seem easily humored...
---
I agree with you. It wouldn‚Äôt be a good fit. It‚Äôs more of an idea I‚Äôm curious to see how it would be implemented. Such as skins and stuff. Would the go with Arnold‚Äôs appearance, with or without the red eye, or would they go with the robotic eco skeleton. 
---
He's so fucking disgusting I don't understand why people think this is okay. 
---
Meyers
---
why is this thing I made in one minute in piZap becoming my top post
---
He literally said ‚Äústarting April 2nd‚Äù in the post 
---
Nah more like \*DC during loading screen noises\*
---
Just make the stairs bigger lol.
---
Occasionally I run into another black metal Jeff. Usually an award crouching 2 man mosh pit happens.
---
Damn, hairless Myers, I could flick a penny against his smooth ass and watch it bounce. 
---
I dont think any perk in the game is a crutch besides noed. DS definitely was but it's about as shit as no mither now. I think the only crutches besides noed are Moris, instant heals, and all the op killer ad ons. Everything else that was ever good has been nerfed to absolute shit or was never that good. 
---
Pretty big asshole but that franklin perk is just one of those perks. I once chased this p3 flashlight claudette, she syuddenly stood still, I hit her and shortly after she dc'd, tried to keep that item
---
Bear in mind he's in the Entity's realm. Ash HAS been in situations where he's rendered powerless by demonic influence, and this is no different.
---
OMG people don‚Äôt get sarcasm these days smh 
---
Uninstall or ask for a refund
---
Also please don‚Äôt be a tunnler 
---
I hate flashlights. Remove that eye sore bright white screen, fuck it, turn it black, and I'll be fine with flashlight. Nothing like playing at night in a dark room and getting your eyes burnt out of your skull at every damn pallet. 
---
Literally! Although in saying that,I would rather verse 10000 trappers than...ahem...you know *who.*
---
Also pretty much 98% of Trappers run NOED so you know I'm gonna be cleansing every totem I see when playing against him.
---
Yeah it was easy to get, now it's not. I hardly play since I just don't find the game as fun or exciting, normally I play about 3-4 hours a season now unless there's an event and I use to get up to rank 6-7 pretty easily. If they revert it then they wouldn't have to make any changes.
---
the developers should fix the generators before adding another cosmetic lackluster thing again.
---
And i think ur understand of sarcasm is impressive too  
---
The dev's think the moonwalking exploit is okay, and they designed Frank's mixtapes. I wouldn't be surprised if this was intentional. 
---
I can agree. There's something about a solid Trapper that demands that you respect them.
---
Lets start understanding what sarcasm is 
---
Tearing through pallets in half a seconds is not a normal killers chase. 
---
Im being sarcastic.... 
---
Don't forget the absurd amount of posts from survivors complaining about this combo during events with double bp. Apparently I can't play the game the way it was intended, and I must work for them by "farming." Oh no no no can I use my free time for actual entertainment...
---
thanks! i hate it
---
Hit as many people as you can while in frenzy (if the red pulses are around) . 
---
PC
---
You can take advantage of a Spirit's mindgame by running off loops and changing your behavior with her at other loops. If you're using a flashlight you can literally deny a stand still mindgame as faking blinds her and phase walking cannot be entered while being blinded. The only way to enter it is by looking away (which denies the Spirit information and gives the survivor information if she's actually phase walking if she continues to stand still.)
---
A lot of people panic against her by either standing still while she's standing still basically feeding her a hit or they stupidly run towards her husk. Perks such as Dance With Me, Iron Will, Lightweight, Quick and Quiet, Urban Evasion, Calm Spirit, Poised, and No Mither (against Father's Glasses) can screw with her tracking abilities and deny her information during phase walk. 
---
I would change anal beads for her.
---
Art by [Karl von Frankenstein.](https://fineartamerica.com/profiles/karl-vonfrankenstein.html) He also made sexy Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees.

We should get lee. Imagine his backstory. He was lying on the floor waiting to die that day in the hospital when he gets eaten by the entity and hears screams in the far. Just like bill.
---
Sky bound 
---
I'm not gonna get it afterall , it's just Toxic
---
I've felt like this for every killer since clown. All their powers have very little or no counter play. You cant a void clowns bottles at loops. Spirits power is just broken as hell even without ad ons. We all know what wrong with legion. And plague is just anti fun. You either have no mither and are loud as fuck or the killer is just the huntress but she doesn't have to aim as much and is 115% movement speed. They are all really annoying to play against. 
---
Happy cake day!
---
y'all hella frooty 
---
Thank you for the tip.
---
It‚Äôs the wrong cosmetic for her then. 
---
Get better and practice...
---
I have put about 1000 hours into the game since October 2017.
---
I like that idea a lot . It would not only encourage some more perk diversity with specific killers &amp; survivors but would also make getting the adept achievements less of a chore &amp; more of a fun challenge.
---
Personally, I am all for either increasing bp gains overall or modifying perks to be similar to BBQ or WGLF. Perks like No one left behind giving similar post bp gains or distressing giving an extra 100% bp for all categories post match.
---
Still waiting...
---
I can definitely see he has brutal strength on his loadout.
---
Beautiful artwork!
---
It is today, but no confirmed time.
---
Usually the devs release updates and DLCs around 12 PM EST or 1-2 PM.
---
Lol Nea is an absolute unit
---
If I‚Äôm playing killer and have a hatch standoff I just end up letting the survivor go, usually. It‚Äôs not worth my time to stare them down for so long to get a few more bp.
---
I mean even Ash vs Evil Dead makes a big point of him being literally "shoot first and ask questions never". I didn't watch all of the show, but from what I remember the only time he came even remotely close to being defeated was when he was negotiated down to allowing the Necronomicon to be handled by someone else, rather than dealing with it himself, in exchange for having what he *thought* was his ideal paradise at the time.
---
Other than that I recall him having the occasional close call, and losing the rare side character, but other than that basically just fucking up every evil character that came near him.
---
The name is moto moto, yeah you say it double
---
I had to stop running Tenacity in my ‚ÄúIt doesn‚Äôt Mither what you think‚Äù build cause no one slugs a NM guy. I‚Äôm back to running This Is Not Happening cause it impresses people that I can duo a gen with Ruin without regression but they don‚Äôt know the skillcheck is like 1/3 of the bar. 
---
***WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! YEAH, THIS IS WHAT THE PEOPLE WANNA HEAR!***
---
I never thought about this before.... ooo so many choices... (also including killers cuz why not)     
---
Adam x Claudette    
---
Susie x Meg    
---
Nea x David     
---
Spirit x Nurse (forgot names)    
---
Dwight x everybody     
---
Also the best ship     
---
Frank x His mixtape
---
Its the process of chasing someone you have injured with Frenzy then following them without activating a chase. 
---
Usually, the process is either you stare at the ground &amp; follow their scratch marks or you look behind you &amp; follow the scratch marks.
---
It causes the deep wound state to keep ticking until eventually they go down or they have to mend right in front of you. Expect a lot of hate for it.
---
So?

Clearly there is still room for improvement given your opening statement. I have almost 1k hours as well and I still suck in a lot of areas.
---
I always wanted a terrifying,morbid,gross and malformed butcher killer,maybe they could link butcher+chef together which would make some interesting perks + power.
---
This is funny cuz my bf mained both characters 
---
What‚Äôd they say?
---
*Looks at huntress* 
---
*Looks back at you* 
---
‚ÄúFBI OPEN UP!‚Äù
---
Always recover first, then crawl
---
Tunneling somebody off the hook who likely cant escape at all may not be against the rules, but its shitty, and required little skill on your part. It isn't against the rules to tell somebody to go fuck themselves if they beat you in a game of cards. It's also not very sportsmanlike. Why bother playing a competitive game if your going to use the cheapest method of beating your opponent. Why not just play minecraft if you want a game with no challenge. 
---
Because its one less survivor the killer can get bp from.
---
Your forgetting about rev time.
---
Firstly: great art piece (to whom ever made it, GJ)
---
Secondly: he can tier 3 my meat walls anytime.
---
It's not so much that OP wants to take away the BP bonus from the killer, but moreso that survivors might receive one as well, since, if the killer doesn't want to farm, the remaining survivors are pretty much fucked and will die with peanuts for BP and most likely a depip
---
If your playing solo survivor then you 100% have to gen rush. Even a swf will lose if they aren't flying through gens. You do not need to camp or tunnel to win. If you play the game right you will lose unless it's a coordinated swf. Which are rare anyways. 
---
Thing is, I was kicking ass right up until this patch.
---
Hell, I tweeted Tru3ta1ent and he feels about the same.
---
It's like the devs completely missed the point of why DS was a problem in the first place. It punished millers for completing their only objective. This does the same thing. They just don't seem to think of the consequences of multiple survivors running perks in the same trial 
---
This actually got fixed in 2.6.0
---
Not that sub
---
You almost got me, thank god I remembered it‚Äôs April first
---
Sounds confusing lol
---
remember it's not with voice chat. We need that Hand. From the stop signs
---
Especially if he got all 3 tokens of play with your food.
---
Not true, if anything the new sounds have made them louder when injured, since sounds seem to carry more. I had no trouble finding injured survivors when playing killer yesterday. 
---
You underestimate my greed and selfishness as a survivor..
---
When you can buy it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Hey, don't hate. Participate. There's enough of daddy clown for all of us to share. 
---
Welll, there is a subreddit called r/mydbdperks that focuses on that. But honestly, sometimes I don‚Äôt even think this fommunity cares for what I do.
---
Your daily reminder:
---
Fuck Legion. 
---
If you run Whispers enough you'll get the feel for what ~32 meters is in game, so you can kind of guess from there.
---
As far as hitting the shots, like most games with ranged projectiles, it's just practice and muscle memory. I don't think anyone can give you better advice than that because it won't exactly translate into aiming practice. Watching some amazing Huntresses like Ralph and Umbra_bug might help you out though, you'll certainly learn a lot about Huntress anyway if you tune in.
---
It's pretty unsportsmanlike to use the cheapest, least skillful method of beating your opponent, knowing they'll not have any fun playing against you because of it. If you wanna play like an asshole then you have no right to complain about 4 man swfs tbagging and flashlight blinding you.
---
Oh damn thanks! This might actually be my next most visited subreddit. 
---
It's a shame this subreddit doesnt really care about stuff like that,it does come with a lot of work I feel you! They only really care about memes and shitposts (I personally love them too but I love hearing peoples ideas as well).
---
All that time to safety pip
---
Firstly infinite tier 3 increaseses the time need to stalk which combined with tombstone is enormous amount therefore the weste of time in match on rank 1 is too huge. 
---
Secondly due to the fact that infinite tombstone requires add on combo there is no way to shorten that time with add ons
---
Thirdly tombstone slows you significantly which makes you killing ability even more week
---
And lastly tombstone can be easily counter by forcing interactions such ass locker entries, healing, window and palet vaulting and reparing/sabotaging
---
It's how I feel like when everybody wants shirtless Myers but I want shirtless Kate
---
Did you have a ear phone? As a maim survivor I get ear raped every time the killer hit my david, so fucking loud, new sounds are great for killers, but also helped a lot survivors since now I can hear Amanda tea bagging among the map and daddy myers stalking me.

*When everyone is working on the same gen and the killer comes*

Lery's is good for Spirit if you know the routes from that map, I have a streamer who told me : " I don't think I ever lose as Spirit on Lery's. I feel bad for survivors when I play on that map IMO." And I know these persons, there are Croquedead, Space Coconut, Michi, Soren, Spectrobyss and Deppsurel. Never of them convince me that Hag is better than Spirit. They sometimes can be entitled about their opinions and they can become cringe : " how dare you to put Spirit over Hag ? REEEE Spirit is a noob stomper, ( I can say the exact thing about Hag, LUL ), she is add-on reliant ( I saw Spirit mains doing fine without add-ons or just with brown/yellow add-ons ), she can mind game yourself ( aaah, maybe because you are bad at her ? ) and Iron Will and Urban Evasion counter her ( even if it's pretty hard to deal with Iron Will as Spirit, it's not impossible, I saw people tracking people with IW and UE, these perks don't kill her power". I just said that I disagree with your tier list, I don't said to change your list. You want my opinions, I give yoi my opinions. Please, don't become entitled because I think that Spirit is over Hag, ok ?
---
True story. God, the number of times I've been farmed...
---
I had an argument about this with someone once and they said it‚Äôs not reportable because ‚Äújust don‚Äôt go into the basement‚Äù
---
That's fair. Just curious--do you still get a "safe unhook" if the person with Endurance gets hit? 
---
If only this and r/mydbdperks could actually achieve something some of us want: to aspire and acknowledge ideas mighty and low.
---
Ya missed April fools day, no way the survivors would be that nice after a 4k
---
Of course it was a twitch streamer 
---
thanks i hate it 
---
...Okay, this isn't half bad. 
---
Every killer: hey a new survivor 
---
Ash: THIS IS MY BOOMSTICK!!!!!!
---
Every killer: (dies in psychopath)
---
Altogether too pleased to serve. 
---
You must be new. Most if not all of the game is set up in the killers favor.
---
Nvm I just went to check it out and its so dead...such a shame.
---
Tell every single teammate I've ever had this please 
---
Absolutely. If I want to trade time for money and then trade money for bloodpoints that‚Äôs as valid as if I chose to trade that time for money.
---
People with no understanding of economics will say it‚Äôs unhealthy/unfair... it really isn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs making the game accessible for new players with disposable income.
---
we can dream
---
Nope, it'll count as unsafe if they're hit within that time still.
---
The tunneled guy didnt comment :(
---
They're certainly killers that you have to be attentive when playing against. 
---
I respect that
---
Pennywise is nice but Chucky might be too small but it would be cool to see him have a voodoo related ability
---
Joke is Claudette B)
---
I thought it was that you cant see claudette
---
Preach
---
And you must not have developed normal conversational skills. I was just elaborating on what I think the OP meant. Also, not true. When one person DCs, yes, the game will be tilted in the killer's favor.
---
Alot of killers finish a game being as toxic as they can with their camping, tunneling, slugging, BM on the hook and then get t-bagged at the exit then come here to complain "zOmg survivors R so ToxiC" it's higher than you think. OP most probably isn't one of these but they exist
---
It's an exploit that makes Legion somewhat powerful. It will probably be removed with the Legion rework. If you plan on using this tactic then best use;
---
Add-ons;
---
- Stab wounds to make the deep wound timer tick quicker.
---
- Any frenzy add-on that increases speed or duration to allow you to hit more people
---
- Blade add-on to make mending last longer. Will slow down other survivors that you have frenzied. 
---
Perks;
---
- Ruin to slow the game down
---
- Sloppy to makee an easy to follow blood trail
---
- Bloodhound so that you can follow the blood trail more efficiently. Means you do not have to rely on scratch marks.  
---
Wouldnt suggest using moon walking tactics as its a very scummy way to play Legion. Then again it's probably the only way you will succeed against a high ranking team.
---
The most powerful add-on is Franks Mixtape. That's truly op. Hitting someone 3 times with frenzy will down them meaning you can end a chase within 20 seconds. 
---
Not any more
---
Yea i have max bloodpoints and im resisting so many urges right now so ash needs to hurry up
---
/r/woooosh
---
How haven‚Äôt seen this before 
---
He has three like anyone else; Buckle Up, Flip Flip and Mettle of Man. The first one lets you identify someone‚Äôs recovery state by their aura in dying. Flip Flop gives you 50% of your recovery progress in wiggle state. The last one, once you get three tokens from getting hit the next time you‚Äôre hit from injured you won‚Äôt be put in dying state yet anytime you‚Äôre outside of 16m the killer can see you (deactivates next time you‚Äôre in dying)
---
C.J new survivor confirmed
---
Hahaha just spend 100k and get them back up. That's what I do on release days normally.
---
Are you on console?
---
Ffs, it wont come out till tomorrow then
---
What's not true? You even admitted the game is in the killers favor yet hes the one getting the bp bonus.
---
Oh I know they do
---
Nah big bala pc, spent an entire weekend farming bloodpoints just for ash. 
---
I feel that Iron Maiden is one of those perks where the survivors have more fun playing with it than the killer does.
---
I'm rank 2, always got to rank 1 quickly before.
---
Again, I can track, but not without sound. By the time I've found the scratch marks, they've easily made it to a safe loop. Why? Because I don't know which way they've gone without footsteps.
---
Never mind that you can't hear injured Survivors two feet from your face.
---
Nope. This isn't it.
---
Killers can't find you because chase music drowns everything out.
---
When STBFL, Spirit Fury, Enduring, Bamboozle, Monstrous Shrine, Insidious, Unrelenting, Distressing, Play with your food and imperial imperative keeps appearing for nurse, you know you should just give up leveling her up
---
I just read this and then I realized it was an april 1st prank. For a moment I really thought it was real. Well done you got me haha.
---
Say my name girl
---
Why do I feel like this would go well with Freddy?
---
We shouldn‚Äôt assume.  We must know!
---
That sexy, commanding walk though.  Like, he doesn't even have to run.  All he has to do is stand/walk menacingly and survivors flee like rabbits even though they don't even give him powers.  Because they know he WILL nail them if he wants to.
---
It's a scary situation where as a killer you are waiting for the hatch &amp; 2 gens get done simultaneously with one survivor.
---
He thought that just cause he was hooked he got a free pass... he tried to heal a downed person in front of me RIGHT after getting of the hook... 
---
I took a couple weeks off before the patch, but have played daily since. I *know* something's up with the sound, there are loads of people the the forums talking about it.
---
And with amazing tastes.
---
Red circles?
---
I would argue that perk tiers are completely pointless as well for players at devotion level 1 or higher. I get that the tiers are there for newer players, but I don't see many tier 1 or 2 perks beyond rank 10
---
or mori's and instant heals every match.  Its borderline pay to win :/
---
Tbh doctor annoys me more then nurse or billy, I‚Äôm on ps4 so seeing a nurse is actually fun, I just really can‚Äôt stand not being able to sneak around a killer or make a quick get away if I see them coming because you just end up screaming. Then add playing solo and your team can either make it easy or do nothing and make it worse lol 
---
People forget that tunnelling is more on the unhooker than the killer, his objective is to kill, now while I don‚Äôt agree with tunneling since it leads to less points for me, I can see why people do it. Now unhooking infront of the killer is an issue because let‚Äôs face it, we all know what happens after that. I do it sometimes as a survivor because I think I can body block better than I actually can and end up dumpstering my team mate while getting nothing but a little more BP.  
---
When I get camped and or tunneled I take it as my mistake of getting hooked in the first place- and try and fix that behaviour by not getting put into it at all. Sure it‚Äôs not the best 100% way to deal but hey, it‚Äôs something.
---
And Legion is ass without strong add ons. 
---
If in the open puke till there broken. If they are looping just hit them so they are sick and then chase as normal.
---
Its like doc spend too much time wasting ur power and you lose
---
Then again, it could also be that I‚Äôm just bad
---
Joke is about a year and a half old at this point 
---
Ahhhhh nice. 
---
Im too poor for a PC haha. 
---
Seems too toxic anyway but I still get tempted to invest in a cheap gaming computer that I can upgrade in time.
---
Because you're a perverted bisexual time traveller and would slap their butt cheeks repetitively?
---
The rank 14 he clearly tunneled to dead was already in his next game, but yeah I'll say it, he's a fucking tunneling noob.
---
its just the survivors that are bad xo
---
That was probably their last round anyways since they said they went to bed, probably wanted to see how long it‚Äôd take for the guy to just kill them
---
Bitch, this originated here.
---
Deathgarden isn't even out yet. If you did any research you would see that the devs are essentially remaking the game with progression, unique characters and a completely different game play. 
---
Gimme some sugar baby
---
Thank you bhvr for getting rid of these shitty 500 ping hosts
---
Omfg, as a killer main, mettle of men and flip flop seem op. I often just let survivors lay there while I hunt down others that are nearby.
---
You can get a pretty decent PC for about $500 USD these days, check out /r/buildapc
---
Pebble honestly should stun the killer if you hit him with it
---
in a test build you could close the hatch as the killer, then all gen, were powered.
---
Well, if you get slugged Unbreakable might just be better because hooks are usally all over the place.
---
So, great skill checks would progress 6%?
---
Had a similar thing happen the other day with LF on purgation temple. A meg t bagged at the hatch in mid chase and then used a key to jump in. I grabbed him mid jump and the hatch closed on his swf buddy waiting to leave with him (to be honest I didnt know that was how it worked so I found it quite funny). His buddy ended up getting out cause I dont mess with hatch stand offs. The salt in that post game chat was amazing.
---
it fixing gens means you are bad then ok. Otherwise I'd like to see your skills against Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape
---
This is the ideal male body and you just don't want to accept it.
---
I‚Äôm so proud of my work ü•∞
---
Wow I have no idea, thanks for the info!
---
Immersed survivors kill more teams than killers just accept you lose sometimes and its beyond ur control
---
Eww, didn't even occur to me. Guess I'm going to focus on just jooking.
---
Everybody will run this perk for months if unchanged and nothing else stronger comes in.
---
It's a strong perk, worse effect than old DS but highly more consistent to pull off.
---
It's an ignored hit with a free sprint and killer CD, make it 4 because there are 4 survivors and you get a win against any m1 killer.
---
The aura thingy won't matter against experienced survivors.
---
Because it's tracking 2 minutes. 
---
I feel you brother/sister xD having a somewhat clown phobia myself, that image wasn't too pleasant to see
---
Would this work with No Mither? I need answers
---
Legion isn‚Äôt that bad
---
Normal is just an illusion. What is normal for the spider might be chaos for the fly. 
---
If you have the balls to sit still while a fucker is rushing in your direction to kill you and you also manage to hit it with a pebble, you deserve a 1 sec stun
---
Good. This is how it should be for every game on every platform. The populations of Asia and North America are large enough that there is absolutely no downside to keeping people in their respective regions.
---
Mettle Of Man will be ridiculous when more than 1 survivor has it. Expect killer d/cs
---
Well, if you are camping she just played safe xD
---
Even if you wasn't. It is better choice 1 scaping thru the hatch than 2 dying. 
---
Without the grind, this game would feel overwhelmingly like there is a lack of content. One of the reasons I've invested time into the game is that I want to get teachable perks from various killers and survivors.
---
It's so dead barely anyone does remember that it even existed. If they work on it that's fine but currently it's DEAD.
---
Ok...this was a day ago...?
---
Stun at pallets just like flashlight save
---
Will be like ds stun ‚Äî completely useless if killer has enduring.
---
\*as Dwight's soul makes its way to heaven\*
---
I HAVE BEEN HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOKED
---
Maybe you missed the part about make your choice. I'm already more than 40 meters away. And good luck finding someone with a 16 meter tr
---
A dead game is one that no one ever plays and is abandoned, it's not fair to say that about do because people play it and it's far from abandoned. 
---
Killers have camped for 3 years straight, I think their "oehh but we're gonna camp if you do this"-basic bitch threats are just not very effective anymore.
---
Can't you see the bliss in Wraiths eyes?
---
He isn't facecamping because hes toxic, after all these long years he's finally found Waldo and is not letting him out of his sight. No longer will his classmates mock him!
---
Well Mettle of Man does have potential of being a strong perk, but just like pre-change DS if you can't capitalize off of it's effect you will be downed rather quickly. It will suck if alot of people start using it since this will increase the number of killers that can counter it, like Hillbilly and we really don't need more of them playing.
---
Flip-Flop sounds fun, but it falls in teh same category as Unbreakable and Tenacity, meaning it's situationaly great, but i can see some people trying some experimental strategies, like quickly distracting the killer until you are hit while the downed person is recovering, yeah it's gimmicky as hell but it's just a thought that passed my mind.
---
Buckle UP will also be situationaly good but it gives some much welcome information, on it's viability i would say it's a run it until you get a good play kind of perk.
---
It gave me a chuckle üòÇ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
I have never seen anyone say this unironically. That and the knowledge of the game's nature was far less developed at that time.
---
Yes , just After they downvoted mine just because i gave my opinion , but hey its Reddit 
---
Fuck off with your gayporn.
---
&gt; by that time we will find another game
---
good luck with that
---
It‚Äôs not annoying enough that They actually need to hinder survivors‚Äô stealth capabilities for it
---
Behavior: Fixes DS so it still remains a viable perk and has an effect without even being used however not infuriateing to play against.
---
Also Behavior: a perk that grants an extra hit is a good idea.
---
It's bill...
---
Other people tbag at the exit gates so holding the game hostage is okay?
---
Interesting. I find it just tedious af. It‚Äôs more just like disappointment when I get trapped. Sprit prayer beads though... jeez. 
---
Eh? Unlike most i hate using those arrows as weapons. Maybe stop assuming that your opinion matters so much that it hurts someone over the web?
---
I think flip flop and Buckle up are meh but mettle of man seems like it could be so good. Run it with iron will and maybe dead hard if you wanna stay injured after your 3rd hit or just run it with object so at least you can see the killer too and take them for a loop while ur team does the gens. 
---
Stand alone I couldn‚Äôt think of any killer
---
Paulie seems like a legitimately nice person. However, I really don't like most of the people he plays with so I'll only watch his news vids and updates. 
---
i plyed as the best character in the game so far. legion
---
Would be cool but imagine legion hitting everyone then nurse downs them. 
---
Now I'm really hoping for a double blood point even soon. The Plague, Jane and now Ashley... I NEED MORE BLOODPOINTS!!
---
It's alot weaker
---
getting triggered by a joke nice
---
I love the idea but the playerbase complains enough as it is without adding more broken buggy content to the mix
---
This idea is being posted here once a week, at least. It's not new and not very exciting one.
---
Dedicated servers won't help with low fps on survivors side. And for a lot of killers, too.
---
That's not a problem with survivors being silent, but a case of chase music being too loud.
---
that is true. I guess if we could figure out a way to make it fair, since the map would be larger would be fun to see if they could coordinate enough.
---
I don‚Äôt even understand why I need chase music to begin with, it‚Äôs very distracting and not fun even for the sake of immersion 
---
Just had a round with someone called Quit301 and he did indeed quit during the loading screen, leaving us to get mauled by the trapper
---
If you‚Äôre reading this, I hope you fall down the stairs 
---
yea true... I guess just would be fun. I like larger party ideas.
---
Any reason why
---
There‚Äôs a man who know how to EASILY end looping .. NURSE!
---
He'd be tunnel bait
---
Survivors do get points, you get 5000 survival points, like an escape. The only time you don‚Äôt get then is if the killer hard dc‚Äôs which will be fixed with dedicated servers
---
haha, I don't read all the posts here.. so my bad didn't know people were referencing this idea so much, I thought I was special LOL 
---
He's a killer with training wheels. You cant lose a chase unless your IQ is below room temperature. Which isn't fun for survivors, who cannot win a chase.
---
That face is killin me
---
Use your lunge to move.
---
Learn when you can hit someone with frenzy.
---
Judith + Mirror
---
If I am not wrong, we got 5k point for surviving the game if Killer DC right?
---
And to be honest , the DBD dev listings to the player and community, it is kinda unfair for you to say they didn't because they don't do something you want.
---
If they did it, I'd be thrilled. I've always wanted to try that kind of gameplay since they first released DbD but I guess we shall see what happens 
---
The game is not necessarily in favor of the killer gameplay-wise, until someone DCs. I don't really understand the point you are trying to make. Especially not in that tone. It seems very pointed.
---
For every 9 games that hex:ruin won you you'll have one of these bitch, try not using crutches and you won't ever have your precious overpowered totem destroyed.
---
Iron Will so you don't necessarily need to heal?
---
Better still bitch about it on reddit though for that sweet crybaby killermain karma.
---
True i forgot about Iron will 
---
yeah people get triggered by weird jokes sometimes
---
The aura exposure to killer will only proc if you heal yourself, so if you stay injured and they won‚Äôt see your aura 
---
Honestly tho, I‚Äôve played against Legion a couple times and really don‚Äôt see what everyone what everyone is so mad about it. I haven‚Äôt won every match against them, but I have won a couple. Haven‚Äôt really gotten tunneled much. The thing that always gets me are the DCers who ruin the match before anything happened just because it‚Äôs a legion. 
---
you used a yellow BP offering?
---
As long as you play a fair amount of both, you understand more on both sides. The question after that is, why ruin someones whole experience just for the possibility of yours being a little bit better?
---
How often does that happen? I have only seen knockout used by new Bubba players that don't have anything better to put on their other perk slots.
---
Holy shit! I want it now!
---
my favorite hag main (space coconut) runs knockout in most of his builds so that‚Äôs where i got the situation from. but yea it‚Äôs really uncommon atm.
---
I like the object idea!

It's more about the remaining survivors not getting a bonus when one or more of their team mates DC, leaving them with more gens to do, with less people
---
Aaaah, where is Omega Blink Nurse or Prayer Beads Spirit ? They have the strongest builds in the entire game.
---
Who tf is Jojo btw?
---
Gonna be a boring while for killer mains
---
Its because i think everyone knows how to bait a hit from hillbilly or LF : stay close to a pallet or Windows and they will m1 , the true counter to this perk is huntress , and its the only one meanings that the perk will be used 
---
This toy should be pinned at the top of the sub at this point
---
I think you misread what I was saying :)
---
I think Fantozzi did that picture. 
---
Honestly I wish there was more reason to run Tenacity since it's actually an insanely useful perk. But as it is currently there's little reason to Crawl in your Crawl when you can just run Unbreakable and get yourself up. (And even then Unbreakabill is bad.)
---
Ash's one leaked perk that lets you turn recovery into struggle bar might make Tenacity and Unbreakable better, but I kinda doubt it.
---
That's a spicy meatball! 
---
Trapper is honestly one of the most oppressive Killers in the game with one of the highest skill ceilings despite his very simple skill floor.
---
It's a shame that he's so weak and buggy.
---
Fair, but just in the show I think his scrapes with death are fairly more numerous than you give credit for. Just in the first episode he and the others would have died without the last minute chainsaw hand save. He would've potentially got taken out by a possessed doll if not for Pablo. I don't want to spoil anything past that, but there's a fair chunk of times he would've lost if not for his team, or some last minute turnaround. If you need, I could DM a list. Point is, he has a thing for close calls and overcoming them.
---
"Hatch is best mechanic in the game." - No one ever
---
I don't remember that being the case before?
---
I play duo as well with my bf and lobbies vary. The longest we've waited is like 10 min but with the other matchmaking it was like 1-2 min
---
Hes referring to survivors dc
---
what the fuck have you just brought upon this sub
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs possible with controllers, I can‚Äôt do it on pc with my Xbox controller :P
---
Mettle of Man seems shit. Someone said to me that doesn't count Lethal Blinks hits, Phantasm hits, Hatchets hits, Chainsaw hits, Spirit post phase hits or Ambush hits, so this perk, in that current state, it's too situational over others perks.
---
The only 1 of those 4 I dont see frequently is bill and even then its like every 25 games
---
yep, can confirm. This has already been posted here and is a popular post.
---
He hit consoles today too?
---
Suckle his toes
---
Credits to him then
---
Na man. I‚Äôm gonna continue to play like I always do. 
---
That‚Äôs sums it up and my heart starts beating the same as does the one on the game as he nears! 
---
but you still dc just because you're playing against a killer. you havnt even been downed and you're dcing. that's part of the problem. 
---

What‚Äôs wrong with cold dirt and joey‚Äôs mixtape?
---
I thought we were mad about frank‚Äôs mixtape
---
IMO noed is useless now. yea it still gets kills, but any kills after the gems are done done get you pips anymore anyways. gone are the days of, "gotta get my safety pip." i got a 4k w/o noed after the gems were done because of altruistic teammates and still depipped. the new system sucks, but it makes noed no longer viable for people who care an ranks. i dont even get it from the bw anymore because it doesn't matter. 
---
Uncle Kenny got the cure for what ailes you *bom chigga honk honk*
---
Sorry up front but I love to talk about her so forgive me for the pillar of text
---
Perks:
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse: you can see more of your surroundings and you can catch them easier in unpleasant spots which is your bread and butter
---
Whispers: just a generally decent tracking perk and you need those on her since its one of her major weaknesses
---
Brutal Strength &gt; Enduring: since survivors are usually away throw-happier when getting chased by her
---
Discordance: you can vomit on both of them and decide which of them you want to chase while the other one will give you corrupt eventually
---
   
---
Add-ons:
---
Anything that increases Vile effectiveness is always great (Emetic Potion, Infected Emetic and Vile Emetic), the faster charge (Rubbing Oil) is never a bad choice either and in my opinion a mildly underrated effect is the faster cooldown (Healing Salve, Potent Tincture and Incensed Ointment). Increasing the duration of corrupt purge isn¬¥t necessary since the base time is already long enough, but if you like the Clown/Huntress-playstyle then sure go for it. Her red ones both are pretty bad as the Black Incense gives you tracking for people you are about to down anyway and the Iridescent Seal only really does anything when gens start flying and you are getting your ass handed to you either way. Oh, and really important STAY AWAY FROM THE APPLES they¬¥re bad trust me they are literally useless and you basically give up a slot that could be used sooo much better, every killer has some spoiled apples in their add-ons and these two are literally the worst apples.
---
Playstyle:
---
Usually your tracking perks give you a general direction on where to go and as soon as you hear a gen pumping charge you puke and go towards them, if you¬¥re lucky you will find somebody hiding in a corner in which case BODYBLOCK THEM, seriously this is one your key strats that gives the plague so much power as you can puke on them until they get broken and don¬¥t get a speedboost and you have no cooldown. 
---
Out in the open try to track them with your puke-stream and if they start running towards you back-off and keep spewing. Every bit of puke you can get on them while casing gets them closer to a widdled down healthstate with no distance gained from you. 
---
If you see more than one person at once try and just spit on both of them since even when you don¬¥t chase anybody they will still cleanse themselves and give you corrupt. 
---
When you have corrupt... just spray and prey, the hitboxes are just really wonky, but eventually you‚Äôll get them. 
---
Tips and Tricks: 
---
When involving the basement corrupt is basically LF-mode and is definitely recommended before going back to it.
---
If you don¬¥t want to take a chase or if you can¬¥t get a line of sight on the survivor, shortly spit on a gen or pallet and do normal killer stuff, every bit of infection can build up to a cleanse -&gt; corrupt or broken -&gt; down.
---
Don¬¥t force yourself on one Purge-mode, learn to play with both of them and handle them equally and DO NOT leave a chase for corrupt it¬¥s not worth it.
---
Well if you read this far, I hope you at least got some idea on how to play her. Remember a killer can be played in multiple ways and especially the Plague, just find the playstyle that fits you best, but until then I wish you the best of luck with our Babylon Vomit-queen Ardiris.
---
don't know why you're whooooshing...the joke isn't going over their head as they're just correcting someone else
---
Is this some weeb shit 
---
It's most definitely the case now.
---
Legion looks like a survivor and and I don't know why this is still annoying me but DAMN why won't they just f off! This game is meant to be scary
---
Less BPs won't work.  A friend of mine has max BPs and refuses to allow killers to hook her when she's death hook.  Some people just like to spite others.
---
They definitely had me. I almost turned my TV off.
---
I would quit playing if they added shirtless Myers
---
Is this an actual poster or something?
---
Playing fine on console, as long as I'm playing killer. Takes some time to find a match as a survivor
---
Short answer: No
---
Short explanation: The game isn‚Äôt big enough to split the community up between two game modes. 
---
Team Rocket?
---
She is boring to vs.
---
Ouch, so how to you go about doing the Legion adept then? Not only do you run the risk of disconnects if you use good addons, you also have sub-par perks to work with.
---
Ash Williams 
---
He doesn‚Äôt whine though. He critiques the devs and puts his input out there in thought out videos and arguments. Literally his video on this contains 0 whining and is just his opinions on the new perks.
---
The sphere drilling people's eyes
---
You forgot 
---
Fupa lord: Your marvelous girth is no match for the killers. When you take a hit you gain Fupa stacks. At 4 stacks you are immune for the rest of the game.
---
"Its the chub and tuck dude"  
---
Who is this?
---
Pc will be 7pm norway i think. Probably then for ps4 aswell
---
With Frank's Mixtape you stab people 3 times and they are down, only 2 Frenzies are needed.
---
With Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape, you don't even need the second Frenzy. You just stab survivor, close the distance before the Frenzy is over, cooldown is almost instant, and you down them.
---
Yeah I don't think so this time
---
He has one of the biggest (no fat shame) on youtube.
---
I find it soooooo hard to do with a controller, I‚Äôve done it maybe like 3 times ever but most of the time I go so fast it‚Äôs just like spinning in place lmao 
---
I got a friendly chat after using Doctor :D . You can only one up this if you had a friendly chat palying Legion.
---
I feel you on that, i haven't played too much in red ranks but i spent most of last night at rank 8 just getting safety pips all night because  the killers couldn't catch anyone for us to get more points. just seemed silly. for me i dont mind playing tryhard when im in ranked and close to rank 1, but i have a lot of friends that are new and want to learn how to play. i hate playing with them tho cuz im always a high rank and they get to play with the worse killers with no perks so its just not a fun experience  for them. so i either dont play with them or ruin the best part of learning dbd ya know
---
 Necktie, nectar, nickel...noodle?
---
Hmmm buy Kate
---
i guess what im saying is having a casual mode might be nice so i can play with newer friends that dont wanna have to deal with killers at my rank going try hard
---
Fought a good one tonight.
---
Found the ruin totem on The Game in a small corner with barrels. Got trapped. Teammate freed me, I work on breaking the totem while Trapper is distracted with a hook. He comes up for me just as I break his totem, I get downed as I can't escape past him. He picks me up and drops me and as I get picked up I think he doesn't have a mori, a second time, I suddenly get mori'd.
---
I almost screamed.
---
It changed in the new update 
---
I don't play Overwatch, mind 'splaining, Lucy?
---
The Tall Man from the Phantasm films played by the legendary Angus Scrimm. Go check him out.
---
Even the straightest man wants shirtless Myers 
---
He has only one boob tho, even if it's rly huge
---
Oh yeah, those too are a pain. Michael has the potential to do it with certain addons and so does Doctor, at least their perks aren't Wraith tier
---
Maybe Kenny
---
I would swiftly quit playing if they allowed BP to be bought. I‚Äôm sure a lot others would too. The quality of life can be improved in much better ways. 
---
"Doing gens, you?"
---
This makes me wish i was Jared, 19
---
Try making your jokes funny
---
They only leave to do that now because you can‚Äôt hop off. If you could hop off, it‚Äôd just become another, more boring, variation on the Hatch standoff.
---
Console?
---
Just curious, did you go watch the original Nightmare on Elm Street series, or just the remake? I ask 'cause the Freddy we got is remake Freddy, obviously.
---
Scene from Army of Darkness, mini ash's scattering as real ash tries to fight back
---
sorry, i didn't know. i only asked the owner if i can post it and he agreed.
---
What are those perks?
---
How about Bill with just a beach towel and his beret?
---
Its the chub and tuck that got me.
---
Ash Williams comes out today. he has some cool cosmetics, and he has three perks that if I remember correctly, one is kinda useless (Don't remember what I does, but it requires people to be in the dying state to use it), one is okay, but it would depend on the situation (allows half of your recovery meter in the dying state go into the struggle meter when grabbed by the killer), and one is excellent (when injured, the perk activates, and the next time you would be put into the dying state is ignored, but it decreases how fast you can heal, and can only be used once). If that's not your jam, then it would really just depend on your playstyle. 
---
LMAO
---
It's hopefully more like the Demise of the Faithful, which was around 1 pm EST or so.
---
I think it‚Äôs you in fact that doesn‚Äôt understand sarcasm... 
---
That's the spice! I forgot the sphere needed to stab first and then drill away, my bad.
---
That overwatch hero is called Mei and her main function is crowd control. She can freeze enemies and put up a wall to stop line of sight to either block damage or troll. 
---
People associate her with the devil because of how "uncounterable" she is and how unfun she is to play against. In reality she's actually a very low tier hero that is very easily countered by half the roster. 
---
Not sure Legion and Mei are one in the same. In Overwatch Mei is only a problem to bronze players, or in DbD terms rank 20, but isn't remotely a problem for above average players. Its seems like everyone in DbD hates Legion regardless of rank
---
You'd rather have a big indian corporation as the most subbed channel in the world?
---
You have that ability. Just play and don‚Äôt worry about your rank- bingo. Bonus is the player base isn‚Äôt fractured even more.
---
Hey, don't knock it until you try it.
---
imagine watching rick and morty
---
Do you have any pics of his cosmetics?
---
Yeah, Feng is probably the next best option after Ash if you're going for perks. Lithe is a very good exhaustion perk, and Alert is decent. The other DLC survivors are kind of trash when it comes to perks, although Kate has dance with me which isn't bad and goes well with lithe and quick and quiet.
---
I buy survivors for how they look, not their perks, so if it were me I'd get Ash, Feng, and Kate.
---
Your not wrong there TBH.. i wonder if DBD would ever Go Free to Play.. when they do free weekends the games goes up to like 60k players.. if they did that and just made money on DLC and cosmetics then maybe there would be enough players for it  
---
I'm still new to DbD but if there's one thing I know like the back of my hand its Overwatch. Mei is only a problem for low ranked players and no one above gold ever has a problem with her. In fact, if an enemy picks Mei in the higher ranks then that's very welcomed because its basically a free win considering how easily countered she is
---
My understanding is that Legion is hated by everyone, regardless of rank, so the two aren't very relatable imo
---
I did
---
Buckle Up is bad, Flip-Flop is mediocre, Mettle Of Man is good.
---
you arent wrong, but because i play in red ranks when i play with my new grey rank friends we get like green and purple killers, they arent too much for me to handle but for my friends with no perks, its not fun playing against full build killers when they only have 1-2 perks ya know. not really a great learning exp when they get insta caught and camped on first hook
---
open your eyes and your ears
---
BHVR must‚Äôve been planning this for years!!!!!
---
It says in his description "Clown is big boned, NOT fat." Therefore clown is not fat
---
We Payday 2 now, boys
---
That was my inspiration
---
Ooo I like that idea, I‚Äôll add it to the list!
---
There‚Äôs nothing you can do but not get caught. Unless there‚Äôs more punishment for camping, people are still gonna do it.
---
Deep fry his ass
---
They're all considered 'paragraphs', as it's just a Survivor + perks.
---
What's seen cannot be unseen ¬∞_¬∞
---
The meme is supposed to be a shocked face
---
Not literally electrocuted
---
Like, someone just did something shocking
---
Legion and huntress are the only killers I can fairly 4k with.
---
On the others I have to be dick because I'm not good with them. 
---
I would assume so, but you would basically have to get downed 3 times with regular attacks before it procs lol.
---
Ohhh I read the perk description wrong, my bad. Still though, Ash seems like a really cool survivor to have in your collection, I suggest him just for the Mettle of Man perk alone. 
---
Mcote: *adds legion*
---
***GODDAMN IT GIO***
---
Big muscle Trapper &lt;3
---
You're reading way too hard into it, bro
---
It has to be pinhead. Must be.
---
Plz
---
You're right, my mistake. Just woke up
---
I will mori you if you make another joke like that
---
God damn it cloud
---
Right? I wanna run it with dead hard, adrenaline and havent thought of a fun 4th perk yet
---
thats kinda what i was thinking to, i know i PC there was a bit of a Hacking problem whenever they do a free weekend so they would have to Update their Anti Cheat, but if they could get that right i would imagine there would be tons more ppl playing and we would have way better que times for sure! i know ppl that got every skin when the cos store open on dbd, thats like 700$ easy. i dont even know what that would be now. im sure they would make their money back if they did
---
Doing the math, it'd be somewhere around an hour and 10 minutes. rip.
---
Hey! I resemble that remark. lol  I'm a streamer (very small) and don't behave like that. I'm first to gg and usually give compliments when I'm outplayed. We're not all asshats. lol
---
I guess just work on your tracking, theres always room for improvement
---
At least you can get to a pallet with that, there's room for counterplay. With franks, he can get you regardless of a pallet
---
I could make a snide remark, but I'll be blunt instead: that's the point. Literally the joke.
---
That‚Äôs a whole lotta time for not much payoff. Could have gotten a whole extra game in but hey persistence pays off in some way. 
---
&gt; then it wouldn't matter what your ping to the killer is
---
It kind of would matter. If the killers ping to the server is bad, your game will still be laggy when he's close to you.
---
I've occasionally made great use of it. Especially when you get the killers who refuse to take their 3 sacrifices and risk a hatch escape. You cover a lot more ground and can lose them as long as they don't have deer stalker or whispers. Crawling through the corn on coldwind is probably the best lol
---
Tenacity, unbreakable, leader, and urban evasion for normal stealth. Really punishes someone who leaves you down.
---
I would love to see add-ons for trapper that do stuff like speed boosts when traps trigger or are set off. Something to reward you for setting traps. The time investment at high ranks feels like hurting yourself by using your ability.
---
You don't have bones in your stomach. 
---
Yeah very tough for new killers
---
Oops, I sabotaged it. Could you reset it for me please?
---
This + "EZ KILLER" leads me to assume that twitchy thinks the goal of this game is to make sure that the other side doesn't get a pip... thats just sad.
---
servers aren't a cure all.
---
The problem is people with bad internet playing online games. You can't fix that.
---
Even with dedicated servers, if a killer has bad internet....your game will still be laggy as the server tries to match your actions with the killers. Servers would be slightly better but would not instantly make everything peachy roses.
---
I mean that extra hit comes after getting hit 3 times with regular attacks. Almost half the killers have ways of damaging you without regular attacks. grabs still count as well, no to mention certain ways of making you exposed.
---
Unless the killer leaves you, you aren't activating this until after you get hooked at least once. This goes in line with other perks we have already.
---
It really depends on how pressing the next round is - I usually play solo while eating and waiting for friends to come online. As long as they're offline, I don't mind just watching stuff.
---
Deliverance, maybe? 
---
I say it so much, I need to make a tshirt that says "Go away, bird."
---
Jesus Christ just run Unbreakable wow
---
Boxers and sandals with socks, pizza box (SHIRTLESS), helmet and glasses can stay.
---
Those add ons shouldn‚Äôt stack imo. 
---
MOM still will (holy shit thats a bad acronym).
---
I am killer fail on loopers. That‚Äôs definitely me.
---
Usually those ranks will camp cause they bad, you can build an anti camp build like deliverance/kindred
---
Correct for me since it never gives me "safe unhook" when they get hit while borrow time active. Sometimes never counts me tanking hits as "protection" even through im right behind rhe injured person.
---
Cringy Comment
---
F
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind that, maybe after a 3rd they‚Äôre banned for a few hours or something. The dcs in this game make me want to have a bleach enema.

He smacks you with his balls
---
Huzzah! A man of quality!
---
Yup, I completely agree. Clowns just completely unenjoyable to play against imo.
---
Spirits main strategy is fucking standing still, please tell me where the skill is involved there.
---
Legion is well, legion.
---
And plague is seeming more and more unenjoyable the more I play against her.
---
I know but 18 downvotes makes me sad
---
if you dc a lot you do get temp banned, but again you have to dc a lot
---
Detective Tapp is also confirmed non binary
---
Yes, they should. 
---
Most add-ons for older killers are terribly unbalanced or outdated and i think they said in a stream last summer they are planning reworking most of them like they did with trapper's and wraith's add-ons
---
The constant DCs are really making the game less enjoyable. Definitely need to punish players for doing it and this would probably work, plus its not the end of the world if you disconnect on accident if your internet goes down. 
---
ALL of the genders!
---
It's why she hides so goddamn much.
---
Watch the Ash reveal trailer to see the blinded screen
---
Lol Facts man. You could say the same for NOED, it's TWENTY NINETEEN MAAAAAN.
---
Or just do the same as litterally any other game, small ban that increases the more you do it, it‚Äôs so stupid that a survivor will just dc as soon as they get downed and just hop into a new game seconds later
---
ü§î
---
My Bloody Valentine is the least votes one on there but at least I got to vote for it at all
---
Yeah but it's a lot faster than Frank's Mixtape. Because you are wasting less time you can easily afford to break pallets, and then it's over. I've never got less than 3K with those addons
---
I‚Äôm gonna suggest we make it harsher than just that, once they hit three DCs within three hours just slap them with a one hour ban 
---
No, it would be the same way they currently do the chaser emblem penalty. Doesn‚Äôt it not occur if the killer is in chase or another survivor is within proximity of the hook? So they already have the things in place to do what he‚Äôs describing.
---
Downloading it now on PS4 too! Doesn‚Äôt look like the actual DLC is up in the store yet though
---
maybe its  a garbage legion and all 4 of you make it out instead of assuming the worst and abandoning your team mates : D
---
You get my drift
---
19 GB rip 
---
As it should be
---
It‚Äôs not his, it was taken from here
---
Oh alright thanks :)
---
DLC will be avaliable in 1h on all platforms!
---
Watcha on about, everyone is sweaty in this game
---
try deleting and restarting, it's actually much less than that 
---
no
---
I play legion as a point farm. Stab as much as possible, hook 1 time each, chase alot, etc.
---
Not an obvious hit-the-gen farming arrangement, but definitely try to not ruin the game for people.
---
Same as tier 3 Myers 
---
Almost as good as playing with bubble wrap.
---
I tried it yesterday because I wanted to show my friend and it was the dirtiest thing I've ever done in my life. 
---
I don't often laugh out loud when I see something funny on the internet, but this got me so damn good.
---
Say you have dead hard, the deliverance save could be huge
---
NOOO I don‚Äôt wanna kill any of TWDG characters! I love them all! Especially Clem!
---
~180 MB download, ok cool ,fair enough. 
---
Go through the now-standard "EAC failed to verify some files blah blah blah" that occurs after every patch.
---
"3 files failed to validate and will now be reacquired"
---
1.2 GB download. 
---
Fucking hell why do you do this to me game?
---
Have you considered not tunneling?
---
Clem is my dream girlüëÄüëÄüëÄ
---
Mine was 3.45GB on xbox, no clue why yours would be that size. 
---
He's not available on the store yet.
---
Hag as well, when you step on one you get that *sweet* heart attack 
---
Hags traps will jump scare me if I play survivor. But I imagine I make some spooks when I play scratched mirror Myers or beads spirit
---
ouch, sorry, i'll delete it then
---
You‚Äôre a reposting cum guzzling karma whore and you should be ashamed
---
myers ew 1 and hag traps
---
So... Why did they nerf Thanataphobia? It was going to get a huge buff, then they decided it was overtuned so they made it *worse* than before..?
---
Same for me, did you try to reinstall the game?
---
But he used party streamers. What do you do?
---
Its only annoying if you play like an asshole yourself, so I think its fine.
---
You can buy him with cells
---
Trapper makes me scared I'm going to trap myself so I'm always on the lookout, but without fail as soon as I don't pay attention for .5 secs I step in some random trap üòÖ
---
New here, why is that scary?
---
Don‚Äôt buy him from in-game store if you want the exclusive cosmetic.
---
Canceling the update deleted the game :/
---
It's stbfl all over again. If you eat a decisive without enduring you can pour a cup of fucking coffee before you get control.
---
I thought I had weird taste, well shit just got weirder.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I agree. I haven‚Äôt run into DS often since fewer people are running it and I tend to spread hooks around when I play killer, but the stun was really short even without Enduring. It went from being a really strong perk to really weak; this change may be a happy middle ground where it‚Äôs a situational, but still useful, perk.
---
100% noooppee.
---
The new Decisive only punishes tunnellers. I never really tunnelled prior to the change so I never have to worry about Decisive Strike again.
---
Shit you not if clem or lee where added into dbd
---
I would flip my table in joy,
---
While i do **agree** she may be an odd ball choice, but y'all guys remember bill when we said he was an odd choice?
---
yet he somehow fits?
---
I don't see how it wouldn't work with clem.
---
It's super easy to run into the survivor again within a minute without tunneling 
---
I can do it on PS4, but not as long as PC players. The trick is to mimic the rhythm of the wasd keys so I've found. Don't shake your analog stick too fast.
---
I knooow, I have enough cells but I must wait
---
I did, I would too.
---
&gt; Fixed some instances of infinite loading screens.
---
They say as I'm currently stuck on an infinite loading screen unable to even get into the menu screen.
---
Killers like Billy and trapper would not really be affected. However to other killers like pig or wraith, that's 3 hits they need to down someone, 4 if they use an insta heal or get adrenaline, and 5 if both an insta heal and adrenaline is used. Not to mention all 4 survivors can use it, and it activates after you hit someone 3 times, so anyone who has been hooked at least once at best has this second chance perk that can be really abusive to use, especially in 4 man swf. 
---
ikr
---
Everytime it pops up it's like the first time all over again. OP. You done good. 
---
Where is the obligatory semi-hidden Myers tho
---
I agree with that DS change
---
&gt;Jerry Beans
---
Nope, there's bean soldier [too.It](https://too.It) has 1200 atack if I'm not wrong...
---
You're on PC? 
---
I'm just suggesting what I'd like to see in the game man.
---
You can have a peppermint
---
I dont see the Steam page of the dlc tho ?
---
Infinite Loading Screen patches! Whoo!
---
lmao that'd be nice
---
Its even more free than DS in my opininon. DS was free as shit, but it had a skill check. Mettle of Man activates withought uou needing to do anything. Although, I dont think it will be as strong as prenerf DS.
---
Also, killers rely on survivor mistakes. A killer with 20 hours can mind game on a pallet just the same as a killer with 200 hours. A killer at high ranks is usaly better at forcing mistakes. But if a survivor is experienced and know what there doing, then they wont make the mistakes and the killer gets no where. The 20 hour killer and the 200 hour killer.
---
I mean in the game, is ash getting released?
---
Is it on Steam yet? Can't seem to find it.
---
I mean chances are he knew you had make your choice and thought you would do that. It honestly sounds like he did a smart play to me at least 
---
My favorite ugly bastard Hentai.
---
It isn‚Äôt available just yet but will be soon.
---
Is Urban evasion faster than basic walking? 
---
Probably not, I never really had an issue with how decisive was before (besides the occasional DS when there‚Äôs only one survivor left and they find the hatch because of it) honestly I try to not tunnel survivors if I can help it, and because of that I really never ran into any big issues with the perk... I feel like they probably made it to weak and now they‚Äôre compensating for it. 
---
Not every killer will need to run enduring... it‚Äôs probably better to just eat the DS and use a different perk instead...
---
Not available just yet.
---
Umm, every character that is "apart" of copyright has store cosmetics. Every character that is *a part* of copyright doesn't. 
---
Modern Problems require Modern Solutions
---
&gt;It's super easy to run into the survivor again within a minute without tunneling
---
Let them be. These people probably play killer once in a while instead of every day for a few hours. Even calling others "asshole" for simply playing the game. 
---
I hope they continue to play DBD and watch it slowly die with their precious stupid devs. 
---
I can see ash in the store  available for 500 auroc cells, underneath of that it simply says "coming soon" (currently). 
---
Wasn't planning on it.
---
"It will attract advertisers onto the platform" and you really want that, huh? 
---
Yea I know. Was more just pointing it out.
---
Myers or the pig
---
As a killer, I always thought it was kind of stupid survivors can‚Äôt at least get their struggle points. I know it‚Äôs not much, but they are in a way being punished for surviving the longest. 
---
What‚Äôs the perk?
---
Exactly. Plus, I'm not sure if there's invincibility for the animation of unhooking yourself, but if there is then that would make it way better.
---
You could allways do a reverse google search to find the original creator
---
But nahh lets credit a instagram page that steals memes

IIRC it was because if legion
---
Are you just asking to be downvoted? Because it's definitely working
---
Nice to see they are finally finding and fixing the causes of the infinite loading screens. üôÇ
---
makes sense
---
Glad to see a DS buff; it sucks getting farmed by a killer and them not getting punished because of Enduring.
---
Do you play much Killer?
---
Updating on PS4 right now so I think it is coming now
---
It will be available in the steam store too :)
---
In going to be that guy right now.  If that‚Äôs how you truly feel about the dlc, then just buy it. It‚Äôs most likely five bucks and if you don‚Äôt have that kind of money, you have bigger things to worry about rather than spending time on a game and its subreddit. 
---
Oh. I think I may have accidentally. :P
---
I play Legion just fine (no tunneling, no camping) and everyone has a fair game. I honestly don‚Äôt see the issue with them tbh
---
I would opt for Lee or Molly
---
Lee is a badass and canonically Dead
---
Molly is pretty cool, likeable, has an indeterminate fate but would be a better option than Clementine for the sole reason being I wouldn‚Äôt kill Clem.
---
Molly could probably have some neat perks too. Like that kick she uses to get lee to the floor.
---
Yeah this is honestly an MLM-level scam and anyone who buys Ash right now would fall for me telling them that gullible is written on the ceiling.
---
so basically if everything aligns perfectly and you have all the right perks and items ready to activate against the right killers at the right time then it is powerful.
---
You're banking on the killer being a completely M1 killer, having an insta heal to waste on yourself during chase, needing to get hit at least 3 times, it being near end game, and the killer chasing you while the last gen is close to being done for all that to go off. While I won't doubt that scenario will happen, I doubt it's going to be super common...
---
Underrated post of the day.
---
funniest dbd meme i've seen
---
thank you. so much
---
Yeah, that sucks ass, really. They were left on hook until they only had a tiny bit left as well, so two hooks. Left them alone for a bit but I'm pretty sure they were sort of crouching around a lot. 
---
The trial after a good trapper match I am still paranoid about stepping in traps.
---
Even when I'm the killer.
---
Teir 3 Urban is the same speed as walking.
---
I'm just laughing. Look at the depths they'll go to to protect their precious DS, Killlers. Didn't take them one month to buff it back up again. 5 seconds (probably closer to 6 seconds in reality).. unless you run a perk. And if you do run a perk, 2.8 seconds (probably 3 seconds in reality).
---
Don't want to get hit with it? Let the unhooked survivor go. Yes, you, as a killer, should let the unhooked survivor go.. because that is what killers should do naturally and that's refuse to hook and kill.
---
Let them go free even if you see them after.. 49 seconds, even if they run right in front of you and t-bag to taunt your inability to hook them right away. Even if you are chasing someone else and the previously hooked survivor run into your line of vision. Even if the exit gates doors or open. Even if you hook someone right in front of said opened exit gates. There are no stipulations given for it. You're just suppose to let the person go free for 40-60 seconds.. YOU'RE enjoyment, hook count, points, end game, and emblems be damned.
---
Because it's not fair to hook someone fast. You're suppose to let people go to extend the game so that they can heal others more, do gens more, and rescue others more. The more people that remain in the game for longer.. the better it is for you as a killer. This is their logic.
---
Pantless Dwight is what you're looking for.
---
I've had killer matches when *I* want to hide in a locker...
---
Shouldn't Head On have 5 seconds too then?
---
I don't think anybody knows for sure. It will be whenever all three console's stores update.
---
The first perk, Close Encounters, sounds *wayyyyyy* too specific to ever be of any use. I personally haven't been Mori'd since I started playing again a few months ago. Moris are pretty bad now.
---
Ransack - Idk Quentin already has one for taking items from chests and it's renowned as one of the most useless perks. Getting an item from a chest a few seconds earlier isn't really going to be game-changing ever.
---
Survivor's senses - why do you need whispers when there's a terror radius?
---
No no no. Im not in that mindset at all. Im just saying that in some scenarios it doesn't matter how experienced the killer is because a survivor is mostly safe. A good huntress or cannibal can force survivors into easy to down situations. A good trapper/pig cannot.  It doesnt matter how experienced you are with pig, if there looping the middle of macmillan estate with the row of 8 jungle gyms. Most of the time in these scenarios its up for the survivor to vualt the wrong window in order to get hit. 
---
Also, are we calling in MoM? Lol.
---
And he definitely needs to be P3ed--it's only canonical that he'd be drenched in blood.
---
I've done this as Wraith before, I had alot of fun but I let the survivors escape in the end and if I ended up with more than 1 survivor I would let the one who's been down there the longest leave first. Its really fun to just sit and wait for someone to fall into the trap.
---
Yes
---
He said up above that he's an Xboxer
---
Back when the game first came out trapper was the OG killer.
---
No one saw the potential in Billy yet. And people thought wraith was OP and unfun. But Trapper...
---
Trapper was the scariest jumpscare killer for the exact reasons you described. You never felt safe. He was everywhere. He could end chases immediately if he chased you into his traps. You couldn't even infinite him because he'd just trap them up early. You had to pray you had a tool box to sabo his traps or it was all over. He was the main reason sabo jakes became a problem.
---
But that's why I always played him. He was so much fun and so good at terrorizing survivors! For someone who enjoys fucking with people and messing with their heads, he was my first love.
---
Herding people into your trap gave me such glee in anticipation. Hearing the obscurely placed trap in the other side of the map go off gave me a huge endorphin rush. I would constantly giggle everytime I mindgamed someone successfully, it was THAT much fun.
---
Nothing instilled terror like seeing leather daddy coming for you across the cornfield after you got caught. Struggling to get out and failing again and again. Oh God, come on I'm running out of time you stupid tra-OH LORD HE COMIN! CMON YOU STUPID TRAP, OPEN!! OH GOD OH FUCK OH-AAAAH!!!
---
Hehe. Good times...
---
I played against a legion once who was named "sorry legion daily"
---
That's not very cash money of you to say
---
Yeah, as it is right now any exhaustion add on basically removes your perk. Previously you could still make use out of your perk if you survived for long enough.
---
For some reason he said a specific time in his stream. This is what confuses me because I can‚Äòt find any information about it :/
---
That‚Äôs what I want to know as well, if it‚Äôs something I don‚Äôt care for I‚Äôll just get him with cells.
---
The fact all 4 survivors can use this at the same time and I'll be punished for having hooked them at least once makes it more common and that's my greatest fear atm. Even old DS had you be the obsession to get to use the perk instantly, this one only has the survivor get downed once to work. 
---
Nobody knows yet.
---
Amazing. Good ol' PLAG.
---
If I run into a survivor that just got unhooked less than a minute later even by accident, I still don't tunnel. I just turn around and look for somebody else.
---
Watch Damnnohtml on Youtube. He is an amazing killer main and has a great series on handling loops as killer; has helped me a bit in that regard.
---
If you want Bloodpoints, pick up Doctor as killer. Unnerving plus his natural shocky terror radius will help you find survivors while getting you those extra BPs. Farm Doc is actually the most fun I have in game I think.
---
Maybe my problem is I'm not immersed enough? I always get caught out near no jungle gyms and get kinda screwed there.
---
Groovy
---
this is beautiful 
---
Apparently the actual DLC package itself will include an exclusive cosmetic.
---
I mean, chases are super short if there are no pallets left. With windows, you can predict and bodyblock those
---
False, there are pretty many potatoes in high ranks too. At least it was like that before
---
Iirc enduring only worked on the DS stun itself and not the wiggle out stun so it seemed longer than it should have been. But I guess maybe what they are trying to say is that the whole cycle of the stun+recover is all one thing now and enduring affects the whole cycle.
---
GrooüÖ±Ô∏èy
---
Fingers crossed that it won't just be slightly different like Jeff and Jane
---
I‚Äôm not the best killer but as a survivor I‚Äôm not too bad. Honestly I found playing with friends helps. 
---
Tutorials can only teach you so much but when you‚Äôre playing with friends who are lower level you kinda learn off of them. 
---
Can i get a screenshot of what he looks like normally? I haven't gotten a good look at it
---
..and no Spirit audio bug fixes. Typical. 
---
I'm a killer main, but if you're really worried can't you just slug them and come back in a minute? Added benefit that you might stumble across someone coming for the heal when you return.
---
Really, that's only a problem if they have both DS and Unbreakable.
---
And then it's really only a problem if DS goes back to being run as often as it once was. Since it's been nerfed I've noticed a lot of survivors have just dropped it (or at least never activated it with me). And I've not even been bothering to slug and run, except for one time where I got a 'feeling' they might be running DS because they were a teabagging flashlight tard.
---
One of the biggest DBD streamers who plays SWF for the most part even has a friend who purposely throws himself at killers after being unhooked just so he can use DS and this was before today's buff. By doing this the person that killer was chasing goes free and he goes free shortly after by hitting DS. 
---
Instead of forcing survivors to play smarter and unhook only when its safe or having the unhooker distract the killer so he won't go for the unhooked, they are punishing killers and they have to put up with survivor's stupidity because of crutch perks. 
---
I'm not expecting anything mindblowing if the last few DLC's are any indication. Then again, maybe since it's licensed. (Laurie and Quentin's alt outfits were later turned into the exclusive ones for buying the DLC rather than cells)
---
That happened to one of my friends as well. She lagged out while being chased by the killer. I just hate when something like that happens and the killer messages you just to talk shit. 
---
You should never buy any survivor/killer with cells. They all have cosmetics that you only get from buying from your platform store. This has always been the case. Laurie, Tapp, Quentin, etc
---
19:00 is normally the time the steam shop updates it‚Äòs contents. For Eu West at least
---
‚ÄúNurse is far and beyond this, as all you need is an extra blink and a little extra distance, and you can just drool on yourself en route to a 4k.‚Äù
---
And blink range knowledge, lunge range knowledge, decent tracking, knowing how survivors path, when are they going to double back or vault or throw down pallets, map knowledge... yeah a extra blink is all you need. I have a suggestion. Give a newbie player three blinks nurse and see, if they will get 4K every match. Spoiler: they won‚Äôt.
---
Leatherface gang rise up! 
---
For real, I've started incorporating Deerstalker and slugging tactics into every killer that can't handle groups these days. The DS change was good in that it adds more play styles, but it's still an annoying ability. I'd lick to see a buff to killer abilities generally in order to keep the gameplay interesting and to reduce the damage a survivor perk does to a killer. This way Survivors can still fell effective while not obliterating the killer and making them feel weak.
---
Crashed for me and now I can't get back into the game
---
The exclusive cosmetic is his chainsaw
---
&gt;If I run into a survivor that just got unhooked less than a minute later even by accident, I still don't tunnel. I just turn around and look for somebody else.
---
Why would you do that? This is basically throwing a game since the other 3 survivors are powering through gens and you even allow the 4th one to go back to a gen immediately. 
---
Wow. This is like the time I was at the exit about to leave, I had just did a totem that happened to be his NOED and was almost out. Just to be grabbed by the Myers and killed right in front of the other survivor leaving. 
---
What killer are you playing as? Maybe try another. They all have pretty different styles. 
---
Regardless, I find I suck with most survivors till about level 10. By that point I understand the mechanics and have enough add-ons and offerings to help me out. 
---
Watching the Case Files on YouTube helped me a bit as well, but there's not one for every killer.
---
Guys. Don't worry. It's safe. I promise.
---
Is that confirmed, or just a guess?
---
Nope. Decisive Strike is way harder to pull off. Head On would become overpowered.
---
New cosmetics plz
---
Very unpopular opinion; I thought Carl would've made a cool survivor after he got the axe on the show. But any TWD character would be so welcome by me. 
---
and then you're like, "FUCK HE'S COMING HEEEEEE'SSSSSSSSSS COMING!"
---
I do the same, sometimes I feel like I'm gonna cry after the 3rd failed escape attempt from the trap.
---
Enduring still is great against it. I am really pleased with the change.
---
So, I just went back and looked at the PAX image and looks like we may be wrong: https://i.redd.it/dj4pjw53bxo21.jpg
---
The two purples are the ones in the store, the green is probably his Prestige, and then there's the exclusive for buying the DLC and then the default. :(
---
Ruin.
---
Honestly I just really want the Executioner from 5. I think it would be awesome trying to hide from him but you hear him dragging his giant axe on the ground getting louder as he gets closer.
---
Also I‚Äôd love to have Jill in the game too lol
---
Do we know the new achievements yet?
---
I can‚Äôt find the game on panel
---
That's how DLC trophies tend to work, at least one is made easier by using one of the new perks.
---
Idk, Billy can patrol both exit gates pretty easily. 
---
Oh I agree, im stating what every Legion hater thinks. 
---
I've played through far worse than audio bugs 
---
I wanted Ashy Smashy that hard, I spent another 5 bucks on it.
---
Oh yeah! Today as a survivor!!
---
Cries in bing bong :(
---
His belly button looks like one of those rubber duckie mouth holes.
---
I play on ps4 and took a break since just before the Clown came out. I was thinking of jumping back in soon, but I‚Äôve seen comments saying that console performance was decreased and matchmaking is messed up. Is this just general bellyaching or should I stay away?
---
 I am horrible at breaking LoS and being able to sneak away. I sometimes get lucky with some bomb-ass door jamb jukes but that's about it for me. I always get found out in the middle of a damn field and then I'm screwed. :P
---
My main survivor is Dwight with Prove Thyself, Urban Evasion, Bond and Small Game (because no one else seems to run it.)
---
I lack Feng so no Lithe, and I do have Balanced Landing and Sprint Burst that I can swap out if I'm not being a fully immersed Gen Jockey.
---
[Check this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b8kzn6/the_new_trophiesachievements_added/) :) 
---
Oh :(
---
I dunno man, then just take the risk of DS. 
---
I would love this so much
---
How much ?
---
Exactly! Bbq and hex ruin IS a pay2win scheme. They should never make significant balance changes with perks. Bbq pretty much forced every competitive killer main to buy leatherface. 
---
Idk about ashs perks but the game does have a slight pay2win scheme. 
---
What if I swallow chicken bones whole?
---
Wouldn‚Äôt we all

---
I knock them down and move on.
---
$4.99 US
---
That‚Äôs not what they said, don‚Äôt be obtuse. Having some fun while not being toxic seems to be the aim of their game.
---
GROOVY
---
So they want us to buy the dlc twice, nice scam
---
They always drop it for Auric Cells first because that's raw revenue. The separate DLC is a cheaper and more complete purchase while you'd need to buy a shitload of Auric Cells in order to get Ash and all his unique outfits.. 
---
..and people aren't patient. Cannot wait. Cattle ready for milking.
---
Ah I just posted the price 5$ usd
---
what the fuck have you just^done
---
The game keeps saying the game files have been modified and then it shuts itself down.
---
The wiggle thing makes sense. It gets mad annoying and even fucks with me during other games that require the stick on run
---
Maybe by the heat death of the universe? idk
---
i really dont even know what perk he is talking about
---
You have no bones that belong around your stomach. 
---
You think **this** is unplayable? You know *nothing!*
---
weird cannot get it in NA just yet on store but cannot buy it
---
Wrong. ScottJund and Zubat are probably the two best streamer killers out there, and both will sometimes slug to keep pressuring and not pick survivors up right away. Neither runs a slug build.
---
What if I had some surgically added?
---
Decisive Strike isn't any stronger than Unbreakable and Deliverance which is a good level for it.
---
It‚Äôs out on Xbox too
---
haha i do that exact same thing! i love seeing after game messages like "who the fuck puts a trap in the middle of nowhere!?"
---
Just waiting for PC now :| Do you know what the exclusive cosmetic that this pack comes with is?
---
Were his perks leaked?
---
Having 6 Claudettes bodyblocking two killers all with purple flashlights would mean unless you're slugging you wouldn't get a lot of kills, gens would be done too fast  having 4 people work on two gens or 6 people working on 2 gens while the killers chase 2 survivors does not sound fun for killers, bigger maps mean that the killers have to patrol a lot more space so you would almost be playing two games put into one or two killers tunneling one survivor at a time by trapping them from looping. Trapper would be a nightmare and are there 10 totems? 10 gens to get done? 2 Hollowed Ground 2 NOED 2 Ruin and 2 Devour Hope mixed with Legion and Nurse. That will be fun for the killers.
---
And the masses will come and buy them.. for some inconceivable reason..
---
thnx
---
Yikes another promise to never be fulfilled. 
---
Perfect! Exactly what I was looking for - thanks!
---
Ashy may be the slashy, but now he's gotta help Ash stop other slashy's from stealing his title...
---
Where do you go once you get to the page? I can't find anything called "Twitch challenge GameOn panel"
---
Same here, make sure capslock is on, it's case sensitive
---
I started slow as a killer. It took me 4 or 5 matches to get a kill, but it was probably because I wasn't using the right killers to start (Nurse, Huntress). I switched to Trapper, and I think I 4 K'ed two games in a row. To start with, I'd definitely pick a killer with a higher movement speed, and soak some BP in to get perks which help you locate survivors. Whispers tier 3 is good, Bitter Murmur, BBQ (if you have Cannibal). Once you get the hang of it, you'll start using other perks (or at least I did) because you'll have a good idea where people are going to be.
---
Getting better as killer will also make you better as a survivor. You'll know all the little tricks that people are playing on you, and you can start using them too.
---
I think a big part of being a better survivor is knowing the maps. After you start learning the possible layouts, it gets a lot easier. Then you just have to pay attention to where the strong tiles spawned for your game. When you are sitting there doing a gen or cleansing a totem, look around and see what's next to you. Plan your escape route while you're sitting there. Don't venture in to the open areas at all if that's where you're getting caught. If you have the Curtain Call DLC, Kate's Windows of Opportunity perk is super helpful for anyone trying to learn the maps.
---
I have to say I learned the most from my SWF group, and watching other people play. I like watching Puppers on youtube/twitch. He's great in chases, but he doesn't do anything fancy. He's not out to juke a killer with a fancy 360. He's just great at pathing. Now I'm proud of the times I get camped on the hook after a long chase.
---
How you getting on with ash bud? I am on ps so only just got him now.
---
Why would you do that? 
---
Just a guess. It is actually a recolor of his default hand
---
He got into Pay Day 2, we can get him in DBD
---
Ash'll cost the same price as Leatherface and isn't leatherface the same price as 500 cells?
---
To Cosplay Clown, who indeed is big boned and not fat.
---
Checkmate!
---
It's a glove cosmetic. His basic one with a different color palette
---
+1
---
If you feel like you have to gen rush then you have no skill. You need to start learning to play better. Ask for tips if you need but the idea that you can rush your objective but your opponent can
---
't, because they should be worried about *your* fun, is the most entitled shit ever. You shouldn't have to escape every match to have fun btw. 
---
im confused.
---
glad, but confused.

The description is:

Just as technologically advanced as the original, but with a groovy new look.
---
That's the prime directive with the new ranking system and now this DS change: survivors are entitled to make bad plays and you have to play along or get penalized. Unhooked before you have a chance to leave the hook? Better not punish the bad play by hooking the injured survivor again. 
---
With the last patch yes!
---
Leatherface didn't come with additional outfits. 
---
You're just saying that he's an abnormality with a bone attached to his stomach then. That's even worse than being fat because he most likely will have a disease.
---
I guess yeah
---
You do you, I prefer winning games.
---
What he wore a puppet wearing a puppet wearing a puppet wearing a chainsaw[?](https://youtu.be/8KjORka7f-s)
---
It's kinda hard to hear him over the music though or is it just me
---
Last time I wiggled out was just the last game before the patch got published. What a timing.
---
And they didn't even get to pip! Gorsh!
---
Or just wait a couple hours(if that) 
---
It definitely is hard to hear him
---
&gt; I mean, you could try slugging them and/or going after the other survivor that just saved them, they'd probably have borrowed time anyway.
---
Already answered why slugging is not a valid strategy in high ranks. How about this.. how about the unhooked survivor actually hide before healing? Nah.. let's just put everything on the killer. He's suppose to play stupidly because the survivor is incapable of playing smart and must have their hand held.
---
&gt; Going after the savior would probably slow the game down more anyway because while you're busy tunneling the one guy the other one has already run away to work on a gen while healthy. If you chase the other one then you've probably got 2 people off gens and possibly a 3rd one looking to heal the injured one.
---
Your definition of tunneling is a made-up term and not what tunneling is. Unless I am proxy-camping you and coming straight for you irregardless of the circumstance and to the detriment of my overall kill count then I'm not tunneling you. And if I find you within 60 seconds when I'm not searching you, I'm especially not tunneling you and you're just a bad survivor. I shouldn't handicap myself for made-up rules of the game. I'm trying to kill, you're trying to escape. I'm not trying to adhere to some made-up code of honor agreed to by survivor mains. I'm trying to kill, as many people I can as fast as I can.
---
And it absolutely does not make sense to go after a fully health person over an injured one. Again, illogical. Unless I have make your choice, NOED/Haunted Grounds has activated, the injured survivor is a good looper or is in a spot with a t-wall/safe pallet, or I have a one-hit down ability as killer. Any other circumstance and it's illogical and to the determent of your kill count and ruins your chance to snowball.

I really like Doc too. I mostly use whatever extends his range. 
---
With any killer though you gotta learn the mind games. Think a step ahead and go to where they'll be. Don't just follow hoping for a hit. Sometimes you'll lose them, but sometimes they run into your club and flail like an idiot and it's great. 
---
You'll get there. Just keep at it.
---
You have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. You moron. 
---
Why even have paper in Rock, Paper, Scissors if scissors can just beat it?
---
Anyone have some ideas what "exclusive item" means like are they adding a new usable item (like medkits or something) or is it a cosmetic for ash you only get for buying him from steam and not from the in game store
---
Just speaking from personal experience, if a gen doesn't get done before a person gets hooked, there's a good 3 in 5 chance everybodies gonna die. When the team doesn't do gens quickly, even bad killers can snowball and kill everybody. Personal skill doesn't matter much when you're the only one doing gens. You can still 4k as killer without just tunneling people constantly. Infact if thats all you do you'll probably lose (although if you're the kind of player to focus down 1 guy the whole game your probably use noed too, so maybe you wont lose).
---
If you don't gen rush as survivor, chances are you lose. You can not tunnel anybody as killer and still kill everybody. I do it all the time.
---
[Context.](https://old.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/b6kp9d/every_lobby_ever_when_the_evil_dead_dlc_comes_out/)
---
Yeah, I can see that working. I would still be sad for him, but he would fit the scenario better.
---
I would classify myself as a survivor main. I used to only play killer for daily rituals, but over the past couple months I‚Äôve been slowly leveling up all my killers so that I can actually play that side and not get completely owned. Personally if I hook someone, I immediately go and patrol gens, unless I obviously see someone in the area. I know some people may not agree with my play-style, but I actually want that survivor to be saved, because I want them to enjoy their experience in the game as well, and be able to get points. If I happen to run into the recently unhooked person without finding anyone else first, I‚Äôll usually ignore them and continue my search, or down them and leave them on the ground so they have a chance to continue playing, but still getting some points for myself. There‚Äôs nothing worse than being a survivor who gets hooked and never hearing the heartbeat fade away while you‚Äôre hanging, only to be unhooked right in front of the killer because they won‚Äôt leave, just to be re-hooked a couple seconds later. 
---
Try verifying the integrity via Steam. Sometimes that shakes issues out, especially if you ever went to the PTB.

If I'm legion and I play streamers it means I have his daily to apply his effect to 4 survivors and I'd rather just farm to our hearts content because I know legion annoys a lot of survivors and honestly I'm not very good with him because I only play him for dailies. Also if I run out of streamers and have the daily I still just want to farm get my daily done and move on.
---
This is so sad nobody cares about autism. 
---
Sneks are the only decent thing you have said. 
---
I didnt let them know i was farming. Still chased and they still did gens, i just hooked everyone twice and then slugged and let them escape
---
You know Mettle of Man has that whole downside of the killer being able to see your aura when you fully heal up? Pretty sure that lasts the rest of the trial. I mean, not healing up can counter that but that's dangerous too.
---
What audio fixes? There explicitly is a note about plagues audio: " Misc The Plague audio improvements. "
---
Sometimes, it takes double the man power to wield such a powerful, and beautifully knitted chainsaw...
---
so i wont get tunneled off hook 
---
I'll jyst agree to disagree
---
Go to the twitch stream, type "!gameon" in chat, then scroll down the the little leaderboard panel
---
By all means go ahead. But DCing is pointless. Its not like Legion can't be beaten. Its not like Legion is a garenteed 4k.
---
It's his robohand but blue.
---
My nephew has nephew and I visit all the time, he just had a bday and is doing great thanks for caring ü§ó
---
They finally fixed desicive strike and bring out what could arguably be worse ? Curious if insta downs count towards the stacks. What do you guys think ?
---
And Steam is down for me =( Darn 
---
I fucking love that they added this as a cosmetic. I'm honestly buying all of Ash's sets the moment I get him. ~~Except for his recolored pants because lol $5 for recolored pants.~~
---
Cosmetic. They would never make you pay for a usable item.
---
Hoping the exclusive is the chainsaw though that‚Äôs probably wishful thinking.
---
Figured it to be too specific though the best I figured with it was something involving Clem's relation to escaping/avoiding death in some manner.
---
I didn't know for the second one with my lack of survivor pool and research in DBD stuff though to know such is a downer for sure. Still, intent was something based around being a survivor from her own form of zombie apocalypse.
---
For that one, I admittedly just threw out an idea and forgot about that part, maybe something involving being able to more accurately tell in what direction the killer is based upon you being in its terror radius rather than simply knowing how close or far away they are and that's it.
---
Suggestions might I ask on fixing up on these ideas?
---
Thanks for the fast reply &lt;3
---
Nope. Just until you go down again.
---
Wasn't me who said it :)
---
Does he talk in game ?
---
That STILL doesn't change anything happening in this clip
---
Same here, dude. My left analog will turn left randomly now. Totally blows
---
Not even letting me open the game after I verified it. Saying it can't connect to online services.
---
Ah, didn't know that. Well, still, it has it's risks
---
Yeah I can't hear what he says because the music is louder. 
---
With that said, as soon as I got into a lobby I can hear him say "What now?!" more clearly. 
---
I hate myself, but not as much as the teammates I get
---
It's weird to be glad to see a DS buff but yeah, now that it's an anti-tunnel perk stronger is better.
---
The fact that the chase music is too loud, making footsteps inaudible.
---
This is more a question for BHVR, but, maybe one of the other lore nerds can answer this in case I missed it.
---
What's up with light burn not affecting the spirit? Like, you can burn an invisible wraith or blinking nurse because they are "interacting with the spirit world". If that's the case, then shouldn't I get to burn a phase walking spirit as well?
---
This plus dead lol
---
Can you name anything on this game that gives someone hook immunity for 60 seconds? Do you not realize how powerful that is, knowing that you can do anything to the killer and play as recklessly as you want and not get hooked for it? Do you not realize that every second is precious as killer and that you don't want time wasted?
---
I really don't its conpairable due to the fact its basic attacks that are required and the huge draw back of being seen 24/7
---
Thanks
---
it's not showing up on the steam page, if you search ash in the search bar it will show up
---
It says basic attack
---
You do realize that after the perk has been used, the survivor has to remain wounded or you will ALWAYS see him when not in a 12-16 radius ? This mean either a faster chase if you find him again, or just an easy find if you just see what he his doing almost all the time...
---
Also, getting hit 3 times means that you already should have hooked him once, or that you lost your chase at least once.
---
Also, not working against one hit kill (noed, chainsaw...) So yeah, can't see this being as bad as DS honestly.
---
Yep the hype is real my friend !üòÅ
---
it's steam currently, i just got D/C after my match ended (afaik)
---
Right, blame the people and not the shitty mechanics
---
They don‚Äôt it literally says ‚Äúkiller‚Äôs basic attack‚Äù, it won‚Äôt be very useful against most killers.
---
Facts I agree 
---
Get hit 3x by a normal attack (Legion doesnt count) and then you get a gimmicky Dead Hard that doesnt let you go over traps or knock you forwards though without an exhaustion cost.
---
You also reveal your aura to the killer when healing back up after being hit at least 3 times.
---
Once you are downed it no longer works.
---
Added bonus of making you the obsession.
---
Go watch some Killers on youtube, any loop in the game can be countered if you play it right.
---
Hillbilly, Leatherface, Huntress, Plague, Legion, and to lesser extents Michael and Trapper will never see this perk even come into fruition if they play well. Exposed perks and grabs help neuter the perk as well.
---
If the perk does go off. it would be most commonly when they are injured on at least 1 hook. The survivor then has a choice to either stay injured the whole time OR heal up and let you know where they are until they go down again.
---
I know the perk is good, I won't deny that. I'm just saying that it isn't a guaranteed win like people are making it out to be and there are tons of factors that come into play that can make it feel useless or not even be used in the first place.
---
Well I think they just use it out of habit. Still,I clearly struck a nerve, what with -28 karma on that post as of now, but very few comments. It's like Reddit DC. 
---
Not out on Steam yet :(
---
3 dcd the post game chat was non toxic 
---
I love using tar bottle and Longwood dye. It makes the traps almost impossible to see on any map with a dirt floor. You can put them out in the open and most survivors wont see them
---
No Spirit fixes!? The dev's said the glass breaking sound when she enters her phase was a bug.  Loved the mind games with her...
---
If that were the case, they wouldn't have told us it was coming later today
---
Insta downs dont count,only if you are hit by the basic attack, but it could possibly work against NOED, Make a Choice, and Devour Hope
---
At rank 12, I see survivors D/C against the doctor a lot for some reason. 
---
This loop isn't counterable if a survivor will back and forth(Unless you bloodlust, and even then you risk not getting a hit, which wastes a ton of time) - This has nothing to do with balancing issues. This leatherface was just determined to do something that was very unlikely to work, and is not the vocal majority nor the reason survivors were touched
---
Ahhhhh no way. I know he's out on dbd store but not sure if there's a price difference.
---
Ah yeah wow. that is a crazy coincidence. I'll tell you how it went :P
---
Game starts we're all in the main like building, Leather face comes up and somehow knocks two down with his chainsaw and one insta-DCs the other DCs about 30 seconds later.
---
The third one and I tried to do the gens but failed since there was 5 gens and only two of us ): We did get one gen though ):
---
Damn it is... Only difference is one gets medical and the other allows totem breaking speed x.x ...
---
As for the second one, yes, though best thought process was, after replying to a previous person, that could make it where you know a bit better in what direction more or less where the terror radius is coming from when you enter or are made to enter it.
---
Ok I obviously misunderstood you, I assumed you were talking about someone unsafely unhooking in front of you and if you decide to go after the unhooked for an easy kill then the DS is on you, and slugging would still work there because you down them then go after the other one. But here is another crazy idea, go find another person after you've hooked someone and don't worry about being unhooked, those 2 are off gens and you can go push a 3rd off gens.
---
Still better than the 80s pack head for Adam.
---
Fuck the devs
---
Trapper. As someone who almost always runs a lithe DWM combo, I am reliant on vaulting to escape a chase. Trapper is literally my worst nightmare. 
---
Let's see how long it takes to appear on the shrine
---
Glad I'm stuck at work
---
That actually makes way more sense.
---
And a few people have jumped out of a seven story building and lived I'm sure. Because there have been a few exceptions to the rule doesn't make the rule any less valid.
---
Besides, I said consistent success. They'll trying to make it so that all killers leave every unhooked survivor alone for 60 seconds on the assumpting that they might have DS. They're not letting you know who has DS off the bat, so they want you to assume everyone does and alter your play style.
---
Wow I‚Äôm being downvoted for explaining a video that‚Äôs a new one... and lol the only killer that‚Äôs ass to play on PS4 is nurse. ;P so your saying people don‚Äôt DC against legion unless it‚Äôs on PC? Nice.
---
Yeah, I feel like I just have to, it's too good.
---
~~But recoloured pants isn't as bad as having an extra 3cm added onto your flat-top~~
---
How do I delete someone else's comment?
---
DLC becomes avaliable -&gt; steam goes down
---
Clem perks
---
Keep your hair short - You have learned from past experiences how to avoid getting grabbed by walkers. Whenever you would be locker grabbed or grabbed while doing an action, lash out at the killer and stun them. This can only happen once per trial and the perk is deactivated after this effect
---
Survival Instincts - You know just where to look to get what you need. When within 8 meters of a chest, you can see what item is inside. at higher ranks see addons as well
---
Stay low, Stay quiet - You know how to avoid the walkers without being seen. When crouched and not moving for 4/3/2 seconds, your whole body slightly/slightly/moderately darkens
---
Everyone defending this is imagining the best case scenario against average solo players. What happens when you Spirit walk near someone but don't get a Grudge hit for some reason? What happens when a SWF all have this and know how to loop on a map like Coldwind with 5000 safe pallets?  The aura reading will do little against comms. This perk is absolute bullshit. 
---
XDDD haha imagine being autistic I'm so glad I'M not autistic
---
$5 for 3 inches of hair. Shop smart: shop S-Mart.
---
Does anyone have a rough time when this will come out as a pack and not with auric cells 
---
By ‚Äúbasic attack‚Äù they must mean a standard M1 lunge. And honestly most of the time you‚Äôre going to be hitting survivors using the killer‚Äôs power like hatchets, chainsaws, EW3, etc. I don‚Äôt see this being as much of a nuisance as the old DS. 
---
Lick his ear hole
---
Thanks BHVR üôÑüôÑüôÑ ^^^/s
---
I'm judging from my former personal experience in red ranks as Legion with those addons, so, yeah, it's not like I could change my mind on how it works
---
Same here, what a great timing!
---
It‚Äôs out now.
---
Well at least you now know BHVR didn‚Äôt do this because you sound triggered
---
Humor is subjective, as is what you'll cringe at. If you cringe, just move on. If it's at 300 upvotes, it clearly didn't make the majority cringe, so no reason to throw your salt bucket in there. 
---
DBD is inherently fairly stale in content. After the first hundred hours you've probably seen most of what there is to see, and another legion complaint post isn't going to keep this reddit alive. DLC's are far and few between as well.
---
Would you rather there be 1-2 posts average per day that were just discussion, with mixed upvotes/downvotes?
---
Now I want Lee in this 
---
Or just have any patience.
---
This is me too. Oftentimes I‚Äôll walk over to a hook and wait if they‚Äôve just been shit on all match. It‚Äôs the least I can do y‚Äôknow 
---
On any stream?
---
Did this just happen? I got disconnected from the game because of Steam being down.
---
Tell him to eat shit Johnny!
---
That's not a real risk. Having your aura revealed after a full heal when further than 12 meters is no downside. Nobody heals in the open knowing that their aura will be shown. And even if the killer sees you and can get to you, why would they? You are full health and possibly at a pallet. If anything it's more like a mild annoyance
---
Groovy 
---
Imo that should stay, it's not really a mindgame if it's 100% guesswork whether or not Spirit is phasing.
---
its easy because when u find teh hatch, wait for killer to down you then get a free escape
---
Your logic works for the 1 million Killer Perks that make it easy to track Survivors.  Survivors can completely outplay Killers only for a variety of perks to basically auto reveal their location
---
Probably, usually they wait a bit before posting it
---
where‚Äôs kate and feng? i‚Äôm gonna go cry now 
---
I'll give an updoot for it and cause Clementine is awesome.
---
The devs had one job and that was let ash say groovy during the game god damn it
---
Having to be hit 3 times means you're probably on (at least) your second hook by the time this perk even activates.. And once you heal yourself, you're aura is shown to the killer for the remainder of the match.. It doesn't seem like THAT good of a perk, honestly.. I mean, obviously the killer mains will continue to bitch until it's nerfed to shit anyway, but there are so many unfair advantages on either side, at this point, that it really doesn't matter. The only thing that really seems like it would counter would be an end game build (specifically NOED) which could really fuck some people over, I suppose.. But if you're relying soley on a single end game "crutch perk," as they say, you've already lost against a decent group of survivors anyway.. Also, expect to see A LOT more moris, from this point forward.. The devs always only consider lower rank play, and there's so many cry babies on both sides, that their job of making everybody happy has literally become impossible at this point.. Higher rank players most likely won't even consider this perk an option.. Guess we'll have to wait and see.. 
---
This will be closer to a meme perk than a meta perk. Within 1 week or so nobody will use it
---
Hey hey can i just say i see your user flair and I love it
---
Does he actually have voice lines?
---
Like always, a useless boring and cheap recolor huh? Shame.
---
Level up Claudette first, 
---
Haha just joking around, it's a pretty cool picture though, reminds me of a cool one my family had hanging of all the Stephen king villains. 
---
Don't play immersed, get in a lot of chases and learn to loop
---
This is mostly for balance reasons but something the hag the wraith and nurse have in common is that their powers are orange which is a color associated with the entity and they have powers that can be burned while  the spirit does not 
---
Did a game 20 minutes ago and I was playing Ash. My friend said she was positive she heard me say something when I got hit. Need to do more testing to see if it's true or if it was just her hearing things :D
---
The justice perk would be so fun for troll builds. 1 hit hero is a bit too situational to be viable imo. Unbreakable stun is a great idea as well but I don't really like the name
---
Just wanna point out that the 1st perk only works IF you stun the killer, soo it all depends of how the killer plays around the killer shack, but I do agree that I could really be op in the killer shack
---
Do you think the hook perk should be buffed? I was think about losing 2 hooks but I think then it would really be overpowered
---
Too bad he isn't that funny anymore.
---
wow
---
&gt;* Fixed an issue that caused The Plague to be unable to hit Survivors with Corrupt Purge in quick succession.¬†
---
Please fuck off. I thought it was balanced that she needed two streams to down you. 
---
Performance is a bit better but the graphics got a slight downgrade, mostly noticeable in the menus. Matchmaking is pretty bad not gonna lie, but not always. It‚Äôs hit or miss for me
---
That's literally what a mindgame is.
---
I once had a Claudette who stood still at the gate when I was playing Michael and had done terribly. I was like "oh here we go with the tbagging ...." she didn't and in endchat she said she wanted me to get any stalks I needed in in case it was a daily. Which is was. 
---
That Claudette was alright.
---
Couple days later I got her as Rin and I left her do a gen so she could get that hatch. 
---
Not being a dick has its rewards.
---
Same here, I used Task Manager to close Steam Bootstrapper and re-started Steam. It fixed the problem.
---
Activate your windows 
---
Billy the puppet is better
---
Worst timing honestly.
---
Of course steam breaks (for me) right when the update released. Why does it have to be me :(
---
Lol this community doesn't shame survivors for DC'ing, why would anyone try changing your mind
---
Sounds like the intended way to me, isnt this referenced in her power description? 
---
Those mindgames werent fun. Theres still the mindgame of you being invisible. Still strong
---
I joined it okay 
---
Good point but they definitely wanted people to buy it twice
---
You really need to read the chainsaw confidential if you do not get leatherface or the chainsaw massacre. Both have also been very influential to DbD before he was added. The Hillbilly, the meat hooks. On the topic of leatherface being a hillbilly and just kills for no reason can‚Äôt be more wrong then ever. His family are butchers they lost there jobs to the growing industrial world. They live on there farm and what the store owner gets. A bunch of kids trespass onto the farm. Leatherface was raised to kill trespassers to hide the fact they are cannibals and for food. It is a extreme of the collapse of contemporary life. And leatherface is a big part of that a man solely raised to butcher human. A man with his personality being what mask he has on. And a deep fear of outsiders and his own family. Side note leatherface in the first move only kills one person with his saw. That being Franklin. The rest die to the meat hook or him smashing there head with a hammer. 
---
TLDR The Chainsaw massacre is very influential it started the final girl trope. One of the first horror moves to use a power tool as a weapon. Meat hooks. The killer still being out there trope that Halloween and Nightmare used a lot. The movie needed Leatherface the man in the mask of human flesh that butchers man and woman like they were cows.Like it or not Leatherface and the movie are more influential then you are giving it credit for.
---
Counterpoint: The most I enjoyed this game was when I first started playing and was "immersed". Being scared was really fun. I know the community hates on immersed players but although you're right you should learn to loop you can also experiment with some stealth builds too if you're new. You'll probably die a lot in the beginning. 
---
you never know when your hand just might be the killer in disguise...like nea
---
So it‚Äôs not just me struggling? I was trying to log in and it keeps saying I can‚Äôt connect I‚Äôm highkey pissed
---
and the steam is down. lovely
---
I‚Äôm pissed - came on to play and servers are down
---
How much does he cost?
---
idk
---
For fucks sake, it costs the same too.
---
Welp guess I don't have the exclusive cosmetic, groovy
---
Omg the skillchecks were so nice i agree! üò±
---
Atleast the color fits his shirt...
---
its just a blue recolor of his glove.
---
how did Ash break queues?
---
Gotcha, that makes sense
---
Not a lot of the survivors look great tbh. But Claudette gets hit hard with the Survivoritus. Same with Quentin.
---
Dont go near they are Mosquito lamps
---
How can you break something that‚Äôs already broken
---
Until you get downed
---
Don't buy it? 
---
It is a twitch community thing in game, there is a tab in the main menu for it. If you don't care about twitch then its nothing.
---
He speaks!
---
The exclusive is a lighter tinge of brown, and the metal bits are blue instead of red.
---
I don't really think it's worth it, since it's barely noticable and you'll probably just get Ashy Slashy anyways, but it's there.
---
I am just amazed we get cosmetics for him
---
is it just me, or is his navel really really wide? or is that normal for thickies 
---
My question is for people who try out the new perk, Mettle of Man.
---
For activating the perk, it does count hits from : A chainsawes hits ( probably not, but I want to be sure ) ? B hatchets hits ( probably not, but idk ) ? C Corrupt Purge hits ? D Frenzy hits E Lethal Blinks hits ? F Ambush hits ?
---
Legion is just a regular ass teenager with a knife. His power could be insulting you constantly and it brings down the survivors self esteem
---
Don't tunnel and you'll never experience D Strike again.
---
I regret getting him already. Fucking everyone is playing survivor today. Here we go 30mim queues, just so killer can quit! 
---
Sucks that the poster boy for this game is really not that great. Hope buffs can come soon.
---
They‚Äôre not top tier but I don‚Äôt think they suck. Flip flop on a map like the Game where hook spawns are really shitty can make it very hard to hook you if they slug at all, and mettle of man seems like it could get some clutch saves or waste a decent bit of time against certain killers. The aura one doesn‚Äôt seem very good though.
---
ALL the exlusive cosmetics are like this.
---
I believe its a blue glove instead of his red one
---
Or just hit the survivor/jump in. Ive yet to hear a good solution to the hatch thats fair to both sides. 
---
Aaaand steam is down.
---
You need to be injured its literraly on the perk , if you are injured , you cant die from noed, os hatchet or anything 
---
It is now 
---
Awful DS change. They should have just stopped Enduring from working with it.
---
What now? It's ok to tunnel as long as you have Enduring?
---
Also sometimes you end up taking a DS unintentionally. At 5 seconds stun you're once again punished for not using Enduring.
---
Is it possible to rebind the wiggle action to the D-pad maybe. I'm on pc and we have the option to edit action to be and button for keyboard or controller. I don't know if ps4 has the same option
---
Thats really lame, I wish he spoke throughout the match but it was only heard by the player playing him
---
Not really. Jane and Jeff both had cosmetics that were far more noticable.
---
I expected Ash to have a "classic style" exclusive that made his shirt brown or at least a lighter shade of blue. I didn't expect it to literally change the color of maybe a collective 1000 pixels.
---
Exactly this. Can't call someone's bluff if you have literally no feedback and it's not fun gameplay when you don't have the feedback to counter it. Plus there's hardly no downside to standing still for a few seconds and watching what the survivors movements. 
---
Standing still is a terrible excuse of a mind game. Just so fun and interactive, right?
---
Spirit's cracking still not fixed? :/   
---
1. Survivors can hear her entering her phase walk.  
---
2. My ears get raped by this sound so hard.
---
r/perfectloops
---
Probs an intentional shadownerf.
---
Great job as allways!
---
Steam's down.
---
IMO he's the worst killer in the game. Against good survivors his ability means that he can move slower if he wants to.
---
Nah look at the replies to yours. The most hardcore of survivor mains wanted it to be OP again.
---
See how happy they are when the Spirit fury + enduring Billys decide to tunnel though and have an easier time since enduring still works against it.
---
Shit patch from a shit developer.
---
Imagine this, 4 insta-heals in the same guy. BOOM! 8 hits avoided.
---
Because Spirit don't enter in spirit world when she use Yamaoka Haunting, she enter in ethereal plane. The biggest difference between ethereal plane and spirit world is that in ethereal plane you are fully invisible for survivors, but you can't see them, while in spirit world you can see survivors, but they can stil see you ( you can see a Nurse while blinking or a cloaked Wraith while moving ). Spirit isn't affected by flashlights, because she don't interract with spirit world ( like Wraith or Nurse ), she interract with the ethereal plane.
---
Somewhat agree. It also speaks for itself how little there is to lose by dcing
---
Fuck Kenny.  #teamjane
---
It's everything the people in this sub wanted.
---
I had ash im my killer lobby i heard him say groovy
---
Such a tiny chance of that happening, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about it. Besides, mettle doesn‚Äôt work with chainsaws, hatchets, the frenzy, etc
---
That‚Äôs not in game that‚Äôs the lobby. 
---
Actually I could totally see Kenny as either the killer or survivor. He‚Äôs more suited to be a survivor and I would rather see him there but he was close to a breaking point in season two, perfect reasoning/backstory for killer Kenny
---
Killers have exhaustion add ons?
---
It converts your dying state recovery meter into a wiggle meter, essentially. For example, if you‚Äôre on the ground and you get your recovery meter all the way up to ‚ÄòGet Help‚Äô, when you get picked up, your wiggle meter will already be at 50%, cutting the time it takes to actually get off by half.
---
I agree with your argument that a skilled Spirit can consistently hit a survivor, and avoiding her is just guesswork, but I don't see why that's a problem. She's the only killer with a 15 second cooldown between when she can use her power, and not only that, she's a 110% move speed killer, meaning she's required to use her power to down survivors. 
---
She has enough counterplay as is, just run away from the pallet when you see her stand still, and if she doesn't chase you, just start walking in a different direction. The Spirit can counter this by standing still without spirit walking for a few seconds, then using her power. You can predict that, and switch direction multiple times. Alternatively, you could just stay at the pallet, wait 4 or 5 seconds, then slow vault, assuming that the spirit is spirit walking to your side. 
---
Yeah it's kind of two steps forward, one step back. I still think balance is in a good place even with Mettle, but I thought they were trying to discourage the 'tank' playstyle with the Exhaustion changes a while back; the players that can kite you through multiple gens while the others rush through them. Having your aura read isn't necessarily a downside if you're trying to 'gain aggro' on the killer and keep them occupied. In the end I don't think this perk is going to make killer's lives more difficult than DS did, but I think it does raise the ceiling on survivor gameplay even higher, which could be a problem in SWFs at top ranks.
---
I‚Äôve been in queue for 30 min. Found 2 lobbies, killer quits as soon as we load. 
---
I'd pay $5 if he could play with no pants.
---
Wow, you are very lucky. 90% of my games lately are either nurse or legion. 
---
Sad because I used to go up against a variety of killers, but seems like ever since the plague patch I only ever get those two. Don't even get many billy games which makes me sad because i actually like going up against him. :c
---
It wasn't intended, no. Before Plague, she was completely silent whenever she entered Phase..
---
Lol want the source photo?

classic "Name a more iconic duo"

i've gone an entire year without getting a daily for best boy.

Why entity.

Why. 
---
I looped this guy for a while bc we got a good spawn on Thompson, I wouldn't normally abuse it but i had 2 bc we had a 3 man game (+i wasn't really running any "Try hard perks") My friend was fucking around thinking we would lose, we ended up all escaping with only 1 person dead on hook, He was bm'ing us the entire game and said that it was bc i was looping and my friend "Wiggled out" like its my friends fault LMAO

Too late, mate. I already made a post on this.

---
Survivors can hear her activate her power that is a bug.
---
A casual mode should be added. simple enough
---
At least they've finally added incentives for the killer to face them. 
---
Teen Clementine maybe but they would never add her from season 1 something about swinging at a kid and then throwing them on a hook screams bad pr. Would love Kenny or Lee though.
---
Worst examples , try Feng , Tapp , Laurie and doctor 
---
legion and doctor, bbq and disstressinbg or beast of pray are the perks that gives u bloodpoints, thrill of the hunt too also

...Yep. it's the players fault. Not the developers who designed it and can change it. It's us. You're right.

I remember when they said we had an optimization patch coming
---
BBQ and distressing for killers. 
---
We're gonna live forever for survivors. 
---
Any other perks for bloodpoints aren't worth it. 
---
oh yeah that one sorry im bad with perk names. its ok very good agains slugging not much else tbh not p2w
---
Yeah I agree, this was just only photo I could find of all three of them.
---
If they have one it might take awhile to update, or if it is already out try restarting the device
---
Does anyone know what the exclusive item is?
---
Exactly. All the killer needs to do is to just pick you up quickly and it‚Äôs not really too good. Hell, if the killer is using Agitation and/or Iron Grasp, they can let you fill it up all the way and still have more than enough time to get you to a hook.
---
What's wrong with buying a dlc day one lol
---
I feel like this is underrated wisdom. Killers and survivors don‚Äôt get along. That‚Äôs by design. If the killer gets more points as a result of a voice they make, it‚Äôs the better call. Sometimes you gotta camp out those hook divers, just like you gotta go get people off gens if they aren‚Äôt coming to unhook. There‚Äôs no difference. 
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
These two are some of the best killers out there and you think that they are just getting lucky with their slugs?
---
That "gimiky deadhard" gives the killer a whipe and it cant be baited. It should allow the survivor to reach a pallet or window in time significantly prolonging the chase.
---
No, unfortunately I have looked in the controller settings. Also, I have wiggling less aggressively, it just deteriorates at a slower  rate. 
---
Legion. Two survivors will probably DC on-sight, and you're left with a really quick match. You'll earn less BP per game but more per hour, you gotta think of the long game. 
---
He legit comparing looping to rape?
---
Also, two things: mind games, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, just break the fucking thing. 
---
I haven‚Äôt gotten into a game because of the fucked PS4 matchmaking yet, but I can confirm that Ash has voice lines when you select him. 
---
Without a proper model this is sadly the [best](https://imgur.com/a/5OE2gG1) I'm doing on minimum effort
---
Because killers are over reacting the same way they did to head on. When was the last time survivors got an actual OP perk?  Its stupid to claim a perk is "the new DS" before its even been tested out for awhile. 
---
Imagine being salty because somebody looped you
---
He was playing spirit 2, he was sweating so hard against a 3 man game and we still won lmao 
---
BBQ and distressing on killers, I‚Äôd recommend using doc, Freddy, and legion while your farming.
---
We‚Äôre gonna live forever and Prove thyself on survivor.
---
Some killers just expect you stand still and allow them to down and kill you lol. I don‚Äôt understand the logic behind it. 
---
Did he even try to do the thing where he feigns using her power? 
---
&gt;When was the last time survivors got an actual OP perk?
---
That's your argument, you "deserve" an OP perk..? Feels like people should at least be able to talk about it. 
---
Puppet man best man

yes!

&gt; Already answered why slugging is not a valid strategy in high ranks.

Aaaaaaand into the dumpster your opinion goes.

Ash dies
---
Yes but what does the clown cut off
---
Also happy cake day
---
Im not sure on where to get the code
---
So you‚Äôre telling me that a sound of glass shattering that is no where else in the game just happens to be added to the killer with glass stuck in her body as she enters phase? 
---
Rude, but ok.
---
They only started doing exclusive cosmetics recently. Those Survivors literally don't even have exclusive cosmetics.
---
I know bud, not my first rodeo. But i got 2 dailys ready and im gonna use the shrine so i can get at least p1
---
&gt;Killer is 40 meters or more away
---
Spirit, Billy and Nurse are essentially immune to the perk then. The survivor isn't getting "outplayed" if the killer is back to the hook 2 seconds after they get unhooked.
---
&gt;Exit doors are opened
---
I don't get this one at all, why should you lose a perk if the gates are open? Should borrowed time not trigger after gens are powered too, then?
---
&gt;Unhooked survivor remains within 16 meters of hook
---
Maybe the killer is looking for the unhooked guy to down them fast and the survivor is trying to slip away? Why is getting a heal under a hook a bad idea, by that logic we'll make it is an awfully designed perk.
---
&gt;Killer has began chase of another target for at least 15 seconds
---
You could purposefully look at the ground till you hear survivor's footsteps that aren't coming from someone groaning in pain. You got into chase with the unhooker so now the perk is useless.
---
Just slug the survivor and never get DSd. It's simple as that.
---
Well , lloks like I won't get any more adept achievements again.
---
Is it just me or is he way too quiet. I can‚Äôt even hear him over the lobby music half the time
---
Hello there, old chum!
---
Not saying anything is wrong. I just made a meme (linked elsewhere in the comments) where I said that every lobby day 1 would consist of 3 Ash Williams and one "Ash Ketchum."
---
This. I just had a game where the doctor chased me all game and spammed his treatment thing on 3 ash including me. Was exhausting af

These are questions science needs answered 
---
No tapp is good , better than the default one
---
Honestly the creeper would be cool but he‚Äôs owned by a low life shit head pedo, victor salva needs to be in prison
---
Yeah he is too quiet, and I wish he'd say lines in game. At least  his falling noise humours me
---
This! I was very disappointed!
---
And because bald Dwights are fucking scary.
---
It is pretty low. I had to raise the game volume higher to hear it clearly and it was still low. But I agree, I really like his falling voice :) 
---
Aren't you holding it hostage by not jumping in?
---
For real? You were one of them? :D
---
So like spine chill or premonition?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt really say that‚Äôs taking the game hostage. It‚Äôs reportable when he‚Äôs trapped you in a corner, to the point where you can‚Äôt do anything at all. 
---
I had a dance off with one killer on the hatch one night. I had all night so I just stood there and waited him out, wiggling my character's feet occasionally. He finally got bored and swung so I got the escape. Took about 20 minutes. It was worth it for the win.
---
Just do gens lol. 
---
In all seriousness if this happens break the remaining dulls then do gens, that way if they were counting on noed they won‚Äôt get it and you‚Äôll get a gate or hatch.
---
It was not added. You heard the glass when you used the power. Like the sound when The Shape stalks. A bug made it so survivors head the glass as well.
---
When you joined you scared the shit out of me, sorry for dodging! o/
---
&gt; you will get hit by it even if you don't go out of your way to tunnel someone.
---
How? If you don't tunnel the guy and not immediately pick them up, you will never get hit by it. Ever. Physically impossible.
---
I really wanted to see which piece was his p1. Couldn't find anything so in case anyone else is wondering. Here you go 
---
It's annoying for sure but if I was in that situation and the killer doesn't move...Let him kill you or catch you as you try for the hatch or go to a gen.
---
There's ways round this.
---
Like the other DLCs, purchasing the DLC directly from Steam/Xbox/PS will give you an additional cosmetic. In this case, you would receive a different torso cosmetic for Ash that you otherwise would not receive if you purchased through the in-game store.
---
Why would the killer down anyone else? You're the closest to death.
---
I appreciate it when survivors do it but I'd prefer they just leave once all of them remaining are at the gates. Just rather the game end tbh.
---
If he's using double darkening add-on's now then the traps blend in crazy well with the dirt of the Red Forest, Prenn Asylum, Farm, and Mcmillan maps. It was just too funny putting a trap in the middle of an open ground gap near the house (one of the most common locations survivors run) in the Mothers Dwelling map, and watching survivors charge right into it. No grass patches even required. 
---
https://www.twitch.tv/deadbydaylight
---
Go onto their twitch page and scroll down till you see the purple panel to grant the app permission. Then click the icon with the little silhouette of a person. I think then it should say something along the lines of "how to join" which you will click on and find your code to be able to participate in the challenges.  
---
By the same token survivors are holding the game hostage. This has been an issue for both killers and survivors. Obviously the killer feels you shouldn't be able to get a free exit for essentially losing, while the survivor feels that's the only way to win. 
---
It's one of the most unfun interactions in the game and really just tests how willing each person is to stay in the match.
---
Subtle lol
---
I rarely play killer but when I do, I literally always play Spirit or Amanda. I don‚Äôt really like the others. Amanda is neat when you want to mess around with the bear traps to slow things down a little bit and then Spirit to (essentially) just wreck havoc if you have prayer beads. 
---
they‚Äôre not holding it hostage you can do the generators or standoff
---
Errrm never had this issue, you sure you don't have something open that it might be noticing
---
I could've sworn there was already an achievement for crawling through the hatch, did anyone else think this?
---
I can‚Äôt kill her. Please don‚Äôt make me do this
---
You telling me you wouldnt fund more bruce?
---
Oh? Reddit uses notifies me when someone reuses the photo, but I guess some got past?
---
Anyhow, Slippery Meat +Up The Ante &gt; Deliverance 
---
I'm too busy being the only survivor doing Ruin generators to save any of the survivors that keep trading hooks 
---
It makes sense but it feels like a real missed opportunity. I totally would have bought the DLC if he talked in game but as it stands I just don't think its worth
---
I suppose you're right, but there was still two gens left and we both got to the hatch at the same time.   
---
It's a fair point that I could have run off, and gone for the small chance of escaping the killer. I guess my point is less the strategy of defending the hatch and more the spirit (pun not intended) of how it was done. 
---
How *DARE* you make me read this with my own eyes.
---
&gt; I think people should be able to talk about this without their reactions being exaggerated in attempts to undermine their views. 
---
You legit just made up that I said survivors "deserve" an OP perk. As for people freaking out, OP literally titled this post "Mettle of man is the new decisive strike" and then went on to comment that its arguably worse than DS.
---
I stopped dcing since running that gives me the right to tbag him if I pallet stun him. 
---
There's an achievement for crawling your escape out, not just through the hatch
---
For some users on Xbox, Microsoft decided to go and force you to reinstall the full game before you could play it again. Smh
---
I want to upvote this again and again 
---
Ah okay, thanks.
---
It‚Äôs obi the legion is playing with a controller, spinning around a killer with controller is not impressive. Also that legit had nothing 2 do with the convo but I‚Äôm glad to know I‚Äôm not the only dumbass here 
---
I knew this was going to happen but I barely use items anyways. Maybe for that specific cosmetic switch it up a bit so his mouth is holding it or something????
---
I do that. Ever since the first remote went to shit. I've done the rotating analog since October
---
Whut I already did the Crawl to the hatch achievement over a year ago!  Is this solely on consoles? 
---
I had a game were 3 people put on a streamer and I had a ebony mori and I was leather face only 1 gen done and a 4 man
---
I'd still use Ashy, personally \o/ Puppet hand best hand. I thought it was weird, though, that they modeled Ashy to work correctly with Medkits and Toolboxes but not flashlights.
---
Thanks, MS paint is a blessing
---
Try clicking on her and if it come up with the buy this character then restart you game and see if the problem persists
---
Shop smart. Shop S-Mart.
---
I just checked it's all back now, thanks for the help guys
---
I try to not use NOED unless the survivors are unusually t-baggy toxic in chat etc. I like LF the best cause he feels like he moves so fast üòÇ. To be fair though your build on Pig would work on any killer. I've always been in the anti-decisive anti-noed boat. Since decisive got its change noed is the next one that needs as change. But that's a discussion for a different forum post lol. The main reason I made this was to hear from people like you though who main killers I dont normally play üòÅüòÅ
---
He holds toolboxes and medkits with his mouth properly! Just not a flashlight. I got a kick out of the toolbox at first. I assumed the flashlight would be correct too but *oh boy was I wrong*.
---
So is this meme man I saved it to show a couple buddies haha

On pc I‚Äôm getting instant matches?

It doesn't help that you didn't link it

He is licensed of course you can‚Äôt use shards 
---
Yes Always happens to me as well , and i keep forgetting about it After each update 
---
how much does his dlc cost?
---
What do I have to do to get the extra faces fir The Cannibal?
---
oh...
---
They obviously didn‚Äôt. 
---
Hm well it is pretty funny! Lol
---
Did they fix Hag and Spirit M1s? People were saying they weren't working a couple days ago.
---
lmao
---
Imaging playing spirit and complaining about looping LULW
---
Probably as long as everyone else. Sometimes it's a few months, sometimes it's a year. Nonetheless his perks aren't exactly game breaking, and Ash isn't even the first survivor who comes from paid DLC (heck, before last year, ALL DLC was cash only)
---
*"Fighting with honor creates only a moral obligation to lose."*
---
I play games to have fun and improve. In my opinion there is no need for either side to pull punches. If you have a bad time because you're losing or don't enjoy the enemy's strategy, the obligation is on you to improve, not the enemy to "make the game fun for everyone." Such is the nature of a PvP or competitive game.
---
I‚Äôm not the only one! 
---
Get ready for the next battle!
---
[obligatory clown suckling](https://youtu.be/fk9RcCCSJu4?t=33)
---
If you unhook right in front of the killer, that isn‚Äôt tunneling. If the killer is only able to find you, that isn‚Äôt tunneling. But if a killer purposely ignores other survivors to go find and hit somebody who just got off the hook, that is tunneling, and that should be punished. Decisive activating multiple times a match won‚Äôt be a problem unless you are a killer that tunnels. If someone unhooks themselves and gets downed immediately, decisive would activate in its current state anyway. Finding someone who just got off the hook once would activate decisive anyway.
---
It's possible to be rank 1 just very tough now. You have to play very well and consistently well.
---
it wasn't lag that made them dc tho
---
Nurse's M1 is inconsistent. It doesn't trigger Dark Devotion either, even though it does trigger Infectious Fright (both trigger on basic attacks). I'm guessing one of these interactions is bugged.
---
They were running it less, but we'll see if that remains the same. I don't know, I think there's a chance it's going to increase in usage back to pre-wanna-be nerf days.
---
Enduring is a good perk, but it's not in every build. This is going to hurt killers who aren't using Enduring a great bit.
---
I agree with this post because your not just missing out on evil your also missing out on points you could‚Äôve earned
---
You win this round...

üò∂üò∂üò∂
---
Yep! Feng Min gets her weekend outfit, for example, and Jeff gets an alternative shirt as well.
---
Where does it say that? It says they identified some causes and are investigating... 
---
Console. Probably a 30:1 survivor killer ratio right now. 
---
*pic of nothing* A Claudette in the wild XD

No this is literally just to satisfy the people who were complaining about the DS change .

Oh right, this mori. Does the finger just appeared?

I didn't see am option for Brenda Meeks

Asia here, been getting matched with nothing but Aussies and Russians all day. x_x

Is he out??
---
I wish they would just give us a handful of Auric cells for buying outright on Steam, instead of these lazy "exclusives". Doesn't have to be 1:1, but like 300 or something?
---
I heard it was a bug ? Saw a video of someone having to mend for more than 10 minutes... he ended up just letting himself get downed and use unbreakable lol
---
[Did 10 matches](https://i.imgur.com/gtnMHuw.png) at Rank 9, tried to use the same format as you.
---
Haha am i that fucking old?!?! I dont understand have the shit people are talking about. 
---
What is tunneling?
---
These are really cool but about the second perk... If you're opening a gate the killer will be able to grab you, which would negate the endurance if I understand the perk correctly?
---
Someone's hyped for the new hearthstone expansion.
---
why though ?
---
Yeah, and now a strategically good move now is not immediately picking up the guy who just got unhooked. Same way you'd play around borrowed time, in many situations it's better to go after the guy who was unhooking. But here it's even better than with borrowed time, because the guy who got unhooked doesn't even get to keep running. You can slug him for pressure.
---
&gt;I don't appreciate having slugging forced upon me as a killer
---
And I'm sure the survivor doesn't appreciate getting immediately tunneled off hook forced on them. They have literally no way of playing around it, especially if the teammate farms them. You get to play around the DS &amp; BT.
---
&gt;it means that they want us to assume that any player can have it at any time
---
And you also get that with Blood Warden (so you don't open the gate immediately and 99% it till someone gets hooked) NOED (you don't have any indicators for it till someone gets hit, so you need to clense the totem every game or risk getting hit with it) nurse's calling (you don't want to ever heal in the killer's terror radius) spirit fury (the only indicator you can have is the killer running enduring) BBQ (you assume they have it and get into a locker/stay in range/hide behind a gen) adrenaline (if you down someone and don't know where anyone else is then you usually want to hook the guy) borrowed time (don't tunnel). There is a lot of perks that you just assume people have and have to play around them, singling out DS out of all of them isn't fair.
---
&gt;And killers don't ask for easy kills.
---
That's why you are complaining about an anti-tunneling perk getting a buff so it's not absolute trash tier. Because you don't want an easy kill and want to think about your plays. 
---
Yess thank you!
---
Look at his perks 2, I‚Äôm running fucking pebble lmao
---
Cue Smooth Criminal by Michael Jackson
---
it's just lag

overcharge is pretty useless on pc üòî

It's the robo-hand, but instead of red accents, it's blue
---
Because this community is insatiable 
---
Yea me too. I mean he is nearly impossible to hide from and never gets pallet looped but he gets smacked around like no tomorrow if you're not careful. If the survivors gang up on you it just feels bad lol. And all Tommy Jarvis needs is a machete and the sweater girl with an axe and it's all over for Jason.
---
Dead by Daylight takes far more skill to survive. The killers are fast paced and you can hide from them which is exciting. I never get victories standing around dancing. If you could dance you would never have time to do it besides the end of the game. 
---
I like DBD better hands down. They're both fun as survivors but I just don't enjoy playing Jason anymore it feels like a chore. DBD is fun to me throwing survivors on hooks for easy bloodpoints. And worse case scenario they all get away and you chase them off the map at the end while they're all teabagging nothing. Feels softcore after getting your dead face teabagged at the end of a game as Jason in a slow motion cutscene. 
---
Honestly kind of glad there is no PS4 voice chat though. People were annoying enough shit talking on Friday and the community here seems much more volatile. Only kind of. Entitled killers afraid of SWF groups because the big bad survivors might communicate in a team based game and entitled survivors who think they have a right to be rescued from every hook they're put on every time.  
---
Eyup! Right now!
---
Yea, but at least it makes gens go down faster 
---
oh shoot it does i didnt know
---
You hear a revving of a chainsaw in the distance. It sounds like Billy, or is it Leatherface?
---
It's getting closer, you have to hide...your teammates stay on the gen, you know their fate is sealed.
---
But then it stops moving. Instead you hear a screaming. Has someone been downed? You peek out from cover and are in awe at what you see:
---
Frank of the Legion, screaming as Ash Williams, Housewares, is chainsawing the Legion in half.
---
You can't bring yourself to say anything else except: *"Groovy..."*
---
&gt; just so survivors can have fun
---
yea the 4 players having fun is not important at all
---
When you think about it they shouldve make the perk work only vs special atacks like chainsaws or hatches cause the better killers are the one we want to counter/esp the one shots/ and not the weak freddy or wraith with their only basic atacks ...
---
Stop it, I'm gonna *crumb*
---
Go do gens....annoying maybe not hostage holding
---
Why should survivors automatically get the hatch? You are holding the game hostage as well since you aren‚Äôt just jumping in and letting them grab you.
---
I usually give survivors the hatch because I don‚Äôt feel like standing around but the few times I was like let me see how long they will last and they always wait because they feel like it‚Äôs owed to them. I‚Äôve had a few do gens instead of go for the hatch which definitely helps since if I leave you most likely will get it if you play it smart 
---
*"unlucky"*
---
HE WAS USING A FUCKING HAG?!? YOU DON'T CHASE WITH A HAG! 
---
1 isn‚Äôt as much but 2 definitely has its comedy. But yes it gets more comedy with each movie.
---
Are you ok?
---
What exactly is the exclusive item? I'm not getting anything on Google.
---
Yeah I was pretty stoked and the one perk saved my butt at the end so I could escape 
---
I think it would make more sense if it was Lee or one of the other cliff-hanger characters 
---
This picture is so adorable.
---
&gt; people who were crying about the DS change
---
Because the perk is useless if you get KO'd 4 meters from where you used it.
---
Lol, I'm good but I saw that and I was perplexed. Hag is like the one killer you don't chase with.
---
FWIW, always buy DbD DLC on Steam or Xbox store. It's the only way to share it.
---
If you buy in game, then it wont be shared.
---
*The thing is more terrible than i can describe - this horror must be unmade!*
---
you'd think that a spirit with meta perks would play well but no
---
Most of the time you wont. The game is based on no communication between survivors that SWF has.
---
So unless they make mistakes you generally wont get more than a kill or two if they are top tier survivors.
---
Having said that SWF is generally over altruistic so you can try using that to your advantage.
---
I'd prefer my lord and savior Kenny. One of his perks allows him to summon a boat for protection
---
When you escape as Kenny he finally gets to Savannah :(
---
Kinda bullshit for the price you dont get the outfits. Oh well
---
nobody did it before cuz its a dead meme
---
As a killer, the most beneficial choice is to go after the one injured survivor.  Any other decision is literally worse for your bloodpoints.  Calling this a bad thing is the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  Must be a Reddit thing...
---
No, I go out of my way to purchase the content on Steam and have it show up in my library, the items are just a bonus and the chapters packs are a better deal.
---
Wow that's fucking stupid.
---
although i really want to see what happens when the puppet hand gets moried

https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage

Imagine being this salty to compare a serious traumatizing real life crime to... playing ring around the rosie in a video game. Someone needs more hugs from mom huh.
---
Daddy Kenneth 
---
Welcome to the Jake side. Prepare for the tunneling
---
these fuckin trolls
---
Also, its a hell of a lot more noticeable when working on a gen rather than a shirt that is covered by a jacket and you're staring at the back of anyway (Adam, Jeff, Jane).
---
That's ok but what's up with that common recolor hand thing!? Why didn't they put more effort in making it a little more interesting and creative?
---
But you are literally stating that the moral choice is to not tunnel.  That is where we all disagree with you...
---
It always seems I‚Äôm suffering from *Deja Vu* when I‚Äôm starting my bloodwebs. 
---
My meme build used to be no mither, tenacity, unbreakable, and dead hard, If the Killer was distracted for about 12 seconds, I'd be long gone, soon to be back up. Now, with flip-flop, I can benefit even *if* the Killer finds me after 10 seconds.
---
Be an alpha male and go against the meta bro.
---
Play Legion
---
Use ruin / noed on every character, even characters that don't need it just for end-game lobby salt.
---
Don't even straight up kill survivors just farm them you're a Legion they can't get away anyway.
---
Otherwise be an alpha male and maximize the salt:
---
Tunneling survivors.
---
Camping survivors / face camping.
---
Pallet loop a killer.
---
Block survivor in a corner.
---
Block killer on way to hook.
---
Block escape from basement. (Bannable if you afk "Holding game hostage.")
---
Wait for hatch while last person is on hook.
---
Sandbag "Block survivors while they run to window / pallet."
---
T-bagging.
---
Use annoying items / perks.
---
Dribble survivors w/ decisive strike.
---
Slug survivors.
---
Dump all your traps around hooked survivor.
---
Stand @ the door and wait for killer to chase you out.
---
Lag / Lag switching.
---
Talk smack in post-game lobby. (Not bannable to gloat, but bannable if it's real horrid stuff.)
---
Glitch out of map / above terrain and afk as survivor.
---
Franklins Demise survivor items then disconnect. (Kill internet, don't close game to bypass detection system. Mass-leaving games is bannable.)
---
As killer, work with ONE survivor to ruin the rest.
---
Ew
---
Goddamn, nice one.
---
I really liked the estimated time for a match feature  but noticed it recently fucked off my screen when I queve up with friends sometimes. Is that a bug or what?
---
See ya then!
---
He gets a blue mechanical hand 
---
It's a brown version of the hand. Not worth it at all
---
Stridor helps though was my point. Stop complaining man.
---
So much fiber fill 
---
Yes.
---
Out of my 10 games I‚Äôve played. 4 stuck loading screen. And the Dcs have been worse than ever. Seems like if you get the slightest lag It boots you out. 
---
For the hole match? How does the matter if it can be cleansed? 
---
Thats lame. I paid extra on hulu just to watch it. 
---
That's still a nerf.
---
And no, being invisible alone isn't enough for her kit to be effective.
---
INB4 "Git gud"
---
Eh. I do 100% understand this would be a time consuming project
---
Amateur devs can't even fix that? not surprised one bit
---
It‚Äôs that way for every single character though, never buy a killer/survivor with cells or you won‚Äôt get their alternative skins. 
---
The joke-post that proposes those changes makes it so DH is no longer tied to a totem. It cannot be clensed.
---
Ye be warned guys; there's a new shitty bug going on. Idk what caused it, but I couldn't touch any generators playing as Ash. Absolutely nothing I could do all game except run around trying to loop the killer. Fantastic patch, 10/10
---
Glad they changed it. It was rather sad seeing someone go in with a bad perk, get it to work and then get smacked .75s after jumping off lol. 
---
Yeah but I'd never get it before today :/
---
It's specifically at vaults though
---
Shut up white knight fuckin headass lmao
---
But it's an especially dumb business practice if it's a paragraph DLC, they both literally cost the same except one of them has an extra cosmetic 
---
What does bloodlusting mean? I hear people say it in videos.
---
 "He's bloodlusting me."
---
Just do generators dude. The killer isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage you are.
---
Is spirit fury broken for anyone? 
---
It was lit up ready to go and not a single pallet broke.
---
Agreed. I really like the way it‚Äôs implemented too - still makes enduring a good check to it but it doesn‚Äôt render it useless
---
I love all these killer mains in the comments. If you go off and do gens and be sneaky as possible, they yell at you after game for holding the game hostage and taking forever. Big brains.
---
Claudette is gross 
---
Cheers, to the 99th precinct! 
---
I watched Evil Dead 2 for the first time a few years ago; that scene, and everything that came after it, was pure gold.
---
This clown is a bit fucky.
---
Who tf is ash
---
Is there going to be anything done with making the killer scarier? I'm trying to get into the game as a killer, and I just had every single survivor in the match get up in my face and crouch spam at me, and I knew then that it's just fucked up.
---
I'm asking to know if I in the end wasted my money buying this game or if there's going to be any improvement in that regard.
---
this is lowkey the best skin in the game
---
Good April Fools joke. 
---
Read that again. "...a **fully sick/infected** Survivor was **saved by another fully sick** Survivor.¬†" Apparently some people were getting sick all of a sudden when someone else did the rescue.
---
it wouldn't let me jump in. I would gone for it otherwise. 
---
Then what's your point? You want it to be useless?
---
Bought the dlc but i do not see what the exclusive item is? Anyone know?
---
Pretty high price for a such small boner. 
---
Don't be silly. That sounds reasonable and plausible. We can't be having that in DBD.
---
Lets just keep nurse and billy strong and punish the shit killers instead.
---
Cowboy jake &gt;:)
---
I found it to be really tricky. As a solo survivor it was rough sometimes, but it could very easily be abused in SWF groups.  I played against a couple who effectively punished me for getting chases done quickly. It made some very frustrating and annoying situations. BT and DS with some combo of deliverance, unbreakable and exhaustion. New DS is arguably way better for SWFs than it was previously. It can feel like the killer was being punished for doing nothing wrong. 
---
You just can't balance around solo or SWF without buffing the other. 
---
I'm still happy with the change overall, but I can't fathom playing a 4-man without enduring (or billy + nurse for that matter).
---
Seems easy.
---
I never understood why they called it mindgaming as spirit. She actually has very few mindgames, especially when you consider the ones she does have every killer has. It‚Äôs 100% guessing - you‚Äôre not outsmarting an opponent by getting into their head, you‚Äôre making them choose between standing still and maybe getting hit and moving and maybe getting hit
---
Lol right on
---
Not sure on USD, but in BRL It's 15$, that's around 4-5 dollars
---
500 auric cells so $4.99 plus tax
---
I had a bitch ass Claudette like that last game
---
Holy shit thats evil
---
you might wanna read that again lol
---
Anthony can we uhhh get a big yikes on the board please?
---
Yeah I was Vsauce4
---
How come some Killers don't have iridescent add-ons? Bubba feels cheated.
---
Flip Flop seems decent, the other two are worthless.
---
They DESPERATELY need to fix the Blade add-ons for Legion. The mend time stacks on EVERY stab which can lead to literally minutes of mending. It's insane. 
---
If somebody yells at you for doing your only option, they're an idiot. Nobody outside of that match is going to be salty about it.
---
Are your arms getting tired from stirring the pot?
---
As I said it has been happening for a while for me and its very intermittent, like I can go for a few games with it not happening. It does seem to happen on vaults most though so only thing I can think is its a lag spike. 
---
"are we gonna be here all day?" üòÖ
---
If clem was added I‚Äôd only play her tbh
---
Typical Survivor main spotted.
---
Probably licenses
---
They didn't fix head on...
---
shut up libtard npc lol kek
---
Sorry for dodging, I was just so fucking scared of you guys. xD
---
What sucks is mostly weaker killers will suffer from Mettle, and if they are not considered weak then this perk will make them, like Wraith and Pig. I like them experimenting with new ideas and even doing something wild, especially after Jane having perks that are situationally ok, but this perk....Jesus.
---
A good trapper is very menacing. Having to be on the lookout constantly for traps can be nerve wracking
---
‚ÄúYour only option‚Äù stfu victim!!üòÇüòÇüòÇ You can hit the survivor. That‚Äôs another option. ‚ÄúOh well they‚Äôll escape!!!‚Äù Okay if I run away from the hatch I‚Äôll probably get hooked. Shut up 
---
Could have used any other description besides rape, my guy. Doing that will have people like me more focused on that the thing you're trying to discuss. 
---
When are they going to fix the Spirit sound bug though?
---
Yep and proud boi üòõ 
---
&gt;Every spirit uses cooldown add ons
---
I actually see a lot of movement speed add ons now since the new maps are so big. I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs like at T1, but at T12-6 it‚Äôs like 50/50. 
---
&gt;I don‚Äôt see Hags to be honest
---
I don‚Äôt see them either to be honest. I also don‚Äôt agree that she‚Äôs high tier so I think there‚Äôs correlation there, but that‚Äôs just my opinion
---
Are u retarded or did your mom just drop you as a baby
---
Also make your choice is a great perk, why not use it and just one hit down the one who saved him?. 
---
NOED is always great when you want some salt extract. 
---
It‚Äôs the ultimate use of his aura sight when they‚Äôre outside the terror radius cause by the time you get close and lose it they can‚Äôt move far enough away.
---
Just a survivor pack and if you want a killer pack there could be people like Lilly and Marlon or something 
---
Im gonna go on a limb and say he cuts off a finger through the puppet
---
you sure it wasnt just for escaping while crawling? cause you could get that by crawling out the door or hatch. looks like the new one is specifically for the hatch.
---
I mean from the event the cosmetics you get were free and giving people the opportunity to buy them helps earn money since they are really cool skins. Not to mention they are some of the really scarier ones compared to other skins killers can get.
---
Hag is high tier, people just don't play her right so they assume she's awful and don't play her. (Sadly).
---
You are not supposed to be using up all of your power for mobility. If you use it all up then yeah, Spirit will be mediocore.
---
It's annoying because it takes you quite far back compared to usual lag :/
---
That ass will be eaten with copious amounts of salt.
---
As a killer chases a survivor, they will gain bloodlust. It makes the killer move slightly faster. The longer the chase, the more bloodlust the killer gains. It‚Äôs removed by ending the chase, or if a killer breaks a pallet.
---
When I'm playing him I still like to try and sound like Robert Englund when I'm talking to myself. Movie ash and TV series ash are both equally great imo
---
Yeah I also wanna see it
---
Eh, alright then
---
Not a secret if I tell everyone, dm me so I can tell you 
---
Been playing for hundreds of hours and never knew this. Thanks. 
---
I had that on Xbox before this update once
---
I mean if you are assuming you are going to do badly, then yeah. I am not putting different scenarios that may or may not happen, I am saying that going after them doesn't make your bp gain better overall.
---
Plus by doing that you are not playing around BT/buffed DS, which may hurt your chances of doing well too.
---
Outstanding move
---
Oof fuck that
---
Infinity gauntlet when?
---
Hahaha over a year of course. Still though...
---
Nah 9 isn't that high a rank and even if it was that still speaks volumes that matchmaking should take that absurdly long for someone who is only rank 9. 
---
I‚Äôll be a hero and play killer, thank me later
---
They also changed plague's voice and what she says when you select her to play
---
He played with Spirit, probably the second or third best killer in the game and he still gets looped. Please, no.  
---
What add ons do you use
---
I'll thank you now. Thank you.
---
A few weeks ago I got camped by Wraith because I was using "toxic" perks and looped him on the Pale Rose. My toxic perk was Balanced Landing.   
---
Btw, how can perk be toxic xD
---
Don‚Äôt worry. You‚Äôre probably talking to an elitist. 
---
Knowing that you can filter colors is MONUMENTAL for succeeding in life. 
---
Poor little fisheroonie.
---
No problemo 
---
Fuckin lol. This is the fucking truth right here. Can't tell you how many times I was mindfucked by a spirit at loops. They don't even need the OP addons, just a tiny bit of brainpower and loopers are fucked. 
---
I hope that the random disconnect issues that seem to be totally plaguing the game for myself and others right now are caught under the net of "Fixed some crash issues/Fixed some instances of infinite loading screens."
---
Nothing has sucked more lately than half of the survivors in my game disconnecting mid chase at the same time.
---
They changed what she says too, it's not the same line! And i think it's a different voice? It's really nice
---
Damn ill need to start screenshotting friendly post game. Had a daily for Legion. Got ggs and told them it was a daily and one said "its cool. Wp" 2ked the 2 that got out were both 2 hooked. 
---
Far longer than I‚Äôd like to admit publicly lol
---
[YeahBoy.MP4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Acjf66Qdj2U)
---
You get bodyblocked by the person with borrowed and sometimes a 3rd guy. Maps aren't big so you only get one hit to down someone.
---
I like ur name 
---
Seriously though should there be friendly chat all the time not vice versa
---
It was insane, I just switched to killer instead and let all the Ash players go so they'd get their adept
---
Thing is now it' won't be useful every games, and even if you get the occasion to use it, there is a lot of chances that it won't be quite useful anyway. Which means that this perk lost 70% of its interest.
---
Thanks for the copypasta reddit killer
---
OMG YAS!
---
Why would this be a thing? Why would they do this?
---
Why is playing the game to win as a killer so looked down upon? I never face camp, I'm not really ever even tempted to, it's not fun. But I like to secure sacrifices by prioritizing chasing survivors that have already been hooked/injured. I can understand why camping is frowned upon, it takes the fun away. But why is it expected for killers to make the game easy for survivors?
---
I'm going to scream
---
The distinction being: they're forcing people who have cells saved to spend more money. Or in other words, a money grab.
---
I had a Myers tell me I was toxic for "looping" on Auto Have Gas Heaven. The thing is, I didn't fucking loop him. I was super confused as to what in the actual fuck he was talking about. I had balanced landing, and kept running straight up the hill, and around the tractor then straight to a pallet drop. I kept running in straight lines for the most part. But that's not the funniest part. I was the only one who died and he STILL fucking got mad at me????
---
I'd just let them stay in the locker, or take them out and let them struggle off where there aren't lockers. Either way they buy themselves time, if all 4 survivors did that while doing gens (which they don't in my experience) I'd get a 2k tops.
---
To get to that point though I'd need 4x the normal amount to get tier 3. At that point generally 1 gen is left or the exit gates are available.
---
Tombstone Myers moves slower than survivors at tier 1. You can tell if he's using a tombstone addon based on his hand while he's tier 2. Looping is definitely possible against him even with 3 PWYF stacks but not at unsafe pallets. It is not a broken setup.
---
Because of course it does. There needs to be ANOTHER perk that hard counters Freddy's ability. 
---
Needs some stobe lights, cage dancers, glow sticks and you got a sick rave spot.
---
This has to be a bug. There‚Äôs no way the devs would intentionally do this... right? 
---
Really? So how was it obtained prior? Do people that had it still have it? I bought that DLC off the steam store when I first got the game not knowing you could earn it for free in game and all this time I thought it was a huge waste to have done that. I have the cardigan though so if I couldn't have got it otherwise I feel a lot better about it
---
Plus running BBQ &amp; Chili = tasty
---
Can someone explain camping to me. It feels like everyone has their own interpretation of when someone is camping and the main decider is how frustrated they are. I've just started playing killer and if I see someone thats been unhooked I'll chainsaw sprint back and try and get them or the other guy. I don't really see how that is a bad thing to do - should I just let them recover?
---
Hi there, been playing for 250 hours now and still don‚Äôt know the difference between toolbox addons.  Addons that make your toolbox more ‚Äúefficient‚Äù... what exactly does this do for me?  How does this differ from addons that add charges or increase repair speed?
---
I think I'll do the same. I just want to play Ace.
---
A 5 second stun wont bring new DS out of meme tier. Its still garbage.
---
Your luck is the same as mine. I bought leatherface just before it showed up on shrine.
---
UMMMM BUT ALSO WHEN IT'S THE DOCTOR / NURSE!!
---
*NOT GROOVY*
---
Think of it as a race. Whoever finds it first wins 
---
I mean.. This IS behavior we're talking about here.. LoL.. 
---
Have you played survivor yet? There can be some pretty tense moments but I agree that it could be scarier.
---
You an me both rocket.
---
yes! until i play as ash i won't believe it ( or i see him in the survivor select screen) 
---
Oooh man, Lee is a fucking legend, I'd love to see him. I bet they could get the rights pretty cheap too considering those boys are bankrupt or whatever :p
---
&gt;** D A R N**
---
FTFY
---
Lucky!!! I‚Äôm still looking for a game haha it‚Äôs been 40min!! 
---
It‚Äôs not holding the game hostage if you can do gens
---
No idea, but it's a real momentum loss for Freddy. I figured the Ash had it since he's now and all, but I certainly wasn't expecting it to wake him up. Why would I have thought that in the first place lmao
---
I almost did!
---
Freddy OP, ask the rank 20's.
---
It's just entitlement they will make any excuse to justify why it wasn't their fault
---
I will cop when the funds are available. 
---
I'd hope so? It's not mentioned at all in the description.
---
So fast! Thank you!
---
&gt;Lol so if someone uses deliverance like 20 feet away from you, you SHOULDNT go put them back on the hook because that's tunneling?
---
Dude what are you even talking about? Thats such an extreme, random example. Majority of tunneling matches dont have anything to do with someone using deliverance right in front of you so I dont even know why you‚Äôre mentioning the perk. You know exactly what tunneling means.
---
The green and red mori items are an offering the killer can use to kill 1 or any (respectively) downed survivor that has been hooked, the yellow one can kill the last survivor while downed no matter what.
---
Yours do gens? They dont just hide behind the rock next to gen while you work on it alone...
---
The way I see sprint burst in solo ques is like survival agianst a bear. I dont have to be faster than the bear just faster than the other survivor.
---
Green and red still need to be hooked once. ;-P
---
Or maybe you're shitty.
---
About the camping to that I say this 
---
The killers job is to kill not make buddy with the survivors if it's in the game and it works any strategy is allowed so long as it isn't cheating
---
Don't worry about this, it's just another salty survivor
---
What is this im hearing about an exclusive item for ash? Do i get it from buying him from steam or the in-game store? 
---
Yeah but let's be real, anger can easily get to you, we all have our bad times but i always try and have a positive attitude. It sucks some people just happen to be a salt factory, nothing we can do.
---
They can, but then you get a face full of survivors teabagging you and the illusion the game was trying to achieve disappears.
---
You‚Äôre the killer who hooks someone, looks away for 5 seconds and doesnt see someone then goes back to the hook and calls it ‚Äúsoft patrolling‚Äù. Get üëè Better üëè At üëè The üëè Game.
---
I mean.. If you're running by other survivors or allowing objectives to be completed, in order to kill one specific guy..then you're tunneling, if you're not an idiot.. You're gonna go for the guy that's injured/been hooked already. It's much easier to pick people off one by one than it is to try and make the game "fun" for survivors. That's not your job. Your job is to feed the giant spider in the sky, and if you're opponents are upset with you.. You're probably doing just that. Don't let some salty asshole change your play style. You clearly won. Water off a ducks back, brother. ü¶Ü 
---
You shouldnt assume success either.  That's why the saying "a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" exists.  Always err on the side of caution.  Since you're not guaranteed to down the uninjured survivor, why not take what is guaranteed and just keep the pressure up by keeping a survivor on the hook?
---
Yeah it would, but to be honest i don't like the hatch stand off
---
Just improve if the killer ‚Äúsoft patrols‚Äù you and only goes for you and ignores everyone else 4Head. Its your fault for getting tunneled! 
---
reddit killers never cease to amaze me.
---
Tapp is DLC, so you can't buy it in game so it's not an exclusive cosmetic.
---
Would be nice if you got some bits for it. Wed see more solos out there earning bits to support streamers
---
Payday was Friday. 
---
Let‚Äôs get it fellas.
---
From what I can tell it seems his head is still there it's just that the body thats not loading so I'd say validate your files and it should fix it.
---
I laugh at those people 
---
Seriously it's just a game unless your on some competition where's there's money involved you have little reason to throw a fit
---
When dose ash come out
---
why does ash not have an infinity gauntlet cosmetic?
---
Should be out now, released around noon today EST
---
My SF works. Might want to test it in KYF
---
Wait I got an update 
---
You can buy him with real money ($4.99) or the shards you get for leveling up. If you buy him with real money, you get an extra cosmetic which is his robot hand but blue.

Oh okay thanks
---
Nah, that‚Äôs a real Ash cosmetic and Clown cuts off your finger in his mori so this in fact real. I used to be a Clown main and this may be the only thing that brings me back.
---
I dont even go to the gates. If they wanna stand there cool. Ill go break pallets or something. 
---
I was surprised when I got it. I think you have to have more than 11 hooks. Cause when you hook someone you get 700 bp. 500 for hook and 200 for hook phase. Times that by 3 gives you a maximum of 2100 bp per surv for sacrifice. And times that by 4 to get 8400 bp. 
---
So now that I look at it, you might have to get all 12 hooks if my math is correct
---
&gt; Not my job to make sure other people have fun
---
no one care about your job and no one ask you to make DS stronger than it is ow. People are just saying that it's no underpowered.
---
How tho? I think deliverance is better tbh
---
Yeh. Mah dude just got Adept Ash
---
I got him on PS4 but don't think I got the cosmetic. I used the ps store
---
I got to buy ash
---
same here
---
So go pick up a book and/or movie or comic and educate yourself.
---
But then I have do leave my p3 Dwight

Imagine being this angry over someone asking a harmless question lmao
---
I got that though just felt like making the joke all the same, nonetheless I'd be interested in such personally as I'd like some more means to be able to hide from a Killer over running, but I am not as well versed in DBD to know for certain how many allow for good hiding play.
---
It‚Äôs not a few seconds, it‚Äôs until they get downed
---
Ghost face is already in the game, so im pretty sure they didnt get the license.
---
Its the Legion. Bunch of masked edge kids, 4, one for each movie, the default weapon is also the default weapon of ghost face their trademark are wounding stabs, their mori has also shared motives, the stabbing trough a hand raised in defense (scream 4), and generallly the gutting of the victim (pretty much in any of the movies). I guess they asked for a license but didnt get it, so made their own.
---
MoM and Adrenaline have actually been beneficial to me so far. Have only died once in all the games I‚Äôve already played today and that‚Äôs because I killed myself so my friends could leave with their items they found.
---
I usually don‚Äôt get found by the killer until the end so it really helped being able to be chased, get away, heal, then he chased again and get out even with No One Escapes Death. I was able to take an extra hit and then when the generators boosted up I was able to escape with the speed boost.
---
Had someone being a little tbagging jerk to me while I was struggling with a killer I wasnt good at or use. They all escaped but she tbagged every chance she got. End game I asked why? Not mad just really I didnt do anything toxic. She apologized and said it wasnt me just having a bad day.
---
I like that I don't have to waste time saving someone when everybody is still alive. Generators are usually ignored in my survivor games, so I always focus. 
---
Plus, when I get hooked first, my chances are so nice, I can't help it 
---
Meat plant rave!
---
What would those be?
---
I‚Äôm not angry? Should have I called you something really dumb? I‚Äôll go edit my comment so it sound more sarcastic.
---
You have to look at it as percentages.  Lets say you have a 60% chance of hitting a healthy survivor twice and then hooking them.  And you have a 75% chance of hitting an injured survivor once and hooking them.  It's pretty obvious what the right choice is.  People complain about tunnelling for only one reason: they are butthurt that they get eliminated from a game quickly.   This makes me happy. 
---
Cool, so there is some degree of counterplay then, assuming you came with a one-shot tool.
---
It's my understanding that efficiency is the rate at which your toolbox gets used up against the amount of repairs it can do on a gen. If you look next to your toolbox icon while you are repairing, there is a little bar that depletes as you use it. If your efficiency is higher, you'll be able to do more repairs before it wears out.
---
I hope so. That would be dope. 
---
Who took a dump in ur cereal bro
---
Hatch standoff shouldn't be a thing. Its such bad game design that just promotes an unfun ending for everyone involved.
---
You‚Äôre the one who is taking a sarcastic comment way to seriously.
---
Im chillin haha wbu grumpy butt
---
I'm sorry what???  LOL I have no idea where that comment came from.  PLease stick to the topic we are discussing.
---
Yeah theres a few, the clown has one that gives you exhaustion for like 30 seconds if you touch the gas. Huntess has 2, one for 30 and one for like 90 if she hits you with a ranged hatchet.

Just check the hands option for him next time you can. It replaces his head customization slot.

He looks at like a hand so it‚Äôs close enough in my book.

You could very easily argue that Borrowed Time ensures a similar level of immunity although in a smaller time period. If you have a problem, don't just re-hook the guy again. It is only very strong in the end-game(it is a waste of a perk slot until then), like Borrowed Time but unlike Borrowed time, has only one use. If you think Decisive Strike is really powerful but don't think Borrowed Time is, you are a hypocrite.
---
Ayyyyyy a guy getting angry at his dumbness
---
Was there a new feature making it so I can't change my "Ready"/"Unready" status after a certain amount of time?   
---
It used to automatically switch to "Ready" at the 5 second mark. But now sometimes my button goes kinda blank (well before the 5 second mark) and won't let me select Ready or Unready at all.
---
Vinc3ntvega and the *Mo fugga U* would appreciate your humor. Check him out, you'd be hard pressed to find a more entertaining DbD streamer.
---
Legion has a turn radius of a 747. Its worse than hillbillys chainsaw. 
---
They even have it for PS4 go figure! 
---
He is right though, kind of. What he means is that due to how the game views hits after a blink, they are considered a part of her power (if she blinked). That's why you get a score event for lethal blinks
---
Lol BHVR would be so much richer if they had better cosmetic designers. More puppet-hand level cosmetics, less recolours and stupid shit like increasing Adam's hair by an inch.
---
If you get the link could you link me? Thanks
---
Clearly nurse is just sooo weak she needs all the help she can get /s 
---
If you've managed to reduce my infinite loading screens by even 10% I thank you deeply, devs
---
oh it's a good thing I get 2 euros a day at school. gonna buy him on Friday :D cant wait my GROOVY BOI
---
It does not give you the edurance effect when full heath.
---
A link? What do you mean? It‚Äôs in the in-game store
---
Yeah, people are pretty seriously over-estimating it I think. It's one extra hit per game, and only usable a ways into the match. 
---
I get what he is saying but that mechanic seems to be applied somewhat arbitrarily.
---
You get MoM for a hag teleport hit. I think they just need to be more clear/straightforward with their perk descriptions.
---
It's "La La La-La-La-La-La"
---
like a video, cant play the game rn so I wanna see some...I'll check YT...he has voice lines when you select him :o GROOVY.
---
Definitely. They need to fix the nurse issue too, since blink hits are the only real viable way to do damage and the perk shouldn't be completely negated by that
---
While I would admittedly want a DLC Chapter/Paragraph of Telltale's the walking dead, I wouldn't want to play as Clementine, as it would imply that the Entity took her. The ending to season four was that she survived, and personally, I would prefer to keep thinking that she lived as well as anyone could in the apocalypse. However, like I said, I wouldn't say no to a Telltale Walking dead DLC. Maybe Lee instead, judging that he's dead in the real world? 
---
I just played a match as Freddy and mettle of man did not wake up the ash I was chasing. So one of us experienced a glitch and it was probably me honestly. Wouldn‚Äôt make much sense the other way around
---
Oh haha, the look and flavor text made it sound like his Miami life and I just assumed they said Jacksonville to avoid isn't legal issue, plus he references Jacksonville in the show. XD
---
This.
---
I can get it up by tomorrow but i'm sure there will be data mines by then. But regardless, i will post one just for you! (:
---
DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRNNN!
---
I mean the reveal had motherfucking Bruce Campbell so...
---
In my opinion, it seems like what you're doing is fine. The notification that someone was unhooked is a signal for the killer to know that there are probably two survivors in that area, so it might be worthwhile to check out.
---
Camping is when you are standing in front of the hooked survivor, or around the corner, waiting for someone else to come unhook them. Hook patrolling is when you walk around the area where the survivor is hooked, hoping to find someone sneaking up (but to avoid the appearance of camping).
---
Tunneling is when you target the same survivor over and over. Some killers do this right after the survivor is unhooked and still injured.
---
There is nothing wrong with going after an injured survivor. It just makes the game less fun when the person feels like they are being targeted the whole game until they die.
---
Freddy should be a training exclusive killer at this point. 
---
I got banned for asking "Why did you report a killer" Hereported him for no reason. Billy just managed to counter all of his "PRO" jukes.
---
Interesting. Are you on PS4, by chance? I'd like to test this since I've only gotten one Ash today. 
---
No you can‚Äôt. Cash or auric cells only.
---
Oh shit so it only effects basic attacks, good to know
---
But it works on plague if she M1's you while broken correct?
---
How? 
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox one s. If it was a latency issue then it was the only one that happened that Match.
---
&gt;  But I like to secure sacrifices by prioritizing chasing survivors that have already been hooked/injured.
---
Not to make any statement on how you were playing, but an individual survivor stands no chance (unless they're incredibly good runners or have a team with the right perks to save them) if the killer decides to treat it as a 1 v 1 match until they're dead then moves on to their 1 v 1 match with the next survivor 
---
These are actually cool
---
Killer queue is super short 
---
What platform?
---
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm allowed to post twitch clips but here is clown mori animation with Ash https://clips.twitch.tv/IncredulousBigHedgehogPeanutButterJellyTime
---
Survivor. He's from the Evil Dead/Army of Darkness Movies, and the Ash vs Evil Dead TV show.
---
I think he might quietly speak in some of the groaning, but he does squeal fantastically when he gets downed.
---
&gt; Yeah, and now a strategically good move now is not immediately picking up the guy who just got unhooked.
---
Strategy is based upon the concept of "odds" and what gives you the best of said concept. When something is good for you or has the best chance at being good for you, you do it. When it's not, you don't do it. There are always situations where something is not a good strategy and thus should not be done. DS, of all fucking perks, should not be immune to this fact. In every situation with every killer it is not always the best strategy to slug. There are multiple play styles for a reason. Slugging is just one of them.
---
&gt;  And I'm sure the survivor doesn't appreciate getting immediately tunneled off hook forced on them. They have literally no way of playing around it, especially if the teammate farms them. You get to play around the DS &amp; BT.
---
What you say is tunneling is just called kill rushing and nothing more. If a killer spots someone who is injured, the injured person should be downed period, and hooked, period. Unless it is strategically beneficial to use that person as bait or unless you have means of getting the unhooker faster than usual via perks/hex totems. Anything else is illogical. One hit &gt; two hits. It's basic math.
---
When a survivor messes up, he/she should pay for it. A killer shouldn't have to turn off his/her brain to prolong a match on a survivor's behalf by slugging an unhooked person that they come across. There was already a perk which allowed an unhooked survivor to gain some distance and that is Borrowed Time. It's 16 (much better quality) perks vs 4, don't try to act like survivors were at some kind of disadvantage.
---
&gt; DS and BT, both of them are only there to counter tunneling and can be played around easily. Please list me the 5 other perks.
---
I said second chance perks/crutch perks (as in perks which allow you to escape a chase after being out-played or when else someone messes up on your behalf): DS (King of crutch perks), Borrowed Time (good perk, I don't mind it), Deliverance (fine with it, good for anti-camping I suppose), Adrenaline (almost as bad as DS), Unbreakable, Self-Care (second chance of all second chances for getting hit, can heal yourself an infinite amount of times without limit), and now Mettle of Man. I can bring this up to eight now that I think about it with Sprint Burst (killer has found you using his skill? Nope.. you get to prolong the chase) but I'll just stick to seven. Of those seven the only one I really resent is DS, Adrenaline is a close second though.
---
&gt; And you also get that with Blood Warden (so you don't open the gate immediately and 99% it till someone gets hooked) NOED (you don't have any indicators for it till someone gets hit, so you need to clense the totem every game or risk getting hit with it) nurse's calling (you don't want to ever heal in the killer's terror radius) spirit fury (the only indicator you can have is the killer running enduring) BBQ (you assume they have it and get into a locker/stay in range/hide behind a gen) adrenaline (if you down someone and don't know where anyone else is then you usually want to hook the guy) borrowed time (don't tunnel). There is a lot of perks that you just assume people have and have to play around them, singling out DS out of all of them isn't fair.
---
Ah yes, we Blood Warden, the perk that depends on what survivors do at the end game, so easily countered by just waiting to 100% after the hook is done. No need to waste a whole fucking minute of your time doing it either.
---
NOED: Indeed a crutch perk (the only crutch perk of killers) that mostly lower-skilled killers use. So easily to counteract that it's a shame, like all Hex totems. 
---
Nurse's Calling isn't a crutch perk at all. BBQ has what.. five different counters to it (and two of them you don't even need a perk for)? And I mean hard-counters, as in if you do them the killer can't use BBQ at all. DS has no hard counter to it other than.. yep, don't hook them within 60 seconds. When are the other 4 counters to DS, Killers? It'll never happen, I'll spare you the suspense. They didn't even want Enduring to hard counter it. Apparently one perk doing so was just too hard on survivors.
---
Nice to know! Thanks!
---
Shoot, I was worried they had just mixed up shards and cells. Oh well! Just got a free killer and survivor like two weeks ago anyway so can't complain. Thanks!
---
Oh that's true I forgot that gives co-op points now 
---
I do but not cosplay related lol. This was my first cosplay I‚Äôve done in a long time but I‚Äôm glad it was so well received.

The Purge is honestly a mid tier killer. Use her to figure out her many weaknesses. 
---
If you struggle against her than I can't really say much except git gud. 
---
I did not üòîüëäüèª
---
Well he's like that for a reason, everyone who doesn't speak English, this makes makes no sense to them, so that
---
hillbilly and plauge are both m1 killers, you arent getting to get chainsaws on people who actually loop unless if they are in a pallet deadzone and plague is pretty much an m1 killer that can turn into a machine gun; spirit fury and enduring is a good pick on these guys for that reason.
---
The thing about sabo perks is that they are IMPOSSIBLE to balance. They can either be really shit or really fucking OP. 
---
Regardless, its never fun for killers to vs sabo squads and if there are any solo players in the group they'd just get pissed at people for not doing gens.
---
The only way i'd balance it is make it anti tunnel. "If you are downed within 20/25/30 seconds of being unhooked, the closest two hooks are broken." Still situational, but really helpful for lower ranks who get camped and tunnelled all the time.
---
Honestly the plague is a very well balanced and dare I say fun killer to play as. As a survivor it can take quite abit of getting used to. That being said I feel like the corrupt is fine. It gives a new object to gameplay and offers a decision for survivors.
---
I get you. I'm a survivor main but I play killer sometimes. I believe I'm rank 12 right now as killer. But I try to play as fair as possible, avoiding tunneling and camping and i dont nod at them every second. The only time i start to get toxic is if a group of survivors wants to play toxic. 
---
Probably because you are not supposed to go down when full hp by a basic atack / which means noed may counter it - rip :&lt; /

What's your username! It's just nice to follow fellow dbd fans lol, you used to cosplay in the past? :0

Thank you sir. Kinda funny how people were so scared DS v2 was coming now people won't shutup about how garbage it is lol definitely underwhelming 
---
Bricky loves this type of shit. He‚Äôs actually streaming right now if you want to check him out. 
---
Thanks! Happy cake day homie
---
Okay this ain‚Äôt it 
---
I love how people hate on my legion even when I do something as stupid as Distressing Thrill of the Hunt and some other random stuff, I forget currently. Like...I don't moonwalk you, I don't tunnel you, I don't camp. Why Do I get hate when I just mess around?
---
they really outdid themselves
---
**Groovy**
---
That‚Äôs my man. He‚Äôs lookin like.. every single episode of his show. 
---
It wouldn't be if they spent more money on fixing their game instead of new cosmetics. I know they have different areas of the team for different things but the cosmetic design seems to have more people than it should when the game is barely playable in the state it is now. 
---
This speaks to my soul.
---
Was trying to do a Myers daily today and this Jeff was purposely going out of his way to blind me - like I wasn't even chasing him and he was ninja jumping in front of me with the blind.
---
I don't complain about flashlights - they are a valid part of the game but at that point its bullying.
---
Is that billy
---
Yea he is I‚Äôm going to get him have a good day 
---
They look better on paper than they play in game. 
---
How do you mean people don't play her right? Genuinely interested, I'm a fan of DBD but don't have much knowledge in these things.
---
I just did one round to get a daily challenge with Hag, and honestly, it was one of the most fun killer games I've ever had. Just about managed to get every survivor (and I do mean *just*).
---
This is a well thought out and balanced response, which is better than 95% of the comments about the issue.  You have avoided all the emotional responses everyone else is buried in and focused on just gameplay design.
---
I live in NY and I get around 100-150 ping to most countries in Europe. South America? 300 ping every time, I may just region lock my router myself.
---
Sounds like angrypug, the #1 child of the dbd streaming community. 
---
Thank you so much for replying. Got it to work - think that particular match was bugged.
---
First time they had cosmetics on a sponsored character
---
What do you get for the event? 
---
there is like 8 killers that hard counter this perk and on top of it you have to go through three basic attacks so it can activates AND the killer can see you if you're at full health and further than 16m. So yeah the perk isn't really that good
---
Tall grass and hard corners are your best friend and worst enemy. So much fear, so much joy
---
I have knowledge of breaking line of sight. It's a bit harder when it's literally a spray and pray concept that can go over walls and shit.
---
I also feel like there's a bug because it has come through walls and hit me before I swear.
---
Here's my way to fix this issue:
---
|1) Go to Steam|2) In the game library right-click DBD|3) Go to properties...|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|4) Then click on "Local Files" or whatever.|5) Click on "verify integrity of game files"|6) Wait for it to verify and, in positive case it'll say that some files are missing and that they're going to be installed...then just wait|
---
**Take note** that my Steam is ITALIAN, so something may be different...
---
This is so fuckin great!!!
---
Never bought Auric cells so quickly
---
This is why I said "at least in theory." I realize that the game's balance is in a relatively poor state compared to other competitive games. These problems are difficult to avoid in asymmetric games, since they are considerably more difficult to balance.  
---
  
---
It's not just the streamers who change their behavior, but many of the random players as well. I just used them as an example because most people have seen them play at some point. How often did you really see 4 DS? I've seen it probably once in over 500 hours, despite DS being arguable the best perk in the game before the rework. I'm not trying to tell you that killers have it easy. I've faced the Seal Team 6 Squadette with flashlights and DS and insta-heals. I'm just pointing out that many of the players I've played with would do things like refuse to use DS because they knew it was broken and unfair. I have been farmed off the hook more times than I can count, and I would say maybe about half the time the killer goes for the guy who farmed me instead. There are a sizable number of players who will do things in the interest of fairness.

Oh calm down dwight

Well here we go my finally complete collection It took a while and after some feedback from my first post I went back altered some originals and got round to the other perks
---
This includes all of the perks up to this point including the plague and even ash!

If you would like to download please go ahead here : [https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w6l5w65jf7mkuhb/AAAE4o3YFTUaZxm8rh1WDOoHa?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/w6l5w65jf7mkuhb/AAAE4o3YFTUaZxm8rh1WDOoHa?dl=0)
---
I hope you like them and as always any feedback is appreciated :)
---
See you in the fog! 
---
Honestly it's just that I feel it's not a very skilled ability. Much like Legion's Feral Frenzy. It feels like an easy street ability that you don't really have to try to use to get a hit. 
---
Compare it to say Billy's Saw or Huntress's Hatchet. If I get downed by that? It's skill. 
---
it‚Äôs a tv :(
---
don't feed her power? every time i played against her and a survivor got sick without being broken, they quickly ran to clean themselves. please, for the love of god, do a gen if you aren't broken 'cause the bitch will have that broken shit the entire time if you are desperate to just get rid of the sickness.
---
Mettle of Man is actually very useful. It helped me against NOED 2 times already. Although its kind of bullshit that Nurse's blinks doesn't count and you won't be able to use it against nurse at all.
---
I'm loving Flip-Flop and Unbreakable tbh.
---
 It's actually awesome when some rando bodyblocks the hook too early, and it pays off in a huge way.
---
Your the one holding the game hostage
---
Go fix a gen or do something
---
You probably dont deserve the hatch anyways
---
There is, it's getting a second season on your favorite anime. 
---
Complains about looping as spirit while also using VERY good addons? If it was a wraith or trapper I'd understand (But not agree) but a spirit? 
---
All furiously stabbing the machine
---
If you can only win by tunneling, I think that says more about you than the perk
---
I don't know what to tell you. Get good matches barely using Corrupt Purge all the time. 
---
All you literally have to do is Vommy and spin her a bit. It's spray and pray. The whole thing is like a less skilled version of Huntress hatchet.
---
There's no aiming skill required and I think that's what bugs me about it when it turns into Corrupt Purge.
---
I enjoyed killing Kenny like the animal he was.
---
Always, if you're farther than 36 meters away
---
Until you are downed again. It is essentially what an obsession perk SHOULD be. 
---
Ash confirmed for killer? 
---
I know. I guess that‚Äôs why nobody bothered looking. Haha. 
---
&gt;The problem with this is that it assumes tunneling is 100% on the Killer. The Killer shouldn‚Äôt be punished for Survivors playing poorly and unhooking a teammate 5 seconds after they got hooked.
---
Why shouldn't they? Survivors take an anti-tunneling perk to punish tunneling.
---
And no it doesn't. The game already punishes survivors that use unsafe unhooks.
---
Ok, I'll say it... IT'S OVER 9000!
---
Just played another match mettle of man didn‚Äôt wake people up 
---
I've been getting the same thing as well at 15 seconds
---
Which is why it's an effective strategy. Of course I don't treat it exclusively as a 1 v 1, I'll never run past a survivor doing a generator to chase an injured one. And I usually will let other survivors take hits for their buddies, cause I think that's a dope play style on their part lol.
---
What? I don‚Äôt live in the est time zone so I have to wait till today and it is out and i have jizzed
---
E N D    M Y    S U F F E R I N G

read this too late :'(
---
Shape.
---
I dunno about that. I'm green ranks and I've had games where I get three kills with three hooks each and the last person escapes after being hooked once or twice and I'll only safety pip. 
---
OK? Didn't need to know that, but thanks 
---
There was no reason to use corrupt purge except in very specific situations where you'd not have it anyway.
---
I also didn‚Äôt need to know your opinion about ‚Äúthat girl‚Äù. 
---
Guess they will buff his voice in a later batch, on another note the plague speaks now in the lobby. 
---
Just because you can understand a sentence's meaning, doesn't mean it has perfect coherency. What universe do you live in? 
---
Yeah. Last time I kept a close eye on it. It happened at the 15 second mark. Not sure why that‚Äôd turn off the selector if you haven‚Äôt hit ‚ÄúReady‚Äù yet.  
---
...none of this is accurate
---
O LMAO ITS FLIP FLOP but either way only strong in situations. Can be good at high ranks or in a swf. Interested to see it in action cause I thought solidarity was good and now I don‚Äôt like it
---
So sad it‚Äôs not the chainsaw...
---
Typically when Ash is soaked in blood, the chainsaw is attached.
---
Oh well. 
---
Someone's a bit too upset over an opinion that doesn't match their own 
---
Everytime we're getting closer to god
---
M8 you don‚Äôt know what a white knight is lmfao
---
His channel is lame as shit anyway. I'm not a fan. You aren't missing anything
---
Tbh, a Nea looping you is probably worse than said abhorrent act.
---
I‚Äôm not upset, just trying to tell you that your ‚Äúopinion‚Äù is not needed. 
---
So... rip all m1 killers then unless they use STBFL or some hex perk?
---
I'm still confused about how the new DS works. Why does it change who the obsession is?
---
she's just gay

---
If they unhook right in front of you then yea, but why go way out of your way to hunt the disadvantaged survivor who needs to waste gen time healing up?
---
&gt;nah, that's tunneling. what exactly is that survivor supposed to do to counter you turning the game into a 1 v 1 against them where they're starting at their weak state?
---
To counter? Not much really but, he should be shouting and blaming his teammates for putting him in that situation. Funny enough they rather blame the killer. 
---
Don't you mean it sucks to get farmed by your teammate?
---
gdi man, gotta reawaken these feels :(
---
What is a m1 killer?
---
"What now?", "Alright", "Groovy" and one more that I don't remember
---
It was just a really bad design, but perk itself is not toxic I guess.
---
CLEMENTINE LETS GO!!!!!!!!!!
---
So camping is fair? 
---
It's BS that it works on basic attacks. That sucks hard for m1 killers, you know, the guys who attack with *literally the only attack they have*.
---
At least you don't have the old BNP description like in the Italian version
---
I want Nurse changes, but not Billy changes. What's wrong with Billy?
---
Killer was AFK but I don't even care as it allowed me to observe Ash's body language. One thing that stuck to me was how Ashy Slushy stuck his head inside the generator and chomp on it sometimes.
---
What is that add-on? I don't know much about Legion.
---
uwu
---
20 seconds in the game, instant locker cause of the slightest heartbeat. U are playing the wrong character dude. Change to Dwight
---
I get ya. I run those 2, self care and Sprint Burst. I hit gens, get in maybe a chase or 2, but mainly gen fix and be stealthy. It‚Äôs worked so far
---
It doesn't help track footsteps, dude. Stop telling people to not complain about bugs. You are supposed to be able to hear footsteps. It doesn't matter if there are perks that help with different aspects of tracking. That is literally irrelevant when it comes to the bug.
---
&gt; he should be shouting and blaming his teammates for putting him in that situation (unhooking when is not safe
---
I don't know how you're reading their submission as saying this is the case. It seems pretty clear to me that no matter when the survivor is unhooked or what hes' doing he's going back to down that survivor again. 
---
OP is welcome to correct me.
---
Yeah you‚Äôre just supposed to play alone! Also in other games where team communication is key, like overwatch, you have to play alone as well! Because good team communication is unfair and reduces my chances of winning as a killer!
---
Obvious /s
---
r/iamverysmart
---
Super easy way to secure a kill
---
Op directly said they‚Äôd go after the unhooked. This isn‚Äôt even a question of safe hooks or unsafe hooks, he‚Äôs literally choosing the weaker person instead of looking for the other.
---
Sounds like you play with crutches
---
Bro. I know it doesn‚Äôt help with that. Jesus fuck lol. It helps in general with hearing survivors better. That‚Äôs all I had to say.
---
Is the killer frame rate still not playable? And increasing the max camera sensitivity would probably help.
---
Would be so cool to see killers that are actually just straight up humans. No masks or anything.
---
Just got hit by a Freddy while Mettle of Man was active, didn't get woken up by it. Anyone else?
---
Could say the same about your post. If you need second chance perks to enjoy the game then it's an issue with you.
---
Because he's a cool character from a well know horror franchise that was one of the inspirations for DbD.
---
Nah the blood isn't bright enough.
---
I'm trying to find people to test this on. Are you on PS4?
---
Try loading the game from a PS4 instead of PS3 /s
---
Jewelry store
---
Yeah I do lul. The concept of white knighting applies here but instead of with women and men it‚Äôs survivors and killers. He‚Äôs white knighting for killers 
---
it's actually how devs are trying to make DS to work, if you're the obsession and have DS, the killer will just slug you, it makes more sense if survivors with non-obsession perks are the obsession so the ones with obsession perks (aka DS, 'cause it doesn't apply for Sole Survivor and OoO) to be "protected"
---
With the perk of the hits Ash Speaks in the match try it 
---
I don't really have fun tunneling people as I don't get any real chase out of it. For me the fun of the game comes out of chasing people, and I get none of that when I just down someone right after they get unhooked and slap them back on the hook. There isn't anything they can really do in that situation, so it's not a chase.
---
&gt;thinking that I could have probably made better choices so I will do better next time
---
I mean, aside from never going down in the first place (which against a competent killer it's not realistic) there isn't anything you can do. Unless someone has BT or you have DS, if you are getting tunneled off hook you aren't really playing the game. If you don't mind not getting to play the game, then that's fine. I'm not one to judge.
---
&gt;I don't even really notice it
---
You're not a very empathetic person. Other people might be.
---
&gt;where do you get the idea
---
Multiple reddit posts, steam forums, other game forums, most of the streams I've joined and their communities find tunneling boring for both sides, numerous dbd discord servers I've been find it boring, my own experiences, experiences my friends told me about. I have a pretty decent pool of information from which I've drawn my opinion that a lot of people doesn't like not getting to play the game. Quite a shocker, I know.
---
Wow thank you the game is great now!!
---
That sounds like a team problem to me, you know, the other team's. I don't know how you guys expect to benefit from each other's good plays while trying to escape consequences for each other's bad ones. There's already a game mode for player who want to win or lose solely on their own merit, it's called Killer. 
---
I beg to differ. Ash is an event in that more people are playing today, and less are DC'ing because they want to lvl him up for his teach-ables. Sure there's no 2x bp event going on, but for the first time in weeks, I've been able to play full games consistently without some ass-hat DC'er. Feels like an event to me because people are actually having fun and playing the game. God damn I missed this feeling. 
---
What the fuck, the DS stun time is back to *five seconds*??
---
^(moto moto)
---
but then again it really isn't that usefull with it only being one use and then aura seeing downside also hatchets don't count towards it
---
But this OP is not talking about an unhooking occurring 2 meters behind them. He's very obviously saying that he goes back to tunnel down the unhooked person no matter what. Given that, according to you there are no good team plays because that person will never be safe
---
The locker idea is awesome, it‚Äôd be so cool to have a different type of ‚Äústealth‚Äù killer who can ambush survivors by popping out of hiding spots. 
---
Missed opportunity to have it in his mouth
---
For Ash I honestly see no excuse. I understood why it was a thing for the other DLCs since you could get them for Shards or buy them seperately. It was an added bonus. There's no reason for a bonus when buying something that you have to buy.
---
It's like a Gamestop Exclusive but you're not even going to Gamestop.

that's some low effort there.. a bit disappointing

Answer the question, Mr Tunnel Vision. Why arent you in a chase with someone else or defending generators? Why are you back at the hook?

Thank you for the reply. I've been trying to get this one for a while, how long did it take you?

plump boi
---
Lol
---
I just hit ash
---
PSA:
---
You can body block hooks to force the killer to give you MOM stacks no matter what killer.
---
Also, if MOM is active you can heal to 99% to prevent your aura being read, once you get hit and get to a loop from the boost you can then fully heal.
---
Lol 
---
Now enduring is a MUST
---
That's the thing about the obsession, man. Some perks really want you to focus them, some really want you to avoid them. If you expect people are going to run MOM and DS all day every day then try STBFL and Rancor to counter. Gotta get that 4D chess brain going.
---
But also it's not like MOM is *that* powerful. It's one freebie hit that you only get near the middle/end of the game and while I haven't tested this I think window grabs might overwrite MOM. Needs testing.
---
No, it's been like this for every DLC since the in-game store launched. It just takes a little while for the various store pages to go live.

You can body block hooks to force them to give you a stack. Hillbilly can still be forced to give MOM stacks if against a survivor that loops optimaly.

It only counts basic attacks, not any attack that uses a killers power. So, Nurse's blink attack, Legion's frenzy, Leatherface's chainsaw, Plague's puke, Huntress's hatchets, etc. don't trigger MoM.
---
thats the screw you add on, butt fills every survivor with salt
---
1. There are a FUCK ton of second chance perks in the game ( ds, dead hard, unbreakable, deliverance, borrowed time) . That does not make them fun.
---
2. I didn't even say the free hit was the fun part of the perk. Satisfying, yes but ultimately one extra hit in exchange for permanent injury/ aura till downed is not very exciting IMO. The aura is the fun part about the perk. Knowing  the killer can see your every move is terrifying, ESPECIALLY against low terror radius killers like Micheal or pig.

Never said he was camping. But a safe unhook is pretty meaningless. It doesn't matter where you are on the map and what you're doing. If you wanna go back for that person, you're gonna get them easy. 
---
&gt; but you're still mostly relying on a moralistic argument and that's tough, most players just want to 'win'. 
---
Perhaps it is. But that places too much focus on a 1 v 1 mindset, which is not how I perceive the devs intending the game to be played

How the fuck is it a anti tunnel perk now? That's about as much of a bullshit lie as saying the borrowed time timer or the legions frenzy attack mend timer is anti tunnel. The shitty fucking killers still tunnel. It isn't anti anything. It's chase and facecamp until dead because they used a perk in the game.
---
It is easy to avoid messages like that by not Tunneling.
---
I think he cuts off the other hand... Sry
---
Cosmetics for a licensed character is great news. Maybe we can get something for the other ones in the future
---
I'll actually see about posting that tomorrow as a bonus.
---
I mean, yeah.. I didn‚Äôt say they should have the chainsaw instead.
---
Just saying it feels like something‚Äôs missing about him.
---
I like how you're being downvoted for asking a question. Reddit people smh
---
Because that's an insane amount of power for 1 perk, the first time it can be argued it's stopping a tunneler, but a second time is easily back to crutch territory and can widely punish a lot more than just tunnelers.
---
Take into account what stage the game is in if you have to activate this perk twice too, it's less of a fuck you to tunneling 1 person early and more of a fuck you for being any killer trying to wrap up the game.
---
He cuts off the right hand for sure (I checked), which IS the puppet hand. So we won‚Äôt know until we see it. 
---
Welcome to the way things are now 
---
Apparently it‚Äôs really quiet too.
---
No it's just efficient, it's in your best interest to eliminate the number of your opponents as quickly as possible in a game about time management. You can still get the maximum amount of hook events even if you don't give them each turns on the hook, in order. If you're arguing that using an efficient strategy rather than taking a handicap(targeting some one healthy) is desperate then we can agree to disagree I guess, feels mostly like a moralistic argument tbh. Those are hit and miss depending on the person.  
---
&gt;Also, I don‚Äôt steal money from children just because it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù.

Me neither, but survivor players aren't children.

100 upvotes wtf.... Thanks Guys!

are there any outside the lobby?

You need real money to buy auric cells, so you can only buy Ash with real money. Your comment might confuse people
---
I'm guessing you're a console player too?  The days we had the newer queue system with the timers I could actually play survivor lol.  You could swf and get 1 or 2 minute queues.  When they revert to the older system we're back to unplayable wait times that make you either switch to killer or play something else.  Really unique, I've never owned a game that didn't allow itself to be played.
---
Behavior please give us a puppet version of every Survivor in the game and let us put on puppet shows for the Killers.
---
Not sure what you mean by "making sure others don't get to play the game".  Killing off one survivor right at the start of the game is by far the best way to completely wreck the survivor's game.  It makes them frustrated and worried about being able to get all the gens done.  Making someone not able to play the game IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE GAME.  Maybe you don't get this, but yeah kill the survivors is highly recommended.   
---
Your comments about Reddit et al is typical of gaming forums.  Since the beginning of time, forum whores have never been able to understand that the most posted complaints and hot topics have nothing to do with what the majority of players think about the game.  Forums/Reddit exist in a bubble of people who sit around all day validating each other's views.  The MAJORITY of players rarely if ever post on forums, so you really have no idea (and neither do I) what the majority of players want.  
---

That might be the case, if this game had OG Freddy. Which it doesn't.
---
I know man... I myself get downvoted for the dumbest shit sometimes. And I see other people get downvoted for even dumber shit. I saw someone very calmly and politely make a comment about what a perk does, but they got it slightly wrong,and even admitted it later on. Then they got downvoted to oblivion. Or people will make a joke and people flip on them. It amazes me how brainless people can be when it comes to downvoting. If I‚Äôm trolling I totally get why I‚Äôm downvoted. But half the time people are being completely harmless and people hop on the downvoting bandwagon. I hate it lol
---
I strongly appreciate you QT
---
Sounds like you're taking the strategy a bit personally, it's just efficiency dude. I get why it rustles your jimimies, I don't like being rushed out of a match either, but it's hard to blame my opponent when they rush me out of it, either through gens or kills. 
---
Have you tried soft resetting? If that doesn't work try calling customer support 
---
To add, for tunneling I only consider something tunneling if the killer purposely ignores other people right in front of them. Earlier today I was running in front of a legion to get him away from an Ash so the guy could heal, he didn‚Äôt even hit me while I was blocking him, just moved and went after Ash.
---
It's not 'mindless' just because you say it is. I see a lot of moralistic shaming here, not a ton of good arguments for why it's not in a player's best interest to rush the objective, competitively speaking. 
---
No it is scummy. You basically preventing a player from playing the game. There are other thing you can do as killers even when you don't chase someone. But nothing survivor can do when he's on a hook. In fact you get extra point for existing while survivors don't. That's why killer BP is always higher.
---
So yeah, scummy. 
---
Ah okay, I thought they released for purchase with shards, like they are now. I didn't know they were at one point only for $$$
---
I saw a pic with the skin inventory for the hand, and the are the puppet, the wood hand, blue and prestige hand, and 2 more hands that I don‚Äôt recognize, the picture is in bad resolution 
---
Based on your logic, Mori‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt exist, Devour hope shouldn‚Äôt exist, Make your choice shouldn‚Äôt exist blah blah blah if that‚Äôs what you call ‚Äúefficient‚Äù. There‚Äôs literally perks that were put in the game to assist killers. They‚Äôre all ways to able the killer in applying pressure. Another person also mentioned going after only fresh hooks wastes others time healing... which is exactly right. If the only way you know how to play the game is by going after the recently hooked that is in no way efficient, it‚Äôs desperate.
---
Well quite frankly I don‚Äôt give a shit how true it is, it‚Äôs the 434,876th post in the last month, we get it.
---
thats why i play no blink nurse blindfolded with no add ons or perks, I dont need crutches like these babies on the reddit 4Head
---
Holy shit! I‚Äôm never going to use that again. Pheww! 
---
I don't understand.  DC vs Legion?  Does that really happen?  I've never seen it.  Legion is one of the easier killers to beat, at least for me.
---
You missed what I said. I said heal to 99 then when you hear the TR or see the killer coming tap yourself
---
Well i dont prestige either.. i feel its a waste of BP.. but this suits Ash a lot so i might prestige his character
---
Calm down maybe? The devs can't just "fix" bugs. It's just a tad bit more complicated than that (/s). You screeching about a bug isn't helping in the slightest. They don't do this shit on purpose.
---
So wait, when two people work on a gen, why does it say it‚Äôs decreasing?
---
nah just get better :)
---
&gt; on mistakes like these
---
See, this is the issue we're having here. You keep acting like the unhooking was inherently a mistake, but the point is that it doesn't matter if the save was poorly done or not, this player is going to abandon anything else they were doing, no matter where it was, to down that saved person again and there's really nothing they can do about it.
---
&gt; It's even harder to do it when it's very obvious that there's a double standard when it comes to which side is allowed to rush the objective, and their opponent out of a match.
---
There's definitely a double standard, but the reason that it's more okay for survivors to do it is because there's not much else for them to do.
---
I may not be legally obligated to remind people, BUT NEITHER ARE YOU!!! You are doing just that, you are reminding everyone of something for the thousandth time. We get it, this page is littered with post after post of matchmaking issues. Guess what, every fucking game has issues and in my personal experience this one doesn‚Äôt happen that often. But it happens once in 20 matches to someone and they use the opportunity to crap on the developers and the game that they choose to keep playing despite the fact this is apparently such a terrible issue they need to remind us daily.
---
Well you've said that you enjoy tunneling people to death. Getting people out of the game as fast as possible because you are only going for them the moment they get unhooked and slap them back on the hook immediately makes it so they don't really get to play the game. They don't get any points, they don't get to have a chase because you just down them the moment they get off the hook. That's rather boring as they don't get to do anything. That's what I mean by not letting them play the game.
---
The goal is to kill them, not neccesairly making them not play the game at all.
---
You can do well as killer without tunneling, most really good killers like ScottJund, ZubatLeL or RyanPez that you can find on twitch basically never tunnel and still whipe the floor with all survivor teams. Tunneling really isn't the best way to win in a lot of situations, as you can get more pressure off in other ways.
---
&gt;Since the beginning of time, forum whores have never been able to understand
---
Wowie, you're not slinging insults at me, I think I'd rather not continue this conversation with you.
---
&gt; That's still not a good argument for why the perk shouldn't activate. "Your perk is useless because they are playing a good killer, sorry." It's just bad design.
---
There are ten other killers in the game. Surely you aren't saying that a massive disadvantage should be given to those ten, because of what 4 others MAY do if they exit gates aren't open?
---
Claudettes are good at stealth on darker maps (which are 99% of them). Should killers demand that survivors' stealth perks be nerfed/removed to make up for that one character's strength? All killers need to be considered when survivor perks are made. Or else the game will be even more unbalanced.
---
DS does not have any drawbacks and you can basically sit at the hook and t-bag the killer without worry that you'll get hooked unless he chooses to end his hook momentum/snowball or leave you down and give you what you want (which is to heal to 90% then be picked up). Your bad decisions are suppose to lead to hooks, not get out jail free cards. That in itself is bad design. 
---
&gt; No, the killer wants to kill all of the survivors and needs to apply pressure on the map.
---
To kill someone you need to hook them. Even to mori someone you have to hook them first. A killer must hook, and you know this.
---
&gt; There is nothing that requires you to put the survivors on hook immediately.
---
But there is something that says we should wait a full minute. That is fair to you? Do think killers have time to down someone who is clearly visible to chase around for others who are hiding, for a minute? Up to a possible four minutes per trial?
---
&gt; The perk you are proposing would be an equivelant of DS making you immune to killer's hits, since doing gens is the only possible way for survivors to do their objective.
---
Before I reply to this, what perk are you talking about? I've proposed no perk but I have put stipulations on DS. And yes it should have some sort of stipulations. 
---
&gt; So you should be denied your perk because of random things? So like enduring shouldn't work on certain pallets, bamboozle wouldn't work on some vaults, literally none of these being your fault.
---
All perks should have stipulations. I never said the thing should be denied/removed from existence. I'm saying it should have qualifiers. It doesn't take into account anything that the survivor may do/may not do. It doesn't care if it's the survivor who finds you within 60 seconds. It doesn't care if you didn't come straight back to the hook and was chasing someone else. It doesn't care if the gate is opened. It doesn't care if the survivor is purposely trying to get you to down them just so they and their buddies can DS right away and laugh out the door. It doesn't care if the survivor stayed at the hook and waited for you to come back. It's just a blanket 40-60s of hook immunity. How is this not understood.
---
For BBQ there are qualifiers. The killer can't see you if you at 32 meters or less away, and if you are more than that from the killer you can hide behind gens or in lockers to hide your aura. That's three fucking hard counters and qualifiers. And the killer doesn't get 40-60 seconds of aura reading, it's 3-5 and then it's done. 
---
&gt; The killer can bodyblock the stairs and make you stay close to the hook, which is not your fault at all. Unless you consider getting downed anywhere near the basement your fault, which is not as pallet spawns are RNG and it's not your fault that there was nothing anywhere away from shack for example. Plus with agitation or iron grasp you can get hooked in the basement from like half of the map.
---
I already said that one of the stipulations I'd put on it was that it would activate if a killer was 40 meters or less away. If the killer was more than that away then it *shouldn't* activate, because the you have more than enough time to get away, and hide. If the killer found you it was not your unhooker's doing or the killers, but your own. I also gave three other suggestions. The devs gave zero, and probably didn't want to think of any. 
---
&gt; Have you seen moonwalking? And not only on Legion, people do that to bleed out Borrowed time. People would definitely do that.
---
Would you like to participate in a contest sir? I'll post videos of how many times in 3 hours worth of game play that I've gotten DS'd even after I have initiated a chase with another survivor and only found the unhooked survivor because they did not hide well/or ran at me because they felt so protected by their crutch perk. And you can post videos of how many times within 3 hours of game play that you have received borrowed time and no chase music has initiated even though the killer was behind you because said killer was looking down at the ground? Do you think you would win such a contest? If you don't think you would win, then how are you comparing these two circumstances. One is much more likely than the other.
---
A killer's eyes and ears are everything. We scan for as much information as possible to quickly access a situation to down who we can down as fast as possible in order to achieve hook momentum and snowball it from there, unless there are certain circumstances (key word) that make another target more beneficial to go after.
---
Thanks, I will.
---
If you're tunnelling, which you are, and the survivors say that, they aren't the problem. People are going to be understandably upset you ruin the game for them, it is possible to get 4k without tunnelling.
---
Nah, PC. Sorry. :/
---
If you're debating between using some spare Auric cells or regular cash on Ash, I'd use the Auric cells.
---
Yeah because you prevented them from playing by repeatedly going after them.
---
Does a killer stuck doing nothing for whatever time a survivor are when they are on the hook? No. You can destroy gen, chase other survivors, even if you fail to secure a kill you are playing the game. 
---
It's not the same with survivors who are on the hook again and again. They don't even interact with their controller until struggle phase.
---
Why don't you play survivors and see how you like getting tunnelled yourself? 
---
Yes they do. You don't get their alternative clothes if you unlock them from the in game store instead of buying the DLC.
---
There isn't a need to go about your kills that way.  It's for weak or new players man.  The balance is in our favor as killers at this point.  There's no excuse to still feel the need to play so scummy man.  Sure you get the kill hard tunneling off hook but do you really feel accomplished getting them that way?  Games should be fun and competitive for both sides.  We have plenty of slack at this point to play a more fun engaging game with potential for counterplay and still soundly fuck up our opponents.  This game is supposed to be fun.  That should apply to both sides.  
---
I made the same mistake buying Quentin, didn't get that comfy ass beanie, rip
---
&gt; Based on your logic, Mori‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt exist, Devour hope shouldn‚Äôt exist, Make your choice shouldn‚Äôt exist blah blah blah if that‚Äôs what you call ‚Äúefficient‚Äù.
---
I don't know what you're talking about, what did I post that makes you think I implied Mori's or DH shouldn't exist? Just because there's efficient meta strategies doesn't mean that there shouldn't be alternative perks/mechanics/playstyles, too. In fact some of them are there specifically *because* rushing the objective is the efficient startegy. I'm aware that there's different ways to play and win, that doesn't mean exclude the fact that some are more efficient than others. 
---
Yup. Sure.
---
But then don't you still have your aura displayed if you get away? Or does that not apply anymore when hit? I haven't quite gotten the time to see the actual perk in action.
---
Because your base one did, as did the other guys. But the overall repair speed is still faster. I don't know the actual numbers, but essentially instead of both repairing at 100% speed combined to make 200% you both go to 75% for a total of 150%.
---
I'm not talking about myself but about survivors who I was facing with using this build, it felt grossly OP, more than infinite t3 Myers
---
If only it were that easy..
---
not everything is about reflection. Some of it is pure luck. If you're pig and I need to go to all 4 boxes to get it off and you catch me at the last one, you can bet money ill dc
---
It's a balance decision to have your efficiency drop when working together on a gen. Items and perks can bring it back up.
---
Imagine actually complaining about getting looped on hag, like just place a fucking trap, my dude
---
Isa spirit 
---
You‚Äôre an evil man! :(
---
Fuck off Conky!
---
Have you tried not tunneling and getting the person doing the unhook instead? I heard you're even rewarded for hooking each person at least once instead of ruining one person's experience! 
---
This post made it exactly where it belongs lol.
---
Who has that many spare auric cells?
---
Oh mb, for some reason that icon looked like hag's arm, but also god damn, spirit is very good on loops too
---
I'd ask the same thing but, i guess it's just that some people are assholes?
---
for counterargument: there WILL be an instance where anyone will have to m1 you, even billy will sometimes m1 making it proc almost every game. good survivors dont care that their aura can be seen because theyll be huggng the best loop and you can just heal up to 99 anyway. the killers dont hard counter this perk unless they are downing everyone with their ability, which is inefficient and will probably throw the game.
---
more importantly its like noed, but uncounterable. it rewards farming off hook (and promotes it) and making bad plays, and takes absolutely NO skill to use so it cant even be compared to DH and MOM gets you more distance than any other perk.
---
incase you still dont know how powerful this perk is, imagine noed, but it isnt a hex and gives you an additional 10% movement speed in total. 
---
Killer mains are cowardly, lazy ass who expect things to be handed over to them on silver platter. This and other news at 8pm.
---
Seriously, the amount of bloodpoints survivors get is pathetic. Wglf sucks ass as well

---
Toxic people tend to stick together in the trashcan
---
Flip Flop is a pretty big nerf to honing stone Trappers
---
Self-care is still in the same spot as it has been over the years though some players are opting for iron will or adrenaline instead for a healing perk due to the relative popularity of anti-healing builds amongst killers.
---
The plague has been rated around mid-tier. She aint a bad killer as her vomit can break someone then allow her to M1 them which can really quickly finish the chase but her vomit can be countered with looping around obstacles which can really push her power down. 
---
She is similar to Leatherface where her power can capitalise on exposed survivors that have no nearby pallets, allowing her to down them before they can reach one. Getting everyone sick makes them waste time running to a corner of the map to cleanse themselves but it only takes 6 seconds to cleanse. 
---
Her corrupt gives her 60 seconds of basically an easy short-ranged huntress. It can be devastating for finishing chases quickly but its really weak to being pallet looped as being pallet stunned removes the corrupt purge effect entirely.  
---
Overall a fun killer to play &amp; play against. She is not particularly strong as she deals with looping like any other killer &amp; lacks map pressure but she can certainly waste survivor time &amp; capitalise on survivor faults.
---
Her perks are not that great;
---
Corrupt intervention seems interesting but usually the effect does not work as intended. Survivors either hide until the gen protection leaves or you chase a survivor to a corner of the map, allowing the other survivors to work on gens at the middle.
---
Infectious Freight - Causes survivors to scream in your terror radius when you down someone. Not very effective except on Myers or Nurse. Maybe would work with knock-out but with the new Ash DLC, his perks counter slugging so kind of pointless.
---
Dark Devotion - Hit the obsession &amp; they 32m terror radius &amp; you get 0 terror radius for 20 seconds. Not very good. Can use it for some stealth but 20 seconds doesnt provide much stealth for survivors that are far from you. If they can see you then its pointless aswell. 
---
2 New survivors. 
---
Jane is dummy thicc but her perks are bad. 
---
- Solidarity allows her to heal 50% after healing someone. Not very good unless you are against an anti-heal killer
---
- Head on allows you to stun a killer from fast exit a locker. Can be funny but is a waste of an exhaustion perk. Could be potentially useful for basement saves but questionable.
---
- Poised causes survivor scratch marks to disappear for 10 seconds when a gen is finished. Situational as hell as it relies on gens being popped during a chase or you to finish a gen then disappear. 
---
Ash;
---
Mettle Of Man - Can allow you to block off one hit from a killer that would normally put you in dying state. If you heal aura is permanently shown to killer. Seems really strong as it allows for you to escape a attack from most M1 killers. 
---
Flip-Flop: When a survivor recovers past 50% when slugged they will have 50% progression on wiggle bar when picked up. Heavy counter for slugging &amp; can make slugging survivors painful if no agitation or Iron grasp is used. Potentially a new use for them.
---
Buckle up - Survivors can see aura of slugged survivors from 48m away &amp; can tell how much they have recovered. Healing them from dying to injured shows killers aura to both healer &amp; slugged survivor for 6 seconds. Once again a very strong anti-slug perk.
---
DS got changed to be an anti-tunnel perk. Works for 60 seconds after being unhooked &amp; if the killer picks you up they get stunned for 5 seconds. Skill check occurs during pick-up meaning you cannot get dribbled.
---
Connection problems, maybe u or the killer.
---
Except it's bugged right now and people can tell when you're faking because if you actually do use it there's a glass shattering sound?
---
What exactly is moonwalking? I believe I saw what it meant in another post but cannot find it.
---
I saw someone the other day say you each go to 90% speed. I don‚Äôt know if it drops 10% with each survivor added though. 
---
Imagine arriving at a point in life where one becomes a video game elitist.
---
It‚Äôs okay. You‚Äôll get out of rank 20 someday.
---
Yeah baby, it's me.
---
This is too much power 
---
Well me commenting may stop others or help persuade others to upvote him lessening the blow to his karma.
---
No, you prevented them from playing. Imagine being down at the start then getting downed again as soon as you're unhooked. You've done nothing but being on the hook. 
---
You not holding it against the person dies but mean the person is not scummy, lazy POS. 
---
the bone clapper isn't working this entire time oh my godddd whyyy stop making us waste addon slots aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
I‚Äôm usually only scared if the killer sneaks up on me. So the Pig gives me a lot of jump scares and so does Michael. Also the noise Bubba makes when he chainsaw attacks ( I don‚Äôt know what it‚Äôs called) scares the shit out of me. 
---
I‚Äôm saying she does it regardless if the killer plays like a bot. 
---
Holy fuck that made me burst out laughing. I did not expect that.
---
If they have a mori you shouldn‚Äôt judge them too quickly. Not saying only bad players use mories but many killers can easily pull off a 4K with one. 
---
I'll honestly never kniw
---
Forgive my unculturedness but are dummy think buns attractive on guys?
---
That looks pretty awesome. 
---
It happened when the in game store launched.
---
im not, I wanted that shit outta the game and to never see it again
---
Could you explain what his perk does
---
It also doesn't have OG ash
---
Happened to me yesterday. Good to see i‚Äòm not the only one 
---
Yes! Very much so. I‚Äôm probs a bit bias cuz of my homosexual nature but... yes!
---
Yep. 30 minutes for games where the killer just camps and tunnels you. Sucks.
---
I get what you‚Äôre saying but I just thought of the umpteen times where I found a person in a corner and just annihilated them with either of those 2 powers. 
---
No. Given most survivors will loop that pallet a few times, the pause between you having to recover from the missed hit is just lost time and so is the pallet stun timer. Being stunned means you don't get the wipe animation sure but you have a pallet stun to deal with. As dumb as it sounds, knowing when to swing will come with practice. You'll learn when to hit so that it will connect.
---
Maybe dc on hook? That counts as death/kill
---
Not really. Honestly.
---
What the fuck... am I looking at? I know you said what it is, but that ain‚Äôt it.
---
Puppers just did it, [it looks like this](https://www.twitch.tv/puppers/clip/TalentedDarlingPuffinHeyGirl)
---
Play a different game?
---
It's the same he even cuts an organic finger. Weak :/
---
You dont play killer do you?
---
No zombie killer? :( That sucks
---
But the description for MoM just mentions "the next occasion" regardless of if it's with NOED or a normal attack. So theoretically if you're hit with NOED and you're currently wounded it should be ignored.
---
Fair enough I suppose, I didn‚Äôt think of that.
---
It's a bug.
---
The Game's bathroom has a couple of toilets.
---
Welcome to the internet, sir! 
---
May I take your coat?
---
he kept standing doing nothing in front of me thinking that being unhooked means you get a perma free pass, hell his 2nd hook he was healing someone in front of me &amp; didnt even run away. was it tunneling? technically yes, but they were an idiot.
---
also dont worry, i know it was a joke... unless it wasnt... in which case ignore this part
---
yeah, but shouldn't the DC icon be visible instead of the sacrificed skull?
---
I watch YouTube or read a book during the queue for survivor. I‚Äôll probably go back to killer tomorrow so I don‚Äôt have to wait so long.
---
I mean, getting stunned 3 seconds after picking someone up seemed really toxic to me
---
Iri‚Äôs are bullshit and prayer beads have no counter. Idk about dc worthy but for sure op. 
---
Good tier list, you explained your reasons well but I'd personally swap spirit with Billy. Billy always has map pressure and chase potential where as spirit can't do both at the same time. She has to pick 1 of both and she's a little bit add on reliant (her power takes ages to recover without recovery add ons). She can also only pull survivors off using prayer beads, otherwise you can hear the phasing noise(unless you are in her terror radius) 
---
Gotta hide names on the sub
---
Ok but whenever I see an Ash I smile because I know he probably only has 3 perks.
---
Regardless of that, mettle is going to counter my Freddy playstyle regardless ) :
---
Uhhh
---
I think it doesn't when they dc on hook.
---
Rancor will still instadown them unless they're injured, you don't get the endurance from the perk unless you are injured.
---
They need to somehow punish survivors that dc within the 1st min of the match cause it overall makes the game less enjoyable for both survivor and killer. There needs to be some sort of penalty to reduce this behavior so that people are less likely to just rage quit because they can with no consequence. It happens way too often and ruins decently played games that you could be having if it weren't for these people. At this point, i'm more frustrated with people that dc all the time than going up against Legion lol. Hopefully the devs do something about this sooner than later.
---
I'm not saying the mere act of unhooking is a mistake. But if the killer isn't camping, 'Team Survivor' isn't completely helpless in minimizing the chance that their wounded teammate is around to be targeted, that might even mean a distraction is needed. Obviously it isn't fully in their control, there's plenty of times where you get a dick of a killer and they don't patrol far enough to lose sight of the wounded, or they're going to shoot themselves in the foot by targeting them at all costs and even passing up the survivors throwing themselves at him. But in the end, a five minute match lasts the same amount of time regardless of how you were rushed out of it, it's not any better or worse to be staring at the '-1 PIP' screen depending on which side you lost the match on. 
---
I get that being tunneled sucks, I get frustrated too when I'm targeted and I don't get much room to breath before it happens again. It's just hard to make an argument, competitively, that my opponent should handicap themselves at the expense of my enjoyment when I'm already playing the role with the higher skill ceiling, and I don't make the same concessions to them. 
---
whOooah
---
By the sounds of it you‚Äôre salty over the fact that basically nobody agrees with you, so now you have to resort to avoiding the subject. Nice, really sealed your argument with that one.
---
So exactly like the perk says. Mystery solved.
---
im glad they gave him cosmetics, too bad they're so expensive tho
---
If it's just against Plague, then you're probably talking about the noise that lets you know she's switching attack modes to her red blood vomit.
---
It happened to me.
---
It could happen to you.
---
Just... don‚Äôt buy it
---
That‚Äôs means she used a corrupted fountain to get Corrupt Purge, the red vomit that damages you.
---
so basically buying him directly is pretty much a straight upgrade, there's absolutely no downside for buying him directly, they're the same real price
---
Thank's for the info dude. Just seems like a big risk to me, then again I kinda play it safe the majority of the time.
---
Dbd rite of passage:
---
Get banned by AngryPug.
---
Apparently they fixed it when the Plague and Jane came out. It was in the patch notes, not sure if it‚Äôs actually fixed tho.
---
the guy with his Dwight leveled up honestly ruins this for me
---
Not everyone reads the perk description. They just hear the words "oh my god, you can take an extra hit" and call it over powered. It's powerful, but as I've said before it's not the perk for me.
---
I think they used to main Jake
---
I hope not, that basically gets rid of half of her power
---
that was the absolute most reddit reply I have ever seen, christ alive
---
You realize a new survivor was released today and everyone wants to play him right? I assume you were playing survivor because everyone Ive talked to today says killer queues were amazing
---
I mean, Final Season Lee could work very well.
---
DC = BAN
---
I KNOW RIGHT. 
---
You literally created arguments and attributed to me to argue against. What else am I supposed to say? This was fun man, if you want to post something of substance I might address it but otherwise  I'm going to let you argue with yourself. 
---
alright, so... you only hate him because he relies too much on his chainsaw and mallet? his weapons of choice? horror movies aren't based off representations, they're based off fear and what we as humans are scared of, hence the name, horror. but in the end these are all just opinions
---
Lmao whatever you say dude üëå
---
Love the strawman. Keep going on about your imaginary version of me that complains about not getting a 4k every game.
---
Wack
---
You only have to dodge one hatchet unless they bring the belt. Then you only have to dodge three 
---
If everyone is running it then either A) the perk needs a nerf because that shouldn't work that well, or B) It *doesn't* work that well in which case you're fine, the game has just changed somewhat with how it's paced and such. Survivors can only have 4 perks so it's a real question as to what it is they'll switch out for this one.
---
Is this bait?
---
But then it removes any chance of escaping the killer until you go down again. It guarantees a longer chase but it also guarantees a hook in the end.
---
You forgot No Mither.
---
not worth? but buying him directly costs exactly the same as buying with cells?
---
except medkit and toolbox both clip horrendously into the puppet's head.
---
idk how much work it would take, but I think it would be cool if they reversed Ash's animations so he holds things in his left hand.
---
Oh well, it‚Äôll only be temp. 
---
It‚Äôs always done that
---
Not really. I'm not upset his opinion is different, he's trying to start something because mine is. 
---
Yeah, thats it! Thanks ^^
---
Typically Never Sleep Pills and Susie's Mix Tape, Increasing Frenzy Speed and Duration.
---
Downvoted for spewin out facts, gj sub. It‚Äôs not like your saying it‚Äôs a good thing. 
---
What do you run with that build? I've been having some fun dabbling with it. I've been using Resilience, Dead Hard, No Mither, and experimenting with what fourth perk to fill in. I hadn't thought about how This is Not Happening counters Ruin. Usually I bring a kitted toolbox and just bust gens. 
---
Ooooohhhh I was confused about it so maybe it does or doesn't there's also the chance of a bug with the perk
---
At least we got bruce campbell 
---
I'm right! I know :) Thanks
---
Ye
---
üòÇ @ this silly ü¶Üthinking devs can fixüë©‚Äçüîßgenerators üîå!!!111!!
---
I don't understand why this is getting downvoted. It's not flaming anyone, and Vince would definitely find this joke hilarious. Literally just helping to suggest a streamer they might like.
---
It's a big risk in the sense of "You become really hard to down and then really easy to down" before going back to normal. I think it really just adjusts the timing and rhythm of the game more than anything.
---
big oof
---
Being the last survivor and getting hatch isn't success?
---
She's a girl, so a lot of guys love to watch her "content" no matter how bad of a person she is. I don't see the appeal either, Kitty is a much better person that likes to have fun and I never seen her shit talk the killer, Jen needs to play with a swf group everytime and depip because she knows that she dies quickly against good killers.
---
Hilarious!
---
I fucking love post game salt as a killer main. 
---
Of course it is, but it's also possible to escape without rushing generators, but it's still usually in our best interest when playing survivor, killer's fun be damned. 
---
First of all, someone please punch this asshat in the face. Secondly, looping is a dick move for people who need an easy win, at the expense of everyone having fun, exactly like camping.
---
3 seconds made it utterly useless because you'd be down again in 10 seconds because you could not get any kind of lead in that time.
---
5 seconds makes it actually viable for dealing with tunnelers.
---
If you're upset about it then just stop tunneling....
---
Disappointed he didn‚Äôt rip its little head off 
---
Blink doesn't end until after the stun. You're attacking while blinking.
---
Not even the whole argument.
---
I'm pretty sure prestiging results in your bloodwebs having slightly rarer items, but I could be wrong
---
Awwww I was so hoping they'd make it be the puppet arm that he cuts off, dang. Oh well
---
If you are the last one left and getting hooked means death, not getting the hatch
---
This upsets me.
---
Nothing else I an add to this.
---
ONE insta down hatchet=DC? You realize Huntress turns into a 110% M1 Killer when she‚Äôs out of hatchets, right?
---
I don't remember making that statement. I just don't see the point of letting someone live if he's injured and right in front of me.
---
Tom Hanks new survivor?
---
Sure thing!
---
Had this happen to me. Took 3-4 minutes to mend. It was ridiculous.
---
Dwight looking like a mighty thicc SNACC with those pizza delivery pants...
---
I dig it.
---
What delusions of grandeur...?!
---
This is the same situation as the dark devotion trigger yea? 
---
Question, does a wraith hit after just coming out of cloaked count as basic or no?
---
*^^Reddit!*
---
Yeah I completely agree.  That loadout can be used with any killer.  Depending on how I feel though I‚Äôll swap BBQ or NOED for Blood Warden at times.  I think that‚Äôs a perk that doesn‚Äôt get used enough.  My thoughts on noed are mixed.  I enjoy it but it can turn a whole game around completely without actually doing anything.  We won‚Äôt have that NOED convo.  As for Leather you will catch lots of hate if you use that build.  You don‚Äôt even need noed,  Insidious itself is a camping perk.  Just make sure to use add ones that make your chainsaw quieter and faster starting time.
---
I want to discuss Doc.  I‚Äôve played against a few who have made my life literal hell.  Especially the ones who use the add on where his red stain follows you around the whole map with a non stop heartbeat.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs s great killer though.  
---
Hag can be amazing if you know how to really play her and not just place traps around hooks.  If you play hag like trapper you will slaughter a team pretty easily.  Anticipate where the survivors will run like main walk ways or in the end of a vault or pallet.  I forget sometimes how good she is because I don‚Äôt play her often.
---
MM.  insanely fun to play.  Monitor and abuse should have been his perk.  Playing peek a boo Myers is a blast especially with a tombstone piece.  Not even a Judith, just a piece.   Sneak attack grab and pull tier 3 instadeath. You can‚Äôt beat it, imo.
---
I‚Äôve been trying to master my Pig and build her up with most perks tier 3.  Funny part is I am a survivor main who solo ques on Xbox.  I run my P3 Meg and just purchased Ash today.   Definitely going to level Him and probably Jane at well.  My go to survivor loadout 100% is Hope, Adrenaline, Wake up and Balanced.  
---
I have my Nurse and Spirit close to 40 and really want to learn them too because both of those two are unstoppable in the right hands. 
---
I think the crazy thing is that it didn't go back to normal
---
One of my top favorite movie series! Surprised to actually see it here haha it would be legendary if he was in the game.
---
No Mither doesn't fuck your teammates over though, just yourself so long as there's no Thanatophobia. 
---
I feel like they thought there was ragequits? One was my friend and actually crashed though lmaooo. Either way, sucked to encounter :(
---
OOPS SHITE I FORGOT
---
its a pvp game, pretty sure every dbd streamer trash talks a killer/survivor, plus some people find it entertaining, gotta entertain people being a streamer y'know 
---
I've almost never been rescued while downed, so I don't ever have the expectation that someone is going to come get me if the area is remotely unsafe still. My immediate plan is to try to crawl to where the killer would not expect me to go, and once safe determine if I should wait there and recover or if the game is effectively over and my best bet is to try to crawl for the hatch. 
---
Actually, while I don't agree with you on content, I was being toxic, so I will withdraw my comment and delete it.  My appologies.
---
The consequence is you don‚Äôt pip
---
Ain‚Äôt exactly an easy task against good huntresses ;)
---
Yeah I usually have to in game volume at 50%
---
I heard a voice and I thought it was whispers of the entity or some shit
---
I upped to 75% and could still hear a voice... but it was still so quiet
---
And 100% is deafeningly loud on my speakers so I dare not go that far
---
It's far too quiet
---
Deerskin Gloves and Iron Maiden means infinite hatchets tho :)
---
It was kinda cringey at the end. He misplayed so much and missed chainsaws, swung too early etc then he hit me at the exit gate with NOED it was tragic af. I didn't get angry though, I complimented him. He also face camped my friend and hit them at the end.
---
Clown: "Hello ashy, how's has your day been?"
---
Ashy: "It was going great till this old geezer decided to stick his arm stump up my ass" 
---
While I am more than commonly against survivors and their shitty behavior, I will ALWAYS check killers twice as critically. That kind of encounter is so fucking stupid and childish.
---
They are overpowered and need rework but DC is not the answer.  If that‚Äôs the case it‚Äôs ok to DC against instaheals and keys.
---
You need the pink cap. 
---
I was hoping he'll collect Ashy Slashy. 
---
Last night i was playing rank 12 killer amd it threw me against alot of ranks 5-1's
---
In general moonwalking refers to walking backwards, but for Legion it's a little different. When he attacks a survivor in feral frenzy it puts the deep wound status effect on the survivor, forcing them to mend before he bar empties. In order to balance the mechanic, they made it so it doesn't empty during a chase, otherwise the survivor would just go down after a few seconds. People quickly figured out that you can trick the game into thinking that the chase has ended by walking backwards after them (moonwalking), or even just looking down. People refer to this strategy as moonwalking Legion. Pair that with sloppy butcher and bloodhound and it's pretty easy to follow the survivor using the bright red blood trail, just in case you lose track of them. This makes it impossible to outplay the Legion regardless of the survivors skill level.  
---
This is essentially an exploit, as the devs have already stated that this is not an intended interaction, but it isn't reportable. It would be impossible to prove, and it isn't entirely clear from the killer side how drastically this is affecting gameplay.
---
Its still five for the dlc soo
---
Kill rushing is usually the efficient play but too many killers throw good time after bad, the sunk cost fallacy is real.
---
A lot of people who camp (outside of the new players who don‚Äôt know better) don‚Äôt care for rank or points, it‚Äôs done to upset other players. You think a pip matters to them?
---
She‚Äôs not a likable person, but she is VERY good at survivor...some ppl say she may even be the best survivor
---
yeah im totally gonna watch an hour long stream in order to find the one part that mentions this concept  
---
/s
---
It's just crazy how some people make their mistakes and blame other people on such insane levels. Hear that one post? Guy blamed someone for looping and equating it to liking rape. 
---
Oh shit. Yeah that sounds awful. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve encountered that yet. I‚Äôm mid rank and the legions I‚Äôve played against have actually be pretty fair.
---
I have tested this on ps4 and the Ash running mettle of man stayed in dream world. His aura just intensified.
---
Duck behind something. Environmental hitboxes are huge. Stick close to walls and cut corners. Never throw a pallet if shes several feet behind you. She wants the hatchet. Just keep running
---
Oh he looks cool! What are the perks and ability, if you don‚Äôt mine me asking? üò¨
---
On the one hand I get it, but especially late game if you're efficient once one or two people are dead, you can quite easily get struck for going for the only unhooked player for no reason
---
Yep. I mean.. they did a good job on some of the outfits.. Nea comes to mind.. but most are just boring and plain bad honestly.
---
How is a weapon you only get one of and have to reload away from survivors OP?
---
I heard that he says something when he pallet stuns but I don‚Äôt think so
---
Of course Groovy
---
It does, just not flashlights.
---
Tbh it's gotten worse. Atleast 3 games in the past 24 hours have been facecamping leatherfaces. Just ruins the game
---
Because only things that the killer side finds unfun is getting patched out.
---
Camping and tunneling is just as prevalent as ever.

I just mean around the start of the match if they get lucky and hook someone, they shouldn‚Äôt feel the need to camp it. There‚Äôs plenty of chance to get another player,
---
A bug it is, then.
---
Lmao hillbilly and no ed. Bet he never revved up his chainsaw.
---
naked myers \*no homo exhale\*
---
I agree, didn‚Äôt have much of a problem until quite recently where it‚Äôs been almost every match.
---
Prestiging gets you rarer items in the bloodweb and more frequently as well. 
---
I was hoping he would say "groovy" when he finished a gen, and maybe "catch you on the flip-flop!" Whenever he escaped.
---
Oh yeah that doesn't make sense, you can't pip like that. They're either new or they're tilted, that's not a sensible play. 
---
Its because people are overly unhook happy. Instead of working on gens and complete like 3 of them while the guy gets camped.
---
la la la la la-la
---
She‚Äôs a good streamer for me I don‚Äôt mind her trash talking. 
---
Me and my friend can‚Äôt find a single match and havnt been able to for the past 2 weeks. We‚Äôre on ps4 and my rank is a 12 his is 8. Could be cus of the new matchmaking system?
---
He's the first licensed character to come out since the cosmetic shop went live, that's why.
---
So obviously they'd have negotiated cosmetics when making the deal to get him in the game.
---
I saw this earlier myself. Ash is really trying to get out.
---
depends on the loop but ya
---
Really wish the hatch was more balanced.
---
This ain't it cheif. If totems looked like that ruin ain't getting cleansed.
---
Urban dictionary is not a credible source üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
I still wanna know what the exclusive item they kept mentioning was
---
I play both killer and survivor, my point is that you can't fault survivors for calling out what is 100% tunnelling. I personally like to make games fun so I don't support tunnelling as a strategy, I've walked away from a game with 320 points as survivor thanks to it. It is not the same as genrushing.
---
It is so good at snowballing it's scary. Got a whole team in a single puke at once. Basement game is a gg
---
I believe it‚Äôs his glove, but it has a blue covering. 
---
Imagine hitting someone with borrowed AND mettle of man, then using dead hard to avoid another hit then a ds for good measure. Also 4 people have it. But fuck me if I wanna use ADD ONS to murder some bitches every once in awhile.
---
I‚Äôll just tunnel a key. 
---
I thought he had OOO
---
You know that werewolves are different from furries..right? And nice to see more furry haters XD 
---
Yeah it‚Äôs fun, I play solo so I‚Äôm stuck with trash team mates, so fun, 
---
I played a guy (who was a streamer!) who lost his mind in the post-game chat saying that the survivors sexually assaulted him by t-bagging on pallets.
---
I went to his stream and he was 100% serious. 
---
Some people are just morons.
---
Ironic.
---
If we ever played together, I work with everyone. &lt;3 
---
I went to his stream and he was 100% serious. He was absolutely raging about it.
---
If we're talking best perks and add ons, spirit is indeed better(prayer beads+yakuyoke amulet is insane and is better than insta saw imo) but I'm talking in a normal game(best perks and good, not best add ons or no add ons) I think Billy is better because with Billy you can 1 shot even at pallets because he doesn't get slowed down like lf. He can also chainsaw bait at pallets, break pallets with his chainsaw and his map pressure is better than the spirits(can get to the end of the map even faster than a spirit with mother daughter ring) and doesn't get punished for it like spirit does, costing her the chase potential at the expense of map pressure. Spirit is better at 1v1s and Billy is better at map pressure but Billy also has 1 shot potential and does not lose his map pressure at the cost of 1 shot or vice versa like spirit does. Spirit is also harder to use than Billy but overall they're both really strong and I'm glad spirit is strong because I remember back when she first came out, she wasn't the best 
---
Nice, you nearly got a pip from that!
---
I don‚Äôt see why it wouldn‚Äôt be considered an m1. I mean, you literally have to press m1. The only killers that ‚Äúcounter ‚Äú it is huntress billy legion (technically) and leatherface. Pig doesn‚Äôt get that many dash attacks, but I suppose those hits wouldn‚Äôt count either. A blink is just a movement power.
---
I noticed this too. Must be a bug.
---
a map that doesn't suck and doesn't have awful loops like the Plague map 
---
I know this is a joke and all (and I love the pun), but I‚Äôll be honest, I‚Äôm pretty pleased with the stuff the devs are putting out atm. Demise of the Faithful was great, I loved all three parts to it. Ash is an amazing addition, and him having actual voice lines by Bruce Campbell is tremendous. Dedicated Servers are almost upon us. All they need to do now is add Halloween 2018 cosmetics and I‚Äôll honestly excuse Legion and Freddy‚Äôs poor treatment. 
---
Survivors wanna do gens easily and nothing else. Vile Purge makes it so that they have to make decisions and that's no good
---
If you don't mind me asking which perspective is this from? (Part of research is knowing the subjects)
