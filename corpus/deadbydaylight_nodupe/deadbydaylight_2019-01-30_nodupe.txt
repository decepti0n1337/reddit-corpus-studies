I play legion and I know how much of a broken mechanic it is, I usually chase people by attacking them with my frenzy attack 4 times. Imo its much more fun for both parties and has counterplay.
---
---
---
Lmao we get downvoted for talking. Never did I even say I find that behavior fun or good. Yet all people see is LEGION and go crazy.
---
Can confirm the Jake stereotype; I'm the dude doing that one gen no one else wants to do because its beside the basement.
---

---
Also the guy who opts to hide instead of run; I could squeeze my ass into the tightest spots just to not get spotted.
---
No, best looking survivor. Not most horrific killer.
---
Matchmaking sucks dick
---
The animation from the survivors view is wrong, makes you think is over with the chainsaw.
---
Basically you shouldn't ever prestige any character that you will miss, since it allegedly takes like 50mil BP or some insane amount to get P3 all perks.
---
You should also have some character that you enjoy in order to farm tons of BP on to feed the prestige pit.
---
I'm on console so I don't use hag much. If you're just looking for perks, the pig has pretty mediocre perks.
---
At least Nurse requires skill
---
Well no im not just looking for perks. Why did you suggest pig then ?
---
You can try to game the system by intentionally queuing at the same time as the streamer. If you're playing killer, open a lobby just before they queue. If you're playing survivor, wait for them to make a lobby, then queue. 
---
You can also figure it out if you got the right person by usernames and cosmetics if you're the killer trying to snipe a survivor.
---
It really does.
---
Ah. 
---
&gt; I'll DC right when I see you teabagging at the exit gates,
---
They still get the points for escaping twat.
---
So for the achievements on PS4 that are grinds (500 electric shock attacks for doctor, putting 200 survivors into dream world with Freddy, etc.) does doing the same action multiple times to the same survivor count as 1 or multiple times for the achievement?
---
I.E. if I’m Freddy and I put someone to sleep, hook them, they get freed, and I put them to sleep again, is that 2 towards the 200 or 1?
---
Lol.  I thought you quit this game?  
---
If they haven't left yet, cunt? Good to know Douche-canoe. Thank you.
---
You probably shouldn't be playing killer if this is your mind set.
---
The downvotes are because you're wrong and made it look like fact. Don't respond if you don't know the answer lol
---
No, I get that. My point is, the game cannot tell. Killer is host. If the host disappears your game can't know why. It doesn't know if they crashed, lagged out, force quit, or if you lagged out. It all looks the same to the game.
---
I thought I did know the answer and that's why I commented. Apparently I was wrong
---
Yes, this happens to me with my Xbox One. 
---
Ruin is obviously the first perk you should pick up. You spend a lot of the early game setting up traps so you don’t have much map pressure and ruin has a ton of map pressure, but Ruin is good in every killer so that’s that. 
---
Pretty much every chase perk is good for trapper. He’s a M1 killer without his traps so he suffers from loops, so I recommend Enduring and Brutal Strength. Really any chase perk works but those are the 2 I would use the most. 
---
Didn't they implement luck increases rarity on a items in the 2.5 update
---
Oh I get what you mean. Can’t wait for designated servers lol
---
The typical build is the same for all of the "Mouse 1" Killers at the moment, BBQ, Hex:Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury. It's just basically the most effective build for getting kills at the moment, assuming you know how to mind game most tiles properly.
---
Typically you'll want to try to get as many Survivors asleep as possible, since they get a base 50% slow to all action speed while asleep, and if they're all asleep, the only way they have to wake up is Generators. It also gives you pretty good awareness of where everyone is. Don't be afraid to stop a chase to grab someone else into the dream world.
---
He's pretty weak, so there isn't much outside of just having good Killer fundamentals that can be said about how to play Fredward.
---
I like playing her and I only tunnel when it’s clear there are bad solo survivors and one godly survivor who’s somehow low rank as I don’t want to deal with them the entire match. 
---
That said I used to do this constant as I would hit everyone and I would keep reapplying pig traps for the achievement, but now that I have it I don’t really do it anymore at all. 
---
Then there are people who don’t really get how to play as Amanda and screw up or are dumb. 
---
I'll stop all of this toxicity... BY BEING TOXIC! MWAHAHAHAHA
---
Lmao Douche-canoe
---
As a survivor, an endless chase is an unqualified victory.  If you can loop a killer eternally while your teammates finish every gen, they’ve lost.  No, hiding from a doctor isn’t very likely to work, but if they can’t close out the chase it doesn’t really matter.
---
Swap Jake and Feng and it all fits perfectly
---
Because I want to have fun? Just to be clear. Losing a match doesn't bother me. Toxicity on both sides does. Which is why I said same for toxic killers.
---
I'm a nice Killer. Like give the hatch away, don't facecamp etc etc.
---
Well that wasn't loud and obnoxious at all.
---
pebble time
---
Ok see? Your opinion I can appreciate. I don't DC often I've had the game for about a year and only done it a handful of times. Today was just a bad day. One after the other. Just getting tired of toxic swf being able to do as they please and get away with it. No repercussions. 
---
My messages are sent to private and they just send friend requests to talk shit.
---
I hear what your saying. I just want to have fun in this game.
---
...you wanna fuck a totem and a giant spider?
---
Lol I’ve never heard that one before, I have to say I like it 
---
this bitch empty
---
**YEET**
---
With the recent buff to diversion I might look into getting it, not too interested in spending shards on any of the others unfortunately. 
---
I actually like to leave the really obvious ones because I know how rare it is to get them all. Then I at least have a shot at the easy cleanse. 
---
LOL getting triggered like a little bitch?
---
no....No....NO NOT THE CORN!
---
This is literally proving the meme
---
Clown in a speedo or I'm uninstalling.
---
I mean, people who've been playing the whole time probably do
---
Weird Flex but I run Small game on all my survivors so I can go after totems
---
He is a messy project the devs 1 thinking in make a "copycat" killer we can see this in hes trailer but they changed the idea to this shit
---
Nope someone really wants someone dead
---
What is a toxic swf...? And please don’t say they use flashlights and run DS and insta heals cause.... that’s not toxic....
---
&gt;:(
---
If you read the shrine clockwise, it tells a story where someone balls up a baby bird, throws the bird, the bird gets eaten by a spider, and the spider gains its power.
---
Someone needs to photoshop it
---
Go for discordance and keep grabbing them poor survivors off the generators.
---
Talking all that shit and still got bodied, Pathetic. 
---
2.5.1 the patch we thought we wanted 
---
But a buff to the loading screen is all we get
---
Yeah Legion is quickly becoming my least favorite killer, not at all scary just annoying and perks not only give him an advantage at the beginning of a game but also discourages teamwork in a game that relies on 4 random people to work together and survive. I don’t particularly like this new killer whatsoever but idk that’s just me. 
---
*P R E T T Y  G O O D  J O B  S O  F A R*
---
That's a good idea! It makes an interesting dynamic of survivors trading a perk slot to mitigate one of the killer's. Could definitely be a good addition.
---
Spirits booty is thick, that's it, otherwise she has more of an athletic body lol
---
On one hand, you should get over teabagging because it's 2019 who cares
---
But on the other hand it's your game, you can d/c whenever you damn well please, more power to you.
---
The only one I'd possibly even be considering buying is Play With Your Food, and that's only in the hopes that it's going to get buffed at some point.
---
I just dc when i see him
---
Uh..... Like body blocking every and any hook while, yes, flashlighting and teabagging. Opening the gates but not leaving. Just to spin around clicking lights. All 4 escaping then sending messages to you. Or shit if you kill even one of them, full inbox of salt.
---
legion 2: electric boogaloo
---
So body-blocking as a survivor to stop the killer getting the hook is allowed ?
---
Dude but speedo Dwight.
---
I understand that. Sometimes i get angry too when it feels like I'm in a situation where I did everything i could do but lost horribly. It's important to remember that they do have repercussions, though. They've probably been camped, mori'd, and tunneled after that match or before that match. If you don't get them, another killer will. As for you, take the oppurtunity to improve on your skills. Think about what you did wrong and other things you could do. A common problem, for example, is that killers commit to chases they can't win. Chases are wasted gens if you can't catch your prey, so sometimes you have to realize to break off from who you are on and make sure your gens arent being touched and attack the other survivors. In my experience, the average swf usually consist of 1-2 good players and 2 gen jockeys who are not great at chases but do gens, if that's the case, go after them. Ignore friend request, ignore people trying to spite you. Just don't be as bad as them and dc whenever someone tbags. 
---
Looks like I need to either unlock Legion or buy him/her (although I don’t think I can justify buying him/her.  because I’ll never play them.) 
---
Or hope and pray it shows up in the shrine, lol. 
---
Yep.  Leader gives the team free botany knowledge.  Leader is allot more flexible than just a primary gen jockey perk.
---
Lol, i don't not agree with you. I probably should but its the tbagging mixed with other stuff. Not the act by itself.
---
Yes
---
Body blocking isn’t toxic. Anything post game I accept as toxic. But if you’re complaining about people using items in the game as they’re intended to then... See clicking their lights constantly is to fire you up. When I get groups like that who refuse to leave, I go afk and do what I want. I also see a lot of people running NOED rn so if people staying in game when all gens are done and refusing to leave is bothering you, try running NOED. It may help. 
---
Anyone have an idea of how much grind it's gonna take to get enough coins for skins in moonrise? I figure some might know because I hear there was an event before that was pretty similar.
---
lol shadowborn increases ur fov so you dont lose line of sight as easy. M&amp;A reduces your terror radius when not in a chase
---
Yes, it is allowed.
---
Don’t be so negative, we just have to remain **ENDURING**!
---
You’ll get those sweet sweet internet points so why not ?
---
Devotion 4?!
---
How much do you play?
---
[removed]
---
It's harder to get to rank 20 than it is to get to rank 1
---
Really? I mean this is just IMO but I see less toxicity whenever I get to play and event. Or maybe I don't notice it? Unclear hahaha
---
If we just remain **Enduring**, then **We're Gonna Live Forever!**
---
Cool.
---
Oh it’s 10000x worse. Every single event I’ve played has been awful. Maybe you’ve been lucky!
---
Kate's boobs have jiggle physics? I need to see this for myself.
---
Jeff, Kate and David are a no pls? ARE YOU OK?
---
What do you play on? Could be system related lol
---
In actually in one right now. Wasting time by searching through Reddit for random stuff.
---
This is a just you problem, not an all console players problem. 
---
I’m on pc!
---
I think the best way to solve this stupid hatch stand off thing is make it to where the survivor can't be grabbed but the killer can close the hatch so whoever gets to it first gets the win
---
I always look behind me in chases. I've run dead hard once and realized that it blows.
---
Also! Also important! Dead Hard is ok to use if you just need to bridge that *little* extra gap between you and the window/pallet when the killer is hot on your ass. You don't anyways need to bullrush through a hit.
---
This happens to me nearly every patch. Do a hard reboot and that should fix it.
---
Fuck. Was hoping you'd say PS4 lol. 
---
That's wierd. I always heard that PC was a much much nicer community because of how much money is spent on building a good gaming pc
---
oh my god i didn't know this
---
Already did and I’m still getting the same message. I’m filling out a support ticket. 
---
Some members of the community can be quite... frustrating to deal with. You just have to ignore them. You are in your learning stage and, with time and patience, you will get better. It can be a little intimidating at first, but don't get discouraged. No one started this game as an amazing survivor or killer and even the best of both of those (players with over 2000 hours in game) have bad matches from time to time. Good luck in the fog, friend.
---
Well shit this got me hard, 
---
Time to domestically beat my meat
---
Rààà
---
I accidentally switched to Wraith in a rank 8 match by bumping my controller. When I tried to go back to the nurse I hit the wrong trigger.
---
I believe it was an August 2018 patch that made it so you you're not supposed to hear her while the husk is in your terror radius. If you're out of the husk radius and she's coming for you, you're supposed to hear it for sure. Run!
---
So you are not forced by the “meta” to play a survivor you don’t want 
---
Still no BBQ and chili..... 
---
Sigh time to spend 1.99
---
Happy cake day.
---
Also, I don’t recommend wasting shards on free characters. Just level them. You’d be better off getting DLC perks.
---
This one? [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/acjb1f/thats\_how\_mafia\_works/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/acjb1f/thats_how_mafia_works/)   Only one I can think of.
---
M&amp;A increases your fov too
---
I'm so salty even though you're the one making a rant rage salt post about how absolute garbage you are LOOOL
---
Legion, fun, pick one or the other.
---
Just level Claudette lul. She’s a free character.
---
Man you really **Urban Evansion**ed my anger from this shrine, I'll try to not **Sprint Burst** to conclusions.
---
Kate/Jeff here, accurate!
---
Desperate times call for desperate measures 
---
Aren't they all free? I guess if you don't have the required dlc maybe not. Or are there shrine exclusive perks?
---
Emphasis on "a speedo". As in, one speedo. The same speedo. Simultaneously.
---
Can confirm. I'm an Ace that runs small game 100% of the time. I'll die before I get exposed by No One Escapes Death. Thrill of the Hunt ain't never scared me anyway
---
*Strategically Placed Bandages*
---
This is a rather strange question to ask.
---
The artificial lighting is not very good lol
---
If you slug someone and their timer goes down to say 3/4, you hook them then they get rescued and you slug them again. Would the bleed put timer reset or go back from where it was?
---
Kinky
---
Nooo. Hell noooo. Post game chat is literally cancer. It’s awful. 
---
Expect a solid 20+ games per day to get the coins to get all cosmetics. 
---
Yep. My team popped the last gen just as I died
---
Not sure if all the upvotes mean people agree with the message behind the meme or that people want shirtless Myers 
---
Tantrum, dude. There is no pause in the power. It doesn't stop for a second.
---
I mean I run WGLF with we’ll make it. If I don’t get the heal off, I’ll just take the hit. Other times, players just don’t care.
---
I look behind me as well when I get chased, but it’s more of a every couple of seconds thing. It’s when someone is maintaining that head-turn and running in a straight line that it’s obvious they’re about to Dead Hard. Also I agree, it’s not all that great of a perk lol 
---
Truth. Or you just loot the nearby chest for the hell of it, even though you know you and your brand new yellow toolbox won’t be making it out alive.

I'm the unseen one: The full Vigo Apprentice Dwight that follows you around with an insta-heal and takes the aggro for the ensuing hit, just because you said something slightly amusing in the pre-game chat.
---
Oof. I'm only gonna go for 1 then probably.
---
I highly doubt it since they were event cosmetics
---
been waiting months for OoO
---
The fucking truth!
---
What?
---
earning the BP takes time and there are other people I'd rather level atm, I already have 2k shards would've just been easier if it was in the shrine, lul.
---
*finds red key*
---
Watch people that are really good. Truetalent and Bricky are my personal favorites, they show you how it’s done
---
Whenever this happens I either let the survivor escape or kill them right away mainly because I want to get on with my next game
---
then only level up one, it’s your choice. some of us like changing between characters cosmetically.

---
The main menu makes my PS4 sound like it’s about to blast off
---
Actually they did attempt something but found it would make the game unfun so they are trying to find another way to make the hatch opening more engaging than finishing atleast 2 gens 
---
Woah there, no need to be rude. 
---
Sounds about right haha.
---
That's not really balanced though since the killer can move faster around the map and almost always find the hatch first.
---
you know what else is boring as shit? playing against legion, no matter how they play, no matter what perks or addons, it’s fucking boring. don’t play legion, problem solved.
---
I guess that would depend on if it held you in place til the action was over or if the killer could cancel the close for a grab. Interesting concept honestly
---
Also where?
---
Mad grit literally exists to counter it
---
Nope better pucker up 10 Dolla each 
---
I believe the consensus is we want shirtless Myers 
---
;~;
---
Only if bikini pig is a thing
---
It's better than how it is now though because right now it's not balanced
---
Killer can’t cancel or they get stunned and progress resets. So pretty much, even if killer knows exactly where hatch is, the final survivor has a 5-7 second or whatever minimum to find hatch
---
I get that. 
---
I was going to let him kill me and get it done and over with but *shrug* depends on the mood I guess
---
Shit dawg u got me there 
---
Can someone explain what is the prestige exploit?
---
Interesting. 
---
Yeah, who’s the artist??
---
How do I get better at playing survivor?
---
Someone posted yesterday letting last 2 survivors leave after feeling bad cuz they had 5 gens left and ruin still out. So the guys who died mssg'd him/her saying they were gonna report him 
---
Can't be nice to nobody lool
---
Just kill a man, clean and bleach the skeleton, pick the bones that look right, and bind them together with their tendons. 
---
Freddy is the Dream Daddy 
---
legion fun
---
Yikes
---
lol yikes.... "proud of myself" ooooofff this post is so cringe 
---
I've noticed too. Normally I like to give people the benefit of the doubt but you start to notice the intentional ones. Feelsbadman
---
But people have got banned for doing it
---
The dribbling and teabagging seem like they could be bannable but they aren't OP in any way so it makes sense they'd be on the list.
---
I only bought perks off the shrine for the extra bloodpoints. I never bought the actual perks off of there because it isn’t worth it. Just take the extra bloodpoints to level your main or boost another character.
---
NICE 
---
Damn that’s tough lol
---
Unless you’re hard dc’ing they still get points you fucking twink
---
Weird that you say this. I decided to become an ace main and yesterday I got enough sharts to unlock him. I've been running ace in the hole, plunderer's instinct, small game and balanced landing. When I saw this list, I imidiately tought of putting ace in the totem cleansing spot just because ever since I selected ace, I for some reason gravitated towards cleansing the totems. And you just acknowledged this as an ace main.
---
Is diversion a good perk? I'm looking for good perks for Killer/Survivor, should I wait another 7 days? This Shrine looks like shit, but is diversion worth it? 
---
If anyone can do this Id like a DM too - I'd totally buy this for my desk
---
I have my maxed meg right next to my brand new prestiged Claudette lvl 1 and it’s scary sometimes
---
Agree 100% especially for killers. You can earn so many more BP by letting the survivor have the hatch and just starting another game.
---
I would do that too if I was the killer.
---
Some more than others
---
Damn. Yeah. I don't remember that at all.
---
Yeah. In my opinion it would be scarier for the killer to accidentally switch because each killer is completely different. I don't play much survivor though so idk.

Yeesh, I was the Nea once (I mained her when I was super new).  It took me an embarrassingly long to time to register what that sound prompt before the skillcheck was so I would get "surprised" constantly and blow gens left and right.  Once I realized what was up with the sound prompt, I got pro. 
---
I mainly play survivor and not that great. If I’m spotted all I can do is waste the killers time while others can work on gens. If I play killer, I get killed by loopers so I learned how valuable it is. Another thing is the sight for killer can be small, and they’ll only notice if you’re moving. I like breaking the eye line and slow vault, I’m usually more terrible without urban invasion so maybe slap a noob sticker on me. 
---
Getting out isn’t really the goal, and pipping is; just work on some gens and try to get some saves and the bps will come. 
---
The point he was making, is you cant use other items in dying state

Well there you go. You don't have enough time in the game to understand. Once you get going with both sides you will understand what im saying.
---
no the update was just to fix some issues
---
Full on sabo squads are rare, maybe once every 100 Killer games, but when I see 4 toolboxes I'd say 7 times out of ten there's at least 1 99er in the group. Hence why I take it vs 4 boxes.
---
I haven't seen anyone do it properly, but I've seen a lot of claudettes and megs going around the map and breaking hooks. Not 99ing them, but actually breaking them. The only survivor I see doing decent hook breaks is David. Also, the claudette and meg, together with kate will also start working on a hook without sabotage progress allowing me to down them before they finish the sabo and I still have enough time to put their friend on the hook they tried to break. Survivors confuse me sometimes
---
Oh okay. My point from last comment still applies that if you get into a situation where that can occur (assuming billy doesn’t have super strong addons) is mostly the survivor’s fault. There are enough windows on the map to avoid it.
---
Actually me

I don’t remember him ever being referred to as skillbilly.
---
That movie is a masterpiece!
---
Omg! XD
---
Shrine of ass
---
You just gotta wait it out or dc.
---
As a David main I can confirm. That and doing gens and getting hook saves and healing and then getting face camped because of my altruism.
---
My question to you is why do you care ? The truth is no matter what game you play there  will always  be toxic fuck heads,  just ignore them. At the end of the day your only cheating yourself out of the money you paid for these games. The number one question you should ask yourself when playing is are you having fun doing what your doing.  Just block and mute toxic players.

When I bought this game I had at least two people tell me not to because the community is toxic! I’ve literally never had a problem, even my wife plays and she’s total ass and no one say anything. 
---
She also plays rainbow and here and there someone will message her giving her advice but nothing crazy , The point is we are having fun and that’s all that matters. 
---
You should always look out for number one and that’s you ! 
---
Is that add-on the one where you don’t lose it if you die or don’t lose it if you unlock the hatch?
---
You’re right. Survivors just have perks but killers have completely different abilities. It’s just I have 0 perks on my Claudette.
---
I'll be sending you a 500$ fine for both wasting my time and using a dead meme
---
When you are in an open area, you have more directions to run. The perfect area has places to hide and run while still being open enough to be unpredictable.
---
Yes, all those maneuvers are usable. and no, they are not worth it. If you make a bad read doing that as killer you waste more time. Yes, you can get a free hit in every once in a while. No, you should not rely on this. running through pallets is the best decision 90% of the time, especially when they survivor expects the mixups and you hit them with the no mixup mixup.
---
I think it's scary how accurate this is. I've been unlocking only killers untill I got all of them, so I only played bill and I was indeed the guy that was always on gens (I was also the guy that either got found right at the start or never got found the whole game). But recently I got ace, and I just look around for chests, however, since I go around the map, I also equip small game and equip small game. Ever since I played ace, at least 3/5 totems have been gone every time all generators were done.
---
Orgy 100%
---
I think anything that can end in a stalemate is by textbook definition as balanced as you can get.  Neither party has more or less power over the other.  But that would make this is one of those rare instances where balanced does not necessarily equal perfection.  Cause we can all agree that it's pretty shitty. 
---
I’ll be paying it entirely in Israeli Shekels. I hope you dont mind
---
Well I agree that you CAN mindgame with spirit but you don’t have to in order to get easy and quick hits and downs on the survivors. That’s my biggest issue with her, there is potential for a fun experience for both the survivor and the killer, and she is branded as a mindgame killer, but in reality there are little to no mind games required to get kills as her. It’s a guessing game at best.
---
Yeah that strat doesn't help the teammate that eats the noed before you cleanse it lol.  I get it but it typically feeds killer one last kill.  Of rather have them all out before endgame 
---
Oh boy you don’t even know. It’s absurd.
---
Thanks! I will wait for a better Shrine
---
Huh, just due to your comment history, you are the dipshit. Making negative comments every chance you get. 7 karma from 2 years of being on reddit? You must be faking right?

I didn't know Mikey was a Sith Lord.
---
Did Wake Up get nerfed to where seeing the doors permanently is no longer a thing or is that a bug?
---
I always like the msg a thank you (on PS4) to killers that let me escape or do gens. I figured it might balance out the mean shit usually sent their way. 
---
It's honestly getting a bit ridiculous. There should be actual penalties to people who DC on a regular basis.
---
Wtf are you kidding? It was a shitpost that I made it related to dead by daylight
---
Got it, you hippo-twat-amous. Already understtod
---
Its one of the main reason survivors have to play aggressive. Its unfun for survivors like me who like stealth more then getting chased.
---
Did you try to "hook" the DC survivor?

---
...I did not. Hmm. I wasn’t slowed like I was encumbered. Honestly didn’t occur to me. 
---
Did they fix Leatherface chainsaw sound? c",)
---
the really toxic survivors like to de-rank and hover around purple to bully newer killers. Red ranks are fun if you don't get a SWF in your game.
---
I cannot wait for the moonrise event! Ik it's just 1 day byt still.
---
Bad Internet connection between you and the killer.
---
This happens to all killers when the survivor DCs that way. Doing the hook animation fixes it
---
*myers
---
I’ve had this issue in the past (like maybe 6-8 months ago) and I reinstalled the game and that fixed it. This time, I’ve tried reinstalling the game twice, tried multiple wifi networks and tried putting my graphics quality on low. I don’t know what else to do.
---
My character will do that every 3 seconds EXCEPT after a gen pops, someone is hooked or someone dies, and then it waits 6 seconds to jitter like that. No one else stops but me, so when I get chased, I basically stop for a split second and then keep moving while nothing else stops. My progress bars are always 2-4 seconds delayed, so if it’s full, I have to wait a little bit for the action to actually be completed.
---
&gt;I got enough sharts to unlock him.
---
Did an actual spit take.. damn you. 
---
This has happened for a few days now, and no matter what ping I have (I’ve tried 400 ping and 60 ping) it’s always the same, no difference. Is that really all it is, and how can I stop it? It’s all of a sudden just happening.
---
Rancor allows you to mori your obsession when all gens get done. Spirit perk.
---
So does Devour Hope with 5 tokens. Hag perk.
---
It fucks you because you can't crouch to hide especially since after throwing a pallet is usually an ideal time to hide from a killer.
---
Pebble time
---
People are meme-ing but I've made good plays with pebble. Play With Your Food can be fun, and effective/helpful for certain killers. 
---
[Obligatory.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfBHEIANFSA)
---
If you have the cypress you deserve it imo unless your teammates were absolute dogshit.
---
I mean if you’re new everyone else in your games sucks too so just ignore them lol
---
what event what in tarnation
---
Honestly 
---
Be beep milt
---
One more question, if you don't mind. Have you noticed high ranked survivors seem to be shite lately? I've been pulling off stuff I normally wouldn't be able to (4-mans as Freddy; gen grabs as Amanda) and don't really juke me in chases, outside of only a few survivors. Maybe it's just me but I haven't had to fall back to nurse for winning.
---
Actually some pretty decent Survivor perks but nothing too meta. These are the kinds of shrines I like to see honestly: just fun perks that you might like but aren't mandatory. :)
---
Getting out of low rank survivor matches is hell because of this. I'm pretty firmly a killer main at this point because survivor matches just don't even feel worth the effort. I'm gonna use killer BP to level my survivors after I get all the killer teachables I need.
---
example: I looped someone for 4-5 minutes, ran out of pallets, got hooked, and when I got the survivor aura reveal on the hook, all 3 of my teammates were wandering around the map crouched, randomly getting in lockers, and getting chests. I got one hooked because none of them even turned in my direction to save me, even waited out both stages in full. Most of the time otherwise, if another survivor gets hooked first, they don't even struggle and quit, probably because no one ever comes to save them.
---
Diversion is pretty much a meme with how useless it is. But maybe one or twice you might be able to fool a killer.
---
Try hooking them still
---
oohhhh, well now im embarrassed. (i've only owned the game for like a month?)
---
What? 
---
Maybe next Hallowed Blight (or w,e they name the Halloween event this year). Since it will be old and the new skins will be the "in" thing.
---
THE KILLER SAW MY AURA WHEN THEY HAD AURA READING FUCKING BITCH HACKER
---
I love hackusations when people don't look at perks. Get Distortion if Aura Reading is dicking you over.
---
Also that DCer's Medkit causes me physical pain. It would last the entirety of 2 seconds before being used up.
---
If you leave the hatch injured they’ll follow you and smack you
---
Fact is gens are gonna get done unless a survivor d/c right away and fucks the group. Its rare when killers can get a 4k without having at least one gen done. But mostly its like the other guy said. You have 4 survivors who all have purple or red toolboxes with the best add ons and watch 4 gens pop in 3 mins. Youd have to be up against a 4 man sfw or the best randos on planet earth.
---
They still haven't fixed this? Wonderful.
---
Agree 100% especially for survivors. You can earn so many more BPs by letting the killer kill you and just starting another game.
---
Please.
---
If you get injured near the Hatch, the speed boost and the Killers wipe animation will guarantee you an escape, even if they down you as long as you’re on top of it you can also 100% escape.
---
If they’re camping on top waiting for you to exit, the idea is to lure them away/pallet stun them and then book it to the Hatch. It’s not always ideal, because most of the time all the pallets nearby are broken, but if you have Sprint Burst/Dead Hard, that can help you stall enough time to make it back over before they do.
---
Ikr...... Kate's tits jiggle.
---
You should probably calm down with your pseudo-psychoanalysis. Depressed people or stressed people aren't arbitrarily assholes. Stop generalizing, it makes you look ignorant and bigoted.
---
Most of these people with tons of hours in DBD or similar multiplayer games are just typical jackass kids/college kids that have too much time on their hands and think they're supposed to be the best at everything, and take every loss as a personal sleight. They're entitled and haven't had their dose of life kicking them in the ass to understand how stupid acting like that makes them look.
---
January 30, 19:00 UTC
---
Around what time does the new event start?
---
By the end of the game there aren’t many pallets left and sprint burst and dead hard are both bad perks
---
It is balanced , your not supposed to be on even footing with the killer in a 1v1 situation , this is a asymmetrically balanced game. If your the last survivor alive and your in a staredown with the killer then you should just get fucking killed.
---
Gotta start 'em young
---
lol why are there so many rules for killers? you can't face camp, you can't tunnel, you can't block the exit, you can't hit a guy when he's on the exit switch....
---
They have an official store:
---
http://store.deadbydaylight.com/
---
I have the black/red Bloodletting shirt and it's amazing in person; the survivors within the mask area are a nice touch. It ships from Europe though, so it can take awhile to arrive (I think it took almost a month, but this was back when the store first launched so I don't know if they've gotten quicker with the orders).
---
Etsy and eBay also have unofficial merch
---
Explain ! 
---
I don't know why it wouldn't be a good game.
---
So, you pulled someone out of a basement locker and think they're holding hostage? You have four hooks right there. 
---
exactly what i wanna know 
---
I forgot to put in that I’m not about to pay custom fees for a t-shirt so I meant anywhere other than the legit merch. But thanks for being a smartass 
---
Can confirm, Meg does try to take aggro.
---
Source: I only play Meg.
---
Here in chile its 29 11:22 i would say its going to be later that day
---
Imagine that glory just flapping in the wind as he sprints around.
---
He walks with a limp for a reason after all ;)
---
You know, just because of the blood, gore, general gameplay of sacrificing people to the entity in the sky, you know, the "M" rating?
---
please tell me you’re kidding. 
---
All I'm saying is that I wasn't allowed to play games like that until I was in my late teenage years, that's all. They're called Mature games for a reason.
---
https://www.redbubble.com/shop/dead+by+daylight perhaps this one then? More unique/custom items. No idea about custom fees. 
---
PC? Would you say you're as good as ardetha or zubat?
---
Ehhhhh. The blood really isn't that bad; the unrealistic nature of the game sorta takes you out of the idea of actually putting another person on a meat hook and the like.

And as soon as I walk closer it shows [the building](https://i.imgur.com/CmYrnSb.jpg) as normal

Still kind of salty tbh...
---
&gt; you said you found him due to bitter murmur but lockers hide auras soooooooo.
---
...He saw his aura enter the locker then disappear. This isn't hard, mate
---
Just...bring a mori
---
Lol. It’s so frustrating. I don’t know how a bug like that made it in this last patch. 
---
Eh...I can sorta agree, but still disagree but still I just think there is a rating for a reason. But yeah there are worse "M" games out there
---
They’re scared of his power 
---
The point is that even though the sprint burst is a quarter done on cooldown, it's still helpfully telling me that I'm exhausted...and running with haste.
---
If they add shirtless Kate, they are never gonna sell another Kate top again. 
---
Personally I run BBQ Bitter HG and Ruin pretty effective for me and for add-on I'd say prayer beads and the purple talisman (can't remember name)
---
Yeah see the DS on the bottom corner? Killer probably had rancor and the guy didnt know 
---
*A U R I C  C E L L  E X C L U S I V E*
---
I mean... I guess white is a colour
---
The former.
---
A fucking lot. The grinding in this event is ridiculous. 
---
Make the petition, I'm signing it faster than you could say "trunks"
---
Originally, I was only going to do perks, but I love my deep breath boi so much I did a whole design for him.
---
Darth Vader/Anakin Skywalker - The Sith
---
Base Speed: 95%. (Vader never really was shown moving fast all that much.)
---
Terror radius: 8 meters. (Sith Lords should be able to influence fear, hence why it's so low.)
---
Power: The Force. While the meter is full, The Sith can grab a Survivor and throw them to the ground when they are performing an action that makes them vulnerable to normal grabs. Using this power fully depletes the meter, which takes 20 seconds to refill without add-ons.
---
Perks:
---
Just give up - *You become obsessed with one survivor. While your obsession is on the hook, your movement speed is increased by 10/12/15%.*
---
"Give yourself in to the Dark Side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong."
---
Hex: Torturer - *You enjoy inflicting pain on your enemies. After a successful attack, gain a token. For each token, all Survivors receive 2% penalties to Repair, Healing and Sabotage speeds. Maximum of 6/7/8 tokens.*
---
"Be careful not to choke on your convictions"
---
Presence of anger - *Your presence subconsciously increases the feelings of rage in others. Upon being stunned, all Survivors are unable to heal for 60/75/90 seconds*
---
"You have controlled your fear. Now, release your anger. Only your hatred can destroy me."
---
He tries to find the best, juiciest tastiest one for his collection of fingers.
---
Always judge event times on Eastern Standard Time, North America
---
It was like the 3rd dribble
---
Learn to run away effectively. This means using minimal pallets and using the most of windows and mind games 
---
How the fuck are you devotion 1 level 50 with 4 games as killer, jeez
---
I saw shit like this last night. Went against 2 prestige Claudettes, 1 Meg and a regular Bill that I think was pretty new to the game.
---
I only got one sacrifice in the match (prestige Meg) and I couldn't believe how badly the Claudettes cracked the shits.
---
They railed on him like he'd cost them the match.
---
You won, calm your farm knobheads
---
Because if each survivor had a unique unteachable perk, you would end up in situations like in other games where the “community” would decide what the most ideal group of survivors would be and bully people into playing those survivors, even if they didn’t want to. 
---
Meg is 102% speed
---
Claudette has faster healing
---
Jake sabo’s faster
---
Dwight has faster coop actions
---
Nea is quieter
---
Ace is luckier
---
David gains a larger speed boost after being hit
---
Laurie has larger aura reading abilities
---
Feng vaults faster
---
Their wiggle bar fills 33% for each drop. 3rd dribble = 99% wiggle bar
---
Then she probably struggled out normally. every time you drop a surv it advances their meter by like 30%
---
I mean I upvoted him.  But you have to realize for every killer there are 4 survivors so automatically not in your favor
---
I've seen that happen to noob3 before. He walked into the basment as the killer and the whole basement looked like that building until he came down the stairs and it was normal again. It was in a funny compilation otherwise I would post the video of it happening.
---
&gt;gets downvoted 
---
“Legion bad”

+999999 upvotes

What's BHVR?
---
If shaggy was a survivor he could ultra instinct dodge the killer haha
---
My game crashes now after I hit enter to skip the intro movie. Submitted a ticket - I verified my files - gonna reinstall the game next. :( 
---
Yep the thing u described also happened here and in some other games on different maps, it happens in like 2/10 games for me.
---
How can I get better at being chased by a killer? I've realized now I need to find pallets and windows and things to vault over. Is it vital that I turn the camera around and look at the killer as he's chasing me? How can I duck out the way when he's about to swing? I also know about running behind things and crouching down and crouching away, I lose killers sometimes doing that. 
---
I heard 2pm tomorrow
---
I feel like they might have mentioned that they could implement it, though I don't remember where.
---
Oh has that always been a thing?
---
I get your point, but she rarely actually hits anyone, and she's never sacrificed anyone lol
---
If you don't purchase some of the DLCS with real money, you will never unlock some characters and will never have the perks, so they are not free. Some killers can be bought with ingame currency, same with survivors.
---
True
---
I read this comment then immediately scrolled up and heard it too 
---
Yes, i think you used to be able to get away with 4 pickups like a year ago but not anymore.
---
If you had Deliverance, you shoulda stood over her so the killer couldn't pick them up. Either they down and hook you and you Deliverance away or they pick them up and you redeemed yourself slightly
---
It does. You were just holding onto her too long where it gave her the chance to use ds. You must of been holding onto her for like 2 secs. That's too long. 
---
Twice in the past few days I've used the offering that starts me as far from the killer as possible, and both times the killer immediately is there within 10 seconds. One of them was The Wraith. There's no way they spawned on the other side of the map and I did not get my offering back either time. What gives?
---
I can agree that there is a larger degree of greed on a killer who has already gotten 3 kills. I just don't think that all the blame should go towards them mainly because it does take two people to have an hour long standoff. It'd also be cool if the hatch wasn't such a piece of garbage gameplay feature that this would happen. While I certainly wouldn't ever go to these lengths for even a 1/4, I don't think players should be forced to just forfeit a kill/escape.
---
How does damaging the generators as a killer work? Do you just have to wander away a little bit from it or does someone have to start working on it again before you can do it?
---
legit though fuck that movie.
---
Fuck the wheelies.
---
Fuck the deadly desert.
---
Fuck that scary thot who swaps heads.
---
Film gave me more nightmares then any ACTUAL horror movie.
---
Hahahah that would be amazing! This post was originally about him being a killer lol
---
That's unfortunate. I'm glad they fixed some fast vault issues and the basement rubberbanding in that last patch
---
What are considered the most popular/best/must have perks for a survivor? 
---
At that point, I was out. I thought she was behind me. That's when I realized I blocked her. I feel so bad. She was good, too. 
---
It looks like somebody painted a face and put a wig on their thumb. 
---
Kate, Nea, Laurie, Meg, David and Tapp are top tier no conversation

hope it isnt my ssd lmao

Just Monika.

This is really cool
---
"I have you now, you musclebound oaf!"
---
Dude got a 4K with 3 perks and a brown add on lol
---
I bought myself the pizza Dwight shirt and I don’t think it’s going to show up because it was a couple months ago
---
I usually trap the first person i catch as long as the first gen hasn't popped. once 3 gens are done the next person gets the trap, i usually run noed on piggy (i absolutely despise the perk but how it synergises with the traps makes it worth running) so at the end game i have 2 traps and can get the insta down as well as a trap and a hook. usually if the gates are even open people leave their comrades behind cause of noed and i get a free kill by patrolling the boxes.
---
Been in this situation only once. Got tired of waiting after like 30 seconds and just hit her.
---
I have no clue how people spend hours doing that. It's a waste of time. I guess if the survivor was particularly toxic/annoying then it'd make sense based on principle but still...
---
i will not stand for this nea slander
---
I doubt its the case but its important to be sure.  You are not on wifi right?
---
*When you're chasing a surv and the gates open, activating NOED*
---
"The coward is running! Let's take him now!"
---
But then boosted survivor mains will lose their easymode.

THEY NEED THEIR EASY MODE YOU MONSTER

There is a game in the bug

Oh boy, i bet BBQ is finally....oh, maybe next week.
---
I remember when a couple 12 year olds tried stabbing their 12 year old friend to death in the woods to appease Slender Man. Good times.
---
You're right it's not balanced. It still favors the survivor since it's an escape that doesn't benefit the killer in any way.
---
17 +/- 1 hour from now.
---
What timezone?
---
It's called fashion look it up sweetie
---
None of what you described is cheating or exploits.
---
Unless just simply having more experience is cheating?
---
I am yes, tried many networks and it’s not changing anything. I’m gonna try verifying game cache to see if that works.
---
I always avoid 3/4 Claudettes, it's impossible to see
---
What did they say about hating the legion? I was taking a DbD break during his announcement 
---
Only one killer can Tea bag so maybe that's why it makes sense Tea bagging isn't bannable. Mind you, I don't really have a big opinion on this though. I don't think survivor teabagging is toxic or bannable either cause survivors have a very limited set of things they can do to express themselves so unless you want them to point at you then let them crouch as much as they like. As a survivor I use crouch to say thanks but some people see it as a mocking tool. I was in a game one time where the killer was gonna let me go near the hatch but I spun once to thank killer and he picked me up, killed me, and said it was cause I taunted. When I'm down I can't do anything else lol.
---
Nah, they need to pay for dedicated servers soon... Myers in Speedos is where the money will be.
---
But I rarely get killers who smack once. They always smack multiple times, with a nod or a head shake at times. And see, those downvotes definitely proved my point lol
---

---
Oh, I'm sorry, I just thought maybe you wouldn't be so flippant about the attempted murder of a 12 year old girl. That what it was, an attempted murder. Two girls tried to take the life of another girl. Maybe sarcastically referring to it on an internet thread to prove whatever point you were trying to prove isn't the best way to defend your position. But whatever
---
Depends on the Situation.
---
Is the killer currently chasing someone? Stay
---
Are there no nearby pallets and windows and the killer is not in a chase? I suggest to leave.
---
You feel competent in your ability to loop the killer and there are plenty of loops around? Might aswell stay.
---
I watched a video once on survivor tips and one of the main messages was: realize right off the bat that once a killer finds you, you are most likely going down (unless you pull off a god loop or the killer is new/inexperienced) and it’s just a part of the game. The only thing you can really control is how long it’s going to take for them to get you. The more time you kill, the more time you give your teammates who are (hopefully) working on gens while you get a chase. 
---
Once I started thinking this way, it eased my anxiety a lot when it came to being a good survivor. Anytime I can loop a killer for at least one gen, I consider the chase a win for me.
---
Wow! It’s useless!
---
I've seen this so many times. There's two lockers, side by side. I jump in. The killer is coming right at me and I'm shitting myself. They check the locker NEXT to me and leave.
---
Those downvotes, they’re a comin’
---
What? That's what they have been doing, taking there time rewriting large segments of code for the better and pumping out cosmetics. What the fuck are you complaining about?  
---
We all want MORE MORE NOW NOW NOW but patience pays off, were only a couple months away from dedicated servers and the big ass optimization patch.
---
This can only happen with dedicated servers. 
---
Think I was having a break at the time of that bug but lol. Sounds about as good/bad as some of the bugs in 2016-2017, would've been at least interesting to see how some killers felt like to play (against) if they had no Terror Radius.
---
Not with entire buildings, but I got it with some walls in the farm maps, like in the jungle jims and T- Walls. The wall would look like that and blink before looking normal again... I think it's a rendering problem of some sort, I don't know much about the technical details about it, but since the engine update it seems like the maps are taking a little longer to fully "load", so to speak. 
---
As much as it's funny, it's still super bad for our ears.

That was great!

And the one above the basement on the ski lodge.

Are we, though? Remember the December patch? They've already shown themselves to be liars.
---
The main point I'm trying to get across is that it shouldn't release in such a shit state anyways. That should be absolutely unacceptable, especially considering just how fucking bad it was. And still is.
---
Doesn't mean it's not yawn worthy. It'd be much more interesting if you could, you know, actually *see* Freddy preparing himself to push his glove through the survivor's chest, but you can't. It's literally nothing except the survivor getting up confused, then Freddy pushes his hand through their chest. That's nothing compared to how complex other moris are.
---
This made me lol
---
Tbh it could be people who just dont have time to play alot. In a usual rank one player but I've been busy recently so havent been able to get past rank 10
---
I thought it was great!
---
Probably, that's why I said iirc lol.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂 this has to be the stupidest thing I’ve ever read. If you’re trolling people GG but if you’re not wow 
---
Flashlight will remove the trap as well.. but even rank 1 people who have been playing since her release fall victim to the mind games.
---
I play alot of SWF with higher and lower ranks. Tbh it's not even on purpose. I go in the DBD discord and play with who ever joins me. It's not purposely looking for high ranks so I get "ez killers"
---
who cares what randoms on the internet think about you man
---
a killer that can die 🤔🤔🤔
---
What I think he was trying to say is that maybe 5 is a little young to play such a mature game and sometimes horror games or movies can make sacrificing/killing people okay in a kid’s mind. But at the end of the day it’s your child and your decision so it’s not really up to strangers on the internet to tell you how to parent :’D 
---
Oof now at -3
---
I must confess that I am feng :(
---
Well you may need to buy a long cable to plug directly into your router then.  Wifi connections often stutter like that.
---
I'm just trying to figure out what point you're trying to make. If you have something to tell me about how I'm raising my daughter, you could just come out and say it directly. 
---
this is the real question right here... fml
---
Follow up, how do I get better at pallet looping and getting around killers? Fairly new to the game so I’m not that good
---
Wait. Especially if you blew the gen with someone else helping on it with you. You gotta be the one to take the first hit if the killer comes
---
I can't say for certain but will probably be around 12 hours
---
sex: no one escapes orgasm 
---
it’s a five year old. They won’t be in the thought process that your claiming
---
Megs usually don’t survive anyway so it’s nothing new
---
Hey man, trying them for fun. Any advices to not get stomped?
---
"And any man who has to say he is king is no true king"
---
trees do it to killers and survivors now.....

Quick tip on how to level up faster if you want to prestige a character at least once this method works very easily, slightly harder if not. Focus on brown add ons and offering and when there are 2 perks go for one of them immediately the entity will start talking nodes and the web will end quicker. Also bamboozle on Spirit is crazy since she doesn't have a vault animation.
---
This is brilliant and I expect to see it in the next patch
---
As a Spirit Main, I love BBQ &amp; Chilli with her. If you like some chaos, I really recommend Make Your Choice for her. It's a good combo for BBQ and it really helps. However, I really like mixing Hex: Haunted Grounds with Ruin or Hex: Huntress' Lullaby. I've seen people using Hex: Devour Hope with HG as well, but I really had some fun with Lullaby. Ruin helps as you go up in ranks, since people do gens really quick.  
---
I hope you have a good time as a killer and good luck! May you get some great matches with Spirit, as she's a great and really fun killer to use. &lt;3 
---
Oh no the grammar police are here! Get better at life if this is really want you’re worried about 
---
ty !!
---
You're talking about the wiggle progression. The other guy was asking if dribbling was removed because he failed it. Read the actual question. 
---
Misses the obligatory "Survivor lures killer to you"
---
And then they came out posting a more detailed roadmap of what is going on. The optimization patch for December DID happen, it was the engine upgrade. Despite what the subreddit wants to believe the game didn't actually start going downhill for everyone. I got a decent visual/performance boost from the new engine. At worst they are guilty of overhyping it without knowing for sure what the impact would be.  
---
They already fixed the audio/visual glitches that stemmed from it less than a month after it came out.
---
You right. Shoulda put that besides taps ruin
---
Why are there crows around her head?
---
OMG That Nea is on point. I am a fan of the Mega cosplay too.
---
So painfully true
---
Hey friend, as a fellow legion fan I do agree with the other comments here that this type of experience is because you were playing legion. Legions kit is honestly nurse but easier movement and harder to down. 
---
BUT, fuck that noise, this is a game you spent money to play so play who the hell you want to play, the way you want to play them. 
---
Standard toxic Legion build: BBQ, Sloppy Butcher, Bloodhound, fill the 4th with your favorite. I switch between ruin, remember me, and discordance. Enjoy slowing the game "more than just a lil bit" and following neon trails of blood even in corn maps. 
---
Most importantly, have fun, you don't need to stick around for the post match chat just re-queue :) 
---
Pebble time has begun.
---
He really doesn't like nurse's. Funny thing is I don't even main nurse I just play her like 1 or twice a month she is just my favorite character cosmetic wise
---
OH SHIT PEBBLE TIME
---
FIRE UP FIRE UP FIRE UP FIRE UP
---
Are you talking about the hidden killer perks or the rank difference. The new latch makes it that you have to wait till everyone is dead before seeing the killers perk. If it is about the difference in rank and you are not in a swf, then that is hilarious and I feel for you.
---
Missed those by three weeks, pal. Hate to break it to you 
---
This is incredibly situational, and depends also on your (and the Killer's) rank. If you're low rank (under 14), don't hide in a nearby locker after failing a skill check. That's one of the first places a low-rank Killer will think to look. Instead, consider hiding nearby around a T-wall or someplace you blend in easily; consider walking around the obstacle out of sight of the Killer if at all possible.
---
If one of your teammates is currently being chased or if they've just gotten hurt after you fail the skill check, you're *probably* okay to continue working on the generator. It's actually seldom that a Killer will break off what they're doing if they hear you blow a generator, unless they're having a particularly hard time.
---
I was thinking about going after Ruin so I could pair it with Haunted Grounds in hopes it may would throw some people off, haha. But thank you so much for the tips! I definitely need to get more perks on her and practice with her because I’m honestly .... no good, lol. 
---
But thank you! I hope you do, too. 😭
---
You know why? Ochido’s fanbase downvoted it on the PTB survey. The devs are idiots for not adding it
---
When you're playing Myers and spawn in a corn field
---
&gt;If they haven't left yet, cunt? Good to know Douche-canoe. Thank you.
---
I thought I was the only person that called people 'douche-canoes.' I'm no longer alone anymore. 
---
Never knew Yoda was in DBD
---
It's a bot that helps them de-rank and helps survivors farm.
---
Without any sacrifices or deviousness killers are almost always guaranteed a de-pip. Since if survivors find them they will farm out chase and brutality so the survivors can build altruism. Survivors in those games can easily double pip. 
---
It creates a pretty bad imbalance of possible high skill killers at low ranks once the bots done its job and low skill survivors at high ranks. 
---
:( 
---
You know visual boosts do not always mean a performance degradation right? Based on the post they made the game just wastes resources doing nothing because of inefficiency at it's core. They haven't even been free from there publisher a year yet and shit like rewriting large sections of code is not something done quickly.
---
And the game clearly got better lighting and use of shadows, a couple places could use a few touchups but whatever, an improvement is an improvement.
---
You can complain whenever you want, don't expect that it's supposed to have any weight just because you're personally fed up about it, there publisher set the direction they should be going, now that they are on there own they have set a new direction of bug fixing and optimizations, as well as actual balance changes. 
---
You want a god nurse? 
---
https://youtu.be/I_lk2FdEdo8
---
Runs right into him and gets the biggest jump scare of all time
---
2700 IS as well...
---
Was she behind you that whole time? 
---
In general, aim the flashlight at or slightly below the Killer's face; you will know when the flashlight has successfully blinded the Killer because the beam will conspicuously flash outwards for a split second. Bear in mind that the time it takes to blind the Killer is affected by the angle you're shining the light, the light's add-ons, and whether the Killer is looking directly at you, towards the sky, or towards the ground. If it's those last two, you're better off not trying, honestly.
---
Every fucking time 
---
No. Like you say, they’re the ones choosing to ignore the ping measures so they’re the ones on the wring
---
Or when i'm crouching to save a person and instead of them already hitting the crouch button when they're taken off, they just fuckin stand all in it blowing the traps up. Hello? I know you saw the hag put the traps there. I know you saw me crouching, not setting them off, to safely unhook you. Why are you standing and running!??! 
---
Fine, let me spell it out for you: Those 12 year olds tried murdering their friend because their dipshit parents didn't do their jobs and filter the content they consumed from the internet/videogames/movies. 
---
You're letting a 5 year old play a game where you chase people around, stab them until they can no longer run, then hook them to appease The Entity.
---
You call me a sociopath, and I call you a child abuser.
---
To add to this, earlier today I got to 35 on Hag with around 900k.
---
Awwwww 💕 
---
Every possible scenierio. Can we get an oof in chat bois?
---
I mean... r/woosh
---
In all seriousness, I can see her in a bra or bathing suit. They should add a bathing suit collection for the summer for all the original characters.
---
Bold of you to assume a claudette has ever missed a flashlight save, unless of course they're not powered up with the full t3 outfit's energy
---
As a person who has been playing Billy nonstop for the past few days, I say he is balanced. I also have been playing Legion and the way I play is balanced.
---
Ok, so every game where you and your friends do well, someone has to leave the exit gate and go kill themselves on hook? You've already had a good or great game, the killer on the other hand has got comparatively less points. Now, go figure.
---
*survs start t-bagging*
---
Doesn't matter, because Shirtless!Myers fixes everything. 
---
Aside from looking for the killer and listening for audio cues (I.e terror radius, lullaby etc) you could equip a perk. For example, Premonition which actives when you’re looking in the direction of a killer within a certain distance 
---
I got called a racist for tunneling an Adam Francis earlier.  I don’t give a crap what he thinks. 
---
I just don’t like jean jackets I think they are tacky. 
---
Why does it look like a shitty mobile game. 
---
It's be more fun if it had a base move speed increase of 5%, and make it have up to 2/3/4 tokens. 
---
^^ This is really the crux of the issue. When you only play half the game you can only see one half of the issues and can't weigh it fairly. 
---
I encourage everyone to play both sides as evenly as possible, honestly I switch sides every time I lose (first sacrificed or 1k games) not only does it help my game play but I know the struggles and tomfoolery both sides are capable of. 
---
darn i really also wanted enduring and we’re gonna live forever
---
Yep. Here's what they do.
---
Diversion: P E B B L E  T I M E
---
Distract an inattentive killer (guess what, I'm not). Stay in their terror radius without being chased for 45 seconds in order to do so. 
---
Calm Spirit: You are one with the wild and very stoic. The killer is only further pissed by your current lack of screaming. 
---
Shadowborn: Higher Field of View YAY (I already have this one teachable, so yay for 150000 blood points)
---
Play With Your Food: The old fashioned way. By letting that jackass with Decisive Strike live despite all Karma stacked against them.
---
All you need to do is get 4kills, moris and dcs both count. Sometimes it just doesnt unlock for whatever reason. You did make sure to use only his 3 teachables right?
---
You can't refund DLC, I tried to refund the clown one cause I hated playing clown but it got denied.
---
I laughed so hard 😂
---
You deserve to have negative -100 karma and to drink bad milk
---
I actually like Save the Best for Last. Having the stun time post-successful hit be essentially removed is huge.
---
What is probably happening is they see a secret offering which means either:
---
1. 4 survivors started together
---
2. Someone's on the other side of he map.
---
I saw this and found them in seconds by running to the other side of the map.
---
Well if you put that much time into learning nurse you should be allowed to excel. That's what I love about this game. There's no luck involved. If you're good you have a clear advantage over others, which is perfectly fine to me. Also that argument can be put for any killer. Doctor breaks game because his attacks go through stuff. Legion breaks game because insta down from deep wound. Leather face breaks game cuz insta down. Literally every perk, survivor, and killer "break the game mechanics". That's what makes them unique.
---
What the hell OP? Has things here dried up that badly?
---
With... Four tier 3 perks and Instaheals? Probably not...
---
The map that came with the Saw DLC, Gideon Meat Packing Plant (or something along those lines) is its name, the "realm" it falls under is called "The Game."
---
I’m Shaggy like a looping them
---
Pretty sure closing the game just does the same thing, survivors can do it as well to deny the 2.5 k bonus in the event the killer 4k’s
---
I know. It’s soooooooooo scurry. Disney’s pretty sick!
---
This is absolutely a needed change. If going against a swf it could make perks like bloodwarden or haunted grounds pointless 
---
&gt;the only legitimate reason to have it that I could thijnk of is so swfs can't tell eachother the perks after death
---
I mean, that's huge, and is exactly the reason why that ability was removed. 
---
Age ratings really mean nothing to some people
---
Killer deserves double points for class and sportsmanship 
---
Just cleanse totems lol
---
Its a really safe guess given that's a week or so after the event ends and the last cosmetic drop
---
I think this issue is directly related to frequent disconnects from people. I was playing with friends in a party of four, infinite load was initiated for all of us. As soon as 3 people quit the game, the last guy loaded in. That happened 3 times.
---
**NAME** Leatherface
---
**STAND** Ultimate camp
---
**POWER** when people enter his domain, they become tethered to the area, unable to escape!!
---
Yep. That scares 'em out. 
---
This is normally what I would do, but this Shape is running NOED :(
---
It sucks for the reason you stated, but so good against SWF. 
---
You forgot the “run the killer around for 4 minutes and when he gets off you someone downs immediately”
---
Moris count. Got adept nurse with 3 moris. 
---
Grow up 
---
yeah actually looks like they played enough for some teachables and that instaheal guy probably hasn't played since October. Doesn't mean they're any good though so they may aswell be new players, not sure why it's worth posting on Reddit about though :\ this happens all the time
---
I wish they made it like STBFL and made it so you lose the tokens when you hit the obsession.  A good perk that is being held back by a horrible restriction. 
---
That doesn't mean you'll get it, either. Thanks for the technique, Monto. 
---
Maybe because I use Low video settings ? I don't know, looks and feels fine for me tho.
---
Those are Stillness Crows, which begin to arrive after a short period of time in which a Survivor doesn't perform any actions and doesn't move around enough. At three Stillness Crows (as you see here), they make a visible sound notification for the Killer.
---
Stay busy!
---
Did someone hurt your feelings?
---
Tell that to almost every survivor I’ve done gens with. Usually it is me being hot/chased when the other guy blew the check lol
---
How to do it? No, but it’s fairly intuitive anyways. As the name suggests however it allows a user to prestige their characters to prestige 3 in a matter of thirty seconds even if they’ve never touched the character. I would assume you could use this glitch to unlock teachables, but I honestly don’t know because I really don’t want to deal with the mental stress of maybe losing hundreds of hours worth of grind just because my lazy ass decided to try and cheat the system for some stupid cosmetics. That’s pretty much all it is, but we’ve seen only a few bans out of the many many people who have claimed to have done it and what not.
---
I'm curious to see how this will play out lol
---
What am I supposed to do about teams that are communicating with mic.  It totally breaks the game.  Every player knows where I am all the time even though the characters aren't supposed to be able to communicate like this.  Seems like a major flaw in the game, having to balance between teams that communicate and those that don't is impossible.  
---
Franks bloody timbs be lookin fresh af lmao
---
Can someone explain to me whats going on here?
---
A second?   &gt;:(
---
I think I'm not doing too bad:  
---
[https://youtu.be/egmD4aWeXzc?t=40](https://youtu.be/egmD4aWeXzc?t=40)
---
He gave you a theoretical scenario where the survivors get an equally strong victory: 4 people survive. Does one person have to leave the exit gate and give the killer a free kill just because he got comparatively less points that game?
---
The answer is obviously no. There's no reason to give up the satisfaction nor the extra points victory gives just to even the score with the other side.
---
Same applies to hatch stand-offs. Why should the killer give up the extra points/satisfaction of a 4k just because the survivor got less points due to their team losing? Why should the survivor give up the points/satisfaction of escape just to give the killer his 4k? Neither side has a good reason to back down. That's why hatch stand-offs exist and that's why both players are at fault when they occur: everyone's just too stubborn to give up and lose.
---
That’s kind of the point
---
The hag’s ability hurts my feelings. Can I delete it?
---
That buff's been there since 1.3.0. Literally years. 
---
It's just the chests themselves got buffed, and combined with plunderers you get a much higher chance.
---
Matching the speed of the prompt on your screen is generally all you need to do.
---
I mean I thought the point was to teleport across the map to within 10 feet of a survivor, and force people to crouch around objectives, but I guess not.
---
I mean yeah the killers busted but people like him spent money on the dlc and just telling them not to play it isn’t the best way to go about the whole ordeal.
---
DS tarnished my soul
---
The map that came out with the Pig. The meat packing plant.
---
Yep. It’s always a claud I’m working on a gen with that’ll just urban evade away as soon as she blows it up. Ridiculous 
---
No problem I have 1600 hours in the game so I love giving info to people they have never heard before and leather can be kinda fun if you go spark plug tuning guide for insta saw but yeah not really my thing either if you want any other tips I love giving them 😀
---
last halloween event took about 1-3 games per coin, depending on how many people used nectar offering etc, and each cosmetic cost 10 currency if it helps :) 
---
Big facts 
---
holY SHiT
---
they were glitch on a box on other side carried them to hatch after finding out how to do glitch and they didnt make it lol
---
The amount of downvotes I got is proof of this.
---
Hiding in plain sight.. I like it!
---
Play him.
---
Person after my own heart
---
I swear to fucking god they somehow made it this way on purpose lol it happens so often
---
That was terrible lol. Spent way too late ng chasing that david
---
The song in question
---
[The Shape Chase Allyson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8H3M0DDWDs)
---
Me completely focused on the gen:
---
Me about to scratch my nose: |
---
I look away for a second and bam! Skillcheck! I try and leave the Gen? Skillcheck! So &gt;:(
---
That would be absolutely terrifying lol. That song was amazing. Would love for that song to be his chase music.
---
Balanced in a underwhelming way or overpowered way? Just getting into the game and I honestly just like his character model lol wondering if it's worth putting time into.
---
I think it depends on the child in question, their general family environment, dozens of other factors.
---
I've loved horror since I was born but I've always perceived a sharp and healthy divide between fantasy and reality.
---
What harmed me more was being ostracized or treated like I was bad because I was a kid who liked scary stuff (when I didn't do anything bad, just wrote stories or drew pictures).
---
But
---
There are definitely kids who need more supervision and people who have trouble with fantasy vs reality, even as adults.
---
Soooo, it's case by case. I think there are some movies/games that would be wildly inappropriate for kids (even well adjusted and in good environment s) but DBD isn't one. It's M rating, involves killing, but not very graphic or realistic.
---
&gt; plays most cancer killer in the game
---
&gt; wonders why people are toxic to him 
---
If you wanna play legion you’re gonna have to get used to it because the higher you rank up the more often people are gonna just dc as soon as they know which killer you are. 
---
I get preferences lol no worries then, I relate to her a lot cuz MUSICCCCC
---
then again I do agree blonde, blue eyes, southern gal is pretty much an abused stereotype.
---
We NEED A LATINO MUSICAN so I can be happy 😄
---
Survivors are not meant to help you you know?
---
Well billy doesn't really need a nerf. Only his insta saw addons need to be looked at. 
---
And I just bought Adam T.T
---
That or ET with a wig.
---
Stop playing legion. I will dc.You know damn well why you are getting insulted.
---
That chart is pretty accurate. I main Kate and I'm always doing gens. I ain't got no time to unhook other survivors, lol!
---
Like you said, survivor is unfun against nurse in the same way that every m1 killer but billy is unfun as well. A good nurse can be painful to go against, but she’s not game breaking in the sense that all she does is shift the balance of power from the survivors to the killer. 
---
Normally the skill ceiling for survivor is higher or equal to the skill ceiling of various killers, but nurse is the only one with a skill ceiling higher than that of a survivor. That being said, the same arguments apply to nurse that apply to survivor being too powerful against most killers. To say there is no counterplay to the nurse and that there’s nothing you can do is pretty wrong, at the end of the day if she’s really good then she will come out on top in the same way the survivors do against most killers, but how good you are still affects how long or difficult it will be to catch you, thus affecting the overall success of your team. 
---
And, I get you may have written this coming out of a match against a nurse that felt OP or something but running into god nurses is seriously not that common of an occurrence. Having 1000 hours on any single killer is nuts and boring as all hell to do unless it’s over a year or more’s worth of time.
---
Removed, uncivil.
---
Ding dong your opinion is wrong. Kate’s the only one in the game I’d smash, maybe meg too. 
---
What's BM?
---
Try Bloodhound and Sloppy Butcher on Legion. Then watch them struggle.
---
You are the hero Gotham desperately needs! :p
---
Bubba in a wife beater &amp; whitey tighties 💎🖤💎
---
No because killers still get more points for a 0k than survivors do if they just do gens and escape
---
They already announced it on stream and the exact time as well. Tomorrow at 2PM Eastern time lasting exactly two weeks.
---
Seems like you don't want to nerf Billy and Nurse, but buff other killers. And that's a right way of thinking.
---
Time to make a dead by daylight bingo sheet bingo sheet
---
Can someone explain to me why is the community obsessed with Freddy? He is so boring to play as and against. He just walks and press M1 occasionally. 
---
Trapper is fun because you can laugh at survivors running into your traps.
---
Spirit is fun because you can literally stay still and survivors will panic.
---
Billy is fun because you just zoom around the map.
---
Huntress is fun because you get to snipe people.
---
Nurse is not as fun but she just ignores everything so you can't get annoyed or bored. 
---
Myers is fun with his scratched mirror build, is one of the few jump scares moments left in DBD. 
---
Every other killer is just dull to play as, specially Pig and Freddy. 
---
They’re unbalanced in the sense that a small buff or nerf to one side of their gameplay makes them either more annoying to play against or more frustrating to play as. A killer who can nullify survivor escape methods, can get easiest first hits and can negate/nullify stealth, and can win chases with massive ease means they’re very hard to balance correctly. 
---
No. There's not. It's literally not bingo unless it's twenty-five spaces. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(U.S.)
---
If I'm wrong, find it for me. 
---
Bloodhound, Shadowborn and Predator. I just got it now after winning again. Thanks anyway :)
---
Pointing out that proposed changes are ridiculously strong (almost like old Bloodlust 3 that won't reset on pallet breaks or on first hit) isn't allowed? It's not a part of a discussion?
---
Wired connections are always a more stable option. WiFi is unpredictable and can cause issues like this sporadically. It's definitely a worthwhile option to look into.
---
The verifying of the cache may work too, once you've done that. Fingers crossed.
---
Welcome to the DBD community here's your complementary toxic survivor basket you get it whether you want it or not so uhhh have fun
---
Interpret my comment in whatever way that pleases you most. Seems like you’re fishing for an argument so I’d rather not
---
FYI I’m a survivor main. No further comments. Thank you for your time
---
I’ll get you mojowaters! You wait and see. I’ll be revving the saw right in your face while you hang there and wave them arms. 
---
It's actually bing bong, like the wraith.
---
Considering on PS4 I mained Jake, and then when I got it on PC I chose Kate.............
---
What's happens if you try to glitch a character past P3?
---
Already verified, no luck. 😔 thanks for your help!
---
See, there's discussing things, and there's being an overly aggressive cunt about your stance on it.
---
Which do you think you came off as?
---
It doesn't stack, only one person needs to run it. 
---
I'm that teammate who can't hit ruin skillchecks. Sorry :'D
---
Spirit is not easy to play,
---
Make sure you check everyone's ping to you in the lobby.
---
I've seen this happen from the opposite end - some survivors were so laggy they were teleporting out of the killer's range because they'd gone into a match with awful ping. (they'd forgotten to check because they were talking and not paying attention)
---
My recommendation is that if people are &gt;200 ping, you should probably remake your lobby. You can't kick people from it otherwise.
---
I'm sorry if this isn't helpful to you.
---
If you were lucky you could get a vial in one game as a survivor and as killer you just needed to focus your correct hooks and you could get a vial in one game easy as hell. 
---
I assume you want me to choose answer b, except I'm failing to see any aggression in my comment.
---
Shame if you're playing Meg though,  2thicc. Saw the corn parting like the Red Sea as if Moses himself was straddling her hips from my mighty tractor before I lethal blink as Nurse onto them.
---
Oh... ok, thanks, i didn't notice.
---
This is adorable. but however, that'd be quite odd. I feel like rather than have him stunned and groan on the doors. you'd have to drop the survivor, hunch over,which at doors would prompt a "Drag" command and then you'd have to pick them up again. If you were to bring them to basement, you'd have to stay hunched.
---
Not sure about them, but you’re definitely coming off as an “aggressive cunt.”
---
you need to breath 
---
No worries. Just look for it or work on a gen by yourself, brother - HH
---
Q.Q my heart wasnt ready
---
I actually dig this idea. If the Entity feels the hatch was earned then have it spawn immediately. If the team got owned and the Killer earned the 4k....then sure--AT LEAST make the last survivor who hid the whole time do a gen to get it to spawn. 
---
The problem though is that the hatch standoff would still be a thing. In that case....a survivor popping a gen could reopen it. Or there is a timer for the "close" mechanic. This would force a Killer to at least proxy the Gens and the hatch. And make the survivor run away and do something if the hatch is closed. It would be Killer-sided as it is a 1v1 with a lot for the survivor to do...but at least there would be hope and interaction...not just a stare down. I don't think the Killer should get a free 4k because they close the hatch once. Nor a 7K point escape for camping the hatch spawns. 
---
I dodge them even as a survivor. I ask if they are running urban and if they are i leave. If they dont answer i leave. 
---
That shit's a warm-up. 4 pages? I can get that done in an hour if I procrastinate hard enough and let the guilt hit maximum levels before I start. 
---
Wtf!! What a horrible teammate, I'm so sorry
---
I'd suggest watching youtube videos on how to loop the killer around various tiles and also watching streamers like Jendenise, Vooshy, Noob3, Boxghost etc. who know how to loop and also do so on stream (instead of just memeing).
---
And yes, it is VERY import to look at the killer while being chased. You can't "duck out the way" when he's swinging but you'll know where he is and won't get mindgamed so easily.
---
Running behind things and crouching away is VERY situational and most likely won't lose a decent killer.
---
Oh hey look!  No BBQ!
---
Whatever happened to that optimization patch in December? 2 months later...
---
I see Freddy moved to the survivor side, good lad doing totems
---
Has ruin ever been in the shrine?
---
My girlfriend is just petty.  She's petty enough to wait all night for the hatch standoff and I believe her.
---
Me on the other hand, I just don't care.  Mercy or not, I jump in.  And I don't do hatch standoffs as a killer so I just whack a mole and let 'em go.
---
I'd rather have more killers on Billy or Nurse level than more on Trapper or Pig level.  Killers with different strengths make for different gameplay. 
---
Killers doing the same thing slightly differently is boring. 
---
Because she is normally flat chested.
---
Also, clipping. It happens a lot. 
---
lol i don't think he's talking about your grammar 
---
Wait a minute. Let's say I have a generator at 99% and the killer comes and kicks it and decides to camp around it. Will it eventually go back to 0% with a single kick if I don't tap it after a while? I thought the Gen would just go back like 10% (or whatever) with each kick. Have I been screwing myself over? lol
---
What they mean with bodyblocking is using it on the killers side to trap one or many survivors and hold the game hostage 
---
As far as i know, using it to secure a hit as killer and tanking a hit as survivor are considered fair game, anything that prevents the game from ending isn't
---
Actually, we're called *Grammar Nazis*. Get it right, and use punctuation. 
---
who is ready for some awful matches during this event? cant wait to not actually get to play the game for 2+ weeks
---
Shh.. Don't tell people this.  Don't take this away from us Hag mains.
---
But Discipline is the fake red stain. Restraint is the empowered Doctor Illusions.
---
It’s best not to think about balance too much when playing DbD. If you’re playing Killer and it’s frustrating for you to gain a lead or snowball off of mistakes, unless you want to play one of the top 3 forever and not have any variety for fear of the spooky dreaded SWF, just play to enjoy the gameplay of the killer and just go next if it’s frustrating. 
---
Thx
---
That's fair. I only have Tier 1 of it on Myers and no one else yet 
---
Well Enduring is on the shrine every other week so that shouldn't be an issue.
---
Oh snap, thanks for the info! I've been playing for a while and didn't even know this. Idk how I didn't notice either lol.
---
Welp guess thats what I get for assuming the survivor in question was any good. Anyways makes sense , cheers.
---
Play as killer and take notice of what they do. 
---
A Gen loses roughly 1 second of progress for every 4 seconds it spends regressing. So while a killer could camp a generator until it resets back to zero, they'd be giving free reign to the rest of the map in order to do so.
---
You need to have a **calm spirit**, here have some **BBQ &amp; Chilli**.
---
Fucking CLICKBAIT.
---
This is me when I am struggling with diarrhea in a public restroom. 
---
Do you understand the meaning of parity? It means to start on equal footing. At the start of every match both teams are given it , I see no reason why one side should suddenly be as powerful the other simply because their team failed. I agree with the hatch closing and grab changes though , but a minute is far too long , if not for balance then for pure boredom 10 seconds is much more reasonable. Would also need to make it so a survivor can't jump in mid close.
---
But you can't see blood when spirit phases.
---
I disconnect when I see that yamamoke (or whatever...) map offering.
---
Welp, back to the drawing board! 
---
Freddy is fun to play if you put multiple to sleep or use Pill Bottle to make survivors freak out. The way people play freddy though (put one to sleep and tunnel) and then complain that hes bad dont realize how stupid they are.
---
Best build in my opinion is :
---
Bond/Aftercare, Iron Will, Kindred, Borrowed Time. Then bring in a med kit. 
---
People will say you need an exhaustion perk. Let me explain why I don’t use one. Lithe and Balanced Landing are heavily dependent on the map you get. Many times, you’ll be in a chase just hoping for a chance to use it and that chance never comes. Of course it’s amazing when you bring Lithe into Lery’s or Balanced Landing into Haddonfield, but those odds are slim. That brings us to Dead Hard and Sprint Burst. Dead Hard at the red ranks is useful one time. That’s it. Over. Done. Good killers will remember you have it after that and they’ll bait it out. That leaves Sprint Burst. It’s great sure. But walking around the map all day long waiting to use it is not fun or effective.
---
Next people will say Kindred? What? Yes. Kindred. At the red ranks, seconds are vital. Kindred allows your entire team to see each other when you’re hooked. This can help teammates heal each other, find gens, and not waste those precious seconds with everyone coming across the map to unhook me. As I stated, seconds matter. I can’t tell you how many times at the red ranks that ten seconds more or less on a gen was the difference between four escapes and one. Kindred eliminates wasted time with multiple people coming to unhook and it also allows teammates to see each other for any other means necessary.
---
Bond and Aftercare are debatable which is better. They are once again so important. Seeing your teammates in a game with no comms is a game changer. 32 meters is a lot farther than you think too when it comes to Bond. You can find teammates to heal each other and gens. This is why I don’t bring in Self Care.
---
Borrowed Time is a complete game changer. It allows those risky end game hooks to succeed. It ensures that the killer will spend more time chasing off the unhooked person if they’re tunneling. It does a lot of things, and against any good killer, Borrowed Time is pretty close to a necessity.
---
Iron Will. If you’ve played killer with a good headset, you know how much Iron Will matters. You can forget about losing the killer in red ranks without it. Unless you’re lucky. They’ll zero in on you in a heartbeat and then the chase is on again. I’ve experimented a little without it at red ranks and it wasn’t pretty.
---
Med Kit. There will be times where your Bond or Aftercare aren’t enough. Or maybe you just need to heal quick right here and now. Med Kit has you covered as a backup plan in those situations. Don’t waste a perk slot on Self Care. Those four slots are vital. Wasting one on Self Care when there are Med Kits available doesn’t make sense.
---
That’s my opinion of course and I’m sure many will disagree. You’ll experiment with what you like and don’t like and do what suits you. 
---
They probably roll the shrine, check to make sure BBQ wasnt one of the randomly selected perks, THEN put it up. 
---
I'd rather have another killer who can stall the game because we already have 2 killers who negate chase mechanics both legion and nurse and they are the most hated killers in the game nurse because she is op in the right hands and legion because well they're the legion
---
I don't see the doctor so this list fails by my standards
---
Im waiting for luck to effect chests so I can actually use Up the Ante unironically
---
Or you could just drop them 
---
Today I learned!
---
?
---
New player here, what’s this?
---
This game is actually "Bing"

---
Exactly, I'm not arguing the opposite, that the survivor should give up every time and let the killer get them, I'm just saying that people arbitrarily pick their side and say they should win.
---
Killers want to kill the other team, that's not greedy that's the ENTIRE GAME the person playing the killer is playing. Yeah, you aren't 'supposed' to get a 4k every match, but it feels great when you do (especially depending on who you're against) and having that taken away by someone getting to teabag their way out a hole in the floor just because you can't physically do anything about it is rubbish.
---
Is the event live?
---
I can tell you play both sides and I respect you for this
---
Dafuq
---
I’m a rank one survivor and I suck in chases and at looping. So don’t feel bad. The only advice I can give is don’t drop pallets immediately. If you have enough space between you and the killer to do another loop before dropping it, do it. Secondly, I will say that a huge mistake new players make is that they’ll get hit right before dropping a pallet and they go ahead and drop it. You just wasted a valuable two second sprint burst to get away from the killer. Just run though those and try to get enough space to find another one, or at the very least, that one stays up to use later before you’re hooked. 
---
I can tell that you play both sides. This is usually the mindset of those because they understand the game better I respect you for that
---
Good wraiths and bad wraiths. Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
You’re the only one coming off as one lol. Anyways, you have to be careful with speed boost increases for killers. We know how much 5% difference makes, thats what seperates 110% killers from 115%. 
---
PWYF has a niche use with leatherfaces chainsaw. With the right add ons, you can actually use the chainsaw to mindgame the survivor since you have the speed boost while revving instead of moving slower. It actually makes him pretty strong.
---
Speed boost increases have to be limited like PWYF, else we get another busted perk like NOED.
---
You disagreed with him. Almost every OP on reddit gets offended when you disagree with their suggestion
---
I don't think Fred should pull people off gens no matter how much I like the guy but he should be able to grab off the hatch. but dream transition should remove progress from objectives. as in you don't progress gens/totems/gates/healing while in transition. it will remove the huge disadvantage where they just heal a downed person or cleanse hex or finish gen or get skill check right during the transition. plus Adrenaline should only wake you up and give speed, not heal. just like with Deep Wound when you only lose the status effect instead of full heal. if someone is in the Dream, the aura blocking perks and lockers should not work cause it's a different realm, this can't be applied, I find it outrageous that it does.
---
to Trapper he should be able to carry more than 1 trap all the time. I mean you saw muscles on that man! and locating the traps is the worst part on long maps. he should start with all the traps on him and after setting those up can only carry up to 3 with add-ons.  
---
only change I see actually fit for Billy is to rev his chainsaw at lower speed cause 100% is too much. maaayby give him not infinite chainsaw sprint and with that add ultra rare add-on that allows infinite sprint. 
---
buff the rev walk speed and add-ons for Bubba.
---
Nurse seems fine to me. I can't learn her but I respect a good Nurse in my survivor games. maybe only change her add-ons a bit and not allow more than 3 blinks. and if so, add to her base speed. there are way too many dead zones with latest update(fixing it also works, then no speed buff needed).
---
Clown needs bit more base speed while recharging bottles or aiming. he doesn't have enough map pressure, it won't hurt.
---
Legion should be removed(I'm just salty) or their Killer's Instinct to show the heartbeat of survivors in Deep Wound unless the ultra rare that shows whole map in terror used. this change will also help to get the Deranged Pursuit achievement cause right now it doesn't depend on skill or knowing the power, only thing you can rely on is for survivors to be full fledged potatoes and Frank's Mixtape+dirt or whatever that lessens the stun. this also will lessen the amount of mending every game but increase amount of hooking+will make people actually be dependent on killer's power and strategy instead of bluntly slowing down the game and then cheese tunnel. 
---
 
---
Wraith, Hag, Spirit, Huntress, Doctor, Pig don't really need any changes. 
---
if those would be applied, I'd see survivor buffs as very acceptable, maybe even needed. at least reverse the healing speed back to where it used to be but buff Sloppy Butcher. and make Vigil recover exhaustion while sprinting outside the chase. 
---
Look at the hatch from both sides: survivor is the last one left alive and they were able to get to the hatch before being hit... So...  From the killer's perspective now: they ONLY would get a 3k if the person escaped, so they'd have to live with the knowledge that they were not able to completely dominate and crush the entire team, but only 3/4 of the team.  Their balls or ovaries would then shrivel and turn to dust, and they would have to call every person they loved and say how they were unable to be perfect in everything anymore.
---
Who is Ochido?

It wasn't in the beta but it was in the ptb as something they were testing but decided against because people were complaining

Because a lot like this sub reddit it’s filled with people who take a game way to serious. Although sad it’s just the reality. From killer mains to survivors mains you have people who value a game more than their own lives so you have toxic people who are poor sports and people who down vote all the time. It’s sad really you should feel bad for them. 
---
But but but, closing the hatch was too killer sided! The hatch should never be a race to whoever finds it first, it should always be open for a survivor to use, all the killer has to do is let them go and stand offs like this wouldn't happen!
---
**/s**
---
[A spit take](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xXtZwLYO-TY)
---
They seriously went to my Steam profile to personally attack me and everything. It was really pathetic. Lol
---
I wonder if you can trick the killer by moving a little after waiting that long then jump in.
---
I'd give my right nut for a substantial Nurse nerf. 
---
One blink would be enough for most top tier nurses to do decent but the learning curve would go from difficult to fucking master mode
---
Or, “survivor unhooks you next to killer for points”
---
There's probably just 1 and maybe 2 people working on cosmetics if I look at the rate they come out
---
You are literally suggesting the most unfun and broken way to play legion and you wonder why you get downvoted?
---
Yeah, its funny how they never even try not realizing I'm afk.
---
*Goes to hatch to stand over it, leaves for 30 minutes, comes back and hits them and they instantly jump in.*
---
"GG EZ"
---
Yeah, so I brushed my teeth, walked the dog, ate a sandwich and you just stood here wasting half an hour of your life... Yeah, g fking g mate.
---
One blink is way too difficult. It's very difficult to play nurse so it's normal that you get rewarded for your effort learning her by a good killer 
---
Yeah they're super toxic for using a perk omg like wow they should be banned actually
---
Haha me too. Tea bagged got caught and felt like a idiot. Never again.
---
I really like this! It lightens the mood of this very scary and blood filled game. Please BHVR add this to the game!
---
AFAIK, they didn't say it would be an update on client side, but on server side, and that it would be rolled out gradually. I think we're somewhere in the middle of that process, because as a killer on PC I see 4 man joining lobbies simultaneously more and more often while I'm pretty sure they're not SWF.
---
But it would be nice to hear from devs for sure.
---
They are not toxic for using DS... They are toxic for t-bagging at the gate to fake getting downed and using DS to run out the gate as an added taunt for the killer. If you actually can't tell the difference, then I don't know what to say.
---
Its 2,000 points for the hatch iirc, which they need to remove imo so survivors stop being greedy for the extra points. Aren't they objective points anyway? You probably maxed them from gens and opening doors, just leave.
---
As a nea main, let me be clear. We point at the killer why he is chasing us as well. 
---
Enduring in the shrine??
---
 I sleep.
---
Shadowborn twice??
---
REAL SHIT?!
---
True but people become a custom to dodging a nurse so one blink with a survivor running into a blink would be a difficult to try and hitting the survivors but yes I hate the description for the add ons another thing that they need to fix is the nurses range for her blink I have to use range add ons to be an lethal and effective nurse other wise I struggle and only get around 2 or 1 kill
---
1. Freddy is one of the most iconic horror characters of all time. People want to play as him. I'm sure there are a number of people who only discovered DbD because of him being in the game.  
---
2. You do best with Freddy when you switch targets regularly, confusing the survivors. This is a different playstyle to most killers but it is fun to see survivors panic when you suddenly switch to chasing them. 
---
3. Add ons that reduce the transition time can really catch survivors out early in the match, sometimes leading to gen grabs which is always funny because the survivors would avoid it if they just respected Freddy. 
---
I can't ever check just one, I've already committed to looking in 1 and my options are either don't check the other and the survivor laughs at me, or I check the 2nd one and find a survivor or don't and assume no one was around to laugh at me.
---
That was gold! Laughed a lot!
---
Both of them are too fucking stubborn. The Myers shouldn't want a 4k this bad. The Claud shouldn't want to escape this bad
---
Finally, a perk I want.
---
Something about a rushed PC port, yeah.
---
It's our only hope. 
---
A hatch standoff. Claudette wants to escape through the hatch, but can't, because Myers will grab her and hook her if she tries to jump in. Myers doesn't want to leave because he wants to get 4 kills, and if he hits claudette, the cooldown of his attack would allow her to escape.
---
PWYF should only lose a token when a survivor is hooked and keep its current numbers. It's currently way too easy to lose the effects with a hard build up 
---
If they make Billy 110% im legit gonna quit this game 
---
Man, some games are so much fun. Most games are filled with people ruining the game to farm points. Survivors pulling you off the hook next to the killer, trappers stepping in there own traps to down you repeatedly, survivors working with the killer. I don’t mind if a player wants to tbag and be a silly bitch. They probably deserve the right. Holding the game hostage to farm points is some bullshit though.
---
Shards aren't really that big of a deal if you plan on getting every survivor and killer eventually anyway. I just buy the characters and spend my shards to get more BP.
---
If you want to get BPs faster, hardlock WGLF and BBQ for the first month or so. Until you get everything you really want at least.
---
I spend my shards to get extra blood points, I saved em up to buy one of the survivors, but I'd rather have spent it on the shrine.
---
This game is very cheap and I like supporting it every now and then.
---
I've been playing since october and still don't have all the teachable perks, I have most of them though...
---
I personally save my BPs for the perks that kost 2700, because they give you 250k BP if you've already unlocked them.
---
Daily dose of propaganda ads
---
*pebble bak*
---
Because the word you were looking for is "shard".  a "shart" is a shit + a fart.  
---
Essentially you collected enough shits and farts to become an Ace main.
---
As someone pointed out to me, most ppl here are surv mains lol. I feel your pain but you just need to shrug it off they’re salty you won 
---
Some tubers and twitcheys do it for a challenge, I’ve seen it many times. 
---
I know, I just needed to vent. and my friends are sleeping so Reddit is my only refuge right now. 
---
\o/ 
---
Have a hug 
---
Aggro is short for aggression - i.e, when I am being chased, usually a David runs out of nowhere and bodyblocks for me, and then the killer focuses their aggression on chasing David rather than me.
---
thank you&lt;3
---
Yea idk why you’re getting downvoted, that other guy is more stupider than you
---
Completely failed to mention the main reason I like to play as Freddy. I don't have to think about when to use his power because I always have to use it. I like killers like Freddy and Wraith because I don't have to be strategic with my power use. If I'm playing Huntress, Leatherface, Trapper etc I have to think about when and where I can use my power and this changes depending on what add ons I'm using. There's less thinking required for basic m1 killers like Wraith and Freddy. 
---
Survivor main playing killer the first few times
---
So they decided to fix it by completely fucking ruining the game for absolutely everyone involved. You can't play normally even if you wanted to.
---
I don't put RBTs on until there is 1 gen left or the doors are open. So if i catch you with one on it did its job.
---
Probably gonna get removed as a post, but gotta say it was some juicy justice porn. (Atleast if that steam picture means he got banned)
---
i hate it with a burning passion. it feels mega unfair a lot of the time too. I wish they'd just make it sorta like overcharge skill checks where it stays.
---
Bannable =/= toxic
---
Hes the only one who scares me as a killer. Hes always so confident and almost always runs at me... during a loop im just trying to keep him away from me. 
---
Thanks dude/duderina. I'm just building them up cause they look cool and fun, out or not of the meta. Will try some of those perks and tricks, I'm pretty hopeful with this killer. Thanks again for taking your time to answer.
---
I'm not sure what kind of impression people get when they go through my reddit history, but I'm a survivor main (just for the record). There are rules that are strict on Dead By Daylight's forum that go into great detail about what is allowed and not allowed; as long as you don't break these rules you shouldn't feel bad about your playstyle. People start throwing in their own rules as soon as they get comfortable playing the game to tailor it so they get more wins; "Camping N00b", "DS Baby Survivor", "Crutch Perks", or "Crutch Playstyles" literally don't exist because after every game you are a better player.   
---
TL;DR: Don't feel bad because you don't measure up to some artificial rules that don't dictate how you can actually play the game.
---
ah yes, let me not play for a full 2 months just so i can play against bad killers!!

Which is the exact reason why they are boring. Walk and press M1 simulator. 
---
What I hate the most is when I'm with another survivor and I don't know how to redeem myself. They probably tought I missed a skillcheck and if I proceed to do what I wanted to do, they will think I'm fleeing the are because I fucked up, so I decide to work on the generator, but now it looks like I really missed a skill check and the thing I wanted to do is still not done
---
Medkit time 
---
How *dare* people downvote my opinion?
---
Some hours after I reported him, I got a reply from a Dbd mod saying that they will investigate.
---
Now his steam profile says that he is banned.
---
F
---
It was talked about 100 of times already. You can at least hide from nurse legion not only ignores pallets and vaults like her but can see you after first stab and can cheese you by just not looking at you. If you think that it's fun to die as survivor by just standing still because killer stands in place looking back you probably play this game for wrong reasons.
---
You said you patrolled the basement because she annoyed you. Its fine ive camped annoying survivirs to. I dont get why killers are so scared of admitting they camped a guy one time. Embrace it, you dont do it every game i get that
---
Me: "but I didn't bring Decisive Strike"
---
Game: "and you're the obsession anyways"
---
Lvl 91, 13/14 the killers at P3, some (if not all of them) with 100 of every offering.
---
I'm sure he got what he deserved.
---
Me personally, I just kill them if I catch them. If a survivor finds the hatch before me, it is theirs. (I'm not having a hatch standoff.) But if I catch them, then game over.
---
I wouldn't worry too much about what people say. They have no way of knowing what was going through your mind through the match. Some people too say "gg ez" even if the game was close just to antagonize you.
---
I try to take the good in and shake off the bad. Luckily, I haven't had too much of the bad in my end game chats.
---
Best of luck in the fog to you!!
---
I just commented this idea not realizing you said it hours ago. But yes. This right here. I’d even add a prompt when survivor tried to escape at hatch. Entity deems you unworthy of escape. Could even make it a blood warden buff. Hatch is locked for however long due to hooked survivors. Only option is a key to bypass perk. 
---
"Ooohhh you have no clue where the hatch is do you? Awesome"
---
I honestly think people not knowing this simple trick is the reason why they think she's up there with Hillbilly and Nurse. Hell, a lot of people still don't know that you can break her traps with a flashlight.  
---
I know this a joke but what is its addons?
---
You will continue to see perks in your bloodweb till you have them all, after that it's just addons and consumables. As far as I know haha.
---
Sadly, some people do that on purpose. 
---
You brushed your teeth and THEN went to eat? Yeah, g fking g mate. 
---
But a waste of the add-ons smh
---
Because there’s nothing suspect about having exactly 100 of everything 
---
I wish Legion was Nerfed. He is in a bad state and I feel like he shouldn't be a viable pick untill he is fixed. But it's not like this ever happened to Nurse
---
The part where the killer sneezes and the survs say "bless you" didn't make you realise?
---
Killers don’t need many kills to pip and if they tunnel hard enough it’s pretty much gg if the surv can’t loop because 3 survivors and 4+ gens is hard 
---
i didn't even break any of their imaginary rules cause i was not camping but slightly patrolling and only this Claudette and the guy near gates when another is opened. it's their own fault for not being careful. 
---
and right now i played the shitty game with Japanese swf. they were skilled and not even slightly toxic. but i was so frustrated and upset that i got the tryhard build and the pink mori. didn't tunnel or camp though but still. and they had the decency to say gg in the end chat D: i felt so bad i apologized both in English and Japanese and they made me remember why i play nice. for people like them. doing safe unhooks, working as a team, not bming and just relying on skill and brains. i enjoy every game where Japanese swfs join with horrible ping(though my internet is really good so they don't lag or miss skillchecks. red ping doesn't always mean laggy game. if internet is stable you're just slightly limited in certain things like flashlight saves or clean 360s). i mostly don't get more than 2k with them but kills don't matter in these games cause i just truly enjoy them. and now i'm pissed at myself for being such a cunt D: that fukin Claudette and other guy with accusations got on my nerves and i made the game not so fun for good people D:

Is it a QoL hook? Or is there a place from where you simply can't get to hook in time if basement is in the shack?
---
I don't think so, there's not even a smol Billy. 
---
Yes, this is a joke. How do you not see that
---
Yeah, it did, but I felt like it could be an interesting mechanic in the game, but just in a different form
---
Ikr I guess he was trying to have every one of us in dream world as long as possible. He had us in the first minute.
---
There needs to be an overhaul of the survival point category for survivors. The only usual way to get them is the 5k escape, otherwise you need to self care a lot. It's near impossible to get 8k survival points I'm a legit game.
---
0k, most blood points in game. Welcome to dbd folks. 
---
Bing bong boy is cute. 
---
I realised that was the wild part, still.. damn devotion 4, thats double of what I have
---
Awww thanks, at least I don't have to go to school. 
---
should i get pebble time?
---
yo lucky, talking about school, i gotta go get ready for it now &gt;:/
---
I know this is a hard concept but stop caring what the other players think. If you think you didnt camp fine. That doesnt mean be a dick or anything but why do you care what some otjer randoms say. Some killers are si defensive about camping or being a dick to a trolling survivor. Half the time people say stuff for a reaction.
---
i cant make endchat private. i mean i can close it or leave immediately but you know..
---
and no, i'm calm now. just played like a cunt with a Japanese full swf. they played skillful and never bmed. worked real well as a team while not being even slightly toxic. and even though i played like a complete asshole with pink mori, they gave me gg D: i apologized in both english and japanese. hope they have no hard feelings. if i ever see them again i'll make sure to play 100% fair disregard getting people hooked or killed and throw in some cute fat bps.
---
Literally the majority of steam reviews are “game crashes on splash screen 80% of the time”
---
Yeah, that sucks. I dodged a test today. Well, good luck and don't get too bored. I'll be waiting for you in the fog. 
---
We need a shirtless dwight as well
---
 It isn't even live yet and no one has experienced it yet.  This entire sub is so negative towards everything the devs do but still plays the game on the daily lol

Anyone’s PS4 completely crashing after new patch? Twice now booting up the game has caused it to turn off entirely. 
---
I totaly agree with you. I'm 18 at the moment, but I've been playing violent games since I was 8. I'm one of the least likely people to commit murder you'll ever meet
---
There was plenty even before the nerf
---
[it wasn’t hacked then was it?](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/alacyr/when_you_stream_on_twitch_with_a_hacked_save_file/?st=JRIX1K5E&amp;sh=17053455) 
---
i know i didn't camp. there is an easy difference between patrolling and camping: patrolling is when you do objectives and leave the close to hook area; camping is when you just walk around the hook looking behind corners and all that; facecamping is when you, well, face camp. that's all. 
---
for the hundred time, i was pissed and upset that they accused me in something i didn't do. if they wouldn't call me a camper and tried to teach me how to play when they messed up themselves, i wouldn't care. it would be just another shitty match, like move on whatever. but they decided to be nasty people and lie and insult. 
---
It's not 5 and 12 years old is a decent age to start playing violent video games. As long as your kid isn't mentally unstable they should be fine. Whenever the blame gets put on video games it's more likely that the person was going to commit that act anyways, but just did it with a video game reference.
---
Someone on your original post was saying I know nothing about this game and having exactly 100 of each item but having only one bp offering is normal and this streamer wasn’t cheating. Feels good to prove that idiot wrong
---
Its not just me! Wtf is wrong.
---
But the daughter is 5... it says so in the title. 
---
You go to change your flair and then you should be able to see an edit button. 
---
You go to the place where you edit your flair and press edit, then type in whatever you want 
---
What? I already know it's going to be shit. Just look at the hallowed blight event. Why can't we have more events like the BBQ one? I loved that one, it didn't affect the gameplay at all, and the only difference was the increase of killers running agitation + iron grasp instead of ruin.
---
Weep not for whom the bell tolls, as it tolls for thee
---
IDK why this is so funny to me. LMFAO
---
&gt; BBQ &amp; Chilli
---
Devs: "No, that's not how the story goes"
---
What's even worse about this is that all the gens are done. Claudette could easily just have opened a gate. Smh
---
What’s wrong with rapping ruin?
---
What's a Qol?
---
Weird
---
I often do the Basement Chest Guardian Bubba. if you try to touch my chest, I will hook you. and won't let anyone else unhook unless they bring offerings (items). sometimes it's cute cause they understand but mostly they just call me a camper even though I only hit them if they touch my chest D: I mean technically I camped that chest but eh. 
---
Stihl does have safety switch. If you google "chainsaw" and go to wikipedia, the first picture you see is a Stihl chainsaw with dead man's switch and a chain brake (the gadget that looks like handguard is actually a brake which activates if the machine pulls the operator at the object).
---
or as Piggy I change my name to "I'm a survivor I swear" and just pretend to do gens with them. 
---
Me an non horny little boi: no
---
*top 10 questions science still can't answer*
---
thank you! :) that's very helpful.
---
I never said it wasn’t hacked, I said it’s possible they didn’t and people are jumping to conclusions without any definitive proof. 
---
Get it for the meme. It’s pretty shit.
---
with the frequency teammates waste good pallets, I want them to.
---
Thanks a lot! do her traps function in the same way as trappers or is it rather an 'area' it covers? 
---
Huh, I’ve never gotten them for closing it slowly... weird. Maybe there’s some sort of bug? I’ve escaped the killer’s notice while playing survivor just by quietly closing a chest I was searching as they walked by too...
---
You can very easily just power through the ruin, no need to gen tap.
---
It’s not really an argument when all of your points have been proven wrong or flawed. Your main point is that he’s only level 91 which means next to nothing seeing as the game was out for years before PL even existed.
---
You just used a quote that can very easily be used against you in this situation due to how heavily flawed every point you have is. 
---
this happend to me when i played freddy, someone was in the dream world crouching by a rock outside of my terror raidius and when i went there som dude just wrote hacker and reported me... Fucking dumbshits XD
---
***why is it so small***
---
ROFL thats my comment in there !!! #blessed
---
I know, but I am asking why do people say it is wrong and neither killers nor survs like it
---
Yes, when i get stunned in a chainsaw attack, he will trow a tantrum and if someone gets close... well you know what happens then
---
can anyone copy the changes into a post for people at work like me?
---
It's a free win for a survivor who doesn't deserve it anyway.  Since when is escaping without powering all the gens balanced anyway?
---
I mean i agree anyone wasting there time in a standoff is an idiot but a survivor has a much better chance to not be in one. See the killer camping hatch go do a gen. 
---
You don’t have any other choice. Doing a gen will 90% of the time get you killed
---
Yeah once you hit 50 then your bloodweb just refreshes once its full, even if you dont presige and just play level 50 with everything
---
I don't know dude, I like when games leave some stuff for the players to figure out.
---
that have happened to me like 4 times... i hate it
---
honestly but was in the heat of the moment, thought i would get a pallet or 2 then go down lol but the spirit respected the gameplay so she deserved it.
---
Actually, you did say that it was normal to have one bp offering as “they could have used them and not the other offerings”.
---
You did say he wasn’t cheating and that’s what out entire argument was about.
---
bUt StReAmErS pLaY a LoT sO tHeY hAvE a LoT oF oFfErInGs, Is ThAt BaNnAbLe NoW?!?!
---
People trying to claim the streamer got these offerings naturally...
---
Look at their account level; Devotion 0, level 91.
---
So why wouldn't the last survivor just let the killer find the hatch for them and just run into it when they close it?  Allow killers to kick the hatch shut if they reach it first.  You can remove the grab mechanic now.  First person there wins.  Survivor doesn't deserve to escape anyway if they've let the game get to this point without powering 5 gens.  It's supposed to be a last resort, not a viable fallback.
---
Unpopular opinion, but i am having more fun and engaging gameplay against Legion, then i ever had against Nurse. Legion is broken, annoying, unbalanced, but he can't eradicate whole team withou addons in 2 - 3 minutes. And no, playing against strong nurses is not fun for me. In fact it's frustrating and i don't get a feeling i lost a chase to a skilled killer, i get a feeling i was babymurdered. Legion doesn't have counterplays, but against him i can survive for a semi-long time. I would rather play against frank's mixtape, then against nurse.
---
You did though, throughout this entire comment chain you have been defending the shit out of an obvious cheater and the moment you got proven wrong, it’s now “I said it’s possible they didn’t hack”. Grow up
---
Omg. Yesterday when I was streaming the killer was on my ass all the damn time. You would think the other teammates would do some generators, but God forbid they come out of their lockers. 
---
It’s not fun for either side to stand still for 20 minutes because you are both too stubborn.
---
A cheater is a cheater, I don't care if he has 10 viewers or 10000.
---
I "went" for him because I played against him, if he is cheating, it isn't very clever to stream and put his twitch's link on his name.
---
O hai Genji
---
If you're not letting them unhook and you're not leaving the basement then you are indeed camping more than the chest. 
---
its faster. the gen repair didn't slow down over patches, it was always 100% for solo repair 90% for 2 people etc etc etc.
---
they just added the red bar indicator, so prove thyself is faster than last patch for multi-survivor repairs
---
just say fuck it and get the pebble
---
#mothevent 
---
no other way unfortunately
---
fresh gameplay XDDD go and play a different fucking game then, this event is going to be so cancer
---
Literally was in a hatch standoff. They didn’t see me, so I finished the final generator to get him to budge. Well enough, they ran to both exit gates while I stood on the hatch until they saw me.
---
Felt good.
---
That does not in any way mean that I said it was normal.... blatant lie but ok.
---
I said it was quite possible he didn’t hack, also does not in any way mean I said he didn’t, simply it was possible he didn’t. Yet another blatant lie. 
---
If that’s really why you started an, “argument,” with me, then you started one for no reason as none of what you’re assuming is true.
---
You don't need a degree to realize kids need filtered content. It's the reason there are age restrictionson games/music/movies etc. Don't be a smart-ass because he gave you a straight up answer 
---
one of these could replace "another disconnect"
---
is the shrine the same across platforms ?
---
it's rp, man
---
I can only read this in Twitch’s voice 
---
I’ve said it’s possible he didn’t hack multiple times, there’s a very big difference between the two. Go and look at the message you initially replied to you fucking moron. I’ve not once said that he did not hack, I’m simply saying it’s possible he didn’t as it’s a pretty hefty accusation and what his account has is entirely possible to have obtained since release.
---
Fuck you all mean dont play legion. I paid money to get him and because some entitled brats can't win against a perkless I have to stop playing him?
---
I once found a *RANK 2* survivor who didn't understand what 360ing was. They thought it was an invincibility exploit, and spun in front of me. Not around me, and they reported me when they died.
---
i didn't say i didn't camp though. i just said eh. 
---
19:00 UTC
---
to be fair it depends who the killer is. if its Myers or hillbilly or even clown you are risking leaving if the gen is far away. as a survivor has more to lose than a killer in a hatch standoff 
---
Killers are anal about it because the survivor always wins unless they basically commit suicide.
---
That top looks comfy as fuck. How did you get it for feng min? I don't see it in the store. 
---
Why wouldn’t you want to make survivor bingo be the same as real bingo though
---
its not that its wrong to do. its just completely ineffective.
---
that’s it.
---
Ah, whatever. Must've misunderstood. 
---
The names check out
---
Ah, yes, the classic "Meg discovers she doesn't like jumpscares" episode
---
Best way to derank tbh, fun for everyone 
---
If i was rank 14 killer and saw a legacy in my game, I'd probably DC lol.
---
I mean, yeah rank reset and all but still... Should be impossible for someone with legacy skins to drop that low unless they hardly play anymore.
---
Or maybe it was the hack thing that was going on lately? I'm on ps4 so I've never seen those ingame and they look intimidating as fuck.

* Fixed an issue that could cause survivors to be unable to trigger  interaction or cause the character to be teleported back to the basement  after spending some time inside the basement.
---
* Fixed an issue that could cause some Survivors to be standing at the campfire.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused Prove Thyself not to affect the perk owner.
---
* Fixed the incorrect values displayed in all tiers of the Self-Care description, in all supported languages.
---
* Fixed an issue that made it impossible to rush vault a specific window in Badham Preschool.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused the Game Over score event to not work properly for The Pig.

* Fixed a crash that could happen when a survivor would disconnect during a Mori.
---
* Fixed a crash related to status effects that could happen at any time during gameplay.
---
* Fixed an issue that caused certain customization items to have placeholder string in all non-English languages.
---
* Partially fixed an issue that caused the Survivor icons in the HUD  not to update upon a disconnect. Some disconnection scenarios may still  result in the icon not being properly updated and are being  investigated.

* Tentatively fixed an issue causing players to get stuck loading into  a game if a player would disconnect during the loading sequence. This  is a difficult to reproduce issue, and we'll be tracking the result of  the change on the Live environment after this update.
---
* Added more logging to help identify the issue that could cause  players to encounter the Bloodweb screen turning a solid color, and  being unable to progress.
---
I mean, any Killer played well is a force to be reckoned with. Then again, a good group of Survivors is gonna roll just about any Killer. 
---
Either way, the fact her strength is relying on bad Survivors is kinda lame. 
---
I’m the Meg main and I’m the one cleansing totems. 
---
Salty messages after games that the player has reported you in-game for? 
---
Tunneling can be a good thing to do but obviously with the situation you mentioned it was a bad play.
---
For anyone bullshitting you on letting your kid play this, if your child isn’t screaming at night with nightmares from the game, then they’re fine. 
---
I first played silent hill when I was little, most of the games/movies/music I was brought up with was horror/scary. It’s now one of my biggest passions and I thank my parents continuously for letting me indulge in things that “weren’t” for children/young teens. I get why some people would disagree, but it’s YOUR kid, not their. 
---
I think they need to remove the hook at coldwind and just make a drop-off point. it was stupid to add a hook in a spot no survivor has any chance to get to. 
---
Pębbłë tįmë bœįs
---
Why are people so afraid of learning/playing the nurse on console? 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TNLPGCCUfnY I was playing survivor and I don't think any of us saw him for the first minute or so and then the game froze for a while and then this happened a little while after it unfroze but I'm sad I missed playing with a fellow Sunny fan! Did you need to go back for your tools?
---
I wanna know that too, im new to the game and always had a bad game vs Freddy
---
I may be the bad guy here but that frustration you're feeling? You put that on yourself by allowing yourself as a killer to be constrained by rules made up by the survivors that are not actual rules of the game. 
---
Regardless of what they -think- you were doing. You know what you were doing and that's the truth and that's all that matters. 
---
Tunneling and camping are shitty things to do, sure, but there's no rules against them and they are not bannable and as a killer you owe the survivors nothing but death if you can make it happen. When you allow the survivors to make up silly rules you have to follow the only one who gets frustrated is you. Don't let that happen, play the way that makes you happy, say gg in the chat and leave. 
---
You're a valued member of the community and we love you &lt;3 people just be mad sometimes
---
Amen.
---
idk if you can even report that on console because they say this in the game rules 
---
Reminder: everything that happens out of the game should be reported to the appropriate platform. (ie: Twitch, Discord, Steam, Sony, Microsoft)
---
So the guy is lvl 91, has 100 times each offerings, has MM P3-50, Doctor at least lvl 35, Leatherface at least 35 and Hillbilly at least lvl 30 but it's normal 
---
Exactly. Which is why I'm confused. Sony has never banned me for any of my messages. They've deleted some when I got reported but that's it. DBD is essentially banning me for something I did outside of the game
---
Her design is my fav one!
---
27th of November for PTB I think and 11 of December for the official release so that's almost three months between the potential PTB release and the new killer will be released in March anyway
---
No I don't
---
I once faced a Wraith in The Game map. It's already the forth gen finished and no one being chased, injured. It happened that I brought broken key with addon that could track the killer. And I found him just staying still while invisible in a spot in the Bathroom where the totem usually is. I "poked" him a couple times thinking he was afk then he started ringing the bell and I got freaked out and ran away immediately XD
---
He didn't even chase me and we all got out. At the post-match screen he immediately left so we didn't get to ask him why he did that lol, I'm guessing he wanted to derank XD
---
Me and my friend had a similar Leatherface experience.
---
We played Haddonfield and I spawned in the house with the basement, heard the killers beat so ran off straight away, 5 gens pop, all totems get cleansed and we start saboing hooks feeling weird, and feeling like we would still lose the game. 
---
I remember that chests get you xp so I go down to the basement and see Bubba standing in the corner with insidious staring at the chest, then shakes his head. I get my friend to go down and show him, we're both pissing ourselves laughing and my friend goes to open the chest. He goes berserk and downs my friend with the chainsaw, face-camps him and then on post game chat once everyone but my friend escaped, he says "no touchy touchy my chest." and then went on to explain he was deranking. Fun guy.
---
I am sure they'r, i mean with the trailer of the chapter and stuff.
---
My entire point in the last post was that it was possible it wasn’t a hacked account, this dude took that as me saying that it is not a hacked account at all and has since been bullshitting repeatedly. 
---
rewind time
---
This is needs work. 
---
You’re lines are messy needs to be cleaner.
---
Jane body looks unnatural like the arm placement and the body turned like that just doesn’t look natural.
---
Just the whole thing needs work
---
happy cake day
---
Oh okay. Did you verse a virtualraven? He's exactly as you described. He's an asshat
---
This just made me think of juking killers via 360's.
---
The problem with pointing is that it could mean a lot of things. It could mean which direction the killer is, where the hex totem is, where you should go, or just pointing for no reason to mess around.
---
I don't know what your rank is, but you're definitely not playing against good survivors.
---
I'd say you won't *ever* see survivors that know to wake people up or to go get a skill check to wake themselves up if you're between 10-20. I've had full teams of rank 11-12 survivors that wouldn't snap me out of it standing right next to them and following them. Then the entire team just gets put to sleep and it's over.
---
Rancor
---
Oh for sure and i still think killers should just accept the 3k and move in. The survivor gets way more than the killer
---
Freddy is weak because he's the only killer in the game where the killer power actually hinders your ability to kill. He HAS to put you through the dream transition, and then he has no tools to help in a chase. You losing to Freddy is not so much because of Freddy himself, but probably just you being killed by whatever killer it happens to be I'd guess. 
---
For me os kinda hard to hide/run from something i dont see
---
ya honestly I do agree. most hatch standoffs anyway tend to be because the killer is staying at the hatch pretty much telling the survivor its location 
---
Wait what? Hitting IS an offensive action. Across various games I found that gen-pulling, hooking amd mori-ing dont count as offensive actions.
---
I can hit the great skillchecks quite a lot but not the DS skillcheck. Im sorry :'(
---
About GTA... uhm, when I talked about violent video games at 8 years old... that was it (without the knowledge of my parents of course)
---
Don't drop pallets early if he starts winding up that shock just keep running he'll eventually get sick of it and give up or hell go, after someone else or you can run calm spirit if you don't wanna get found at all 
---
It's because so many people feel entitled to win. Killers and survivors learn that they can often escape/kill all four on the lower ranks. They rank up, get paired with better players and can't accept a good game without total defeat of the other. Survivors take killings of their mates and themselves to personally and many killers seem to be hellbend on 4-man killings and are therefore willing to stand in front of a hatch for 20 minutes and just wait for the survivor to make a mistake. This is especially hard for them, because they dominate the game until the hatch opens, but from then on they are at a disadvantage. If you enjoy hatch standoffs, then it's likely that you don't have this mindset. You act faster with more risk of losing, but also with having fun playing the game.
---
Why thank you for advice, but I would gently decline your offer.
---
Where tf did u get this
---
Sounds like the kind of guy who would punish people who mess up gens.
---
My account looks very similar to his, I have multiple killers with many addons stacked to 100 and that’s simply because I’ve played since beta. 
---
On the chance this guy was a veteran in the game i felt people should find out the truth rather than making assumptions mostly based off of their level. 
---
Lol at you assuming I'm a survivor main. Wrong buddy
---
Sometimes you find the hatch by luck once your mate dies and you immediately jumps in while you see how the killer is coming 
---
Hahahhah the touchy touchy part got me. 
---
Bareback David 1st  
---
I MEAN BOTOMLESS
---
I mean no pants
---
Youll see the odd facecamper at all ranks but its not that common. Unless your doing something to annoy the killer. 
---
&gt;wheezed
---
Don't you mean, "sneezed"
---
Currently playing with? You mean players met? 
---
Yeah i realized it was tiny because too much text :/
---
I've never heard of a killer that felt the need to send hate mail. Is there something survivors do in particular that annoys you that much?
---
Bring flashlights and burn them with it
---
This has to be a joke, nobody is this stupid
---
This made me obese, you do realize how op this will make the survivor if this happens right?
---
plebe time
---
Im a rank 13/14 survivor that has 4 survivors maxed out and I know where Almost every pallet spawn on every map is the main reason I'm rank 14 is because I simply cannot rely on my teammates (yes it sounds arrogant) but it's true 
---
Disappointment?! That was a pretty cool play, wouldn't have been as cool looking if you hadn't gone for it, thanks for the share!
---
Let’s just Yeet the balance in this game
---
you can always escapay next time all the wiser anyways...
---
If you get doctor and BBQ you'll be a blood point machine you'll get like 50k a game same with Billy if you're good enough 
---
That picture is unsettling. He would be a funny character on the show though.
---
Yeah they'r not on the same body in the real world, but on the fog realm they are sharing the same body, i guess the entity found funny to jamm they all together.
---
I've had nothing deleted recently. I was just saying in the past I've had
---
Just ask them where in the TOS it says you're supposed to turn around backwards and let them have a free pass to unhook someone when they're too idiotic to wait for you to leave the area.
---
You're dumb
---
Who cares what you call it? If you chased them for 3 gens, it sounds like they did their job.
---
Yeah I was actually wondering when the event was starting thanks for the info
---
P1 ☺️
---
Is pebble worth it?
---
I don’t know why that was so hilarious to me lol
---
That totally fixes the mexican standoff...not
---
I member when this post was about kates PTB scream. I member.
---
There’s not much you can do in avoiding facecamping/tunneling killers even if they’re the Wraith. You’re best bet is to always stall for time in good chases and pray to the heavens that your teammates are competent enough to finish gens. 
---
Also, for unhooking, I’d suggest bringing in Kindred so that your teammates don’t gawk at you struggling on the hook for facecamping, or even have someone run Borrowed Time to help you out.
---
I heard it starts the 30th at 19pm UCT
---
Thanks!
---
Your sarcasm is high tier. I like it. 
---
Fair point.
---
how could we forget
---
Even worse are those fuckass instant skill checks that are already past by the time the indicator shows up. There should be a deadzone where the check zone can't be closer than halfway down the bottom half of the ring.
---
Also it might just be me, but for some reason the skill check gauges look like they run at 10 fps.
---
Sounds banable
---
Take a look at console hardware. Ofc they‘re jets 
---
The killer literally just facecamped the survivor he downed first. 
---
"Obviously going to camp, guy had a bad game." Wtf? So first there's no context and now there's enough for you to make conclusions that make no sense given the context. In fact, logical fallacies are typical to idiots. 
---
Can he see non sleeping survivors?
---
Because the lack of fine tuning on the controls and the fact that the game can drop as low as 10fps sometimes make it a torture.
---
He's not a veteran. Having exactly 100 of everything is pretty much concrete evidence that they hacked 
---
Freddy is strong vs survivors that...  Dont have self care.  Cant find gens.  Dont understand the map.  Cant find pallet/windows.  Dont help other sleeping survivors. And think they can hide while dreaming.
---
Basically hes really good vs new players.
---
In exchange he cant guard hooks, is very poor at guarding totems, gives survivors a 7 second headstart in all chases,can get body blocked in chases by survivors he cant injure, can be forced out chase by lucky skillchecks, and suffers extreme vision problems from the fog or when transitioned 'indoor'  
---
Oh, and all his addons pretty much at best make him suck less rather then making him good at anything
---
Who cares move on why do you even care?
---
You get rank 7, heck you even get rank 1, by merely existing. It‘s just playtime. Hag is not the most common killer, you can get to rank 1 without ever seeing a hag and if you do and lose to her, that‘s 1 pip. 
---
Thats why Im not sure wich one to buy between the two

I got banned today. The thing is none of my recent messages have been reported. The last time I got reported was a few months ago. There's only been one occurrence since console bans went live that I could've been banned for but none of my messages were reported to Sony. And again if DBD is banning me for those messages then they are banning me for something I did outside of game, that wasn't reported to Sony. It isn't right
---
Came here for a blind throw :(
---
You decided to personally attack Chazarat instead of being any sort of civil and just disagree with him, and go on with your day.
---
How would you feel if I told you "I’m sorry that your parents had to put up with you growing up. After all you’re seemingly that kid that was nothing but a snot bag and treated others like trash. Truly sorry."
---
In this case, you're an absolute cunt.
---
I just dont understand it but okay you do you. Facecamp a guy and expect a positive response
---
Trapper! Put their head in a bear trap!
---
You should never focus one person for the whole game. That's just bad play. If you can't catch them, pick someone else that is easier to catch. Tunneling is fine if you know you'll be able to remove them from the game in a reasonable amount of time.
---
None of my recent messages have been reported to Sony tho. Again you're wrong
---
Ah. Can't wait to open reddit and see some *DBD* content.
---
*What*
---
Legion is my favorite killer. Not my favorite to play, my favorite backstory and design. I especially like Susie.
---
I agree, if BHVR wants to ban people for harassment, they need to add an ingame chat for people to harass each other in.
---
They shouldn't be allowed to ban you from the game for doing things outside of the game. I'm also confused as to how this happened to you, did you try to make a thread on the official forums\support pages?
---
To me I was a little confused why they needed to justify a fix for this. I mean yeah the log the survivors sit on is long enough for 4 survivors to sit on, not to mention they did make the animations to be seen, but surely at least one person would be standing and walking around. Cause you know, a murderous killer is stalking them and they might be a little paranoid. Like it would make sense logically, right?
---
What
---
No I don't visit the forums at all. I did send them a tweet on Twitter but that's it. Would it be better to make a post on their forum?
---
If he did this legit than he would be a higher level than 91
---
PWYF is great on BUBBA, Billy, iredecent head Huntress, any stalking type myers who only use EW3, it can be a good perk for wraith and spirit since you can easilly cut chases with them. It's an ok passive perk on other killers aswell. 
---
doesn't/can't always happen, the game is based around you doing your role and them doing theirs, it's not designed to be nice, so it doesn't always work that way and often people aren't. It's ok, people are dicks sometimes.
---
I got no clue what the original pose was before but downvoting when someone brings up a very valid point is pretty fuckin stupid gotta be honest. 
---
Basement &amp; Chill ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
May he live in infamy
---
I'm not sure what's best, but I'd do both probably.
---
The forums is a great place for proper discussions, it's a little less toxic compared to this sub. I'm guessing it's because they can get banned by mods and mods here don't do shit.
---
maybe it was old messages then, I don't know, I don't know what you know, just play nice
---
Sounds like you got unlucky and were caught by bad killers. Killers face camp when they know they can't win another chase or deal with an unhook. Face camping is the definition of "I'll take what I can get".
---
As much as it breaks the immersion a little, it really is not a big deal and looks really funny. 
---
How would you recommend fixing him? Since the biggest issue seems to be his inability to chase down survivors, would something like, "sleeping survivors have a 5% movement speed penalty" be enough to make him viable outside of baby ranks? 
---
I have recently got rid of self care so I'm running  dead hard and balanced landing because balanced landing gives you a buff even when you have exhaustion  and I can choose which one too use and I run empathy  and adrenaline also for fun I run deliverance and pebble(diversion) and borrowed time and bond : I recommend making you're build 1 exhaustion perk adrenaline D strike and then a perk of your choice 
---
No add-ons, no offerings, only that killer's perks.
---
I think killers hate Claudette more.
---
If dead hard isn't working for you you're using it wrong you shouldn't be dead harding in the open u should be using it too give you a boost too a pallet or window you wouldn't have otherwise made the killer can't do anything about that 
---
I do the same, leaving the third survivor on the floor and going far away enough searching for the fourth, theres plenty of time for the third to be picked up and saved but if theyre not saved, the fourth deserves to die tbh for being selfish 
---
&gt;I agree, if BHVR wants to ban people for harassment, they need to add an ingame chat for people to harass each other in.
---
Uh...They don't want this in the game or outside the game that's why they would ban people because of it.
---
This is exactly why I do not give survivors the hatch.
---
*Quentin pain solidarity*
---
Yeah, killers hate Dwight's almost as much as they hate quentin
---
Ah, thanks I see now
---
I'll make a post there. Thanks
---
Seriously, it's disgusting. If a new player plays against someone who does this, it ruins their experience and may end up not playing more.
---
And yet this exploit has been available for months. Maybe over a year by this point.
---
You have no idea how glad I am to see Evil Dwight again :)
---
He is my favorite killer too, belive it or not i enjoy playing him.
---
The devs banned  him so he did hack. And with the low amount of bp offerings I doubt it is legit
---
Kind of figured.
---
Went and played my boy Doc to feel better. Ended up getting a 4K in a really tough match to finish the night nicely! Every hook was 99% sabotaged, lots of Self Heals, flashlights, etc. Ended up having to let the last person bleed to death on the floor because they had the perk to block sight to hooks and had sabotaged most nearby hooks already.
---
Only barely.
---
Nea looks much more attractive here than in game. Regardless of that, the characterization is fantastic.  
---
Meg is simply perfection.
---
Well that's Zubat. We're talking normal players.
---
This is why i love running tombstone piece.
---
When a killer dcs over me, I consider it more than a win
---
They could make it work like with *Overcharge* and have the skill check follow you until you hit or miss it.
---
Or just make *Overcharge* work similarly and explode right away if the survivor leaves the gen before the skill check finishes.
---
The technology's obviously already there, and the inconsistency between the two otherwise very similar effects is a bit silly.
---
Myers would like to know your location
---
Fuck you too.Do not complain then about what you get after playing the most toxic killer in the game.Toxic killer=toxic survivors.Im not playing against someone who just kills you by holding W.
---
It's like 7pm GMT
---
Okay thank you

I like to imagine the hard hat as not a construction hat but just a steel bowler

Yeah, teach him how to cheat

He said, verbatim, "Stop pulling random shit out of your ass and accept the fact that this guy is cheating. You’re the one who doesn’t know dick about how progression works in this game"
---
You said "I’m sorry that your parents had to put up with you growing up. After all you’re seemingly that kid that was nothing but a snot bag and treated others like trash. Truly sorry."
---
He's calling you a piece of shit pertaining to the subject at hand, you're attacking him outside of the subject, basically calling him a big bully.
---
Accept the fact that you were an asshole, and just make up to each other. I'm not trying to defend him either, honestly, but he at least didn't drag your personal life into it.
---
the screenshots are funny, I wish it entwined a little better with the lore though, I saw a Kate being hunted by a pack of evil Claudettes, that was awesome and I kind of wish there was an in-game purpose for that like a killer who could turn survivors. I actually just played with a "salt of the earth" meme Dwight and he sure meemed "real hard" until it was time to get hooked and he DCed. I suppose if crappy gameplayers come with a story though that's better than nothing...
---
Same thing happend to me. Guy that got pulled of didn get the achievement.
---
Why would the survivers help him?
---
I'm aware of the Infinity War meme. I just wanted to open discussion about the garbage map that is Haddonfield.
---
idk if we know the exact time but it will prob be 1pm central 
---
Cold Dirt + Joey's Mix Tape for add ons. Hit them once in Frenzy, run to catch up with them (bodyblock them from vaults if they're near them), cancel out of frenzy and hit them again. They'll be down in two hits like every other killer. If you want to use Frank's Mix Tape, you can put any other add-on with that but Cold Dirt is the best one by far. Frank's just lets you down people in 3 Frenzy hits instead of 4.
---
Legion is fast as fuck boy so abuse the shit out of Frenzy as much as you can to get around the map. Thump every single gen you see with progress on it.
---
If you don't know what perks to run, you should probably do some research on killer perks in general.
---
Discordance is his best perk, you can use it in the place of Hex: Ruin (but if you find it getting countered a lot by people solo genning, put on Ruin). Teachables: BBQ &amp; Chili (this is basically just required for every killer), Thanataphobia/A Nurse's Calling (slow Deep Wound mend action or aura reveal on mend, pick one), Discordance/Hex: Ruin (Ruin will probably just get destroyed), Distressing is a good substitute for more aura reveal range in Frenzy, Sloppy Butcher/Bloodhound help a lot with tracking and SB increases mend time.
---
Some other perks to think about as tech picks are Monitor &amp; Abuse, Bamboozle, Hex: The Third Seal, and Stridor.
---
To be honest the key to being good at Legion is just understanding that you should get a down on every chase you commit to. Legion should never lose a chase unless you let it happen on purpose.
---
Why do killers hit hooked survivors?
---
hire competent coders.
---
not sure if that is a problem, buut if you are having trouble doing skill checks, try running Technician, Feng's perk. It will help a lot while, if thats the case.
---
This post game chat ain't even that bad. Don't let it bother you. People bring the salt win or lose. Can't win either way. Just GG and gtfo of there.
---
I don't like the idea of doing that, it doesn't fit me, it's actually something I like doing: playing by the survivors rules. I hate hitting a guy that just got unhooked, camping is just boring and I still hate NOED from my short time playing survivor. I don't do it for the survivors, I do it for myself. Also, I get a lot of happyness when a survivor tells me they had a good time. It equally pains me when they have a bad game. But it angers me when they have a good game and proceed to belittle and insult you. Seeing one of the survivors say "baby killer" angers me so much that the next few games, I abandon the morals I just astablished and tunnel and camp, mainly focussing on P3 claudettes and the decisive strike guy.
---
I play multiplayer games because I care a lot for social interaction. Just ignoring the chat is not something I like to do
---
Is there any chance you still know when this happened? If it was like 2 month ago there is a chance, that the Bubba was me.
---
Well sorry it all made you feel badly. Please have a happy lunar new year!
---
I like to play farming legion or doctor (just using powers and trying not to down anyone) because I feel its the only way for both teams to have some fun and earn a decent number of bloodpoints, but still im finding most people just runaway scared even when I havent commited to one chase :) At the end this is only fun if the survivors dont want to be inmersed as hell really
---
I don't get it, why did you make a bingo card where all the spaces are free?
---
Different perspective I guess. You aren't wrong but I feel like he screwed his team more than help. 
---
That's steam though, I really don't know much about how the laws around that platform is.
---
You may be right about it for PC.
---
But Sony is very strict when it comes to this type of thing, because they could also be held responsible because they let BHVRs game on their platform.
---
I'm pretty sure Sony and Microsoft's platforms have way more restrictions then Steam has.
---
I don't disagree with you, unless you believe that you should get banned for outside harassment. I mean, I could easily make a fake chat and type in whatever I wanted there and take a screenshot and send to BHVR. Thing is, they do not have access to messages sent on Sony's platform, so they have no way of proving the harassment.
---
I do agree that this game has a toxic problem, and it needs to be fixed. I simply doubt this is the lawful way to go about it. Like I said, we don't know for sure if OP is withholding information about his ban. We simply can't know for sure.
---
i had a game where i was the only to spawn in, and when the killer found me i willingly let myself die, Then i got cypress moried. At least i helped the killer with his daily.
---
so i have asked the killer, apparently, they have fps uncapped in save files which previously would cause the basement bug before the today's small fix patch. it apparently broke this part now. so yeah. 
---
i couldn't attempt after being hooked at start, i hanged for a bit to see what happens. Clown(killer) couldn't do any space action cause he was stuck with me on his shoulder. 
---
Best thing to do when that happens is to stand up, look the killer in the eyes and wave them over as if you're saying "Yeah I did that. What are you gonna do about it?"
---
Then loop them like your life depends on it.
---
Own the mistake like you meant to do it and then assert your dominance and then get downed 5 seconds later cos you realise you're bad at the game like me. :)
---
&lt;3 thank you, you too
---
Doesn't the controller have an mic build into?
---
wow, don't diss my main like that
---
after the killer drops the survivor a certain amount of times (I think four or five) it automatically lets the survivor out of the killer's grasp.
---
Once you are dropped four times you automatically natural for wiggling.
---
That was weird.
---
If you examine the material provided by the creators of DbD, namely surrounding survivors being converted into killers, I think you will find that my descriptions are faithful to the lore of The Entity to a T. Several links and references are provided in both guides to these materials.
---
Not to mention Devour...
---
Actually at high ranks it's simply a mindgame. Pretty much no huntress assumes that you would run straight, so they always aim slightly left or right, mostly right because that's where most people dodge to (in my experience at least). Running straight can be a perfectly fine thing to do. Don't be predictable.
---
Oh. I wonder why he didn’t get the achievement. All of us did.
---
well i had many friends with hacked save files and from first glance i could tell it was hacked 
---
Only The Entity knows what the future will hold.
---
Today I was trying to adept leatherface, whole team got dc and I got the achivement.
---
Just keep poppin, you will get there.
---
Was this on console? But yeah it doesn’t give you any notice of Blood Warden (Op)
---
Offering and addons works. I did it with offering and addons.
---
Lol no and if I did what does that have to do with anything there's no voice chat on dbd
---
Oh really? I didn't think that was the case.
---
"I told you to...FUCK **OFF**"
---
Lol omg I'm getting kinda spooked. They're really coming for us ps4 users
---
Understandable 
---
Those aren't Steam's rules, that's Behavior's Community Manager's post and I'm sure Behavior's team is (not) happy to look at what people send them but if they're able to gather enough corroborating evidence of bad behavior (meaning taking a look at all the evidence presented to them and perhaps even verifying with additional platforms or even looking into people's accounts, like they seem to have done with a streamer using what appears to be an item hack) they will ban people. It's not complicated.
---
The pickup animation was changed, but the length stayed the same in total. It’s adjusted for killer height. For example the actual grabbing part of clown’s is quite fast because he’s so tall. Legion picking them up feels longer because it takes so little time to reach his shoulder. It does kinda feel longer because you used to grab them so fast, but the amount of time you are unable to move is the same. 
---
Both
---
praise

[Praise!](https://emi-nya.tumblr.com/post/170803744183/as-an-appetizer-for-valentines-day-dwight-x)
---
I dunno what you’re on about, I never made a valid point. The downvotes and replies I got say so
---
“A killer might not even be getting a kill or pipping.”
---
Lol what? The hatch appears when the number of gens done is one more than survivors alive... So the killer would have had to kill people for it to spawn and open unless all gens are powered and they had a key.
---
Tinkerer payoff?
---
What's wrong with Pig? You mean because she's an M1 killer with no gimmick?
---
Both same time ? I use bloodhound , ruin , thanatophobia and bbq as my build 
---
1: pallets have already been nerfed and it’s only going to get harder to balance them on small maps to begin with without making bigger maps 
---
2: totems are being talked about constantly from community/developers/CM’s and last I heard totems were going to be a ongoing process of being worked on ( which means you need to give it more time)
---
3: bugs, constantly there, even when you think  the nightmare is over ( PS4 legion patch anyone? *shivers in Dwight’s locker*)  report them as you see them and it helps if you report them on the official forums specifically for bugs or technical issues 
---
Devs don't know how to balance, so they don't mess with it much, I would assume. Things are fairly balanced as they are right now which is really fucking hard to do in a game like this. 
---
man I regret not getting it some time ago
---
maybe you get turned on by her
---
When they reworked Tinkerer a while back they said that they would be able to buff wind-ups for Huntress, Billy and LF 
---
If you rescue someone off the hook in the killers heartbeat it activates and makes the survivor you saved enter the deep wound status if they get hit again meaning they'll get a timer until they fall down. 
---
That’s what toxic survivor are. They just think their so good when their not.
---
They don’t always think so far ahead
---
I member when it was about Laurie's scream on live.
---
I’d say around 5 or 6 shocks without Discipline add-ons to get a survivor to full madness
---
Survivors can snap out of it from Tier 3 to get back down to Tier 2, but I believe it’s not possible to  get back down from Tier 2 to Tier 1.
---
Getting downvoted for being even a little reasonable lmao 
---
I don't recall that they did?
---
Wind up addons needed nerfing, even the devs said, and instasaw was broken on Billy before.
---
Jokes on you, I wear the bright luminous jacket!
---
There will come a day when you will snap and stop caring about the survivors having fun. Look at it this way: they don't care one bit about how much fun you had, you are there to provide them with points. So that's how I look at them. they are NPCs that are there for me to farm. You can only try to be reasonable for so long.
---
People should just learn to read the killers perks after the game, before they accuse you of hacking 
---
Replace bloodhound 
---
Lol wut
---
But it helps tracking them easily why is it a trash perk ? And will sloppy make them heal even slower with thanatophobia 
---
I understand that. It’s stupid 
---
Slow your roll, man, a fake message as a one-off lacks corroborating evidence ... like I said above you. 
---
I'm not the one you'll have to plead your case too if you ever get banned, I'm just trying to explain how the system works to two people who clearly don't want to hear it.
---
Or nurse with insidious and noed behind the exit gates.
---
smaller player model, maybe she turns you on so you don't wanna see her die, you know. shit like that.
---
Legion with thano and sloppy is cancer. As a survivor I’d love someone to be taking bloodhound. But if you want to win, take sloppy
---
People just don’t understand what a killer can do, if they don’t research it. I have watched many videos where people are playing killer and survivor, and it made me understand the game so much better 
---
maybe it's a whole "maybe she turns you on so you dont wanna see her die" sorta thing.
---
Lol, people will report you for the smallest things 
---
Sounds psychosomatic
---
I'm never going to get banned unless someone sends in a fake message of me talking shit to them in sony messages.
---
I've put my profile to private (I learned my lesson the first time), and never send anything other then GG and general praise after a match.
---
But how do you think, that OP got banned for harassment, when there is no way to communicate ingame on consoles?
---
Are you simple? The “hatch standoff” you’re describing PROBABLY NEVER OCCURS the other one that people describe is when the hatch is open, AFTER the killer has killed and subsequently pipped, happens all the time. 
---
Because he didn't successfully escape. The rest of you got it because you did escape when all of you went in together.
---
Then turn up the volume on your headphones and listen to where they run off to (footsteps) and cry if they don't have Iron Will.
---
Bloodhound is pretty much training wheels perk for Legion as its a waste of a perk slot once you are great at using sounds in this game for tracking/hunting.
---
Imo you should only be using frenzy when in line of sight of survivor, so you shouldn’t really be losing them in a chase. When you hit them it lights up where other survivors are so you leave the person youre chasing and go get someone else. Because of the fact that you shouldnt REALLY be chasing people already injured (unless injured people are too far for you to run) then you shouldn’t be running bloodhound.
---
Not even going to waste the time here, Christ.
---
Things that increase bloodpoint gain - do they apply after the match to increase the currency only, or do they actually make getting badges easier?
---
Dogg, I explained that to him and it should be pretty obvious by what I've already told you multiple times. Best of luck with increasing your reading comprehension.
---
Because he could get hurt if they didn't.
---
I'm not being a smart-ass because he gave me a straight up answer. I'm being a smart-ass because he implied that my daughter is going to murder people based on one picture on the internet. Based on this one picture and caption he made wild assumptions about the kind of person I am and the kind of person my daughter will grow up to be. Flippantly referencing an attempted murder to be, I guess funny? He doesn't know me, he doesn't know my daughter and doesn't have some sort of expertise in the field, but he feels comfortable enough with his knowledge to call me a bad parent and a child-abuser? So, that's two claims, one implied as one direct, based on one picture. I'm being a smart-ass because he doesn't know what the fuck he's talking about. He's just another sarcastic asshole on the internet having an opinion about something he doesn't know shit about. That's not exactly a unique characteristic. 
---
Tell me, how do you think OP got banned?
---
You don't have anything to reply with do you?
---
Did you just call Warden op
---
You did nothing wrong, there are just jerks that play this game. Stupidity and pride cant be reasoned with.  When you have people like that, just gg snd move on.
---
 I Play killer and survivor 50/50, so I try to play fair until I can determine how bad the gen rush is. Even then, if the survivors arent toxic, then I won't be either. Quite simple really, it is the golden rule...I treat/play others the same way they treat/play me. When they get a dose of their own medicine,  they typically bitch and moan. 
---
On a side not, I hate legion as well. One of the 1st killers in this game that I truly despise playing as and playing against. Before legion, I really only hated playing agsinst Spirit because she is the meta tunnel killer. Legion is worse because there is no counter play and mending every 10 seconds is not my idea of fun.
---
I play very late game, so in my case yes
---
Tha-thats not how that works
---
Don't harass people using third-party messaging and you should be fine.
---
lololol k
---
I'm so confused, what happened?
---
What is your definition of tunneling? If you mean chasing someone over and over again, you bet your ass it is. The sooner you get killers, the easier the rest of the game is.
---
Killers have to know when to break off a chase, but sometimes its just better if that one survivor dies, especially if he was just unhooked.
---
I was hag and had a jake that offered me 4 medkits at the basement. I accepted the offering and gave him hatch 
---
Odd flex but ok
---
When you can’t find the last survivor in tier 2 and then you see an illusion looking into the corner of the map 
---
weading so hard do it fow me
---
Wow, didn't know anything like that existed!
---
pebble time 
---
&gt; meaning taking a look at all the evidence presented to them and perhaps even verifying with additional platforms or even looking into people's accounts, like they seem to have done with a streamer using what appears to be an item hack
---
Problem with your statement is that BHVR has NO ACCESS TO THIS FUCKING INFORMATION.
---
While I don't have a link to the exact quote I do remember them talking about it when they dicussed the changes in the 2.1.0 Mid chapter balance after the Clown 
---
While I know it was pretty dumb on 3 Killers now we have a useless perk that's good on nobody.
---
Welcome to the dark side, brother/sister. There is no point in trying to please them, there are survivors that are always pissed when they lose. Play how you want, type GG and then leave.
---
Or be like me, and antagonize them when they complain in the end-game chat, and get all those sweet, sweet, comments on your profile to wear as badges of honor.
---
Don't tell me how to live my life.
---
at least my ears dont get el fucked.
---
which is sad tbh.
---
Jeff In a wet t-shirt and underwear instead of swimwear, kind of like a swimming in a creek in a spur of the moment kind of thing, they’d be black of course
---
You missed " You get downed in the first minute and facecamped"
---
Well, at least we know they can actually ban people 
---
It's ridiculously dumb in the sense of the game. Standing still next to the killer should lead to you dying, not being safe until you decide to jump into the hatch or until the killer gets bored. The game is supposed to be about the chase.
---
Oh ok, the answer is magic then. They do it by magic then because Sony hates working with devs that bring money to their platform and a simple email of "is this real" would completely violate HIPAA. /s
---
You can copy and paste, but the game doesn't share its clipboard with windows. If you wanted to paste something at the end of a killer game, you'd have to host a swf lobby by yourself (or join a lobby before leaving), type the message into the chatbox, copy it to your clipboard, and then you could paste it after your killer game. 
---
But proc’ing Overcharge, running away, and hitting the skillcheck while running makes you feel like Ultra Instinct 
---
Do the opposite of what I say, BUTTBUTT!
---
Maybe they eavesdropped you and thought hey that's not very polite you said in your living room.
---
Emblem progress is not measured in bloodpoints, but in time on gens/in chases, number of hooks/unhooks etc.
---
So they don't make ranking easier.
---
Also as a sidenode, there are two kinds of increase in bloodpoints. Some effects give you more in a match (and can therefore not exceed the cap of 8000 per category) like Distressing and Prove thyself and some give you bonus bloodpoints at the end of the match (and are not effected by the cap) like We're gonna live forever and Barbecue and Chili.
---
this is the best call out post of the century
---
To be completely fair, player levels didn't exist until 2.0.0, where everyone was set to level 1 no matter their previous playtime. 
---
&gt; simple email of "is this real" would completely violate HIPAA. /s
---
You obviously have no clue how privacy laws work. GDPR, ever heard of that? It's a little something us Europeans have that protects our information from being spread without our consent.
---
Bloodhound is only really good if you are frenzy hitting and then following survivor whilst looking down (to get out of chase mode). This allows you to keep track of them via blood splats and they cant do anything about it.
---
If not using that technique, then go with sloppy+ thano.
---
There are YouTube vids about it. Look one up. 
---
I often do things like hill Huntress or shack defender trapper it’s the fun play styles I love 
---
When your friend tries to trap you in the hotbox
---
Wow another comment doing nothing but hating

THANK YOU! I know my daughter and she knows the difference between real and make believe. Besides, she usually spends the whole match running around NOT hitting people because she's not that good. She usually can only hit someone when the survivors realize she's not a threat and start running around her in circles. If I was expecting any blowback, I would have thought it was going to be about having matches that weren't competitive. I wasn't expecting to be called a bad parent and child abuser, but that's the internet for you lol
---
Steel Curtain is the most useless perk I have ever seen. It works only one time per player, you get the blindness effect only for 12 seconds and I usually don't unhook someone in the moment he gets hooked so I just have to wait, and there are blindness perks more useful like The Third Seal and Knock Out.
---
Yeah but it still doesn’t add up when you look at it. He has every single perk on at least 2 killers and has hundreds of each offering (except the game and mount ormond offerings) and that alone would require so much grinding and through that grinding they would of reached above devotion 1 (maybe even reached devotion 2)

# WGLF STACKS
---
Oh! And by timer for the hatch--I meant the once the Killer closed it the timer would start before the entity reopened it. 
---
This would benefit the killer if he saw the survivor near the hatch--he could slam it closed at start chasing. Once the timer is up though, the survivor could try and go back. 
---
Best thing I found is to set line spacing to something like 130%, because 1.5 is too obvious.
---
Yeah, just make your profile private and the only way they can message you is via friend requests.
---
Then just report the friend requests if they are reportable, as in the message they attach has violations.
---
Are PS4 players just really that easy to bait into being toxic?
---
I think it's funny. If the mods dont like this one, this would be the last one. And to reply to your username, i like memes. 
---
are you saying claudette has health problems?
---
BHVR needs to fix their character, but it shouldn’t be outside the control of the consumer on whether they do or don’t use their product. They are, after all, the ones who spent money on it.
---
i spent money on the game too, can’t force me to play a completely unenjoyable match.
---
I play better with Jake so it must just be a mental thing
---
I don't expect you to be reading the GDPR but you could at least have read my comments?
---
I never say anything in chat anymore, because if you use the word fuck in a message you can end up getting banned from Sonys entire platform. Meaning every single game you've bought for ps3,ps4 and vita is in jeopardy. But only sony has this power, BHVR has no power here, other then what Sony has given them which is why we are seeing anything being done at all in regards to hackers and cheaters.
---
Hacking and cheating is not protected in the same way a private conversation is.
---
**"Real People, Real Fear."**
---
No, they told us that it was glitched prior to this patch. It wasn't applying at all before 2.5. Now it does
---
Check it in the [patch notes.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/343893170049908738/540147728756375552/unknown.png)
---
Well, I did it with randoms and 1 swf
---
I've had a pig do the exact same to me except they didn't follow me to the boxes after blocking the hatch. got the trap off (with about a second to spare) and made it out the gate
---
Me too, do they have to have proof to back up the report?  Like I have survivors trying to farm with me sometimes, I don't like to as it spoils my game as killer.  What if they report because they're pissed off that I hit them when they're stood in front of me pointing.  Basically might report because I don't comply...  
---
Its not possible to go down from tier 2
---
should be in 5 hours and 25 minutes from now
---
When I want to lose a couple of ranks I play wraith and stand somewhere in the corner of the map.  
---
After the gens are done I move over to my NOED totem.  
---
If the survivors opened the exit gate but decide to stay for some reason (they do 80% of the time) I find one/they come to break my totem and down them.  
---
Then bloodwarden kicks in. There is no feeling more satisfying than walking to a survivor that is teabagging in the exit gates, who is not realising bloodwarden in active.   
---
Then I kill as much as I can.  
---
Accept my mercy while you can and  
---
Leave.
---
Lucky, but i want a challenge, i hope this happens again, i have an idea of what i should do next time
---
No, the player level does matter when it comes to what items people have
---
22 seconds. Since the cleanse action takes 14 seconds, the hex:ruin was 8 seconds away from the survivor. 
---
Both are dogshit
---
Yeah i can almost every perk 
---
oh jeez dude, dont agrue with me when the previous argument is already over
---
1 P.M. central time
---
Because the game is broken. It’s no better for survivor. Especially SWF. 
---
Just recently got this game - trying to play around both sides and all different characters to understand what perks I'm up against. Problem is, I can never get anyone to join my game as a killer. One time I got it after waiting about 30minutes on a Saturday, but every other time I give up after 5 minutes of no hits.
---
Does the game prioritize killers who are higher ranked (and therefore a closer match to the majority pool of players)?
---
I agree. If community asks a question where there's two answers (yes/no for example to question "do you punish DC players?") the corporate answer is always the one which puts both the product and company in more positive light, even when there exists evidence which would prove otherwise. Because they have nothing but to gain from that. 
---
In relation to that, the directors and their bosses need to think which is more profitable; ban couple DC players with the risk of banning couple players who don't DC and lose sales or just let the DC players stay in hopes of them spending couple bucks in pixel store. This kind of corporate thinking explains perfectly why they were so quick to move on exploiting players who can dupe items or earn progression faster because there is a risk of exploit blowout where all users start exploiting, effectively killing the life of the game and any profit that could be made from that.
---
while its obvious he's hacking, he CAN still get those offerings since he could have played before 2.0 update
---
My Weekly [Reminder](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aitecm/shrine_of_secrets_for_wednesday_23rd_january_2019/eev0ruu/) is still valid to anyone still expecting a specific Food Based Perk. 
---
If that's your only statement then you're just flat out wrong. Items were in the game before player level was introduced. 
---
Except if the killer has realyl grinded that much then dont you think they would've grinded to at least devotion 2 in that time period? I stopped playing since 2017 and only came back to the game about a month ago and I already have 1 devotion and level 34. 8-9 months is plenty of time to get way more than only 91 fuckin levels.
---
pretty easy to get, just wait till rank reset get a 4man and ez, ive done it a bunch of times with my friends do they get the throphy too
---
Pretty sure i'd have been banned along time ago if it was lol.
---
Higher blood toxicity than  ABV percentage in vodka
---
how do i wrot coed
---
Isn't there a twitch streamer called the entity left hand that does stuff like this
---
Fun is not something one considers when determining the best power to scare a survivor, but this one, does put a smile on my face.
---
why play by made up rules that only benefit one side?
---
It's not about being boosted. The ranking system in dead by daylight says nothing about how good you are, but rather about how much you play. Every dumbass can climb to R1 because it's so much easier to pip than to depip. I've demolished R1 swf groups with 5 gens left, and on the other hand, I got deleted by 4 randoms on R11.
---
Rank doesn't mean shit in this game. R1 feels just like R10, at least as killer.
---
In bird culture this is considered a dick move
---
I've only had the game since the end of October and I'm almost devotion 2 with under 400 hours in game. 
---
That's evil, I love it
---
Idk. it just ruins survivors automatic reactoins/dessision making at times. and it is just so nice on LF. 
---
Typical depip Wraith ;) Wraith is the best for depipping cause they don't waste time running around you and teabagging :D
---
That's what I did and it immediately crashes my game. 
---
And that’s 100% your choice and I don’t blame you for that
---
now this, is epic
---
I am compelled to buy it after watching the first match from [this](https://youtu.be/Wy27dYRfPEw) video. But sitting at a 3k shards, maybe I should just keep stockpiling?
---
Good meme tho lol i died 
---
That's why Restraint is a wonderful addon sometimes. 
---
What is considered a "regressing generator" for the perk surveillance? How does this perk work in general? 
---
Except the mechanics being broken by the Nurse are pretty much every mechanic that the survivors have to run.  Nurse ends chases that would take other killers 5x longer, and her power isn’t exclusive to chases since she can use it to patrol.  A killer like Leatherface is nowhere near comparable.  
---
And it just shows how little the community’s opinion on the balance of the game should be valued if so many think that something should be allowed to be overpowered with little counterplay if it takes a little practice to be good with them.  
---
If it doesn't work you can still refund it past 2 hours. If in doubt contact TWI directly and ask for assistance to get the game working again.
---
100-200 comment is mine lol
---
SWF - Survive with Friends, the most annoying thing to go against as a killer(if it's 3-4 swf it's a nightmare)  
---
P3 Claudette is Claudette in her bloody prestige clothes. They are super dark and well, she's black so she blends in every environment and it's super hard to see her even if you're chasing after her ;)
---
Then the huntress just throws the hatchet at you anyway because they notice you're running in a straigt line and not actively trying to get to cover like this guy in the clip.
---
It might just be kind of a comfort thing. I main Meg too and it always feels weird when I change my character, though I haven’t noticed if I play better as her than others
---
How do I upvoted 999x?
---
It's cumulative, thankfully - don't have to literally spend almost a minute following the killer around.
---
don't argue with camp_and_tunnel, he's a dumbass if you need swf on ps4 msg me, ill help ya out
---
Yes it does
---
did you just r/woosh us?
---
Thanks again
---
you should probably try and make an effort to find the original artist before you repost a reposted artwork
---
Well nurses blink is a game mechanic. O now you have a paradox. The developers made both. And I don't even see nurses that much. I juke em if they're bad. If they're good they'll get 2-3 of us. I'm perfectly fine with that.
---
It depends on how many applicable players close to your rank are playing. If you're below 15 it tries very hard to match you with other players below rank 15 because higher ranked players can't de-rank below 15 so 20 -16 or 15 are considered new or newer players by the system. At least that's how I've heard it works. 
---
Also if you're on console queue times are normally quite long regardless. Best times to queue for generally higher volume of players are afternoons and evenings on any given day or during special events (double bloodpoints, holidays, or even when rank resets)
---
probably the spirit reaction right at the end: [https://youtu.be/4v8ek9TEeOU?t=41](https://youtu.be/4v8ek9TEeOU?t=41)
---
Depends what’s happening, it’s basically the equivalent of gen rushing. 
---
That is the exact time
---
Yes but the level system is still relatively new to the game. There was well over two years in which someone could have played thousands of hours without getting a single level due to it having not yet been implemented. 
---
Guy makes post about deep wound being underpowered. I make a comment describing all the ways. Sorry for using evidence to support my claims. I'll just say Legion Bad next time.
---
Ain't no one in this game that's thicc lol. 
---
Game was designed with no methods of communication, save for aura-revealing perks and such - some of those are completely invalidated by SWF, which is, and has been, an abomination. I'd be much happier if instead of your suggestion, SWF was removed completely.
---
i have multiple vids of this on my channel, i play on ps4 and my internet is sometimes unstable, maybe thats why
---
Ikr I got like 60-70 downvotes for saying something about it it's insane how defensive people are of shirtless David 
---
This was me when I played killer for the first time on PS4
---
lame
---
well to be honest unless you're running DS killers rarely drop you so not that many people know about that
---
That’s why I said it was possible they hadn’t hacked, not they they didn’t all together. 
---
Plus players take breaks. I stopped playing the game entirely sometime in early 2017 and then picked back up early 2018. 
---
Pretty sure it’s based on American time, the world has to revolve around them it seems. 
---
yeah, maybe i will get downvoted too, for just mentioning it, 
---
I finally broke and bought Leatherface two days ago. Yesterday, I unlocked BBQ, and forgot about him. Besides the monetary barrier (which is laughable honestly), getting that perk is no effort at all - the fact that he starts with it makes BPs go really fast!
---
Im guessing you saw OP but just in case you didn't, they dropped a small update yesterday that fixed this and a few other bugs.
---
Have you ever gotten in a game with a p3 urban claudette who does no gens and when the heartbeat starts they hide in a locker or crouch away. It is the most annoying thing. And when you are the last 2 survivors woth 1 gen left. Instead of doing a gen while im in a chase she camps hatch. I hate players like that
---
I would say just get Adam and wait because I’m an Adam main but I personally don’t use pebble time just because it’s too situational and I’m not good enough to use it in the rare situations it would be useful. 
---
Is this bannable or not?
---
A "regressing generator" is a generator that has been kicked by the killer, so the progress slowly decreases.
---
Normally, generator auras are shown to you in red. If you kick it and it regresses, Surveillance makes it so that the aura is now white. If it stops regressing, so a survivor touched it, Surveillance makes it so that the aura is now shown in yellow for a few seconds before it goes back to red.
---
Sometimes the killer may hit the survivor once just to stop the scream. Especially some survivors that have much louder or annoying screams.
---
Lol. Instead of screaming during insanity, he just yells "ZOINKS!!"
---
It’s a derank build. Who cares how much it works lol. Plus there are gullible people all over. 
---
Just search TheEntityLeftHand
---
I had a huntress called momma bunny who I saw at the start of the game, she stood on top of a hill and I saw her, and she looked at me, she didn't try to him me or anything, she just stood there. I walked up to the hill and started staring off into the distance with her, and then when another survivor wanted to get up on the hill from behind she threw a hatchet at them, in the end game chat she said "this is my Kate and I protect her, don't get close to my Kate".
---
This is the most satisfying thing I've ever heard. I hate survivors who just stand at the exit gate and teabag or wait until you can see them then run out or even worse make you hit them so they fall out.
---
Keep doing what you're doing and punish those who are deserving. 
---
My frames have been consistently somewhat bad, I don’t know why but I’ll have some days when it’s great and others where it’s awful. 
---
Hahahahaha dumbass 
---
I remember I was the last one alive one ever for about 30 minutes. I didn’t just hide in corners. I just repair each gen a little to leave a trail, did her ruin, but killer never caught on so I showed myself.
---
Well, I haven't bought that DLC yet, even less I got that perk yet, so you can guess xD
---
If you play high ranks you know that survivors will pretty much always run straight until the moment you let the hatchet go. The travel time is enough time to dodge or decide to continue heading straight. Especially at a distance like in the clip, the huntress will have a very hard time hitting a shot against good survivors, as the odds are kind of against her.
---
I had a guy do this, but he said "Package Secured" at the end.
---
The thing is, you can say the same very thing in different threads, and get completely different reaction. Like one is downvoted really bad, the other is upvotes
---
This is completely normal, people are assholes no matter what. You 4k and they cry tunneler camper etc, you play nice and let them escape and they call you baby killer learn 2 play etc. Just learn to stop giving a shit I guess, you can't please these kind of players 
---
I mean tbh working through Ruin is better than tapping. It's been proven that it's faster. It's just a problem when you're that person who doesn't know to stop generating skill checks when ruin procks and makes the gen lose like 15% progress.
---
Whispers
---
Nice
---
You do realize that devotion was introduced into the game in summer 2018, right? When the game was 2 years old already. And by that time a lot of players had p3-50 on all characters.
---
I didn't say a guy did nothing wrong, it's quite obvious that cheat was used. All I'm saying that pointing at devotion and player level is not a proof of cheating. 
---
Definitely true, my point was simply that running straight is not necessarily an indicator of the survivor being bad.
---
Complete stramgers. I was solo queque.
---
That's actually kind of adorable.
---
i mean i wouldn't mind if she was at least touching gens, that's like an attempt to progress the game. she didn't. was only hiding in corners.
---
I honestly think that letting go of a generator when a skill check pops up shouldn't make it explode. Perhaps still make it lose progress and maybe "disable" it for longer but it shouldn't explode. What'll happen if they implement this? People can gen tap "better"? I mean not really since I'm asking for the gen to be disabled.
---
You should try playing without volume at all. 
---
0 x 2 = 0 amirite?
---
I have better timing. I've spawn at least two times literally next to a hex totem. One time I spawned in the killer shack and the hex totem was inside the killer shack. I saw it before I could even move.
---
hell ye
---
NANI?!
---
I have to admit that as a meme when I have nothing better to do I love placing all 10 traps around one particular area.
---
I have played this game for a loooong time and i play for about 6 hours
---
And im nowhere near 100 of any offering
---
Unhooking survivors, you?
---
Sometimes  I shock survivors the whole game. I love when I make guys and girls scream.
---
You moron, David! You've already lost, you have been caught by my  #「Superfly」
---
Yep, see you get it
---
Wait so only killers can interact with the lamp?
---
Cu i don't see survivors in this pic
---
My matchmaking time is extremely, EXTREMELY slow, is there a way to make it quicker? I just bought the game and I want to actually be able to play it.
---
Most people who loop do it to survive and not to stall for generators. That guy probably didn't care about how many pallets he used.
---
Or if you used a pallet but end up getting downed anyways.
---
I do plan on buying the expansions. Obviously held off at first to see if I even like the game. Can't....stop....playing....
---
how long? and it;s not uncommon to have longer Q times as a killer
---
Yeah... live and let live lol. You're just dumb.
---
I had a survivor (who playing as Jeff) with DS who was literally dropping all the pallets in a chase as soon as he gets there. I wasn't catching him (I was playing Hag) for the whole early and mid- game because I was just breaking those pallets, but his teammates of course had nowhere to run in the end. 
---
So when there was 2 of them left, Claudette and Jeff, I took the effort of not sacrificing Claudette on her last hook and went for Jeff instead. After that I let Claudette take the hatch, because that game was bullshit.
---
Nurse moves slower than a survivor. This lets survivors freely exit and enter your whispers range effectively messing with you.
---
You know how on a normal killer as soon as your whispers turns on you know exactly where the survivor is? You cant do that with nurse.
---
What's legion? 
---
Funny? How is it funny to ruin the game for everyone? Oh right survivor mains think a killer is not allowed to kill and if you are able to take the game hostage you should do so
---
Btw before i get called salty killer main i play both sides 
---
Did the others get out though?
---
i dont even main her. thats the weird thing :o
---
Not for you. 
---
Claudette's new perk: bby killer
---
You form a deep bond with the entity. When hit, you have a 50/75/100% chance of the entity pulling the killer out of the trial.
---
nah she ugly
---
u right
---
WHY DOES IT SAY DING DONG AND NOT BING BONG?!?!!?!
---
hell no. i aint no console scrub
---
Dude why so salty?
---
So you use whispers only to find the first and the last survivor? That is not worth a perk slot. On a 115 or 110 killer, whispers can help you locate survivors throughout the whole match.
---
You mean optimisation PASS?
---
Give us swimsuit survivors (male&amp;female)!!!
---
One of my favorites was encountering a Wraith that would never hit a survivor more than one time. If you were uninjured you were getting hit, but if you were injured he was not going to down you. Go into the post game lobby to find 4 survivors and a Wraith named "The Nice Killer" lol
---
Seconded, just changed it a while ago, and loving it. Currently typing while repairing a gen
---
i do play kate. she a cutie
---
Eh, a lot of survivors are assholes, and I say this as a survivor main.
---
I had one Myers during an event (before they prevented saboing of event hooks) who very clearly was just doing the level-up-EW daily. He'd stare at us, nod at us when we were on gens, lead us to totems, smack chests for us to search, etc &amp; when he tiered up, he'd just spin in circles. 3 of us let him down us and hook us on event hooks for the bloodpoints, because he was nice to us, be nice back, right? The fourth, a Meg, sabo'd the other event hooks. I stood by &amp; shook "no" as she did one by the exit, and she did it anyway. :(
---
When I play killer, I don't really let what survivors do get to me, but there's very clearly a large number of them who want to get a reaction. When I have a daily to hit people with a killer I don't normally use, I will down them &amp; then spin in circles until they wiggle out -- the amount of survivors who've messaged me to call me bad in post-game is absurdly high. I had one Meg tell me I was "a pathetic, sad sack of shit" when I'd downed her three times &amp; let her wiggle every time -- and she teabagged at the exit. Like, the entire reason I'm being "nice" &amp; not killing you is because I know going against some of these killers is annoying af &amp; I don't want you to have to deal with more shit than you already have today, and yet..
---
Some people just turn off their brain when they see a totem
---
Fun fact: you can add a free space in the center with extra options.
---
I don't find it funny
---
I tried that but I guess I did something wrong, oh well.
---
thanks
---
I think you should post this on the minecraft sub, not here
---
well minecraft sub doesn't know dbd
---
wtf, guys you can literally use MS paint and get way better results. 
---
true, i would of tried forcing him to areas without pallets, which if you do loops right, can be kind of easy if they survivor is a bit brain dead and it sounds like the one you had clearly was haha
---
Try standing a but further away from the gates themselves
---
Connection issue. If you're reading the ping meter before the match starts you should be fine, however sometimes that is inaccurate so maybe try installingg MLGA (Make Lobbys Great Again) for accurate ping detection. That and use an Ethernet cable
---
Only started playing dbd again after a really long break just a short while ago. What is devotion level? Heard about it the first time in my life in this thread. 
---
Sigh. Just use Google
---
That's incredible! I've never seen a generator repair itself with a toolbox before.
---
but she ugly :(
---
dude, literally on rank 1 for almost a year. sometimes i snap. mostly vent to friends but everyone was sleeping. 
---
Sorry, I should’ve specified. It takes around 20 to 30 minutes, and it’s as a survivor not a killer
---
Only one was powered. He said 4 left, silly.
---
LMAO
---
&gt; Nurse moves slower than a survivor.
---
I have blinks for that.
---
&gt; You know how on a normal killer as soon as your whispers turns on you know exactly where the survivor is?
---
No, I don't? I know it's in 32m radius and I usually have a general idea (if I'm moving towards a single gen). But "exactly where survivor is" is not something Whispers can tell you.
---
I run object of obsession a lot so if I fail I just look at the killers aura and start doing weird stuff 
---
I had a similar game vs Myers. Last dude died...I'm running around the killer shack just to get some points before dying. I Sprint off after a window vault and...waaaa the hatch is there. I'm so excited I don't think to look behind me, assuming the window gave me plenty of space.  It didn't :(
---
i got this playing nurse, only one guy escaped through hatch but i got the achievement, and i was killer? idk it was weird.
---
Yes, that was silly  
---
I just kinda assumed everything about that post instead of reading  
---
hmm
---
Yeah, that'd be my guess.
---
I've been red rank before but I'm usually purple &amp; green ranks (and stop playing before I get to red,) but didn't play much for a few consecutive rank resets, so the game put me back to 15. I was the person at rank 15 with all teachables &amp; "high rank" skill.
---
As someone who almost only play survivor I think nurse is fine. She takes a lot of skill to get right with her blinks so if she catches me then she was doing a good job and I can't be mad. There's a lot of counterplay around her teleporting too, I definitely don't think she's "OP", in fact she seems like one of the most balanced killers to me and I don't feel bad when I lose against her. Legion on the other hand... lol
---
I had a game where the exit was open and the last guy decided to hide in a locker and go afk.
---
I was thinking that crows will start doing their thing and announce it. They didn't and I went for a sandwich.. 20 minutes later, the game hadn't ended.
---
This comment, I can totaly relate to. I might not have been around as long as you have, but I have roughly the same experience and toughts
---
Pebble time daddy
---
can we get one for killer tho?
---
like if a survivor dose a thing that's a spot?
---
Yeah. Someone almost died trying to save her, but we got the gen done. I took the time to go to the basement and get a nice flashlight with plunderer's. Even tried to do a flashlight save (was more for practice and I failed)
---
I hate campers.
---
Like a true redditor. \*salutes*
---
Who cares if he has 100 of each item? What are you exactly so salty about? Why does this make you so mad?
---
no
---
Practice and experience, just like learning totem spawns as a survivor. You'll eventually learn "typical" spawning points for survivors (helps if you play both sides) you've got two basic options, option A (probably best) blink to the furthest gen (visit gens inbetween your spawn/start point and the furthest) chances are you'll come across someone. Option B start running perks that give you information, discordance, surveillance, BBQ, whispers, stridor, etc. No one starts at god tier level of locating and executing perfect blinks. Youtube "damnnohtml" scott jund will give you some decent tips on how to be a better killer.
---
No I... I deadass didn’t know that was a thing lol 
---
And how the fuck are DBD players gonna know how to find Minecraft skins? Use logic my man.
---
because everyone knows minecraft
---
Monto: Holiday Get Together...DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!
---
what? how didnt she get crows
---
XD
---
I cant relate, Im always in the first one he opens..
---
Jesus that's terrifying!
---
I know who Einstein is, that doesn't mean I have a Physics PhD
---
Well you should've seen the Entity spikes at the exit, right?
---
your stupid i have a physics phd
---
Or just playing a normal game...
---
Oh God
---
As Nurse, all you other locating tools are BBQ and Nurses 99% of the time.
---
If you can use Whispers to start the match in a quick chase, you can sure as hell bet that you'll turn the tide quicker in your favour due to that quick search.
---
Finding that first player as quickly as possible is vital to a strong match as killer and Whispers is the best perk in the game for it. 
---
It's also good for the inevitable hatch matches you end with as you can easily locate final survivor for the 4K.
---
Whispers starts you off strong, enables a heavy steamroll and then allows you to clean up afterwards.
---
It's one of Nurses best perks due to its utility and arguably one of her must picks.
---
Thank you for your insight. 
---
I started to play legion like the 100 game swf test. No perks Add ons or offerings. At some point player skill matters too. 
---
That said fuck hackers and glitch exploiters.
---
Haha they deserve it for being greedy.
---
I learnt my lesson with being greedy for points against an AFK killer a couple of weeks ago. The trapper was AFK the whole match so we just did gens/ totems and then decided to get out as fast as possible just in case he woke up. Well, my friend goes to the exit gate which is right next to this AFK trapper and I scream (on discord) "No, let me do the gate, I want points!" Pushed my friend out the way and ran to the gate, only to find the ONLY trap he'd placed all game was the one at the gate. He downed me, hooked me and face camped me but let everyone else leave.   
---
Couldn't be mad, it was funny, and I got taught a valuable lesson lol. 
---
Are you a Cenobyte?
---
Now they’re saying he had P3-50 on ALL Characters even ones released post Devotion. Except for legion.  Let’s be real obviously we will never know “100%” But personally I’m like 99% sold. 
---
Also he did get banned so witch hunt or not the devs thinks he cheated also. 
---
what? i went to oxferd univisty
---
Sounds like you met AdmiralBahroo's basement face strategy.  He's a twitch streamer. Someone may be emulating him though. 
---
“Mr.  I have a physics PhD”, just use google. 
---
do you use the f-word o.O .
---
sadly my language doesn't provide a lot of good swear word. so i'm stuck to our version of cunt and son of a whore.
---
I put the RBT but after they get rescued from the hook I go after the survivor that rescued them. I use make your choice.
---
Whispers is her best perk for tracking once you master it. ScottJund did a basic killer guide that included a Whispers tutorial, and if used effectively it is 99% of the time a guaranteed survivor found in the first 10-20 seconds of the game.
---
Only an idiot would assume you to be a salty killer main for pointing out the obvious. I guess some people watch too much shitty toxic streamers and think that it's hilarious, maybe because they play like clowns.
---
DbD has no voice chat, so it's not like F13. All voice chat has to be third-party: console party chat or Discord, which means you have to invite them or join theirs. If you disable messages for everyone who isn't your friend, you aren't going to get any trash talk on your console from DbD.
---
Additionally, if you play the tutorials, you get a (very) basic idea of gameplay, and everyone you'd be playing with in actual games are fairly new too. It's a great time to learn.
---
Grabbing someone off the gen/chest.
---
apparently she aint xd
---
that's how I got mine. as killer
---
Nurse works Whispers better than most of the roster does due to her high mobility. She can quickly check parts of the map with whispers, and hint from there, if nobody is in range, she can very quickly relocate and continue hunting.
---
She's one of its best users due to her blinks.
---
I downvoted exactly one comment in this whole thread. So for "all" of them you cant thank someone else.
---
I once had a killer who called herself the 5th survivor. She was The Pig and I can't tell you how freaked out I was when I realized "Oh shit, that's not Claudette"
---
She spent the match stalking us and helping us do generators. Good times!
---
The event update was most liekly the latest patch 2.5
---
Seeing the list of what legions power can do written out like that, makes their design feel so completely uninspired... It's like the devs thought, hey lets just give legion everything 
---
I wonder if it's going to be like the Halloween event where it takes 2 hours to find a killer lobby 
---
The main problem with playing Huntress on PS4 when people 360 in front of you. The hatchets will go through them. 😡
---
Just play normally. If you see a vessel grab it and try to live. Either way definitely play it because event envelopes are pretty much free bp and so it will ease your grind a little for a few weeks. 
---
Hahahaha yeah I was playing throwaway games cause I was drinking, apologies about that, I normally play at least slightly better 😂
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
Honestly, I feel like I should find out what this item glitch is, exploit it, and not be punished... know why? Because ever since the Legion patch, my game crashes at the map loading screen about 50% of the time when I burn a BPS, Escape Cake, or Pudding. I've also noticed a lot of other players failing to load in when they burn these offerings, or a killer crashing after they burn them.
---
I know it's probably just coincidence, since a lot of people have crashed when they didn't use any offerings, but it's super fucking frustrating.
---
I don't think there is an update for the game when events come out (that I can remember at least) and it would be best to wait until after to introduce new players as people tend to play real scummy during events.
---
Also about the vessels nobody can really answer that well as this is the first event with them.
---
I don‘t know any „trick“ so i guess you‘ll find out by playing urself
---
r/woosh
---
I think keeping all 4 survivors involved with the killer is the most interesting playstyle, and one of the only ways to effectively counter gen rushing against skilled survivors.  Hillbilly gets looped literally exactly the same as Freddy and needs to abandon chases in order to keep pressure up if the survivor is on a strong part of the map, does that mean Hillbilly is a weak killer?  Unless you're consistently getting people trapped and chainsaw downs, which happen much less frequently against skilled survivors, then Freddy gets the down at the same speed/faster than Trapper or Leatherface while also being able to slow progress from other survivors and gain information at the same time.
---
Freddy can most easily and consistently find survivors throughout the entire match out of every killer, except *maybe* Wraith.  Though with Wraith people actually can hide effectively because they can see where you are and use cover effectively, people usually just don't even try to hide against Freddy due to a combination of knowing it's not likely to work and not respecting the potency of being slept. Doctor can easily find people the first time, but then the screams take awhile to happen and he's much easier to hide from.  
---
It's true many of Freddy's individual strengths are overshadowed by other killers, and it is a thing that keeps him from being in the same tier as the strongest killers.  He great at punishing out of position survivors much like Hillbilly and Leatherface are, but it's only with 1 hit and not necessarily a down.  He gets to know when they are out of position though to get that hit, instead of having to luck into like those two though.  He gets stealth but it is possible for people to guess right(since his song isn't directional like Huntress) and run away in time, even if they rarely do.  He can often have near perfect information about what's going on in the match and where, but his power doesn't help him in capitalizing on that information like another killer's power would(who would have thought that another killer with Freddy's information in addition their own power would be better than just one power).  He is good at many things, but relies on the player taking advantage of all of the strengths of his kit to make the most optimal decisions, instead of being able to rely on just one super strong aspect like the top tier killers do.
---
Those red rank swf squads with 3 Decisive Strikes who know how to loop will almost always complete all the generators if I'm playing as Hillbilly or Huntress(unless it's a great map) but I can slow the game down enough as Freddy to ensure at least a 3k + hatch.  He can turn a 5 minute game into a 15+ minute game, and that's very strong.  Maybe you find it fun to win or lose within about 5 minutes and move on to the next game, or just trying to optimize chases without considering the game on a more macro scale, but I enjoy trying to make the most optimal decisions possible based on the most amount of information. 
---
Any killer that can consistently 4k(or 3k+ hatch) throughout all ranks isn't so underpowered they need tremendous help, which is likely every killer in the game.  I personally don't consistently perform that well as other low tier killers like Trapper or LF, but it's likely possible.  It is insanely rare to actually see a Freddy that makes full use of his kit, instead of just playing him like a handicapped m1 killer, but that doesn't mean he can't be much more effective than that.  It's pretty rare to see any Nurse players on console, but once every few months or so a great one will pop up and just slaughter.  And just in case you were about to jump to, oh console players are worse or whatever, I play on PC as well and Freddy can be just as potent on either.

Top 10 fortnite youtubers WHO'VE SWORN
---
Protecting my children as the huntress. I will down one survivor then I will stay near them keeping the other survivors away because I don't want them to harm my children. In the end the survivor bleeds out because the huntress is a terrible guardian. Plus it kind of fits with her lore.
---
I expect Ripziro is right.  While they may be able to salvage some aspects of his powers, I think they are going to have to start over mostly from scratch and see what they can do.   
---
He just has too much wrong with him for it to be an easy fix  If they just fuddle with his values he will be even more of a newbie stomper and get nerfed again long before he is anywhere near viable.  
---
I own a fucking sawmill mate, I'm not speaking out of my ass. I run chainsaws literally everyday of my life. You can run a Stihl with one hand, pretending that needing to squeeze the handle to operate it is not true, unless you mean the safety throttle, which would not prevent any accident in this situation, they help prevent accidental throttling by catching the trigger on something.
---
Also the chain brake has nothing to do with the gif, it's to stop the chain in the event of kickback. Again, this has nothing to do with safety in regards to wtf these two were doing.
---
It provides 10% bonus, not 100% bonus, and only when someone else is near you.
---
I try to do it first thing in the morning.
---
Thanks bro, I'll keep searching
---
You taking the piss? 😂😂😂 if so you fooled a few angry spazzes
---
Yeah that's unfortunate. My apologies.
---
There is actually a method Ardetha uses that typically locates a survivor in the first 10-20 seconds. He explained it in his Nurse guide.
---
Whilst it is a good trick to know and can make Whispers redundant, whispers is still a very good perk to run on her.
---
I love being tunneled the entire match and eventually escaping (almost always injured with the killer super close to down me). Seriously, being chased for 5 gens and getting away with it is the most satisfying thing for me after 1k hours
---
Yeah I watched that, but it never seems to work out for me. Maybe the survivor did spawn there and I'm juat bad a looking around
---
&gt; It's hard to explain over text
---
Yep, draw a circle, move it in one direction, and think about all the points that were outside the circle before, but weren't "in front of you".
---
I can get behind this
---
I think it's because 9 times out 10 they are standing there teabagging or flicking their flashlight off and on over and over again. 
---
If someone is staying near the exit gates to possibly come back and help another survivor that's fine and understandable. But if they are the last survivor left and just standing there, especially if I'm on the complete other side of the map I'd rather you just leave already so I can move on to the next game. 
---
SLuGgiNg iS ToXic
---
Cool thanks :)
---
I found out from another reddit post you can crouch walk/flashlight the hag traps, what are some other things like that that people might not know about?
---
On another note is there any way to find the hatch easier? I can never seem to find it when I'm the last survivor.
---
Protecting my children at all costs is a priority
---
Except that dont work like dat
---
I can hear the picture 
---
Okay this meme is getting old now. 
---
It's hard to hold your fart, you better release it and wait for someone to react, and accuse that person. That's my way of saving my face lol Besides gaming, I also love to follow other projects like this. Now, let me create a smurf to go back to the lower rank. lol 
---
Devs do not care if you DC a lot. They do not enforce it. I was a rank 1 Spirit three nights ago and deranked via DC at the start of each match. I am rank 15 now and nothing. Keep in mind this is post console ban
---
loud is life
---
Other than listening for the hatch's humming, the only way to find the hatch easier is to know where the hatch can spawn in on the map. It does spawn in before it opens though (If Completed Generators == Living Survivors + 1), so if things look dire you can keep an eye out for it.
---
For power interaction stuff, I guess people don't know you can use dead hard to temporarily dodge Myer's stalking. No real reason to do it though.
---
You didn't even spell Oxford right

I also do this as Nea, and then I use my Ebony Mori and Noed when they aren't looking.
---
Exactly. The job of the killer is to kill everyone, and the survivors to survive. Don't play the game if you don't like the rules 😂 
---
i got this playing killer , one had a key , and the best part is, one actually 4%'d his way into this achievment , what are the odds?
---
Probably next week when I'll have painstakingly leveled my Leatherface to level 40. Mark my words.
---
&gt;you should be able to outrun them back to the Hatch if they decide to hit you.
---
Not if it's a Killer with an instant down. Even if they don't have one they can just follow you and pull you off the gen if you start one. You can only do gens safely if the Killer stays at the hatch.
---
If a Killer *really* doesn't want the Survivor to escape they can make it impossible.
---
They need to make an alternative to this garbage ass hatch. It's not fair for the last Survivor to just die no matter what and it's not fair for the Killer to not earn the last kill. Someone has to make a *choice* to lose rather than someone making a decision that leads to a win.
---
I've never understood why people do this.
---
Whenever I'm a Killer and I get into a situation like this, I just walk away from the hatch because these hatch standoffs are boring as fuck.
---
Thank you for your sacrifice 
---
Short Answer: No.
---
Long Answer: The Legion is the worst designed killer.
---
When playing as intended, it's the weakest killer in the whole game. You have amazing first-hit-potential but take ages to down survivors because of your 110% movement speed.
---
When abusing the chase mechanic, it's the most broken killer in the game because you simply can't live longer than the amount of time it takes for you deep wound timer to deplete, doesn't matter what you do. If you see a Legion do that you might as well DC as survivor.
---
When playing like most Legions do, so, just going into Frenzy over and over again it nullifies any skill the survivor and even the killer has. There is not a single thing you can do to not go down as survivor eventually, except of course the Legion fucks up badly.
---
Get a new girlfriend
---
I was thinking more of farming killers but ig that too
---
it never happens for me. the killer always gives up :/
---
wow, that must be SO fun for the survivor involved :/
---
I see the irony here haha
---
But they have to add old carzy lady Laury, for balance.
---
No it doesn't.
---
I HATE THAT THIS GAME TURNS INTO LOBBY SIMULATOR WHEN TRYING TO FIND A GAME WITH FRIENDS. WE HAVE EASILY WAITED FOR OVER AN HOUR TRYING TO FIND GAMES BEFORE GIVING UP. FIX MATCHMAKING ON PS4, IT'S ATROCIOUS.

I ALSO CAN'T FIND WHAT TIME THE EVENT STARTS TODAY
---
If by "in front of you" you mean "from 89.9 degrees to your left to 89.9 degrees to your right", then I agree
---
This is not a good build for Freddy... swap out unnerving for Huntress Lullaby and it totally works though - it makes no sense for freddy but it totally works. Also, get rid of Distressing, Freddy is the only killer that is literally forced to use his power so if you're not at least close to maxing devious every game you've done nothing.
---
it just gives you the p3 head again as if it was your first time, youll still only have one p3 head in your inventory though
---
i had heard the name before but i never knew what it did
---
I play Identity V and wanted to buy this game, so I was watching videos and browsing the reddit. I wanted to ask, what's bad about camping killers in this game? I find it odd that people complain because in Identity V they can still rescue from camping killers and have a persona skill (I think called Bloodweb in this game). Does the strategy of unhook a player and then take a hit for them not work in Dead by Daylight? Or does this game not have good rescue perk or it's not meta for players to run it? I keep seeing streamers or youtubers complain when teammates rescue from camping killers and say they are farming.
---
MAN, GRIM PANTRY IS HORSE DOODOO. THAT LOWER LEVEL MAZE FUCKING SUCKS. I HAD TWO PEOPLE DOWNED IN THERE AND ONE WIGGLED OUT BECAUSE GETTING TO A HOOK IS FUCKING RIDICULOUS AND THE OTHER WAS ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND AFTER SLITERING INTO A BARELY ACCESSIBLE CORNER THEN DECISIVED OUT UNDER THE. IT KILLED MY MOMENTUM I HAD AFTER CHAINING HOOKS THE WHOLE GAME. THEN I GOT A PERSON DOWN AND RBT-ED AT THE END BUT THE TEAM HAD A KEY SO THEY ESCAPED. PEOPLE SHOULD ONLY BE ABLE TO GET HATCH WHILE WEARING A REVERSE BEAR TRAP IF THEY’RE THE LAST PERSON IN GAME. IT’S HORSESHIT THAT KEYS DIRECTLY COUNTER A KILLER WHOSE ABILITY IS PARTIALLY DESIGNED AROUND SLOWING ESCAPE WHEN GATES ARE POWERED
---
What the fuk?
---
Yeah, there *is* a possibility that this guy conveniently has exactly 100 of almost everything in the game. There's also a possibility that I'm actually an undercover BHVR employer looking for accounts to ban in my spare time.
---
You can't say either is 100% impossible. 
---
(´⊙ω⊙`)
---
no, that's body blocking AND holding the game hostage. only survivors can hold the game hostage without body blocking since it's on them to end the trial by either dying or opening gates/hatch and escaping. sitting in the corner and resetting the crows is a hostage situation. because the crows are there specifically to not let people do that since by staying on one spot you don't make any noise. the reward points for staying in game are caped. this is made to not abuse the part where survivors can literally be invisible. I shot you not, this Claudette on some Yamaoka Estate or MacMillan would be impossible to find. that is holding the game hostage. 
---

"Completing the boat generator on backwater swamp"
---
Generally when people talk about better totem spawns, it's referring to when a survivor loads in, their camera does a 360 and oh look, there's a lit totem. 
---
Totems shouldn't be impossible to find, but they shouldn't be served up on a silver platter either
---
I got this achievement as the killer!! I pulled the last person out and just as I did that I got the achievement.
---
That's pretty good
---
It wasn’t because they’re hypocrites, it’s because your comment was horrible phrased and filled with errors, your point was bad, and because most killers are toxic by reaction to toxicity and you’re just trying to call killers toxic straight out. And do you know how fast gens get done? Three hits is easily enough time to get a gen done if your team is any capable
---
ah
---
Then we don't need better totem spawns, we need better survivor spawns. Even then, it's part of the fucking risk when taking a hex, jesus christ. People are so entitled.
---

Ya the point is that literally any time anyone brings up legion for any reason someone just like you comes and rants a post just like you did. You are literally proving the meme. People put art of legion up and one of you come flaring about it. Y’all just need to chill out. I don’t even play legion practically I’m a Billy man, but you nurse players are getting ridiculous. Besides, you’ve needed a nerf for a long time, so don’t start slamming legion unless you’re willing to criticize your own killer as well, there’s a lot that needs to be balanced, just let people have some fun
---
I did this for a few games when trying to get the 500 shocks trophy. It made for some interesting games haha
---
I'll have you know that I'm the solo survivor AND the obsession missing DS :)
---
You play DBD first thing in the morning?
---
SECOND PLOT TWIST: 1 gen was done even though I ran injured for 4 straight minutes
---
what does procks mean?
---
I want scary killers
---
No because it’s still possible for you to find them 
---
Meh, this is more likely cause of the toxic survivors :P
---
I would love any tips you have on killer tbh, especially Spirit because I struggle chasing people down. I’m usually a survivor main and I just switched (still mainly survivor, thought) when I managed to unlock Spirit. 
---
I think I may have come across you last night...
---
I mean, yeah. That’s what I saidz
---
Not to ruin the art (which is great btw, good job), but lore wise the killers just wait. That’s about it. They stalk survivors from the tall grass just outside the campfire and wait until the Entity falls upon them again for another trial. 
---
Are we not going to talk about that the obsession most likely got away because of the drops hahaha
---
RIP Hag
---
🤷‍♂️
---
It's been sometime since I last played.
---
When the killer respects the kobe despite the person that made it being a toxic kate.
---
And I was just kinda bullying the killer, if only I knew it was a rank 17’s first Spirit game :/ would’ve probably let her kill me
---
daddy david please DESTROY me 
---
you really think so? do you know of emotes resetting crows and terror radius/lullabies/sounds that killers have that prevent a survivor from being found?
---
Honestly same, I let them use it and just smack them down again.  
---
In SWF they usually end up breaking the totem once it’s active anyway so... does it really matter (talking from a killer prospective). 
---
I just use haunted ground instead.
---
Do gens against a noed myers! That's a great idea.
---
I usually try to get them angry. Like they usually justify their tunnels + face camps with “he spammed crouch in front of me.” So I kind of BM to lock in a chase and have them commit. Anything that happens afterward is fair game
---
Messaged the guy afterwards, didn’t feel right
---
The two kind of go hand in hand though. The way BHVR has described it, totem spawns are partially dependent on where survivors load in, not the other way around. 
---
There should be a risk, but, and I say this as a hypothetical scenario since it's generally the wrong move to do, if I spawn in as a killer, and just beeline it to my totem, I should be able to get to it before it's broken. And currently that's not the situation. 
---
I don't think anyone is asking for their Hexes to last the entire game.

Months ago, before the level update, I had the progress loss issue and got reimbursed like 20 million BP. I quit playing until just recently. I spent all of my points, unlocking pretty much every teachable perk, but am still pretty low level. Much lower than 91.

I will admit, that is one of the only pictures on this sub that had made me laugh.

Survivor rank?

Damn that Wraith fuckin' cute

i mean i always BM for a joke but still never get tunnelled

---
Yeah just out of curiosity. All the people I play with are at random ranks 
---
You are unreal I would have gotten 1 kill tops. 
---
Wtf am I seeing?

Thats some serious roleplay
---
I NEED FANFIC OF THIS. **AND LORE!** ***STAT!***
---
I'm at survivor rank 15. It keeps swapping between 14 and 15.
---
I think in the far future, if/when this actually happens for me, I'll finally stop playing DbD. Not completely quit, but definitely not feel like I have to play constantly. 
---
It's one thing to grind, get new perks and prestige. But something about buying out "empty" level 50 bloodwebs that feels so awful. Like it's a waste of BP almost. 
---
But hell, not like I can complain, I'll probably only have to worry about this when I get to 4k hours.
---
"We got the victory, we deserved the win" The game's not over until you escape or die. This sounds very entitled. 
---
Byt the update says sloppy butcher doesnt count as healing so will it actually slow down the mending?
---
It’s just what happens. A survivor main is almost always going to think they got away on their own if they’re shown any kind of mercy, or they’re going to be upset and call you toxic, camper, accuse you of tunneling, or say you’re using a broken perk/add on because they hate when they die most of the time. Honestly at the end of the day you can show them sympathy or you can just take the 4K because at the end of the day it’s a game and you can play it however you want to play it. Same goes for survivors, you can play however you wanna play. You can Tbag and taunt the killer all game, you can be a gen jockey, do whatever as long as you contribute, but please at the end of the game if you end up dead don’t be toxic and send hate messages, and if you leave don’t be toxic and send stupid trash talk messages. A nice GG at the end of the game will more than suffice. There’s no reason for anyone killer or survivor to be toxic towards one another. We all love playing this game so let’s not ruin other people’s experiences by being assholes to each other. 
---
I did not run Whispers. it's not an inbuilt perk for killers. while crouching and emoting is an inbuilt thing for survivors. I smell injustice. while your arguments make sense I do not agree with them because killer who didn't run Whispers is kind of doomed. if it was any other map but Lery's and Game, I wouldn't find this Claudette. she had no intention to progress the game therefore no natural ways of me locating her, you know? so little to nothing I could do at this point. hiding is not a game objective. the game's objective is gens and totems and gates and hatch. if you don't do any of those and just hiding - that's holding a game hostage because there is no other way for a killer than search every locker and every corner. the points for staying in game are caped therefore there is no good reason for a killer or survivor to stay on the map since it doesn't progress. hiding is an optional thing, not an actual objective. 
---
It was released yesterday in the PSN store.
---
No problem. Happy hunting 
---
Absolutely no clue, I was in a SWF with someone else, we are both rank 1. We get rank 1 teammates but a rank 17 killer, pretty good job so far, am I right? 
---
Dead meme, let it rest
---
True that.  
---
No
---
- Ruin or atleast Sloppy Butcher is mandatory to get a good Gatekeeper emblem. On Legion you can run both. Smart survivors won't heal against Legion, but most survivors feel the **need** to heal for emblems and heal anyway.  
---
- Only ever switch target in Frenzy if you are **guaranteed** to hit the next red aura. If you are uncertain, just hit the person you already put in Deep Wounds twice.  
---
- Don't try some fancy stuff with hitting people once with Frenzy and then ending Frenzy to chase them as a 110% killer. This only ever works with Cold Dirt and Joeys mixtape  
---
- Legion has an advantage in perks since unlike other killers they do not need a single perk to deal with pallets. Bring something strong alongside Ruin and Sloppy Butcher. BBQ allows to get more Franks mixtape while being a strong perk in general. NOED "can" be used even if I do not usually run it on them. Monitor and Abuse makes you stealthy and allows to find survivors more easily early. Whisper is also great. I actually use Shadowborn and enjoy it on Legion.  
---
- Don't waste your time with the fake chase strategy. It is more efficient at killing people than stabbing them four times for certain, but just hitting them 4 times pushes your emblem score like crazy. Legion can pip with killing 0 survivors, easily  
---
thank you! Just had a look and seen it
---
single survivor. just one on the map. hiding and not touching a single generator. and I am the one not playing on rank 1? 
---
*laughs in iron maiden*
---
Aaaw. That's awfully nice of you to say.
---
I literally just explained to you how there’s no irony. But you do you.
---
That's why he got nerft to the ground? Pulling 4 people with 0 cooldown was busted as fuck. For a reason the DBD Steam page got literally destroyed by reviews, when Freddy came out.
---
Shows me already u're either a low rank killer or never played Freddy, when he came out.
---
No one is gonna get banned for hiding it just aint going to happen. Technically you can kill them 
---
then hit them
---
And he only had one Gen done? Lmao wow. That survivor must have been good. So really you're just mad he didn't run right at you and give you the 4k huh
---
Oh ok. So it was ready all the time? Why not release it at a time that's okay for most time zones? It's kinda late for us people who don't live in North America. 
---
You are not allowed under the bridge. As my personal stalker you stay behind the dumpster.
---
Not gonna end well
---
It was an off day and I felt like getting some dailies done first.
---
Serious, honestly I don't know.  I haven't been playing dbd that for long I suppose.  
---
The billy is only there because I don't want it getting removed 
---
This is something I really don't understand about Legion. You say he is not good and takes ages to do anything, but he's also so good that you might as well just DC when you see him. I don't get it
---
I want to buy them with shards because they look cool and the idea of a super fast killer sounds fun, but I don't want to buy them if they suck or aren't fun to play
---
You made it sound like a dedicated 4 man was bullying you but really you were just hoping for a free kill on a solo survivor who hadn't gotten gens done
---
The killer strategically used all the pallets and got 2 kills as of his patience 
---
ACTUALLY IT PROBABLY IS BECAUSE A FAILED SELF CARE SKILL CHECK IS MOST LIKELY JUST A FAILED SKILL LIKE ANY OTHER FAILED SKILL CHECK IN THE GAME'S MODEL AND THERE'S NO REASON TO THINK THE GAME DISTINGUISHES SELF CARE FROM ANY OTHER MEDICAL SKILL CHECK IN THIS INSTANCE. IMPROPER IMPLEMENTATION MEANS A LOT OF DOUBLING UP ON SIMILAR CODE CHUNKS AND COULD EASILY LEAD TO WEIRD BUGS WHERE SELF CARE CHECKS DON'T BEHAVE HOW THEY SHOULD, ESPECIALLY MOVING FORWARD IF THEY ADD IN NEW PERKS THAT AFFECT SKILL CHECKS OR REACT TO SKILL CHECK FAILURES.
---
CODING'S DIFFICULT AND FREQUENTLY STRAIGHT FORWARD SEEMING THINGS ARE ACTUALLY A HUGE PAIN IN THE ASS TO IMPLEMENT AND MAINTAIN.
---
If you aren't playing in brown ranks and they play poorly they will have noed. Even though the ranking system is pretty trash you need to get some hooks/kills to rank up. If they can't manage to do that they'll be running noed to supplement poor play. In this instance it shouldn't have came as a surprise they had noed.
---
&gt;at the VERY least having it give Exhaustion so that you can just Sprint Burst or other such perk out of the killers hands.
---
Only hurts people who fuck up Dead Hard or possibly Balanced Landing if they couldn't make it to a high drop. This would've been a possible nerf before the exhaustion changes. If you made it so it didn't work if you have exhaustion that'd be a different story. They need to rework the perk entirely tbh. Keep the spirit of a chase prolonger perk without it only activating once you lose the chase.
---
Or both could just leave without getting hooked. 
---
Oh, yeah that’s a thing. It’s incredible that there’s 2000 subscribed to it and that it’s active. There is some really bad art and CGI in there. But, that’s reddit pornography for you
---
After 10 attempts my group finally got it against a brain dead hillbilly.
---
i just want to meet prejudice with my lowercase.  
---
I HATE IT WHEN THAT TEA BAGGING CLAUDETTE BLENDS IN WITH THE MAP. SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I HAVE LEFT TO KILL AND CAN'T FIND HER.
---
Maybe depending on who the killer is and how close he is. If it’s bubba or billy and he’s close I would say yeah hide in the lockers. Otherwise it would be smarter and kinder to just take a hit so the recently injured survivor can escape. 
---
why am i the only one that doesn’t like legion’s design? it’s just a dude with a knife. 
---
Well, you're not wrong. But don't dont say it's bannable. Because it's not.
---
Well I don’t disagree with you, the killers pride/stubbornness is more of what’s on the line here. Same for the survivor,
---
For a lot of players it’s not as easy as it should be in my opinion. 
---
If I’m the killer I just smack em and if I’m the survivor I wait 30 seconds and if they are wanting a full standoff I just try to jump and take the death if that’s what it ends up as. 
---
Yikes, I only do it maybe 1 in 10 matches, but like I said, hopefully devs keep an eye on people quitting just so that survivors can't escaoe with the lunar thing, I'm sure killers constantly quitting after gens are done will raise some flags.
---
it wasn't the Claudette to do one gen. I didn't have ruin so ds user finished one while Claudette was hooked. I wouldn't care if she'd do another gen and escaped through hatch but she didn't touch a single gen in 10 minutes. 
---
The only way I will ever get to those p3 claudette SWFs with purple flashlights....
---
I'm not talking about the Billy
---
When I get a ritual for doctor, I let all for escape.
---
That's some dedication...
---
wtf?
---
Not true. 
---
If they are not making an attempt to complete the game objectives, then they are holding the game hostage. 
---
It’s not all on the killer to end the game, it is also on survivors to try and escape. If you’re not making that attempt, you are drawing the game out so the killer will DC, and you ‘win’ by default, because you held the game hostage. It’s beyond easy to hide on these massive maps as one person, especially if the killer doesn’t have whispers. You are still preventing the game from ending. 
---
They used to be able too! XD
---
Waiting for a sale to get Quentin (And Freddy I guess) with a discount!
---
"Will you come back for me if the killer grabs me?" 
---
*Sees Leatherface come down the stairs*
---
"No."
---
"How is that fair? We played better, we deserved the win"
---
You didn't cleanse all the totems. You deserve nothing.
---
I think it's a bit pedo to live with some random 15 year old girl who you've pretty much never spoken to. Also, I think it's a bit pedo to look [like this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/535306144370130955/540198346963288075/unknown.png)
---
I know lmao. But that was in the days before I started playing. I wish I knew so I could get legacy ;_;
---
Even if survs falsely report?  They can be mardy when not wanting to farm.  How many reports does it take for a ban?  Just seems a bit harsh that the op got banned over it seems was just one incidence.
---
scratch mirror myers is hands down the best thing to do in this game, scare the shit out of people and its so fun to get gen grabs
---
STILL, THEY'VE HAD A TON OF TIME TO MAKE THE GAME DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE ASSORTED FAILED SKILLCHECKS AND CHANGED SELF CARE TO BOOT, BUT HAVE DONE NOTHING ABOUT REMOVING THE WAKE UP ABILITY VIA SELF CARE. WHAT THE FUCK, DEVS?
---
Probably because you were gen patrolling right? If she started a gen you'd immediately know where she is
---
It's holding the game hostage. Holding the game hostage is when one or both sides do something to prevent the game from ending. Killers body blocking someone in a corner or the basement prevents the game from ending. A survivor hiding and doing nothing prevents the game from ending.
---
By that person's logic, only the killer can the the game hostage, which is a ridiculous thought. Sure you can find the survivor but if they don't want to be found, it will be almost impossible for some killers. It's stupid to believe only a portion of the players can break a rule.
---
I subbed as I think it's amusing!
---
My heart was beating so hard! Good stuff!
---
well to me it's holding the game hostage. which is said on rules is banable. they didn't specify on anything, you know? not my fault I can't tell if it's banable or not cause not specifying on things leaves a place for you to decide. 
---
Like I was crawling to the hatch that was at just 5 meters from me and suddendly my smart survivor decided to yell out loud *«I AM HEEEEEEEERREEEEEEEE!!!»*
---
But but but it fits so well
---
Last night I got sandbagged by a Dwight that checked the locker I was in (he saw me get in it) after he called the killer to the basement by closing a chest. So I ran out, got chased, and he escaped. Later I'm on my last hook, and I'm sitting behind a thing of tires in the Trappers TR. I start self-caring, and stop briefly to reposition myself, and I stab myself from a skillcheck I didn't even get the warning for. Trapper turns around and I die. :/
---
and thats the irony.  Just cleanse totems and totems spawn in middle of a field....get it now? lol
---
It has happened to people. If a claudette is urban evading around swamp for 20 minutes without progressing the game at all they are holding the game hostage and will likely get a week-two week ban.
---
it's my objective as killer. her objective is to do gens to open gates. I was doing what I am supposed to be doing. she was hiding. 
---
One day I decided to be Dwight in the brightest clothes I got for him and be basically useless(I still did gens and saved teammates, but wasn't really helping). 
---
I had a game where I just causally saved teammates off the hook and stare the killer down to save teammates. It was huntress, first time she found me she smacked me then realized I wasn't running away so you left me alone. She downed someone and I causally stroll over and start saying no, and pointing, she was shaking her head yes all while this Ace was confused as fuck and what the hell was going on. She hooks him, and tells me no. We had a back and forth, but eventually I won she let me save the Ace. There on out she let me save them, didn't stop me or anything. She played normally til she saw me, someone got hooked in the basement, she came out hatchet ready cause she knew someone was out here. Ready to kill, them she sees me and puts  away the hatchet and watch as I go down and save the person. Later I wanted to give her a kill(she got one, but I felt like she deserved another since she dealt with me). She didn't, shook her head no, as I bleed out on the ground.
---
Funniest match I had on DBD.
---
Lol I really like your guys’ names. But ya this game definitely brings out the bundy in people 
---
You have an interesting sense of humor to say the least chief.
---
Domestically abuse their meat 
---
I found him, thank you. 
---
7-8 hours daily, level 91. Choose one buddy
---
REST IN PEPPERONI
---
hmm i dont think its real
---
I can only defend the killer in hatch standoffs if they have some sort of achievement that requires a 4k  
---
Otherwise, just let the survivor go
---
NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT - I'VE NEVER HAD A TRAPPER BE A JERK IN POST GAME CHAT. TRAPPERS ARE COOL.
---
That game should have been an easy win lmao
---
&gt; No it's mean in front of you in a roughly 45 degree cone at worst
---
Please show me a proof Whispers use cone and not a circle. This video shows how to use Whispers effectively, not just how it works. There's quite a difference.
---
I just thought that people will figure you out and then there's no fun in that :(
---
doctor is writing in his burn book
---
Ayy cheers my guy means a lot &lt;3 You are probably better than you think though, keep at it :D
---
Hahahaha was not expecting it at all lmao
---
Mine continually unequips itself. Pretty good job so far.
---
&gt; Make the killer lose of he's not actively going against survivors
---
That would probably just encourage everyone to play claudette and hide on a corner, can't go after them if they're practically invisible and you're now on a timer. 
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system
---
Then refer to this next time
---
You´re like an SJW trying to stand up for someone else , while that someone just replies normally. Do you feel good now? Now that you stood up for someone, big boy.
---
Im saying right now that wont happen.  
---
there is technically a way to not hide and hold the game hostage as survivor but it goes plus to hostage situation to exploiting. 
---
I do see why people say it's *technically* on me to find someone. but it is, as you said, very hard when survivor doesn't do anything since it's not hide-and-seek game, they have an advantage of built-in way of telling where killer is with terror and other sounds. 
---
technically even the glitching part can be resolved if you glitch yourself to the same spot with lunge, for example. 
---
and technically you could trick killer into un-bodyblocking you just like you make them follow you instead of injured buddy or something. 
---
NOED is easy to deal with. Cleanse every totem you see get all 5 totems during the match NOED won’t even activate. If it does activate and you see someone go down from it look for the totem and cleanse before trying to save. If every survivor looked for and cleansed totems gg ez
---
Hence when I said *try*. I try to do it in the morning, but some times I feel like getting something else done in the morning on a weekend before I brush my teeth. That day I skipped breakfast and brushing my teeth for 2 hours to play a game on an off day, I think I'll make it. Why are you even bothered by it, chances are we will never even meet let alone remember this conversation tomorrow, why does some random guy online brushing his teeth before eating a sandwich bother you?
---
I second that "wtf"
---
Indeed!
---
I find it useful to grab my ankles in that situation.
---
r/enoughinternet
---
Thank you my friend :)
---
Nah, dude. Thats me thinking about Shirtless Myers. But hope that comment is worth the ban.
---
You still can't count letters.
---
IT'S KIND OF AN EDGE CASE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY REQUIRE A MASSIVE OVERHAUL OF THEIR SKILL CHECK CODE, ESPECIALLY IF THE SKILL CHECK IS ACTUALLY TOTALLY DIVORCED FROM THE ACTION IN A MEANINGFUL SENSE AND INSTEAD OF THE SKILL CHECK OBJECT COMMUNICATING WHAT HAPPENS WHEN IT FINISHES IT ONLY COMMUNICATES THAT IT'S FINISHED OR WAS INTERRUPTED AND ANOTHER OBJECT DECIDES FROM THERE WHAT'S SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN.
---
THERE'S ALSO CLARITY TO CONSIDER, AS IN ALL OTHER INSTANCES SELF CARE BEHAVES THE SAME AS ANY OTHER MEDICAL SKILL CHECK. A BETTER SOLUTION WOULD BE TO RESOLVE THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF DREAM STATE BEING SO SIMPLE TO GET OUT OF YET SO CRUCIAL FOR FREDDY THAT INTRODUCE CONFUSING BAND AIDS.
---
I think you have the definition of "stalk" wrong. It impossible for me not to see you comment when you comment on everything. I don't have to go out of my way to see anything you post, that's what is annoying. That's not stalking. 
---
I'm slightly color blind so i see pink
---
Not gonna happen if a billy or Leatherface is there. It's best to just let 1 person get grabbed and the other gets away.
---
I just said there is no explanation and you gave me an article I already read where is no explanation. 
---
Time to get every perk rank 3 on every character now.
---
Damn I hate these immersed fuckers much more than the BMing tbagers. At least the toxic ones give me a good chase and I can play the actual game instead of walking around the map wasting my time on this hide-and-seek shit.
---
You'll still get bonus bp and stuff
---
I’m not “standing up” for anyone. Actually I was the second person to even answer this question and my answer, was trying to help you. YOU took in the wrong way, just reading this post/comments I know the complete type of person you are.. gross...
---
And anyway it took you 2 hours to think of *that* insult? 
---
ok
---
what? its people who run NOED that want the game handed to them on a silver fucking platter. what did they do to deserve having free exposed status on everyone? be shit and fail to apply pressure?
---
IT'S NOT AN EDGE CASE. FREDDY'S BEEN DEALING WITH THIS CRAP FOR OVER A YEAR. MEANWHILE, HUNTRESS GOT HER ISSUE FIXED IN A MATTER OF WEEKS. I GUESS IT'S BECAUSE FREDDY ISN'T A TOP TIER KILLER, HUH, DEVS?
---
LOL. I'd take a tempban to post a comment like saiiyu did with such force. Incredible. 
---
Not a problem if you have dead hard or borrowed time. I can come up with specific scenarios where you can get out too. The point of my post was that it's always better to try and get out rather than giving up one of the survivors. 
---
The best tips I can give for spirit is while you are chasing someone if the scratch marks stop you stop phasing, grass is your friend if you see scratch marks and grass moving pay attention to the grass, since you said you play more survivor if you want to attempt to mind game think about what you would do as a survivor and try to counter it, also remember that she has no window vaulting animation so you can do things like sit on the other side of the window and m1 then jump through it for a mind game. Some good add ons for training I would recommend anything that longer duration and power recovery time since you want to practice they the most on Spirit, for fun I like bonzai and cherry blossom since you phase in and out so frequently most survivors don't know what to do and lastly best add ons I would say are the wakazashi saya and the prayer beads forgive my spelling if it is off I don't
---
Have it in front of me. But that is about all the tips I can give for spirit.
---
Nope. It doesn't.
---
i’ve never gotten more locker grabs on any other killer 
---
How so? I commented on a mere handful of posts this week.
---
WELL THEN AN OP ITEM SHOULDN'T BE FOUND IT WHAT FEELS LIKE EVENT MATCH WITH PLUNDERER'S INSTINCT! IMAGINE A KILLER RANDOMLY FINDING AN EBONY MORI IN THE MATCH AND YOU'RE SURPRISED AND ANGRY BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.
---
Lol Yes!  I love things like League of Gentlemen &amp; Reeves &amp; Mortimer.  Also, Maybe because I'm a girl and it also seems more of a spoof to me XD That pic of Trapper with his babes was funny!  Nice to see the characters differently lol
---
Relatable
---
yep
---
no idea, either side can instantly end the standoff at any time. nothing to cry over in my opinion
---
"Opinions cant be wrong" This post remembered me this
---
What is there to ban for? You have a facecam on literally every single one of your streams. Also, I really regret posting that comment, only because I was forced to look at your face. Also, your greasy hair really compliments your fat face, especially with that cute little neckbeard of yours :)
---
**OPINION -** I DON'T WANT THE FREDDY REWORK BHVR'S DESIGN PHILOSOPHY AFTER SPIRIT AND LEGION!
---
A penny a day will keep the doctor away
---
why is that? it already happened before why wouldn't it happen again?
---
Horribly phrased and filed with errors? Still making up random arguments, huh? I literally explained that I was responding to the fact that you stated killers hitting isn't toxic and it got downvotes just as I said. I also never even implied all killers were toxic, you're just fishing at this point. "Three hits is... Enough time to get a gen done". Lmao, is there even a point to reply after that? 
---
Feel free to do so :)
---
That’s British no? And I can only imagine how old you are lmao
---
*tries not to be a creep on reddit*
---
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT SPIRIT BEING THICC HAVE YOU SEEN THE WAY KATE'S TITS JIGGLE WHEN YOU ATTEMPT ESCAPE THE HOOK
---
Don't report people for reasons outside of that article.
---
I already told you what holding the game hostage means, it's the literal definition of it. Hiding doesn't count.
---
nurse isnt difficult
---
This is a fucking flex 
---
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO PLAY AS FREDDY AND HAVE FUN AT THE SAME TIME 
---
Uh, I wasn't bothered. I was complimenting.
---
lol, not if you’re good with her
---
I'm starting to play again after having  not for a couple months, currently at survivor rank 12. My psn is King_Blu28 if you wanna party up
---
Technically its infantry belt iri head...but thats toxic as fuck so I'd recommend flower babushka and venomous for faster windup and forced exhaustion
---
Don't have a lot of choice, have to to get Deranged Pursuit. 
---
Skilled Huntress has been nothing but trouble for me. As distance is a little hard to gauge, y'know?
---
Sometimes, I play Wraith, and wait for somekne to start cleansing whatever hex perk I have. Then, I trap them with my invisible body. I wait there until the team does the gens, then NOED pops, and then I get to enjoy my one survivor meal. I usually let the others go but if they try and rescue the one survivor that is my dinner, I slug them and focus on my one victim. I’m a survivor main and even I know the shit I do is fucked up, but hilarious.
---
oh lord
---
Just get LF
---
Np
---
The hair couldn't be saved honestly. Way too thin and broken. Got rid of it entirely and looks much better now. Thanks for the advice though :)
---
I spent an entire day playing Pig, just to complete I want To Play a Game. I've become used to suffering.
---
I think it’s more unsportsmanlike in the traditional meaning of the term. DbD is a bit more stringent than that. 
---
I saw one post about this and I thought that maybe the guy was someone inexperienced that though that having a lot of addons was hacking but now that I see the image is obvious 100 exact items of each category. 
---
That guys bitter
---
Design perhaps, but read the backstory. To me, I really like their story and connection with Jeff.
---
Yep, I'm copying it as-is on PS4.
---
i didn’t bother reading it, its all squished together.
---
its a hot fix
---
Look he's not daddy material tho okay. He too smol for that
---
Worst thing was, the brightness instantly flashes when you enter the building, when you leave the building it gets back to "normal". My eyes are still itching.
---
Usually there's a small patch just before events to add in the UI &amp; the timer.
---
&gt; I just realised how much time and effort I've put into this game
---
17.8 hours in last 2 weeks. Not enough info to get total time playing. Number of achievements just shows that you're going for them...
---
I don't understand...
---
Running Iron Maiden on doctor is like using a slug round to shoot a puppy.
---
Where did they come from
---
"He literally just gave you your “trick” the game isn’t gonna just fuckin spawn you in and let u know at all times where they are. go to gens, THEIR OBJECTIVE. "
---
This is what you commented. You came in swinging. This comment is not trying to help. You 're giving a tip that the game gives you in the loading screen. Whilst cursing and writing IN CAPS like I'm somme sort of idiot. YOU took my question the wrong hence you commented like that. And then you turn it around and act like the victim. Typical SJW style.
---
P.S. If you think I've been sitting here for 2 hours thinking of an insult, you're in a delusion of grandeur
---
Man with a plan... or girl I can’t judge 
---
1204 Hours total.
---
that is some suffering right there.  hats off to you good sir
---
FUCKING BINGO lol
---
QUITTERS... ALL 4 SURVIVORS QUIT IN ONE MATCH, 2/4 IN ANOTHER RECENTLY. WHY EVEN PLAY THE GAME IF YOU ARE GOING TO JUST QUIT WHEN YOU ARE DOWNED?! SAD WAY TO PLAY DBD
---
You didn't write clearly in that comment so I misinterpreted what you were saying as "feel free to take the ban". Not my fault 🤷🏻‍♂️ 
---
It’s kinda odd. You’re like the Nurse but also able to be even more unfun to play against cause you can abuse the game mechanics for legit 0 counterplay downs. Especially with how easy you can get a first hit or even chain hits onto people if you want to down someone or want to be completely oppressive, you can and there’s no amount of player skill that can help you once you get tagged. 
---
Username checks out
---
I was saying it because if you play Legion and still havent downed a single downed survivor thats a big oof
---
But there are plenty of things you can do that's not doing the objectives. Staying after exits are done to loop the low level killer who doesn't know how to play well. Slugging the last survivor to wear down 5 minutes because you can. Those don't contribute to the game. The survivor isn't escaping and the killer isn't killing. Those aren't bannable, so why is hiding? 
---
Just because someone isn't doing game objectives doesn't mean it's bannable. Besides? They are doing game objectives. They get evader points if they hide in your distance. That's part of emblems. 
---
I'm just playing devils advocate- take it literally, not figuratively. If they banned for hiding, a lot of people would be banned and they would specifically mention it would be bannable. Don't waste report tickets on false hopes. 
---
You still haven't answered, what about that doctor who camps 3 gens with shock add-ons? How can you win against that? Is that bannable?
---
&gt;The video shows how you use whispers and therefore how it works. They're the same thing.
---
Just imagine that while you're moving forward (and no one's there) a survivor runs from the left towards you. They're not on your screen (outside of 45 degree cone), but they will proc Whispers once they're less than 32m from you.
---
Gotcha
---
You have the personality of a brick. You think your entitled and you have more ego than anybody I’ve met on this subreddit this week. (Changes by the week)
---
I was helping you, rude or not, it was help. Shut the fuck up, you literally are you asking for help, PLAYING a normal character in the game.. get guud skrub 
---
Oh dear.
---
As for Skilled Huntress.. I'm genuinely avoiding using the Iridescent Head. I am well aware how much more difficult I am making things for myself by doing that, I probably should just use them but I don't.
---
One suggestion have leatherface hiding next to the hook in the back revving his chainsaw with a dummy on the hook, he's training for the real deal
---
Btw, using the same insult twice makes it lose its value, sooooo ehhh good try , try again
---
You actually have to hit someone, afflict them with deep wound, *then attack and chase another Survivor before returning to the original target*.
---
Either the achievement is bugged, or the description is flat out misleading.
---
thats a yikes from me
---
Bug fixes. Nothing about the event in it.
---
They run a train on nurse.  That redhead is bae 
---
dw, I forgive you.
---
Yup, not the event yet. *I’m not disappointed, you are!* 
---
I HATE THE FUCKING GRINDFEST THAT IS THIS GAME, I JUST WISH IT WOULD BE EASIER TO GAIN BLOODPOINTS. ALSO I HAVE MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT THE EVENT. I WANT IT TO START ASAP CAUSE I NEED MY BLOODPOINTS AND COINS, BUT THE GAME IS GOING TO BE A SHITSHOW FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS.
---
You are correct. Fixed the prestige bug &amp; the bloodweb refresh issues.
---
This is about what I think.
---
Calm II = +15%
---
Carter’s = +25%
---
Distressing = +26%
---
I just don’t know in which order they’re added, like is it just a total 1.66 multiplier, or individual...
---
Nateisgreat148! Currently I’m at rank 14 I think? I’m down to play
---
I believe the Calm add-ons add 8m and 6m, and Distressing 3 adds 8m. So, 54m would be my best guess.
---
:D
---
You can loop the killer for 30 seconds at the very least and possibly not even use the pallet at the killer shack to prevent a hit/down. Some teammates throw it down immediately which is a really bad idea unless you're going to be downed immediately if you don't do it.
---
Just the permanent ban has been lifted, nothing else.
---
The survivor is trying to force the killer to dc in order to end the match, this qualifies as an attempt to take the game hostage.
---
CORRECT, I AM A CODER ATTEMPTING TO EXPLAIN TO YOU POSSIBLE REASONS WHY IT MIGHT NOT BE AS EASY TO RESOLVE AS IT APPEARS BECAUSE THE UNDERLYING CODE IS FREQUENTLY NOT AS STRAIGHT FORWARD AS IT APPEARS. DISCUSSING CODE IS FUN FOR ME, AS IS SUSSING OUT THE ACTUAL IMPLEMENTATION. 
---
SABOTAGE SKILL CHECKS NOT WAKING UP SURVIVORS IS VERY LIKELY AN INDICATION THAT THE WAKING UP PORTION OF THE FREDDY STUFF IS ROOTED IN THE ACTION BEING UNDERTAKEN. THIS THEN BEGS THE QUESTION IF SELF CARE IS ITSELF MEANINGFULLY DISTINCT FROM THE HEALING ACTION. SINCE WHEN THEY CHANGED WE'LL MAKE IT TO ONLY APPLY TO ALTRUISTIC HEALING THAT ALSO MEANT IT DIDN'T HELP YOU HEAL YOURSELF WITH A MEDKIT, IT'S PROBABLY NOT.
---
IF THEY WANTED TO CHANGE IT SO HEALING YOURSELF PERIOD CAN'T WAKE YOU UP THAT'D CERTAINLY BE VIABLE SINCE THEY CLEARLY ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE A WAY FOR DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN HEALING YOURSELF AND HEALING OTHERS, BUT THAT WOULD THEN MEAN PLAYERS WITH A MEDKIT WOULD FAIL SKILL CHECKS ON THEMSELVES WOULD NOT WAKE UP.
---
THAT MAY BE ACCEPTABLE BUT WOULD REQUIRE TESTING, AND WOULD AGAIN MEAN TIME SPENT ON A FUNDAMENTALLY TEMPORARY BANDAID THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT BE LEFT IN PLACE WHEN FREDDY IS ACTUALLY REWORKED.
---
I've no idea. I just add them and assume smallest, that way I don't over estimate.
---
Right, but there's counterplay by survivors, such as hiding behind gens or in lockers. So there's no way to know for sure that a survivor is close. That change to Whispers wouldn't have any counterplay if you can tell immediately that there's someone within 24 meters.
---
And survivors are never running towards you, from outside of a circle into it, right?
---
There's a glitch right now. You will get stuck in a locker and can't be pulled out. You're stuck pretty much. I've seen it with team mates. I'm not sure but I think they have to dc to leave the match. 
---
Doctor has add-one that make it a constant heartbeat in T3 madness, but it’s not actually real (I don’t think). But then again, that’s what I think
---
Very original post. Good job. 
---
They said in the dev stream that there will be a BP event AFTER the Moonrise event finishes. Probably for 2-3days when it finishes if previous events are anything to go by. Either way I'm saving my BPS, Envelopes and Puddings.
---
Meg runs 2% faster than other survivors because reasons.  It checks out I consulted with a scientist.
---
As a killer main I don't think DS is Overpowered... it's just whenever I get hit by it I just lose the game automatically
---
As a survivor main I don't think NOED is Overpowered... cuz the killer's usually sh't if they use it
---
im usually just here to troll but.. you should really delete that video. the developers are REALLY fast at banning people who use exploits - and you giving video proof of yourself doing it is the dumbest thing you could do.
---
Or they are just hiding. Either way killer is still able to finish the match by finding snd hooking them
---
SneakyMacD, rank 6 Survivor. Add me up
---
Man there’s a difference between trying to survive and trying to force me to disconnect and forfeit my earnings.
---
nop
---
I'm always moving my camera around to watch my back. I will say the one big downside is when it's on cool down. I'll have to give spine chill a try to see if I like it more.
---
Lol brah 500 hours and you don't know killers perks yet?  Freddy came out like ten years ago lol
---
STILL IT'D BE A PROPER CHANGE THAT FREDDY SORELY NEEDS. ALSO, I THINK PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING FAR TOO MUCH WHEN IT COMES TO THE FREDDY REWORK. THE IDEAS THE DEVS TOSSED OUT A WHILE AGO INDICATE THAT FREDDY'S MECHANICS WON'T BE CHANGING.
---
But both players still can play and finish the game. Taking the game hostahe means its impossible for one party to finish the match,here it is still possible for the killer
---
that shithead was Ochido's buttbuddy, when Ochido became popular... both are trash.

Wow, Mariah Carey looks good! Yas, Mariah, you betta fucking work!
---
what a rollercoaster of emotions
---
Huntress on ps4 is 100 times wth, probably harder on console
---
Dude in op scenario the only way for a survivor to finish the game is to repair a gen and take hatch.  If they aren't doing that then they are specifically not playing to end the game.  You...you get that right?  Please get that.  I feel like Carlos Mencia in South Park trying to explain fish dicks to Kanye 
---
lol sorry, I felt lazy xD
---
Proxy camping and tunneling Legion who can’t take his eyes off the hook....huge shock. 
---
I really believe it is it happens that often. I never even see the skillcheck appear on screen.
---
I've been thinking about taking technician just because of this. It's infuriating.
---
Legion gets a mapwide heartbeat when he hits someone with the Iridescent Button on.
---
Made a pretty cool play against a huntress with Noed and 1shot hatchets. The killer hooked my friend fairly close to the gate. So I rushed the save in front of the her with BT. I went down but I had deliverance still up. When she finally went to hook me I waited for her to reload when I unhooked myself, broke the hook(breakdown), and sprint bursted for the gate. 
---
Legion with an iridescent button, but it only applies when in Feral Frenzy and if you stab someone.
---
Improve that video and put the Haddonfield intro in the ending.
---
I manage to spread gen progress without this perk, so I prefer equipping a perk with more utility
---
Two more hours my dude
---
But the killer can still end the gamein the op scenario. Ergo not holding the game hostage
---
Nah it's a waste of a perk slot man.  It is so easy to avoid the 3 gen if you just start the game off by repairing the correct gen or two.  Even if your teammates shit the bed with map awareness you individually can prevent a 3 gen
---
It’s a norm for me to let a 3 man game win if they’re struggling or if one survivors dc’s like 3 minutes into the game. I hate playing games like those it doesn’t feel fair.
---
CAME HERE TO FIGURE THIS OUT THANK YOU
---
Probably cause we buy more in general
---
1900 utc
---
I once went against a Pig who forced us to do gens, no one went down, I can't recall any hits but I think we had some dc. At the end I realized their name was Gen Supervisor.
---
I didn’t? You can’t guild yourself, and I don’t know who did it.
---
You ever played as a solo survivor? You have to sneak. 10 minutes isn't long. He was just trying to survive and sneaking is the best way to
---
you can guild yourself, but just seems odd to get gold on a 3 min old post
---
How
---
In terms of just scare factor alone the spirit has to be the most terrifying of the bunch
---
Ban more playera as the game keeps dying. Business 101
---
Leather face with insidious L O L
---
I do this with trapper.  I use Insidious and the padded traps that don't injure you. I use a brown trapper bag and I grab all the traps and put them in the basement.  One on the chest and the rest in a line in front of the chest. The amount of items I've earned is hilarious. Even better, when they try to fer an item out of the chest, I attack with NOED. lmao
---
Less than 2 hours.
---
Myers makes me bi at this point 
---
Yea I was surprised too. I wouldn’t waste money on my trash posts lol
---
Killers and survivors can enjoy finding a Dwight coming out of a closet with that 
---
Hi I’m not the guy you were arguing with or OP but I think the main point was that this particular guy is blatantly cheating. So the disagreement arose when you tried to make it about another person who DC’s. Both cases are bad, but this particular thread is specifically about the fellow with hacked saved files.

---
I agree that he’s busted and unfun at times but people spent money on him and it’s unfair to them to have him nerfed into the ground until they change him. Regardless of dbd related elements, selling a product and then making it unusable is a horrible business move anywhere in the world. I’m sure you remember the IPhone scandal about them slowing down old gen phones and the outrage that caused.
---
Should be in the Store menu.
---
Let a dead meme rest? On /r/deadbydaylight? Oh you sweet summer child.
---
When I play Survivor it's always Jeff with the occasional Kate, and I can confirm this. 
---
No it isn't, it's a terrible perk that is only remotely effective in niche situations. 
---
thank you
---
I AM SICK AND FUCKING TIRED OF KILLERS DODGING LOBBIES AT RANK 1. THEY'RE DODGING NON-SWF LOBBIES ALL THE TIME NOW.
---
GROW A SET OF BALLS ALREADY, WILL YOU?
---
I do understand that not everyone is doing this just to win, but I do think that survivors against a higher rank killer may have more of a chance than a killer against high rank survivors, especially in a swf/voice chat scenario. 
---
Not sure what it is on PS4 but on PC its a Tab in the Store
---
I think I just saw a bug that NOED exposed effect didnt show until the second person downed. Could be wrong, but I'm fairly sure one guy got instadowned by a nurse and I didn't receive the exposed status effect right away when I had exhausted on....
---
He made no attempt to do gens or work towards his own survival. 
---
Absolute hero
---
The quality of this subreddit has always been below average and will continue to be due to the nature of the voting system. At one point the mods tried to have some guidelines (like images must be directly related to DBD more than through the title) and only received harassment from the users.
---
This also led to the local habit of adding a random "smol billy" or other DBD related icon somewhere to an unrelated image so you can loophole the low quality content through, and the mods pretty much gave up.
---
All you can do is upvote good and helpful content and downvote the opposite, but as it is the majority seems to enjoy low effort memes and posts.
---
I wish I could see my progress on ps4.
---
Like you said, its just a meme. Who cares?
---
Perk idea “Mind of a child” believes in god, 
---
But then the sub would have to talk about the game and oh boy would that turn bad really fast.
---
Most people seem to be overcompensating for their lack of skill by pretending to be elitists.
---
Thanks kind sir/madame
---
I suppose that's true especially on maps like Azarov's Resting Place or Badham Preschool where almost everyone knows that gens on maps like those are pretty close together, but I just find Deja Vu to come to use so that you can be aware of one area of the map that has close generators to each other while at the same time memorizing the other area of the map that doesn't show the highlighted generators, so that way you know which gens to power through because of all the information you are granted.
---
Detective Dima shalt detect.
---
Oh come on that ain't even a camp.  No gens left lol. 
---
Go to the store and hit R1 to cycle through to the Shrine of Secrets.
---
Its a secret.
---
I think I might have heard of that scandal, but memory on it is pretty vague. Regardless, this is something I did not take into concideration and agree with what you said.
---
Hey, I'm not too knowledged on events but why save BPs? 
---
SHE AINT THICC I AGREE BUT SHE STILL GOT THAT TONE BOOTY WHICH IS ALSO APPRECIANLE BUT PEOPLE NEED TO STOP CALLING HER THICC.
---
There is 2.5.2 PS4 just got it today.
---
I feel you. Stocked up 1m just for this 
---
So would you rather have distressing or bbq
---
God didn’t technically kill anyone in the beginning of all creation though technically. He cast Lucifer and his lot down to hell, but this to me seemed like he’d defeated and then banished them without spilling actual drops of blood. I mean, he’s god, and Christians believe god is all powerful so he could pretty much snap his fingers and blow up every star in the universe if he wanted, so there’s no reason the believe he couldn’t defeat Lucifer real easily. 
---
Therefore the oldest killer WOULD technically be Cain. 
---
Yup. But it's the best skin I've seen for my main in a longgggg time
---
I approve!
---
People who want to browse the subreddit and enjoy discussion and quality memes that don't overflow other posts 
---
You're talking as if they intentionally added it into the game. It's hard to locate and fix bugs, depending on the bug, it can take a very long time
---
man Michael sure is antisocial
---
I mean in the literal sense sure it is still technically a camp but it's not one where anyone has the right to be upset about it.  At that point the game is over doors are more than likely open.  There's literally no objective to protect at that point so you can't reasonably expect a killer to leave in that scenario unless he just wants to be super nice and give free escape.  Anytime I get facecamped at endgame I don't bat an eyelash.  Pull that shit with gens up though and you're a pathetic trashcan lol.  
---
Agreed dude 
---
Your posts are actually good and have effort though! I’m talking about ones that literally take seconds to make.
---
~~I don't think the game will be play after you just have everything. Especially since the progression system in that game is non-existent without leveling your characters.~~ We play for the pain fellows.

Dude this is the DBD Sub. It has been like this for a long time. I have just come to learn to not use this Sub besides memes.
---
to stalk the pig of course 
---
Yeah buddy gonna need the sauce for that later for research purposes
---
Disagree, you can have a lot of items, devotion isnt in for that long. I have some addons / items on killers like 50x stacks. And they are not cheated.
---
The clean cut 100 ones on offerings are kinda iffy.
---
its to fix the item duplication and prestige issue and game crashing when playing kyf 
---
Gonna assume its the event that is coming out today
---
Someone's salty that they didn't capitalise off it
---
It shows the 2.5.2 patch notes on the news screen.
---
-Fixed an issue that caused the Bloodweb not to refresh when switching characters on the level up prompt.
---
-Fixed an issue that caused the Bloodweb not to refresh when switching characters while opening a Mystery Box.
---
- Fixed a prestige issue that allowed abusing the UI to Prestige low level characters.
---
-Fixed an issue that allowed players to swap characters at the same time as purchasing a mode in the Bloodweb, causing the items purchased to appear on the wrong character, and causing the Bloodweb paths to break.
---
-Fixed an issue that could cause a crash in the tally screen of a Kill Your Friends match.
---
I know it has, but the problem seems to be getting more severe the past few months.
---
I was trying to cap out but slacked a bit haha. I got some dailies I didn’t do that maybe I can push myself to 900k today while doing the event. It makes me motivated to possible prestige another survivor during the event too because I have all chars I don’t play maxed at 40 and my main with all perks at tier 3 prestige and another feng min at prestige 2 maybe I’ll prestige 3 feng or start working on Claudette no point in dumping all these points into my already maxed out char.
---
You are indeed right.Hilbilly takes very little skill.You can check my post history and see for yourself.However legion takes minus zero skill.He is very weak.I dont argue that.However he ignores all survivors mechanics by frenzying.That is why he has no counterplay.Chases take like a minute or two but no matter what you will go down.Guaramteed.That is what Im arguing.I truly hate legion because he encourages tunneling one guy for the whole game.Im not the only one thinking this.Big figures in this game agree with my points.I was a little harsh calling you toxic for playing a killer you bought but keep in mind that survivors bought the game too and can dc if they feel like their time is wasted.A game against legion is time wasted.Either he tries to play fair and survivors mend for 3 minutes or 2 guys get tunneled to death.Anyways do what you want because everyone is entitled to their own actions and we cannot change other people.
---
Noed punishes gen rushers. You always need to expect that the killer has Noed, so after finishing the gens, go check all totems spots you saw during the match. My strategy is not to cleanesing all the totems but just checking the spots you remember. It work very well for me.
---
What else would you recommend then 
---
This is adorable &lt;3 my girl spirit is so happy for piggy 
---
Yup and that's why I have just stopped posting because if it's not a meme it gets no attention.
---
Now that I could read it, I don't think avoiding the 3gen strat is worth a perk slot. Also you can avoid it without the perk by not doing nearby gens.
---
Advice.  Next time you play read through the descriptions of every killer perk so you understand them otherwise you won't be able to counter play them 
---
You weren't kidding when you said shittier
---
They were at one point. Then everyone freaked out.
---
Then the smol billy loophole was found. Then the mods gave in and allow all the memes once again.
---
I wish I could tell you homie😫 hopefully someone knows
---
I always love when you realize you fucked up and they can flashlight save, but then they fuck up the save anyways and you get them.
---
COULD YOU EXPLAIN WHY SABO SKILL CHECKS DON'T WAKE YOU UP? UNLESS I MISUNDERSTOOD, YOU SAID THAT THE GAME PERCEIVES THEM ALL THE SAME? I'M KIND OF CONFUSED
---
SINCERELY, 
---
GUY WHO DOES NOT UNDERSTAND COMPUTER STUFF
---
Using Leatherface chainsaw to Hit more than one survivor .
---
originally I was gonna draw her in a geisha outfit to show that she was helping piggy with her hairdo :')
---
hey, at least im honest.
---
I would have DCed too tbh... that was a shitty way to play that game. Was it that hard to take your eyes off the hook?
---
Once you understand each map you can safely guess where all the Gens are going to be and avoid the last 3 Gens being close together fairly easily (others can still fuck it up)
---
But it makes gens go slower 
---
If only genrushing was a thing
---
I was gonna talk about Kate’s ASSets  but Gilette made me better
---
I don't mind them as long as they're creative, but that's just the way things swing on reddit
---
Lol when did I say it made me good? 
---
The best part is when survivor think you can't check lockers during frenzy
---
Big facts. 
---
The creative ones I have no issue with, I like them. The issue comes when you see a post that just says “when you [insert thing that happens in 70% of matches] XD” 
---
No0b3 and nice in the same sentence? Lmfao
---
r/softwaregore
---
Aww thanks man. This is my favorite community by far and so it is super neat to see cool artwork and cosplays and I totally get you!
---
It worked for me 2, thanks.
---
NO
---
What were the methods i never heard of them
---
Oh Snap! Mariah Carey plays DBD!? 😂
---
Claudette morphed into a building.
---
That is part of the reason why I recommended the add ons before you get adjusted the power can be a bit tricky so the longer duration helps you figure it out and the shorter power CD makes the punishment less for messing up, but my recommendation is try to hit them once normally if it looks like it will take a bit to catch up or if they good at looping then your power is good also of you think you know what they will do next use it and cut them off
---
Dying Light or Ruin. Or both.
---
I love the pause after you hit them; then the look off to the side, like you thought to yourself "Did I really just hit them?".
---
Ayy cheers :D
---
theres so many "looper etc" reports that they literally dont care anymore
---
And there's me as Kenny still playing on a CRT monitor.
---
What exactly did you change? Nothing works for me.
---
Nope, is the prestige bug
---
It's just to fix the free prestige cheat
---
I have All killers at P3 level 50 except Legion, which Is P2 and level 20 or something, I'm really done with him
---
in 1:08 hours.
---
But that wasn't the point the original commenter was making tho. if it was you would be right. i think you misunderstood them
---
They are preparing for the event lol
---
Today at 2 I heard!
---
I love how happy Michael is!!
---
Ahh cool what was the prestige bug? Havent heard of it 
---
HOLY lmfao what's going on here lolol someone fill me in
---
Jokes on you I don't need to be saved I get 1000 points for breaking that totem survival means nothing to me
---
They do care, they just ignore everything that has to do with looping, camping, tunneling etc
---
First RPDR is here, now it’s Komi-san?? So many things I love together; when’s the Drag-Komi-DBD trio meme gonna arrive?
---
Idk if I love this or hate this
---
Happy new year everybody~
---
I love the legions in the back
---
Haha! I think it surprised me more than the Meg...
---
then let me rephrase: theres TOO MANY looper etc reports to see the legit ones about actual hackers, which means they dont really do much about them
---
I am a 15 year old girl. Sed is a man who is significantly older than me. I have never actually spoken to him, so him suggesting that I live under a bridge with him and my boyfriend ThedankDwight, who is 16, with no school or wifi is very fucking creepy.

I just play Clown and hit everyone with bottles. I'll then say something along the lines of,  "Sorry guys, I'm just... clowning around", or say something about trying to give people bottle service, but they kept running away.
---
So nothing else to slow game down since ruin is cleansed in seconds ? Lol 
---
Just like in game lol
---
You made this song number one~ *Halloween theme just blares in the distance*
---
Imagine reading the posts from last hour instead of asking the same question 100 times. 
---
Wouldn't that be a better world?

WHEN IM TRYING TO LOOK AROUND ME IM ALWAYS WONDERING WHAT I LOOK LIKE, I KNOW I CANT POSSIBLY GO IN A PERFECT STRAIGHT LINE
---
Lol its legion he already slows the game down without any perks
---
&gt;Eat flash
---
*Flash...*
---
**FLASH LIGHT!!!**
---
Komi-san is good too.
---
Make sure before you lose the file your editing to go to the properties tab and make it “read only” so the game doesn’t default back when you launch it
---
Well I wanted something to slow game down since ruin is cleansed fast and since prove thyself is popular that means gens get done even faster 
---
I see that lol I’m at least trying to be a GOOD legion player and not be scummy 
---
ITS EVEN MORE STUPID WHEN YOU REALIZE THAT YOU´RE PRETTY MUCH STUCK WITH HAVING SHITTY PERKS ON YOUR FAVOURITE KILLER/SURVIVOR UNTIL LADY LUCK HITS YOU IN THE HEAD WITH THE STUFF YOU WANT. IF YOU´RE GONNA MAKE IT THIS FUCKING GRINDY, AT LEAST LET US CHOOSE OR SOMETHING
---
ALSO WHERE THE FUCK IS THE EVENT
---
That's not true, the one that got hit first turned back right into me. I would have downed the others if they were nearby, but I went after the closest which happened to be the rescued. 
---
As for the "proxycamp", I was heading towards gen and caught a glimpse of another survivor heading towards hook so yeah I went back after them instead of ignoring it like a fool. 
---
Well I get my ass handed to me with him cuz prove thyself now and how slow he is without running 
---
I've been burning my Haddon field add ons because of this just funny
---
WE COULD USE MORE PERKS THAT GIVE BP IN EXCHANGE OF INTERESTING STUFF (DISTRESSING). INSTEAD OF BBQ THAT IS EFFICIENT AT BOTH FARMING AND BEING GOOD, OR PLAIN USELESS PERKS
---
That’s actually really dope
---
Everyone with a set of eyes saw how you played that hence every comment on your post unanimously telling you to do the same thing.  You continuously kept your eyes on hook weren't patrolling most gens and everytime you hit it was then followed by staring intensely at hook.  You injured 2 survivors but insisted on camping and then tunneling hooked.  You are miserably alone in your account of what happened dude.  Read your thread
---
If exit gates are opened and if I'm caught I expect the killer to camp me. If I'm the killer and I catch someone with doors open you best believe they're getting camped. 
---
WHY ?
---
Do you remember the name of the killer? If it was basement warden tums then it was me. I’ve done this for a few weeks a month or two ago. I definitely remember saying no touchy and talking about deranking cuz someone got mad lol
---
I watched the video, you can't make excuses for yourself man. That was still camping even if it wasn't face camping and it isn't any fun for anybody. If everybody in the comments is downvoting you and saying you were camping... well the shoe fits bud. Learn how to have fun I guess
---
I HAVE CLASS IN AN HOUR FUCK THIS
---
Adds 33.3% to the wiggle bar. 4 drops and the survivor is free
---
Nothing but love. 
---
This made me smile
---
&gt; Camping, tunneling and playing legion.
---
one of these things is not like the others
---
Did they actually remove the massive invisible walls on that map or did you just get lucky and find the one spot in that fucking house that didn't have one  
---
(If you can't tell I fucking hate that map)
---
Bricky has a guide on the Doctor where he tested the terror radius of him with the purple Calm add-on and Distressing.
---
[Here it is.](https://youtu.be/FI5L1Pvfs3Y?t=1092) 
---
It's a pretty large radius. Like I don't know, about 60 meters away, give or take.
---
The largest terror radius you can have is around that range. Using the purple and yellow Calm add-ons, plus Distressing, you'll be maximizing the radius you can get with the Doctor. About 65-ish meters or so. A bit more or less, but it's there. And it's annoying as hell to face someone with that especially on the Game lol.
---
What what an idiot for jumping off the ohido ship before he got perma banned

Tell me about it, lol. I had two games in a row last night where I did FOUR GENS and I still died because nobody did the fifth 🤦‍♂️

My friend and I had fun running into lockers next to him so he could pull us out. Its pretty cool being sucked into dream world by locker grabs
---
Basically you hold the button to prestige a character and at the last second you use the quick change to change to another character and it prestiges them instead. So you could prestige characters without wasting a single BP .
---
I personally use BBQ&amp;Chilli, Franklin’s Demise, Monitor&amp;Abuse and Enduring. 
---
BBQ&amp;Chilli for the auras and extra BP is always good. 
---
Franklin’s Demise because you can land several hits in several survivors. It can really mess with their rare flashlights and toolboxes (those stupid keys as well) so it’s a very nice perk on Legion specifically. 
---
Monitor&amp;Abuse because it gives you an even smaller terror radius then before, letting you get closer to survivors before initiating a frenzy. The extra FoV is also nice for spotting survivors. 
---
Enduring because Decisive Strike messes up Legion big time. Try and follow up with a standard hit after DS since you’ll recover faster. Helps when you end up getting pallet stunned during frenzy as well. 
---
I wouldn’t take perks that slow down healing. I find that the blade add-ons help a lot for slowing down the game since the base mend time is pretty fast. Chain hitting survivors becomes more valuable then, and at least when they are done mending, slower heals aren’t annoying them if they do decide to heal up. Movement speed, power stun cooldown, meter charge cooldown and duration are all good add-ons to enhance your power. 
---
I UNDERSTAND THAT TEABAG QND FLASHLIGHT BLINKING IS SEEN AS DISRESPECTFUL FOR A KILLER, BUT I DONT GET WHY IT AFFECTS PEOPLE SO MUCH
---
if i just wasn't lazy, it woulda been better.
---
but too lazy :/
---
[MFW](https://imgflip.com/i/2sfchr) \*Moon Walks the fuck outta this thread\*
---
Dying light doesnt really help.   The time it takes for any survivor (let alone the obsession) to die on the hook the gens are already finished.
---
wait, why *wouldn't* you use a slug?  /s
---
Perfect
---
*laughs in bisexual*
---
?? He never said that. He just said he got free BPS lmao. If you didnt exploit the glitch for bps jokes on you

WOULDNT IT BE THE OPPOSITE ?

---
oh my GOSH
---
Holy shit thats dumb 
---
Doors open with DS and dead hard. Ye can’t see why you got camped. 
---
I CAN'T SAY ANYTHING WITH AUTHORITY BECAUSE I HAVE NEVER SEEN DEAD BY DAYLIGHT'S CODE. DO NOT TAKE MY POSTS AS DEFINITIVE STATEMENTS, THEY ARE NOT. DON'T READ ANYTHING I'VE POSTED AS "THIS IS HOW IT IS ACTUALLY IMPLEMENTED" BUT "AS A CODER LOOKING TO MAXIMIZE REUSABILITY THIS IS ROUGHLY HOW I MIGHT IMPLEMENT IT".
---
I WAS MERELY TOSSING OUT POSSIBLE IMPLEMENTATIONS THAT MIGHT LEAD TO HOW IT CURRENTLY IS. IN THIS ENTIRELY THEORETICAL IMPLEMENTATION THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT WHATEVER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR HANDLING SKILL CHECK FAILURES, AND THEREFOR WAKING A PLAYER UP, WOULDN'T CHECK WITH THE OBJECT RESPONSIBLE FOR GENERATING SKILL CHECKS OR MONITORING PROGRESS BUT WOULD CHECK IN WITH THE TARGET OF THE FAILED SKILL CHECK AND THE ORIGINATOR. OR EVEN MORE LIKELY THE SKILL CHECK OBJECT WOULD REPORT THAT PARTICIPANT X FAILED AND BOTH THE PARTICIPANT AND TARGET WOULD BE LISTENING FOR SUCH AN EVENT, AND WOULD CHANGE THEIR VARIABLES OR TRIGGER BEHAVIOR AS WAS APPROPRIATE.
---
THERE MAY BE A DREAM STATE MANAGER THAT TRACKS WHO'S IN THE DREAM STATE AND WOULD ALSO BE LISTENING IN FOR SKILL CHECK FAILURES, OR IT MAY BE IMPLEMENTED AS A PORTION OF THE HEALING ACTION'S CODE. ALTHOUGH I WOULD PROBABLY GO WITH THE FORMER AND TIE IT INTO FREDDY'S POWER, AS OTHERWISE THE GAME WOULD BE CHECKING FOR DREAM STATE STUFF EVEN WHEN FREDDY IS IN THE GAME. IT IS VERY LIKELY THERE IS ONLY ONE HEALING ACTION THAT ONLY DETERMINES IF HEALING IS ALTRUISTIC OR SELFISH ENTIRELY BY CHECKING IF THE ACTOR DOING THE HEALING AND THE ACTOR BEING HEALED ARE THE SAME ENTITY. THAT IS AN EXTREMELY SIMPLE CHECK THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE CREATING TWO DISTINCT HEALING ACTION CLASSES THAT WOULD THEN REQUIRE EXTRA BOOK KEEPING TO ENSURE CHANGES IN ONE ARE REFLECTED IN CHANGES IN THE OTHER, OR CREATING AN EXTRA VARIABLE TO TRACK IT WHEN IT ALREADY HAS TO TRACK WHO IS DOING THE HEALING AND WHO IS BEING HEALED. HOWEVER BOTH OF THOSE IMPLEMENTATIONS MAY VERY WELL BE HOW DEAD BY DAYLIGHT ACCOMPLISHES THIS. I DO NOT KNOW FOR SURE.
---
ONCE AGAIN, THIS IS ALL EXTREMELY THEORETICAL. THE FUN THING ABOUT CODING IS THERE'S ALWAYS A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO ACCOMPLISH THE SAME TASK.
---
Who gives a shit what random people on the internet you will never interact with again think the way you have fun in this game is indecent? 
---
Not talking about you here, but SO MANY people that play this game worry about what the "community" thinks and i have no fucking idea why. The mind boggles.
---
Care to elaborate how not wasting my time reporting petty shit I don’t care about makes me dumb?
---
You are the type of person who craves approval from anyone in any type of authority. It’s impossible for me to have less respect for you.
---
Literally this but hatches. It's orgasmic to pull a teabagging survivor out of the hatch just in time. I bath in the salty insults and cheating accusations.
---
Again, what did you change? Nothing works. The file does not get changed after running the game, it just ignores ever setting.
---
"And don´t say whatever is fun..." well but its true tho. You are the monster in this slasher. While yes, your main focus should be on getting survivors killed, your strategy is up to you. People in this game are toxic af, and they will b\*tch about everything you do. But hey, you were never given any rules right? I just ignore all the crybabies and play the way i want. So even tho you said you don´t want this kind of answer, just do whatever makes you feel like a winner, and a true killer.   
---
(Camping hooks might be fun, but its not really effective for you if the survivors aren´t stupid, just saying \^\^)
---
obviously he had a good dentist
---
Yeah, but it was very easy to fuck up the timing and basically prestige a character losing all their perks.
---
I made a joke about 3 people spending their lives on dbd subreddit, refering to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/akbiq3/rdeadbydaylight_starter_pack/). saiiyu then went full oldschool tyler1 on me with insult and calling me a pedohile. Some fine it savage, I find it repugnant.
---
Did the Wraith sneak around the Gargoyles without killing them ? 
---
Just do what you find to be the most fun. It sounds like you’re playing pretty non toxic, so ignore trash talking survivors. 
---
He may play on console.  I play on ps4 and even at rank 1 I'd say 25% facecamp, 45% proxy camp.  It's pretty bad man
---
get metter at map pressure maybe?
---
ofc this smart, doesn’t make it a less a camp does it? 
---
FUCK ERROR CODE 8014 WHY CANT I CONNECT TO THE SERVER FFSSSSSSS
---
You just need 1 or 2 gens with Dying Light. It's a 25% decreased action speed. Thats a lot.
---
either 1-2 hours
---
or 4
---
My normal match is against rank 12 survivors, I’m a rank 1 killer
---
Absolutely not that survivor was a potato that murdered his entire team.  Survivors that run to pallets and wait for the killer and don't loop them count as an additional killer 
---
Thats my Lisa! good job girl!
---
Ok so I rarely if ever use DS just bcuz i hate crutch perks like that with a passion, but after coming up against 4 Billies in a row, i got a little ticked off and decided to be sweaty for a bit. Idk if DS got a nerf recently but I’m pretty sure i hit the skill check, I’m genuinely confused on what happened here. 
---
40 more minutes
---
I don't have much time to play, so for me the grind is way too much, and I feel thats the general feeling in the community. I'm not saying get rid of the grind, just ease it a little bit.
---
That is your opinion.
---
Also before i get downvoted by all the killer mains here, i play killer &amp; survivor equally, i don’t main either side. 
---
shhhhhhhh. 
---
One thing I learned when starting killer was if I’m being looped for about a minute without hitting the survivor once I break off the chase to look for someone else. I rather save them for last then get gen rushes because I got so focused on chasing one person. 
---
I HATE WHEN I KILL THE SURVIVORS TOO FAST AND I WANT TO GIVE THE LAST ONE HATCH BUT THE HATCH HASN'T EVEN SPAWNED. I HAD TO LEAD A SURVIVOR TO TWO GENERATORS AND THEN FIND THE HATCH FOR THEM.
---
ahahahahaha! I play Feng alot too. :') I felt bad.
---
it was kinda bad manners to sprint burst ahead of her to do the uncool... but for her to loud vault and then dc? What a toxic idiot - your team was probably better off without her
---
lmfao. get off your high horse. ive known every perk for many hours now. i just didnt give a fuck about the perks people dont even use. like blood warden. i managed to get to rank 1 a billion times and met a few freddys during that time. i did fine even without knowing what a perk they didnt even have can do
---
Noo it was listed clearly my the Devs what is reportable and what isn't. Slugging was listed directly as not reportable. You disconnecting and being toxic in game chat is. 
---
Whats that shit?
---
Fire up
---
Distressing AND monitor and abuse without a terror radius perk as leatherface. The only good thing he has is the Barnecue &amp; Chili
---
Nurse is the best killer in the game and she's not that hard to master, just muscle memory with the blinks. If you want a high skill ceiling try Spirit or Huntress.
---
&gt; but I'm running BBQ and Chili and I can tell that multiple survivors are nearby when I'm hooking somebody.
---
I would caution you against assuming not seeing auras means someone is nearby. My games always have Distortion now and ofc they can hop into a locker real quick for a few seconds in addition to the older method of hiding behind gen auras 
---
I absolutely loathe survivors that waste pallets.  I played a Laurie yesterday that I found in seconds and in 15 seconds she tossed 3 pallets.  I killer her off quick so the rest of her team would at least have a shot against me.  Didn't work still 4k'd but I tried to make it a game for the other 3.
---
No this was completely expected. It's literally a 3 comment chain
---
Adept Legion achievement denied.
---
I HATE WHEN I TRY TO GIVE DADDY MYERS SOME LOVE AND THEN HE JUST HOOKS ME :(
---
An idea to balance it would maybe be that the survivor had to do an action, maybe similar in length to cleansing a (thrill of the hunt) totem to reopen the hatch.
---
Just because slugging isn't reportable doesn't make it not a dick move
---
Also, with the offerings awarding bonus bp you should get those prestiges in no time. 
---
Hey dumbass, on an Ardetha video on ochido, noob3 had a comment basically explaining how he used to be good friends with him, but at some point, his mannerisms and the controversy around his pedophilia caused noob3 to retract from that friendship. Learn the facts before you act so high and mighty
---
He's very specific tho
---
Trying to help your boosted ass out but lash out if you want lol.  People use blood warden btw 
---
Thanks for the advice, I'm still fairly inexperienced and I know I occasionally miss the auras, particularly if they're standing still behind a generator.
---
Finally a rational person that plays DBD! Since as long as i can remember I have always played videogames the way I had fun doing and will continue to do so.
---
Need round is on me good sir!
---
This sub is mostly survivor mains and awful for killer advice
---
anyway, that's a good build. personally i'm not into meta builds and ruin so i think i would replace thana (which also isn't very great) and ruin with third seal and remember me
---
more fun imo
---
35 minutes
---
r/cursedimages
---
My rank is pretty low still, so the survivors tend to be stupid!  
---
When in cest time at 2 doesnt help
---
The person currently on the hook ended up suiciding on second phase, I looped the killer for the last 2 gens and got sniped because of bad hitboxes (it definitely shouldve went over me) and the last survivor looked at huntress winding up a hatchet as he was opening the door, injured and got sniped. I was more disappointed in my team then salty.
---
I felt terrible when she dc'ed though. I just want the "jump off the hook 50 times" achievement so I can go back to playing killer.
---
55.44m
---
If you breath survivors and killers will desire for your whole family to die anyway, so just play the way is most fun to you. Don't facecamp and conciouwly tunnel, thats pretty much it.
---
Your best bet would be testing out all the killers and seeing which one is best for you. The Trapper and the Huntress would be good for starters since they are both easy to play, 
---
The Clown?
---
Devs did a pretty good job so far. At least we agree on that.   
---
You call a disconnect on purpose after 20+ minutes in the game toxic and defend someone who wrote:" fuck you sonofabitch" and " go suck a jewish dick you shitretarded cuntchild". Interesting opinion. Doesn't add up for me.
---
GG EZ, amirite?
---
Or you know, just don't bully other players as a rule, not the exception?
---
UwU OwO TwT QwQ 
---
I see what you're saying but I also don't want to be an ass  and make it so I'm the only having fun, but people get upset when I'm just playing the game and making what I think the best moves are! 
---
There seem to be a ton of made up survivor rules and occasionally threats of reports for not respecting them, so I wanted the larger community's opinion on what they thought a killer should be doing!
---
At the end of the day, if the game isn't fun, I'm not going to play it though. 
---
Legion isn't even some insurmountable presence.
---
And corn is bad. You're being disingenuous otherwise. It doesn't just make it harder to see survivors (it would be fine if that was all), it actually fucks with your frame rate. That's a problem.
---
Camping to level up killer btw
---
pReTtY gOoD jOb So FaR
---
who is the girl with red hair? 
---
I think, uh, I think that could've been me at some point 
---
Had a Killer that was called totem keeper. At the start of the game he went to his Hex: Ruin totem and stood a good 10 feet away staring at it. It was Billy and whenever we would get closer to it he would rev his chainsaw until we would start cleansing it then he would down us. Not kill us though, just go back to his same spot and watch his totem. We finished all the gens and escaped . After he messaged us in a group (PS4)  “don’t touch my shit” (Rank 4 killer) 
---
Prestiging makes the bloodweb drop better rarity items addons and offerings. I got myself every survivor to level 40 and then maxed dwight (i consider maxing getting every perk of the game to tier 3 in that character. But now that i know that prestiging has a little advantaje to no prestige. I'll make feng min prestige 3 and max her. And that should make the ultimate survivor. About killers is different. I'll probably prestige only the ones that i need higher rarity add ons. For example i don't see why i would prestige hillbilly. He only has 2 very rare addons that arent that big of a deal. But then you have spirit, doctor, legion. Where addons affect a lot how you play them. And i think those killers do deserve the prestige. I totally don't care about the cosmetics, i only do it for the practicality of it.
---
Sounds like death.
---
I did this by myself a while back and I basically took a shot every time I did something cool, stupid, for winning or losing. I was a wreck the next day lmao
---
Hey that’s pretty similar to my build! I always run WGLF and balance landing, and but usually use Empathy and we’ll make it. I used to always run self care but realized pretty quickly I find the game a lot more fun without it. Makes survivor a bit more of a challenge. 
---
Enjoying my hook, you?
---
Thanks for the advice, I see how that could apply more pressure than staying on the hook!
---
Remember me is great on Myers.  Honestly it's strong on most killers but especially on imposing 1 shot killers like Billy and Myers.  Blood warden is more of a fun perk to run.  When it triggers it's pretty hilarious for both survivor and killer I feel.  It also got buffed now that swf can't tell each other perks upon death.
---
*when NOED kicks in*
---
Just look if the perk icon lights up. That means a survivor is in a 32 m range.
---
Game Crash is so apt. 
---
&gt; and why third seal ?
---
Legion can apply it pretty quickly early on.
---
As an aside, Prove Thyself doesn't do much. If you played before the patch that buffed it, then you were playing harder games than with what Prove Thyself does now
---
I remembered me today water plant hahaha
---
That was disproved
---
I’m not sure if it’s my luck but I NEED self care because my teammates are always braindead. I have WGLF and We’ll make it because they go hand in hand. And I have balanced landing because...
---
The bloodweb is a bitch and doesn’t want to give me lithe.
---
I’m ashamed at what I expected and how fast I clicked expecting it

Just got p2 Quentin last night. Can't wait for p3 :))
---
For perks, I run Ruin BBQ Make your choice and nurses calling.
---
 you can change make your choice to devour hope also, but it could be found easily.
---
For addons I try to play without addons for muscle memory. otherwise your strongest addons is maximum range addons, as it gives you increased charge speed for the addon also.
---
Hope this helps
---
Nice going.
---
I find that when I'm slugged and the last survivor up is near the hatch my ethernet cable gets loose and I accidently D/C. 
---
It's unfortunate but at least someone else escapes.
---
works great for me and my friends 
---
Gunna have to disagree with you there. Huntress is by no means easy to play, as she has one of the highest skill caps in the game. Trapper on the other hand isa  good beginner killer.
---
OP I would recommend you start with a basic M1 killer to start with, like trapper, wraith, myers, or billy. Nurse has such a high skill cap that you should learn the basic mechanics of a killer first, but of course, it's completely up to you!
---
Haha yeah if i’m having a particularly bad day with shitty teammates I’ll run self care, but like 70% of the time i play it’s with friends so having self care isn’t really needed. 
---
Some people are but not me
---
I'm sure google has the answer
---
What is this thing you call... *friends?*
---
i honestly think no0b is a good person, he lied to his fans in the past which was a horrible thing. but he seems to have his shit together! he is not toxic like ochido is, seems like a good guy
---
&gt;This is taking the game hostage, even if the killer may eventually find the survivor after a great deal of time the intent is to force the other player to disconnect in order to end the game, which does qualify as an attempt to take the game hostage.
---
No it isn't. There's literally a build called "Hostage Doctor" where they prevent Survivors from doing 3 gens for as long as he possibly can. He does not chase, just protect 3 gens. This is not bannable even though it's incredible scummy. The Killer is not working towards his goal of killing Survivors, just preventing an escape. Just like how a pure stealth Claudette isn't escaping, just preventing their death.
---
Taking a game hostage *must* mean that the opposing side *CAN NOT* end the game at all. In this case of full immersion the Survivor is not preventing a game to end, just merely delaying it as much as possible, just like hostage doc.
---
I saw this and I was just think STOP TRYING TO GIVE KILLERS GUNS then I kept reading and my first thought was ok this one can have a gun
---
Sexy time has begun 
---
Because it was hilarious hiding in the basement for 30+ minutes making the killer rage 
---
BBQ Make Your Choice Nurses Shadowborn
---
I think thats lana rhoades, i dont know the exact video
---
Basically you lose if you get 0 or 1 kill, it's a tie if you get 2 kills and you win if you get 3 or 4 kills. You shouldn't care about pips, ll it does is place you with people who have played enough to be able to be in a rank, it's not a true measure of how good you are doing
---
BECAUSE FACE CAMPING RARELY HAPPENS. THERE IS DATA THAT PROVES IT
---
Great game. Nothing wrong with it.
---
Jeff already? Will they be your first?
---
 And thanks!
---
am guessing nea is the legion extra
---
r/woooosh
---
Nah dude, how else can I make my e-peen grow than by bullying other people trying to enjoy themselves? 
---
Here’s hoping ! I might focus on feng min because of that new outfit. The one from last year already makes her a bright red target but it’s so pretty like this years. 
---
i simply didnt care about an irrelevant perk. it aint that deep bro
---
I really did try to move around the map as much as possible. Thanks for the advice though, I'll still try as best as I can.
---
If its that bad i might need to change it up a bit.
---
Grind on! Quentin has the best P3 face imo. He was my 4th survivor I got to P3-50.
---
&gt; OP I would recommend you start with a basic M1 killer to start with, like trapper, wraith, myers, or billy.
---
Agreed, but OP should also begin learning Huntress before they start playing with experienced survivors.
---
I just found out it was today as well. 2 PM so roughly an hour!!
---
Slugging is holding a game hostage albeit a game acceptable version of that and completely within rules of game.  That killer is choosing to drag out the survivors "play time" ie leaving them to lie on the ground.  The survivor has no option to end the game in this scenario without disconnecting.  Devs were clearly targeting the survivors that dc early in game and screw over teammates with that rule.  Your twisting it to justify simply dealing with a toxic drawn out slug fest.  The survivor has a right to end the game at that point 
---
Let’s let the audience sing along! *Cue hook screams*
---
That's more terrifying than him chasing you tbh... 
---
Oh ok! You had me worried. I was super excited yesterday I was anxious. Would’ve been disappointing to find out I misheard the devs lol.
---
Please commit toaster bath if you run ruin on nurse
---
what?
---
I GOT FACECAMPED FOR 3 GENS OVER A FAILED BLIND, HOW TRASH DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO CAMP SOMEONE OVER SOMETHING THEY FAILED TO DO?
---
10mins left :D
---
YES THATS MY BUILD TOO 😩👌👏
---
I love you 
---
prestige jeff face looks like fat kratos btw
---
*Mike-riah doesn't care and still dances to it* Ugh, cut the track.
---
Take a hint. No one wants to play with Legion.
---
i get it cause billy is a trash killer
---
He means Bloody Party Streamers they give 100% extra for everyone and stack with double bp
---
almost didnt get this one because right when i opened a hatch, someone got caught in a bear trap about 20 feet away and i had to get them out of it before jumping in. we all still ended up getting it on our first attempt at going for it though, so i'm not gonna complain too much about it.
---
Nurse's Calling, Hex:Ruin, BBQ &amp; Chili, NOED
---
Feng was my first P3 all perks survivor too! I literally got into the game because I saw Spark of Madness DLC on Steam front page. Qunetin was my 2nd. I'm almost done with Claud. Not sure if I wanna do Jeff or Adam next :0
---
You are what's wrong with this game. 
---
I'd give it a go and adjust from there, honestly. It kinda depends on your rank/teammates.
---
I don't understand whats wrong with ruin on nurse.
---
Perk: Shinderu: 
---
    If a survivor would stun you with a pallet you instead appear behind them and immediately strike them. You become stunned for 3/2/1 seconds afterward. 
---
Ohh yeah I thought BPS meant Bloodpoints, I get it now.
---
Nice edit (:, what's the name of the song you used?
---
I don't see people using jojo references very often in a sub dedicated to a game therefore making it unexpected
---
easy to re-try when i can start it 6 times in under a minute
---
U wot m8
---
Stay at google then, and don't litter this subreddit with your nonsensical comments.
---
I agree with this
---
funny story, i realized after i shouldve put nea in the back urban evasioning or something.
---
she's already fucking op, 100% offense, no defense and you're running fucking ruin on her. she doesn't need it at all. you're actually fucking garbage if you need ruin on the most op killer in the game
---
Change his power to slowly filling the map up in snot. After it gets to the knees everyone cant move. Then it drowns them.
---
That wraith with his finger in the bowl trying to get some Bubbas chili is my favorite part
---
me too
---
Obligatory reminder that this can be gotten when you're playing killer too. Very easy to get if you ask survs to farm and someone brings a key. 
---
I just finished Jeff like a week ago! Love him cause he's Canadian like me and lived an hour away from where I currently live! 
---
Legion is definitely not good. He’s just annoying af to play against and ruins the experience. I’m a killer main, for some reason I don’t find coldwind difficult. Actually like it better than maps like Macmillan estate that have good infinites or haddonfield for obvious reasons

I failed

shit happens. haha

Oh I love this! What a fun game to play in between playing the game. 
---
isnt billy for people who cant play nurse like the rest of us?
---
Nice! Jeff seems like a friendly dude to me. One of my favorite characters
---
I would agree with you if he was slugging the last survivor to just let them bleed out to just be a asshole I guess but he had a teammate to revive him. All he was trying to do was prevent the last survivor from getting hatch likely for a achievement and they robbed him of it by disconnecting. 
---
Enjoy your ban
---
LOL
---
Was it Basement Protector? I love that guy!
---
The killers victory screen is based on pips.  Pips are earned by gaining emblems, which are divided into 4 categories.  This means the goal for killer is to perform the best possible in all 4 categories.  The first emblem is Gatekeeper, which is slowing down generator progress.  The second emblem is Malicious, which is hitting survivors and getting them to new hook stages.  The third emblem is Chaser, which is for finding survivors, hitting them and having short chases that end in a hit.  The last emblem is Devout, which is for sacrificing and killing.
---
Each of the 4 categories is important, and my personal goal is to try to maximize bloodpoint gain while keeping those categories in mind.  In regards to both pips and bloodpoints, the more hits/hooks/chases you get the better, while actually fully sacrificing survivors somewhat inconsequential.  It may even be possible to double pip without getting a single kill, I have been one emblem point shy of it in the past and I'm not sure I had the full 8 hooks/possibly only gold Gatekeeper.  Don't get me wrong, killing survivors is good too and worth going for, but it's not always that high of a priority as far as a killers objectives go.
---
Seems like a joke, but it could work with some tweaks to sneezing, stumbling and just be without the hook bit. That part is kinda stupid, considering no one would take that tradeoff of saving the killer. Besides, sneezing on hook=instadeath? That part seems finicky. Otherwise, this is actually a surprisingly nice idea
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, Whispers, Nurse's Calling, and Shadowborn
---
Can't tell if serious or unaware that things called consoles exist
---
Yep, Moonrise Event starts very soon, so looks like they're preparing for launch.
---
^^^ Or if you have problem locating people switch make your choice for bitter murmur, though it’s bugged right now.
---
Those 2 are he most optimal nurse builds.
---
lmao its a joke
---
Hex gets found should be Hex found before 1 hook
---
Thanks! I was worried for a minute and thought my game was messed up
---
Can we scrach them all 
---
I even tried that too. I made sure I didn't take too long on chases and tried to damage as many generators as possible. I guess everybody was really fast and stealthy and just got to work on one again the second I damaged it.

Fun story time, my friend and I we're playing against a spirit and the other two survivor's we're killed and we only have 2 gennys done. We both found a lit totem and for shits and giggles we agreed to clense them both as the same time so we wouldn't know who was responsible for haunted grounds activating.
---
Of course it did activate but we stayed hidden the whole time and were able to sneak around the spirit for the rest of the game and get the last 3 gens fixed and escape with only getting spotted once or twice.
---
My friend Dylan and I played against a Leatherface once, who did nothing but stand in place and swing all game. Of course, like the idiots we were we kept running in front of his hammer. 
---
So fast forward to the end of the game, all the gens were done and Dylan wanted some more points. He stood infront of the inactive leatherface and let him down him. 
---
I had An exit open and was waiting there for him.  He wanted me to come get him up, so i went and as I got to him I realized leatherface had started moving. 
---
Now, I never scream or get really scared when playing DBD. But i let out the most God-awful shriek. And before i could get more than a few steps away I got morried. Our teammates left and Leatherface carried Dylan to the exit and let him go. :/
---
One good thing about the console version is Spark of Madness came with the base game, so Feng was my main from the start. Technician was a godsend against all the doctors in low ranks lmao. Good luck with Claudette, she's my next one to get all perks unlocked on too! I'd say Adam.
---
I should’ve put it the free space. ;)
---
NOED on nurse? Yikes.
---
Xbox seems to be having issues right now. A lot of people (myself included) are just getting a black screen on start up.
---
I’m so happy you like it :)

uuuuuuuuh no, the majority of them are extremely forced and unfunny 
---
Sure,
---
watch out that you don't overhydrate.
---
haha i like macmillan.
---
and gee i enjoy playing against Legion, actually. people overstate how annoying it is imo
---
What new matchmaking? Are they saying they are improving it?
---
I'm an rp-ing huntress tbh. Sometimes I'll get matched with some cute survivors, (or if im deranking) and I'll just hang out with them. Show em where my totem is, lead em to gens, etc. My favourite part is when they play along, because it usually ends with all the survivors crouch-circling me once the gates are open.
---
Bunny momma :)
---
(Breaking totems without permission is a no-no though. Same with flashlighting without permission. Punishments will administered accordingly. Momma don't take no bullshit.)
---
sounds like a holiday to me
---
haha you are such a beta
---
Wraith really wants that Chilli doesn't he? Eat up, Philip, gotta get meat on those skinny legs of yours.
---
The level of disrespect for my boi
---
First match, first event offering, first killer dc/crash. Very nice.
---
lmfao okay loser
---
aw man, I hated those fireworks from the Lunar Event.  Ugh
---
Haha, I do this as Trapper when I want to derank. I go smack a gen until someone works on it, then stand there and watch. If they fail a skill check I shake my head at them, hit them, kick the gen, then smack it again to tell them to get back to work, lol. Also always run Overcharge when I'm playing Gen Repair Supervisor.
---
10/10 reference
---
Perfect survivor games aren’t easy, congrats man!
---
Well they don’t, killers standing at the hatch cause hatch stand offs
---
Serious question, why do the majority of people on this sub hate the fireworks? I’ve got just over 100 stocked up from the last event and find they’re pretty useful (I suck at flashlight saves). 
---
On the office Xbox website (https://support.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-live-status) it says that the issue is on there end
---
He lied about his ban, caused a massive scene. People we’re harassing the devs ect. He manned up though 
---
I hate my life more everyday
---
This happened to me once too, and in the post-game chat he said "Waste my time, I'll waste yours". I was playing very normally and not camping anyone too. That was the last time I didn't run whispers, never again.
---
Fireworks in the main menu and lobbies
---
I had someone accuse me of this but I had a key and was looking for the hatch on swamp against nurse when the hatch wasn't open just spawned so just something they reported me and when they downed me they tried to let me bleed out I dcd didn't want to let the timer go
---
Pretty much my first event so I hope it goes well.
---
Ah I see, my misunderstanding
---
OH MY FUCKING GOD. EXACTLY. I TRY TO BE SO FUCKING NICE BC IM A SURVIVOR MAIN. 
---
MY FRIEND SAYS I SHOULD JUST HAVE NO MERCY. I NEVER GO FOR THE UNHOOKED SURVIVOR, NEVER CAMP, LET PEOPLE TAKE HATCHES, ETCETC. I SAY GG AND GL ON YOUR NEXT GAME AND THEYRE JUST LIKE “TUNNELING GAME ON POINT.” IM LIKE BITCH???? YOURE JUST BAD. YOU LITERALLY RUN INTO ME LIKE??? HOW CAN I HELP IT IF U HAVE NO GAME SENSE. BITCH ASS SURVIVORS. 
---
I FEEL YOU.  
---
those are fine, its the fireworks in the main menu
---
I just saw someone aggressively complaining about ruin in nurse. Well i do think it is unnecessary too but im gonna stay more calm than that guy
---
Ruin in nurse isn’t necessary because she already has a lot of map precense
---
Taking a game hostage is to bring the game to a complete standstill in an attempt to force to your opponent to disconnect in order to end to end the match. The whole point of hostage doc is that he takes the game hostage, it’s in the name. I don’t know any other way to put it either than I straight up disagree that only through the use of exploits or bodyblocking can a game be held hostage. 
---
A hostage is a person being held captive against their will, and even though they will often be freed or killed eventually, they were still held hostage. There are ways in dbd like bodyblocking or glitch spots where you can 100% prevent the opponent from ending the game, but the prospect of hostage doc or hiding indefinitely is that you are trying to hold your opponent in the match for as long as you possibly can against their will, and just because your opponent has a minuscule chance of success does not make it any less of an attempt to take the game hostage.
---
I never noticed this detail. 
---
If I had to guess, Distressing applies before other perks, so 8m, +8m from Calm CN, +4m from Calm II, so approximately +20m, on a 32 default tr, would be about 52m in treatment mode.
---
Alternatively you could also play stealth Doctor, since Calm also reduces tr while in Punishment mode, which would be 32-12-8 from M&amp;A or a total of 12m. If you run around in Punishment mode and only switch to Treatment mode to shock survivors after a chase already happens, you can really get the drop on people. Similar to a tier 2 Myers who can shock people before they go through windows.
---
What's more incredible is that the last survivor didn't escape in that time
---
Ruin isnt really necessary because nurse already has a lot of pressue but its still a good build
---

you're kidding right? i see jojo references in every single fucking sub i go to
---
unexpected jojo has to be one of the most pointless subreddits ive ever seen because people constantly make the same 5 references to that anime everywhere they go like a plague
---
\&gt;Both Ruin and NOED are yikes, together they become turboyikes
---
Xbox live would be having issues right now 😔
---
I had a Leatherface do the same type of thing, but for the basement protecting the chest down there. I messaged him after (xbox) and he said "no one touches my treasures!"
---
No.
---
This may force the to crouch up to that gen, but they would anyways against a hag, this type of trap placement will not work against good players and is actually redundant and a waste of traps.
---
You just can't win
---
FUCK THAT!
---
im gonna sit here and talk about how wrong this meme is!!!!
---
Perhaps it's a noob who doesn't know how those things work? Maybe it's still wholesome?
---
Bad this recently on PS4. I ignored the botter, don't trust them and find it boring. So I did the gens, broke a few totems, etc. I popped the last gen, ran for the exit, and suddenly BAM. No One Escapes Death. 1 down, 2 down, three down. I got the gate open and left. Spectated and he hooked all three. He'd had NOED, BBQ, and STBFL. Couldn't stop laughing for a good minute.
---
Might get shadow born. I love the fov increase on wraith, but I hate wraith. Hell, zubatlel uses an entire perk slot on it sometimes on nurse
---
Look at the icon, if it's dark it isn't active, if it lights up it is. RM and BW are both unreliable, fun to use but not very good
---
#fireworksmatter
---
Yea seems to be the case
---
Your job is to get as many kills as you can and of course have fun. At the end of the day the survivors have the complete opposite objective to survive while having fun. Neither side is supposed to care about the opposite side’s objective or fun but each side acts like it is the opposite sides job to play optimally for them. 
---
Survivors don’t like to be tunneled and that’s for fairly obvious reason, but killers don’t like gens to be done at lightning fast speeds and the easiest counter to that is to get people out the game as fast as possible. Now there’s a discussion there to be had about map pressure but unless you’re using top tier killers like nurse or billy every game you’re going to lack more in that aspect. 
---
At the end of the day this is just a game that is designed to make the “losing” side feel shitty and when you feel shitty you’re going to spew salt all over the post game chat. You are not obligated to make others feel less shitty and you are not obligated to follow made up rules. If people are mad at the way you played the game, tough luck. So long as you are not cheating in any way you kicked their ass and they’re mad about it, end of story. 
---
Is the counter bugged on PS4 again? Just escaped with a vessel and got no progress on my meter?
---
Thank you good sir.

Fun if you dont use Frank's or simply dont care about kills. Balanced? I can wholeheartedly agree on. It's quite a mess
---
No progress with a vessel or gens done on pc
---
Disconnecting isnt reportable either. BHVR already keeps track of it
---

20 *bang*

Yep :) I have others prestiged but I don’t really care for them lol. I’m not a fan of the prestige cosmetics tbh, but I do like making my faves OP lol
---
I know right? Damn black screen of death. I thought my xbox one x was done for until I saw everyone else with the same problem
---
They are supposedly going to be doing improvements over time, but the more recent one is supposed to be coming out soonish according to what BHVR has said.
---
🤣🤣
---
“feng min is a grotsky little byotch”
---
Same for me on PS4.
---
You get 12 hooks per game, but only 5 gens. 
---
Ya gotta escape and that itself is a challenge when you have idiot teammates. But killers should get like 1 point more for hooking tbh 
---
Haven’t had that error, but lots of people are having a glitch where the progress bar doesn’t move no matter how many hooks or lanterns you get
---
I only ever do killer for dailies so as long as its not a mori or sacrifice daily I only ever 2 hook people. This leads to some fun times after I'm done with my daily depending on what killer I'm playing. With Myers I'll plug in my controller and slowly tilt forward on the stick while stalking or moonwalk or edge around corners. With Wraith I like to go invisible and then stand completely still in front of the exit gate lever. This usually confuses the hell out of people because if you're completely still on Wraith while invis you are actually completely invis. I usually start to uncloak after a bit and it scares them. With Pig I like to sulk around the map while crouched and spam the dash meter until its about 60% full and then let go. Doing this you can spam her "roar" sound. With LF I'll hit my DPI switch to maximum and then use my chainsaw while throwing my mouse across my desk.
---
I actually decided that it doesnt count beforehand, still thanks for the reminder
---
good job so far
---
In my game it says 4 for gen and 20 for escape wirh vessel, and for killer 1 for hook 3 for destroying vessel
---
But it's so satisfying when you tap a gen with overcharge and hit it while running away from a bing bong.
---
I destroyed 3 vessels and killed everyone and got no points too (bp was nice tho)
---
If I hit you with no perks it takes me a little more than three seconds to recover. If I hit you three times that’s more than ten seconds which is one of the faster recorded gen completion times with multiple people. Now that probably won’t get done that fast, but if you have 3 allies all doing different gens that ten seconds is enough for them to get halfway, and by the time I recover and leave then finally get to the next gen and find someone that’s 3 gens done, especially because they probably already got stuff done while I was in chase. Hiring survivors isn’t toxic, it’s just stupid. Also I’m just saying your wording was poorly phrased and you could have taken a second to better clarify your point. Nobody is downvoted you because they’re toxic, they downvoted you because your point was stupid, and you don’t have to say something to clearly imply it the difference is just that saying it straight up, even if wrong, atleast shows some balls.

Don't assume shit. Don't be toxic to anyone. That's basic etiquette. Doesn't matter if it's a P3 nurse or a beginner.
---
Same..
---
Eeeeh I’d be surprised, my guess is most pregame DCs happen beyond people’s control. It happens once a night when my friends and I play, sometimes more for me if the weather is bed, or if someone has a really old PC. 
---
This is why I just Gen Jockey. Looping for a long time does not correlate to escaping. I will only have the killer chase me if I already did a gen, unhooked, and healed someone.
---
_I exploited the prestige glitch to get my characters to p3_
---
Why would they hold it in when they can anonymously yell at strangers online?
---
EST so actually it is live right now!
---
I kill the person immediately and if they get hatch who cares you know. 
---
Look in the mirror. OwO
---
I think that's the joke
---
Do you mean the moon thing isn’t filling up with your points? Because the same things just happened to me. But tbh I kinda expected something to be buggy. Though I’m going to be optimistic and hope it’s just on a delay coz the events only just started.
---
I escaped with lanterns twice, no points
---
Is this a copy and paste from previous events?

---
No double BP but you get extra bloodpoints for taking a vessel and holding it for x amount of time! 
---
Not working on survivor side either
---
&gt;I straight up disagree that only through the use of exploits or bodyblocking can a game be held hostage.
---
Doesn't matter whether you agree or not, it's how the devs define "taking a game hostage."
---
&gt;A hostage is a person being held captive against their will, and even though they will often be freed or killed eventually, they were still held hostage.
---
So if I get facecamped the Killer is taking the game hostage to me? Or if I wait at the exit gate as Survivor I'm holding the game hostage? If a Killer lets a Survivor bleed out in dying state is that holding the game hostage? No. The amount of time is important. There's a huge difference between holding a game for a literal infinite amount of time (unless one party DC's or the other stops holding it hostage) and just stalling the game out.
---
There's a reason why so few actions in this game are actually bannable. It's to stop gameplay abuse to make games literally unplayable. The Killer can still end the game, it's just hard to do so. There is no argument.
---
If you want to directly ask the devs they'll tell you the same thing: https://support.deadbydaylight.com/hc/en-us
---
Make a ticket and ask them.
---
Same
---
That’s why whispers is key. 
---
event is bugged behaviur is investigating the issue right now

did a killer game and got 0 points at all, i hooked a lot of survivors tho but had no clue how to destroy those things.
---
30 minutes in and we get a post like this.
---
This isn’t even judging a book by its cover. At this point, this is judging a book by the country the store selling the book is located in.
---
I managed to survive and I didn't get anything either. :S
---
Same thing with me, as survivor I escaped with a vessel and did 3 gens. I got nothing rip 
---
same here
---
Who woulda guess that they managed to fail on event release, progress isn't saved.

Whats in the envelopes for killers? This is my first event, i heard envelopes have firecrackers for survivors.
---
same here, pc aswell?
---
The Howling Grounds/BBQ event were actually fun. The Hallowed Blight one was painful, but I still played. This? This is just fucking straight up trash that has been manifesting in an infected humid cesspool for months.
---
And you cant even get a "oh okey lets farm together" mentality so its not even a fun shitshow.
---
PS: points are not even working rn
---
Yeah, having the same problem. 2 games so far, no points. On PC. 
---
yeah mostly gen reward seems high. I in no way want survi to have less just killer get more
---
Yeah this event is terrible. If someone has a vessel and a gate open they will absolutely not come back to help anyone else. Not only that but you get squat for bloodpoints even if you hold a vessel all match and escape. I was looking forward to it but after one match I'm not even really interested.
---
The Devs mentioned on twitter that they're aware of the issue and are currently looking into it right now.
---
Nope, did 2 gens, got no points
---
The point of the post isn't complaining about keeping the survivors in the game, the point is that, again, killer is unrewarding to play.
---
I demand more killers doing peaceful things! This pic is **COMFY**!
---
Can we complain yet? Moonrise lag camp fest 5000! 
---
THE EVENT JUST STARTED AND IT'S ALREADY BUGGED.
---
AN ESCAPE AND A DEATH AFTER 3 GENS GET DONE BUT IM 0/100 WITH 0 COINS

---
Already I've ran into people that grab a lantern and then hide for the rest of the match... don't be a shit lord people.
---
Were the auras of the lanterns showing up for you or did you have to search the map for them? I just played on Family Residence and none of the auras of them showed so I could only break 2.
---
No progression
---
Same here, pc.
---
It's called a joke
---
I was a rank 13 killer and I deranked to 16 for a while? I'm rank 11 now though.
---
I am not getting my points for any generators repaired...
---
BT varies wildly from completely useless to downright necessary. I always try to have it on Deliverance builds at least, but some killers are too good at camping without being in terror radius during the unhook. 
---
Please. Tell me how this event is fun in any way.
---
There's not even the 'Oh! Let's work together to complete the Lunar/BBQ gens and get the Lunar/BBQ hooks so that we can all have fun!'
---
envelopes only spawn more event objective :lanterns
---
firecrackers appear in the bloodweb like normal items 
---
Same, pc as well
---
Dude this same thing happened to me, and yes it was a claudette too. She just fuckin hid for 10 minutes until I found and hit her and then she made a beeline for the hatch and got out. 
---
The worst part was that I had spared her life earlier in the game (she was in a locker and I smacked it then let her get out) and I was trying to give her the damn hatch. This was at rank 15 though so shitty Claudettes are everywhere. 
---
Was hoping for more decoration, maybe lantern on the main menu.  But I guess just fireworks this time around.
---
Counter is broken on multiple platforms.
---
lmao him not cloaking is rare and dumb, like if you're gonna farm make it smart, facecamp and wait for other survivors

Use ruin

Yeah, apparently there's an issue that makes it so you don't even gain the points. Behaviour really fucked it up with this one. 
---
Yeah! I'm pretty sure everyone has this bug across all platforms. They just need to fix it asap! I was so hyped for the event but now I'm a little disappointed... 
---
Yep its broken.
---
The menu music is really lovely I like it a lot
---
I should've gotten 45 points from that single match.
---
Yeah but I had p3 characters before the levels came out so does that mean my save file is hacked? You can't tell unless the date they bought it is after the update. 
---
THIS LITERALLY JUST HAPPENED
---
2 of my teammates were downed but I had a vessel
---
I really wanted to go back for them but I didn't. I escaped only to find out that points are bugged :,)
---
Oh thanks
---
Yea, I’m not even going to bother trying to convince you. You’ll disagree no matter what.
---
Prestige bruh
---
Event still buggy on PC = FUN ! 
---
Same. We did all 5 gens and I escaped with a lantern and got 0 points smh
---
Assuming they didn't fuck up for the last event too
---
What is this? Ah, my ears appear to be having an orgasm. 
---
yup, mee too
---
As far as maps go game swamp and lerys should be chug all remaining alcohol in the room and die so you don’t have to play those godawful maps
---
I wouldn't use any envelopes until this is ironed out. 
---
The coin progress circle doesn't work for me on steam. I've done a bunch of gens. Still just have a loading wheel in that area. 
---
Same here I guess we’ve just got to hope that it’s still somehow keeping track of our progress so or time isn’t wasted while playing the event. 
---
...... awesome 🙄
---
Almost done with Nea for me!
---
Same here. Progress is bugged.
---
auras of the lanterns were not showing, you have to search them, wich means hillbilly,nurse and spirit can do that while others are fucked because it only works when you have someone on hook.
---
PS4 reporting in.
---
Don't try to tell me the event isn't shit if you can't even think of a reason why it isn't
---
Shoud've hooked claudette and the other dude then let him bleed on the ground until they're done.
---
This happened last event and back then it counted but wouldnt show
---
excuse me, what the fuck am i supposed to give you feedback for?
---
you literally played the game like pretty much everyone does.
---
there's no content there to give feedback for, you fucking moron.
---
But what else am I supposed to do with this flashlight??? /s
---
AHHHH NOOOO XD
---
I control+F'ed the word stupid and you are the only person until my post to have used it. Nobody is insulting the developers we dislike the event, and for good reason.
---
The positive community spirit was actually refreshing and fun. Not farming, but the overall friendliness and the fact that the main objective was still the same so gameplay wasn't affected
---
"Not Today"
---
"In public matches, unhook yourself 50 times"

Which is why I have deliverance

Queued as survivor - 5 mins I didnt get a lobby.

Thank you BHVR, very cool!

How many gens were left? One? Negligible difference. What rank was this killer at?
---
good job, you have wasted your time playing a game, im really proud of you

This is by far the most adorable dbd fanart I have ever seen! Well, as far as sfw goes that is.

Lol...

yeah as survivors i escaped with vessel  and did not get any points for  gens too

And it's broken what a suprise

feng mains rise up

Yeah but they gotta escape. With a vessel.

i'd like to see it!

yes he does

Last event this happened as well.  You still gained the progress but it just didn't show. Hopefully it's the same this time around.

---
Thats true 
---
Ah, gotcha, good luck on that
---
The way that you worded it made it sound like killers letting survivors get gens and survivors letting killers get hooks. While that’s all kumbiyah and all it’s boring as hell. I am playing a game with two sides competing against each other. I want to be able to sabotage the other side.
---
I’m not getting anything either. 
---
Doing gods work 
---
Could be like last year, whereby we *are making progress, it just isn't showing.
---
Yeah I agree farming for no reason is fucking boring
---
That would take the surprise and fun out of the event.  They just need to test it better.  There's no excuse for this counter issue as it happened last event as well. 
---
They were very quiet indeed
---
Hmm. So experienced.
---
I would appreciate it if you could answer how many gens were left when you were hooked.
---
Is it bad I’ve watched this video..

Franklin's works while within Frenzy, so it's a really good perk, Remember Me or Save the Best for Last are really good since you can farm your stacks with ease. 
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is also really good since you can abuse your Frenzy Speed, same with Overcharge and Surveillance, but with lesser effect 
---
Other than steel curtain, this is really fucking amazing. Better than most fan made chapters I've seen
---
They killed Feng and stole her dress!!
---
Pretty good job so far!
---
Regardless of your opinion on it holding the game hostage from a rules stand point. The amount of people that seem to side with the survivor over the matter because "lol just find them" is troubling. 
---
LOLOL that funny 
---
If you look up Feng Min on r/deadbydaylight , there is a pretty popular render
---
To make people buy the cosmetics with auric cells
---
Yup they confirmed that last dev stream
---
My progress isn't counting as killer. I've checked after each match (played 2 so far). Its even worse because killers get so little to begin with.. Come on guys wtf
---
Well done!
---
Nope its not visual 
---
For some reason this happens everytime but it's usually just a visual bug
---
Lmao this reddit never ceases to amaze me. People in the comments saying to camp or tunnel if you want yet the sub is still full of posts bitching about toxic swf players. 
---
I'd rather have a working event when it's launched than care about a "surprise" that lasts all of 5seconds. Plus it ain't fun when it don't work.
---
Source?
---
Besides Freddy getting stuck in a pallet we searched this entire map and there were barely any gens, I found this last one after atleast a 5 minute search.
---
What I think might happened the lunar vessels were where a gen was supposed to spawn and didn't, someone burned a red envlope so more likely chance a gen didn't spawn. Or just a new bug with the game after the lunar new year release
---
Only reason why we won is  because he got stuck in a pallet tbh.
---
I just escaped with a lunar vessel and used an offering too 😩 I have the video saved. If I submit a ticket with the video do you think they’d help my account with  the progression when it’s fixed? 
---
I'm trying to envision what power zombie Jesus would have. Part of me thinks this would have to do with conversion. So maybe during a chase the killer can "mark" the survivor and then the next other survivor that survivor runs into gets dealt one damage and the original survivor would have their aura appear to the killer. Not sure how OP that would be 
---
Coming back to help someone is too risky especially considering the fact that killers can DC to stop you from getting it so i’m getting the fuck out as soon as possible. 
---
They intend to validate the fix later today
---
It's a good perk, but Killers disconnecting out of rage because their NOED didn't trigger is surprisingly high though.
---
Locked &amp; removed for drama.

During the pustula event I was playing multiple games as hag and I would roleplay as a grandmother who needed her garden weeded. Any pesky kids found not weeding my garden were promptly given a slap on the wrist. ( And then hung to dry ) 
---
I had it on ps4 yesterday.  All it took was closing the application and opening it again. 
---
I meant character level. Ie 50 vs 1
---
Trapper with max play with your food stacks, noed level 3, blood lust III. You could also have two stacks of devour hope after hooking someone, but the speed boost only lasts 10 seconds.

Dead by Daylight: Battle Royale
---
damn that’s fkn gay bruh 
---
update, it appears it is
---
Thanks but I’ve already closed the game and restarted it multiple times and it’s not changing anything. 
---
Sounds like you got what you deserve bu playing legion.
---
It makes me sad because it’s a fantastic game, just very shitily executed 
---
I've only been playing since the start of November, so it's definitely possible. BBQ just makes everything much easier. But yeah, especially if you don't do what I did and go like 80 perks last P3-50 to get good builds, you could get all P3-50 chars in 6 months, probably. 
---
Maybe because it's a large volume of people posting about it and BHVR already addressed it.
---
I assume it's because BHVR have already adressed it, and are working on a fix.
---
You probably faced a SABO SQUAD, check out this video, it is a legit strategy with a good SWF team 
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auUnBApAG2A](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auUnBApAG2A)
---
Maybe Survivor Jesus gets a perk where he can come back to life after being sacrificed a single time but with broken effect.
---
Not true...I saved 3 people when I had lantern before I lost it and wouldn’t you know one of my teammates called me a selfish shithead after I got hatch.
---
They fixed that.
---
This is a new bug where the entity attempt to take the last node of a web, but glitches and gets stuck. You hear the node consumption sound continuously until you restart the game.
---
Wish the huntress one looked better
---
I have the pink hair one tho and it says that's Suzie. You mean 2 Suzie's? O: 
---
You have to get to a certain level on each character to enjoy their teachable perks (is it 40?) on other characters, but otherwise, do what you want. 
---
Their thought process was once again as usual SWF vs everything else. Solo queues can bury themselves in a whole for all bhvr cares.
---
Didn’t see thanks
---
Eh... I'm sadly not too surprised with it being a little broken on launch. But I do have faith that they will fix it quick! Will most likely play some Black Ops 4 while I wait
---
Because BHVR is already aware of it and is working on a solution; plus we don't need a billion posts saying the same exact thing
---
bhvr pls
---
Only the person who brings out the vessel gets the 25 points. 
---
I have both Spirit and Legion and I 100% recommend Spirit.
---
Unlike Legion, Spirit is fun to play and her achievement are super easy to get. Tons of different play styles using Spirit whereas Legion is only really viable at high ranks using Frank’s Mixtape, which isn’t fun to play against for Survivors and isn’t fun playing as Killer.
---
Probably a health mix.
---
Wouldn't be Behavior if the event wasn't broken on release.
---
Yes you can use your bloodpoints on any survivor or killer despite not playing them.
---
Why am I still surprised?
---
I'D TAKE THE N WORD OVER BEING TOLD I'M LITERAL TRASH AND SHOULD KILL MYSELF, PERSONALLY. THE N WORD IS SERIOUSLY THE LEAST OF MY CONCERNS WHEN IT COMES TO TRASH TALKING IN THIS GAME.
---
I just woke up, but I'm still upset with myself. 
---
Ok just because you did something doesn't mean everyone else will
---
You can play as one character, regardless the side, and spend the bloodpoints earned on any character you like.  You can level up LF to get BBQ and never have to play a single game as him.  
---
To destroy the lunar vessels, you need to hook a survivor.  While a survivor is hooked, the vessels turn red and you can destroy them.
---
I used Ruin / BBQ / Nurse's / Whispers, but that was back around a year ago. Nowadays, I'd take Sloppy / BBQ / Nurse's / Agitation.
---
no it doesn't
---
just shock people
---
dude
---
Agreed
---
How do i delete someone elses post
---
Probably not worth the effort on your half.
---
I did wish destroying vessels counted for at least 10 and hooking is fine since it's closer pointwise
---
And as expected, people are awful.
---
Just updated and this patch 2.5.2. I’m pretty sure this is just a delayed release of the patch that us Xbox users didn’t get at the same time as everybody else as it was down.
---
Now I have seen this I am going to have a nightmare
---
I believe it's the same size as the mid-chapter update. I was playing on that update yesterday and today.
---
After a match, DBD said "Needs to be patched" so after a reset the update was shown for the game.
---
Ace Viscunti and Claudette Moron definitely deserve what happen to them. Shame about Feng though. I always feel sorry for her when though I'm a killer main. 
---
Yah, this event is out and broken... Nicely done again, devs
---
UwU
---
They do find ways to out due themselves. I think this might be a milestone for them!
---
I'm gonna shit myself if they release a patch that doesn't break anything.

True I’m just saying that I can see why they would be selfish because everyone else seems to be even when you try to help them.
---
First game facecamped by hillbilly died from 1st hook
---
2nd game freeze during loading into game
---
There goes my 2 envelopes, great gaming experience!
---
The event is broken rn anyways. 
---
&gt;The game ends if you stand in the exit gate until you’re downed or until you leave.
---
The game also ends if they play immersed the whole time. You'll eventually find them and kill them. Did you even read what I said?
---
I'm pointing out how dumb this line of reasoning is when talking about being held hostage in Dead By Daylight.
---
If you can make the game end yourself then you are not the victim of being held hostage. This isn't fucking rocket science.
---
Read the whole thing next time.
---
Okay. Just wondering. I figured. Just wanted to make sure 
---
Ah so the vessels are spread across the map? I hooked a glowing survivor and melee'd them a couple times lol probably looked like a moron. 
---
WHAT AN EXTREMELY WHITE COMMENT
---
Yeah but that proves my point yet you commented not true so im confused 🤔
---
Have a plan to cleanse every totem you meet.
---
Editing and Commentary, not gameplay.
---
Holy fuck these cosmetics are trash
---
Editing and Commentary, not gameplay. I'd really appreciate it, thank you! :) 
---
thats some good art! much support!
---
Yesterday’s patch was 1.08 GB, this seems to have fixed the item and prestige exploit.
---
True I just got another update for it mid match lmao
---
too bad the event doesnt even work right now
---
I agree that excess posts of the same thing is unnecessary but how difficult is it to simply comment that when they lock the thread or create a post addressing the issue?
---
Idk there's like 30-40K people online and im in like 20 minute queue times, that would be insane if that was the case.
---
I stopped watching after an hour. :/ so I have no idea. 
---
&gt;Hmm. So experienced.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I would appreciate it if you could answer how many gens were left when you were hooked and how long after you were hooked they popped.
---
2 gens left, fixed almost simultaneously after I was camped on the hook a complete first phase.
---
How about do it right the first time and not the second like some half assed homework assignment
---
because its bhvr
---
Oh wow, it's Mizukich (the artist)
---
Haven't seen him in a while
---
You go to a close by locket and reload then go back 
---
not buying it
---
That’s Susie. She made out with a hot dog.
---
i welcome it, just because i'm so tired of the hatch. i can imagine the survivor having a constant BBQ and chili type aura when they're in the fog, too. it also fits thematically in the game!
---
i wish pc players werent so idiots and this game was like ps4
---
almost dead
---
Calm down lol
---
Item four is the most amusing one- assuming that it takes bravery to be away from your keyboard. You really just follow every rule, don’t you, without a single bit of your own thought.
---
They’re not holding the game hostage, dumb ass- you can do gens and leave, which is the adult response. Crying to the teacher that your feelings are hurt they won’t chase you is what you’re doing.
---
Your other points are variations on your general pedantic asshole ways, where the exact letter of the rule is SOOOO important. 
---
We have different definitions of childish- yours is quite silly. It’s childish for me to dislike people who can’t help themselves but beg for attention from authority by ratting out any minor infraction.
---
I love how much time you’re taking responding, though. Surely if you repeat that I’m childish enough someone will pay your head and say “good boy.”
---
Goodbye, though- I’m done laughing at you. Enjoy being a snitch.
---
God dammit BHVR, do you even test your fucking updates? Every single patch has new bugs
---
Isn't bloodlust cloaked wraith with speed add-ons the fastest?
---
Event is currently broken, points aren’t being received on either side. 
---
That's quite the assumption but thanks for your insight anyhow. Also I have restarted twice. Any other suggestion? 
---
If people don't want them they won't be upvoted. There is no need to over regulate when it's a self solving issue.
---
Also why did you gild yourself? 
---
Same im trying to figure out too
---
IMAGINE THINKING THIS WAS SOMETHING YOU NEEDED TO POST.
---
&gt; out due
---
It's outdo
---
legion flair checks out
---
Try to get Ruin somehow some way. Because honestly if you don’t... you’ll find yourself losing many more games 
---
Came here to check if it was only me, I just played 2 matches as Doctor and even though I hooked (and killed) 6 survivors in the 2 games I have 0 points.
---
The community has suggested this on and off since release, but as far as I know, the devs have never said anything about it. 
---
So, I’d label it as wishful thinking. 
---
04:35 is the time stamp for the screenshot in the pic
---
Yeah, it's bugged. They said on twitter that they are already trying to fix it and hope to get a fix out later today. https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1090697657478197251
---
You make it sound like I would come back and help even if the event wasnt going on.
---
They are spread out across the map.  They look like a lamp hanging from a small hook with a square base.  It should be apparent what they are when you run into one, since they haven't been in the game until this event, though if a survivor is carrying the vessel then there will be no lamp(vessel) hanging from it.
---
Like the other guy said, there may be a different bug now, and I apologise for my jump to conclusions. The whole game seems rather buggy at the moment, so if restarting doesn’t fix it I suggest waiting for the inevitable hot fix.
---
First game, did 4 gens and escaped with a vessel, find out its broken. Good job. 
---
haha thanks, I'll correct that
---
Some sort of power that keeps him *hanging around* obviously t-posing is a must.
---
An update?
---
Killer power is kinda boring tbh. Just makes you and the survivor you chase go slower and the survivor can't hide. Perks are neat.
---
Yeah same here as killer on PS4. One game in. I don't think I got extra BP either.
---
I didnt even downvote you. I thought it was funny. And no, I didnt get the reference. Sorry I dont follow the same interests as you.
---
This is a common issue at the moment and the devs tweeted that there will be a fix later today :)
---
Dang. Ok thx
---
Yeah I play on Xbox
---
Huh, then someone else didnt like it. Its phoenix wright btw
---
IMAGINE THINKING THE N-WORD ISN'T FUCKING AWFUL 
---
People like to downvote  for any reason because it makes them feel powerful as they sit at home behind their device
---
I find games every 5-8 min. roughly
---
Event machine broke. 
---
i have like over 500 hours and this still applies to me
---
My advice would be don’t use legion
---
Thank goodness the event is bugged! Means I don't have to choose between taking part and playing Kingdom Hearts when I get home from work!
---
The event is broken.
---
ok, there is no editing and the commentary is a joke. hope you're happy now.
---
I see Michael in the backround... but it's missing someone (I think)... where is the gasey boi?
---
Coins (I'm guessing you are referring to Auric Cells) can only be acquired through purchasing them in the in-game store
---
oh, did i hit a nerve? guess you actually are fat ;)
---
U wot
---
i was thinking of something that could give a struggle like state to survivors where they have to spam a button to get the effect/ability off of them. but thanks for the feedback. 
---
Thx for saying the artist couldn't find it out
---
I hope they could do a fix for PS4 later today also.
---
I LITERALLY NEVER SAID ANYTHING OF THE SORT. I SAID THAT PERSONALLY SPEAKING I'M MORE UPSET BY BEING TOLD I SHOULD END MY OWN LIFE THAN BEING CALLED THE N WORD.
---
READ BEFORE YOU POST.
---
I'm really enjoying this broken event sitting waiting for a lobby for 20+ minutes at a time. :) 
---
When the bug gets fixed, could you or another mod delete and repost the megathread? Any discussion of the event is long since buried beneath 300 bug reports.
---
It is technically possible for a killer to get 45 in a game if there's 5 envelopes and they get a perfect game and they smash all the vessels, which is a little bit more than the survivors' "find one lamp and leave through the gates" perfect requirement.
---
The lantern promotes not getting hooked, it's pretty business as usual. Maybe players will be a little more selfish but they still need to escape the game which requires teamwork.
---
Dude huntress thicc
---
Machine broke event.
---
What are your thoughts on the *´´sex in situation X= a perk´´* meme that came around a few days ago. I posted it, and I´m new to the sub and don´t wanna make it a worse place.
---
Farming is when you unhook the survivor right after the killer hooked him or if the killer is still near. Sandbagging is when you bodyblock a survivor so he/she won't make it to a pallet or generally gets fucked because of it. 
---
And what about the narrative you're pushing? Lol. Nobody gives a fuck what you don't buy.
---
LMAO OKAY WONDER BREAD
---
Is it fixed? I’m on PS4. No update yet. 
---
I swear to god if you're that Feng with event set that was sabotaging my hooks you have big gay
---
so what about the PS4 crash before main screen bug?
---
i mean i guess i cant complain about not saving progress if i CANT PLAY THE GAME!
---
Nah they confirmed it's not just a visual bug.
---
C’mere big boi
---
thank you!
---
Yeah that sandwich looks pretty godlike I agree 
---
I love this
---
Cheers :)
---
Broke machine event
---
It's broken, for now
---
https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1090693719869874176
---
Any news yet on this?
---
Next up we'll have a Killer that can't use their power on release.
---
My first event after buying during the free weekend sale, seems to be going swimmingly 
---
yeah i got a few coins already, you have to finish the trial without hooking a single survivor or else it deducts points, so you wont get any coins.
---
It has a cap I think.
---
Yeah I lost all trust in bots that night! 
---
I'll start believing in God.
---
Its not dbd its the xbox its weird
---
Xbox just got an update for dbd 
---
Eating pallets and flashlights ain't much, but it's a honest work
---
But why would it give me a prompt to use the mouse and keyboard. That makes no sense
---
Theres literally 10 threads a minuye about this
---
https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1090693719869874176?s=21
---
I'm questioning the guy who posted a totally context-less image who is obviously attaching a message to it. God forbid I don't believe them after it took multiple comments to get the context.
---
&gt; Nobody gives a fuck what you don't buy.
---
Congrats on believing everything you see online
---
Best part is the Michael one.
---
I personally haven’t made one but there is a few on the subreddit.
---
Idk mine gives me controller prompts 
---
Xbox just got an update for dbd
---
Strange, it's still happening for me, allowing for one node consumption at a time before I have to refresh the screen. 
---
Guess I could have worded it better. Almost not true. :P Some people will still try to play unselfishly.
---
First you disagreed then agreed now disagree again, and btw if there's someone hooked and the gates are open usually you'll take the risk and rescue them because it gets more blood points which is what most players are working towards but in this current event instead of working towards blood points you're working towards cosmetics in which the quickest and most efficient route is escaping with a lantern so that is there main goal
---
PSA to everyone whining about the mechanics: you can just do gens and play the game normal. You have 2 weeks to get coins, fucking relax. 
---
Of course the event has to work first...
---
Hah where's 'wait for hatch but the rest won't leave?'
---
This one is much better. Could you do Jake Clown next?
---
Maybe browse the subreddit and you will find an answer.
---
I think so mate still updating mine rn
---
Lil piggy?
---
Her name is Amanda Ms. I can't get a date so I have to kidnap kids!!!
---
Not use him should you.
---
I'll try that
---
I HATE WHEN SURVIVORS RAGE QUIT WHEN I PLAY DOCTOR. I JUST WANT TO PLAY THE GAME TOO!
---
"a little bit". You need to hook each survivor 3 times, total of 12 hooks. It certainly is "a little bit" more than the "repair 5 generators, poke at vessel and run through a door".
---
Being hard camped/face camped is just boring because depending on how your team reacts, the killer can lure them over causing them to get downed and killed too and it’s just sour. 
---
Can someone post a screenshot showing me what the vessels look like? I didn't notice any in the couple of games I played.
---
Because you have to know what you're doing in order to do it right.
---
You're cute
---
Darn oh well...I mean yay take that bot abusers.....
---
How can a man so quiet have such a loud ass stare?
---
We should get back all the time we are missing out on
---
Not colorblind, they seems pink to me :O a redish pink, but pink 
---
You never had a game where two gens finished closely to each other? I don’t understand your problem. You don’t owe me a confirmation about the legitimacy of the story. This killer is camping, so why wouldn’t two gens be finished close to each other? What part makes you think this doesn’t sound true? If only I had a game recorder like on PS4 then I had evidence; but like I said I don’t owe you anything.
---
Being a dick just for the sake of being a dick. You must be very unhappy in life.
---
Oh i didn't see that part of the post before. Whoops!
---
You dont have to do nothing.Just enter the game and all survivors will dc.Game won.
---
Lil piggy on the track
---
The tweeted that the points are not being registered.
---
Won't receive or earn any coins until they fix it.
---
*The meme is* ***dead***
---
You're gaining progress, it's just not being displayed.
---
Oh yeah just found it myself lol. Thanks anyways. 
---
nobody give bhvr money for the cosmetics
---
they are worthless
---
Mike just wants to be loved
---
Spirit with Mother-Daughter Ring, Dirty Uwabaki, PWYF, NOED, DHope and tier 3 Bloodlust would probably be the fastest movement speed the player maintains full and total control over.

2.5.2 is now out, fixes the bloodweb stuff and exploits. I played a game and then it booted me out saying an update was required.

lmao okay man keep crying for getting caught

Well I applaud you for staying cool lol. It seems like a survivor could flashlight click once and I’d freak out lol.

Good luck with that. Event is bugged and any progress made right now will NOT be retroactively added back later.

God forbid people fucking glance at the sub
---
He's at home watching his VHS porn. :P
---
Ahh that makes sense
---
So full of shit
---
It just looks like a lantern on the wall. It looks like scenery. When a survivor carrying a vessel is hooked, they turn red - otherwise they're yellow. 
---
It feels amazing. If I didn’t desperately need my four current perks on wraith, I would be constantly using it. It makes your FOV much wider, makes the game seem smoother and even makes your character seem faster. I would definitely recommend it.
---
Sure sis &lt;3

Art style reminds me of Don't Starve.

Running around and hiding is not an attempt to make the game end. You do know that right? The ONLY reason someone does that is an attempt to cause the other person to DC. Period. End of story. It doesn’t matter AT ALL that there a ‘chance’ they can find the needle in a haystack. The point is the intent. 
---
You do NOT intend to finish the game by completing objectives. Your only objective at that point is to cause the other play to DC out of frustration. Period. End of story. It’s hijacking. 
---
Read and actually try to UNDERSTAND the whole fucking think next time.

Darn. Hope PS4 gets one soon. 
---
Oooh, that explains it, I was looking more at the ground. I'll keep an eye out for them on the wall, thanks!
---
This is so damn cute I love it 
---
Why would a killer bring an ebony? They can't get event points without hooking people.
---
You're in for a treat
---
Really dope 
---
damn that scrotum is yuuuge
---
Oh fuck off.
---
Just escaped with a vessel on PS4 and didn’t get anything for it too
---
Why tf am i even getting downvoted?
---
I didn't even continue playing after not getting my fucking progress it's so bad.
---
I like where you’re going with this
---
I thought we knew this from the pinned post................
---
On top of that, their focus seems to be entirely cosmetic related and there's constant visual bugs with the cosmetics anyway ex: hair flipping all over the screen, clipping between shirts and bottoms, torso completely missing. I was thinking they were pumping out cosmetics to earn money to actually properly fix their game (especially on PS4) but I can't even give them the benefit of the doubt if they can't even make the thing they care about look right.
---
They took away the “visually related” rules awhile ago, but I don’t blame you with the mod team tbh
---
*believes one thing I see online*
---
"CoNGratZ oN BeLiEVinG EvERytHiNG yOu SEe."

I can confirm the vessels spawn, I escaped with one before I realized it was broken.
---
Edit #6: Too late. [RIP ENVELOPES](/intensifies)
---
looks that way, sport
---
I understand. It's so annoying honestly
---
I’m definitely going to give those add ons a try and practice her power a little more so I get better. Something about the concept of playing killer is really difficult for me. I always played survivor on F13, too. Probably just something that needs practicing. 
---
I didnt really care about the last event and i dont really care about this one. Id probably care more about aesthetic bonuses if i didnt have to commit such a large portion of my time to acquiring them. The game is still awesome and i really enjoy it so i don't have any complaints, but i understand why people who do have the time to grind out all the extras would be upset about the event not working.

---
All good, the stickied Moonrise Event thread is being updated with info. That's where I saw the tweet.
---
I think, it's a reaction to the halloween event when killer were kind of an advantage and killer queue times were horrible. No they kinda did the complete opposite designing an event which encourages gen focus /fast games for survivors and incentives people to play more survivor than killer.
---
Man, the day the event came out, the internet was down in all my country, I'm on console but I fell your pain
---
I like that used that scrapped image for the disconnect. 
---
I appreciate your commentary man, you should make some DBD videos they'd be entertaining haha
---
Source op?
---
lol welcome to dead by daylight :)
---
I'm noticing a LOT of ppl DCing after getting downed. Are you able to keep the lantern if you DC without getting hook or is it just regular old toxic behavior?
---
There are too many survivors. Killer lobbies fill instantly
---
I had a killer (don’t remember who cause it was one of my first games) that chased all of us all match. But he never hit anyone into dying state. In the end game chat his name was “no down only tickle” and all he said in chat was “tickle tickle”
---
That was the game that got me 100% hooked on dbd. It was terrifying and funny at the same time
---
you dont have to be ashamed for being fat - but im glad that you admit that you are fat. once you realise that you are fat, you can do something against it!
---
It's *NOT* holding the game hostage if the other side *CAN* end the game. That's the definition of holding the game hostage. Not trying to end the game is not bannable. Preventing the other side from having any chance to end the game *IS* holding the game hostage.
---
Example, the Killer body blocks a living Survivor in the basement. The Survivor can not leave so they must wait for the Killer to stop/DC or they will have to DC themselves. This *IS* holding the game hostage because the Survivor *CAN NOT* end the game.
---
Example 2, the Killer does not chase and patrols 3 gens in an attempt to prevent the Survivors from escaping, but not killing them. Although the Killer is not trying to win, the Survivors have *a chance* to win. Therefore, the Killer is not holding the game hostage.
---
It doesn't matter if the other side is a toxic piece of shit and want you to have no fun. It. Is. Not. Bannable. End of story.
---
Again, you can ask the Devs yourself. They will 100% agree with what I'm saying.
---
Repaired four FULL gens and escaped with a vessel and was awarded 0 points.
---
To be fair, things might have worked well when they were testing the event.
---
Some things will break when exposed to the live servers despite working perfectly well during testing. *cough* Clash for League of Legends like 2-3 times *cough*
---
Why am I not surprised?
---
Yeah, pretty disappointed. Huntress cosmetic looks awesome but I would rather have cosmetics for another killer. I'll just buy the Huntress cosmetic and the Ace hair. And the vessel things turn every match into a shitshow, like every event. I need me some David cosmetics.
---
... Wait, I think I actually saw one, but I was on the Yamaoka estate and assumed it was part of the map. Oops.
---
I guess the event wasn't working then anyway...
---
See, this is the side of the community I'd love to be more prevalent than the constant saltfest.

Just people fucking around and having fun instead of describing in graphic detail how they defiled every female member of my family tree

Well it's critique after 2 games. Op is not having fun and that somehow makes that opinion invalid because of only 2 games. You think that you need to eat shit more than 2 times until it starts to taste good?
---
Eyes. All you need.
---
Killer or Survivor? 
---
Oh totally!
---
He probably did pass over 1, just didn't pass over the next 52 posts about the exact same thing,
---
I don't follow every rule but I won't cry cause someone reported me for doing something wrong... Neither will I try to justify it or bend it to make it not wrong. He is not holding the game hostage but he is wasting my time, I gotta complete all gens and escape (and actually farm points on him otherwise you won't safety pip). When I play I want to have a fun and somewhat challenging game which is impossible without a killer (or survivors if I'm the killer)
---
Just finished a survivor match and I DID receive points.

And what if Dwight is in there ?

uhhhh i haven't played the event yet, can someone tell me what exactly is wrong with it? and any other things that are up with it that are bad

Oof if you're gonna post someone's art without credit at least upload it in high quality.  This piece of art was created by u/imZukich. Highly recommend their art. 10/10.

Feng min hasn’t had a cosmetic in a while. While the other survs all had cosmetics recently, she finally deserved this beautiful outfit in my opinion
---
Who tf cares for rank?
---
I always do 
---
And on that note, I think it should be agreed upon that anyone using hex ruin should be shot
---
HOW DOES THIS GAME HAVE SUCH A LARGE PLAYERBASE AND STEADY INCOME OF COSMETIC REVENUE BUT STILL HAS GAMEBREAKING BUGS THAT LAST FOR ENTIRE PATCHES, ENTIRE MONTHS? GAMEBREAKING BUGS THAT ARE PUSHED LIVE DURING AN EVENT? ADDONS THAT ARE STILL BROKEN YEARS LATER? I'M RELATIVELY NEW TO THE GAME (&lt;1 YEAR PLAYED) SO I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WAS A BRIEF HICCUP OR PHASE BUT IT SEEMS TO BE THE NORM? 
---
THIS COMPANY IS MINDBOGGLING SOMETIMES, IS IT THE NUMBER OF STAFF OR MISMANAGEMENT OF DEVELOPMENT OR WHAT? I'M NOT SURPRISED HAVING PLAYED GAMES LIKE ARK AND WORSE. BUT I THOROUGHLY ENJOY THIS GAME SO I WANT BETTER FOR IT AND SEEING THE POTENTIAL SQUANDERED THROUGH LAZINESS HURTS TO SEE
---
Makes sense to me, ” A survivor main”
---
Good idea, but, Quentin is probably limp from not sleeping.
---
I done one today fine, a couple of weeks ago it wouldn't work
---
This is the most stupidest tactic anyone can do. Grabbing a lantern and crouching around map. Not helping your team, thus decreasing the chances of escapes as less gens are being done. Don’t be selfish. Get on a generator.
---
dead meme but ok
---
No bathroom etiquette man, my boy had too much survivor pudding and probably had the runs.
---
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU, AND KILLER CAN BE FRUSTRATING AT TIMES. I AM PROBABLY OVERREACTING, AND FOR THAT I WILL COMMIT SUDOKU. 
---
They should hire competent people.
---
What do they look like?
---
Yes, you’re using doctor
---
"Live" What a joke
---
hey everyone, can someone ELI5 how this new event works?

I don’t really I’m just try to get to rank1 for the achievement I just got dbd for pc and I’m trying to get all the achievements

Wait. You censored a letter but you still have all the letters in fr*ck. What’s the other letter?
---
it doesnt works
---
It’s not just a PS4 problem. Very annoying.
---
??? You need to hook to use the ebony
---
You can if you bring the offering for it.
---
Makes sense. Survivor has the most point potential so everyone's playing Survivor to get points ASAP. Was my plan, too, but if the wait is massive then Killer will probably be faster in the long run. Have to see when I get home from work, assuming the event's fixed. If not I'll just play something else.
---
It usually doesn't multiply the event bp, just the normal stuff
---
There's a lot of posts about the same memes too. I'm pissed and I'll voice it. Why is it so difficult for you just to not post in a topic you disagree with, then?
---
b
---
I want 10
---
How many games have you played total though? You'll get there.
---
Ooh what’s the offering?
---
Exactly what I said it would be like and hence why I didn't bother getting excited.
---
I see what you did there
---
Working now. There's lanterns on pedestals on in the match. Survivors get 25 points for escaping with one, and 4 points for each gen fixed (by anyone), and Killers get points for hooking survivors and destroying them lanterns after they've hooked a survivor. 100 points = 1 coin, for one event cosmetic, IIRC. Survivors have like, fire flies around then when holding a lantern.
---
Sorry objective points "Max" 
---
time to cleans some totems 
---
It’s what you deserve.
---
Take the bait man
---
Fuckyou
---
Did you play as legion in that game?
---
It’s not wrong- it’s against the rules. Big difference.
---
Also, not sure if anyone’s told you this, but doing gens and getting out is the goal. If you’re trying to get killed as fast as possible, sure, he’s making your game worse, but now you’re literally complaining about having to do objectives.
---
Come on, boychik- you were doing a much better trolling job before. Why not wax eloquently about the bravery of those who break a meaningless rule in a game again, or try calling me dumb? You were at least an entertaining waste of life then.
---
Michael wasn't invited to the party? sad day :(
---
So, Claudette?
---
I’m on PS4 and playing as survivor I got nothing. Playing as killer however, I’ve gotten points. 
---
Huntress looking at Amanda like "That should have been me damnit"
---
Are killers like bugzappers then?
---
Depends, if people have decisive strike or have been bming all game they are on their own. 
---
It’s always 1v1v1v1v1... you just only notice during events.
---
SuPrEmE
---
Thats how a hero works
---
holy fuck this subreddit finds a way to cry about legion even in posts that has nothing to do with them. ffs this is a survivor message to survivors
---
I like you
---
Isn't Mathieu the proof you need?
---
If only we got to see Amanda change into her outfit like everybody else apparently did ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
thanks for the answer! good luck in the event :D
---
Thanks
---
Nope, and that sucks
---
Outside of bugs, is there a blood point boost?
---
Finally started working for me.
---
"I want to sabotage the other side" implies mentality where you want to bring harm to the other side just to fuck with them. Like holding game hostage. The fact that one **wants** this just reveals malice, and that is "toxic". Like in baseball, you could say that you **want** to hit the ball so that it hits the face of a player on the opposing team so he or she gets severe injury, taking that player out of game i.e. sabotaging the team.
---
Nope.
---
Not sure. I had it ever since I bought the DLC
---
LOOKING AROUND YOU WHILE KEEPING YOUR LOOPS TIGHT IS PART OF LOOPING SKILL.
---
That sounds like good development practice so idk wtf you're doing bringing it up in regards to bhvr
---
:(
---
Whatever. It's a pretty lame event anyways.
---
Alright, when I get home from work I'll record a test and prove it to you.
---
does it award bloodpoints at all?
---
What’s next, “you should be able to use a medkit when you’re down” ?
---
theyre still not there :(
---
Seriously. Three times I’ve been hit on the complete opposite side of a pallet, triggering any action takes about 3-5 seconds before actually starting it. 
---
The only person meg's face belongs on is bubba 
---
If you escape with it you get bonus bloodpoints (idk how many).
---
I did as well until I started watching his content. It is pretty good.
---
Y I get downvote :(
---
I wouldnt be satisfied untill Shirtless Kate. Why so obsessed with a dude? :D
---
In an hour you could probably have earned the same or more just doing regular matches
---
Killjoy and negative Nancy, but okay 
---
Yeah it sucks, at least didn't last that long
---
My first 4 attempts at playing the game resulted in an infinite loading screen IN.A.ROW and the first "real" game was against a hillbilly with ruin and insta saw. 
---
Survivors everywhere I urge you to ONLY play swf and use op shit like ds and insta heals during this event because killers are gonna be dicks, trust me.
---
You know that isn't Myers actual hair right? It's a part of his mask (a distressed captain Kirk mask). I don't know what his actual hair looks like.
---
Every minute or so it was giving me 500 for carrying vessel
---
I dunno if you need to be whining about 2 downvotes =P
---
I can only speak for myself, and I downvoted you because repeating OP’s title does not add to the conversation, and does not need to be seen by anyone. 
---
Pretty sure you can still get it for free, no way that the glitch is gonna stay for the entire event, and if it did, we would sure be allowed some extra time to get points
---
Nobody like de clown
---
"HUE HUE DAE HATE LEGION"

you need to level up to get shards

That bloodpoints multiplier didn't last very long eh..?

Perks of having your own credit cards. Did I say perks or danger? 
---
You're a bit aggressive. Did you play Legion today ?
---
Well... shit
---
Shit. Thanks for clarifying
---
Bcuz shirtless clown is far superior than any other cosmetic they give him 
---
holy shit this is a cursed post
---
Almost looks like a hook
---
I'm guessing nothing was saved and no compensation? Man this is some bullshit, would already have a coin and a half by now :(
---
Chloride.
---
2 games so far and 2 mori’s during an event you’re supposed to farm in. God I hate high rank. 
---
It's fixed now. I didn't mean he wouldn't be able to get it for free ever, I was just making a comment on how they released an event completely broken without retroactive compensation.
---
Just nurse things
---
BHVR is the dumbass comic relief character of the video game company world. They are Patrick Star/Barney Gumble
---
Unbreakable ftw
---
&gt;~~Very unfortunate timing for BHVR to drop the event, people are having login issues :(~~
---
Damn. I wonder what could be the reason for login issues the moment a new event starts? 
---
True but it was like this for me before the event. It's just slightly worse now.
---
BP, BP, counterbalance the distressing because you don't actually want that much terror, super strong endgame. You can comfortably camp until Fire Up becomes op, that's why you're LF. Perfect synergy in my book.
---
Also nobody plays killer on ps4 due to the issues that were supposed to be fixed a month ago and never were. It’s been like this for weeks. Even green ranks can randomly have 20 minute queues. 
---
Fk me i had 90 pnts :(
---
Maybe he was adding to what I said by saying what if you can only use the key while you’re down if you bring a certain offering?
---
They said on twitter that they pushed a fixed. I restarted the game and it's not working.
---
A concrete cube at the bottom, a steel farmer's cane sticking out of that. May or may not have a red berry hanging down.
---
I haven't had any issues myself so far...I did have one game where I got killed pretty quickly but we were all playing like pants so I can't say the killer was being mean or anything.
---
Well considering there Is almost no reason to bring the event offering for killers.
---
By photoshopping into a frame of the original Halloween
---
What row / Collin did ya get ?
---
Same here buddy (Italy)
---
A: you implied it
---
B: if you’re playing anywhere near high rank your team will get gens done, but if you’re low rank and haven’t played much that would make a lot more sense
---
C: you clearly haven’t played killer and don’t understand how important time management is as a killer. I play both and can tell you 10 seconds wasted on that is a huge waste
---
D: yes it was poorly phrased and stupid, and you could have just clarified instead of whining 
---
E: this isn’t anti survivor, it’s anti toxic behavior and just a feel good meme for the killers who have had to deal with it you just decided to take it personally.
---
F: the main hypocrisy here is you claiming that I’m making up points when you have no real points of your own besides “one time a killer hit me on hook and it made me mad”
---
G: it can be slightly toxic to sit there hitting a survivor but it’s trade of toxicity, in other words tbagging causes no trouble because you’re just sitting on the other side of the pallet anyway. Hitting a survivor wastes time and accomplished nothing, and sometimes it’s literally just to stop a scream whereas tbagging is always just to be toxic.
---
H: ur mom gey 
---
Go for it. 
---
You do get extra blood points for doing the vessel stuff (I noticed getting 1000 bp for taking it as a survivor and occasional 500 bp rewards for playing while having it) but no boost on anything else, yeah :(
---
What row / Collin did you get?
---
Wait- killers aren’t just letting you do whatever you want? They’re using perks and add-ons?
---
Have a tissue.
---
It's easier to start out with killer imo. Play killer until you get a feel for where the gens are and until survivors show you how to loop, then switch back and try it for yourself.
---
Just hook survivors
---
Ahh.  Thanks :) 
---
You simply tell her she's bad and explain why she's bad. I do it to my friend's all the time. (And they all play like actual rocks) If she blows up, tell her to Hakuna her Tatas and move on. One of my friend's is a literal forehead when it comes to things like this but he knows I'm right.
---
Thanks! You too.
---
Around 200 hours on PC and around 100 on console. I played last night and my friends and I are rank 14 but facing killers with all purple perks.  Or the entire nurses kit on the doctor or something. Not saying killers are "OP" but I think survivors need a little something. 
---
This isn't just a complaint or anything I just felt like the killer was always able to find us or figure out how to 4k. Shit we faced the cannibal on the Yamoka state and he face camped me after I was chainsawed saving someone else caught only once too. It is definately possible for the killer to be tricked but if it only works for .3 seconds then I'm in trouble lol.
---
You can destroy multiple vessels per match. If everyone offered a red envelope and you destroyed all of them, you'd get 70 points if it was 10. You get points per hook and vessels destroyed. Seems fine to me.
---
Good question, id recommend taking him to a different locker and letting him live there 
---
You’re basically a hill Huntress 
---
Same, it's really atmospheric.
---
See I don't gotta try and bend things like "It's not wrong, its agains't the rules that you accepted". And you don't even know what the game goal is... if you just escape you will not rank and you will not gain bp. Nice try kid (you actually seem like a teenager acting like a kid but what's the difference)
---
I agree DC is garbage but you followed the uncooked survivor. Yeah it's easier than looking for the others but it makes the game fun for the survivors if you just give them a chance a bit. Especially when the team has a DC, it's good etiquette to give them a chance. Don't have to be ruthless to have a fun game as killer. Btw I don't main, I'm 50/50 killer/survivor so don't think I'm just a salty survivor. 
---
It's the same at every rank. I haven't played since rank reset and it's exactly that.
---
Bruh this cursed post is in Michael Myers 
---
Ta-da! Still got it. 
---
I actually like this idea. Should've done it for the movie.
---
Entity is out here pulling its pranks again 😒
---
Tfw you have to bribe people with in-game currency to play your game
---
You can still find her audio files on youtube. Out context, it sounds like she's having her first anal session with the Doctor's punishment stick.
---
Yes its fixed
---
I didn't know Molly Millions was a survivor in DBD.
---
Lmao
---
I love stuff with killers and survivors outside of the trials
---
Its year of the killer. Add the lag and it's not worth it. 
---
No way the game is marked complete as Deathgarden is dead.
---
Honestly I think they're gonna focus on dedicated servers and matchmaking while finding ways to alleviate the bloodpoint grind, then start introducing more chapters (then again I want as many chapters as possible lol).
---
the person is talking from a survivor standpoint, not killer
---
I could see them continuing, if they dont keep up with content and patches the game will slowly die and i think its kinda there big thing atm.
---
They said a while ago that they pretended to keep making content for 5 years ahead.
---
So much shame...
---
I just played a game where my headphones were on my desk and I still heard it...
---
Apply pressure and learn to switch targets
---
It’s literally the killer’s objective to hook the people with a lantern. Why is that so hard to get through your thick skull?
---
Fixed now
---
Where can I see the skins? I’m away from my computer right now
---
Console peasant.
---
i should stop commenting when i can't think because of 24/7 headache
---
Yes how dare a company want money for something they work on
---
Real fake hooks 
---
I have my volume at 35% because the game is so loud and I didn't hear it till I was an inch away.

Oh definitely but there are a majority of unlicensed people who they keep just not including

Trying to find a lone immersed Claudette on yamaoka estate scouting for hatch. So much FUCKING fun.

Calm down there sportsdude11111111111111111111111111111 
---
I say it's fair game. I am a survivor main. Survivors have their flashlight and insta-heal, DS, everything. If I play killer and I want to tunnel or camp as a killer I do so and don't feel bad about it. I usually don't because I seem to get more points if I don't, but sometimes I just really want to kill a annoying survivor. Do gens and get the vessels if you find them. Just running around looking for vessel do attract killers.
---
not really
---
cuz ur shit at the game
---
Any advice on how exactly one does that? I was rank 1 last season but now just reaching rank 10 and I'm barely getting 2 kills each game.
---
Who for example? I feel like they all have a decent amount of cosmetics, but I might be forgetting some

---
Extremely repetetive. I dont like it. Winter theme was best imo.
---
Some players will always tunnel, event or not. It sucks but nothing to do about it.
---
Yes and no (not anymore :( )
---
No clown? :( not judging, still an awesome picture. 
---
That poor Meg
---
The poor quen
---
Just tell em.
---
So you ragequit and he called you out?
---
that was also repetetive? I like both, both were immersive.

Hello,your job is to FEED THE ENTITY! How,much food the entity want? a lot. Your job, is mainly to put the chunkie survivors full of hope on the hooks to feed the entity their sweet,sweet hope.
---
You also, need to guard the gens. So, the chubby little survivors do not escape.
---
Mainly, If ya wanna be nice, get two kills and hook the other 2 twice. If you wanna play as intended to whatever It takes outside of cheating to get those kills.
---
As fair as camping goes, It is frown a upon and not wise to do early game,but when the exit gates are up camp as much as you want,because well It works sometimes. However,If people are dumb enough to come to the basement all at once and you down them,It is there own fault. Basically,only camp If people are being stupidity virtuous. 
---
I go on the whole "I will be nice til you piss me off" rule, which is...If you dont teabag or taunt me..I will hook everyone once. If you do anything to piss me off,you are getting camp.  If you body block me or flashlight me, every time I turn around (I can admire a random drive by flashing lighting) I am gonna to tunnel you til the cows come home. And If you are a gutless person who leaves your teamate for dead waiting fr the hatch, I will make sure you dont get to see the end of the match. I am harsh,but I am fair.
---
Basically,play kill how you want by this point..And evolve base on how the survivors are playing.
---
This is insane - someone else plays Quentin? What madness is this, I thought only a handful of us existed!?
---
They get cosmetics but only a couple of survivors ever get event cosmetics 
---
ur trash
---
Didn't realize how bad it was. Peak player count over the last 2 months is 17 players. Not looking good. 
---
Hmm. I've never had issues hearing the hatch, especially when I'm right next to it. Odd. 
---
I LOVE LAMP
---
Her good ones are far and few. 
---
opossums rarely actually bite, that's just a bluff to scare you, only reason you shouldnt pet wild ones is because you are stressing them out, some that are used to humans dont hiss
---
You're for sure not supposed to farm. They explicitly made it so that people could play normally. 
---
Yes, bodyblocking and glitching is a successful attempt to “take the game hostage” but hostage doc and hiding forever are still attempts to “take the game hostage”. The devs do not define taking a game hostage by those two specific circumstances, they define it by actions taken by one side that force the other side to disconnect in order to end the match. Bodyblocking and glitching are successful ways to take the game hostage and thus the only two you can get banned for, but hostage doc, hiding, etc are still attempts to do so and are still gameplay abuse. 
---
In reference to your analogy of facecamping or waiting at the exit gates, facecamping progresses the game for the killer, and even by my interpretation you can kill your self on the hook by your own free will to end your match. If you are waiting by the exit gates, the killer can choose to end the match by their own free will by pushing you out. If you are hiding indefinitely, the killer can choose to search for you but can not choose by their own free will to progress the game, only search for you in the hopes that they find you eventually. 
---
Back in the days when dropping a survivor did not fill the wiggle bar, the killer could pick up and drop a survivor over and over again to force the survivor to wait nearly 20 minutes or disconnect. This was later removed as they eventually added the wiggle bar progress each time you dropped them. 
---
I’m not asking for people to be banned over hiding forever, but there needs to be a mechanic that reveals the survivor to the killer if they have not made a fair amount of progress towards their objective in a decent amount of time so that we stop getting situations like these where a survivor draws a match out for 20 more minutes than it should’ve gone on for out of spite. (There needs to be something done about situations like hostage doc as well but it would be difficult to set parameters that distinguish the killer not choosing to progress the game and the killer being unable to progress the game)
---
Im sure everyone here gets that there’s a difference between holding the game hostage for an infinite amount of time and stalling the game out, but it’s the difference between stalling the game out with an ending in mind and griefing the other player out of spite because you have a very slim chance of winning. 
---
&gt; it's easy avoidable by doing gens strategically
---
I hate this meme so much.
---
If you camp the last 3 gens together there is no "doing gens strategically". You are forced to get on these gens at some point. Even if you split up and do gens spread out, as long as those 3 gens are being camped, there is no 'strategic'. Pop on game offering. Put on either treatment shock addons or increased shock range. Shock the 3 gens over and over again.
---
It doesn't need to be the game. Any map is fine, actually. Most maps have 3 gens close to each other.
---
There is nothing you can do, you are in madness 3 again and again, the killer isn't killing you, he's just wasting yours and everyone's time.
---
**The same way how your time is being wasted**
---
But you don't see me complaining it's bannable. It's allowed, it's in the game and you'll eventually make it if you keep at it, right?
---
The difference in that situation against yours is that you CAN do something about it with relative ease.
---
Use whispers.
---
I used to be just like you except at some point I realized, I -can- do something about it. I ran whispers, I triangled on the last person everytime. This situation happens OFTEN, a lot of people hide end-game, either intentionally by wasting your time or trying to repair that last gen for the hatch.
---
You're the one who's choosing to complain about it and calling it 'bannable'.
---
It's not bannable. Face it. It's not holding the game hostage.
---
"Every killer is being a dick by running good shit! Let's run even MORE broken shit! We're in the right, they're in the wrong, welcome to Dead by Daylight!"
---
the entity Itself..
---
Disconnecting doesn't automatically equate to ragequitting 
---
I didn't ragequit, I just got disconnected
---
Well, farm was the wrong term. But it still hurts them to mori instead of hook in terms of how fast they want it to go. 
---
I think there will be 2 Killers released around the same time. One licensed (either Jason or Pinhead). I personally hope after they're done that they're just going to dedicate a good 2-3 solid months to just optimizing and balancing the game. No separating the teams to work on more BS. Let the costume guys make those costumes to get those shekels, fine. 
---
But, this is Behavior so it probably won't happen like that. Sadly. 
---
Recommend watching Scotts guilde, goes on most reliable way to get melee hatchets, mid ranged and far hatchets [https://youtu.be/IQRDijaX5Io?t=365](https://youtu.be/IQRDijaX5Io?t=365) 
---
we seem to be missing a killer...wheres the shape or the clown
---
Just 99.999% of the time. OP deserved it. 
---
Meg in Myers' mask or Myers with Meg cosplay?
---
you couldnt even get progress until the hotfix
---
There is a perk called Borrowed Time where you can unhook the person within the killer's radius, and that means if they get hit within 10/15/20 seconds depending on the tier, they won't get downed immediately.
---
But that doesn't really work for camping killers as such, as they can still just chase you down if they want to so not too many people run it.
---
You can take a hit and **then** rescue them, but that leaves you both vulnerable.
---
Camping killers just aren't fun. I've never understood why people do it. Sure you can basically guarantee a kill or 2 if they try to save, but as a killer your time is better spent leaving the hook to find someone else as if you just stay around the hooked person, the other survivors will just be doing generators and you won't be stopping them.
---
As a survivor it just isn't fun just hanging there watching the killer pace back and forth around you. People want to play the game they paid for and while I agree that you paid for it, play it how you want to, it's kind of a dick move to limit other peoples game play while you do it.
---
Looks like zombie Fiona the ogre. 
---
Watch out, He's gonna one Shot
---
Take a closer look to find Michael ;)
---
As for the clown, he's just chillin somewhere watching his VHS porn.
---
 L M F A O
---
When did I imply that? Also, it's been a problem since they added legion. I'm aware it can take time to fix issues but when the game is becoming literally unplayable due to it not even loading there's a glaring issue.
---
No jokes allowed
---
There are on PC. Unsure about console. I read somewhere they're bringing more cosmetics to console soon though
---
Yess! I love these art pieces of the killers being one big family. I love to think about the interactions and stuff 
---
Ye a good way to learn to get better is to play both killer and survivor and maybe watch some youtubers or streamers. 
---
I asked nicely and didn’t spam at all. I don’t see the problem
---
They're garbage. Zero clue why it's still ultra rare
---
lol this post is basically me shaming my friend (the meg) for her horrible play. She thought she was blocking him from picking me up when really he was just using her for the charge.

---
Wasn't it 100 base then increases by 100 each time after? So, 100, 200 etc.?
---
lol, imagine if it increases by 100 each time! I hope not! I only got 95 points towards my first ATM.
---
How come?
---
Yep. Still boasting about how many times he shot him 
---
Maybe I'm just crazy (definitely a possibility), but I feel like after the 2.5 update gen repair speed has increased. 
---
"Hey guys I got a team kill with Junkrat spam, karma please?!"
---
Never expected to see two godlike figures in this image.
---
Still, unless everyone escapes the killer is better off than the survivors who don’t, which will probably be 2-3 a game on average. Plus killers get more blood points pretty much no every game which compensated for getting less event points 
---
The game just needs better matchmaking, which we unfortunately won't get. 20 ranks is not nearly enough and the way you rank up does not reflect player skill.
---
There's been buffs/nerfs where required but not an entire remake, which a lot of people want for Legion. If they change the fact he can break chase just by looking down, causing you to bleed out **while he's still chasing you** then it might improve things.
---
Oh geez I've gotten some toxicity but nothing that bad. My rule of thumb is: no toxic behavior even if I died/didnt kill everyone? They get a GG. Toxic behavior regardless of outcome? No gg for them, report if worth reporting but otherwise move on. I'm in a bad mood and salty I lost? I'm the problem,  quit playing and send no messages bc my mood might taint them. That way I can at least be polite. And if I don't have anything nice to say, they don't need to hear it. Bc you never know the person behind the controller. They could just be having the worst day and blowing off steam. And I do love goofing off both as a killer and a survivor,  but it's also fun to play a good killer or group and "win" and get those ggs in return, you know?
---
I'm kinda in the same boat. I almost never escape because I suck at looping and evading. I can get cheeky with some door jamb jukes occasionally but more often than not I just end up getting mowed down.
---
I will say Urban Evasion has helped me stay hidden, and if I stay hidden I can generally do much better.
---
The average game will be 2 survivor deaths. That is the metric to go off of. Sadly you will be a statistic in most of those, but sometimes you have to make the tough call.
---
Also, as a tip, NEVER go rescue a basemented survivor if the killer is a LeatherFace. Just saying.
---
Reeeeeee
---
Testing before deploying? Are you daft?
---
Holy shit, I'd love something like that! 
---
I saw komi-san and I thought I was on r/animemes 
---
I've not seen any confirmation of any of it. I really hope it's not though, seems a bit steep.   
---
Literally 900 by the end of it... -.-
---
Console or PC? And what's your region/time of day you play? Sometimes it does bug out, but the game also pulls players from your region so if you're playing at like 5am it's not likely you'll get a game very quickly until the system branches out and finds players from other regions.
---
It increases in 100 point increments. 100, then your 2nd coin will require 200, and so on.
---
SABO SHOULDN'T BE ALLOWED TO WAKE SURVIVORS UP. UNBREAKABLE AND NO MITHER ALSO NEED TO HAVE THE WAKE UP ABILITY REMOVED. SAME WITH HEALTH KITS. THE DREAM TRANSITION ALSO NEEDS TO COMPLETELY STOP ALL PROGRESS BARS WHILE THE SURVIVOR IS IN THE TRANSITION.
---
Ikr, by the end it would be pretty impossible to achieve :/
---
Thank God, it means I can play killer normally this event.
---
you are probably chasing a survivor until he dies right? Try getting multiple people hit and forcing them off gens. If you focus one person and let himm loop you around you will lose all gens in no time
---
Not really 
---
lmao I feel you
---
A longgg time ago, I was playing with a friend and partway through the match we found a cloaked wraith via the growling noises. He didn’t move at all the entire game and we opened the gates, returned to him and he still hadn’t moved. So we did a bit of point grabbing with totems and chests and all that until my friend realized that the growling was no longer happening and the wraith was gone. Scared the devil out of us both and we quickly made for the exit, never seeing the suddenly moving wraith.
---
Yeah I don’t know about a timer or bans because a timer will be hard to find a fair yet quickish amount of time for, and bans seem a little harsh for the situation but they should even just tweak the crows so that if you don’t do at least 1/4 of a gen (that’s 20 seconds on a gen) in two minutes you get three crows. If exit gates are powered you have three minutes before you get three crows. (Like I said in my other reply to him it’s not just survivors, something needs to be done about hostage doc as well) 
---
In regards to him tho I honestly don’t know what else to say. I’ve tried explaining it from different perspectives but I’ve ran out of ways to put it other then, well, I just disagree and think he’s being too technical about it from a banning perspective.
---
well, at least there is a direct way for killers to stop them from getting points..but why don't you let everyone have fun?🤔 #love
---
Implying even bhvr is as incompetent as riot games. Riot honestly deserves an award for how bad they are at making their own game, 600 players across the three major servers who are challenger and the d5 balance team still puts out 3 season of garbage because they ignore player input entirely. 
---
"When fire up becomes op," you mean in a couple months after it hopefully gets buffed?
---
I think that I have see two or three BNPs since the nerf, that’s it. 
---
Standing at hatch is the only way to guarantee survivor doesn't bitch out of doing the required gens by taking the hatch
---
Nothing personal kid
---
Sumo cosmetic pleeee
---
sorry
---
Wait Spotify?
---
I don’t have a source for that, but I absolutely remember the devs saying that in one of the streams. 
---
It does increase by 100 each time
---
They're so much worse than before, but they still can get you half a gen done very quickly.  
---
I thought that might be the case, but that is way to steep surely.   
---
It would be pretty impressive for anyone to achieve all 9 coins (especially with the state of the game with dc's and wasted games) :/
---
I think I've seen like one since the nerf. I personally haven't put it on, cause id rather put on an add-on to make the tool box repair longer/faster in the long run
---
Aww Bubba was just protecting his family &lt;3
---
It's THEIR only thing. Deathgarden was DOA. 
---
They explicitly confirmed it in the dev stream
---
Earrape rock music better
---
Oh god the flashbacks.
---
Prove thyself is finally good
---
Doesn’t look like it. It seems fixed now but I played like 6 games without it counting 
---
Ah ok, figured if it was in a stream it would have been noted on the wiki but couldn't find anything on it.   
---
How joyous..
---
whats that got to do with it
---
I run Haunted Grounds, Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt and Nurses Calling/some other aura perk if you have it like BBQ/Bitter Murmur. Usually I run these with Prayer Beads and either Father's Glasses or Wakizashi Saya/Yakuyoke Amulet cause people can't resist totems. Thrill shows you when they're being touched and you can silently phase behind them and pull them off the totem. Makes me feel like an asshole but ***it's so much fun.***
---
Megel Myers
---
I know man all my killers are running anti gen at the moment. Noed never helps much for me.
---
thats why hes more cancerous than freddy 
---
Thanks, never thought of it that way, asshole
---
Nope. 15% over 5 seconds. Hitting the checks will give you an additional 10%.
---
If they run to a strong loop then you need to recognize that and should leave them and patrol gens. Its all about map knowledge. Sloppy butcher helps in applying pressure because if you get hits on multiple people thats alot of time spent healing. 
---
Its just a game, man. Theres no reason to make the grind worse for everyone. The only one that wins with this is bhvr. 
---
I think you earn more coins if you can consistently escape then compared if you can consistently 4k, but I think you earn more bp as killer still 
---
Not sure if I’m imagining it, but I thought they made noise? 
---
Shut up and stop being a douchebag you loser.
---
Damn, ive been waiting for a BP boost to prestige meg.
---
I know I'm just being a troll to a post from earlier from here.
---
I use this trick when I'm with my ex
---
It’s almost like they forgot to add bonuses. It’s incredible this is the INTENDED scoring.
---
Only loser here is you on a hook.
---
unlucky too bad guess you'll have to spend real money on the cosmetics  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

---
&gt;In reference to your analogy of facecamping or waiting at the exit gates, facecamping progresses the game for the killer, and even by my interpretation you can kill your self on the hook by your own free will to end your match. If you are waiting by the exit gates, the killer can choose to end the match by their own free will by pushing you out.
---
The point of me citing these examples is to show that it's not holding the game hostage if you do it for any amount of time. Technically, when you sit at the exit gate, you're "holding the game hostage" (by your definition) for a small period of time. This doesn't qualify as holding the game hostage in the eyes of the devs because the Killer can end it. Just like how the Killer can find the Survivor and end it. It has to have the criteria that the other side *can not* do anything to end the game.
---
&gt;there needs to be a mechanic that reveals the survivor to the killer if they have not made a fair amount of progress towards their objective in a decent amount of time
---
I do agree with this.
---
&gt;Im sure everyone here gets that **there’s a difference between holding the game hostage for an infinite amount of time and stalling the game out**, but it’s the difference between stalling the game out with an ending in mind and griefing the other player out of spite because you have a very slim chance of winning.
---
Yes, and that difference is what makes it bannable. In my eyes if you intentionally grief the other player and don't make an attempt to win then you should be punished. (or the game shouldn't allow you to do it in the first place). But that doesn't mean it's bannable. It's not. Whether it's bannable or not is not based on your opinion or mine it's based on the dev's viewpoint and rules.
---
BNPs best use is to guarentee a skill check to wake up against freddy.
---
Ahh, it looked about half when I used my last BNP but I don't use them often...for obvious reasons. 
---
Yeah, I figured as much, but my post is more to the community as a whole. 
---
Still more creative than an unedited gameplay video with TITLED “when you [insert thing that happens in 70% of matches] XD”
---
Survivors are why killers are like they are. Killers are why survivors are as they are.
---
it doesnt cause an explosion when you fail a bnp skill check though, so surely that wouldnt work?
---
Best way to earn BP - find a lantern right away and grab it. Then hide in a corner all game and farm the passive point gain for holding a vessel.
---
I get some queues like that without the event. Killer, never, but as a survivor it happens to me at least twice a night. 
---
Productive feed back? Nah
---
Call him shit? Good idea!
---
You need to stop.
---
As a meg main, I can’t even bring myself to buy it for the cosmetic
---
I was wondering the same, I did only one match to test it and died on hook, but i got 45 points.
---
no you
---
Early on the sub
---
I noticed this too. It seems like if you SWF if one of you escape with a vessel anyone who escapes also gets the 25 points. 
---
Great respons, made me laugh
---
LOL so what you're saying is 
---
***LET US WIN** 
---
lol, nerd. 
---
That's a terrible and unproductive way to play, and if it becomes the norm I bet the devs will remove the passive.
---
Maybe they don't care?
---
The base to any good survivor pudding is all the tears they have whenever they die in a game about killers.
---
https://i.imgur.com/wtygeLn.jpg
---
Thank you :) 
---
killer only takes hooks though, so why didn't you suggest anything for the killers to go out of their way to get it?
---
Preciate it
---
Nothing for gens or hooks? That's fucking stupid. This event is dumb.
---
Is no mither common?
---
Oh God, this is good! My favorite is T-Bagged, the Icon makes me laugh xD
---
I betcha the game is gonna crash after a few games.
---
No but I thought to make that collum harder.
---
Not in terms of bonus bp. 
---
Deletes them from real life 😂
---
I was solo and got 45 points for my death on the hook
---
British for ‘No Problem’
---
My favourite ear stabbing is haddonfield
---
I was worried it was my console specifically.
---
Frankly, I’m 100% a Nea main and I almost never play Quentin. Just using his bp offerings because I’m planning on prestiging the licensed characters
---
The second coin is 200 points, so I'm assuming it's 4,500 for all 9 coins, not 900. Which is ludicrous to be honest.
---
-BHVR 2019-
---
It’s not like baseball, though, where there is an unlimited number of possible runs. It’s more like a poker tournament- there is a limited supply of chips, and any one I stop you from having benefits me. It’s a zero-sum game, as I said. 
---
Also, it’s fun to fuck with the other side. Whichever side I’m playing, that’s part of my goal- perks like Franklin’s Denise and Borrowed Time fuck with the other side- that’s why they’re fun.
---
Why gotta do the bae Feng Min like that

---
Don't let this comment distract you from the fact that it's pebble time.
---
*Fingers bend the wrong way*
---
Did he ever admit he lied? I searched but never managed to find anything further on the matter
---
&gt;killer only takes hooks though, so why didn't you suggest anything for the killers to go out of their way to get it?
---
… Because they already don't have enough time - even with Ruin - and so you honestly think they should get even less time? I just have no words to describe this idiocy. I would use r e t a   r   d but there's a word filter and if I use that word to describe how incredibly wrong you are then my post won't be seen. Sadly. 
---
Not sure if that’s English or i am just autistic..
---
I dont have enough time to grind out any of the aesthetics and i dont really want to. What i do want is heavily salted meat hanging from my hooks, so i agree with your post. Mikeys gonna be tombstone starin tonight, meatsacks. 
---
but why not just leave?
---
I’ve been getting points on PS4 as killer 
---
I've seen soundcloud too.
---
Prove thyslelf is a monster. Especially if they group. 
---
"waaaah gimmie free escapes please devz WAAAH I DONT WANNA BE HOOKED!!!"
---
I bet you've got disconnects down to muscle memory now. Miss a decisive and d/c in 0.5 seconds.
---
It’s still broken? ;/ Yeah, it’s been broken since the launch of the event. They’re aware, bought it might’ve been fixed by now but I guess not. Hopefully a fix will come asap.
---
What rank are you?
---
Outplayed
---
Are we not going to talk about how OP is really handsome? No?
---
That is an odd add on combo if i do say so myself
---
People found ways to exploit the and AFK farm. Grab a lantern and hide in a locker. The survivors get you gen points and you get a passive gain of points just for holding a lantern
---
Doesn’t give the points currently so ;/
---
They fixed it
---
Legendary
---
That's deep fam.
---
I never claimed there isn't an issua, all I said is that the devs do care
---
they fixed it. no idea why he is not getting points 
---
Who is gonna be camping?
---
It happened to me a few hours ago and haven't played since, just now got around to posting about it
---
Wait, the way you worded it. Does it mean it’s fixed now 👀👀👀 or are you saying until a hotfix is out we still won’t get progress... respond asap vry important
---
Lol you want secondary objectives like Hallowed Blight, which already slowed the game down AND make it even harder? With exhaustion effects and shit in place all over the map? 
---
I think you're joking or crazy. 
---
You don't NEED hex ruin either. Change your play style maybe.
---
As for the Hallowed Blight Event I didn't mind doing the secondary objective of collecting Nectar. I enjoyed the challenge. But it did make the game some would argue unfairly easier for killers and in many cases it also spoiled the game entirely for anyone who wanted to play properly. There was too much farming; DCing; players going to the killer to put them on the hook so they can insta-die. It was annoying as fuck. The cosmetics were great though.
---
This seems like a fair event that does not effect the balance for either side.
---
lmao got em
---
you bet your ass i do. had them down since day 1. What's your point?  It's not like your garbage ass can catch anyone in the first place LOL
---
... if you use tombstone they won't be hanging on your hooks
---
Pick a lane!
---
It's fixed go look at recent posts
---
Nah, it's just being a bitch. Not holding the game hostage. If you were to glitch onto a rock or something like that so the killer can't hit you, that's holding a game hostage. If the killer doesn't have whispers and can't find them it's their own fault. Survivors have to move a certain proximity or they get crows anyways. 
---
haha great, I was about to reply to you. Good thing u noticed!
---
Thank u man
---
Stop while you’re ahead
---
Thanks, now the DBD theme is stuck in my head with that OOF sound. Thank you, you bitch. 
---
As someone with P3 everything and all perks on all killers... the add on grind is real. 
---
Gain a token for each generator that gets completed. When looking at a survivor, lose one token and teleport over to the survivor instantly moriing them
---
small game is one of the most useless yet best perks in dbd
---
That's what you call a trashy hag 
---
Nope, they've always been retarded fast
---
Lol no
---
Just stacking Evil Within, when he gets to level 3 he'll jump through the window and start dancing like no one else
---
Killers need to leave the hook ASAP if they want to get their points by destroying the lanterns... What are you talking about?
---
This idea was well thought. 
---
Where can I find the stream summary?
---
*grabs lantern*
---
*gets hooked*
---
*gets unhooked*
---
*rushes to lantern*

Omg killers tunnel me all game

---
Not necessarily. You disconnected and gave the hatch away, denying him two potential kills.
---
Why tf am I laughing
---
I dont play SWF and it happened to me too. 
---
The hatch spawns when the amount of survivors remaining + 1 gens have been done. So if there is 1 survivor left, 2 gens need to be done. We did all the gens and since I had a dull key, I was able to open the hatch for everyone.
---
DIO
---
Got 2 games in 1hr 30 mins as 2 man Swf.  As solo I find lobbies pretty quick tho.. 
---
Yeah, coldwind tiles are stupid as hell.
---
Remove all Killer skill from general tile loops by giving wall hacks to Survivors nice job BHVR :)
---
Nah that's just baiting them out. 
---
If you encounter the thing mentioned on the card you cross it off. If you get a straight line of 5 in a row you win. 
---
In normal bingo its numbers and they are randomly pulled from a mixed pot of all numbers (1-99 i think) and your cards are randomised
---
Have you placed the camera on a tripod and recorded your TV screen?
---
And how do you expect a rank 18 killer to work towards the objective against full team of Red ranks? He'd probably have a blast playing the event. 
---
Well the tripod could use a little adjusting 
---
"Heh....you made me use 10% of my power."
---
I'm at 7 right now and we just had a face camping killer in 2 back to back games 
---
Lol but seriously that’s a screen recording 😂I just don’t know how to make it not be small
---
But why?
---
Idk how else to export from psn 
---
The Scorching BBQ Event was actually really fun.  It didn't ask you to go out of your way to get something.  It required you to simply do gens and hook survivors.  There was no "SPECIAL CURRENCY."
---
spending points in level 50 bloodwebs on P3 feel worthwhile on characters you "main", especially killers
---
Almost feel like they would make a mime killer instead of cosmetic
---
I had a Billy tunnel me for 5 minutes 1 gen got done as soon as I lost him I did 2 gens 1 alone 1 that a feng min joined half way the killer finally finds another survivor instantly downs them cause they can't run away fsr I get the fourth gen done with a nea I unhook the survivor because teammates didn't want to and then we are stuck in another loop of I'm on the side of the map with no gens running from the killer for 5 minutes while nobody does a gen. He hits me once and loses me because I jumped out the window of a building oh this is in badham preschool btw and used balanced landing he immediately found someone else and downed them I had to go unhook because of the same reason  in the end 1 person dies on hook another is hooked I go for the save hillbilly downs the other comes back to the hook and downed me before I could save because I made a stupid play. Anyways he hooks me person on the hook dies he looks for the one he slugged. Me being the lucky bastard I am I kobe'd off the hook and managed to pick up the other person and escape
---
Welcome to DBD
---
Yeah I think I said in my response and elsewhere I’m not looking for hiding to be bannable, just trying to get the point across that it is still attempting to hold the game hostage and should be considered griefing. 
---
Like I said about your analogies in my previous post, the time wasted is the most annoying part but not why it’s considered taking the game hostage. You are right that at any given point the killer can force you out of the exit gates, and I acknowledged that but the killer cannot decide in an instant to kill or chase you in a hiding scenario. They are forced to search and search and search for a long time until you slip up. 
---
Just like the killer blocking the survivors in the basement, the survivor is making an attempt to prevent the killer from doing their objective while simultaneously refusing to do theirs. The only difference is, as we both know, the killer can eventually find them with great difficulty, which is what distinguishes the two scenarios between bannable and not bannable. 
---
Regardless, my main gripe was that hiding indefinitely or hostage doc should be considered griefing on the pretense of an attempt to take the game hostage. If not punishable to a minor extent then mechanics need to be tweaked or put in place to correctly handle these issues.
---
Not really. It actually makes a difference. They drop more blood, the healing penalty is super annoying considering how many times you heal someone a match. And in solo queue everyone is boosted and still brings self care, people literally spend the time it would take to halfway complete a gen healing themselves in a corner. It makes a difference.
---
Well then. Lol I've been using sandbagging incorrectly for a while. Oops. Thanks for the clarification!
---
Also, Kobe? Pulling yourself off the hook?
---
so the key opens the hatch, can I use the key to just open the hatch from the start?
---
You can plug any USB storage to the console and copy it over ;) 
---
🤔
---
yes lets think of the worst case scenario ffs people who browse new are so dumb. Thats honna happen like 1/100 games.
---
I’m sure for survivors it isn’t that bad but as a killer, fuck this event haha 
---
Mime Outfit for Clown
---
Policeman Outfit for Clown
---
Donald Trump Outfit for the Clown
---
I know, just making a friendly post mate. I'm sure I'll be done in a week. Think it's funny most of us probably started and thought "nice! 100 per coin, this will be easy" then find out it increases by 100 each coin and realise it will take a little longer.
---
Would be nice to have simple threads like this stay friendly now and then without the down-vote cunts jumping on to spoil a laugh and joke but I guess that's impossible here 🙁
---
I was using that one right at least. Thanks again! :)
---
Sorry for incorrect 'there' was in a rush. Also i thought i heard they made some mobile games somewhere.
---
Lol yea that’s the only time they compliment 
---
This is no different from any other event.  It always is like this.  "OMG THIS EVENT IS SO KILLER SIDED" "OMG ITS SO EASY FOR SURVIVORS TO GET THEIR COINS" . Same exact thing every event. 
---
No problem mate, anytime :) what rank you at? 
---
You didn’t lie either 🤧🤧
---
No. It's not. Every single major streamer for DBD agrees that he's terrible for the game and ruins it.
---
you got 28k bp how tf is that losing
---
Not wrong, even as a survivor main I’m looking forward to other survivors getting the ban treatment because they DC when they get downed. It’s part of the damn game. Would hate to see how they progress in other games if it isn’t going their way 
---
For the first coin yes. 
---
2nd coin = 200
---
3th coin = 300
---
Etc.
---
You get them in the blood web
---
The amount of people who are okay with not getting kills is baffling
---
Bc legion cant win without bs tactics /s 
---
No. The mobile game was a Chinese ripoff of DbD where Behavior made some kind of arrangement with the developer. 
---
It comes later on in your blood. Tree
---
I don't see anything wrong with what you said at all either. Yeah you get downvoted for having a different opinion here quite often. This sub tends to be a bit cunty at the best of times
---
Well in my opinion “winning” is killing two or more survivors, but yes I did get a lot of points so the results did not matter
---
Both. Survivor is worse but killer is still pretty bad. Survivor took me 20 minutes and killer took like 7-10 min.
---
Also good idea.
---
I feel like there’s a better chance now than ever that Jason could happen! F13 the game was suspended because of the ongoing lawsuit, but that was settled fairly recently. The winner of the rights to Jason allowed him to be dlc in Mortal Kombat X. I’m sure he would be open to allowing him as dlc in DBD, seeing that other licensed killers have been successfully implemented into the game.
---
Now, I disagree that it will literally never happen, but I would say that it is incredibly unlikely, and here’s why:
---
1. Jason has appeared in 2 games in recent history, and the thrill of him is probably gone for most people
---
2. Jason appeared in a game similar to DbD, so there’s reason to say that if people want to play as Jason, they can just play F13 the game
---
3. This is only based on reddit comments, but it seems like people are burnt out on licensed killers. We already have the majority of the most iconic ones, and the DbD team has made quite a few original killers that are very fun
---
4. Licensed killers can’t be purchased through playtime, and a lot of people probably save up on their shards so they can buy the next content
---
What I’d really like would be a remodel of Freddy, where they use the classic Freddy, not the failed reboot. When I’m playing against Freddy, I don’t feel like I’m playing against THE Freddy like I do with Michael. I feel like I’m being chased by just some old man.
---
Legion... Skill... Ha
---
Yeah SB is not overrated IMO.  Any extra time away from gens is worth it,  plus if they get sick of it they will just stop healing which results in quicker downs. 
---
On a different note, why are you facing a level 7 survivor? 
---
there were 5 gens remaining?
---
Because if you dont get a kill as Legion that means you actually played fair and tried using their power to split pressure instead of tunneling one person. If you tunnel one person of course they arent gonna compliment your skills because theres no skill in doing that
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
---
It's not much
---
So much great stuff going on here.
---
I think I have played again a Luc and Cows as Wraith...
---
But I have never been named Brayden... Hmm..
---
Odd, maybe it's gotten worse since I played. I played about 30 mins after the event started.
---
I totally enjoy wanting to play with friends and wait 15+ minutes for a game just to get a 300 Ping Lobby. 
---
I'm confused, event's usually have some way of giving you more bloodpoints when you burn an offering. How does this work here? Do I have to survive with the lantern? 
---
I never survive. This is going to suck.
---
Scumbag SWF groups have one guy stay in ranks 20-16 so they get new killers when they team up with him. Just another flaw of the rank system
---
You must have read it wrong.
---
The hatch is extremely shitty on both sides
---
I love the DbD team! They have their bumps here and there, but they really listen to the people that play their games. 
---
That's how things should work. If we only consider best case scenarios, we will never see any problems. Worst case should also be acceptable. 
---
&gt;Thats honna happen like 1/100 games.
---
At least 1% of games will be completely unfair. There are also cases of Red rank killer vs yellow/grey rank survivors or Yellow killer vs Red ranks, that are also classified as unfair. So that's about a 4% total, right. One in every 25 games. This is a lot. 
---
im a simple man. i see smol billy. i upvote
---
Yea I kesjt points
---
They still didn't fix the interactions and invisibility bug, so I can't play the event. Nice!
---
Join lobby
---
Wait 10 minutes to load up
---
Killer dodges because one of your randoms has one piece of bloody clothing on laurie/claudette.
---
*The console event experience*
---
Why are killersndoing coldwind offerings and facecamping? I dont understand the objective
---
Yeah, this is terrible. I'm just going around doing gens like a normal game and every game there are one or two running around to get a lantern then hiding.
---
They should've made it where if the lanterns get out everyone gets points who also made it or something. It's just stupid as is. "Let's put a limited number in there and make survivors fight over it!"
---
&gt;Regardless, my main gripe was that hiding indefinitely or hostage doc should be considered griefing
---
I agree with this but not with attempting to take the game hostage since, as I've said many times, taking a game hostage *must* have the element that the other side has *no chance* to end the game. There's a huge difference between making it difficult to win and making it impossible. I understand that in the Survivor's mind they want to never get found and waste the Killer's time until they DC. But since the Killer *can* find them it's not taking the game hostage.
---
Refusing to attempt to win just out of spite and to ruin the other player's experience should be considered a form of griefing and should receive some sort of punishment. But, as you said, the mechanics should be tweaked to prevent it from happening in the first place.
---
It’s okay. You live and you learn 
---
We can it was just not funny
---
this was my first game. im having a blast!!!!
---
Thanks, now the DBD theme is stuck in my head with that OOF sound. Thank you, you bitch.
---
I actually was taking a break during the last even! Would you mind explaining how the flower stuff worked?
---
Everybody's playing survivor because they feel it's easier to complete the event that way.  Less Killers=Longer Queues. 
---
You can get 5 gens done in under 4 minutes with that, if not less. It's ridiculously overpowered
---
can a youtuber do a public service announcement and let everyone know self care sucks ass now? So sick of idiot claudettes spending a minute healing in the corner only to get hit immediately because they positioned themselves poorly in a corner.
---
Gotta ask, is a kobe saving the last person or unhooking themself?
---
haha if you see my perk choices you'd get why :p I don't have much on my killers on PC yet. I was an Xbox player until a week ago.
---
I bet that huntress never even attempted to throw a hatchet and just bloodlusted you
---
Okay thanks for the tip.
---
TOXICITY RATE REDUCED TO 0%
---
Who the hell brings a mori I bring devour but I only use it if you let me get to 5 stacks and the 6 survivor games I played today not 1 mori seems you are just unlucky
---
hit the first one, then looped and juked her for a good 3 mins after then face camped me and the next survivor lmao
---
If you mean angle it around a wall that's different. That's just Survivor using their 3rd person pov to their advantage.
---
The problem with coldwind is that you can see through the walls so Killer mindgames are non-existent.
---
They definitely need to change the tile textures. It's fine if you can see through *some* parts of the wall (like the slits of the closed off window in shack) but it's not ok to see through every part of the wall.
---
Okay I'll try to mix things up.
---
There are times where it isn't your fault. Like when you have a teammate in the middle of a chase run to the basement, but later you get caught and don't get save d until the start of stage two. Then as you get healed, your teammate fails that skillful leading the killer directly to you. Finally that survivor who ran directly to the basement used up all of the pallets while you were doing gens. Totally not talking about experience.
---
Poor Anna didn’t mean to insult her
---
It’s the cycle of, like, salt bro. *hits blunt*
---
I do, yes.
---
*confused screaming*
---
During the Hallowed Blight, if you and your friends had all completed the vials then nobody could interact with the pustules. This meant no bonus BP for survivors and no survivors burning offerings for the killer...
---
Okay but do the always spawn in the same location?
---
I find it funny how Killer loading times on PC are bad, and on console survivor loading times are bad. 
---
Its funny because its true
---
I'm pretty casual. The lowest survivor rank I've made it down to was 8. I'm survivor 11 and killer 15 right now. 
---
My usual friends have all been busy lately so I'm trying for my adept killer trophies. It's also a good chance to try killers I don't normally use. 
---
How about you?
---
I hate it
---
I’VE NEVER QUIT, NOT EVEN ONCE. I’M DOING IT WRONG, I GUESS!!
---
I know your pain :( I swear 90% of those selfish players are Claudette. Crouching around the map with their P3 clothes, waiting for someone to get hit then do gens.
---
Really can’t tell how much I hate them no matter I’m playing as survivor or killer, they like to teabag in front of the pallet, clicking flashlight trying to irritate you, etc.
---
Try to remember their names and bring a mori to them when you see them again.
---
To watch 15 year olds jack off BHVR's ego, mostly.

Only 3 items to get with the moonrise?
---
Console matchmaking is another problem in which the devs try to fix the situation.
---
They have solved the problem of the event, for the problem of matchmaking we must wait.
---
how to bury a dead joke
---
Hey quick question. What we can get with this event? What kind of skin? 'Cause im having exams and i can't play it, but if there are something gold maybe i can find one or two hours to play in this event
---
I'm one of those people. I'm okay with not getting kills, it really doesn't bother me. I just like to play &amp; I like to get bp. I got a few 4ks the other day and it was kind of exciting, but ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
How i feel as claudette 
---
you still get 12 points I guess since 3 gens were done. Even if you didnt do them yourself.
---
nice video, nice editing, ur funny but i gotta downvote because sweden
---
Maybe because the points for killer are shit. It's less than 10 for destroying a lantern.
---
This is so great. I love it.
---
Loosing 
---
Gideon Kramer was to be born in this year...
---
Old.
---
Ahh so I guess I'll just have to learn how to dodge SWFs (if possible). Thanks
---
This is an actual game on ROBLOX, which makes this much worse.
---
hm really? figured the game is just bugged
---
you cant really win or lose in this game since it all depends on peps and bloodpoints. so you did win
---
Thank you :)
---
Wait everyone gets the points for gens?
---
well it doesnt rly matter if u get a lot of bp
---
If I was hurting for points I would obviously do that, but I like to finish what I started. To each his own salty boi.
---
"What the hell???"
---
I’m on 40 min for a match lol this is ridiculous 
---
Yep. Wait times are hideous at the moment. 
---
I was expecting immediate lobby connections with more players in the pool. Something ain't right. 
---
deserved
---
&gt;NOED "can" be used even if I do not usually run it on them. 
---
NOED is as useless on him as his 110% run speed. I can't figure out why you're recommending this when you say not to cancel out of Frenzy because he's too slow just before.
---
Right now
---
No one expects unrelenting!
---
So many killers dcing when gens get done. With only 1 event offering per web i dont think you can gain much bp this event.
---
Maybe if the matchmaking worked I WOULD GET A CHANCE TO TRY IT
---
As trapper I sometimes I gather all my traps from around the map and put them in one place, then I like to find survivors and down them so that I can show them my trap collection.
---
Laugh while you can
---
Buckle up chucklefucks, moonrise is here and so are teabags and disconnects 
---
...I'm not lying, that is the build that he was using. And it was effective. I thought that Dying light did effect the exit door time but was unable to verify this as I was only able to open the exit gate about 5% of the way. Apparently I was mistaken which makes me a filthy liar. Excuse me. 
---
Unfortunate
---
That’s just immature players showing off their stupidly. 
---
Lol you're a joke.  Probably a camper too
---
This is so sad Alexa play for whom the bell tolls by Metallica 
---
It's funny because it's clearly the least fair realm since the release and bhvr still have done nothing about it
---
I use it all the time. Super useful perk.
---
This post has inspired me. 
---
Time to use the 35 ebony moris I have collectively.
---
If one survivor escapes with a lantern, does every other survivor get 25+? I somehow got the generator points and the lantern point when it wasn’t me who took a lantern away. 
---
It's working now!
---
Is it a space issues?
---
I always run borrowed time and adrenaline. I run into it quite often too
---
This event really sucks for survivor.  You seriously lose the stuff upon your first hook for the rest of the game and can't get it back unless someone miraculously didn't grab one?
---
Well, some of us actually come here to try and have a discussion about things rather than look at braindead memes.
---
Indifferent 
---
They have now fixed the glitch so you're good. :)
---
oki ty :3
---
Tomorrow? It's already kicked off!
---
its about forming a moral dilemma for the killers and survivors alike. 
---
This event promotes the most selfish and sandbagging behavior I have seen to date.  I gurantee BHVR's data will show decreased escape rates across all ranks, as survivors are surface-level incentized to be less altruistic and team-oriented, even though doing gens and working together would net more gold coins in the long run.  
---
Is there no alternative to this where the survivors are rewarded for the TOTAL amount of lunar vessels with which the team escapes?
---
well, true! but thats more of a mental achievement thing. its not really about the game telling u you've won or lost u know
---
I’m the cat.
---
I hate them as both survivor and killer too lol
---
If anyone is going to hatch camp it's always a Claudette. They pick the character thats hard to see fot a reason.
---
I use Bond a lot and if I see a claudette I'll lead the killer to them without a shred of guilt. Its the only way to get them to help the team.
---
Good. I have around 50 Halloween offerings that are completely useless
---
the vessel aura makes you able to be seen if youre in a locker or behind a crouch level cover too. The little embers give you away, so you want to pick it up right before you leave
---
