Don't play it
---
---
---
this is why i wish they could have picked up the og nightmare on elm street. nancy would have been way preferable to quentin imo. i say that just because that remake was terrible, the vibe was super removed from the original and the characters didn’t have the same depth
---
I honestly don't know
---
Pretty! Good job!
---
Me but hitting a bowl
---
bruh what are you talking about
---
Poor otz dude, he didn't deserve it
---
:D
---
Make it have a delayed animation, moving around every couple of steps/secs
---
I'm relatively new, but what I got is
---
-You gotta be patient, and learn when the survivors dodging your hatchets are going into a rhythm
---
-when you know the survivor is forced to drop a pallet, respect it and wind up a hatchet, ez hit when they drop it and stuck in the animation
---
-exhaustion addons are the best, berus toxin is not much worse than that green addon since in a chase the survivor will be running a lot, and you will end chases guicker than 90 seconds most of the time
---
-discordance sucks because that notification spam doesn't allow you to snipe ppl off gens
---
-barbecue and bitter murmur are great on the other hand, also whispers is literally the best perkfor huntress, since the survivors hear your lullaby from faraway and can either run or hide, and you don't have to look where no one is
---
-iridescent heads suck
---
-slowdown perks are also vital. I suggest ruin (obvious) or corrupt intervention for that security on 3 gens and also it will force them to either come closer to you or waste their time.
---
-huntress is very map-dependant, i for example just dc on lerys and haddonfield because they are so broken
---
-you can throw hatchers through the ironworks of misery (MacMillan) windows (on the top floor)
---
what
---
Dude I have no idea, I hooked someone and then this happened
---
If you think wraith is overpowered you need to uninstall this game
---
Dead by Daylight...
---
Found the rank 17.
---
Basically it just says oh this is why pennywise should be added and mentions dan
---
thanks for clarifying, now what are you talking about?
---
I think you meant Jeffery Epstein? You know, that guy who got murdered?

It’s not even a typo. They’re just interpreting it wrong.

It’s not the only good thing about him.

Nah, not from Tru3. Im playing him this way since day 1. Stalk has always been just a bonus, the power is the Night Shroud. And yeah, Im afraid some of these could be too good, but thats why I just made them for fun.

Yeah I didnt think of it before but an activation requirement is probably needed heavily. But that's the point of posting it I guess lol.

What killer even goes invisible? Oh nah you aint talking bout wraith are you....

I cant.... I wish i could. We dont need no damn updates... LMAO

Sounds nice. Like the idea. Maybe you should change the last part though. I feel like you should add a longer timer depending on the rarity.

You can use it to talk about the game or shit you know like humans do if you don’t like people being mean just leave the game

To the people saying ruw grind is fine, you most likely have everything already or friends to play with. I've played since the beginning. Double blood points should be normal. Just double baseline BP, or at bare minimum 1.5X normal. New players who might get into the game are often halted because of the insane investment of time to just catch up to other abilities. Skill will still come with experience but if players dont stay long enough they wont gain skill and will quit.
---
What is Wrap Speed Wraith?
---
Lol ok, so just make haunted ground, devour hope, tier 3 myers and ghostface useless.   Of course this perk would require mending if it were implemented. Otherwise you're just immune to exposed.
---
https://youtu.be/jKhCWvtY-wQ
---
The mending thing I think needs to be there. It's probably still too strong ad I totally overlooked that this would just completely counter exposed with no counterplay which is bad design
---
Hill billy with the chainsaw that you can hear across the map. When you on that generator and hear that chainsaw, you know you are fucked...
---
Ohhh something to watch while my antibiotics kick in thank you
---
Oh boy you haven't been to this ---&gt; r/dbdgonewild &lt;--- side of the internet have you
---
I had the timer be the changing thing originally but I didnt want to have 2 parts of it be effected by tier. 
---
I'm still working on what the second part could be and still feel good
---
This is exactly my point. The grind is totally fine if you are someone who plays regularly, but there is no reason to make this so hard on newer players. Especially when the top perks are often spread between multiple killers and survivors so you need to level many characters so get them (and then obviously get them to appear in the bloodwebs).
---
Hardcore players can still grind for Prestige or all perks on all characters unlocked or stuff like that.
---
Hey huntress main here, just for any clarification the only killer that can go invisible is the Wraith. Unfortunately the Wraith is bottom tier.
---
You know you can use spine chill, right?
---
I’m a survivor main and Wraith is usually one of the easiest to go against.
---
Also he’s called Bing Bong Boi for a reason. Listen for his bell, yo’.
---
 Videos like this make my pussy so hard 😩🌮💪
---
Just because he gave permission doesn't mean it will happen though. It's not really his decision.
---
This game plays way better on pro.
---
Finally an honest answer
---
Imagine thinking stealth killers are OP
---
Thank you! That's what I thought but wasn't sure.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah it may need a bit more to it as well as it may be too good at countering exposed. But at the same time maybe that's needed. Unsure as of yet
---
This sounds like an inside job by plague mains to get survivors to never cleanse. Ain't gonna work on me, fools!
---
Yes, Q and E are bound to turn left/right so I can play billy
---
Bug?
---
I mean, I suck at flashlight saves and use odd bulb to blind killers at pallets and sneak away with iron will because the blind lasts longer with odd bulb.
---
Just depends, obviously dont run half way across the map but if the clocks close enough ill spend 30 seconds going for it
---
The one where the killers are really close to the screen and you can only see their heads
---

---
The horror game with Labron and the sprite is still haunting me.
---
😭
---
How does this glitch happen
---
I’ve said it before, survivors don’t see it that way, hit boxes really don’t matter when the survivor can’t move because of lag
---
That’s how it’s been for me lately. Takes forever. I’m only rank 16 though because I didn’t play killer for quite a bit. Didn’t used to be THIS long. Sometimes I go downstairs and get food and it’s still searching.
---
I’ve been getting these kinds of games so much lately qq
---
I’ll counter that downvote for you mate, you’re talking fair
---
Make a meme
---
basically, when dedicated servers first came out his stalking was like, server sided or smth instead of client sided, so it was super delayed and fucked up. It basically made his stalking unusable, but they seem to have fixed that now.
---
OH NO YOU DONT
---
FLASHLIGHTU SAVE

*gets skill check when downed*

Wait, this wasn’t meant to happen...

Skill check curse is real, spread awareness.

i had no idea it was even a thing. lol. i was just like "oh shit, i think i die here. wtf?"
---
&amp;#x200B;

and then after the realization i was like aight, thats kinda sweet
---
That way your head cosmetic is actually something you can look at.
---
Excellent editing of what was already a masterpiece.
---
Thank you!!!
---
A lot of games have this ability to OPT into crossplay, boom problem solved.
---
Dont want to play pc players then toggle it off.
---
Ayyy. What a champion haha :D
---
Upvote for Link
---
Or you just play and have fun, not caring to have a streak
---
It’s a regular occurrence for me. I just laugh at them and say GG.
---
The biggest reason it's easy to rank up with him is because 2 out of 4 categories are based on hitting survivors.
---
It's called feedback
---
I got to rank 6 as trapper
---
Turns out, they were healing you to sandbag you

That fucking smile

Patch 2.7.0, May 7th
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused The Legion's Nasty and Filthy Blade add-ons to stack, causing extremely long Mending times.
---
There is an option to turn off cross-play between Steam and Windows Store so why not like... do the same with consoles?
---
Hey, she can consent. She probably wouldn't, but she could, and that's what matters.
---
I don't understand why this guy is such a big meme around here.
---
Please introduce me to them
---
Cool. Now i can play with 5 more people.
---
That’s me with the plague. I like the whispers.
---
I AM SICK OF DEDICATED SERVERS FORCING ME TO DISCONNECT FROM THE MATCH I WAS PLAYING AND CAUSING ME TO DE-PIP.
---
Random Question: How does one actually flip the killer to face the front on console like that?
---
If you go to second state you can still survive if you play smart. Stop being toxic just play the game out and get a pip
---
#FUNNNYYYYYYYY JOKE
---
I was gonna talk about the three P3 Claudettes I just played against on Swamp lol
---
Stupid question: you can’t accomplish the Tome quests in KYF, can you?
---
best comment here tbh
---
Nop
---
I’ve been a huntress main for almost a year and a half, she can be played on any map because she’s viable, that’s not to say playing her on that map will be easy, enjoyable or fun...
---
I did this last night. Had a challenge to kick gens and only needed one more. 
---
Start up a game as wraith, go in, kick gen, game over for me. Too bad the survivors thought I was a baby killer since I was just running around cloaked and kicking gens. Ended up with a 4K
---
Im toxic and have been trying to get messages from people saying im tunneling but it hasnt happed so far which is hilarious cause my one friend avoids tunneling but gets messages all the time so idk whats wrong
---
Purple too. Dcs as far as the eye can see.
---
Ah too relatable
---
Me... console player looking on...
---
:*( ... wish I didnt have to HAND MASH A CONTROLLER BUTTON
---
All they would have to do is to make it more clear that killers can do it. I think there should be more spots like that in which you can utilize lunge for more than just hitting survivors. It could even make Unrelenting meta in similar way how some people call Bamboozle meta because it can cancel some of the strongest looping spots. (although I still wish they were to bump up Unrelenting's number to be equal of STBFL, at the very least let us test it during some PTB)
---
&gt;surge enabling builds
---
Is that an omegalul? Surge is worthless. What builds does that enable? I mentioned 4 out of 17 who had worthles perks, but if u want i can lay out everyone elses garbage who only has 1 perk worth using like hillbilly
---
How about yes?
---
Because it’s a horror game. Can’t believe I’m using this cliché but the killer is meant to be the power role.
---
Most are easy to avoid and add some tension.
---
Haunted Grounds, Make your choice - Last for 60 seconds and very easy to stealth around
---
Devour hope - often cleansed before active
---
Myers - limited duration, easy to stealth around
---
It adds some tension but can be easy to play around. The only instadowns that feel BS are noed and hillbilly imo
---
The odd instaheal wasnt an issue but im guessing swf squads with multiple instaheals and co-ordination is a big part of why they got nerfed.
---
Console meta is pretty much the same as PC.
---
You get DS, BT, DH and Adrenaline.
---
Same goes for Killer really, BBQ, Ruin, Nurses Calling, ect
---
Love the style of this!! And so relatable too ;(
---
It is too hard for them to support 2 meta's at once. But I agree with you, console nurse didn't deserve a nerf
---
this is gold
---
Thank you so much! 
---
Drawing this is like a coping mechanism lol, I’ve been betrayed by those two too many times!
---
Ima be honest, this is a PC game, the other releases are ports. You shouldnt be expecting them to create two totally seperate meta balances.
---
Then you get to complain about the tunneling killer when you run straight into them after being unhooked bc you don't know where they are.
---
Nah Nurses are hot garbage on Console. I run loops around BBQ Nurses for fun.
---
I'd say so.
---
I think you keep it, it’s only fair
---
I could of said 1000* and you'd still make up anything.
---
swap your download region
---
Ight
---
you would probably keep everything you've got and if there were survivors coming out, probably as a single dlc.
---
Wraith? OP? 
---
Just run spine chill.
---
besides, you can hear his footsteps really easily, you just need earphones.
---
haha, A+ for shitty drawing!
---
Except of Iri Head from huntress the insta downs are fine and an important part of the killers power.
---
Taking it away from michael, GF, billy etc... would need a complete rework of their power, which is not going to happen and also not needed.
---
What you are describing is exactly what you're crying about.  We shouldn't have any counters and you shouldn't have to worry about counter play?
---
oh, I thought you were talking about the perk meta. my bad
---
i’m specifically talking about addons my guy
---
Nah but if you were higher than me I'd have backed off
---
i’m clearly talking about addons
---
Nurses Calling, u idiot.
---
What other addons with an insta down except of iri head are there?
---
Not trying to be rude, but the correct spelling is
---
They're* trying, but definitely not their* best
---
Yeah I was trying to bodyblock for this Kate earlier today and accidentally blocked her and got her downed when trying to cut off the killer.
---
Teabagging and pointing led me to be not only a Spirit Main. But a Gen Grabber Build Spirit with the new Devil Skin. I went all in and I’m not ashamed
---
The only things he needs is a cure for the suds
---
I actually agree with OP, what if you have deliverance ready and decisive and dead hard or sprint burst or something, and you know where the hatch is? You don’t even get a chance? I think it’s dumb..
---
redheads pinky, honing stone, and judiths tombstone
---
My man Ghost Face punching the air right now

You mean doing the objective?

I play killer only btw, so I'm not been biased.

I highly recommend plague, she has very unique gameplay and its a very interesting playstyle
---
Such an Old Repost
---
I really dont know either.  I literally never knew about him until the memes. His content seems average at best . He talks alot about his thought process when he plays the games , but whenever he tries to predict what a survivor does   90% is he wrong lol.    Personally dont like the play by play commentary when watch someone play.
---
Agreed
---
The problem with Spirit is that she's brain-dead piss easy to play. I wouldn't say that she *exclusively* "carries less skilled players" but the problem with Spirit versus the likes of Nurse or Billy is that you don't need a lick of mechanical knowledge to play Spirit when compared to Nurse or Billy. Billy you've gotta learn how to control the chainsaw and Nurse you've gotta learn how to blink. Spirit you've gotta spend $200 on a gaming headset and unlock Stridor.
---
No one wants to admit they main spirit, lol.
---
Was this on Xbox?
---
It's good for beginners but you should stop if you get most predictions wrong. I predict okay-ish. Can't juke yet.
---
...what?
---
Found the brand new player KEKW
---
Secco Demogorgon
---
Unlike other multiplayer games where it will just lag you back into place if your connection drops for a second, or even less, and keep on playing this game drops you entirely with no reconnection. You need a constant internet connection any bumps at all will drop you.
---
I have it often happen to me and theres really nothing you can do about it. I changed out my cat6 cable and ran a new one and it just turns out that comcast decides to have a bump for a quick second, so little that my connection doesn't even change in windows settings, but the game detects that you werent 100% connected and drops you.
---
im saying that if RD2 said no pc wont be getting some options, they are console only, it is fair because it is a console game, like the other person said you are comparing a AAA game with thousands of workers to DBD with like fucking 2 lol
---
Details. Everything else doesn't do much
---
Am I doing anything wrong or is ranking up with survivor stupidly hard?
---
Been stuck at rank 4 with 4 pips for a few days already.
---
I just want the achievement so I can stop caring :/
---
It was apparently never bugged, just so negligible  you couldn’t tell. Basically the chili add-ons make you get to “top speed” faster so like after your first chainsaw swipe the next one would be a little faster and a little faster but you don’t actually move faster you just spend more time at your max speed during a chainsaw dash
---
New clown skin is just Otz
---
Not sure that they'd need that. I play on Windows Store version of DBD via gamepass and I just cross-played with a Quentin who was on Steam, Quentin isn't available in the Windows Store version. Freddy and Quentin are the only two missing here, leatherface is in here. 
---
So perhaps it's possible to still engage with these characters on platforms that don't yet have them, the licensing just may forbid purchases of them on a specific platform?
---
Okay cool that’s the one I settled on after playing with it for a while. Really makes the game look x100 times better. Vignette is pretty useless, but looks cool if you reduce the intensity a bit
---
I always forget that Nvidia has fancy shit like this, thanks for reminding me to actually use my expensive Graphics Card to its full potential lmao
---
Personally, I'm super into the Doctor. I can't say how difficult he would be since I used to watch a lot of videos so I had a bit of a handle on him before I even started to play. From what I know though, he's very based on multitasking and knowing when to switch from Punishment/Treatment. At least for me, it keeps me somewhat on my toes on if I should work with tiers or go for the hit.
---
(My wording may be a bit off - work kicked my ass but hopefully you got what I was saying!)

Jane is also an artist, and maybe Adam if you consider photography?

Ah I see, ok
---
3.6 roentgen, not great not terrible
---
IIRC, she's trying to do a trick shot and bounce it off the ground into the target
---
MMMMM this just entered a new level of cursed.
---
60 seconds from *everyone* already loading in makes it pretty obvious its a trapper. Right now if its a long loading screen its just someone has a shit PC or they dced. Now if its a shit pc AND  trapper then people may just leave the loading screen.
---
Anyway to comment on the trapper, fuck both of those additions to trapping windows and lockers, steps way to much on bamboozle and iron maidens toes.
---
Also i dont like the RTS prep, make it just that he loads in first and can trap around wherever he can get in 60 seconds, then randomly selects the spawns.
---
I do understand thank you
---
Will look into that thank you
---
RIP no nut November
---
there has been so many games where i am right about to thow my mouse through my monitor  
---
Usually when a shit ass BM player gg ez's me
---
 But think about it. Demogorgon isn't much sentient and already can barely understand shit, so the other killers like Anna could easily control him. Not to mention he's thick as FUCK
---
It was
---
Mama, The game had just begun
---
The argument is that this game is just that good. Theres nothing out there with as much replayability and variety of experience. Truth is they remember the worst experience like facecamp the most. But most of the time the game is great
---
Sounds like a rank 20 Legion, he by far has the easiest first hit in the game to get, period. He fast vaults windows, pallets, and sprints at almost 200% speed if not more, has a fast recovery, and when he hits people it shows exactly where other survivors are. He by far is the easiest killer to hit people with.
---
1) trapped lockers and windows is an optional addition, they can be either an add-on or just don't exist lol
---
2) that's the point, survivors must feel unsafe and they must be concentrated not to fall into traps. Sometimes this will feel unfair, but it us still possible to locate all traps and disarm them.
---
If you are looking to improve with killer I recommend Otzdarva or if you want both perspectives Tru3Talent is really good
---
FUN GOOSE, he's a looping god!
---
Actually the telekinetic push power would be an incredible idea for a nurse rework, and already fits within what she can do in-game.
---
Truetalent and otzdarva are my top two. High rank players with different styles. Much to learn.
---
Ruin. Bbq. Nurses Calling. Wildcard.
---
It will take time, be patient. Start by running no add ons when you first play her. Find out what addons you like later after you have mastered her base ability.
---
Would you want to stick your dick in a monster/have a monster stick their dick in you in general?
---
I’m really good but that’s why I don’t want to rank up I know I’ll be up against so much toxicity

*Cries in console*
---
Im open to feedback and ideas
---
I pretty much use BBQ, Thrilling tremors, Pop on every killer then I rotate the last perk for nurses, haunted grounds, devour hope, monitor depending upon on the killer
---
trust me man, if i thought fetishizing a vomiting undead priestess was new, you'd be talking to a different person
---
oink oink
---
Aww it's so cute
---
Otzdarva tbh
---
if you would be willing to move off streams, ohtofu has some good youtube videos where he takes submissions and reviews them, i found them to be very helpful
---
IDK how it breaks Mirror Michael. Mirror Michael already had an 8 meter Terror Radius which for all extensive purposes was essentially invisible. What's more is that he couldn't be revealed by aura reading perks in Tier 1 anyways.
---
If anything the Undetectable change was a nerf for Myers since he can be seen by Spine Chill. But at least now you can run Distressing on Tier 1 Myers if you really need to farm.
---
He got **69** 000 blood points
---
The power kinda just sounds like demos portals, or am I missing something?
---
Mmm yes very descriptive.
---
Does thrilling not conflict with pop tho?
---
Thank you for all the advice. I'll definitely look into a lot of this
---
I'M SO FUCKING SICK OF FLASHLIGHT SAVES, FPS ISSUES ON THE XBOX, ONLY THREE KILLER BEING FUCKING VIABLE AT HIGH RANKS, SURVIVORS WITH OP PERKS LIKE DECISIVE STRIKE, UNBALANACED MAPS, SHITTY KILLER POWERS/ADDONS, AND NO FUCKING FIXES IN SIGHT BECAUSE NEW CONTENT TAKES PRIORITY
---
I WANT TO PLAY KILLERS OTHER THAN SPIRIT AND HILLBILLY JUST TO HAVE A CHANCE AT HIGH RANKS
---
Otzdarva and Fungoose on Twitch. Ohtofu also has some good videos on YouTube.
---
But a killer that starts with that much map pressure is pretty unbalanced if you compare it to any other killer. Especially if you tie add-ons similar to diamond and Iridescent stone.
---
I’ve always talked and brainstormed different trapper reworks, the add-ons debuff removal was a start, carrying unlimited traps and being able to re-arm them on the ground would be the only thing I’d ask for. 
---
Other than that I’d probably rather play against spirit with prayer beads and MD Ring rather than a trapper with this much power.
---
Guys calm down. Its a community tier list. If I give nurse a 1 star rating and you give a 5 star rating, then it’ll average out to a 3. 
---
It’s literally based on what individuals like. Its an average. Its not official.
---
It is sort of like demo portals, addons would probably make a difference though
---
...not helpful dude.
---
Lol tofu.. ok I can't take you seriously
---
You can still do it solo but it requires that the other person knows it too. In solo now its a dice roll, but for you to have a chance to win the dice roll you have to play the game. I normally just trade places everytime. I go for the safe unhook but if the killer is camping i dont mind trading places. Sometimes we make it sometimes we dont.
---
 If you truly hate facecamp, then it might make you happy to save people from it?
---
Experience in this game thought me to focus on your own play not the killer or fellow survivor. They can do what they want,they dont owe me anything. At the end of the day theres more nice than there is bad
---
Gotta be Clown. Nothing could produce such an eerie sound if not his belly, nothing.
---
Thanks. If you have any ideas tell me

Anything rereleased would just be a content update see freddy for more details

I apologized in end game chat and she was really cool about it lol. If she wasn’t I would have taken the verbal beating because I fucked up XD.
---
Exactly. Survivor runs meta perks with purple flashlights and their friends on Discord while they tea bag the killer at every single pallet and that's fine. Killer runs Hex: Ruin and suddenly the end game chat explodes with salt from pissy survivors screeching about any slight inconvenience. 
---
I've said it before, the killers not there to be your friend, help you find the hatch, or make sure you have fun. The killers there to kill.
---
Oh I just made it in ms paint really quick. Didn’t know it was a repost
---
I dunno, the pier in Grim Pantry is a huge time waster for the killer if you know how to use the ridiculously strong window and the multiple pallets. BL makes it even stronger.
---
The new Freddy is so much fun to play as and against. 
---
I kinda miss the old kit though
---
Awaken if it's nearby or before you start on gen. Freddy gets additional slowdown the more people are asleep.
---
I need this build. Give it to me -_-
---
Like r/solipsism if it took its meds
---
I think most of it is very good but I feel that the effigies shouldn’t be as tall as a survivor, that would make it way to easy to spot unless you hide it behind a rock or corn fields. I’m not saying it be as short per say as a totem but not as tall as a survivor. Also make them not wooden texture maybe a mud and wooden texture so again it’s a little less easy to spot.
---
weird flex but ok
---
Can I get the source image for this?
---
Nice
---
We live in one.
---
Not very often, but if it blocks off an almost finished generator I wait to pop it. Otherwise it shows me a generator that definitely needs popped because someones on it. And if it's blocked and I see someone crouched right next to it on bbq I know that generator needs regressed because they're most likely trying to finish it. I play around the 1 min cooldown so if I'm about to hook someone and the cooldown is about to finish I just drop and pick em up next to the hook to genblock
---
I HAVE SPENT 8 FUCKING GAMES TRYING TO DO THIS DAMN “OPEN AN EXIT GATE” DAILY BUT THE ONLY TIMES I DON’T END UP WITH POTATO TEAMMATES THEY’RE ON THE SWITCHES BEFORE I GET TO THEM.  I JUST DIED BECAUSE I ABANDONED THE OPEN DOOR TO TRY TO OPEN THE OTHER ONE ONLY TO BE YANKED OFF THE SWITCH BY A SPIRIT.  JUST LET ME OPEN THE DAMN DOOR I’LL LET YOU KILL ME AFTER.  YOU WATCHED ME ABANDON THE OTHER ONE WHAT DID YOU THINK I WAS DOING?
---
AND OF COURSE I HAVE TO DO IT ON MY LEVEL ONE LAURIE FUCKING STRODE, WHO HAS LITERALLY NONE OF THE PERKS THAT HELP ME GET TO ENDGAME EXCEPT A LEVEL 1 DS THAT ALL THE KILLERS KNOW TO FUCKING WAIT FOR.
---
This looks so good!! I just love the art style. :)
---
May the old kit RIP😪
---
I say simply make it so you always hear the wishing sound even when inside her terror radius
---
Happy Cake Day!! :D
---
Was about to say that. Recently I got my first flashlight save ever, vs a leatherface. Not a good time.
---
Ok, good idea actually.
---
Cry for help*
---
*everyone escapes flawlessly*
---
I'm a survivor main and most of the time survivors are just unlucky and end up running into the killer the whole game. We just salty lol. You can always just be toxic back and reply with "it's only cuz I love you" lol
---
If anyone wants to draw him, fine by me
---
Some add-ons can remove his ability to place traps during preparation though. And why do you think this would be overpowered if he is not using red addons? This would be strong indeed, but not overpowered
---
Who cares about being injured lmao
---
you did, those are datamined from the files
---
If you have it, flaunt it
---
Pig doesnt need any game slowdown perks as she's already built in with one. I focus on perks that help me in chases (enduring, brutal strength, I'm all ears, etc.) since most of the time as pig you're chasing down survivors to give them a hat.
---
Whispers is great for locating survivors while staying stealth (crouched). OhTofu has a great video explaining that perk.
---
Save the best for last really helps with Pig as well.
---
Td;rl running slow down perks is overkill and unnecessary. Focus on chase perks and utilizing her dash attack.
---
Lmao of course it does. I’d expect nothing less from reddit. It’s more of a way for me to gauge how good I’m actually doing and how good the build is from other solid rank 1 killers. But everyone who has nothing to say has to chime in and tell me to quit bragging and play for fun. Bye.
---
Well played! How did the rest of the match go? Also feels bad man for your STBFL
---
Gimme the build
---
Just like there’s a 4% chance to Kobe right?
---
I will give you the build. Under 1 condition. 
---
You must guess my second favorite killer
---
Yeah I feel that it would give him a much stronger and more viable kit on certain maps
---
this is just you posting the same thing twice, like a photographer putting out the same work with a different filter.
---
if your drive is almost full steam doesnt download files properly
---
Nope idc anymore... defend them all you want but weve seen so many fucking companies do shit the right way that im willing to bet theres some greed going on within bhvr. Theres no way theyre putting out as many skins as they are and still struggling. Just fucking hire more devs or focus on the health of the game before the next 70,000 skins pls. Dbd has been in an unfun state(for playing survivor) for about a year now or whenever the fuck they made it so hitting a survivor with m1 is innevitable no matter how much of a potato you are. 
---
Then came the hitbox issue which made it unplayable
---
Then came dedicated servers and im shocked people still play this fucking game. Its A Disease It really is.
---
What the actual hell
---
Exactly. Honestly, the game should be so much more polished by now. Hell, we could've maybe even had a new game mode.
---
Imagine thinking that Scott is a cry baby when he barely ever complains about the game, and if you would have ever watched any of his videos or streams you would actually see that. Now imagine thinking the few times he does complain he just does a tantrum instead of actually explaining why he's complaining and demonstrating valid points. Imagine.
---
I’ve never gotten more than 892, and that’s after turning on my macro WELL before the hook. Huh
---
That’s the next DLC: The THX logo.
---
Ghostface
---
A totem counter would be nice.
---
Doctor
---
I’m the same way honestly. If the other three are fucking around not doing much, or if they can tell someone’s being chased (like, idk, Obsession branches wiggling for instance) then if I go to struggle I wait for someone to *finally* come towards me and then I give up right before they get me. It’s a nice”fuck you” if they’ve been worthless :)
---
&gt;All the other killers have a massive learning curve that reflects their abilities
---
nope, they don't.
---
Let me guess. Paintbrush + chains
---
Let me guess, barbecue pop and ruin are 3 of your 4 perks.
---
I find once I see the killer for the first time, I know exactly which killer it is. Totally ruins the surprise.
---
Jesus, ik my Freddy build is torturous but I'm not that bad of a monster
---
I honesty was so hungry the other day. Like I hadn’t eaten all day and it was really messing up my playing. So I eventually just went right up to the killer hoping to die just so I could get food, but the guy took pity on me thinking I just gave up (which I sorta did but for the only reason of wanting food) and he just let me live and wouldn’t kill me. And I was just like why
---
Why can't freddy get his sunglasses I don't understand
---
It’s possible and it happens
---
I think one shot is what they use for a sound that doesn't loop.
---
This picture has audio in my head.
---
Dear devs, this the only bug that shouldn't be fixed
---
Thank you so much! I assumed they would be in ikebukuro too hehe.
---
When I read intense piano Giorno's theme popped in my head
---
Or, you know, you can do totems to prevent NOED at all. That's an option.
---
Thank you!
---
Well guess I'm just lucky then. Been playing for 2 years and aside from very laggy hosts, didn't got anything too crazy
---
Same. Most likely this guy was super laggy
---
Ok boomer
---
it’s a valuable lesson. in my experience, playing with friends can really blind you to what others playing with you are experiencing, whether they’re on your own team or not. either way, i doubt mr strimr holds anything against you

If you wiggle in my arms, you can wiggle on a hook. If it's a baby, I will give them the protip after the game.

Found the secret rank 21
---
The entity for a survivors birthday.
---
Crop your memes man
---
given the general feel of the community, im not sure if they are ok anywhere, but they are getting there
---
Don't forget Bloodwarden
---
This is a simple trap for the ones who are strong, just not strong enough
---
Loooove that jacket
---
Curious how the outfit looks as a whole in game tho!
---
Doom Slayer IS the killer.
---
If you can sneak a stalk before you're spotted, it can be an easy first down and save you time. They key is to make sure you don't finish the stalk til you are sure you're close enough to get the hit and avoid a chase or reveal.
---
Unpopular opinion: the higher you go you face more Nurses and Spirits. 
---
The more you face them, the more stealth perks and not chase perks are better
---
Good man
---
Someone forgot the time everyone used insta heal when they announced the nerf. It was a shit show, stopped to play killer entirely during that period, was insane
---
If you defend that **after** what happened and everybody has seen it's strength compared to killers instadown... I don't know what to tell you
---
Very true.
---
Ty!! &lt;3
---
Damn though, I wish I could draw like this! You’re so talented!! :D
---
Am I missing something?
---
Insta heal syringe was nerfed to hell.
---
Nah, more like *"That's it! I'm getting me Slowdown Legion!"*
---
I mean.. the official forum is shit. the mods just ban you, shadow ban or delete your posts for anything they don't like. Even if you follow the rules it doesn't matter
---
There are very bad apples there, just to have said "don't worry about them. Ignore these new players" to someone who was getting bullied from 3/4 guys in a thread I got banned with the message "I warned you" that sounded like a threat
---
Ofc people like peanuts won't do sht, contacted him thanks to other people I knew and he preferred shit posting instead of replying. He endorse it, so.. ignore the official forum. is garbage
---
What about Bill?
---
Maybe I'm playing spirit wrong, and maybe my experience isn't the same as yours, but for me running into a survivor is always an accident and half the time I do it I assume I got caught on some debris and just zoom away. I'm certainly not aiming to cheese survivors by bumping them, that doesn't even seem efficient
---
But more importantly/to the point, let's say they disable collision when spirit is phasing. What should happen when spirits phase ends and shes inside of a survivor? We all know how this games spaghetti code is, it would probably crash the game
---
Stay hydrated
---
I've only ever done that once. They were the most toxic bunch I've ever played. I disconnected because the 4 of then tbagged at once in the exit gate. That was enough lol
---
What’s wrong with the new instaheals? I think theyre fine.
---
Wiat.. whYt
---
Holding the game hostage???? Are you ok?
---
it should just not use up the medkit
---
On that day, otz learned a valuable lesson
---
Then keep making excuses for when you lose instead of actually trying to counterplay the killers perks.
---
F
---
Well I play with a PS4 controller so I have to contort my hand into this weird spider like shaped so I can hold R1 and hit L1 with the same hand
---
I honestly don’t care anymore, everything is tunneling, I just play the game.
---
As a killer you're not supposed to feel anything, especially if a survivor is telling you to. Half jokes aside, just don't be a dick. Play how you think is fair and play as survivor too so you can get a taste of your own medicine.
---
Not sure what the point of this post is if your not going to share the build, just comes off like your bragging about how great you are.
---
You’re right. I should of acknowledged him instead of getting caught up in this nonsense.
---
Doesn't heal a full health state instantly, so it's not an insta heal
---
I did answer with my respond. Sorry, not sure why you would want to have a streak when there is nothing gained from winning multiple games in a row.
---
Oh. I thought it was "(the) fuck u doin?"
---
She went down so fast her teammates probably thought she went AFK. What a bumbling fucking potato
---
I usually respond with boohoo
---
They are totally fine. I use them to heal while doing gens
---
I didn't used it before because was way too cheap. I guess you forgot the shit show when they announced the nerfs
---
I had a full red rank swf get matched up against a rank 15 billy. Luckily we started farming and I gave him a kill anyways so the match wasn't too bad for him. It'd suck if we did go full try hard sweat against him.
---
Yeah.  Why?
---
He definitely does not do anything at 200% speed.
---
The HUD isn’t showing a downed person, I guess? 🤷‍♀️
---
I think i watch like a 15 minute match of his and about 99% of his predictions were wrong. "They'll go left" Nope didn't. "They will be around here" nope not there. I mean i get it your a fan. Im just not.
---
i have cystic fibrosis and i’m unsure if i should laugh or not because i hate the movie’s existence to its core lmfao
---
Pop. Thrilling tremors, make your choice, devour hope. Thats my got tier freddy build. Hookem and see where they are with thrilling tremors. Pop the gen. they save and i get a stack of devour and insta down the person who saves. Rinse and repeat
---
His sprint....
---
FOR REALLLL 🤣🤣
---
You can power thru it but if he has jump rope or swing chains, it becomes more of a problem.
---
Trapper is already boring enough to face, im not waiting an extra minute after waiting 10+ to get into a single lobby.
---
He released two new videos earlier today, just go watch them is all I can say.
---
HybridPanda all the way. He’s the kind of streamer that 1) knows the game in and out 2) is pretty skilled but not overly sweaty and plays for fun 3) seems down to earth and like a guy I’d hang with.
---
I get you, and tbh I’m probably just bitching to hear myself bitch. I feel like something could be done, but you’re right it would probably just glitch things further. I’m not all that great and don’t play at red ranks so it’s not as big a deal, but I’ve definitely had Spirits phase, I’d stop running and would be running Iron Will, and still have them somehow down my throat.
---
Dont use addons except for plaid flannel which is now a brown addon. It lets you see where you will blink to. Besides that just muscle memory and knowledge of survivor movement. 100s of hours of practice
---
That's not stopped people before
---
At least if a survivor loses and says “gg get good” after being destroyed it’s most likely a joke, but I don’t see how calling someone a piece of shit would be
---
The Leather billy face, thrower of hatchets, shredder, trap setter, blinking, cloaking, phaser, stealth killer with multiple tiers, and harbinger of salt
---
Ok yoshikage kira. Thank you for your advice. Please tell me. How old are you and where do you live?
---
who thought this was good enough to watermark
---
Yeah most of them have those god loops, but I am talking of a real infinite, cause all those maps have either entity block or bloodlast, you can’t use any of that on Haddonfield.
---
I literally had a seizure reading that sentence
---
Not helpless. Any good player can win with any killer, fungoose 4ks 39/40 games, it's about your rotations and pressure, but it is super difficult.
---
I am in this picture and I don't like it
---
WHY DO PEOPLE RUN AWAY TO THE FARTHEST PLACE AFTER BEING UNHOOKED WHEN SOMEONE ELSE IS CLEARLY BEING CHASED. WHY ARE WE WASTING VALUABLE TIME RUNNING AND HAVING ME CHASE YOU WHEN I COULDVE HEALED YOU STRAIGHT AWAY FROM THE HOOK.
---
Dwight struggling on that trap is pure bullshit. If it was me playing Trapper he would've escape that shit in no time
---
Is the jump on the stairs it always drop to the barrels.
---
Quick and quiet if your making a stealth build along with urban evasion
---
Yo just wondering if I can get a link to those custom perks/items
---
thanks
---
Yo I was gonna say this is a deepcut
---
Is not an infinite I know you are talking about the drop to the barrels, but you can cut it off or block with the entity, Haddonfield has a real infinite.
---
Iron will and quick and quiet so if you get injured they won't hear you noping the fuck out.
---
Urban and Q&amp;Q
---
Killers hated syringe, but it takes balls (or a slugging douche) to use it.
---
I mean huntress sounds like a killer that'll give you a challenge but will be a pretty strong killer once you get better with her, but I'm guessing you didn't try her for a reason.
---
They killed me Mal....
---
Depressing. But yeah, SWFs are matched to the highest rank, so red ranks get faster lobbies.
---
Ricochet Hatches sound good tho lol should replace iridescent head
---
Ruin, surveillance, pop, and bbq with fake pallets is my build
---
Motion blur along with shakey camera since I was focusing on taking a picture and not expecting to be unhooked lmao
---
Yea dude he needs his crutch to make it out of green ranks its too hard for him
---
It absolutely is. Enjoy your downvotes.
---
Embrace it.  
---
Start seeing rank as what it is. A measurement system that vaguely tells you if you do the \*requirements\* to rank up \*somewhat\* consistently or not.
---
You will stop caring OR rank up in no time.   
---
This is what happens when you don't have a casual gamemode.
---
That's actually the exact reason why.
---
Iron Will and Q&amp;Q for the ultimate “Where the *FUCK* did that survivor go” experience.
---
Disclaimer: I’m all ears directly counters this whole build
---
Dedicated servers are trash. Worse than before
---
Deep fried hard.
---
Yeah. Wasting 30s-1m chase just by pressing one button, which is kinda messed up when gens can go so freaking fast and time is the most limited resource a killer have
---
Without even counting the syringe, when a downed survivor just went full health while you had melee CD.. if that sht is fine, idk what to tell you
---
As survivor I still have those dumb god loops, but I barely see anyone talk about them. The few I see, get downvoted to hell or harassed enough to make the post get deleted. Well.. the insta heal had to go, the shit show followed by the announcement should've been enough. I guess it isn't for who like to play easy mode all the time
---
Ight heres my point get good and take off the crutch whats the matter too hard in green ranks lul xD lulxD
---
It's more then that, insta heals were one of the few ways the survivors were able to mind game in chases and could prolong them so that their teammates could do saves gens or bones, the new heal is just a med-kit addons, and dont deserve the "ultra rare" status they have.
---
Yeah. What do you mean with that?
---
If it ain't broke, don't fix it, I say. There was a time when I felt Trapper should put nails in windows (back when infinites were a thing), but now I think he just needs to not be addled by his mechanics. The buff above, a wider trap pickup range so you don't have to tiptoe over to them, and trap reset without replacing would probably make him perfect.
---
Now for that secondary trap idea, consider if Clown could set his bottles on windows and gens...
---
How could someone use NOED on a killer who can LITERALLY INSTA DOWN PEOPLE EVERY FEW SECONDS? Man that makes me kinda sad
---
Hypothetically, if the gates don't open, then the game can be held hostage if more than one survivor is in the trial.
---
That sounds a lot like Pig needs a buff.
---
wazzzupppp!!!!!
---
Wow, are you capable of making a valid argument,  or even a valid sentence, or are you just toxic all the time?
---
We literally see the other guy but ok
---
On what rank tho?
---
Beads is the thing I'm suggested be nerfed. It's just that beads is one of the only things that needs to be nerfed about Spirit.
---
Why do they have to be insta? Insta med is a name that the community came up with, if you care so much about them then you probably shouldn't be using them in the first place.
---
They where OP and unhealthy for the game, so they got changed to a way more counterable and still great add-on. Simple as that
---
there isn’t another guy its glitched the guy was healing me and got smacked and i got stuck that way and couldn’t move lol take a joke
---
no, for some reason they are very quiet about stats and exact numbers
---
I don't know Sneak-Man. Is he related to Sneak King?
---
If I had to guess it's probably the
---
&gt;because I have to actually think and pay attention about what I’m doing
---
which can imply that survivors don't need to pay attention to what they're doing if it's anyone but spirit
---
Dont know what was invalid about that sentence but they probably haven’t taught you diagramming a sentence in your special school
---
I’ve got 27 P3s on PS4, I would’ve bought PC DbD by now if I didn’t have to grind all that out again. F
---
I know right...
---
Good thing I don't see many killers using that perk.
---
You... Can just play like 2-3 games instead.
---
I would like it if her animation doesnt spasm like that one moment is so crucial in a small loop.And when she climbs out of the windows theres no animation which is bullshit like how im supposed to know if shes climbing or not.Id have to make a guess on whether shes mindgaming or not and id prefer skill factor than luck in this game.The rest is fine
---
You're saying exactly what I'm thinking on both counts here.
---
I’m surprised pig is #1, I feel like I don’t run into a lot
---
and if you look at the bottom all survivors are dead
---
Not when the shrine uses the same currency you need to unlock Killers at a grindy 2k a perk.
---
You know, the Killers that aren't raw paywalled.
---
What is it with killers and resulting to making jokes about someone's skill in an argument, time is important for survivors as well, you would know that if you played both sides, and yes there are infinite loops that should be addressed but like I said in other comments, mind games and prolonged chases are how survivors buy themselves time to work. Maybe get some multi sided perspective before commenting on other people's skill level.
---
yo, is Decisive Light a thing or just edited? Because goddamn, guys
---
Could be they're running stridor, I recently learned that stridor and iron will seem to cancel each other out now. Which...I'm not sure how I feel about that, as bigmad as i was back when IW hard countered stridor, now it seems like survivors could really use that that counter. But now I'm rambling.
---
There were zero 'mind games' about the old insta-heals. You popped them and undid a chase. That's it.
---
Hell, the Purple one is still really freakin' strong. Being able to give yourself an on-demand Endurance allows you to do some pretty nutty solo saves if you're running Borrowed Time that previously weren't really possible. 
---
The red one still functions fine for what it does. You can pop it mid-chase, keep looping and get the health state back. Not as nuts as it used to be but damn I think it deserves more credit than you give it.
---
I agree with others, they shouldn't consume the med-kit on use. But it stands right now, the fact that they both do does allow for some interesting mind games that you don't seem to mention. 
---
Mid-chase, killer sees a survivor quickly self-heal and the med-kit is gone. Now they have to gamble, do they think it was purple or pink? Do they try to wait out the potential Endurance hit or do they quickly try to down the person before the free heal activates?
---
Ghost Face the other Wes craven creation
---
Personally like Tru3talent he plays both survivor and killer and switches it up here and there lots good advice
---
Hes compensating
---
Thanks,just did it now,didnt knew it lol
---
He might just poke your eye out through a window I don't know
---
This deserves way more points than it has right now. Blessed OC, cursed image
---
* Screenshots highlighting popular and/or meme-ish number combinations, e.g. 420, 69, 666, ... (use our weekly smile sunday threads).
---
Y'all Wildin.... It's funny that this is the stuff people complain about and not the fact that the dedicated servers that are severely flawed. 
---
The new "insta heal" is fine. Start complaining about shit that's actually important.
---
ngl after 2 weeks straight of posting the same topic with different bodys to see if BHVR replies I ran out of ways to say the same idea.  
---
also btw, I'm glued to my switch pressing "update via online" every 2 minutes, so at least I want my hopes to die already.
---
Well, that's some frail ego, but to be fair, you kind of don't need to think about what you're doing against most Killers. You loop. Some of them can interfere with that, but looping is still the go-to strategy. Spirit doesn't hand that over so easily.
---
Can she be pallet stunned while phasing, anyway?
---
No need to be hostile? You’re probably the same type of survivor that tbags at the exit or hides in the bamboo and think you’re good you relied on insta heal to get to probably mid green(if im not presuming too much about your actual skill) and now that it gone you just get killed every game and are bent outta shape saying how killer is op and we need more survivor buffs but no you’re right no need to be hostile its only game why we have to be mad, especially about a mechanic thats no longer a thing for shit players like you to rely on.
---
My only issue with them is theres no real feedback its happening. Theres a little icon but I've had a few people use it on me where I dont even realize it happened. Maybe a golden glow around the border during the effect or a red glow with medical pluses
---
I would use Shadowborn as a Wildcard since OP is new.
---
Plague has two excellent perks
---
Clown has one excellent perk
---
Freddy is an overall high tier killer
---
GF IMO is one of the most fun to play killers
---
Huntress should be a free download (I think)
---
Okay so, the point of killer is it is a 1v4, it is supposed to be a race against time, as a killer you take on that responsibility, as a survivor you take on the responsibility to act as quickly as possible to maintain pressure, or distract as long as possible to do the same, the problem is killer mains always want a 4k and that is supposed to be hard, one person defeating four people is often hard.
---
I've actually said passive phasing should be manually activated. While I like the idea, I don't think it should be a freebie players get without even knowing.
---
I wouldn't even mind if they took it away from Spirit and put it on an OC Killer using Old Freddy's base kit, to flesh him out a bit more.
---
I'll also agree that she needs a vaulting animation. It's like a bug that she doesn't; she shows one when playing as her.
---
That's that hitbox in action.
---
I said she is unfun to play against. There is no true counter-play to spirit.You either die or get lucky enough to survive until she gets her power back. Legion is an example of why a killer needed to get nerfed. He wasn’t op but once he was chasing you then you were dead. Even though this would require a long process, people didn’t like him because he didn’t have true counter-play. Using perks to “counter-play” is a shitty band-aid that plagues this game like using ruin to slow down gens that get done fast. https://youtu.be/sZyG29POXJw this video can pretty much suma up why spirit needs to be changes .
---
yes she can be stunned while phasing
---
Wait a moment
---
Agreed, that ass is PHAT
---
"Aatrox Pleased, Anyway"
---
That's on Valve's end and he's not even in the console versions IIRC.  Also Bill doesn't even have any other outfits in Left 4 Dead, last I checked.
---
Another problem is the balancing isn’t as ez as “just double everything” 
---
2v8 won’t work because that means stuff like:
---
2 killers on one survivor = built in insta down
---
What happens when there are two of the same hexes?
---
Making maps double the size would cripple killers with rough early game, ESPECIALLY TRAPPER.
---
Traps, Phantasms, Fake pallets and Snares would all need more per base kit
---
Etc etc etc
---
Well, there's something. That'd be lost if she didn't have phase collision. And also probably bug out and trap her in pallets all game.

I usually teabag on the hatch to signify that
---
Oof I feel like your not really getting this whole dont be hostile thing, because your really hostile. And not that either of us could prove this but I usually just say gg at the end of every game, if a killer was good and not toxic, it's a genuine gg if they were toxic af, they want a response and I dont give it to them, Kinda like this conversation.
---
Could also be used for "don't trigger EGC if the killer is face camping with NoEd" Find the totem
---
Probably because Valve never made anything else for him in the Left 4 Dead games.
---
Just type u/ then the person's name
---
**WHOLESOME BOOP**
---
Feel like I need to know what an edible is, to get the joke.
---
I think you have a problem then.
---
Well a lot of people dont use them often anyway because they are "ultra rare"
---
I don't even know why she has a husk tbh.
---
Well yes but like i mean like a real minigamr
---
Except you’re responding to my toxicity so who really mind gamed who here. Lul xD lul xD
---
Also the fact that she is so easy to play and has an easy time getting downs on good survivors sounds pretty bad game design. At least huntress and nurse has mechanical skill .
---
Perks or it didnt happen
---
Bubba, oooo
---
Use them before they get nerfed. They are an easy button for huntress to be honest. I don't use them.
---
In the title...
---
&gt;That'd be lost if she didn't have phase collision.
---
I don't think so, you were able to pallet stun OG freddy while awake
---
Yeah it was far too easy to prolong a chase using it, that’s why they were changed, not sure how you would mind game using them
---
you big guy, you are. gg ;)
---
He was put on to console a while back, but I really doubt he'd be getting anything anyway. It was a big enough surprise that other survivors would of gotten the L4D cosmetics
---
KYF lobbies only
---
It's not a difficult concept either. Open the gate almost the whole way and leave it until they're safe.
---
Didn’t mean to make you cry
---
Nah. Hilbilly doesnt strike me that way. Maybe Herman.
---
This is how I play with every character lol
---
I dont get what you mean by that but okay.
---
This is actually very frightening and I'm very excited.
---
“That reflects their abilities”
---
I’m not saying that learning wraith is extremely difficult, just that a killers strength is offset by how difficult they are to learn. The harder a killer is to use, the better the killer is. Except spirit. And if you’re just gonna continue to intentionally misunderstand me then I think we can all see that spirit is defended by children
---
Lol, Stop replying. Didn’t realize you were the comment police boioioio
---
they might nerf spirits rosary beads. or at least make it a pink offering instead of purple. ure right nurse has always blown on console. i didnt realize i should check out her addons. what u said about one turning her into a 'chase killer' sounds interesting. like an addon that makes her power unusable but gives her normal run speed? i doubt thats what u mean but that would totally fix her, since her horrible slowness is her problem. that and how hard it would be to get devious points as her.
---
Y the FUCK are u in light mode
---
Dude say what you want. That doc cosmetic is the scariest thing in this game
---
In the show much pretty much the entire right side of his hair is pure white and overall the hair is styled completely different (but that’s not as important). If I knew how I’d link a picture of the two side by side.
---
Pig = Upvote
---
What percentage of the player base is rank 10-20? I feel like swf happens more often at red ranks
---
Bullshit you weren’t toxic.
---
wtf, is my game redownloading itself with this hotfix?
---
Or do...
---
*soft oinks*

---
What, you don't find le dinner cate funny every day?
---
I play on console, I’ve learned to do skillchecks with one hand so I can eat.
---
There’s a reason she’s the hardest killer and no one else even comes close. Honestly just play her a lot and don’t get discouraged is all you can really do because it’s just about putting the time in. Also, probably don’t run any add-ons on her that change her blink values because a HUGE part of nurse is simple muscle memory and add-ons can mess with that.
---
I’ve seen the whole show, I guess I just forgot because to be fair, that outfit is literally from the last 5 minutes of the entire show lol
---
I remember this sound bug used to happen when someone was looking at ghostface and suddenly escaped through the exit gate, ghostface would hear the audio over and over again just like in the video

Formation plus object of obsession plus detectives hunch equals no killer wins ever.
---
And thank you!
---
You also dont pip as killer using ebony

for some reason they seem to be super easy to get.

i wouldn’t recommend using them unless you can clearly tell you’re up against a toxic swf. that’s the best time to equip them!

Shows how insecure you are needing to have the last comment in this chain you clearly have no reason to continue.
---
I never knew I needed this until now...
---
 She runs object of obsession and couldn’t take the fact that the killer goes after her? Does she not realise what the fuck she’s doing? What is she expecting? That the killer sees her aura and leave her be? Dumb survivor can’t even run the right loop.
---
OK so I'm confused is the honor system that you're not supposed to cleanse ever or...?
---
until the rift closes which says somewhere up top. it should still be around 60 days i think? i didnt check in a while
---
the entirety of the rift. So basically end of december
---
Sounds like you played against Ninja
---
I used her for a week or so. Did ok. That frame rate though. Headache city for me. 360ing survivors with auto aim is also a nightmare. I never understood why people on PC would not just have a controller on stand by when facing a Nurse. Plug that shit in and 360 her to death. Yes I play on PC too. Hundreds of hours on PC version.  I will admit I  prefer PS4 version so I can play on my TV. That and I might be mental.
---
They simply have to make assets work with the hitboxes mate, so when they made it a screwdriver they had the parameters of the weapon at X: ~ Y: ~ Z: ~
---
Badically, it had to be that long.
---
its addictive because its multiplayer and because in every match the killer can feel like the star
---
&gt;Sadam
---
Who?
---
Modern warfare crossplay is great. Its input based so if you play on console with keyboard and mouse you get matched with keyboard players and vice versa. I really hope they add that system.
---
Actually, if survivors can build a prop in the map without it being abused into an infinite would be cool!
---
The Doom Slayer has so much rage in him, that he becomes both!

You have to be in a customer match and then you hover over it with the cursor, hit x and turn
---
WDYM it's just the killer stalking her prey.
---
lightweight is a good one. paired with dance with me, your scratch marks will basically be non existent and give you enough time to stealth away!
---
if you plan on being injured while vaulting, i’d say use iron will as well &amp; then crouch somewhere. otherwise, go with urban evasion. (i’m not sure if iron will is useful if you’ve already lithe-d yourself out of the killer’s hearing distance lol).
---
i wouldn’t recommend quick and quiet since most of the time the killer could see you vault the window.
---
it seems like a waste to activate lithe + quick and quiet when the killer has already lost you.
---
Me neither tbh, im more of having fun, I was once using Freddy and immediately when the game started two people dcd and i deflated instantly (wanted to farm bp) 
---
I honestly feel really bad going really hard agaisnt 3 people. It's basically an insta loss for survivors. So i farm and mess around. Makes me feel a little better when people do dc
---
It's coming out on the 13th I believe
---
I would suggest Freddy or ghost face if you're in the higher ranks. Ghost face can be very strong and with Freddy, survivors are going to take all the pallets they can and dream snares can help as well. Ghost face with no terror radius or red stain when in stealth mode and a built in one shot down makes him great if you can catch survivors by surprise.
---
I actually don't find it addictive at all, It's just a different kind of game than what i'm used to, Such as the first BR I played, It's new and fun. Some people find it more fun than others but I certainly wouldn't throw the term addictive around so casually, It's pretty inaccurate
---
Holy shit. This is really good. I'm looking for someone to draw a legion for my profile picture and I think you could do really good. You don't need to, but I really like your art style. If you do do it, could you make it in color please? Thank you. It's u/shadow8wither
---
Damn, I got out gamered
---
Forreal huh, mains have wild hatred
---
Load into 4 no mither survivors. 
---
Freddy: stonks
---
The high of outplaying others.  With crushing rock bottom lows of being out played. Mix in some luck. Anticipating the next chapter every 3 months. Watching BHVR fumble something so you take off and play civilization then come back and it feels freash.  Some good memes on Reddit. My fav. People still arguing about NOED. Love how boneheaded and naive threads about it  are. Still refusing to no do totems and bitching on Reddit. Lol.
---
I just had a game like that. Except the killer ended up using mori on me. They said they didn't want to waste it. I did thank them for letting me farm a bit.
---
We should get the option to rate the people we play with and see what those ratings are. Similar to uber
---
As a filthy Legion main I usually use Thana and Dying light as my slowdown perks.
---
Legion
---
So its supposed to be lame, annoying, and boring?
---
I get what you're saying but it should really be "hold space to struggle"
---
99% that bitch and open it when you are leaving
---
Lies. if i get the use the anti tunneling perk i got tunneled even if the killer hooked everyone else within the time span
---
This is how I feel honestly. Granted I have played against some pretty damn accurate plagues but I have also played against some potatoes. It all depends on perks and add ons. Her damn add on that let's her see survivors while they puke sucks
---
Licensed Survivor conundrum. I'd honestly pay $5 for sunglasses on Freddy and $10 for a sweater that doesn't look like complete ass but they'd have to get the rights to do so from the NoES license holders.
---
Happy Cake Day btw.
---
K
---
Lol okay, have fun being toxic buddy.
---
You are correct, it isn't against the rules. However, if you were a survivor and just played a 10-15 minute match against a killer, would you really want to wait another 5-7 minutes just doing nothing because all 4 survivors are downed?
---
It's even funnier when it's someone with a trap on their head that starts the egc
---
Are u saying that when she like spases out it should be manually activated?Sounds a bit unecessary but it could work.And that bead needs something like in exchange for no sound theres like a visual fog to indicate where she is
---
I’d really just prefer a “press space to die”

---
its so ridiculous, clever killers find a way to mindgame cocky players abusing an infinite, then the salty losers cry to BHVR &amp; like always get it removed
---
i feel like you wont be able to purchase them with shards they look.....too awesome.....
---
in a single trial.......theres only 4 survivors in a match numbnuts
---
If a killer did that to me I must have did something to deserve it. Or if he is a new player like you said he didn’t want to risk anyone getting back up but still wanted the 4k there are more reasons than just leaving survivors on the ground than your saying.
---
Wraith has to ring his bell to attack you and his footsteps are basically mini tactical nukes.
---
I equip slippery meat at rank reset and step in a bunch of traps for the fun of it

thats awesome, but you wont be able to purchase it with shards i think. heard that no cosmetics for featured characters are buyable with them.
---
i would never cheat on shirtless myers
---
already got her a new skin about a week ago and the other skin i wanted wasnt ou for shards
---
Android too. Just not on the play store
---
This is why devs need to stop listening to players.
---
They just need to make spirit not see blood or scratch marks or hear players or environment. Otherwise it’s gonna stay like a sprint burst for killer
---
You didn’t even boop the snoot smh
---
I was just going to say, give us a “hold”, please!
---
Oh damn FFF
---
Her killer counterpart should be a white cheerleader who steals all her moves and earns BP from it.
---
Dying on the first hook at late game should reward some bonus points.
---
I'm sick of seeing this BS of "it would ruin the game for console players." Every cross play game that I know of has the option to turn it on or off. Behavior has done that with the new system this meme is referencing. Get the heads out of the sand people. Sorry to be so agro, but I just love this game and want to play it from my xbox with my best friend on pc. If enough people keep saying cross play is a bad idea then behavior might just very well scrap the idea all together.
---
Yes. So combining both Shadowborn and Monitor and Abuse gives you 25 more meters of FoV
---
My bb girl pig looks adorable. Good job!!
---
Actually, FOV increases don't stack.
---
Also there are so many cool ways you can use the new insta meds, if you are smart they can work better then the ones before
---
Im more concerned for killers like piggy and ghosty coz they be crotch walking and the back pain might kill em lol. Also urban evasion users.
---
nice abs, bro!
---
I got Indiana Jones dave
---
Its bubba right? I know that mating sound from anywhere.
---
You are clearly a very low rank survivor only player if you actually believe this. There is literally 0 mind games to insta heals like you claim. 
---
Jesus I'm starting to really question why I joined this sub. Literary every hour theres some nonsense like this posted or someone asking the same question for the thousandth time.
---
You are really unpleasant, you know that?

I'd use this as a perk
---
yeah i think im gonna get it after this round!!!
---
I use it on all my builds
---
From the sounds of things, he was probably just a baby Trapper who didn't even know to hook people. I'm not sure if he was trying go be toxic or  not, but seems like he just had no idea what to do lmao.
---
If you could see survivors the moment you start unphasing, it would alleviate some awkwardness. 
---
Also, the length of the delay would be based on how long you were phasing. So mindgames at pallets would take less than half a second, but chasing a survivor down between jungle gyms would give the survivors a 2-3 second window for counterplay.
---
Survivors are also shiny and highlighted when you can see any part of their body
---
As if farming really matters...
---
I think someone was trying to do this for me (I think a Michael Myers?) and my rank 19 ass just kept wiggling out.

But the wraith DOES have an audible map wide cue when uncloaking D: and Myers is detectable with spine chill as of last patch

Pain Reliever did it in his [Plague Video](https://youtu.be/a6OrhEw3OFE?t=2m30s) said it was lag and server related

 As a Pig main if anyone ever boops the snoot I always let them live. It’s those things that keep me going.

I'm toxic because I disagree with your clearly terrible/wrong opinion? Cool. Good to know

I never wanted cross play so this will be off for me for sure.
---
No cause you wrongfully assumed my skill level, get it right toxic boi.
---
it should pop up sooner or later. have fun its great against stealth killers (or spirit) :)
---
A lot of players who aren't new run everywhere, doesn't matter much if you wanna get chased.
---
Ptb challenges he took screenshots
---
hey guys, this is otz intensifies
---
This art is fantastic!! I love your style
---
Oh no
---
He's a very good player, is usually extremely fair, and he's funny and entertaining. I'm sure his adorable Spanish accent plays it's part too. I think he got popular doing Speed and No hit runs in the Dark Souls games.
---
That is interesting. My point, though, was that the mask and the costume (even though the costume on film and the Fun World costume aren’t exactly the same) were 100% made famous by the movie.
---
I dont believe you pkay killer at all and you cant be good at survivor if you need insta heals. So nice one
---
Oversaturated content...

love it! good job :)
---
Hex: No One Escapes: there are no doors and no hatch gg ez.

I legitimately hope they add it to regular lobbies. It's just fun and lets you get a real close look at your own killer's face, which you pretty much never get to do.
---
you know why ;)
---
noob
---
I would argue that dbd is one of the few games that controllers have an advantage over (at least on the survivor side)
---
Ah, okay then, didn't know. Seems like people didn't understand what I actually intended to say, damn butthurt snowflakes are everywhere. Grow up, everyone!
---
Please I have this as my background to my phone. I love it so much.Please post the new one on this subreddit if you do one
---
WOOSH
---
I honestly hate that change, because for survivors all you have to do is escape, regardless if you contributed anything to the match.  But as killer you have to do real good with sometimes questionable perks.
---
I'd go Lithe, Dance With Me, Quick and Quiet and Vigil. Or maybe Adrenaline instead of DWM. Vigil to get your exhaustion down fast. Lithe pairs well with Q&amp;Q and DWM and makes sense from an Athletics POV - hurdles.
---
Yeah I got your point, not sure why it necessitated such a harsh reaction but that's just reddit for you.
---
Goodbye everybody im at the gates
---
Because its pretty hilarious coming from Americans picking at someone who is learning and or knows english to an extent when only a fourth of them know a second language, most not going any further than learning some spanish in school. Also it seems a little weird to ask someone if its their second language and then provide no example as to why they asked in the first place. I see grown adults that dont know the difference between their they're and there but for some reason poking at someone trying to learn english seems to be the more important one here.
---
Oh, awesome.
---
Sprint burst, Vigil, Poised/lightweight, fixated/adren
---
Lol so toxic! You probably a spirit main.
---
I would use adrenaline, lithe/sprint burst, light weight, and quick and quiet or anything you think would fit
---
Oh for sure. But the costume in scream is actually pretty nice/ergonomic feeling having sewn on gloves. The gloves also bring the tassels all the way up to your wrist when you raised your hand like you’re gonna stab. Also there’s no middle tie in scream. If you can’t tell I like the scream robe.
---
I can't speak for everyone obviously, but it seems that survivors with OoO get REALLY salty REALLY quick specially when you down them as fast as you did.
---
I got 2 different matches yesterday where 2 different OoO survivors (a Claud and a Laurie) DCd after being downed for their 2nd and 1st time respectively.
---
Lol, *continues to put on clown makeup*
---
Good because it doesn't work. You just got unlucky.
---
60% of the time it works all the time
---
Not really. I literally tagged this post with *Looking For Advice* so I wouldn’t have to deal with all these troll/spam posts.

---
Yeah, lol, I *can* tell. I like it too though, I did the costume one year a while ago. I didn’t realize with your first comment that you probably meant that they’re literally using the actual Fun World costume with the jagged arm tassels and all that, I don’t know if it’ll look better that way in game or not. Either way, I’m excited to see it.
---
 Multiple People I have played hundreds of hours with I met as survivors in my killer lobbies. Guess those hours all don't ever get to happen and I'm stuck with the one irl friend that likes the game and plays an hour every 2 weeks.
---
Wah! Wah!! Wahhhh!!! You get shitty teammates boo hoo oh well just play the game out. It sounds to me like you just can’t play well solo. Prolly need a SWF to have a chance at escaping. Sad😕
---
To be honest, I'd rather prefer not getting a match at all rather than playing against tryhard rank 1's, while I'm a rank 15-20 killer. The change was much needed, now people can actually play without losing brain cells and uninstalling in their first game.
---
Oh damn, I guess you’re right. I dunno, maybe I’ll buy auric cells after all. With that outfit and the new rift thing, there’s more of a reason to buy them.
---
Spine chill worthless now honestly lmao
---
* Tier lists of any kind. This includes meme tier lists and personal perk/killer rankings.
---
Your first statement is true or false, because half the playerbase quit at the end of may 2018 because of lack of updates.

Thanks! Currently working on one about Frank (Main Legion)
---
You’re all goo
---
Stridor counters iron will. So much for that plan, you just wasted a perk slot. I agree iron will is useful against all killers, but I'd rather use more altruistic perks than such a situational perk that is sometimes useful  against a killer you sometimes encounter.
---
Yes
---
I wanna send this post to anyone who says the only thing about prayer beads that needs to be changed is the rarity.
---
It looks alright in game, definitely the most stealthy outfit he’s got.
---
yeah I often buy skins I really like with cells, it's a way to keep supporting and in the end you'll be looking good af too
---
the dream  &lt;3
---
 But if you don't cleanse aren't you basically going up against an infinite tier 3 Myers?
---
As Killer? You're way faster. Survivor queues are very short that I've seen, though.
---
This would be useless since people get salty at each other for so many reasons that everybody's (especially killers', as they are alone) rating would be negative
---
No way??????
---
Modern Warfare uses aim assist on consoles to help bridge the gap between controller and M&amp;K. So unless they gave console killers aim assist, I don't think it's a great comparison.
---
Head by gaydwight ftw
---
Okay, so Spirit could lose collision, since they've presumably coded something other than the game breaking when someone falls asleep with Freddy inside them.
---
Now the question is if that's REALLY the best nerf for her. Because I'm looking at beads, vault anim, and maybe her passive phase first.
---
YOUR GOD HAS NO POWER HERE!!
---
*spams basement with 7 hatches during save*
---
Because reasons :)
---
I remember hearing people complain about her a year ago. Those people still have the same complaints, so it definitely isn’t the fault of 1 crybaby steamer or good players.
---
All he had to do was to close the hatch (spam spacebar) and then hit Laurie.
---
blease.......................... im starving
---
Just starting to get this too
---
I remember I was on the city bus studying my bio 1010 textbook, when I noticed a little kid had a pen and paper out and was taking notes of the page I was on. No idea why, but it was kinda cute. His notes were shit tho
---
First off, I'm not being toxic. Just stating facts and making an assumption. 
---
Second, even if I was being toxic, i could care less. 
---
You're an absolute idiot and your opinion is not only wrong but its shit teir. That's toxic. If I'm being called it might as well be it.
---
No way. Does he also get at least 8 hours of sleep every night?
---
'Prevent survivors from completing any generators in a Trial adjacent to yours in addition to your own Trial.' 
---
-must complete in one trial.
---
Undetectable only blocks aura reading perks and items (Object of Obsession, Alert, Key w/ Tracking add on etc). Spine Chill and Premonition arent aura reading, they just give you a HUD indicator that theyre looking at you/youre looking at them, so they still work regardless
---
I mostly play killer but I run Spine Chill on my main survivor build,  I havent seen a Michael in the last couple dozen matches so I cant confirm myself but others have said he's detectable now through it.
---
As survivor in red ranks
---
Got 3 d/c's, then the last person found hatch instantly. Depip'd 1 point. Yeah, great system there.
---
Word its rough on some killers like vommy mommy. Just got a 12 hook and was still one shy of a merciless
---
Yeah I agree. The only way I can evade her consistently is with the whole dance with me, Lithe, quick and quiet combo. But that's 3 perks just incase it's this 1 killer
---
My personal rule: It is always Michael until proven otherwise.
---
*coxcombed clapper intensifies*
---
Fuck off
---
Partially BHVR's fault for giving her a bandage bikini tbh. You can't sexualize your own character and then think it's weird when fans run with it.
---
Now I feel less stupid knowing that others failed as well xD
---
Yea i see too many people that cant break their self preservation instinct. Like bro try to take agro im death hook and the dude ends uo sandbagging you cuz he’s so scared of getting hit. Like thanks bro, red rank btw.
---
Sounds like my opinion doesn't count because I haven't played enough games in the specific conditions you're looking for. Do I get to write off your opinion for an equally arbitrary reason of my choosing?
---
Doesnt really matter if hes chasing or not. Just if he isnt, you can expect him to come so be ready to loop.
---
Broke the poor man's heart
---
If you don't want a chance of bleeding out then don't get downed
---
You can actually get more range by flicking to the left and right quickly, it makes the stream travel further as well as covering a larger wide area.  
---
Great for getting survivors hit at 15ish meters.
---
Dang who t bagged you at the pallet.
---
That is a pretty good suggestion in my opinion. I like it.
---
uhh xbox gives u an option to stream your xbox to your pc (connect to microsoft from your pc and make sure both are on same network). so u can record the stream on your PC
---
nah
---
I don't know the full situation, so maybe he really didn't find you all after downing?  
---
But if it was on purpose, there is no reason gameplaywise, since "I was doing my objective." is definitely wrong here. Even tunneling or smth (while not a nice move) has a logic behind it. The killer needs to sacrifice the people, not bleed them out, and gets some Bloodpoints for this. So, this person's need to be a dick to others was greater than to do the objective and get more points (no fear of survivors getting up, getting out, even getting some more points themselves).  
---
After my first year in this game, I noticed that most players don't play for fun anymore and some even only play to make others feel bad. (I also met some really kind people. So I got this going for me. Which is nice.)
---
Eyyy! It's my man! Miguel Miéros!
---
Lol okay toxic friend, maybe one day you'll be able to have a real discussion. Till then gg :)
---
For me it's the grind, that's what kept me playing for over a 1000 hours. After I get every perk with the new DLC I barely play any matches, I find them pointless and boring.
---
Bond, ds, adrenaline, sprint burst.
---
It really is annoying once you have won a chase to have to go on another chase because someone used dead hard to get to the next pallet or used balanced landing on some random hill. I don't mind sprint burst so much because you can just choose to not commit to a chase with that person, but yeah they are not fun to go against especially when using weaker killers that need all the help they can get.
---
is it hentai?
---
Of course it's exactly double. 😌
---
May not relate to DBD, but I’m getting flashbacks of those kids with shitty earrape mics on a  Xbox 360 chat

I just realized that the "Must be done is a single trial" is the equivalent for the TF2's "No random crits"

Of course he does. How else would he see?

Ehh. No sense in debating a 12 year old. Just keep in mind you are not good if you need insta heals. They are perfectly fine with the new changes and if you disagree it's because you are dog shit or literally never played killer in your life. 
---
Later kiddo.
---
Her power is fair as it is, it's designed to be a 50/50, the issue is what happens when he is phasing.
---
The change they need to do is make the sounds of survivors heard from both sides of the headphones (I don't remember the name for this) during her power, also removing the fact she can bodyblock you while phasing you be a good quality of life change.
---
Later! :)
---
Appreciate it!
---
There's always some people crying about any killer that come out (look Freddy)
---
But only recently people made a fuss about it. I remember few months ago, spirit wasn't even mentioned as top 3 killers. She was mentioned as Huntress level, barely
---
So, yeah. I don't care about the crybabies, since most of the actual people who played the game constantly didn't think much about spirit. Only recently people started crying when they noticed her true potential
---
Way more times than any other game I play.
---
You shouldnt need a perk to counter a killer.
---
Infinite loading screen has stopped ever since I made my pc a juggernaut. Before my new pc, it happened occasionally. Like 7 times a week.
---
Spirit main.
---
you should be able to pip to atleast red ranks even with potato teammates..
---
I just thought it was pretty funny. I also wanted to see if this would get flagged for unrelated content.
---
More like \*grabs Harry Potter to keep reading while on the hook\*
---
Pop goes the weasel and BQQ are good. Nurses calling is always a plus. Slow down perks are shunned by survivors on nurse but if you don’t care like most people you’ll be good.
---
At first I thought they meant "Russians" and just abbreviated it strangely. xD
---
At some point, you’re going to learn the hard truth about your rank.
---
This game in a way has the same addictiveness as fortnite. Fortnite is absolute fucking garbage and I absolutely hate it, but when I get on with my friends and I just completely doink some 10 year olds I get a weird rush of satisfaction, which makes me like playing for around 30 seconds. I get that same vibe from here, no matter how many times I get face camped or tunneled, no matter how many times I get a crazy 4 man that just shits on my entire career, I keep coming back for the feeling of victory I get when things do go my way
---
No way. That was made by fans in an event for fans. I think there will be riot if they are not available via shards as those are the only free currency available for fans.
---
My games are good sometimes I fight red ranks(I’m purple) but otherwise pretty good. Sometimes I get tilted and have to take a break.
---
All my games are disconnecting two seconds after getting on the map
---
Because you can just close it now.
---
they just need a tell when shes using her power, then theres still some skill to it
---
What flare do you want me to use then
---
No, I can tell if we got dodged. What happens is all 4 of us are being put on different lobbies (4 different matches). And the error will get one of us into the lobby while the other 3 will be kicked out, thus leaving the lobby and inviting again. This never happened before for 2 years that I've been playing so I'm not aware that bugs can go this big
---
You can’t grab anymore anyways but in that scenario if you had closed the hatch you would’ve been golden.
---
No because STBFL deactivates once your obsession dies or if they leave as well. Unless you have a way to change Obsession.
---
M..mommy Myers?
---
I think ghostfaces adept is just glitched I got it for a ruthless but I’m on pc so I’m not sure.
---
I had this happen but when trying to heal a survivor...Nea, if you're reading this, I'm sorry
---
wait, really?
---
If you're purposefully staying at low ranks, you're the toxic one
---
Its way too funny. She feels so weak standing on that hook
---
*builds shirtless Myers*
---
Flexing cosmetics and useless charms that’s barely visible on survivors.
---
Yeah. So his perk kinda became useless, unless someone used DS on him.
---
ah yes lemme grab my phone as if i have important people to talk to. :(
---
its pips, your friends are strange and wrong.
---
I always called them pips, I thought that was the official name
---
Lol pips; I’m pretty sure the devs call them pips too
---
Maybe once a month or so?
---
good to know then! ty for clarifying.
---
I don’t get it either you’re not the only one.
---
Nea is the killer comment
---
Me being a huntress main myself (I know ironic for my name) this is completely normal I always seem to have 30 of each common and 70 iridescent heads but I need  more infantry belts.
---
As they say, if it's broke... don't fix it
---
It's wildly overrated.
---
Corrupt Purge is like if Myers got to throw his knife for a limited amount of time, but it became terrible if the survivors spread out, and you got to choose where he had to go and what he had to do to get it, and you could still hide and wait it out just like you would his regular EW3, and it slowed him to even try to use it.
---
And your only alternative is a complete inability to hide while having to repair generators against a full-speed Killer who will always hear and know exactly where you are and one-shot you away from pallets since you don't get the speed boost for being injured.
---
The closest to an honor system there is popping a generator and then cleansing, everything else is asking to die - Plague is gonna 4k unless you are so far above the average looper that you could play no mither 24/7 without caring no matter who the killer is, unless you cleanse.
---
That said I would like crossplay between Xbox and PS4 maybe Switch too
---
Then you need to expect this kind of stuff. Waste of a post.
---
Fine!

Ohh you did it!

*sad Elephant noises*
---
To be fair without frank's mix. ,pre-nerf legion was pretty mediocre in terms of efficiency, he could get a down with frenzy yeah, but it took way too much time 2 gens got done for 1 down and thats with thanata on after multiple stabs, so good legions ran frenzy cooldowns to stab get out of frenzy stab again and even then experienced survivors were good in avoiding it. Legion needed his addons reworked not his power gutted into oblivion.

Thanks so much! :))

I would say the nurse is the same way in terms of guessing, the survivor goes out of your vision and turns around to avoid your blink predictions or he keeps going to avoid you blinking right on top of him.

---
There are plague add-ons that stack that dont say they do
---
My favorite minigame is when survivors camp pallets and you slowly inch closer to see if they will drop it or not. It's so much fun, because either they drop it WAY to early, or they get hit and drop it a tad bit too late.
---
Very cute artsyle! 
---
Spine Chill does work with the stealthy killers now tho...
---
It isn't that the perk turns off. It locks progress once the obsession is gone. 0 stacks stays at 0, 8 at 8, and so on.
---
Normally you want to avoid the obsession because hitting them with M1 loses stacks and killing them after just losing stacks means they're gone for good. But if you play a Killer with a damaging M2, you can make bank as you dont lose stacks on damage from your power.
---
STBFL is a God tier perk on Demogorgon for that reason. Next to no negatives using it allowing you to steamroll through Survivors.

At least three, good survivors can Spine Chill roulette and hop on generators after you pass, any toolbox and hitting one or two greats and they'll be done before you finish patrolling around again on a small map and even without a toolbox on a larger map.
---
It's just one of the things about the game, four consecutive pops are really hard to prevent against dedicated survivors, I've had survivors immediately blow a gen and still pop it before I can reach it by teaming up on it before, finishing before I can cross the map despite Wraith's movement bonus for being cloaked.
---
At least we get points now when other survivors DC.

Fury Waist or what its called its the best body for Wraith by far and it can be bought with shards aswell

All killers can reach through windows a good ways.  They can also hit over some objects like waist high fences.

STBFL Legion tho is fun. While you still lose/gain stacks in Frenzy, you can hit same person twice and stack it easily. Even if you hit the obsession,  you can just restack on one person later.
---
And then go stabby stabby with that sexy normal m1.
---
It would still generate complaints and an uproar because people want to use the options available so adding an option where console players are massively disadvantaged would just cause drama with literally no gain.

I want to break the cycle and have a killer who controls their own power, not "will the survivors let you use your power."

This was apparently changed since he got granted Undetectable, I havent gotten the chance to confirm myself, but others have said he is now detectable by spine chill/premonition, which is ironic

Its an addon for a map

Oh alright my bad

You're embarrassing.

How do people still not know this is a map add on??

This is a key perk. You can put a beam on a totem to let other players know where it is or any item.

Until dedicated servers are shit and lag and kill you for no reason. Like the Idea is solid but its ass when I have to spam and I get punished for something out of my control.

Killer mains want to always have a CHANCE to get a 4k

winning, getting some flashlight saves, getting some 360s and looping a killer for far too long and getting away.

2 of these usually happen have fun guessing which ones LUL

This is why i play spirit. Not because shes ez wins but because i like to play her.
---
You arn't a true spirit main until you run Katana Tsuba and Wakisashi Saya. It is terrifyingly hilarious.

They always do, and sadly most of them aren't good enough to work around looping and insta heals, so they argue for survivor nerfs, and insult anyone who calls them out on being toxic.

How annoying she is? You want her to take you out for tea and discuss the weather or play an asymmetrical horror game? Legion had exploits so yea absolutely nerf the exploit. They did him dirty in the end. Spirit doesnt have an exploit though.

If you play legion everyone DC's for an easy 4k (real talk why does everyone hate going against legion? They're awful)
---
Thank you! :)

For context
---
I thought people meant "tally" like "talisman" or basially what the offerings are. I've always said "tally screen" to the screen before the game starts that shows all the offerings in the game.

Huh
---
No servers on console (well, X1 and PS4 - I think Switch has had servers since its launch) and queue times are awful on survivor.  Not too bad on killer.
---
I know PC people really dislike how the servers feel but right now my friends and I are lucky to get 1 game a night with green ping on console.  The rest are between 150-180ms.  We've started to refer to that as the standard DBD ping.  And then I think another thing PC people don't have to deal with as much is players playing on wifi connections.  I assume console gamers are much more likely to use the built-in wifi because it's convenient or easy whereas PC gamers actually care about consistent connection quality and latency so most are wired.
---
If we ever get to actually experience them on console maybe we'll change our minds but right now, with the way connections are on console, I'd at least like to try the servers.
---

12 times from SWF error load outs or host unreachable, or SWF getting into lobby and I error out or another SWF errors out.
---
Sometimes the tally read marks will go invisible and we will have to restart the app on ps4 so that’s another 5 minutes just dealing with the loading and slowness from getting back into a lobby and waiting for SWF to rejoin.
---
Happens daily
---
It depends. If you know that killer is on the other side of the map or she is chasing someone else you dont need to cleanse. It depends how much expierienced you are.
---
yeah now the cap is 120 if u change the framerate.
---
Tier 1 Myers as well, especially on Lery's
---
Only in custom games, you can rotate the killer as you normally can rotate your character even tho it shouldn't be possible in this position
---
Facts
---
I find it funny that they even listed it as a "known issue" in the patchnotes, even tho it's not the only know issue
---
it's like them saying "Look what happened by accident. We had some fun with it so here, have some as well!"
---
Sounds like you might have some connection issues on your end
---
Um, ok, so, I assumed you calling yourself new meant complete noob, so I maybe went overboard on the ins and outs of the exit gates; if you know a lot of it already, I'm sorry, please ignore it; if you don't... yay? Idk, it's late + I wanted to be helpful, which means word vomit.
---
The meme is referring to the Pig and her Reverse Bear Traps on survivors. After a gen finishes, any placed traps activate, and the survivior with a trap on then has a timer to get to a Jigsaw Box to try to remove it; if time runs out, they die. Each box, except for the last one remaining, gives you a 50/50 shot at removing the trap, with the last one being guaranteed removal. If the trap hasn't activated (so, placed after the last gen finishes, or if they're the last man standing and no gens got done between getting it and then), they can just leave through the gates or hatch. If the trap was placed before the last gen finishs and they haven't taken it off, if they run out, the trap activates and kills them.
---
If someone fully opens the gate and starts EGC, that means that those two survivors have TWO TIMERS, so they need to rush to different Jigsaw Boxes, hope that it'll come off without needing to run to every Box, find an open exit, and then get out w/o Pig finding either of them, which is Not Gonna Happen bc she'll be focusing on patrolling the Jigsaws just for this reason. If you 99% the gate, they don't need to rush so much to Boxes and can hide if Pig comes by, she won't be alerted to the door opening bc the buzzer has already gone off, and in the meantime, you can check to see if the other door has been 99ed in case a chased survivor runs to it. Then, when you're ready to open one, all you'll need to do is tap it.
---
Also, to be careful of Blood Warden, waiting to open the door until after the hook is general policy, as it prevents the perk from activating and blocking the exits off at the beginning of the collapse, which threatens everyone, not just the guy on the hook. Then, if NOED is in play and depending on how things work out, you either open the door leave, do bones, or just risk the unhook.
---
And, in regards to &lt;b&gt;trying to 99 it&lt;/b&gt;, stopping any time after the buzzer goes off generally works, but it makes it harder to leave if the killer rushes to the door (Nurse, Spirit, chainsawing Billy, EW3 Myers, or anyone with NOED) and you've still got a bit of a ways to go. If you open it all in one go or start before the buzzer, stopping &lt;b&gt;right at the third buzz&lt;/b&gt; is your indicator to actually 99 it, bc if you aim to let go after it ends, you've either opened it or are just shy of, which can be inconsistent. If you let the buzzer go off, leave, and return to it, since you don't have to worry about skill checks, you can either eyeball it and try to let go just before it pops, or stop at the point that most closely resembles the "get help" point of recover; then, you can tap it once or twice to push it a bit further so it'll tap open, or you can prepare for the second or two you'll still need.
---
Generally, you can stop just after the buzzer goes off if someone else is with you at the door and you either see them going for the unhook (or you gesture for them to go for it via pointing), bc your job will be to stay near the door and open it while they're on their way back or if you can see/hear killer coming your way. If you have a clear line of sight or something to hide behind, you can stay right at the switch; if you don't, then depending on the map, you may wanna move out a little bit until you can see a bit more and/or are hidden, and then you run back and open it A) after the unhook, B) you see them running to you, or C) if the killer's coming.
---
If you wanna go for the unhook yourself and there's no one else there or if the other door's been opened, open it. If you've got a safe shot to take a hit for a wounded survivor or to go for an unhook, go for it and rush back to the Gate. If there's more than 2 survivors left, you can try to attract the killer's attention somehow (either quick vault/enter lockers, or if he sees you, try to bait him w/o teabagging) and lure him into the Exit Gate so another teammate can go for the save, then run out when he gets close. If it is just you and another survivor, unless you're confident that the killer's far enough away from you both that you'll avoid him entirely, rescues are usually reserved for those w Borrowed Time (when NOED is not in play) and you plan it so you you're positioned behind the survivor and the killer will either whack during the animation or after, so any hits will activate Deep Wound on the other guy, and if it's safe for you to run behind them and take any hits.
---
If it's not safe to leave the gate (the killer is a known camper, they have NOED, the hook is too far from your door/right next to the other door and you don't know if it's been worked on at all, or if you generally &lt;i&gt;have no escape route&lt;/i&gt;), then just escape, bc that's one less kill for the killer. 
---
And... Yeah. Sorry again. Hope I helped.
---
I SET TRAP AND INSTANTLY STEP INTO IT AND GET STUNNED! ITS FUNNY FIRST FEW TIMES BUT GODDAMMIT MATTHEW!
---
Great way to hit that survivor that is opening a gate but is really far away
---
This is a new thing spread by salty players.
---
If you go back you’ll notice many people on reddit and elsewhere all saying Spirit is hard to use and asking for tips.
---
Also, if thats the case then why are low rank Spirits so bad? Even Trapper does better at low ranks.
---
There must be a learning curve there based on the evidence.
---
Nurse and Huntress are harder to use than Spirit. However Wraith? Trapper? Leatherface? Hillbilly? Myers? Freddy? Pig? Most killers in the game are simplistic. I’d love to know who you consider more difficult than Spirit.
---
Hillbilly is the one whose strength is disproportionate than his abilities. This is evidence by the fact that low rank Spirits are garbage but low rank Hillbillys tend to destroy every team they face. Just instadown one, sprint to the next, instadown, sprint to the next, instadown.
---
Of course I’m basing this on what I’ve witnessed time and time again over a thousand hours of playtime but what do I know.
---
No it's fine I would've thought the same thing.
---
To be honest i like play during the night or in the morning if it is not holidays, because at this time it is very rare to face toxic SWF, while when you play after work every game is SWF
---
I just posted about the same thing! I think it's got something to do with the crossplay update.
---
other games with matchmaking has taught me that this is the best way to improve and since then i never complained about being matched with players way above my rank. i saw it as a challenge to overcome. 
---
did i lose? yes. did i learn? absolutely.
---
even in dbd, unless they were outright trying to bully, i did my best and learned. 
---
so don't feel like shit, it happens but it's also a good opportunity to learn!
---
More like that’s it im playing insidioud bubba!

---
8magine if you used a search function.
---
Glad this post could get so much attention and be of help, this subreddit is better for just memes and shitposting!
---
What rank are you for survivor or killer. I’m not trying to discredit you because of your rank i just want more context.
---
Yeah but I am not good in chases and being down like in 4 second makes me feel like a point cow for other survivors and killer. I once managed to  get a 14 min chases on a rank 7 killer but yeah. I feel like I am placed to high
---
4 survivor and 7 killer
---
Or his footsteps, which means it's time to flee.
---
I'm in the middle ranks and considering how EVERYONE is crouching in the most random locations whenever I'm downed, it'd be better in low ranks
---
Not really, she was self caring while i got into struggle
---
Thats to much to ask because then BVHR loses their precious $$$$, they were able to clown switch users like my coworker who tells me they regret it now because of Bugged by Daylight and they were able to clown DBD mobile when it’s not polished, I see killers  with cosmetics all the time on mobile.
---
Killer but ultimately rank 1 is just a waste of time and a kick in the tit
---
Michaela Myers everybody
---
Well i dont know
---
Survivor. Killer emblems are kinda finicky like especially if you play someone with instadowns like billy you end up getting low chaser score.
---
I find it about the same for me but that is prob cause I was used to playing before they removed the pallet vaccums and etc honestly
---
Dude are you a troll? Nobody's saying fucking remove the spirit or turn her into Clown. It's ironic you're talking about people having fun because the only person spirit is fun for is the killer, more than one side exists to this game. Balance isn't one killer who can carpet bomb a game with no effort at all. Have you ever actually played against a Spirit? It's literally impossible to counter her by doing anything other than guessing. And before you make any more dumb accusations that I'm a player that likes fucking with killers, I'm a killer main with hundreds of hours on killer and maybe 50 on survivor.
---
Tier 1 Myers is undetectable by any perk
---
You're right, but maybe they wanna talk to him about a bunch of things, including Pig.
---
Ha! I never had any friends to begin with.. 
---
Any percentage of zero is still zero
---
I have all perks on my Feng (that I currently have unlocked) and it seems the B loodweb won't give you the next tiers for Bills perks unless you've unlocked them. They are sitting at 1-2 each but the Bloodweb isn't offering any perks. Just a sidenote.
---
Awww new players are the most innocent &lt;3 .
---
This was changed in the Undetectable update, he can be detected with Spine Chill and Premonition now
---
I also get mixed with rank 20-16 as a rank 6. But yesterday got an all rank 6 game against a rank16 killer.
---
The only thing that made it interesting was that he played a nurse with good addons, noed and an ebony mori.
---
Not to be the "human weo can only see" guy, but is there *really* a noticable difference between 120 and 200 fps? Genuine question.
---
I guess but at this point it's not even something player is forced to do. You would still get an option if you want to queue with PC players or not. That simply cancels out any complains about the options to begin with. Don't want to be at the disadvantage? Don't enable cross-play in the menu.
---
We can solve all of this by survs die after first phase
---
I mean, that's fine and dandy, but if you're suffering from injury that's not an option. After I sprained my wrist, the struggle phase physically hurts, so I just don't struggle, unless I'm playing with a controller
---
Not going to address all issues you listed bc I'm tired od typing on phone. 
---
About preparation: it can be a mechanic for all killers, while trapper has an exclusive ability to set traps during that. Survivors while preparation is going on will be able to discuss their plans, maybe change their perks or just fuck around.
---
Bloody coil will create that type of situation, where survivor will be forced to watch out for traps moving towards him and disarm them before they snap on their foot. This can be a little weird, but I just like the concept of moving traps
---
Press x to doubt - been called bigfoot
---
wait so when *does* spinechill work and when doesnt it? Genuinely curious
---
Just wanted to be inb4 they release legion 2.0
---
I think a mirror would suffice in this case.
---
I’m wondering too.. ?
---
I’ll try it thx.

I'm gonna make a meme out of this

You do realize the point of ironic shitposts right? Being satire? Being ironic? Being straight up trash, earning the name shitpost? Is this seriously the first time you've come across them? 
---
I didn't make the flair, it's *in* the flair title already.
---
I picked up huntress again for the first time in months for a daily. Used to easily cross map, but now I can’t hit a blendette that‘s running in a straight line
---
When did that happen? And why? Does it have to do with hitboxes?
---
Bruh you got a nuclear base.

especially the dark sense one.. I've never completed 4 gens completely in one game in my life. even when farming. like WTF.
---
^^fuck
---
If it stays the phasing like it is, but when she stops phasing while a survivor is in ?m range, she gets stunned for like 3 sec, meanwhile her model where she started rushes to the new place (like in the clip), would this be balanced? The chased person has time to react and the other Survivors see where shes going? Maybe take the phasing soundtrack out?
---
omg i was gonna put them in visible but i forgot noooo
---
do not... call me out like this
---
I have never seen this or done this. Man it's gotten to a knew low I guess I prefer this over other stuff though, if the survivors are t-bagging at least and the killers don't get blood points.

True, but Behaviour also said they were gonna look into Nurse's addons and then went ahead and changed a few things on her basekit. So it's possible they don't stop there.
---
its supposed to be the exposed status of ghostface haha I know it’s not very recognisable
---
I mean gen rushing something is a bit crying wolf for killers when it probably was that they didn't apply enough pressure or had bad RNG I've had games where at least 2 survivors spawn literally right next to gens so by the time I'm ready 2 gens get popped and sooner or later I lose another when I just started my first chase it is what it is GG
---
Doesnt the loading screen just tell you who's the killer ?
---
To me it gives tips on a specific killer and 100% of the time I face this specific killer
---
Not really. It would deter people from being toxic to other people. People will be less likely to be dicks to other survivors.
---
Only if you’re pretty new. That will stop soon :,)
---
Wasn't me probably then I was thinking of a game a couple days ago. I think I fought a nea but I know I was bubba on hawkins.
---
ok but I do take criticism and this is 10/10 something i will do in the future
---
Takes 2 games for me to earn 1 of those shard things it's not bad seeing as the challenges got me to lvl 17 alone
---
Those are literally subs known to harbor white supremacists and homophobes. Like notoriously. If those are where you call home, talk to an adult you trust about these tendencies. You don’t need to be like this.
---
The ranking system of this game is so wrong. If I see any teammate that is not a red rank, I already know how this game will look like. Even some red ranks are potatoes. The only time where you can guarantee that you are playing with good players is when you hit red ranks early after rank reset. Those players should be fine.

Nice, I've always wanted to play with people on PC while playing on PC!

that’s weird then. what platform do you play on? it’s supposed to stop after you’ve played against each killer once

Otzdarva (the guy in the video) is a really good streamer that attempts to explain everything that he does in his killer videos, from his mindset and thoughts to his overall strategy. He very rarely gets upset and overall has a good attitude about him, but he’s human so it’s understandable that he gets wound up sometimes. I actively watch his streams for killer build ideas and tips, and I think he’s a good person to watch in general. Personally, I think his stream is a good one to catch, as he’s very open to answering things in chat when he catches it, along with his viewers being open to answering questions and being helpful.
---
Monto and Noob3 are also good streamers/youtubers. Noob3 does “play toxic” (flashlight clicking and antagonizing killers into chasing him) as survivor, but he’s a good player and doesn’t take the game all that seriously. He’s got a history of course of editing his item saves, and being a dickhead in the early days of his career but he’s shaped up for the most part. Monto is a really good killer player, and also a strong survivor. He doesn’t really talk much about strategy, but he does fun builds where he just goofs around and tries to play a certain way. He does name call players, but it’s simply calling them potatoes, and I mean, come on we’ve all had games where people aren’t playing well and we poke fun. They aren’t as interactive as Otzdarva, but they are quirky and also have good gameplay.
---
Now what you DONT wanna look for, is Ochido. That man is the absolute scum of the earth and has been banned numerous times.
---
Images you can hear...
---
I’m aware
---
right but 2 games per shard means 20 games per level. When each game is 15 min or so plus the 5 minute queue time, it really drags it out. Challenges should not be basically the only way to level the pass. Lvl 1 challenges were easy but its only going to get harder from here.
---
Pretty sure the game refers to them as Skulls, so neither pip nor tally are actually "official" but most players use pip as far as I know.
---
You completed the first of four challenges and you are more than 1/4 way to finishing the Rift. I would say that is pretty fine. 
---
Levelling is heavily tied with Archives, if you complete the entire thing and play a bit on the side as well then you are maxing out your Rift.
---
Well most games use challenge to be the main way to level up the pass so it makes sense for dbd to do the same but also 20 games per level sounds like a lot but seeing as a game can last from 5 min to 25 min I feel it's fine
---
Literally what? Every single one of those subs is satire. The only exception I can think of is some users come to r/gamersriseup and take it seriously, but are ostracized if people notice they're actually serious. If somebody can find legit racists on the front page of deep fried memes I'll be shocked. 
---
~~Be demeaning all you want~~, I'm in my 20s, and I'm capable of recognizing satirical content, and that the existence of said content is not synonymous with actual homophobia and white supremacism. 
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poe%27s_law
---
And dude, for real, I get heated easily in internet arguments, so sorry, I'm sure I did my fair share of demeaning here. I'm not homophobic, nor do I harbour any other prejudices, with exception to fucking cyclists. I'm used to being able to joke around in places where my intent is clear, and I misjudged the situation in doing so here. I'm sure other people would've been upset, so it's actually good that you commented early. I'm gonna remake the meme in a way that won't make anybody uncomfortable, even accidentally. Something about NOED or tunneling. 
---
Apologies again, I just tend to get pissed instantly lash back when somebody says something I find provocative, and it took me a few minutes to chill out realize it's 5:00am, you're probably a pretty cool person to care that much, even if we don't share the same sense of humor, and that I probably don't need to be hurling insults that would just lower your view of me even more. This feels like a formal letter at this point, so 
---
Have a good day 
---
:)
---
What about legion
---
I have a solution for this. It might be stupid, but it might work, you never know.
---
First, the actual dc’s. If anyone leaves the game on purpose, match should cancel, opposite side should double pip and keep their blood points. What do I mean by that? So, let’s say a survivor left the game, because it is spirit. Game should cancel, spirit should double pip no matter what, keep their blood points until the dc. Remaining survivors should get black pip, no blood points. Survivor who dcs should down a whole rank (I.E. let’s say he is rank 5 with 2 pips. If he dcs his rank should down to rank 6 with 2 pips). Same for killer too. If the killer dcs, survivors(all of them) should double pip and keep their blood points and killer should down a whole rank. If they down rank let’s say 5 times in one season, they should be banned until the next rank reset. Obviously if the dc happens because of the server itself, then you won’t lose a rank.
---
There is also another way for survivors to dc which is killing themselves on the hook. If they change the two phase, it might kinda solve this. Right now the first stage you can try to Kobe 3 times and if you fail all, you’ll get to second phase. What if they change it, so you’ll get one chance, but it won’t punish you, instead of 3 chances which will put you in to the second stage. You can still use deliverance, if you don’t have the perk, you can try once and if you don’t Kobe you have to wait for someone to unhook you. Slippery meat makes it so, you can get two or maybe even 3 chances. Also this makes this perk to be more useful I guess. If you can’t Kobe you should wait 60 seconds before you go to the second stage. But what about second stage? Do you remember the skill checks they showed us during the DS change(the ones that covers pretty much the whole skill check). What if they put those skill checks every 2 or 3 seconds, instead of spamming whatever button you bind it. If you somehow miss one(which is basically impossible unless if you don’t want to hit) you won’t die immediately. Each missed skill check means 2 seconds. If you miss 5/20 skill checks, that means second stage will be 50 seconds instead of 60 seconds. Whether you hit every skill check or miss all of them, you’ll have to be on the hook for at least 80 seconds(which is one gen) and up to 120 seconds if you don’t get unhooked at all(first and second stage timer together).
---
I don’t know, it might sound stupid, but as I said it might work. What do you guys think?
---
Ew
---
He’s there, it’s the yellow bar below the player profile haha, idk about you but I will spot at least two deep wounds effects about a minute into every game
---
The ranking system doesn’t help with the problem either. It provides absolutely nothing besides stricter matchmaking, but somehow it’s treated as if it were life or death, and gives players a free pass to verbally abuse anyone that dares play against them. I feel the game would be much better if the ranking system were removed or at least hidden in the background, because then it’s like “eh, my teammates didn’t do very well, but we got some gems done” instead of “fucking rank 18s need to fucking quit this game, you absolute pieces of dogshit. You (bundle of twigs) clearly don’t know what you’re doing since we didn’t pop 4 generators instantly!” Yeah, that’s extreme and far fetched, but it’s like competitive in any other game, EXCEPT THERE IS NO COMP IN DBD! The ranking system is embedded into the game itself, but has all the negativities of a competitive system, namely rank bias.
---
Its easy to get red ranks as killer, then pipping becomes stupidly hard. Survivor is hard unti, purple ranks and them easy every game
---
You're not funny. And I'm allowed to have an opinion. Your user flair is Evan Snackmillan. How can anyone take you seriously?
---
There is, check the pinned post
---
I don’t understand the problem. This isn’t COD, there’s nothing here that requires precise aiming with the mouse.
---
How would console players be disadvantaged?
---
So when the event ends we'll be unable to get the petal offerings?  Is that all that's tied to the event?
---
Ooooh look at me my user flair is Evan Snackmillan. I romanticize fictional serial killer. Tee hee, I'm so cute!
---
Legion's only strength is making you waste time until they eventually kill everyone.
---
Or finding people. Really.
---
I find killer much easier to get to red rank... but both arent to difficult... just depends on the opponents or your team whether you pip or not...
---
you're not better than people because you dislike something. you're also not better than me for finding something i worked hard on and enjoyed making cringe. im sorry your life is so dull you dont know how to have fun or enjoy things
---
XP is based off how long you are in the trial for. It maxes out at 600XP after 9 minutes. You get a very small Emblem bonus but that equates to around 10-20XP. You also get 300 bonus XP for playing the first Survivor and Killer game of the day.
---
It should be pinhead
---
Just rebind it to F and pay some respect to your survivor
---
Cute art style!
---
thank you!!
---
I agree, but I sincerely doubt DBD could get the rights to that. But you never know I guess, they got stranger things after all. I think pinhead would be Incredible in dbd tho so yes please
---
It's still unlikely to do it on purpose
---
trash boosted by swf a bit too much xd

Survivors have keys both sides have a basic win item

I used a cannibal offering once I got 3 kills but I still got a de-pip.
---
Haha, I can relate to this! And then the hook is right there and a nancy insta-freeing me! :( damn, sauce everywhere and standing afk below the hook for a split second too long.
---
Well I didnt play against each killers so I guess that's why
---
Yep.
---
Her name is Smudge and she has a history of being a food goblin at the table.
---
[This is her Instagram, with various other adorable and meme worthy images.](https://www.instagram.com/smudge_lord/?hl=en)
---
Wow! Well the tips for each killer should only show up once but I guess having them is a nice feature haha
---
WOT?
---
THIS is helpful. So its not based on gameplay at all, only time played?
---
I believe its not available yet but its something that they want to do,
---
 tagging in /u/peanits just to confirm.
---
You don't know true pain until your in struggle phase in the basement and then a Nancy sits in a locker next to you until  you die
---
One of the reasons for games like this "I can do better next game." at least for me. Or trying different stuff.
---
Day of the dead skins.
---
Which is annoying. So far the challenges have been fairly well balanced, allowing you to earn them during normal gameplay. If the game just turns into a farming game well...what's the point.
---
Doing challenges shouldn't be the main drive for leveling though. If someone wants to grind through a level on any other battle pass it doesn't take 4.5 hours. Other battle passes also have way more than 70 levels.
---
Yea we  need one of the reboot masks.
---
No! don't look at this!  
---
Tiddies are temporary, Daddy Myers is forever.
---
Really? I love playing as Myers, even if he isn't all that good (Though I wouldn't say he's underwhelming, he's just mediocre).
---
 It all boils down to the fact that he is just fun to play overall.
---
Kinda looks like Holly from jjba.
---
Great job!
---
Damn free promoting, I wish people would share my channel around like that. Lucky guy, too bad he doesn't deserve it.
---
That's why I have my skill checks on my mouse so I only use one hand.
---
Yeah, but Sony doesn't really give a fuck about any of that.
---
The actual argument that actually gets made at Sony corporate is that the PS4 has a larger userbase than any other console and therefore closed communities are an incentive to buy a PS4 (for the larger multiplayer community) and cross-play is an incentive to buy whatever console you happen to want (because you're buying into the same multiplayer community no matter what) - which is bad for Sony if you happen to want something other than a PS4, obviously. And with Sony just flatly saying no cross-play ever fuck you, BHVR probably doesn't think the benefit of building cross-play infrastructure just for Xbox and Switch is worth it. They may be right. I don't know the console sales / active users data.
---
That said, Sony may have changed their mind about all this last month. I don't really trust them yet, though. People bitched about cross-play for years and Sony kept saying "we have a process in place; if devs want cross-play all they need to do is contact their assigned product manager and work it out," and devs kept saying "so that's a fucking lie, we've talked to everyone we can get a hold of and they always tell us no." Could just be more bullshit.
---
&gt;Sentire99
---
Thank you, man!
---
Its fine, its 70 days to do. And most come from challenges
---
Desync?
---
Visually I don't either. But in consistency and repeatability of mouse distance to camera movement in-game and predicting when and where the character model will stop moving is like night and day for me. Having those extra frames to begin your turn or shot a fraction of a second sooner than a lower FPS player can be the difference in a frag or a death.
---
Feng wasn't receiving cosmetics for loooooooooooooong time before tho, the justice has finaly come.
---
But yea, Jane already has more cosmetics than Adam. I love Jane tho &lt;3
---
Yes please keep nerfing all the killers until none of them are viable. Spirit is fine, it’s just prayer beads that need changing.
---
Demo's scream is the cutest thing I've heard.
---
Now I get the after matches.
---
i tried to boop a snoot and then she stabbed me
---
Somewhere i visit daily
---
I did that and I found it so much worse than just spacebar. I couldn’t properly turn my camera around and after 3 games in struggle phase my finger cramped up. I don’t understand how you can do it.
---
It would be good if the game was ONLY available on steam, playing on consoles is so dumb IMO, on console you cant change graphic settings, if the game has 20 fps you cant change anything about it, the controlls are so weird, i think its not playable on console. It would be better if everybody just used a PC for gaming, i cant understand people who play games on a PS4/xbox.
---
I enjoy going against killers whos power is strong and can end a chase fast if you don't loop/run well but you have the chance to counter the power if you played a loop well or mind game. Its when you play against a power (Like Spirit) where there is no counter play that it can get boring
---
Kate a dying race? U dumb
---
Yes , the petal offerings and Halloween decoration will end after event.
---
But the serum and Rift/Tome will stay. And they will unlock next level tome soon to help get the Rift shards.
---
Devs deconfirmed Creeper a few years ago iirc. Cause it's creator is a pedophile and don't want him represented in their game
---
This one got me good.
---
As a pig (or maybe soon former), i find it fitting she is with leatherface lol. Rip us abandonef by dev ones.
---
By slow down perks you mean gen perks or healing speed perks too?
---
I wish they made the charms attached to a bracelet/necklace or something, or maybe multiple spots you could choose where to place. I play Bill primarily and I’d love to be able to place them on his jacket like War Medals or something.
---
I like the charms anyway. I think they’re cute, but subtle. I can’t wait to finish the Rift and unlock that Nectar Vial/Brand New Part charm.
---
By &lt;10 you mean 11;12...  or 9;7...?  
---
If the latter I think you're wrong, farm maps are extremely survivor sided.
---
I love doctor but i main dlcs
---
Ohhhhh shit, that's fair. That sucks tho, damn.
---
Killeq queue times
---
What the fuck are rosary beads you idiot
---
Ass*
---
He’s having PTSD from the fireworks bro he’s just vibin’
---
This game can smell if you move your hand of the space bar
---
I'm concerned about Clown being so high tbh...
---
Me playing as doc is what keeps me playing
---
Also a lot of people were using omega blink or at least one range addon and now can;t manage playing her without it so they think she's sh\*t now.
---
They also stacks STBFL very quickly, and once they have it stacked, they turn into a demon
---
You actually claim this happened? Ghostface literally stabs you to death before he takes a picture with you. Don’t be so dense dude.
---
I always forget to type out /s at the end when I'm being sarcastic, eh it's okay, I am NOT onboard with either Myers nor GF getting nerfs, my point was that when you nerf the best, the second best gets the the focus, when the second best gets the nerfs, the third best will be the focus. It can be a slippery slope when we're not careful.
---
I wasnt sure cos some subreddits have weird rules lol
---
Idk, boomer
---
9kay
---
It is weird that they need too tweak something in order to make pc players from different stores play in the same environment.
---
I am no Pig main, but I do love the Saw saga. I personally think that Gordon may be a little bit too old for being a character, but Hoffman could definitely work. I think that I would still prefer the cute noises of Amanda though, but it is a possibility.
---
What about the hints? They sometimes give away the killer by giving a coincidental hint about what they do
---
Thanks everyone for the suggestions,I got Huntress for free and bought Ghostface.
---
I really feel this deserves more upvotes. Take my metaphorical 1.7k upvotes, friend! Very creative and also relatable GOD DAMNIT IMA GO PLAY SOME DBD BRB
---
Crossplay is currently only for Steam and Windows store users to be able to play with each other on PC only. BHVR is apparently working on/looking into adding consoles to the mix as well but that seems to still be a ways out.
---
Pun intended on title (?)
---
Why is Gordon old? He is still in his Prime and even prosthesis isn't an obstacle for him.
---
It looks like an anus
---
Sometimes! I don’t really trust them however tbh
---
Had this happen to me too. It's so loud...
---
Thanks :) almost 1hr of intense photoshopping in there😁
---
Indeed lol
---
And what is with Bill? He also doesn't has one...
---
My pokeballs
---
*freeze frame*
---
*record scratch*
---
Yep, that's me. You're probably wondering how I ended up here
---
These are normally eye roll inducing for me.
---
But it's because you did it so well, and it's so true lol
---
Your art style makes me soft agdjfhdjsjddllska it’s SO cute
---
omg thank you!! I’m so glad you like it!
---
doing god's work
---
gotta bring it to the meme level
---
Lmao exactly, and when I an doing a gen and I hear the theme and notice Myers just staring at me the whole time
---
I have a couple clips where two team mates are running towards the same pallet and one goes down , Survivor IQ 9000🤣😉
---
I mean its lot more memeable then 
---
&gt; Doing gens, you?
---
She described as Amanda in the chapter, not someone wearing pig mask. So, no.
---
I tested it day 1 and Spine Chill now works
---
Stop acting like a rude piece of shit, thank you.
---
Makes sense, at least for Amanda. I did a poll asking people what killer they mained and she was #1 at 22% with 65 votes. #2 was ghost face at 9% with 27 votes. So I think it’s clearly a supply and demand type thing.
---
Again my queues are massive and unplayable right now at rank 3 on PC, I dont know where yall are finding these games
---
*Mom said it’s my turn on the Xbox*
---
Image being a Freddy main. YOU ONLY GET THE BLOODY AND NON BLOODY OPTION. SAME FOR BUBBA BUT HE HAS FACES.
---
PLEASE BE THE ALCHEMIST! PLEASE

Does that matter for a good meme?;)

I don't like camping. BUT YOU PISS ME OFF AND IL TUNNEL YOU TO THE NEXT REALM

You able to answer my question?
---
Oh yes
---
what did you use to make this? looks great!
---
Check and see if your ringer is on silent
---
Rude? Where?
---
With the archives if u do the missions u can unlock some "documents" and when u complete one group of documents u unlock a cut scene
---
OchiDO is too dumb for deserve fans.
---
"Her mori is sick" &lt;- love the pun here.
---
For me is the Spirit. I think she is well done and with touch of Japanese culture.
---
I would become a doctor just to do that
---
He indeed had that add on, the trap was disarmed literaly 20 seconds before the start of the clip, and from all the traps on the map it had to be that one, lucky luck himself, Im telling you
---
I say death hook then you can choice. As well they Will die anyway
---
Not pressuring survivors enough, that's what it is.
---
Because i've had it since i started playing DBD a few months ago, played just one game before uncapping the FPS. Have since capped the FPS to test and its indeed FPS related, the hotfix that came out yesterday for the game apparently addressed and fixed this issue and it did not. I've also not had internet issues at all the last 2 years, never lagged, spiked, or gone over 40 ping in any game. it COULD be the dedicated servers being laggy like always which im about to test by capping my FPS. i might vomit looking at 60fps again.
---
I am a rank 1 and I said "you're bad", not "your bad" knobhead.
---
Iron Will and Quick and Quiet for ultimate stealth
---
Oh, you're serious.. So, this is confirmation that most of the people on this sub are boomers.
---
Just search "Ok boomer" on Google, you'll get the first result in urban dictionary.
---
[Link](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Ok%20boomer)
---
Lately, "Ok boomer" has become a meme phrase, and it's been used to much that it's meaning was completely drained. I don't even know what people use it for anymore, I just know that it's ironic.
---
Fact that your are rank 1 doeant mean you are good
---
Yet you rarely face Pigs in trial.

I would probably have to agree with Plague being the best overall killer for style and lore. But off of just style alone, I love the Wraith, he just has such a distinct silhouette that gives a bit of an otherworldly vibe to him that stands against the rest of the cast that is largely just more normally proportioned people.
---
&gt; it COULD be the dedicated servers being laggy 
---
That's exactly why I'm asking
---
And on 1 of the nurses head piece she has a blind fold
---
"your are" lmao. Shut up, kid. I never said I was good. I know I have some things to work on but if you actually read the post you'd see why I called him bad.
---
Haha, thanks, I hear from everyone that they suck but so far Ive been loving Legion to be honest
---
Seriously though. If one DC's, and ones dead, hooks Kate for the second time and she has no chance of escape because it's struggle. Then hooks you, who may have a chance to get off the hook. There is no one else to chase. What was he supposed to do other than face camp you? It's not like he could go hunt other survivors or stop gen progression. You may think he's bad, but it also seems that you're just mad.
---
Thank you, I just used the default brushes in Photoshop
---
So it means something like what you say to someone whos ignorant and is completelu misinformed like thier from an oldee generation?
---
Well considering it wasnt me lagging back 5 meters like the dedis make me, and its just my character stuttering, its fairly safe to assume its not the dedis. Had the stutters like this long before the dedis and the stutters are very different to dedi lag.
---
If you can pick up mechanics just by watching, Zubat.
---
If you need explanations, then prolly Otzdarva for killer, and Dark Academy series by Ardetha for survivor.
---
One of my friends has maybe 10 hours and every time spine chill goes off he screams “KILLERS ON ME” and I’ve been baited so many times I just have to ignore him at this point.
---
Got me it’s clown!
---
His backstory is well done and gives enough reasons why he is doing what he does!
---
And his asthetic is exactly what I would imagine from a psychopath living in a circus to hide who he is and to get more victims!
---
I did! The conversation went more like
---
“Are you still being chased”
---
“Yeah I’m about to go down”
---
*goes down but doesn’t get picked up* 
---
“Is he not picking you up?”
---
“No! He’s taking a picture with me!”
---
But I couldn’t really fit that all into a meme :)
---
I'd run the two reappearance add-ons and just stand in my husk the Sprint just as fast at them when leaving phase. They'll think it's my husk, but it's much worse
---
If I didn’t have a laser optical keyboard I’d hate mashing space to no fucking end.
---
I agree with the hate on this man.. but you know that not everybody’s first language is english ?
---
No, I'm not mad. He clearly thinks so highly of himself. He tunnels and barely knows how to use Billy. He nodded me on the hook due to me failing at unhooking myself. I'm not a psychologist but all signs point to him being the angry one. At what? I have no idea.
---
yikes
---
I don’t hate Ochi, never did. I used to watch his videos a lot tho. Haven’t watched him much besides his compilations ever since he went through his reform
---
You so

Fuckin

**SMILE**

I remembered playing a game as the doctor for a daily and well everyone was really good but then you had an ash who was half decent but I felt bad for him because he kept hiding in lockers and failing skill checks. I gave him the hatch after he stopped wiggling
---
I've never used win store before. Does this mean that if I have the game bought in my XB1 I can play it in my PC? And if so, is there a sync with the xbox version?
---
I absolutely love the doctor's lore and design it's literally one of the reason I purchased him
---
Gotta give mine to Ghost Face even though he's partially a licensed character the actual backstory of the man Danny Johnson was made by BHVR and honestly speaking it's really spot on.  Everything about it feels like how a narcissist serial killer would be by day a news reporter reporting on his own murders he commits at night.  This combined with the fact that all the flavor text of his cosmetics and addons seems like it was written for Danny himself really paints the image of a man who is in love with himself and what he does which in this case is serial killing.  I mean just the idea that he himself placed a camera in a victims home just for the sole purpose of catching himself on tape in combination with his mori where he takes a selfy with his victim really shows off this narcissistic personality.
---
She's better than huntress in a chase. You can use it faster and it's borderline impossible to dodge.
---
Plus keep in mind a lot of times people will still be broken when she finds them with the purge.
---
the legion, aesthetically. i love the edgy four teenagers. and i love how they're the only killer that's tied to the survivor they came with.  and he has literally the best realistic mori, that actually shows survivor struggling against them, but they just knife him down. 
---
lorewise, either wraith or, surprisingly, clown. 
---
wraith because he's so pure at first, but then it becomes a mindfuck . guess killing people unwillingly and unknowingly does mess with ya first time.
---
clown because it's depicted how he came to be the way he is. it's slow, and it goes up. it's long and i enjoyed reading it.
---
It's also possible you're don't get lucky on a huge map, survivors 2stacking on 2 gens as soon as they spawn and you don't find them right away, etc. "Not enough pressure" has its place in an argument, I agree there, but without Ruin on a big map, or Hawkins for example, you can just lose 2-3 gens in 2-3 minutes with a number of killers just because you can't apply pressure fast enough to every corner of the map. It's a bad feeling, and it kind of makes things like Ruin feel almost 100% necessary just to slow the game down enough to play as any of the non-meta killers (and sometimes even on the meta killers). I think (or at least feel like) most killers would agree they wouldn't feel pressured to run Ruin if generators took just a little longer to fully repair. I know I would stop running it if I knew that gens wouldn't pop like a fresh bowl of rice crispies.
---
I always cleanse, because NOED exists.
---
i used to be a doctor main at first for the same reason. 
---
doc's sick, and his lore's sick.
---
A good build I use is thano(nurse perk), Hex: Ruin(hag perk), BBQ and chili(Cannibal Perk), and Overcharge(Doctor Perk) Keep kicking and keep stabbing and you got yourself a win.
---
Reminds me of the first perk I ever got, premonition. You think new people are bad for getting off gens at hearing the slightest heartbeat, yet every time my perk triggered I would be immersed in a corner until it recharged.
---
They dont know how to loop but God the know how to rush
---
hope not a neuroscientist, the world is not ready for a new real-life Herman Carter.
---
Yeah I forgot about them as I drew this at like 2 AM! Big regret
---
You play vs her once a month because nobody clenses vs her and she's just a boring better Myers.
---
&gt;Everyone acts like she’s a problem. She’s not.
---
Nobody acts like she's a problem? People just aknowledge that corrupt purge is really strong and you shouldn't be giving it to her.
---
Well excuuuuuse meeee for not chasing 4 survivors at the same time.
---
Interesting.  Thanks for the clarification.
---
Lore wise? Spirit, I really like her back story.
---
Joey looks hot with his design and posture.
---
Iam a kid? You got so mad at a video game that you had to write a post about it. Saying he can't use Billy, he still managed to get 3K, so you must be even worse than him
---
Imagine the other 3 trapping one in the corner
---
Imagine the other 3 Trapping one in the corner
---
Never played this game, explanation?
---
GF doesn't have to desperately try to stalk someone at no movement speed to become a fully functional killer. 
---
Myers' power cannot be waited out by hiding when he pops it on someone else. His power can't be saved for later, you are using it here and now. GF is also better at stealth, having 0 terror radius without using any perks.

Imo ruin is just there to be a distraction while I'm putting up more traps
---
yea you fly through when you're doing challenges but normal leveling when they're done is painfully slow.
---
It’s not like he’s trying to improve on his English or grammar, one of his main points of “comedy” on his channel is that he talks like a caveman and he’s really loud
---
I'm not mad, just annoyed. At the Billy and the sensitive cry babies in this comment section, like yourself.
---
Unless you're a ghost standing around AfK somewhere xD
---
She can use her purge really easily to get hits over pallets and loops. Seems to me you just go against a lot of really bad plagues.
---
&gt;For some reason, people would rather be at 1 health state instead of 2.
---
Because the extra health state hardly matters in a chase vs her when she has her hurt juice. She doesn't have to aim it well, she's faster than huntress, she can use the power near-instantly. 
---
If you are vs potato killers then yeah, clense all you want.
---
Imagine thinking internet names are legit so does that mean you are a very pissed off animal that somehow find the ability to type?
---
While true at some level, other battle passes get daily challenges to help with the leveling. 
---
Perhaps the dailies should give a fragment or 2.
---
being chased is not the only way for them to be occupied
---
I'm the one who types broken English? Look at the beginning of your comment. English is my first and only language. What exactly do you mean by 'the way you word things'? Do you just expect everyone to think the same way? Also, do you think people don't type and think at the same time? Do you just expect everyone to think up exactly what they're going to say and type it all out?
---
I am baffled. The irony in this is hilarious. I'm going to sacrifice a bit of my time and fix your conment just for you. No need to thank me.
---
&gt; I'm almost certain you're the child. The way you word things means that either English isn't your natural language or you are trying to think and type at the same time. Your brain is actually having an aneurysm.
---
21*
---
I mean that's cool that you're willing to take the L and place the blame on yourself, but that doesn't change the truth of the matter that it can and will happen frequently due to any combination of poor luck, very skilled survivors, or bad play/mistakes. I don't think anyone places the blame squarely and solely on the game itself, but you can't deny that sometimes you just get screwed and there's nothing you could have done to change the outcome except run ruin to try and slow the game down slightly.
---
You know what they say. Don't call yourself a pansexual if you can't shove a whole frying pan up your ass.
---
mhh I wore that pretty retro shirt from the 80s pack 🤔
---
 You look like a fool to everyone else in the match.  When I get face camped it tells me two things. I know I did my job as a survivor, and this killer is a noob. Your celebration is also mine.. as the rest of the team escapes and you get ONE survivor
---
u mad
---
My survivor queue times are short
---
It's strong but that's like complain about a strong pallet you can play around the windows usually a 115% killer gives the survivors 2 loops max and 110% gives 3.. but most killers can shut down a window loop forcing the survivor to leave
---
No, just annoyed.
---
Not lag. Desync.
---
Most of the time, it's a map issue.
---
Sometimes it needs a lag to happen when you're going up against a specific part of the wall, but most of them work no matter how good the connection is
---
If it was a lag, he'd get teleported to bubba the moment he got hit
---
My poor Dwight just wanted to help his teammates, let him live  😂😁
---
How does it feel being this stupid? Like all of your comments are like one sentence long. Do you simply lack the brain to make a point that is not a stupid one-liner?
---
Good for you?
---
You are either on switch, or having some kind of error. Survivor que times are usually instant.
---
I used to play with those kind of shirts When I was main Dwight and I didnt get tunneled, did you use OoO or any "toxic" Perks?
---
20 bucks he was playing Billy
---
As the unreleased survivor, rescue 8 gens from the hook with the help of the killer while your teammates pop 13 gens in the exact same time
---
Must be done in one trial or this challenge dissapears forever
---
They are also the ones that weren't available on the switch
---
I think BHVR has issues with those licences
---
nah its between steam and windows store
---
Just Microsoft store and steam no console
---
Not really, just the main Dwight perks, but maybe it was just bad luck
---
Remember the old days? Wraith used to drag a chain full of bones so you were able to hear him from like 15 meters
---
I love spirit and the plague. Spirit whole aesthetic, animations and the sword are all fantastic to me. 
---
Plague on the same level. It a tall beautiful priestess who thinks she is doing gods work.
---
I feel you man. Just had a game on cowshed where not only did they have god window but meat tree had a jungle gym spawn right next to it. Like yea, nope thats a dc. I dont care im not putting up with that lol.
---
LMAO WHAT THE FUCK
---
No good for you buddy
---
Yea this window is a strong loop but not unfair.
---
Behaviour closed many windows anyway and changed jungle gyms already. Windows are actually fine at this point. There are of course a few still very strong once but you still be able to deal with them. 
---
You can use killer ability like hag or trapper to deal with windows or even use the perk thats made to block windows. Also they cant always stay at the main building they arent able to run over there everytime.
---
Dont care about that one gen inside. Avoid long loops. You are the killer, you decide the gens you try to protect.
---
People like her, but not playing her
---
they always insta save you that time
---
Almost my life story because I still get played
---
He has two strong perks and some alright gameplay. There are better killers available with better perks in my humble opinion, however if you wanna run around as jiggles the clown and get you some sweet sweet survivor digits who am I to discourage you?
---
There’s an offering the killer can use called a Mori where they can kill survivors by hand. Every killer has a unique Mori animation. Ghost face stabs them up then takes a photo with the now deceased player. He holds their head up and takes a snapshot with them lol
---
hex implies the totem is lit, in this case it could potentially be haunted grounds that's the reason for the doubt in cleansing or not
---
but it could always be devour hope so the right decision is to cleanse even if it costs a down or two
---
On a large map with no ruin, my usual plan is too find the tightest cluster of 3 gens and protect them like my entity wants me too. Obviously depends on what killer I'm playing. If I'm using a killer that can run the map quickly then I'll hunt. But if not. Best believe I'm giving you those 4 gens easy
---
21 games where 3/4 survivors will DC upon first down.. Good luck with them..
---
Why wouldn't it be? I don't want to hear your lousy story on how you played against bad survivors.
---
I think what kills it for me is the times I have to wait to find a game only for someone to dc. I would play have grinded but it worthless since idk if i can make it.
---
Yeah, some killers pay their frustration in a past game with the next lobby.
---
Pretty much
---
You're the one with the child. Nvm new topic BTW 
---
Also pretty sure that since you have time to get to red ranks I assume you didn't do to well in school or you wouldnt be here bitching you would be at work so why don't you just stfu and get over yourself
---
Just for that im gunna play some clown before work
---
The trade-off is now you don’t need Monitor &amp; Abuse to have a 0m Terror Radius, giving you another perk slot.
---
Ah, I'm with you.
---
r/suicidebywords
---
Where have I cried? I have brought up points and even asked questions, which, did not get replied to by you. You just insisted you are not mad and completely disregarded what I had said. Meanwhile you come here to complain and try to call out the Billy who probably doesn't give a damn about you, and didn't reply when you complained directly to them. So you had to go and spread how upset you were and make sure people could see just how upset you are. But, I expect so other half baked response which I really don't care for because you are just going to keep containing anyway. Take some time, calm yourself, relax, and move on with your day. Hope you feel better soon and I hope you have more favorable games going forward.
---
bo hoo let me press L on the worlds smallest keyboard
---
Cosmetics don't follow these types of rules. Look at flower hag for example, which essentially changes the character into a different monster - it's not the same hag anymore, you dig?
---
How do you "main" a character without playing him/her?
---
Ikr
---
Yeah you can't really counter those windows, bamboozle is a joke
---
Say that in red ranks
---
This is a fine idea but couldn't you mismatch bodies and heads? For legion it works ok but idk if it would work for Pig.
---
Tbh, the Demogorgon being an extra dimensional being gives it some leniensy while Nurse can literally go through solid matter.. and she hunts for breaths. Might be that she just senses the breathing of living creatures, so she can collect their breaths as well.
---
Good on ya
---
If you use dweard or pizza dwight, then they hate you
---
Regular dwight always gets the hatch
---
I'm a sis but thanks for the tip! How do you time 360's perfectly? I always do it either too early or too late. I'm in green ranks
---
He stabs you one time...
---
Just harden up and play the map dude, it's just childish to DC and ruin everyone else's game.
---
Please use the pinned Megathread.

Idk man what does that even mean anymore

When you immediately fail as the designated asshole in your swf group
---
Time to bring your friend into a game and doot the snoot
---
If the exit gates are open, why would the killer not camp? It's the only time I think it's a reasonable strat
---
The Clown
---
You can not actively force a survivor to stop running this tile until entity blocker appears and when it does they bought so much time that most gens r done by then so i lose
---
i play every killer
---
i was playing ghostface
---
Ah legion. My legion build is Thanataphobia (this will slow their actions while injured and as legion you will injure easier than about any killer)
---
 Save the Best for Last (this perk will decrease your cooldown whenever you swing your knife. Every time you hit a survivor that isn't your obsession you get a token up to 8. And as legion you can hit people twice for nothing thanks to frenzy. Hits rack up quick and you become one fast ass bitch) 
---
A Nurses Calling (the little Thanataphobia icon just begs survivors to heal themselves. They for some reason can't help it. I don't understand. PUNISH IT. keep them injured and wasting time. This perks let's you see the survivor's auras whenever theyre healing within a 28 meter radius.)
---
Monitor and abuse (While in a Chase, your terror radius is increased by 8 metres.Otherwise, your Terror Radius is decreased by 8 metres and your Field of View is increased. Let's you get the drop on survivors easier. It's a subtle perk but you'll notice it working for you when you're sprinting up on their ass before they had time to stop doing the gen)
---
You can also swap in Sloppy butcher to further discourage healing. Making healing a slow slog. You can use Ruin as well to slow the game down justalittlebit. Or corrupt intervention. Or discordance to keep them from buddying up but it'll have you sprinting around if they're good.
---
The goal of legion is to keep them injured, mending, panicked, and not doing gens. Frenzy let's you know where people are so use that often for information if you need to.  Knowing what they're up to can save your booty. So frenzy stab someone for the info, see the others are fucking off elsewhere, then stab that guy again for the STBFL stacks. Then down him. Another sweet stack. 
---
That's just how I play and have success with legion at red ranks. Have fun!
---
You might play every character equally but consider yourself a main of one of them.
---
You might also “main” someone but have a break from playing them after they got nerfed. 
---
They are still the option you are tied emotionally to the most
---
* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, …).
---
I looped a clown for a while just for him to leave me 
---
Amazing
---
so them running a tile and getting 4 gens done due to this single window and every time i go chase someone else they do the exact same thing, isnt that ruining my game? and its not like i wanna dc but on this map i dont feel like i have a chase due to blatant abuse of this single window. and no whats childish is to try to be edgy by calling someone out when these windows are a common cause for ppl to not play certain maps due to ridiculous nature of chasing a survivor at it
---
Dang right it is .
---
Better watch some more truetalent, who is known for his totally unbiased view of the game amirite
---
I think low rank games heavily favour killers. You don't need ruin because gens just don't get done with everyone hiding as soon as hearing heartbeat.
---
...or even finding a gen in maps like gideon meat plant lol.
---
 Kate's perk (dance with me was it?) Is another good one for beginner too but they take precious slots...in a game already heavily favouring killer since low rank survivors don't know about loops, pallet placements etc...whereas new killers can simply patrol gens or just face camp (even though it's not a good thing to pip..but I don't think game does good job telling them that hence my idea if kindred)
---
Looks like I missed the part where the terminator can’t move with his handgun, that could be pretty balanced depending on how long it takes to pull it up and fire.  Still think he’s probably better than huntress because of the second ability, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. As for NNFAW the prerequisite is at worse the same as spirit fury, depending on how you play pallet loops, and the reward is so much better, plus it cannot be countered by dropping pallets early. And the shotgun... I guess it’s not the same as a flashlight, but still busted. 6 shots is a lot of shots, consider how everyone on the team might bring one making 24 shots. Consider changing it so you can’t make the killer drop survs, I also foresee chain stunning where someone might just unload every shot into the killer in order to make him drop his surv, so I would prevent that. On a coordinated SWF team, the killer would have to make it through 24 shots before he could pick anybody up, that speaks for itself.
---
Even some of the very best killers in the game still run Ruin just because of how invaluable it is for slowing the game down. Certain content creators, like Otz for example, do plenty of builds without Ruin but instead run Thrilling Tremors or Pop Goes the Weasle. Either way, almost every killer content creator I know of runs some sort of anti-gen perk (sometimes more than one). Monto runs Ruin on basically every build, Otz uses Pop most frequently, but also runs Ruin occasionally, etc. Again, it's very humble of you to admit when you personally got outplayed/didn't run a perfect game, but the vast majority, including publicly visible skilled killers, run it because it is practically necessary at high ranks.

I think the charms are dumb so i wont buy it unless i finish it since i get my money back but you're not missing much if you don't complete it.
---
Exactly, secure the kill, it’s all you can really do at that point to make sure you do
---
"I'm a Legion main, but since their nerf I play 99% of my games as a Spirit" - just doesn't sound right to me.
---
Don’t hit them with that nonsense! People have their 4 slots and they’re gonna use them how they want damnit! As killer main though seriously... don’t tell them about IW please Kay thanks.

Me and a friend have both had an experience where we fell from a chair because of a stalth killer. My friend ran straight into a stalking ghost face becuase -and i quote- "i thought it was a bush".Me on the other hand, i ran into a no tr tier 2 myers while looking for hatch and he was standing in a dark conrer. He popped tier 3 right jnfont of me and i only survived becuase he missed and i was next to the hatch so i could escpae from the floor
---
Of course that's a subreddit...
---
I got rank 1 with both sides and survivor is dumb easy, way easier than killer
---
Makes chases take less than half the time
---
Me too tbh
---
Thats why you shouldnt chase people there. catch people on other places of the map. Remind you lead the direction of  a chase dont giv them the chance to run back to the main building.
---
Wait.
---
No. 
---
That’s the dumbest thing I’ve read here- of course you need perks to counter killers m- we have so many to counter survivors.  Both sides have multiple counterplays to a lot of the gameplay styles that exist. Prayer beads in the busted add on - THATS what people should be pissed off about,
---
No
---
Nobody plays him
---
As it stands now, there's no real interaction the Killer can have with the Obsession. You either have to leave them alone, letting them do whatever they want completely unimpeded by DL, or keep them slugged / on the hook, earning no progress toward stacks and potentially killing them (losing the benefit of DL entirely).
---
In general, Obsession perks are supposed to reward creative play around the Obsession. New DL doesn't allow you to play around them at all.
---
The funny thing is this strategy is being actively discouraged in the ranking system. You lose points if gens are done too fast at the start of the map and you lose points for every gen finished. Even though it is a legit and smart strategy for some of the slower killers...
---
Because it’s a major crutch perk, just like ruin. The same way self heal and sprint burst are major crutches for survivors.
---
Iron Will doesn't reduce normal breathing, as far as I know. I can test it.
---
I never said I didn’t have the same reaction to survivor perks like adrenaline, but nice job assuming
---
I never realised he actually has eyes
---
The movie trailers narrator
---
I think that might be the worst solution of the three, only because (unlike STBFL and PWYF) there's no way for the Killer to \*lose\* Dying Light stacks. I'd still be fine with it, but I feel like adding Obsession hooks to the stacks instead would make for better interaction on both the Killer and Survivor sides.
---
he needs the chair from breaking bad
---
Why am a dick for calling out, what I believe to be, fake? People do it all the time on Reddit. I think that I make a pretty good point, Reddit doesn't. Why am a dick? Did you come to that conclusion by the amounts of downvotes?
---
It’s just a meme! He had never seen a mori before so it was funny hearing his reaction, but he obviously knew he was dying lmao
---
Okay, survivor que times are usually ALMOST instant.
---
Why? We'll get Speedo Quentin one day. I'm sure of it!
---
I can be patient.
---
Well, your reply kinda sounded rude, and I would personally love more cosmetics for pig, even if they are different people. I play pig and mostly just change between the 2 body cosmetics for her.

Bing bong, drawing is great; Tak my upvote, ding dong
---
Cry more
---
All you have to do to counter is cleanse 5 totems lol, I agree that it’s a crutch perk and that killers can 4k from only getting one hook all game but just do totems ...
---
So i just tested this for an hour, the stutters from the FPS being uncapped were not fixed. Easiest test, try to moonwalk on uncapped vs capped fps. Its not possible on uncapped you'll get maybe half a second in, but its entirely possible on capped. Still had the laggy dedi servers being shit like always but the apparent stutter fix didn't fix a thing, at least not for me.
---
I was referring to "a break after nerf". Pig was nerfed a long time ago.
---
Ruin is necessary if you don’t want 3 gens to be popped in 2 minutes
---
I’ve seen you. You were on the for honor sub. Why are you everywhere.
---
There’s been an issue at pallets since the rift was implemented. They are delayed or something, I can rarely get pallet stuns and am always getting downed
---
How precious!
---
Ok thanks
---
do you have a 144hz monitor? Because if you don't see a difference between 60 and 120 you might want to get your eyes tested and this isnt me taking the piss. Either get them tested or play at 120 for a month then try 60 and tell me you cant see the difference, theres a drastic difference between 60 and 90 let alone 120 or 144 (who even has a 120hz monitor?). There is a huge difference, especially in FPS games.
---
Poor stupid claudettes
---
He does have one! It's a bit obscured by blood and grime and all that... lol
---
Empathy is great for map awareness and finding injured people. Bond is probably better but has a smaller range.
---
Who has Blood Warden?
---
Ya i take pride in that. Don't like the death threats the sometimes give though
---
What's that?
---
Honestly Ghost Face is one of the only Mori’s I never mind getting used on me because it’s so perfect.
---
You can say that but it’s a issue because it rewards players with instant downs that shouldn’t have happened in the first place. The killers should be learning how to prevent survivors from doing gens while taking them out, but instead they are getting the opportunity to get kills after playing like crap the entire game. It’s a crutch perk that rewards bad behavior
---
A problem with that, is there?
---
Don't need perks when you have beads. Yikes.
---
Didnt mean nothing by that, wraith is my 2nd fav to play against (1st being ghostfaces who play sneaky), its just that I've been off and on playing since launch and Wraith has just kinda sucked ever since people just got better at the game. :(
---
So stupid that he exists as he does now when the spirit does basically the exact same thing, but just better.
---
Related sidenote: I fucking hate playing against the spirit
---
I agree! I don’t mind the pigs because of how fast it is, but I think ghost face’s is the best one :)
---
Seems like a direct 'DBD themed' rip off
---
I'm good with the entirety of Legion being there with all 4 having very small terror radius. He was supposed to be mistaken for a survivor, least that's what the trailer suggested.
---
Rank 1 Legion main here, I use Ruin, BBQ, Thanatophobia, and STBFL. When using your frenzy you can stab somebody twice and get 2 stacks of STBFL
---
How about DL stacked with STBFL/PWYF?
---
I always let Survivors boop the snoot when they spam that emote.
---
Please don't. Makes me not Wanne kill ya. Ruins the mood
---
It sucks cause he's actually pretty fun to play/play against. I think Ill play him after work.
---
I am omnipresent, that’s why
---
I still down and hook the obsession if there’s nobody else around me however, it is not like save the best for last; where you lose stacks for hitting the obsession, but you can still down and hit the obsession like normal anyways. You’ll only be punished if they die.
---
Disagree that Dying Light isn't good, but I agree having more interaction with the Obsession would be nice.
---
Maybe it could work like STBFL? 
---
So the perk stays active if your Obsession dies, but downing them (so you can't just slug them instead of hooking them) removes tokens and once they're dead you can't gain new tokens. 
---
It'd suck against Decisive yea, but in most other situations it'd be great and DS is already easy to work around.
---
Doot the snoot right now or I am bringing a green Mori just for you.
---
Empathy, borrowed time, were gonna live forever and botany. 
---
Theres a few more, but this is the one I use.
---
When God clearly doesn't like you.
---
I've played on a 144hz and I noticed fuck all of a difference from my 60hz
---
Agreed. I cannot stand 60 FPS on my computer screens anymore after used a 144 monitor.
---
I´d be a tiny bit salty as Jake, not gonna lie
---
Well gotta hook me first. SO GAME ON
---
well my mane ain't a lie my friend I can be a fruit at times
---
I always run we’ll make it sometimes with botany, I almost always am able to fully heal the person I unhooked before the killer gets back, and it lasts for 90 seconds at tier three so you can heal others quickly too
---
yea he has no counter to that
---
Piggy is such an underrated chaarcter... She's an A-tier Killer, in my experience. Maybe, it's just because I play on console.
---
Combine it with Thanatophobia. That way if you hook the obsession, you can still have a debuff for hooking them. However, the stacks vanishing when Obsession dies is lame. The perk needs a rename tbh.
---
You said it yourself, this is DBD. You have infinite more options.
---
I really think they should make that a permanent change. Keep it the default view when selecting the killer. then if you want to change your parts it will move to the full body view.
---
I can hear this picture
---
Yep, perfectly fine. But mori cancelling? Take this ban you toxic asshole!
---
Then you give up on that case and catch them when they have left that loop and are in a bad spot just like a survivor wouldn't want to go to a area they know the trapper has been in bc it could have potential traps meaning it is a bad spot
---
True but then that kinda defeats the purpose of borrowed time and baby sitter, no? I’ll def give it a shot though thx for the suggestion
---
in this picture, I am
---
Like this, I do not
---
pretty much
---
We’ll make it as well as Open Handed are nice for someone on the team to run as well.
---
This idea sucks. Cypress is fine as is.
---
The other two need to require two hooks.
---
I'm on a clowning streak at rank 1 without Ruin. Clown is so much better than people give him credit for. Interrupting actions with bottle hits, throwing the bottles higher to cover the area in gas, reload baiting to make a survivor not drop a pallet. He's got so many useful abilities. 
---
I do think he needs a significant buff, but he's nowhere near Legion levels of awful. All he needs is a little more map pressure or something, like have the gas last longer and show auras for a couple seconds if someone walks through it outside your TR.
---
yeah but again i shouldnt be forced to place a killer or run bamboozle to compensate for poor map design
---
Maybe swap babysitter for second wind? Then you’ll have borrowed time in case the killer is nearby, and since you can fully heal someone quickly you’ll have second wind ready for when you get hooked
---
The only killer I want is the Thing from the 1982 horror movie called The Thing.
---
That jake should have let her go first instead of trying to be selfish and get away by himself. He had it coming
---
#BOMP
---
i shouldnt be forced to play trapper due to bad map design, and they could just disarm it anyway maybe catching one person off guard if im lucky
---
I didn’t research for if what you said is true, but even if your eye can only capture 60Hz, it is not like your eye will sync with the monitor and captures the update every 1 of the 60 frames perfectly. Make the FPS higher means what you captured is a much more recent update, which means it will be much more smoother and saves you just a little bit reaction time.
---

Fuller video [here.](https://youtu.be/rTEhou2Jm-w)
---
Ruin: Almost necessary unless you're a killer with good map pressure to keep 2-3 gens from popping in the first minute. 
---
Self-care: HAH IN 2019, use Bond lol
---
Sprint Burst: I am Speed for 3 seconds. If you're walking up to a survivor and they aren't immediately running, they couldn't be more obvious that they got SB.
---
Mither, you must have not
---
then, botany, self care, autodidact, you need
---
a ranger medkit with gauze and gel-thingy, you must equip
---
This is lag not hit box issue
---
Yeah this. You're just meant to prolong the chase for as long as possible.
---
*And them legs tho* **DAMN THATS SOME NICE LEGS**
---
what a no brain play
---
4 survivors accidentally killed Frank, so now Dwight, Claudette, Feng, and Meg have Legion powers. It's like Tim Allen's Santa Clause movie.
---
Ha! You dare to assume I have any friends to play games with?
---
*Curls up into a ball in the corner eating ice cream as I load in for killer/solo survivor queues*
---
You should only do 360s if you have absolutely nowhere to go and the killer will hit you no matter what, might aswell die trying
---
You need Enduring with spirit fury to get the best performance for ending a chase
---
hey, triggered my vacuums, you have
---
now absorb the putrid serum, how will I?
---
Yet every time a weaker killer is played, the survivors teabag and bully them in post-game chat. Make up your mind.
---
It would be cool if the void husks were also involved somehow.
---
BHVR considers an average, balanced match "2 die, 2 escape".
---
This means that by design, all the generators are expected to pop in an average game of Dead By Daylight. The window of time between the last generator popping and the last survivor escaping/dying is just as valid as the rest of the match. 
---
It's not 'playing like crap' to have the gens get done, it's playing like an average player.
---
Yeah it does suck :( I love him so much but playing him is a real 50/50 thing based on map, etc.
---
I wasn’t saying playing like crap was letting the gens get done, I was saying relying on one perk to get all your kills because you couldn’t get any survivors in the amount of time they did 5 gens is playing like crap
---
t the dweet
---
Was watching my step brother play and he did this twice in one game versus a Myers minus the noed.
---
It takes some practice but always know your surroundings. While you're doing a gen, look around and plan around that. "If the killer comes this way, I'll go that way." Recognize what structures and such are around the area you're working in. It's a lot of map knowledge and planning. 
---
Similar when I play killer, I go into an area wanting survivors to run a certain way. If they dont (the fun starts) and I get to adapt and overcome on the fly.
---
Yeah I play strong killers only when I play killers. The game is already survivor side and I know I am not a fantastic player who can make weak killers work most of the time.
---
Why would u ask if he’s still being chased when the game tells u when ur tm’s are downed
---
That's okay, I'll
---
Ahhh.
---
Now I remember!
---
Awesome,thanks
---
I'm a red/purple rank Survivor with 10+min queue times
---
How do you do that?
---
I think genrush exists, it's just not what 90% of people think it is. True rush is letting a teammate hit struggle or die to pop gens.
---
“Cracks knuckles” okay who the FUCK is teabagging that cat
---
Are you getting 144fps on the games you are playing? There is a big BIG difference, everything just flows like butter, 60hz has ghosting and is choppy.
---
Azarov's Resting Place is the best for that
---
“Cocks shotgun” you wanna say that again I dont think I heard you correctly it almost sounds like you would teabag that cute little kitty
---
Do people actually complain about 'genrushing'? Isn't 'genrushing' also known as 'playing the objective as a survivor'? lol
---
I recommend plague, her power is unique and unlike anything else in the game and if games go right she can be really scary to go against
---
I use Dying Light and Pop Goes The Weasel together. I target everyone who isn't my Obsession and then I try to use my Pop Goes The Weasel on the generator the Obsession was working on. I usually try to get a three generator setup while using Dying Light as well, because it's far more powerful if you can manage that come end game so long as they don't have a key and the hatch isn't too far away from your setup. If you combo this furthermore with a good movement Killer or trap Killer then I find it especially effective.
---
Had a game a couple days ago where I was trying out meyers and I had already killed 2 people and left claudette in the large basement dying on badham because i couldn't actually move out to hook her in time and she tbagged at me earlier
---
I felt this way when the last person ran up to find me and stopped in front of my face, so we farmed, they did the last 4 gens i opened the gate and sent them on their way
---
(Claudette ended up crawling out of the basement looking for a res and i hooked her and me and nea watched her get sacced)
---
“Smell my fingers”
---
I agree with Int3r4ct that it is a win-more perk. Dying Light relies on hooking survivors. So if you're doing that, you're probably already winning and the stacks of Dying Light become largely irrelevant.
---
Video for a more detailed explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdl_4H7dMKc&amp;t=1m55s
---
Or just make her noclip when phasing.
---
Oh shit what she doin? No worries I ain’t stressing, she just vibin
---
Then you'd have killers slugging for 60 seconds at the end of every game.
---
What is this experiment?
---
No worries friend
---
They should have done it like the summer BBQ event, where you get extra blood points AND a free cosmetic if you do enough.
---
&gt;neurologists (the proper term)
---
thanks for pointing that out. i wasn't sure i said the right word so now i know.
---
&gt; People have been looking for methods of torture and information extraction for a very long time. Like, a *really* long time. 
---
yeah, that's why i said *new!* there are people like him, of course, but even more? and who knows how far a 'new' one will go? the world shall never know for its own benefit.
---
Are you sure? Because that's what I hear every damn match!
---
I don’t know if that’s necessarily true? My killer ranks about 9 and I’ve gone up against 3 red ranks +like a 10 or 12 multiple times. It might just be very loose average.
---
Love the concept, my guy. now you'd have to make 3 more for the rest of em.
---
Xd
---
When there's no visible or audio cues I'm even more terrified than when there is.
---
However when I see Jigsaw boxes I shit myself.
---
Wouldnt solve the fact that there is no counterplay to her power. When she's phasing you cant know so noclipping her would just make her more sound reliant and be able to go through bodyblocked pallets and hit the survivor with no problem
---
He's speedhacking, Tru3talent has a ton of videos catching people doing the same shit

---
There are also survivors to be saved.
---
all you need to learn is how to mind-game and end chases quickly and now no one can just sit on their gens, because one is hooked and one is being chased. there are only two survivors left and they have to unhook someone, which often results in them both not sitting on gens
---

---
Laughed so fucking hard at this 😂
---
I mean, it'd be easier than average, but the killer wouldn't be at a disadvantage, so it's irrelevant.
---
And then you run Ruin and you get me, the survivor that always runs small game.
---
its always the SWF that want Mori's removed
---
normal BHVR at work
---
It's a picture we can't really see much to be honest. Vacuum somewhat still exist for windows and sometimes survivors vault after getting downed.
---
This can be used to describe to a lot of other team based games as well.
---
First super cringe of the day.
---
Though, if there's only one survivor left and it's not a Claudette, you're able to see the hatch but cannot close it. Be a good sports and show it to the surv.

WHY DO YOU WAIT FOR AGES FOR A KILLER TO JOIN YOUR LOBBY BUT WHEN PLAYING KILLER YOU'RE WAITING EVEN LONGER FOR A LOBBY TO JOIN ... WHAT KINDA LOGIC IS THIS?!

Doctor.."if you think that's bad wait to you get my bill". . -Doctor Giggles..
---
yea, though I'm not sure how that could've worked out. Since people would just, and I hate this term but, genrush the event gens and die probably. I know they made old event hooks unsabo'able to stop griefing, but you can't really do that equivalent for gens as you are literally just making it impossible for killer to patrol 1-6 gens on the map. With how prevalent gen regression perks are currently, I can imagine a killer can do the exact same and just constantly patrol said event gens and bar survivors from doing them.
---
The problem with this system is that 1 hook =/= 1 gen yet they are treated equally when it comes to these event points, and the one time BHVR tried to do something different with the pustula petals, it turned most matches into jokes where everyone kills themselves within 2 minutes of the game starting.

Iirc rift itself closes in like 60 days. The event itself I believe is separate from the rift, they were just released/started at the same time.
---
That’s not what I said
---
Its so buggy and quite unbalanced rn, but my hod is it amazing, i just wish i didnt have a FUCKING BRICKED XBOX POWER CORD EIGHT BEFORE THE RIFT CAME OUT
---
The entire post is him playing the objective and you said it’s toxic...
---
Or another fav from Dr G. "Is their a doctor in the house?"
---
I clarified which part
---
I switched to corrupt intervention and I found it does the job well enough. Of course, I’m not playing weaker killers like Pig. I’m playing Freddy, Ghostface, etc.
---
Imagine thinking looping is toxic
---
Because it is
---
Cry baby survivor. Almost every killer needs a buff. Not a nerf. This game should be harder for survivors. Not killers. And now that one killer is actually GOOD, all the survivor mains are crying about it. Get good.
---
Yep, played 3 games so far. Died on 1st hook just now (killer not camping), died in struggle game before, and had a streamer DC in the first game. has me wondering if people were given instructions NOT to save others.
---
You clearly didn't hence the comment. Also 600+ upvotes says otherwise therefore if you don't like it scroll past and stop telling people what to do you're not a mod.
---
And freddy
---
Eustace as a killer when BHVR
---
Agreed! And if they want my attention, they are probably better than me and the meme build I’m doing on my baby trapper anyways!
---
I agree that you need to change your play style but playing against a Spirit feels like a coin flip (I'm a Doc/Spirit main) and its dumb that there's no way to know what's happening. On ANY killer you will have feedback to what's happening. Wraith got his bing bong, Michael got his breathing/tier up sound, Billy/LF got chainsaw sounds, Nurse can only go in a straight line and you know when she's stunned and can even see her fist charging her power, Demo got his head opening, Doc's power got a field on the ground and you know when you're near him to get his madness to charge, Pig's got her sound... Only Spirit doesn't have a way to know when she's using her power. I'm usually one to say that yes, survivors are annoying as hell with their "NERF THIS NERF THAT" and I'd rather see buffs to weaker killers than nerfs to good killers but survivors have no way to know what's happening against her.
---
Yeah, I don't think it should be that way. That's taking away a LOT of time from doing gens. Just to avoid 1 perk, that they might not even have. At least half the time when I've ran it, I either didn't need it or it got cleansed within 10 seconds of me having it. That's why I don't run it. almost the same thing with ruin. It's really just a big gamble, with most of the time it not being in your favor.
---
Holy shit still stealing from BR I see...first the Pass and now the camouflage bush trick...lol this is awesome tho.
---
Odd numbers can’t be fully divided-father pucci
---
😂😂😂 I mean, that's fair. First to get what you're doing and doesn't run lol
---
Of all the horrible wrong things for both sides in this game right now? This button is the worst thing about it's current state? Go off I guess. Lol.
---
Yes, I've seen at least one person who unhooked, but I get the feeling it's definitely not a 50/50 split across survivors.
---
“It’s just been revoked...”
---
Why didn't you search "tome level 2" before making this post?
---
You fool you triggered my trap card
---
Open the news tab scroll through patch notes shows the release dates for all three
---
No fun allowed.
---
I suppose that's true, it is unlikely they'll just outright remove them, I suppose the proposed change to them is a decent alternative.
---
Sleep is for the weak
---
The Spirit. I was just amazed at how horrifying her design was. To be murdered by your own father, to feel hateful so intense that it keeps you going through death: That's chilling to me. I noticed her limbs are totally severed, and floating in place: Everything on her is there for a reason, including the glass shards from the window she jumped out of in an attempt to save herself. She's just horrifying to look at, and the way she animated, with her emotions flitting from one extreme feeling to another is very creepy. She's not Rin anymore, she's just this shattered soul devoted to hatred. FREAKY
---
Contrast that with someone like the Wraith, who is just terrible design. He's a modern Nigerian immigrant, but his addons imply he was a bushman living with a tribe. His lore, despite saying he was so infuriated that he was unknowingly murdering people that he went insane, sits in stark contrast with his role as Killer. He has random bandages on his legs, and has this ridiculous scarecrow or tree (of all things) theme going on with his cosmetics. It makes no sense. Oh, and his power: Wtf, what about him screams "invisible"? What is this wailing bell? just, why?? Terrible.
---
I love the Trapper’s design. He was taken during an explosion that caused a mine collapse, hence why he’s covered in burns and ash. Best killer lore wise, in my opinion, would have to be the Clown. His lore is so thorough and specific, and it really paints a picture on who he is and, most importantly, how he got so thicc.
---
I mean you do realize he just colored a picture that guy made
---
Looping is not toxic. It's the core mechanic of almost each and every chase you will encounter in a proper game of dead by daylight.  Stop being a special snowflake and accept it's part of the game, get good at mindgames and learn how to play against it.
---
Or you can just keep projecting your skewed view onto other players, it's the easy way out
---
And no, I do not only play survivor
---
Doesn’t at all pertain to this post
---
This.
---
&lt;3 thank you
---
**Meme:** \**Makes fun of both sides\**
---
**DeadByDaylight Subreddit:** 
---
Wait. That´s illegal
---
This is making me feel some kind of way, and I don't like it, sir. Mom plz come pick me up I'm scared
---
Have you ever played red ranks? I’m serious maybe if u guys didn’t cling to generators like they’re keeping you alive irl, killers wouldn’t be compelled to run perks like NoED
---
If you were paying attention you would see that he is in dieing state
---
Yes right after you camped the pallet
---
Ive been playing a lot of Huntress without add ons lately.  I feel like there used to be an invisible crosshair that I’m able to see now.  Been hitting some crazy shots in chase.  Maybe try running the Babushka and Oak Haft so you can get off shots quicker (work on aim quicker).  That’s what I did and without them I’m 100% better now.  Not consistent enough to 4K, but a huge improvement,  
---
Nurse I dunno,  she was hard enough on console.  I’m trying to get a silent timer in my head to better gauge blink distance.  Definitely doesn’t help how slow camera movement is even at 100%
---
The favorite thing to do to those Survivors who just camp on top of pallets and throw it down the nanosecond you get close it to walk around the short end of the loop a little, break line of sight, then double back while moon walking and swinging.
---
Hits them every time, and they never learn either, it's adorable.
---
Absolutely not... If I queue with friends I usually wait 2-5mins - alone like 30 seconds or so
---
I don’t know, but I think we both know what you have to do...
---
"tbagging isn't toxic tho"
---
There's pallet camping now??
---
5-10 minutes here in red ranks.
---
They need a nerf. Dealing with bullshit less often is still dealing with bullshit. Why not just make it so theyre not bullshit at all?
---
Ive been playing STBFL for months, the stacks do work
---
kinda feel like there’s a certain immersion to be had with silent killers. I kinda prefer it that way, but your ideas are far from bad.
---
&gt; but whenever he tries to predict what a survivor does 90% is he wrong lol.
---
nah he's typically pretty spot on
---
Look up "Doctor Death"
---
This is why killers can’t have fun why we can’t have nice things and what causes killers to become toxic ITS THEIR FAULT
---
*ahem*.
---
All around me are fa-**MILIAR FACES**
---
he is in, like, the top 3 of having the best reads in the game. no clue what that one guy is on about lol must have lost to Otz or something
---
🤤
---
I am so fuck3d.....
---
I think I used steamid.io to find mine.
---
Someone else put GF's stealth strat here so I'll just add what I know. Don't use Stalk much you know that. Use Thanataphobia, Nurses calling, sloppy butcher, and either an information perk like discordance, thrilling tremors, or BBQ. or a slowdown perk like Ruin or Corrupt intervention. 
---
Get them injured, keep them injured. Use nurses and sloppy butcher to punish healing and capitalize on the slowdown of Thanataphobia in the mean time. 
---
Use your night shroud as often as possible to keep them guessing where you are. Mid Chase it works great because they don't know where you are thanks to no red glow or Terror radius, and if they look behind them to reveal you they can't see where they're going thus running into walls and trees. 
---
Keeping them guessing as to where you are on the map is a GF strength. So if you are having trouble in a Chase, just cloak and find another target. Catching someone out of position rather than in a strong loop is typically a good option. 
---
Use your reveal mechanic to locate hiding survivors. When they look at you it'll point in the direction they're looking at you from. Use it to hunt. So when an immersed Survivor sneaks a glimpse, GF suddenly turns in their direction and hopefully jump. Even better if they have spine chill for that one.
---
Be spooky, be stealthy, be stabby.
---
My favorite one is when you know you have a survivor who likes to double back a lot so instead of looping you look hide your stain with your power or by looking at a wall and wait for them to panic run back into you.
---
are u in low ranks? in the higher ranks people are more altruistic
---
Agreed. I think the smartest survivors are the ones who spread their generator work out before they start to pop gens. Force the killer to run around trying to regress them and sneak into the more heavily defended area in the meantime and push some progress on those difficult to reach generators while someone else is getting chased nearby. Yeah you might get forced off your gen a couple times but as long as you're working together to prevent a 3gen situation, it's very easy to do and gets everyone involved in the game, including the killer. I ain't even mad when I lose to strategies like this because it means they actually worked together to distract me, rescue each other and work on those precious gens instead of just genrushing only the furthest gens from me and urban immersion-ing into a corner the moment they hear a heartbeat.
---
As someone who uses moris on one day a month for fun, I think that ebony moris should be removed, ivory should be ultra rare, and the ability to mori instead of a3rd hook should be base. That way you still get to see the animations but it’s not unfair
---
If the rarity were to be increased, the addons wouldn't be rare anymore. (Rare implies scarcity- ultra rare implies ultra scarcity)
---
So you propose to remove red (ultra rare) entirely?
---
Add ons or no add ons? :)
---
Thank you. I was sure there was someone else.
---
Thank you
---
Clown with thrilling tremors and surge is MONEY.  It’s like free pop without having to go to the gen.  
---
You’re welcome :)
---
That's the truth, haunted grounds isn't as bad as people make it out to be. As an experienced killer, haunted grounds really doesn't help all that much. If they made it where the other totem would stay if one gets cleansed, then i could see it being a threat. But right now, it's not really that effective.
---
You are the killer. You job is to win the game, no honor code, no made up rules. No survivor rules for killers. Win however you can, just don't be dick to people.
---
It's barely noticeable 
---
&gt; I’ve been playing since 2016 never had I felt so negatively about it
---
my eyes rolled so hard my head popped off
---
you're absolutely right. it's terrifying to even think about this.
---
Had someone sabo my event hooks. I saboed her life.
---
Might want to find a new swf
---
I'm in the same boat and i'm still getting familiar with loops. If you need it, Sprint Burst is a good perk that has helped me get a bit of a headstart so I can have a couple seconds more to plan my route. I've made a few escapes just doing this.
---
There's an altruism experiment going on in a test server, where everyone who was invited was given a specific role - rescuer or non-rescuer. I'm asking specifically in the context of the the roles people were assigned.
---
Part of the experiment is letting others play and not yourself :)
---
I agree. Finally saw someone get unhooked, so they are definitely around, but it's gotta be somethink like 10-15% or something
---
made with mematic
---
I see /s is a foreign concept to you.
---
there are only 1,000 participants. you're not going to be able to notice a damn thing about the altruism experiment.
---
That’s kinda creepy ngl
---
Just means the matchmaking system is doing its job right! /s
---
Also there’s no reason to insult someone. Jerk.
---
I propose to make ultra rare add-ons rarer than they are now
---
Scared a baby Dwight hard with Ghost face, poor fella worked on a gen as I hid perfectly in grass then sneaked up and stabbed him after stalking him
---
Crouching away? Why not just walking? Typical fearful, braindead Urban gamer confirmed
---
Lol no
---
I did not!
---
If you didn’t already know this, this is how she runs when phasing (check YouTube)
---
Because you are refusing to learn the game properly? Sure, whatever lets you sleep at night
---
I have an explanation. You see, there are, what seem like, bronze caps on his fingers that run together when he moves his fingers a certain way. That sound is the sound of those caps being rubbed together.
---
Yes i'm a big fan of sprint burst myself!
---
c4-turtleman ps4
---
On the contrary, 1000 players is a small enough size that if you are consistently having games with apparently no survivor rescusing other, you'll notice that. The more people that are in the test, the easier a random 4-man team could end up having a rescuer randomly assigned to them.
---
I dont agree at all. A lot of the pink addons pretty much serve to make the game so much more fun. So you want to keep the broken bullshit, while making the fun stuff, most of which is pretty well balanced, super hard to come by? Thats absurd.
---
Imagine commenting on a low effort meme :D
---
I wouldn't do it
---
a friend bought it for me a few weeks back because my friends were all going to play it as a group and i didn't have it or have enough for it at the time. i think since then i've put more hours into dbd than the rest of them combined. it doesn't help that ruin and bbq popped up back to back so i no longer had an excuse for poor killer rank performance
---
This has been done and thought of before as well. Require a cell number to make an account.
---
no, but it is faster finding a lobby with 4 people ready than finding 4 people to be in 1 lobby
---
The yellow feather cooldown addon is an addiction for me. It's highly underrated. Being able to throw a bottle and hit someone or break a pallet immediately after is great. My second addon rotates among Flask of Bleach, Ether, and reload speed. Bleach is another addiction of mine, I'd marry that addon if I could. 
---
My build is Pop, STBFL, Thrilling Tremors, and one flex slot. I like Brutal on him so you can gas the survivor and break the pallet really fast before they can run far. Save The Best For Last is necessary fornme. Getting a direct hit with the bottle to blur their vision more and using the cooldown addon to smack 'em immediately can cause survivors to run into walls and waste their speed. STBFL lets you get really fast downs when that happens.
---
Thrilling Tremors is just one of the best perks in the game. It locks gens off so you can PGTW them, and also gives you info as to where survivors are. You can't afford to waste time as Clown due to his low map pressure.
---
You can also get a good bit of regression by kicking a gen and throwing a bottle on it when you're a decent bit away. Survivors will avoid the gas so the gen gets about 8-10% taken off if you're lucky.
---
Yah you totally nailed this meme more than me!
---
fuck i feel like an idiot now
---
all they need is addon tweaks, which they are in line for.
---
I swear to god I need to stop attempting memes when I'm sleepy
---
if it's thrill of the hunt, you would probably know from cleansing the first one or touching literally any totem once
---
Uh, no, you are completely wrong. They are too diluted in the overall player base, especially since it's going to span ranks
---
I think you don't understand the meaning of "ruining a game". If they get 4 gens done, this means these were your mistakes that lead to it. And if you can't win with this window, just play Trapper, Spirit, Nurse or Hag, they can easily defeat it. And if you don't feel like playing them, take the perk "Bamboozle. And, DC'ing is the worst thing you can do in this game. You're literally destroying the fun of everyone else, just because you " don't like the window".
---
I'd rather not deal with bullshit at all. How about we work toward making addons and items that are fun for both sides?
---
Except good red rank killers almost never run NOED
---
Apparently it got released on Halloween this year. Never knew honestly
---
That’s might have been the truth a while ago but it’s a different truth now
---
That's why you ramp up over time as the pattern develops. It 100% is the solution. Small penalties at first, but if the pattern continues, bigger penalties.
---
The only people alienated are going to be the assholes. A bunch of other games already have solutions, especially the MOBA genre.
---
I mean there’s plenty of survivor v killer threads lol, this  just ain’t one of them .
---
Oh true i forgot it just tells you (for some reason)
---
You don't have experience, that's all. If you really think that's an arbitrary reason, then God help you lmao.
---
Pig main approves of this boop.
---
People didn’t kill themselves for Gens during the BBQ event, and gen rushing isn’t an issue because that’s literally the survivors objective in the game.
---
I downed a survivor yesterday who was going hard like this. I hooked him and baby sat that hook until he died. 
---
I get a message saying how trash I am 😂😂 and how I dont know how to play. Even though I took out all 4 survivors. (Except him because he left the match right before he got sacrificed). 
---
Another person who thinks doing the objectives is toxic.
---
Freddy look out, the killer spawned behind you.
---
I play Ghostface a lot and I only teabag when a Survivor is waiting at the exit gate for me or if they're teabagging first. And if I'm frank, Ghostfsce is the kind of character canonically to do this kind of shit.
---
You accidentally said that twice btw
---
It tells you because of the hex clearing slowdown, if you had *incredible* observational skills you'd know within seconds so in a way it's not telling you anything you don't already know?
---
I was having this issue and just had to set up my Xbox closer to router and run an Ethernet cable to it. I wasn't getting any lag or bad ping at all once I was using wired connection.
---
That's how you get banned and no one cares Pepega
---
To be completely honest, I’m not really a big fan of Hoffman or Dr. Gordon, so it’s a no from me, Chief. (Besides, as someone else has already mentioned, the lore explicitly states that Pig is Amanda, and nobody else.)
---
same here, I used to really like him when he first came out. Time to dust off the old tonic bottles.
---
Looks like a fig
---
A coin flip is 50/50 though. That would make her the most balanced killer.
---
You could try surge instead of pop.  Gives you pop without having to waste time heading to a gen
---
Only possible way for that to be true is if playing killer had gotten harder, which is not the case. Survivors have had so many nerfs that playing killer is now easier. So, no, good killers at red ranks should now less frequently be needing NOED. Either way, if you need free downs because you failed to protect the gens, you're a bad killer and absolutely cannot say you deserve to be red ranked.
---
This guy had 4,000 hours, it would disappoint me if he was pulling a sneaky on this one
---
Fortunately for me I don't have much social interactions outside work anyway.
---
You can't complete get rid of unfair things in assymetric pvp game. You can't make pvp game fun for everyone, as one's person fun always costs fun of the other
---
I feel like if they had different types of trap totems, like if there was one that regressed all unoccupied gens by 50% of their completion (So a gen 50% done would now be 25% done) then theyd be more interesting since you don't know if it'll direcrly or indirectly hurt you.
---
this is top tier, 10/10
---
imagine being proud of being a 4stack omegalol
---
Exactly. This is the first thing I teach new players as survivor. Don't three gen yourself.
---
If you popped two or 3 gens and Boone has even been hit yet... Something is wrong. And you are talking for a trap
---
You seem to be assuming heavily that friend has no sense of humor and couldn't possible be presenting the information in a trite and joking manner.
---
"Hey man how you doing"
---
"Oh just fine, ghostface is just taking a pic with me"
---
No because we would have meta survivors and the less optimal ones. People should be able to pick who they want without feeling like they do something wrong
---
It’s the facts
---
Tfw dies on first hook because blendettes were urban immersioning around the map
---
Are ruin and bbq chili pretty much mandatory?
---
I've said it too. If there's no slowdown perks/addons or they spawn on ruin gens can be done in less than 4 minutes.
---
The only way the math changes is if the killer hooks somebody and finds another target before those first 3 gens are all done at once. The only way that happens is if the killer is sweating buckets with a meta build and/or if the first survivor found is a total potato.
---
I don't blame survivors at all, but keep in mind how frustrated survivors also get when chase times are ~45 seconds or less and/or they are matched with potato teammates. As the survivor it feels really shitty and unfair and OP, but for killer the time margins are razor thin and against good survivors you can't be fucking around with goofy Wraith builds chasing people for over a minute per down.
---
When I want to snack I hold the controller in my left hand pushing it into my lap so my leg is holding down r1 for me so my finger is ready to press l1 when a skill check pops up and my right hand is free to shovel food into my mouth
---
Maybe exaggerated but hey I took time out my day to write it so maybe it genuine. I just be lurking I’ve never give my input on anything on Reddit before. 
---
Negatively about the ui. the game has given me 3 years of enjoyment. just feel like the game should navigate more smoothly
---
*Whole*
---
Okay, bear in mind I'm not trying to be argumentative, but simply trying to understand the math.
---
In the experiment, you've either been told to ignore other survivors altogether, or else screw everything else to rescue people. That means that, once someone is on the hook, it should become obvious quickly whether there is at least one person in the game who is a rescuer.
---
I understand that there are a lot of people, and only 4 can get assigned to a game at any one time. With 1000, and everyone needing 'win' 15 games accomplishing goal, people will be playing far more than the ideal 15 perfect games. Which means that we can count out people 'leaving' quickly because they have accomplished their goal, for the most part.
---
If that's the case, it should become noticable across multiple games whether survivors are being rescued at roughly what percent. The game does not notate within itself who is assigned to what role, so it will draft 4 random players. If more games than not are ending with not one survivor being rescued, and multiple people are confirming a similar experience (what I am asking here), then shouldnt we be able to at least assume that the rescuers/selfishness ratios may not be 50/50?
---
I swear that sandwich kills people the most who get hooked.
---
A coin flip doesn't mean something is fine and balanced though since a coin flip is about luck and luck in this game is kinda shit..
---
Unfortunately that's how the rank system works right now. I believe that you can afford only one escape/DC and still pip, two and black pip but you are completely screwed with 3 or 4.
---
Thank you didn't even know
---
It's an exaggeration to call Ruin mandatory, but it's nearly mandatory for most killers. I would say it's 100% mandatory that your killer+addon+perk combo have some plan to slow down the game.
---
BBQ is far from mandatory, but it's a very good perk on killers with good map traversal and for BP farming.
---
It really is and thats without tool boxes. Theres too much stress on killers
---
What? This is a total non-sequitur and you know that
---
Spirit: *Teleports Behind You* "Nothing Personal, Kid.
---
Why does fun have to be zero sum?
---
If it takes you 80 seconds to end a chase you are an incompetent killer and deserve to lose. 
---
If you’re hitting bloodlust II in a chase it’s time to abandon and chase someone else. 
---
Don’t chase really good survivors. It’s a waste of time and definitely will lose you the game. As a killer one bad chase will cost you everyone escaping
---
I've noticed the higher ranks are less likely? But I do see it all the time.
---
dark souls has helped me escape my obsession by giving me a new one... I'll be back eventually
---
Gen speeds are insane. If you don't have insane map pressure 3 gens are done by the time you get the first hook
---
THATS IT, IM GETTING MY NO STALK GHOSTFACE
---
Another person who doesn't understand the concept of graduated punishments.
---
It's not Just you. I feel your pain.
---
Yeah my friends like that, except he probably had a few hundred so I either ignore him or when I'm being chased (after calling it out) and he starts shouting or panicking I'm like "I don't think so" or "STOP RUNNING SPINE CHILL WHEN YOUR NOT SOLO"
---
Credits goes for u/TigerKirby215 for the comment!
---
As someone who plag Mirror Myers alot, it's a meme build on outdoor maps. At tier 1 he moves just 5% faster than survivors and cant gain bloodlust so he is so easy to loop.
---
Vanity mirror slows him down by 9%
---
They are fun builds, but horribly univable unless survivors are morons
---
I have it on both xbox and switch, the graphics are a little lower quality but the game play from my experience is roughly the same. Ques as survivors dont take long at all, though killer I've waited as long as 25 min. As a killer main I'm mainly playing survivor just to try to git gud lol.
---
Gonna be honest, “if it glows it goes”. 
---
Not the safest mantra, and it tends to fuck me over, but I stand by it
---
Pretty much same, I've only played survivor once after around 15 hours of killer, played Bill, went against the laggiest pre-rework freddy where I couldn't even get taken off hook before I was being put back on. Haven't played survivor since.
---
Yup. The other survivors can't possibly do gens or spread out while you chase one. Apply pressure is a meme.
---
Well said!
---
And in case you missed it, they just sent out an email clarifying that the reward isn't based on escaping 15 times, just playing thankfully!
---
I want to upvote but I can't, you have 69
---
Agreed, Remake Freddy isn't scary. I just wanna kick his ass

**It was all calculated from the beginning**

Why is this picture so blurry?

&gt;BHVR wonders why low-rank Killers face camp  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;BHVR wonders why low-rank Killers run NOED
---
Yeah lets talk about this a moment. Consider for a moment that in the game's current form, the new player experience. For a few games, lets say a dozen or so, our Rank 20 Killer is going to play against the most potato of potato players. They're gonna get a couple 4Ks and level up a few times, gain a few ranks, and generally think they've got a good grasp on the game despite the fact they're camping, not kicking gens, and generally also playing like a potato. At very low tier play, the killer has all the power, because survivors are totally lost trying to find gens and failing skill checks.
---
This newly minted Rank 16 killer, emboldened by his "success" now comes up against a poorly matched SFW group containing a rank 15, a two rank 8s all on comms. These rank 8s have been watching streams, youtube content, and playing for some time, they've got all the best meta perks and are rolling toolboxes into the game. Our Killer is placed into this match in Rotten Fields and gets easily lost in the corn. Meanwhile our intrepid SFW have already found 3 generators to start working on. The killer spots the 4th and begins a chase, spending a good 50 seconds running around chasing them, eventually downing them in the corner of the map. He hauls his prey to the hook and realizes in the time it took to do all that, 2 generators have popped and a third one pops shortly after. He rushes to try and catch whoever was working on that third gen and finds one of our experienced rank 8 players, meanwhile over comms they've informed their friends to go for the save all while looping this poor underperked killer into oblivion. 2 more gens get done, the exit gates power, and our Killer finally downs the rank 8 after having to Bloodlust 3 twice.
---
He takes his prey to the nearest hook and face camps as the endgame collapse begins, because he wants to at least get that ONE kill. The others come back and swarm the hook, making use of borrowed time and dead hards to save their friend and everyone makes it out of the gate. Post game they mock our killer for camping and call him shit. This killer now most likely will do 1 of 2 things: quit, or become a toxic killer who camps every single hook because he doesn't want that to happen again, because fuck it, the gens are getting done way too fast for him to do anything about it anyway. Might as well secure that one kill.
---
I approve this message!
---
I completely agree with you. Obviously some people’s ranks are inflated or lower than they should be based on their skill, but for the most part your rank is a good indication of how you’ll play. 
---
Lately I’ve only been playing against optimal SWF. If I’m not a top tier killer I’ll be lucky to get 1K, but I’m assuming that’s mostly to do with the event
---
I had someone dc on me and message me because I  was chasing an injured person with t3 myres and saw them fully healed and swapped target and hit them. Apparantly swapping target isnt allowed
---
&gt; If more games than not are ending with not one survivor being rescued, and multiple people are confirming a similar experience (what I am asking here), then shouldnt we be able to at least assume that the rescuers/selfishness ratios may not be 50/50?
---
No, because there are a multitude of biases at play. For instance, knowing that there is an altruism experiment and what its participants are doing will make you more likely to notice things you haven't noticed before, but now that you're noticing them more *because you are primed to*, you're attributing them to the thing making you notice typical gameplay which you now think is atypical gameplay

&gt;Theres a few more.

I honestly don't think BHVR is daft enough to wonder why people are running things like NOED or Ruin. The major issue is that they balance more geared towards lower rank play (which makes sense, the majority of players are probably not rank 1, they're probably around rank 15-ish if I had to wager) which leads to kind of a delicate balancing act.
---
Currently at high ranks, yes, Generators fly by wayyyy too quickly. But at rank 18, I'm sure that Survivors would tell you that Generators take way too long and that Skill Checks can be hard to hit sometimes, and they feel really punished for missing them. I have friends that are at these ranks, because they're new and have &lt;40 hours in the game. They say Survivor is really hard, and they feel like they die way too fast and just can't beat Killers.
---
If they just flat increased the amount of time Generators took, low ranks would probably complain and possibly quit the game. This would lose BHVR a lot more players than if they kept things the way they are.
---
There isn't a magic bullet cure for the balancing of the game right now. I hope beyond hope that BHVR is cooking up some way to make the game feel less miserable, but I don't envy the people in charge of that project. There isn't any winning for them, tons of people are going to complain no matter what they end up doing.

Got called a hacker twice today for playing jumpscare meyers.
---
I don't know, it wasn't blurry before the upload
---
see my reply to them for why that's nonsense
---
also, some players were assigned killer role so the number in survivor games is even smaller
---
Demogorgon needs to behead
---
Honestly noed is a crutch perk it's not even fun to play against or for.
---
relatable
---
didn't know, thanks
---
But that is the thing, it is really stupid that a killer should be dropping chases because he cannot afford to chase a survivor around god loops. This is a 1v4 game, how is is possible for 1 survivor to have so much strenght in a game where they are 4 on one killer?  
---
Sure you can abandon the chase, then come to the gen and disrupt those guys busy on it, but you will again only start chasing another one and you can either stay on that gen and try to deter the survivors from coming back to it, but they can just keep you occupied there while one of them goes to a different gen. Bonus points if they are SWF and know exactly where you are every time to coordinate better.
---
The first few gens can fly by incredibly fast, and often you can only recover in the late game when gens are closer and you can actually manage to defend them.
---
the only outfits that have putrid serum cosmetics are dwight, claudette and jake. whereas, there's cosmetics for like half the killers
---
I would agree with you about the bias, except that, in this case, there are roles that people have to play for the experiment to be valid, assigned by the people moderating this event. Which means that people are acting atypically as part of this experiment, and we can notice that atypical behavoir. In this case, someone coming to a survivors rescue seems to be the atypical action. So yes, biases do probably exist, but I'd argue that routinely noticing no one gets rescued is not a bias
---
So if my understanding is correct, with putrid serums you can buy the hallowed blight event skins for characters, 30 serums for a set, 10 for an individual piece. You buy it in the same place as you would for anything else but this time you have the option to spend serums instead.

You call me toxic yet there you are talking about tbagging at pallets to piss people off. Look in a mirror bud.
---
The two dumbest I have gotten was someone telling me the Severed Toe add-on for Plague is OP and one telling me I was moried for doing a gen in their terror radius as they chased someone.
---
The only advantage for PC I can see is Huntress as she is the only "true" ranged killer. Plague has to have survs cleanse for damage, and clown only slows.
---
Please explain how it's toxic? It's the one part of chase that requires practically any skill to execute. I'm genuinely curious, if a survivor is in a safe (ish) spot, why should they leave it?
---
Behavior'd
---
Gitgud right?
---
Haha good one :D
---
Thrilling Tremors doesn't block gens being worked on. I found this out the hard way when running Thrilling + Pop.
---
All ranks in a nutshell. Ftfy
---
I've followed dbd for a while now, but wasn't able to play it. I now have like 50+ hours on it and Myers still gets me. The Hag traps still scare the living hell out of me
---
*It's raining Feng! Hallelujah!*
---
*It's raining Feng! Amen!*
---
You saying that literally proves my point.
---
You bring up some good points. There are some loops in the game that survivors will always hang around and if I see them start running over to them I’ll immediately abandon chase and find someone else. It’s obviously super shitty but I’m not going to throw the game to try and catch someone at an infinite
---
Yup you are just a piece of shit
---
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of chases, a chase isn’t about whether or not a survivor can “get away” it’s just about how long you can last the killer before getting downed so that you give your other team mates time to do objectives. The only reason you’ll ever “get away” is if the killer got *really* confused and somehow lost your scratch marks or if he recognizes that you’re playing a really good loop/tile and will *choose* to leave you.
---
Looks par for the course... You waited one millisecond too long so that's on you for being hit tbh.
---
Im all in for alternate win conditions, thats one thing i loved about friday the 13th
---
It doubles to give you info on where people are on gens and also can block off a gen that would otherwise finish if someone found it before you returned.
---
You obviously aren't doing the experiment. You can easily tell when you're in a group where everyone else was assigned to not make any saves or heals.
---
Lmao
---
In that case opting in should definitely be the default.  There's some nice QoL in playing with people who use different hardware, but the big benefit would be queue times.
---
It’s scary. You are omniscient, all knowing, and fear inducing. You want all the ketamine.
---
Maybe your experiences are different, but I found that I could never get to the gen in time to hit it.
---
Lol hahaha
---
At least the description says it does. And I'm pretty sure Stridor does increase the breathing volume, so it would  be weird for Iron Will to not decrease it
---
And ooo, just can't see their Aura. The perk lights up though. And they can see you.
---
Then ebony shouldn't be U/R
---
&gt; You can easily tell when you're in a group where everyone else was assigned to not make any saves or heals.
---
This is exactly how I know you and OP have no fucking idea what you are talking about.
---
The game needs more objectives. Something worth doing over gens. You cannot really nerf gen speed much because then you can easily fuck lower ranks and it makes stuff like Ruin or endgame gen hate like Dying Light be really strong once you only have a few gens left on the map.
---
So give us more perks like Inner Strength that need Totems being done, give us more perks like NOED that incentivise clearing dull totems, improve Chests and make them actually worth searching for, maybe add some more objectives to do during the game so that survivors aren´t incentivised to just ignore everything and rush gens.
---
You just changed my whole mindset. Whoa. Makes a lot of sense. I'm gonna keep that in mind from now on
---
A key thing here is gens take 80 seconds with no toolkit and good skill checks, not greats. It's even worse that what's painted by this.
---
Yes, this why i stopped playing this games, the queue time is ridiculous.
---
But I'm obsessed with dbd and fnaf at the same time 🤔
---
Dw bout it, I was very surprised to hear how minimal his add-on effects were... Disappointing to say the least.
---
They need more than add on tweaks, base kit buffs is what they need.
---
Holy shit why am I laughing so much
---
For me it's Myers. I swear every game that I end up against one, they tape themselves to the hook as soon as they get that first down. By no means do I hate Myers mains, but I seem to have incredibly bad luck with the types I go up against.
---
Listen bhvr isnt exactly the smartest dev team on this side if the planet.
---
That’s exactly it. I took some time off and came back at noob ranks. Hated the game, had no fun. Had to play swf just to enjoy it, even then it was mostly 2 man swf and we still got lemons on our team either Dwights being pulled out of lockers every minute or Claudettes hiding in bushes at the edge of the map.
---
Got to red ranks again and now I can even play solo and still enjoy myself.
---
At least with the old hatch there was a reason to play on. Your team might be useless but you could always take the hatch. Now as you say, killer closes it and NOED.
---
I cba with the grind though. Its tiring NEEDING to boost to red ranks just to have fun. Not surprised most players are swf now.
---
Less camping and tunneling at high rank too. At green ranks every game is just a killer proxy camping to tunnel the guy off the hook.
---
It's situational, but it has definitely saved gens for me. I have a lot of times where a gen was close to finished with two people there. I downed one while the other ran, and Tremors locked the gen long enough for me to get back and Pop it. The other survivors are usually even waiting at the gen so you can get a free hit too if you're lucky.
---
Wow. My bad.
---
Fair enough.
---
I feel personally attacked by this content and I dislike it wholeheartedly.
---
He is clearly behind sarcastic. A quick search through his comment history proves that.
---
Sometimes i wont let them get hatch and catch the last one to display dominance, but then letting them escape through the gate.
---
Because during the time I have to break it they can run and hide
---
I can't be a fucking killer main anymore because I can't wait even play the game as one. I don't really like playing survivor but end up doing it anyways just so I can fucking play, even survivor use to be like instant and now it takes 30 seconds - a minute which isn't alot but it's definitely more than before
---
You'd rather a rank 20 killer gets paired up with a SWF?
---

"5 GENS IN 5 MINUTES! KILLERS CRYING 😂😂😂"
---
They were going to straight tell you that Freddy was a pedo in the original, ad the director wanted, but due to the events that happened right before the movie, they had to only hint at it.
---
it's not always the optimal play to do that, though?
---
😱That looks exactly like my cat!!
---
Right back at you. :)
---
Anyway, back to playing in the experiment!
---
A good killer will hit you every time you try that dumb 360 stuff. I don’t believe you are 360 red rank killers that are actually good. I’m calling bs
---
I have 71 it's ok now
---
I don't think it's any more luck based than trying to predict what any killer is doing when they hide their red stain. You often guess in those situations too, and sometimes you guess wrong.  
---
    
---
You know where the Spirit will be going when she phases, you don't actually have to guess. She will follow sound/scratches or pre-emptively go to the nearest window/pallet. It's not a mystery.
---
The first time I played Old Freddy, my only perk was Overcharge.
---
&gt; "tryhard"
---
at tier 3 he should attack furriosly with slipper, and mori would be just him hitting in rage with slipper until survivor stops moving
---
Honestly it might just be that I never get BBQ on my bloodweb but I've adapted quite well to not having it. I'm far more used to using Whispers for reliable tracking, and find that now there are so many counters to BBQ (hiding behind gens, hiding in lockers, or the occasional goof who has Distortion) that it hardly ever reveals people.
---
That being said I still hard run it on most of the Killers I have it on just for the Bloodpoints, even on Killers I personally think it's very weak on. In particular I think Trapper has too much set-up time to make use of BBQ (you're gonna put traps around the hook) but I still run it on him just for the BP.
---
Thank you, you are a good man

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
Yes, and it showed up in r/all.... I had to keep scrolling through until this far down to find out what "mori" meant.
---
It used to be the average rank now for some reason its the highest rank. Say theres a rank 20 in youre swf and youre a rank 9 youre gonna go against a rank 9-4 killer intead if like a rank 13
---
Killer messaged because I sabotaged a hook before he could use it which gave the David more time to wiggle free. 🤭
---
Does not matter, she brought them apples.
---
i don t see how survivors go down fast, when you still have to use m1. There is a reason why legion is one of worst killers in game, because his power dosen t help in Chase, same as plague. You are a m1 killer. And If survivors go down fast, then you are playing against rank 20 survivors who can t loop m1 killer for more then 1 minute. Srsly If People don t cleanse against plague, it means that survivors have heavy potential to gen rush. And If survivors know how to loop m1 killer you will get 1 kill or at best 2 kills before they all escape. A lot of People say plague is underrated, when in reality she is not underrated, she is a Boring m1 killer with no power. If People don t cleanse, you don t have power and you turn yourself into legion who has easier time tracking People because of sickness, and at same time survivors can spot plague a mile away because how tall she is. So yea plague against survivors who know how to loop a killer turns plague in usseles killer. If you want to play m1 killer who can one shot survivors just play Myers, at least he has anti loop built in his kit, and is stronger then plague.
---
It's not really 50 50 it's very heavily sided to the killer and if survivors wanted to go play a chance game they'd play Mario party and just roll a dice cause that's what spirit feels like with nurse you can outplay and juke or with Billy you can locker juke chainsaws and play the map smartly but with spirit it's just chance and that's why survivors feel powerless
---
These are somewhat mandatory for solo queuing. 
---
I believe they should make it harder for SWF people. So if its a hub of 4 SWF, boost killer accordingly. Many times I solo queue and no gens get done. Its frustrating to play solo queue bc not many times will you run into a competent team able to loop and do gens. Fucking ugly ass Jake sits in the corner crouching bc he can’t over Iridescent Button in ranks 1-7.
---
Always cleanse. Even if you think it may by Haunted Ground. Think of it this way: it's better that you trigger HG yourself when you're safe rather than risk a teammate cleansing it while you're mid-chase.
---
Game instantly DCed me out, besides I wouldnt want to waste those addons.
---
Wait what? I’ve been running that perk when I play him lol.
---
BT,bond,well make it,and balanced landing for an exhaustion perk or babysitter
---
Funny thing it, complete opposite for Killer. I try my best NOT to rank up after the reset with Killers because mid to low ranks are so much more fun than red ones.
---
This is pretty close to a perfect depiction of low ranks
---
I once played the “AFK Bubba with NOED, Blood Warden, Agitation, and Mad Grit” and instead of survivors just found gens and leaving they all 4 decided to open gates and then tbag I front of me. I smacked one, picked them up and smacked another one. Hooked the first one Blood Warden kicks in and the other 2 haven’t left yet. Go to the gate and they’re freaking out running in circles so I rev my saw and then take them out. 4K. 
---
I got 4 messages saying how my mother should have aborted me and that my dad is now a tranny hooker in Reno.
---
Save the best for last edit?
---
I really groan whenever I see certain infinities that have been in the game since launch that haven't been patched out of the game yet. By my understanding it is *very* easy for Behaviour to identify these problematic loops and fix the buildings or remove their spawn from the map generation, akin to how they changed the window spawns on Groaning Storehouse. Yet they still allow these loops (including the Groaning Storehouse loop) to spawn which essentially spells an automatic victory for the Survivors unless the Killer runs Bamboozle, which is another "mandatory" perk on a list that already includes 2 mandatory perks in the form of BBQ and Ruin.
---
Especially when I see shit like the Myers house (Balanced Landing) infinite, Wretched Shop loop, or Ironworks of fucking Misery infinite I don't understand why they don't just smash the window to turn it into a doorway akin to the broken walls on Hawkin's Lab. That seems like a very simple fix to me that fixes the core issue with the map design. You can even put a pallet there to still keep that part of the map "safe" but allow a Killer to actually counter it instead of saying "run Bamboozle or go home xd."
---
No idea. The e-mails that have been sent out don't mention any sort of data being released. If I had to guess it probably wouldn't be - releasing data like that tends to have some negative feedback. Imagine if they publicly released data that showed that, in a perkless environment (specifically without Ruin), Survivors escaped more times than not. That would confirm to many people that killers are weak, and deserving of buffs...and if BHVR didnt buff them, then why are they ignoring the data?
---
People thought he was good. Borderline top 5 killer. Till Ghostface came out which is just a much better version of him. Then most rankings dropped Myers below the killers that he was previously ahead of.
---
What does the one under player level mean?
---
Also, odd numbers *shudders*
---
Adorable.
---
i have it tier 3 tho? maybe cause i still have borrowed maxed out since then? idk
---
I know but the only main objective shouldn't be that fast to get done
---
Did this yesterday against a teabagging Kate.
---
Hooked her SWF partner in EGC and pretended like I was leaving, hag trapped back during the unhook and yoinked her.
---
The silent disconnect in postgame chat was the icing on the cake really.
---
NOED is a crutch perk. Just like exhaustion perks are crutch perks. Just like DS is a crutch perk. Just like Insidious is a crutch perk for campers (because it counters BT). Just like Stridor is a crutch perk for Spirits.
---
They aren't wrong. They are saying the same thing every streamer does. Which is "NOED stops you from learning the killer."
---
I know you see the killers aura but they can see your aura too? Damn didn’t know that lol. But yea I’m prolly gonna run the build u suggested bud replace wmi for babysitter
---
That cat will feel my purple flashlight, head on, d strike, pallet slam and tbag until it DC's and uninstalls.
---
Remember when borrowed time was broken? I mean, Literally broken. Like, players would bm you for farming.
---
&gt;As it stands survivors are still significantly stronger than killers,
---
???
---
Almost every game I'm going up against at least 3 red ranks, and I practically always get 4ks. I play Wraith practically exclusively. And by no means am I good at the game. I miss swings constantly and sometimes I'll lose track of survivors middle of the chase. The game is definitely killer biased, and if it wasn't for loops survs wouldn't even have a chance. Killers can have such a strong informational advantage at times, especially with perks, that it's your own fault for not using them.
---
Please explain why you think survivors are significantly stronger than killers?
---
It's 80s alone. That's over a minute and that's not including any slow down perks.
---
Lol playing smart, you're figuratively flipping a coin and hoping you get it right.
---
I think whatever tier it was she, it happened is what you get unless it was in your current Bloodweb.
---
Imagine playing Spirit. You clearly lack the skill to play any other killer.
---
If it is no different then exhaust and second chance perks? Why so much whining? 
---
He in good conscience also agreeing to fact that he wants killer s to play in a 'certain way'. Who the fuck he think he is?
---
It hit before the pallet went down tho?
---
1m 20s without any slow down but ruin gets destroyed almost immediately because totem placement is awful. Thanata Is unreliable unless your plague and dying light isnt worth the time it takes to get the stacks .
---
Premonition is the only perk that detects undetectable killers now, Spine Chill no longer lights up anymore
---
From a balancing perspective, making keys and moris rarer doesn’t change the fact that they fucking destroy the balance of a match. Being able to straight up eliminate a survivor after a single hook is busted as hell, and being able to straight up leave early because a couple of your friends died and the hatch spawned is also busted, but to a far lesser extent. It’s not about them being annoying, it’s about them being unbalanced as all hell
---
You can literally see it hit you if you pause at 5 seconds before the pallet is down
---
Only for his perks really. Pop goes the weasel and bamboozle are great perks
---
Pop, surge and surveillance are the 3 best gen perks in the game atm imo. Ruin is overrated.
---
I don't know why you're being down voted. Here's an up vote for speaking facts.
---
My Playstyle is that i usually abandon chases as soon as i realize i get lead to an infinite, or believe the surv just wants to waste my time. Those are usually the obsession aswell. I used to have No one escapes Death but want to replace it. I dont use Ruin and dont want to
---
Which perk is better to have for this/my playstyle, brutal strenght or Save the best for last? I think STBFL, but Brutal Strengh sounds more reliable.

I think my first escape was running from a wraith who stood at a safe distance ringing his bell repeatedly, and my dumb ass booked it every time.
---
Lol yeah mee too, but I think it's on november 13 or 17
---
Please do make a strawman and assume things about me. I love when people do that.
---
I don't hate any perks. I specifically stated that I don't even care about NOED, as it never affects me. The problem with NOED is that is serves to make lower rank games even more killer sided, when it's already so. Like how Exhaustion perks + DS + Adrenaline make high ranked games even more survivor sided.
---
No one heals against plague what are you on about.
---
Play for fun.
---
it's honestly ridiculous that it's been this way for so long. it makes the whole meta so stale because if you run something fun that isn't top-tier then you usually get rushed. and low rank survivors can't consistently hit great skill checks so they have no chance.
---
This is why I'm taking a break from the game. This happens in 50 ping lobbies too.

I think it would be a better idea for them to continue on focusing performance on dedicated servers and improving crossplay functionality so we can merge the currently divided playerbase and effectively reduce load times. I do agree that there should be more to do while waiting however, and I think giving access to the store and the archives while you're searching for a game would be a good start and something that wouldn't be hard to implement at all. Just be happy we're not in the state Deathgarden™: BLOODHARVEST is right now.
---
I've only actually encountered one camping leatherface.
---
That being said, he doesn't seem to be a very popular killer period, so I haven't run into a lot to compare to. I feel like camping is blown out of proportion, though I might just be lucky with my matches. I hear a lot more accusations of camping then I actually see campers.
---

Oh yeah with toolboxes it's beyond ridiculous, but the screenshot my friend shared with me (of the match that ended in 6 minutes) no one even had a toolbox or even Prove Thyself.
---
The theoretical maximum speed of every Survivor running an Engineer's Toolbox with a Brand New Part and Socket Swivels with two people working on the same generator at a time with Prove Thyself is beyond bonkers. There have been plenty of theoretical studies on Reddit and YouTube over how fast a generator can be done but these theories do hardly come into practice. (Mostly because most Killers have Ruin and no one enjoys those games where "three gens are done in the first minute of the match annnnnnnd the Killer DCed.") But the point still stands that gens *can* be done *ridiculously* fast with very little skill or effort on the Survivors' part. You spent 13000 bloodpoints so you should be able to do a gen instantly right? 4head
---
You forgot about the bullshit magic murder truck it drives.
---
I mean you can always play self care simulator..
---
.. just go in a corner and touch yourself.
---
this is probably the best comment I've ever seen
---
for me? it’s low rank hillbillies with winter eyes that camp hooks
---
Meta. 
---
If the killer stays by the hook you don't rescue without BT or some big ass balls.
---
If the killer plays non BM they will look for another chase asap. You can either look to unhook or get the killers attention so another can unhook.

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dti62g/i_noticed_on_plagues_blight_skin_in_the_custom/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Do you run Make Your Choice? I heard that's pretty brutal on a Freddy who hooks people near gens, runs away, waits for the unhook to activate Make Your Choice, then teleports to the nearby gen and instadowns the unhooker.
---
Same also applies to Devour Hope but I find my Hex Totems never last longer than 30 seconds so I don't run any besides Haunted Grounds by itself, or NOED.
---
The unhook 3 survivors (i think) during the endgame collapse is gonna be tricky since its the end of the game and most likely survivors will be on their last hook OR the killer will protect the hook to guarantee that kill during thw EGC

&gt;Na. Spirit is fine. Instead of forcing the game to cater to your inexperience try changing your play style. 
---
It's not *fine* when a killer can stand still to create a mind game with zero tells.
---
Go in the game and look at the news tab.
---
It cannot be denied that SWF communication is a massive advantage that isn't reflected by the ranking sytem. Even so, in this case, his friend was clearly a newbie to the point of not knowing a mori. If you have that person on the team you might as well have 1 person disconnect since he would pretty much hiding at the faintest of heartbeat or at the edge of his hook phase. 
---
Even if he were not that new, i.e., someone having atleast 50-100 hours, facing a competent rank 1 killer isn't a easily achievable feat, comms or not. Multiple streamers like Tru3 and Otz demolishes most well coordinated SWF's with ease, even with non-high tier/meta killers.
---
Get better at button mashing 🤷‍♀️
---
Go in the game and look at the news.
---
The big issue is that any remotely competent Survivor will identify these god loops and abuse them not to be mean, but simply because it's the safest option they have and like everyone else they want to win.
---
I recently had a game where I was playing addonless Wraith (trying to get rid of my Pustula Petals on him) and I got Wreched Shop. **Every** time I found a Survivor they'd **immediately** go to the shop and start running me around it. This meant that I'd at most get one surprise hit on a Survivor and then be faced with the choice of either spending about a minute running around a garbage infinite just to get one down or to give it up and accomplish nothing.
---
"Learn when to drop the chase" is fine and all until you have to drop *every* chase. At the end of the day the Killer's objective is to kill, not to stall the gens as long as possible. With the problem of every chase taking too much time you force Killers to either run obnoxious 3-gen strats (3 gen Hag, Hostage Doc, Slowdown Freddy) or lose outright. In short either no one has fun or the Killer doesn't have fun.
---
Just find someone and camp like the rest of these clowns.
---
I mean it can't be that hard to take something already in the game and just put it somewhere else. Legit just a skill check, the tiniest thing ever to move.
---
Hag's is awesome too.
---
There are many drag queens that play dbd! I think Trixie plays dbd too.
---
Forever Freddy is NOTHING compared to an OG Freddy who knew his stuff and juggled targets. OG Freddy had 50% slow basekit (and greater than 75% with addons) and if he constantly switched targets and aimed to have 2+ survivors asleep at any one time, the game would grind to a halt.
---
me irl
---
Killer Main (Rank 4 ATM)
---
I rarely use Ruin cause I find myself just protecting my totem which isnt very fun and once it's broken if you don't have enough pressure then you're fucked
---
Theres no excuse to face camp, and I only use NOED if I'm doing an endgame build.
---
To me Pop and discordance work better for gen protection than ruin. I think you just have to either end chases faster or just realize when you need to give up on a survivor and go protect the Gens.
---
Like a lot of people in this thread have mentioned: it's 80 seconds if the Survivors don't have toolboxes or Prove Thyself and don't hit greats. Yes the theoretical 80 second chase doesn't happen often, but neither does the theoretical 80 second gen.
---
you've never faced a leatherface have you? I'm in red ranks and just ran into a camping bubba today.
---
I’ve been playing Legion a lot lately, and tend to get 2-4 kills each game
---
Latest Pig nerf. Traps now are auto-removed on the hook to discourage tunneling people with traps.
---
Ah yes, the wild Bubba in his natural habitat
---
Adrenaline isn't comparable, noed activates when you do bad (not defend objectives), adrenaline activates when you do well (team completes objectives).
---
I think a better comparison is last survivor gets hatch with 5 gens done, which I agree is stupid.
---
Tldr noed sucks, hatch with 5 gens left is stupid.
---
You can get that addon on the bloodweb, doesn't matter which rank you are
---
Oh, you got tombstoned m8. Or fragmented. It's a set of Mikey boi addons that make his t3 a mori when prompted
---
Let’s not forget about god loops that are connected by multiple smaller loops making it easy to combo into them seriously are we forgetting Haddon Field with Balanced Landing
---
Yes it is, it is tombstone or tombstone piece.
---
Myers is the only one who can do that.
---
It’s called Judith’s Tombstone (or Tombstone Piece) and it allows him to grab and Mori you without knocking you to the ground once he reaches tier 3
---
Yes? Constantly? Both sides complain all the time, it’s what we do
---
Isn’t Judith his sister or something?
---
I think because different killers has different map pressure gen speed must be changed depends on what killer is in game. Like let’s have gen speed set at 60 seconds for nurse or spirit but 120 seconds for low tier killers like clown
---
What’s this movie ?
---
If you think of a workload as a programmer, for something like that you'd likely have to end up digging into the code a bit to find that precise piece and to put it somewhere else it might not natively function normally could be more work than someone on the outside looking in might think, especially considering how much smaller BHVR is compared to a regular AAA studio.
---
New bug?
---
Now that's interesting, but the same phenomenon. Survivors have shorter queues at lower ranks, although when I SWFd with a purple rank friend it took much longer.
---
"GG you piece of shit!"
---
Looks like he's made out of burnt pizza
---
rotating my stick doesn’t take a lot of skill
---
Namco Bandai  
---
It expired in 2015. They had it patented for 20 years prior to that (so since 1995)  
---
So far only Indie games have really stepped up to the plate since the patent expired though.
---
I've had slugged obsessions (They're not affected by the perk, so you want them off gens, but if you hook them, they can suicide and shut your perk off, so I slug them) simply DC to counter Dying Light.
---
An obsession death should just keep Dying Light active, but prevent you from gaining any more stacks. Now you have a choice if you want to go after the obsession once you have enough stacks or keep them alive so you get get more stacks.
---
I've only had ruin for a few weeks but I already hate what it does to the game. On Ghost Face, if it's gone inside of a minute and a half I know I'm not getting a 4k. If it lasts the whole game I almost always 4k. More often than not it gets cleansed pretty quickly, but it's conditioning me in a way that I don't like. I see the trend of its survival being causal with me winning games, so the need to camp or proxy camp it at least for the first few minutes is annoying. I don't *want* to camp it, but when it's visible from a wide angle in the middle of the map or even worse, in an area with a gen, I know I'm 100% fucked the minute someone wanders into that area. 
---
It's unreliable but when it's up it's undeniably a powerful perk. If I was still in low ranks I wouldn't bother with it - no need. But in purple and red where I'm at now people will blow through gens so damn fast if you're not running it. I still don't really need it on Freddy, but on Michael or Ghost Face I *have* to run it.
---
Yea sorry chief but that ain’t it. That’s hitboxes
---
If it was a T3 lunge, which it might have been, they would've gotten you with or without the pallet. It's a huge lunge.
---
Mock me all you want, but I generally don't use locater perks or Ruin or Corrupte Intervention. I fuck around with more fun builds. And the best part is that survivors never see it coming.
---
Half the game is done before they realize what perks i'm bringing to the table and with what killer I combine them with.
---
So yeah, if you need ruin to stall the game or BBQ and NC to find survivors? You're a noob.
---
Start by playing Survivor more. Then you'll have a good idea where they're hiding and the loops they use.
---
Ah yes. Can’t forget the double window building, one of which has a balcony lol
---
I've played 9 hours. What does this mean?
---
Hear me out. Is it you? I've noticed a uptick in laggy killers sometimes too. I dont know what it is.

Thank you so much for that title. I immediately started signing the song in my head. Such a classic.
---
On PC practice at it can be helpful, spamming a and d can be a pain.
---
Im actually gonna try to get the Adept Clown trophy after work. Do you have any suggested add-ons, knowing Ill only have Bamboozle, Pop and Coulrophibia?
---
Should I burn an offering to put me somewhere smaller or bring a mori?
---
Kind of sounds like you went against a deranker
---
Hmm...Sounds fair.
---
Yeah I mean Greats just get easier and easier to hit and the fact that tool boxes are so plentiful makes gens go by so fast (let’s not forget bnp) which survivors seem to love to argue aren’t strong but they give you 25% off the bat that can finish you a gen before a killer cane even find the gen your on seriously its pretty easy to loop killers to so it’s not rare by the time your done with a chase 3 gens are popped and let’s not forget about Prove Thyself being able fuck gens in a ungodly amount of time in fact with Prove Thyself you can probably finish a gen before the killer even finds your team and once he finds you someone takes the chase while everyone else finds a gen to do I do thi strategy all the time and it’s broken
---
Wait until you run up against Prayer Beads Spirit
---
That's Doctor. Clown does have an Ultra Rare addon that lets him instadown if he hits someone with the bottle itself, though.
---
It shouldn't be comparable, though. Imagine if landing the bottle never yielded a net gain. I'd rather play Plague at that point.
---
Clown isn't the WORST Killer, but I'd say Hag and even Trapper are stronger using the same function. The Clown, with a good read and aim, can PROBABLY shorten a loop or land a hit. Hag can almost certainly get the hit or break the loop with a skill she doesn't need to reload. Trapper has both the burdens of setup and having to think ahead, but his traps are an instant down in a chase, barring Dead Hard (in which case they actually hinder him).
---
So I wouldn't think it too strong if Clown also got the ability to pre-empt chases or make gens more threatening to provoke 3gens or soft pressure them.
---
Why did you report them when it’s BHVR’s fault?
---
I don’t like the stacking of broken/deep wounds across multiple hits, personally.  Logistically, if a Legion is focusing one person and hits them twice, and then lets them get away to go after another person, by the time they finish mending broken will be over, and they can heal like normal.  The add on for broken feels largely worthless to me, and halving its duration just makes it pointless.
---
That being said, I do like the other ideas...they were indeed marketed as a hidden killer among the survivors, and having some sort of way to actually blend in would be excellent.  As is the permanent terror radius and red stain mean they have no chance to blend in.
---
Not at high ranks. I barely encounter this at red ranks on PC. Killers know it’s not a viable strategy unless someone really pissed them off. 
---
I only play solo and call me crazy, but if it seems like a long chase and someone is being facecamped I’m not mad at the killer. Usually survivor who is a dick at red ranks. Killers can’t afford to be toxic.
---
but pressing it faster doesn’t make you wiggle any faster. people just can macro
---
So wait? Waiting for the confirmation of it to be devour hope when one person is down is worse then getting two people down because it was Haunted Grounds?
---
I play both sides and removing mori and making it by default on last survivor gonna need to remove the hatch also...
---
Also why to change mori?
---
Even if you did appear to tbag me at the end. 😉
---
Haha 69 is le sexy number xDDD sexyness: 100
---
Sounds good!
---
"gg piece of shit"
---
Ruin is for some killers, definitely. BBQ can be swapped with Thrilling Tremors no problem. You need some kind of information perk though, maybe two, and BBQ and TT are the best choices.
---
No, you'll be broken and by the time you recover, second will have been wasted. They don't work well together.
---
Wraith is disappointed in your inaccurate statement
---
I mean you still need to know where the people are
---
CrRagnarok-Xbox
---
As others have mentioned he Tombstoned you. Either with a piece or the main thing.  
---
Both Tombstone types increase the amount of stalking required to insta kill(standing mori) someone) by a ton. The pink variant (the Tombstone, not the piece) slows down his movement speed as well and allows him to keep his power after use. The purple variant (the Tombstone Piece) doesn't slow him down but after Tombstoning someone he gets kicked back to stage 2 of stalking.  
---
As a rule, if Myers is taking a long time to tier up he's probably either using one of those or he's using the infinite Tier 3 addon. Potentially both.
---
Somebody give this man a medal.
---
Hey, at least they kept the killer occupied for like 12 seconds
---
Spirit doesn’t have an exploit, just removes all the fun from the game. The point of an asymmetrical game is that the weaker group can still win by outplaying the stronger one. Spirit removes this by making it a guessing game. Instead of outplaying her, you simply get lucky which isn’t particularly fun. Things don’t need reworks solely because of exploits, they need reworks when they remove the fun from this game (or have you forgotten nurse?)
---
Maybe you should learn how to loop. You wouldn't be in this situation if you didn't already know.
---
So if I just stand at the exit and let them down me to escaping is that rude or nice? Don’t we both get points that way?
---
It's always the Davids =p
---
its a term used to talka bout hoe fast gens can go, it can get pretty fucking crazy.
---
I wonder how it would effect gameplay of survivors if Hex:NOED let the survivors know they were exposed as soon as the exit gates were powered
---
I’m with Plag....huh? :/
---
I thought the joke is that no one uses the Windows store. Or is that an xbox thing?
---
To be fair, thems cute birbs.
---
Yeah
---
Who cares about the few extra points. Just go and stop wasting time.
---
The release is pretty recent and a lot of players have assumed it would make her easier to play or just want to try out the reworked nurse. So instead of playing against good nurses you’re playing against a whole gamut of nurses. But seriously, if you look at any good nurse player they still win easily
---
Sad part is that if 4 gens do pop in 2 minutes even if you 4k off the 3 gen stack youll probably still black pip because defender emblem will be bronze.
---
Did Sony change their stance on crossplay?
---
console killers will be at an instant disadvantage.  You can’t spin the camera nearly as fast and frame drops are ridiculous (I’ll go from having someone downed, to dropped frames, now I’m hugging a wall and the survivor is already at a good jungle gym...and I’m on PS4 Pro)
---
I know nobody really gives a shit about the Switch version, but they do have a player base.  They have to deal with insane frame drops, graphic and color degradation (to the point where see scratch marks is near impossible), still don’t have the archives or new cosmetics, etc.
---
Before bhvr decides to fuck anything else up, let’s just fix what we have already.  Fix the damn issues in the game that we already have lol
---
were you a trapper when this happened? if so, I might have been the dweet.
---
Doing a totem takes 14 seconds. That means doing all 5 totems takes 70 seconds. Just because I did totems doesn't mean I didn't do gens or unhook.
---
Thanatophobia. Hearing the same shit about “No counter play” and “Unfun to play against”. That kind of talk is what got Legion massacred. Spooks me man ;/
---
Not very difficult with the beads to just find people on gens. Unless you're playing against the most immersed people ever.
---
Yeah no shit is the truth lol
---
Rats, your all alone! :( I will save you!!
---
People also wonder why slugging happens so often
---
And Moris
---
And bullshit killer addons
---
etc
---
People who play Plague usually play with Dying light and Thanatophobia. Builds that slow down gen progression usually aren’t very fun.
---
She’s far from op, but whenever the community focuses on a killer to hate, they usually end up getting nerfed. Just look at Nurse and Spirit. Next it will be Billy, then Freddy, then Plague, etc.
---
Only allow the stacks and BP for solo Q players, will probably have some relief for the killers that hate SWF.
---
People are starting to hate on Plague because of Thanatophobia.
---
It's awesome :3
---
I was thinking maybe Second Wind ignores the Broken status of Deliverece. Would have been a cool and creative combo.... Eh whatever
---
Adding Secondary Objectives wouldn't make them money. Plus it's actually improving base mechanics, not dding new stuff like DLCs or battle passes or cosmetics. So why would they do that? This is how McCote and his handlers/minions think. And this is why the game is in the state that it's in. Still the same bland ass cake that it was three years ago, just with extra toppings to mask it.
---
I'll make it as simple as I can:
---
* Improving base mechanics equals a more diversity of playstyles.
---
* More diversity of playstyles equals a higher skill cap. 
---
* A higher skill cap equals a more rewarding skilled play.
---
* More rewarding skilled play equals more players; especially more competitive players.
---
* More competitive players equals more hardcore gamers.
---
* More hardcore gamers equals better queue times.
---
* Better queue times equals more people playing your game.
---
* More people playing your game equals more people willing to spend money on your game.
---
* More people willing to spend money on your game equals more PROFIT for your company.
---
Hello, McFly. It's not rocket science. The path to make this a vastly more successful game is focusing first and foremost on base mechanics, not fucking DLCs and a battle pass.
---
But what do their short-sighted asses do? Pump out as many DLCs and cosmetics as they can, focus on a battle pass and adding content to those things.
---
This is why when they have their free weekends that new players try the game out then promptly never pick the game back up again.  This is why they are so deperate to pump money out of their remaining players since they see that the player count isn't expanding like other games - it just stays the same over the course of the year. And this is why, when their remaining customers finally have had enough of them ignoring core issues that they'll leave the game and play something more rewarding.
---
yeah i literally dont even kick the gen or patrol the center and just let them have it. even better if they start three genning on one side so you can force them out of the middle
---
Nah, I've tested it. If you're broken from deliverance second wind shuts off. The perk itself states if you're already broken it won't activate, and it won't activate when you recover from broken since you haven't been unhooked at that moment.
---
The thing is is just because clown can work doesn't mean that he's good, look at old Freddy for example some builds work wonderfully but he was still really bad. Clown may not be f teir but he is no where near myers or even plague his slowdown bottles are only good for getting pallets early and shortening some loops but it doesn't matter when you get genrushed because no survivor has to worry about you downing the chase and quickly downing them I'm not saying he's terrible but he is easily bottom mid teir at most
---
Mmmm
---
While you cat reach perfect balance they could increase Repair speed for Rank 20 Survivor (to make up for the fact that they dont have meta perks and are not as efficient) and debuff survivor repair speed when they rank up + another repair speed penalty for every additional SWF Member in your group (they share important information over discord and thus can be way more efficient more members = more information shared = bigger repair penalty).
---
Glonk kinda cute tho😳
---
Unfortunately it isn't as simple as just adding X extra seconds needed to complete each gen. With how many band-aid fix options killers have for gen stall, I feel like it would be too strong having Pop, surveillance, discordance, and so on along with the traditional ruin of course. Not to mention the semi-recent Thanataphobia + Dying Light combo being useful on Plague, Legion, and especially Swing Chain Freddy.
---
This goes all the way down to the low level killers who don't give a fuck about emblems and bp and facecamp every hook, even if playing optimally against it as survivors, it isn't hard to edge out 2 kills as killer using this tactic, especially with ruin and noed, imagine if gens took lets say 30 seconds longer each, that would make a huge difference for having more time to facecamp "effectively"
---
oH No!!! sOmEOnE uSeD tHe sHAcK PAlleT!!
---
He explained that he was actually asking if he was picking him up after being chased in an earlier comment  but wouldn't go as well in a meme
---
If they do much as touch Freddy or Billy I will deadass uninstall.
---
Then cleanse!
---
*Laughs in Blood Warden*
---
*suddenly realizes.. I am nobody*
---
Yeah it sucks for that. But more fun than losing in 2-4 minutes. It's not the most fun match but more fun.
---
Im a trapper user and I find ruin kind of useless in my strategy of trapper. I go to the best possible 3 gen spot and trap the whole place. U easily have time to do that.
---
It's not rude at all. It is rude to pretend you'll give a hit then dead hard out the exit though
---
They already said they are reworking Billy next. After that it will be The Doctor. After that they may do the Spirit but I think it will take at least 6 months before that happens. But yeah, the devs already said they are reworking Billy back in July. Back when they announced they were gonna rework Nurse
---
The entire point is to waste time, to give survivors not in the gate more time to get to the other gate and such. Unless all who are left are there, then I agree with you
---
Oh is that all? Heh. In my experience I still think Plague has a major weakness which is if no one cleanses, and survivors can run good enough loops, she's basically just an M1 killer as vile purge is basically done for if everyones already broken and injured. I might be missing something though since i'm new to plague and haven't played many matches against her.
---
“But... Corrupt Purge OP”
---
It’s the same shit. Nobody plays as the plague so when people go against her it’s a new experience.  If more people played against the plague, they’d see that corrupt purge is nowhere near as effective as the Huntress due to its dicey hit detection and low range.
---
YOU TAKE THAT BACK YOU DIRTY BOT. WHO PAID YOU TO TALK SHIT ON OUR OTZ? HOW DARE YOU. I WILL FIND YOU AND OTZTIFY YOU. 
---
Lol
---
Yeah they’ll see your aura too, but like I said it can open up a mind game option if they’re far enough away from the hook.  
---
I think you’ll have a good time with that build, I usually do,  plus the extra bp gains will be nice.  
---
Have fun and best of luck!

ah okay good to know thanks
---
80 seconds for a chase is far too long. Your timer HAS to be a pallet or hit in 15 seconds. This doesnt mean follow a surv for 2 minutes eating every pallet on the map. It means getting rid of a gens nearby pallet in 15 seconds or a hit then rotating unless they make a mistake.

The thing is that devs nerf killers who “overperform.” The problem with this is that they count dc’s as “overperforming,” since people usually dc when they are losing. Which is a major why Legion got nerfed to the ground.
---
If people dc against Plague because they find her annoying, the devs will eventually nerf her. It’s just the way it is I guess

"Dr. Death" Steve Williams? He ruled!
---
How many outfits all together? &amp; you get to grind your ass off for 2 😑 last year there was an outcry about not being able to get all hallowed blight cosmetics even if you grinded and they ended up changing it
---
Yup, now you’re getting it. This is a major reason why I became a survivor main recently. It’s less frustrating. Killer is fun and all but you get screwed in the end. If there’s one thing survivors don’t like or find too difficult, it’s getting nerfed. No question about it.
---
What's the visual to the right of the jigsaw Billy puppet? I understand all of the others except for that one and I feel it's super obvious and I'm just dumb XD
---
No I don't think so, I pay for good fibre man. My other team mate dc because of the lag. Yeah and last game my dead hard activated but I got hit and downed anyway. Usually it either lags and just doesn't activate in time or works, not had this one before lol.
---
r/redditsings
---
It’s the Ghostface exposed thingy :,D
---
And give people a bonus to bp after X games without D/Cing that completely resets to zero any time you D/C.  
---
Deathgarden has it and it works.
---
An optimal SWF is guaranteed at least a 2-3 man escape. Nothing that can be done about that.
---
Ive noticed the streamers who 4k the most often all share the same trait though - their very good at using slugging efficiently. Snowballing slugs is pretty much the best way to win because 12 hooks is tough unless its potatoes.
---
You don’t need ruin
---
Old Freddy games were definitely long. I enjoyed him, but it was still detrimental not being able to hit survivors unless they slept.
---
Can you see it on other players? I've never experienced it so sorry if u can, I'm seriously just dumb XD
---
yes, but what other objectives could there be? Adding more objectives would basically just be adding more gens but they have different models. 
---
I think just upping gen times should help, but ruin would need to get a slight nerf if gen times were high, like if a gen is 100 seconds then ruin should only decrease by like 3-4 seconds instead of 5
---
Well since they also made Deathgarden that means they know that reward works better than punishment so why haven't they done this yet lol?
---
please delete this picture of me
---
Trixie convinced me to play DBD after F13th flopped
---
Fair enough
---
You're welcome! Sorry, I know I did shove a lot of information at you, but I wanted to go into a bit of detail. Don't take this as your absolute, end all be all resource; I've only been playing since, like, a month before Ghostface came out, so I'm relatively new too, but any tips and tricks are better than none, and since you appreciated the last one, I went Overboard again.
---
So, usually, rushing to a gate IS what you wanna do, especially if NOED comes into play, so you're good on that, but you do want to try to consider what's going on with your teammates, and dealing with Reverse Bear Traps messes with their priorities. If you see someone w a trap before you get to a door or if you know which one's been worked on, you can try to bodyblock by crouching behind them at a Box (crouch bc you're not immediately next to Box and are a bit more obvious in an open space); if killer comes, get between them so they'll hit you first, and if your teammate is almost done, they don't need to worry about getting grabbed and have a few extra seconds to try to get it off.
---
---(For NOED: if someone gets downed by it, look around the tile you're on to see if it's there, and look around on your way to a Gate. Unless you've cleansed a bunch of dulls and know where the Hex totem is *not*, safest play is to open the door, bc you wanna avoid getting downed, and wait in the Gate to see what comes first: cleansing, killer, or timer getting low; if it's the last two, leave. If you did cleanse most of the dulls, you can either try to look for the Hex or head out. There's no shame in leaving someone to the hook; at lower ranks, you don't wanna go for the save and be the catalyst for why it suddenly went from a 1k to a 4k.)
---
My thought process for a typical non-Pig and NOED-less end game is usually something like, "Oh no, I'm running to the Gate, I'm opening it, I hope the killer doesn't come over and grab/hit me before I'm done. Wait, they didn't? Alright, I need to heal myself while it's safe. Is killer at the other Gate? Is it far enough away that if they're patrolling them, I'm safe rn? Are they chasing someone? If they are, I need to keep an eye on health states - who's injured? Do I need to head back and take a hit? Oh, here's one of my teammates, let me heal them - where are the others? 
---
---"If I open this gate, EGC doesn't let me know if someone's opened the other Gate, so do I 99 it so I have more time to lead them here, or are they getting chased and I need to open it now? Oh, the other Gate opened, I need to open mine too! Hey, it's... That timer's getting kinda low. Why haven't they left? Are they waiting for me to get to them? Alright, I'll escape from here; hopefully they've been doing the same thing as me and I didn't miss an opportunity to take a hit. Oh, they ran out too! Awesome!"
---
If someone gets hooked, usually everyone leaves their gate to head over and see what the situation is; if you see someone else go for the save and you don't hear the Terror Radius, head back to the Gate or stay to help take hits. If the killer's camping, unhooking is usually reserved for those w Borrowed Time and everyone without needs to try to bait the killer into getting far enough away without getting downed themselves. If everyone gets whacked, usually all escape or all retreat far enough to heal and try again. 
---
---If survivor on hook is in struggle state and/or they're the only one to get close enough for the unhook, person w/o BR tries unhooks and hopes for the best. (Hopefully, if they end up trading places on the hook, they haven't progressed as far. If they're dead on hook, it's a bad trade unless killer slugs and you *might* get to pick them up. If they're in first or second stage, everyone else either has some time to heal up and go for the save, or they'll accept that they can't save everyone and leave.)
---
... And everything else is already too much, but if the killer opens a door before hooking, they have Blood Warden. If a locker's nearby, hide in it until hook aura fades so you're hidden in case they have BBQ. Open your door, stay out of the Exit Gate so they can't see your aura in it, and you either go for the save bc you're stuck anyways and might as well, or you try to hide until it ends w/o staying in one spot long enough to attract crows.
---
Whelp most of us are in this for the BP for the sake of unlocking the things we want, so I think it solves the problem. DCs aren't so prevalent at the higher ranks that they ruin games.
---
You can get her something better than that bloated pos alienware laptop
---
10/10
---
SWF is an entirely different beast. I think SWF should be an entirely different playstyle and killers should be in a different queue for it with automatic double BP for just bothering with it.
---
Why thank you :p I humbly accept!
---
Hey they wanted the attention, now they can have all of it.
---
Being said I never do this I usually play the game normally but play a little more tunnely towards them if I have good momentum.
---
Made with mematic, instant upvote
---
Forgot to add I'm playing EU
---
It could just be killers with bad pings. Like I said though I've been running into a lot of lag myself with killers it seems like it's either the game acting up or a lot of laggy killers.
---
shack is an infinite and Overcharge makes gens impossible
---
This scenario actually happens like 50% of the time, not always. It's still too much though. And from my experience, i'm probably unlucky, cuz my team doesn't do gens most of the time. So much for playing solo.
---
Watch zubat, true, otz or fungoose. They rarely run hex ruin and almost always do very well. 
---
General traits of a good killer:
---
always slug to get extra value from a double chase
---
kill one before its down to 1 gen
---
snowball if possible
---
dont chase if you cant get value in 15 seconds
---
dont give easy unhooks if their altruistic
---
If the killer isn’t fun at all to go against by everyone isn’t that a sign they need a change though? Survivors complain a lot but I don’t blame them for not wanting to play if they hate playing. Games are supposed to be fun.
---
In fairness insidious and knockout arent useful for much on spirit
---
What do you mean? I can do very well with legion at rank 15. /s
---
There's literally been hundreds of people who have asked this. This info is readily available.
---
I just played a Plague game yesterday, played normally without being a tuneller or camper...got massive hate at the end of the game for playing Plague. Dude even said he would rather play against Spirits than Plague...and I didn´t even use Thana or Dying Light.
---
I was just staring at the screen thinking wtf.
---
This was my first time seeing it.
---
This is going to controversial
---
I used Deja Vu back when my perk selection was lacking, and it taught me early on that it's always a good idea to knock the clustered gens out ASAP.  
---
There's few things more frustrating than a 3 gen Doc slowly stomping out your will to live.
---
Honestly, since Deathgarden has a significantly smaller player base, I think its being used as a testing ground for DBD. A lot of things they've done there have been translated into DBD. The bonus BP thing is a newish feature (past few months) so they might not feel comfortable with the data yet.
---
Got told to "[censor] his [censor] you tunneling [censor]" because he kept running over Hag traps. Bitch I just teleport and whack - we wouldn't have this relationship if you'd crouch once.
---
oof
---
Well its just a little nuts when the game literally lasts 5-6 min but there have still been a decent number of hooks and chases werent even really long. 
---
I've been on both sides of that coin
---
Beautiful ❤
---
Yeah lol i had already hooked the other guy twice pretty early cause he wasnt very good and figured i should hit someone on full health if they are exposed
---
It says right in the perk that if you have the broken effect that second wont activate. They did that (i assume) to combat super meta combos like that
---
I like to bait that, and then take off while the killer is busy dancing with no one lol
---
There is no fun in a game of 5 minutes only stress
---
May I ask where can i find the link to download it? It might be not here or I'm just underdeveloped..
---
BUT LET'S NERF SPIRIT THAT'S THE TOP PRIORITY /s
---
Second wind activates proper when you are unhooked or you unhook yourself without having the broken status effect. You have to heal another person(s) by 1 accumulative health state to enable the perk to activate. I use the perk myself so ive learned its limitations.
---
I just report people who say stuff like "kill yourself" or "I hope you die on cancer" in the post-game-chat. Ive never reported anyone just because the had a specific gamestyle or did something toxic ingame.
---
Would be cool but it spoils the surprise
---
I'm pretty new, what was the objective last year?
---
True always runs ruin, he’ll swap it out for corrupt intervention now and then.  
---
Fungoose uses ruin always, very often combined with pop. It’s fun needing 2 slots for gen regression.
---
my train of thought. i get yelled at if i pop hg (only done it twice) and whenever I do do it, the killer normally wastes it chasing one person instead of coming after the rest of us on gens
---
I got reported for using walls as nurse. 
---
Dummyhead David: "You blinked to me as I was walking. I recorded this and you're gonna be banned." 
---
Me: "Oh it's what one of my perks can do, I highly suggest getting it"
---
That perk, was BBQ and Chili
---
If you can’t get a hit or a pallet in 15 secs, it’s time to fuck off.  I don’t remember the last ti,e I was in a 60+ second chase unless I’m screwing around with a slug on the ground
---
That is the build I want to use cos it's an absolute meme but it is crazy that people thing it is like a form of cheating.
---
Need dead by daylight coloring book by OP
---
It'd be great if people weren't asses about winning. Lol
---
As is anyone every gets banned. The report function still does nothing.
---
I love her too man
---
Even though she's a child mentally ;-;
---
That's cool and all, but dont tell me you haven't had gens done in like no time and your stuck trying to get the necessary hooks before the other gens are done. I can sort of understand not running ruin with billy and spirit and especially nurse but not running some type of slow down with someone like wraith or trapper is just dumb. Also ruin isnt that bad to go against. I do the gens all the time with ruin. Noobs run around the map trying to find the totem.
---
I complain about both sides.
---
Guess you can call me Mr. Worldwide 😎
---
You cause enough chaos as the killer and they won't even have the chance to do the gens without Ruin. Recognize which gens they're trying to finish and check on them sooner than others. If they're down to 2 gens left focus in protecting the closest 3. You'll win almost every game.
---
It feels good from survivor side too... y'know, 'tunneling means that the killer really likes you'
---
I wonder how they can differentiate certain cases. It says not to report tunneling, but then also says there's a temp ban for "Targeting specific users repeatedly in order to ruin their game experience". 
---
I wouldn't do that myself, but what's the difference?
---
You can't be serious, some people I swear
---
Try taking the lead in those games so your team can shine doing gens.
---
As a clown main, I like clown not being played a lot. Lotsa poor souls trying to play windows without realizing they can't fast vault them when intoxicated.
---
got a “get reported scumbag” last night for vomiting on someone as the plague.
---
Yeah could be the game I guess, sometimes the menu lags as well when trying to swap out items and offerings, you ever get that? Although the killers were unaffected by the lag which is what made me think it's their host
---
Oh man Hag traps with that scream get me. Also a prayer beads Spirit pulling me off a Gen or coming back to the hook always makes me jump a little without that warning.
---
high rank survivor is also very weird
---
sometimes i do like 1 and a half gens and my team is on point so all the other gens are done now and also no one has been hooked and i did nothing all game
---
then sometimes my team gets slaughtered in 30 seconds like I'm in low ranks
---
so this is another bug that made the game better?
---
Billy is one of the two killers who don’t need Ruin so this is pointless
---
Okay math wizard. are you adding up the time it takes you to FIND said totems? you could know all the places a totem can spawn on every map, and still have trouble finding all of them. The totem spawns are all random and the maps are sometimes HUGE! most of coldwind, red forest, the game, and all the maps over 10,000 meters. inner strength doesn't help to find them, it just helps give you a heal quick if need be. and running 2 perks for JUST for hex totems isn't smart. if they aren't running any? then half your build isn't all that useful and you just wasted and your time looking/cleansing tomes were wasted besides some blood points. meanwhile your team is struggling with at least 1 person distracting the killer and only 2 people doing gens. while noed is strong, it's not that strong that you need to dedicate, 2 perk slots and potentially quite a bit of time just for 1 or 2 hex perks. you can easily run through ruin if you are good at skill checks. and if someone already got ruin finding noed during end game won't be hard.
---
Then people dc cause you're slugging. There is basically no way to do something at high ranks without getting criticism for it.
---
You got dedicated served
---
My menu lags out when joining matches on the survivor side. It gives me a error and then my menu options disappear and I have to restart the game. It happens multiple times.
---
So, you don't know the story behind the picture, but the first thing that you decide to do is belittle the survivor and assume this is okay for the killer to do this. You think survivors who are bad at running deserve camp? Or that if 90% of killers do this it's okay to do this, and on that same note, that it's not okay to be angry about it? "I can't run the killer so I deserve to be denied any fun in the round", wasn't that the mentality that leads to toxicity that everyone seems so tired of? Like I don't mind giving the killer the hook so he can earn points, but I would expect him to show basic human decency and at least let me get off when there's BPS for everyone.
---
you can't seriously say you see a fountain of devotion and think "oh boy! this is gonna be a fun game!"
---
Huh... I see. Well that kinda sucks but whatever
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
I’m so glad i play on console. Something tells me if I played this on pc I’d hate it. Also have it set so people have to add me as a friend before they can send a message, so that helps too.
---
I have to get myers now.  -__-  I llike demigorgon.
---
Infinite’s don’t really exist anymore. If you mind game you can end them, I can only think of two that still exist. Insta blinds aren’t a thing anymore. Keys suck but I’d argue Moris are much, much worse. Brand new parts aren’t nearly as strong as they used to be luckily. The Azarov maps are really good, especially as hillbilly or Michael. Object isn’t good now due to the recent changes. 
---
Are you really complaining about rainbow maps? Sorry but you lost your credibility.
---
u/Unliteracy just made a comment on another post about how he’s a rank 1 clown player who doesn’t use ruin. Still need more proof?
---
Because killer mains are usually more patient as more things are survivor sided
---
Yeah get stuff like that all the time too. last game I was in (just now) the killer teleported and hit me then got stunned by a pallet and teleported back the other side. Then when he was chasing me it rubber banded me back and I got hit, absolute bs atm.
---
When they DC they should have to watch the entity kill them first before going to the menu. Like the quitality from mortal combat.
---
another reason why kindred's aura reading should trump undetectable
---
also off topic but I've NEVER seen that gen spawn there before wtf. in the grass between the street and sidewalk sure but never on the street like that
---
Happens to me all the time! I got used to it and rather than react to situations (killer movement but not mind games),  I try to predict them - and often and up losing the Guessing Game. 2k hours in game but getting downed like rank 15. 
---
Pretty good fun times!
---
Yeah 
---
True , but the DC are getting crazy now a days 
---
. The most BS thing is the DCs get listened to
---
Out of the 3, Plague is the best choice. She is the strongest of the bunch, synergizes well with perks like Thanatanophobia, and also has the perk Corrupt Intervention which is very good at buying time. Legion isn't good and perks are really mediocre, but they're a personal favorite of mine. I enjoy the rush down playstyle although it isn't very effective. Clown is really boring, has a mediocre and uneventful power, and only has the good Perk of Pop Goes the Weasel which you already have. So either Plague or Legion is what I would recommend.
---
Sounds to me like you need to get better 🤷‍♀️
---
No tunnels or camps from me still results in 4ks
---
NOED is just a crutch that prevents some people from getting good enough not to need it anyway
---
I mostly play survivor and have killers DC frequently when they find a survivor that can loop well. It's frustrating too. =/
---
Imagine they very game the killer DCs and survives depip because thats what happens in killers side 3 people dc and one just takes hatch and boom DEpip
---
I'm gonna weight in here. I love DBD, I've been playing since release and almost through it all I've done nothing but play Killer. I don't enjoy survivor, unless my friends really wanna play. Even then, I get frustrated quickly.
---
DS has been gut, Med kits have been gut, loops have been gut, exhaustion perks are abysmal, hitboxes are literally a mile long and lag always favours the killer.
---
So please stop with the Killers have it bad. I've been a killer main for over 1100 hours on PC, and now I'm on Console for 2 weeks and I've been r1 every season almost uncontested.
---
Killer is braindead, and easy. I play Killer solely because Survivor is not fun. Tunneling, is prevalent and lame. Slugging, incredibly frustrating. Every killer perk, ruin, whispers, enduring, etc just makes the killer better at their objective. Survivors Objectives are loop, protect, survive. Almost every survivor perk is counter intuitive or has a killer perk that beats it. WGLF? Terrible, gives you nothing. BBQ and chili? Points for playing the game, and aura reading which is nutty strong on everyone.  The list goes on of perks like this. Ruin is the most notorious for dragging the game on.
---
Killer keeps getting easier and easier, and playing survivor the 4 to 1 aspect is the most dry gameplay. If I wanted to watch the same 3 second loop of getting dragged to the sky, I'd turn on a gif. I won't play survivor unless I have a daily to level up killers.
---
Killers are fun, literally because survivors are terrible to play with a less than 33% winrate (look it up). It's not fun to be a survivor. Period.
---
The matchmaking is SUPPOSED to be +/-6 ranks.
---
Just the fact a good Clown player is good doesn't mean people are gonna say "ah ok" and they'll become machine gun killers afterwise. It doesn't improve people just bc you flex your main killer :/
---
I played a match as Dwight, did gens, safe unhooks, totems,  etc., and post game someone accused me of hiding in a locker all match as an “immersed Dwight” because I’d brought a medkit with me.
---
Love it!
---
Always had
---
A lot of killers do lol. Average green rank game killer disconnects
---
Literallt watch any Otz video. He doesn'y usually run Ruin.
---
Thank you so much! &lt;3 I'm glad you like the pack :)
---
I like the downvotes, while this comment is lowkey toxic you aren't wrong tbh.
---
Hmm, this scenario seems oddly familiar. 
---
When was this game?
---
Single, huh? Are they cute?
---
Its probably the most effort i have put into a project to make it intentionally messy looking.
---
I start to hate the game and myself when that happens too often, but ironically it tends to get boring when you're doing well for a few games in a row.
---
Why are we still here??
---
I only DC if it's laggy as fuck (Console)
---
I mean, why should I bother if all I'm doing is rubber-banding? It's not fun for me, I'm gonna get into some BULLSHIT situations and tbf... It fucks with my eyes.
---
I think the primary complaint I would make to your argument is that most of the player base including even low rank killer mains are not streamers. A streamer can take a non optimal build and a weak killer and do very well because they are playing the game at a level most of us are never going to reach. It’s the same in games like Overwatch, the meta for them and what they can make work is out of reach for the non pro player base. So trying to balance the game for the top top tier of players is probably not the way to go.
---
I'm just impressed at the rate this image has been diminishing due how many times it's been created&gt;compressed&gt;copied&gt;compressed...
---
Sounds good as one of the final challenges in the Level 4 Archives were "Do 4 gens by yourself"
---
Thanks for your suggestion!
---
I'm curious about Corrupt Intervention. I know a lot of people like to use it as a sort of Ruin replacement, but I'm struggling to see its strength. I guess it's just one of those things that I'd have to use for myself to really appreciate.
---
I'm probably going to get Plague anyways, but I was mostly just curious if Legion is still as annoying to play against as the memes always implied. Sounds like he's too weak to be annoying now, though
---
It seemed like Spirit became an issue when they finally fixed the sound issues the game had.  Killers couldn't hear survivors very well so when she was phasing it was more difficult to track where they were running.  Survivors got used to versing her while she was in a bad state.
---
I never understood why anyone would disconnect putside of internet connection issues. Even if I have a terrible game I just take the loss, accept it and move on. If i'm a killer clearly having a bad game, i've actually seen survivors at the exit gates who will stop, kneal and drop their item in front of me as a sign of respect which is pretty cool.
---
Translation pls
---
Rude
---
No. They don't.
---
Or maybe force them to spectate the entire match? I thought about that too, but honestly I'm not that hard up against people who DC. Sometimes you gotta poop, sometimes you gotta go, and sometimes you just don't want to play anymore and that's ok too.
---
Just break it. 60 seconds of Haunted Grounds is easier to deal with than a Devour Hope totem.
---
I don’t bad manner as a killer unless it was done to me first by the survivor.
---
Demogorgon or pig, it’s pretty challenging to use pig effectively because of the egc and demogorgon is just fun in general because of the portals and the lung attack it has
---
Well the fact that you’re not aware of this shows that there’s no point in arguing with you since you’re not informed enough to form an opinion that actually matters.
---
Have a nice day
---
Exactly. Killer mains don't play killer... So How can they assume all killer mains don't DC. Some are petty as fuck.
---
I main pig and have never used ruin. I never leave a game without at least a 3k. Ruin is not required imo
---
Ah, so *that's* what I look like to Killers
---
I like Pig the best of those 4. Demo's perks are meh but I haven't played him so idk how fun he is as a killer. Pig is a ton of fun especially on small maps, and there's a couple fun, unique builds you can run with her.
---
Kate is an artist too
---
The match loaded in, the game ended instantly because a player did not load in
---
I didn’t say anything about improving people, just that ruin is not a necessity. If people want to/feel like they have to run it to do well then they can, but at the highest level of play it’s just an optional perk
---
Plague hate is only on the rise if you acknowledge it. If we ignore it long enough it might go away.
---
Abso-fucking-lutely.
---
It's not a waste to run anti-totem perks when every killer runs a hex perk. Which they do.
---
I don't need to look for totems when I have Detectives Hunch. :) I can usually hit the skillchecks, so I power through ruin, see 2 or 3 totems, do them, then go back to a gen. If I didn't find ruin with those totems, someone else probably did. If they didn't, I will in the next 2 gens, guaranteed.
---
 I really think they should make that a permanent change. Keep it as the default view when selecting the killer. then if you want to change your parts it will move to the full body view.
---
does this pack include all emblems or just the ones shown in this post
---
I honestly think ruin should be a baseline thing in the game, and not a perk.
---
Agree to disagree. Ghostface maintains his insane stealth while still having the one shot and can activate it at any time. You don’t have to  waste nearly as long in chases to activate the power.
---
Nah they good im just really unlucky
---
No one likes the truth.
---
I'm not trying to be toxic, I just don't do the "Surv/Killer" is OP shit.
---
If killers only do *one* build (usually the all-seeing build) and don't get why it's so easy to counter, it's their own damn fault. Everyone plays BBQ + NC + Ruin + "Optional" and all the survivors have to figure out is what the last perk is (if it's even dangerous). 
---
Just try to be a bit unpredictable. It doesn't take much
---
Well, I see what you're saying, but they did still win. Their victory was 75% to your 25%, the fact that they're angry about the way you played doesn't mean they lost.
---
Ran into this Kate once. She  was toxic to the max flashlight clicking and teabagging at every opportunity even when i wasn't chasing her. This ego led to her getting way too cocky and I hit her in the EGC. In the post game chat she asked why I didn't give her the hatch, as if I was required to do it. I replied that it was my objective to kill her. Her response: "well my objective is to report you for unsporting behavior" literally found that hilarious. Guy probably does that to others, reporting them because they didn't give hatch, pathetic. (DS, balenced landing and purple flashlight BTW)
---
What is that? Just waiting at a pallet to bring it down? People complain about that now too?
---
It’s just like with Myers. When tier 3 pops, you hide. If you don’t want to deal with corrupt purge, don’t cleanse. That’s your choice. There is counter play, adapt and quit bitching
---

The counter play with Plague is not to cleanse and, if someone does cleanse, to stay away from the bloody fountain until it's used, at which point you stay away from the Plague. Take advantage of the fact her vomit is a projectile and stay healthy as long as possible.
---
Nah, that’s just the new Doctor nerf.
---
What if survivors had to go around the map and make a generator to later fully repair it? Lets say a part of the generator is missing and the survivor had to find that part which is in a randomly generated place every time, might be in the basement, might be next to a pallet, who knows. And they'd have to bring it to the gen and boom, now you can repair it.
---
I’m starting to think Legion is a very lethal killer with the right perks. Anytime I run into that is using thanatophobia, sloppy butcher, ruin, and/or pop, the game just stalls so long that eventually she gets kills.
---
I mean imagine activating second wind with no mither
---
You have to agree that "I'll face camp until someone shows up for the save so I can't either Tunnel the unhooked or kill the one that saved and keep cycling survivors" killers and "I'll crouch to the nearest corner and wait for everyone die so I can get the hatch... Also, what are these weird turned off machines I see everywhere on the map?" survivors are the worst
---
Am I not informed enough about SWFs? Or am I not informed enough about the "magical Reddit red rank 1 SWFs" that always bring multiple rainbow maps, instablind flashlights that haven't existed for atleast a year, and 4 toolboxes simultaneously? Which SWFs are you talking about?
---
I try my best. I know what to do by now but there are times people get chased and bring the killer to me and I get destroyed minding my business lol 
---
I never cleanse bc i am decent at looping but others are out of my control sadly 😕
---
Thats actually a thing survivors deliberately do to try to annoy killers if all else fails, wear matching outfits and accuse of tunneling
---
I think this is untrue, it’s not skewed towards survivor or killer, just selfish people that happen to play the game.
---
This is not every match work . It is important to get a fast down to stop that. Increasing gen repairing time is boring. But not every match you have a team who sit down on gens all the time.
---
My experience is the following:
---
1. Get
---
2. Bent
---
3. If your argument is simply that I'm wrong because you're right, you're not going to have many intelligent conversations on this topic. You're not the final word on what does and doesn't count as relevant experience or who does and doesn't get to have an opinion.
---
Based on those listed credentials, I think spirit is perfectly balanced. It sounds like you're throwing a temper tantrum because the strategy that works on all the other killers doesn't work on this one and you don't know how to adapt to new challenges.
---
*laughs in 5 blink Nurse being deleted*
---
It's always Trappers and Huntresses in my experience. No idea why, but if I load into a game and it's a Trapper or a Huntress I already know everyone's gonna get camped on first hook. Green ranks on PS4 btw.
---
Ok dude cool
---
it's all i do. i run WGLF and play 100% support
---
Bro Chill the fuck out. Seems like you have been waiting to scream that comment for days. What?
---
Don’t tell me. Tell the others that cleanse. 
---
And also I feel like your tiny brain forgets that Plague can HEAR you vomitting and that you leave residue every where you go lol
---
Another objective should fix this. But not increasing gens repair time.
---
Im not low rank killer but most of time run NOED because those tee bagging assholes who think they are 2 hit get what they deserve. Last night i got 2 sacrifices and they opened the door one left immediatly and one stayed and tee bagged in front of the door and got one slapped
---
That’s kinda funny because those are the killers that get the very least out of camping. Both of them have some of the strongest abilities to influence the game at a distance so why anyone would want to camp with them instead seems really odd.
---
So it's the second one then? You should know that believing in fairy tales is bad for your mental health.
---
i think people who get 2 full outfits are nuts, especially a weapon piece since they're so small, but heads are small too. if i were you i would get nothing but killer bodies. i'll soon have collected them all just from serums. you get some extra after that, and i'm gonna spend my extra on clown's head since it's unique
---
Balancing a game at low level play just doesn’t work. Take League of Legends for example. Champs that are overpowered in low ranks like Master Yi are barely picked at high ranks, and high skill cap but very meta champs like Lee Sin are very prevalent at high ranks but are either not picked or misused in low ranks. The problem is that if you decide to balance the game around those low ranks and buff champs like Lee Sin because they have a low win rate in Silver and below, then he’ll run rampant in high ranks and be pick or ban because those players actually know how to play him. It’s the same concept here, and for most competitive multiplayer games. If you increase the amount of time it takes to complete a gen, then the game will be much easier for low rank killers, but at the highest level of play it will be hell for survivors who are playing against killers who didn’t need slower gen speed in the first place. You have to balance around high rank, or those players are going to have a very bad time
---
More gens would definitely be a bad time adding another should be game changing and more fun. Like fuse for the exit gate or something
---
People on this sub will tell you there is counterplay to Tombstone Myers, but at rank 20 I think this argument is lost on the survivors. Tombstone can just get run over by rank 1s who know how to play optimally, but rank 20s take too long and are indecisive (they’re just new to the game), and get killed.
---
I’ve been in 2-3 matches with friends I’m showing the game and they get killed by Tombstone and it’s hard justifying it at that level.
---
I mean that's actually helpful for killers, if the survivor kept running, or looped, or bought time another way then the pallet would still be in play. If you camp a pallet around me then I say slam that shit down, one less pallet in the match and you'll still get hit anyway.
---
Dude you’re getting pissed off and I don’t even really care about the argument. If it makes you feel better you won the argument. 100.%
---
Move on. Who gives a shit?
---
So the prayer beads spirit that i faced yesterday where everyone escaped was actually a cat, that explains a lot.
---
~~it was in console, tho.~~
---
Same for me as well. Red rank surv and killer. Have instant killer matches and LOOOOONG wait time on survivor.
---
They know he actually has eyes, they just didn't know the developers actually modeled him with eyes.
---
That meme is made in school, if there is any better and free software I'll happily download
---
fuse for the exit gate?
---
Exactly, it's so mind-boggling to me. The Huntress that camped me on first hook last night was even running Rancor, and I was the obsession. ***?????????????***
---
There's an offering on the killer side called a Mori that lets the killer kill a survivor without having to hook them. There's a unique animation for each killer, and for Ghostface, he stabs you a few times then takes a selfie with you.
---
I main Freddy and I am using Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Thrilling Tremors and BBQ right now I think. 
---
I tried playing a few games without ruin and it was just too fucking hard at my rank. Gens were popping all over the place in the first few minutes of the game.
---
In that time half of the pallets on the map were dropped.
---
This sounds like an issue with solo queue in general and less an issue with Plague in particular.
---
I stay up when i stay up an hour late bc i have to wake up at 5 anyways
---
You must if you are still replying. Killers take this victim card shit too far.
---
Should only be wearing one slipper with the other as the weapon
---
In fear of my life, I am. Kill you with napalm, I must.
---
Exactly! Half the time you can swing through and get a hit anyway. What's next window camping?
---
Disconnecting is a natural thing to do. I always find liberty in disconnecting when a game doesn't go my way or even when the killer is someone I am not fond of.
---
I notice it lags a lot for no reason in killer matches too. My connection is crisp and you can tell when survivors are lagging. The weird thing is they say if you lag to much it will disconnect the match and that doesnt happen. I havent tried since the new update yesterday though so I will see what's going on today.
---
Alright dude. You got me. 
---
Since obviously you can’t move on I’ll just block you. Just know that I’m super embarrassed because you won the argument. Oh man, how will I ever recover?
---
I get what you're saying, but like the original post said it's simple math that if the survivors just M1 gens like they're supposed to then the killer has to find+down a survivor about once every minute or less.
---
A survivor doesn't have to be that good to ensure that happens in a lot of situations, even against a perfectly played mid-tier killer.
---
And let's be honest. The majority of them **aren't** perkless or itemless. The perks and items just make it worse. Survivors don't need second chances or comms but BHVR has allowed them 4th and 5th chances and SWF, and good survivors abuse them.
---
So really we agree, right? Survivors don't need all that shit and yet they abuse it to bully people lol.
---
I literally call the DBD role on my little disc server „Lobby sim enthusiasts“
---
Use,  Scott Jund spoke about it before the endgame collapse patch. That before being able to power the exit gate you need to find number of fuse for the exit gate.
---
I'm a red rank survivor who plays with one other person and tbh I don't see it.
---
We get 4k'd probably 80% of games, and one of us die in 90% of them.
---
The problem is that it's *very* easy for a killer to apply pressure against 2/2 or 2/1/1 grouped survivors. All they have to do is hook one person. Say they hook another person I'm not playing with, one of us will decide to go get him, but then the other guy decides to get him. Now we only have one gen being worked on. That's a big deal we literally halved our production compared to a 4 stack SWF group.
---
Add on to the fact that killers have been exploiting it recently, they can see how people join the game and know it's 2/2 or 2/1/1, and will camp the hook way more than they normally would because they're aware of the fact that there are probably multiple people coming to save them.
---
And to add on to it, as a killer, to get to red ranks, you have to be *really* good. There's no bullshitting it to get there. As a survivor it is very easy to bullshit your way to high ranks, and very easy to get screwed while playing well and not pip or rank up at all.
---
I had a game the other day where I was literally all over the map, unhooking, popping gens, cleansed the hex, I was everywhere and carried the fuck out of us to 4 people surviving, one of the best games I've ever had.
---
But I only saw the killer once because I bided my time when unhooking, and played very stealthily and smart, so I got bronze in the evading category(EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS THAT EVADING THE KILLER IS PART OF THE FUCKING SCORE). I went iridescent gold iridescent bronze, and I didn't pip. In my best game ever by far.
---
Why is it always a contest lmao
---
in the entitty’s realm, we are
---
Napalm, there is not
---
but reality, I can alternate 
---
back with an M249, I will be
---
wait, you must
---
Corrupt is more reliable as it guarantees 3 gens are protected for 2 minutes and its usually the ones where survivors spawn. Ruin can be great, but if it gets found instantly it does virtually nothing and is just a wasted perk slot. People also say Legion is "annoying" to play against, when it's just a quick button press. Annoying a survivor doesn't enjoy or wastes their time is viewed as "annoying" so I'd take it with a grain of salt. Play what you like, not what a survivor likes.
---
Cause Billy can run across the Map, Trapper has to go find his traps (without add on) and then find a spot to put it. Billy by Default has a lot of map pressure with a one shot so stuff like ruin aren't needed
---
This. A lot of balancing with this game is based on SWF. Kind of like how games like LoL are balanced around proc play.
---
TBH rancor kinda makes sense as you usually run it for the gen reveal part, not the expose/kill, but camping your rancor seems stupid if the kill is practically guaranteed come endgame anyways?
---
Actually I do. You get a free heal everytime you cleanse. The killer has to waste their time walking across the map to activate corrupt purge, giving you time to distance yourself. Even in a chase with corrupt purge, you still have to be hit twice to go down. They have to sacrifice speed and charge up vomit during a chase, giving you time to get to cover. She’s B-tier for a reason.
---
*Gives him a way to walk away from the argument*
---
"Now I gotta block you! I can't handle someone challenging my ideas!"
---
I’m not saying you should balance the game for the lowest level of play, I just do not think you can balance it for the very highest level of play who are playing at a professional level and know the game so well they can make it do stuff the majority of the player base can’t make it do even at top tier ranks.
---
there are all the "items " Addons " Perks "Powers"StatusEffects"StoreTabs"Actions"Archive"DailyRituals"Favors and HelpLoading :)
---
Ah, the pain of living in lower ranks.
---
It’s not a contest. There’s a lot of bullshit on both sides. It just bothers that the people who complain about how unfair Spirit is never complain about this stuff. It’s very hypocritical imo
---
Game balancing sir. Game should be balanced for everyone. Thats why I think Killers should get separate buffs against 3-4 man SWFs. Its unfair for a killer to deal with powerful SWF since killers are inherently weaker than survivors with complete teams.
---
Regular buffs should remain for killers but better ones should be given to killers when they go against 3-4 man teams imo
---
And also, if Plague’s corrupt vomit was be limited to a smaller degree to spray, it would be fine. But Plagues spray that shit like when I try killing cockroaches with bug sprays, eliminating any chance of counter play such as hiding or looping opportunities.
---
I've been running a totem/vision build lately with Thrill, Haunted Grounds, Ruin, and Discordance. It sounds janky as fuck, but it actually works pretty well. Thrill and Haunted usually protect Ruin, I can usually get 1-2 downs from Haunted, Thrill gives me additional visibility, and Disco tells me where I'll get value on Feral Frenzy. From there, I just tag them and follow the heartbeats and then *crazy arm motions* 4k. So. I dunno. 
---
Im usually in High Green ranks as a killer, so I'm facing survivors between yellow and purple. I thought it was a survivor skill thing at first, but I dunno.
---
^
---
Anti-heal and slowdown builds are must haves on Legion if you actually want to win
---
i think you misunderstand what i was trying to say, i agree with you, it is perfectly okay with developers making a game optimal for the controls or device they want, and as a such is less optimal on everything else.
---
goddamn caleb
---
If you think no one complains about SWF or infinites, I don't know what to tell you.
---
that's awesome, I'll add it the moment I get home! keeping the simplistic design of each but adding a different flair, looks great
---
Another plus. You get the same reaction anyway. Without warning: "oh come on he has noed"
---
With warning: "oh come on he has noed"
---
i cannot imagine anyone using windows store but okay update?
---
In my first ever game a smurf said I tunnelled his newbie friend but three people were on third hook, she was just the first on the chopping block.
---
Plague is op
---
What about a tracker that notes how much someone has DC'd recently and the game will apply more and more punishment the more they DC. This would only punish salty players who DC anytime they get remotely close to losing.
---
Dude calm down. Everyone gets so pissed off nowadays over stupid shit. You’re both dumb. There
---
Ok brother
---
Thank you :3
---
Yes? Both sides complain about all the bullshit in this game all the time.
---
I doubt that would even be meta. It would just be a fun combo.
---
Different ranks would be playing different games
---
If this is supposed to be a slasher horror simulator then 2 people at most would always survive.
---
I play on console and with the amount of people I get in other games who are listening to loud shitty music in the background, I doubt world chat would work in favor of survivors. Especially for stealth killers like Ghost Face. 😂
---
I'm completely calm right now. I don't know why everyone's first thought is that someone is mad if they argue.
---
I really suggest plague, with the mechanic of "Damned if you do, Damned if you dont" it makes games very different depending on what the survivors do, keeps things interesting
---
Omg I’m gonna love being chased by that clown look. Too bad most people playing killers stick to their original look.
---
There is no ranking system in the ptb so you could get a super sweaty rank 1  killer and rank 20 teammates. Super rng based if you get a fair lobby or not.
---
That's not hit boxes. If it was it would work that way every time. It has to do with the server and lag.
---
Also they do take 80 seconds, go time one
---
Thanks again for the input!
---
Maybe it's just me but like 1 in 5 survivors DC in the yellow to green ranks and 1 in 10 in the purple and red ranks. It's so common that punishing it seems silly, because then we just lose a large portion of potential players who will probably stop DC'ing when their just helping the person they are trying to hinder.
---
Thats how it is balanced. Devs have said 2 escape and 2 death is a tied game
---
Even though I'm a Plague main, I've got to say go with Pig. It's been a while since I've played as the Pig but I do remember having a lot of fun playing as her. As it felt different to the other killers I was playing at the time
---
I don't notice much lag when playing as killer at all just the fps drops make it feel really choppy. Yeah it has disconnected me but very rarely tbh, it's mostly ok but recently it's lagging at important moments e.g " Get hit by clown's gas, lags and then I get hit
---
since when did claudette get a ballerina cosmetic
---
What about breastfeeding?
---
But it is their fault that they played badly. Even worse when NOED is only used to camp the unfortunate guy who got caught first.
---
Um what is dooting the snoot on DBD lol
---
Yeah it gets better at higher ranks, but in my experience the yellow and green rank killers are tryhard fucking garbage that take their real life frustrations out on people and never rank up because they do shit like this.
---
killer hearing them would ruin the game. not only could survivors near you scream (or speak too loudly) and give your location away, but survivors could also play in game sound cues into their mic to confuse people.
---
Clown on The Game is dirty, but that's with all killers. The Game is small enough to use Pop well, and Coulrophobia will slow healing across both floors. Bamboozle won't get much use, but it's not great anyway. Using an ivory mori early might help you get ahead but will take some hook points for your emblems.
---
Your best shot at addons are the instadowns with extra bottles or reload if you can land them well. The most consistent addons are Bleach and the purple Ether bottle.
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah. Then maybe there would be a point to the ranking system
---
that could be cool, Maybe 3-4 gens on the map are special and need fuses? that way you would need to do 1-2 gens with fuses by the end to win
---
No one ever uses NOED in red ranks unless they use an endgame build. The totems are always cleansed especially since the Stranger Things chapter.
---
To take from other online multiplayer games, what about a proximity based ping wheel of some sort that would clue in other survivors to what you are asking of them? Like a ping that others could hear/see so long as you’re within range that you get the “Reunited” point bonus?
---
Recently got called out for “abusing” ruin. Continued to talk with the person and he said all killers cheat and they ruin the game for survivors. Still don’t get his logic but what does a filthy killer main know
---
Is this an actual phrase for passing blunts? Are people aware that boofing is taking drugs up the booty hole?
---
If you sit there without getting off of it, don't miss a skill check, etc, sure. But the reality is that's not what happens 99% of the time.
---
omfg can people like you shut up about hitboxes saying they are bad.
---
ITS LATENCY NOT HITBOXES
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide\_hitbox/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
Yeah, but they don’t get fixed as soon as killers do. Swf, OoO, and Infinites have been on the game for a long and OoO just barely got a slight nerf.
---
Best drawing I've seen on this subreddit
---
Oh well it’s been around for months now
---
Can the bonus for killer quiting be higher than a survivor seeing as when the killer quits the game just ends
---
Playing solo, Bond or Empathy is almost necessary. It saves me so much time knowing when to save and when to sit on gens.
---
It was mainly for the exit gate but yeah that would be an amazing idea too. As long we have a secondary options so the game can be fun for both side.
---
Noob noed
---
Green ranks are definantly where people DC the most. People there play enough to want to DC but not enough to know how to take a loss
---
"Zet0r viewers also watch this channel"

they arent a zet0r fan if they watch someone like cuntido

I almost dced last against a ghostface because he scared me so badly in the beginning and I was so not in the mood for the game to be actually scary.
---
Actually mr.worldwide is a giant terror radius doctor. But your close
---
Well they kinda fucked up with his power this killer need a complete rework but to what ??
---
you are misunderstanding, its the people who screech "SPIRIT BAD NO FAR HUR DE DUR" are the same poeple saying that all of those are perfectly fine and need no changes  
---
also not saying everyone who hates on spirit is like that, there are some legitimate complaints about spirit
---
He morid the poor man :(. I have a rank 19 friend with around 30 minutes of play time and I bring the poor guy into red rank lobbies. I try my best to run the kills around and he is my gen jockey
---
In regards to plague you can do corrupt, bbq,enduring,spirit fury to help with the bullying and slow speed.
---
I think there's a design philosophy they have re: map balance where they aim to balance the maps for the lowest common denominator survivor, which is why they won't address the things you mentioned. The survivors they balance for won't know how to abuse them
---
Now that we have dedicated servers; I say just let disconnected players have their character remain in game.
---
Disconnected survivors: Stand there, do nothing and will eventually spawn AFK crows with warnings to killer. Still reward some compensation to other survs.
---
Disconnected killer: stands there. Survs have an easy time farming gens, items and bold BP
---
For the best. You should blast music when playing a game that relies on sound
---
Spirit said : U-A A-U WAAAH
---
Can I suggest you Blood Warden too ? Let’s create the anti tbag squad ! :D
---
It’s 2019 dude we been boofing, ur stuck in the past.
---
Yep. Unless they add something in mechanics, a mimic for players/inanimate objects would be a pretty challenging thing to balance.
---
I bought the game during the recent sale, and I'm currently killer tank 18.
---
Last trial I got matched with 4 rank 4-6 camoclaudettes with flashlights who gen rushed, T-bagged, and pointed.
---
I face camped one of them, and the rest trash talked me in the post game chat for it.

Low rank killer isn't very fun so far :(

Just get the option of push to talk and muting people.

but what about bamboozle?
---
thanks, stranger things dlc
---
Was running discordance, nurses, butcher and thantaphobia last night. It's ridiculous for map info along with frenzy. Difficult for a team of survivors to make headway, at least in green ranks.
---
I'll have to try your build out!
---
It wasn't just survivors complaining. Killers complained because they weren't getting real games since survivors would just suck the flowers and then off themselves on hook.
---
PTB is the Public Test Build. It's where they test things before they go on the live servers. i'm assuming you mean the archive challenges, which have been out for about 2 weeks so yeah people probably arent doing their challenges anymore
---
There is no adapting to spirit, because you can't tell what she's doing. That's the whole problem lmao. Also, I'm not saying you're wrong because I'm right, I'm saying you're wrong because you said you've played 3 games against her, at most likely rank 15. And no, I'm not the final word, but plenty of people with more time in this game on both sides agree, watch Scott or Tofu's vidoes on spirit. It's not a matter of her being op, she's not, she's just frustrating af to play against because there is NO counterplay when you can't see what the killer is fucking doing. Stop getting all pissy and complaining about me when you can't even seem to ingest the slightest difference in opinion despite a massive gap in experience.
---
There was no like "fan art" or "misc" tag so i didnt want to use ones like "screenshot" or "news".

I heard the event screwed people over so much. Most people would just collect the serum and kill themselves on hook

you can force thid by pressing f1 when offerings are being turned. This causes you to not load into the matxh and allows you to dodge moris I found out.

I swear I was going against 3 clauds that accused me of tunneling. They were pissed off but luckily the meg was defending me and saying I was a good killer

---
Ikr i want to pet it.
---
push to talk wouldnt solve anything I just mentioned, neither would muting people. 
---
muting would mean rather youd have to stop what youre doing to mute a teammate (who the killer would still hear), or the killer would have to stop what he's doing to mute someone who's messing with him.
---
Of course they do.
---
You can't tunnel.
---
You can't change targets.
---
You are supposed to stand there watch the grass grow.
---
Gotcha, although I think it would be more fun to swap either corrupt or BBQ with Bamboozle in order to shut down everything in a chase. I'm not necessarily looking for an anti-bullying build (I have a few other characters for when I want to actually try to do well), I'm just looking for something to make it less fun for the SWF. Doesn't have to make me better, just make their game worse
---
fellow legion mains rise
---
I personally have no fun playing against spirit because it’s a guessing game. I don’t outplay a spirit, I get lucky so no escape is earned and no death is preventable. Iron will isn’t a counter if the spirit runs stridor (as many do) and spine chill doesn’t help in chase at all. If you enjoy spirit then so be it, just understand that you’re part of the minority that’s going to be upset when she eventually gets tweaked
---

And let us not forget how console has

-lower sensitivity
---
-shitty frames
---
-unchangable graphics settings (pc players having an innate advantage with low settings and some going as far as to fuck with their graphics cards to basically get night vision)
---
I'm all for crossplay... but for the love of god make it optional so if I'm on console solo queuing as survivor or killer I only go against console players
---
Hi yes hey I’m up here in red ranks and ur wrong. Noed isn’t used EVERY game. But it’s common enough. 
---
Also, playing killer is way way way harder than playing survivor. Play any non-Spirit killer vs red ranks and tell me how many gens they get done before your first hit. You can even bring Ruin and all the slowdown perks you want. 
---
Also “if you need free downs bc you failed to protect the gens you’re a bad killer”. 
---
If you need free heals bc you can’t avoid getting hit by the killer ur a bad survivor and cannot day you deserve red rank. There. You now have an argument against Adrenaline. Everything you wanna say about NOED applies to Adrenaline with the exception of counterplay, where Noed has counterplay and Adrenaljnes is just “kill them before endgame”, which is already ur job.
---
They're not going to remove the ability to play with your friends, that would be foolish. As for the other two, Idk if there's anything to be fixed. And even so, they just removed instaheals and gave BT a slight counter, so it'll be a little while.
---
You should look at the infinites that were in the game when it first came out. It's a wonder the game didn't die out immediately.
---
Anyone hear that I sure didn’t
---
I kinda second this, but it doesn't hold a candle to a lot of other perks. One important downside to it is that survivors can anticipate it and play around it, but that doesn't make it bad in any stretch. If I already have Pop though, it's not necessarily worth a whole 9K shards
---
&gt; I played against Zubat’s Hillbilly once and he never runs ruin on Billy. He still got a 3k and I only barely managed to pip as third one dead, and if he was on his nurse then he probably would’ve 4k’d because his nurse is insane
---
ok what about normal killers that aren't triple S tier?
---
Hm? I somehow find games within a minute or two
---
Billy is not being reworked. He's getting updated addons to fit the mold of what every killer set is.
---
Why stop at survivors maybe the doctor could accidentally shock himself or the hag could start playing in the dirt
---
oh hey! I murdered you as a wraith the other week!
---
That's not what people mean by more objectives. They mean more objectives that contribute to winning / escaping. Not personal boosts to bloodpoints thatean your teammates are jerking off while you try to escape.
---
I think what is being said is that for the average person playing killer (average being the keyword), ruin is a necessity. There’s always gonna be  high rank/top tier players that don’t need to run it because they’re just that good, but that isn’t a good representation of the overall player base. With all online multiplayer PvP games, a decision has to be made whether to make changes to the game to benefit top tier/competitive or to benefit the average player. As there isn’t a competitive mode for this game, they have to prioritize the average player.
---
Rank and survivor or killer?
---
That’s exactly what they said about Nurse. That they were only reworking her addons
---
Bitch wtf no
---
Overcharge depends on if survivors are bad or not. Surge does not.
---
Oh goddamnit
---
rlly? are u the one that sat me by hatch and closed it right infront of me or the one that i had a lit game as
---
Yeah that's fair, I guess.
---
Sure its an optional perk if you've got literal thousands of hours in the game
---
I’ve had Bhvr devs tell me they don’t respect killers who run slow down perks like Thana or Ruin. It’s not needed, they claim. Meanwhile, he can barely get past rank 10.
---
I’ve seen games where 4 gens are done is just over 2 minutes. Slow down is absolutely required.
---
And considering these devs (if you can even call them that at this point) can’t even figure out why Spirit suddenly took over red ranks after the Nurse nerf without chalking it up to “oh she must be OP too”, I can’t say I’d trust the devs to balance a disguise killer
---
those both sound like me, I just recognize your name though lol
---
That will make a whole lot of people quit the game
---
Thanataphobia is a must for legion. Getting multiple injures is easy with frenzy. Even better if you bring sloppy butcher as well.
---
It literally does nothing but reduce your terror radius to 0 and give the Obsession a standard 32 metre terror radius for the duration.
---
Lol I was about to say that was me because one of my first few rounds of spirit was like that then I realized that was a week ago
---
I run colorphobia, thanatophobia, sloppy, and nurse's calling and everyone loathes me lol. Nobody wants to be a one hit down so everyone still tries desperately to heal. As long as you keep your TR within the range of the gens they want to do they'll leave them. No ruin needed.
---
I never run ruin I do amazing without it
---
And yet killers still have average kill rates *starting* at some 60% (i. e. the weakest killer characters still sacrifice noticably more survivors than they have escape). Even in the oh-so-competitive red ranks. The game is currently killer-sided, statistically.
---
In actual competitive gameplay, like a tournament setting, yes, gens can get done too fast for killers outside of Nurse and Spirit to consistently be able to 4k. But the other killers can still 4k there too. And in public play, a good player will 3-4k with any killer character in the majority of their games.
---
That is to say, the gen timers are more than balanced if you look at the vast majority of matches. But I do agree that Ruin skews things. Ruin takes a perk slot of killers and that is an issue. My suggestion is to randomize gen spawns more, and to remove the headlights from them - that way survivors will consistently spend significantly more time locating gens to work on in the first place. Ruin can then be nerfed, such as removed the 3-second cooldown upon hitting a good skill check under its effect.
---
Phi Phi too!
---
I’m not saying remove swf. I’m saying they should nerf it somehow. Not in a big way. Just a small way to buy the killer some time. I understand most people that play swf are doing it casually, but it can get pretty frustrating when you are playing killer casually.
---
8% regression on a down (which is similar to Pop's 25% activation requirement) in an area. If you get a down and arent near a gen then tough luck you get no regression. If you get a down in an area with only 1 gen around then tough luck you only get one 8% regression. It's only good in Three-Gen setups where the survivors are splitting their efforts among two gens, which even still requires you to actually get a down near those gens. Any survivor worth their salt will run you as far away from those generators as possible. Out of all the gen slowdown perks Surge is one of the worse ones.
---
AND it's on a cooldown.
---
Should be full 100% for the remaining survivors imho
---
I remember getting salty when playing a campy wraith that was on farms and remember playing against a wraith on that map with the woods and a factory in the middle where i juked u then u threw me on a hook and did the same to my lil bro huntsman
---
I get that that answers most of what I'm asking here, but does that still pause RBT and Deep Wound timers? Further, can this standard TR be heard normally by sleeping survivors (which would be weird), or does it still sound like a lullaby?
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dtk8mz/the/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
You're not supposed to be using perks during the experiment though. It's a vanilla loadout only for both killers and survivors
---
You're saying the same things you already said above and still leaning on that experience gap as the reason you're right and I'm wrong zzzzzzzzzz
---
Then stop playing spirit
---
Ah, my bad. I misunderstood that part of your comment.
---
But can't you get banned for using this?
---
second one sounds more like the game I had with you lol
---
Then they should fix their net code too if they can't differentiate between a server side error and a client ghosting. Fix the fucking game. Punish disconnects.
---
I think it's a little bland and also a little BP does nothing, I think it should be a % of currently earned BP like an offering because a solid state amount is hard to balance between too much and too little. Right now it's way the fuck too little for both sides.
---
good lol u should add me then
---
Fuck your pussy lol
---
Hitboxes aren’t the problem, those could be fixed instantly.  It’s latency from the servers and how they get Down syndrome from trying to process kicking a pallet or gen.
---
ALWAYS wait at the hole until the heartbeat goes away
---
no. BHVR(creators of dead by daylight) won't go out of their way to ban you form using them, while EAC (easy anti-cheat) can ban you, if their anti-cheat get's triggered. That is why we recommend you only change the PNG files and nothing else. But rest assured, as of the moment there is no reports of getting banned for changing the icons.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion even if It's wrong. Youre putting up scenarios that rarely ever happen, but sure. Surge is just trash lmao.
---
yeah I don't camp people, and if I do, it's because I can hear someone close by (usually a Claudette).
---
I find it fun to purposefully close application before the match starts.
---
I once saved another survivor of from a hook in front of an open gate. We then ran out the exit gates together.
---
In post game chat he called me all kinds of bad names for being stupid and newb and not knowing how to play.
---
Uh, I just saved you. You're welcome?
---
Rank 4 Killer as Pig w/o Ruin
---
I agree with the sentiment of this post, Gens RN are ridiculously quick just at base if the survivors aren't fucking around.
---
But Low-rank killers usually run NOED because its the best option, not because gens pop too quickly (They don't at low ranks). Face-camping happens at low ranks because it assures a kill and gens aren't being done because it's low ranks.
---
At high ranks though? Shit does a 180 real fast and that was a massive difficulty spike for me personally.
---
Survivors learn loops and how easy most of them are (Safe &amp; Un-mindgamable, Jungle Gyms, Killer shack, Ironworks of misery, etc.)  and how this + exhaustion perk gets them 45+ second chases
---
They learn to cooperate and recognize the signs of another person being chased (Health state changes to injured) and that this means to hop on a gen. (*Obsession claws moving, Hop on gen. Injured survivor, dont have to worry about killer)*
---
They learn that Outside of a few exceptions, Healthy state = safety no matter how close the Killer is (*Popping a gen in the killers face, Unhooking immediately after hook*)
---
They learn that **THEY** have control over a Killers position and options (*Killer has to follow for chase, Hook options are whatever is within 12s of wherever a survivor went down*)
---
They learn what Survivor Perks say LOL, Nah to Killer actions/Perks (DS, BT, Dead hard, Adrenaline, Spine Chill,etc) and use those to Bait &amp; Switch or Give a second/third/fourth/etc chance
---
Combine all of that and the possibility of SWF with voice comms and the Game goes from somewhat balanced at mid ranks (12-8) to a Survivor sided shitfest where Killers have a choice of picking A top 3 killer, using broken shit or hoping they get matched with survivors at a lower skill level than them in order to walk away with something better than a Black pip.
---
IMO, In the current state of the game, A Killer going up against a Survivor group with the same skill, doesn't stand a chance without Spirit,Nurse,Billy or a Mori (Broken shit). 
---
I'd like to see a PTB where Mori's, Keys and NOED are removed, Killers get Whispers by default, Gen kicks Regress gens at 3%/sec, Survivors must repair gens for 3s (equal to kick time) before regression stops and Gen repair times are increased by 50% \* largest party size.
---
Bamboozle is pretty mediocre. They likely will still have a pallet nearby and even then, other perks have far more usability and versatility. It can definitely deal with some very strong windows like the Macmillans ones, but running an entire perk for a potential map isn't a great idea.
---
I remember when I decided to try Trapper without Ruin. Got survivors with 3 brand new toolparts
---
Ah, oops! I've yet to be mori'd by him, and now I'm a little disappointed. That sounds cool
---
oh thats y u camped my lil bro\*im a Claudette\*
---
The only downside to Spine Chill is figuring out which way the killer is coming from. It only tells you that you are being watched.
---
P.s. there's a big difference between no counterplay and difficult counterplay. I assume I'll learn that when I get more of your "approved experience" and hey more games against spirit. Because I couldn't possibly learn anything from streamers, YouTubers, or the endless stream of literature about strategy for this game.
---
I must have scrolled down so far that I ended up in salty survivor hell. This here is an example of one of the many survivor mains that belive that they deserve to always win and if they don't win then the killer better brace himself for the flood of insults.
---
I do definitely think balancing for the lowest common denominator hurts this game, but it's mostly that Behaviour can't seem to decide if this game is a casual game or a competitive game. On the one hand they balance around low ranks and the lack of communication but on the other hand they have a ranking system and skill-based mechanics (skill checks, pallet mind games, map control, etc.) that inherently get better as you rank up.
---
If you look closely she was setting another trap and you can see it flying too
---
Oh sorry, I have no idea what that is
---
That's because BHVR doesn't know how to make a game with actual diversity.
---
It’s almost like killers get bullied into using the two most viable killers in the whole game
---
as the other guy said, pricing, but before the cosmetic shop it was for diferentiating where you got your cosmetics
---
brown for the base game, green for dlc, pink for code-itens (like black glasses dwerd, real iron knucles, golden feng, green shirt claudette), etc...
---
Or one that literally traps your hands, with an iridescent stone effect.
---

ZIMBABWE BUBBA
---
I've disconnected probably half a dozen times in the last month.  One of them was me noping out of a match where a premade last-second swapped to bring in all their goodies and a highly favorable (to them of course) map offering.  The other four or five were Steam or my ISP hiccoughing, or BHVR's gawdawful servers spazzing out, or who the hell knows what.  Had a few where I was blatantly winning or gaining momentum and that was suspicious timing, but I digress.  Your logic dictates that I would be banned for six months for repeated offenses.  I highly doubt my multiple "who knows why" d/c's is unique or even uncommon, but by all means, let's just baby with the bathwater this bitch, we all know how understanding and tolerant the community is, nothing could possibly go wrong.

https://ifunny.co/picture/hey-wraith-where-are-you-going-vietnam-i-have-been-dP2dS4z87
---
the difference is what they mean by that is through multiple games, every time you see them you bring a mori, tunnel, and kill them through like 6 games
---
very good line work
---
I'm sorry, but not all killers run noed though. I will agree that most killers run ruin. Ruin is almost mandatory to slow the game down "just a little bit"  My thing is, if you run across a totem and it's not lit then just try to remember where it is. or bring a map with you so you don't have to remember. If it's lit, by all mean cleanse it. it may be haunted grounds, but it's worth the 50/50 to get the ruin out the way for those you can't hit those skill checks. I think taking that time to do 2-3 dull totems could be used for more progress on gens. if it's down to 1 or 2 gens, okay one person go and look for totems while the other 3 or 2 do the last bit. then join in if you found all 5. It's vital to get that gen pressure in the early game.
---
So don't do it while the killer is chasing someone else right?
---
in that scenario the killer is chasing, why would you get off the gen? also gen could go quicker than 80 seconds with great skills checks or items. 80 seconds is a fair baseline for the comparison. Usually gens go quicker anyway...
---
Sorta similar to that I'd really like some more emotes for Survivor beyond pointing and "come over here." A yes (~~fingerguns~~ thumbs up) and no (crossing arms / shaking head) emote would help a lot. Point in a direction and then do the "no" emote = don't go there. Yes emote at someone doing a gen = you keep doing that I'll go unhook or whatever.
---
While I really enjoy Killing Floor 2 personally I do also think their voice command wheel encompasses a lot of what DbD could use. ~~Follow Me, Go There~~, Affirmative, Negative, Help, and Thank You.
---
As well as maybe some character-specific emotes and a taunt emote to playful BM the Killer ~~and also yell at Meg when she blows the fucking gen up.~~
---
Ruin is so boring I hate running it
---
Low rank killers do that shit because they’re bad and wanna get a secured kill. Rank 15 and below killers can literally get looped around a barrel if you know how to spin, balance is pretty irrelevant to games outcomes at those ranks.
---
Ideally. IMO the best time is when they're chasing a survivor who is already injured.
---
If hate is going up for her I’m glad I switched back to wraith. I love playing her but it’s kinda annoying not having anyone cleanse
---
Huntress Lullaby will let you know it is active as soon as you touch a gen too.
---
I hate the fact that people make fun of you for not running meta perks
---
Sometimes survivors do just well enough to forget that they're in red ranks, and then get sloppy. I've won some games using weaker killers/meme builds because people thought that doing gens fast meant I didn't know how to snowball off of a hook and a down.
---
There's not much middle ground in this game, you're usually dominating or being crushed lol. It makes those real close games all the more memorable though
---
Gotcha, thanks!
---
the tutorial calls them pips
---
throwing them? nah. knowing how to use them correctly? yeah
---
Most Killers are embarrasingly weak at the moment they need buffs
---
For me it depends what role. Survivor queues take ages but killer queues are short
---
As a fellow Adam main, the store page makes me sad :( 90% of his skins are just recolours of the original coat #prayforadam
---
That's weird
---
And pressing M1 to hit someone is?
---
See, you can make everything sound stupid if you want.
---
1 step closer to being able to transfer progress between systems
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOO
---
This kind of looks like the messed up kuchi kopi from Bob's Burgers.
---
And these are the guys who balance the game. Amazing
---
honestly you're kind of right, but it does take skill to know when to throw down a pallet, know if that's the last pallet in your area, know if the killer will be stunned or try and respect the pallet, etc.
---
They should have indeed long removed windows like the Ironworks window, which are windows in long wall tiles that the killer is regularly forced to vault. They could simply replace them with pallets, or rework them into new mechanics, such as limited-use windows that collapse after a certain amount of vaults, for the remainder of the trial, or something wholly new, like doors or crawlspaces.
---
If they actually finally went and reworked problematic windows, they could then also finally remove Bloodlust again and rework Bamboozle into an actual skill-based perk, rather than a bandaid for map design problems that comes with the collateral damage of removing gameplay on un-problematic tiles alike.
---
Lol fucking fuckcock balls motherfucking shit yes.   
---
Legion mains go straight the top goddammit :P
---
Pssh, just put a tourniquet around your neck and yank it out, you'll be fine bro.
---
Dem dislikes. I'm not a killer main, I hate playing killer so I didn't want to extend my suffering any longer than needed!
---
Ooo, I like that idea, but maybe a little calmer.
---
Hex: Heavy Heart
---
Survivors within 16/24/32 meters of the hex totem after it has been cleansed becomes hindered until they are put into an injured state.
---
If they are already injured then they will be inflicted until they are in a dying state.
---
"The skulls scattered around remind us of the people who fell before us"
---
I'll be eating while the killer is carrying me and a teammate is trying to body block while my struggle is at 0. 
---
Even better is when I suddenly get flashlight saved while I'm mid-bite.
---
I honestly think it should wait until you either fail a skill check or get your first stack. I like running the perk but it always gets cleansed too fast because the survivors know it exists too early.
---
I was agreeing, I think Surge is trash as well.
---
Aw, well, thanks!
---
You expect me to hobble around as dr Gordon??? Count me in!
---
I think optional voice chat with randoms would be nice, it would focus the balancing around SWF and not totally fuck solo survivors.
---
On PS4 most games have at least 1 team, might as well add the option to group up.
---
An additional objective should be something that requires traveling. For example having 3 kinds of gens, each requiring a different fuel that can only be found 30+ meters away and you'd need to run at least 3 times during a gen.
---
Numbers are just an example but you get the idea. Make the survivors run around and search something every now and then while doing gens. Makes it easier for killers to find survivors and gives survivors an objective that is not just sitting at something while pressing M1. Moving around while trying not to be seen is much more fun than just sitting around.
---
Obviously I missed it then dipshit.
---
The time it is taking place is the most important part, and they had like 5 paragraphs worth of text. Why would they not have it at the very start in bold ass letters?
---
You weird mother fucker
---
Not true
---
Why don't they just balance it differently depending on player level then?
---
I think Kate only got 2 this year I hope we get another one before the year ends :/
---
Quality Shitpost. 10/10 would basement camp again
---
Don't feel bad for that play, it is a legit way of assuring a kill if they gen-rush and get the doors 99%. Play whatever killer with all the perks you like, and don't let any of these bitches here and there tell you what to do on a game that you bought with your own money. It is up to you to decide :)
---
I recommand you to watch not Otzdarva on YouTube, he's a very great coach for learning killer on dbd
---
By far the funniest thing I’ve seen on this sub reddit in a long time
---
Yes, I know. I was explaining what they were and why they were disliked.
---
There should be an option for it for people who literally cannot spam due to injuries and such, but the default (thematically) works it's job perfectly.
---
All i see here is "killers win because he got 3 or 4k" 4k cant guarantee 1 sole pip, and I don't speaking about camp ou tunnel kill, its completely possible got 4k with 8, 9 hooks and don't pip. Dying with a survivor and still get a easily pip. That's a point. What's is wining? If you ask me, win is get at least 1 pip.
---
I'm pretty sure we're only not supposed to tell people IN the game what are role is - out of it we're perfectly welcome to discuss it, hence streaming it is allowed. I'm an Saver, saving like crazy, and then dying because no one else is allowed to save, or we end up with three saver's and 1 gen doer and we still all die in the end.
---
So uh...yeah, peculiar how the template is literally the same. Guess great minds think alike right ?
---
I wish!
---
It happens a lot for me on survivor. Never get a non laggy match
---
Uh no. The average gen experience is;
---
Someone else in chase, doing gens.  
---
Someone downed on other side of map.  
---
Ten seconds have passed I'm sure someone else will get him.  
---
Twenty seconds.  
---
Thirty seconds, Nobody? Ok I guess I'll run across the map before he's out of phase 1  
---
Run halfway across map, he's off hook, run back to gen.  
---
Gen is sparking, when the fuck did killer even get here?  
---
Start doing gen. Oh look there's the killer. Run around a bit till I can get back to this gen.  
---
What you're saying suggests either you're a killer main who never plays surv or you strictly play SWF. But that \^ is solo queue experience all day every day and I'm in the red ranks atm. It's the same in just about every rank.

Lol no, neither side is that difficult tbh
---
You have no personality.
---
Not really, running around in circles and throwing down a pallet when the killer is close enough isn't that difficult
---
Out of all the things theyv changed, bugged, broke this was the thing that annoyed me to the highest point. People will argue that at least we can leave games with our buddys now but tbh i rather have the switch roles option back. The dbd party system hardly works so i end up having to reinvite my friends anyway.
---
I am the rank 20 Dwight LMAO. I figured it out eventually and thanked the killer. I’m new at this game so the confusion was a lot
---
There's totems and on certain events there used to be third objectives. Not this Halloween, though.
---
I always run kindred
---
DS should be buffed (heard it in both new and old ds) 
---
I've also been reported because I body blocked until BT timer went out (old bt) and because I looped a t1 michael for too much time (there was another alive survivor) this one also left me a -rep comment on my steam profile
---
Well you mistook shred for his other power, inhale :P  
---
With this power he opens his mouth and sucks the air so hard you move back across the pallet and into his open maw!
---
Okay, with that same logic. decisive strike/adrenaline/inner strenght shouldn't exist because if you manage to get downed or hit again by the killer then your crap at survivor. their crutch perks that reward bad behavior. the survivors should learn to run pallets/windows better.
---
I find plague the most fun.
---
It's fast paced gameplay as no one can hide once you have infected everyone.
---
If they cleanse you gotta juggle your pools and chases a bit, but that only happens near the end most of the time.
---
one minute is a LONG time, my dude
---
"Ah, my Spine Chill lit up. Let me just walk away from my gen without the killer seeing me, so that they waste some time looking for me, and my teammates are able to-"
---
BHVR: "DoInG gEnS, yOu?"
---
By the time he said that someone already did so.....
---
Pardon me, but what’s the Forever Freddy build?
---
Plague is quite possibly one of the most fun killers to go against for me. No other killer offers such a game changing choice as cleanse vs stay broken.
---
I might draw him again
---
Dude has a better PC than you.
---
Probably also has a gaming chair
---
Pfft
---
thanks everyone, I've been watching more of his channel to see what he adds to the game/tips etc. I was sad to see so many people downvoted me initially just because I said he wasn't my thing :( guess that's dbd community for ya right?
---
PC if possible, switch doesn't get many updates and also doesn't have all the killers 
---
but from the dlc avaible there, michael with money then get shards for hag
---
Very true I dont get how people struggle to reach high ranks just play alot and casual is enough
---
No, that's not what my logic dictates. You just can't imagine a system of graduated punishments based on information BHVR has that we don't that would excuse a certain number or, if possible, types of disconnects over time.
---
You are the teammate we all need.
---
It's when you wait at the pallet to drop it instead of looping it
---
*everybody disliked that*
---
Legion 100% needs a buff, I only main them because they look awesome
---
Everybody gangsta til Evan becomes Minecraft
---
Thank you :)
---
it's also chaining with other windows and structures, fakes, etc. Not just throwing it when the killer is close lol
---
My opinion is 1. DEMO 2. Clown his laugh is so fun 3. Plague 4. Pig 5. Hag
---
Pig and hag are boring as fuck
---
Plague is eh
---
Clown and Demo fun
---
It sounds like this: *UUAGAAGAGH*
---
Easily the most salty ranks, survivors expect the full rulebook be followed and killers start actually facing decent survivors. yellow ranks and below are noobs and purple ranks and above know the score
---
Gamertag - MaxiKelly
---
Platform - PS4 
---
Just looking for casual SWF. I usually hover around the rank 6 - 8 mark. That doesn’t mean anything though, I’m a potato. 
---
Thanks!
---
Same happened to my but I used the hag version of freddy
---
*Claudette DCs 10 seconds into the match.*
---
Slightly unrelated but this is why I love hillbilly, you can switch targets from an injured guy to a healthy guy out in the open and you're playing optimally, any survivor out in the open is vulnerable to you
---
The guy that jailed me wouldn't tell me how my picture violated the rules just that it was "too much" when i asked why people were allowed to post clips of slasher films but im not allowed to post a guy with a knife he said it was because the movies weren't real .....as opposed to my picture which is totally real
---
I feel you. There are others who are tasked with no healing or saving. I don't think I have enough patience to finish this experiment. Games are over in almost an instant with a 4k
---
Ohhh I gotcha.
---
Corrupt works well still because 3 gens can't be touched for 120 secs.
---
Ruin, to slow things down, and you know they'll be on the hunt once they try gens.
---
Sloppy butcher
---
Thana/nurses eye (because with sloppy heals take longer I think).
---
Yeah I regret selecting survivor
---
Yup. I think he drinks warm milk and stretches for 20 minutes before bed as well. I hear it helps relieve fatigue and stress.
---
This is amazing
---
The only reason i didnt inlcude the killers is because they already have different animations when walking, + they have their respective powers and stuff to make them each feel like unique characters. Their character models are also way different (in some cases) from each other. 
---
What i mean to say is yeah, giving the killers little idle animations or even ones that randomly trigger while walking around would be cool, but the survivors kinda need it more than the killers do.
---
I'm still working on Nurse, so I don't have those spiciest of perks on Legion yet.
---
Ditto especially since I'm a killer main...they're having a field day. And those who are picking Doctor are just brutal.
---
The post was good, but the edit is so amazingly condescending, holy shit, im impressed

the entire game is a longer time
---
the enhanced M1 gets the cooldown reductions of best for last?
---
Well yeah of course its DBD every halfway decent killer that comes out gets nerfed because whiny bitches dont want to try to adapt.
---
But I don’t play trapper
---
Except it is pretty easy to have a keyboard and mouse emulate a controller
---
Have to have been hooked once then they can kill.
---
Maybe the people you played with are tasked with not saving, and only working the objectives.
---
Trying to avoid getting hit is toxic?
---
it's basically where she lives.. there's a bed, a television, portaits and i think ripped article and newspaper pages there as well
---
This line speaks volumes
---
It's still a massive boost of information that singlehandedly makes certain Killers (notably Ghostface and Myers, but also the likes of Wraith and Pig) way worse. After using it for a decent amount of time you'll quickly learn when and where to hide when it lights up and it becomes ridiculously easy to stealth as a result.
---
what are we supposed to see here
---
I just wished they nerfed it differently. I was thinking about removing the terror radius requirement and making it just a generic distance requirement so stealth killers cannot be seen at close range. Now this perk is such a gamble tbh. If you're up against a stealth killer you literally have a perk that only gives you disadvantages as you can't see the killer but the killer can still see you.
---
I did the "Kill everyone by your own hand" challenge last night and was called "The Worst Huntress Ever" in post game after getting all 4 moris off.
---
Legion doesnt need a buff, at all. At high level he does just fine. He's one of the most irritating killers to face by far. Buffing him would put him in top A or even S tier AND be super irritating. No thanks. Hard pass.
---
The pink key in my hand and then the one in the chest lmao 2 free escapes
---
Hello, Doctor Gordon. You are, perhaps, my greatest asset.
---
I wonder if a good solution would be to change the number of gens required to power the games based on survivors' average rank. Lower ranks have to do fewer gens and higher ranks have to do more (and by that i mean probably only a variation of ±1 gen, otherwise it'd get out of hand fast, obviously)
---
Rank 7 killer and 11 survivor
---
Sadly i don't have a pc. Also could you tell Me which Killers are missing in switch?
---
Why
---
I played against Myers awhile ago! Two people disconnected but me and a Meg stayed. Ended up getting downed and led to the hatch at the end.
---
The only thing cuter than furries are opossums.
---
Also pig mains are just dbd furries
---
They are though
---
Since I posted, I think I should provide my opinion.
---
While I really enjoy playing as and against Ghostie, he has a few problems.
---
1. The revealing mechanic is just really janky, as sometimes it's super fast and can be triggered from around a corner, and other times you can't reveal when he's right in front of you, so you basically completely halt in order to do it properly.
---
2. Night Shroud isn't always helpful in a chase, especially when the survivor can see you, so the removal of a terror radius doesn't help if you're in a more open area, especially if your power is canceled while you're chasing.
---
3. He's supposed to be stealthy but has a big-boy terror radius, so you've gotta hide it to get the jump on survivors by moving **really** slow.
---
Those are just my opinions though. Lemme know yours!
---
Ewww eww eww ewww wtf is that shit at the bottom
---
You just want tiddies admit it
---
*Mojang intensifies*
---
I play survivor i know this, its not hard to play lol, i am just tired of survivor mains acting like its so fucking difficult when it really isnt, lol. This game isnt that hard in general.
---
#bufftheteens
---
I think the actual problem is that survivors don't understand how important it is to do gens quickly. If survivors just M1 gens like flies on shit, they don't even have to loop that well.
---
Sorry, meant you don't have to sacrifice them on the hook lol
---
I don’t think he needs buffs but I wouldn’t be against it he’s pretty strong especially if you play him like Tru3
---
I respect survivors who do that but a lot are just Dcing because “meh meh meh you play Freddy , he too op , it’s bs , nerf nerf nerf , Meh meh meh “ 
---
Same goes when I play Ghost face with the hit and run build and am called a camper , even thou they are healing at the hook or near it
---
Same problem for me here.
---
Cries in console
---
Dead by Danklight
---
Oh so because your annoyed by him he should stay one of the weakest killers in the game
---
she always has been disliked for being so linear, doesn't mean she will get nerfed, she is annoying balanced, while spirit is annoying and S tier
---
old legion was never good the way it was intended to play, it was only good due to moonwalks bugs
---
nurse and pig are exceptions, the devs intended the way to play pig as using the traps early (she still deserve a buff) while nurse has been always top tier and was created in the dark times of bdb where infinites where on every map (I main nurse and while the nerf hurt her she is still viable at red ranks, right now I feel like the old one was a bit OP but I still have mixed feelings) and had problematic addons
---
I love the idea of NOED for that very reason. Giving survivors a scavenger hunt and slowing them down for the killer is great for the pacing of the game.
---
Now if only NOED wasn't completely shiiiiiiiiit at incentivizing this.
---
Unless you have either SWF or there's one boyscout running around the entire map with Small Game, you'll almost never cleanse every totem. If everyone cleanses every totem they come across, then there will still be that one totem at the top of the ironworks, which completely invalidated everyone's efforts. So, most people don't even try, which just makes the problem worse.
---
When BHVR stops saying "jUsT cLeAnSe BoNeS" for five minutes and decides to tweak it a bit, the pace will feel way better for everyone.
---
I was so sad when Jane came out and the literal only skin that was any good costed Auric cells while her two yellow-tier outfits were just more recolors of the original skin as well...
---
That's what always makes the multi-layered maps annoying as hell, is that the only way to tell if a Killer is on the same floor as you is through visual confirmation.
---
Its a glitch and it happends with some splinters
---
&gt;DS has been Gut
---
It went from "Get out of Jail free" card to a "Get out of Tunnel free" card. That isn't a gut. 
---
&gt;Med kits have been gut
---
They were recently buffed. Unless you are referring to insta-heals. That isn't a gut, its a balance
---
&gt;Loops have been Gut
---
You mean: no Double pallets at Jungle gyms, No ridiculous amount of pallets, No vacuum vaults or pallets. Your idea of "gutted" seems to mean "No longer OP"
---
&gt;Exhaustion perks are abysmal
---
You mean some of the top used perks, one a "requirement in every build" means abysmal? Oh, you think when they had a 20s cooldown and recovered while running was "good". Sure, "abysmal"
---
&gt;Killer main for over 1100 hours
---
*'Press X to Doubt'*
---
&gt;*Compares WGLF to BBQ and Chili*
---
Killer perk &gt; Survivor perk in an Asymmetrical game?!? What is the meaning of this?
---
&gt;Ruin the most notorious for dragging the game on
---
Dragging the game on = Killer hasn't lost in 6 mins
---
&gt;Survivors are terrible to play with a less than 33% winrate (look it up)
---
I did. Weird. [Most recent stats indicate 33% for rank 20](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/), Are you referring to ONLY rank 20s? because I can cherry pick too! Rank 1 survivors that do enough to not depip have an **80% survival rate**.  but the average of all ranks seems to be *mid 50%.* 
---
I sincerely doubt you are a Killer main.
---
I agree completely.   I got downvoted to hell for saying ruin is a crutch but I stand by it.  Applying pressure properly and knowing when to end a chase are essential for high ranks, and once you get it you can remove the crutch.  
---
I’m consistently red ranks (haven’t gotten back to 1 since they changed it but I’m not salty) and literally never use ruin, unless it’s trapper because he needs a few extra seconds to get going.  
---
Pop does way more damage than ruin and you have it for longer than the first minute of the game.
---
Not using ruin makes it more fun for everybody!
---
A killer will almost always have either NOED, Ruin, or Lullaby. If they aren't running any of those, they are going to lose anyway (in my experience).

Bring back old brand new part that way all the killers will stop playing the game and they don't have to worry about balancing it anymore bam fixed the game

Xbox Ghostsimrox Looking for a swf (3 people)

I'd rather go for a rework instead of a buff. Or at the very least some QOL changes
---
Ahhhh yes Plague just like Spirit will be constantly bitched about until she is “fixed” by BHVR
---
Then you gonna love freddy’s room in basement of school
---
Oh I don't care either way. Tweaking is fine, its just sad when they break a killer and then the challenge is gone, where only really good players provide a good game.
---
I see your a survivor main
---
men out here rlly complaining about spine chill and adrenaline  💀   💀
---
What do u play?
---
I personally think this experiment is very poorly planned and designed. I still did my 15 matches with 1 or 2 escapes but it was very frustrating as an altruistic survivor dying on my first hook while the "selfish" survivors escape (and thus get more rewards).
---
This would work too
---
Who's that guy with a top hat in the background
---
Eh... I'd much rather play the killer in the intended fashion. 
---
It seems as though you're actively punished for playing the killer in the intended fashion.
---
Do I need to post my hours for you to believe me? Lmao, I don't play survivor very much. Regardless you bring up pretty solid points, thank you for bringing those up :)
---
Nah totem placement is awful depending on the map, they've really updated totem placement and so it's a lot harder to find them now.
---
I usually get the kind of mates who exit through the hatch without telling me, let alone protect me. :(
---
But that’s always how games have been balanced. Street Fighter, Smash Bros, LoL, 
---
The problem is that Bhvr doesn’t know how to balance the game. If you ever watch a DBD tournament, what killer is picked? Spirit... and pretty much only Spirit. What perks are used? Typically Ruin, Haunted Grounds, Pop.
---
The game has been too imbalanced for far too long. Tournaments are a joke because there is only a handful of things you can use. Why would any survivor in a tournament run No Mither and Deja Vu? You gotta run DS, Adrenaline, Balanced and Borrowed Time, anything else is simply wrong.
---
Just because the majority of the playerbase won’t go to tournaments are compete at something like EVO doesn’t mean the game should be balanced around those players. Those players know the game better than even the Devs, that’s why they balance around them.
---
But Bhvr  goes “well, Gens take 80 seconds and only 80 seconds, so Gen rushing is not a problem.”
---
And that’s why we are at the state we are at.
---
r e d a c t e d
---
shhh they don't wanna hear that ruin is a crutch
---
It's not useless at all, you dont spend all game in t1 do you???? No you dont, unless you're playing mirror myers
---
Yeah that's basically my curse that I have to live with as a filthy casual who doesn't play the game regularly enough to consistently stay in higher ranks.   Every time I come back I'm back to Rank 17 or so and have to go through that for a good while.
---
I wish they'd just change up how ranked seasons work.  Monthly seasons are cancerous because the rank reset always leads to getting mixed up with a bunch of Killers that employ the "I'm the only one who is allowed to have fun in this match" playstyle.
---
Pretty much 90% of my matches against Ghostface had a camping, tunneling killer. They actually made me dislike the Ghostface because it happened so often.
---
Lol imagine reporting someone over a bug  💀   💀   💀
---
If they changed the way balance worked by rank, I'd be ok with that tbh. Like changing gen progression and regression
---
What stops them from changing this? Well, there's just no precedent. No killer has had their bio altered to reflect new cosmetics. Now they would have to find a way to incorporate how Hoffman and Gordon found their way into the fog, and The Pigs perks still only have Amanda quotes. It's just awkward having to change so much just to accommodate a few cosmetics. 
---
As cool as it would be, it's just a pipe dream. I would be absolutely thrilled if they somehow got a way to incorporate Hello Zepp into the game. I feel like the reason was that BHVR didn't just want to lazily copy-paste the song over the game, and wanted to mix their own version that would fit better both in feel and in gameplay, but the Saw License holders were only okay with it if they didn't change it at all. 
---
Take Michael Myer's chapter. They were given the freedom to alter and mix their own versions of The Hanger, and The Halloween Theme. They had to as The Hanger changes in intensity flawlessly and can stop on a dime depending on distance.  Also they needed all three tiers, tiering up and tiering down to have distinct sounds so it was obvious what state Michael was in. 
---
If BHVR were to incorporate Hello Zepp to play during active RBTs, it would only sound good if the intensity ramped up with how far along your timer was, and the song would need to pause or at least go quiet when your timer paused when you get downed or chased by Pig. BHVR would have had to mix their own version but the license holders probably didn't want them altering their song so they probably compromised and kept it out altogether.
---
Bruh, how hard is it to hit skillchecks and sit at a gen?
---
I do agree I did make a post on suggestions to make his stalk more powerful 
---
Ie downing a marked survivor will knock them out of stealth 
---
Downed and hooked survivor can’t knock you out of stealth 
---
And when you mark someone instead of the red timer and the big ass your exposed warning you get instead to hear Ghost Faces terror radius when your marked this would give you a warning but not enough to get the fuck out super easily
---
Or how bout you just do the gen and trust that your teammates get the save. In your example all you've done was tell me how you wasted your time when you could have done a gen
---
You forgot the /s

Nurse and huntress. Apart from them, I see no problem.
---
But what happens if a rank 1 queues with a rank 5, 10, and 15?
---
What even is the reward? I'm trying to decide on whether or not I want to try to finish the last 5 games in the next hour or if it isn't worth it.
---
It wasn't a buff. It was a rework, dying light is weaker now than it was before, it has anti synergy with itself, the survivor you ignore is the one who benefits the most from being ignored...
---
killers also have to worry about 4 potential dstrikes even if only one of them has an obsession perk, not necessarily dstrike. we don't get to choose the things we play against as well
---
Oh, I see we're playing that game on the same computer, hello friend !
---
No it won’t. It would make more killers viable and you will see more survivors pick perks other than DS, Adrenaline, Borrowed Time and 1 flex perk. Which is typically Balanced Landing.
---
What do you even base your statement on? Do you honestly believe that if the game was balanced around high level play it will somehow mean Killer mains are going to get 4K 2 pips every game?
---
Smash Bros has huge casual appeal AND it’s balanced around the high level players. How is this possible? How is Smash Bros one of the best selling games of all time?
---
I just started playing the game about a month or so ago, and as someone who pretty much only player the Hag as a killer, I find Ruins ONLY purpose is to allow me to get my traps set up and maybe injure one or two people. After that, I dont bother protecting it because as long as I apply pressure and keep people injured, sloppy butcher is more than enough to slow the game down, but unfortunately sometimes that means if I'm up against a decent team, game can last almost half an hour. What about for the first min of the match, gen progress is slower, then as the match goes on for longer it goes faster and faster. Kinda like blood lust for survivors
---
Does it count as a 4k if 2 dc as soon as they see the killer?
---
It's normal, yea, devs don't punish it so people do it

---
Console can probaply also do this. It's the button you press to get the character information.
---
You can use it to open the hatch when it spawns. It can rob the killer from like 3 kills with 2 gens left if you play it smart or use coms
---
true, but on the other hand, ranking up is a punishment for killers since most of them arent viable at higher ranks.
---
It doesnt rly matter what killer u use but trapper is probably the best at doing it. I mean that it works on any killer.

---
Yes those add ons are still a thing.
---
Eggfuckingscuse me?
---
Yeah u right gotta give the survivors some love
---
I don’t run ruin and do just fine.... maybe spirit is OP? Lol
---
Really hoping the archives are only going to be for the free characters, would be totally unfair to other players who cant buy the other characters
---
Lmfaooo dude I win against every legion cause they are trash 🤣🤣
---
I just thought it was funny how we had 2 free escapes and none of us made it out. It’s not that serious 😂
---
You are kidding? in the slashers post 2006 all the teenengers  die
---
The *biggest* difference between a good and bad survivor is how many pallets they use while wasting my time.
---
I’ve had chases last a minute with 5 or more pallets gone
---
I’ve also had chases with good survivors who waste the same amount of time with 3 or less pallets
---
Why don't they punish people who DC by removing blood points?
---
Or, if you DC this round, you forfeit your points next time. Or receive an automatic 25% penalty, going up 25% for every DC within 12 hours?
---
That, and lock out the blood web. If you DC once, you lose access to the blood web for 1 hour. It goes to 3 hours if you DC twice within 12 hours. 5 hours if you DC 3 times... Etc.
---
Legion mains: I have achieved speed.
---
Along with seemingly every top level streamer.
---
I think a lot of this is killers who have pipped too easily and are now outside their depth.
---
You’re insane
---
Yessss. I confused a Trapper with an explosion save and it was hilarious seeing them stop out of confusion. You can tell when it's like a "wait wth" stop
---
Amazing edit but my only issue is that was Hillbillys chainsaw sound instead of LF
---
That wasn't my match, it sounds like, my survivors got the gate. 
---
But it still applies: thank you for not dc'ing!
---
How is survivor unplayable?
---
If they fix it they will break 30 other things
---
This is where they had to put Jason to sleep right?
---
Isn't Hag a DLC on pc? Pretty sure there's stuff for her on the current pass.
---
That's the risk you take when you bring OoO into a game.
---
The killer takes a risk bringing hex perks knowing full well they could be destroyed within 20 seconds of the match beginning.
---
Hoping yall wouldnt notice lol. I couldnt easily find a clip of Lf revving his chainsaw.
---
whats wrong with killer?
---
Looped a Freddy for about 2 minutes. I don’t think he knew Freddy that well and I rarely got hit with his power. Rank 2 killer.
---
I really like Plague but I think something should be done, too. They shouldn't gut her power or nerf her, but since it's meta to not cleanse against her, you're really just using no mither against an M1 killer. In that sense, it's super unfun. Not really unfair or overpowered, it's just nothing interesting.
---
I thought you just lagged and all of it was a dream when the video looped.
---
Dedicated servers are messy and everyone is dcing
---
&gt; And yet killers still have average kill rates starting at some 60% (i. e. the weakest killer characters still sacrifice noticably more survivors than they have escape). Even in the oh-so-competitive red ranks. The game is currently killer-sided, statistically.
---
Kills don’t matter. Ranking up matters. If you kill the survivors too fast, you might black pip. So getting 2 kills per game doesn’t mean you win. As a survivor, you can get sacrificed and still rank up. You can escape and still black pip or rank down.
---
So that 60% figure I see tossed around means jack shit to me. Spirit “overperforming” means jack shit. So many people DC when spirit shows up that.. yeah.. of course she’s gonna dominate.
---
I think this from a Freddy movie where he was trying to scare a drug addict
---
From 3rd one.
---
Dream Warriors.
---
The overall survivor sidedness of the game. And killers are getting unfair hits
---
My eyes are bleeding from thinking about how long that would take

its trapper and claud on the first tome
---
As a proud fan of both the Friday and Nightmare franchise, this comment hurts me.
---
I see deliberate attempts every other game now to make the game as unfun for the other side as possible now on PS4.  Moris off hooks, the best toolboxes to pop generators faster, flashlight squads, tunneling down hard, every Freddy has to run ropes...
---
One shot hatchets, just...you name it. I can't remember the last time I had a normal match of DbD that didn't feel like something that the other side had pretty much won it for them and not the fact they just outskilled the other side. 
---
Frankly the game is a god damn mess right now.
---
1) B or B+
---
2) Wonky. Better than it used to be, but there are times where you just can't even get the beginning of the reveal sound to proc. And Survivors can break you out in the most bizarre ways as well. The indicator showing you the direction of a survivor revealing you and the killer instinct don't activate pretty frequently.
---
3) I think it's better than most people do. It's about stalk economy and vantage points. Most people want to just brute force it which is the wrong way to go about it
---
4) I feel like this is included in my other answers
---
5) Pretty good. Full 115 speed and no stain? dank. and if you use stalk economy well you can pop an exposed at ideal times
---
needs no change other than ironing out the wonkiness

Yep, even though she got released far later than Adam, she has double the amount of skins than Adam.
---
Thought about maining killer
---
Uhm, yes? Follow the rules god damn
---
had it deserved,selfish noob
---
&gt; Downed and hooked survivor can’t knock you out of stealth 
---
yeah, there really is no good reason for it to be like this
---
What do you mean, it's a fun killer with a cool aesthetic?
---
‘Fan content’ is a flair
---
Oh my god, we can ALL boop da snoot!
---
I've never played Friday the 13th, but I heard the ways to win as a survivor in that game are to escape via boat or car (which can't fit all the survivors, or to repair a phone and call the police who will arrive after few minutes. This sounds so much more interesting that repairing gens or finding the hatch! I think other ways of survival would be impossible to implement in dead by daylight, but still. It sounds fun
---
Being really bad at skill Checks
---
Exactly, this game is only as fun as both sides make it and neither side wants to have fun apparently
---
Eh.. if somebody had to tell you that teabagging was or wasn't an insult, the memes are deserved.
---
I mean Ruin and Noed aren’t mandatory...if survivors actually play the game and work together yeah, of course they’re actually needed to slow things down. 
---
Thing is I swear maybe 2 out of every 10 games do survivors actually play the game effectively.
---
Sounds like someone is in a dire need of Spirit Fury + Enduring.
---
You will get a lot of hate at lower ranks where you play optimally or you play nice so you may as well play optimally.
---
Play the way you want but yes you are tunneling and that's pretty shitty.
---
I play both sides before someone yells salty survivor main
---
Yeah and they're especially annoying when you're trying to go for Adept killer achievements. Bhvr mentioned they are going to have survivors leave a husk behind when they DC that you can still hook.
---
They protected themselves from a hit and got distance on the killer, it was also midgame (3 gens done). This seems like a perfectly acceptable time to use it
---
It took me a long time to realize that the killer gets notified when you miss a check / sabo a hook
---
Well you are techically tunneling. Which i personally find rather toxic. Dont be afraid to lose your tokens cause you can get those back.
---
Bruh just batista bomb their asses. It doesent matter if it is viewed as toxic or not, if its the most optimal play you got just bean them.
---
Feng Min did not pass the vibe check.
---
Hell yeah, this is awesome.
---
Coming from r/all anyone care to explain? Ive played one game before but thats all
---
Ah right I was confusing archive with rift. They're most likely going chronologically so I expect the first 4 to be based on free characters at least, but I think every character will be featured for lore.
---
No one knows.
---
I love how bubba just revs up his chainsaw like he’s so happy
---
I’m playing on Xbox and I would not call the game unplayable but I do agree that the level of toxicity is at a real high right now. The last couple weeks I’ve gotten more hate messages than any other time playing, whether I play nice or whether I play optimally as the killer.
---
I don’t understand why you like OoO I know how to loop killers really well but I don’t want them to know where I am and what I’m doing. Especially if I’m trying to stealth juke
---
They need the permission from hideo kojima not konami
---
Just close your end game chat box before you do this.
---
Technically, i guess it is toxic, but mostly id say toxic of the obsession to be pulling all those unsafe hooks, screwing his team
---
Your friend is a scumbag. And if you are the friend, i hope a random cacti gets stuck up your ass
---
Surge needs you to down with an M1 and have tl within a certain range of a gen and it had a cooldown. Not only that, but the gen also has to not be regressing and it only regresses gens by 8%
---
&gt; the game is in the worst state I’ve ever seen it in in my 2+ years of owning it.
---
omegalul
---
But not inaccurate
---
I’m on Xbox as well and the same thing is happening
---
Ghostface is ready for take-off.
---
Its not tunneling, its being optimal with his tokens, he’s not targeting the person down, he just wants to save tokens and not waste all of them
---
Depends on the person and which game. Tbagging can have multiple meanings
---
Not what I said
---
I saved a guy from basement hook yesterday and the dude just ran around directly in front of me on the way out, slowing both of us down and managing to get the killer's attention.
---
The 4 original survivors?
---
You are running 3 anti-totem perks which could be used by something more useful just for NOED... Yikes
---
Targeting the person who gets unhooked is tunneling no matter the excuse. Even if you don't rehook you purposely targeted them which is the definition of tunneling
---
Laughs in oink
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
The actual time is 80 seconds for 1 survivor assuming no missed or great skill checks.
---
44 seconds for 2 survivors.

I dunno, i dont think they would, as the post points out they cant write backstories for people who already have it, and like i said it screws players who dont have them out of the archives, and if you dont have either the survivor or killer on that page, it would make it impossible to finish, doesnt seem fair to the players who cant afford to either pay the price or grind the shards
---
Take it to devs.. its their logic
---
Yeah and billy needs a buff
---
Pretty much this. I don't find it toxic to punish bad play. Like, what? You expect me to just put myself at a serious disadvantage because your teammate was shitty? It sucks your teammate did that but damn Im not gonna watch the unhook and just walk away
---
It doesn't really help though that STBFL *kinda* unintentionally encourages this behaviour tho
---
Well keys dont GUARANTEE your escape. They just help you escape faster depending on your proggress
---
I'm pretty sure Konami has the rights... sadly...
---
I was probably close to doing 4 gens all by myself last night.  I did parts of the first 2 then all of the last 3.  Red rank survivors BTW.
---
Git gud kitty
---
The act itself isnt difficult. The mindgame is.
---
They should just die via endgame collapse animation. Maybe have something simaler for the killer, and the exit gates open for them to leave idk
---
Report them, the devs already banned multiple people for death threats
---
Ghostface.
---
Already do
---
I disagree, 99% of the time killer will run ruin if they have it. That I can agree with. But the other 3, i don't see them played really at all. Lullaby is a garbage hex totem. it's the worst one of the bunch in terms of power.  I'm not saying don't do totems at all. I'm saying not as many people run the other hex perks besides ruin to justify taking most of the early game to hunting totems. It would be better to do it when you have at least 3 gens under your belt. If you run into a lit totem, by all mean cleanse it. but, doing all of them in fear of something that may not even be there is a waste of time to me. If you see noed proc, then take the info of where the totems were and your team or a map you brought can help find noed. Noed is no scarier than ruin.
---
Konami can't make a new silent hill because hideo has the rights of the game
---
I took the game hostage because they 3 genned themselves and then they refused to do any of those gens.
---
i would love a faster pallet drop perk/one that makes your stuns on the killer longer
---
**Steve** : (*gets hit*) I think they mixed up the drugs (giggles on the floor)
---
I will bodyblock for whoever needs this achievement. Team games for the win
---
i guess a little, but its more of an "anti-tunnel this one guy" perk, and if that guy abuses it and leads you to teammates and gets them killed, thats on him
---
Exactly. Personally I’d say just remove his collision while chainsawing
---
If I had an award to give, I would. You earned it, here’s the closest thing I can give 🏅
---
Me and my mates are all rank 5 below and run to and from gens. The only time we walk is versus stealth killers or when we enter their terror radius. Killers tend to be blind af so we usually don't worry about it
---
Adding parts to finish certain gens (just a gear you can find in certain spots) would help a lot. Then you have to decide if you want to get a gen to &lt;whatever percentage you can get it to without a part&gt; or find a part first. Maybe different color gears for different color gens.
---
There would have to be a bit more to it but I think that would be a good place to start
---
&gt; People complain about that now too?
---
I guess technically they do.  If I'm playing survivor and I see a fellow survivor camping a pallet I get a little miffed.  When I play killer and see a survivor camping a pallet I know they're going to be a fairly easy down.
---
Yep
---
Not using Billy's chainsaw...
---
He could of looped killer shack for the remaining two generators. You act as if he had to throw it down to protect himself. He wouldn't have to do if purposefully didn't go directly to it in the first place, even though he knew or should of known the killer was going there.
---
I can’t tell if you’re serious or not
---
theres no dedicated servers on xbox
---
I can 3-4k really consistently with M1 killers, but any killer that requires power use to down survivors I suck with (Demogorgon is the exception).
---
I played Billy yesterday on Rotten Fields and got kicked around, then played Legion the next game and got a 4k with 5 gens left.
---
This so low effort and i love it. Just the sound of **BONK** in my mind is funny.
---
I do and funny thing is I just bought spirit... Then people wanted to Nerf her, I just thought I want a refund
---
Or just sits on a gen, hears heartbeat ignores gets pulled off
---
A player on my team scared me cuz they had a mask and I thought it was legion or something.  But what do you mean when you said talking a picture?
---
Yeah licensed characters would be an issue but I expect the original dlcs to receive tomes. We'll just have to wait and see how bhvr does it and hope they take free players into consideration
---
I'm in this picture and I don't like it
---
Having the exit switches spawn randomly around the  map would be good too
---
Hover over the serum and read the description
---
Basically anything that takes advantage of how many people are injured, even if they dont kill.
---
I use the Franklins Demise as legion. Solid Snake would be proud of how i disarm an entire platoon using only CQC
---
Seriously, fuck these made up rules. Play how you want OP!
---
I’m not just concerned about my own platform
---
Forever Freddy is when you use 4 perks to slow down the game (Dying light, Thana, Ruin, and Pop) with his add-ons (Red Paintbrush/Swing Chains/Jump Rope) to slow the game down to a very fustrating crawl. Every activity (healing, repairs, etc.) takes-- well, forever, to accomplish.
---
Its definitely a *Fun Police* build
---
Demogorgon: "Paint me like one of your French girls"
---
100% serious.  Also buff spirit
---
I didn't know Moris were a thing, so against the nurse, i thought, "The last Gen is done, I'll just take the hook, they'll unhook me and we'll run out through the exit gat--- wait, omg, why is she choking me?!?!"
---
Yeah it’s kind of obvious lmao but when there’s 2 it’s kind of like a killer bringing a Mori and not getting a single kill
---
Playing Doctor, lunged into four walls during one chase. Eventually the Dweet I was chasing gave himself up out of pity
---
To me, getting chased is the most fun part of the game and I really want to get better at them. OoO forces chases or sometimes killers automatically assume you're toxic and ignore you for quite a while. It works really well either way!
---
Nope, they already said they were tweaking her base kit as well when mentioning the addon rework for her, doctor, and chainsaw bros.
---
If you tried to blind a cat, the light would just reflect in his eyes and blind you
---
I have the urge to hug a demogorgon but at the same time im afraid it will indeed bite my head off.
---
Ok Boomer
---
I've gotten to rank 9 with Bubba without Ruin. Its to the point now where I get most of my hooks in the EGC.  
---
Time to level up Hag.
---
Not a bad meme 10/10
---
There's probably a dual-ownership deal then. No way Kojima has exclusivity. PT would've never been cancelled.
---
A Train?
---
They need to fix steves voice
---
Don't use emoji please
---
Maybe look at the popups that appear when you start the game. They usually contain important info
---
Sure, and perks aren't a necessity either. Ive seen players play with no perks and survive/4k
---
Obviously you don't need anything to constantly win, anyone using perks are just making excuses amirite?
---
Leatherface for sure, and I think freddy aswell?
---
I knew about the add on. Never thought about running some of these with her. (Then again I just started playing as plague.)
---
dweet said "Vibe check"
---
Man. Plag is balanced imo.Spirit needs a bit of reworking and rest seem fine. (Everyone but legion. Buff my bois)
---
Do you have any suggestions for SWF specific killer buffs that wouldn’t make it absolutely busted
---
&gt; DS has been gut
---
Not really. It’s still a meta perk. Almost every red rank survivor is going to be running this.
---
&gt; Every killer perk, ruin, whispers, enduring, etc just makes the killer better at their objective. 
---
...Yeah.. that’s generally the idea when you make perks for the game. Why would the devs make perks that only handicaps the killer?
---
&gt; Survivors Objectives are loop, protect, survive.
---
Uh. No. It’s to do Gens. That’s it. Surviving means nothing either because you can be killed and still rank up. I thought you had over 1,000 hours? 
---
&gt; Almost every survivor perk is counter intuitive or has a killer perk that beats it. WGLF? Terrible, gives you nothing.
---
What survivors are you playing against that runs that perk? Ive never seen that perk, in my experience and from watching other streamers. I had to look it up because it’s so rarely used.
---
&gt; Killer keeps getting easier and easier, and playing survivor the 4 to 1 aspect is the most dry gameplay. If I wanted to watch the same 3 second loop of getting dragged to the sky, I'd turn on a gif. I won't play survivor unless I have a daily to level up killers.
---
If Killer is so easy, why is Spirit pretty much the only killer worth playing at high rank?
---
Clearly outskilled and all C A L C U L A T E D by killer
---
Wraith should have said “a-ding ding ding”
---
Outplayed.
---
If I see 2 or more tool boxes I run franklins. Brutal.
---
Best book
---
This looks amazing!! :) I play Legion myself and I love seeing art of them. Please continue posting your artwork, it looks amazing!
---
I agreee with this one. Like I guess I'm being toxic but is it really my fault that my obession knows I won't go for him and he just keeps unhooking the survivior.
---
Highest level of play would be sweaty 4man SWF, and the majority of the playerbase aren't playing like that....
---
Bro there is literally a watermark at the bottom
---
Without factoring in disconnects, the *lowest-performing* killer character on the *worst map* still had a kill rate of 55%, last time they checked (at rank 1, mind you). Spirit is likely in the 70+% range.
---
I find the Emblem and pip system to be pretty bad anyway, but I don't mind much since I don't care about rank - I rank up inevitably on both sides, and always have, without caring about doing so at all.
---
Okay great. Now run your Ruinless Bubba against a fully Meta’d SWF running flashlighrs, Medkits, toolboxes and kits and tell me how well you do.
---
You ever just feel like you had a stroke after reading something? This is one of those times for me. GG
---
Forgot I was in the dbd sub and was extremely confused for a thicc minute
---
Really? It's not that bad for me, doesn't happen every game, just more recently.
---
Interesting, I love glitches

LOL

---
Red rank survivors are much more difficult than any other rank because they know how to loop and coordinate. Doubly so if they are SWF.
---
Imagine making an alt account just to post your salty opinions because you are too afraid to post it on your main account.
---
Always cleanse. If they die, they die.
---
I had a game last night as Legion where the Survivors did a good job of getting through three generators fairly fast...
---
...and then they seemed to just turn their brains off after that and I got a very bizarrely easy 4K.  I almost felt bad, but I didn't feel like playing nice with a team full of headless chickens.
---
plague gets genrushed more than any killer does, cuz every survivor will be broken which means they don't need to spend 40 seconds healing with self care, they'll just work on gens or just drink from a fountain which takes 6 seconds and heals them fully
---
Where are these super fast rank 1 games everyones talking about? I play both sides at rank 1 and it's very rare that all 4 survivors get out when I'm playing killer.
---
Why should the killer not play optimally as a counter to survivor optimal play shenanigans? It is as purposeful and shitty as someone using OoO in a SWF situation. It is unfair to expect the killer to constantly be nerfing themselves for the sake of survivors feeling of fairness. How is the situation ‘fair’ to the killer? It’s not!
---
I’m going to run all the best survivor perks and teabag the hell out of you two and then say I can play how I want without any decency
---
Probably the constant drugs and chemicals hes exposing himself to to create the tonics.
---
Honestly probably my favorite mori in the whole game
---
I swear, if people did this more often. you wouldn't have to worry about it as much. The more you crowd the hook the more a killer is less likely to leave. I had a plauge game the other day. I manage to get a hook with 1 gen left. They immediately swarm the hook like hungry seagulls after the hook animation. I ended up with a 4k because of them acting stupid. If they had just done gens or hell even give me time to even walk away, at least 3 or even everyone could of gotten away.
---
The hatch motivates teammates to be selfish. It's my biggest complaint as Survivor. One person dies too quickly and they just crouched around waiting for their team to die. I will have a team straight up forfeit the match because they think escaping is all that matters. Especially now that you don't have to do a single generator for it to spawn. And hatch grabs are no longer possible for some reason. So now the Survivor can sit on the hatch as long as they want and teabag the killer who has nothing they can do to stop them. You will have to see them Escape no matter how arrogant they are being. Unless you slug for the 4th kill
---
Survivors have an 80% Escape rate at rank one but you're not bringing that up? It seems like you're using very specific statistics to get the results you want. I challenge you to play a race at rank one and 2 pip. I challenge you to play Leatherface without his best add-ons from rank 20 to rank one.
---
Weak Killers do not dominate. Especially because a rank 15 killer can go against purple and red rank survivors. I have plenty of screenshots to prove that they still haven't fixed that bullshit yet.
---
 I do this crazy thing called playing both sides of the game equally. And I have no fun on either of them. I'm either getting garbage teammates and solo Survivor against a much better killer that will dominate my Noob teammates will have no idea what they're doing. For example they won't do a single generator if there is ruin. Or they lose all ability to Loop the moment they see the Killer. I mean I even get ranked twenties on my team for some reason. These idiots will throw down every pallet they see even when they aren't in a Chase.
---
While when I play any killer but The Best of the Best... I am guaranteed ticket dominated most of the match. Leatherface can't even get a 4K with an ebony Mori against optimal survivors. Especially since it seems to always give me the most Survivor sided Maps possible. If I'm Huntress it's an inside map or a massive map. If I'm hillbilly it's an inside map or one of the swamps full of obstacles. If I'm Trapper it's a super very well-lit map. If I'm Michael it's a map that's out in the open. Not only that but all of my totems besides haunted grounds always spawn next to a generator or on a hill. Don't forget the Asylum Maps where totems just spawn in the middle of an open field of grass. Meanwhile if I'm any slow killer that can't Loop or has a useless ability and Chase like Leatherface or wraith... I'll get Ironworks of misery or wretched shop with the double window and three pallets.
---
They balance the game horribly. All Leatherface needs to be somewhat more viable is not slowing down when he charges his chainsaw. All of the new top-tier nurse add-ons are garbage. Her green add-ons are much better. The developers don't know what's good.
---
Not only that but if there is a killer that makes survivors play differently. That killer is nerfed into the ground due to the survivors review bombing the game or just disconnecting against that killer until they get their way. For example Ghostface is getting a ton of disconnects. Personally I can't stand him and I fucking hate that killer but just because you don't like a killer or can't treat them normally... Doesn't mean it's a problem with the game.
---
For example noobs hit the doctor. The doctor is the noob stomping killer. He completely counters Urban evasion and most stealth methods. New players tend to be stealthy. So they hate the doctor. Meanwhile spirit is the polar opposite of the doctor. She discourages chases. If you get chased by her you need to listen carefully and rely on other senses besides Vision. Mind-game her with pallets by dropping them early and moving to the other side or using stealthy perks. She discourages the chases and looping the same way the doctor discourages stealth. But stealth is garbage and the doctor sucks so people don't care. Still doesn't give you any points. Sure you'll blow through generators and most likely Escape but looping is much more fun. And since there's one killer that discourages looping... Everyone hates her. The same way people used to hate nurse until she was reworked. Doesn't matter though. The developers don't know what is good or bad and I'm sure they will nerf her into the ground before moving on to the next killer. Instead of making week or Killers like Leatherface or Rafe viable like what they did with Freddy. If every color got to rework like Freddy ... the game would be in a very good place. That's not going to happen now. He said the focus is being shifted to a battle pass that's borderline impossible to level up if you have a job school or social life. They drip feed you back enough cells so you can buy the next level. I know because I bought into the premium battle pass. I'm also decent at the game so I finished the archive challenges my first few hours.

bruh that emoji is clearly ironic
---
Imagine playing Spirit. It doesn't take a wild imagination to think that you're bad.
---
These are the omegas. The betas of the betas. The ones we can all hate on.
---
*Sounds of the devs scribbling down the newest challenge for the next book in the archives*
---
I’ve been away from the game for a while, what’s OoO?
---
The definition of tunneling has been changed by survivor bias, if someone is unhooked in front of the killer, they’re injured and therefore a better target. Tunneling is straight up not going for anyone else for the entire match, even if you see other survivors you only choose to chase that person. You clearly are biased towards survivors if you don’t know the true definition of tunneling.
---
I honestly prefer playing with shattered mirror soooo
---
The point of the perk is to literally ignore your obsession following them around is just a dumb idea
---
Oh man, i Really wanted Freddy..., but Thanks for informing Me
---
Wish I could grab a hatchet from the locker and finish what Spirit's daddy started.
---
But this is reddit dawg no rudeness just saying
---
Apples are useless at low ranks and amazing at high ranks
---
I let a ghostface stalk me fully because i thought it broke the stalk if i looked at him now i know it only breaks stealth not stalk
---
He attacks us with kindness
---
morf
---
Baby Dwight is a meme, there's nothing wrong with using him.
---
Same here for Xbox. It’s ridiculously longer as killer compared to queuing as a survivor
---
Congrats on the best Tome 4 meme. Don't quit bby
---
Gotta bring those apples!
---
same (except spirit since she is super easy to play), this is probaply because I always think too complicated and try to go for riskier plays with more powerfull killers.
---
He did it... He booped da snoot
---
While, yes. It's not hard to throw down pallets, there is skill to chases on more than just a macro level. It's the patience and reads that lead you to know when to throw down the pallet, that takes skill.
---
You might run through a pallet if you think the killer is getting desperate for that hit and swings. Knowing which loops are safer than others, and positioning yourself near them takes awareness. 
---
There are certain loops where Legion literally can't catch up to you with Feral Frenzy because they vault too slow. 
---
Understanding the counterplay to mindgames vs killers like Pig is also a skill. Knowing when to walk towards the next pallet when they crouch, preparing to lunge, or when to call their bluff is a skill, on top of reading which side they will actually commit to.
---
Survivors often don't learn skills like these because they rely on exhaustion perks giving them an easier, and more consistent way to run from the killer.
---
Sprint Burst stops you from learning positioning.
---
Balanced Landing opens up new loops to use, but using those means you arent practicing more fundamental loops, so you get caught out on a map where BL isn't good.
---
Lithe has no thought process behind it. It's just an easy time waster.
---
Dead Hard doesn't require you to read or mindgame the killer. You just have to run loops normally, and if you make a mistake or want to be greedy with a pallet, you just Dead Hard for a safe pallet drop.
---
I'm not saying survivors are bad if they use exhaustion perks, I'm just saying it hinders your learning when you run things that stop you from being punished. Imagine how good you could be if you learn how to loop a killer without an exhaustion perk, and *then* equip one. You become, as Tru3 says, an "optimal" survivor.
---
Why does reddit have this obsession with hating on emojis?
---
Does it just come with the website’s superiority complex or?
---
That can happen with any killer though. There's no balance that will ever fix bad teammates
---
I love that Spirit skin. Too bad I dont have her :(
---
I don't understand why kills don't matter to you but pips do. "Rank" to me is a much more meaningless measure of my success than kills or even just hooks in my rounds. And both are equally "arbitrary", in the grand scheme of things.
---
I am red rank on both roles, and have been in most season since early 2017; and there are a ton of bad players in red ranks, with the average being mediocre at best. Because it is very easy to get there. But yes, the better and best players will be red rank most of the time too, of course. Still doesn't mean I care about getting to red rank, I just do with uncaring ease.
---
I just realised it said the trapper

plague is nowhere near being fun and she is disgusting to look at, to hear, to play against, etc.
---
30 seconds with one provethyself person.  Nevermind tool boxes or brand new parts or three people gens.
---
its so painful watching new players run to pallets and wait to throw them down.  if i'm in a SWF i usually try to bait the killer on me instead so we have more than 2 pallets after 3 minutes.
---
A useful tip is to watch the glass shards on her body. If she's phase walking, her husk will have glowy blue shards
---
Yep, gen teams are nasty. Especially on farm maps
---
Wtf? I never get good SoloQ teammates at rank 1. Still pip because rank is easy, maybe that's the problem... Whatever it is, it's just that the best killers are unfun, so survivors don't wanna play, and playing Billy and anyone under is just risky.
---
U should start playing killer if it’s annoying to be against the spirit.
---
STBFL wants you to ignore the obsession so if their the ones saving then thats on them. Its not hard to tell if a killer has it so someone else can go for the save
---
Why do we play this game again?
---
That doesn’t necessarily mean I don’t play killer i play killer a lot it’s just the spirit in general is annoying to deal with.
---
Nah we just love this 🗿
---
The only problem, with balancing is..............................
---
SWF
---
most low rank survivors dont SWF and are solo. 3 survivors working on a gen, while the killer chases the 4th is because SWF use Discord, or third party software to communicate:  
---
"Killer is chasing me."
---
"Killer heading towards you"
---
"Ill distract the killer, while you work on gens"
---
voice chat is why this problem exist. The game was definitely not balanced around it. Without voice chat survivors don't know the killers location at all times, so this makes them more cautious, when doing gens. With voice chat they know where the killer is at all times, so there is very little reason to be cautious.
---
i mean. i’m a dog person, too, but that’s a cute fucking cat, man
---
It could also be the entity’s influence on the Clown, similar to how the Huntress’ eyes are
---
So in the game, killers can bring offerings called Moris! What happens is after you hook a survivor once, then next time you down them, you have the option to ‘mori’ them, which gives a special animation and kills them (instead of having to hook a survivor 2 more times!) 
---
So Each killer has a unique animation, and ghost face stabs you a couple times and then lifts up your head a takes a picture with you!

&gt; I don't understand why kills don't matter to you but pips do. "Rank" to me is a much more meaningless measure of my success than kills or even just hooks in my rounds. And both are equally "arbitrary", in the grand scheme of things.
---
Okay. But the game mechanics dictate that you can’t rank up unless you complete certain objectives in a certain way. It may not matter to you, but to someone who actually does take the game seriously, winning means getting at least a single pip. It doesn’t matter if you get 2 kills or 4 kills.
---
Survivor as well. You can rank up and still get killed. You can escape and de rank.
---
That could be because the devs need to refuckulate the emblem system.. but it’s what we got, and that’s we have to go off of.
---
"Me no know what gen is" - Literally every player who doesn't have experience, or are immersed.
---
Otz literally made a post on this fucking subreddit about how Ruin is a necessity. He just chooses not to use it and plans around NOT having it.
---
It's not called shattered mirror
---
Survivors call everything killer does some variant of camping. Turnabout is fair play I guess.
---
In my travels through the DBD matches every single match I play survivors always teabag
---
When ghost face moris you, he takes a selfie with whoever he moris. I was unaware that he brought a Mori until my friend mentioned he was taking a selfie with the killer :)
---
"Pussy noob killer"
---
Agreed!!
---
Just getting back in the game, is there a reason you shouldnt cleanse ruins?
---
If only there were more viable killers :)
---
Strange, I play Pig and Clown at red ranks and I’ve yet to see these fabled “map warriors”

I apologise, I'm quite new to Reddit. Only joined around a month ago. I came here to push my strong and valid opinions on people who think otherwise. So, no, this is not an alternate account rather my main account. Pleasure to meet you!

Broke: 3 survivors working on gens while 1 survivor distracts the killer

Woke: 1 survivor works on gens while all 3 survivors distract the killer

This is a common misunderstanding. It's 8% bonus regression aka 18%.
---
There are a couple killers who are specialized and require skill and are more difficult to play than the rest of the game

Never see ghostfaces like this until I hit rank reset, where I'm at least rank 10 or lower. High ranks I've seen none of these types.

I aint buying that. Even if its a truth you are still a very unpleasant person to be around. I suggest drinking something sweet like orange juice to flush out the salt you are spreading.
---
You're not meant to get 3 or 4 kills each time. There are 5 players in the game. Why should the killer get all the satisfaction from playing the game and winning?
---
🗿
---
I love it
---
Their you go buddy
---
How much hindered?
---
You existentially want it practically unusable in 99% of matches, some asinine shit like having to hook everybody twice before you can even use it once
---
Post this to r/dogelore
---
Small idiot git gud
---
No to the first two. As the RBT and Deep Wound timer are related to the Killers Terror Radius, reducing it to 0 would make the Deep Wound timer go down or would cause the RBT timer to count down as you would no longer have a Terror Radius. This applies to Tinkerer as well.
---
In regards to Freddy, sleeping Survivors hear his Lullaby, so Dark Devotion would not affect that. Only awake Survivors would notice that Freddy does not have his Terror Radius and they would hear it from the teammate. Again only if they were awake.
---
What was the killer doing? That's what I wanna know.
---
Both sides are equally shit. At Times.
---
I don't get why killers get mad about "gen rushing." What am I supposed to do, tap every gen? It means their is a balancing issue, not a player issue.
---
Ehh Idk like maybe 95/90/85. Im not good as balancing.
---
Quick question, I’ve heard of meta builds but what are they?
---
Sorry, not gonna respond to all of this, but there's one thing I wanna clarify:
---
&gt; Survivors have an 80% Escape rate at rank one but you're not bringing that up?
---
That stat was proven and explained by the devs themselves to be an error in how they took statistics, looking at rank only after the match concluded, artificially inflating the escape rates at rank 1. Every survivor player that deranked in their game was not counted toward rank 1, so those 80% say "of all players that did not depip in rank 1, 80% of them also escaped". It doesn't say 80% of all rank 1 survivors escaped. They then went on to clarify that the actual escape rate at rank 1 was closer to 40%.

---
The timing is dead perfect
---
There is
---
Its only as strong as you are weak, if you're trying to play super altruistic &amp; cocky just throwing yourself at the killer its your fault when he negates the DS you were hoping to use with a Mori
---
I used to do the same, forced myself in chases to learn how to loop.
---
40 seconds with prove thyself... not 30
---
Please do it, i miss play like legion
---
How is that related? If your team is playing lousy or making you get killed that has nothing to do with the design of the killer and all to do with your teamates being absolute knobs or playing selfishly.
---
Teamates sandbagging you is hardly a balance issue or something exclusive to the Plague... how do you even propose the devs solve it? Any game could be balanced to perfection and the players can still decide not to follow directions or play as intended, that is not the game designer's problem. 
---
Even in chess you can throw the game on purpose or just spend the whole match stalling to infuriate the opponent.
---
If you were a good survivor you wouldn't have to depip. Scumbags. You mean scumbags.
---
the only killer who generally needs ruin is trapper and that is solely because of setup time.
---
If it glows, it goes. I've been fucked over by Devour Hope more than Haunted Grounds... and it always seems that whenever DH's instadowns get proc'd... it's too late to save the game.
---
Imagine having such a small imagination to insult others on what they play.
---
That would make killer easier the higher rank you are
---
My best one was in a kill your friends game. Hit a friend as ghost face. left them alone and circled the long way around while they were attempting to work on a generator. Showed up right behind them and grabbed them off it. It was pretty satisfying to hear them scream.
---
&gt;Fuck the spirit

Yeah...she's hot.

Literally how? She's nowhere near as unfair as Spirit and has way more counterplay
---
I'm not sure people who actually take the game seriously care more about getting pips than they do about killing and surviving.
---
If that's the issue with gen times and such, then my advice for you and others that think alike would be to guard 3 gens. You might not kill 4 survivors that way, but you will draw the game out long enough to score in the Emblem categories and pip, most of the time.
---
I like your flair

Quick question; Who asked for this?

I will take it gladly :D

If the survs that was beeing chased in the begining was good he would have lasted the 80 seconds you needed

That is my current issue right now. I am rank 5 as a survivor. If I want to play with friends that are new to the game. I'd literally have to acquire a new account because if we partied up, they would be playing against red killers every other game. Doesn't exactly help them get good at the game if the killer kills them too quickly. It was a needed change so that people couldn't game the system for rankings, but it also screws over groups that just want to play for fun if they have even one person in their party that plays sweaty.
---
in what world does this look even remotely close to m1 range
---
Repost..
---
If I was doing the gen in the killer shack I’d drop the pallet so the killer couldn’t sneak up on me from more than one door. No regrets 😂
---
Plag is literally my queen.
---
I think she fits just right in the "interactivity" spectrum in the same zone as Michael and Frederick. Survivors get a Morton's fork which will doubtless affect their game in a way that both players have control over: whether they choose to cleanse or stay sick, the Plague will always be able to reap the benefits in some way. That's the point of having a power, after all. Her power promotes Survivors to consciously change how they play the game and rewards the Plague player for reacting appropriately to that, which is exactly how a well-designed power should work (Freddy's power is another example of one like this).
---
I would maybe like to see a little more duality in her gameplay, a little more of an incentive for survivors to cleanse at times (maybe a minor groupwide nerf to them if they're all running round fully infected in some way) with a greater reward for cleansing (maybe faster cleansing speed or something).  Make the decision as to whether to cleanse or not a little harder.
---
She's still my favourite killer (especially with an add-on that gives you a corrupted pool at the start of the game as a fail-case if Survivors don't cleanse) and I hope they don't gut her because people have a habit of DC-ing against a mediocre killer or something.
---
I run surveillance on him and it's done me wonders in the late game. Teleport from gen to gen and disrupt them. Ruin sloppy and nurses are my other ones.
---
Fuckem!
---
I was really stoned and left the safety of my jungle gym for the first time and saw Michael Myers standing and staring at me across the grass..... it was really traumatizing because I was too high to move
---
But that’s what’s going to happen. BHR doesn’t just tap the nerf hammer. They slam it down until the result is unusable or so circumstantial that it’s unviable to use them.
---
Purple insta heals are still the same and better since they practically save u from Noed or insta down
---
This “kills don’t matter” mentality of yours is ridiculous. Most players hardly even care for rank and at rank 1 black pipping is essentially still a rankup. 
---
Red rank survivors can be completely braindead as well, it’s hard to argue either side as I’ve seen just as many rank 20’s in red ranks as I have strong loopers.
---
The graphics in this screenshot made me think I was looking at a screenshot of Manhunt for the PS2.
---
Nurse went from skill intensive to skill must have - every missed blink costs nurses so much now its not even funny
---
I agree her addons were broken but i missed my nurse to be honest, it was my go to win killer and now while i still win, its annoying
---
A greater pool of red ranks to be matched with rank 20s? /s
---
Seriously tho I hope this eases killer queue times.
---
yes they do glow, but its very faint, ive heard looking at the leg is the best place, but i only notice it in the shoulder shards
---
Just because you have 85 ping doesn’t mean the killer also has low ping. Sure the servers are dedicated but apparently hit register is still client sided which is completely bullshit so if this killer has 100 ping to server and you have 85 ping, hit register is effectively 185 ping difference
---
also confuses the hell out of any noob teammates you may have, speaking as someone who started the game a couple weeks ago and only just realized where the hell those random-ass firecrackers I saw came from
---
Piggy backing on other peoples responses to you. If you want to have an idea that the killer has a mori. Watch out for when the offerings show up right before the game loads. They all flip over one by one, but in certain cases, an offering won't flip over. If it is the furthest to the right, its usually the killers. If it doesn't flip, odds are it is a Mori. Play extra safe and try not to get found after getting hooked. Mori comes in three colors. Yellow -&gt; Can only Mori the last survivor still alive/in the game. Green -&gt; Can kill only ONE survivor that has been hooked once. Iradescent (Red) -&gt; Can kill any survivor that has been hooked once. They can kill every survivor with this.
---
Yeah, I’m glad that they keep improving it. Endgame collapse isn’t perfect, but it solved a lot of problems and is much better than the way it was before. Archives is a big step in the right direction too, as far as giving goals to work toward and keep the game feeling fresh.
---
AHHHH

Balanced

Use adrenaline it heals you and gives you a sprint burst

Personally i love balanced. I know you cant use it on every map but its still amazing

That's fine.  It's called "git gud"

people complain about instas and keys on here all the time, even flashlights.

not a single person ever mentions toolboxes which are bar none the strongest item in the game for survivors. if you see 2+ toolboxes you either bring some spicy shit or you lose.

I am dam sure BHVR knows, but if they agreed to it, that’d mean the game was fundamentally flawed and they’d have to change it with more than just another pig nerf and a cosmetic.

"The great thing is when it's part of a SWF and they all rage in end game chat and yet pretend they somehow won. Protip: when you're raging in end-game chat, you're showing that you expected to get all 4 out and that you didn't actually win shit cuz your bitchboy never left the hook."  
---
It's like the lottery, you don't say you won the Powerball when you got all the numbers right except for the Powerball.  Their behavior tells you they expected to have all the numbers right and when they rage at the end, that's not the sign of a win but the sign of a loss for them.  Their expectations was for a 0K and they rage when they don't get it.

3. I recently discovered people call her variations of "vomit mommy. "  
---
I don't find her annoying though, just don't cleanse until you're ready to open the gates. IF you need to cleanse, cleanse on the opposite side of the map to waste her time.
---
I thought smacking someone on the hook made their timer go down faster
---
"We take the hatchets like so and throw them like this."
---
With Sprint Burst, DS and a BNP.
---
Lol! Honestly when I first started playing, I thought when the offerings said "burning this offering does etc. Etc." Meant that I had to take the offering into a match, find one of the fire cans and do an action to burn it. -_-
---
I've tried both and I'm not a massive fan of Spine Chill, I see it work and everything but I like premonition telling me the direction the killer is so I can adjust. I'm also fairly new to the game so any tips on how to properly use Spine Chill is appreciated. They are both level 3.
---
I think balancing between solo and SWF is far more significant. The twins are leagues apart and yet a killer has to be able to not obliterate solo players but not shatter to pieces on front of SWF.
---
That's my response.  "You made it apparent that you wanted my undivided attention.  You got it.  Now you want to whine?  LOL"
---
Exactly. I love that perfect rank 16-ish where they're like "okay I got this now. I'm not good but I got my footing." Then some guy runs by as they pick up a survivor and they're like "ok?" Then explosions. 
---
Or you're working on a gen, survivor with you gets off and sends off a beam of light to the sky lmao

---
I disagree. Look at my previous example of League of Legends. If they balanced that game around the “average” then high level play would be complete chaos. The same philosophy should be applied here. Balance will be weighted towards the highest level because at that level everything is being used to its fullest potential. If you balance towards the average, then rank 1 players will be able to abuse it. Sure, it might not be the best for average players, but they can make balance weighted towards themselves by simply just getting better at the game.
---
i know this is for gamer tags but i wanted to tell a horrible story about a wraith player. 
---
so i spawn into the match and immediately my premonition goes off. i think to myself, “oh crap who could i be, so i look around and of course it’s the wraith. the one thing that threw me off is that he just left me alone, so i assumes he didn’t see me. i get the first gen done and another surv pops the second. by the point no one has been hit and i’m wondering if he’s afk... but that can’t be true cause i saw him walk around at the start... little did i know he had a scummy plan. so we finnaly pop all the gens and he’s still no where to be found. all four of us run to the exit gate but i get there first and i couldn’t touch it. i assumed it was lag to i just kept running towards it. that’s when i hear the bell... and he comes out if his cloak and downs me with no ed. he then proceeded to put me on a hook and face camp me. the end
---
Yes they have. They said it on stream. Peanits, to be exact.
---

---
Playing hunter is toxic PEPEGA
---
As he is, I literally cannot determine because he straight up doesn't seem to work as advertised.  I've had games where I get exposed through walls across the map and games where I have my face buried right up sexy sailor Steve' booty and he could not for the life him reveal me, and I've been on the recieving end of that too (games where I accidentally exposed him through solid objects and couldn't expose him from 5 feet away with his mask directly in the center of the screen).  His power is just so inconsistent and poorly implemented that I cannot determine his effectiveness.  He either needs a rework or they need to fix his power so that it's actually consistent.
---
They did say they’ll be able to punish DC’s once dedicated servers roll out.

That sucks :(

The problem is, imagine they made the gens take longer to do. It would make ruin that muh worse too deal with

---
Got called a hacker for playing prework Freddy and them not being able to see me.
---
Wasn't rank 20s either, was rank 5-7ish.
---
you probably made him shit him self lol
---
Oh come on man 90% of the players bought the dlc, its stupid that we cant have cosmetics because a minority
---
I'm still new and horrible but this for sure. I'll deal with the leaning curve.
---
Second killer game as trapper (thought you had to buy every killer but him) I finally caught someone and just stood there hitting them on hook until they were sacrificed, thinking I was winning lmfao :(((
---
I think you just have shit taste, sorry!
---
Why with all the exclamation marks?!
---
I think it's The Nun.
---
Oh okay, well I haven’t kept up to date with the game in a while so I didn’t know they were going to do dedicated servers.
---
No? https://i.imgur.com/n6iKivw.png
---
It is the act of using the point action as a survivor to get it to touch the snout of the pig.
---
Shitty "statistics". The game doesn't start until the first hook then it can easily avalanche in the killers favor. 
---
All they commented on is how the beginning of the game is easier for survivors...which it's SUPPOSED to be, as everyone is alive and there are lots of gens for options. Then it gets harder as the game goes on
---
At no point was this an argument or was I insulting you, idk why you’re taking it that way lol.
---
Do totems, noob.
---
The tome 4 challenges we saw are mostly placeholders.
---
It's also for Ruin, Devour Hope, and totem bp. Not to mention, they aren't just anti totem (My anti-totem farming build: Inner Strength, Small Game, Detectives Hunch [I love this perk now], Pharmacy)
---
play fun builds to rank 1 thats what i do.
---
You can spend them on some Halloween outfits for Trapper, Wraith, Hillbilly, Huntress, Doc, Hag, Spirit, Plague and Clown (I hope I got them all). 
---
Their outfits are 30 serums for a whole set or 10 for one piece, you can get them in the store. 
---
I don't know which survivors have these outfits available to them though
---
Also a remin that the *worst* killer, The Legion, has a kill rate of 50%
---
So if you play literally the worst killer there is, statistically you will still get a tie game.
---
*Right back at ya, buckaroo*
---
I never knew I wanted something so bad
---
Possibly but most of these guys have all purple perks from multiple characters and are using new characters like Nancy. Hell I’ve even gotten hate messages telling me I’m bad and to stop chasing them like sir you were teabagging behind a pallet of course imma hunt you down.
---
Got called bad at game cause let the 2 escape when the other 2 dced after i used Iridescent Axe Head on them...
---
W2C
---
Inaccurate, with today's queue times you can't even get in a game (s)
---
Oh.
---
I’ve had people know that I’m on that gen and camp at the bottom of the whole so when you jump down out of fear they are just waiting for you
---
Look up PainReliever’s guide on how to counter plague, I find it pretty effective .
---
Some players play naturally aggressive, while I’m not against that play style, different situations call for different methods of approach. I don’t think they should nerf or remove something just because it’s different.
---
I used to. Now I'm best friends with thicc Julie lol
---
Swf players would never find a game
---
They’ve been testing them on PC for a bit now. It’s slow going so I don’t expect consoles to get them anytime soon.
---
I’ve been saying this too. The Killers objectives are kill survivors AND stop generators from being done. Pop and discordance are god tier combo getting rid of both ruin and BBQ freeing up your builds of protecting totems
---
Same
---
I would like to see a couple things.
---
Gen speeds stay the same.  
---
Generators degenerate twice as fast when kicked.  
---
A Ruin and Pop nerf.  
---
note: This only works if it is done as a whole.  You can't nerf ruin without changing generators.
---
Come on, give us an original killer!
---
Teacher time plz. That dunce hat icon needs to be put to good use
---
I agree with you, but its pretty obvious they are probably just some casuals having fun. Not every game has to be taken super seriously with the best items and perks
---
I wish I could play trapper without ruin or corrupt, but I'd legit lose like 2-4 gens setting up and then actually beginning chases. It's ridiculous.
---
My first game as legion rank 10 I got a 4k. It felt great.
---
Lmao i had a Jane sabotage a hoom whilst i was carrying a David, yet i didnt complain...was a fun game
---
Oh my god, yes, yes yes, I love the idea of the teacher!!
---
He's pretty good but he needs some mobility options so he has better map pressure.
---
What's s the new bug? It didn't happened to me yet.
---
turn up your volume
---
Look through settings, it'll be under one of the tabs
---
You’re not going to like this but: deal with it. It’s not broken. It’s not every match. If you’re facing a killer with a mori, take your lumps and move on. The game isn’t supposed to feel evenly matched because it isn’t.
---
yes
---
Dude I mean in game my volume is fine I just want the music to be louder
---
so like every typical survivor then?
---
This right here is exactly what I’m saying. Beautifully put
---
me, I want shorter queue times.
---
Gotta love how your entire argument is based off of the pathetically assumed conjecture of "chase can easily last 80 seconds for a competent surv".
---
LOL.
---
Will NEVER happen
---
If you manage to make a chase last that long, your killer is just terribad.  There aren't enough loop/delay mechanics on your average random map for a surv to extend a chase that long.
---
Besides, killer would only be BL 5-6ish by then...
---
Stupid fake news is stupid.
---
Do it
---
In case you get two shitty rituals and can only skip one, and you get to stockpile 3 because not everyone plays daily so they can take a very short break and come back to some goals to do
---
How do you make these kinds of edits?
---
Head On, especially paired with DS. You can stun twice in a row and *possibly* get tunneled. Whenever I get DS I tunnel until I hook then don’t care who I down next
---
Yeah  thats what i meant fixed it thanks for noticing
---
Balanced landing. It's useful even while exhausted. After that I'd say dead hard, but honestly I consider it crap now with how many times I use it, get exhausted and go down anyways thanks to dedicated servers.
---
Can confirm. 
---
Ruin/Corrupt Intervention, BBQ, Nurse's Calling and Sloppy Butcher on Legion. Consistently get great games and lots of 4ks in purple ranks.
---
Thats my First edit, i used Photoshop :)
---
I run sloppy butcher, thana, nurses, and stridor so I can hear them super easy since they're going to be injured the whole game. Sometimes I'll switch out stridor for ruin or surveillance or discordance
---
this wasn't even when I was new, but one game I was doing the gen in the Gas Heaven garage. It took me about 5 seconds to realise that the figure crouching next to the gen wasn't a survivor, it was Pig.
---
No, they should balance it around all ranks at the same time. If a bad surv has no/little chance at escaping against an closely equally bad killer, then the game needs rebalancing.
---
(Im not stating if this is the case or not, its generally speaking)
---
If that’s the case then just up the Jane perk. Keeping it at 2 to have endurance w/o the deep wound tho would be top.
---
bold of you to think we will feel bad for someone who used an insta heal
---
Rip me, I play Xbox 😭
---
Oh shoot how’d you make them
---
Not everyone can be on Zubat level tough, you can't say killers with only a few hundred hours would be as good as a pro streamer that plays 40 hours a week on the regular and expect them to dont actually need ruin to do good.
---
Ruin is a savior for a lot of mid-low tier killers that NEED more preparation time to have a decent game or start getting some map pressure, like Myers, Hag, Trapper, Legion, etc.
---
Though it does feel dirty with actually decent killers like nurse, spirit or freddy, specially when their whole build is based around delaying gens because they are so experienced they dont need shit for chasing or finding survivors.
---
You ever just jump a window and 3 seconds later you lag backwards being picked up
---
Sometimes I wonder if its a difference in fps. Could it be that both of you have different screen positions because of difference in fps? Perhaps he was gaming at a higher fps therefore, in his screen he was in good position to hit you. Idk.
---
I have not once in 2000+ hours of killer gameplay camped or ran noed. Noed I find useless as I don't let matches get to end game 99% of the time, so wasted perk slot. And despite what people may think, camping is a terrible strategy to to ensure a win. Though ruin is a necessary evil unfortunately.
---
I love this
---
Balanced landing  -  this is the best exhaustion perk in the game if you get the right map beacause you can make certian areas infinites(e.g: disturbed ward, haddonfield ect), if you get a map like shelter woods it is almost useless, i would reccommend but it is relatively inconsistent.
---
Adrenaline - an extremely consistent exhaustion perk, it heals you and gives you a speed boost, although only once this takes alot of pressure away from the killer and can singlehandedly win you games sometimes.
---
Head on - a meme perk but in a certian builds can make the killer usseless to what they try and do, in a swf this can be a very fun perk to get head on saves with.
---
Lithe - a consistent exhaustion perk, this perk is decent and unremerkable, paired with dance with me and Quick and quiet this perk can help you lose the killer very easily
---
Sprint burst - this perk has become meta as of late due to it being the best perks to stay injured with and it helping get gens done faster (less time getting to genarators) this perk is consistent and can be 99ed (keeping your exhaustion at 99% and after walking for 1 second you can get the speed boost again), this is an overall great perk.
---
Dead hard - i know you said you dont want to use this anymore but it seems like you are using it wrong, it is still a great perk but you are not using it to its full potential, the best way to use Dead hard (in my opinion) is to use it to get to a pallet or window, you dont use it to bait out a lunge attack, good killers will just bait the dead hard and kill you instantly.
---
Overall the best exhaustion perk to me is Balanced landing, the second best is dead hard and the third is sprint burst. the most fun exhaustion perk is Head on and the worst one (in my opinion) is lithe although it is an exhaustion perks so it is still good.
---
I agree with that
---
Bleed out 4 minutes.
---
Hook time is 1 minute per stage.
---
Wiggle takes around 12 secs without iron grasp, you can do the math with IG.
---
This is beyond broken.
---
Toxic tunneling is constantly picking up a recently unhooked survivor, which is what a wraith and a half did to me yesterday. Just trying to get my archives. I generally play killer more but I’m even
---
adrenaline is a 1 time use perk that may not even get used though, it is still amazing but i would reccommend other perks o use other exhaustion perks with this one.
---
Let's play a game...
---
Literally my reaction when survivors follow me not doing gens.
---
Survivors are too proud to lose even 1 survivor. They want the killer to feel like such a shit and then when they get assraped, they dc and cry
---
Rip
---
Imagine complaining about bbq in 2019
---
I agree to an extent, but I do think that for a game with no professional esports scene, you can’t simply balance for the top 1% of players if the rest of the player base is struggling. That makes no sense from a revenue perspective, because if most of your player base isn’t enjoying the game, they’ll stop playing and kill the game as a whole. 
---
I do think that what this conversation has accomplished though is giving us all an idea of all of the nuances that BHVR has to put serious thought into in order to accomplish game balance. Obviously they won’t please everyone, but to keep their game alive, they do need to make the majority of people happy, which, judging from this entire thread, they aren’t lol.
---
Tl;dr
---
If they had an esports scene to support the game, then balance toward the top tier players. Since they don’t, they can’t.
---
balanced landing.
---
SAME, was gonna post about it too
---
The Undetectable status prevents auras from being seen,  not perks from lighting up.
---
Now I'm gonna feel bad when I go against her well the non toxic Claudettes that is.
---
I dont use that it isnt that good tbh, it takes 2 perk slots and depending on the loop you can counter it by simply throwing the pallet down early
---
First thing I did after reading her lore was confirm to my bf she is indeed autistic lol
---
This is pretty much how I feel after a demo game. I love the guy but experienced survivors dumpster him.
---
and?
---
Thanks this honestly helps so much if people counted like me when they’re in said role
---
When you read the title and it says NOT OC so I cited them
---
Extra extra
---
you use it to gain distance though, thats the most efficcient way to use it.
---
So is the overall problem to do with every other killer not being viable, or the overall layout of the maps making the other killers not viable?
---
I don’t think the problem directly lies within the spirit and nurse being overpowered. I just feel like the other characters aren’t powerful enough.
---
(Most of them are literally useless against a good SWF)
---
I still say BHVR should enable in game chat and just balance the game around the thought that everyone can communicate. Instead of how they currently balance the game around the idea of how the game is supposed to be played in their eyes where nobody can communicate outside of perks.
---
It’s me citing the OP cuz I didn’t wanna make it to where I say it’s not OC but people get mad cuz I didn’t cite them
---
a bit overkill for such a minor thing, dont you think? 2magine would be still too strong
---
That’s quite disappointing

Yeah the cooldown would be 80/70/60 seconds
---
Devs might spout some bs about the blood point economy, but it’s just BhVR being greedy in my opinion. This game is a serious grind fest and also “Welcome To Dead By Daylight” 
---
Many, many more wonders await you as you dive deeper into the fog &amp; BhVR Interactive...
---
What a detailed and thoughtful reply.  I'm amazed you're receiving down votes.
---
Jk the person you replied to is right in almost every way. Once you've played enough, you realize how easy it is to waste a killers time and pretty much run the show. Add in SWF on comms and the match is basically a meme unless you're going against the top 1% of killers, or those SWF are newbies.
---
What in the horribly unbalanced game is this?
---
Hahaha 😂 😂 😂 I had to do it to him!!!!
---
&gt; This “kills don’t matter” mentality of yours is ridiculous. 
---
It’s not ridiculous when that’s the rules the Devs set in the first place. If you don’t pip, you don’t progress. Players want progression.
---
&gt; Red rank survivors can be completely braindead as well, it’s hard to argue either side as I’ve seen just as many rank 20’s in red ranks as I have strong loopers.
---
Okay. But Red Rank SWF fully Meta’d are the hardest things for a killer to counter. And when you encounter a full SWF lobby, only 3 killers have potential of getting a pip. Those killers are Spirit, Nurse and Billy. And right now, you’re pretty much only seeing Spirit. Why? Because she’s the only viable killer. And that’s a problem.
---
im playing on my phone and its.... idk how anyone can loop. cant even imagine what its like as a killer
---
I used to, with my old mouse since it had amazing thumb buttons, but it broke so I'm trying to save up for the same model of mouse, since it was great, and comfortable and definitely improved how I experienced the struggle phase
---
&gt;It's the inevitable problem of a co-op game where players have little to no communication with each-other. There's no way of knowing the skill level of your allies or what they're doing mid match.
---
Farming doesn't help either.  You come across a lvl 5 player who is actually really bad once they actually are in a competitive match.
---
This usually happens to me too, usually all iridescent pips too which gets me confused
---
You heard the man, Your not Unique...
---
So next time just tunnel him all game and run 1 perk....
---
I've double pipped more as legion than as Huntress. 
---
This is embarrassing, because I'm a Huntress main.
---
"I just ran past the ruin totem.."
---
What a horror show
---
Given how your post is written, you couldn't be objective if your life depended on it.  
---
That said, anyone who thinks SWF w/comms is not OP, I challenge you to go look at all the survivor perks and see which ones become totally or partially obsolete because of SWF w/comms.    
---
In some cases, SWF w/comms outperforms a perk.  In others, it's roughly equivalent.  And with others, you get some similar but not quite as good benefit.   
---
I have about 90-95% of all survivor perks and when I went through the list I counted 17 that could be totally or partially achieved using SWF.  If you even take half that number, that means SWFs are essentially going into a game with 12-13 perks vs a solo ques' 4 perks.    
---
The easiest fix to this is to make voice comms native to the survivor game and then balance the killer against that.  You are deceiving yourself (or just ignorant) if you pretend that killer is currently balanced against solo ques and SWFs.  
---
example:  
---
Bond -  Unlocks potential in one's Aura-reading ability.
---
Allies' [Auras](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Auras) 📷 are revealed to you when they are within a range of **20**/**28**/**36** metres.  
---
With SWF w/comms, everyone simply states where they are on the map at all ranges.    
---
example 2:  
---
Alert -  
---
 Your acute senses are on high alert.
---
When the Killer performs a break action, their [Aura](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Aura) 📷 is revealed to you for **3**/**4**/**5** seconds.  
---
With SWF w/comms you can say, "Hey, I just threw the God pallet and Killer broke it, he chased me up to the boat and I broke the pallet on the top floor.  The one downstairs is still there."  Again, you can actually provide more info than the perk gives.  
---
Just about anything involving an aura can instead just be described in comms and to more exacting detail.  "I got the chest in the basement.  I traded my flashlight for a med pack.  I passed another chest in the cornfield right by the shack but couldn't stop to loot it."  So not only does this tell me which chest has been looted/not looted and where they're at but whether there's something still in it even if it has been looted.  
---
Other shit not covered by perks but providing a decided advantage would be something along the lines of, "I looted a purple key from a chest and Huntress hit me Franklin's by the entrance to the barn next to the pallet."  
---
Do you seriously believe that wouldn't affect the outcome of a game?
---
i love the casual swipe followed by a furious roar
---
Windows store = xbox but i think this one for pc version ( not really sure )
---
You can't always control this when you're playing solo though, that's the problem.
---
Nurse is literally feast or famine now. If you never miss blinks? You're fine. Miss a blink? You lose a gen.
---
We already have a half-blind killer with restricted vision, its Freddy. Cant see shit with that dream world filter. Dont want to be any more blind

---
Insidious bubba intensifies
---
You could not be more wrong
---
IIRC it's the bug where you can rotate the killer around in a lobby
---
She really isnt that bad the entire point of her is you cant tell shes using her poer
---
&gt; Promise + Repentance
---
Ho boy. Because of the BP bonus you can be sure that's going to be used for griefing.
---
they don't hate the perk, they hate that people who use it tend to just hide from the killer and not help anyone
---
A lot of people have been making this point. The solution here is for the killer in question to put more hours into the game to get better. Balancing shouldn’t lean towards these players because they’re worse at the game, that doesn’t make sense. And before anyone says “It’s bullshit to expect this from players, not everyone has the time,” I consistently hit rank 1 while being a full time student and only playing an hour or two a day. It’s not hard people, just get better instead of expecting BHVR to balance the game in your favor
---
Thats basically just a wendigo from until dawn
---
If you honestly have this mentality you probably aren't as good at the game as you think. There are streamers like Scottjund/ZubatLEL who run all the killers in the game without ruin/NOED and constantly get 4ks. People really need to learn how to run maps and tiles more effectively as killer.
---
The perk itself is fine, it's just that there's a subset of players who will use it to crouch walk around the map playing completely immersed, doing absolutely nothing the entire game.
---
Rank reset. They're duoweekly
---
I just find it odd that they don’t use the Ritual system to reward daily players like most games do. Why should we have to wait 3 days for a full set, or wait even more rerolling them into bounties we like to do.  It just feels like to works against the players who keep this game alive
---
Oh please that's like complaining about BNP in this day and age, they got nerfed move on
---
Survivor: "I'm tired of facing nothing but Billy, Nurse, and Spirit. Whine blah blah screech cry."
---
Killer: *plays Plague*

Thank you so much! ❤️
---
Care to share where you came up with this number?
---
What if they make a separate mode that’s actually dependent on rank so a rank 10 and lower cannot match with a rank 1, and at higher ranks have a ban system to ban certain perks of the players choosing, so the survivors would have to vote on the perks and the killer can just choose which to ban
---
She's been implied to be autistic since her initial release, I'm just glad they're providing more evidence.
---
**scrumptious**
---
I think I've just grown to like Claudette
---
Imagine taking the good joke out of context just to insult someone for playing their favorite killer
---
This always happens to me
---
Disagree on Freddy just because it’s easy to see survivors when they are asleep
---
Not sure if it's still the case, but he was the "default" survivor character, so naturally new players were more likely to play him. New players are more likely to be...immersed.
---
Object of Obsession, the Laurie perk that lets you and the killer see eachother through walls
---
The only problem I have with that is that low ranks would be a fucking nightmare with that setup.
---
leave the baby dweets alone 😤😤😤
---
i sure doubt the number of people who have bought every DLC/Character is 90%
---
I'm so sick of survivors (and killers) using the word "unfun" as if fun was this objective truth. Some people find the dynamic of not cleansing to deny her a power to be fun. 
---
Sadly, the waaah brigade is going to disconnect in fury until the devs bend over. Again.
---
Literally everyone who played him in red ranks.
---
Honestly Michael is the only killer I dont get mad a at Camping, because his skill is stalk. So Him being within Eye view of the hook so he can stalk the person saving, sorta makes sense. 
---
But let me phase it this way, there a different between Stalking from a distance with a view of the Hook as a tactic to get stalk, and a killer standing 2 feet from the hook watching you die who being a cunt
---
It's similar to self-care. It attracts newer players/casual players into thinking that being stealthy, which works better being healthy, is the best way to play all the time. The problem with this is that stealth is only part of the gameplay. Knowing how to hold chase is a big part of the game and these perks basically discourage learning that part. 
---
Know for players that can loop and understand the pace of the game, these perks are fine actually, especially in a SWF.
---
I've been rocking fixated, self care, sprint burst and decisive. I've noticed I rarely use decisive so I've been thinking of using urban instead. Its come in handy quite a bit. Walk and creep faster, never have to leave scratch marks and if killer finds me sprint burst out of there and if I get injured I'm able to heal myself if I cant find anybody.  Urban and fixated have grown on me tbh.
---
But if you do one level per day you will get to level 70 without doing any challanges.
---
its the same that OoO doesnt highlight his aura, but the perk still lights up
---
As you climb the rank as killer, you have to employ high level tactics, like moon walking, hiding the red stain, and double-triple backs.
---
Once you get to rank 1, the most unpredictable tactic is to just run straight at them, and follow them around the loop exactly as a rank 20 would, but just tighter on the walls.
---
Totally causes salt.
---
What they said
---
You should nerf ruin, and make generators repair time longer instead. 
---
Ruin is no big obstactle for high rank survivors, but it sucks for low ranks... Doing gens longer in general would be much fairer
---
Ancient map offerings that are no longer in the game
---
Being that she's a ghost i don't think that would work out very well
---
I’ve only been blinded properly once with those, most of the time it’s just like “sizzle pop pop pop” and I have to look around to see what survivor even dropped the damn thing. survivors seem to try and use them for saves but it ends up just blowing up behind me every time
---
The same way the devs modeled a human face under the Pig's mask.
---
Michael as eyes, and The pig has a face
---
You're both still idiots. This entire community has played the victim card so hard that it makes me sick to my stomach, yet each side acts as if the other is somehow "worse". Too bad the other guy blocked you. You deserve each other.
---
Do you know what they did
---
It's just range now, omega was range, speed and charge time in one.
---
Sometimes I wonder why self-care and ruin aren't just default at this point. Everyone runs them.
---
for survivors, any combination of:
---
Balanced Landing/Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, Adrenaline, and Unbreakable
---
for killers, any combination of:
---
Hex: Ruin, Hex: No One Escapes Death, Pop Goes the Weasel, Barbecue &amp; Chili, and Enduring + Spirit Fury
---
Cuz the perk cancels out the  effect of having 2 people on the gens. So its 80/2 = 40?
---
I'm a killer main who doesn't use Ruin, and arent I just so special? 
---
I'm not like other killers, you see. I'm a precious and unique snowflake and *truly*, you all just need to get on my level.
---
But it gives you endurance which is better imo
---
take you to a map
---
Gg piece of shit
---
Deleted?
---
This seems like the most obvious cosmetic choice for him. They didn't very commonly change the glove in the movies. But, we've got Jackie Earle Haley's Freddy in DBD. I'm guessing we can't have Robert Englund's stuff.
---
The cow tag is coldwind and the blinds are for mcmillian or autohaven
---
honestly bro they should raise gen repair times to two minutes each, then nerf ruin to 1/2/3 but just remove it stopping progress, so the bar goes down but just keeps going.
---
What laptop is that? I'm looking for a decent gaming one as I don't really have the room for a desktop

Generators with one person takes 80 seconds to do with no buffs with a speed of 1.0 c/s. Two people it takes 44.44 seconds with a total speed of 1.8 c/s (source: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators)
---
With a 10% buff on both people, the combined speed is now 1.98 (1.80 +0.18), and therefor takes about 40 seconds to do (source: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Prove_Thyself) 
---
30 seconds requires a speed more like 2.5 c/s, that estimation is WAY off.
---
Her next move is not a mystery. She's going to either follow scratch marks/sounds or pre-emptively go to the nearest window/pallet that she think you'll be going to. So you have to think outside the box and be unpredictable.
---
Her glass shard horns are gigantic so I would assume they would have a prominent glow, but I haven't faced many blighted spirits as of yet to test this.

They wouldn't stack.

Sorry bud, I’ve hit red ranks with both sides and never use ruin because I don’t like relying on something so much I can’t play without it. I do perfectly fine applying pressure. Just because one perk is popular because it’s strong doesn’t mean it’s the only or best way to play. Good job assuming I’m a rank 16, just what I’d expect from reddit
---
Oh, c'mon, just let me whine a little after failing to find those immersed Claudettes on Yamaoka that vanished as I came to check their gen. Really invisible on that map.
---
They should just increase the time to repair gens as you increase in rank/if you verse SWF
---
What's worse is when you do get to stay home but are treated like an enemy of the state.
---
I REALLY enjoy playing against plague. Who are the people hating on her???
---
10%* faster, and gets to drain their power on a normal attack. They're even better than you mentioned
---
I’ve never seen anyone post it sorry, also it might help to get the devs to notice
---
"A suprise but a welcome one"
---
Claudette’s are something else tho, no one came to her parties because they couldn’t find her at school
---
Yeah, but then you can run perks like discordance or surveillance, or you can just listen for the sound of gen repairs when you phase up close and m1 on collision with a survivor
---
I thought about maining Legi............oh no.
---
Don't hat the character hate the player
---
Sure I can do that just not rn I'm not home
---
framerate so it just looks like that
---
Most of this stuff is entirely stupid.  It's one of the reasons identity V is much better. 
---
If they make gens any longer it's a grind and boring for survivors at that point . Most of the killeers/survivors in this game are horribly designed . They dont make them balanced.  Identity V you way more pallets , you have 2 sprint bursts that dont run on exhaustion. You can stun the killer way more but killers are able to keep up. Why because killers are balanced very well to handle most situations.  Also survivors are balanced for their strengths and their weaknesses . Someone who is good at wasting the killers time generally is terrible st doing gens and whatnot.   Meanwhile people who can do gens may be terrible at escaping .
---
It  really has nothing to with the gen speed.  Just a very basic game.  There is 1 survivor and however many killers
---
He used it correctly. OP is the salty one for face camping 1 survivor thus intentionally losing the game so that 1 survivor dies while the others escape. OP’s meme is actually a little cringe since he thinks he’s pulling 1 over on em
---
What is this from?
---
I used to just leave people on hook.
---
Imagine, if you wish, to be so stubborn as to ignore the joke and shit on a person's "choice" of killer just to feel better about yourself. They didn't even say they were playing Spirit, they just made a joke.
---
They know, they are not going to try and get any licensed think from the craven estate. It’s too much legal trouble and money for cosmetics that probably wouldn’t sell enough to break even
---
Why do they call them meta though?
---
So no cosmetics for Freddy then? XD
---
Now that is an interesting idea.

---
Have you closed and restarted the game recently? Or just gone from sleep mode back into the game?
---
Especially on Hag I get something similar, and it seems worse with certain outfits (e.g. the recent blight stuff). There's a memory leak or something in there that builds up over time.
---
“...what a rush!”
---
You’re on the right track with Ruin/ CI, sloppy, BBQ, but I recommend STBFL as your 4th.  It’s very underrated on m1 killers and Demo is exactly that at its core.  IMO nurse’s can come up as overkill if you use your portals to locate survivors and set up your network well.  Make your choice can work very well also due to how quickly you can get away from a hooked survivor.
---
Thank you, take your free snoot boops 🐽
---
I’ll only play with PC players if they have a controller connected.
---
I think both NoED and Adrenaline needs to be removed because they both reward bad gameplay, but then again I’m just a person that plays both killer and survivor so I don’t really have a favorite side. I’m sure this comment is going to get downvoted to hell too because I said something anti-killer, like every other semi anti-killer comment
---
It's always a Laurie, too
---
When almost every map has unmindgameable loops that go one right into another or infinites like groaning storehouse and suffocation pit an chase can easily last 80 seconds. Couple that with perks like lithe, dead hard, balanced and sb and chases are extremely easy for survivors. The killer completely relies on the survivor making a mistake.
---
bonk
---
Then what is DS for? But complaining about survivors doing gens is just as stupid as when a survivor gets pissed at a killer for defending totems and shit.
---
F\*ck kobes, they're stupid, but the worst thing is when you have active Delivarance.
---
The problem is communication counters them. And BHVR still balances the game around the idea that survivors can’t use voice comms.
---
When I play on ps4 I’m invited to a private chat 9 times out of 10 in red ranks even with all randoms because it’s just that easy to do.
---
He’s already got the best Freddy claw. Imo Freddy is fine how he is.
---
Yeah, it's more interesting on survivor side. What is a really important difference about that game, is while team work obviously helps immensly, but there is only one objective (killing the killer) that absolutely requires it. If you're good, you can get by on your own. You can fix the phone yoursefl, you can fix the car/boat yourself, or you can simply survive the time limit (20 minutes). Again, if you have the skills. But what's crucial about that is that it reduces frustration immensly if your team is not so good. You just say "fuck it, I'm lone wolfin this one" and you can do it. Not so much in DBD unless you get the hatch at the end which is more RNG than skill based.
---
I love urban evasion, great for stealth, and great for juking the hell out of a killer in a chase
---
Aha fatal flaw in your plan, 😊 3 genning is against dA RuLeZ 😯😡😡😡🤬 not aloud 😑☝️
---
So proud of this angel.
---
LOL i would not be shocked if he has windows xp
---
I’ve been trying to level up all survivors and getting their teachables and I’m working on Nea now and really liking urban. I might swap out DS for fixates as well because I usually don’t get a chance to use it. Maybe 1 out of 10 times.
---
Got called a tunneling camper for punishing over-altruism with Bubba's Chainsaw
---
I vaguely recall the devs talking about having Kindred be added base, but it's just a case of coding and working out what Kindred would be replaced with etc.
---
Rly? We need Slenderman ofc (dont look at him or this game gets ugly) \^\^
---
It seems like a worse haunted grounds
---
It’s not a big issue until survivors start D/C’ing on plague like they do Spirit, then the dev will think she’s “overperforming” and make nerfs accordingly. 
---
After spirit though it’s probably Ghostface.
---
Yeah but for real aiming is a part of the game dude
---
If being the highest rank possible isnt even considered an accomplishment at this point, then if anything that just proves even more that balancing shouldn’t favor lower ranks
---
*Lo-Fi Spirit noises and glass crackling to study/relax to*
---
TBH i feel the same way
---
Leave Plague alone!
---
I play with Haunted Grounds, Thrill of the Hunt, Ruin, and Discordance. 
---
You're entitled to your opinion, but if holding M1 ruins the game for you, maybe you should play another game instead of having an irrational hatred of people who play a perfectly reasonable killer. It's not like it's Insidious Bubba.
---
Each DC's corpse should be basically a BPS. lol
---
One last puff before your last hook?
---
Alienware 15 R3, only cost me $1,200CAD
---
Hmmm potentially but the damage is done
---
Plague is the one that’s kinda taking over this week. Spirit hate is still there but it isn’t as prominent due to being overstated. If people start complaining about Ghostface, that’s where the line gets drawn. Counter play is as simple as looking at him.
---
Especially green. Its there that survivors start going against decent killers and they begin losing more often. In the yellow and grey ranks survivors get way too comfortable fighting baby killers.
---
Maybe play killer sometime instead of being a survivor main.
---
They took you to certain maps like the green ones do, but instead of making it a 100% chance it would just make it more likely. I’ve got them for basically all maps that existed before they were removed on my Dwight cuz I levelled him so long ago.
---
Because they are the best perks to have in most situations.
---
So how do you run away without using pallets?
---
I totally agree, the average rank of your group should determine the number of GENS needed to escape. like 16-20 is 4, 11-15 is 5, 6-10 is 6 and 1-5 is 7... now go get em'!
---
SHOCKING! Scientists recently found that some survivors are posting FAKE BOOPS! What happens next will kill you!
---
Ya I saw the Alienware logo after posting this. I've heard that for them you're paying for the brand and little else.
---
Where are you getting the baseline 10% from? AFAIK kicking a gen doesn't cause any amount of regression on its own, it just starts the process.
---
Well said. I agree.
---
Seeing you use the word "triggered" i can see your a whiny killer main.
---
Don't cry when they're rubbing their ass at the gate baby killer.
---
... My reply is towards the OP
---
The Kindred thing was just an example. It would need to supply solos with all information SWF would have
---
crossplay is hopefully coming for all platforms, what are you on about?
---
The complaints with Ghostface is with “that build”, where you don’t go for stalking and just play the game with no terror radius and constantly injuring survivors. You’ll see a few streamers use it, to great success.
---
Yep along with that we missed all cosmetic drops and shrines since then
---
It's not just aim.  It's hard to moonwalk and hide light as you cant turn nearly as quickly with a controller.  Similar thing with checking left and right looking for survivors or crows as you run through an area.
---
that looks like a really tough pose to draw but it looks like you nailed it really well! i think it looks great!
---
How often do you play though? I'm at 25 and play almost daily. But, I do spend a lot of that time waiting for survivors games.
---
And it probably is fine. I'm not really pressed about getting all of it and it may very well be a fine pace. Just wanted to see some opinions.
---
This is my \#1 most wanted chapter.
---
Very old but i think it's still relevant (the message anyway)
---
I enjoy the idea that Legion (at least Frank) injected themselves because they’re kinda junkies; not knowing what the serum is or does.
---
Yeah, this is ridiculous. I just quit playing when I saw that. They expect us to just play the game day-in and day-out to farm relic shards, and then say that if we don't do this fast enough, we're going to miss out on the one good thing in the free track of the Rift.
---
Wait, it really takes 80 seconds to finish one generator with no perks/add-ons and one survivor working on it? I counted a few times and I got 45ish seconds. The hell?
---
I don’t get why they can’t even touch a generator
---
Right now rank is more a measure of games played than it is an indicator of true skill.
---
Any even partially competent survivor knows what they need to do to get points. 
---
I know I need to do one or two gens, I know I need  get at least one or two saves. I know I should try to search a chest or pop a totem. I know I should try to drag out a chase. 
---
Even if I get sacrificed I’ll probably pip every game and if I play enough games, I’ll get to rank 1
---
This will trigger so many survivor mains that rage quit vs spirit
---
New ultra rare cosmetic, it changes the song too!
---
I’m not here to say that everyone should be like me but something that can help is changing this mindset. If you go into every game thinking you “lost” or “won” you’ll be stressed out much more. If I leave the game and had fun it was okay even if I didn’t kill everyone. 
---
Most of the time I’ll let people farm with me if I made it clear I could’ve killed them all and I just meme around. It’s much more fun playing like that (rank 5 killer if that matters to anyone)
---
Whattt? Any killer that doesn't run Ruin gets a plus from me instantly.
---
Ye. It’s because that’s all he has. Stalking with Ghostface is unreliable because triggering corner peaking is dicey on some maps and requires you to stay hidden. In the time you spent stalking you could’ve hooked them. His strength is in no terror radius. (Spine chill makes this strategy iffy though)
---
Calm your tits. Did i say it is not coming on other platforms ?
---
Not the first person to ask this, and certainly won't be the last. FREDDY CRUSADE!! MARCH!!!!!
---
Same! I definitely prefer the non-cleansers over the ones cleansing all the time. I’m almost always in a chase once I get started and I don’t want to stop off and get corrupt and risk losing them.  And survivors should just play immersed once the plague has corrupt  - then she doesn’t get the chance to use her power.
---
I mean... Just a little
---
For me I play like every killer because of a ritual or I just want and still I’m somehow better with legion. I feel you my bro :(.
---
I decided I wanted to play a match before classes, and waited 45 minutes. By that time, I had to just cancel the matchmaking and go to class. Love this piece of shit we all love to play.
---
What did you get for points? 32k?
---
Is it weird that I only really enjoy low rank? I'm decent at the game. Better at killer than I am at survivor, but no matter what I'm never gonna be Otzdarva. At lower rank everybody is around my skill level. Games are casual, both survivors and killers make dumb blunders that shake things up. At high ranks in games I always have way less fun. If I play killer, a lot of survivors are god tier at dodging me because I'm fairly casual, and if I play survivor, killers are sometimes like bloodhounds with how fast they get me. I feel as though there's this glass ceiling that you have to suddenly start training to break through, and at that point I find it stressful, not fun. 
---
In other games it's different. In Destiny for example, quickplay is connection based matchmaking, while comp is skill based. I'm way more than casual in that game, but when I want to relax my focus and just play a game, it's nice to be able to opt out of the high tier shit that is comp. 
---
Another thing is that it's *skill* based matchmaking, not rank based like DBD. You can suck harder than a Dyson and still be in high rank games if you've played enough.
---
This is the same with me. The perks I usually run are ruin to slow the game down, just a lil bit, whispers for the tracking, bbq and discordance. I should probably run thanatophobia instead of something like whispers but I haven't leveled up nurse bec i can't play her
---
Thanatophobia isnt even that good on plague. It just delays gen speed a little. Much better on legion because it delays healing and gen speed
---
I had I game today where survivors did gens so fast I had the tightest 3 gen ever. They got so mad haha knuckleheads
---
I wish I had teammates like you. I had two teammates who farmed me and wouldnt heal me. Then when they did they spam missed skill checks to reveal me. Safe to say I killed myself after my first hook.
---
I mean, the Graphics Card and RAM are really good. I haven’t had any of the usual problems with Alienware (overheating, battery swell, etc) so it’s all just depending on what you like.
---
I got mine $600 less than normal price, and I thought that was pretty fair for a Sale. I’ve had it for 2 years with no issue other than my HDD failing in October, but that was an easy upgrade to an SSD. 
---
As much hate as Alienware gets I’ve had good luck with it.
---
The problem is the devs keep adding alternate objectives and everyone hates them. People complain about constantly healing against legion, snapping out of it against doc, doing side objectives during events, etc. Anything that takes away from doing gens, people complain about. I dunno if that's the solution...
---
Myers with the Tombstone Piece, J Myers Memorial, Monitor Abuse and Tinkerer on Lerys Memorial Institute is the scariest fucking thing in DBD. 
---
You will be sat doing a gen and Mike suddenly appears with no heartbeat, you are grabbed and instakilled, then he disappears and kills everyone else in the same way.
---
Dump points into her but leave her in the stable. It's what I did.
---
Oh shit my bad lmao
---
Myers tiers up multiple times
---
probably a durex ad, I got this from a random video talking about trolls and celebrities lol
---
Ye. You’d be better off using Dying light, but that’s just me. Now if you stack them, that’s where some real impacts can be made. But the bottom line is, that’s their decision. They decided to stay injured by not cleansing, so they deal with the form of counter-play they’ve chosen.
---
"Oh come on my team ignored totems a designed way to slow gens down. Ugh. Who would have thought."
---
I don't and it's just a joke so chill
---
This. Just, this.
---
I play at red ranks and I see at least 5 rainbow maps each day
---
Oh okay I see, thanks for the explanation
---
*Ash smirking at his puppet hand*
---
gesundheit
---
I use to stand in the basement to get boldness points
---
Same. Console. Every time I was playing killer and it went to the offering screen, I auto switched to this screen. I’d load into the match and it would say “player disconnected while loading in blah blah” but didn’t show a DC sign by anyone.
---
I just hit rank 7 and I can’t loop to save my life lol
---
Outside of bloodhunts, the cap is 224.000. 
---
Base points = 32.000
---
BBQ or WGLF = 32.000
---
5x Party streamers = 5x32.000 = 160.00
---
Total = 224.000
---
Teabagging rate drops to 0%
---
It takes 80 seconds with one person and prove thyself cancels out the time lost with a second person on the gen hence why the bar is not green or red. If the gen took 30 seconds with two people and prove thyself the bar would be green.
---
Im gonna get downvoted bc of this (Have before, even though its just a bunch of people that dont know what they are talking about)
---
SB is technically the best exhaust perk when used at high lvl play. i personally use BL but if you know how to use SB then you know its the best.
---
Yeah say anything you want, you can't judge my skill just 'cause i post a screenshot of someone saying facts. It's easy as a redditer to see other people reasonably complain and tell em to get gud. Also saying Zubat or Otz exist don't change anything. They are talented players, but not everyone is like them and many killers are average. So try to see further than the edge of your noise. There's a ton of maps that are unbalanced in this game where people can lose the killer or easily create infinites, aka Lampkin Lane or Coldwind farm. There's also a good amount of un-mindgamable or safe loops that survivors can use at their adventage to waste the killer a lot of time. Also, the biggest problem is swf. At red ranks, you can get insanely coordinated teammates who are very very familiar with looping, knowing the vault and flashlight angles, use sound or visual cues to locate the killer, and hitting skillchecks. While one can occupy the killer for a minute if he got enough tools such as Exhaustion perks/pallets/windows, either the killer chase them for minute if they are talented or they don't commit and go out. But either way, there's always 3 people working on generators. The worst thing for a killer is knowing there's 3 people working on separate gens and he cannot do any shit about it.
---
There are many elements that the Survivors can use such as items or map offerings that make it easier for them. Unless you are Nurse/Spirit/Curve Billy/Freddy/A very trained Huntress on a good map (well, an actual viable killer), you need to rely on survivors' mistakes to get them. So the case is even worse for low tier killers such as Legion, Doctor or Pig. Even a very experimented killer, according to the tiles and the tools that the Survivor that he's chasing has in hand, know how much time it's gonna take to take them down.
---
Meanwhile, you are just getting your knees hot and bring your proud ass here to get good. What a clown you are. I hope you have pretty good arguments to say that killers got the power role in this game 🤷
---
GeT GuD
---
It really only works if you have a mouse wheel that can actually roll, so you just flick it and it will go for a while on its own.  If your mouse can't do that then binding it to mouse wheel is a bad idea
---
Is the Xbox version just fucking awful for you as well? Random NAT errors (my NAT is always open, so not me), couldn’t connect to host errors, or my favourite “an unknown error has occurred”. 
---
Then I sometimes get stuck in an infinite searching for lobby. Can’t back out and it never finds a lobby.
---
Oh and so many face campers compared to PC.
---
That plus challenges make me fucking unreasonably angry
---
Ahh classic feng move
---
I stopped playing for about half a year because sometimes I would be waiting about 90 mins for a survivor game, and 30 for a killer. Since coming back about a week ago I'm able to find a match within five minutes without fail. Whatever they've done, it's been a godsend for me.
---
I used to think Deja Vu was actually a great perk to use as a survivor. After playing for over a year and watching people like Otz, Puppers and Monto, I am ashamed.
---
Whatever they've done its been a fucking game break for me
---
I love playing Freddy with devour hope, easily my favorite killer
---
Considering I’ve been rank 1 on both sides nearly every reset since beta I think that my opinion holds some value. Even trapper doesn’t NEED ruin, it’s just a massive help. The only scenario in which the argument that nearly every killer needs ruin is if we assume every red rank match is against optimal survivor teams which is hardly the case.
---
It's 800 XP per fragment, and 10 fragments per level. Using challenges from the Archives, you can level up more quickly, but I usually get about 550 XP per game. There's an additional 300 XP for each the first survivor and killer games per day.
---
Ok thank you very much! I appreciate it :)
---
Reminds me when I unhooked myself and right as where I landed the hatch spawned and opened.
---
When I got back into playing killer it was repetitive merciless victories but after I got to purple killer I can hardly kill 2
---
48 seconds if another survivor is also working on the Gen.
---
Whatever happens, if no items, no perks are used, you spend 80 seconds alone on a single gen.
---
GeT gOOd Soy Boy.
---
I'd say leave Ruin regression as it is, just remove the downtime when gen can't be repaired after good skillcheck. This is the thing that irritates me the most about Ruin and it's not even mentioned in perk's description. So when you hit good, it just regresses by 5% and you keep repairing.
---
Yes but you should have a great idea of where the killer is based on where the generator is. Unless your generator is dead-center in the map, you know the killer isn't coming from behind you and you know you can pretty safely head towards the edge of the map and not get caught.
---
Or if you have a clear view one direction and Spine Chill lights up, you know the killer isn't coming from that direction and that's where you head to hide.
---
I also noticed that. Pre-archives the lore mentioned she only had online friends on a forum. Archive's lore says she's introverted, has trouble socializing, and found a very strong interest in botany and became very knowledgeable about it. 
---
I think it is being implied she's somewhere on the autism spectrum, there are a few other personality disorders that can present similar to autism.
---
For some reason, everytime I solo que my teamates are gods or they are terrible.
---
Look out guys, we have a Dead by Daylight god over here 😂
---
Dude your Kate card is being revoked.
---
Yeah, I get those every time I play with some friends, we always have to keep swapping host, restarting DBD &amp; whatnot. Don’t know why it’s always there and don’t ever see it addressed and yeah it’s mildly infuriating to say the least tbh.
---
That's what I did with hag so I might
---
Oh wow, wonder where I got 45 seconds from lol.
---
I thought that no matter if it was a quick or a slow locker enter, they killer would get notified. So I refused to enter lockers when it would’ve saved me.
---
Killers and survivor at base kit are fine. The only thing that needs “a solution” is players ruining the game for others, perks/add ons that are broken and some abilities. 
---
Swf can easily be dealt with and if you need have to complain about it just stop playing. It’s 1v4 for a reason!!
---
this requires stars to align and all three other people to be on gens not near the killer, and the person being chased to be in a very advantageous position. 80 seconds is a hell of a long time to be chased early game when you dont know whats going on in the map, and this isn't even including killer and survivor perks.
---
I agree that sometimes its unfavorable for killers.. but the vast majority of games ARE in the killer's favor as long as they're "competent"
---
Who said BHVR wonders these things? Also not every game flows that way (3 gens, 1 chase)
---
Hold up, obsession claws moving means something?
---
I’ve definitely felt this too— in the beginning ranks the killer has the definite upper hand, but once you hit intermediate and expert ranks the survivors have the absolute upper hand. That’s why I was upset when I found out nurse’s base kit was receiving a nerf and why I question the decision to nerf spirit— high level players need good, if not great killers to stand a fighting chance against high rank survivors.
---
Ice cold
---
So slow asf without challenges and more bearable with them. Given the schedule of the tome, I think it should work out fine.
---
Your team must be really dumb and keep healing then.
---
On PC as a solo survivor you have near instant queues. Easy to just kill yourself on first hook and find a game that will actually be fun.
---
Well the thing with Adam is he’s not very stylish and he’s a dude. There’s a reason Barbie is better than Ken.
---
And he’s way too visible for the Blendettes. 
---
Jane is great because she’s beautiful, has a unique body shape and age - aka not a skinny high schooler - and is incredibly stylish.
---
You have to remember there are 6 gens by default so yes 3 will get done fast but the last 2 are the hardest to get done because it's easier for the killer to patrol. Plus you're not supposed to kill all 4 every game just like every survivor won't escape every game. If the killer 4k's EZ then he was that good but if the survivors escape then they were better.  It's all subjective.
---
Don't worry dear ochido fan, next time if I see you in game, I'll mindgame you with a low tier killer so hard you'll get your ass on the ground and DC afterwise ('cause idiotic bullies like you can't handle being owned, dickhead.)
---
Big brain, how else do you get boldness if the killer is scary?
---
Same, except that I also can't run a loop to save my life, so I'm a rank 10 survivor who blows through 3 gens and then gets spotted on the way out and killed. 
---
Looping is a mystery to me.
---
32k
---
I will keep my tits at a fair amount of frantic good sir
---
Yes, survivors in the TR will gain madness with treatment mode doc. You can chase bleeding people as legion and their timer will go down, coulrophobia will be active, etc.
---
The problem is that it last for such a short period of time these effects are hardly things you can take advantage of.
---
i never thought i would want to wear a dbd shirt... god damn.
---
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
---
that didn't seem like the case. 4 of us brought bps and we got 32k or close to it and all of us only got 110,000
---
Means the obsession is being chased
---
The top 3 killers I saw in my games are spirit, freddy and ghostface
---
I fucking hate Legion, unless I'm playing as them

Tho the killer can see you :/ if it lighten up uo right ?
---
I fear that the devs are going to do something about Spirit and ghost face, and that they might do something to plague. If they start changing stuff like that, the game will die, will make it too survivor sided
---
didn’t know that, thanks for the info!
---
Not true lately. I play on PC in purple ranks and survivor queue times have been long since dedicated servers started. My yellow rank killer has been getting into a game almost instantly.

Not all players want progression via rank, actually a decent number of players actively try not to rank up in DBD so while I do see your point it is not entirely true in DBD. Most players want the satisfaction of beating the opposition, in killers case this means 3-4k’s.
---
Top tier swf groups who solely gen rush and loop optimally hardly exist and because of this I find balancing the game around them to be excessive at the very least but thats a whole other argument which I don’t care to get into right now. 
---
You can pip against red rank 4 man SWF’s running meta perks with any killer, matches are simply not as linear as you seem to be implying. There are a number of things that can affect the way the game goes and most killers running top tier addons and perks can pip against all SWF teams. It’s not something that should happen every game, killers should not always 3-4k and survivors should not always 4 man escape. 
---
Spirit is not the only killer who is viable right now, not in the slightest and to say that shows me that you may not have enough experience playing in the upper ranks of DBD.
---
played a trapper game against a 4 man swf and ruin was in a pretty bad spot but i still placed a trap in front of it (with darkening add on) and all the survs fell for it multiple times and at the end of the game after getting a 4k with 5 gens still up i got called a bot for using traps to protect my totem :l
---
This text isn't mine, you dummy shit. Go whine at the OP if your triggered ass can't handle the fact that your dogshit swf system is fucked. Idiotic swine.
---
The devs later decided against base kit kindred. Read it on the forum somewhere. Might have been in a Q&amp;A but they explicitly said they changed their mind.
---
Usually because it takes awhile for things to catch on.  Prayer Beads Spirit wasn't really a problem until enough folks actually raised Spirit high enough to be consistently using that offering, as an example. 
---
You're also conveniently ignoring that Spirit did get some buffs shortly after her release and the only reason folks groan and complain is because there's little/no counterplay to her mechanic.
---
yep, and those people have gotten those killers, maybe others, but the odds that they have every single killer and every single survivor, is very unlikely
---
Hating on my boy :(
---
Could you please link this? If they have then my mistake but I really can’t see this being said.
---
For anyone who says it's too much stress on killer, have you considered looking at the gens to start the game and picking which ones you're going to give up on? IMO it's hard to lose as killer if you're strategic at the start of the game about which gens you're going to patrol. You don't need to pressure 100% of the map, just the area with the 3/4 closest gens together.
---
If survivors are voice chatting then yeah, killer is fucked, but otherwise I don't find it that stressful.
---
Apparently you don't know the definition of tunneling fully which is apparent from your downvotes
---
Off an on during the day Tuesday through Thursday when I'm not working. Fri-Mon when I work maybe an hour or two a day if I do play at all. I seem to average a single shard per game. When you factor in the challenges it seems completely feasible.
---
I recommend always cleansing. You never know when a killer might have Third Seal and totally whip out your team with it just cause you didn't destroy the totem.
---
like i said, i cant balance
---
You could do the same kind of simple math for how long it takes a killer to catch up to and hit a survivor twice, hook them, and for a survivor to die on hook, and it would be JUST AS STUPID.
---
I just played 16 games in a row on the PTB with literally no skills, and not a single game went this fast. Not a single one. No one does gens this fast, not with skills, not without, and sure as shit not with a killer who understand the difference between chasing a survivor and tunneling a survivor.
---
Trying to break things down like this is so stupid. It's not how the game works at all, and I wish we could post survivor versions of this and killers wouldn't downvote them into the ground on here. It's tiresome watching killers cry and moan about shit time and time again as if they don't have completely busted fucking perks and powers that demand the perks survivors use, or, you know THEY'D JUST 4k EVERY GAME.
---
I’m a new player, had something similar happen last night. Got in a staring contest with Michael Myers, laughing my ass off and telling my friend while he’s yelling for me to run...
---
but... killers *have* to chase the survivor they see until they’re down. there’s no *leaving* or anything like that
---
Pretty sure everyone does
---
you quit playing because you cant get the free stuff that is too much to grind? then just dont get it...? its free? lmao what is the logic behind quitting over that. im baffled
---
yes he can still see your aura if its lit
---
Yeah, i think im going to use SB from now on. Dead Hard is getting boring and i want to switch it up
---
In all honesty, do not use either. For now since you’re new sure, but let me tell you why I think it’s a big crutch the lower rank you get:
---
Majority of people who use it are just bad, I’ve noticed. With new players, that’s expected and ok. With “experienced” players, it’s a yikes. With Prem or SC if it procs then you get uneasy, you can waste a lot of time trying to pre-emptively hide from the killer when it turns out they just looked in your direction or they’re chasing someone else. That’s not good, because you’re possibly wasting time. I see so many people start to crouch away and hide and shit when either light up, and still get found anyway majority of the time. 
---
Even when they don’t get found it’s still creating bad habits. To really get good at survivir you need to practice interacting with the killer. So that means getting chased, getting used to how killers think, and will think to outplay you. Also playing killer helps. Using Prem or SC makes you think “I should move, I can’t be caught.” 
---
Especially when sometimes it’s better to be caught. I use to rely on SC then ran like a headless chicken when I didn’t have it and I heard the terror radius around maybe. Turns out the killer was leaving or chasing someone else. So learn to play without it then when you do, try it out again. It does give good knowledge, but you shouldn’t rely on it. Hope this helps sorry for the wall
---
You... you can earn serum from all four tomes.
---
You know, I'd honestly play both sides more if not for my low Killer rank 18 ass making wait times skyrocket to around 30 minutes before I get even 1 game going meanwhile my Survivor rank has been climbing since lobbies are easier and quicker to join. I hate this...
---
Oh please... It's so hard to fucking notice that.
---
And with her new skin? You can't see it at all.
---
Im rank 7 on PC and wait no more than a minute for a game, I don't understand how yours is so long. Region based perhaps? Im UK based.
---
I'm kinda really confused by you at this point. The perks on your mean build are probably less fun than a standard build, at least if you ask me. Like, i get pop, it at least feels nice to use when compared with ruin while still doing a good job at regression. 
---
Overcharge at best works once per survivor. Anyone over rank 13 won't fail the skill check once they know it's there. I don't really get any enjoyment out of it because of this. May as well leave the slot empty if you ask me. 
---
Now lullaby is the really confusing one. It's literally just a worse ruin. Works the same, not really doing much besides passive slowdown and maybe a bit of tracking. 
---
I'll give you tinkerer it can allow for some really fun plays that the survivors won't be expecting. Really unpredictable, because no one runs the damn thing. 
---
Tldr: overall i don't get why you insist on "playing unpredictably". Like wouldn't ruin just be better than lullaby while being the same amount of fun and predictable. And overcharge just kinda does nothing, i don't really find that fun. Cool with the rest of them Correct me if I'm wrong but i feel like you're just kinda bashing strong perks here. Then again i don't know your other builds so maybe I'm wrong.
---
I said this game needed a different mode of operation from generator completion back when I first got the game shortly after it launched. Even with only 3 killers in the game it just seemed obvious to me that people would get bored of the hold m1/m2 and hit skill checks on a stationary object thing. They didn't, but I still would like to see a DbD map/mode type that stepped away from the generator/gate setup and gave the survivors something different to do gameplay-wise.
---
That's exactly what I expect from any survivor main who don't give a shit about killer problems. They tell them "not to whine like crybabies". Please stop.
---
Regard Well Read, I wanted to explain what this did for each item type.
---
For health kits and tool boxes , the perk simply increases heal and repair/sabo speed respectively.
---
For flashlights, the perk increases flash intensity.
---
For maps and keys, the perk increases aura ranges
---
Players don't utilize them right by crouching everywhere and wasting time moving places. 
---
You want to use Urban Evasion to keep pressure off your team + perserve pallets if the killer actively looks for you. If you're on a gen at like 40% alone and the killer starts looking for you for an excessive amount of time to BBQ but fails, they can lose tons of pressure.
---
But if you're with a team and the killer is coming, it's useless as your other teammate will be pressured on. Sometimes it can be horrible against you too. I've played several games with 3 UE survivors and I was chased and killed early with 3 hooks because no one would attempt to be chased. Shortly after I spectated, sat watching immersion for like a minute and a half and the killer finally finds someone that can' t chase for more than 10 seconds. 
---
Stealth is a part of the game. It can be extremely helpful to hide to prevent more pressure on your team or to get the unhook, but don't stealth so hard you waste time and don't learn chases.
---
What can I say except... Outplayed !
---
Not always, but thanatophobia is pretty damn strong with 4 injured.
---
You relayed all the thoughts i stated above but in a better way. good job
---
Killers have far more options for powerful, entertaining, interesting, and useful perks than survivors do by a long shot.
---
It's not even a competition. Feel free to argue this and then lets hop over to the next thread where you try and complain about how every survivor runs the same 4 perks or whatever.
---
Survivors are absolutely forced into using perks or they risk being absolutely destroyed. Tunneled to deal early in the game, never escaping a chase, never hook saving etc.
---
People act like this game is one sided and it's so absurd sounding.
---
Also: People who use object with sprint burst to avoid ever initiating a chase the entire round.
---
PC players shouldn’t play with console players anyway. Imagine being on console and fighting a PC killer using a mouse and keyboard. You’d get fucked up.
---
I never disagreed that it was not optimal.  The fact is that it is optimal to tunnel to thin the herd. OP asked if it was toxic.
---
I know Frank as a survivor isn’t a new idea, but I wanted to toss out my ideas for what his perks could be, do leave feedback.
---
That has actually happened to me TWICE. Heard the terror radius pretty close so I thought I was being chased and dropped down, only to find a confused but happy killer.
---
It's like thoughts on paper. Like a diary, I think they did that on purpose.
---
Thsu looks like a cartoon, I like
---
Not sure why Ghostface is seen as powerful. The only thing he’s good for is Night Shroud. Stalking just wastes your time. Other than that he’s an M1 killer.
---
How have they
---
You would have to re-balance the entire game, and change how killer work, most of their perks, etc.
---
Technically theses are memories and thoughts the characters have so Claudette thinking she’s alone Very alone doesn’t feel too out of place especially if she’s 7-8 cause I would go off saying I’m mad very very mad or something like that at that age range personally I don’t care much I enjoy em listen to em once then never touch em again unless I get new entries
---
Who, sorry?
---
1 in 1 *
---
But still, how are you supposed to play with your friends and feel like you're playing with friends if u dont talk to them?
---
When people say something is unfun, they're sharing *their opinion*, not shouting about some objective truth that everyone but you agreed with.
---
Yes this depend on the map in some maps you find the survivors immediately that’s not if all of them were together.
---
Yeah, I guess I'm just missing the challenges right now. I'm sure they'll help down the road.
---
Rank 2 here-- this is so true. Most killers will moon walk or double back almost everytime they can, so when a killer just simply comes straight at me, I'm just lost.. like I did not expect them to suddenly turn rank 20, but it works :(
---
No, you have to understand the point of view from the author (Vigo for the most part).
---
The straightforward and dramatic tense is actually very ornate, if they used a vast amount of intricacies in the writing, it would come off as tact and pompous. I love the style they went for, it’s very sudden; it really reads like someone quickly scribbled into a journal, documenting what they’ve seen.
---
Lately my teammates all try to unhook then don't struggle.  It's weird
---
Legion's still a underrated killer who's fun to play and has an unique power synergy with kind a lot of meta perks. Keeping everyone injured is very strong actually. You get a permanent one shot on everyone, you hear them moan in pain so they cannot hide when you get close to them, they get a constant 16% decreased speed action on everything and lose a lot of time to negate your insteadowns if they try to heal, which takes a lot of time (ever more with DL or Sloppy), but your power can negate all their heals in a few seconds. You just gotta know the tricks, the perks and how to Frenzy, and you're set! You can enjoy playing a low tier killer!
---
I mean, I enjoy the early-game planning of vomiting on objects as a method of tracking survivors, hunting down broken survivors and literally everything about Corrupt Purge, plus her aesthetic is gorgeous and totally unique among the Killers.
---
Thoughts of a Plague main here
---
One of my first ranked matches, in The Game. Killer tried to give me the hatch. I didn’t know what he was doing. After he dropped me enough times so I could get up, I ran away and got lost trying to find the exit gate. Took me a stupid amount of time to find the gate and escape. Killers response in end game chat was just “....wow.”
---
Thats because the entity allows it
---
Super confused
---
Scale length of time to complete a generator to the killer level. 80 secs at level 20. 100-120 at rank 1.   Do some linear interpolation for the ranks in-between.
---
Those people get facecamped.
---
I did 
---

Mindgame me when youve been looped for 5 gens and have to facecamp for that desperate 1K lmaooo.
---
same here
---
somehow I play Legion at decently high ranks and still win consistently
---
Then you're not invited to our wedding.
---
Idk unless you're getting God looped I don't think a Chase should last 80 seconds. Maybe if you're playing a really bad killer. I'd say 60 seconds is about right.
---
I only facecamp when the survivors are toxic looping and attempting to bully.
---
SB takes a high lvl of skill to work properly, DH is good if used correctly, but i feel like the people who use it make dumb mistakes bc they have it/dont have it
---
I posted my loadout on my profile if that helps
---
SPIRIT MAINS GET NO MERCY
---
As a Dwight main, this irritates me when people DC because of spirit
---
Finally someone telling the truth. 
---
The user on the screen forgot to mention, that GOOD survivors don't give a single fuck about ruin, as they just hit greats and even if they want to get rid of it, it usually is pretty easy for them to find it.
---
hey, 1500 points are 1500. Teammates better watch out
---
make the fuel's aura not seeable for the killer and Im with you (or else, fuel camping would destroy survivors)
---
In other words, flip a coin? Wooo. Fun. Very interactive.
---
This is a repost. Do better next time
---
Never thought of that! I hope it happens
---
It'd help if he didn't suck fingers.
---
Phi Phi on console played against her once and gave her hatch at end she messaged me to say thank you was so nice of her.

I dont mind his power but I dc against her cause i cant stand the vomits while my screen is filled with shit

This kind of stuff makes me think that I just ruined the entire game. When I drop a pallet trying to heal the downed survivor under it

But they never save you when the killer isn’t face camping
---
^never
---
I mean, Pop/BBQ/Ruin/Discordance is a reasonably strong setup. No need to go either/or. Switch out BBQ for Thrilling Tremors, or Discordance for Surveillance and you've got a nice little setup going. Pop is downright essential though, imo. Even moreso than Ruin. Pop wins games by snatching time back, rather than slowing time down.
---
Missed out on the perk "I've covered wars, you'know"
---
Lmao it's the complete opposite. Survivors don't even need perks to do well. You can stay injured the entire game and be absolutely fine. Marth's experiment is factual. 
---
Now give a good survivor Dead Hard, DStrike, Borrowed and Adrenaline (this is the most common r1 build) and see what happens. Survs also have plenty of other strong perks on top of those. 
---
You're actually crazy if you believe what you said.
---
I had this same perk idea but mine was called Pack A Punch from Call of Duty Zombies
---
Big Leatha! It’s me, Dwight! Chill, chill!
---
honestly this is another reason that makes me sad that its the toxic ppl that tend to play her. Claudette is supposed to be a kind and friendly woman full of empathy and love. her autism and her general personality just shows that shes bright and she fucking cares about people. shes a healer.
---
i know its dumb to be annoyed by this, lol. but like... i can understand Nea players being toxic because it does seem to fit her personality. i can see David players making dumb altruistic plays just because he wants to be protective. i can see Ash players being a bit cocky. i can see Fengs pointing and teabagging. all because of the personalities of their characters.
---
i know that Claudette is the toxic survivor because of two things - she is free &amp; she can be so difficult to see. but it still makes me sad, dude. she was supposed to be a healing sweetheart
---
Look up "Yang Yongxin", the man who inspired DBD's Herman Carter.
---
Killer matches for me are right away but survivor queue times are a different story (rank 9 killer / rank 3 surv)
---
Exactly like that!
---
This ninny isn't even close to reasonable if you see his other posts, no reason to apologize to him. He's obviously a dog shit survivor.
---
A level per day is incredibly time consuming though considering it takes 15-20 games just to level up once without Challenges.
---
Survivors would find a way to disable it ingame while still using discord.
---
Right about..? 
---
It was SO smart of you to remind them about the option to play killer! You're making the game so much better, one retarded comment at a time.

Honestly that would solve a ***lot*** of problems with no other comms in-game. Finally could tell that immerses Claudette in the corner to get on a damn gen
---
Killer tier is definitely a factor but I feel like you can do *really* well on pretty much any killer if you’re just good and have the right build. Not even some op combination of perks and add-ons, just a good reliable build.

Sorry man, but this discussion is about rank 1.
---
killer_irl survivor not so much
---
BHVR hire me for more good ideas 😂😂😂
---
tbh recently i’ve actually been able to get off hooks more often in the new updates
---
Would an additional gen + an additional gen required break the game?
---
It still wouldn't be enough. Ruin and Pop barely hold back gen progression at Red Ranks as it is. Considering how a survivor wastes like 20 or 25% of the time restarting gen progression as you take kicking it, even if gens regressed faster, Ruin/Pop nerf seems like a really bad idea.
---
This ain’t that bad of an idea! I might have to try it sometimes. Knowing me though, I’d probably get real anxious without sound and turn it back on ;-; Hope you’re feeling better now!
---
And therein lies another problem, what the hell other alternate objective could there possibly be?
---
Though I will remind you, the primary objective in the game is also hold m1 lol
---
Let you guys fig out his power but I would love a Silent Hill map. Fog, then some rusted and dark other world. I think his perks would have something to do with guilt. Like force altruistic plays or suffer guilt. Idk. Just a thought.
---
That’s what I was thinking. All I did was blendette around the map, cleanse totems with small game and lose chases in record time
---
This would have a few implications.
---
Buffs:
---
 - NOED will now obscure the position of other hexxes, such as Ruin or Haunted Grounds, as all totems will be identically lit.
---
 - NOED has synergy with Thrill Of The Hunt, as all totems will produce a notification when cleansed.
---
 - NOED will now pressure surivors to cleanse all 5 map totems, instead of ignoring them.
---
Nerfs:
---
 - NOED will no longer be a surprise / "secret", allowing survivors to choose whether to cleanse totems to prevent it, or rush to the endgame and work around it.
---
 - NOED will prevent the killer from being able to tell where their ruin / other hexes are located
---
It will indeed do that
---
&gt; Scorpionz
---
Scorpionz and MSA don't use game slowers it seems and are rank 1. Impressive, actually. 
---
Cahla definitely uses stuff like ruin and pop, though. Not all killers, but she does.
---
Claudettes have a dark past with this game, you kinda just accept it if you wanna play Claudette
---
Or, you can try to keep running when he gets close if you think he will swing. Giving you another loop.
---
That is exactly the opposite of what I said. But to hell with trying to be helpful then. In other words, stop whining like a baby and git fucking good like the rest of us.
---
What do you mean by toxic looping?
---
Kinda correct. Durex at one time was pitching “uber eats” but for condoms. Biggest draw was that apparently the delivery people would be disguised as *something* to discreetly hand off purchases.
---
Never really took off.
---
Like he said, blame the player
---
What does toxic looping mean?
---
We already know the devs suck at this game. We all remember the infamous video of Cote getting destroyed by that group of tryhard Asian survivors a few yrs back...
---
Lol good killers know that gens will pop quickly at the beginning of the match, and they can actually defend the last few gens
---
It’s caught in a loop. You might win if it ain’t cleansed, but if it is you probably lost. That is a glaring issue, among the others.
---
That’s exactly what I was trying to say- it’s a way higher percentage then they say IMO, just like the Kobe works out to be.
---
Every FUCKING time I smoke and play dead by daylight, it’s a hag. EVERY. TIME. Stoner hell.
---
That's true. If only there was a group of devs who could take the best of both of them..
---
It doesn't. Very few shards on her default skin actually glow. All shards should glow. It should be obvious when she's phasing. She could still mind game, but it,as just infuriating not knowing what she is doing.
---
Still, this type of "counter" is not mentioned ANYWHERE ingame. Not everyone uses Reddit. We know about this "counter" but it's still VERY hard to notice.
---
Behaviour need to tell the community all this kind  of stuff ingame. There's so much not mentioned ingame that should be.
---
P3 Level 50 Meghead and Bing Bong Boi
---
There's nothing weird about that. it's because they don't have a real ranking system. It's easy enough for trash players to rank up just by playing that by the middle to end of the seasons you have a lot of bad players who wouldn't be there if they had a system base on any sort of skill.
---
If you think I'm on a side, you're wrong. I call out dumb people regardless of what they play.
---
As a survivor main, I’ve had a killer run away with games, and dominate. Which just makes me want to improve, and be a better survivor. Keep at it, friendo. Survivors need killers just as much as killers need survivors. Without both, there is no game.
---
I like corrupt instead of ruin on legion
---
This has never been a problem for me. Or even a problem I’ve noticed in the game. Albeit I play on PS4 so the community prob isn’t as “advanced” as pc but I think the game is fine as is. That said, fuck Spirit - nerf her.
---
This is really cool. Idk why but now I like her more? That doesn't even make sense cause im not autistic lmao
---
Me too brother...
---
Oh yeah I've only been playing for about 3 months so I'm still getting used to things
---
Ah ratz I forgot about that
---
I doubt I've had a survivor game last more than 15 minutes in months. I never heal unless my teammate has WMI or I get Adrenaline at the end. I guarantee I've played more survivor than you, so don't give me this bullshit about I don't play both sides.
---
Yeah, good survivors do stay injured. I'm sure you self-care after every hit. Probably why gens don't get done and your matches take 20 minutes.
---
Instead of putting you onto a hook, he would first make you feel bad about your past guilts, then he’d grab the nearest survivor and try to do the same thing he did to those two mannequins in that apartment.
---
I feel personally attacked. Why would you call me out like this?
---
it would be toxic as fuck. itll never happen
---
I don't know why but I find the demogorgon very fun to play even if I get most of the time "entity displeased".
---
I was already doling out the 4Ks as wraith like it was Halloween candy but man I love that he no longer has to worry about OoO or any survivor killer-aura reading perks either.
---
I don't bother with Ruin. You can criticize yourself better at yout mistakes and become less reliant on it.
---
I can agree with 4 gens in 2 minutes being almost assuredly my fault. I don't think that has ever happened to me, but maybe.
---
3 gens in 2 minutes has happened to me, and it's not uncommon though. It is possible to turn that around. That's something I don't think you can prevent every game. Find someone, chase for a bit and 3 gens pop, maybe as you're hooking.
---
Wish I could use this on PS4
---
If you're the killer, yes, if you're a survivor, no. I always count DCs as kills because it's like giving up.

What is the new DS for then?
---
I've always loved clown. Hes reliable for me and it's really fun to herd people and he can shut down any loop really easily just by gassing a window or pallet. I also just love his laugh for some reason. Overall I think hes the best option
---
If it’s a rank 1 issue why is it presented as a game mechanics issue? Also what minute percent of the community is rank 1 and why do the supposed best players of the game need to have the entire game reworked for them
---
If SWF was removed I would never play survivor again. I only enjoy playing with my friends because solo survivor is a shit show 90% of the time
---
Tbh I think thana is still better than dying light. Dying light only takes effect in late game where you dont really need it and it gives 3 benefits to the obsession (huge alturism boost, no slow down and death-immunity if the killer wants to keep the perk)
---
IMO 4 gens in 2 minutes is probably 100% preventable. 3 gens, not always.
---
You got me with the rarely seen secondary whooosh
---
I think a lot of people also camp claudette because in all honesty shes next to impossible to find on super dark maps so they probably just figure they'll camp rather than trying to find you again. Its not nice to camp at all and it definitely ruins the fun, I think it's pretty common for claudettes to get camped and tunneled which sucks.

Technically there is already. That would be either killers camping at gates when there's one survivor and the hatch closed or when survivors keep butt dancing at the gates until the killer show up to take the humiliation.
---
It averages out a little less. You get an additional 300 exp for your first game each day, which is often a full fragment if you have a good game and combine the exp. Also, if your games are good then you will get more than 400 exp a match, I generally average around 500. So it becomes about 15 or so games without the rift, depending.
---
If you have ghostface or Freddy you can just negate it outright
---
Run Corrupt Intervention and set up near where you spawn.
---
Does Sloppy work with feral frenzy? I've been always wondering
---
You might not be an asshole, but you're wearing an asshole's uniform.  
---
Which sucks, cause i like Claudette too.
---
You need only one key to open the hatch and the amount of survivors who escape depends on the amount of gens you do (the hatch spawns if: 4 survivors are alive - you have 1 gen left, 3 survivors - 2 gens left etc.)
---
Agreed. The "Looking" mechanics of Ghostface are already broken, imagine how broken Slenderman would be. Not to mention, probably really easy to counter.
---
I think all of this would be fine if gens didnt count as one of the objectives for killers, I dont like that I have no control over an objective I cant stop while I'm chasing one person. Having "stop gens" be an emblem is why all killers run the gen slow down perks as meta otherwise noed cause gens get done and then finally we have 2 things to guard instead of 7 on a huge map. And yeah I realize the map isnt always huge, but if all maps were like the game this would be a much easier objective.
---
this wasn’t funny the first time it was posted let alone the 739th
---
I wish I could laugh at this, but as a survivor main, I just can't even bring myself to do it
---
That’s why I leave instantly, I don’t want to find out
---
I really only play her because she has cute outfits and I just don't see why people immediately think "haha claudette wearing p2 pants toxic" and only go after me
---
There's a hilarious video on youtube showing an example of what that would be like.
---
That’s just sweaty ass gaming right there
---
Tbf there are tons of survivors who would never sniff red ranks again if you removed exhaustion perks from the game.
---
Im sorry but if you buy cosmetics you get the T-bag. I no longer consider you a baby killer or survivor lol.
---
What if the person you're bodyblocking is the actual person trying to get this challenge?
---
It took me a minute to realise the sarcasm xD
---
kek
---
tell me another tale mr survivor main.
---
&gt; But not every match you have a team who sit down on gens all the time.
---
? So it's cool because some survivors dick around...?
---
Funny that in low-ranks the killer is the power role.
---
Dude you didnt even read any of the comments and started wilding out here. Thats why I fucking said balance the game so when the killers go against high level SWF, they should receive buffs that are better to cope with the team as compared to when they go against solo queue people.
---
So please, fucking read before babbling like an idiot. If the devs make that change, the players wont have to do much other than adapt to killers when they solo queue vs when they SWF. Difficulty should be higher for 3-4 SWFs. 
---
If you want to depip fast, go solo queue and go against Plagues and what not. What I’m saying will benefit the killer and you’re here fucking spewing nonsense
---
This summarizes the problems with point system on  the survivor side.
---
To get good points, you need to do 2 gens, get chased at least 4 minutes and run around to heal people.
---
Ohh noo being one hit so scary!
---
Yes I am certain that there was no hatch
---
lmao guy's complaining about Ruin and BBQ, what a baby. I don't even care about it anymore, I act like it's a default for every killer
---
Gens should take 100 seconds, each hook stage should be extended by 30 seconds. This way camping/tunneling is discouraged more and gens don’t go ridiculously fast.
---
I’m not saying they need to be god tier. But if they are going to lecture me on optimal play style and what sorts of things aren’t possible, they need to be good at the game.
---
Welp that’s dbd for you
---
I make fun of people who *do* run meta perks. Seeing BBQ, Nurses, Ruin, NOED every game is fucking boring
---
I never thought I would see Banjo on this sub.
---
Solo survivor in red ranks is the same deal. SWF exacerbates the problem, but half of my solo survivor games in red ranks are the same first chase/3 gens done deal.
---
Banjo for dbd?
---
Can you really call it an instaheal if it takes 16 seconds?
---
“WHERE THE HELL ARE THE PALLETS” is such a mood in this game lmao
---
Hahaha. Yes you fuckers certainly do. I play fair as hell. No camp. No tunnel. No... NOED. Still I get first hit DCs or I'm not going to give you BBQ DCs. I'm going to DC to give hatch plays.  Funny observation I made. Before mettel of man lots of DCs then during not so much. Then I come back after the MOM patch and we are back to DCing I see. It's not lag. It's not me being toxic it's people who know it's wrong to do but don't care.  Shameful guys. Really.  I am shocked at how many people do it when I'm killer and when I play solo I get stuck in 3 man games 1 out of Evey 3 or 4 games. Lame.
---
I didn't know what Dead Hard actually did, so I always used it instantly when it got ready, thinking it was the smallest sprint burst in the game
---
On the other side we need to buff the survivors again in other ways...Why? Because the kill rate is pretty balanced right now.
---
No im just saying it is not like that all the time. This doesn’t happen in every match it rarely does. And again getting that fast down is important
---
i love being killer and seeing survivors waste a ton of palettes in the first minute knowing how much easier my chases will be later
---
but then i play survivor and do the exact same shit
---
 im also mid ranked and if ruins in play people will run around the map doing nothing ive also had survivors at mid rank who will get on hook and try to get off and then they will not struggle and just let themselves die and this all goes down in like the 1st min its so annoying
---
When you see a Teammate get hit near a pallet and they run through it to a TL Wall instead of instantly dropping the pallet 😍
---
Christ I still have my brown ones
---
I've just been in queue for 2 hours so it's fine.
---
Wish I could. But I didn’t think to clip it. I was dumbfounded by his statements.
---
I’m sure if you asked Peanits, he’ll confirm that he doesn’t respect killers who run Slow down perks.
---
I think that it would be a neat idea, but i can only see it being used for toxicity
---
Well, it's extreme but think of the Nazi's and their uniform. Maybe you're not a bad person, but by wearing what they wear you're gonna be associated with them like it or not. Lol
---
High rank survivor is weird. I sit around ranks 1-3 and when I play solo, games are sooooo weird. Sometimes my teammates all get slaughtered in 3 minutes, and sometimes i run the killer around for 3 gens, or someone else on the team does while myself and my other teammates do gens. I definitely see why it's a problem, especially because I play both survivor and killer. Not running ruin just isn't an option. Every killer running ruin was something that used to bother me, but once I started playing killer I realized just how necessary it is to even have a chance in many cases. You can get away with it at mid-ranks sometimes, but heading toward the red ranks it's just mandtory
---
100% agree. This is breaking the game down into a mathematics spreadsheet based off game stats and data... no one plays a game like that. That’s the cool part about video games, especially multiplayer games, is that these systems are manipulated by many players and factors. Breaking it down like this post does is asinine because it’s unrealistic. Sure, game’s can sometimes be played exactly like this but that’s rare. 
---
I’m seldom in matches that happen like this unless the killer is just terrible. Any competent players will utilize all game systems to their advantage and when that fails, any player with active brain activity will adapt to the match’s situations. I’ve experienced few games where survivors just steamroll the killer like clockwork unless the killer is Garbo. I also play plenty of Killer and Survivor so I know how it is on both sides. As this fellow said, you win some you lose some, and you wreck and get wrecked on occasion.
---
Man, that Adam cosmetic is beautiful. At least it good tho, Imagine having only a few cosmetics + all of them being shitty
---
Franklin's and Third Seal are my personal favorites on Legion, the amount of confusion you put on survivors by just making them run back for their items can really help you out against greedy players, and its super satifying to blind all survivor in a single frenzy to then have them all lost and unaware of their team.
---
You, sir, are a genius. Maybe you should send this to the devs (though I doubt they’ll listen)
---
That’s a new idea- never seen that one before. Like at green ranks gens take 80 secs, as the base number:
---
Grey takes 60s
---
Yellow takes 70s
---
Green takes 80 s
---
Purple takes 90s
---
Red takes 100s
---
Something like that could work adding in regression penalties, toolbox bonuses, etc. that’s an interesting idea.
---
May become boring for the red rank people taking so long to finish the gen.
---
I had thought about adding complexity to escape at higher ranks- like find the missing gen pieces before you can start building (have 10 pieces so there are far more than gens) but require the piece before starting to repair at higher ranks. Or some other added objective to give the killer a chance.
---
I made it to red ranks as killer once since buying the game and I 100% believe I don't belong there nor do I want to return there. Probably the least amount of fun I've ever had in the game.
---
I didn't get this until I saw the sub, nice one
---
those close games are always so much fun. It's when this game actually gets my blood pumping. When my whole team rushes gens there really isn't any heart racing moments and same for if my team is getting slaughtered. Those close games are great though
---
Is there a way to get rid of the perks backgrounds? Idk if those files didnt get replaced, like the default colors for Rare and Very Rare perks. Can't see these images well with a green background
---
imagine
---
Bro wtf
---
I play both survivor and as killer i legit dont bother camping i go and get whoever working on a gen 
---
When killer face camps i just go do all the gens his loss
---
Lot of salty survivor mains in here
---
No one else can see it :(
---
No only you see your character moving
---
I hate facing spirit, but I can deal with it. But if she is proxy camping with tryhard addons, that's it, DC immediately.
---
She is extremely hard to find on some maps. Not saying it is alright but it is annoying as hell.
---
I've been running just pop a lot as well tbh. Pop is god tier and is better than ruin but only after a gen or 2 has been done and you don't have to patrol more than 5 gens. I use bbq but barely even use it for tracking. I'm a bloodpoints whore and use it basically only for the bp. My build is usually pop, bbq, enduring, and either ruin or brutal strength.
---
battleblock theater with dead by daylight lol
---
Korea #1
---
the game has to be balanced for swf or swf has to be removed or swf has to be put in a separate unranked mode. It completely breaks any attempt to balance things, as way more killers are viable if the survivors are not able to communicate between themselves. For instance if you wanted to make the game based on swf-style gameplay with survivors communicating,you'd enable in game voice chat, perhaps allow killer to see items/addons on survivors in the lobby, and tweak the perk balance toward what works for coordinated teams. Spirit is being nerfed yet its picked so much because even with a coordinated team it will wreck havoc, if properly played, and it's the only killer, with nurse as well i think, that can do that reliably.
---
They could completely remove bbq's aura reveal and I'd still run it just for the increased bp. Shit is way too good to pass up.
---
It's cuz he's banned cuz he's an unfunny ass hole
---
I mean, unless you are specifically and directly accusing the developers of lying about the player base statistics of their game for some reason then I don't see what you mean. The stats say 4% of games on pc have a 4-man swf in them, they couldn't be clearer.
---
Very intelligible question. 
---
Bloodlust at 12 seconds
---
Stuns reduce slightly regardless of if you have Endurance or not. 
---
Trapper spawns with more traps.
---
Freddy and Hag get more traps and Pig gets more reverse best traps. Plague can break them faster. 
---
Also, Legion should be buffed according for ever and all games:
---
He should be able to see scratch marks coming out of Frenzy sooner. Second tap shouldn’t give them a speed boost but rather just lower the bar. Frenzy cool down should be 3 seconds not 4. 4 seconds if you double stab.
---
That honestly depends on what powers they choose foe Slenderman. His list of abilites is really long and includes things like mind control, time travel, instant teleportation and ranged attacks with his long tentacle arms
---
No SWF group would ever use it. Besides have you played Friday the 13th game. It looks good but you will here some annoying chatter. Hearing a guy as playing Jason talk in a derpy voice completely ruined that game for me. Besides the way we have people cry about everything in your ear instead of post game chat. You would always be called a camper or tunneler. No thank you. That's one thing BHVR got right. No coms.
---
To me it is not toxic in the context of the situation.
---
Well they are kinda right. It depends on the level. When I get ruin at Rank 15 I already know we will lose because everyone(except me) will try to find the totem.
---
True. I played a bunch of survivor and someone expected me to get salty cause it was a 3 key escape. I can send the messages they were really rubbing it in expecting me to get salty. But the more salty you get the worse you'll do. I used to get into a funk and swing at everything and just act like a rank 21 just cause I was impatient. My brain isnt working, what's nc again lol.
---
I didn't understand this until I realised what sub it was on lmao
---
Curious where your data is from, because [BHVR's most recent data shows you're completely wrong.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/61114/)
---
Lowest killers average 50% with the highest not breaching 70%, spirit isn't even top 3 on any platform, &gt;50% of survivors survive starting at rank 8.
---
Yeah, it’s a real shame. I also really enjoy playing Killer, but it’s hard when people DC because they thought their cheeky “mindgame” blew up in their face in a spectacular way.
---
Lol that's funny, I dont know why but it seems like people are camping even more now. I dont get it, I'd rather 8 hooks and no kills than killing 1 survivor by staring into his soul for 2 minutes.
---
Dank by Danklight
---
Its like you might as well set a timer for yourself so you know how fucked you are
---
For the longest time I thought clown was bugged where I couldn't see his eyes in game. Then after like two patches and nobody mentioning it, i figured it was intentional. I now realize that even his trailer featured no eyes and i just didn't notice
---
You mentioned two of the best killers in the game. If you are trapper going around putting your traps down for at least 40 seconds at the beginning of the map, you simply need either corrupt or ruin.
---
yes it does. God is it horrible to go against as a survivor
---
Thanks. If he wants to disagree, it's okay, but I just can't comdone him straight up saying there is nothing to tell when she's phasing, even though it's there. At least some of the community is good like you.
---
Yeah, he does. And he uses corrupt intervention all the time.
---
Maybe try to listen to the heartbeat next time.
---
The Friday the 13th game had proximity chat. Sometimes it was used for people just goofing around, counselers snitching on each other, or Jason doing something like offering free hugs then bear hugging people to death. 
---
Then there was the other like 75% of the time proximity chat was used to scream some colorful language at Jason and other counselers in the game. There's always that one guy who does it.
---
With how toxic DbD is on a good day, it'd probably be a shitshow outside of like super low rank where people aren't dead inside yet.
---
This subreddit isn't the place for just complaining about other players, read rule 8 for posting
---
An hour or two a day is a lot of time if you have a job and/or a family
---
I thought this was going to be a "why are you running" meme but the lag was the joke all along.
---
Fav game of all time. He could be perfect for this game. I know people are going to bring up he walks slow but he can have a normal walk speed and have his knife warp in like Spirt. Just spit balling here.
---
Dying on hook though would lose any nectar that wasn't fully filled up or filled past the markers.  But yeah, Survivors would do that anyway. 
---
Some Killers would just be dicks and camp the flowers or put traps by them, too.
---
Ruin is like the only thing that is countering purple toolboxs and shit like that. No amount of pressure will stop a gen from being done in 60 seconds with a purple toolbox. Maybe as the big three but the others have a tough time with it.
---
This is me all the time as I refuse to run ruin at all, but I've accepted it. I find that if you need a perk for games to last longer than there's something wrong.
---
ruin just gives you the time to apply pressure that you can't get anywhere else unless you are really good at reading the survivors or chasing quickly honestly, freddy is helpful in that sense since he can apply a shitton of map pressure with the gen teleport but yeah. I tried running trapper without ruin at rank 12, big mistake, match lasted 4 minutes, like 3 chases, 1 hooked, barely even got to any gens, i think i didn't even see one of the survivors lol, i don't know what i could've done better,i simply couldn't get anywhere in time lol
---
I'm a killer main these days but I have 5500 hours in the game. Probably split pretty evenly overall. Sorry that you're just trash at the game.
---
James Sunderland as a survivor would be sweet also. BHVR this is money being left on the table. Go get it...
---
I have been called a n00b3 wannabe tryhard for trying to conserve pallets during a chase...I'm not even good at chases, but I know that you don't just throw them all down in the first chase of the match... :(
---
Clown doesn't need 50 seconds to set up traps around the map at the beginning of the game. The clown is an upper mid-tier killer. That's also one guy. Also if killers cant use ruin as a crutch, survivers shouldn't use dead hard as a crutch if we're gonna play the crutch game.
---
Yes.
---
You don’t lose bp you lose emblem points which allow you to rank up.
---
Coming from the person who probably runs dead hard every game.
---
Isn’t it 1k a fragment? So 500xp per game equals 20 games?
---
Turns out that all the survivors are secretly guilty of something and we slowly find out that they deserve to be in the realm of the Entity.
---
They do it while you're walking then probably but if you do it while they're paused or time the distance it's funny. Even if you miss they usually stop because random explosions..
---
When high rank survivors do dumb shit its usually because of a meme build or some kind of objective like a daily or acheivment or tome.
---
I'd get the left side and go to both party streamers
---
thats exactly why they do it, they feed off your salt, dont give it to them, just leave and go to a new match
---
I'm assuming this is a joke, but go for the Streamers.
---
Thanatophobia is bad on plague. You cant heal versus plague so that removes most of thanas value. It only slows down generators by a neglible amount. Thana is way better on legion paired with sloppy butcher.
---
but then change gen mechanics and killers like spirit, nurse, and billy become WAY too strong
---
Legion wasn't even OP. He was annoying yes, and he had exploits with mending (however they weren't that common place in matches).
---
However BHVR single-handedly killed his character. He went from an OK killer to absolutely garbage. Goodluck getting his adept if you aren't playing against a lobby of level 15-20's.
---
Trash player here, can confirm. My favourite thing to do when I play as the Huntress is have someone throw down a pallet in a chase so I can throw a hatchet in their stupid face.
---
Campingn as a killer to get 4kills wait thats illegal
---
When youre at the gate with 3 lights up and youre screaming "COME ON! OPEN! **OPENOPENOPENOPEN**" while myers is power walking over with tier 3 tombstone.
---
Terror.
