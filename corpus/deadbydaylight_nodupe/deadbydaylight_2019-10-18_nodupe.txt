I can say from the bottom of my 700 console hours, nurse is absolute trash on console if you don‚Äôt run omegablink or quintuple bliking nurse. Otherwise she as annoying as billy.

BBQ is good BUT it's only good for the BP and to know if they're hanging around a hook or not if you're not using a killer with map control. BBQ is an absolute MUST HAVE perk on: Nurse, Billy and especially Freddy. Everyone else it's fine for the reasons I said but they can't take advantage of it like the 3 killers I mentioned. Excluding maybe Demogorgon if you have portals placed at certain spots of course.
---
Balanced Landing still provides a benefit while you are exhausted (makes the animation shorter when you jump off) while Lithe doesn‚Äôt. Lithe is better combined with Dance With Me (Kate Denson teachable) otherwise pretty outplayed by Sprint Boost. Dead Hard is probably better than any of that anyways, aside BL on some maps - like Haddonfield.
---
I have an idea for tomorrow's tier list :D
---
Just don't try to be an asshole. Don't do anything to intentionally piss off another player.
---
She didn‚Äôt take her full course of antibiotics because she ‚Äúwas feeling better.‚Äù No pity here.
---
I play meg and im barely toxic. Not new either
---
I was playing myers and they kept spamming me to send shirtless pics.   I eventually did.  But I felt dirty
---
You could, yeah. So?
---
Shh it will be ok.

Removed for salty after game chat

When you level a survivor or killer up to lvl 30, 35, and 40, there will be a teachable perk in their bloodweb (it's orange), and once you grab it, that perk has the chance to spawn on every other killer/survivor bloodweb from that point onwards.  
---
2 survivor perks and 2 killer teachable perks appear in the shrine of secrets which is updated every week.  You can unlock these using 2000 iridescent shards which you get from leveling up, and unlock them on your other killers.  Any non-licensed killers or survivors can also be bought directly with 9000 shards.  
---
Possibly, I play on console so not sure.  
---
She's not awful, but definitely nowhere near top-tier.  She just kept getting a ton of nerfs.  If you're good with her or have fun, you can win, so it's fine.  
---
At rank 20 there's not a whole lot of new players it can put you with so you sometimes end up in unbalanced matches (and, the matchmaker is just not very good in general)

After you unlock it it shows up in others bloodweb randomly.

They can show up in the shrine of secrets.

It‚Äôs possible.

While she does suck it‚Äôs your opinion in who you play, some others killers have good perks though.

Yes matchmaking is fucked.

"Grrr whenever i play leatherface/billy i cant saw i always get looped" *bamboozle  activates, survivor runs for window, blocked, no where to go, telegraphed their movement ahead of time, dead*

Thank you kind stranger

One should only Mori scoops ahoy with the clown

Its amazing it shortens most loops by 2/3s
---
Thats the best bamboozle in the world, as an occasional leatherface i dream about bamboozling that window
---
I get that you enjoy the low effort memes for imaginary internet points. I get it. But FFS just make a separate sub for that nonsense. I'm shocked that one doesn't exist already because I'd like to talk about the game instead of seeing endless shitposts. 
---
And even when you disable the memes they still get through because people want those internet points so bad they decide to mark them as a screenshot or something else to get around the filter. It's eye rape.
---
Is there any way to predict the Shrine of Secrets with any accuracy, or are we all just praying for BBQ and DS every week? Are there any hard and fast rules that the shrine follows in terms of not giving out the newest DLC perks out within a certain timeframe, or is every perk guaranteed equal probability of appearing each week?
---
Me when I was chasing an annoying-ass Jane and almost broke chase until I realized she was running pallet to pallet

I accidentally posted this meme 8 times because it was acting like it wasn't submitting so I'm sorry for that!! Deleted all the extras.
---
"God, toxic killer main. You're realm camping this trial so hard, I can't even do gens."
---
1) Level the character to 30, 35 and 40 to get their teachables
---
2) You can either buy the dlc or hope it gets in the shrine. The shrine is a part of the shop where you can use iridescent shards to get reachable perks, it resets every Tuesday at 8pm EST, and there‚Äôll be 4 different perks that you can unlock every time
---
3) There‚Äôs a pretty big chance of a sale, but I have t seen anything concrete yet
---
4) The pig isn‚Äôt a very good killer but you should try her if you want to, I used an offering to play her once and she seemed fun but not that strong
---
5) Yeah that‚Äôs pretty normal, there isn‚Äôt a very big difference between ranks 15-20 but after that it gets more distinct
---
Hope this helps!

He‚Äôs just an underhanded killer.

Good to know!  Thank you.

He should have some shorts without the dumb apron.

Me and my girlfriend have been experiencing a glitch recently actually! Whenever I get like a daily ‚Äòblink and hit 4 survivors‚Äô (and I play on PS4 so nurse is s a nightmare to play with so I just trash it, next thing I see is either ‚Äòheal other survivors for the equivalent of 3 health states‚Äô or ‚Äòopen one exit gate with (someone)‚Äô or sabotage 2 hooks‚Äô... I‚Äôm like oooo that‚Äôs not too bad! Then I play and sweat to get that daily done... just to come back to the main menu and look at my progression and for some reason the daily has changed to a killer daily.. now this has happened to me around.. I‚Äôd say 10-15 times by now.. same with my girlfriend.
---
I've heard rumors about a reworked bloodweb, but I'm new and don't know where this info comes from. What are the proposed changes? Do we have any idea when they could be implemented? Am I late to the party and the bloodweb is already working as intended?
---
They dont accept player supplied evidence, not whatsoever, you could record someone saying the n word 100x and it wouldnt mean shit  only the report matters.
---
I mean it would be very cool for sure, its just that theres probably an entire list of killers before we get to wwe wrestler. That being said, give me a Kane or Undertaker DLC lol
---
Hello Fellow Legion player any reason for using insidious instead of something like iron maiden?
---
&gt;DBD amino
---
Can you give a link maybe?
---
you are not funny
---
A ding ding ding
---
&gt;Also I think that if you are in a SWF and your buddy DC's you shouldn't get BP.
---
no, thats unfair. sure, its shitty if they DC intentionally. but SWF players arent superhuman. they too might have random game crashes or have their internet randomly die. punishing all unlucky SWF DC'S just because some people DC intentionally is shitty
---
I see a lot of Demogorgon's play like hags. They use a tunnel to guard a hook like she uses a trap. Same for generators. They have similarities in the way they're played.
---
KILLERS ON CONSOLE WHO CLOSE THE APPLICATION WHEN THE GAME ISNT GOING THEIR WAY SO EVERYONE LOSES THEIR BLOODPOINTS INSTEAD OF JUST THE KILLER LOSING POINTS FOR DCING.
---
big oof
---
I stand corrected, this is the best DBD comment of the year.
---
Breathless Before Daytime
---
obviously the answer is die lmao
---
Wish granted. Now they're stuck laying on top of the hook and you still can't reach them.
---
I think it‚Äôs ironic that the high level players disconnect more often.
---
thanks :)
---
Thats my policy. I won‚Äôt do anything until you are toxic to me, whether I am playing killer or survivor.
---
My favorite is sloppy butcher so you can track blood while chasing
---
And now he's making a post saying dh should be nerfed
---
Same brother
---
This especially legit when scared it the turned hell and out followed of me me lol.
---
Just grab all the perks you can get, if there's multiple grab whichever seems more useful. I wouldn't really use stridor on nurse tbh and I'd only use whispers at all on any killer if it's level 3. Iron grasp is ok but not great and monstrous shrine is literally the worst killer perk in the game so I wouldn't recommend that really...
---
Feels bad being one of the only 10 Clown Mains in existence. We‚Äôre almost as extinct as Heavy mains in TF2
---
You always have to rely on others. It may or may not work out. I play solo too, thinking about only yourself is already a losing battle. That said
---
DS, unbreakable, inner strength, balanced. Basically take twos and a see ya later.
---
Michael out of the ones I have
---
&gt;Having legacy skins is not a point
---
It's more of a point than your 500 hours. It illustrates that I've been playing this game since the start.
---
&gt;So you are wrong, and you called some with half a thousand hours a noob. Big brain time
---
Not everyone at 500 hours is a noob, but if they've played this long and are unable to grasp stuff like this, then it's a fair conclusion to come to.
---
&gt;If it doesn't matter, why are you still replying?
---
It doesn't matter that you're doing it wrong, because of the previous point. It matters a little bit that there's a consensus on what to do so people understand what you're trying to say when on hook.
---
The Demogorgon buff seems splendid. Can‚Äôt escape if hatch isn‚Äôt available ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
1v1? In DBD? Umm what?
---
Had this Jake go into basement while injured and on death hook. I downed him with a hatchet then downed the survivor that got rescued. Got DS'd on purpose and then went to pick up the Jake, hooked and killed him then he sent me messages saying that I tunneled.
---
Around 2~ minutes later I got a message from some random guy with some code injection looking shit and decided to not open that message. Reported it to sony and they got a breach of conduct.
---
Post game chat be like

&gt;FUCKING TOXIC KILLER TRYHARD ASSHOLE KILL YOURSELF SHITHEAD
---
Didnt you know? Doing the objective is toxic
---
How I look when I‚Äôm about to use Dead Hard and run into a wall:
---
Found the bill main. Also not entirely accurate, I just main Steve because he‚Äôs neat
---
And yet when survivors say moris and prayer beads are toxic killer mains will go on a huge rant about how entitled survivors are.
---
You can't have it both ways, you can't say tools in the survivors disposal are "toxic" but then go and defend bullshit killer items.
---
Woah that looks really good.
---
Oh yeah I know. But at this point it will get more value over whispers. 
---
I just havent really found any good perks. Sloppy butcher and noed is pretty much it but noed doesnt help me mid game lol
---
Chat screenshot. Please.
---
r/entitledsurvivors
---
Why does it matter, thats why youre optimistic. Optimism is "Nah, its fine ill kill them without ruin"
---
I like to pair sloppy with nurses so I can recommend that
---
a chase challenge, see who can survive the longest in chase.
---
thats what I assume atleast
---
IF YOU TUNNEL AND CAMP AS A KILLER, DON‚ÄôT ACT LIKE YOU‚ÄôRE A GOD AT THE GAME. THERE, I SAID IT. IT‚ÄôS LITERALLY ONE OF THE LEAST EFFECTIVE METHODS; AND IF YOU KILL EVERYONE WITHIN THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES OF A MATCH OR GEN-RUSH, YOU‚ÄôRE AN ASSHOLE. TRY TO SPACE SOME TIME OUT FOR POINTS FOR GODSAKES, USE YOUR HEAD INSTEAD OF JUST RUSHING A MATCH, IT DOESN‚ÄôT DO ANYONE GOOD.
---
I main pig and ghost face. There's something so fun about jump scaring survivers. For fun, I play Leatherface. I really enjoy his brute force with the chainsaw. I also have a lot of fun playing as Huntress. Being able to have projectiles that you can throw is really fun.
---
How am I uncultured for considering bad acting bad? In the first movie he looks as if he was about to fart while they are eating his friend alive in front of him. The 2016 thing is much better at least.
---
I main Billy as-is. Zooming around the map is fun and it‚Äôs pretty satisfying to snipe someone with the saw from long range. 
---
If I had to choose another, excluding Nurse and Spirit, I‚Äôd probably go Myers/Ghostface for stealth lulz.
---
That was the idea but nurse tier one is very meh. But I just unlocked spirit fury so maybe that will help? I mean it's a bit against the idea of nurse vyt you know. Maybe just the shock of it actually being used will be helpful lol.
---
Okay but when the fuck has a Nancy ever played like a baby Dweet? They're literally Meg 2.0.
---
A survivor said he *deserved* the hatch because his teammates all DCd and he didn't struggle when I picked him up, but he spent the entire game teabagging and following me around clicking a flashlight at me. He did absolutely nothing for his team other than trying to body block a hook a single time. I ignored him the entire game while he followed me around doing nothing for his team, I could hear him the entire game just clicking his flashlight trying to get me to chase him. 
---
Normally I do give the hatch to the last guy if someone disconnects early on cause that's just hell for the survivors, the thing about this game was they all disconnected after all the gens were done. First guy disconnected when I smacked him off the gate, second guy disconnected when I ran him into a bear trap I left on the other side of a window, third guy disconnected when he stepped in the trap I left at one of the gates. It was just me and this jackass that's been clicking a flashlight at the back of my head the entire game, turn around to find him crouching behind a tree trying to hide. I chased him to a dropped pallet that had a trap on the other side and he ran right into it. He messages me as soon as the game ends crying about how I'm toxic because I didn't give him the hatch.
---
Im not sure realy what you whant us to do, do you whant build sugestions or tips on how to use your perks propperly so they help instead of harm? Do you whant us to help you make the best build with what you currently got?
---
Fun and good. But lits of counterplay so dont be surprised if you have a game of no one falling to your traps. His a mid tier killer, good but you have to work for it. His my main along with ghostface
---
FUCK YES FUCK THIS FUCK YOU, SERVERS
---
Yea the 4 man SWF were all slaming me with lockers the entire game
---
My point is in 500 hours, I have never seen what you say literally EVERYONE since beta has done. In fact, I see the exact opposite. You saying "Well I have more hours than you, so I'm more right" doesn't mean anything
---
"Ree ree this guy doesn't get my backwards logic. He must be stupid or something"
---
I‚Äôm actually a Nea main I just think he‚Äôs wholesome plus he has 2 amazing perks
---
The hatch will take them to the upside down if they get in, so they are forced to leave by gates.
---
You must be new here. The killer's objectives are split into chasing, hitting, sacrificing, and using their power effectively. You're being disingenuous. I'm not denying that killers make more bloodpoints, because they do. But acting like killers do no work to get those bloodpoints isn't making this community any better. They are adding more ways to make blood points and are constantly reworking perks to give bonus BP to survivors. Give it time. If you really want BP then play killer I guess.
---
Like i get hes bottom tier but ill be damned if i dont have fun 99% of the time i play Legion
---
He just zooms around and yeets over pallets and its great
---
Cool idea, but I can totally see Vince Mcmahon trying to scam bhvr lmao
---
True, unbreakable and borrowed time are great. Can‚Äôt agree on wholesome though.
---
Has a game on The Game against a spirit, and there was a pretty bad spot where two teammates got downed while to saving me from the basement. I got myself downed on purpose because I had DS and borrowed, let the other two teammates get hooked, then let the spirit pick me up so I could hit her with DS. as soon as I was able to move, I ran back down into the basement and saved both of my teammates from certain death with borrowed. I got downed again and died, but my teammates got out of the basement and lost the killer. After the match was over, they sent me a bunch of positive basements on how I was A really good player, and that they were sorry they couldn't save me. I felt good after that.
---
You know the type of person who would get mad and demand this will upon losing claim rng didn't give them a fair chance on the procedural maps

It's going to be abused.

Ah, OK, I understand, guess we were never meant to be lol.
---
Power to your boyfriend though, dressing up like that seems like it takes a lot of time and skill honestly.
---
I THINK YOU MISSED THE /S, BUD
---
God tier maybe three patches ago. Before they added locker aura blocking and changes the generator auras to red. Most killers just run it for the bloodpoints. Get that through your head.
---
Holy shit if I wouldn't have looked through that list I would have never known there are *2* Doritos Crash Course games
---
We have our own chainsaw at home. I can make real chainsaw noises whenever I want.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I 100% agree. I very very rarely play killer, I just don‚Äôt enjoy it. It‚Äôs generally harder, I mean, it‚Äôs 1 vs 4. Not to mention that if you don‚Äôt run at least some meta perks you‚Äôll get rolled quite easily. 
---
And honestly? Some survivors are real toxic assholes and it just makes me feel like crap playing killer so I don‚Äôt.
---
Not Surprised after some Killers tried to make Totem Rushing a thing
---
Or Yvie's finale headpiece!

Please tell me you messaged them with this video

Did the event already start? Holy dang I'm so out of date.

Bill mains rise up

maybe in yellow ranks he is

ahhh nice! you're giving me hope to play legion too! Im currently in my ghostface main phase

XD

I'd agree if half of these suggestions were about increasing fun, and not about "the other side has this thing I want/nerf please" whine posts. Miss me with this.

It‚Äôs only because you started playing it just now. You need all the good killer perks that‚Äôs why. That‚Äôs the reason why there are high ranking survivors who rarely win...

Did you just say the 2016 reboot is better than the originals

I'm waiting to make sure everyone is out. I can leave but I'd rather wait.

Guess it‚Äôs about time for me to make my *decisive strike*
---
had a survivor say that pallets should respawn and that they should've won...after using literally every pallet they saw
---
He's a lot of fun, you just have to be tricky with your traps. I'll put them in places no one expects (random trees I expect survivors to use for loops,  around random structures, or even random patches of grass) I'll usually trap survivors at least 4 times this way.
---
Not gonna lie it was Biker Kate that broke me. Now I have almost every skin in the game on Claudette and Nea. HELP ME

i believe you mean interview tape? tbh ive never tried high stimulus electrode + scrapped tape and i have no idea what it would do

Midnight Rider for sure!

I just finished playing match where the palates texture didn't load in. They all had this weird grayish baby blue color

I like it. =) Keep up the good work

Pretty sure we're getting an event specific bp offering so no need for all those :)
---
lol nooo dont abuse your godgiven talents

flair checks out

I don‚Äôt use nurse or spirit so I‚Äôd say my normal man Myers. Or maybe learn ghost face
---
This is exactly how a Dweet reacted when he was trying to go for a flashlight save but then I mori'd the person right in front of him. We kind of just stared at each other for a bit before he ran away lol
---
Identity V is a quality rip off, it does enough differently, while very little.
---
Hell, it got a Joker from Persona 5
---
Steve should replace Nancy, and have it say ‚ÄúBaby Dweet but different‚Äù
---
Killer threatened to report us because he said we abused the hitbox because he was camping but still could not get anyone cause we kept grabbing each other right before struggle. Or a killer called us hackers because he did not know how to time a minute and said it was way passed what‚Äôs funny is it was a random who did it

huh i guess you really hate new players

I‚Äôd main Wraith because he‚Äôs fun and actually pretty damn good imo.  For fun I like to play Clown, just laughing every time I get pallet stunned lightens the mood.
---
I enjoy clown quite a lot he‚Äôs more forgotten sadly but I think he‚Äôs a super fun fella to play
---
I hope not
---
you are playing NURSE she needs no real build bc she is NURSE u want a tip if you aren't sure what to use on NURSE you aren't ready to play her since u dont know the pain of the NURSE I keep capping it just so u see what I am trying to say   
---
it is NURSE SHE NEEDS NOTHING TO WORK GOOD
---
Trapper bc I want to have fun? Nurse is boring and spirit is just as boring
---
Nah, probably had their menu open and didn‚Äôt realize they were being handed the hatch.
---
Of course NOED ended up spawning on this totem as well.
---
someone downvoted you for that comment lol, cant imagine why, anyway with ruin there are a few small tricks to let it live longer, you will obviously try and hook someone further away from it if you can, but one thing that a lot of killers still do is start the game and immediately go and check on their totem, mainly because this game is notorious for spawning 4 survivors right on top of it, regardless, DONT DO THIS.  
---
If survivors spawn on top of a hex its getting cleansed and theres fuck all you can do about it, but if they dont spawn on the hex and when the game starts they see the killer make a straight line to some inconspicuous corner of the map, look around and then fuck off again, thats tell tale body language that the killer just checked their totem, when im survivor and i hear the heart beat very early i find the killer and watch them, 8/10 times they compramise their totems hiding spot.
---
I don't play Survivor... but if I did I'd probably go Tapp or Ash.
---
now THAT would be broken
---
*joker voice*

It‚Äôs not about escaping.... it‚Äôs about sending a message...

So mods, why does this get to stay, but the video of my son looking through a chest making a similar noise as in the game, titled Training for the Entity gets removed?

Ah, makes sense.

apologies, its my default reaction to assume everyones on pc, yes basically use operating system clients to report not in game reports.

I‚Äôve read too many fanfictions to not know where this is going........

I was gonna say hey atleast the killer didn't have noed right? Then I see this and i feel very sad for you

How to break perks 101.
---
" Each time you hook a survivor, you see the aura of 1/2/3 generators that  have over 50% progress for 10 seconds *AND* you get a token. Cap 3. When  you have 3 tokens, the next generator that you damage that has over 50%  progress gets fully regressed. "so this would mean you get a token everytime you hook somebody - after 3hooks you can 99 to 0 one gen... you lose one token... with the next hook you get another token (you are back at 3 again) and you can 99 to 0 the next gen... you can basically use it 5 times (6 for the lulz after you killed the last survivor) to destroy 5 gens almost finished... this perk would be more overpowered than bbq&amp;chili and ruin combined /edit: think about the possibilities combined with ruin - and imagine this perk with 3-stack-killers... dont know if i should laugh wickedly or should cry in deep pain
---
Entity: ‚ÄúNo! This isn‚Äôt how you‚Äôre supposed to play the game.‚Äù

How is my post unrelated to dbd
---
So that's what happened... lmao nice to see you again - the life alert huntress
---
Each account level you get gives shards, no level requirement.
---
Didn't say it was. They told me that my post could be posted in another form and still be relevant to that forum. So can yours. They said mine wasn't unique to DBD.
---
Unfortunate but yes.

At least you can get bloodpoints and even play the game. Much rather have that
---
What the actual fuck is totem rushing?
---
I wish I had it.
---
Sorry i forgot how much fun lobbies n loading screens are. Even if its a quick match its still an actual match
---
Unfortunately even if you had no other perks unlocked, you'd still have to be level 42 to get everything Tier 3. (12 Universal perks, 3 Nurse perks minus Level 1 of those)
---
Best thing you can do is just never skip taking a perk even if you don't want it. At I believe level 40 you will be offered 3 perks and can purchase 2. At level 50 this increases to 4 offered perks, still only able to buy two.
---
So whats the max i can earn?
---
I must be pretty fortunate in most cases that I haven't seen people like that! I've seen a few toxic clauds, but never Neas? I've been playing for a shorter time than most people though, so that might explain it.
---
And take my upvote, that was a good play, I was dazzled at wtf just went on in that moment
---
I replaced it with small game. My survivability has gone up now thst I can nip hex perks in the bud.
---
wraith in the lake
---
I hope I cross paths with you in  game while playing scoops Steve so I can get the hatch. I‚Äôm never toxic so don‚Äôt worry lol.
---
Oh, we all know who is. Those who play by their own made up rulebook.
---
You implied it. By comparing our posts in that way you made it seem like either both or neither posts should be on the subreddit. If you think the mods didn‚Äôt make the right decision, rather than commenting on another post, you should take it up with the mods.
---
Yeah because people are really going to farm bloodpoints by having a friend dc lmao.
---
Just keep the photo for a year when they release the new skin. It‚Äôs a good photo. 
---
Sorry in advance for all the Shirtless Myers requests that you will likely get.
---
Thanks, I was looking in the wrong part of the wiki before
---
Yes I agree. However it is better for people to split up on gens when you do this as this avoids people regressing the gen.
---
Think its a couple hundred per level.
---
But as for a limit there isn't one.
---
Based on what they told me, neither my post nor yours should be on this board according to their rules.
---
Thats boring but not waiting in more lobbies and loading screens after you just did for no reason? Its not like you dont get 4 man games where theres 1 or 2 survivors who are pretty much worthless anyways. Basically a 3 man at that point too. Ya they arent as good of matches but at least you can play and get a few bloodpoints
---
And I didn't imply anything, you inferred it.
---
So did you not do shit all game and hide?
---
This looks like that old bowling alley meme
---
Is it a Chinese game?
---
Freddy is a pedo but he's just a character and a monster. The guy who owns the rights to JC is a convicted pedo and would be getting money from JC being in the game.
---
No offense, but did you just not think to Google?
---
Or are you saying you did Google and was just turned off by their catalog?
---
Also killers at rank 1: "it couldn't have anything to do with me using an ebony Mori and just making sure everyone is dead without doing anything else." I'm a rank 19 but I've seen the killers in those ranks
---
You aren't ignoring perks altogether when there aren't good ones in the web, ... Are you?
---
The last original killer I loved was the Plague. She's one of the best.
---
&gt; but that‚Äôs where spine chill comes into play
---
I'd buy into this argument 100%...if we could see what killer we were facing before the match starts and pick our perks accordingly. That isn't how the game works though. As it stands, this is basically making the argument that everyone should run spine chill 100% of the time just in case they happen to run into a spirit running a specific add-on. Its an unreasonable expectation.
---
Killers are OP and now have telekinesis. Please NERF!!
---
Then *pop goes the weasel*
---
For your next piece, can you draw them fucking?
---
I disrespect you and your entire family tree for misspeaking about god-tier Ruahperson
---
I ran the killer for a good bit, pallet stunned them throughout the chase and then did two gens.
---
Like I said, how is my post unrelated
---
Aye fair enough I main killer hate survivor even SWF sucks to me and every game I got someone running it I don‚Äôt follow meta perks or whatever thought a majority runs it
---
Wraith lol, I've always loved Wraith, he's just weak.
---
Don't mention 60fps or you will make the console people cry. D:
---
I didn't say it's unrelated. I don't think it's unrelated.
---
I mean what exactly are you hoping for here?
---
"Save me so I can go down again and you can get hatch" (Redundant)
---
"Save me so you can go down and I can get hatch" (Selfish)
---
"Save me so we both can go down and die on hook" (Pointless)
---
What's your endgame? Are you really trying to finish the rest of the gens as a group of 2? Because that's absolutely not happening.
---
Just take away their M1 and then the game will finally be balanced.
---
So on what basis are you saying it should be removed
---
Did i start this? Or was it already a thing lol
---
I would still main legion. Legion at high ranks is a well paying job, with good benefits and paid vacation
---
You should probably fact check.
---
I haven‚Äôt played nurse really ever and I haven‚Äôt played spirit since her launch month.  
---
I play on a rotation between everyone except Nurse/Spirit/Billy/Hag/Legion/Clown.
---
I focus on 8 hooks and usually let people leave.
---
A fucking MORON, plain &amp; simple!!
---
I'm a bit apprehensive about anyone that goes out of their way to mention they tossed pallets.  You can judge the quality of your chase but how long it lasted vs. how few pallets you used during it.
---
They followed Stephen King so I'm certain we're getting Pennywise in the future. The way game design works is that their character designers work on multiple rigs and designs. 
---
So it's safe to say that Behaviour have multiple killers already designed and their powers already written down and planned out on paper.
---
I'm not saying it should be removed. You have really poor reading comprehension.
---
Those swinging hammers are scarier than an ebony mori ngl
---
Oh he's a troll oh he's toxic blah blah this community whines about everything instead of learning. Hate ds? Slug the survivor and let em sit for a minute other survivors will waste time healing and sitting around a corner for the heal in case you leave. Hate flashlights face a wall during pickup animation. Hate insta med kits? Its a very limited resource and consumes the med kit slowing down the game for survivors in the long run. Finally just use otzcheats.com and you'll get more 4k/3k w/hatch. Killers have a huge advantage up till the red ranks. Use overpowered add-ons is just a crutch for killers anyways. Stick to necessity add-ons that you should be bringing every game (tar bottle/bag on trapper, babushka on huntress, Myers memorial on Mikey for example) and you won't need crutch add-ons/survivors won't DC when they get insta hatchet or play a 40min game against slow down Freddy.
---
*Sob* The horror!  *Waaaah!*
---
I‚Äôve said it before: they really should have a daily login bonus that gives out 100 auric cells a week. It would still take a couple months to buy a premium skin but they would be within reach. And don‚Äôt say they wouldn‚Äôt make any money that way because studies show it‚Äôs just the opposite. The person who is willing to wait three months to buy a skin is never going to spend money either way. But there are plenty of people who would balk at spending ten dollars on a skin who will pay five dollars for it after saving up some currency (especially since they‚Äôre getting it ‚Äúat half point‚Äù).
---
So stop whining on other people‚Äôs posts and keep your personal problems to yourself
---
Dude you made them so damn salty
---
Both me (I'm bi) and my gay brother agree drag queens are gross as fuck, discount crossdresser who are way to flashy
---
Maybe she just didn't trust that you were really just going to close the hatch immediately. I know I probably wouldn't...  
---
you were too far to do that in time, though. She still should have known!
---
That's epic.
---
No it isn‚Äôt.  Maybe it‚Äôs some other kind of game, but it isn‚Äôt DBD
---
I agree. Ive only ever seen teammates get annoyed at each other when someone isn't pulling their weight or is being selfish or toxic.
---
putting a portal near a gen is a good strategy because you can see survivors heartbeats.
---
Hey, as a legion player I‚Äôd suggest you switch out insidious for sloppy butcher if you have it
---
Also fellow Julie user hello
---
I already don't main either of those killers.  I flat out don't play Nurse period and very rarely play Spirit.  I've got a rotation about 9 killers deep but my main is probably Freddy or Trapper.
---
playing as a dweet is a automatic advantage, everyone thinks ur a baby
---
If I‚Äôm actually using rancour, I agree.
---
Let me correct myself cause it does sound a bit pretentious.  I kept the killer occupied because they continued to chase me for the majority of the game and the killer was getting stunned with every pallet and wouldn‚Äôt break them so I continued to loop the killer.
---
It's a relevant problem that is made even more relevant by your post. My problem isn't with you or your post. It's with the mods selecting mine for removal and leaving yours, when in my opinion both are worthy of the page.
---
This post is irrelevant
---
I mean has Nancy flair so xd
---
I do tho
---
this is because of dedicated servers - now the survivor has enough time to potentially react and jump in before close data reaches the server.
---
I took a protection hit, safe unhooked you, bodyblocked and still die on first hook...
---
There's no secret. Grab one and keep going
---
FUCKING 20 MINUTES QUEUE TIMES FOR A 3 MAN DC AND HATCH ESCAPE IN 5 MINS I FUCKING HATE THIS SHIT
---
No, I just wasnt sure if I should be.
---
Just a reminder that they also made the Drake and Josh DS game.
---
Well obviously people didnt agree since it was changed to the way it currently is. I personally would much rather just queue up for another match than waste my time for a mediocre amount of blood points and a boring match
---
Its like "gen camping" except more made up lol
---
It should have had the cat as the demogorgon
---
WOW. That‚Äôs intense. (You know what also ‚Äúintense‚Äù? Camping?! Haha, get it. In tents... intense. *sigh* I‚Äôm done here.)
---
Took long enough for ya to come up with that reply but I'll keep it going I have no issues really with any of the perks in the game I was discussing ppl disconnecting when I use add ons as killer I main freddy and do quite well myself first season back in years and made it to rank 6 being red ranks without add ons but for some reason ppl think that its unfair for a killer to have add ons apparently because most of the time half the damn room drops when they start the match asleep
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Player_Level
---
NERF SPIRIT ALREADY
---
Our posts aren‚Äôt the same. Don‚Äôt you think the mods have a reason to remove yours? They don‚Äôt just roll dice to decide what stays.
---
It's all RNG so there isn't much to be done but always get perks no matter what to just get them out of your way. I usually focus on tier 2 and 3 of perks just to stop seeing them pop up.
---
i did google and recognized none of their games, which tbh all looked like cheap casual/mobile games
---
*beating
---
No just no don't do it ;-; dont fall to her wheezes
---
I never said killers are undeserving of their points. Also, realistically if you down and hook someone as a killer your gonna get points in all 4 categories. But if for example you repair a gen as a survivor, you'll only get points in 1 category and not a lot of points at that
---
Ah, got it. And I still kind of got that impression today so definitely understandable. Did you not think the experience would be worth your time?
---
Not trying to be in your business, I just like hearing little stories like this.
---
That actually looks really cool
---
Pretty sure it would still be dbd bud?
---
I could swear that when I was super nice to the survivors (let them all go on purpose), and played like 10 games like that in a row, my queue loaded up as fast as survivor queue.
---
Just the outfit
---
She's mocking him.
---
I was being sarcastic. In that situation i think they have to undo the portal first and then they will be able to use the hatch.
---
I actually got 3 kills as Hillbilly and the last one escaped, and literally one the survivors that died says "gg ez" to which I responded "Says the one who died" and then reported him afterwards.
---
I mean I'd pick apart some of the more absurd placements but then again you did label this a shitpost so seems pointless to treat it as an actual ranking.
---
Alright well then why dont they make it so if anyone d/c during the match which happens pretty often, everyone gets kicked out of the match and nobody gets bloodpoints. Because 3v1 is soooo scary and completely unplayable..
---
I would prolly get deaded
---
A mostly indoors map with maze as the only outdoors part
---
That jump scare at 4 meters was not cool, I know the hag pops up in the game like that but damn my heart.
---
gens dont matter its the time they took that matters
---
I really hope this doesn't walk out the hatch or do that thing like the pig does wear when you actually escape it just kills you I mean I'd be OK with  Needing to disable the portal 1st before you can use the hatch or before the hatch will open that would be more fair
---
I mean me and my friend pulled it off once, plus I don‚Äôt think you read the title of the post
---
if it is dead in the middle then there would be no point for the match to get canceled cause you already got work done and still have somewhat a shot at winning. it is not all about winning but I cannot blame anyone who does not wanna do a match they do not even have a shot at winning just how I feel. if you want it changed to make it so there is a setting that way if it ever happened those who have it set to play the match can play it as normal. that way everyone wins. so if a match is going to get canceled those who have the setting turned on can join the match just fine :) that way both sides get what they want
---
If every survivor spent a week working to get consistent great skillchecks, Ruin would need to be reworked.
---
It's still scummy af though.  The difference between that and a DC on your first down is mostly semantics.  It's essentially the same result and you screw your teamates over just as much.  It's just a slightly different method for accomplishing the same result.
---
I wonder when you were doing that if you were thinking, "I gee I hope everyone  enjoys playing this  match including  the killer". Or where you just being toxic?
---
I agree. I hardly ever see Jeffs.
---
hahaha hell yeah!
---
may contain explicit content
---
The old versions are way better
---
Happy Cake Day btw
---
Why would anyone think the outfit is toxic I mean I think it looks dumb as hell but it's not toxic?
---
 Truly toxic is wearing bright neon colors and then running up to your teammates right after the killer sees you.  And yes I speak from experience I actually had this happen to me today someone were in bright neon eighties outfit looking colors ran around not helping until they found the killer  Then proceeded to read him straight to the rest of us one by one
---
I never say it, only when I'm in my car alone with the windows down, then I belt out singing "NIIIGGARRROOOOO NIGAROOOOOO NIGGGGGAAAROOOOO"
---
Myers, ghostface, plague, huntress, or Freddy 
---
I play a lot of killers lol
---
Stonks
---
Don't let them pressure you like that, show off that pink hair!
---
It is!!
---
I wish mine would change
---
The original got a 7.5 the 2013 one got a6.5
---
No, DBD is a 1 v 4 game that is reasonably balanced.
---
The 1 v 3 game you‚Äôre talking about is: either the killer chooses to curb stomp some unfortunate souls, or to be nice and farm/let them go.  
---
You actually enjoy 3 survivor matches?  I know I‚Äôm not the only one that spent years having this occasionally happen and think to my self ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather they just cancel the match‚Äù
---
Vince Devil puppet confirmed new killer lol
---
Ive won plenty short handed matches. And honestly im not that great with survivor. Everyone acts like its impossible but i think (not all but most) who are against 3vs1 are people who think if they dont win its not fun. Even if you dont escape you can still get in chases and save others, do as many gens as you can, plus the hatch opens no matter what now. People just want everything to be easy
---
indefinite even.
---
This was me when I had like two spirit dailies lol
---
Is that the inspiration for Meg?
---
just giving you my opinion is all like I said I personally do not want to go in a match as 3v1 as survivor or killer. so like I said before add a setting so everyone wins
---
I saw a jeff on the PTB, he was a toxic flashlight clicking gamer. Other than that, never seen him.
---
"At least pretend like you're trying to save me first"
---
No? Why don't you pretend like you're trying to save me? Unlike you, I actually have a solid chance of escaping this trial. Whereas you're immobilized, the killer knows where you are, and the killer will be notified when you're saved, while I'm free and hidden, which of us do you think has a shot at making it out of trial?
---
Cut your losses. Don't fuck over your teammates. If you get hooked at 2 alive, you're likely going to die, and your teammate is likely going to live. Get over it. Don't be selfish.
---
Ok, if anyone ever d/c in your match even twards the end, leave the match. Because 1v3 is so scary. Im not that great at survivor but ive survived plenty of short handed matches. People just want wins handed to them so if anything makes it harder theyre against it
---
rip pig
---
Silly hag! Livers aren't for eating!

*Laughs in invisibility*

---
Lmao
---
They should just go down immediately if they use head on coming out of the locker or they fast/slow vault out
---
bing bong
---
nice
---
I swear I think it‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that survivor spawns can be right next to totems. For the past seven games I‚Äôve played as killer, my ruin was gone within seconds because they spawned next to it.
---
The reason I'm sharing this is because if you try to look up any of these ciphers or messages or theories not a lot comes up, I'm hoping to get everyone interested in this as the new update comes out and hopefully more theories start popping up on the world of DBD
---
People already disconnect midmatch if someone else disconnects and if you mean the literal middle of the match (2-3 gens done), theres gens already done and the person had likely served their purpose, so you don't really have a point here imo
---
if you truly want to believe that go ahead just giving my honest opinion about it. as I been playing this game for a very long time and it was very annoying when it was a thing
---
I just didn't want an internship for a company I didn't care about, I guess. I suppose I should mention that at the time I was under a cooperative program at my university, that helped students find internships, but in return expected good performance and motivation from us, and I have to admit that was putting me under a good bit of anxiety - so overall it didn't feel like it was worth the risk of me not liking them at all and then having to pull myself through the whole internship without real motivation.
---
I feel like they did this to meme
---
I hate how everyone disrespects leatherface without even giving him a try. I‚Äôve put over 300+ hours into him and he‚Äôs the best killer for just messing around and having fun. If you don‚Äôt focus on winning, you‚Äôll have a good time with him. Memes&gt; victory
---
One rewards you for completing your main objective, the other rewards you for losing.
---
Not comparable in the slightest.
---
perhaps it was a really heavy desync and from his perspective he saw what he thought was you just standing still in the middle of nowhere so he chainsawed it and the game thought you got downed.
---
Don‚Äôt let them get gens done and you won‚Äôt have an issue with adrenaline. Same can be said about noed by doing totems. The difference is that survivors have to change their gameplay to avoid noed while killers just have to play as usual.
---
First hook last hook.
---
Squeeze them to DEATH? What a monster.
---
If I'm wrong then why did they change it from how OP wants it to how it currently is after the complaints, which were wide spread both in this sub and the forums? Do you have some secret data only you know of?
---
I can't tell what the bottom image is in your thumbnail you posted
---
That's very true. Using perks as a counter for a killer's ability/addons is difficult because you don't know what killer you're going to have.
---
However I had a game today against The Spirit (I play on PS4) and the way I was able to know if she was coming/where she was going was by looking at the crows. If they suddenly started flying away around me I knew to abandon the gen I was on. It's not the most trustworthy plan but I'm surprised nobody ever brings up using crows as a warning.
---
W h a t d i d y o u j u s t s a y
---
Why? Can people be that toxic?
---
bamboozle nurse
---
its not "scary" its just not the game I signed up for.  
---
unless the killer is an absolute potato, they literally just get to pick if they're going to end the match early, or be nice and let people live.
---
The only flavor in this ocean is salt
---
Thanks for sharing! Totally understand your situation. Only thing worse than a bad job is job you just don't give a damn about. Can really ruin your whole mood for the day.
---
Right. If you just keep spending bloodpoints on a character rarity doesn't matter because unless you prestige you'll just keep hoarding the goods.
---
I made it the purpose of my actions very clear. ‚ÄúMaximum Dickheadedness‚Äù is the clear indication. 
---
I don‚Äôt give a shit if the killer has fun. As is the nature of even a semi competitive environment :)
---
3 man lobbies arent fun to me and many others though, that's the point. I'd rather play a full fun match, than a 3 man where most likely people are gonna just disconnect instantly anyways. It's pretty commonplace for the killer to decide to farm or disconnect both before the update and when someone disconnects post loading in
---
Ah he‚Äôs good as well he just takes sometime to get used to his chainsaw. And also map knowledge and survivor knowledge really help out leatherface as well. 
---
He‚Äôs very addon or pwyf dependent though.
---
IT WOULDNT FUEL MY INNER RAGE FOR PLAYING THIS GAME! REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Yeah that one was
---
Adrenaline literally relies on the survivors doing their objective, NOED relies on the killer failing theirs. If anything, decicive strike has a better argument for being a "crutch" perk but even that i disagree with.
---
no0b3 still does this? its a mindgame from 2017. almost never works on good killers
---
In all my Hours as a mostly Killer Main, i found the Bills to be always the most adorable survivors of them all.
---
I don‚Äôt know what it is that Bill has that lures in all the new Survivors, but they pick him a lot of times.
---
Besides that, when i play Surv i‚Äôm appearently uwu because Kate
---
back in my day we tunneled jakes to prevent saboing
---
also, I usually don't care about "wins" whatever that means.
---
prob cause the killers are new and no dbd on console is not compatible for mouse and keyboard
---
Why are your teammates flexing so hard their skin comes off?
---
We‚Äôve gone full circle 
---
‚ÄúBHVR no one likes 3 man matches, just cancel the match‚Äù
---
*makes it so 3 man matches cancel the match*
---
‚ÄúBHVR no one likes it when the match is cancelled just let us play the 3 man match‚Äù
---
Good idea, i have another one. Change noed to if the gens are done, everybody immediatly dies. Or change spirit fury to if anyone pallet stuns you, every pallet on the map breaks.
---
That honestly looks pretty cool.
---
I main Nancy and I‚Äôll take that as a compliment
---
I did that in the early days of the game and my god the salt that created. The trapping animation was so long back then too, so you'd just have to sit and wait in confusion .
---
Well. BP. Not no. 
---
And sorry for the phone picture. I did a 30 capture and didnt want to just upload a clip of 20 seconds of loading time.
---
This is a bug your not actually rank 13, but it lists that on your endgame screen its weird.
---
I only wanted that chapter for Sidney.
---
Man‚Äôs just tryna get my *ace in the hole*
---
Adrenaline can only be called a crutch if you use it at the perfect time with swf imo
---
Your are correct. Best killer perk in the game.
---
They are.
---
you open lockers 100% faster and if a locker is opened all survivors are immediately sacrificed
---
Don‚Äôt worry the survivor never got to it i closed it as soon as it opened
---
Nothing would change, Wraith.
---
I think I'll take my chances with the regular gates. 
---
That looks awesome though! Really looks like the Upside Down is taking over.
---
both are pretty BS and unfun for the other side, they need some changes
---
No because it's a dead beaten horse false equivalency.  One rewards you for playing optimally while the other rewards you for playing poorly or possibly not at all (it's fully possible to spend the game afk and still get NOED to proc).
---
Also the effects of NOED are considerably stronger and longer lasting than Adrenaline which is over and done with in seconds.  Can't wait for this tired comparison to get shot behind the barn Ol Yeller style.
---
"You kept camping your ruin and downing us"  
---
"Why did you keep charging in there as a group not doing gens"  
---
"Cause you were camping ruin!"   
---
This was with trapper by the way and they kept hitting traps trying to get to it..Oh survivors...
---
Meanwhile Ghostface‚Äôs daily just requires you to stalk a survivor while leaning, learn Turkish, recite a million digits of pi, come in first for a marathon, and then down the survivor and repeat 3 more times
---
So your  one of those toxic players that are ruining the game. Just wanted clarification. Awesome.
---
A beanie
---
I‚Äôm curious what your full tier list is
---
The funny part is this portal was there for my gen traveling and surprise surprise hatch spawns right on it like what are the odds of that happening
---
Nice i think its great! i wouldnt have the patients
---
Is it like. Rounding up on the pips or something.
---
Or atleast give me the hit before leaving instead of being a bitch... :(
---
No matter what they change in the game theres gonna be people on both sides ya know?
---
Is that the Chandler Bing or Chanandler Bong?
---
Dude, I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only one who does this shit. Can‚Äôt kill a Steve intentionally... They always get hatch and since I don‚Äôt care about Moris, I won‚Äôt be killing a Steve. Bonus points if they‚Äôre Scoops or Babysitter.
---
You gonna go cry about people like me on the forums? Lol. Yep there‚Äôs your clarification kiddo. Go nuts
---
They still bled out
---
But how are you supposed to distinguish a suicide on hook from someone actually trying to hop off?
---
God I want Ace in the Hole
---
you gotta be stupid if you can‚Äôt pronounce yamamokeistanidinshadafangshuanipoving‚Äôs haunting
---
it rounds down or up if your 1 pip away.
---
Just wanted clarification. No need to get so defensive. Especially  since you choose to be a trash person.
---
God I want those back, loved playing with them
---
*A DING DING DING UwU will now come to order*
---
Thank the lord lol
---
Only idiots attempt to Kobe.  It's an incredibly selfish thing to do and is supposed to be reserved for situations where you need to because nobody else can or is coming for you.  Also killing yourself on hook is typically followed by skipping the entire struggle phase and allowing yourself to die as quick as possible on first hook.  Again dick move.
---
Doc.
---
What are you smoking? He's probably like the 5th worst killer.
---
I honestly doubt we‚Äôre getting Pennywise. They wouldn‚Äôt do the exact same thing they did for last chapter to hint towards the next. They even told King in an interview that they watch Paulie and try to trick him.
---
I suppose, although I still think 3 man games were atrocious 
---
To each their own, I just thought it was ironic
---
 that looks really cool.
---
Glad it doesn't delete portals like it does bear traps. Hope that fix is coming.
---
I start by checking nearby gens then my totems after about 1 hook
---
IT'S XBOX GOD DAMNIT GET IT RIGHT I SWEAR TO GOD
---
How do you level quickly?
---
Yeah no one can seem to figure it out
---
Perhaps
---
tbh I've been meaning to post it for a long time but I feel like I need to give a full explanation of pretty much all the characters, or at least some of the more controversial picks (primarily Legion and Wraith who I rate considerably higher than most)
---
I will admit that I play a lot of very strange Killers and henceforth have a lot of biases towards them. That being said none of my characters in the top tiers are up to much dispute excluding Myers and Ghostface who I do really think are sleepers. It's mostly the bottom tiers where I get a lot of controversy.
---
When you try your best but you don‚Äôt succeed
---
Locker vs billy is so bad because he can just instantly stop
---
so gays deserve to die then since america are cry babies?
---
It's not really that impressive. Killer can't see you when you run into him like that. It's crock of shit really.
---
For me it is:
---
As killer, don't facecamp or use noed (The noed is more of a tip since you will not get much better using it and it will become a crutch)
---
As survivor, Always try to be doing something like a gen, totems or healing teamates.
---
In general tho, if someone in the other side isn't toxic to you don't be toxic to them.
---
Didn't say that. Lmao
---
I was worried where you were going to put bill, but I approve
---
please bro I need my solidarity up bro
---
Yep
---
No, the bug just shows you as a lower rank in game compared to what you actually are.
---
I love how lithe is on the crotch. Lmao
---
Not at my rank he's not
---
Verybrarely = only 1/3 games.
---
No, she'd only been hooked once
---
Ok.
---
Time travel!
---
Exactly. For some reason they make the pig worse every update even though no one has ever complained about her. For some reason they think she is better than the nurse I guess. Although I disagree heavily with the old Legion. I think old Legion was the worst thing ever added to the game and they need a complete power overhaul. Complete redesign. It will never be balanced or fun to play as or against. Right now all you have to do is follow a survivor. Back then all you had to do is tunnel a survivor. I'm fine with them vaulting pallets and stuff but mending is the least fun thing in the game. Especially with all of the exploits that have been involved with Legion players since the character was introduced. No amount of buff or Nerf will satisfy everyone. Their whole thing is that there's four of them... Yet their power has nothing to do with that. Legion was just made to sell cosmetics
---
Honestly though I wouldn't be surprised if they end up nerfing Leatherface
---
New killer confirmed: Phantom Virus
---
I agree that they need to give survivors more BP, but saying all killers do is "kill" is like saying all survivors have to do is escape. Killers also have the 4 different emblems. They injure, they sacrifice, they (attempt) to deny gens, and they have to pursue survivors.
---
Gotta do whatever it takes to beat the other side in any way possible.
---
&gt;!Except Baby Dweets and baby Pigs those deserve to be cherished!&lt;
---
Yes that's true, she had only been hooked once tho, and it was so late in the game it just didnt seem necessary. I guess I would feel more understanding if she was on death hook...but you do make a good point haha thank you
---
Was just looking for a good Ghostface cosplay, thank you for this blessing spooky father.
---
Excellent
---
It‚Äôs not a bug, whenever you get close to a new rank it will show you that rank. It doesn‚Äôt show anyone else that rank but you.
---
There's all kinds of survivors out there, some help and some see you as a stepping stone. That's just how it is.
---
I've had people sell me out to the killer, but I've also had entire teams sacrifice themselves to save me during the end game. It's random.
---
Face looks spot on. I normally just downvote arts and craft bullshit but this is pretty cool. Good job.
---
I FEEL ATTACKED...I CAN‚ÄôT LOOP WORTH SHIT. LMAO. ON BEHALF OF THOSE LIKE ME, I‚ÄôM SORRY.
---
IMO, with no add-ons, he's bottom 6. He's better than Wraith, Pig, Legion, Doc and Clown, and about on par with Leatherface and Plague. With add-ons, he definitely rises, but I still think he's in the bottom half. Definitely worse than Nurse (old add-ons, new ones might shake it up), Spirit, Huntress, Billy, and Hag. I'd say still worse than Meyers and Freddie, but also now worse than Clown because Ether and Pinkie Finger boost him a lot. 
---
He's a lot stronger, as you can get a 3 or 4 gen setup with Iri Stone and stitched bag and basically create a death zone for any survivor that runs in, but he still doesn't have great map presence, and relies on survivors making mistakes and running into traps. High level survivors will basically just run in, take an M1 without looping any structures, then run out of his 3 gen to heal. Trapper either has to pursue and give up his 3 gen, or let them get away.
---
I see your using sketchers
---
I don't like shackles cause you lose the camera flick effect on survivors that fucks them up in chases. And I hate the 15 second cooldown on mint rag, fucks up my playstyle too much.
---
I can‚Äôt think of anyone who unironically thinks Prayer Beads is actually balanced.
---
Hau
---
Nted grounds
---
Trapper- can potentially stop safe pallet loops and infinites and traps can help down people.
---
Wraith- Terror radius is hidden for stealth and can sneak up with a small speed buff, and a good M1 killer. Needs small buffs.
---
Hillbilly- third best killer, has strong instadown and mobility that grants map pressure.
---
Nurse- The strongest killer, even with recent nerf. Can ignore all survivor defenses and extremely mobile.
---
Myers- Has strong pressure with vault speeds and lasting exposure effect, can stalk to find survivors easily
---
Hag- strong mobility if traps are set correctly, can stop pallet loops and infinites possibly.
---
Doctor- Extremely strong potential to find survivors and if used correctly can stop some vaults skillfully.
---
Huntress- Very strong killer that has distance and can shut down loops and infinites. Distance damage is very powerful.
---
Bubba- M1 killer but has a chainsaw that can down survivors easily if used right. Deserves a buff soon, as power can give drawback, but drawback is pretty short as chainsaw is used only for guaranteed downs.
---
Freddy- Very strong map pressure that allows him to easily get to places via gens, and snares and fake pallets gives great chase potential. Lullaby is also a huge counter to Borrowed time.
---
Pig- Needs to be buffed back, can sneak on survivors with dash attack that cam be landed easily, and reverse bear traps gives some map pressure mid-game.
---
Clown- Worse version of Freddy, but can still make chases easier on infinites or pallets, general M1 killer.
---
Spirit- 2nd strongest killer, strong power that helps in mobility and chases, mindgame potential and can easily find survivors with right hearing.
---
Legion- SLIGHT increased speed and vault speeds, can vault pallets which USED to be helpful in chases. Killer instinct gives some detection. However, missing attacks, hitting a survivor twice in power, or just running out of power will not only make you wait for the power to return after a ridiculous cooldown, you get punished with a 4 second stun, which is everything a survivor can do. Deep wounds is useless too.
---
Plague- Strong map pressure, and if survivors cleanse, gains a very powerful barf attack. The sick survivors also easily gives away location too if killer is nearby. 
---
Ghostface- Has stealth that allows sneaking up on survivors and stalking that gives exposed. Power is very useful in both chase and non chase scenarios.
---
Demogorgon- Very strong map pressure and mobility, can sneak up on survivors. Lunge can be unpredictable and give great hits like Hillbilly.
---
Legion before nerf was fine, just needed terror radius change to deep wound and broken addons fixed. :(
---
Aye looks like something I‚Äôd wear if i were to rob a bank
---
Right. I'm usually the person who is distracting the killer while everyone else grinds on gens. I get that aspect, and I have no problem with it. This person could have been hooked again and been on struggle. They got both of us killed, and I may not have mentioned it in the post, but I got downed pretty quick and then plague went back to where said teammate was just standing by the exit and downed her as well. It was a pointless death, and if she hadn't done that I more than likely would have made it out. So from the standpoint of taking one for the team, you'd think she would have kept running so I could open the gate lol
---
One has a counter, the other doesn't.
---
I agree they're not comparable in the slightest.
---
No sweetie, that‚Äôs just the demogorgons ability ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
Depends on the SWF. If it's like world class, Marth's Depip squad tier of SWF, you're right. Only Nurse can beat that. But 99.99% of groups aren't even close to that good. Any of the killers he listed can beat 95% of red rank SWF groups, with a top tier Huntress and Spirit able to beat probably 99%.
---
All the comments I've read here have made some solid suggestions, but they're forgetting to mention one perk that is very solid for solo queue. It's Kindred. Now all your teammates know where everyone is and have a basic idea where the killer is.
---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted unless this post is just a reference to the other one that's currently got 4.2k upvotes.
---
Very true...very frustrating at times tho haha
---
*yells at the bank teller with angry elephant noisies*
---
Steve looks about 7 in that picture
---
Huh, so the killer closing a key-opened hatch also triggers endgame? Sounds that that shouldn't be the intended design since the hatch closes itself after a bit when opened with a key right?
---
and unlike hooks which were removed because it gave away what killer you were facing, the hatch wouldnt give away anything because, well, hopefully by the time it spawns you know who you're facing
---
I think it depends on the rank. Lower rank players love to play killer because they are seen as the "cooler" characters to play, so the queues take a long time. But when you get to Red Rank as killer, you get instant queues because Red Rank survivors only play SWF.
---
It‚Äôs ok you should be fine it‚Äôs just a bug happens to me a lot
---
You realize how many people are actually good at this game/use broken perks and items. It's a lot more common than 1% of the time
---
As a Killer I really prefer to have my ass beaten by some high rank survivor that not playing the game at all
---
No, not the bong that makes you feel good.
---
Probably my opinion on the outfit. People don't properly use the vote system
---
Well thats just it, if youre playing with a competent team than as soon as they know youre being chased they should heal up or finish a genny or do something productive for the team. Getting downed as distraction and just seeing all your team mates just crouching or doing nothing is just a disheartening feeling.
---
Then I understand why it annoyed although if you both ran away from the gen I do not see much harm in it
---
‚ÄúYou will be happy to note you are part of a robbery we are after the banks money your money is insured by the federal government please think of your loved ones and your health and safety is guaranteed‚Äù - chicken man at first world bank
---
It's intended.
---
It's just that when it happens, its *supposed* to power the gates so the other poor schmucks can try to leave, but... ah...
---
...pretty good job so far.
---
Looks great. Keep up the good work!
---
My friend over there thinks you‚Äôre cute.
---
the funny thing is that among all the killers that are considered "low tier", clown is by far the one I see the most. no idea why. I just run into several clowns for every bubba/doctor/wraith I see
---
Now we need a special stage that's like this for the next anniversary, with a 100% chance to go there if you burn a specific event-themed offering.
---
Dead hard OP PLEASE NERF!
---
Cicadas all day. Honestly I hate shackles tho, losing the camera flick during chases isn't worth the trade-off IMO. I want them to react to tripping my traps.
---
freddy wont leave him alone
---
I mean, I did once find a cloaked wraith standing in front of his ruin totem for a long time during the game so we couldn't cleanse it. I guess that's ruin camping.  
---
It was in such a position that you couldn't go around.
---
I main Jake, yes thank you put your panties back on
---
I‚Äôll take either of the body pillows instead uwu
---
why would you even downvote that
---
Let him sleep pedo!
---
holy shit i wish that camera flick wasn't a thing. i have no idea who at BHVR thought that was a good and meaningful mechanic but it's just so... frustrating and out of place tbh. I understand at this point its kinda just part of the killer and I'm sure some hag players appreciate it, like you, but man nothing feels worse than dying because your camera had a seizure. absolutely does not feel like a deserved death lol
---
Iconic ü§£
---
Both lol
---
Also, you have to play ghostface
---
That's amazing. I'd probably buy one if you made copies!
---
*clutch perks* They spelt "perks that aren't worthless" wrong.
---
Ok, so once I buy a perk from the shrine, where does it go? and how can I use it?
---
whats that
---
Yeah I can agree to that
---
yes, when you want to play to win and it happens, the desire to play DBD gives away
---
Thats a lie, survivors do not, killers do.
---
He has the hardest trophy imo. Shocking 500 survivors is a ton, compared to someone like wraith or Freddy who I got within a couple games
---
Idk why but I hate Dwight
---
It‚Äôs called a window tech and it‚Äôs not even a noob3 juke loll, people have been doing this for years. It hardly works anymore once you get to red ranks, people realize what you‚Äôre doing before you even try it.
---
Good to see my boy represented so favorably.
---
Well isn't it "Upvote" what you like or agree with and "Downvote" what you dislike and disagree with?  
---
Just because people downvoted you doesn't mean "PeOpLe DoN't PrOpErLy UsE tHe VoTe SyStEm"
---
once you buy a perk from a shrine, it just acts like you got the teachable from the Bloodweb. This means that it will now show up in everyone‚Äôs bloodwebs as if it was a shared perk
---

Laughs in huntress achievement
---
Decisive Strike is kind of the Survivor version of No One Escapes Death; both are perks that, just by existing in the game, cause the player and their opponents to think of situations differently and causes a certain playstyle, that isn't very fun, to crop up more often. Both feel kinda lame to fall victim to, as they actively punish you doing your job. And to avoid them, you need to do something fairly boring or wasteful of time.
---
It's kinda funny when you think of them that way. People dislike both of those perks for their own reasons, but the reason generally stems from this core fact.
---
As for all the "toxic" stuff, it's... Well, it's just a buzzword. It doesn't really mean anything, so I wouldn't really get into any serious discussions involving it. Ever.

The perks I use are BBQ, Ruin, Thanatophobia, and Dying Light. If it looks like a tough SWF with lots of items I use the Black Incense add on and a fast infection add on. If they don‚Äôt cleanse you can always see where they are and their gen speed is slower and continues to be slow with each hook. If they do cleanse then you have super puke for days. Works pretty well for me.

No body is crying. I'm  telling you, that you are a shitty toxic player and not a damn person wants to play with people  like you. It is a fucking game that people  like you make suck. So go to fortnight. If you go out of your way to make the game less fun for others you are a trash person. No tears just straight  hard cold facts.

HAHAHAHAAHHAHA CAT FUNNY HAHAHAHAHAHA

I called it the noob3 window juke cause that‚Äôs what me and my friend that I play with call it. I don‚Äôt care what it‚Äôs actually called and idc how often it works. It still works sometimes and it‚Äôs fun to do.

Skill checks are client side. Nothing to do with host‚Äôs connection. But the skill checks are garbage on their own, separate from your own connection as well.
---
That chase music is an absolute banger and part of why I love the big shrieking bugger
---
The game is a farming simulator, bad players get to high ranks because they team with the killer and farm and what causes that is that the bloodpoint system is tied with rank and that you need to get a certain amount of points to rank up. The solution is to make matches timed so people can‚Äôt farm for a long time. Other issues are lag, loading times, and queue times.

Yeah it's the website I use, but honestly the fame bias on this tier list is strong. Probably the most telling evidence is that Nurse dropped to third place after her announced addon rework because of people freaking out about "Nurse dead."
---
huntress automatic S tier
---
Oh my. Dude. I‚Äôm not allowed to play with my friends? Really? Please tell me you‚Äôre one of the little shits that think it‚Äôs cheating. You‚Äôre acting like the game is a matter of life and death. Let me offer you some options. Go get a job. Get a girlfriend/boyfriend, and take a long drag of a little strain I call  chill the FUCK out. 
---
You also didn‚Äôt address a single point I made, you just said I should stop playing the game. Lol. As if I‚Äôm gonna stop playing a game I have at least 100 dollars in
---
What is this supposed to be based on?
---
His optimism was based on the fact he had ruin. Now it is gone, along with the other.
---
I like never see Adams, Imo it‚Äôs probably because his cosmetics aren‚Äôt the best.
---
&gt; hopefully
---
Big brain
---
He‚Äôs a rare breed haha I actually got all of his suit coat cosmetics
---
His hitboxes are exactly the same as every other Killer they just look extended because of his small model.
---
And he's at least top 4 due to the fact that Spirit, Nurse, and Billy still exist. ~~And no Nurse's "nerf" isn't going to make her fall that far tbh. At worst she'll be below Spirit but still probably above Billy and definitely still above Freddy due to her ability to completely ignore game mechanics.~~
---
I don't take insults from anyone. I blocked him its fine
---
My editing skills are subpar but I've been having fun making memes
---
Undetectable should flat out not work on Kindred.  
---
A survivor took a perk specifically to alert survivors if they're bring camped. Therefore it should always work. Stop giving killers incentive to camp now that they won't fear Kindred.
---
 .
---
haha is that about the dwight in The Office? i always figured thats where dwights name came from
---
what if you are one of the madlads that want to use it for aura reading?
---
It's actually fucking ridiculous I have about 50 level 3 perks and have gone through about 250 Bloodwebs just to get Ruin 3. I'm so fucking mad but at least I can finally play one of my favourite Killers again.
---
If i'm going up against a spirit and I don't have spine chill and iron will, I just die a bit inside.
---
i find that using Bind perk and using other ppl as shields is a good way to avoid getting downed. OR DOWNING THEM HAHAHA
---
no ive seen that arm before and i hated it then i will not stand for it now
---
Just stop looking directly at the arrow. Estimate the speed and press a little while earlier (input delay) than when you think it should be on the great area
---
only cuz they are rare
---
much appreciated
---
It's in your own post. "NOBODY [fucking] CARES".
---
You make a good point too. You bought the game and you can decide how you play it(As long as it‚Äôs not fucking face camping) that‚Äôs just how I see it
---
Shouldn't mori be the magazine and pistol be Nurse's or Spirit's power?
---
I got called out for it back in 2017
---
It'll just cleansed in the first 30 seconds anyway. But seriously, Ruin is fine at the first level since Greats still give 0% progression. But I get like having those purple perks.
---
Concerning the Bloodweb, I wish they just rework the economy in general or give more Bloodpoints. I'm kind of turned off by getting new teachables because very rarely does a character have 3 solid teachables so end up with just a bunch of weak perks clogging the web.
---
Not to mention characters like Ash and Quentin( now Demo) has pretty much useless perks across the board. This grind needs to be toned down. Hopefully the Bloodpoints from the Rift alleviate it.
---
Fair enough..hahaha
---
Lol. Sounds like a person with no friends to farm with.
---
The video isn't worth watching in my opinion. I didn't need to hear any of what he said. Queue times are long, yes. That's all I could agree with him on.
---
it's close to 30 in either low or high ranks in some regions around some hours
---
really depends on where, when and on what rank you are
---
it works really well with tall killer

ahh shit, here we go again...

---
Probably never gonna happen but hey, we got Stranger Things. Let me know if you have any criticisms!
---
I never kill Shirtless Davids unless they do something stupid.
---
Not because I‚Äôm sympathetic, but because they simply outlast my patience in a chase.
---
He‚Äôs probably saying this because killers often have to spend add-ons constantly to be competitive at high ranks, so it evens out, but in my experience that‚Äôs just not the case. I‚Äôve had many a cane where I‚Äôm tunneled into the ground and have 8K or less BPs, while that literally never happens as killer. Killer is just more profitable atm, and I agree with you that survivors need a pts boost.
---
As a Hag main, I disagree, but since it‚Äôs about 50/50 with Demogorgon nowadays, I also firmly agree.

I remember six years ago, betting my friend money I could beat him in every level, consecutively, because he kept talking shit.
---
Going 20-0 against him was so satisfying.
---
It's always a Jake.
---
do you have a friend or two? you can load into the KYF game to practice
---
first on the killer standing still without them looking up, to get the angle right
---
then on pallets and windows
---
then move on to flashlight saves when they are picking someone up (ask them to look up as quickly as they can)
---
and then flashlight saves in difficult situations (near but not quite next to walls, when the killer is looking in their general direction)
---
after that, go into public matches. it won't work at first, cuz you practiced in safe environment, but you'll get it eventually
---
you can also always watch a tutorial to somewhat learn the timing and go straight into the public matches
---
or what if he is constantly having to run away from Freddy while dealing with another killer. I mean how scary would it be for him that he is being stalked by Myers in Haddonfield and meanwhile, he is still having to face Freddy through micro sleeps.
---
hes not, im not sure why were getting so many posts implying nobody plays him
---
i see him all the time, my friends see him all the time. maybe hes more rare at lower ranks? this sub does seem to have a decent amount of newer players
---
He becomes a little less scary when you realise he's not that much of a threat compared to most other killers.  
---
There's no helping the fact that he looks like a discount Chatterer, though. He's a spooky fucker.
---
Don't hex skill checks count as good skill checks though, even point-wise?
---
You must always prepare for time stopping magic.
---
Red rank-pip-up survivor system is still unbalanced as shit. I play red ranks every season and often trial (well, not actually trial itself, but rng and killer) just don't give you opportunity to do all actions to get a pip or even not to lose a pip even when you escaped. So every season there is a circle journey from 1st rank to 4th and back to 1st. Old system was lame too, because red ranks was too easy but that  "new" system still unbalanced. You often can play a perfect game, escape and lose a pip. 
---
Even more frustrating is that killer rank-pip system on red ranks is enjoyably balanced and also you gain more bp, playing as killer. So basically, red rank game more friendly for killer in that case.
---
 I just hope that in a grim darkness of the far future BHVR will rework survivors rank system for red ranks and make it less chaotic in gaining/loosing pips.
---
The theme of ‚Äúescaping‚Äù and the references to Vigo in the halloween skin descriptions for killers is super interesting. I‚Äôd like to know more about that.
---
The only perk that I absolutely hate in this game is NOED. I play solo a lot, and there is no way to know if everyone else got totems. It is as cheap as they come. None of those survivor perks listed are OP.
---
Then godspeed
---
Agreed.
---
Happy microphone day
---
What movie is this meme from?
---
All I ever see is circle jerk hate on spirit players
---
I AM SORRY. I LEGIT HAD A MATCH TODAY WHERE I SAVED A DWIGHT, THAT LATER TURNED INTO A PIECE OF TOXIC POOPOO. I DIED FOR HIM, AND THEN FELT SO EMBARRASS AT WHAT HE SAID TO THE KILLER - WHO WAS FRIENDLY AND NICE.
---
Genuinley have no clue but just search up the meme and you will most likley find it.
---
I'm honestly not sure, because I've never not completed the daily in one game, but I think you literally just have to hit Survivors.
---
That's the points you get for winning a chase, not how many chases you've won.
---
These devs what? They never said they‚Äôd be added right away
---
The idea is that he gets one swf party, And they go to rescue which allows him to get more. Others have a meme style of play where the came to camp. Basement bubba is a scary thing. Me any my brother live in fear of being "basement hooked" because he can make it back to the stares fast enough to prevent most unhook attempts. Good Luck if it's an experienced one, That person is going to die alone, Or with whoever was stupid enough to test his intelligence by "luring him away" because he's luring you into the basement.
---
Shapeshifter should be able to be in Multiple perk slots lmao
---
Thanks for informing me. Still got to see the clip
---
What's the issue aside from bad capitalization?
---
In the middle should be "getting moried by hag"
---
That's also one of the reasons I only play survivor when with friends, we can actually do something about those things. I always feel bad for survivors queuing with randoms since there is no form of communication, which is definitely the survivors best weapon imo
---
HAD THIS SAME SENTIMENT UNTIL TONIGHT. LOADED INTO A MATCH (MT. ORMOND), AND I WENT TO THE NEAREST GEN (THE ONE ATOP THE HILL) - FROM THERE I WATCHED A (POS) DWIGHT PLAYER KNOCK A PALLET DOWN AND VAULT IT TO GET THE KILLERS ATTENTION.  HE BROUGHT THE KILLER TOWARDS US AND THEN TRIED TO TELL HIM WHERE WE WERE - LEADING HIM TO US EVERY TIME. THANKFULLY, I WENT AFTER HIM AND BEGAN TO POINT AT HIM TO THE GHOST FACE (AND HE KILLED HIM - THEN LET US FARM). SO, THERE'S ONE GHOST FACE OUT THERE WHO IS MY ETERNAL HERO.
---
I'll be here all night
---
It looks unprofessional
---
Edit: there's also places where exposed is red and some where it is yellow.
---
Do you have a link to read these changes? Can't seem to find anything
---
Awesome, do a trapper one next!
---
Ah! A Hooker!
---
I love it! Good job :)
---
I never respected pallets.
---
The thing about Legion is he is so badly designed. If you do get hit you not only get thrown out of frenzy but you also get the full cooldown on your power.
---
Combine that with his laughable vaulting speed and you see why he is the worst killer in DBD.0
---
&gt;  Hope that fix is coming.
---
Implying BHVR ever fixes trapper bugs
---
the reason bp is less for survivor is to incentivize people to play killer and as u have stated addons are consumed every game while with survivor u can run rainbow map with purple addons a 19k bp item 100s of games so long as u escape which saves u loads of bp
---
Of course :)
---
r/unexpecteddunkey
---
Everybody gangsta till Ghost Face takes up Hag's trap with a bone
---
Looks great!
---
I don't know how I have one, I just sorta do
---
Yes and no.  
---
Trill doesn't give the killer a notification if you touch a normal totem, however it does still slow the progression of cleansing it.  
---
The easiest way to counter Thrill is to cleanse all the bones that aren't lit, then go for the lit ones as they'll be faster to break without the unlit ones proping up the Trill slowdown.  
---
But also don't touch my Thrill of the Hunt, or unlit totems, I use Thrill for extra BP.
---
Oh boy it's early Christmas spirit! Oh wait no, it's just spirit!
---
You know she has really "powerful" rare add-ons that take away the very thing that made her special and not gliding and flying garbage.
---
Same here, When I play killer I play really fair and clean giving a lot of chances to the survivors but I get a lot of ez baby killer type of messages. But I play the way I like to and im Okay with that, there will Be survivors that thank you for playing like that even if they didnt escape.
---
Idk about Console per say, but one of the best killers mains around is TrueTalent. Look up his Youtube or Twitch
---
Oh yeah with that logic suvivors would be nerfed to the fog and back on assumption of "tocix"....
---
Watch any killer streamer. 2/3 times they get hit by DS are when they are not tunneling.
---
It's not about the perk itself, but how people use it. And sometimes a bit of unpredictability as counting 60 seconds isn't easy
---
It's very annoying when someone runs into you with it, gets into the locker, deliverances off the hook next to you with it or hits you with it in the end-game where tunneling isn't a thing and letting him crawl for 60 second will ensure he gets to the gate
---
It's also annoying when you randomly stumble upon someone, strike them down and "oh yea, they got unhooked 55 seconds ago, shouldn't have tunneled"
---
Brilliant as usual. 
---
These unique chase themes would make this game so much more fun. Put it on a whole new level.
---
I also main nea and I have never been the type to tbag or flashlight a killer because I think that‚Äôs trash ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è I just want to enjoy the game
---
I didnt know the killer can close the hatch!
---
also Nancy
---
The buff to ole Bing Bong‚Äôs cloaking is pretty OP if you ask me...
---
Oh wait you don't wanna leave Meta crutches at home and take spine chill once? Better complain on reeeeeddit!
---
Those aren't real bots though, you can tell they're just following a predetermined set of instructions (go to these co-ordinates, do this thing etc). Bots in a game like dbd would be incredibly hard to do.
---
=D
---
Because thats not stupid and childish AND dickish?
---
Well from all us P3 Quentin mains, we‚Äôre happy to have you in the fog!
---
We definitely need it, especially when you need to report someone.
---
Honestly,  Christopher lloyd from the end of who framed roger rabbit would be scary af.
---
You make me *dead hard* girl
---
Oh I love them. Corner traps and camera flick is strong but if you know exactly where to trap Shackles are great.
---
As an addendum to this, I‚Äôd like to see everyone‚Äôs character, cosmetics and all, when you hover over their name in the after-game lobby.
---
Wtf!? My eyes! I innocent, bespectacled baby Dweet eyes!
---
A meeting shall now come to order!
---
You can get extra stacks for wglf or just general boldness points for escaping a chase
---
Duolingo bird would be better
---
He died alone and slowly.  No one even tried, myself included
---
Idk you seen that bat
---
1500
---
I used to watch his videos until he camped someone until struggle and tunneled a recently unhooked survivor(moderately safe save, just outside the killer's terror radius), he ignored the savior and just hunted the poor player. Such an a$$hol3ry .
---
I can only imagine what that flashlight will be used for...
---
No
---
This one was a hybrid.  He protected the chest right until we came down, then he attacked.  Hooked and camped the poor girl.  RIP Nea
---
what are the 4 perks?
---
I‚Äôm more of a killer main, the two for killer right now is Spirit Fury and Unnerving Presence
---
It should, especially since servers disabled the use of MLGA and the like. If I as a killer can see one name, and choose to mori them every game, there is nothing that can be done about it. You can report it for griefing, but the odds of anything coming from that is really fucking slim.
---
Give me the choice to mark killers I don't like, or let me see them in the lobby, it would only be fair. If it feels unfair, then no one should see the opposing team at all.
---
See the fact that you intentionally go out of your way to be an arsehole to others while scraping for any scrap of advantage you can get, proves that you're an immature piece of shit.  
---
"go get a boyfriend/girlfriend" "go get a job"  
---
These also are the types of things people without those things often say, or if they do have a significant other and a job they are unfulfilling and broken in some way.  
---
It's also hilarious that you say being toxic is normal to any game with competitiveness to it, and yet I find the opposite.  
---
I put over 10,000 hours into StarCraft back in the day, played the pro-am tournament scene here in Australia, there was no toxicity, only companionship and healthy competition.  
---
Few years back I also played in UGC for TF2, and surprise surprise I found the same level of respect there that I saw playing StarCraft.  
---
Magic The Gathering is a hugely competitive game, yet there's almost no mention anywhere of toxicity.  
---
Over the years it's been proven that competitiveness doesn't breed toxicity, it's only immature shitheads like yourself that does that, and you only feel safe doing so because you're hiding behind the internet.
---
It may seem obvious, but take advantage of stealth. I see too many just running willy nilly across the map while shroud active, and I happily give them the stare down to break them out.
---
Lmao the rest of his right hand(claw?) is drawn on the table
---
Because playing the "actual" game is fun??
---
um I have question
---
They morid you on the hatch lol! Hope you never forget the exposed gay Myers, I don't!!!
---
I honestly find him very boring in comparison to Michael
---
It depends on ur type of play. Fury is good for rushing pallets. Unnerving presents will help if u wanna have large terror radius.
---
"hate racism" lol
---
spirit fury definitely.  unnerving is kind of underwhelming.
---
he isn't overly strong and can be rly hard countered by some maps but he is very fun to play
---
Send a support ticket instead of asking us freak
---
never run spirit fury without enduring though
---
That's not true, the sub and fredditors want more for so long, but lines said "No"... :(
---
I swear to god, I had two nancy‚Äôs in a game, one farmed and one dced, the new toxicity
---
Just got it and it didn‚Äôt show up, do I need to be a certain level first?
---
Wasn't it getting a rework? Sorry I'm on console.
---
I‚Äôd like to add Otzdarva to this list. He doesn‚Äôt whine like True does, and he explains everything he‚Äôs doing. Trappers trained by Otz are a terrifying thing indeed.
---
I have never been hit by DS when actually tunneling, either the surv runs into my face on purpose or I chase, down and hook another survivor before finding the first.
---
And you have every right to be. Dude was probably like, "What the everliving FUCK?" XD
---
So where around the world there are confused Boomer worker, that don't understand why gen-z does that..
---
I usually play Michael, but recently I've been getting more and more dc's when people see me:(
---
once u buy it off shrine it unlocks the ability to get it in the bloodweb of all killers
---
Cool
---
?
---
When does it show up? It‚Äôs not in the bloodweb right now
---
All dbd players are on PC. As far as console goes, there's not any survivor or killer that's recognized or popular.
---
its luck based could take 1 bloodweb or 50
---
Hillbilly intensifies
---
So it just shows up whenever? Great....
---
thanks for letting me know, I tried to do that before with a normal totem and I was wondering why it never alerted them. I also wonder why I got downvoted for asking a question
---
Yes, very good. You glitch around, your movement looks like teleporting and you can walk through the killer's legs for no real reason. You totally juked him. You can even see the visual desync if you pause the video.

If all it did was run in a straight line, it'd still be more useful than nothing.

WAIT BHVR MADE THIS GAME. I always tell my uncultured friends about the greatness that is Doritos crash course.

What did he say?

Bing Bong‚Äôs brother

There is something strange about shape mains.. 
---
Sometimes they're extremely assholes, sometimes extremely nice

Some people are elitist arseholes reddit, and if you ask basic knowledge questions they downvote.

lemme hit that bong

God dammit, Now killers are gonna use this as an excuse to use it.

I don‚Äôt like using tombstone unless I‚Äôm feeling extremely toxic and I hate tunneling I‚Äôm devotion and have been tunneled enough I know what it‚Äôs like

UEEHEHEH, UEEHEH, UEHEHEH, UAAHAAHAAHAHAHAAA, *laughs descend into absolute madness with demonic noises
---
Idk why people with flashlights that 360 killers always gets moried, they‚Äôre outplaying the killers tbh
---
As a Steve main, I am offended
---
Reminds me of adventure time
---
Absolutely love wood burnings, keep at it man. Curious to see what's next!

Wait that makes no sense, isn‚Äôt that new undetectable status supposed to make it so he can‚Äôt be detected by aura stuff anymore??

So, we are no longer the hookers
---
"Bamboozle" perk in Women brief üòâ
---
If you don't think there's anything wrong with using the best stuff, then I guess you just answered your survivors using their crutch perks is fine too. Congrats, you played yourself.
---
I've had this happen before and the guy said "I don't take freebies" in the end game chat...
---
They meant an extra 500 cuz dulls give you 1000.
---
Boohuuuu ace is for fun and flsir and not a Meta crutch whore.... Buhhuhhh....
---
"This is going down in history"
---
I love Otz but does it have to be followed by True salt lol?  They're both great for different reasons.  Otz is just a joy to watch and makes really interesting 1000 IQ plays while explaining everything step by step.
---
True is insanely prolific almost 10 new vids daily to his YouTube.  Still does a solid job breaking down mindgames and strats while he does them and plays every killer and lots of survivor too which he helps teach running various tiles.
---
If it's in the gameblame the devs, not the player, that a healthy mindset, just sayin, but hey keep on jerking each other of I guess.
---
It's great when they do this while playing Myers. They just sit there and tbag while you casually rank up your Evil Within levels. So satisfying to 1-tap toxic survivors
---
Heard about doing totems?
---
Dead hard for distance is a crutch because it allows survivor to make mistakes and get away with it.
---
DS is a 60 seconds invulnerability (paired with Unbreakable for better result), especially when survivor just goes for unhook ignoring killer. There's no way to counterplay it.
---
Adrenaline is just free instaheal and good luck with closing the distance I got (free 30 metres distance for nothing).
---
Many killers' perks have counterplay and drawbacks. None of this survivors' perks are even close to that definition because the way of "counterplaying" them just benefits survivor in another way - DS give you 60 seconds while you can crawl everywhere you want without bothering you get hooked. Adrenaline has 0 drawbacks. Unbreakable isn't as bad by itself, but paired with DS becomes a free escape ticket (not to mention you can 99.99% and teammate will instatap you to revive you). Dead hard allows you to make mistakes in loops and get that little boost whenever you need it to ensure your safety or dodge hits/traps/anything. 
---
Now about noed - it's a hex perk and we all know what happens to hexes, not to mention that is an endgame hex which makes it even worse
---
 *you are nitpicking and biased*
---
Cheeky breeky!
---
Cosmetics are toxic to some people. I don‚Äôt understand how lmao
---
That's just blendette

I‚Äôm seeing a lot of Wraiths lately so this is appropriate

I would say not exactly, keep in mind that it depends on which add ons you buy will end up spending different amounts

And...bet you‚Äôve face camped and made one survivors match miserable.

Yeah he‚Äôs is not one of the best killers in the game.
---
Wait
---
You need to get away from that crazy Maniac of a survivor I heard that they have unreal technical capabilities with machines you need to escape before he gets to you and go through it
---
The new dbd texture overhaul lookin' wack
---
Wow this looks so good!
---
You can buy those on console. Can you not on pc?
---
I believe that they are packs of skins for surv and killer
---
That's cool
---
OH LORD IT'S THE HASH SLINGING SLASHER !
---
You could buy them on PC and ps4. But they are not on PC anymore. You can't see em in the shop
---
I love this series)
---
The effect is rather negligible at level 1. Usable yes, but any Survivor past Rank 10 will be able to work through it.
---
"Free mistake ticket" god forbid a survivor play a perfect game right? You need to realize that one mistake can literally break the game for survivors,  the killer can make so many mistake throughout the game and still come out with a 4K. These perks are not "crutch" perks, theyre perks that actually help the survivor, we have like 6 of them and we need them to compete with the likes of ruin, nurses calling, bbq, and noed.
---
I realized this cosmetic reaaaally brings out the worst in some folks..I really love scoops!steve and Im sad I feel like I can't use it because of others. :c
---
The survivors that do it get downvoted though so it's still heavily one sided.
---
Probably I camped someone the first time I played as a killer. Then I realized it is completely wrong because I acted like an a$$hol3. But this streamer, he's playing as a killer for a veeeery long time(he even reached the red rank), but he still did it, and proud about it.
---
Can I recommend gzmo12 on twitch? Great dude! I mean just an amazingly awesome human being! 
---
Ok yea it's me lol. Shameless plug but hey I couldnt help it lol
---
happy cake day for both of you
---
The funniest thing you can do is purposely act dumb and run into objects, and make them think you are dumb and then they will act even more self confident and you can capitalize on this with ez chainsaws and I have many times exploited this but it‚Äôs hard to nowadays with my p3 cosmetics. It‚Äôs hard to take them off. It makes bubba look so damn good.
---
*Nea and the pussy cats*
---
In some cases it can seriously fuck you up. F.e if in situation I explained above.
---
And it seems you agree with everything else
---
Does it go "WAH!"?
---
We shall now be known as "The Honkers"
---
each time I play steve I have to tbag I think you are right...
---
Yup. Everything else is kinda annoying. And yes, DS CAN BE literally cancer but not all the time. (In my opinion)
---
I regretted that I took you seriously there. Well, you can keep on worshiping him and deny he did some a$$h0l3ry. Not sure if you got trolled by survivors or just copy-pasting other ppl's comments here just to cover for this streamer.
---
Rank reset
---
Then why killers don't have perks that compensate their mistakes in chases?
---
You miss a hit as killer -&gt; +30 seconds or more to chase, wow. You must play perfectly as killer in order to end chases quick and win games, while survivors have countless perks and chances to make mistakes and don't get punished for that.
---
I tried playing nurse the other day, I hated it, it‚Äôs not fun, just stuns 24/7 and just pure agony. *I‚Äôm just gonna return back to enjoying myself with Freddy, demogorgon and wraith :( *
---
I mean id be bored shitless rush gens and leave. Its boring to have a farming killer
---
All 3 dc‚Äòd after getting downed btw..
---
Those look really good, I have them on my Bubba, later I'll have to see if people still treat me like a dumbass with those on (they still did while I was wearing a Claudette mask).
---
I don‚Äôt cover for streamers, either do I for myself. If I get annoyed and games over but some survivors are being cunts I will fuck them over so hard, especially when I‚Äôm playing weaker killers. Yet if someone does same to me I won‚Äôt complain.  Everyone‚Äôs been a cunt, it‚Äôs not like he runs strong builds and camps every game, very fucking rare
---
I've used Unbreakable, Tenacity, and Flip Flop. I've ran Spine Chill, Resilience, Iron Will.
---
Spine in fact doesn't counter Myers tier 1, counters Ghostface, and Wraith. Though with a watchful eye you can handle them just fine without it. Here's a trick: I don't need it to counter them either and you're misconstruing my point.
---
To counter Prayer Beads, you are telling me to run Spine Chill. That is its only counter excluding maybe Premonition which has its cooldown. That is its only counter.
---
You're also using ad hominem, which doesn't help your point.
---
I would definitely be terrified if this face was following

The killers cream their pants when they see Scoops Ahoy Steve
---
What do you mean? His cute giggle cannot be scary! Everyone loves Doc's giggles
---
oh.. okay.
---
btw, i guess switch because of the lag &amp; bug, not because the way he record it :)
---
i just thought that this kind of connection/performance issue and ridiculous bug is on the console version especially switch, because switch have a hug latency issue in most of their online games.
---
It's more of a fuck-you-killer-for-1-minute perk tbh.
---
Every Survivor: Is that Distressing?
---
Herman Carter: *heavy wheeze*
---
Yee he he he HAHAHHA
---
Posted twice dude
---
Yeah accident
---
Its ol
---
Didn't mean to
---
I'll ask him if he'll let me share it
---
Eh you can work around it tbh. Just dont immediately go for the survivor that got unhooked. I do this whenever I'm killer and I rarely get DS'ed unless I explicitly know I will and just do it because I'm not struggling against the survivors
---
Yes, call me entitled when you have no arguments left, wow, typical survivor player, I'm not surprised.
---
"The killer has to do nothing to activate it" so does survivors have to do nothing to activate perks like adrenaline or DS. Pressing a button for avoiding hit doesn't count aswell, because you don't have to do anything to press that button. 
---
Noed is used most of the time because dumbasses refuse to cleanse totems and prefer to cry that "entitled" killer mains use clutch perks. 
---
"Turn 1 kill game into 3 kill game". Key can turn 4 k game in 0k game. Unbreakable can make won 4k game with all survivors downed into 0 kill game, same for adrenaline. Survivors have same gamechanging perks, that, however, still can be useful when the killer is good or bad, while noed works only against weak players. 
---
Go away, you disgust me.
---
They‚Äôre just deranking smh

That's where you're wrong. You are not supposed to downvote comments that you dislike/or disagree with. If you read the reddit FAQ when you first signed up they tell you this:
---
Do NOT Downvote an otherwise acceptable post because you don't personally like it. Think before you downvote and take a moment to ensure you're downvoting someone because they are not contributing to the community dialogue or discussion. If you simply take a moment to stop, think and examine your reasons for downvoting, rather than doing so out of an emotional reaction, you will ensure that your downvotes are given for good reasons.
---
So many players don't even try, like ever. It's one of those things that seems harder than it is, except for the easy counters ofc.
---
Tbh Nurse didn't really get nerfed, just reworked a bit so she's more interesting.
---
  
---
Also I love how noed looks super confused at the nurse getting hit by the nerf (‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)
---
How dare you counter me! FUCKIN CASUAL!
---
It‚Äôs the internet. It was bound to happen.
---
she went from SSS to S
---
Unfortunately not.

**Great resources for learning huntress and seeing great shots:** Umbra, Ralph, QueenKuro, CoconutsRTS

Of those, the ones I watch with regularity would be Umbra, Zubat, and OhTofu
---
U don't remember maps glowing blue
---
whoever doesn't want to spirit to get a nerf is a boosted.
---
We shoulda dropped a third.
---
As a weeb please stop speaking in our native tongue. It is sacred and should not be used for petty manners like this
---
Obviously the killer wasn't following the killer guidebook duh
---
Rule 1. Survivors rock
---
Rule 2. No hitting survivors
---
Rule 3. Hexes are illegal
---
Disclaimer: **this is a joke, just play the game, be nice and have fun**
---
Whatever is going on, good luck. See you in the fog out there.
---
the killer pushed me into the locker as i did head on resulting in me being inside the locker xD while also being untouchable :D XD I got out at the end and the killer ended up letting me out :P
---
The one survivor even got DS...just a little teamwork and that would‚Äòve been a win for all survivors maybe.
---
I see Ash and Laurie all the time. Almost never see anybody play Ace or Adam.
---
Meh, I'm still going to guess 90% of Reddit don't up and downvote based on these rules.
---
Making reddit the entire circus.
---
You know that you commented that to me right?
---
 I honestly don't care about the points one bit but you are absolutely right these people are incredibly childish that's why I just blocked every single 1 of them because it's easier than trying to argue with them so I am by far not the childish 1 here.
---
what did you use to make it? looks incredible!
---
Jeff main here. Nobody likes playing him because he tall af, and you can hear him across the map.
---
What!! They made this?!!!? I loved playing this game lol!
---
Yeah this is pretty much the standard now. Kinda depends on your rank too.
---
Let me tell you that I appreciate it, and will always call out GG even if I had a shitty game.
---
Because it is called being polite and I'm just trying to be the change I want to see.
---
On Dedicated Servers it feels like I can more often, but those 4 o'clock ones are just IMPOSSIBLE as far as I'm concerned.
---
In the end it will be an easy win for the ultimate killer: old age
---
&gt;hard to get/find.
---
Lmao, so if an item is a bit rarer it can be extremely op with no drawbacks. Okay, I see your point and I see that it is useless to explain you obvious things.
---
I find adorable that you completely ignore my arguments and just stick to words. 
---
You are blocked, I don't want to waste my time on filth like you anymore
---
Holy shit you fucking killed him dude!
---
Once I will have photos I will upload some here ^^
---
Thank you ^^
---
If you have an opinion on what the purpose of up voting and down voting is your completely wrong the actual reddit rules the FAQ that you should read when the 1st sign up tells you the way it's supposed to be used.
---
 The fact of the matter is these people insulted him so if course he got mad.  If anything that person that called him a bitch should get banned for violating rule 1 "Be civil"
---
I'm pretty sure any survivor can have that animation in the main menu.
---
It fits Quentin extremely well though.
---
She kinda looks like a young meg.
---
Lol did u have it in game as well I did played like 5 games kept happening had to switch off her skin
---
I don't think it's that and more or less the fact that the dude hasn't slept for YEARS on purpose to avoid being killed in his dreams.  At this point it's a habitual, natural fear of falling asleep over any real, physical danger.
---
TBF if I was attempted murdered every time I went to bed I'd also would not want to sleep EVEN IF it became safe to do so.
---
Preach! Say something nice or just call out GG and leave the end game lobby. It's not hard and would improve the sense of community immensely
---
Yeah , he did go full nurse omega with mori after but he got Lobby dodged
---
Just Google search "Dead by Daylight 3.3.0 Update". You should find some information
---
R/dbdlfg
---
Spine Chill unironically is useful against her as it can tell you when she is heading in your direction. Granted that's not a GREAT counter but it gives you time to try and walk away.  Plus I just like Spine Chill so maybe I'm a weirdo.
---
Lol. Gotta love the plague skin
---
You clearly didn't read the part about verbal bitching from the survivors
---
Unless you insta down the survivor with DS, it's not 60 seconds. So if a survivor gets unhooked, they run away and 30 seconds later they get downed, the DS timer is only 30 seconds.
---
So yes, it's very counter-able
---
Yeah, wholesome in the most toxic way.
---
Monto had it happen where the DC'ed body of a Survivor despawned the Hatch because the body was in the exact position of the Hatch lol
---
Billy, Huntress, Legion, basically any killer.  It gives you a really good indication when a Killer is nearby, looking AT you or patrolling NEAR you given it blinking means that they are turning IN YOUR DIRECTION but not heading that way, steady is them coming at you and small blinks + steady is them turning to come to you a certain direction.
---
Cute. At the end of the day, killer's hate DC and survivors hate NOED. But DC only helps one person and they only get a chance to use it ever other game, same for NOED, this argument can go on for hours but oh please don't block me, your attitude was so pleasant to deal with...
---
Hello man, thanks for recognition!
---
I'll make sure to catch you streaming one day
---
Stop chasing them then
---
And survivors really hate "NOED" we can keep going on with this or we can let bygones be bygones
---
But ace in the hole and the luck perk is a good synergy with plunderers and slippery meat. So they are pretty good.
---

---
I play with him a lot but I only have 3 perks slots available... because I have to take Iron Will :(
---
the middle should've been, *"DIO pain"*
---
So they prefer blendettes?
---
If anything it should just deactivate once a killer hooks another survivor
---
\[These are my current specs\]([https://imgur.com/ZtdSgdx](https://imgur.com/ZtdSgdx))
---
3 perks vs 16 lol
---
Oh god. You really have no idea. Super cute.
---
-
---
PS: DC is not a survivor perk, it stands for ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù DS is the perk you are referring to which stands for ‚ÄúDecisive Strike‚Äù. 
---
As for NOED I honestly have not heard someone calling it OP or crutch for awhile. Just do the god damn totems, and you‚Äôll negate the killer from a perk slot which loses the game, and if you decide not to do it, well you might as well just get punished for it.
---
Prestige 2 almost 3, I truly think the dev's forgot he exists.
---
Okay Jesus
---
Approved
---
Yeah maybe. Then again the timer start instantly on the unhook so if you spend 45 seconds downing and hooking another survivor then the guy only has 15 seconds of DS left so in your situation the likelihood of DS triggering is tiny.
---
Yeah, it fits really well
---
Oh, they bandage-fixed the bug by letting you enter the locker when being inside the locker.
---
If it's that simple, why aren't there two hatches open outside the gates in case someone gets the "no escape zone" bug?
---
Can imagine that!
---
The other costumes are cool too, I definitely chuckled at the DC survivor (even if low effort)
---
It's incredible how many survivors run into you on maps like the hospital or the game.
---
I keep running into steves that farm me off hooks.  Thank god for the killers who realize what's happening and tunnel steve.   
---
PSA Please MORI steve  fuck that cancer
---
if you are patrolling around someone hook for the first time, you are asking for a black pip/depip to be fair.
---
The actual pip system is live for long enough now. Everyone know you can't win as killer if you one hook people.
---
I like the dc haha
---
That wasn't being discussed.  The topic wasn't countering them it was comparing the effects of the two.  Don't just mindlessly be the just do totems guy.  That comment should be saved when the topic of conversation moves to counters not effects.  Just feels forced in.
---
Yes, and how does this counter my point that it's dumb to say "run Spine Chill to counter prayer beads"? I don't disagree it's a useful perk, but this doesn't exactly change the inherent flaws that Prayer Beads has.
---
I'm not a fan of the meta builds myself and I run what I please. I prefer gimmicky builds for what I do. Maybe even the looting build to stockpile on more items and addons. I get your points though.
---
This is going to be interesting! So I guess BHVR is going for an MMO type match, which the dedicated servers are perfect for.
---
I do wonder how they plan to balance 200 versus 1 Fred boy
---
Anyone that posts clips of shit like this on Reddit deserves to rot on hook. Hope I was on your team.
---
uwu thank you
---
This is just mental gymnastics man.  You're just passing the buck and washing your hands of any responsibility as killer and putting it all on the survivor for not doing something that only serves a purpose in countering this one single perk.  It's not a misconception it's a pretty well accepted easy to follow logic that NOED rewards unoptimal play.  Your goal as killer should always be to enter games with the intention of ending them with one or more gens up.  This is how killers beat good survivor groups.  NOED is used as a safety blanket to remove the necessity of playing optimally and pressuring the gens.  It's typically relied on by its users to get their kills.  
---
I'm not asking for a nerf or telling you not to run it.  If you need it in your loadout to kill survivors run it.  I'm just asking that we don't kid ourselves about the perk while running it.  It's easily the biggest crutch perk in the game post decisive and MoM rework.
---
Writing sarcasticly is wrong?
---
Mental gymnastics my friend.  NOED rewards bad play absolutely does work.  Please don't be that guy.  You're in such a vast minority on this.  Run the crutch if you need it but don't convince yourself it's anything other than what it is.  A substitute for learning to play optimal killer games.
---
Monto better watch out, there‚Äôs a new hatch king in town
---
Really? Damn you'd think theyd do a test to see if it actually can function.
---
I don't know who this man is but I appreciate what he just did.
---
agreed lol
---
Can we just nerf prayer beads and call it a day? I dont even use that addon.
---
Exactly what they all said.  Remove Self Care.  It's horrible man and kills more survivors than Nurse Blinks and Prayer Beads put together.  It's practically a 5th perk for the killer.
---
Much apperication for this talented dude. His Hillbilly music makes me want to die. In a good way.
---
11/10 would recommend
---
Freddy's presence terrifies all the survivors, in the lore, a main character states that after encountering Freddy he is too afraid to sleep
---
Now you take that x100,  that's probably what Quentin feels

---
sick! i love itüíñ
---
meanwhile people dc after they hear billy's chainsaw, but reddit says he's fine
---
Unrelenting doesn't completely compensates my missed hits mid chase like dead hard does. If it gave 0 cd on missed hit once per chase then i would agree with you, but no. 30% cd doesn't change anything
---
not saying this is exactly that but i know at one point there was a balanced landing glitch where you would stay top speed for the rest of the match or atleast until you got hit i think. either way FIX YO SHIT BHVR!!! lol
---
need more nuking
---
Billy can seem daunting but I promise he's a ton of fun once you start! He has plenty of add-ons that are actually *really* good for newer players trying to learn that make just about every aspect of the chainsaw better. Honestly you can just throw on whispers and bbq and you're good to go for fun matches where you'll never have trouble finding survivors either.
---
Ah so loser that was likely bullied far too much, got it.
---
There are no broken survivor perks. Mettle was, but it's been nerfed into oblivion. Adrenaline is fine, dead hard is fine, balanced is fine on maps that aren't broken (which is the maps problem, not the perk). Insta-meds were bullshit, but they're gone now.
---
3 times outta 4, it works every time!
---
Lol, maybe in the usa. But here in europe meg, nea and claudette are the only survivors that exist apparently, i sometimes see a dweet and nancy. I have YET TO SEE a scoops ahoy steve. No fair. I wanna play on us servers :(
---
An achievement, what are you going on about.
---
Does it actually award more blood points, like BBQ, or does it just make getting blood points faster?
---
The guy who uploads KYF videos with his brother, gf, and random friend. You can tell because who in their right mind would make a "power only" video and win? Prime example of bullshit would be him laying down a trap then moment later a "wild" adam walks into it. An this was on the street in the middle of that stage where Halloween music plays. A couple other eye rolling moments happen in his other "just only" videos. An in some videos if you look closely enough he is actually communicating with survivors. After watching his videos for X amount of hours the bullshit oozes in like cancer. At least Tru3 actual plays the game for all the shit talking he gets.
---
For DC'ing. What benefit is there to derank apart from longer killer wait times?
---
Considering that most killers actually play survivor as opposed to survivor mains knowing little about the other side which is why they are so toxic 95% of the time, meh, they do see it.
---
Balanced Landing/Dead Hard, adrenaline, DS, unbreakable.
---
I love mad grit it is so much fun to see
---
You can either go bbq ruin thanatophobia and dying light or bbq ruin enduring spirit fury.
---
&gt; does 4 totems
---
&gt; get downed by noed
---
Haha i can totaly see that happening now for people
---
10% more BP for Hunting category for each totem left standing.  
---
or at least that's what the perk says.
---
*confused Freddy noises*
---
Looks awesome, great job.
---
Jesus Christ, I'm just saying that there are survivor perks that reward you for doing nothing, like NOED. I never said NOED wasn't crutch, I never said NOED required any skill, but if you can't see that survivors do have an equivalent of NOED then you're the sorta guy that gets mad at make your choice or lightborn

You individual rank doesn‚Äôt matter it‚Äôs how you play.
---
Keeping that in mind people assuming that people around the same rank as them will play with the same ability they have.
---
Knowing that - getting paired with anyone lower ranked than you might make someone mad.
---
Example: me rank 10 gets paired with three rank 17‚Äôs. I know they won‚Äôt commit to gens or save me off the hook. Knowing that I have to make sure to not put myself in places where I would be hooked easily and look as much as possible. Making sure I‚Äôm doing as much saving too since others won‚Äôt do it.

Survivors have no equivalent to NOED, not anymore.  They used to in old Decisive and MoM but both were rebalanced and justifiably so because they were cheese.
---
Also big swing and a miss there buddy.  I don't use flashlights period as survivor.  Not only that buy I use Lightborn against multiple flashlight lobbies as killer and I've been known to recommend its use on this very sub.  I also run Make Your Choice on my Hag.  Noone else because I don't find it to be a particularly strong perk but it's pretty nice on her.  I'm not an entitled survivor main dude no matter how much you want me to be.  And I don't think killer has any other crutch perks worth mentioning aside from NOED.  I play both sides equally and just call it like I see it.  And NOED is the single biggest crutch perk in the game.  It's in a class all own.
---
They're part of the same issue.
---
If I get matched with Rank 2s despite being Rank 9 or 8, does Rank really mean anything?
---
Ahoy matey! Did ye fancy a Mori? Arrr fat shame! Yer gonna git it!
---
But really though, don't Mori Steve he's way to precious and has the single best scream when getting hooked.

I think the term is "keeping a close eye on you" Bubba

Yeah but it doesn‚Äôt say ‚Äúblood points are awarded at the end of the trial‚Äù like BBQ or WGLF on survivor side does so I always wondered if it just granted bonus blood points for each action taken, and can‚Äôt push it past the max of 8000 like BBQ can.

I'm just confused because people go "Oh look at the ranks in my game the matchmaking is so bad!" But then they will go oh it doesn't matter what rank you're. it's sort of weird
---
Thanks for letting me know, and congrats on not getting fleeced of your money!
---
It's just confusing because like I've said before people say they don't matter but also will be like "WHY IS THERE A RANK 13 IN MY GAME IM A RED RANK"
---
Man, I've been playing alot of Hag and Myers lately for their perks, but usually play Wraith, Doctor or Legion. I have heard from people that I was able to jumpscare them as Myers, alot of fun &gt;:)
---
Rank did ‚Äúmatter‚Äù because everyone died. It‚Äôs all hypothetical speaking so you are never going to get someone saying both sides but the level of gameplay is much different based on how the killer is matched against that group.
---
Like a red/purple ranked killer is going to ‚Äúmatter‚Äù when going against people who are a lower rank.
---
It‚Äôs more so that if the survivor lobby is matched well the killer should match well against them. When that isn‚Äôt the case people feel it‚Äôs ‚Äúunfair‚Äù to match against a killer MUCH better than they are as they never ‚Äúhad a chance‚Äù
---
On dedicated servers ?
---
I was having issues queuing up while streaming so I just took a match to have gameplay for the stream.
---
ok
---
SNAP SNAP SNAPPPPP
---
Hag's traps are the worst. Fucking jumpscares get me everytime. Worst thing, when I Man Up and go trigger a trap, there's nothing there. They always surprise me
---
daily rituals
---
Hahaha you don't enjoy chasing people into chomps with trap daddy?
---
Wait i play meg but im not new or toxic
---
Your telling me, there is a reason I play had a lot because it is fun to have the occasional time you see a survivor trigger their first trap of the game. When I play survivor against Hag I literally have to sit on the edge of my chair so that I don't shove my knee caps into my desk.
---
I am fully with you on the "No" for Trapper, can't stand playing at him.
---
I like how trapper is just 'No' and don't feel bad for playing nurse well! a good nurse makes the game 100% more stressful and fun (in my opinion lol)
---
demogorgons the only killer that doesn't give me a headache whenever I see they've brought a mori
---
+1
---
It's always fun to have that holy shit moment when you turn around while on a generator and see Myers staring at you behind a bush, especially now with leg Myers.
---
Untitled Wraith Game
---
Indeed it is
---
I would love it if we had either a strict matchmaking that's actually based on how well you do, even if it took 15 minutes to find a match
---
I would love it if we had somewhat balanced games, even if it took 10 minutes to find a match
---
I wouldn't like it if we had a quick unbalanced mess, even if it took 5 seconds,
---
What do we currently have? 
---
an unbalanced mess that takes 5-20 minutes. 
---
The matchmaking starts at your exact rank and then advances one rank further each 2 minutes. It would be good if the ranks meant anything.
---
The biggest problem with the ranks is that the matchmaking tries to give us a balanced experience, when the devs themselves told us before that "ranks aren't there to have a set in stone skill level, they are here to keep new players away from those who play for 6 hours a day", and yet NEW PLAYERS IGNORE THE MATCHMAKING RULES AND GET MATCHED WITH WHOEVER'S AVAILABLE
---
sorry for going all caps.
---
Idk why but i kinda like playing trapper :c
---
Keys are still broken, ds is OP adrenaline is strong, most exhaustion perks are strong, and some others I cant remember
---
How cant you have the filthy hag. Its so awesome to play hag
---
That's a part of her kit, that's why you put traps in corners. It makes her gameplay more skillful.
---
I‚Äôm rank 10 but I have no idea how. I suck. But I trust my meg build:
---
Sprint Burst: I like noping the fuck out of places, and it works well to put distance w/Myers or similar during a chase if you crouch, loop while walking
---
Adrenaline: duh, it has its uses even if outside a chase so...duh
---
Spine Chill: I am a paranoid bitch that became way too dependent on this perk, I feel exposed (pun intended) without it
---
Alert: I am not one to loop well (or at all) but I usually go back to a gen a good survivor left behind during a chase and finish it. I‚Äôm the objective points vulture :)

Ok then, why hasn't anyone suggested we nerf NOED then, because all I hear is complaining and no one actually giving good ideas on how to change it.
---
I guess play play play maybe watch some guides ^^ Killing yourself on the first hook isn't nice even tho i can understand that MAYBE some people have to go away or something it can happen. You will learn with time ^^ Wish you good luck in your games!
---
Not at all. On certain maps it works really well if you know what youre doing.
---
I agree! I love playing against Nurses since I play her too. It's nice to actually be scared of the killer once in a while right? Much like how it's nice to actually play killer as the power role once in a while.
---
Honestly I haven't played a single game as Trapper :/
---
He just seems uninteresting to me I guess
---
I usually count to 15 whenever someone gets hooked so I can smack down the aggressive BTs. If someone with DS is hunting you down just slug them. Not only did they waste their time, but they're going to waste their teammates time too.
---
Great! Id give you tips to make it smoother, but then i remember wraith is not a smooth boi, so....great!
---
Spirit fury, unerving presence can be gotten from trapper.
---
Oh, I can do it too! Here I go: Potatoes
---
When Ruin popped up on the shrine for it didn't seem that important anymore sadly
---
We steal that TV Guide every week.
---
I did this today too! We were on the MacMillan Estate map that has that giant tree in the middle. You can walk up the roots on one side so a Nea and I stood up there together and I just shocked her over and over. It was a good time.
---
i would pay good money for shirtless myers. really just any cosmetic for him. im gettin bored of bloody myers
---
Get clown he is hella fun
---
Some of the add ons to make phasing silent are pesky I can't lie, but honestly spine chill and urban evasion kind of ruin her... Not everyone runs these I understand but as long as she can't see your scratches she has to fully predict where you will be... Which is hard sometimes its all mind games
---
Doc's giggle&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Clown's tuberculosis-ridden laughter
---
She was op when she came out, but people didn't know that she can simply hear you when you're injured at the time
---
I'd look for my longer reply to a similar question, but it was so long ago that it'd take me ages and I don't have the time needed for that
---
He tripped and fell :'(
---
DEMO HATCH
---
I mean, they always pop up right in front of you to ensure you can't see the survivor you're chasing, or in a tree/on a rooftop...
---
Then you just leave them be, what happened to the survivor who unhooked them?
---
Only takes 4 shocks though. He probably wanted to shock until he doesn't get poonts from it anymore
---
Missing the point
---
While u/Oicmorez is right, do not ask to turn off the servers.
---
Not only has nearly 100% of the playerbase been moaning about latancy/hitboxes, I feel like me and a select few actually know what it actually is. Although every single moan about hitboxes is incorrect as it simply it latancy, (see here: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share ) Asking them to turn off the servers is a severe fucking no. 
---
How else are they meant to test and fix them? They have a huge task on their hands, it's almost like re-writing most of the infrastructure is a hard job! As far as I am concerned, they have a forum section dedicated to technical issues as well as a general Bug Report forum as well, that's where this post should be, as helpful feedback, rather than telling them to turn off the servers. 
---
You all wanted this without knowing the implications of Pretty Good Job So Far^TM Ltd and how good they are at doing things. It's not just a simple copy and paste job.
---
Sorry bruh, I don't use Noed. Just pressure gens, why didn't I think of that.
---
why not freddy ?
---
I would DC too if I saw it was 2 killers vs. 3 survivors
---
Ah yes, nothing better than a doctor hallucination appearing in a tree. Seriously, they can be super helpful when you use the auras, but a lot of the time it either scares me for no reason or makes me laugh way too hard.
---
People don‚Äôt want viable killers at a high rank
---
She is good, definitely not op though
---
The only thing that I could consider changing is prayer beads a little bit....  but she is fine. So is the nurse, and even though she just got a nerf, I guarantee people will still complain in the future about nurse lol..  she can‚Äôt be looped like normal characters, same for spirit. So people don‚Äôt like that.  They don‚Äôt like to change their playstyles, they want a predictable loopable game.  
---
And god forbid someone suggest playing more immersed (like an actual survival horror scenario) because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs too boring, I want to be chased by the killer‚Äù...  ffs
---
Don't forget iron will. Its my staple perk and i love vs her because shes so easy to escape while injured.
---
Dwitght clearly was really uneasy by the fact that the gen cound explode at any second to the point where he had a heart attack
---
Allows survivors to traverse the Upside Down. Survivors are *undetectable* while traversing the Upside Down.
---
I love plague. Shes one of my gorls
---
Get freddy, hes heaps of fun to play!
---
I've gone against him once since the DLC release on xbox.
---
How are keys broken? Like maybe two people get out and that's annoying, but if you're at a point where 3 or 4 survivors can get out with a key, you've lost the game anyway.
---
It's a Bing / Bong for me
---
You're not wrong, very good perk
---
Now I want DBD masks in GTA for my Heists!!!
---
Even if some cosmetics can be considered toxic, scoops ahoy isnt it
---
I have only played against him maybe 5 times on PS4
---
If you stall the game long enough
---
I like the flower idea, but I think it needs a better incentive for people to want to use it, such as maybe invincibility from an attack for a certain amount of time. The positive has to outweigh the negative or people will just leave it alone. Or perhaps it can grant a large amount of blood points when used
---
Why not both?
---
*I will devour you, just like I devour the pigs*
---
I think the bubba you played was just having a laugh
---
If he literally stayed in the basement the entire match not even trying to actively get a survivor there lol
---
I would laugh my ass off, he was just chilling in his basement and you guys disturbed him like in the movie and nea payed the price lol
---
Or even better
---
Sneak up on one and bodyblock him to a gen. Once the endgame collapse is at 25% left you can let him run and barely make it.
---
Or you could bodyblock them to a gen and uncloak, and recloak all the time until 99%, while turning away from them. Once they start repairing the gen you can imediatly grab them of the gen after you've 99% cloaked
---
Also, you can just block an Exit game with your invisible fat body
---
Ah, it's so much fun deranking with wraith &lt;3
---
Disgusting, needs more cock.
---
Sigh **unzips**
---
Both are super cute :p
---
Demogorgons hate my one friend. She gets tunneled every game there is one
---
Hippity hoppity your brain is now my property
---
They didn‚Äôt find hatch i was on it the whole time until it opened
---
Certainly nicer than what I usually see in chat
---
I'm sorry, is this some sort of crutch perk joke I'm too Ace to understand?
---
pls be nice it‚Äôs his first time

this would not work again in a million years and you know it
---
**You heard the man.**
---
Wtf
---
Thanos mori pls
---
Terrifying but magnificent at the same time. Where can i order this Duck with the odly shaped head that is trying to kill me with his club?
---
survivors don't like killers to have fun
---
alright, thank yaw for the information
---
its the last person alive, how in gods name does that dc affect someone else other than him?
---
Honestly I think the pig is so much fun to play.
---
I'm just a hole to serve you Entity sir.
---
ONCE THE FUCKHEADS AT BHVR GET THEIR DEDICATED SERVERS UP AND GOING THEY WILL VE ENFORCING A TIME OUT BAN WHEN PEOPLE DC! UNTIL THEN WE ARE FUCKED!!!
---
Too bad i wanted to know what happened to the nea
---
Survivors should never get the same amount. Killer's job is far more complicated, then the survivors. He plays against 4 other people on a huge area. Most of the killers easy to spot from far away, you even hear the terror radius. As a killer you have to watch like a badass sentinel to hear and see small signs where are your prey.
---
Ur toxic and loop it your opinion is stupid
---
That‚Äòs trueüòÇ
---
Well, for his eyes he's using **wire speculums**, and I don't recommend trying that because you only have one set of eyes and the importance of being able to blink *cannot* be overstated.
---
In the mouth, a **wire cheek retractor**. Don't overdo it.
---
For the headgear I'd go with an **EEG/electrode cap**. Mostly harmless.
---
You can get most of this stuff through auctions (both online and in the meat). They're not terribly expensive.
---
If you can't find an electrode cap then you could just tear apart a cycling cap/skullcap and add some old ribbon cables. Instead of eye wire speculums *on your eyes* I'd probably go for empty spectacle frames, which you could attach them to (I know it makes no sense, but it can look pretty neat and would give the *suggestion* of something holding your eyes open). Failing that, safety glasses or any other eyewear that has "the look".
---
Good luck, don't forget to take a picture for u/HappyNorskChinchilla.
---
sigh here is an easier fix we get all traps at the start easy done boom he is fixed and he is medium-high tier killer now as for the addon remove backpack  addon and have more power changing addon(freddy style) like having diffrent kinda of traps other than bear traps rope traps that drag survior but dosent injure them a small hole he can dig if the surivor pass run through will give the hindred effect stuff like these
---
Lets be honest, Toxic or not, these killers will treat scoops steve badly either way
---
Well technically, she does have some form visual detection, grass movement. Yep that‚Äôs it. And that‚Äôs only some maps. You have to be lucky with what perks you bring even against a regular spirit.
---
LOL
---
Have you seen stranger things map indoors and I been there so much but still get lost
---
I hate nurse I suck ass at using her blinks then I get frustrated and tell my mom loudly to bring me a beer
---
To drown out the STOMP STOMP STOMP STOMP
---
Just BEPEPEPEPEPEPPEPEPEPEPEPENEPEPEPEPE
---
he still be the 4th in the in-game HUD.
---
I would‚Äôve loved the spencer mansion or the RPD police station from Resident evil but since they‚Äôre making their own 1v4 asymmetrical game I‚Äôll settle for the haunted mansion from scooby doo or even the opera house from phantom of the opera only because it would give off an eerie vibe hearing the piano playing
---
How do survivors feel about killers with paid skins? I've got a bad ass terrifying doctor skin, never been called out for it.
---
It's also the only killer skin I plan on buying, since you only have a first person view as killer
---
His laugh is music to my ears.
---
I'm not sure that's how it works, but to be fair I've never really paid attention.
---
When is the next Bloodhunt again?  I thought it started yesterday, but I'm thinking I've got my dates wrong.
---
Looping is fun unless it‚Äôs the demo gor gun
---
Yeah they want to travel in the sea of flavors
---
Of course. I'm not blaming you for using meta perks or any perks as long as you are enjoying your game.
---
Then again, both sides complain about the use of meta perks. In fact, you are as well. And often survivors run meta perks too because without them they will be playing against killers with meta perks.
---
It's a vicious cycle. In any case, have a nice day.
---
P.s. either you or someone seems to be downvoting me, which is their right, but it's a bit counterintuitive as I'm just trying to have a friendly discussion and downvoting is not "disagreeing".
---
For some reason Leatherface makes me panic more than any other killer when I'm getting chased. He just looks so intimidating.
---
RIP
---
Because the sounds were broken until 2 months ago, playing spirit was a bit painful.
---
*insert prettygoodjobsofar meme here*
---
It's not an answer, and no you cant. It doesn't work on someone who enjoys the joke or leaves it alone. You made a comment about disliking farming on a joke comment on a meme
---
Guy 1: *Makes joke*
---
Guy 2: *Comment removed for saying "kill yourself".*
---
That's the DBD community I know and love.
---
Same! He's the only killer that does that for me. Something about his appearance and the way he moves makes me panic when I'm getting chased.
---
At least they fix the 1 trapper bug that happens every single time a new update is released
---
If you have something right next to you, it won't let you drop.
---
I really like playing Plague but I can never pip with her for some reason. I've black pipped with 4 kills with plague. Shit's stupid.
---
The only thing is that it looks like the owners of MM doesn‚Äôt want behavior messing with the mask but the body looks sick af dude. Nice job
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was the other Nancy from the other video...
---
I wanted to main Clown (and still kinda do) because I love his appearance, but I just hate the way he plays. I always do really badly. Plus so often on indoor maps when I throw a tonic it will hit the roof. I just avoid him now :(
---
David king is an absolute madlad and a trooper
---
It‚Äôs a weird persons thing cause that might as well be alien CHEEKS
---
He's mid-tier at best, with or without add-ons.
---
Oooh That was lovely!
---
Can we just take a minute and realize that the Nancy was speed hacking
---
No one:
---
Nancy: I am speed
---
This Dude is playing DBD with a guitar that what i saw
---
First of all, how is this bitching?
---
Second, you know for damn sure survivors get significantly less BP than killers do. BBQ is actually a good perk without the 2xBP while WGLF is useless aside of the 2xBP which is harder to get fully stacked than BBQ.
---
Third, fuck off. You want to bitch about people bitching? How about doing that on a post that is actually someone bitching rather than one that is just a discussion. Everyone, and I mean literally everyone knows killers get more BP. The devs should balance it out and give survivors more BP.
---
 HOLY SHIT THEY DID THE 2 KILLER GLITCH
---
UwU onii-chan buy me a dbd dlc pwease
---
Scoopy Boi, Best Boi
---
Because its strong meta perks
---
100% agree. In actually shocked more people didnt agree tbh.
---
I used a base of paper mache and created textures using drywall puddy, sticks were drilled into the mask and cheesecloth was used for the eyes :D
---
Sounding like r/hearthstone over here
---
You took that hat PNG from ROBLOX, they did a sponsor with ST and they got the Scoops hat and Demiboy mask.
---
Mind you so do I
---
I always thought I was imagining it, but I have noticed when I‚Äôm pushing it, if a survivor is about to wiggle off me, I can‚Äôt drop them. I figured it was a network thing or something.
---
Legion is heavily disliked just because of how much of a pain in the ass he is to play against especially if you have a good build.
---
For those who've never visited that sub. So yourself a favour and keep your eyes clean by not visiting it.
---
I remember most survivors who do me dirty. Few months ago was playing Billy cause I'd finally gotten him to P3. Made the choice to play with only enduring since I had no points and wanted to use my full bloody boy.
---
Game goes really poorly and a feng with object of obsession and a flash light nonstop trolls, get told ez game baby killer.
---
Run into that feng again about a week later, sadly didn't go for revenge as Billy since my perk rolls had been bad...  but took my p3 Michael and brought all my strongest stuff. She didn't have a fun time
---
Point of the storu, generally more satisfying to remember a particular person and make them miserable later ;]
---
Do these messages come from people you‚Äôve killed?
---
If so, they are salty that Legion, who many consider the worst killer, got them. 
---
Do these messages come from people that escaped you?
---
They are being cocky bastards and gloating at you.
---
As a Legion main, ignore the messages, block and report, and Legion on.
---
Your whole argument is opinion based
---
Well... yeah?  So is everyone‚Äôs lol
---
Thanks for stating the obvious
---
Otzdarva, never trust this man if he says he‚Äôs purchasing bear traps IRL lol
---
Took me time to understand, great meme!
---
Ya it's almost always who I kill and I always report cause it just gets annoying sometimes I have also got threatened to get booted offline
---
Then what was the point in bringing up my comment as an opinion? Lol
---
Yeah I was smiling a little when I put the paper mache, thank you for the feedback!
---
Bruh
---
This is why it's important to play both sides
---
32 seconds of downtime for 1 person is equal to 16 seconds of downtime for two, so the other person's gen downtime is already counted. And typically, a the killer finding two people just isn't an issue unless it's the last two. But most importantly, a 32 second heal has a much better chance of being interrupted than a 16 second heal.
---
Yes, you lose the time spent finding someone else to heal....unless you just play normally wounded until you run across a survivor. That's kind of the issue with self-care, it encourages you to play safe and do what the killer wants you to (not gens). As opposed to running something like Bond and getting all the info you need to heal quickly, while also being a good perk besides that.
---
Imo, the only good use of self-care is if you are a truly fucking amazing survivor that takes like 2-3 mins to go down, because you can slowly finish the heal during the chase. And even then, if it takes that long to down you, the killer will likely ignore you, and if he doesn't you need something like Deliverance or DS to save your own ass instead.
---
Well, I just meant. In terms of play style, you stated that ‚Äúbeing chased is the best part of the game‚Äù as a matter of fact. So that‚Äôs why...
---
That is something MORE opinionated than saying spirit isn‚Äôt OP.  Because that actually has backing evidence.
---
Vs saying something is fun or unfun, which is very much an opinion
---
When he hits some one. All other survivors appear on his screen
---
He's just not fun to play against, constant mending.
---
Killer instinct: whenever he stabs somebody he has a pulsing marker that shows where you are if your in his terror radius is why legion is remotely playable
---
If they‚Äôve hit another person while in frenzy, it will ‚Äúshow‚Äù them where the players not affected by deep wounds are located at, so they can then give the status effect to everyone
---
When he hits someone with feral frenzy he gets killer instinct which shows where survivors are in his terror radius.
---
Just looked him up,  love when they describe their actions.  Thanks üòÄüëç
---
:3
---
This man speaks the truth
---
I would prefer wasting time on chases to wasting time on searching bushes...
---
I'm not into the show at all, but my wife is. Personally, I find them pretty talented. The amount of work that goes into the outfits is impressive and I suppose I respect the, I dunno, craftsmanship. The same way you might feel about a really dope cosplay.
---
Nice good job
---
Do you think god hides in heaven, because he too fears what he has created?
---
Nah they look cool

I mean if I see someone with that username I will happily grant their wish

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/djm7v6/free_bubba_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Replace self care with Resilience, as it increases your vault speed, gen speed, sabo speed, hook save speed, healing speer, and mending speed by 9%. Then get a different perk like Inner Strength or Bond to help you get healed if you need too.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people are being downvoted. 
---
Is it the Noob3 super fans? Someone explain this to me because I don‚Äôt see any of them saying anything that is wrong.
---
Unless he doesn‚Äôt have him.
---
Moons Haunted
---
Was talking about myself for that one.
---
I'd say it's not a buff, but another killer.
---
True
---
You're blaming the game for your actions instead of just admitting that you're a shithead. Way to go, my dude.
---
Omggg foreal!
---
-murders a sheep right in front of you-
---
I remember when they first came out nobody liked them. Forums flooded sir complaints saying "that's it!?" And nobody used them.
---
Now they're rare and unobtainable so people think they look good.
---
This is one instance i don't mind the teabag. The demi was being a dick too. Left the guy down to crawl out just to pick him up as he got close. Well deserved teabag imo
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
I actually had a swf team once with all names based around the theme of ‚Äúmori me daddy‚Äù. 
---
So when I brought an eboni and started to mori them I was shocked at the instant dcs lol
---
It's like an infested command center
---
Spooktober indeed!
---
This. You can get a LOT of points just by chasing/zapping
---
They haven't announced one
---
looking back in it... it really does
---
Why?
---
Cabbage hag is precious and I will fight you to death for her.
---
Eh people have different tastes after all
---
And I left a comment on a disagreement of a comment about disliking farming on a joke comment on a meme.
---
Mostly good but is it smiling? Why?
---
Thats fair enough
---
Where's the white eyes?
---
Saika best waifu
---
Hatch to the Upside Down.
---
Yes I had deliverance
---
I‚Äôve never heard that suggestion before, that sounds like an actually really easy solution to that problem
---
He can lunge into pallets and break them, pretty sure that's what they were talking about
---
thats what i did, needed to chase for 180 seconds
---
Now imagine a doctor with the terror radius of a Myers, yes it actually exists
---
Personally I like it tbh sure it slows game down but all the mend points make up for it
---
Youv just be missing.
---
You‚Äôve been missing lately. Have you been throwing up on survivors more or just hitting them once and then waiting?
---
This is awesome! Looking forward to seeing pics of the whole costume!
---
ok the add on is a bit game changing maybe thats like a rework state but honestly can you tell me getting al traps at the start is not a bad idea right? and its the simplest fix known bhvr can fuck the simplest thing but honestly leatherface and doc desrve the full work more than our boy he is pretty ok the way he is
---
Looks amazing!
---
God the Doctor is like old Legion to me, completely useless but piss annoying, every time I go up against him I'm constantly in a chase or snapping myself out of madness or screaming. We usually win but not before I have a break aneurysm from sheer unbridled frustration.
---
nice samination reference
---
Why the fuck would you want motion blur though it looks horrendous
---
Y'all a bunch of knee jerked
---
Nurse is still best killer b ugh a long shot, Spririt is Nurse Lite tha TV takes was less skill and is ike infinitely more boring to face since there been is 0 counterplay
---
Dont even hit me with that "JuSt RuN iRoN wIlL" a perk shouldn't be needed to beat a killer
---
Looks really great, albeit a little too happy for a DbD killer, but it‚Äôs still light years better than I could do!
---
People just dont like legion because they dont like having to use a core mechanic
---
No because
---
1. No friends
---
2. Too poor to buy cosmetics
---
God please no blendettes lol they are usually easy to chase yes but they are fucking hell to play against. I want to chase people not play hide and go seek
---
"I like the hookers!" a lonely Jason said.
---
After a solid test it turns out I'm just bad and miss a lot, which means I just need more practice as my favorite vom mom! Thanks to everyone who replied!\\
---
Ok unrelated but seeing as I cannot find a legion main anywhere else can you help me with my legion rework?
---
yeah, and nea too..
---
but lately i found a lot of toxic nancy too
---
I can just imagine a survivor jumping into thw hatch while its like that, then they pop back out at some other part of the map confused
---
Mary Shaw, Jeremy Melton (Valentine 2001), Naughty Bear.
---
Or visit it if you want to want her porn
---
Yeah, but how long has he been in the Enitity. It could be years :(
---
Idk man seems toxic to me
---
How to doctor: zap laugh hahahahahahahahshjxkfjdjfhdhdndjjdjfjfjdjc
---
F E E L S H O C K E D
---
I'm not like super good with builds really cause I haven't leveled him up alot cause im leveling up some other killers for the teachables sorry I'll try to find a video for a build for you
---
Currently I'm playing the Doctor back-to-back I thrive on the salt he generates in survivors.
---
\- BBQ&amp;C  
---
\- Ruin

Is the basic setup, with purple carters notes in restraint and calm you got a TR so big they can't hid in smaller maps, like Hawkins and The Game. Fun times will be had becasue the illusion doctors are shown to you at rank 2 madness and they can cure themselves of rank 2 madness.
---
I wouldn't say it's "the only remedy".
---
First, there's nothing wrong with being a white version of the Doctor. 
---
Further, you could bloody yourself up,  or shoot for a rotting pallor. 
---
If you had more time, or if you have the skill, you could even try for a "skinned" or vivisected effect.
---
Worst comes to the worst you could go full Darkman and cover yourself in dirty bandages, which would add more contrast against your skin and be easier to clean up at the end.
---
You don't have to be a 1:1 copy of the Doctor, you just need to be close enough to the target that people who know will know, and that anyone who doesn' t know will just think it's a cool costume.
---
Dude...you just made my metaphorical tier list exactly!
---
Imagine if this was demo‚Äôs close hatch animation
---
Silly gardener, it's mine now.
---
I think it's more to do with the fact that an invested player is more likely to spend money (ten dollars) on a cosmetic set, and an invested player is also more likely to be toxic. Pretty much just basic correlation.
---
No not a build a ability rework
---
That's his backstory

Blighted hatch skin confirmed?
---
Awesome keep up the work &lt;3 Hope to see more of your work :D
---
Oh
---
Sorry I misunderstood you
---
Do you wanna hear it?
---
Sure
---
Well, to be fair he is 'The Doctor'
---
It's alright, very fun to mess around in. I just wish the town people would play fetch with me when I bring them my ball.. Also it is a fairly short game.
---
lol, the bot was angry! Fixed :)
---
Ok first off the whole,‚Äùplay as joe with thsi cosmetic‚Äù is gone.
---
It's a bug that will be treated as an exploit, most probably. So OP is facing a ban, in theory
---
Its okay
---
Ok dude have a nice day :)
---
Rank is sort of meaningful in broad strokes. People who are legitimately rank 18 (I.e. not deranked or coming back after a break) will typically be less good at the game than someone at rank 1, for example. But there are a ton of exceptions that make rank less meaningful - derankers, people who have taken breaks, boosted SWF, smurf accounts, etc. Being high rank doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean you‚Äôre good, it just means you‚Äôve played enough. 
---
Also the people who say rank is meaningless are not usually the same people who complain about broken matchmaking.
---
Hallucinations are just a way for us to find you, and/or track you. They appear looking at you and give away your position. Much like the screaming.
---
dude and you clearly cant understand when a guy is making a joke ... jesus "delusional " mutch
---
I want to see a killer with the ability to disguise as other survivors maybe we could see the weird alien from the Thing movies
---
Its looks amazing, it kinda looks like it is smiling too which it really unsettling!
---
Doctor is for people who like to have fun at the expense of everyone elses misery. 
---
I'm coming up on red ranks with him, and I'm looking forward to it.
---
p.s - this is new to me, ive never written comics nor used digital artwork, so please bear with me as I improve :)
---
I hope I will be able to upload few of them soon :3
---
Console get hag and doc for free
---
More skillful gameplay deserves more points. Less skillful play deserves less points.
---
Point is, until the devs implement more skill objectives for survivors - no, they shouldn't get more points. Merely dropping a pallet without stunning a killer and getting points for it is ludicrous and doesn't promote skillful play in the least. The dev who thought of that shouldn't be trusted to make any decisions in the future.
---
Excuse me it‚Äôs illegal to put ghost face anywhere but the middle
---
Noted &amp; updated :3
---
The hallucinations start appearing after he zaps you. It's more annoying when fake pallets appear.
---
Maybe you shoulf stop playing stealthy, this game not for stealth play at all
---
What do you mean by poised? üòÖ and do you think the perks are ok or op?
---
Just make BHVR let u know if it‚Äôs spirit so u can equip spine chill
---
The colors and shape look good, almost perfect, but I don‚Äôt think Philip is supposed to smile? 
---
Imo Wraith is better cosplayed with facepaint!
---
Ah. Ok. That makes sense
---
As freddy I‚Äôve had this happen to a person who hit a dream snare. Crazy.
---
You are gonna have to get used to it. Ruin helps the killers slow down the game and is used almost universally.
---
This tier list is wrong in every bit expect that beatiful beast on top
---
Buy a lottery ticket
---
Dunno just felt like Casey would be best since i think the most common line "what's your favorite scary movie?" Just defines scream and she's the one to bear it first.  Plus her will to live After getting stabbed in throat and heart just makes her a tad badass. But thats just my opinion :3
---
Thank you for clarifying! I figured it was something like that, but wasn't sure since Youtubers seemed to ignore them when they played against him.
---
Ayyyy doc time
---
Freddy is so fun to play. One time on Badham some Bill was running to one of the houses so I pulled a sneaky and teleported up to the generator at the top of the stairs. That he just happened to be climbing.
---
Like the prestige exploit a few months ago, but different, thought it‚Äôs their bug this is essentially stealing, be careful using this bug.
---
Mine too
---
That's the Roblox Scoops hat lmao
---
LOSING A PIP WHEN THE KILLER DCS
---
Quentin mains rise up.
---
Absolutely love demolishing survivors with her. They dont like it when the KILLER is the one w the actual power.
---
I've seen this before.
---
They wouldn't help in chases. I was only referring to them as an early warning signal for when she is phasing towards you and doesn't know exactly where you are yet.
---
Love how she's hanging her head in shame.
---
Ty, means a lot ! No idea how the rights to Halloween have been working for Behaviour, but I would hope they would be able to do this- as the mask did at one point look like this in the series.
---
The whole point of this tier list, is to be incredibly absurd.
---
I LOVE THIS LOL IM DOING THIS TONIGHT
---
If it doesn‚Äôt help in chase then whats the point?
---
How much is it
---
Nothing. Its just an absurd tier list.
---
ok from what i can tell nancy's speed it a known glitch.  
---
but can you, op, take a moment and tell me how in the heavens you managed to cancel your m1 when the meg deadhard'd???
---
That is true. I was on the Macmillan Estate map and there were pretty good crow placement for my situation in particular so paying attention to the crows was very useful for me.
---
However I know this is very situational and cannot be relied on every game.
---
was it such a short m2 bait that the animation looked the same?
---
touch gachiHYPER
---
That‚Äôs the whole point.
---
The tier list was made to piss people off (while also trying to be funny)
---
"READY"
---
I mean, he isn‚Äôt bad.
---
He‚Äôs just low because he doesn‚Äôt say darn in game.
---
Slumber, all substance of this debate aside, you act like a child.
---
Little bit projecting there?
---
I agree, just a badly designed killer from the start to finish. Like so many killers, he badly needs a rework.
---
No just reading what you said, you are clearly over aggressive and uncaring of those around you. You show several signs of insecurity and an inability to accept others world views. You are a child.
---
Even deeper cosplay, because D/Cs are low effort.
---
Now *that's* a portal I'd want to enter
---
*laughs in autotune*
---
They downvote you because survivors are lazy fucks that want their counterplay to be easy.
---
I try to have fun with nurse, but every time i play i get insulted for sucking ass at ‚Äúthe most braindead killer‚Äù every single match by every other survivor, up to the point that it makes me doubt if there are nice survivors at all. I swear that when i get good at her ill shred every single one of them without mercy
---
Really? In my experience it's much faster to get through Ruin gens with multiple people. The speed boost at least offsets people missing skill checks a little bit more than flying solo does.
---
OMG, he looked at us after he woke up, he knows about us! O.o
---
There's blendette in it, no wonder we can't see anyone
---
&gt; Also, if you check posts that people made when she was released, they actually asked the devs for buffs. Like 115% speed movement and the ability to see auras when phasing. 
---
That's because release Spirit absolutely sucked. Her power made a phasing noise while in Terror Radius and was directional; Survivors knew exactly where she was when she was phasing while she had to guess. Urban and Iron Will crushed her.
---
Her power also took longer to recharge, so she spent a lot of time as an 110% Killer unless she was using good recharge add-ons.
---
AFTER TRYING FOR DAYS TO OPEN A GATE WITH STEVE, THE SERVER KICKS ME HALF A SECOND FROM OPENING IT
---
How is more revenue a burden? Revenue is literally why companies exist. I see the point with licensed cosmetics. I just thought that since they were finally able to get new cosmetics for licensed characters it would be possible. Not easy, but still a possibility.
---
The score I give you out of 10 really depends on how old you are..
---
Counterplay? NO. SPIRIT NEED NERF NOW! /s
---
true but stranger things is quite popular so im assuming 99% just bought it bc they're fans.. but you are right the "graffiti Nea" usually is the toxic one, so there your theory def. holds up
---
**I CAN NOT HEAR YOU, SIR.**
---
I‚Äôll agree with spirit I‚Äôve not spent any bp on her yet every daily ritual with her I get it in one game with 4K. Nurse on the other hand is very fun with the perk for removing terror radius you just appear next to people and scare them shitless. Seriously can‚Äôt believe they are gonna nerf her over plague and spirit.
---
Please tell you your gonna use shoe lifts to get the wraith height because this is fucking awesome !
---
Plus the smile on the face setting just adds to the creepy nature.
---
It looks exactly the same as the game holy moly.
---
People are just dumb and don't know how to play against him. Instantly mending, dropping pallets on frenzy (Even after theyve been hit which actually helps you.) etc
---
But the licensed killers dont need merch. All these movie franchises are a lot bigger than dead by daylight. They all have their own merch and products already.
---
Aye on first world bank if he gets on the table they all have lines for that map
---
They have a few shirts and stuff on the deadbydaylight store, from survivors.
---
Leaked perk?
---
considering high rank survivors go immediatly for the 3 gens and hardly any good killer would aim for the 3 gen crutch since it can be dangerous in all situation with all kilers even leatherface billy and myers and these three usally are the best with it and at best it would close 2 jungle gyms which is not that op and concertaring them all in one place can be pretty ineffective i belive the best way to use trapper is to chose a half of the map and concetrating your traps around it while trying to push survivors toward and honestly disarming trap is pretty fast so yeah it wont change that much maybe if you pick the addons tho the only issue with this if you got the add on that make you trap open up on there on it will make you an m1 killer that dosent have to waste time using his power after the first 1 minute and you will only have to focus on chase and patrols 
---
if u didnt like this how about this once every set amount of time 1 random traps well be transported to his inventory and yes they should remove the bags no more carrying limit if they can do this at least for now it will make me happy and get add on that increase the amount of traps in game but not a big amount
---
To be fair, the streamer Otzdarva basically mains trapper and he barley uses ruin and he consistently gets kills and good games with him, so I don‚Äôt really think it‚Äôs necessary.
---
I NEEEED A MEDIC BAG
---
Please no, Casper is already dead D:
---
Pretty darn good for the first time. Shape looks well done, the paint job could do some tweaking and he looks kinda weird without the glowy eyes. Bing Bong Boi just isn't the same without the glowy eyes :(
---
Looks dope anyway tho, I'd buy one if they were available
---
That's true so scratch that idea. I still dont understand how more revenue is a burden though.
---
I'd say it was probably something like this:
---
https://youtu.be/9tDcwQKkwe4
---
DS is a ‚Äúanti tunnel‚Äù perk remember. Shouldn‚Äôt be doing anything else
---
I don‚Äôt see the problem
---
More revenue isn't a burden, the reason their shop isn't some big thing is because it's too expensive. $35 for a basic tshirt with a design on it, $20 for 3 coasters. They clearly don't know hot to make products like these productively efficient therefore they aren't going to get many sales. Which doesn't lead to a worth while increase in revenue. It's extra labour and extra costs for iffy merch.
---
SCOOPS AHOY STEVE IS THE BEST CHARACTER IN THE GAME
---
Didnt realize they had that. Still, it's not much. I would like to see full set cosmetics being sold. There are a few of nea's and megs outfits I would love to have.
---
How do you not own hag
---
John cena looking fresh
---
I was thinking they could hire a team specifically for this.
---
Think you meant to but Jeff where Bill is
---
They should have an ultra rare addon that makes the portals spread some shit all over the place
---
Mr. Gorgon lookin thicc as a bricc
---
WHEN I WAS PLAYING ON THE PTB A FEW DAYS AGO MY TEAM AND I MADE A CONGA LINE AND THE KILLER RUINED IT
---
I've gotten out of the habit of bringing ruin as its just another thing to patrol that's inevitably gonna get destroyed and I just bring corrupt intervention or pop
---
If you use any other perk apart from the Hag ones, you'll never get it. (Take out enduring)
---
Imagine you wake up one day and everyone around you is speaking Spanish. No one acknowledges it or acts any different, but everyone, the people on the street, your colleagues at school and work, everyone is just casually speaking Spanish.
---
That's what it feels like on this subreddit when everyone argues over who's the best between Nurse and Spirit when Billy blows them both out of the water.
---
yeah, i feel worse though for the brand new killers that are rank 20, that are getting matchmade against rank 12-15 survivors which just reset so they are actually rank 7-10 and just destroy the true rank 20 killer.
---
Ppl do that all the time, but at least you did it.
---
Who wouldn‚Äôt want to walk around as Wraith or Huntress?
---
Yes we need this
---
Whispers bbq enduring spirit fury, or my favorite bbq whispers enduring infectious fright
---
Theres a lot of good builds so I am going to throw one out there that doesn't use ruin.
---
Bbq
---
Pgtw
---
Spirit fury
---
Enduring
---
Wouldn‚Äôt SWF nerf it hard though?
---
There are a lot of ugly sweater parties during the holidays and it could be worn all winter. It's rock fengs all season. It was just an idea. It could be tweaked and some, like the sweaters, just left out completely.
---
I agree with you, can't wait for vanilla mode. 
---
Have a nice day!
---
Lol different strokes for different folks I guess.
---
But then theres the people who want to be moried
---
Exactly. I want to be able to make kids scream just by going on a jog. Sure, i already do that because they just flat out hate me but i want it to be easier.
---
What did this comment contribute?  What was it's purpose?
---
But extreme rank reset once a month is fine right............
---
Lmao. The best response yet.
---
Still haven‚Äôt played as demo but I‚Äôll reread this later after I‚Äôve played as him to figure out what you mean.
---
If my buddy knows where the hatch is and it doesn't look like we'll get gens done, I'll yeet myself at the killer and suicide on hook to get him hatch. 
---
I'm ride or die in SWF.
---
Saika totsuka Beaty girl
---
\*notices your flashlight*
---
I have sometimes given a hatch to someone just for fun, particularly if i feel i was really "cruel" to them (eg: the other survivors kept putting them in crap situations, etc) and happy they didn't disconnect cause of it. If you're a good sport, i'll help you.  
---
Though I've had moments where i've dropped them at the hatch and was like "welp, i gave you two chances. \*knocks them down, closes hatch\* and you didn't take them."
---
You were out of sight by the time he got around the corner and he probably saw the Claudette
---
It depends to how many dlc s you buy
---
I just looked. There isnt many, and the ones they have are kinda lame. I'd like to see full outfits and really want megs trippy goodie from the charity case dlc.
---
I've had that happen. I give them 2 chances. Then I hook them if they don't take it.
---
Noice
---
what the fuck
---
Yeah I agree I was unimpressed by what they had. Hopefully they get more stuff, I ordered a spirit phone case last week.
---
This looks like the 2nd or 3rd phase of a increasingly verbose meme.
---
"All individuals of the highest stature under the name Claudette at all times:"
---
Why does nobody play him?
---
For real. Like what's the point? All it does is make it so actually bad players get bullied or don't play at all while the red ranks climb back to red.
---
As an ex-doctor main I vehemently disagree
---
Probably because it's unique to Quentin.
---
I play this game for not so long niw and still haven't figured out what these totems do can anybody explain?
---
I meant killer sided lmao i play both games a lot so thats why i made that mistake
---
Bottom left looks like Freddy from fnaf I cant be the only one to see that right ?
---
Nah personally I cant see how I cant like women and like men sorry
---
I feel like Bill belongs in the new or super toxic ranking. At least on PC Bill is either really good at the game or the character new people pick cause "Oh that's Bill from L4D"
---
Imagine being stabbed and hooked by that face üòÇ
---
They do so much for in game play. I'm surprised they havent put out more real life merch. I feel like it's a missed opportunity. Maybe they havent put much thought into it. Maybe they didnt think it would sell or any other reason I myself didnt think of. Just thought it would be cool. There are so many cosmetics that I want to rock in my real day to day life.
---
I'M AN ADULT!!
---
I've always seen it as a Battle Royale when rank reset happens. The weak stay with the weak while the strong rip each other to shreds
---
btw they can‚Äôt escape from there they got a seal the portal first lmao
---
Nice.
---
They made changes (earlier this year I think?) to chest drops, and that included Luck affecting item loot
---
No? They gave every survivor a unique animation
---
Exactly, but some people are screaming like the sky is falling.
---
They don‚Äôt call it ‚Äògod pallet‚Äô for nothing.
---
I never wanted that name!
---
I use tinker, enduring, distressing, and discordance because I patrol gens with billy due to his speed but can really go wrong for u if u get an indoor map
---
She never got to it
---
\*personnel
---
First time? Suuuure
---
I dont see the play that was made. Am I blind?
---
Can't even trust the hatch these days! I bet they called you a camper for it! LOL
---
Yeah I mean most of the stuff on the deadbydaylight store is pretty new, so hopefully they add more clothes, definitely missing out.
---
Nah, people just don't like broken, unfair mechanics. 
---
Like, look at a god Trapper. They're terrifying! But it feels fair to face. All the killers are scary when played by someone competent. Spirit is easy to play and feels very cheesy to play against, so there's a reason she's the most hated killer, and it has nothing to do with her being scary.
---
WHEN I‚ÄôM THE LAST SURVIVOR I ALWAYS DIE, BUT IF SOMEONE ELSE IS THE LAST SURVIVOR THE KILLER ALWAYS LETS THEM HAVE THE HATCH
---
That would make sence i thought he would see the locker door
---
ha I got in a game with this guy with this same setup lol
---
Hopefully
---
Nice mask
---
Well if ur trying to get that adept achievement, you can't use enduring XD
---
I do this typically 2-3 times a game as Freddy. Only exception is against most red ranks it's a lot harder to pull off (have to channel when they run around a corner). 
---
This is what makes Freddy good. His other power is nothing compared to his mind game potential
---
Aura perks are good for pig, so I‚Äôd do bbq instead of HG. Pig also spends a lot of time slowing down gameplay with her head traps, so you could replace MYC with sloppy butcher to slow it down even more.
---
Were you swinging early on purpose?
---
Music theme no but Leatherface yes &lt;3
---
Yeah I played her a lot when she released. I don‚Äôt really now unless I have a daily, but the difference is huge.
---
I mean, it isn't all THAT bad.. I would know. I post to it.
---
Otz does, though usually both Tapes at the same time.
---
Makes a big ol' œï shape.
---
I don‚Äôt tbag unless the killer is being extremely toxic and I don‚Äôt click flashlights either unless I want there attention but I‚Äôm not trying to be toxic and plus if u just decide to not save me that just hurts you not me I couldn‚Äôt care less about pips but ok man no need to be toxic about it
---
That‚Äôs pretty bing bong
---
Trust me keep this happiness it wont last long
---
Gonna side with devonte here, you is a wrong boi.
---
So? People have different taste
---
I feel attacked
---
Thank you!
---
Lmao Hillbilly and Demo on the same tier classic
---
‚ÄúkiLLeRs HavE It Too hARd!!!‚Äù
---
also, has this happen to you when you go try to heal an unbroken injured teammate? the fucking worst..
---
**fuck an in game character who is meant to be played against and as**
---
You shouldn‚Äôt give hatch to begin with, you‚Äôre better than what the game expects you to be
---
Didn‚Äôt say fun said more points definitely prefer to go against something else but free points I‚Äôll take any time
---
I didn't say it was bad. I was just saying that the gay/futa stuff is there too
---
I mean i still got 4 gg's after the match. do you think it was after they bought a new tv or xbox?
---
What‚Äôs your point then?
---
Can we stop with the ‚Äúsurvivor disguise‚Äù killer ideas? Genuinely getting sick of them. No offense.
---
Oh u sweet summer child... u have no idea the horrors of this community....
---
The fact you use trapper as an example shows you never play killer, trappers absolutely trash. 
---
What even is a ‚Äúgod trapper‚Äù? Someone that places traps slightly smarter than the rank 20 trappers? Lol
---
Are we arguing?
---
That's just the rating of the overall movie, not the acting of a single individual.
---
I had a stroke trying to read the title
---
LMAO A MIND GAME with 0 counters
---
Lolü§£ survivor mains love claiming they play both sides to make their wrong opinions seem credible.
---
Ayyyyyy
---
Bottom is hotter by far
---
It‚Äôs certainly not ‚Äúmostly‚Äù gay/futa
---
The average dbd player will get really mad and either DC or talk shit in the end game chat. I once ran tombstone piece and literally everyone DC
---
You need to stop making up strawman to defend your terrible points tbh, i never said OoO and instaheals are toxic, but the players using them on his stream **are** and they use it because both of those are **strong** tools survivors have, it doesn't matter how you feel about the balance of something in the end tho, the problem is with the player; And this game has terrible, toxic players on both sides, who WILL abuse strong perks, add-ons, and tactics.
---
How did he one hit down the with a hatchet without irredesant head?
---
I only give hatch if the survivor gave me a challenge or their team did nothing and so on
---
Or even yamamokeistjfbakkkkkklltusnaicysoaidjnfinkssishayis slippers
---
&gt; We usually win but not before I have a brain aneurysm from sheer unbridled frustration.
---
This. I fucking hate him. He's not OP, just fucking annoying.
---
See Techies in Dota for more information.
---
Ok
---
I main killer in red ranks, lol.
---
Not even him uses his own perk "wake up"
---
You mean that you found a nea that WASN'T toxic!?           /s
---
I‚Äôve never seen such a gruesome mori before! Nice!
---
Not really. They announced when they added unique animations for lobby survivors, and there were plenty of videos here about it.
---
If you watch the animation he actually does the M1 cooldown animation, so I'd assume because of the connection he was able to throw a hatchet then instantly m1.
---
Or you know, dont
---
Has happened to me so many times...
---
I still haven't gone against Freddy plauge or demo yet on ps
---
See I would agree but since it's a Hillbilly and I saw and heard him later in the match, I don't know
---
OvErSaTuRaTeD cOnTeNt
---
Can confirm, haven‚Äôt played since the reset. I tried the day of and had 3 games in a row of not hooking anyone
---
Don't use sf and enduring pls it's just gonna turn you into a fraud billy
---
Perfect timing.  The Archives, Rift and Halloween event start in 4 days.  There might be an upcoming 2x event as well.
---
Play how you want and have fun.  If you have questions you can find answers here or the wiki.  I also recommend checking out twitch.  This game is very enjoyable to watch and there are some great DBD streamers.
---
I play survivor and killer at red ranks. Have you seen Devi or Otz play Trapper? They're amazing. Again, my comment still stands that anyone who is competent can make any killer scary to face.
---
I was talking about the very first downs while they were on a generator
---
He is a worse Billy in a nutshell
---
He has a charged up dash but democorgi only does 1 state of damage 
---
He has good map control unless someone destroys his portal which takes - hear me out - 12 seconds to do , unlike Billy who can just decide to go over somewhere
---
When he teleports you instantly know he does so you can't be stealthy for shit also THUMP THUMP THUMP NOISES
---
Also his pallet destroy ability is actually longer then normal if you didnt predict it 
---
Fun killer - mediocre power level so the survivor mains wont complain about new op killer
---
Is this why I get jumped first when I play Steve? I am just a really newb survivor who loves Steve.
---
"Demo stretches, Sir!"
---
This cosplay is fucking awesome and so are you and your friends. Y‚Äôall look like good pals and it warms my heart to see people being so wholesome in the community.
---
I mean you could say the same old BNP, old Sabo, old Moris, true infinites, pallet vacuum, etc.
---
This comment thread is a buggy as that game. Whenever I try to read your reply, it cuts half of it off and when I scroll back down it does it again lol. You're probably right though.
---
that's called doing gens
---
Yeah that‚Äôs bad enough
---
New in game hazard: rolling your ankles.
---
Same for me. I mostly play Doc, LF, and Wraith at rank 1 so it feels like a huge power leap. I think the ideal solution is to raise killers' overall power through changes to maps and objectives while tuning down the top-tiers proportionally. That way the weaker killers benefit more while the top ones stay generally the same.
---
And then I had a lot of survivor's who DC'ed against me when I played Trapper...
---
Or you know the killer instinct showing the exact position of the survivor
---
There is actually a blendette there, look closely.
---
If the survivor wiggles for a single second when I'm going to give hatch I hook them
---
*What did it cost?* 
---
*Everything*
---
&gt; they actually asked the devs for buffs. Like 115% speed movement and the ability to see auras when phasing
---
okay,
---
1) no, no one ever asked for that shit
---
2) that is comically OP
---
Hex: Life Alert
---
Yeah but Spirit is still in the game.
---
I found him annoying to play as. He's too loud, not even in a way "he gives himself away", but rather "I can't hear shit when I play him". And his TP is quite wasted opportunity. Why even give "oblivious" status effect when closing a tear if whole map is notified when I use it? Shred is cool and all, but Billy is better in every single way. I can't even tell, which add-ons are good on him (or even good at all). It feels like he suffers from the same problem as The Pig, because none of them help Demogorgon to catch survivors (actually the Pig even better because she has a brown and a yellow add-ons that slightly make ambush better). And he has NO fun add-ons, NONE.
---
Go watch Otz or Devi play Trapper.
---
Because they wanted to flame the killer for being bad too.
---
There is no meaningful difference between flashlights, purple does just as much as a yellow.
---
Nevermind, feels bad man
---
This reminds me of that devil kid from Scary Godmother. Check me if I'm wrong
---
Wood fired itself. What fuck is wood doing now?
---
Puppers plays on PS4 sometimes!
---
I rarely play killer &amp; am very bad at tracking, so when I do this and the survivor doesn't get it and hides, I am sometimes unable to find them again right away, which is prolonging the game unecessarily. Then I regret mistakenly thinking that maybe I faced a survivor with at least 1 braincell (since, well, we all know how randoms are)  and trying to give them the hatch.
---
Legion pips like crazy though
---
That's actually pretty good, will try it
---
Welcome, I wish you many survivor puddings and party cakes in your future!
---
This is the only time I‚Äôve seen someone else acknowledge that billy is hard to play and I appreciate it very much. Most of the time all you hear is that he‚Äôs a strong killer but no one mentions the practice that u need to put in to do well with him.
---
As killer if I‚Äôm already at the exit and your waiting for me to hit you for bp I don‚Äôt mind but if you make me come find you because you want to show off that you‚Äôre at the hatch after all your friends left. Fuck off fr.
---
You make it sound like survivor mains are the only ones who wish certain killers to be nerfed. Like, Nurse mains were saying she's too OP for a loong time
---
Thanks for the heads up! I‚Äôm bout to pop some auric cells
---
Well actually the arrow is pointed towards the killer at this point. So maybe he is insinuating to kill yourself.
---
The chainsaw you can find online but i think it‚Äôs discontinued so it might be a little pricey, it came out a while back but its colored like the one from the 1974 film and the one in the game (yellow/gray). His costumes badass
---
ThAtS nOt An ExPlOiT bEcAuSe I dIdNt Do It On PuRpOsE, nOw I dEsErVe WiN Ez Gg
---
That's not accurate at all, to do this properly you'd need a ML or a lot of time, get the average cost to level to 50 then perform this calculation.
---
Even a rough like getting the cheapest route then most expensive and slightly nudging towards the more expensive route would be better analysis.
---
New people came to DBD purely because of the stranger things DLC. Not because they care about the game or gameplay, but because they could play as their favourite villain/hero.
---
I think it's fair to assume that they might buy a MTX while they're at it if they're already investing money into something they might know little or nothing about
---
Absolutely
---
Because if no one goes for their bait they're wasting time.
---
Simply put, they have to earn it.
---
Right, yes, that too haha
---
What otz posts on his channel is literally the best of his examples. A lot of the time the gens get murdered and he just defaults to regular killer strategy
---
I feel like you should be able to attach portals to walls, what do you guys think?
---
*I'll take your entire stock!!*
---
That‚Äôs fine take your time
---
BILL BILL BILL BILL
---
Very bold of you. Using Jane without Iron Will.
---
I tried, once. Just to make sure. Turns out, I‚Äôm way to straight for my own good.
---
Hippity happity taste the zappity

I like how you've got him completely centered on your screen, while sniffing his ass, and he only *just* got revealed.
---
Fuck Ghostface and everything he represents.
---
Hell yes
---
I understand that the perk is pretty shit when it comes to lowering the progression but 11 seconds can make a huge difference it can mean life or death on the hook and to make every hook buffed there would be no point to basement builds with it it would just ruin the perk and the game in my opinion but it is just my opinion
---
LOL no it‚Äôs probably the most OP perk in the game!!!! Needs to be removed!!!
---
Honestly I wish there was an option for killers to turn on killer specific hooks. Personally I don't mind if survivors know I'm Nurse or Billy, they'll here me in the first few seconds anyways. Just let the killer choose if they like that or not.
---
"Did a pretty good job so far." Actually  though  its amazing
---
Running a perk roulette build or no perk build always kind of freshens things up. A perk roulette build sometimes helps you find synergies you didn't even know existed and a no perk build is a fun challenge that usually helps you develop your mechanical skill and make you rely less on your perks. When I was burnt out I ran no perk Hillbilly for like two weeks and got from Rank 12 to 1 with zero perks. It feels really rewarding to realize what you can do at a disadvantage like that.
---
It's been both of those for long time.
---

---
even with the timer change, i really like to play endgame piggy. bloodwarden, remember me, NOED, and a wildcard. if you think NOED is to cheese you can change that one aswell. give the survivors some nice new hats when they need 2  / 1 more gen. they are useless when all gens are finnished, but putting them on just before that makes them A) stop working on gens giving you more time to give away even more free hats. or B) finnish the gen and their traps will activate, not allowing them to leave through the gate.  ruleset nr 2 is a very nice addon with this ( they dont see auras of boxes untill their trap activates).
---
also with aby build:
---
if you combine crate of gears and tampered timer addons you are likely to get some kills with the traps, just save them up a bit + wards
---
Definitely the sound. Blood is almost impossible to see in some areas.
---
That said, blood is definitely underused by a lot of killers.
---
I didnt say it was impossible to win with those killers. You can win with any killer as long as they have an attack lmfao. That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre good. Or viable.
---
Wait, Myers doesn‚Äôt talk
---
Yes I try to as much as possible and always when I get meaningful chases and they put in work and if the bring me an offering then that‚Äôs a free man in my eyes, unless they didn‚Äôt do shit
---
Or just solve the problem of wasting time chasing the best looper and take that threat out of the game early with a mori.
---
Take a break...maybe the rift/archives/event will give you a little more to do.  
---
Otherwise get on that stream grind.  You never know where it will lead.
---
I was in the same camp for a long time
---
I highly recommend watching Otzdarva‚Äôs Youtube videos. He‚Äôs an astonishingly good Trapper (good enough that he makes me want to try Trapper out), and he‚Äôs good for improving one‚Äôs killer game in general
---
Also I highly recommend you getting Freddy, he‚Äôs like the easy version of Demogorgon
---
Ok thanks for the info, that clears my descision :) weil honestly i wanted to give her sorta "meh" perks since we already have strong ones like deceisive strike and so on. But if you got any ideas for better perks, tell me :3
---
I actually am indeed gay
---
r/ketamine
---
grandma witch tits is coming for that ass boyo
---
I wish I thought of this before the cosmetic contest ended. I would have totally drawn this up for a submission.
---
I‚Äôve taken multiple breaks one for 6 months and before that 3 months but I just find myself bored. And absolutely I‚Äôm streaming as much as I can now and yes I am extremely excited about the archives I figure that it will spice things up for sure
---
Haha me too! 
---
If only they had a tag team killer gamemode we could be good friends
---
Discordance vs Prove thyself?
---
Any suggestions as to where to set up random perks builds
---
For me it‚Äôs pig. When you just see her out of the edge of your screen crouch creeping towards you. Fuck no. That bitch has made me use Spine Chill now
---
Weird that the cutscenes from the archives have not been spoiled yet.
---
At that point just try mind gaming the spirit
---
I'm really curious about **You, Yes You**.  Can streamers and people on PTB not see what it is either?
---
Jump on that deal.  BBQ, Freddy, Myers...might as well grab them all.
---
Yes obviously they will have more uses but it doesn't matter if you know how to play against flashlights. 
---
If you don't give them opportunities to flashlight save the longer battery life won't do anything. Longer battery life only matters if the killer allows survivors multiple chances to flashlight save. It's not like they can blind you faster or more reliably.
---
quick question, why are you running monitor on doc?
---
Freddy is super fun against pallet spammers
---
Resilience will generally have a better payoff, but keep in mind that using the 99% with Self Care is usually harder to get off than you‚Äôd expect, and teammates will very often come up to you and finish the heal before you can stop them
---
Do you do challenges?  IE weird perks, no perks, triple killer stuns?
---
DM me your twitch name.  I‚Äôve been looking for a console streamer.
---
Using the highest tier players as an example is a completely mute argument, you think they balance the game based of the top 1%? No, they don‚Äôt. 
---
Trapper has garbage early game, if you want to properly set up traps you‚Äôre going to lose 2 gens easily if not more, and if you want to pressure gens or take a chase you‚Äôre going to get minimal use from your power. 
---
How many of these ‚Äúgod trappers‚Äù do you actually see in matchmaking? I see maybe 1 trapper a week in red purple or green ranks and he gets destroyed, 2k at best case senecio. 
---
If he spawned with all his traps maybe he‚Äôd be a decent killer but as of now he gets dragged down too hard by the early game.
---
Is Freddy worth getting? I‚Äôve been hearing a lot of mixed views on him
---
I'm pretty sure they left them out of the files from the PTB. As soon as the Archives actually do come out, I bet someone will upload them like 20 minutes after the patch launches.
---
Lmao she might have been if I was playing for real!
---
Now give it some shards of glass oni horns!
---
Well you can go to the Wiki page (Just type "dead by daylight Wiki" on google and It will show up) pretty much all the lore is there. 
---
If you go to Freddy's profile you'll see the quote im mentioning 
---
Hope this helps :)
---
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be homophopic
---
Killer mains do the same thing.....
---
As a horny anime loving female I'm offended
---
Nah he did what he wanted, he told you not to kill anyone. It's rule number 69,420 in the survivor rule book: if thou-est name, kill this guy &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;, comes up in thou-est lobby-est and he-eth is last-eth in-eth line-eth than thou-est shall not-est kill-eth survivor-eths.
---
I mean spirit doesnt need ruin if your going for the pure 4k.
---
Hag is free
---
That's it. They got what they wanted with Nurse, now they try the same tantrum with a slightly weaker killer. They'll do the same with all of them in order if it works on Spirit.
---
/u/uwutranslator
---
Last of us done dawn ain‚Äôt really my style tho
---
Looks great. Better than anything I can do. Outstanding
---
So you think spirit is the better choice?
---
The survivor mains can‚Äôt make a valid argument so they point you to cherry picked gameplay from a YouTuber that will obviously also cherry pick what matches he uploads.
---
Ur the special one yeah tbh. You shouldnt  have not chance in a mindgame as well.
---
Yes I do but very rarely
---
I like it! Curious as to what your process was like for making it?
---
It actually does *not* ignore iron will. Iron Will, as simplistic as the perk sounds, it does not give you a straight forward mute. It quite clearly states that it reduces your noise produced while wounded by 100%, Stridor makes it so survivors produce 50% more noise while wounded. Ergo, Iron Will is only 50% as effective. It is a counter, but it does not override the effect altogether and make Iron Will useless. It makes Iron will 50% useless against Stridor. The glass is half *full*.
---
Ha ha no.
---
Once babysitter Steve drops, all Scoops Steves deserve it simply for poor taste
---
I'd say Hag because of her perks and the fact you have little experience as killer. Spirit is better, but more difficult to master. I'd leave her for later.
---
So basically what you're saying is playing to win as survivor is toxic, got it.
---
I actually talked about this recently. 
---
BHVR hasn't fixed any of the bugs that showed up in the first iteration of dedicated servers, Wraith still randomly gets his cloaked speed while uncloaked, he still sometimes goes back to invisible after uncloaking, having to do it again. 
---
Myers still has the tier 2-3 bug where he has to stalk again to reach tier 3. 
---
Hitboxes and latency are still a pain in the ass, but there's a hell of a lot more bugs than those. BHVR hasn't fixed them. 
---
I agree that it's not a simple or easy job, but it's disingenuous to pretend for a moment that BHVR has taken most of the bug reports they've received seriously. Again, people have video evidence of all of this happening, from much bigger, more well-known streamers and we're still at this point.
---
I'm not sure what they're looking for in the current test, but I hope they find it soon.
---
When you already had the nightmare edition before it was even announced. Haha, I need to stop buying DLCS for this game.
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking, get some decent perks on Killer before moving on
---
Yes, and as I said, the Spirit has been the main focus only once the Nurse was announced to be nerfed.
---
Yeah it was during the first backstory montage. The initial backstory montage has a lot of references to the Sam Raimi trilogy, notably a tongue-and-cheek reference to edgy Peter and his cringe nerd dance.
---
good point
---
he is. about a week or a weak and a half after the DLC came out, ive seen him like.. maybe around three times a week. and ive been red rank all this time.
---
Not really - there have consistently been 3 killers considered top tier (apart from the brief legion exploit)
---
I‚Äôm not saying they all need needs but I doubt anyone would call for a demogorgon or Freddy nerf now
---
Devour hope says hi.
---
Lol yeah I do remember that one xD. What a perfect movie.  Thanks much friend!
---
That's Amazing, so nicely done!
---
&gt;Alright buddy, first of all calm down. Did you really need to format your response?
---
What? Lol 
---
&gt;I use Iron Will as a preventive measure to try and survive a killer who loses line of sight, what about that makes me "mad" exactly?
---
If you're not mad about your perk not being able to counter half of a killers ability, then you're at least bitching about it, either way it's a stupid complaint
---
If only their was a sneeze perk. Dude would have shit himself.
---
Inb4 Doc rework: Madness 3 blocks you from the exit.
---
when the new pig cosmetics and out I played tapp, and faced a pig on the game who put a bear trap on me and blocked any jigsaw box I went to until I died
---
He almost looks like he is smiling, good job though
---
Buy legion (THIS IS A JOKE) but hag is a better choice if unless you can play spirit really well
---
yes
---
I never noticed the "nerf nurse!" Rant posts nearly in the volume we've seen spirit posts in the last week
---
Yes. Shes more challenging to pick up then people say though (not nurse challenging ofc) but trying to mindgame and the survivor just runs to the next pallet can waste time along with u just starting to phase and the survivor does happen to slow vault the pallet or has Iron Will it can really screw you over. The best add ons are the glasses and the amulet excluding THOSE ADDONS. The one tip I can give you tho is dont turn your camera at all until the phase charge bar is completely full, if you do the survivors can see this.
---
\-Nerf insta heals on the PTB
---
\-Community freaks out, starts wasting all theirs in the live build
---
\-2 weeks pass
---
\-Revert the nerf when the live version comes out
---
\-Everyone has wasted their insta heals so killers stop complaining
---
\-Finally, the game is balanced
---
*mathieu cote laughs in 4D chess*
---
It just depends on my mood. If I had to deal with toxic Claudettes the game before you better believe it buddy, I'm going to be as nice as fucking possible to show those little shits that just because someone was toxic to me, I don't need to take it out on baby Dweets and turn them into toxic Nancies.
---
It's a bug, you can retain the speed boost you get from getting hit sometimes. Idk what causes it.
---
#BRUH IS THIS BETTER?
---
You do have a chance though. Stop being predictable and the spirit wont find you so easily.
---
Kill one survivor by your hands as the one killer that you never leveled past 1.
---
Happened to me last night when I didn't realize it was a spirit. I felt so bad.
---
Ask yourself is it worth it for a bloody piece of clothing? Do I want this? Will I even wear it? Or would I just waste my time and effort into prestiging to not even care or wear it. 
---
Then last question is do I play this game often? Because if so grinding back up won‚Äôt be as horrible if you don‚Äôt play as often.
---
I just play Myers and gorgon
---
Perfect. Thank you :)
---
A what?!
---
I give hatch for three reasons
---
1. 4 or 5 gens are left
---
2. Their teammates were toxic
---
3. It's a terrified baby Dweet
---
That‚Äôs necrophilia.
---
Hey i main ash &gt;:|
---
Thanks
---
My bad, I've only got my missed game, and stopped using it. I didn't know this was a known thing.
---
Hardly, its not hard to counter
---
Just cause you're bad doesn't mean everyone is. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Iri King Doctor isn't that bad. Yeah all the penalties added up are oppressive though. 
---
What is bad/cancer is "Hostage Doc" AKA 3-Gen anti-skillcheck Doctor. Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence, and a 4th perk (I run BBQ for more points and better momentum but some ran stuff like Dying Light, Thanataphobia, Coulrophobia, Overwhelming Presence, Franklin's Demise, or Hex: Huntress Lullaby for maximum anti-skillcheck) double calm addons for a MASSIVE terror radius, and a Jigsaw Piece so you play on Gideon Meat Plant/The Game aka one of the smallest maps. 
---
With a giant TR and tiny map survivors are almost always in your terror radius building up madness and under the affects of Unnerving Presence and any other "Debuff in TR" perks you could be running in the 4th slot like Coulrophobia or Overwhelming Presence. Unnerving does make the overcharge skillcheck harder, and combined with Doctor's base kit putting the skillcheck randomly on the screen it will be very hard to hit.
---
So you 3-gen, play defensively, and you can drag the game to an absolute crawl. 
---
Sniper/Railgun Doc is another fun one. It's not cancerous but pretty strong. Green Electrode and Interview Tape turns your shock into a very long beam. If you take off distressing and add Monitor and Abuse (So running a "Stealthy" Doctor build instead of an obnoxiously large anti-skillcheck TR one) you can zap people outside of your terror radius which is pretty startling to be on the receiving end of.
---
Sorry for resposti, I forgot to assign a flair and didnt want this to die in new üôè
---
I can see that
---
If I 4K as trapper I walk in and out of a trap so the last thing they hear is me tryna nut
---
Of a pro basically playing M1 the game against potato survivors.  Gotta love it right.
---
Spirit is overall the better killer by far but u will need ruin whether you like it or not spirit will take some time to get used to so I would suggest getting yourself comfortable with an easier killer first anyway
---
No it doesn't. It makes you default loud, versus super fucking loud. Iron will definetly is doing "something",
---
This was the original point which you failed to argue and it qualifies your comments as at the very least bitching, because there is no substance to them, by your own omission
---
Yeah thats all you have to say of course. Nothing to really contribute because you know....  
---
Gg‚Äôs.ü§£
---
THE ANXIETY OF WHETHER OR NOT SOMEONE IS GONNA SPAM HATEFUL COMMENTS RIGHT AFTER A GAME. MORE OFTEN THAN NOT.
---
Do people actually do this? If you like one of them your just asking them to hate you just about.
---
I‚Äôm think is 14 seconds to cleanse normal so I think thrill would add another 7 seconds into that with all 5 dulls
---
Tbh right now the perk isn't even really worth for basement builds. It really needs a buff. Maybe in a different way that a flat buff to all hooks, but right now it is worthless.
---
When will this be considered over saturation?
---
What was that? A no-cool-down one-shot ability? Yeah, he does have that. From the start of the game, too. Crazy, I know
---
Nope they can just jump in because the portal isnt active yet
---
As a Doctor main I can confirm. I don't 3-gen from the start but I do run the 3-gen build and plan my match around 3-genning at the end if I have to. (I find the closest 3 gens at match start and play as normal but protecting those gens more than others, and as gens get finished I get more and more defensive until I'm 3-genning at the end. Basically at match start I am 4 or 5 genning.) 
---
It's especially brutal on Gideon Meat Plant.
---
Here have some copy paste.   
---
Iron Will on paper prevents 100% of grunts while in pain, while strider increased the noise produced by 50%. Grunts of pain should not be heard period. Her increase to breathing is a separate matter because that has nothing to do with the perk.
---
Wait so if someone had a key would they be forced to seal the portal, if so ima take note of this lol
---
Or. Delete the perk. Start a new one.
---
I was expecting the Myers animatronic to actually be a guy in a suit and was gonna surprise the girl.
---
Yeah i guess
---
At tier 3 with five totems on the map is 30%. Normal speed is 14 seconds so you need 18.2 seconds to cleanse a totem.

I WAS A BABY TRAPPER ONLY USED MY TRAP TWICE AND ONLY CAUGHT ONCE AND I EVEN WALKED INTO MY OWN TRAP AND I WAS PLAYING AGAINST RANK 8S AND 10S AS A RANK 20 KILLER SCARCIFICED 2 DOWNED THE 3RD AND WENT FOR THE LAST BUT THE ONE IN THE DYING STATE D/CED SO THE LAST ONE GOT HATCH AND I WAS LIKE "OH WELL" AND THEY WERE ALL TOXIC CALLING ME BAD BECAUSE THEY USED TO BE RED RANKS BEFORE THE RANK RESET AND SINCE I HAVE 50+H AND IM A SURVIOUR MAIN I SHOULD "GET GUD" ND HAVE A BETTER RANK BUT I PRETTY MUCH GOT 3/4 AND IF SHE DIDNT DC I WOULDVE GOTTEN ALL FOUR

---
Yeah but the one bug usually buffs trapper so thry care more in thar situation
---
Quitting games repeatedly so you can get easier matches instead of just improving your play. So sick of this shitty attitude. This game's playerbase has a serious attitude problem.
---
Stalking the stalker be like
---
His portals are junk. They require enormous setup time to be useful for map pressure, to the point that against good survivors, you have to throw the game to use them.
---
I did this last night for someone, only we were at the gate so they got the idea. Last survivor standing, came up behind them and scooped them up. I just let them struggle free and then do their thing. 
---
She healed, I stalked into Evil Within III, then we bid farewell.
---
DS
---
Oh god. Please go learn what a mindgame is.
---
If the survivor is just standing there the spirit has to guess what the survivor is going to do. Stand there or run away. That is a mindgame.
---
If you get outplayed out a mindgame you got outplayed period and deserved to go down. 
---
And you‚Äôre not ‚Äúfucked either way‚Äù
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to be able to just loop the fucking killer all game its a 4v1 not a 1v1. 
---
Go to another loop. If you outplay her at one. 
---
I really shouldn‚Äôt have to babysit you guys on what mindgames are and how they work.
---
*getting shocked screams*
---
I mean tomb is very strong but also not hard to counter if you seem him looking at you for a long time he more then likely has tomb and when he pops t3 look at his left hand if it‚Äôs open he definitely has it so just jump in a locker.
---
I know Bricky sells a "Shock Tee" which is the Doctor's face with 4 Disconnect icons below it. Sums up my mindset and what I'm aiming for when I'm playing Doc.
---
Yes and it‚Äôs sad, I don‚Äôt though

Hey, still pretty new to the game been playing for about a month.  I have a question about losing progress.  Multiple times now after playing for a night, the next day I'll hop on and notice I've randomly lost a bunch of character levels.  It doesn't happen every time or anything, but enough times to be noticeable now and it's really irritating.
---
Is there something that triggers this or a way to combat it?  I'm closing the game normally each time, not sure what causes it, but it sucks.
---
lol it is not that easy at all
---
Ahhh
---
I don't mind sometimes letting the soul survivor go, I'm realizing after playing a few days. If the rest of the match was fun and we all got plenty of action, why not.
---
Eh it‚Äôs I see it as taking a pic with a celebrity as long as you don‚Äôt tunnel
---
Why don't we just make the Spirit unable to hear survivors while phasing?
---
I almost always give hatch or let one go mainly because I‚Äôm in no rush to rank 1
---
When I place a trap only to chase a survivor into it several minutes later. [Me](https://i.imgur.com/N6beCkp.jpg)
---
Can anyone explain how this counters spirit. I am quite new.
---
Stealth is a major component of the game there are some Killers who do indeed counter stealth however some Killers the best way to counter them is Stealth like nurse for example it's a very bad idea to try to beat a good nurse in a chase so you have to try to break Line of Sight and stealth her
---
I know right? Some of the cry babies are from when the game was free on PS4 and don‚Äôt know the horrors of Iridescent Head hatchets on Huntress + Eboni Mori.

Still haven‚Äôt had any arguments contested, maybe they‚Äôre the potatos in the videos and that‚Äôs why they think trappers good hahaha.
---
They just want easy c wins its so obvious. At this point I wonder what they‚Äôll do to spirit. Get rid of collision maybe?  Slower speeds?
---
I'm only gay for Myers and daddy Clown
---
Nurse has counterplay when the maps have LOS blockers and is WAY more fun to face than spirit.  Why feel bad yknow?
---
Can confirm. One of the reasons why I mained doc (I loved his look, the interface screw he brings, good at farming BP, etc.) was because I read he is one of the best salt miners in DBD. I am one annoying fucker IRL so of course I picked the most annoying killer to play against. 
---
I am hoping the addon rework only makes him even more obnoxious like having the fake doctors chase survivors around or fake generators and hex totems, reversing the controls, blurring the screen, deafening survivors, etc.
---
Oh dont get me wrong I usually win against immersed survivors. I just dont find it fun to walk around every rock and tree looking for a crouched claudette.
---
I find chases and mind games to be the fun part of playing killer. Which even when you find the blendette there is still no chase, because you will just down her instantly.
---
This is hilarious.
---
You do know the actual player model itself can obscure ghostfacers reveal process.
---
If you're trying to reveal ghost face and your actual character model is in any way shape or form slightly blocking his character it will Hinder revealing him
---
New pallet buff looking nice
---
Ace and Bill are the Chads of dbd
---
Look at the whole game
---
I'm like 99% sure you only get 50 points from them but okay.
---
Why trapper all the way down there. Have you felt the rush of downing a survivor then two others step into a trap, and then you have 3 hooks in a couple of seconds.
---
I was playing trapper and someone landed in my trap late game. I picked them up, took them to the gate and let them struggle off. They then sprinted away from me, landing in another trap not even 3 seconds later.  Like dude....
---
noed does not need a nerf
---
Now survivors can travel though the butthole too &lt;3
---
Looks fine to me.
---
Oof no love for playing as Steve babysitting the rank 20s
---
Of course pallet loops have nothing to do with flashlights. The entire point of this was to say "Hey, I kinda hate rank reset because I try to use a killer which i'm pretty bad at and I get bullied by 3-4 stack SWF groups with certain items and addons." I only mentioned the pallet loops because, as I said, i'm trash as huntress. And I actually can't afford a headset that's worth anything because hospital bills, so I can't track them during a blind. And is it much of a handicap for survivors if they're blinding a killer who can't deal with such? And for addendum, I DID check the area around the combine, it's just that she was hiding in the Killer shack. She ran out to blind just as I started to come back up the combine to pick him up. And in which patch were the bulbs nerfed? I'm blind as all hell so I normally skip over important things in patch notes accidentally
---
If I can hear a survivor i am 100% trusting the sounds i hear over anything else. 
---
You might be able to trick me with your scratches or blood, but sound doesn't lie. I can tell if you change directions from the other side if a wall using sound and then cut you off without ever even seeing your scratches or blood.
---
I guess the trade off here is you don‚Äôt have to be injured to use lithe though
---
It makes me happy ;). Fun story the first time this happened to me I didn't even know what the fuck was going on. I accidentally Ran straight into the Myers will Bill and he just picked me up and killed me.
---
I would drink huntress's milk
---
I think that they might make her lose her entire power gauge no matter how long she uses the power for. It make it a bit easier to tell when or if she‚Äôs faking a power use.
---
NO! ZIP THEM BACK UP!
---
Letting survs bleed out only give you 50 points and is mostly counterintuitive. If you let them bleed out constantly, you belong in rank 15.
---
I'm a survivor main but like to play legion sometimes. In my opinion, he is the most fun killer to play. I think some people just don't like the constant mending. As a survivor I still don't mind legion games. But tbh I don't dislike playing against any killer.
---
No love for my big man trapper smh
---
I feel bad going up against demogorgons Who tries to stealth.
---
They're doing a great job using undetectable only for you to hear the immense amount of stomping that the demo makes

It literaly says "Don't own" in his teir lol
---
Save up a lot, then prestige.
---
I mean Ghostface is anyone lol.
---
Stridor does counter Iron will but if we‚Äôre being serious here, only new/bad spirits run Stridor. 
---
Even with Ironwill a good spirit will still find you nearly everytime.
---
Yeah I undurstand, just saying it is rly helpfull when playing solo

yeah man, if you rustle the jimmies of the toxic survivor group they'll muster about 300 down-votes on you.

That's what I was thinking of doing

It's really not tho lol less than half the killers are even viable at red ranks against good swf

You connect upside down with the entity, now we got a black hole and universe is at danger because of you, what have you done?!
---
Banger
---
Too bad it goes the other way around too
---
Ooooohhh I see it
---
How do you go about sufficiently large shards of glass without breaking something important? I'm curious.
---
The official advice is to submit a support ticket as soon as it happens.
---
There are multiple reasons for why you might lose progress. [This link](https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1181259635791159296) explains how to avoid one of them, and the mid-chapter update is just around the corner.
---
Once you understand how the pip system works, you can easily climb by meeting certain objective checkpoints. You have to do X amount of gens or X amount of altruism and chase time to pip. Rank doesn't properly reflect how much skill you have on this game. It's more about how much time you sink into the game. Yes, on average, red ranked players will typically be better than a brown rank. They're more aware that they need to do gens, break totems when needed, map awareness, and understanding how certain killers play. Those are things you understand with playing the game a lot not with skill.
---
They have a few... Not alot tho
---
How much does it matter to you? This looks like it is in a house, so I assume you have windows and mirrors available
---
That's Jeff not Myers lol
---
My name is &lt;‚ÄîKill Him Instead so I feel for this guy
---
It is honestly my opinion that we don't need ranks in this game.  It adds an unnecessary competitive element and it's truly terrible when you play against someone who is so much more high rank than you that you stand no chance just yesterday I played a match where I rank 15,  My 2 team mates were ranked 16/17  Then the 3rd person to join was right 8 and the killer was rank 10
---
yeah it's a bug that happened to one of my friends like 2 days ago.  When he died before the rest of us it showed him the killer's whole load out.
---
It wouldn't work because we all know that millenials are all dead inside
---
Becuase then she would be garbage?
---
Huntress and Toxic Nea
---
Yep. M&amp;A + Double Calm addons. With this type of build you want a "Stealthy" setup like Nurses Calling, Dark Devotion, Tinkerer, Whispers since your TR is so small you won't have good tracking. etc. 
---
IIRC your TR in punishment mode is something like 12 meters. Smaller than base EW2 Myers. 
---
Your TR is small outside of a chase, and larger than normal in a chase or in treatment mode. You can use this to get in a chase, switch to shock, tier up other survivors, etc.
---
I am bummed about the Nurse's Calling nerf where snapping out of it is no longer is detected by Nurse's Calling. It supposedly made Stealth Doctor pretty strong since after a chase and tiering people up, you could ambush them as they try to snap out of it.
---
Lmao "I was mining for 5 hours" you can't hide fatass, even online.
---
Am I stupid? Who tf is that on the right?
---
Now u seen it twice :3
---
Missed opportunity for Billabong
---
I‚Äôd say more like fifty :p
---
If I'm not mistaken, the sales are in the PS Store and don't require cells to purchase, maybe this one is different.
---
I wont try to claim the spirit doesn't have the massive upper hand in this situation... but a perfect read from the survivor and they CAN win the mind game. Thus there is counterplay and yes, it is a mindgame.
---
Is spirit too strong? Is it fair to survivors? These are up for debate. But there is counterplay. That's a fact. Just like there is counterplay to nurse (break line of sight, juke etc.) And yet she still always had the upper hand and was incredibly strong before nerf (probably after too idk)
---
Lol Reddit is fast!!
---
I don't think they are as bad as everyone complains they are, sure they might be weaker but I don't think they are bad at all if you can play them right
---
Shackle trap placement is a bit different for me. Losing the camera tracking sucks, but I try to put them in spots where I'm not going to necessarily need that.
---
yes because the survivor experience is such a blast at red ranks lol
---
Internet connection plays a pretty big part
---
Maybe they are distracted or something
---
Because more then likely they are going for great skill checks and click slightly too fast. People learn your kinda being a baby for going on Reddit to complain. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Could you imagine if you came through the portal right before the survivor got there and closed it?
---
You forget that I‚Äôm very bad at the game
---
Ah yeah, a person (i know only noob3 sorry) who likes to troll and never plays seriously
---
that's dirty
---
I mean re-lighting totems could be too strong. Especially with campers of it and or having 4 marks of Devour Hope. 
---
Basically you did nothing as a survivor.
---
This exactly, if you throw down a pallet in the first chase and then start to tea bag me immediately I‚Äôm going to Mori and tunnel you.  No reason to be toxic that early in the game
---
That is a personal opinion.
---
I think she is on the stronger side (maybe nerf addons but dont touch base kit) 
---
And I also almost always have fun against spirit. The only time I dont have fun is if she is prayer beads spirit or proxy camping make your choice spirit. Nothing else bothers me much
---
From the POV of the other three survivors it will always work. Maybe Kate‚Äôs _true_ audience wasn‚Äôt the killer after all.
---
I'd be mad but probably still laugh and gg. If I had cake or party streamers I'd be pissed
---
I‚Äôve done what most could not
---
Then the cycle reinstated when they say gg ezy baby killer for dropping on hatch.
---
I get that, but it doesn't justify all of the DCing we see. So many matches thrown out the window because people are immature and/or selfish.
---
Think of it like this, it'll make yall destroy all totems so u wont worry about noed.
---
What makes the clown boring? ü§°
---
Nurse has been overpowered since the day she was released, and still is today. I remember saying the spirit was broken and completely overpowered the day she hit the ptb. People were saying she was underpowered even after numerous buffs when she was officially released. I knew she was bullshit the first match I ever played her. I figured out the standing at a pallet trick immediately, and its just as easy, and even more broken then it was then.
---
Passing down the ancient ways
---
No what‚Äôs that
---
He‚Äôs likely asking why he doesn‚Äôt own Freddy yet...
---
the gens are fighting back
---
When ghost face is in stalking mode, survivors can take him out of it by looking at him for a little bit. That‚Äôs what the sound and flash is - ghost face being looked at and forced out of stalk mode.
---
Do killers actually accept item offerings?
---
I‚Äôve never tried to offer a flashlight or a map to a killer.
---
I have ADHD so that's 90% of the reason I miss mine
---
It‚Äôs a secondary objective after doing totems and making sure you throw all the pallets down
---
If you're all missing the skillcheck and getting it often, you can literally spend like 10+ seconds on a gen with 3 people and make no progress on it, which is horribly inefficient.
---
The only way I see you can effectively brute force through ruin is with prove thyself and toolboxes if you are all on it.
---
Can I get this format? It's hilarious
---
Big dick energy build. Heartbeat as far as possible.
---
The couterplay to spirit is a 50/50. Is she standing still? Do I double back? 50/50 everytime. There is no read. It doesn‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm playing vs a human because the lack of data of what the opponent is doing. Imagine playing a multiplayer game versus a character whose moves and tactics are invisible to you.
---
Stridor makes someone's noise 150%. Ironwill takes 100% away. Now you're left at 50%
---
"That's just the way it is" is not an acceptable excuse for endgame toxicity. Ever.
---
I have three excuses usually. I'm either drunk, tired or both.
---
YOU SCUM! /S
---
It still sucks to not have the chance of being saved. I don't think anything in the game is as a bad as keys though.
---
Probably distractions, sometimes someone will be using the blender and I can‚Äôt hear them
---
Yeah I saw. Nothing good though. I would like to see full outfits released.
---
Welcome!!! If you like the licensed characters give Myers a try too
---
Can't go wrong either way. Both are excellent killers, but both have a steeper learning curve, especially Hag. Both have great teachable perks that many consider mandatory.
---
I'm bi so I'm 50% gay
---
so I'm not gay
---
loophole bitches
---
What is omega blink ?
---
it can happen with any speed boost, even when getting hit
---
Seems about right
---
You win this one
---
I once had a billion notifications go off so I finally go over to check. Meg wanted me to watch her escape through the hatch so she kept vaulting back and forth.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure the etiquette is to spin rapidly in circles and smack a wall. Always works for me. Even did it once to trick a survivor into not struggling so I could them to a hook that was far away.
---
To me she's the most fun killer to face besides Nurse. Any killer that breaks up running the same loops over and over again is great to me. With Spirit I need to get a read on how that player is playing her, adjust my running accordingly and really pay attention to things like time between phases to have a chance. It's so different compared to almost every other killer and as a result she's pretty much the most fun.
---
Oh no, what gave it away
---
Oh damn didnt notice
---
Ive played killer and survivor for a long time, and in my humble and irrelevant opinion the game is definitely killer sided. It was survivor sided for quite a while, but I'd argue its not anymore. Unless you are playing against a full and decent swf or a freakishly good swf, which is the vast minority of games I've played; then the game is completely killer sided. As long as you know what you are doing at least. 
---
Before I took a long break from the game, I won pretty much every game I played as killer. Before I quit I was regularly playing the shittiest killers, and still getting 4k's.
---
That's hilarious.
---
El famoso good swf every match
---
Rank 1 isnt really an accomplishment anyway. Getting pips are too easy and there is no reward except longer queue times.
---
I played with the best Trapper yesterday. He chased me around a bit before I realized he wasn't going for the kill, so I goofed around with a locker in plain sight of him. Then he pointed me to one of his traps, let me get caught and escape. He hooked the other survivors right as the last gen was finishing. Then he downed me, but carried me to the hatch and let me escape. Love you Trapper &lt;3 I was playing Jeff and I think we were on one of the Autohaven Wreckers maps.
---
You‚Äôre speaking the language of the gods right now
---
What do you mean? There's a dwight in the background there too!
---
How could I have overlooked this!?
---
It's amazing! O.o
---
Hehe, please, waste your time typing on your computer some stupid insult, I know your type. I was like you until I learned to shut my fucking mouth.
---
Basically the equivalent of 'I don't want to be rude', completely writing off any responsibility when people call you out on your BS
---
Wtf is this image
---
I feel like survivor ranking needs a rework like what they did for killers. Since just playing the game as a survivor, even very badly usually results in a pip. Not to mention whenever rank reset comes around I feel like an asshole as killer for just playing how I normally would.
---
Prayer beads are bullshit yes. Spirit is strong yes.
---
I have plenty of fun playing against spirit and have escaped plenty of times. I personally dont think she is as op (or easy to play) as everyone likes to act. It just takes a different playstyle
---
Patch 1.8.3 is when the change got implemented. I believe we are in 3.3.0 right now.
---
&gt;And I actually can't afford a headset that's worth anything because hospital bills, so I can't track them during a blind.
---
Well yeah if you don't have the sound quality to track them then it becomes much more valuable to blind, that's true but it's more of a you problem in that situation. I hope everything is going well in the health department btw.
---
&gt;And is it much of a handicap for survivors if they're blinding a killer who can't deal with such?
---
It is, considering that the entire game has a lot of elements that demand you having a headset. Tracking footsteps, pained whines of injured survivors, tracking sounds of people working on generators, terror radius, etc. It is assumed that the killer has decent sound quality. That's one of the reasons this game isn't too friendly to deaf people, unfortunately.
---
&gt;And for addendum, I DID check the area around the combine, it's just that she was hiding in the Killer shack. She ran out to blind just as I started to come back up the combine to pick him up.
---
You just gotta be more careful.
---
Baby ghostface
---
Now all of china knows you are here, Dwight!
---
the dr should be able to use flashlights to give u eye exams. that would be a nice killer idea, one that has to do with using items, like where he can check chests himself, maybe there are extra chests around the map related to the killer
---
Oblivious takes him to a whole new level
---
Love the bill!
---
i think its when the skill check happens to be in the lower right section of the circle. u dont always catch it in time
---
I played trapper for probably half the time I've spent on killer. He is obviously not the best killer. He can absolutely demolish people at rank 1. The only team a competent trapper loses to is the same team that every other killer would lose to, besides nurse or spirit obviously.
---
Get those metal vocals on point. 
---
I actually dig this way more, demonic and angry than like sad and shrill. Awesome!!
---
Yeah I got in a game as killer where the survivors just sat in a row gesturing at me. I don't like farming either so I just slaughtered them all and they called me rude in the pg chat. I told them I thought it was rude to waste my long queue time on bullshit when I just wanna play the game and they called me a tryhard. Yep, I'm a tryhard for actually wanting to play. Lol.
---
I don‚Äôt mind spirit being strong, but I do mind how sometimes she just has very little counterplay. Billy/Huntress are both pretty strong and they‚Äôre easily the most fun to fight killers because of the outplays, mindgames, and counterplay on both sides of the chase. Even nurse can feel like that sometimes if you‚Äôre not playing against a REALLY good nurse, breaking LOS and making her miss her 2 blinks is a really good feeling. Spirit just doesn‚Äôt feel like that sometimes, especially with prayer beads. If you‚Äôre injured, 99% chance you‚Äôre dying on the next phase. If she‚Äôs got prayer beads, she hits you for free when you‚Äôre on a gen or just gen grabs you, and see above because now you‚Äôre injured. Pallets don‚Äôt do anything to her, bumping into her whilst she‚Äôs phasing is a guaranteed free hit, the standing still mindgame at a pallet is probably the only time you feel like you can outplay the spirit by calling her mindgame, and even then it‚Äôs not like billy or huntress level mindgames.
---
Thank you I appreciate it
---
Sounds very fitting for a horror game where the survivors should be scared of the killers /s
---
Nope. You're just seeing what you want to see. Ironically, you're the one who likes complaining.
---
Freddy is a good choice man I'm sure you'll have tons of fun with him
---
Ooh, you scare me. Not really, you're pathetic.
---
How affective is Iron Grip btw? I'm new. Just got it for Myers and I've been too chicken to really test how long I can hold them.
---
Spirit is shit because she's a top tier killer but also the easiest killer to get good at
---
So the reason we made it sound so blunt is to give the effect that it hits the bone. It's a bit gruesome, but adding that impact sound tells a bit deeper of a story. I suppose we could have added more of a a slicing sound behind it though. Appreciate the feedback!
---
Lmao you're such a hypocrite it's hilarious. You say I'm wasting my time by insulting, then you insult me. You say you know how to shut your fucking mouth, and yet you keep on trying to instigate a fight lmfao
---
I told you multiple times I'm not trying to argue with you. You are the one who is clearly taking pleasure from the delusion that you made people get all riled up. YOU are clearly projecting what you see in yourself (not knowing when to shut up, wanting to start arguments etc.) Onto other people. As I said, childish. This will be my last response to you little buddy. I hope your mom is restricting your internet time becuase ya know it's not good for your little developing brain to be in front of the screen all day. 
---
Have a nice day! I hope you learn how to get enjoyment out of life without trying to troll people!
---
I love it every time I see it
---
Take that wicked place out of here lol :3
---
Why is ruin and nurses both red?
---
Same here. Either they'll take pity and give me the hatch / exit gates, or they're able to take me to the basement (which they've deserved imo if I'm the last survivor left).
---
r/dbdgonewild would agree wholeheartedly.
---
Hey :) Thanks so much! Means a lot!   
---
Sidenote, those are his burps. He really needs to see a doctor.
---
Honestly this is standard stuff for rank 1-5 Freddy s,but it does feel amazing when it happens.
---
Once
---
Steve was running straight in a line and I teleported to the gen and bodyblocked him when he was trying to pass,and then 
---
He told me I spooked the crap out of him in the endgame chat.
---
Wonder how there's so many survivor videos on youtube about surviving 50+ matches in a row but almost none of the killer equivalent
---
I typically give hatch if I down the last guy real close to it or of I get my last hit because they got stuck on a wall or something. Unless they were a pain, then it's murder time
---
I just learned about it today. First pic I saw was a Michael that was more exposed than me after popping Haunted Ground
---
Ya see, I thought it was like that. But one time I stared down a Ghostface for a few seconds and I still got straight up exposed out of nowhere.
---
If they struggle, it means they still have fight left in them, so the entity ain't done with em yet. On the hook they go.
---
If they accept their fate, you need to give them some hope by dropping them on hatch, this way the entity can feed again.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
No, that's not it. She needs to become more difficult to get good at, but that's not how.
---
Underrated hilarious comment
---
I do that but for Hag.
---
I don't follow the disconnect on the left? Is she in plain clothes because she DC'd or
---
Every time I've played against a spirit and won or had fun it was because they were bad at the very least, or laughably bad. A competent spirit, or even an okay one with good add ons will absolutely demolish most teams. 80% of my time as survivor is solo, so she just destroys teams I'm on almost every time. Shes just overpowered. 
---
I actually stopped playing her because I felt bad for survivors after I played a few games against spirit. Getting a 4k doesn't feel good when winning took no skill or effort. Especially when I know for a fact that nobody enjoyed that game.
---
It was just an idea tbh. Something quickly though in my head. I think it makes sense.
---
Didn't laugh
---
I don't mind farming with survivors, but if the killer doesn't message me before hand, then I always assume they're in it to win.
---
Omegalol üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ shirtless Michael want to be ur friend
---
There is no counterplay to spirit unless you have iron will. If you do, then it's just flipping a coin. Either you live a little longer or you dont.
---
I don‚Äôt use it personally cuz it‚Äôs honestly kind of a shit perk, as you mentioned, you shouldn‚Äôt want all the gens to get done, but I don‚Äôt think there are any mental gymnastics involved in reaching my point of view. Totems are intended to be a secondary objective, but there would be no point in doing them if the constant threat of potential NOED didn‚Äôt exist, since there aren‚Äôt really any other perks that rely on uncleansed dull totems. This is why NOED exists in its current form, as incentive to do your secondary objective, or risk encountering NOED. Is it a crutch? Probably, but that‚Äôs a conversation for another time, either way I respect your opinion and appreciate the feedback
---
Theirs a perk for quick hiding making no noise or announcement.
---
thats an offering idea moreso than a perk
---
Ah but see, low-skilled survivor main.. kicking a gen not only protects a gen not only causes a gen to not be completed, but is a part of how our emblem system is tallied.
---
Throwing down a pallet just to throw down a pallet is not only moronic and low skilled, but it wastes the pallet from being used by people with actual skill - those that throw it down to stun the killer. Wasting a pallet should not be rewarded, it just actually deduct points from the survivor who does it.
---
And by the way, one perfect blink from the nurse takes more skill and practice in fact is more skillful than any action a survivor ever does. It is more skillful than hitting 4 skill checks in 80 seconds, jumping over a pallet, holding down 1 button to instaheal, standing near a pallet and dropping it, and holding down 1 button to cleanse a lit totem that is so easy to find that a child could, holding down one button to open the exit gate, or jumping into a hatch.
---
The most skillful thing a survivor does is looping. So forgive me if I don't roll my fucking eyes at any survivor main who makes the absurd request that any survivor be award the same amount of points as someone who needs to hunt four people, constantly be on the move, constantly use their powers, constantly mind game, with worse perks. 
---
I'm sorry that you, who can get items for free through fucking chests and get to keep said items if you escape, don't get as much points as the side that can never find a free item in a locker or a chest and must always spend points to bring shit in.
---
I'm sorry that your side, which gets to team up together, shouldn't get as many points as the killer who is ALWAYS solo.
---
Actually.. I'm not sorry, because truth is truth. No survivor deserves as many points as a killer. We do four times as much work. You already get too many points for doing too little right now. It definitely shouldn't get buffed.
---
If the devs give you secondary objectives, then you should get more points. Until then, no.
---
1h 40m from my reply. :)
---
Just know that when I play Myers, I enjoy stalking and scaring you more than actually hooking you. Because then I can't stalk and scare you anymore.
---
I disagree, getting to rank 1 is hard now and it's hard for the wrong reasons. Players like me, who play hoth sides and can only play over the weekends, never have a chance to reach rank 1 before rank reset and it's so damn annoying. I want to get all achievments but ever since the pip rework, I can't get past rank 3 survivor.
---
Rank is, more than ever, an indication of how much you played the past month and not an indication of skill
---
This happened to me when I tried to give the last remaining survivor hatch, but right as I drop her in front of it she runs away. I had no choice but to hook her at that point.
---
I had 3 survs dc against me when I played clown for my daily...
---
99% of the time I miss them it‚Äôs because my connection is different than last game and I am trying to hit greats. Unless I‚Äôm playing drunk. Then I miss 99% of them.
---
Sorry I know it‚Äôs your opinion but adrenaline op?

Turn off post game chat or messaging on Xbox.   Please stay wholesome
---
It‚Äôs the pant-less variety that give me the heebie-jeebies
---
I mean it's not the most fair addon, if you're just in the open like that you're dead
---
Well yea
---
Guessing isnt a counter. It's even more bullshit when she runs into you without knowing where you are, which gives her a free hit without doing anything at all.
---
If you think getting a 4k at rank 1 with any killer (including spirit!) Takes no skill or effort then I dont even know if we are talking about the same game.
---
I have agreed with you multiple times that spirit is strong (maybe even op!) So I'm not sure what else I can say besides I'm not sure you get my point. I fully admit spirit is one of the strongest killers. My only point is that she does in fact take skill to play well, and there is also counterplay to her (just like nurse who is even stronger) 
---
Let me be perfectly clear when I say that does not mean I dont think she is very strong. I do. But i also think that only her addons need looking at. Base spirit is strong but fair imo.
---
are you talking about the yumahadaquefunhayisuhmashodomidashionkadafungsuhuahapdoupranduuyungnighafunposhspritfadschuata‚Äôs crest
---
The 1000 Boldness and Inner Strength being a perk should be incentive enough.
---
And even then Thrill Of The Hunt exists for making Survivors actually go touching dull bones.
---
Spirit is apparently fine, yet:
---
- Phases passively, causing small loops to be  easily 'mindgamed'. Skill: None
---
- No animation when vaulting. Skill: None
---
- Can hit into players whilst phasing, causing their position to be exposed. Skill: None
---
- Can't be flashed or is very hard to flash when vaulting: Skill: None.
---
- Literally has mind game potential from afking. Skill: None.
---
That's a lot of things the spirit gets for free.  I haven't even mentioned how broken her base kit is and all you need is a bit of practise and good headphones.
---
Spirit players shouldn't have a surprised pikachu face when players DC. Especially if they are using a Mori and add-ons.
---
No I played plenty of her. I played her a lot for a month or two after she came out. She was totally busted. After I eventually played against her as survivor I just stopped playing her. I legitimately felt bad for the people I was playing against. People constantly dc'd. My memory isn't perfect, but I'm pretty sure somebody got out through the exit gates in 1 or 2 games I played. She was totally busted, and it took no effort or skill to demolish literally any team I played against. 
---
I understand exactly how and why she is overpowered. I figured out the pallet mindgame the day she was released on ptb. It was that simple, and it works perfectly almost every time, to this day.
---
Maybe add "survivors cleanse totems 200% faster"
---
Flair checks out.
---
so it takes longer for him to stalk normally than a survivor to stalk him back, but, if he breaks LoS so it stops, he doesn't lose progress, but you do.  So if he had stalked you at some other point on the match, he can have a fast one.
---
i use borrowed time, were gonna live forever, bind, and deliverance
---
This is one thing I only recently began to understand. 
---
I would have games as killer where I hooked and killed all 4 survivors and would only get a black pip, then I would have games where I maybe only hooked and killed 2 survivors and I pipped.
---
Then I would have games as survivor where I would escape and black pip, and games where I died but managed to get enough objectives done and altruistic actions that I pipped.
---
When you first being playing the game you think your objective is to, at all costs:
---
Escape when playing as survivor
---
Kill as many survivors as possible with killer
---
In reality that is not how the game is supposed to be played in order to rank up and get a decent amount of bloodpoints.
---
Yeah, its not like survivors make sound, has collision, makes grass move, has scratch marks and when injured makes even louder sounds.
---
Guessing is a counter tho lol if you guess right you win. If not she wins. Is it a great counter? No. Neither is trying to juke a nurse. Could it work? Yes. Is that the definition of a counter? Yes.
---
Counters dont have to be sure things.
---
Oh okay. Ty
---
 having any heath state progress on survivors go up one and them getting 150% speed boost making ur chase with them a complete waste of time is what I call pretty op. Imagine if getting a good skill check on ruin just made the gen go back down to 0%, you were doing it al that time and one slip and you've just wasted ur time
---
You need a high IQ to understand this image
---
How did you get live footage of me learning Ghostface? monkaS
---
But that aint a hex tho.
---
lol is that the doctor with other doctors? how do u know if theyre also killers
---
No,really no,him Removing his mask wouldn‚Äôt work. 
---
Maybe a Randy Meeks-style kill with the cold blooded stabs?
---
It‚Äôll look amazing. There‚Äôs your answer
---
Imagine a trapper that didn‚Äôt run NOED... üòÇ
---
Noob3 uses swf in the video, all the best tools and add ons, and his friend even dc'd to give him hatch once or twice. Which is essentially cheating. He only got to 30 or something up to that point. This is not even mentioning the fact that he has thousands of hours in the game. 95% of survivors aren't half as good as he is. I don't think I've escaped more than maybe 7 times in a row.
---
I imagine this is what it was like to lose your job back in the day. Stop putting food on the table, and daddy becomes the food on the table.
---
From what I've heard, yes
---
Incorrect, the general consensus is that she‚Äôs strong but fair (excluding add ons) or it was until recently for some reason
---
Wish all killers were in the billy/ spirit power level
---
It's kind of crazy how there's over 70 survivor perks and only about 10 are frequently used.
---
Jesus. I've been playing since 1.0.0. and I never noticed that change. 3 thousand hours and i'm stupid enough for that.
---
Yes but I‚Äôm your scenario that one skill check AHS a chance of going off multiple times. Adrenaline happens once and it‚Äôs not like NOED since NOED you can keep benefiting from it in the endgame. 
---
It‚Äôs strong sure and can give survivors some wins but i don‚Äôt see it as op.
---
Oh fair. Guess I'm starting a metal band then.   
---
Yeah that would be very cool! I know games like League of Legends have done this in the past on a marketplace. But we're really mostly doing this for the learning experience for others I'd say.
---
Trapper isnt good, no one said that. But at least you can do really good with him if you're experienced and know what you're doing, while spirit takes a few games and you'll destroy everything in your way.
---
THAT WOULD BE GREAT! I REALLY NEED TO GET BETTER AT LOOPING! 
---
AND I AGREE ABOUT THE SYSTEM...I WAS RANK 18 KILLER AFTER THE RESET AND BEING MATCHED WITH RANK 8-14 SURVIVORS....VERY UNEVEN AND OF COURSE I STRUGGLED!
---
is there a problem sir?
---
Blame the devs for not buffing and reworking as often as they should...
---
That's just huntress with extra steps
---
there is some merch that represent the in game ones and that's good, but honestly, turning their cosmetics into a clothing line is actually a not so bad idea.
---
With how the meta has changed, this game had done a full 180 on that
---
Ghostface above Myers and Hag?
---
The offering is a picture of all the legion members
---
Otzdarva and Goose mate.
---
i have nooooo idea what that is about. im looking forward to the halloween event on tuesday, but the rift will likely be a huge plus to extend the daily fun of the game. sounds to me like its a bunch of daily rituals that u can do all the time. still unsure about 99% of it though, like what premium is good for. is it one $10 payment thats good forever, or just for 70 days at a time, for example. that would be way too expensive a subscription, as it'd be ~$100 a year just for 1 game, even if it is this game. especially for me since i already have all killers maxed out, and i only use kate
---
That‚Äôs the Legion
---
Hmm..Gens were rusty and you had a cut.
---
Case solved
---
They are many instances where subreddits like to jump on bandwagons, but this is not one of them. Prayer beads Spirit is indeed a genuine problem in the game and needs to be addressed. Nurse and insta heal fixes were much needed and behavior took the correct steps to bring them in line.
---
I can get all 4 Legions, a Billy, a Huntress, a Clown, and a Spirit all in a game with me
---
:)
---
I don't bother running ruin, if the survivors want to Gen rush, let them. Simply deny them any evader or altruism points to show them that there's more to the game than genrushing. (if you don't give them any players to heal and avoid them to deny evader; at green ranks and higher they won't have enough emblem score to pip even with iridescent lightbringer (which they likely won't get due to the gens being split between 4 of them)  and iridescent unbroken (will get if you do this) and since they get bronze benevolent by default they only end up getting 9 out of the 10 emblem points they need to pip)
---
bro wtf I bet you don‚Äôt even have it at 3
---
you have the most fucking annoying post titles, always whining about "slandering."
---
go outside
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs good until you can get agitation
---
Dude just wanna say you're absolutely right in everything, you should've ignored this guy when he challenged you to "play without addons reee". This guy is a clown like all killermains just leave him be.
---
It‚Äôs nurse
---
what if it wasnt? o.o
---
Ok sorry you're right only your opinion matters becuase you are always right and everyone else is an idiot.
---
I watch People with 1000s of hours who are playing against survivors with 1000s of hours, both sides are incredible and both sides successfully mindgame. Yes even the survivors facing the spirit. I literally see it happen in streams of people that are amazing at playing killer (like top 1% otz is a fucking monster dude) and they get tricked. So if you are saying they are trash or that their opinion doesn't matter then I'm honestly done wasting my time trying to talk to you.
---
And yes people play at rank 1 with no addons lol otz, fungoose, lots of amazing killers can do it. Hell I play freddy at rank 1 with no addons since most of his are shit and I do well.
---
Anyways I'm done. Have a nice day.
---
Do you are have stupid
---
You dropped this /s, I picked it up for ya
---
God i hate playing against a spirit there‚Äôs no mind games it‚Äôs just a guessing game
---
He's literally the guy that did the 50 escapes in a row video though.

---
To answer some common questions:
---
&gt; "Are you / when are you going to do X killer?"
---
Yes, I'm planning to do all of them, including Demogorgan and whoever else gets revealed. I don't have them planned out in terms of when I'm doing which killer - just kinda of letting it happen.
---
&gt; "Are you going to do the survivors?"
---
No. I did Dwight because he's my boy (and I wanted to do a pizzagram), but generally speaking the survivors aren't as visually interesting and they don't have the sort of strong iconography that makes doing the killers engaging from a design perspective. Oh, and also I'm shit at doing faces (as you can see with my Dwight). And no technology exists capable of making colors bright enough to accurately depict like 98% of Min's outfits. 
---
&gt; "Can I use this design for a tattoo?"
---
My stance on tattoo design is to contact me via DM and we can hash out the details but, generally, yeah, I'm cool with that.
---
&gt; What equipment/apps do you use?
---
Most of the work is done in Procreate on an ipad / apple pencil combo with some occasional photoshop involved. 
---
&gt; What else do you work on?
---
Quite a bit - I'm also working on hashing out a [Fallout series](https://i.imgur.com/OjxZuoT.jpg) similar to this one, working on two seperate sets of tarot cards (one based on my [own designs](https://i.imgur.com/kwbBgl2.jpg) and one based on [hiphop / rap artists](https://i.imgur.com/Fky8eva.jpg)), regularly doing pieces based on Ari Aster's films [Hereditary](https://i.imgur.com/bm1gcmO.jpg) and [Midsommar](https://i.imgur.com/Vf5PIhP.jpg), and I'm also a [nightscape photographer](https://www.instagram.com/davecarender/)... so I stay busy.

Also, Hope is really good.

I dont even main killer I'm like 60/40 survivor.
---
He literally said she was OP even without addons. I was responding to that. If she is OP without addons then you could 4k at rank 1. But even you guys say that is laughable. Soooo then you agree with me that she is not OP even without addons? Lamo
---
Cool glad we can agree.

I tried checking all the settings in Nvidia control panel but it doesn't seem to have anything for motion blur. :/

Its hardly OP, it exhausts you on top of only activating if you power the gens.

---
This happened the other day. One survivor DC‚Äôed and the two other survivors killed themselves on first hook, so I felt bad for last survivor remaining. I found him,  picked him up, and was bringing him to the hatch when he wiggled off. I found him hiding. Second time I picked him up I finally brought him to hatch. He wiggled off again, but falls on top of OPEN hatch and still runs away. So I closed the hatch and watched him die from the entity bc he was too afraid to open the door.
---
It's just that emblems right now are incredibly shit. You literally get penalized if anyone other than you does poorly.
---
Survivor right now is particularly egregious since unhooking like one or two people gets you Iridescent Benevolent. If you farm people with Borrowed Time you can still get the safe unhook even if your teammate still dies after you unhook them.
---
Same. I just accept my fate, regardless of what that becomes
---
I acknowledge that otz is a monster. But when you watch youtubers, you are seeing highlights of their gameplay, or especially entertaining games. Highlights of survivors kicking the shit out of Otz or vice versa doesn't really represent average gameplay. I mention my experience because I'd argue it represents average gameplay. Maybe some mlg epic gamer squad swf team brutalized Otz as spirit, but thats not even 1 in 10,000 games. 
---
Nobody successfully bullied me a single time that I've played spirit. And thats not because im a superhuman epic gamer. Its because spirit is fucking busted.
---
Nah, Herman liked torturing and eventually killing people. He did all his ‚Äúresearch‚Äù willingly and actively pursued it, burning through prisoners.
---
I think somebody got a bit angry there. Insulting people doesn't really help your case at all, you know that right?
---
Had a freddy before his rework do this for a friend.

Sadly though, he was running a slow down build and refused to let my friend out of the dream world.

Did she just assume the bush's gender?

I can second that.
---
Yeah cause all the lazy killers left nurse and billy and finally saw how easy spirit is lol. Mained her when she first came out. I'm amazed it took this long to see every killer start playing spirit.
---
GeForce experience instant replay ;)
---
Is everyone escaping with you? Getting the hatch a lot doesn't really make the game survivor favored. Most of my time as survivor is solo, and usually at least 2 people die.
---
I definetly don't see her as easy, maybe that's just me
---
is this some r34 build up?

I will join you on this crusade. She's so cute like a fairy! I only wish Addiris would get some better outfits. All of her ones carry the same fashion.
---
I ain't letting the last one get the hatch
---
Make so survivors hooked in the basement get ten seconds in each phase
---
I feel like "Roasts the kid back" should be its own category, and I see Ace and Nea falling into it more than their respective categories.
---
I hate being *torchured* too :(
---
This is adorable! But sad when you imagine the RAINBOW WORLD kids live inüò©
---
That's true I was using a strategy where I was guarding the 4 gens closest to the ruin totem in Hope's they would 3 gen themselves, but it's not camping still
---
Thanks, that really helped push me away
---
It makes perfect sense. Spirit phases around things, not through them like nurse. I think a better option would be to nerf her activation time. Its the one time shes stuck and blind. The one time you can really juke her. That and her vaccuum sound is too quiet and too late for any survivor to get away and hide.
---
Video Tape, Last Will, Bag/Crate of Gears, Tampered Timer, and Rule Set No. 2 are great. Combat Straps, John's Medical File, Jigsaw's Annotated Plan, Jigsaw's Sketch, Amanda's Letter are...okay. Rest are garbage
---
Haha, I have done that too. It's easily disorienting.
---
She's alot like the nurse, theres not much counterplay against a good spirit.

Well ash goes both ways lol. He mostly roasts himself lol.
---
Nah definitly not laughable but your dumbass request and thinking that would somehow prove anything is laughable. There's a reason I spoke directly to the other guy, I hoped you wouldn't notice, I really have no interest in talking to anyone who claims spirit is fine, not even about something unrelated that you're an expert on, no thanks, I'll take my chances with the other guys who aren't moronic enough to think spirit is "fine as is" or whatever other dumbfuckery you spewed off.
---
Yes, Dead Before Sunrise.
---
He probably gets stream sniped a lot then. I still don't think these twitch streamers getting railed by 4 man swf is representative of average gameplay. I've have rounds where I get fucking demolished, but they are literally maybe 1 in 500 games. And 90% of them happened when I was a beginner. 
---
What spirit is able to easily do to 90% of people playing this game isn't fair to any of those people. She should at least have her ad ons nerfed, and you should be able to tell when shes phasing and just standing still. That mind game is just way to easy.
---
Somebody probably jumped out of the locker next to you with Head On

How do you add that title you have !(I‚Äôm on mobile)
---
I didn't even notice it there or hear it open
---
Yet you defend spirit who barely goes *against* any mind games or counterplay to phase successfully. survivors are far more blind than the spirit is. Something needs reworking.

They only bleed if injured, and a lot of maps make blood hard to see. Scraych marks dont show when they dont run. She'd just be a legion but worse in every aspect except that hits actually down people.

I cackled at this. üòÇ
---
Wasn't de-pip squad back when the game was incredibly survivor favored? I think that was when there was still infinite's in the game. 
---
Also, 1 survivor escaping many times doesn't really matter. That's a single persons achievement. The vast majority of people probably haven't escaped anywhere near that many times in a row. The reason those videos get a lot of views is because them escaping so many times in a row is exceptional. Those videos wouldn't get hundreds of thousands of views if escaping 50 times in a row isn't something only a handful of people have done.
---
As someone else put it. Use it till you get Agitation as its better than Iron Grasp for some small but significant reasons.
---
That movement speed does a lot more than you think. You can get to hooks faster which saves time (if you don't know the significance of time, play Huntress without Ruin if you want to torture yourself), and it helps you get hits when you've a survivor on your back that you normally wouldn't have gotten.
---
The reason for this is that all killers move at the same speed with a survivor on their back (so the slowest Killer, ie Nurse. Moves just as fast as your Myers), with Agitation you're gonna be getting hits that wouldn't be possible without it. 
---
Here's a good video explaining Agitations effectiveness at times https://youtu.be/YH5kzfYp5bc

I should also clear something up before this goes up in flames: the things listed are just things I see mostly talked about in terms of complaints. Just thought I would add them there. Don't get me wrong: I have my moments where I question how this Myers somehow hit me through a pallet even though it's clearly down but I love this community a ton. You're all amazing people and I hope to see more of you in the fog.
---
Seriously... why do they have knives?
---
And if you open a locker, you get a free mori
---
I like how you wrote BBQ and not Leatherface because nobody buys the DLC for the character :D.
---
Because what would sometimes happen is that survivors would think that they wiggled free on their own and then t-bag me before taking the hatch. And I don't want to want to give the hatch to toxic survivors. When they don't try to wiggle, I know that they won't t-bag and sent me bullshit messages with "EZ noob"
---
Are you swf though? Because almost all my time is solo. I've played a lot at every rank, and I've always performed decently, but people die most games.
---
you can actually pip without killing anyone if you are good enough. Depends of the difference of skill between you and the survivor team.
---
its any daily that can be done with any survivor, you will never keep them
---
I accept the drunk excuse. In the same boat. Was a tad tipsy the other night, missed a check (ONE out of many) and the Steve pointed at me to leave the gen. ‚òπÔ∏è

---
Holy lord, this is your best design yet spectacular composition and great use of color
---
Do they cancel each other out if both killer and survivor brings own? Stacks for survivor?
---
Not a chainsaw
---
See I disagree. I think that player who has been around for events earned that skin. The devs making them available to buy defeats the purpose of the event. Truly sorry someone wasnt aroung for an event, but making event cosmetics available to everyone is kind of a huge middle finger to the people who have been playing for years.
---
Is this even possible?
---
I dunno, for billy with the sweet feet its already too much. Maybe could do it as an add on for low mobility killers like doc, legion etc

---
Now this is the art I would like to on here all the time
---
In real life, I meant.
---
Its unreasonable to expect that everyone always run spine chill to counter the possibility of running into just one build for just one killer. Spine chill is simply not necessary against most killers.
---
I love Bubba, but ya.
---
Some survivors just need to put down. It's a mercy really.
---
Free points i guess
---
I dont think you should get visual information about her location while shes phasing. Just knowing when shes phasing would be a good change already.
---
Oh. I see. Thanks!
---
Why do you think it's a bad idea?
---
&gt; the easiest killer to get good at
---
she isn't. being good at her requires a good knowledge of looping mechanics, mindgaming, and the structure of each level, which constantly changes. and this is because once she uses her power, her objective becomes literally invisible. on top of that, she gets much weaker if the survivors use spine chill, which is one of the best perks that works great universally against all killers; hell, even Myers is losing his immunity to it in the next update.
---
I can‚Äôt get myself to grind survivor because WGLF isn‚Äôt as good as BBQ
---
I usually let survivors go, but if they‚Äôre taking too long I‚Äôll do us all a favor.
---
Oops i didnt mean it like that. You wont see her where she is when she phases. Her husk will phase in and out
---
Ghost Face is the only killer to make me rage when I play survivor against him, because the dude will be cloaked, standing out completely in the open, so I will also walk out in the open and point my camera directly at him... and it never breaks him out of stalk mode.
---
Is he bugged? Is this due to an add-on of his? 
---
Even if it's not a bug, it *feels* bugged.
---

---
Baby Claudette : *run vaults*
---
Steve : Why did you do that?
---
Spirit is balanced. just because she's strong doesnt mean she's unbalanced.
---
What was that?  Billy‚Äôs chainsaw can be countered by vaulting a window?  Or dropping a pallet?  Or rounding a corner?  Or literally just stepping left or right?
---
Also, his chainsaw has a cooldown of 2 seconds whether he hits an object or just stops mid-run.  2 seconds isn‚Äôt long, but it‚Äôs long enough to make distance and engage in at least some of the counterplay i mentioned above.  
---
Billy is strong, but he‚Äôs not OP and he‚Äôs definitely not as powerful as the spirit or even post-nerf nurse.  If you think he is, you just need to get better at loops.
---
Yeah I like to let them know I'm in control. I let them live.
---
Wouln't that kill some of the spirit mindgames?
---
WHy not just remove her beads and that's it?
---
That will completely kill her mind game potential

What's wrong with bills achievement? I got it first game. If we're talking about adept trophies then plague would be the hardest there I think

Maybe. It needs some tweaking definitely

That‚Äôs better. Agreed with all the others too. And if removing Prayer Beads cannot be done, then make them Ultra Rare.

You are not a bad person. It‚Äôs your job to kill them to begin with, if you decide to take mercy and then that changes, nothing has really changed, especially in the eyes of the survivor. Who‚Äôs probably salty anyway

tbh i can agree with that. Thank god only 5% of 4man are depip squads
---
Are you saying I get to kill people and get away with it? Invite me!
---
&gt; No
---
that wasn't a question
---
Incidentally, Spirit can also be countered by dropping a pallet or vaulting a window. 
---
Her power has a cool down of much longer than 2 seconds. If we're talking about the level of competence where Billy is still running into walls, then yes, every killer is garbage because that's how rank 20 works.
---
I'll also quietly ignore the non-damage utility of his chainsaw. For the sake of this comparison.
---
If a Spirit out-mindgames you, you get hit. If a Billy out-mindgames you, you get downed.
---
Her passive phasing is too cool to remove
---
When you get a steamer and half their team rage quits before a single gen was done so you let the streamer get hatch
---
i can agree with that, keys are bullshit but i don't think they are ebony mori levels of bullshit. Just remove them both from the game
---
Yeah my point in terms of the mental gymnastics argument is the fact that the killer running it is completely disavowing the fact that they conceded defeat pre-lobby that they aren't capable or likely to end the game with gens up by equipping it in the first place.  They're essentially hedging their bets and using it as a safety blanket to fall back on when they lose the gens they're likely to lose since those that run this perk tend to not pressure the gens much anyways.  Totems may be a secondary pseudo-objective due to NOED.  But Gens are referred to as core objectives to protect as killer.  So in gameplanning to lose them they are in fact playing unoptimally hence the crutch association earlier.
---
I agree about the totems only having meaning from its existence though and am glad NOED exists because it creates something else to care about other than solely gens.  I hope the devs continue creating more perks like Inner Strength to encourage more people to care about them if for no other reason than to help slow the game down a little bit for killers.  I also am glad it exists because it was designed for newer and more casual killers at Yellow and Green ranks and I think they should have NOED available so they can still get kills while learning the basics of the role in a largely stress free environment since it doesn't matter that they aren't pressuring gens.  
---
Basically I don't want to see it nerfed or removed just acknowledged for being what it is lol.  It's the players that try to frame it as something other than the massive crutch it is that drive me mad lol.  The ones that want to run it and feel like they're good killers while doing so.  They can have one or the other but not both.  And thanks for participating in a civil discussion on the matter.
---
So much salty tantrum throwing over Spirit in this thread and others. 
---
"I HATE SPIRIT, SHE'S JUST A GUESSING GAME, THERE'S NO MIND GAMES AT ALL"
---
Mind games by their definition are a 50/50. You're making plays based on what you think the killer will do and are rewarded if you guess right, and get hit if you guess wrong. Loop a jungle gym in a non-standard route in order to try and shake the killer and get to the next one without using the pallet?  If you make the right reads you've just wasted the killers time and preserved a pallet. If you've guessed wrong now you've probably handed yourself to the killer.
---
Survivors just hate that with Spirit it's ACTUALLY a 50/50 chance in most scenarios. They don't want mind games, they want to be super safe with the red stain and long loops and no surprises. 
---
People get mad at the Spirit because it makes them feel like idiots when they make shitty decisions and they get punished for it. They'll bluster and yell about how they enjoy the chase/the mind games/the whatever of DBD but give them a killer that is entirely about that and threatens their precious 'Loop 2-3 times then slam pallet' pattern and most players just lose their shit because they don't know how to play any other way.
---
I sometimes have this problem with everything on PS4 but only after I have the game open for an extended period of time, like after about 3 hours give or take when I lunge as Miller my frames will drop immensely and it‚Äôs almost impossible to get hits and same goes for survivors with vaults, skill checks, getting smacked, and always ALWAYS anything that increases your movement speed which is why the lunge is so laggy. Idk maybe it‚Äôs just me but after I restart my game it‚Äôs back to normal.
---
This is factual the second that mother fucker starts wiggling it‚Äôs game over
---
Did they buff spirit, or are people just now starting to figure out how strong she is. I can't recall there being all this spirit hate like 3 months ago.
---
I do enjoy playing killer with the guitar hero controller üòÇ
---
Oh yeah, I get that.
---
How are those different?  Guessing what the other person will do is what a mind game is.
---
that‚Äôs a fucking mood.
---
I hope I see this on the next shrinewatch!
---
A SIDE NOTE: PLEASE STOP SLUGGING THE 2ND TO LAST SURVIVOR TO SECURE THE 4K. IT‚ÄôS ONLY GOING TO LEAD TO FRUSTRATION FOR BOTH SIDES
---
Key.  Completely disregards the main objective to escape instantly.  Syringe is temporary
---
The key and it isn't even close.  Those things are pure cheese and you can expect to face an absurd amount of them once you hit red ranks.  Only takes 3 gens to get 2 players out.  Once you've killed a couple they quit repairing gens period and just look together for it lol.  You can run Franklin's (it's only counter) but they'll often pick it back up later or send one of their friends to grab it for them.  Keys are basically the survivors mori.
---
This shit is gonna spice things up a lot I‚Äôm super excited I finally have something to be able to work towards and get rewarded for it
---
I would like to upvote this into the sky
---
I think a lot of people probably get Billy's that rely on backrevving with instasaw addons, which if we're honest isn't that hard to do well with. Once you start learning curves and cross-map snipes the game completely changes and some survs will respect you once they realize you know your shit. I had one give me props for sniping him around a corner on Hawkins of all places because he also plays Billy and knew how hard I was working to not just be an M1 killer on that map
---
killer instinct and the visual that points in the direction of the survivor exposing you is super buggy 80 percent of the time on Ghost. not reliable at all
---
Nope. Randoms.
---
Take a hook near survivor to protect another survivor 250 times?? I would try not to get hit lol
---
They‚Äôll ‚Äúescape‚Äù into the upside down
---
THERE SHOULD ALSO BE TOGGLES FOR WORKING ON GENS, SPRINTING, AND CROUCHING. THIS WOULD MAKE THIS GAME MORE ACCESSIBLE.
---
I‚Äôm a simple man, I see Thanos I upvote
---
Why would it be? Does he show fan content or something?
---
Key, Syringe is getting nerfed and map is useless once you learn spawn locations
---
I run the obnoxious skillcheck build.
---
(Unnerving presence, Overcharge, Hex: Huntress's Lullaby, and Distressing.)
---
It doesn't stop that first, and sometimes second gen from popping. But after that, the map is mine, and no one gets ANYTHING done.
---
Depending on your situation a key could save you in the end game when is the killer slugging but a toolbox could help your team gen rush  and a med kit with the syringe could pick up down teammate that‚Äôs on death hook And a flashlight can help in immense ways but are very hard to work with
---
You learn and guess.  You gather that data in each individual match.  This is how literally all multiplayer games work.  Most smart survivors just leave when she stands still at a pallet.  It‚Äôs fairly obvious what she‚Äôs going for.
---
This is my problem with Ghostface. The game is so inconsistent with when it wants to reveal him. I mean he should have been revealed a lot sooner but it only does it when she‚Äôs literally touching him. Makes sense.
---
Its probably impossible to complete the entire thing without paying. Kind of like fortnite how they limit the missions u get
---
Yeah the fun ended shortly after that escape..
---
Just leave the loop 4Head.
---
This is awesome, I think ive seen a couple of your other works. Cant wait to see a Freddy
---
Holy fuck he is a genius, he might be smarter than the Ugandan Knuckles meme
---
Purple üî¶ ofc
---
the ultimate shitpost
---
Yeah I do the same thing in terms of going easy on them when I can tell the dudes have no business being matched in a lobby with me.  I don't pretend they outplayed me though.  For instance I was playing a no addon Spirit game last night and they didn't pop a single gen.  Obsession ragequit the moment they were downed.  I ran into the same Claudette randomly for what would have been her death hook and just shared at her a few seconds and walked away lol.  I'll play nice and give additional chances but I still want them to know it too lol.
---
Very true on both fronts.
---
I remember seeing an old video where there were 10 people or so in a public match.
---
you don't have to justify yourself to me. you are an open book. I and others don't really mind how you manage yourself. You got your truth, do what you want with it. Like every one.
---
You jest, but if you start to and she‚Äôs standing still she will either move to follow you and you can go right back to the loop or she is phasing and you can try and lose her with jukes or getting to another loop.  It‚Äôs entirely doable.
---
I believe main DBD and all DLC aside from Stranger Things is in the same universe. I only exclude ST as Halloween is a movie referenced in the show.
---
I would agree with your Nurse statement as survivor but not so much the Spirit one. I know there *is* counterplay technically but it just feels like a guessing game where you have a 50% of getting hit nearly every time. Yes it's scary to play against which I guess should be how Killers feel, but it just feels unfair.
---
Maybe once I get Lithe my opinion will change
---
Depends on how you define winning and how effectively you use the item. Syringes can save 32 seconds for two people, which is the most efficient item in the game for total time saving in a 4-man escape, but a key let's you "win" regardless of team circumstances or who finds hatch first.
---
DON‚ÄôT WORRY I HAVE A HEARING AID:
---
‚ÄúI DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND UR REPLY? R U MAKING FUN OF MY RESPONSE?‚Äù
---
Only on consoles I think :'(
---
Not free on PC
---
I only kill the last survivor if he struggles or doesn't want to leave. Especially if it's baby Dweet or someone like that. Those scared puppy eyes and body shaking by fright.. You just simply can't...
---
My vote is for the key. Because some games are able to be salvaged as a killer even with 1 generator left, but not if someone just can use an item to end the game right there for the last 3 survivors.
---
I like your version lot better than the fake japanese movie sounds game used. Also loved how you made spirit actually sound like a tormented spirit and not a water pump.
---
They made her T H I C C lol
---
...yeah? Have you never seen the memes and other community content he puts at the start of shrine watch?
---
As a pretty low level player myself, I'd have to go with map, just for the awareness and the extra BP it gives. After that, though, I'd definitely say the key.
---
Sound is easier to follow than blood.
---
Just buy a pair of decent headphones and it will open up a new world for you - I used to play this game on speakers before I realised how important sound is. I can hear myer's breathing, ghostface's robes when he walks, wraith's footsteps... All these little things add up to awareness.
---
if we refer to her name she's technically a Spirit, not a zombi
---
Definitely read it in his voice.
---
Neaaaa leave the poor banker alone
---
I always wiggle because I have pride. I don't want to be given the win if I didn't earn it and although it's nice of the killer to consider it in the first place, I don't want to be hooked when thinking that they were going to give me the hatch and not doing anything about it.
---
Hooking the last killer in the basement? It doesn't.
---
Head on‚Äôd
---
Trust me survivors now are the least scary they have ever been. The meta didn‚Äôt change that, the killers have never been the scary ones.
---
Dying Light should be at least B tier,
---
Wow I checked out your other ones and they are amazing, love how you incorporated the adding in the design.
---
I only watch him a handful of times.
---
damn that leatherface looks good
---
Re read that
---
I would but it‚Äôs my own rule I hate being tunneled and know what it‚Äôs like and I just find tunneling scummy
---
I recently had a horrible plague game filled with toxic survive w/ friends and I was expecting a gg baby killer but the last survivor couldn't escape cause of the glitch so I knocked him down and carried him across the map to hatch and he said sorry I stabbed you with DS thank you
---
Kill them w/ kindness
---
I've never seen a toxic Ash, Jane or Adam. probably just lucky lol
---
Most likely Thoe I spend mine on shrine for blood points
---
What made you decide that Franklin's is an S tier perk?
---
As killer I only ever do that at the end of a game where it‚Äôs one person left. Otherwise I play it pretty straight forward.
---
Hey, I can‚Äôt say I agree but there is honor in what you do and I appreciate that.
---
I get super annoyed.. Since I am not the person to rage quit I just pick the most annoying Claudette and hook her and camp... 
---
And later hate myself for it.
---
But this is "OC, do not steal Ghostface" the Scream movies are technically separate
---
Ahh shit here we go again....
---
Ghostface reveal be like *functional mechanic noises*
---
Wait, really? This Ghostface isn‚Äôt a part of the Scream franchise? Huh. 
---
Never mind then.
---
one does not simply be a daddy tho
---
cuz sometimes I can get a nice hit if they decide to go back for their item or if they try to pick it back up in a chase
---
Not unless you let them see you pass hooks. I struggle unless they go pass hooks or I notice them not going to a basement spot.
---
Those speed boosts don‚Äôt double up, so it‚Äôs a wasted Lithe.
---
Technically as I made a similar comment she‚Äôs from university
---
Me - *Juggles last survivor next to a Gen so they can work on it*
---
Survivor - "This has to be a trick."
---
I'm on Xbox and I've heard if you get enough people reporting you it will effect your reputation and give you an "Avoid me" tag under your gamertag :/
---
I‚Äôve made a little moral code for myself to never camp or tunnel despite the circumstances cause I know what that‚Äôs like and I hate it absolutely fuckin despise it but that‚Äôs just me
---
Don‚Äôt worry about that part
---
~~I know, I was referencing~~ [~~Ghostface when he was introduced to the Hookers~~](https://youtu.be/ma8FDWXHIsM?t=181)

We don‚Äôt deserve people like you. Thank you.
---
Yes, this has to be it!  I might give it a try myself sometime haha
---
Oh, we had a game like this against a hag! The Steve actually protect my friend and me through the whole game! I just wish we could have saved him at the end, but the hag had NOED and I found it too late :(
---
Sorry, but what is passive phasing? I've never understood that.
---
Also, they really should add some kind of sign that she's phasing, so dumb that doesn't exist yet.
---
I'll show myself out thanks....*death sounds echo into the hatch*
---
Nice repost.
---
You no longer double de-pip for d/c'ing. They removed as people were using it to rapidly derank themselves.
---
It has to be the 12th full moon on a Saturday.*
---
It's why it's the Ghostface and not the Scream chapter. The mask itself is a separate license and it was probably too problematic to get both and divide the royalties.
---
I get and respect that, but I belive there should be a fair game from both sides.
---
If someone is ruining my experience I‚Äôll make sure their experience is ruined as well.
---
MY PLEASURE YOU GLORIOUS BEAST YOU. GO BE THE BESTEST BOI YOU CAN BE!
---
I can‚Äôt wait to see what legion will look like, your art is good so I‚Äôm not even worrying
---
&gt; Dead hard for distance is a crutch because it allows survivor to make mistakes and get away with it.
---
Survivors that make mistakes in looping after using dead hard are easy to kill.
---
Adren is a reward for the survivors finishing there objective, it has counter play, play around it.
---
Many survivor perks have draw backs. 
---
You can slug a survivor using DS and Unbreakable, just down them after they pop up. 
---
NOED is the definition of a crutch. If you think Adren is a reward for doing nothing, then what is NOED? its literally a reward for being bad at the game.
---
That almost like ESCAPE TO PREVENT NOED
---
Hex: Homo
---
ON THE PTB IT WAS BECAUSE HER ADD-ONS WERE PRETTY BROKEN SO YOU COULDN'T REALLY DO MUCH TESTING BUT I PROMISE SHE'S GOT SOME INTERESTING ONES. ONE OF THE ADD-ONS MAKE HER ABLE TO BLINK BACK TO HER STARTING POSITION AND SOMEONE WAS ACTUALLY ABLE TO GET A GEN GRAB BY USING THAT. I KNOW IT'S ONE OF THOSE THINGS THAT WON'T HAPPEN OFTEN BUT IT LOOKED REALLY SATISFYING!
---
You‚Äôre not wrong
---
Which brings me to a new question, what is it called if you have relations with a ghost or spirit? (Even if not possible, surely it would have a name lol)
---
Sorry, I haven't see him))
---
AGREED. ONLY GIVE HER THE POWER IF YOU HATE YOUR TEAM AND/OR ARE LOOKING TO CHALLENGE YOURSELF ON PLAYING AGAINST IT.
---
Original?
---
Holys**.
---
I guess yes, I mean I hope he Is. It would be so cool to get more lore.
---
Yeah he makes those amazing big brain plays, always knowing exactly where he is going to chase the survivors and trapping it beforehand
---
Fuck no
---
I read that ding with the invisible bell thing in game
---
It's be like the coin.
---
Big daddy Myers is the only daddy 
---
At any rate though, if you say mori me in your name and dc, you should rethink your name choice lol
---
Don‚Äôt mind me I‚Äôm only here to see who identifies with this because I don‚Äôt.
---
Lol, I may do it next time I stream for the funz 
---
See if I can actually get some kills if people get curious in the basement
---
Bwing Bowng Nea-kun. Wots thwis 
---
*notice your balance landing*
---
Don‚Äôt play killer lol. I haven‚Äôt touched this game in months lol.
---
Valid point I suppose or just fix the match making. That's a just the current system is awful.
---
 I'm sure the game has more than enough players I mean they're still updating and they're still making money and there's a lot of people playing.
---
 I play on console and it's easy to find matches I imagine it's 3 times as easy on PC where there's probably more players.
---
Did this man really just put Huntresses lullaby over Sloppy, Monitor, Dying light, Infectious, Bitter, and PWYF?
---
I take from your tag you play legion? If so legion is easy to bully if you are still learning how to effectively play them. (Also my pfp is my derg as part of the legion as I play them a lot :p) And at higher ranks you will likely have a more difficult time with legion. And in my personal opinion, as I play both sides a lot, camping just encourages more toxicity. Killer is something that takes a lot of game sense. 
---
If you feel up to it, something that will massively help you play killer effectively is learning survivor and becoming decent with them. When I play killer, I think about what I would be doing if I was a survivor in that match, and vice versus for when I play survivor. That way it allows me to think about my map pressure, when to stop chasing someone who is good at looping me, or what mind-games I think they might fall for, etc. and for survivor I try to think about and predict what the killer would do in a chase if I were the killer.  Hope this makes sense, and if you would like me to try and help you out feel free to mag me and I can give you my steam, I can try and teach you best I can :3
---
I enjoy killer way more than survivor just cause the killer mains are fucking buzzkill
---
I've seen stranger things than this. Who else is going to take off their pants for this prefect creature?
---
I just got annoyed of the constant harassment that I pretty much quit the game now that I think of it lol.
---
*yawns in rainbow 6 siege*
---
The fact that they touch makes me gag
---
The age ol question
---
The best example I can think of is huntress pulling out a hatchet when you‚Äôre coming up to a pallet you either drop the pallet and take the hit or you risk not dropping it and continuing the loop. With spirit you just have to guess where she could be
---
No but close. Each perk belongs to a different killer. 
---
Billy, spirit, huntress, clown and the 4 legions on ormond plus pig as the base killer.
---
OPTIONAL, battlepass, that adds nothing but cosmetics, doesn‚Äôt effect gameplay.
---
Lol!  Dude not even close man.  If a NOED gamer is chasing you when the last gen pops that's a wrap.  Their haste will eventually catch up to that survivor no matter how bad they are and get that instadown and hook. Is it that survivors fault for NoT eScApInG?  
---
Also you 100% should have said do totems that's how you counter NOED.  But even that wasn't what we were discussing.  Your disbelief that it's possible to play to pressure gens and end them with games up speaks volumes about your personal killer play.  There has never been more perks at our disposal to achieve this than there are right now.  I routinely end my games with gens up.  Pretending this isn't possible is just words from a very inexperienced killer.
---
my queue just took 4 minutes and 32 seconds
---
dunno if I should be happy or cry
---
Steve would roast the kid back, so would nea.
---
Why is it required, on the stream they said it's only cosmetics. Im kinda excited honestly.
---
Good thing / shame (depends on perspective) the counter sabo-perk is barely worth bringing. I am eager to play against more sabo squads. Spice things up a bit.
---
Everything is expensive for the poor. If you used your time looking for a job instead of bitching in Reddit that 10 dollar/10 euros is like a fart in the wind.
---
They have a free tier for the likes of you so be grateful.
---
Yup you're right about solo q
---
This would break the game

You don‚Äôt have to buy it, it‚Äôs purely cosmetics.

This is known info

It doesn‚Äôt force you to pay

Ya but it‚Äôs cool to see
---
Yeah we already knew it was leaked a week or two ago
---
Better have old man mask. It‚Äôs my favorite mask because it has so much detail and makes it look nice instead of just WHITE.
---
The rank 19 was also a teabagging Dwight with his swf who blocked me in a corner. I literally could not hit him from where I was.
---
I'm sorry but you be talking mad shit on were going to live forever, that is like bbq without the auras

Not to someone that hasn‚Äôt played dbd in months lol.

3 year old game is still getting support. Sales have no doubt slowed. Gotta keep money rolling to keep the lights on.
---
This post is so dumb I love it. Please post more complaints about the game please.
---
When she runs she glitches in and out, she leaves like an afterimage behind her.
---
Nice tunnel, reported
---
A few things:
---
* Nobody's forcing you to buy the premium track. There's a free track that transfers your progress over if you buy the premium pass.
---
* You earn back all the auric cells that you spent on it *if you finish all tiers.*
---
* All the rewards are cosmetic-only.
---
It‚Äôs his hospital gown and 3 new weapons it was leaked a week ago
---
It's a paid game
---
I hate when that happens, especially when I‚Äôm about to give them the hatch.
---
That's been happening for ages it's not only swf. It's all the matchmaking
---
It has been frequently posted in this sub some pantless Myers or what ever it is going to be
---
And
---
It‚Äôs just a problem with there ranking system right now on my stream earlier I‚Äôm at rank 10 and I‚Äôm getting matched with 20-14 no joke and it‚Äôs annoying because most of them have no idea what they‚Äôre doing and at devotion 5 it‚Äôs painful to watch pallets get wasted so much
---
I can relate... but it was the only option. I did it for the greater good.
---
Missing the entire point of my post to focus on one word. 
---
&gt;If you have no plan that‚Äôs not the killer being broken.
---
No where did I say she was broken please point to me where I said that before you put words in my mouth to support your argument :)
---
You can't run with any type of plan she's quite literally invisible. You can hear her feet when she's close to you but that's about it. She is BORING to play against in the same that old Legion was that was the point of my post.
---
It requires you to pay AND play if you want the content.
---
Look at his perks, it's a phony rank 19.
---
That has 4. The leaked hospital set has 3 maximum, and I'm not sure about the mask. Could it be an Old Man Myers mask?
---
I'm mad BECAUSE i work my ass off for my money and don't get it shoved up my ass like you do.
---
M O I S T
---
Stay away from me with that shit. üòÇ
---
I tried to give a baby Dwight the hatch last night, but he kept wiggling off and running away from me. Even after he wiggled off directly on top of the hatch! I got bored after a few attempts, so I closed it and hooked him. He went on Fortnite right after that. Sorry, baby Dwight. I did try!
---
You know that you would get the paid currency back just by playing right ?
---
So you may need to pay one times for every pass.
---
Not gonna lie, it's absolutely hilarious to see a blendette hiding and walk by as if I didn't see them. Only to moonwalk back and M1 them.
---
Both sides are toxic asf I‚Äôm
---
Honestly losing patience at this point 
---
This community is nothing but assholes. I‚Äôm happy there are good people out there though
---
I'm normally nicer to newer players to let them get a grasp of what they're doing. If the last survivor wasn't toxic (like tea-bagging/flash-light clicking) then I'll always let them either get the hatch or door (I usually try to make it so the toxic survivor always dies). I also try to avoid mori-ing (how do you spell that?) them if I can.
---
Well People dont like GF, but i dont agree with DC'ing bc you are losing that bad. 
---
also you just got unlucky in pre game lobby if you where waiting that long with green ping.
---
Combat straps feel really nice. I just bought her like 30 mins ago and I already know what I like lol
---
Yeah, unfortunately you can't bring the perks every game hoping you come across a sabo team with how rare they are.
---
*wait... that's illegal*
---
This is fucking bullshit. I knew it was going to happen eventually and I'm mildly disappointed in behavior.
---
_-When Barb gets sick of your shit-_

Someone's gone fishing.

Its just cosmetics tho, as long as they dont ass pay to win stuff in the battlepass I see no issue

survivors are about to start getting points for wiggling sooo

Ngl my friends and I did this to killers who hard tunneled. We were pretty fed up with it during rank reset where a lot of killers would just tunnel 1 person to death. Didn't want to reward them for that kind of behaviour with a kill.
---
Vsync cannlt be disabled on xbox
---
Oh thats okay then. I would have been gutted otherwise.
---
It's an iffy thing to address because killing yourself on hook is a thing.
---
Dude chillax ITS A DAMN GAME.....never in gaming history had their never been a bit of trolling, BM, and frustration... get over it and just turn endgame chat off if you cant handle it, no post on reddit saying "I was actively trying to lose and I was mocked in the endgame chat when I did indeed lose" isnt gunna do anything for anyone.
---
I'm telling you, you gotta let that shit go bruh.
---
6? They showed more than 6. I get that the event is a bloodpoint event this year, but will we be able to get the all of the serum in the battle pass during the period that was given to us
---
Hey you, your‚Äôre finally awake...
---
MOVE AWAY YOU TWO! I NEED TO CLEANSE THAT TOTEM!
---
Why? Free stuff is never bad
---
But it is mostly gay/futa stuff. Last time i looked it had like 10 posts of Huntress with a dick in the front page. A straight man cannot jack off to that
---
Now im sad
---
Rank 9 (haven't played since reset) playing with rank 18's... feels bad.
---
Damn bro thats kinda gay actually
---
Am I the only one who has no clue what this meme means. Can anyone explain?
---
Uno reverse
---
:(
---
You do understand either way its politics right?
---
It does look like a younger Evan, especially the background shows a mine cart.
---
There will definitely only be 6 Vials as you can only buy 2 of the Halloween Cosmetics which consist of 3 pieces each. 
---
And yes even when the Halloween event has ended the Rift will remain open with the Vials there for you to get.
---
"Ahhh, I'm so fast!"
---
*dies*

poor guy, well at least they got a nice killer &lt;3
---
Nah dw we just sayin no homo then all good
---
I usually see this in reverse, with players using things like tuin and noed
---
Official BHVR statement is that they will not go out of their way to ban you for using one. However, if EAC detects and bans you for it they will not help you and unban your account. The risk is purely yours. 
---
I have been using one for 3 months with no issue so far.
---
The way they explained it sounded like if you don't get whatever cosmetic that you can never get it again, that and just the concept itself is fucking stupid, annoying, and I'm scared of this game becoming shitty just like all the other games who decided to throw up a pass.
---
i had a whole squad ragequit on me when they saw i played spirit...
---
no this is from the dev stream
---
Not yet
---
No it will in a few days
---
I disagree heavily one of the meta perks rn is no mither and self care, I believe they should be in the OP category.
---
Gamers being horny and weird? I‚Äôm shocked
---
yes it is.
---
I like how most to all of the commenters are survivors. 
---
Allow me to say that yes. Its a good perk. Honestly its a great one. Forcing survivors and SWF groups to get rid of totems regardless of status is great! It makes it easier for the killer to actually get hooks and kills and it gives them more utility. It would also work fucking wonders with Haunted Grounds. At this point, Survivors get shit done too quickly. And SWF teams are extroadinarily prevelant at this point. 
---
We could always use more killers in the game. And less Toxicity from the SWF side. Thanks for the idea man. Its lovely.
---
I don't know,[ this](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/125/2GNOJBKHL3RT.png) doesn't look like only 6 vials to me. Plus, the trailer showed vial pieces go over tier 30.

Thanks! That means a lot to hear. We feel the sounds in game could be improved as a whole, and it fit perfectly into the halloween theme this month :)
---
You‚Äôre doing God‚Äôs work brother
---
No, he's right. The joke is that since its their face on it, they count as an individual killer, plus the Legions having all of them on the photo.
---
If that was the case, they could've used any other perk, and the joke wouldn't work.
---
I actually seem to hit them way better when I‚Äôm drinking for some reason, maybe because I‚Äôm not tense.
---
The game wouldn't need a battle pass of they had a balanced killer roster, and longer more interesting games where survivors had more interesting objectives other than holding m1 until chased rinse repeat.
---
Or more game modes where people who prefer killer can team up in a 2v8 on a slightly enhanced map that contains more pallets and a few extra windows and more objectives... of course killers like trapper, hag, freddy and pig would need more traps to compensate but it would be a fun interesting game mode after all....
---
My understanding is that you can collect serums from the free rift track until the rift closes, even after the Halloween event is over.
---
I would say they are comparable as the survivers can stop doing gens to do totems to counter it
---
Yes actually, if you are on a gen against a spirit in her terror radius, you should expect  her to come from anywhere anytime. What is unfair is prayer beads preventing counter play by still allowing silent phasing outside the terror radius,
---
People learn from the streams.  They can see mistakes that both the streamer and killer make.  And it's fun just seeing stuff like glitches happen or the streamer having an intense match.
---
Do you think Wraith is boring too?  He fits that same description.
---
I was also reaching your end conclusion.  You‚Äôre suggesting things wrong with Spirit to be fixed.  If something is to be fixed it has to be broken.  These are pretty basic rhetorical concepts.
---
Actually, the devs said on a blogpost when the PTB started that outfits in the Rift will become available in the store months later. The Rift is just a way to get it a bit early.
---
If I had to guess its because killer is just a naturally more "interesting" sounding role than survivor, killing others sounds a lot more fun than working on a generator and pressing space irregularly for 2 minutes x 5. Also there needs to be a 4:1 ration of survivors to killers so even if half the people main killer and half survivors (and they all queue up at the same time) half of those killers will be waiting on games while all the survivors get to play.
---
Well, people asked for exclusives, and when we get them, they get ungreatful lol, also, if you buy the premium version, you get your auric cells again for the other tome

When exactly was this, and what was the post's title? For scientific purposes.

---
These would be awesome Tarot cards too.
---
I agree. I'm no survivor main but I think its pretty unfair that you need offerings to actually get a decent amount of bloodpoints as a survivor. To be quite honest , It would offer more incentive to have both sides actually grind for bloodpoints instead of getting 45,000 a match.
---
They indicated that the rift cosmetics will be released in the store at least 6 months after the rift ends.
---
Maybe nerf Prayer Beads so that instead of completely removing the sound it just reduces the radius by half. That would still be a powerful add-on but not completely broken
---
I run Myers with BBQ, Save the best for last, Bitter Murmur, and Deerstalker.
---
Save the best for last is really good when you know what you are doing. And I use Deerstalker because every game I find the last 2 injuried survivors together down the one and then down the other so I can see the first one I downed since they probably crawl away. I‚Äôve gotten many 4K games with that combo.
---
I love that meme template
---
Actually, you get back all the Auric Cells you spend on the pass via the premium track, so if you can get all the required tiers and are patient enough you can save those Cells to buy the next one.
---
I second this post. If you can't get to rank 1 on your first day of playing the game you are actually a potato.

My point is it looks like every feminine guy to exist and by apologizing it looks like you you‚Äôre just asking for attention

well yea chief ofc it is but futa on dude is only 75% gay, meanwhile futa on girl is only 25%.
---
Why does he have a ball sack on his forehead?
---
Toxic by just running around you. Not going the objectives. Teabagging and just being like an annoying fly the whole game..
---
But people on here use these memes to shape their in-game personality and get legit angry when you stray from what's trending, remember the survivor rule book? People ***actually*** try to use that against you, non-ironically.
---
Im assuming it will take a lot of tiers to get your money back, anyway ill probably just cave and buy cosmetics with the cells, i never buy them usually.
---
Dude you must be somewhat kidding yourself. I'm not very good at killer and get consistently better results on Spirit than any other killer. She IS easy for the amount of power she has. Billy is top tier too but he's a lot harder to learn. Spirit is just an m1 killer that you need a good headset to play.  Survivors going invisible is almost a non-problem for her, at least when I play her.
---
&gt; nurse (break line of sight, juke etc

Luckily people haven't realized this yet. But im all ears is absolute god tier on nurse

Trapper 2.0 - He's tired of bear traps, so it's time for a gruesome trap door.

Yeah, I'm p noob but I can acknowledge when a game is gg, and everytime I stop struggling it's basement time.

True but you can't really assume that for everyone that posts a meme on here

A dumb mechanic when the survivor is in the center of the screen, blocking your view of Ghostface.

She literally had to walk right next to him while looking at him for it to trigger. For any new players to the game, the reveal system is horribly un-intuitive.

If there just running around you and spinning etc id just chase. Them not doing the objective isnt a bad thing for you

Then why did you get angry when I said I kill baby dwights
---
There's not so many youtube videos of survivors surviving 50+ matches. Are you JUST talking about noob3? Because that's ONE guy. I watched the whole 50 matches too, he had his friend die for him constantly and I'm 99% sure a vast majority of killers he went against let him win because they were fans of the stream. I mean a legion even let him crawl out at one point if I recall correctly.
---
That actually sounds awesome..
---
I think it helps to be a friendly survivor who wants the killler to have a low stress game and just make points.
---
duh i am cosplayer, i am looking for attention, you haven't brought anything new. and i think ghostface as feminine guy seems pretty reasonable, he does have body of feminine guy at least so nothing wrong with having feminine face and structure :3
---
Lullaby is A tier? Infectious is B tier?? Pop and Ruin are only A tier?? Franklins is above RUIN AND POP?
---
" cuz sometimes I can get a nice hit if they decide to go back for their item or if they try to pick it back up in a chase " - So it's situationally useful. Put it at B tier.
---
For everyone confused about the knives, the original image does not contain knives. They‚Äôre waiting for the father‚Äôs return. The knives were photoshopped later on, and yes, it‚Äôs hilarious

Yeah but tbh my rank 17 vs a rank 7 Claudette who has all max lvl perks is never fun.
---
The worst bug in this game I've ever heard of.
---
That screenshot is epic
---
I'll probably get downvoted for this but I enjoy playing against spirit. I can't just Loop her like a typical killer and she encourages Stealth gameplay to mix things up.
---
There are a few easy tricks to tell if she is actually phasing such as watching her hair and listening for footsteps/ staying near Tallgrass.
---
Honestly I think a lot of survivors overrate how difficult she has to be. Of course she's going to seem impossible if someone on your team always instantly suicides on hook or disconnects upon finding out it's a spirit instead of even trying. If people stopped quitting against her then people would Escape against her more often. It's weird how any killer that brings new gameplay to the table is automatically labeled overpowered and usually ends up being nerfed into the ground until they are an easily loopable M1 killer. IE, Old Freddy, New Nurse on Large Maps, Lery's, Haddonfield and the Corn. And soon to join them Spirit and Huntress lmao.
---
Either way feel free to reply if you have your own objections or criticisms of what I've said.. Don't just insult and downvote me like a child.
---
Does he add memes?
---
I didnt get angry. I was joking. Also for your information if you didnt get the joke greedy dirt bag was from a meme called let it grow or something like that.
---
Ghost face has a normal male body along with Freddy, hardly any guy ever looks like trapper, Doctor, Meyers, etc, their body types aren‚Äôt the norm.
---
Yeah i agree
---
I guess I'm the only one that actually prefers trapper over other killers
---
Just skip to the next one? If it‚Äôs not your thing that‚Äôs fine, but ‚Äúthe last time I checked‚Äù could have been when the sub was first created, aka before they moved all the strictly gay porn to r/dbdgonegay

nope, only cut gameplay

You cleanse either of these and everybody gets exposed.
---
Sorry, not a meme historian. I enjoy real humor.
---
I play both PC and console. Hopefully no problems will arise with the certification process on console.
---
Wait,  but how is it fair on the other side if you can just know what they're doin? How would I catch you besides the general war of attrition every other killer has to do in a chase if the game just told you what I was doing.  
---
(Also, spine chill can help tell you if spirit is phasing or not)

Move leatherface to basic boys and switch nurse and billy, but other than that everything else is the same lol

Are you asking if it‚Äôs original or asking for the original cartoon?

This IS from shrinewatch. They just added text

Where does the lore come into play in all this? That's my only interest. Is it just through the cosmetics?

It's more that the lawsuit completely screwed them over by stopping them from adding new content.

The devs werent the greatest either though.

Making progress through the tomes will unlock lore entries (text that will be narrated by the Observer) and cinematics (in a similar style to the Hallowed Blight ones).

That‚Äôs pretty toxic and kinda rude. When I go up against new killers I just try to escape so I can get a new game
---
I don't always show mercy but he was rank 20, obviously didn't know what he was doing and the others were, if I recall, around 8 and lower.
---
I can be merciless but if others dc I really don't feel it's fair. I want to enjoy the game, so I try new techniques, different ways to chase and injure but eh, I'm not going with my A game if they're screwed by a player that's too scared. If I still kill some on those days I figure they had a chance, but to dc as an entire SWF group: I'm not punishing a new player for it. Took some time for him to trust me though lol.
---
I hate the player dc crap cause it makes getting the adept killer trophies almost impossible.
---
lol I love this
---
Oh it is. And like I said, nurse always has the upper hand. Even tho there is counterplay, she is still (prenerf) grossly overpowered. The same could be said for spirit.
---
I just hate everyone saying there is no counter play. That allows them to just go "herp derp its spirit DC" because in their mind the spirit can literally have zero effort (not true at all) and kill them and theres nothing they can do (also not true) 
---
Something can be incredibly op and STILL have counterplay. Then I say that and then go "OMG YOU KILLER MAIN DIPSHIT YOU DONT KNOW ANYTHING!" and I'm like.... i literally just agreed with you that shes op. I just think theres counterplay. As a spirit I've seen it and as a survivor I've done it. It does exist. The mindgame is just heavily in the spirits favor.

i can see why people wouldn't enjoy trapper because he seems pretty bland but there is just nothing more satisfying in this game to me than hearing that snap. plus, he actually requires a lot more knowledge of the game and skill than you would expect. he's the killer i started playing when i got bored of just playing survivor, but since i knew how basically all the loops works, i had a really easy time herding survivors into my traps
---
Thatd also be funny if it happens with a trapper, just say a trapper puts down a random trap and the hatch spawns and opens but when the survivor goes to jump in it he/she gets stuck in the trap
---
How did they know i main Legion and P3 Claudette?
---
Also object of obsession is cancer

It‚Äôs literally a fucking mindgame you dolt.
---
Send a ticket to BHVR and any evidence you have that proves you did own it. They've not got a history of returning items though unfortunately, if they refuse try reinstalling the game or if it was store bought try looking for it on the store.
---
I wasn't referring to it as OP I called it a crutch.  The biggest crutch perk in the game at this point actually.  There's a difference.  I'm fine with NOED I run Small Game and punish anyone foolish enough to still rely on that at red ranks.  But it's hard to look at the horrible design of the perk and see it as anything other than a reward and massive buff for playing very poorly. 
---
Your comments repeatedly cast disbelief on the fact that killers ending games with gens up is an actual strategy.  Again good killers enter every game with this intent in mind and often their builds reflect this (ruin, pop, than, dying light, etc...).  That's my goal every time I queue.  For a player to be in disbelief that ending games with gens up is a valid possibility I had no other choice other than to question your personal killer play and experience.  You aren't leaving me much choice there man.
---
Unless the survivors you encounter were babies, not many survivors likes to farm, "where's the fun in that?"

It's like the condom of games. Helps you keep your sanity later in life when you remember who or what you used to touch, only separated by a thin barrier of latex.

As someone who only gives hatch if the survivor concedes defeat, I respect this mindset immensely. You may die, but at least you died with your honor and pride intact
---
Yea now that would be pretty cool

Everybody likes Jeff and baby dweets.

They wanted to pick Dwight but he was hiding in a different locker. They bumped into Claudette while checking.

Either hook them or let them crawl out.  This is just needless bm and it's no better than survivors that teabag endlessly at the gate.  Killers seem to get a lot of slack on this sub when it comes to bm compared to survivors.
---
Can't do anything about it and "getting good" wont really do much if the survivors are good..they have all the time to make fun of you and still win.

"Watching her hair" im sorry wut
---
Someone has already suggested Gen-tapping. For starters, gen tapping is about half the speed of normal gen progress, so that's already a fucking massive downside. But the main thing is that, sure it prevents a gen grab, but it doesn't prevent the free hit the spirit still gets. That's not much of a counter.
---
Either way, an eye for an eye. Playing like a piece of shit just because you get a bad game every once in a while doesn't help anything.

im not stating these as fact ya know its subjective

they werent there i'm sorry its a premade tiermaker list id probably put

Discordance at A and Stridor at C
---
But noed can be denied any moment before or after activation. And as for "rewarding for playing bad" if noed highlighted the aura of the last remaining survivor in the trial if all other survivors have not escaped, i think people wouldn't be less salty about it, even though it would be the exact opposite of being a "bad play crutch".
---
Well I for one enjoy and stand with you in your enthusiasm

If it's a meme with Trump in it and used as a demeaning way and the entire subject of politics isn't even mentioned even though he's a literal political figure. 
---
Yet here we are, politics are being mentioned in a vein effort to have an entire post shut down even when the figure in the picture isn't involved in politics. She just happens to be some whack job child that's claiming the world is about burst into flames for driving cars and living our lives. She just happens to be idolized by equally bat shit crazy liberals. She is in no way affiliated with politics. Which doesn't make this a political post even if it was meant to be one and your defense as such proves my point exactly.

When Billy is chasing you, you can see him.  Based on his movement, you know where to loop, how to juke, and where to path to the next maze tile.
---
When using her power, Spirit is invisible.  Yes, she‚Äôs technically counterable by vaults and pallets, but you can‚Äôt know which side she‚Äôs going to.  Every vault, every pallet drop, every movement in a chase against a spirit is a gamble.
---
&gt;If a Spirit out-mindgames you, you get hit.  If Billy out-mindgames you, to get downed.
---
Right, but that‚Äôs extremely misleading when you consider the midgame potential of each killer.  Spirit can mindgame you anywhere anytime.  Billy needs specific circumstances to even be able to mindgame with his chainsaw and even then, you can hear him revving and know generally what he‚Äôs trying to do.  
---
The fact that Spirit can mindgame anywhere at anytime is what makes her so strong.  Billy can curve and do some interesting things with his sounds and animation, but at the end of the day you can still just loop him.  And if you‚Äôre at an unmindgameable loop, of which there are still many in this game, he‚Äôs just a basic 115% M1 killer.

I'll edit that. I do use R1. I typed the wrong thing.

You mean that op add on the devs wont nerf? Yeah at this point when you see a huntress with iridescent heads just leave the game. Most survivors do and I dont blame them.
---
how many times while playing solo survivor has all 5 totems been destroyed? I can tell you i doubt its many, Often times survivors will cleanse 3-4 totems throughout a game, With swf is easier to communicate how many are gone, but you are still most likely gonna get NOED, and if you do its a free kill if you are not dumb
---
Her hair momentarily becomes a more straight triangle shape if she is actually phasing. It's a blink-and-you'll-miss-it thing but it happens because the character model is remaining stationary while the camera has left it for the invisible model.

But besides that. Any timing suggestions?

&gt;  If you dont run them, then you're screwed.
---
thats true of every perk in plenty of situations, and Spine Chill is good against all killers, as I pointed out. Not to mention it's free. most survivors have no problem running Decisive and Borrowed Time every match, this is no different. Killers are stuck running Ruin every match because the survivor's only have one objective, which is broken easy to do. 
---
the only real problem here is, the other killers are so weak, it's inevitable that the strongest killer will be very common at high ranks. so the survivors get tired of facing only that killer. but of course, in true survivor fashion, they want the challenge removed rather than use the ways they can counter it. And instead of asking for any of the others killers to be buffed so they can have a chance to play against these, they demand that the strong ones be nerfed.

Maybe. I suspect most players would be in lower tiers. It could create an issue at the highest level of play, especially b/c DbD isn't a competitive game like csgo or ow. But it would fix the bullying problem at low ranks.
---
interesting, you sure they where not stuck themselves?
---
I would like the puzzle gens in the actual game
---
They weren't the best, but at least the game was fun. I just wish we had gotten more content.
---
You have the entire rift (70 days) on you to get those serums for Halloween skins. However, the event itself will only last 11 days (where you get bonus points for burning offerings and using event generators/hooks).
---
a lot of perks are "Situationally useful", thats kinda what they are for to help you in those situations which they occur. If theres a guy with an insta heal or a flashlight and they get hit thats a massive loss for their chase, see in that situation it helps. Even nurses is situational, not everyone is gonna be heal around you as most don't in fear of being heard let alone seen. One more example Adrenalin, it only helps if you actually get 5 gens one which doesn't always happen so its dead weigh till that moment. I am aware not every single perk follows this as ruin is almost always working as long as the totem is lit and Save The Best For Last will be working 24/7 because of how easy it is to stack up. I hope you realize that this list is probably drastically different from what urs would be but we all have different experiences on how games and perks work out for us.
---
I hit them near a tree so she had to crawl there and know what she was doing
---
All needless BM is horrible and completely unnecessary for the game.  It just creates a cycle of endless toxicity and you could have stopped at the crappy part but you just had to go on to qualify it by downplaying the severity of it.  Just leave it at BM is shitty and shouldn't happen.
---
Weird. Any photos/reference?

I've heard that you can look at the Glass Shards in her body, and if they "glow" that means she's phasing

Great catch! Can't wait to see the lore on him.
---
you can enjoy playing against a spirit, but you said it yourself: she encourages stealth gameplay. playing stealthy is so *boring*. can you watch her hair? sure. can you hear her footsteps? i guess. not when you're in chase though, chase music is so fucking loud.
---
new nurse is fine. all the people who are any good at nurse agree that she's fine. huntress will not be nerfed, because she's fair. she's balanced. if they ever decide to make dedicated servers truly work, they might fix hatchet hitboxes, which i guess you could consider a nerf. 
---
demogorgon brought a lot of new stuff to the table, i think. is he good? i think so. is he viable at high ranks? again, i think so. he's not your typical m1 killer. does anyone with a brain think he should be nerfed? no.
---
i double pipped at rank 1 for the first time (i think) against a spirit just the other day. it was fun, i guess, playing immersed for one game. but with iron will i would've been hopeless. that's another issue though
---
r/dbdgonewild agrees
---
oh great balanced ladning...
---
Is that Monstrous Shrine? On Legion? You must have a very particular play style. I'm curious now.
---
Could you imagine how sadistically depraved the mori would have to be?
---
God if anyone actually does this i feel bad for em, imagine being such a sweat squad your entire squad agrees to do this. Must really not have much fun in this game, Luckily most SWFs are p chill :D
---
sLuGgEr
---
He will be missed :(
---
I have a friend who had monto DC against them, "Made Monto DC" was there name for a few days... i got some laughs from it i wont lie
---
me and my team see a spirit = insta dc. we all lose pipes instead of giving the cunt playing her 1.
---
Giving them the hatch is the only thing that makes you a bad person.
---
True,even the most tame kill from the film was gory asf
---
Isn‚Äôt silent like a mime just an extreme m&amp;a?
---
Whatever's happening I like it
---
r/thatescalated
---
I played against Monto and puppers a few times killed the two randoms and they escaped didn't want to tunnel them really boring
---
The biggest mood
---
What system are you playing on? I'm playing on PS4, and been playing for 4-5 months and neither of them have unlocked. I play Survivor far more than Killer so it should of been unlocked a long time ago.
---
Items vs addons dont have anything to do with bloodpoint differences since you can use BP on any character even if you never play them. You could always play killer and use all your points to level survivors for example.
---
Happy!
---
Steve too although he is not very good at it.
---
I started hating her when i played her for fun at red ranks for the first time a few months ago, i realized just how easy she is and how unfair she is to play against.
---
Wuss
---
Facecamp all TTVs? But you have yt in your reddit username so isnt that just as bad?
---
i dont have to many perks for legion but what i do have is pretty much tripling down on pressure.
---
Truly a man with a gift for speech
---
That's the only reason that makes sense to me, though I'll still never do it.
---
Do this but remove her ability to see scratch marks instead, Would actually make her somewhat skill based
---
What happened?
---
*Never gonna pick you up...*
---
*Never gonna hook you down...*
---
*Never gonna stand around and camp you!*
---
Mmm, I don‚Äôt think the doctor was tortured, nor the trapper. Doctor is just a sadistic person, and trapper is well... i dunno, but he killed on purpose
---
Oh my god! A killer slugged me and didnt let me escape or kill me instantly, oh no survivors are tea bagging me! Toughen up, people shouldnt BM, it's stupid, but people also dont need to whine about it every single time someone does a small thing.
---
Mood.
---
Well just cause I made this meme doesn't mean I hate her. Quiet the opposite. I main her as killer.
---
Just wanted to use this template and came up with the idea
---
I don‚Äôt miss decisive on PS4 anymore since I use it so frequently when I solo que and I press it about half a second before basically just press is when your half the skill check distance away from it at least for me cause I one what you mean it is a bit weird
---
Guess not.
---
The might wizard mcote made a spell on him
---
The only comment that makes sense. thank you.
---
Silent as a mime should the terror radius status reversed so 12/10/8.
---
Ash
---
Mcote will bear my seed.
---
Yeah but its kinda a useless perk once they know you have it, they kinda won‚Äôt pick their item up for you to whack it again. Plus another reason why I don‚Äôt bring items then FD is useless
---
So your argument is that she is fair bc somtimes the people playing her mess up? do you remember why people complained about survivors a while ago? bc they had total control and only died when THEY messed up.
---
I wish. My friends hate kyf. Then proceed to complain about every killer they play against. What happened to friends just wanting to play with friends.
---
I'm a lesbian. But I prefer the word gay.
---
I usually let all of them go because I suck
---
Oink oink
---
Lol if you let a survivor bleed out that‚Äôs considered taking the game hostage. The audacity of some survivors.
---
Or put on socks
---
Its not even bannable to let someone bleed out in the match even tho its a scummy move. Especially when you just do it coz its a streamer, most of the streamers are nice persons, just some of them are toxic. So why punish all of them? Never understood...
---
Ah OK, thought you were running some kind of unusual strategy haha.
---
Have you seen the doctor? His very being is torment. The entity did that to him.
---
Do you play Hillbilly?
---
The game I play is this.
---
Down last survivor
---
Find hatch and close.
---
Find downed survivor and pick them up, wait till they struggle free.
---
Down them right as they open the doors and watch them crawl out as my killer spasticly shakes his head and teabags them (I main ghost face)
---
Profit.
---
perfect loop, I am complete.
---
Honestly it‚Äôs just game time, I‚Äôm just under devotion 3 and I hit rank 1 on both sides consistently. Yeah you can see some people who are obviously god tier but I find a lot of rank 1 survivors who are worse than some purple ranks
---
I main huntress and wraith, but I play a bit of billy yes.
---
As a Ghostface, I once trapped 3 survivors with bloodwarden. While I was asserting my dominance by T-bagging them, a Jane dropped her medkit. I accepted the offering and understood that she acknowledged me as the supreme T-bagger, so I downed a survivor, this slowed the timer down just enough for them to escape (1 second later and I would have gotten a 4k)
---
Let's get this kush haha suh dude names Tim
---
Ahhhh the I want to depip and ruin others fun starter pack.  For best results just add Prayer Beads.
---
Great movie
---
Unlock hag. Shes loads of fun. Kinda like trapper but you dont have to pick up traps and her traps are basically invisible.
---
Holy shit, thats my steam username
---
Poop art
---
This is incredible
---
Via glitching or can we queue up as 1v5 now?
---
Thank you so much
---
Last game I played, I vaulted a window and I didnt go through it. Just casually vaulted the air and didn't go through the window. Then I died on my first hook. GGs all around.
---
I'm here
---
I have a feeling op is a ‚Äúdo as I say not as I do‚Äù type of person.
---
Bubba. The Entity abused him into killing. He's scared of displeasing it.
---
Didn't they ban a player because a family member of one of the devs got their feeling hurt by the banned player?
---
He just consented to being camped, pretty cool.
---
Yeah nah 
---
At high ranks it‚Äôs against killer builds that are uninteractive (pink moris, iridescent heads, omega blink etc) 
---
I‚Äôd rather chill at a slightly lower rank playing with fun memey perks than having to try hard every single game to counter their own tryhardedness. 
---
Also, at high rank some lower rank friends struggle, so I‚Äôm actually helping them have fun too by joining them
---
that offering doesn't "lessens your hooks", it just separates them to make you walk a little bit more (according to the wiki the most you can separate them is 3.5m) and i'm not saying that it should be a guaranteed escape, im saying that wiggle atm is COMPLETELY useless because even when the killer makes multiple bad choises when carrying a survivor it doesn't matter because he gets away with it anyways
---
billy is a fucking joke and should be nerfed first tbh
---
Be prepared to have your ass handed to you on a silver platter. Playing killer is in someways easier but managing map control is hard af. 
---
I suggest using an easy killer like Freddy to see what its like to have easy map control and easy downs and have fake pallets and blood pools to capture survivors. Play about 10-15 games to get the hang of it.
---
But i would highly suggest afterwards getting Leatherface and getting to level 40 for BBQ/Chili for all killers. And then work from there to get other perks for whatever killer you want to try out
---
Okay, now explain away the necrophilia lol
---
Mathieu killed Dave :/
---
Imagine getting free shit and still being mad. Mega oof.
---
haha i have yet to not get a 4k w him and i play w purple n green ranks mostly
---
well ig you mean 1 is easiest and 10 is hardest, billy would prob be a 7 for a new player and 4 for a experienced player, Why are you asking this?
---
Not a dick move at all. She had ample opportunity to leave, and chose not too, so she faced the consequences
---
I've seen killers do that and still hit and pull survivors off the gen. Then act like they're shocked that the survivors keep running from them.
---

---
If you read the comments you‚Äôll see people asking for this stuff
---
I had a game last night where a wraith was wrecking us. He slugged the last two of us, hooked the other person, and I took off with adrenaline when he closed the hatch. Ran him for a good minute before giving up and giving him my rainbow map. He froze, thought it over, and let me out. It was beautiful! :)
---
i know that's what makes it sad and useless
---
You realise killers still get a large quitter bonus if a surv does this? 
---
It‚Äôs only if they dc early on when alive when it‚Äôs a problem
---
Good thing you can block EAC on you firewall and make sure you never get banned :)
---
Why are you bringing NOED at red ranks then?
---
lmao bro I'm not going to act like I find a dead corpse remotely attractive but if other people think she's sexy, I'm not going to bash them for it. it's a game, calm down.
---
&gt; playing Freddy 
---
&gt; uses *remember me!*
---
&gt; obsession d/c as soon as they see it‚Äôs Freddy (aka when they spawn in)
---
I encounter this scenario often
---
Eh, don't worry, they all adults
---
I would highly suggest checking out the live streamer fungoose he‚Äôs pretty much purely an educational streamer and will give you an amazing idea of what to do and when to do said things
---
Yeh cool thanks for the advice.
---
I don't acc have enduring atm, but I would defo try it out if I did.
---
I also haven't found discordance on Gordon yet in the 50 levels which sucks but its sure to come up soon and I only want level 1 anyway.
---
Curious that you don't run ruin, but I suppose if you commit to the first down quickly then use pop well, you have that extra slot for another good perk, so I get that.
---
I will try out discordance I reckon.
---
Love the red hair!
---
I wonder what this looked like from the killers' POV.
---
Can't call us sicc if they made her thicc
---
I kinda feel bad for the game, it was legit competition for DBD, it was alot of fun, but balancewise it was a mess and the devs were slow at fixing things. The lawsuit hits and its all over
---
Shame, it's a fun game as well
---
Yet surprisingly it was placed on the shelf during the dev stream lol
---
when is gonna be available?
---
Discordance, tinkerer, sloppy butcher, and the clown anti heal perk forget the name. Probably nurse's calling as an alternative to discordance
---
I‚Äôm calm lol. Just think it‚Äôs funny
---
For me I play one side exclusively for awhile then switch when I'm bored then back again rinse and repeat but I also play other games too DBD being the most played tho
---
Happens with the best of games, you play too much and it loses it‚Äôs thrill. I normally just end up taking a break and play other games until that thrill comes back. For some games that‚Äôs a few weeks, for others a few months.
---
this is literally how I felt when twilight was huge tbh. XD
---
Who's the one on the left supposed to be? I thought it was Jane but Jane doesn't wear glasses?
---
Agreed. Don‚Äôt mistake my compassion for you outplaying me homie!!
---
No shit. The entity twisted him into what he is now. I.e torturing him.
---
Im killer only owo
---
Mine isn't that often. Nice tho.
---
Knock-out: There's already a perk in game called Knockout. It's also copying Ghostface's ability. 
---
Silent as a mime: This is just Monitor and Abuse with broken numbers.
---
Lit up: I mean, I'm wondering what this could be useful for. Don't Killers usually want to obscure their Red Stain, not make it more obvious? I can't imagine how this perk would be anything other than a detriment to the Killer using it.
---
Sinister: This at worst promotes basement camping, and at best is like Play With Your Food, but permanent, which already makes it OP. 5% speed boosts (Up to 30%!?) would result in 145% permanent movement speed on most killers fully stacked, do you really think that's a good idea?
---
playing with friends is the only reason i play this game. i‚Äôd never touch this game otherwise. you can also look up fun or meme builds and start using perks you‚Äôve never touched before. i‚Äôve started using hope with resilience and spine chill for extremely fast vaults end game. killer‚Äôs wig = vanishedt.
---
Bro I literally feel you I stopped playing for about 6 months not to long ago and I‚Äôm gettin back into it but the reason I‚Äôm burnt is because I have thousands of hours and I‚Äôm just tired of the same game every time but try changing up your build like try an anti slug build, or a stealth build, or just something you know I mean shit you can even to perk roulette and get combos of perks that you would never use together and get a ‚Äúfresh‚Äù experience it‚Äôs been workin out for me and the archives will definitely help out I‚Äôm extremely excited for it because I‚Äôll finally have something to work towards and get rewarded for it
---
Oh thats my bad i knew it did something like that to the hooks but I remembered incorrectly srry. And it isn‚Äôt useless it keeps survivors from getting hooked in the basement 24/7 it keeps killers from getting ideal hook placements etc. alot of the time its survivors going down close to a hook or body blocking at the wrong time. And if im being honest ur suggestion sounds more like a personal rant. But as someone who plays both survivor and killer id say wiggle is fine.
---
Makes you look like a weiner. That's about it.
---
That is so boss
---
that sounds a lot like something you should report to ps4 themselves or even the police because im pretty sure thats illegal
---
&gt;Mind games by their definition are a 50/50. 
---
Lol
---
Now that‚Äôs epic
---
If you report the messages to Sony they‚Äôll issue a temp ban at the very least, if not ban his account altogether for messages like that. They don‚Äôt mess about.
---
Stealth gameplay is how this game used to be.

Why do you want to play Killer?
---
Who are your favorite Killers in lore, and to go against as a Survivor?
---
What are some of your favorite aspects of horror? What are your favorite stories?
---
Do you prefer slashers or magical fantasy killers?
---
I think you should pick whatever catches your eye as interesting and cool and go in relaxed with an open mind to discovering the process. No sense in worrying. This is your game too and you owe it to yourself to let yourself play around and experiment for the sole sake of enjoyment. Trust your gut!
---
What's up with all this cute shit on the Reddit lately? I love it.
---
Is... is that a trumpet in Mike's hand?

It's a pretty common strategy to avoid seeming like a douche, while also obviously acting like a douche. Saying 'I don't mean to be rude' and following it up with something rude completely voids the first half

"None of you seem to understand.  I'm not bodyblocked in here with you!  **YOU'R BODYBLOCKED IN HERE WITH ME!**"- Mad Grit, Iron Grasp, Agitation, Infectious Fright Trapper
---
I guess I dont know for sure, but I dont know if you can do that on the ps4 version?
---
my best advice is to find some friends to play with. There's an official dbd Discord server, you can always join a sfw there.
---
Have you ever thought that the reason you think these perks are unfair is bc you are bringing perks that do nothing till end game?
---
Still an instant mori is an instant mori that‚Äôs like not being afraid of a person with a gun because ‚Äúthey‚Äôre a bad shot‚Äù

You lost me at franklin's being a S tier perk.
---
Sorry that you‚Äôre being downvoted by idiots
---
I hear Civ is great.
---
Don't exclusively just play this game I juggle about three games at a time rn sekiro and dbd it prevents burn out
---
His dbd username also has .ttv in it. I find that hypocritical.
---
I just played a game where I was about to be put on hook as last survivor, I stopped struggling and Plague pitied me and ended up turning around and looking for hatch üôè
---
This makes sense. Thanks a lot!
---
Remove it from huntress its now on plague. now look what you've done
---
Camping is acceptable during the endgame. There really isn‚Äôt anywhere else to go or do and you want to secure a kill. Tunneling is allowed when the hooked person is unhooked right in front of you. There‚Äôs no reason why you should go for a healthy person. That being said, you might want to consider chasing someone else. It sucks to be tunneled. No one will blame you, but it‚Äôs a game and people are trying to have fun.
---
As for fun killers you can try, I would recommend starting with either Hag, Myers, or Billy. They‚Äôre easy to and you‚Äôll learn a lot. The reason I recommend these killers is because they are easy to learn to use. Ghostface, Spirit, Freddy, etc., are a bit hard to use. Once you feel more confident when playing, you can try out more difficult killers.
---
Here‚Äôs some general tips that will help you:
---
1. Don‚Äôt spend too long on one chase. It‚Äôs easy to get frustrated and get ‚Äútunnel vision‚Äù when chasing a survivor but sometimes you have to drop a chase. Chases shouldn‚Äôt last longer than 40-50 seconds.
---
2. Don‚Äôt use Shadowborn, Predator, or Bloodhound. They are all perks that help you track down survivors. The reason why you don‚Äôt want to use these perks is because you want to get used to be able to track blood and scratch marks normally. If you start using these perks early on, it will be hard to get off them later. 
---
3. Learn to run common loops. You can look on Youtube different ways to run common loops. And you have to learn which pallets are safe or unsafe, so you don‚Äôt waste time mind gaming pallets that can‚Äôt be mind gamed.
---
4. I would start using Ruin when you get to the green ranks. By that point survivors will know what they are doing. I would recommend you get BBQ and Chilli, Discordance, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Monitor and Abuse as soon as possible. These are all great perks. You won‚Äôt benefit from all of these with all killers, but with some killers they are pretty good. 
---
Also just have fun. It can get a but frustrating but it‚Äôs fun playing as killer. It will also help you get better as survivor. Good luck
---
That‚Äôs awesome. Last question before I make my point, what is it that makes Billy hard to master and what is it that makes him fun to play against?
---
We all deep down know that Demogorgon is the sexiest, if not then it's right behind Meyers.
---
You really thought you did something here, huh?
---
Hey a buddy of mine recommended civilization 5, a wonderful rts game similar to age of empires, check it out!
---
Poof, 5 blink nurse is no more
---
wiggling is fine, there are a shit ton of hooks around but if you are smart and your team is smart you might just escape, If you go down most of the time you dont deserve a 2nd chance.
---
Killers that give mercy make me sick.
---
I think it‚Äôs fair since any toolbox allows you to sabo hooks. In the past killers had to use iron grasp or agitation to guarantee a hooked survivor since hooks were random. Now u can find a hook easily without those perks. Now agitation and iron grasp are only good for basement builds or during special hook events.
---
That's why I never wiggle when I'm the last survivor.
---
But, iron will ignores pain grunts with no repercussions. Why is it okay for iron will to completely cancel out a mechanic, but stridor can't counter it slightly?
---
Here at console headquarters we still have to wait for this shit
---
On the xbox it's left bumper.  You sure it's not L1?

---
&gt; that offering doesn't "lessens your hooks", it just separates them to  make you walk a little bit more (according to the wiki the most you can  separate them is 3.5m 
---
Weird, when my SFW offered 4 petrified oaks yesterday, there were literally only like 4 hooks on the Autohaven map.
---
Okay, I'm on Xbox. Only the achievement tracker is bugged on Xbox. As soon as you perform your first heal the tracker jumps to 100% without unlocking. But it pops when you perform the 50 heals
---
His power can be used in many ways, Most top tier billy players can curve around a majority of the loops and hit survivors, but even this can be counter played by a good survivor. he is fun to play against bc he is a challenge, when you play against a good billy, Most of the time is Skill vs skill. It forces you to play your best and adapt in real time.
---
hideous goblin,I could stomp on lettuce for 5 minutes and the result would look more like a face than yours
---
Your right, but I can't blame him still.
---
Kinda related.... does anyone know of a good source for all the DBD lore? I've read the journal entries on the website, but I understand these archives reveal more stuff and I *think* I heard mention of occasional cinematics? Anywhere it's all neatly gathered?
---
I mean, my mentality is just let them be happy so they feel better playing the game. I know it was real hard for me when I started, so I want people to feel like they're getting better

I wasn't disputing the fact that 18 ends with teen. just that since the devs have stated that all characters are 18 or over. which means she's legally an adult. (some exceptions are made based on the area of the world, but I'm pretty sure in most, it's 18.)

Evan Macmillan (The Trapper) led over a hundred men underground and then detonated explosives in the mine to bury them, just to make daddy proud. I don't think he needed torturing by the Entity to convince him to kill survivors.
---
Herman (The Doctor) was recruited by the CIA to administer violent electroshock treatment as torture to extract information from prisoners. After the prisoners gave up their information, they were most likely killed. Then, Herman went mad and killed everyone at Lery's by bashing their heads in. Once again, I don't think he needs to be coerced into being sadistic.

Why would iron will have repercussions in the first place? What perk has repercussions?
---
That one videogame case moved over one slot is nothing compared to the de-thawed Ground Beef sitting in the baby aisle because somebody was too lazy to go back to the freezers.
---
Or the milk left behind in the hardware aisle.
---
Or the empty sticky Starbucks cups left on the shelves.
---
&gt; Whatever language that is I like it.
---
I would prefer it to translate into "survived" and not "sacrificed", but yeah! Other than that, I actually appreciate games getting translated into my mothertongue every now and then.
---
i know and i'm with you, most of the time wiggle shouldn't let you escape, i'm talking about specific situations when the killer makes multiple bad decisions and still gets the hook no problem
---
Haha GOTEEEEM
---
Wiggling isn‚Äôt something that should happen constantly it‚Äôs a rare thing to help people not be dragged all the way to basement yeah this sounds fun not being able to get a hook after you‚Äôve chased a survivor for multiple minutes
---
I'm rank 12. I get put with a rank 8 killer, and 3 rank 16s.
---
Needless to say, the killer thought he was a god.
---
That‚Äôs fair. Standoff sounds horrible, didn‚Äôt really play around then so it‚Äôs good to get some perspectives from those who did play back when that was a thing
---
If you let a survivor bleed out when everyone is down or on a hook that‚Äôs toxic as fuck. Finish the job like you intend to and stop stalling the game like an asshole
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think they deserved the hatch in any way in this situation, as they got one thing done and then hid around for 15 minutes and still got an escape.
---
So you'd like to play 30+ minutes of looking for a super-immersed survivors?
---
Hatch is not a mechanism that makes you lose a game. It's there to prevent a total snoozefest named "let's find a Blendette on a McMillan with mist offering"
---
Excuse you but I've said it's happened multiple times, I've played both killer and survivor, Rank 2 survivor and like a Rank 5 killer before the reset (when I played a lot). I've been blinded and pallet stunned in these cases, usually just being sloppy and I know how it works. What's with you kids and blindly defending a game with obvious bugs? You disregard everything written and cry "It must be the player because I don't have this issue".
---
You have to kill 25 of each of the original survivors and you unlock a cosmetic we wear their face as a mask for leather face
---
Honestly f13 would be much better if it didn‚Äôt rely on communication so much as many people don‚Äôt like talking in game
---
"Oh, you're going in? Let me close this behind you."
---
I mean, to be fair, this IS really funny.
---
WHAT?!!!! It hurts to know you weren't using headphones before. Now I wonder how many of my teammates play with no headsets.
---
Lmao you know what, that‚Äôs very true. Didn‚Äôt consider that. I‚Äôd rather have them take the hatch then, don‚Äôt care in that situation. Thanks
---
DL is a perk that makes you play a 3vs1 trial.
---
And don't worry! I was nice enough to put it back afterwards :p
---
Earn it? Being faster than survivors mean it's only a matter of when, not if.

Its not about ranking up
---
Its about sending a message
---
Literally the whole point of this Update/Battle Pass/Expansion is to keep the game alive and well.
---
You aren‚Äôt required to spend ANY amount of money if you don‚Äôt want to, because the only thing you unlock from the Battle Pass is cute collectable/cosmetic stuff for more hardcore Fans of the game. Plus you can even earn the Auric Cells back.
---
Everyone complaining because **hurr durr BattlePass bad because FortNite bad** is clueless and raging for no reason. BHVR handled the Tome and Archives very well.
---
Don‚Äôt be angry just because mom won‚Äôt let you use her Credit Card. You spend just $10 for a bunch of cosmetics, items, loot, and the opportunity to earn your money back. I literally do not see why you‚Äôre so upset at a multiple-year old Game trying to earn extra funds to keep the game alive, populated and interesting
---
Play another game, watch movies, read books, go socialize... It's ok to leave the game for a while.
---
Hex perks because theres a chance they can be broken before they're even used. Certain perks like object of obsession and babysitter which reveals your aura to the killer if you wanna use them. Exhaustion perks too since you can only use them once every 40 seconds. Dead hard especially, because you have to time it to get any use out of it. Theres plenty of more examples, though.

Me too. r/gaybros
---
Out of all the toxicity, this is what you complain about?
---
I love it. Would make a tiny TR doctor on Lery's terrifying.
---
I actually want unique chase music for all killers although then this is a problem because it leads to "metagaming" where as soon as the TR music starts survivors could figure out what killer you're playing. 
---
It might not be as big of a deal with Doctor though because often as soon as the match starts you immediately figure out it's the Doc when electricity appears around peoples feet and they start screaming.
---
How? I never agreed to farming. I just wanted to play the game how it‚Äôs suppose to be played.
---
fuck me i touched a nerve
---
&gt; You disregard everything written
---
as if you're a reliable narrator lmao I have seen endless posts just like yours crying the exact same way and when they post their "evidence" it's always them fucking up
---
&gt; Rank 2 survivor and like a Rank 5 killer before the reset
---
oh sorry I didn't realize you were Very Important
---
What do you call toxic if this isn‚Äôt? I couldn‚Äôt even do shit my guy.
---
ty! :)
---
thanks so much! :)
---
yes, earn it. Do you think you just walk up to them and it just happens?
---
lmfao
---
Just under 1600 hours. I've never felt the need. The only people I see using headsets are in SWF discord calls.
---
I think he was trying to be funny, I dunno

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/djtjmo/first_time_seeing_this_bug/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
They used to do that here too. They stopped for some reason though... not sure why. 
---
I don't think it's because they started trusting people though.
---
i wanna know how you figured that out because i played killer a lot and i stay play as killer, i used to be rank 1 and i have a lot of points spent on killers i play, but ok :P
---
anyways thanks for the toxic comment i guess lmao

2. 2.BRITISHshort underpants worn by women or girls.
---
Probably a beta-product or something fan-made.
---
Yeah this is definitely a douchebag move by them, but I wouldn't call it toxic
---
weird how someone who totally plays killer and was even rank one has literally never ever ever ever posted about playing killer
---
why you gotta lie tho
---
These guy can eat a dong seriously i spent 30 dollars on special edition and now they want me to buy a battle oass are you serious
---
When I can tell someone is lower skill than the rest or just not at all toxic, I let them get hatch or farm and get the door when they're the last one alive.
---
Okay, My new build will be Prove Thyself, Decisive, Inner Strength and Resilience
---
I mean pass sorry
---
I appreciate the responses, I can get why that change would be bad! Thanks!
---
F13 had so much potential but it was screwed over by bugs and the lawsuit....
---
I'd sooner recommend power levelling Nea to get it (also worth it since she also gives you Urban Evasion). Personally I'd recommending saving shards for perks on characters that you don't already own, especially on licensed killers that you'd have to pay for (I've somehow managed to get all three of Bubba's perks without having to buy him, thanks to the shrine)
---
‚Äúmine should be psychedelic hippy music, ahehehe.‚Äù
---
Death to the incels!
---
all she is doing is delaying her death
---
THATS OUR WORD BUT YOU CAN SAY KNICKAS
---
Hey man, boobs are neat. Don't hate on boobs
---
That really hurts me to the core. I seen one of your other comments, so it's good that you now know that sound is important for both sides in this game. Headsets and spinechill, does wonders in this game. Both of those allowed me to avoid Myers, and hear him snatch my teammate off the gen we were doing. Had me shaking.
---
You‚Äôre insane if you think not. I bet you‚Äôd hate it if you got knocked by the killer and T-bagged by your teammates to get hit repeatedly and killed on hook.
---
Denying me of the last Hook using exploits
---
It's basically a comedy skit. I mean, it sucks you weren't in on the joke but it's just goofy. Idk. If it was longer than like four hits I might be upset myself but idk man. Watching a killer just hang out and wait for somebody to finish bandaging is funny to me. Really polite serial killer.
---
So you are just an idiot huh? My bad. But Try to stay on topic!, There's certainly clips out there already of good pallet stuns and blinds that don't go through, I would just add to the pile. The game is surely bugged. Additionally Rank 2- Rank 5- Meaning I've played vs Good survivors and killers and have been blinded/stunned successfully with the same or even with worse timing. Rank 2 and Rank 5 meaning I actually understand how the game works. Which is about all their worth for dbd as I don't care much for them.
---
Edit- Seriously why do I always get you kids? It wasn't worth it the first time and it certainly didn't change for the 30th random that can race off topic like an idiot
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
If something ever requires the label 'I don't want to be mean', just don't say it, or phrase it in a way where it's not warranted. Doesn't matter what you say after 'I don't want to be mean', there's a 99% likelihood it'll be a douche thing to say anyways. The good old saying 'If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all' is very applicable in situations like these
---
And that's the problem. I'm not asking for a return of the 80% of the screen that was initially on the PTB, but the radius is way too tight right now, especially with the bug where your character model is considered to block exposing him.
---
cmonBruh
---
I got hit over and over and over and over then killed on hook bruh.
---
If men have them they're unhealthy
---
Did they hook you and let the other survivors escape?
---
Disgusting? Nah, it's an easy win - just genrush the poor fool
---
There are plenty of survivors out there that will DC at the slightest provocation - someone else DCed, they've played against a particular killer too many times, they don't like the map, they've had bad experiences with certain killers on certain maps, they brought a set of perks that helps them against some killers but not the one they were matched against, and so on
---
Yes
---
yes, yes. you are an exceptionally accomplished person, i'm sure, and you are a victim of the game. your plays are perfect
---
Then yeah those cunts are toxic lmao
---
I had this happen to me as well in haddonfield. I was able to dead hard and got him to swing at his teamate survivor before he caught me a minute later and I dc.
---
Survivors don't have the choice of what killer they get
---
People forget that sometimes
---
Yes, Nea's other perks are mediocre. But eventually I would swap to dead hard when you get that.
---
I'd recommend hanging onto your shards to get DLC Killers/Survivors, or perks that are locked behind paywalls from any Licensed Killer. You can farm Bloodpoints endlessly, which will allow you to unlock Nea's teachables for free.
---
I would advise against being tempted by the "1 week only!" pressure. Balanced Landing will always be attainable, next week there might be a perk you really want but have no more shards left to get it. The grind for shards is much slower than BP.
---
Amazing artwork. Keep up the good work. ‚ò†Ô∏è
---
Just do what I'm doing, ride the free track until the end of the two months, then see if you're far enough to justify buying the premium.
---
I think you may have misunderstood my points.
---
A) The survivor blocks the ghostface reveal in some capacity
---
B) The natural 'center' where people look at isn't the actual center of the screen, making it un-intuitive
---
C) None of this is explicitly stated, making it one of the hardest mechanics for new players.
---
Paper mache, paint, puddy, and straps
---
Can you wait for a fucking week to repost this shit...
---
Yes :D
---
If less than 2 gens were completed, like in the old system, the hatch should not spawn.
---
Instead, when the third survivor dies, the gates should power and the EGC should start.
---
The last survivor still has a chance, it just isn't an easy 7000 points for doing nothing.
---
You can. I changed the button mash binding to R1 so I don't destroy any of the shape buttons.
---
My only problem with iron will is stridor counters it so is it really that op when most killers have that perk? Just saying.
---
That‚Äôs a really fair assessment. Thanks ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
Tbh Friday the 13th is one of the funniest games I have ever played. If you have friends play it with them and you will have a blast. The jankiness and awful graphics along with the bugs and glitches combine to make one of the most fun games ever even when I hated the core gameplay itself.
---
I‚Äôve never heard of this? Is it for every killer or what
---
I see it, I laugh, I post it end of history I‚Äôm not checking last weak feed to see if a can post something or not... why u dont go last week post and upvote lad ‚úåüèº
---
The Lawsuit was never the problem, the devs gave a shit about their game and ruined it totally, the lawsuit was just a excuse
---
The reason I asked for the original instead of just searching it is most artists have a shit load of comics. I don't care about his other comics I want to see what the original comic says and I'm not going to sift through multiple pages of Google to find one that specific comic.
---
People already dc for hatch, you think they won't dc for extra bp on top of hatch?
---
The fuck's wrong about drinking milk?

Video is by [Ohtofu](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqpGXoLSDNEUrBfACKnAhVA) i just linked it
---
i like your toxicity you know, it makes me feel better.
---
please stop thinking you know everything about someone because of what you see in a low use reddit profile with 6 posts in this subreddit (4 screenshots/shitposts and 2 suggestions)
---
wow u sound extremely accomplished and i am extremely impressed
---
This is no lie me.. if they don't get it after two attempts or t bag like I missed up... You're dead
---
Probably should put a /s because people can't tell sarcasm.
---
bby u have no idea how toxic i am
---
regardless if you play killer or not (you don't) you're still an absolute damp sock for thinking wiggling needs a buff lmfao
---
Honestly this is pretty accurate.
---
You're the one who's socially awkward dude lol Usually you guys are a bit more entertaining, Being wrong and still defending it but you're moving around too much
---
Just Bubba
---
It‚Äôs the first one on his ig. His ig is the first link in a google search.
---
who r u calling u guys
---
If I get far enough to unlock the next one,  I'm going to buy.  If you buy near the end,  it unlocks everything before it.  Win win!  The only thing with that is you don't get to utilise the cosmetics till the end.  Will be like Christmas getting them all at once though!
---
I love that it gives you enough cells for the next season, just hope the challenges don't get too hard üòµ
---
This video is great for all the old school BS this game used to have for all you newer players. Rip pink perks!
---
Totally fair game. Struggling means they haven't surrendered themselves to your infinite mercy, and thus are unworthy of it.
---
Lol i dont think prestige-ing was ever really supposed to do something besides get you a cosmetic set for a killer you really like. This is a really bad idea imo. Ive been trying to get every survivor perk so i can make jane my main and its been a long time (maybe abt three months) and i still have like five or six survivors to go so making it to where i have to p3 them will make the grind ubearable and would turn off 99% of players me included.
---
don't go for the trophies, it will end your suffering :)
---
after ranks are reset, its easier to pip up. for plague, i had to beg ppl in the lobby prematch to help me out. but to my credit i did get an adept killer as her before they came out with a fix that was missing at the time that made the trophy possible to get in the first place
---
Wait it's free on pc? The switch game costs 45 bucks!
---
Hahaha yeah I ended up with most of them by accident. I'm just so close now that I wanna go for it
---
I've heard about this being possible in KYF but I haven't seen this in an actual match. Can tell because the perks aren't all level 3.
---
good! Its a great perk in theory, but in game (in my opinion) its not the best
---
Storytime.
---
I was playing Hag and within the first minute I got a Claudette in the basement.
---
The Ash shows up as I'm walking out of the basement and runs past me to save her, so I hit him, chase him down and down him after he saves her. I end up hooking her too, didn't feel great about it as she got farmed, I was hoping he had borrowed time.
---
The Dwight shows up and does the same thing to Ash and Claudette. I deliberately let her go and rehook farming Ash and Dwight, they both kill themselves on hook and Claudette proceeds to be really toxic when I find her again, so naturally I down her and hook her and she dies.
---
Less than four minutes into the game and we're down to just a poor baby Meg. I find her and down her, and carry her to the ruin, so she can cleanse it and take the hatch since her teammates fuckin dumb-dumb jamboree in the basement fucked her so hard.
---
Then she proceeds to ignore my gestures and RUNS, this chase lasts almost 15 minutes of Meg just following her slowly gesturing to the hatch and ruin each time we pass them, and also hitting pallets in case she wanted to drop them on my head. And she never gets the message and its just BOOKING it from me terrified. So I leave her alone and find her like 10 minutes later after going to make a coffee, and she's just hiding.
---
At this point I just mercy kill her. I felt horrible but it was apparent this was going to be my whole night. And in postgame chat the meg says "GG :)" and the other three waited that entire time to call me a camper. (Keep in mind I didn't even get the chance to leave the basement or even set traps.)
---
Rank reset is a helluva drug.
---
"What's up guys" Is a genderless welcome, and I'm using "Guys" in that sense. Though I'm referring to the many people i've had the displeasure of running into, Each stupid beyond believe with no interest in anything but to continue the conversation, I've actually lost count as to how many exactly since i tend to excuse them and be on my way, sorta like this.
---
Excuse you.
---
that was a lot more wholesome then i thought it would be, thanks brother &lt;3
---
It was really fun but it's sad that all the fun came from everything they messed up lol
---
Nice Wraith mind game.
---
Last game, I had some other survivor farm me off the hook in the basement and the killer, a P3 Nurse, didn't even try to hit the other guy but went straight after me, 2 times.
---
I don't understand people sometimes.
---
They had a lot of content unfinished and knew about the lawsuit, they could've launched it incomplete and then fiz after the lawsuit... It's dumb
---
it goes both ways. there's a video of otz being revealed by a hooked survivor behind a wall, 10 meters away. no instinct at all
---
wow i did not ask for a novel
---
That makes sense, I'd be placed against survivors lower than my normal rank. Maybe I'll wait until next reset to keep trying
---
Close enough i guess xD
---
It wasn't a brag, I was explaining I've been on both sides of it and can give examples from personal experience.  I don't know why you asked a question and then attack people and cry when they answer honestly.
---
His name is Art the Clown but his methods and mannerisms are definitely akin to a mime. (I agree with you about the name though)
---
Lmao that was great
---
They're repercussions nonetheless. If anything, they at least require you to do something. Iron will is just a bonus for nothing other than getting hit.
---
Art. Absolute fucking art. Hang this in the Vatican.
---
A soul for a soul
---
This game does charge you for most cosmetics barely any of the cosmetics in the game can be bought with iradesiant shards
---
The rights were quite literally lost, preventing them from adding anything else to the game. That's not just an excuse, that's LITERALLY being unable to do anything no matter what, so. It was definitely THE problem.
---
I dont think hearing the TR to find out what killer it is is a problem since we already have that w/ the demogorgon
---
Hey, at least we enjoy it. I would much prefer it for it to be like that than some just random generic slasher game.
---
Loved this
---
Please don't mistake my pity for kindness, I thought I should clarify that this time
---
TRYING TO MAIN SPIRIT AND CAN NEVER HIT ANYONE STRAIGHT AFTER A PHASE WALK! HOW THE FUCK DO I DOWN ANYONE WITHOUT A TWO MINUTE CHASE OUTSIDE OF PHSE WALK
---
she doesnt pull out a guitar
---
they tried it with the reworked Freddy too. as well as Demogorgon and Ghostface, but so far, BHVR seems to have brushed them off.
---
If they die though, you are given the whole team a detriment. Unless they die first with 1 gen to go, this is a big bonus to snowballing.
---
Dying light is a win win perk in my book.
---
Thank the dad gods
---
wow i did not ask for a leaflet
---
He never said they weren't???
---
This is why flip flop exists
---
Adding way more pointless grinding seems ridiculous, prestige has and always should be just some weird skin/bragging right for people who like to grind
---
So just a cosmetic cash grab, got it; never mind the list of fixes this game needs.
---
Ehh I'd rather play against a prayer bead spirit or three/omega blink nurse than a Hillbilly. His hitboxes are the worst in the game by far and his map pressure is so frustrating because he's literally always around so patrolling hooks or gens is easy. He gets all the benefits of camping with none of the downsides since he can leave the hook so easily and come right back, crossing back and forth in seconds.
---
But mostly just those hitboxes.
---
From what I can tell the paid-battlepass is just cosmetics and Auric Cells (supposedly enough grinding earns you back the costs of the pass), and Bloodpoints come from doing the free stuff. Not a huge deal IMO since the game's had paid cosmetics since September 2016.
---
By that logic, all perks are just bonuses for getting hit or evading getting hit.
---
I just learned about this game and it having Ash is pushing me a lot more toward getting it
---
I find your intolerance of lactose.... disturbing
---
I'm totally prepared for that!
---
I'll try Freddy, thanks. I thought he'd be a bit difficult, however. I rarely see anyone play him that much at my rank, but I guess he could be considered more of a beginner-level killer.
---
I've heard a bit of him but never really checked him out. Thanks!
---
yeah, the sound it makes is always consistent so it is weird that this Ghost didn't act as if they heard it
---
unable to pick up pepole when they recover? well this is fair
---
Like DBD. I think the pass is fine but their 10 bucks for one outfit is still cray cray
---
Yes, seems faster now.  I'm in UK, ps4.
---
i think nurse and freddy have worse hitboxes, but i can see why people dont like billy. I do think he is super fun though
---
well nothing changed you will still go down in one hit
---
im saying that recover atm is COMPLETELY useless because even when the killer makes multiple bad choises after downing a survivor it doesn't matter because he gets away with it anyways
---
Hex: you're gay
---
This is called unbalanced, recovering is fine as it is. Why should it be even easier for survivors as when you go against a strong swf you have to slug. Yet they have coms and insane coordination so you‚Äôre making it easier.
---
You have to understand that some perks are op on some killers.
---
Now that you mention it, I do see a lot of potential here. If it's used in combination with Ruin, the SWF would become a sweep team that take out all of the totems in 2 minutes. Without Hex Master, Ruin instead gets taken our in 2 minutes. So from that point of view it doesn't make a lot of difference, but it will help and that helps.
---
How do I play against freddy. I don't get his mechanics anymore and the decription for it confuses me. Asleep or awake he still hits me. Is it just asleep means you can get dream pallets or something? 
---
Whats the best strat to play against him?
---
Nice. Do you recommend Nurse's Calling over Discordance/vice-versa, or are they pretty equal?
---
Player counts have been steady for the past month at 23k, and on average have literally never been higher. No one is concerned about the player count or the game dying or being put on life support. This is a mute point. Game is healthy as of now. You know when it won't be? When there's no new Killer or Survivors and people have to grind out Archives that they have to pay $10 to get anything interesting out of. Because they wanted another track for monetization.
---
Base Game - $19.99 ($29.99 for deluxe)
---
All Current Chapter DLC - Approximately $90.00 USD
---
If you want access to every chapter, along with the base game, it's $110 minimum. Or you can do research and find out which chapters have the perks you'll literally need to play competitively, like Hex: Ruin.
---
And then there's cosmetics, which are very pricey, some of them reaching up to $18.
---
But yes, by all means, Behavior really needs that extra $10 for content you've probably already paid for.
---
I don't think you or anyone else has the right to decide "Who is more of a fan" because they don't want to waste $10 on a Battle Pass to waste more time grinding it out to earn the shit they paid for and their money back (which, btw, you can only spend on DbD again because virtual currency).
---
If you want to throw your allowance money or Walmart stockboy salary away and promote and encourage more stupid and greedy decisions from Behavior, go ahead. But please don't pretend you have any idea what you're talking about.
---
I'm not upset, I'm disappointed in the lack of integrity and the waste of resources given the current state of the game and it's balance, and in the playerbase for accepting and encouraging this.
---
I love it when Doctors won‚Äôt commit to the chase and just want to block your pallet stun instead with a shock. Just throw the bitch early and you‚Äôll keep that chase going forever lol
---
Distortion also doesnt work while downed while bbq does. All it does is encourage slugging.
---
Not if you use unbreakable, tenacity, no mother, flip flop. Or if your team heals you. You clearly don‚Äôt play this game at high level if you think survivors need a buff
---
I used to have people escape hatch all the time. I started slugging the 3rd and it helps so much. I hate ‚Äúlosing‚Äù a match because of a lucky hatch spawn.
---
It's optional to buy premium. You get stuff for free too
---
I got it earlier, didn‚Äôt lose pips just got error
---
Watching Trump supporters cry at how the world hates Trump is hilarious.  The pretense that no one could criticize Trump without criticizing the liberals or they are "hypocrites" really just shows the Trumpets have no understanding what that word means. 
---
Being hypocrites would be STILL ranting about Hillary's email when the Trump's have been using unauthorized mail servers (with zero government oversight) since the election.  Being hypocrites would be claiming Clinton would have tried to start a war with Iran when Trump tried just a month ago.  Being hypocrites would be slamming Obama for drone strikes when Trump DOUBLED the number of drone strikes after he took office. 
---
THAT is being a hypocrite, kiddo.
---
Nah I'd rather stand there waiting for the killer to chase me like that one wraith told me last night. Called me a toxic gen rusher.
---
Leatherface‚Äôs thing is that he wears faces, meg, Dwight, jake, and Claudette can all be worn as faces on bubba
---
Maybe when they start putting out lootboxes because people are into this shit.
---
&gt; no mother
---
please don't being my personal life issues into this thanks i feel very attacked
---
Trump supporters simply can't wrap their heads around the fact that the world despises Trump and get so upset that reddit doesn't trash people who aren't as shitty as Trump.
---
Awh man this makes me sad. F13 was soo fun. Way less toxic. Also nothing was funnier then Jason chasing you and saying ‚Äúima getcha‚Äù or doing vocal mind games like ‚Äúhehe I‚Äôm hopping through this window‚Äù
---
Sounds were broken back there. You coudn't hear footsteps, grass.
---
if a killer leaves a survivor downed it‚Äôs usually to go after another survivor, right? recovering means that by the time someone else, or the survivor they‚Äôve gone after if they‚Äôre good at running the killer around, gets back to you you‚Äôve literally got a couple of seconds of heal to get back up. if you‚Äôre downed for ages and no one picks you up, that‚Äôs on your team mates. doesn‚Äôt mean recovery is broken and needs changed
---
They wanted me to kill their teammate because "he is a troll". I just ignored that message and just continued playing. These people ran after me and began crouching and looking at me, i smacked them and even downed one but they didnt run away. 
---
That guy clearly tried violating the rules lmao
---
The amount of typos I‚Äôve had today,my heads fuckedüòÇüòÇ
---
I want to play killer because I'd like to change things up a bit and see what I can do.
---
In lore and to go against, Freddy. Just seems fun to me.
---
Not really sure about my favorite aspects or favorite stories.
---
I prefer slashers, but it's whatever.
---
Thanks for the answer, I wasn't expecting questions back &lt;3
---
You do realize not every killer runs noed. This killer actually played well and was rather pleasant about the situation. I genuinely refuse your garbage meme in the name of this doctor's integrity.
---
He looks like a Myers, but his posture says ‚ÄúBing Bing boi‚Äù
---
lol
---
Okay ill be in your kitchen in 5
---
That's true as well.
---
And I'd recommend one of Ussylis' new vids. I'm pretty sure it's not the most recent one but the one before it. He goes into pretty good detail about juking or running from the spirit properly. And he's one of the better survivors I know
---
Litterally happened to me last night. I let the Claud go to save the Ace about to die on ground but she hid right behind shack to heal and let him die
---
I usually do this cause I've already prove I can kill them. The exception is if they have been teabagging and flashlight click spamming.
---
Doctor and Clown are garbage compared to Freddy, Billy and Nurse :) They are garbage compared to anyone but Legion actually.
---
Nah, I'm not trying to tunnel, so I might just try to find someone else.. I'll try those killers, thank you! Thanks for the advice and being so thorough &lt;3
---
Oh yea, didn't even notice the threshold
---
True  Also tenacity
---
Aww I'm sorry üòî
---
I want you to be forced to play 100 games against good Spirit.
---
YOU WILL BREAK!
---
If survivors know what you're doing it's not gonna work.  
---
Those addons are basically making a really strong killer, garbage tier...
---
but then the killer can pick me up and that opens a whole other can of worms
---
It‚Äôs free for Xbox on gold
---
You're either completely missing the point, or trolling deliberately at this point if you're comparing Spirit to wraith
---
Just because of this post, I will not spare another single Dwight, ever.
---
Again. Your name claims to have object of obsession. You're probably the type of Survivor to insult Killers for not playing away you like. And you probably play against lower-ranked killers. At least that's what I'm basing my theory off of due to the fact that you're just throwing out insults and dismissing most arguments.
---
You shouldn't be able to run from all of the killers the same way. There should be Killers you have to hide from. There should be Killers you have to run from like doctor for example who discourages stealth but no one complains about since he's easy to Loop. Spirit is the polar opposite of doctor. Do not be spotted by her. Get the generators done and Escape as quickly as possible. She punishes greed
---
Since when was variety of gameplay a Bad Thing? Could you imagine if every boss fight in a Dark Souls game had to be beaten the same way? Instead of playing against them differently? That would be incredibly boring and easy.
---
As a survivor main I love killers who show mercy, but it is very hard to know if the killer is going to let one go, so I wiggle everytime to have a slight chance.
---
So, how am I supposed to know if a killer if a killer is a nice one or not? Should I just do nothing and hope for the best? :/
---
You shouldve put the lil hat on the cat!
---
I don‚Äôt tunnel either. I‚Äôm just saying that in this scenario, it‚Äôs acceptable. Survivors are responsible for unhooking others safely. If they unhook in front of your face, you could punish them by hitting the injured survivor.
---
But it‚Äôs good that you don‚Äôt want to do that. It‚Äôs about everyone having fun. And being tunneled isn‚Äôt fun
---
&gt; Everything is muted.
---
Have you ever heard the GHHWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWHHHHHH?
---
It sounds like you're implying Hillbilly and Spirit are like two peas in a pod in terms of usability and counterplay
---
&gt; are you playing with a controller??
---
shit i dunno let me ask them
---
Just play the game and have fun. stop worrying about what other think is toxic. As long as you don‚Äôt go out of your way to make somebody else miserable you‚Äôre fine. Do you think the meg thought about your feelings when when she ran you for 3 gens. Hell no. Was it toxic? Fuck no. She was you playing the game and having fun. Stop overthinking shit for no reason bro
---
hey are you playing with a controller?
---
My first experience with this was literally Confused-Shock and Horror followed by a brief chase that ended in confirmation.
---
Well how the fuck would I know if I didn't even know the game existed
---
Why did you record this on your phone?
---
Knickers
---
Cause it what I had on me it was an Xbox clip but now I record on a still iPad
---
Yuup, Standard Xbox One controller
---
It doesn't it's pretty impossible figuring out somebody is running distortion during the match.
---
Actually this update adds what a lot of people have been crying about for years, new objectives. The pass is just monetization. The tome is what is really interesting. It gives new objectives to complete and then you are rewarded with new storylines and blood points. 
---
Stop looking at just the negatives and look at the positives too.
---
okay thx
---
Recovering is fine and you‚Äôre not supposed to be able to get up even if they leave you down for a bit, it‚Äôs exactly like wiggling.
---
I would run Unbreakable if you‚Äôre running into the problem a lot.
---
People finally just started figuring out how busted she can be.
---
I knew this weeks after launch after playing several times against a friend who had dumped all of his free time into Spirit. It was an awful experience.
---
Ah yes, directly from Otz' stream
---
Issa joke
---
Scoops Ahoy Steve mains are the real team players out here.
---
Anytime!
---
Lmao, that game we don't talk about. Nicely done, mate
---
I wouldnt say he is a super beginner character. More like if you get a head start using him now, you will dominate later. He is potentially the 3rd best killer in the game now and you will definitely see why after you use him a bunch
---
That‚Äôs an interesting take, but no.
---
I literally only got one stalk stab in that game and it was on the one dude I killed at the end. I tried to message him to tell him he can leave, BUT THE DUDE DIDN'T SPEAK ENGLISH so every time I dropped him near the door he'd just leave immediately.
---
When that happens to me as survivor, it feels a little petty. It's like, dude, I didn't even mess with you or taunt or teabag or loop you all match. So wtf? Hook me if you want, but don't make it a big old dickish production when I was chill with you the all match.
---
I go out of my way not to be an asshole, so it feels that much more petty and extra.
---
yeah it's a controller but I've said it's happened multiple times, I've played both killer and survivor, Rank 2 survivor and like a Rank 5 killer before the reset (when I played a lot) 
---
There's certainly clips out there already of good pallet stuns and blinds that don't go through, I would just add to the pile. The game is surely bugged. Additionally Rank 2- Rank 5- Meaning I've played vs Good survivors and killers and have been blinded/stunned successfully with the same or even with worse timing. Rank 2 and Rank 5 meaning I actually understand how the game works. Which is about all their worth for dbd as I don't care much for them.
---
I'm a red rank killer....every month dude.  But nice assumption again assuming it's impossible to defend gens outside of potato ranks.  Again your disbelief of this fact speaks volumes about your personal play.  It is possible to play to end games with 1 or more gens up.  Entire S Tier loadouts dedicated to this very thing.  And more killers are viable at accomplishing this than just Nurse and Spirit though they make that very easy to achieve.  Freddy is phenomenal for ending games with gens up as is Hag and Billy has always been a top tier killer.
---
Hard to say. This is my personal way to play but that doesn't mean any other killers do it (some do, but my point is there isn't some rule saying they must).
---
As the last survivor I never wiggle and maybe 1/10 times they end up taking me to the hatch. 2/10 times they take me to hatch then hook me right next to it LOL
---
I just started running tenacity, flip flop, unbroken, and boil over for shits and giggles. It's pretty fun honestly
---
Ive probably got 1000 hours on Hag alone, i promise you it works wonders if you know what maps to do it on and how to do it.
---
Check out Humanwithlimbs it's his format
---
&gt; it‚Äôs exactly like wiggling.
---
please buff/change wiggling
---
its just so tiring and frustrating to wiggle, 99% of the time is useless, i've seen scenarios when the killer misses like 3-5 attacks trying to hit a survivor when carrying someone and still walks 30m to the hook like nothing happened, and even if they dont try to hit someone, the distance they are able to carry a survivor for (without agitation or iron grasp) is disgusting
---
and probably the most wiggle escapes are from people that get caught on the bottom of the huge wooden house in the swamp, otherwise its almost impossible
---
imo they should lower the wiggle bar timer 2,3 or 4 secs or make the killer suffer more when someone is wiggling bc as a killer when someone wiggles its like meh
---
You could loosely call those "New Objectives" yes, the same way you can call Daily Rituals "Objectives". But that's not really being honest with what players mean when they've said they want additional objectives in the game besides holding M1 on a generator.
---
idiots do it, as a killer main i neither see the fun
---
Only -200 IQ people let camping affect the game.
---
It's basically handing the generators to you.
---
Zeb89 is already on your ass (italian top dbd streamer)
---
&gt; This is absolutely not an exaggeration when i say the past 15 games i‚Äôve played, every single killer has slugged, camped, and tunneled.
---
Narrator: this was absolutely an exaggeration
---
What's the archives? Is this the battle pass thing they're talking about? Because I don't know why they're doing it or what's going to happen with it
---
FUCKING   
---
S H O C K E D
---
Imagine snidely replying with a critique to a comment that wasn‚Äôt made. Grow a brain.
---
I'm the same. If I accidentally tunnel I just leave 'em and let someone pick them up.
---
wtf have you got parkinsons
---
Hahahah. I know right?
---
Someone who worked on a previous film wanted money. And sued the game. Pretty much what I gathered
---
While camping is just straight up ineffective and no decent killer does it unless under specific circumstances, it should be noted that ‚Äútunneling‚Äù is often times unintentional. If your team is better than you at avoiding the killer, it‚Äôs only natural that you‚Äôre gonna be the one that‚Äôs getting found, and it would be dumb for the killer to just ignore you for the sake of avoiding ‚Äútunneling‚Äù
---
Got what?
---
Its happened. I consider perks kind of enhancing your strengths and/or lessening your weaknesses.
---
A lich sounds like a cool killer concept honestly ü§î
---
YOUR FUCKING WELCOME!
---
Whoever edited this should be ashamed.
---
that would be a neat thing for the demogorgon they could put a portal over the hatch so that survivors need to get rid of it to use a key or jump in
---
Damn, evan's handsome!
---
Can't you only use his unique perks for the trophy though?
---
yeh ofc its happened multiple times because wiggling like that doesn‚Äôt work. i‚Äôve played both sides for nearly 2 years at those ranks and played it during times where it was virtually unplayable with bugs and deeply unbalanced, and i believe i have a pretty good standing when i say this game isn‚Äôt bugged or killer biased. a strong survivor group, even without swf, can bully a killer into the ground with the right perks and items. give up self care and an exhaustion perk for team based perks like kindred or prove thyself and the game can go completely differently. 
---
i‚Äôm just not going to comment on when you think you should have got the wiggle or a stun/blind because i‚Äôm not there to witness it and can‚Äôt pin point any times personally or in videos where i‚Äôve seen it be so unfair, but i can say i‚Äôve never thought it was SO broken that you need to nerf a basic killer mechanic lol
---
Can you buy individual pieces? I'd prefer 3 whole bodies with no weapons.
---
One must live to tell the tale!
---
so why do you browse then?
---
Both of them had given up and werent running away, so i let them both farm. They got 4 gens for free and i thought it would be funny to kill one. I laughed and the one who got away laughed the one who died called me an ass. I let people live, i let them farm, i dont tunnel, dont camp. I do plenty of things to not be an ass but sometimes its fun to mess with people. Sorry if its upsetting you but some people find this funny.
---
That‚Äôs interesting. I‚Äôm really new to DbD, so I had no idea that Ghostface wasn‚Äôt *the* Ghostface.
---
Thank you for explaining and being patient with me.
---
you didn't ask me but i'd say they are great perks, try em both
---
Jane still died üò≠
---
You're saying they shouldn't be adding anything to the game until the bugs are fixed, since you didn't explicitly say it doesn't mean you didn't mean that.
---
shit sorry i forgot that
---
Yeah you can do No Mither Sabo with a few different perks Resilience works well too but we were just rolling with Unbreakable for the faster recovery in case he switched targets to the other one.
---
100% agree with you on Head On and I told him how dissapointed I was in him for not being able to do it as the 4th instead of Adrenaline.  He still doesn't own Jane.  I told him to to save his 9k shards for her so we have Head On available for next round.  That perk is so much fun and you could meme up a Storm with it.
---
Yesterday someone DC'd because he walked into two consecutive hag traps and got downed because of it. He walked into the trap near my Ruin, i hit him, he ran straight up the Chapel stairs and walked into another for an easy down. Have to say, it was hilarious.
---
dude there is no diffrence in wiggling in a circular motion or pushing it to the side its all the same speed man
---
im not suggesting that wiggle should let you escape easy peasy im saying that in certain situations (really specific and a very low %) where you should be able to escape by wiggling it doesnt happen because of how wiggle works right now and that it's what IMO makes the wiggle experience a total waste of time and needs a very slight buff
---
The thing about Huntress or Billy revs is that depending on who has less information on how good the survivor/ killer is, you can usually "outskill" the opponent.
---
Is the Billy running Hex Ruin? If yes, feel free to greed every pallet cause his dumbass is gonna rev up at each and every one and spend 3 gens chasing you, constantly resetting bloodlust.
---
Does the huntress have any reason to believe you're good? If not, run through your first pallet cause she'll most likely raise her hatchet.
---
But then after that it's a little more than just rock paper scissors. Huntress' dynamicism allows her to hold her hatchet up at a loop, and while the survivor turns the bed behind the rock the pallet is resting up against, there is actually a small gap the huntress can throw her charged hatchet through which the survivor didn't know about. Or *does* know about, while the huntress zones them into a position where the survivor is trying to juggle being in a straightshot or visible through the crack.
---
Or Billy can just simply rev his chainsaw for a small crack, but if the survivor knows the Billy knows his shit, drops the pallet anyway, and now billy has to wait for his rev animation to finish before getting the option to kick the pallet. OR he can have chainsaw proc'd as he eats the pallet, proc's Spirit Fury, and carries the charge over.
---
Survivors can also be baited out of safe windows simply by a killer sound proc- this is often the case with Demo.
---
There's back and forth and a collection of behaviour stacking up in both players' minds. On top of the general game of DBD that is all about map pressure, herding survivors to correct locations and keeping everyone on their toes, or ditching survivors with too strong of tools in a certain area who would waste too much time commiting to.
---
Hell, sometimes "correct plays" against good survivors just *don't work* on bad survivors. It's important you understand the person's *behaviour* you're going against.
---
**Spirit on the other hand** you get zero information about what they did to get a hit on you. She phases for *far* too long, far too frequently. Dead ass you can't tell the difference between someone *brand new* and someone who has 1000 hours sometimes, because it's entirely possible to play unoptimally as Spirit and still get in hits because survivors don't know what you're doing and you happen to bump into them.
---
Yeah, she can take some practice to get *really* efficient with, but outside of just flat out playing immersed survivors don't have stuff to learn or exploit against every individual spirit. It's literally a coin toss in favour of spirit every time she phases.
---
You use Ghost face
---
Np lol. I was like f*ck I could've been using ruin this whole time?
---
I mostly chose the ones where the faces were up close and center. GF is an acceptable swap in too
---
So if they close the app then I don‚Äôt get my points, and if they use the in-game menu I do get them? Or vice versa?
---
Congrats on doing the most generic Killer play you could've posted
---
haha it would make everything 1000 times easier
---
‚ÄúRings Bell‚Äù
---
Shame!
---
No kidding
---
honestly i like the voice better then the original ive always thought her voice needs to be deeper even though she is a girl
---
It's a feature. Some people used to run insidious and wait behind the gate.
---
&gt; if they close the app then I don‚Äôt get my points, and if they use the in-game menu I do get them
---
this
---
Why in the actual fuck is this a thing and why did I just scroll it for 5 minutes?
---
or michael
---
At the end of the day the best advice is to do what you find fun. It's just a game after all!
---
Jane can never die!
---
Honestly Devour Hope isn‚Äôt that bad if you can get use out of it. I‚Äôd probably do Devour, Dying Light, Bitter Murmur, and Save the Best for Last.
---
death aint an escape from being a jerk
---
Good news for you! Pantsless Meyers coming soon!

Too lazy to make it look good lol

My build is dh stbfl play with your food and noed

---
The 'exposed' should pop up after she flashes him.
---
Something something metaphor something... thank u
---
You must not play a lot of survivor.
---
i wasn‚Äôt really suggesting there was a difference in speed, i‚Äôve just not ever thought it was that efficient but if it works for other people
---
You're heavily aids
---
if someone dc'd i would give them all mercy because a 3v1 is boring and easy
---
Or trans
---
oh dear that's not good
---
I feel like you're not very experienced in spirit if you think there's any amount of reasonable counterplay to her shit.
---
It‚Äôs a fucking drawing so let‚Äôs all calm down. No one cares how old you are
---
i play about 3 survivor games to 1 killer game
---
Right! :)
---
Okay dad
---
I will take solace in the fact that they are probably full of salt then
---
It‚Äôs an intentional feature
---
Ok thanks
---
Or crouching by a tree and in turn becoming said tree
---
Nobody talks in old English u boomer
---
I‚Äôm pointing out how hollow your complaints ring when they also apply to a mid-tier killer.  The only difference is that people haven‚Äôt collectively decided Wraith is OP and that the solution is to whine about it.
---
Ohhhhh
---
It didn't state she was 21, all we know is she's not under 18
---
You have every right to do that. But it‚Äôs toxic and serves no In game benefit. You get more BP for hooking. So it‚Äôs toxic as much but you‚Äôre entitled to it. Just don‚Äôt be shocked when someone says you‚Äôre toxic... bc you are! ü§°
---
Who the fuck is opposed to drinking milk lmao
---
Wow killer bm.  Never seen that before....Great content man.  Woot....
---
Noob plays seriously, he's just lighthearted about it.
---
True survivor mains know that the circle should be fully orange
---
Understandable, have a nice day

I'm sorry little one

Me: *plays game right*.          Salty killer mains: RePOrtEd

People say that all the time but I dont have that problem at all

I mean, you're not supposed to get that close to a killer anyway

Distortion doesnt activate if you're downed.

Jesus Christ I remember that. Had 4 gens pop as the game started when I was trapper. But with what you listed, did you just watch OhTofu's new video? Barely anyone remembers that shit anymore. It's only down to the Alpha and 1.0.0. players that do
---
I just meant in general it's good that it doesn't

killers get stuck on shit, too

oh ok thanks

have you seen the post of the people who found the usb in a bottle that had a single phot of michael myers "exposing himself" 
---
i would link it to this thread but i dont know how to on mobile
---
Youre toxic if you: flashlight blind at pallets, Teabag, Flashlight click, taunt, dont give a killer the chance to get points, entitled
---
If you didnt do any of these things, the killer is salty that he lost
---
"You tried to cross the border, right?"
---
Damn that was smoothe

I actually have a F2M pre-op trans kid coming over to my house tomorrow if you were interested in hearing a reply to that...
---
):
---
I haven't played long enough to experience most broken stuff but I've seen other videos and heard about it. I haven't seen tofus video though
---
i gave them 4 gens and we were farming. i will just let everyone live next time since that is part of the dbd rulebook.
---
I remember it being a story area for the archives section. Prolly just has to do with the entity or smthn
---
Happened to me. I got healed, by a tree, and was being healed for the rest of the game still by a tree. Couldn‚Äôt cancel it either
---
Thats just spreading the endless circle of toxicity man
---
See ya! No one will miss you
---
Yeah, Tofu also shows the old Billy tech where you could launch yourself on harvesters. It was broken as hell back then
---
"pebble master" is monto!
---
You know what I‚Äôma bout to do to them
---
You‚Äôre never guaranteed to go down.  If you believe that you‚Äôre either a bad survivor or a defeatist, which is tantamount to the same thing.  Besides, if you‚Äôre playing survivor halfway decently you will probably take about 5-6 hits throughout a game being chased, and more if you‚Äôre any good.  You very much can learn.  That‚Äôs why it takes three hooks to kill.  If you can‚Äôt figure out a killer by then you‚Äôve been outplayed.  You have a whole team to rely on too; even without coms or SWF you can watch chases you aren‚Äôt in.  You really do have options if you‚Äôre willing to use them.
---
Or you can just complain that it‚Äôs impossible and whine until we get another Legion.  I guess that‚Äôs an option.
---
&gt;everyone throws shit everywhere and your one item adds onto the 500 other items and it is the worst bullshit.
---
like you said though it's probably a gamestop so it's a small store thankfully. I work in target and you get assigned a giant chunk of the store and god it's awful sometimes.
---
I get really pissed shopping with my mother because she literally does this. "Oh it's just one thing; it's their job to do it!" :/
---
Sure its good if you like to slug.
---
I will spare all of mine to try to even it out
---
wow amazing content,  being a dick for no reason. How novel.
---
When I slug for 4k knowing where the person I slug is is pretty good
---
God, this looks like Roblox in the Unreal Engine 2.0
---
No....
---
Any remakes are fan made, nothing official is allowed to come out though.
---
not if everyone gets hooked lmao
---
This clip is criminally underrated
---
I even do it multiple times and go to gen and hit it while they struggle or drop downed survivor at gen where others are working on it so they heal the person and they still just run. I kill them all.
---
 If a survivor realises I‚Äôm friendly and others don‚Äôt that survivor is my ‚Äúpet‚Äù and I let my pet live. I‚Äôve had my pet even point to where other survivors are hiding and t-bag when I down and hook them. It‚Äôs kind of fun to have a survivor pet, I highly recommend it.
---
I dont get why most survivor mains are toxic af but if they get cucked they leave.
---
Nope , it‚Äôs a new thing for red ranks. I agree with op post, not fun getting the 3 man swf with 2 of them being rank 10+. Playin solo is already hard.
---
The thing is that the killers  that toy around with survivors make the survivors less likely to think that it‚Äôs mercy and more like deviousness
---
On the other hand, the survivors that don‚Äôt teabag at all during games but as soon as they get to the gates or hatch they teabag the killer make killers less likely to give mercy at the thought of being teabaged
---
Nice work! :)
---
That was a pretty insane clip
---
W... What? Since when is doc almost impossible to win against? His zap is buggy, doesnt work most of the time and other than his power he's pretty much M1. Its like saying that Bubba is good lol
---
IKR please sub
---
What's up with the quality content in this sub lately? I am not complaining. Just asking. Good work!
---
you must play on pc. on console it‚Äôs much different
---
Twinsies!
---
I can't tell how much im am attracted to big monster boys I literally came in a second of seeing this image
---
huntress is free on pc
---
The three of us did, unfortunately the 4th jumped in that one tube im that center room and the killer just stood outside it until time ran out
---
Aww you're not the first to say this... It didn't expect these kind of reactions... I'm sorry :(
---
no no no. you gotta understand that ik what i‚Äôm saying. the killer would chase my team mate and see me and go for me. i‚Äôd get hooked and they‚Äôd unhook me and the killer goes for me.
---
&gt; You‚Äôre never guaranteed to go down
---
You go down "eventually enough" if the spirit you're going against isn't braindead and understands survivors' options.
---
&gt;Besides, if you‚Äôre playing survivor halfway decently you will probably take about 5-6 hits throughout a game being chased
---
If you're healing more than 4 times a match you're doing it wrong
---
&gt;If you can‚Äôt figure out a killer by then you‚Äôve been outplayed.
---
You're telling me there's *any* information to be extracted from a spirit chase? Besides the "she likes the stand still at pallet mindgame for an easy punish" thing
---
I honest to god want to watch how you play survivor or Spirit. Every time I've heard people explain "she isn't that bad" or that there is any degree of learning her mindgames, they all always run immersion builds, go down in under a minute tops, and self care in the corner of the map/ under a pallet every chance they've got.
---
I like the same characters you do.  I purchased Pig, Huntress, Spirit, and Legion. I only play the last two and I love them.
---
dude there‚Äôs 4 gens i‚Äôve has games today in an hour session be happen so fast
---
you finna go watch some survivors?
---
&gt;again assuming it's impossible to defend gens outside of potato ranks
---
Again making things up. I never claimed it's impossible, just not as incredibly simple as you make it sound. 
---
Using your logic the hatch, EGC and keys are all crutch perks since they reward the survivors for failing their easy task of just doing all the gens and Mori's aren't crutch since all the survivors have to do is easily avoid being downed. Just doing those things is  the counter so none of them are crutch. Simple.
---
The issue is she can force that 50/50 mindgame to occur a lot more often than other killers. Every other killer outside of nurse and stealth is heavily telegraphed with red mist. Stealthed killers don't get the a+ mobility she shares with nurse. The two of them are good because they have hard to predict movements that make even safe pallets unsafe compared to all other killers. You can say "just run stealth to counter" but directional hearing will always have a significant advantage at close range and any good killer is going to be watching the 10000 crows on the map for signs of movement, and if it's an indoor map nurse is insane. Iron will is good but it's not going to save you every time. All it does is increase the chance of getting away IF the killer los's you for several seconds which on these mobility kings is pretty hard to do once in a chase considering most tactics to get big breaks in vision will not work against them.
---
Honestly, they DO need to need these two killers to be more in line with the others through nerfing. That way they can actually focus on the balance of survivors and make everything a lot more competitive. These two "anti survivor meta" killers have always, and WILL always reign supreme because they:
---
1. Have significant advantages in increasing mindgame pressure
---
2. Have incredibly high mobility
---
3. Do not provide survivors a chance to rebuttle in the mindgame once they make their move. (Phase walk exit/blink)
---
4. Directly inhibit the survivors strongest methods of prolonging a chase.
---
5. Can run detection perks to counter their primary weaknesses.
---
6. Are significantly more forgiving when you mess up a chase. ( Don't tell me a couple seconds of blink stun is enough to lose a good nurse more than 5% of the time.)
---
Maybe more people are following this sub? Not sure I‚Äôve noticed it too , thanks üòÄ
---
spirit is probs the most powerful
---
demogoron is real good
---
plague and pig arent meta but they are super fun to play as and have some neat builds that can throw people completely off guard
---
plague, spirit, and legion you can buy with shards if you earn them through gameplay, but you cant do that with the dlc chars
---
id do demogorgon, steve and nancy have some very good abilities
---
Very cool!
---
You know damn well that the secondary objectives people have asked for was with core gameplay and had nothing to do with a battle pass. A battle pass never entered most people's minds for this game.
---
Omg! That was epic! Bravo, Aaron! üëèüèª
---
How did Gaston get damaged when Noed is active?
---
Loops ahoy lmoa
---
Friday the 13th in concept I think was far and away more fun because of the party aspect and free-roam esque design. 
---
DbD is fun in a different sense. It‚Äôs challenging and competitive, but it rarely has those laugh out loud moments that F13 has.
---
Shame, shame shame that it died without giving us what it promised. I still play it every now and then and the few thousand people who play it still  keep it going. It‚Äôll still a good time, especially with your friends.
---
You missed your chance to be using myers to have his mask in the power icon. :(
---
Hahaha yes!!
---
Hopefully a light in the dark: I got a 4k as Hag and the survivors said GG and complimented me on how I played. Never had that before, but it was nice.
---
Im hoping by January.
---
This is how should be realistically, instead of just cancelling the animation
---
I'm being grossed out with how many people use bootleg Chinese Michael masks.
---
I wish the charge timer would show just like with chainsaws
---
When u loop wide but the killer loops wider
---
Sweet man, you should add me up for it, always looking for people to chill with
---
My bad then. I only knew Steve had a unique animation because it stands out so well from the rest.
---
+1 this comment
---
Or not vaulting a window even though you enter the animation and should have vaulted the window.
---
Beats me
---
To keep up on the game's news
---
I thought they said closing the hatch takes priority?
---
Mini clau is so cute üòç
---
That's alright, it's one of those details that are easy to miss. I wish they would incorporate more personality into the characters.
---
anti slug build i see
---
Done before.
---
I did this once as a killer and someone sent me a message on Xbox afterwards calling me a cheater. I told him I was just being a friendly psychopath (I was playing as Myers).
---
This is so fucking stupid I love it
---
You didnt get any love with Ace?
---
Ace, Ash, Jeff, Adam and Quinten's always got mercy from me. It's like an honor to play with those mains, like seeing a unicorn, so I feel its my duty.
---
Noone said you had to let them live.  Just don't be a complete douchebag and bm and troll them before killing.  Either hook them or let them go.  What you did was incredibly lame and you should know that shit.  Don't deflect and hide behind a misused reference to the survivors rulebook.  Weak dude.

Might as well do as they want and hope their kindness is genuine rather than fight back.
---
As best as I can with what I got! Haha I was tired of my locker build and wanted to try something more epic when it actually pays off.
---
We didn‚Äôt do it at the same time, I started my animation right before his started. But I have been cut mid animation before like that where the hatch closing took priority and then began an awkward chase of death
---
For sure I'll hit you up when it's built.
---
As an ash main i salute you. I get given hatch pretty often and im not sure if its evil dead fans or people who really like puppets but either way im happy
---
What even is slogging?
---
I like watching people play survivor more because there‚Äôs more tension. I don‚Äôt get the same sense of urgency from the killer POV so it‚Äôs less exciting to me. But everyone‚Äôs different
---
When the killer downs all 4 survs before hooking anyone. Game essentially ends unless you have a perk to counter it
---
I was only joking it‚Äôs the build not the skin that usually brings me no mercy lol
---
Strange, I‚Äôve seen at least 10 posts
---
Those BNPs..
---
Probably still interested in the game but simply doesn't have time to play
---
That doesn't even make sense
---
Which is fair? Yes, absolutely
---
Excuse me, it's the clown
---
Haha funny jojo reference
---
Wrongo. And pretty much every other comment here misses the mark.
---
Screenwriter Victor Miller, who ONLY wrote on the original Friday the 13th, is claiming rights to Jason Voorhees because he "created the character". When in reality, he only created the little boy from the first film, and not what Jason became in later films.
---
Victor Miller won the case, and the producers of the subsequent franchise films are left solely with the brand name of Friday the 13th.
---
A Cease and Desist was given to Gun Media about the Friday the 13th game, as a split in the franchise had been created because of the lawsuit. They were no longer allowed to create new content for the game at all, but were still allowed to continue selling the product as-is.
---
Gun Media, being a relatively small company, did not have the financial means to sit and wait around for this lawsuit to be over and done with so they could keep creating content. People sitting on their asses getting paid while not having any money coming in = bad. So their maintenance updates, while still here and there, also slowed down a lot.
---
It sucks because the game was actually really fun and it had a lot of promise. But as it stands, Friday the 13th the name and Jason Voorhees the character are no longer part of each other.
---
I do not appreciate being called out like this.
---
Only Death Metal Jeff... if he is not annoying aka toxic PoS. Then it is a hook
---
Me: Hey, Reddit! In my personal opinion this isn't the best

Me in a match earlier. Repaired three gens and unhooked people 3 times. Looped killer while they got the final two. One dude died, two on hook. Opened door and killer came up behind me. I was gonna leave but he never made a move so I ran past him and he followed sorta. Unhooked the two, he let them escape and then hunted me down. Killer was rank 15. I was rank 14. One survivor was 19 and the other two were 20s. 
---
Worth it to help boost the player base and hopefully they carry that on.
---
thanks! that's what I was going for! Well, that, and the electrical hum/buzzing in the background.
---
Oh my god that is so creepy
---
What was the picture before the Dwights were put in?
---
They pinned that after.
---
ok next time ill run it past you before make sure its good fun for everyone
---
Lol not all Billys that run ruin are trash, jesus. It's a good perk, hence why so many people run it.
---
The huntress edge case you described definitely happens, but isn't an example of a mind game. If the huntress is accurate enough in those spots you just get hit, either after standing up when the huntress is too close or after being forced to cross the gap.
---
And you can do plenty against spirit. If she's standing still she can only be phasing or faking it. If you think she's faking, you can start running to the next loop. If it's far and she keeps standing still when you leave she's probably phasing so you can peel off and walk in a different direction. Unless she randomly guesses which way you've gone, you'll be out of melee range when she reappears and you can start running to another pallet.
---
If she's standing still but you think she's phasing, you can either walk away or decide which side of the pallet you want to stand on when you drop it. You also have the option of dropping and vaulting. There's plenty of options, and you gain the same amount of info on a particular player's tendency, in this case to phase or fake, as you would if they were playing another killer, e.g. huntress who can either wind up or swing through. In the spirit's case there are just more outcomes and none of them are completely safe. You are in danger of being hit at every pallet against a spirit, which is not true for the vast majority of other killers.
---
The only thing I would change is how well she can hear, since hitting someone once will basically guarantee you will down them in your next phase, especially with stridor. I don't really know of a good way to do this though since obviously she needs to hear or she's garbage. Maybe you don't hear survivors' whimpering while phasing and retool prayer beads to do that instead? Could kill two birds with one stone since beads are obv busted
---
Can't they make a dlc character? Instead of Jason? Like a offbrand killer. Or would that count.
---
Even got that stupid half crouch walk all the female survivors do
---
what you talking bout ash would roast tf outta that kid
---
&gt; He will be mist.
---
It got fucked over.
---
It was a good game with great potential, and had elements that I would love to see in DBD even today.
---
This game needs competition and it really sucks that it's not getting any. There is a lot wrong with it, even if the game has gotten better, and I really think it will keep allowing big glaring issues that keep the population away, so long as they own the market.
---
Did this to a nea who had ds. Proceeded to wait out the endgame collapse while she waited in the locker and then she dc‚Äôd at the endüòÇ
---
So you didn't do the world a favor
---
Try the wiki, maybe
---
If you manage to close the hatch and they don't go to the other gate it'll definitely work.
---
You are clueless.  You deserve every teabag you got coming to you.  What you did in this sad little clip of yours is no different.
---
That being said, if he hits you, the progress resets.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Blood Warden.
---
Smartest comment in the comments.
---
Didn't hear many complaining about BO4
---
No. The game is still fun. You all hate on it for no reason, even though the community was much nicer than this one. We don‚Äôt trash dbd, in fact I love both.
---
Can't wait for dc penalties and the husks.
---
Rin's family was so much better, smh.
---
You and me both brother
---
Silent Mine is broken
---
Well she‚Äôs in university, but there are lots of 18/19 year olds in university.
---
Besides, the meme would be less funny if it was ‚Äúa young adult‚Äôs mangled corpse‚Äù.
---
Raccoons
---
Thanks so much!
---
Last I checked there are tons of teenagers in university lol
---
Damn. I remember it coming out.
---
No you don't. The Tomes (and the challenges within) don't require the pass.
---
This is legitimately terrifying. I love it, perfect sound for my main.
---
Lol wtf, a gun? Is that team aqua or something haha?
---
&gt; Lol not all Billys that run ruin are trash, jesus.
---
Billy just doesn't need it. You can have 2 people downed 30 seconds into the match, you don't need anything else slowing the game down. A chase perk (enduring, spirit fury)/ survivor finding perk (bbq, infectious fright, whispers)  is always gonna give you more mileage to downing survivors.
---
It's why "bamboozle + ruin + instasaw (+ noed)" billy is a meme- no one who knows how to use billy correctly needs those things that either omit you from mindgames or are dramatic overkill.
---
&gt;And you can do plenty against spirit. If she's standing still she can only be phasing or faking it. If you think she's faking, you can start running to the next loop
---
Yeah no shit, everyone knows this but it's still not interesting to play against. If you're a good spirit you can fake "faking" it by standing still, seeing the survivor run to the next loop, and *actually* phasing to cut them off or force an early drop on the next tile. Then once it's dropped you can just phase again ad infinum.
---
&gt;If she's standing still but you think she's phasing, you can either walk away or decide which side of the pallet you want to stand on when you drop it.
---
So literally a coin flip.
---
&gt;You also have the option of dropping and vaulting
---
If you're in a slow vault, even on a safe pallet if she just unphases at any point she can reach you and get a free hit in during the slow vault. Any spirit worth anything is just going to unphase at the mindgameable point on any interaction. Bad spirits will just fucking run in random directions so even if you've got a legitimate plan as survivor you'll be punished cause the Spirit just accidentally rubbed up against you while they were walking where they shouldn't have been. Happens *all* the time.
---
You've not changed my mind one bit.

r/DbDgonewild anyone?
---
It‚Äôs not team aqua I can tell you that much
---
If they finish all the gens the hatch wont open until 1 is left in game.
---
no, u
---
That's scummy. Screenwriter didn't even make Jason. There's no similarities besides him drowning and Pamela killing in his name.
---
I think they were more weirded out by people finding a mangled, blue corpse 'hot' than the 'teenager' part..
---
&gt; My mind actually fucking melted attempting to follow that trainwreck of deflected logic you attempted at the end there.
---
Did you perhaps hit your head? You're once again claiming I said things I never did. I never claimed any of those things were perks, just that they were crutches, like Noed and Adrenaline. You follow now? Or do I REALLY need to slow down?
---
&gt;It's called balance. 
---
At least attempt to not be a hypocrite. EGC/hatch escapes happen because the survivors failed to complete their one objective, they're  given not only a second chance (hatch) but a third one (exit gates) or even a fourth (keys) to escape. Those are the very definition of crutch mechanics.
---
Mori's aren't crutch at all, just don't get caught by the killer. It is possible to play to end games without getting caught. Entire S Tier loadouts dedicated to this very thing. If you don't think it's possible to end survivor games without getting downed you need to take a long hard look at your personal survivor play.
---
Ash would totally slap the kid and told him he'd fuck his mother
---
Nah as a survivor main I don‚Äôt see the issue in that, that‚Äôs pretty tactical if both the other two are nearby

What do you mean? I took this screenshot in my own lobby

if it glows, it goes....

Nice i just don't wanna be toxic i just want everyone to have a good time.

or just make your own shit

What? Also some of her cosmetics say she‚Äôs a senior student

---
i dont care about teabagging or anything someone on the other team does its just trash talk. i actively hope i get moried when im survivor that shit is funny. i come from halo and gears so teabagging and executions are funny to me. you are hella judgmental so im guessing youve never done anything wrong to anyone.
---
not clueless i just am not nearly as sensitive as the majority of this sub seems to be.
---
Then they teabag at gate and call u a noon at end screen chat
---
To boot, my argument isn't that she's IMPOSSIBLE to go against.
---
She's just dramatically unfun cause there's an empty book of behaviour to "play" with when I encounter one. I legitimately had matches versus Nurses that felt refreshing, because even though Nurses are objectively more bullshit, I can at least see each individual fuck up or *good* blink they did.
---
**With Spirit, I never feel truly outplayed or that I ever outplay them.**
---
What do you mean? I did not take this from anyone else
---
The peak of fun gameplay
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be more profitable for the owners of the franchise, Victor Miller and the producers, to lend over the rights of Jason as a dlc character for DBD and make more profit than just not doing anything with Jason or Friday the 13th?
---
If everyone is getting hooked without gens getting done, either the team is bad or the killer isn't camping.
---
Always let one live to maximize the terror and anxiety the Entity feeds from in further trials
---
It could work on one person is what I'm saying. There is no other way you could do it unless you're willing to let some of them go.
---
do you though? i know people have been saying this but i believe Mathiu (i cant spell his name, sorry) said something about "only" getting 400 aulric cells back
---
I video showcasing the entire build will be up on my Youtube channel in the next coming days. I also do many other unique build showcases. Launched the channel today with many videos already to go live in the coming days. If you would check it out I would appreciate it very much!

You don‚Äôt need to use Instagram to look at it. I don‚Äôt remember the sub I saw it in. I‚Äôm not going to sift through a bunch of shit to find it. I did you a favor with a google search that somehow you could be bothered to take 5 seconds and do. You‚Äôre welcome.

No they couldn't. They weren't allowed to make new stuff at all.
