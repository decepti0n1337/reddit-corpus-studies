How do you do it?
---
---
---
She wasnt in the game at that time but yes, i guess she'd be stuck just like hag and nurse.
---
"DUDE HE'S RIGHT THERE"
---

---
Proceeds to force self out of the healing, Wraith still smacks through the Kate.
---
So you tunneled him
---
When following a survivor through the corn, Follow their scratch marks. 
---
Just stare at the ground &amp; follow their scratch marks until they stop or you hear them running. 
---
You can also run sideways through the corn to look between it rather than entering it. Can be useful for finding a survivor hiding in it.
---
it's like twins going on a doubledate
---
Seriously, how does this happen? I want it to happen to me!!! (While playing killer of course)
---
I've had it happen on PS4.  Wraith and Pig and 3 survivors. The Wraith was unable to hit or interact with generators. We all just ran around and fixed gens, we couldn't hear the heartbeat of the Wraith or get the chase music. We fixed gens and escaped and the screen just showed 3 survivors and the Pig but nothing for 4th survivor or other killer. This was before Christmas.
---
Fuck legion
---
You’re not wrong, but it just felt like one of *those* DC’s. Hopefully you’re right but I know a lot of people do that
---
Have 6 people go into a lobby I think then have one spectator and 1 killer and they both just start spamming the switch to killer/switch to spectator button
---
thanks I hate it
---
How can I experience this for myself?
---
No that would probably speed up the game.
---
Why? What difference does it make? The criteria is completely arbitrary. This game doesnt have an ELO system. There is no even playing field in this game. Between the radical difference in strength of killers, Mori's, SWF v Solo etc, it's all over the place. Not to mention rank reset. 
---
If your motivation for playing the game is to pip, i dont understand why you play.
---
Why do you think that?
---
*rare footage of the entity’s secret cult doing their rituals*
---
No I didn’t, when he got unhooked he accidentally ran into me when I was hooking a different guy so I downed him. For some reason they all hovered around the same area when I was right there.
---
Um and matchmaking. It literally takes 10 or more minutes to find a match on console, even at rank 12. I can’t get any higher because I can’t find matches. Pc is great right now but unfortunately us console players are suffering since the revert. Before they reverted, matchmaking was FINALLY wonderful! Now it’s shit. Again.
---
Ah. After legion bug, u found this. U the bug master XD
---
Actually you must be new or bad or do not understand statistics.
---
No.... But I feel bad for them and leave them on the ground to waste their teammates time
---
Read this then realized that’s literally my build right now on meg, feels good.
---
You finally found a way to balance killer against a SWF.
---
This video is amazing. This is definitely going to be one of the top posts in this subreddit. 
---
Thank you for sharing this gem of content.
---
Yes and no.  Just because the Killer is staying in an area doesn't mean you will be able to locate the hatch right away. It can be quite risky to charge in to an area where the Killer is, hoping the hatch is even there and then hoping if it is that you can locate it before getting hit 2x
---
I got called a camper yesterday because someone was unhooked and like 20 seconds later when I was back on that side of the map I found them healing behind a big rock. This was a guy who I’d previously revealed I had nurses calling to by finding him hiding around a corner after he lost me in a chase while he was healing. I don’t know why survivors still heal in the terror radius unless they’re *positive* they don’t have NC
---
Oh that’s NOED good sir
---
I swear all nurses just stand there at least twice a game.
---
Get that ruin and haunted grounds ready. Someone bring thrill of the hunt. Someone switch to the doctor. That nea can't now.
---
I tend to only not try save people if they're being flat out camped. 99% of the time they understand our decision. Speaking of, do people still use the camping signal of throwing their arms in the air on the hook?
---
No I used my flashlight and it zoomed in
---
Well, I wouldn't suggest using presence or distressing unless you are going to run both. If you really don't like that playstyle then you do you I guess.
---
Probably loads of them, honestly. Different shapes, sizes, materials. Varying intensity of tide or current.
---
I definitely go back to the hook when they’re about to go to struggle phase/be sacrificed. I won’t necessarily target the unhooked guy unless they make it hard *not* to hit them, but you just know that there’s survivors near by right before the phase changes so if I haven’t found someone I bet on finding someone then
---
When you see no mither, you know you're speaking to a professional.
---
I guess so. But why do you say? My start of a chase usually last around 15 seconds (about 3 or 4s after bloodlust kicks in) if they are good survivors. Occasionally higher but it’s usually after bloodlust kicks in that I get smacks. After the first smack another 15 seconds or so?
---
*AZTEC DUBSTEP*
---
The "Crutch"
---
Legion would be fine without the moonwalking/chase exploit. BHVR pls
---
Imagine I will indeed.
---
I wonder if BHVR will ever give it a try in a PTB. Going to be hell to balance it considering took them years of balancing for the 4v1 but it will sure as hell be fun to try out a Kill with friends mode. 
---
Would have killer mains complaining about how their potato their killer teammates to the survivors.
---
The only killer must have is the cannibal for bbq. And nobody cares if youre a killer main or not. Ok time to start playing. The game isnt great rn, but its still fun
---
i wish you could do this without bugging it in KYF
---
This looks like it would be so much fun if they could balance it. Imagine, Hillbilly charging after one of 8 Survivors, but he runs into Trapper's trap. Then Michael Myers Teir 3's after Tapp, who barely manages to make it across the window before Leatherface goes into a tantrum- meanwhile Dwight is trying to navigate a trap-surrounded jigsaw box that's been vomitted on. 
---
It would just be absolute chaos with every Killer/Survivor playing off eachother.
---
That’s a virgin build, no chad will use virgincare.
---
yes
---
She’s so cute, even though she’s so murderous~~~
---
\-So you acknowledge Tunneling, camping, and slugging and then wonder why you got flamed.  
---
\-The Survivors were wrong to get mad if you set up a 3 Gen or used Franklins.  A team should never die to a 3 Gen strategy if they are any bit good.  If you get hit while doing a gen, then all you do is run as far away from the gens as possible. Either the Killer has to let the last gen finish or else they have to break chase and then the Survivor can just heal up. I've been in games like that which lasted over 1 hour because the Killer would hit, break chase, survivor would heal, etc
---
There's also going apeshit with your mouse and swinging it wildly durring the cooldown after you down someone. Works especially well with Leatherface's tantrum.
---
It's a secret :)
---
Come on, don't keep the fun for yourself.
---
Did they remove Kate's boob physics?
---
I mean if you’re that bad at skill checks, it might actually be helpful
---
I had an Ash the other day who dropped the killer shack pallet incredibly early. I walked up to him and he kept doing beckon, as if he wanted me to break the pallet and chase him. I was playing doctor for a daily so I just kept zapping him instead. The entire time I was shaking like “no I’m not gonna follow you yet”
---
Oh they’re fukin dumb lol
---
AYAYAmaoka c:
---
Wasn’t expecting that last line. I was expecting a joke about franklins demise
---
interesting response considering your post history
---
I've found out that anyone that teabags you once has a 90% chance of DCing after you down them
---
With bombs
---
First time I ever got killed by NOED I was on The Game waiting at the exit gate for fellow survivors. A hag came up and slapped me. I was brand new so I didn’t know about NOED. I also didn’t know about Mories at the time. Learned a lot in a very short amount of time. I also don’t wait for Myers anymore because I watched a teammate teabag him then get grabbed for the tombstone kill. It was horrifying. Probably a week after the hag ended my whole career
---
all legion members and Kate would be nice :)
---
just saying
---
Yea without Frank's Mixtape it feels like frenzy is supposed to be mostly to buy you time by making everyone mend instead of being used to chase and down
---
Would you be down to pm me how you trigger it in ranked? It's my fault if I decide to try it and get banned eh?
---
i got randomly invited into a party once i joined a game, and these people and the killer all worked together so we could get the hatch achievement and it was honestly a nice and pleasant surprise
---
I've made a lot of complaints about Feral Frenzy as a power. Honestly I do need to sit down and write a comprehensive list of my thoughts on Legion at some point.
---
this HORRIFIES ME
---
i made a post days ago (week??? weeks???) about these dreams I have where multiple killers show up in the map and thsi is too mcuh for me jfc byeeeee
---
because apparently the concept of seeing if people are friends with each other before disconnecting is too much to handle
---
Dummy thicc will you still be playing Freddy. I low key hate it when you do. 
---
From Hex: Tickles
---
I had a Claudette t bag me at a pallet she dropped while I was playing trapper. She t bagged away, then I began to break the pallet and the sweet sweet sound of the trappers trap rang in my ears. It was the Claudette, not 1 foot away from the pallet she had so confidently dropped.
---
n o .....
---
My philosophy is that teammate DC's or potato teammates is part of the risk you accept when you play survivor, and that part of the deal is that you can benefit from each other's clutch plays and productivity and perk synergy etc, but that sometimes there's downsides you have to accept from playing on a team, as well. I usually don't enjoy farming, so I tend to finish these matches quickly so that we can all try getting back into a balanced 4vs1 ASAP.
---
op are you that dense? the game disconected him not himself use some common sense for once
---
🤷🏻‍♂️ He resorted to personal attacks immediately. He doesn’t know shit about me and he’s already going for the jugular
---
I wouldn't mind her following me around smacking my ass
---
If I somehow find a way to do it, I'll remember to PM you, being completely sincere here lol
---
I'm all up for curiosity and it's probably easy for them to weed out who are the real abusers anyway.
---
I'm not really gonna use this anymore. I had a blast trying it out, but I don't want the community to know about this bug because it could be abused so much!
---
That happened to me when there were 2 people left
---
I always wanted to do this but either the opportunity was never there or I messed it up at the last minute.  But this time it actually worked like a charm and while I understand it's annoying for the opposing side, we would have in so much trouble if he had managed to basement hook her.
---
What if I is both
---
After all those glitches with more killers, i wonder if is possible one day, to see some new maps where we could play 2 killers vs 6-8 survivors. Man i would love that so so much. (not even with ranked points, just a queue for fun)
---
Sorry for suggesting an idea.
---
I feel like Survivors could have a very subtle outline that's very hard to spot from most distances but if the Killer remains aware enough they could notice. And then dark maps wouldn't be so rough.
---
I didn't think this post would reach the top. Thanks guys/gals. If anyone wants to see the full video of this match I'll be more than happy to post it.
---
I saw one on rotten fields too lol felt like 2017
---
Can you dm me it then?
---
Go for it, it’s as good of a time as any to start. 
---
Don’t worry about the game being a few years old, lots of people still play it. 
---
If I could recommend a DLC, itd be the Texas Chainsaw Massacre one for leatherface he has BBQ &amp; Chili which is basically double BP. I don’t know if The Hag is free or not (she is on PS4), but if she isn’t consider that one too to get Hex: Ruin which makes generator progression take longer. 
---
Everything after that is extra based on what you think sounds good and who you think looks cool to play as
---
You mean like some sort of perk that stunned the killer or somehow let the survivor wiggle out if they got picked up too soon after an unhook.
---
Yeah, that would be cool.
---
If only....
---
And slingshots
---
No wonder this game is toxic. I have fun playing the game and I’m trying to be a try hard. Calm down master of all games.
---
The thicc clown DLC
---
How do get to that conclusion?
---
Most frequent front-page post is of a DVA Ult. For some fucking reason, everybody keeps fucking upvoting the easiest POTG to get.
---
Never thought I’d see the day
---
This has been in play for a hot minute but i do enjoy watching videos like this everytime
---
Thank you!
---
Shit like that has been around a while.   It should be publicly posted after 6 months to light a fire under the devs ass to get it fixed.
---
Why would they give it away when the community has proven they will pay $5 for 1mm longer hair?
---
No, just stupid, consider how easy that achievement is to get.
---
To be honest, I've not succeded making a multi killer lobby in KyF. I know it's possible tho. Just look it up on youtube :)
---
I’ve never seen this pic in HD before
---
not only is it sad that you think Mettle of Man is broken, but you apparently think it's more broken than insta heals, and ironically enough more broken than one of the best counters to it, insta saws.
---
Had the same issue, go to propeties on dbd in steam library, go to local files&gt;browse local files. There will be the Dead by Daylight app in the files, click propeties&gt;compatibility and mark the option "run this program in compatibility mode", choose the windows version and execute the program as administrator. It worked for me, I don't remember if I did anything else to solve it, that's all I could remember doing.
---
This glitch literally sounds like a nightmare.
---
Extremely dapper boy
---
I’ve noticed this on ps4 as well. Sometimes after a blink, I can’t swing for a split second and I’m using a brand new controller.
---
Kate &amp; Dwight? ❤️ 🤣🤣🤣
---
Only for the dailies ;)
---
Wow who went through here and just started downvoting everything
---
I’m not interacting with you any further because you give no reason as to why self care is bad.
---
Ok, sounds good
---
Thancc
---
i have an idea as to how it might have been done, can i message you and you tell me if i'm right or not? I won't share, but i like proving theories correct/incorrect
---
I've suggested this before as it is the most obvious solution but it just gets downvoted because 3 out of 4 kills means a loss to most people on this sub so they want the last survivor to be borderline guarantee to kill
---
I see.
---
Lmao well if we’re fighting fire with fire than I don’t mind immediately being an asshole. You defended what he did so you get a taste of his medicine. 
---
And in my mind, the biggest “brainlets” are morons like you.
---
Don’t worry guys, keep swimming through the “legion bad” posts and eventually we’ll get to the good content
---
Waiting for the mythical double bp like
---
100% look it happened
---
I agree with what was said about the players but the heads should be switched when it comes to overall players. Jake mains are pretty boosted and Claudette’s are either dumb and immersed as fuck or god looper, and cute as fuck.
---
If 6-7 gens had to be completed survivors would get curb stomped almost every time. As it currently stands killers are already getting around 2k on average per match, no need to change that imo.
---
Run away from the killer without dying
---
Killer main for reference, and no, I don’t camp and I stay clear of NOED like the plague (hah)
---
How do you check this?
---
Unless you have predator III. Then it's like a damn trail. It's actually useful.
---
Lmao you are so right it’s gross
---
At the enforcement Xbox website. You just sign in there and there’s a tab to check your reputation.
---
I had a billy daily for chainsaw hits. I opened with Coldwind Farmhouse, revved my saw and hit a Claudette in the corn just sitting crouched in my path. She DC'd before she hit the ground. I hit her still crouched body a few times, then proceeded to farm with the remaining survs. All of the hits on her counted for the daily, it was great.
---
Noob3 plays on stretched res.
---
I'm sure this guy can stretch his too somehow.
---
Notorious B.I.G. camper.
---
There was a complaint a while back where killers were trying to say gen rushing was bad. 
---
Tunneling is the killer equivalent. How far you go with tunneling though, I believe there is a limit.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
If an injured survivor is right next to you and you literally cant leave because they are being rescued faster than you can even leave to check gens then "tunneling" is perfectly viable. 
---
If you are losing points from tunneling its because you aren't trying to kill the entire team, thats just because you are bad. Its very situational. 
---
Same thing being a fine line between patrolling and face-camping.
---
Yup, i triggered one already. Sweaty killers gonna sweat.
---
Honestly, the lack of awarness is obnoxious. I guess they dont realize the game is effectively over at 2v1 anyway, but they have to get their 4k. There are killers that legitimately belive survivors are favored in a 1v1, its delusional and sad. 
---
Offer an easy, commen sense solution and it gets downvoted by snowflakes that arent as good as they think.
---
This game has always been  a 4v1. 4 survivors vs 1 nea
---
Look at the Survivor's body and the moving corn rather than at their scratchmarks or ahead of them.
---
As long you can keep your eyes on their physical body it'll make nearly impossible for them to suddenly crouch and disappear.
---
If they do manage to break LOS go to the last location you saw them at and either follow scratchmarks and look around for their body or, if there are no scratchmarks, stand still and look around for movement in the corn stalks.
---
Tracking through corn is one of those things that gets easier with practice and experience; the more often you're able to track someone down the better you'll get at doing so in the future.
---
/u/Title2ImageBot
---
Yeah. Joey's pretty chill.
---
I wanna play your version of the game.
---
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Joey's chill, remember?!
---
OH GOD. OH FUCK. 1 PIG LADY IS BAD ENOUGH, BUT TWO?! I'll never get that reverse bear trap off my head...
---
u/titletoimagebot
---
Another vid, another save. Keep up the good work!
---
That is a fun build lol. Make sure you hurry for ace in the hole because the shrine resets tomorrow.
---
Honestly though, this'd be fucking awesome. Just picture it being like 8 Survivors vs. 2 killers. Or like a Big Team Battle mode where it's like 4 vs. 16.
---
She extra cocky
---
Love ma Bing bong boi
---
lack of experience mostly, newer survivors have a tendency to bumrush the hook, so by the time the killer has to deal with more adaptive survivors, the precedent has already been set.
---
No feedback on what’s being done? They’re implementing dedicated servers
---
Jojo?
---
Personally I never dc so no matter what I won't dc, although I do get annoyed at things like Frank's mixtape. I actually once escaped with 2 of my teammates against a legion with Frank's mixtape.
---
Are you specifically talking about a particular streamer or YouTuber?
---
This is the funniest shit ive ever seen
---
Just give them a taunt emote, or two
---
Yeah, cold dirt is not even close to an op add on. People who run Frank's mixtape usually run cold dirt with it so I guess people associate them together?
---
Dude legion with the double blade addon makes me Uninstall the game, holding down m1 for more than 2 minutes is absolute bs intended or not
---
Fix legion or remove it we don't care devs
---
Literally everyone
---
Lol
---
No. If you look at any of the memes about the perks, discussions, etc. you can see that people are already comparing it to old DS. Saying it needs another thing to balance it.
---
I would not waste shards on perks from free characters. Especially not self care. Not a very good perk
---
Upvoted because JoJo reference
---
Yeah I’ve seen that and it’s really disappointing
---
Medkit. I love being able to heal really quickly and power through sloppy butcher. I also really like healing my teammates really quickly. Toolboxes are also my favorites
---
Me too bud lmao
---
That makes sense but personally even when I was new to the game and tried killer a few times it seemed like common sense to not stand around and watch one hooked survivor endlessly
---
You know in order for me to have an unbiased opinion on corn (what a sentence) I think I would need to play PC. Honestly, I can see a lot of situations where you could use dense foliage to your advantage. Like a Wraith uncloaking in a bush may be extremely useful or maybe even Spirit using this. I feel like if this perk were added it would be used as much as Head On, and it would be the equivalent of Iron Maiden on Huntress on stealth killers and the chainsaw bros.
---
I lagged out of a game once just as a Meg was about to unhook me and I couldn’t stop obsessing over how my team was gonna think I dc’d like a jerk! 😩
---
I mean doesn't it, like most m1 killers are pretty much in a huge disadvantage right now
---
You do, you just don’t care to admit it.
---
Is there a way to see this on PS4? Do they only show you negative feedback, or thumbs up as well?
---
get all those bloodpoints
---
Ruin, bbq, monitor and abuse, thanatophobia is what I use.
---
After you break a gen puke on it.
---
Continuously vomit on 1 person to make them broken and then go for a hit.
---
Wait for them to drop a pallet first before spraying them with corrupted purge.
---
Some of the basics.
---
Disclaimer: I know the build is boring or "non-meta" blah blah blah. Its just what I use.
---
I had a game last night with two people who were obviously SWF since they both had similar names and were always around to save one another. They were salty at the end, but it was mostly tame.
---
Well, all 5 gens were done, 1 guy was dead, the two SWFs were alive with one of them being on a hook and the other one was broken (I was playing Plague). The third guy was a random and was opening a gate somewhere. So I had two choices: Patrol around the hooked guy since I **knew** his buddy would be coming, or go to one of the gates to *maybe* catch 1 person. Basically, do I secure two more kills, or run the risk of *possibly* securing 1? Well, since I knew the two SWFs would team up on me at the end of the game in chat if I patrolled, I decided to do the stupid thing and risk killing the random, which would most likely end in all 3 of them escaping, but whatever, I don't care for ranks. But, ***right*** when I decided to walk away to a gate, since the guy was broken, he decided to use a fountain to heal himself for some reason. I then saw he used a fountain near his hooked friend, so I obviously ran back/towards the fountain. Also, it was the only fountain left in the map that was corrupted, so I was absolutely certain he was there. Well, I ended up killing the guy and that caused his buddy to die on hook, so only the random escaped. 3 kills, 1 escape. 
---
Of course, I prepped for the salt. First thing that was said was "Why camp?" I told him I wasn't camping, since I only patrolled for about 20 seconds prior to him using a fountain to heal. He, of course, followed up with "yes you were", along with his friend saying the same thing. I, again, said I wasn't, and said that if he really wanted to save his friend, he shouldn't have used a fountain right next to him to heal, especially since that was the only corrupted fountain on the map. He then told me it wasn't the only corrupted fountain, as if I'm not the one playing Plague...ya'know...the one who can see all fountains. Then they just left. The salt wasn't as bad as I thought it'd be, but it's still mind boggling why people get so angry for the killer patrolling for even a few seconds...ESPECIALLY under these circumstances. THEN they get mad when they give away their position entirely and basically shit on me for their own mistakes. "Why didn't you let me get the free unhook so we could both escape" "Fucking shit camping killer"
---
[removed]
---
wait how u check this lol
---
Can you check on PS4?
---
You can do nothing, devs intentionally blocked all ways to change fov. All you can do is to change monitor resolution to 16:9 aspect ratio before playing the game and turn it back after.
---
Aw that sucks then
---
hahahaha! worst looking survivor next to Quentin
---
Either sore losers or dumb kids
---
Or adults who are only adults in terms of age
---
Yah i kept getting nat 20s on charisma check as a bard and my dm ended up punishing me cause i kept breaking shit.
---
I've been downvoted for defending that very action though
---
MoM only really punishes killers who tunnel or consistently focus one person. Decisive punishes the same way. NOED just punishes the survivors for not doing SWF.... if you go in solo you have no idea how many totems are left and if the other survivors are cleansing. So yes, noed rewards bad killers. MoM won't ever activate if you don't hit with basic attacks. A nurse who blinks and hits doesn't charge it. Then again, MoM is really no different than borrowed time.... so I don't see why everyone is so upset. They get one extra hit... they stay injured and if they don't you see them
---
I've never seen this happen
---
Good, now to await a match where each killer is a different Legion member going after a single survivor like a pack of wolves vs a lone deer.
---
This sounds exactly how it should work
---
I tried dark devotion and I love it. No one expects stealth doc.
---
10. Hope
---
Man I love hope. No one expects it and you feel soo fast. It's really fun
---
9. Sprint burst
---
Feels soo good to just sprint away from the killer into safety. Perfect for when you're working on a generator and you have nothing safe around you
---
8. Botany Knowledge
---
Healing your teammates soo quickly at all times feels amazing, good synergy with self care and empathy
---
7.Iron will
---
Being able to pull of jukes that you otherwise could not pull off and being able to not be tracked soo easily while injured feels amazing
---
6. Plunderers instinct
---
Finding and looting all chests, getting great items is such a great experience, awesome with ace in the hole 
---
5. Diversion 
---
Such a funny and meme perk. Love confusing the crap out of the killer with it 
---
4. Dance with me 
---
Underrated perk. Soo awesome and has good synergy with number 3 
---
3. Quick and quiet 
---
Absolute beast of a perk. Can pull of insane locker plays, confuse the crap out of killers and with dance with me you can dissappear 
---
2. Distortion 
---
One of my favorites. Being able to ignore bbq and nurses calling feels fantastic. Jeff is such a great survivor 
---
1. Aftercare 
---
My personal favorite. Although outclassed by empathy and bond, I absolutely adore aftercare. Being able to see where a survivor is at all times feels great and you will always have it (saving teammates, healing them and getting unhooked and healed)
---
Again, I don't think this is A: taking into account variables, and B: are you saying that every map has a Favour? Cause they all do, each map favours certain killers &amp; certain surv playstyles &amp; perks. Haddonfield, Badham &amp; game are extremely easy if you bring balanced landing. Swamp just outright makes claudettes invisible while standing. If you had a no perk killer &amp; no perk survs all at the same skill level, The Game would probably get a relatively even split, but perks change that by changing playstyles &amp; ability to counter &amp; get to loops. Every pallet in the game is safe. The killer has to break them unless they're nurse, hag or spirit. There are only 2 killers the Game even favours, hag &amp; doc, and doc is... well... doc...
---
Also if these statistics(which I can't find anywhere(unless your just saying what the devs think it should be)) are real, the devs would have to have a record of every map, of every killer, of every build, of every rank, of every survivor, of every individual perk &amp; addon that was in every single match. Making a "kill ratio" for this game cannot be done, as no-one would have this info, and even if the devs had records of everything, I doubt they would make a kill ratio as its just not a priority over trying to fix their game &amp; they probs wouldn't make it public, because everything they say gets people pissed off and screaming because the devs are "not doing their job". There have been people angry with dedicated servers cause they can't use MLGA; this community hates everything &amp; doesn't need more to fuel the fire.
---
Better question, where can we find the models in the first place? Because damn am I interested
---
Tier 3 should reveal aura of survivor for 3 seconds seeing as you  can't see hooked player from 16 meters away or make it something like killer doesn't know when you get unhooked (no notification) for tier 3 and meters away gets increased
---
I honestly hope they don’t patch it. I know they will, and I know it’s for the better, but it would just be so cool to keep this in. 
---
In Batman Arkham Knight, there was a glitch that you could perform that let you free roam around Gotham as any of the playable characters, not just Batman. The devs, Rocksteady, even put out a blog post saying they would not fix it since the community really enjoyed it and it could only be activated if you were really trying to activate it.
---
I love all of this but bounce back would probably be a bit too strong. Just because you could utilize it multiple times and mixing it with something like MoM or adrenaline. Lol
---
I once accidentally skipped an encounter with some quick thinking and lucky roles that was supposed to take the rest of my session. My dm had to make something up on the fly. That's how we ended up guarding a shipment of wands for olivander the wand salesman.
---
Couldn’t have said it better. 
---
The only thing is all the whiny killers will say “I need my 4K” and if this even happened after 2 hours of it in the game killers will come on here and post about nerfing it bc it’s not “fair” 🙄
---
Holy shit someone actually understands. Stab wounds study is perfect for moonwalking because it makes your timer go down faster. Cold dirt is great alongside Joey's mixtape but it's not annoying or op. It's just normal. It doesn't deserve the shit it gets
---
Beauty is within the eye of the beholder
---
Ha, thanks. They are probably new players? At least that's what I hope. I don't see the point to rush unhooking as the killer likely still lingers around.
---
I think what worries me these days is how some players are so impatient if they are being left on hook for extended periods. They'll either DC or kill themselves out of spite. 
---
I get their argument if the killer is patroling and you only have brief period to unhook. But otherwise man, have some patience. Otherwise you'll just endanger both of us.
---
At the same time, try not to leave your team mate too long that they reach the second stage.
---
Exactly. It doesn’t have to be super balanced or anything, so long as it’s fun for both parties I’m game. I want a game with Michael, Freddy, Leatherface and Pig against Ash.
---
Didn't say she wasn't beautiful boi only that she looks mega crackheady

“I’m on PS4 and have zero issues connecting...”
---
See I already don’t want to read anything you have to say. 
---
Because by that logic alone in your first few sentences you basically belittling and saying no one else can possibly be experiencing connection issues at all just because you aren’t. 
---
News flash. That isn’t the case.
---
What I’m suggesting would directly reflect the quality and “rank” of players. Don’t wanna help the team and just bail? Cool.. that’s not a red rank play. Want to bust your ass making sure your entire team escapes doing things like swapping chases and taking hits? Cool, that’s a high rank play. It’s that simple. People who don’t play at a high tier shouldn’t be getting into red ranks so easily. People who do ensure those things and don’t just escape at the soonest chance possible should be. You can tell a lot about people when they play and their play style, why on earth would anyone especially people who only solo que, want people who don’t put proper effort into helping the team in high ranks? It doesn’t make any sense to me to want them there. If they want to play like yellows, cool, no problem, but when I’m in red ranks I want actual red rank quality players, not browns.
---
You claimed killers don’t rage quit and made a bullshit excuse for why they do. You belittled other players other experiences because they don’t match your own. And you also clearly didn’t read my original post either or my response. I did read your post. And I pointed out your flaws contradictions. 🤷🏻‍♀️👋🏻
---
It is, I am in the same game
---
Oh cool then
---
Very cute. Just, ugh, I love spirit, and mm, curves AYAYAYA!
---
It doesn't matter what you do. There will always be someone who will be mad at you for how you play.
---
Ash or Laurie if you hate tunneling camping killers.
---
Lmao I never said they didn’t rage quit. I said they quit because people force them to dc and when they’re unsuccessful 😂 aside from connection issues. I quite literally said it was a result of player actions as opposed to just being smacked and leaving like survivors do. Jesus man, also did you fix your spelling in the post yet I haven’t checked. It showed your emotion in your post rushing that bad.
---
Was only a sarcastic joke it's why I added the /s
---
But that's cool I didn't ever notice there was a sound indicator for d/c vs crash. TIL
---
What if they're just taking their time, so they don't fuck up again. Not to mention that shit probably isn't very easy, and they need money to do anything at all and keeps the game feeling fresh. Regardless it'll never be perfect.
---
Legion and Pig are especially good when using both.
---
r/theydidthemath
---
Jane, because she's **dummy THICC.**
---
Oh this is the new healing bug lol I got this yesterday.... When they do this their mouths are wide open
---
That's why Jane is better
---
She is so dummy thicc and any hit the killer does will clap her ass cheeks and stun the killer
---
We all know what he is waiting for... he wants her to struggle against his entity.
---
I wouldn’t have bought if Ash if he had no voice lines at all tbh. It’s just a dude cosplaying Ash if that’s the case.
---
Did you have a stroke in the middle of typing that?
---
That easy? I'll be damned.
---
Ash Williams because he's groovy!
---
Douche move since no one will be able to do it and they’ll probably fix it soon
---
Ah... victory.
---
Jane, Ash, Adam
---
or the ones who tunnel you into the ground and 4k your team in minutes, like the game i played about half an hour ago :)
---
no, i'm not salty. /s
---
Did that Myers say, "always have a back up mori"?
---
Eventually this bug will get fixed and we'll only reminisce about how epic it was :(
---
Imagine Doc and Billy. One keeps constant fake Doctor aura up, while Hillbilly uses the aura of the fake Doctors to blitz around the map at all times. 
---
Or Leatherface teaming up with Trapper. The basement is literally the Nuke Zone.
---
Yo, BHVR, when are we getting Trish as a new Paragraph DLC?
---
Same I saw Hard Bail and expected to see Take a Seat Right Over There next.
---
No one here doesn't believe you. Console DBD is trash
---
Happy microphone day
---
It's just cause of the rank nonsense that's been happening recently. They did one of their monthly(?) rank resets and then switched to a new-ish ranking system so now everyone that should be at dummy high rank is slipping down into lower ranks... but they still have all their high-tier loot and perks amd such so there's a weird imbalance going on. For the time being yeah you'll need to grit your teeth. Keep that chainsaw polished, friend!
---
Lol SWF is the only way to be balanced against 1 killer.
---
It's just a bit sweaty.
---
i bet you main Meg or claud
---
You didn't cleanse the totems  so you messed up. I'll go in and cleanse all 5 totems if I have to before doing gens
---
That’s some shit
---
The Pig proxy camps while crouched. ***ALWAYS***.
---
Not even, it's just standard 5e with a bit of sword coast, he just ran a blank and said the first thing he could think of. HP would be cool for an rpg tho.
---
Thats bubba
---
MoM doesn’t only punish killers who tunnel it punishes all killers if you do well even if you hook all the survivors 2 times and spread the love evenly you still get hit with MoM and in a way its like old DS they get a speed boost the killer is stuck in the wiping animation potentially making the chase go allot longer making you lose gens and precious time and borrowed time and new DS are real anti tunnel perks MoM isn’t ani tunnel although some killers don’t care about MoM  the nurse completely screw it over idk why.
---
Mom is bugged on nurse it was confirm from the devs.
---
Add me @Ripfaith
---
Idk why they don’t add a game mode where 2 killers compete. Add more survivors, and some new objectives. I think it would be kinda fun
---
You're taking this a bit too seriously. I guess I can see what you're saying about the lore part but in this game, this is the best way I can think of to incorporate fucking with his prey before killing them.
---
4 vs 8 survivors
---
the goal isnt to open the gates as gens wont spawn in this mode. the point is to survive as long as possible. 
---
there are no hooks. if you are downed a different killer than the one that downed you can perform a mori on that survivor. 
---
when there is only 1 survivor left that survivor sees the hatches aura for the rest of the match and has the goal of getting to the hatch without being spotted by one of the 4 killers. 
---
the killer cannot be within 4 feet of the hatch otherwise it will change location
---
It surprised me too
---
Best Dead by Daylight related laugh I've ever had
---
Yes! And after it’s used and you heal up, the killer can see your aura for the rest of the match.
---
Don’t forget Claduettes lol
---
When the survivors scare you more than killer
---
Go have a look at the steam charts, even with the peaks and drops that naturally occur, the Plague patch was significantly lower in terms of players than the game's been in years. "Experimental" matchmaking on the live build, combined with a poorly thought out new rank system ON TOP OF the regular bugs really caused them to take a huge hit in players.
---
Honestly I feel like Ash was released *early* just to draw some players back as they reverted the matchmaking to hopefully keep people around.
---
It really does show that they're aware that they slipped into a really bad position.
---
I kind of get what you’re saying.. I’ve played games my whole life, but I’ve never played a game where it’s been expected to give the opposing team a head start or advantages that work against yourself. It doesn’t make any sense to me. I’ll admit that I’m extra salty about it, but that’s because it just doesn’t make sense to me at all to play like that. It’s not unsportsmanlike. Unsportsmanlike would be throwing a fit and crying about madeup rules when you don’t win. 
---
Maybe if I was playing against a 5 year old it would be different.
---
this one still gets me every time
---
GIVE US FOUR LEGION SQUAD
---
Hey, Technician helps you do gens right under the killer's nose, even when your teammate is being chased around. I've completed a few gens with them mere feet away and they had no idea
---
Like his personality, great job with the perk ideas but they could use some cleaning up, overall would love to see someone with a personality like this in a trial sometime.
---
Probably just didn't play for a few resets
---
Do u know guys how to make it on KYF at least?
---
Pirate ship for me
---
This made me reinstall the game.
---
"A pinewood rowboat on a smooth wake in harsh sun" nice
---
And the killer is a Nea
---
You have to understand, there are perks that are good for communicating things, and there are perks good for doing things.
---
When you can communicate in a SWF situation, you don't need to run perks to do it, hence why Kindred is a great perk for Solo but unless you're doing the Open Handed trick in a group (which only works so well anyway since it only stacks to 24m). 
---
A giant "I'm opening the door to get our asses out of here" sign is worth a lot more than opening the door 3 seconds faster in that situation.
---
Finally the game is balanced
---
Dead by daylight is going through a rough time of bugs right now, especially on console, causing survivors to Disconnect, I’m almost certain that’s why.
---
Self care is not very good anyway.  Perks that allow you to do things faster are generally better.  Also stuff that helps you hide or position yourself better on the map.  My favorite perks are Bond, Iron Will, Dead Hard, Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, Empathy, Resilience, Stake out
---
2 of the other survivors were trash tbh
---
You meant "altruistic", right?
---
How do I play it for free?
---
The survivor main community and some popular survivor steamers have spearheaded this movement to DC for whatever reason they want. It started with Legion and just grew from there and it ended up being this complete scourge eventually where people DC if they get downed first. Or play against Pig. Or play against Spirit. Or play against Doctor, etc
---
let me dab
---
Wasnt this posted by someone else literally today??
---
Nah, I just type weird and inaccuratly sometimes, I may have English as my first language but can I speak it??? Nooo
---
You are right in an mmr/elo based ranking system. But right now in dbd theres a fixed 20 brackets where you can place players. If you double pip on stomp games, you will get what we had before, 90% of the player base in red ranks with a massive delta between skills levels at a similar rank.
---
NECC
---
What is tunneling? And no, I don’t camp.
---
For the team!!!
---
It’s not about taking it seriously. Like I said, when they got the rights to use the characters in the game they signed contracts to keep the characters semi accurate to represent them properly. They can’t just change them. This means that the power he was given was most likely agreed upon, and could also explain why they haven’t reworked him yet. There aren’t many drastic changes they can make without getting permission first. And with Wes Craven Dead? It’s not likely they will get permission to do anything at all with him that is that big, any time soon. Sorry, OP. 
---
They would be better going the doctor rip off route and adding illusions instead.
---
for survivor its lithe or bond. lithe is perfect for getting around jungle gyms and shit, bond is great in so many ways. for killer its probably blood warden. no one ever expects it
---
Name checks out
---
I swear by Stake Out as my go to for combating Ruin and gen rushing. Sure I could just hit great skill checks but considering Im stoned 90% of the time I play its a kindness to my shitty reflexes 👍
---
Your thoughts are nightmares.
---
I don't even care how unbalanced this would be, I want to play it so badly
---
Most people go for an anti healing or blood hunting build with Spirit. Stridor can be very useful on Spirit for coming out of her phasing and getting a jumpscare hit.
---
Love it
---
I mean those are all annoying perks to go against but idk if I'd call them OP
---
I cannot upvote this enough. I wish that instead of pushing out a new killer every few months they would just take however long it takes to just polish up the game, fix these issues, and most of all I think they really need to make a new game mode, this isn’t something technically flawed with the game it’s just that only one mode grows stale, that’s why all my friends left the game, they complained that every match was the same thing. But yeah, this game has grown stale, and is completely, and utterly, broken.
---
It's definitely dry tho
---
Omg, I almost made an "ideal game situation" thread just this morning! I didn't because I'm afraid of internet strangers
---
Anyway, play how you play! People just get salty. I bet if they were given a chance to cool down they never would be so mean, but it sucks they get that way in the first place
---
My ideal game as survivor is to unhook a few times, and when the exit Gates are powered, save a hooked person from a camper using team work. That's my favorite feeling. I don't care if I go down afterwards, just something feels really good about saving someone from an impossible situation
---
Ideal killer game is 3k and give the hatch, not really a lot of specifics here. However as long as I hook everyone once, I'm pretty happy with that too
---
Interesting so far lol my favorite may be spine chill honestly
---
Then it’s your playstyle, maybe you’re a little too campy..
---
Survivors do dc way more than before but that doesn’t mean that they dc every single time for no reason, there has got to be a reason.
---
*AYAYA intensifies*
---
I took a video of the absolute racist/homophobic/generally offensive tirade one survivor went on in the post-chat, but since it's a video, it has his display name, so I don't think I can share that (directly?) here.  I've been called a r\*\*\*\*d, bad player, git gud etc but this was all that and even more.
---
Does the writer have a brain ...?
---
S Nurse
---
A+ Spirit
---
A  hillbilly Legion Plague
---
Blood Warden for killer. Just so much fun to plan out a good play with it
---
Poised for survivor right now. 10 seconds of no scratch marks is nothing to sneeze at and it has a lot of utility if you're creative and proactive
---
I play on ps4 and its a nightmare playing survivor
---
Man i love DBD but maybe its time to show BHVR some tough love with the way they are executing this game.
---
Yare yare daze
---
If you weren't trying then you could easily hit them and then you'd get at least some points and move on.  Just saying.  
---
I would never understand people who get 3 kills and then complain because they won't have that free 4th kill... Then again I let more than 1 survivor escape pretty often because I don't really care about killing them all but having fun , so what do I know? Good luck in your standoffs I guess.
---
Tunneling is really just a shitty toxic strategy that no killer with a shred of confidence or decency feels the need to adopt to win.
---
Just slug the farm victim and go after the saver, that way 3 people are out of commission and not just one. It’s a win win for everyone. Victim gets to live, saver gets aggro which they were probably hoping for and you get a hook and slow the game down.
---
Bugs are causing disconnects right now. I'm assuming this is not normal DCing because that doesnt match what you're talking about
---
It just makes up like 75 percent of killer builds that people play against
---
The 4 most annoying meta perks? Wonder what I mean.
---
*Dc’s in the corner*
---
BBQ is not bad at all, come on
---
I'm to a point if I see a legion and they are being a 'typical' legion.... I just crouch when they are close.... A surprising amount leave me alone
---
He’s clowning you dude
---
Ok, still like the most meta perk? And that only addresses one of four. People shouldn't slur about it but you can't act surprised when that is your build.
---
it all started with Legion and new engine. to me, i can deal with anything but fucked sounds. 
---
anyhow, the engine broke the game in multiple ways, not just sounds. and Legion is a trash of a killer. but now they completely destroyed the game with that pipping and matchmaking.
---
i've been playing since previous Lunar event and the game has never been so tiresome for me. i'm a damn Freddy main since pallet vacuum, okay? D: i have patience.
---
also, a friend of mine who's been playing since 2016, says the game truly is in the worst state. we both complain but still play it but more and more switching to something else, so, yeah..
---
Maybe when dedicated servers come, the game will be able to handle more players per lobby and we can get more game modes. I would love to see a tag team killer match
---
&gt; And that only addresses one of four.
---
Well, yeah, because the other 3 are annoying. why would i address those ones if i think they're annoying as well?
---
&gt; Ok, still like the most meta perk? 
---
i was never disputing that. only disputing that it's annoying
---
complaining about BBQ is dumb. that was the only point i was making
---
I mean, you *can* when you absolutely flip your shit over those perks.  Like survivors running (formerly) DS, Adrenaline, Sprint Burst/Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Self Care, etc and dealing with those in multiples, that's all fine but a killer using their good perks is a problem?  The only one I hate as a survivor is Ruin because I'm bad at great skillchecks, it just feels so necessary as a killer when you get past middle ranks.
---
#d a r n
---
PS4 DBD is trash I have it on both
---
Oh sorry I meant when you don't have it activated you get off 100% of the time but only when a team mate is about to save you
---
How many tokens can **Bounce Back** hold at a time?
---
No mither and self care? Somethings not right..
---
Honestly its been a very shitty day for me as well but I played like an hour ago and had a few good games but its been really tough to try to enjoy this game right now but man I'm trying.
---
Please no
---
I've tried Tinkerer on a few people, and it usually just ends up being a "hey, this gen's gonna be done before you get there" notification.  I think his Ghost addon is probably better, crazy that it's only a common addon.
---
I think everyone has those nights I think the best way to have fun is either get a friend on or just run gimmick builds like the Eye see you build or the stop running and let me heal you build. That's usually what I do whenever I get frustrated
---
Ok...
---
I love how it seems like there were more boxes for your meme template, but you just said Fuck It and only filled one in. Outstanding- seriously. I love when people don't even try. 
---
Like, I'm serious. I know it sounds like I'm insulting you, but it cracks me up when people just take memes and do nothing with them and post them. There was this one guy who just copied another guys post and overlayed text over the original text so you couldn't even read anything. 
---
Like, the top text, which was pasted over existing text, said "I HATE BLACK PEOPLE."
---
and the bottom text, which was also overlayed over existing text, said "Bottom Text" Funniest shit ever. 
---
...I need sleep.
---
well tonight i was de-ranking and obviously wasn't playing at all to not get a pip. like i was following survivors, letting them hit me with pallets then i'd farm if they were up for it. with the amount of thanks and +reps i got i'd assume everyone is having a bad night.
---
and yeah, cheesus. i'm a rank 1 killer main with over 2k hours. i was matched with green rank survivors who had like 100 hours and were completely innocent creatures.
---
[you need this buddy](https://youtu.be/yQQm2vLmS58) 
---
Keep your chin up lol
---
Oh wow you actually did it XD
---
He's just sitting there like try me bitch
---
should have specified that. It holds 2 max. If you want the perk to activate more than once, you'll have to work for it.
---
Yeah😂
---
PM me a link or something, sounds hilarious.
---
what is an op build to you? 
---
so what i see is someone who can track the injured, so you're that type of Wraith: to hit, cloak and follow. lesser reappearance time for stomping on people with Nurses' and overall. nothing bad here, it's how Wraith supposed to be played. 
---
but if these perks alongside with faster reappearance are not what you can call op then i don't even know what op is. unless we speak add-ons. some add-ons are pretty op.
---
like, that's the thing about Wraith. if you figure out distance, timing, know maps real well, know how to end loops and all that, Wraith is really strong and hella annoying. but there's no perk out there to really compliment his power like Enduring+Spirit Fury on Billy.
---
wouldn't really call anything unfair but BBQ on Billy tbh.
---
Another fun fact if the last survivor disconnects you don't gain progress at least on xbox
---
STBFL for killer. Having less stun time after a successful hit is beautiful. Plus, I love being able to almost feel the survivor sweat when I all but immediately get back into the chase after a hit. 
---
Bond as survivor. Being able to tell where my teammates are when I'm in a pinch, someone else is in a pinch, or someone's looping the killer around me, is invaluable.
---
Why is everyone so mad??!! Its just a game!!!
---
I can tell you one thing. Those 1000 points were worth it
---
Every time you hit a survivor with a spoon it slows survivor actions by 20% for 20 seconds and sets back action progress. Survivor auras are always visible. No hooks in game. Slugged survivors cannot recover and are healed much slower. Hitting slugged survivor resets healing progress and fills a dying bar, if survivor is hit 50 times while on the ground, survivor dies.
---
OH YEAH MAC, LET'S GET A MORI
---
EVERYBODY, EVERYBODY GET A MORI
---
I bet you run Urban
---
yeah, agreed. seriously don't get how can BBQ be annoying on any killer but Billy. overall most just use it for points anyway.
---
Well, that's fuckin annoying
---
This just needs to be a gamemode,  just to fuck around and have fun.
---
Doc &amp; Freddy could become the tier in  this game mode as they would be very powerful support.
---
Nurse could distract survs while Hag &amp; Trapper setup.
---
Saw another post here where they said no gens just survive which seems great
---
Gens are penalized if 2 people do them, still goes faster than only 1 on a gen but not as fast as it used to be, unless someone runs prove thyself. Then it goes as fast as it use to
---
By far the funniest post here, fuck dude
---
I thought yellow was it’s faster red is slower
---
Ugh. I fully would not mind 6 months of no new killers/survivors if it meant big bug fixes and balance patches.
---
Oh so they just nerfed it. Thanks man!
---
Thank you! I had a fun time making them.
---
I was the survivor on his match. He forgot to mention he was a Leatherface and camped all 3 survivors (with Ruin and Noed). I didn’t want to give him the free 4k, and there was no way for me to do the last 2 gens by myself. It was pretty entertaining tho xD
---
I just use small game so it’s fast
---
Well Dead By Daylight is literally the equivalent of Tag/ Hide and Seek with a horror theme.
---
Yeah. It was stressful as fuck. Trying to pay attention to where she was while focusing on the skill checks that came with no sound at all.
---
*dc’s in the basement*
---
imo most op add-on Wraith has is brown. the one that suppresses heartbeat. pair it with that annoying yellow shit that makes the bing bong across the map and there you go. that is op for sneaking up and camping cause no BT will save injured.
---
survivors obviously were just salty. though you definitely did something from your side too cause i be killer main for over a year and no one ever blasted on me that much to use racial or homophobic slurs. they'd say i hack, lag, tell me to suck their cocks, fuck myself and all the normal gamer stuff. i don't even pay attention to this.
---
*survivors rejoice upon seeing legion DC*
---
No it's the same it's always been it just shows you now where before it didnt
---
*survivors still complain because Legion OP*
---
2 people is 180%
---
Tbh he is annoying, but not OP
---
So it's this the coming "balance" update that the Devs were talking about, to make the game more fair to killers, since the survivors are OP as the killer mains said.
---
Yes and killers hesitate to pick up a survivor during 60 seconds IN CASE it is a DS. But I agree with totem counters. Could be a nice touch with small game...
---
I know rhat
---
Thanks for showing me the piece that was missing from my life
---
I had one spawn at my feet on a corn field map a few days ago. So much for that LoS patch.
---
Here you are again, hating on one of my videos. You really don't like me huh? Okey first of all I know it will inspire others but I think it's up to the devs to fix it, this would be discoverd eventually anyways. And i know I upload here like once a week, but I work really hard on them and I tend to get hundreds if not thousands of up votes, u dont think its okey then? I hope ur change ur opinion someday about me, its never fun to have a hater.
---
Don't take the game so seriously man if ur a good killer it gets to the point where nobody says anything at the end of the game that's pleasent move on keep playing if u play to hear satisfaction from others it's usually not gona happen from the losing end.
---
(Insert tables have turn comment here)
---
Probably noed. But I'm sure you know that already, don't know why you're feigning ignorance but whatever.
---
Fair, the Ghost addon is one of his best, that's absolutely true.  
---
I really can't think of anything I did, I hooked and I left just about every time, I only hung around once I think because I saw scratch marks and tried to follow them.  It was just the one guy that said anything in post chat, and he was convinced that he was looping me so good and was a much better player than I was, so I honestly couldn't tell you what set him off.
---
Fuck this perk, I0m not playing until they nerf it, even if it means never playing again
---
Yeah that’s good. It’s just that there are a lot of survs that think so
---
then you just got lucky to get a complete insane crybaby D: that's actually sad. how sad their life must be if they take game That close to heart where loss for them means the world.
---
I'm actually enjoying the new system, I found before that I ended up reaching ranks beyond my skill level and just getting crushed by the more skilled players that I was matched with. Now my rank sits at a level where games are challenging and fun instead of frustrating. Though I should say that I don't play trying to reach rank 1 like what I assume most others do but instead to reach "Survived" or "Merciless Killer" results in games. That's how I have my fun anyhow.
---
As much as I agree.. Its because that’s the standard that’s already been set by the player base as shitty as that is. Until people learn that whining over every little thing this kinda shits gonna happen. The devs are following demand. For months people were complaining this is to easy, that’s to easy, this stuffs boring, wile the top tier people were performing in the manner that is now required to pip.     
---
    
---
It’s not like this came out of left field. It’s a direct response to people not knowing when to shut up and enjoy the game.
---
I think 8 survivors might be too little. You could hook 3 survivors and camp them all and still have a 4th killer going after the others
---
you can report this if you want though. racial slurs, f-bombs and stuff are not really tolerated.
---
though i couldn't care less, there was this killer calling people in chat dirty niggers. he's a known red rank camper and tunneler. he gets upset over slightest lose. like even if he did 3k(i always look up who i'm playing with to see if it's him so i could immerse and just finish 2 gens cause unfortunately others will die, he camps hard and not so bad in chase but prefers to camp for some reason). so i reported the guy. since then i haven't met him for over a month now. i used his racial slurs as a mean to report since camping is not reportable. but he is very, very annoying. uses all the best perks, add-ons. even noed in case people will be better than he is.
---
Tbh the best part was the guy laughing the whole time, he sounded hilarious.
---
Ah well, it's an idea. Who knows how to balance it. With your scenario, there's still a good chance 3-4 may get out- but it's hard to say. It would take a ton of testing and changed to get the balance right.
---
That's the best bet.
---
 If you can record a few matches, and cut it down to almost only chases and post, I'm sure someone on here will be willing to try and help.
---
I’m not playing again unless they revert to old match making and piping system. I used to get to rank one in the first week, but now it takes me around 3.
---
Why the spoon by the nipple?
---
Thanks for the insight :)
---
honestly just practice and try different loops out and you'll figure it out yourself eventually
---
Go watch Zubat or Jendenise on twitch.
---
Tbh I got good just by playing alot and always drawing the killer into a chase. 
---
I have a few videos of me if you're interested.
---
Mostly looping is predicting what the killer wants to do and counterplaying
---
The NOED at rank 5 is probably what's drawing the hate.  Aside from the training wheels I wouldn't be the least bit annoyed by any of your other perks.
---
Plot twist:  She was actually a cyborg the entire time.

Very funny.
---
I had really fun atleast haha, happy cakeday bro!
---
Do that, I'd watch and critique
---
I think its only you, all the recent reddit uploads about this is from people being in our games haha!
---
I am. 
---
I would say I get DC’d out of maybe 1/5 matches and I know it’s not my internet. ):
---
I especially like the idea where you do it and then it just follows and then change survivor to be cool.
---
Is this for real? 🤣🤣🤣
---
Alright, looks like I'll have to be patient. Thanks!
---
Well, well, well. Last time you didn't care. Seems like someone is actually showing their emotions this time.
---
The killer I have gone higher in the ranks was this guy.
---
Of course I am a really toxic killer when playing Freddy, but he ain't that bad.
---
The last perk should give you 1 token and use up 2, in my opinion.
---
Is that Mormon underwear?
---
Sarcasm....
---
I already made a post a while back with something I think would be balanced. For 4 killers: 16 survivors, a map 4x the normal size, each killer has their own obsession, 28 generators of which 20 need to be done. Hatch rules stay almost the same (Hatch spawns when survivors left equals gens done + amount of killers (4)).
---
It is possible that 16 survivors is too many, in wich case, maybe we could do this:
---
1 killer -&gt; 4 survivors
---
2 killers -&gt; 7 survivors
---
3 killers -&gt; 10 survivors
---
4 killers -&gt; 13 survivors
---
Wow, really impressive! I love it. Seems pretty balanced and thematically sound too.
---
Out of curiosity, how did you make that photo? It looks really clean and nice!
---
Bounce Back is one of those perks that sounds great on paper but needs to generate tokens based off how long you heal others, not just flat health states. As already seen with Mettle Of Man, perks that trigger health states instantly can lead to cases of players taking more hits than nessicary to secure downs which feeds back into killers who insta down or just circumnavigate they System entirely. 
---
Also with four perks dedicated to anti slug, I think we’re good without a perk that requires someone to be slugged.
---
Only if they go for a survivor who was just unhooked. It’s just an anti tunnel perk or to stop getting farmed, killers can slug anyway
---
Easier games means fewer opportunities to gain good emblems.
---
They won't be getting hooked as often and will be looping the Killer for longer.
---
Trust me, I've been playing almost daily since 2.6.0 and have encountered maybe half a dozen red rank Survivors, as a rank 1 Killer.
---
First, in my experience one hit downs are very common. Make Your Choice is common on Nurse, noed is in every other game (which is entirely counterable but that hasn't stopped people begging for a change for it anyway), Hillbilly, Michael, and Leatherface all have powers which one hit down by default, and Trapper and Huntress both have add ons that skip the injured state.
---
Like I said above, I'm going on the assumption that it's currently bugged and attacks like blink strike are intended to trigger the perk but do not, otherwise it's a perk which really only targets like... Trapper and Pig?
---
It would be *better,* not balanced, if all damage counted for MoM, as it would at least affect killers like Billy and Huntress, but Chainsaws 1 hit down, you're dead before a Hillbilly has to land a 4th hit to trigger the perk, and he goes straight from healthy to dying so even if it stacked up you wouldn't get the MoM hit from injured most of the time.
---
*X-files music*
---
"Aggressive map pressure" is not feasible every game, with every killer.  I'm not complaining about survivor perks, my previous statement was about how it's *always* killer perks coming under scrutiny but survivors aren't held to that same standard.  It's a 4v1 game, how much more does the 1 have to handicap themselves?  Survivors set the pace for how much time the killer has to work with.  
---
I'm absolutely not "allowing" gens to get rushed down, you can't defend them all and still be chasing people to hook.  I know gens are THE objective, I don't blame survivors for doing them, but you're just not being objective if you're saying that they don't get done too fast.  Ruin's damn near a necessity to slow things down, provided it doesn't blow up in 30 seconds.  Other than that?  You either find someone quickly and get momentum, or gens start popping in succession.  I've had far too many games where those first 3 gens are done in a matter of 5 minutes, and I fail to see how a killer could really do more in that situation.  
---
I want to reiterate here that I'm not an unreasonable hates-all-survivor-mains player, I think it's the game itself.  When I say gen rush, it's not survivors doing anything they're not supposed to or in an unfair way, it's describing the game being finished too quickly with survivors that know what they're doing.  I don't really hate any survivor perks now that DS is nerfed, maybe Adrenaline is annoying sometimes but other than that, I just think killer and survivor shouldn't be getting shit for whatever perks they're running.
---
How do I get enjoyment out of this game? Do I just have to play as survivor?
---
you seem to be a bit stupid, no one said game was worse balance wise, i and the friend both been with old bnp, vacuum, pallets, exhaustion recovering in chase. he also seen the unspawning hooks. and we are both saying that the problem is in pipping, matchmaking, sounds that got brought with the latest updates.
---
Source on this?
---
For all we know, they just saw the Ash DLC. It would make sense that they acted as a mini-PTB for it.
---
Indeed, met her and Tobin Bell last year at Scarefest in Lexington. 
---
I was stupid and asked her what it was like to be involved in as Amanda in Dead by Daylight. *facepalm* She *very* politely informed me that she had no involvement with Amanda in Dead by Daylight.
---
D'oh!
---
Kind of embarrassing- ok super embarrassing. She told me she played the game with her older son and loved it.
---
She's a very lovely, down to earth woman. :-)
---
Yeah, that's true, this guy recently came out as camping leatherface compensating his life problems in game
---
There are a few killers that are bugged with MoM atm, it was intended that any killer that uses M1 button to attack is affected by MoM
---
I do not have the source however i have seen a few people posting this information with a link to the devs
---
To get enjoyment...you must play nurse and put on a ebony mori and kill everyone of the survivors in that match...and after that when they start loading angry comments say "GG &lt;3" and leave that my child will lead to happiness...
---
Scarefest in Lexington Kentucky
---
There's no need to be an arsehole, mate...
---
The pipping and matchmaking system sucks, but at least it is possible to have good games, albeit occasionally.
---
I believe you
---
Same here for the most part.
---
How'd you find out? The guy who found out refused to tell anyone
---
I still get into matches within a minute on both killer and survivor, unless it's 4 am.
---
So you’re not trying to be try hard yet you’re complaining about killers DCing while playing low rank, you have all purple tier three perks, and you brought in a toolbox. Nice.
---
2nd guy on the left.. I peek.
---
(okay tbh Hag is probably not that bad anyways but m1nners are fucking dogshit rn)
---
Made sure, just in case someone was going to say this is a one sided sub. 
---
Because, I mean, every time one side gets a nerf, that entire loud side comes to Reddit, claiming the devs are opposite-to-them sided.
---
Plague’s corrupt purge and legions frenzy juice gets removed when stunned and it wasn’t fixed with the spirit fix. Sometimes I wonder if they even check their patches.
---
Finally I can get carried as killer
---
Why do killers hit survs on hook and shake heads every time they down you but then ragequit when they 0k?
---
Same answer: degenerates with too much ego and too little balls.
---
For the second perk, I feel like the aura part would just promote some killers to camp you when they otherwise wouldn't, but the delayed notification is an idea that I love
---
You chase them and maybe hit them but never down them or kill anyone. You're an NPC that needs to be just present enough to give them a feeling of accomplishment when they all escape, but if you outplay them once, be it in a fair or unfair way, you are toxic and a piece of shit baby killer gg ez
---
What exactly did she say if you don’t mind me asking. Did she know her character got put into the game or did she know but not get involved.
---
Run it as tight as possible, you can do like .5s stop at the pallet to see if the killer respects/tries to swing through it, if that happens you run another lap and repeat, if they walk through you drop it on their face.
---
Also, do not drop pallets without looping if you're not injured. Looping or saving yourself/allies are the only justified uses for pallets, there aren't enough of them to just waste
---
I used to think that. When a Bubba baited me into exactly that. Now I do not take chances unless I have checked the rest of the map.
---
Why does the killer look exactly like Myers
---
Hahaha. That sounds like the kind of thing I would say if I suddenly found myself stood in front of her.
---
I'm pleased to know she's nice though, and that she was decent enough not to leave you squirming. :-D
---
So?
---
Ooooohh I’m so jealous
---
How do you look? I want to see mine.
---
Really? I've been getting a lot of tunneling killers since I came back lol. I suppose I'm just not good at looping cause I'm rusty.
---
weeds are hard when you’re smoking word
---
I love my little vacuum
---
Go watch the first three (at least) films, mate. They're great.
---
Amanda was a Jigsaw survivor, that's why she has a trap on her head in that picture. The rest of her story... eh, won't spoil it for you.
---
While he chants the Reece’s puffs theme song
---
You know you can press F1 to read killer backstories, right?
---
No but I got the autograph for Christmas last year (My dad got it from Ebay)
---
This is kinda old, I've seen a vid by Paulie Esther on how to do this like in 2017 I think
---
I suppose it's an accidental play on words.
---
I meant fucks spirit as in spirit mains hate players who use iron will since it hard counters tracking during phase walk.
---
Yeah, but it's REALLY situational where you can actually get it to work  and far more add-on reliant than Hillbilly's. The only reason I don't consider him in a 1 hit down alternative perk is that he really needs a good look at/rework after Freddy.
---
Several have said so on their streams.
---
Hybridpanda, for one, specifically said he saw the new killer and it was amazing. I believe on his first stream back. When Ash came out he also talked about knowing about Ash.
---
Painfully
---
I watch trutalent and ive watch monto some but he doesn't always explain much.
---
Ill get some together over tomorrow amd the next day. I tried tonight but it was a lot of tunnelers and campers so i didnt get to do many chases.
---
Watch the Saw films, especially the first 3. But if you insist, I'll spoil it. 
---
Amanda was a victim who escaped a Jigsaw trap, and then became the Killer's apprentice behind the scenes. By the third movie, she's gone completely off the rails. She devises plans against Jigsaw's morals, traps that have no escape. These are in apposition to Jigsaw's twisted traps, which go along the lines of "You have sixty seconds to use a scalpel and dig out your eyesocket, for I have placed a key behind your eye while you were knocked out. If you fail to unlock the device, you're head will be crushed with spikes." 
---
Meanwhile, Amanda's traps are "You're locked in a room, in thirty seconds you'll be electrocuted. The end." And if they do manage to escape, she intervenes and kills them anyway. The Pig mask is something all Jigsaw Apprentices (there's more in the later films) utilize, as is the red coat. She becomes the primary antagonist of the third movie, even apposing Jigsaw, whom the audience begins to rally behind as he's trying his best to stop her. In the end, the genius mastermind succeeds. 
---
Essentially, the outfit she wears in DbD is the outfit all Jigsaw minions wear- and through the course of three films, she went from Victim to apprentice, to an unloyal killer who is completely beyond Jigsaw's control. I imagine the reason why Jigsaw himself wasn't chosen as the Killer in DbD is he's basically a feeble old man with cancer. He managed to get away from Tapp once by premeditating a number of traps ahead of time, and concealing a hidden Assassin's Creed blade under his jacket- but even there, he was limping. 
---
Anyway, I'm rambling about the Saw movies at this point.
---
Asserting his dominance, of course.
---
Used to love kindred as a solo survivor. It really helped in the lower ranks, but since i got in the green ranks no one cares anymore and i won't get saved before second state either way.
---
Now i run small game instead and get tunneled for breaking their hex. Still worth it.
---
Man, thats a dedication! How many days are you doing this already?
---
Plz make more of these xD
---
Lol I can't remember the last time I allowed a LF to chainsaw me.
---
At least one of them mentioned new killer.
---
He has a point. I stipped running noed because if im going to get that group they wont get the last gen done. If i don't get them noed wont stop them either if they are just better players. The only time it has played a huge factor for me is if a killer runs it on me and he has been camping and tunneling the hole time. If its my first hook im okay with it.
---
I like it. It'd be a very nice counter to noed seeing how pretty much every killer uses it. I've barely even used Mettle of Man because 80% of the time I go down it's due to a one shot or an ability. This would actually be a buff for me.
---
Bill ! stop smoking pip !!!
---
It's unfortunate, but you were probably 99.7% or something and it rounds to whole numbers. Sucks to be THAT close, but the line has to be drawn somewhere I guess.
---
Everyone's fanning out over Amanda's actor- rightfully so. But here I am, super jealous that you got to meet Tobin Bell. Gosh, what I wouldn't kill to get a photograph/autograph with him. Even better would be a video where he says something Jigsaw would say.
---
On PC? What rank are you?
---
Can we please have a chaos game mode with more survivors and killers sounds so fun
---
Nobody *lets* Leatherface chainsaw them. You gain ground, and ram the saw up their backside. Don't even start charging it until you're on top of them. 
---
It's situational, but with practice it works against even experienced Survivors.
---
The recolors are insulting. Those should all come standard with the character,
---
youre entirely right and i think its a big reason people are so casual about it. i like most of the fog whisperers but seeing them make jokes out of DCing and doing it at the drop of a hat makes wanna slam my head against a wall
---
This is the origins of Dead by Daylight: Battle Royale, isn't it? Killers and survivors are going to parachute in and have to open chests to unlock perks, items, add-ons, and offerings.
---
I agree completely. As soon as I saw MoM in the leak I knew BHVR fucked up. (again) This rework isn't bad. It's situational, but so are all survivor perks.
---
At least they stayed till the end. My survivors always like to DC before they're killed like it means they've won or something.
---
&gt;What if you’re the last one left and all the chests have been opened? What if one teammate is dead and another is hooked and you can’t find the third teammate. What if everyone else is chased or injured
---
All of these scenarios are due to the killer snowballing. If you let the killer snowball into power like this, it means you were not pressuring gens and were wasting time. 
---
An easy way to waste time is to self-care. Self-caring some more won't fix the issue that self-caring at the start (when you should of been on generators) caused.
---
Thiccness
---
Every time other survivor is taking the hit 1/2/3 m away from you, you take damage instead. There is a 50% chance you would get deep wounds status instead of downed from such a hit
---
Every time I get to P350 with all perks I feel so accomplished ... then I remember I've got 5 more killers to go and in a few months we'll be getting another one.
---
Yea, but a lot of people think that it's a status effect and not a health state. Just warning people
---
Pharmacy over Plunderer's.
---
Does going against multiply killers count? That glitch is spreading like wildfire.
---
[No, this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rGy6FuGdeYk)
---
on Sunday 4 killers in a row dc'd on me. that's what happens when a rank 1 survivor gets cucked to rank 9
---
I agree and if they are consistent I am betting the summer killer will be licensed. So no buying with shards. I am not mad about them making money **at all**. I just wish they'd fix the game they have before adding in new features, perks etc.
---
I say those 2 because they arent toxic or as toxic as some other streamers.
---
How does this happen? I am very confused
---
As a P3 Nurse who started playing after the lovely shinies... I really love the look if it :(
---
I had heard long ago that they had played with ideas of 2v2, 3v3, etc. I was under the impression that they had removed this possibility from the game but had heard of people finding ways to activate it a long long time ago and it being fixed.
---
If this is a fresh video I guess they reintroduced the bug that allows you to glitch it.
---
If you don't like his posts, scroll past them. No reason to be rude.
---
He provides content that people like and if you aren't one of them, you know how the downvote button works.
---
woulda liked it better with doctor. Y'know cuz sparks, eh?
---
I love everything about this. This is one of the high effort posts that needs to stay on hot
---
I was looking for a The Plague model where she was standing as she is when she is walking, with the incense burner in front of her
---
Probably the wraith doesn't want to kill you. He just wants to show you his fire song that he practiced so long for!
---
Why do I have to follow rules that people come up with? If I see someone I go after them I'm not super good at the game I just wanna kill people.
---
It's really making it hard I'll try again tomorrow and maybe itll be better
---
Yeaaaah no. DS got nerfed to hell, this perk doesn’t need nerfed too.
---
It should just be the phone version
---
Haven't heard anything but it wouldn't surprise me. People don't play much Freddy but Legion causes regular disconnects when disconnecting is a major current issue. Not fixing Legion probably hurts player count and reviews more than leaving Freddy in the dumpster.
---
^I get this:)
---
It's my bro, It's all cool
---
this is pretty cool
---
though people would probably confuse him for legion frank from afar
---
Why do you need noed when you have ruin?
---
Nice. What tools are you using etc?
---
Do you play on console? If you don’t, you can’t speak for us. It takes 10-20 minutes to find a match now. Before they reverted it back to the shitty matchmaking, it only took a couple seconds. Even at rank 12 during the daytime, it still takes 10 or more minutes to find a game as survivor now. It’s almost unplayable at this point for us console players.
---
Thanks man!
---
Oh yeah, game is fucked atm, but sound issues are just bugs that can be fixed.
---
The previous issues weren't bugs, but intended parts of the game, unlikely to just be fixed in a patch.
---
I'm confident that several of the current problems will be fixed in the mid-chapter patch, the PTB for which should be coming next Tuesday.
---
As I already stated the source is the first or maybe second stream he returned. He even said "One of the things I can tell you ..." Other streamers have talked about this too. In fact other streamers have said/hinted at even more than Panda.
---
New killer/survivor/map every three months why do you think this is not the case?
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Like it. I don't fully agree with your assessment of MoM in its current state, but I prefer your version of your perk.
---
Love that as well. Played a match as leatherface with an ebony mori &amp; franklin’s. Saw in post game that a few survivors had a ultra rare key and map they brought in lol
---
Them nerfing DS then releasing MOM was pretty dirty.
---
I once tried to play this game on a weak laptop giving me &lt;30 FPS.
---
I had to guess skill checks somezimes because they would sometimes show up to late because of random spikes in FPS loss.
---
Other than that sometimes skill checks decide to pop up the second i decide to let go of the gen. This happens more often than i like to admit.
---
Sometimes i fail them on purpose if i see someone getting hooked across the map hoping the killer makes his way over to me.
---
Theoretically you get every teachable Perk for free over the shrine with shards. But with perk you can get is random and change each week. This week self-care from claudette is good. PS: BBQ from leatherface was only once in the shrine and that was 2017, so when you want that perk better buy leatherface.
---
Imagine getting banned just because you found a bug
---
That makes sense as well! Although that hasn't been my experience in most of my matches unfortunately
---
This is nice.
---
Add in some hearty spirit moans
---
Spine Chill, Resilience, No Mither, Dead Hard :(
---
Hey guys out of many, many games played I have had this instance where I spawned beside a totem, game so broke right? how could a poorly optimized game like this have that happen occasionally!? *I uploaded a pic of it now can I get upvotes?*
---
Put it back
---
&gt; barley
---
[This](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barley) is barley btw :P
---
Not everyone is a god like you.
---
Don't let the perks discourage you, it's not as bad as you might think.
---
I recently tried out huntress with level1, so all i had was her lullaby on rank1, against 4 survivors completly stacked with meta perks (2 of them SWF) somewhere around rank10.
---
I still managed to 4k them and it wasn't even stressful. Perks sure give you an advantage but if you just protect 3 gens and patrol them the best the survivors can hope for is a 3k with a hatch escape at the end.
---
I sometimes when I play nurse act like I am really bad for the first gen or maybe 2 so they get really cocky and then I just go back to being good and them still thinking "he sucks" a sweet 4k like that tasty
---
I'm not young, and didn't say anything disrespectful, mind your own business.
---
decisive is useless if you don’t tunnel, same with borrowed time.
---
mettle of man, just play a killer that it doesn’t work on.
---
adrenaline, just kill them before the gens are done
---
The only few times I DC as killer is when I know I am just being worse then trash and is now wasting survivors time and my own sanity while also wanting to throw my computer out the window so I DC I would have still lost sure the survivors get less points but eh 
---
And I know No0b3 used to derank to mess with noobs but then he made a video saying "people that do this are a problem" if he still does it then he is being hypocritical but usually when people DC it is out of pure rage or you just notice "no I just can't keep this up"
---
legion
---
damn- made me peek 😂
---
VPL on fa right also
---
PS4, Rank 7 killer. Since the pipping change I've been kicked down to Survivor rank 15 since i can't pip regardless of how good I do now, I still get full matches within a minute or two.
---
Rank 1 is dead at this point and has nothing to so with matchmaking. I'd suggest trying to find a deranking group.
---
thanks!
---
Sorry but the only time Leatherface is getting a chainsaw is if the survivor mispositions themselves or you were camping the basement. Simply being near any vault will prevent the chainsaw. 
---
Its a shame because its really fun to chainsaw as Leatherface, its like driving a car except its a chainsaw. Zooming around with Beasts Marks is always fun. But its prettybhard to get a chainsaw even against potatoes.
---
everything you said! plus without any exhaustion perks (i dont count adrenaline) chases won't last very long. and no self care it'd be an easy win!
---
Oh, it isnt recent. They've been doing it in mass again ever since they brought the old match making system back. It's what made lobbies impossible to find to begin with. I've been saying that for a long ass time. Then out of the blue their own network team came out and said exactly what I've been saying for months now. Lobby dodging killers are putting huge holes in the queue times for everyone including solo queue survivors and the current system we're on now doesn't know how to fill those holes so we all wait until those holes in the queue system time out and move to the next one. I solo queue a lot and had 5 killers in a row just bail before I've even seen who's on my team. It's fucking shitty.
---
But you know, the devs for some reason think the current health of the game in the current state with the old match making system is "fine." Pretty good job so far. The only good job they've done is manage to kill any interest a lot of people have to want to play the fucking game. Campfire simulator is boring as fuck.
---
"I'll, loop the shit, out of you"
---
I've had this happen many times and it goes all the way back to the Beta for me. It's far more rare now than it was back then but it still happens. Last time it happened to me was a few days ago.
---
You should have gone for the head, bitch.
---
I love this totem spot.
---
Had situation like you, tried to go away by corridor you have on your right - I decided taking this totem off in first second is a bad idea if killer decides to check it first in the match. And since I knew where it was from the start, it wouldn't hurt to come back in some time or send my commed SWF there.
---
Aaaaand, I met Bubba at the end of this passage, got downed and facecamped til death. Quality gameplay, 10/10 would reccomend :D
---
.
---
looks pretty dope
---
Hey, could you send me a pm, or say it here, about how to do this? I'd like to try it out with my friends lol
---
It would make things worse. The reason people are toxic is because holding M1 on gens for 80 seconds is boring. The chase is where the fun is at. You want to make the boring aspect of playing survivor even longer?
---
I like you all say Console yet xbox is fine just ps4 is trash XD
---
Unlucky
---
I only did it once against a chinese player. It was back in the day where you could not see the ping. I couldn't move anywhere because the ping was so high
---
After some bad games I put on plunder’s and just run around giving items to people and sacrificing myself.

MoM is bugged at the moment, in a few weeks it's going to be on even more than it already is because as intended, it will affect Nurse and Hag, and everyone else who has a deviousness event on their M1.
---
On the topic of Flip Flop I'd prefer Tenacity over unbreakable as it lets you get as far from a hook as possible while you charge up the flop.
---
 To let last survivor take the hatch or to avoid being moried
---
He’s just jelly :P
---
I really like your posts and subscribed to your channel, keep it up!
---
Yep, everything will be fine
---
On PS4 and Xbox you will and I’m sure about pc too
---
Appreciate it!
---
this is the wholesome story i need.
---
Is he from a movie cause that backstory seems like it could be from one
---
As a junior video game designer, yes that is how it works
---
Looks pretty nice for the second try :)

---
If you're running we're going to live forever, please put borrowed time.
---
Not to mention you would need double the survivors, hooks and generators, which would require a larger map, *which in turn would most likely have to be done from the scratch*, as well as designing the map so that it's balanced enough for all different killers and survivors.
---
This game mode would be fucking awesome tho. It's probably just too big of an operation to make it a thing.
---
same, used to be a Killer Main, but after returning to the game, I constantly deranked and got rushed as Killer.
---
Now when I play Survivor, I get a pip every game, unless the game crashes, multiple People DC or the Killer lags.

Don't even bother with reading the messages and move on. I get the concept is disheartening, but you shouldn't care whatsoever what strangers have to say about you, period. Ignore and play how you want.
---
Been a while since I've seen this bug! Always fun.
---
You guys know what I think?
---
This bug has been known for months, probably over half a year now.
---
As a survivor when I’m the last one left I’ll sneak around and as soon as it becomes obvious that the killer is looking for the hatch I’ll just do gens. Forces them to choose between defending the objectives or leaving the hatch unprotected. 
---
Don’t understand the mentality of only going for the hatch when it spawns, it’s not like the exit gates shut down. Yes the gates will take ages but you get the advantage of there being three possible routes of escape so unless you’re facing a high mobility killer it’s easy to get out if you play smart at that stage
---
I think it's just the 'killer' that has it no matter the model since it does become stretched as if its supposed to be for a larger model (which it is).

---_I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically._
---
You’re getting downvotes but it’s exactly this. The hatch isn’t suddenly the only way to escape  when it opens, it’s simply another way to pressure the killer which makes up for there only being one person left
---
The way survivors use it make the hatch more of a hinderance than the pressuring tool it’s supposed to be
---
All it does is tell me I need to follow tags.
---
But pharmacy would still be useful for healing others. If you want to maximise the uselessness of the build self care is better.
---
A moment of silence for our lost brother
---
Yeah, secret offerings themselves aren’t a bad idea the way they are now but when there’s only two options mori or shroud of separation and you start next to someone it’s like welp.
---
I’m not having as much as an extreme as you, but I have definitely seen some difference, gens are getting done at remarkable rates... even when I’m hooking someone and immediately chasing someone else, they still seem to have a perfect flow now of someone always on a gen
---
It’s impossible to be everywhere at once.. it’s a bummer, but that’s the game as if now... not really sure how they could fix it though tbh
---
ty so much T////T &lt;3
---
Well I haven't played much solo honestly but when I did I had a couple of good mathces. Might have been just luck considering the low number of mathces but still.
---
What if some skins also changed the heat beat noise. So if you had this clown skin it would be a creepy circus noise for the terror radius. That would be live
---
I'm out of the loop since I never cared about F13, what happened?
---
That’s exactly what’s happening to me. I was a rank one killer every season, and got consistent 4K’s... now the game is heavily tailored on the survivors side.
---
There's an add-on that gives the survivor exposed status for a direct bottle hit.
---
That is so disrespectful, not every other work is a shitpost.
---
I’ve just had enough you know. I have played killer and only killer for 2 years and genuinely loved the game to death... but ever since this last patch it’s no fun playing killer like I used to have. I’m probably over reacting, and I’ll go back to killer, but for the meantime it’s survivor for now.
---
Que?
---
Well there was a lawsuit going on over the franchise with the original creators and someone else who thought he had ownership over it. It halted anything licensed that was promised from ever being made/put into the game. I think it’s still abandoned but seems like there is more to it.
---
Yes but lots of maps also have tall objects

Apart from being kicked from the game, I've only DCed a few times.
---
- something needing my attention IRL
---
- being tunneled off hook within the first minute of the game after several games that went extremely poorly. I only get frustrated enough to do this when they completely ignore the other survivors to go after me when I'm unhooked and I haven't even had a chance to touch a generator or totem or anything.
---
Bit of a late reply, But i recommend You just pick up Survivor, it only gets worse But when You yourself Are a surv the most you'll get is a salty killer saying you genrushed which most of the Time is hilarious because they usually use garbage killers like Legion or suck at using Trapper/Billy.
---
Yeah, I had that once as a killer where only Japanese entered my lobby, so weird
---
Stolas?
---
No fuck that bitch he shouldn't exist
---
Seems legit
---
They're just joking around
---
Is your internet bad? Lots of survivors will DC if the killer has shitty connection.
---
I like your style
---
Glad I'm not the only weirdo out there...
---
Yes, I agree with you. Even the tutorial tells you that you goal as a survivor is to repair the generator and then escape before the killer gets you, so even the game itself says its the point of the game. I myself don't complain that killers... kill. Of course I am sometimes annoyed if he camps the hook then but still.
---
As a Russian I can confirm, my mother used to sing this for me to put me to sleep. Felt kinda weird to hear it in game for the first time
---
How did you do it? If you showed it in the clip, I'm sorry, I'm just dumb.
---
Oh yea, had once a swf match and they all had dead hard, flashlights, and other stuff ofc. I was wraith, they were potato. Good memories, especially when 2 of them dc as they were on the hook and then say in the chat "we just wanted to have fun"
---
Vanish two survivors after started matching.
---
It’s probably something along the lines of queuing normally, while in a KYF lobby, while switched to the killers side.
---
Both.
---
It hasnt been a 'known thing', but a while ago this glitch was around and got patched. Back then it was even more crazy because you switch powers and perks on some killers.
---
That's not true, I'll find the dev stream where they talked about it for ya
---
I thought he was hanging for a second
---
Okay. It’s the stream about prove thyself changes when it was reworked
---
7-8-9
---
Haha, im kinda afraid of that
---
;) 
---
*upvote intensifies*
---
Not the same thing at all. NOED is a perk which can get deleted before the end game is even a factor. It's annoying but counterplay actually exists in the form of running small game and knowing totem spawns. MoM builds up and triggers off something as basic as getting M1'd and can be equipped by 4 people to further waste your time.
---
As someone who plays a lot of m1 killers I appreciate it.
---
Exactly this. Tunnelling takes a single survivor out of the game. Split pressure takes 2-4 out of the game and buys you much more time.
---
Sure you may be able to tunnel that one down but by that time the gens will be done and all 3 others escaped.
---
Gen rushing is only done to bad killers who let it be done. The game as a killer is all about time and buying yourself as much as possible. Camping/tunnelling will both get you destroyed at high ranks.
---
It’d take too long to type out. If you care this much you can watch [this](https://youtu.be/EzOmrUvLkKI) *hour* long video from Pappus. It explains everything that happened, honestly he probably missed a few things, been awhile since I watched it. It gets a bit whiney and drags on for far too long so I understand if you dont want to watch it.
---
The biggest take away is that the Developers (GUN and illfonic) knew before launch that the lawsuit would happen that would prevent them from releasing any new content on the game, aka preventing them from milking the community further. They used the lawsuit as a way to just GTFO and abandon the game. They were essentially setting up for a quick cash grab. Now let me remind you this was already funded through Kickstarter and sold millions of copies across all platforms and sold DLC cosmetic and kill packs. 
---
I could go on and on, but the most important thing for you to know is that to NOT buy or support a game published by GUN media or developed by illfonic.
---
I want to know too
---
i usually end up savibg it for end game body blocks. either that or i dont get it at all due to ability hits
---
Just run noed lmao
---
Ahhh okay, so if I'm in the pallet whilst whizzing my chainsaw, it'll hit my head first!  That makes sense, will try and be more aware of that XD 
---
Think I definitely need more practice with him,  I did write him off at first, with people saying he's just for camping.  I've pulled off some very satisfying moves with him though, he's definitely growing on me now.  Need to get used to his chainsaw charge.
---
Same here
---
Don't have Borrowed Time yet, but I'm close to Lv. 35 with my Bill!
---
No Mither, Adrenaline, Self Care and Mettle of Man
---
I don’t wanna sound demanding or anything but can someone translate this to English?
---
That..that has to be fake! It had to be like a billy or smth, but legion?!?
---
Dude tell me that you're about to spoiler lmao
---
wink wonk ;3
---
Especially for Myers. He's always dragging people around in the movies.
---
10/10 nobody can change my mind xd
---
So he is the best and the worst?
---
i play a lot of spirit and hag so i get u
---
I play on PS4. I understand how bad it is. What I'm saying is:
---
1. The problem lies with RANKING not MATCHMAKING. It's important to clarify this, as BHVR need to know what to fix. The reason it was faster right after 2.6.0 is because the matchmaking had too wide a rank range. I frequently saw brown rank Survivors going up against red rank Killers. This was unacceptable. The current issue is because Survivors can't reach red ranks.
---
2. The game is really bad, but revert the pipping changes and it's possibly the best it has ever been.
---
I hate mori animations of the most killers and dont want to watch them, so I disconnect to avoid negative emotions, simple as that
---
&gt;Last game as survivor: Completed one gen and died right away after... and I pippep...
---
Unless you're a rank 20 I'm gonna call bullshit on that one.
---
I DC because the game makes me DC, I kid you not it will just DC and tell me that the killer DC'd but my friends are still in. Also happens to my friends, was healing my mate and he just DC'd. I think people need to stop presuming thats its all by choice sometimes because the current state of the game in regards to performance and stability is pretty shit lol
---
so much for line of sight within 32m prevention
---
MoM punishes more than tunneling, I run into other people’s chases just go get stacks with it. Then do dumb unhooks where I should go down and don’t and we all get away.
---
UwU stabby me in the abbies daddi
---
I wont use MoM either except in my meme builds because after using it and seeing it in play the perk isnt really that strong.
---
 If I told you that you could run a perk that is strong against Freddy/Wraith/Trapper/Leatherface/Pig (all low tier killers), not very good against Myers/Hag/Spirit(high mid-high tier killers), and completely useless against Nurse/Billy/Huntress (all high tier killers), would you run that perk?
---
Its basically overkill against the killers its strong against - they are already weak killers so you dont need to run a perk that makes them weaker. And then its a dead perk against strong killers and pretty low impact against strong killers, which is a huge downside to keep in mind.
---
I’d rather run any other meta perk than MoM in my serious builds. Its honestly not that strong and is way overrated.
---
Explain?
---
Am I right in thinking Prove Thyself is actually INCREASING repair speed more than the penalty you get for tag-teaming a gen?
---
That might be something very fun to play! I hope they add some "troll" modes in the future like other games im some days like April's fools.
---
Once I got matched against an AFK killer, while I was cleansing a dull totem, my teammates do the last gen and his Hex NOeD spawns in the dull totem while I was cleansing it lmao.
---
The free weekend is now over, but dbd costs 15 instead of thirty
---
It should still at least
---
How does this happen?
---
As a mostly killer player that is an absolutely intentional and also intended "feature"/thing that I do. The trick is that you have to let go of the attack button before you get hit by the pallet. If you were within range to hit them then you will hit them even if you get stunned. The stun does not cancel your attack hit zone. Basicly I'm just hitting you before you are stunning me, but just barely in time. Makes survivors think twice before getting greedy with pallets.
---
How do you manage to do this?
---
His problem is that he’s just a less rewarding but easier to use huntress. You’re better off learning Huntress as she can completely ignore most pallet loops and has a super high skill ceiling. Clown has the same downside that Huntress has (low map pressure) while also being less rewarding and ultimately weaker.
---
I FINALLY DID IT OH MY GOD NEVER PLAYING FREDDY AGAIN FOR ATLEAST 3 MONTHS
---
Possibly.
---
Its because of the achivments
---
If you escape out the hatch without doing all five gens is that a fail, or is there more to the game than gens
---
What's the difference between two people being out for 20, or one for 40? I guess 2@20 is a little better but not massively?
---
Difference is the effort to look for totems is divided among 4 people compared to one killer having to deal with 4 people running MoM like I just did.
---
Key because I’m an ass
---
That’s already the case, reread the description.
---
You do so.
---
If pips/rank are supposed to representation of your skill, why should you be rewarded for something that takes none?
---
If a red rank survivor escapes against a brown rank brand new killer, should they Pip? 
---
If Magnus Carlsen beats a brand new chess player does his rating go up? 
---
Its ludicrous. 
---
Stop worrying about irrelevant pips to make you feel better about yourself. If youre good at the game, youll rank up. If youre constantly upset your arent ranking up, you arent as good as you think.
---
&gt;now the game is heavily tailored on the survivors side.
---
Literally nothing changed in game for you to make this claim. Either you arent as good as you think you are or you are going against 4 amazing survivors on a strong map
---
It takes 44 seconds with 2 people WITH the penalty.
---
1 person running provethyself negates the penalty.
---
But you have to remember the penalty upon multiple survivors keeps gens from being done in under 20 seconds.
---
Yes this is possible and i have done it with 3 survivors and it's completely unfair
---
Honestly those are wasting their chance at getting distance, so it's not that hard to down them
---
Ah yes, leader the perk that makes you heal, open gates and cleanse totems faster is extremely busted when combined with Prove Thyself, the perk that removes the penalty for tag teaming a generator. Big brain redditor.
---
I understand tunneling to a certain degree, especially if that one player is the one doing a lot of unhooking, healing etc. but I don't understand tunneling when you are chasing me across the map for ages while 2 generators are beeing completed. Just start paying attention to the guys who are actually repairing generators and don't focus solely on me.
---
It says « Bounce back gain A token. »
---
And then new sentence : -&gt;description of what happens when you have two tokens
---
Its easier to pip the higher rank you are and harder to pip the lower rank you are.
---
Oh my bad uwu
---
Completely understand the sentiment, it can’t be argued that playing killer can be rough. Bully SWF groups have such a negative experience for both sides of the game that their toxicity spreads
---
Killers get more bitter, which survivors get the brunt of etc. It’s part of how killer and survivor mains can be so divided. These same groups then use this divide and toxicity to justify their actions, not understanding (or refusing to accept) the concept of cause and effect. 
---
By no means is this a hit at SWF groups in general. In many ways it can be the most fun experience for both sides, as I enjoy playing with my friends occasionally and when playing killer seeing some clutch plays being pulled off by them brings a mew aspect to the game. A group entering a game with the specific, direct aim to anger and harass the killer or any random survivors they meet is absolutely one of the problems with our DBD community in general
---
Rant aside, enjoy the change of pace and view of things. For all it’s faults it is overall a great game, simply unfortunate that it has the single most broken (In terms of toxicity and division) community I’ve experienced. And I’ve played the old Call of Duty games(!)
---
I was a rank 6 survivor and no im not bullshitting... I didn’t give the greatest detail but that’s what basically happened that game...
---
Told you so x)
---
It's more the devs telling you what to do, since disconnecting is a reportable offense. I'm just hoping for stricter punishments for selfish people who make other people's playing experience less fun.
---
I’m not stupid... I’m saying that what it takes to pip as survivor is WAY easier than to pip as killer.
---
I had that happen to me today. I was opening the gate, was injured and the killer right next to me, it had already three lights but wasn't open yet. For some reason the killer didn't even try to attack me but just disconnected. I don't get that. Why not stopping the gate from opening yet and get at least one kill (I had been hooked before)?
---
Holy shit what an enormous shitshow, thanks for that TLDR! Kinda glad I never got into the game, I really feel bad for all the fans though :(
---
I had someone mention that I should make the whole crew which is on my to do list.
---
What a shitshow, I feel really bad for the fans :/
---
It's funny when they tbag you first but after a while everybody are hooked twice and only 2 gens are done and thats when they realize the shit gets real.
---
Funny how I wanted to let the most toxic one but also the only one still alive to gen the gen done so the hatch would appear (only one gen was done) because 2 of them DC'ed but he refused
---
Yes great skill checks mean you can get a heal done with leader insanely fast. Leader means you walk by someone on a totem and its done even faster at the beginning of the game so that the killer has no chance to get to his totem. Great skill checks on prove thyself gens is retarded fast.
---
We often laugh about how balanced flying through that last gen in about the time it takes to do a totem.
---
In my group we always have at least 1 leader. And 2 prove thyself to insure 30 sec gens after 3 have been done.
---
Got any snacks?
---
Yeah XD
---
I went ahead and bought it, with many dlcs 
---
I’m having a blast
---
Out of context, it sounds like you just got an ordinary game of DbD. I mean I bet someone was like "Well duh, of course you did". Then again in another bit of context it would be good because of the amount of people getting infinite loading screens or just failing to connect to the game. But THIS?! This is something quite simply... \*Groovy...\*
---
me, always
---
I enjoy this concept
---
Doritos and Gummy Worms.
---
Only in a SWF. Devs won't add so much as a totem counter to close the gap between that and solo.
---
Lol, that’s awesome
---
I have a similar story, the killer was chasing my friend and someone on our team popped the last gen.  
---
Low and behold a dull totem right in front of me as I was running to a gate lit up lol.  I managed to cleanse it just before my friend got tagged and we all escaped
---
Especially on Pale Rose.
---
The whole song is some guy saying he “eats pussy” doesn’t sound like he put that much effort into it
---
I’ll trade half my cosmic brownie for some gummy worms
---
Pigs always run NOED and tunnel
---
SlOw ThE gAmE dowN JuST A LittLe Bit
---
Nope. Look up “dead by daylight survivor.” There’s this pic and another where it shows the original 4. Everyone is the same except for Meg and Dwight. Dwight looked like this and Meg has clothes that look remarkably like Kate’s. The only survivor in this time period to have glasses is Claudette so it has to be her.
---
Its bannable offense in case of excessive disconnecting, and I haven't been restricted yet, so I guess Im alright. About fun, only people I can possibly ruin fun for are killers who brought mori into the game and they sure as hell don't care about survivors' fun at all, so I guess Im alright
---
It isn't that simple as just "Hire more people" for a small business.  There are way more things to think about when it comes to growth and expansion. You have to be doing really well to be able to hire say, 2 new employees, and you have to be able to justify the worth of these. If there is no value in it then it doesn't work from a business perspective.
---
Then you have to figure out who to hire. A developer? (Expensive) community managers? Game testers? People to work on issues, or people to work on new content, or people to work on security/hackers?
---
Then is there even the talent you need locally? Do you have a decent employee pool? Is there training needed? How can you get the new employee to work in the same ethos as the company - design the game in the same way, etc...
---
For an extreme instance: a perfectionist game developer might only want to work on the game himself as to not sell-out the idea - or to make it in the gritty way he wants to.
---
Sure it is easy to say - you are making money just hire more people! But anyone who has worked in small office based businesses will just laugh. Things take time and care and be sure everyone is constantly busy and has different focuses. And all these focuses need to have money at the end of them.
---
Be sure that every business wants to hire as many people as possible. Growth is always a goal, but it is never as easy as just "hire more - boom, now you can do 3 times as much"
---
Damn. A lot of those are great. Love the workarounds. Is Myers mask from Star Wars and are you gonna do landmarks like Autohavens gas stop or are you just doing characters?
---
After deleting it though make sure to wait like 30 minutes for all your saved content to download after downloading the actual game.
---
I've been using it since DS was nerfed and it hasn't saved me at all in higher ranks. 
---
When I first started playing a couple of years ago I had a lot more luck wiggling off the killer shoulders. I'm not sure if it's because the killers were really inexperienced, or if it was just easier to wiggle off back then.
---
It's what happens when the developers want the money that having a console version can provide. 
---
A working game, though? An afterthought.
---
They're happy as long as you keep buying the cosmetics from the store and the DLCs.
---
What does the other side say?
---
Honestly thought he was being sacrificed.
---
They are struggling to balance 1 v 4  
---
I don't think beyond that is really possible lol
---
Here’s the thing. PC chat is easier so they don’t have to be that mad to use it. But on console... Theybhas to get out of their way to directly message you just to talk shit. I prefer the filter of slightly tilted stuff. I like em big and I like em salty.
---
There seems to be an issue on my phone where it’s too blurry for me to zoom in and read :/
---
Mind giving me the rundown?
---
Haha I feel that
---
But the pc also allows (which I’ve gotten many so far) a full swf to all jump in on you rofl
---
It’s gold
---
Jealous of what? Being a contrarian who makes unfunny videos...? Nice mental gymnastics.
---
Nice one, mate. Please do a Michal :D
---
It's been on my bloodweb 10 times now. And counting
---
it’s two perks, I was running Plunderers Instinct (Chests) and Windows of Opportunity (Vaults and Pallets).
---
Yes. When I look at games that are ridiculously fun I often see balance is out of the question, and you'd think that's really bad, but usually what the game developers do or what I think they do at least, is make everything fucking overpowered. So it all balances everything out. If devs try to make everything balanced and simple it gets sort of bland and boring. If you look at a game like Titanfall 2 though, nearly everything in that game looks pretty fucking strong and I like that. Except some pilot types are sorta weak but besides that all of your gun choices for weapons and titans are pretty good.

---
Why did they all DC at same time? PC players are the definition of toxic
---
I have played against MoM a few times now, and tbh?  I don't really get the OP complaints vs the perk.  The few times it triggered, I just body blocked the Ash against a tree or a wall and hit him again for the down.  I don't find it all that busted.
---
Yesterday was disgusting
---
A billy with ruin lol. Cool.
---
Not sure if Sole Survivor combos to remove the aura reveal of Mettle of Man but if it does it could be pretty useful now.

What did you do?

Billy isn’t nurse. He still has to deal with pallets
---
Sorry, Hansen and PARK pharmaceuticals? Jake Park?
---
Try walking away, killer finds you because "AHHG, OOOO, AGAHAHA", get downed. It's why I run Iron Will cuz injured survs are so damn loud.
---
Securing 200bp for sacrifice instead of a 5k escape. I don't camp hooks at the end JUST BECAUSE it's easy points to hit other survivors and maybe get another hook. Makes for more exciting gameplay.
---
As a Freddy main, I appreciate it. It sucks when I get harshly penalized for trying to down survivors.
---
It's all good.
---
They were kinda like [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ba7cib/groovy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x)
---
Coooool :)
---
It's a shit perk.
---
Umm what
---
If the basement isn't in the grim pantry its strong there too. That's about it
---
I’m just saying that because that’s what I have, I don’t know how it goes on Xbox, I dread the Switch port though.
---
We can see the embed video, mate.
---
Typical survivor main. Just ignore the crying.
---
I don't DC.  As a killer, I'm sorely tempted when the survivors are screwing around after clearly being able to exit but I just park my ass facing a wall and put the controller down and get a sandwich.  By the time I get back they usually get tired and leave.
---
When I play survivor?  I don't see much point since I won't maximize my points.  I get tunneled  and camped and that just means I'm off to the next game faster.  MEH.
---
I just don't take the game personally.  I don't get salty.
---
why the fuck your wallet got blood in it
---
Thats a recreated bug,where you start 4 killers vs 1 survivor. Was on the subreddit yesterday.
---
I’ve never encountered this and I feel left out.
---
this is so fucking good. like holy fuck. (and as a fucking skrub, i will immediately use the first perk CONSTANTLY.)
---
Change your settings or even better try to get them to call you “gay” it ends up in a 7 day suspension I use the trick all the time and it tells me “action has been taken”
---
Okay I'm sure they'll stop releasing every three months then. I'm sure there won't be a likely licensed killer coming around june and the content creators that saw a new killer are totally lying. 🙄
---
I guess but he's not gonna be in the position to instadown all the time so he may have to do a  longer chase. Especially vs survivors who know what they are doing.
---
Ultra-Hard Mode Unlocked.
---
Requirements: Disconnect as a Survivor. Go on. Dare you.
---
Not Laurie all her perks are terrible
---
Do you think that the players left in a 3v1 are going to have fun?
---
Decisive and OOO work good for me.
---
sweet mother of god. RIP survivor
---
What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land
---
Lol “ooo”
---
well im just trying to avoid a hatch stand off situation
---
Yeah that's why I mentioned IW before. Still it doesn't strike me as especially fair thought that survivors are the only ones to blame if killer is tunneling them when they don't have some specific setup
---
I can understand that, when the match is unplayable. I had to once when I couldn't move and the match wouldn't end.
---
Even though camping and tunneling is frustrating for a survivor it is a part of the game. Should a killer DC because they are being looped endlessly or blinded constantly?
---
It happens. I like Iron Will because it allows great jukes after pallet slams in jungle gyms so I use it anyways.
---
It will do but sole survivor only works best when your team is dead, so what is the point? lol
---
It's a symptom. Killers play that way because gens go too fast most of the time. I would love to play without Ruin, but it's typically mandatory against good survivors with a killer other than Nurse or Billy.
---
As a newer player, NOED will help offset some of your misplays and bad calls. An until you really get some time in as killer you may need to rely on it to clutch you a kill or two.
---
But the perk is seen as a crutch and it "rewards bad players for being bad". 
---
As a new player, I say run it until you feel like you no longer need it, as relying on it will limit your ceiling, but don't wait for it.
---
Pretend you don't have it an when it does proc, understand your not really "earning" your kills.
---
Most importantly, have fun and don't let the salt get to you.
---
Exactly haha, that’s like Wraith using insidious. M1 is easier to do than a chainsaw but not so much that you’d give up a perk slot
---
Never seen an insidious wraith lol
---
There’s a reason for that xD
---
Deerstalker isn't useless, just wildly unessecary. Can occasionally help, which is why it's at E tier.
---
Thanks! I've already tried a few like Hillbilly and Nurse. I'll take your advise and maybe play a match for each killer! 
---
Just don't want to get too reliant on Pig's no terror radius to easily find people lol
---
Ruin - Slow the game down just a little bit, especially with legion since he's a pretty weak killer
---
BBQ - Find survivors easily after hooking one and bloodpoints
---
M&amp;A - 16 meter radius when out of chase, allowing you to sneak up on people. 32 meter radius when in a chase, allowing you to chain hits easier because of your bigger radius and knowing where survivors are. M&amp;A is seriously the most perfect perk for legion 
---
Sloppy butcher OR Thanatophobia - Legion injures survivors easily so adding the extra time to heal is nice. Thanatophobia if people don't heal  against you, gives then a penalty for not healing
---
It would be great with OoO if it didn’t get you killed first. I guess with a build that relies on you staying in the killer’s terror radius there could be meme potential...
---
Could be just a lack of knowledge how to play killers. Are these killers stacked when you’re going up against them? Or are they low level? I just started playing killer and sometimes I unintentionally tunnel because I forget who I’ve been chasing (especially if the survivors look the same lol). 
---
Also, the rank system is all fucked up right now, so it could be due to that aspect of it. These perks however seem to be in every fucking build, so I understand your frustration.
---
I feel the exact same way. And that's not mentioning the survivor wait times for matches and the amounts of times killers Dodge lobbies with a full server.
---
Me too man, I hate all of his skins, they're all ugly. All other killers have really nice skins except Billy Boi,which is quite unfortunate since Billy is one of the most popular killers
---
I didnt know your mom watched you while you play
---
bricc torso
---
Ruin itself I don't mind. It is the combination of perks like Ruin or NOED and camping or tunneling, or all of these that triggers me
---
Damn it mom. You got me BHVR’d.
---
MoM and no mither go well together if you mind the fact that billy and bubba wont even try to m2 you.
---
The only bettee combo is MoM and any other perk
---
Lol, I usually find that everyone has their “main” killer they like best, but also play a few or many others as well for fun
---
I’d say at least 2-3 matches per killer
---
Some may click, some may not, no worries, just have fun
---
Most importantly, don’t listen to people who give negatives about your choices... for example, if you like legion, play legion... don’t let people talk you out of it because they don’t like him
---
Man i love Low Profile!! What such a good survivant idea!
---
i dced a few times during the winter event and that was really the only time i ever did because playing survivor was _insufferable_ 9/10 times 
---
prayer beads spirits who tunneled off of the hook doing that hex build with toth, irihead mories, severed fingers, frank’s mixtape, etc,,,,,,,
---
overall just cancer unfun games where i either got tunneled into a oblivion or i just didn’t want to deal with the garbage that comes out from people of this game sometimes because losing 2 pips was better than wasting my time with asshole after asshole
---
this is coming from a killer main who mains an annoying killer (and i don’t personally like using iridescent king because it’s overwhelming and i don’t like going against it either mind you)
---
Also true. Waiting so much for nothing
---
It's not op but it's really strong and probably very annoying to go against
---
You have no idea how grateful I am that you did bring it up with her, to know she played the game once  and loved it is so cool. I hope she played as Amanda 😄
---
I think its a KYF only bug
---
No wonder I never encountered it I don’t have friend to play kyf with.
---
Lago got it exactly right: Sleep them, chase them off, damage the gen, they fail and set gen progress back. Do this 2 times and about a 1/5 of the generator's progress is gone. Don't forget to also sleep them before leaving, as it would require 24 seconds instead of 16 seconds to come back. Use Huntress Lulaby and that turns into a third of their progress gone. Use Outdoor Rope and Jump Rope to slow their progress down to rougly 25% of being awake. Or use Red Paint Brush and Z Block to sleep them super quickly instead.
---
How can Deerstalker help Freddy? Anyone in the dying state already has a visible aura.
---
Or waiting so long to get I a crappy game with tunneler/camper or a very laggy game. Or sometimes even survivor D/Cs
---
Nah, spirit fury doesn't even work until you break two pallets. At that point the Chase has gone on for a while anyway. Nurse shouldnt need it but Billy definitely does because he can be looped. If anything spirit with speed and duration add-ons doesn't really need it.
---
No, that’s totally accurate :) usually people refer to the first person hooked rather than the first person hooked so your wording just threw me off
---
This is awesome OP. If I can throw my two cents it would be to smooth the loop more so you can't tell that easily when it starts/ends.
---
I haven't seen or heard what these people have said, so if you'd like to link me your evidence, it would be appreciated.
---
That said, BHVR have made no official announcements regarding when Chapter 12 will be released. Thus, it'd be unwise to assume a June/July release date.
---
yeah uh, we forgot to tell you to not use that one sir
---
***Pip.***
---
\*happiness noise\*
---
lol nice name and shame, get a life. if you want a serious match try playing hillbilly.
---
Yes it does. As well as pallets
---
Were you in the basement?
---
What’s the Legion bug?
---
Killers like nurse, hillbilly and probably spirit can do well without ruin, but killers like trapper, hag and maybe myers need all the time they can get to setup. I was hoping that plague's corrupt intervention perk could have been a replacement but most feel that it's inferior to ruin from what I have seen.
---
 No
---
Most of us completely agree, id even be down for straight bloodpoints rewards being disabled for 1/3/6 games with a cooldown. The frustrating part is that although most agree, there's little being communicated by the devs. Honestly even if we recieved something a month or two from now I just wish they would give indication that they're working on it.
---
I see nothing wrong with this to be honest, yes the balance on certain things would shift, but the balance in the main game is already dog shit if you ask me, so having a few perks and killers shift in viability is something I'm willing to take for a side gamemode
---
The object pushes you out toward the nearest open space and puts you through the uncloak animation. So if you’re at the end of a wall and it runs out it spits you out at the edge of that wall. If you’re in the middle it pushes you out to the closest area with an open space. This forces the player to think about positioning
---
Why does wraith need a rework? I actually like the way he is. If you bring the right perks and have a couple add-ons you're a beast, just like every other killer.
---
Killer v killer is a gamemode many people have already tought of, but directly punishing killers for something other killers do doesn't seem right to me
---
I had the same issue. I was certain it was my controller's either joystick or L1 button, but i tested it by playing other games with the same controller and there is no issue. It's clearly in Dead by Daylight.
---
Why is this being downvoted?
---
But honestly it's lag dependent apart from knowing your timings
---
There shouldn't be an addon that would make him appear invisible.  He would be an invisible nurse which is the most broken thing in the game hands down.
---
Get pebbled F crow
---
Hmmm interesting. Do you have a relative timer length? Because for a 45 second timer that could be a CRAZY power, but a 15 second timer might keep that mobility more balanced
---
Nah that's how many upvotes I be getting.
---
Every game. Pallets and windows are supposed to protect me. But they fail me everytime.  I'm always getting hit with bullshit hits. This game is beyond killer sided...
---
That actually sounds like a pretty good idea, I wonder what his power would be though... Maybe get on all fours and tackle a Survivor down?
---
They did indeed see it
---
How though? The timer for phasing could have a set time limit like maybe 10 seconds. And you still have to go through the animation of uncloaking
---
The game is just very poorly optimized.
---
I guess last second switch is toxic. But then evading lobbies isn't pleasant either
---
[hEY bROTHER](https://i.imgur.com/RFx0eV0.png)
---
yea, it is a KYF exclusive deal
---
Because it doesnt work
---
I see what you mean. I meant that he comes out of invisibility but still goes through the uncloaking animation
---
So you want to make wraith into the spirit?
---
Feel like this kids dad beat the shit out of him everytime he uttered the words "hex ruin OP" look at him flinch, clearly he realizes that if 100% of killers use ruin than mayhe it's the strongest perk in the game and probably OP but no he can't say that, scared of the backlash of all the angry killermaindouchebags who never hit a hex skillcheck in their life but still wanna pretend it's "balanced guys".
---
Can't blame him either reddit is such a cancerous site if you say one thing wrong you get 50 downvotes, but I"ll say it, hex:ruin OP, spirit fury OP, noed for braindead monkeyfuck and yes I will do the totems and you'll look like a bitch.
---
To be fair, they [were indicating that they want to punish more immediately for disconnects in the future](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/405169/#Comment_405169), just four days ago. (Whether people will be satisfied by that reply is a different matter)
---
Salty survivor mains lol
---
Love this video, /u/ImCows have you guys tried it with 4 freddy's?
---
that's one of the greatest feelings  
---
when someone tells you how shit of a killer you are and someone else is on your side
---
Meh not really. He still has uncloaking transition timers. This is mainly for mind games and walking across the map
---
“These are bones Cindy! Bones!”
---
Bring escape perks and just don't get caught? Break the chase and avoid at all costs. If I can tunnel you, you're not doing a good enough job to escape.
---
Also there would be no royalties to pay, they could design their own. Ability could be a better form of tracking, maybe howling to scare nearby survivors. Lots of options, but it would finally make a character Id be a little scared to face. Lets be honest creepy meyers is the only character and maybe pig that make us jump.
---
&gt; And how is it not comparable? BBQ has 2 effects, extra blood points
---
Considering the BP increase doesn't hurt you guys at all and considering it incentivizes the killer to diversify their hooks, this is a very weird thing to complain about
---
&gt; AND being able to locate all survivors outside of a certain amount of distance if they aren't in a locker. The only way to combat it is by getting within that small window or getting in a locker.
---
Or running Distortion. Or hiding behind gen auras. Or faking out your location. It's so easy to counter BBQ. And you have a lot of prep time for it. It's really weird to me how survivors whine so much about BBQ but not Bitter Murmur which is much more reliable for finding people and not as easy to counter as BBQ *at all*.
---
&gt; Even then killers can combat the locker part by using Iron Maiden.
---
lol no one runs that trash meme perk to counter people getting into lockers because of BBQ. The exposed time is not anywhere close enough to being viable for that.
---
&gt; u will most likely have the killer on u in a matter of seconds.
---
Not if you have half a brain.
---
&gt; Broken? I disagree
---
1) Even one person getting an instant free escape is too much. Killers have extremely little room for error and this forces error for no reason. And if you're like me and don't use Ruin, that one instant DS was a disaster.
---
2) it is not hard to wiggle to 35 percent and you know that.
---
3) juggling is only viable on the obsession and you actually had to be pretty close to a hook for it to work and it's still a waste of time and that person will eventually hit it anyway later in the game when there are less hooks
---
4) enduring is only a very soft counter. if it actually stopped the escape that would be a fine point. but it doesn't. so it wasn't a good point.
---
The fact of the matter is that survivors having the ability to get up to 4 free escapes is broken. That's way too much for the killer role to deal with. I know that survivor mains hate to acknowledge this, but there are 4 of you and only one of us. The game has to be balanced with that in mind and sometimes the devs fail to do so, and DS was an instance of that failure.
---
Do you really think a killer is going to waste a perk slot on Iron Maiden? Cmon now. No way you’re actually serious about bbq being comparable to old DS. Mettle of man is a decent if not better replacement now if that’s what you’re looking for
---
Nice
---
no thats probably a glitch
---
They put you out of the game. In an unfair mannor
---
you didn't actually lose pip  
---
emblems tell you you did, but you didn't
---
You're better off staying just to get your BP. Even if it's not a lot, it's better than 0.
---
Having the ability to phase walk through walls at Bloodlust level 2 is overpowered.
---
I would buy the game again for this feature. Take all my munniez.
---
If it's taking this long to deal with those issues then I call incompetence and this point.
---
Small team, I get it. But we are talking months. The same dumb shit since before I started even playing last December.
---
Howling seems interesting but I wonder how they would implement it. I think that Myers is the creepiest Killer in the game, you're repairing a gen, minding your own business then you look to the side and there he is, staring at you. Got me off guard so many times lol.
---
If you have that many reports, there is definitely a reason for it. Even if you don't think there is any.
---
I play Survivor/Killer 50/50 so obviously less Killer than you but I don't even have 10 % of your reports. And I usually 4K/3K. Additionally, I know for a fact that some of them are from salty Killers I teabagged because they facecamped someone else (I checked my reputation after the game).
---
Wait what? Why would he get bloodlust while he’s invisible? You don’t start chases when you’re cloaked, therefore he would never get bloodlust while being able to phase
---
easy No One Left Behind.  
---
it will lock 2 green items and if you don't want it also a purple one for free, making this lvl 8k BP cheaper
---
Pretty cool but if I may add a suggestion I think hard bail should have some sort of cooldown or maybe only activate after the gen has reached a certain percent which could be reduced with lv 1/2/3
---
i'm a survivor main mostly, play killer a couple of matches a day.
---
anyway, /u/blobfish_bandit is correct, NOED is not overpowered, despite what people tell you in the post game chat. vocal minority and all that.NOED can be frustrating for the survivor ONLY because they are so close to the proverbial finish line.
---
Thank you dood, glad you liked it :D
---
[Link for anyone interested](https://enforcement.xbox.com/en-us/home/reputation).
---
Ive been wanting to do the same thing with Dragon Ball characters. Though, I lost the power cord for my computer, and i think it wouldn't be able to process and render because it's at least 10 or 12 years old. Its also a low end
---
Dope do a Michael or Freddy one
---
Yea, I'm not going through hours and hours of VODs to link you evidence. 
---
Believe what you want, I'll believe what I heard. Its all good.
---
Yes lets rework something that is fine and really doesn't need it?
---
Spirit on a fornite load screen
---
Also ability to walk on all fours, similar to pig kind of a stealthy approach, imagine seeing a fucking werewolf creeping up to you.
---
Why not? Spice things up a bit
---
Thats because you are playing on PS4. The game is trash on console
---
But they are both valid parts of the game per BHVR. Technically it is a killers job to keep survivors from doing anything.
---
I've been wanting balanced landing but don't feel like leveling Nea lol
---
Ah. Also, you should make the background lighter or the hair darker because I can’t tell the difference between them
---
i used to think the same way, but i've had my game crash in the middle of the match, while my wife reports that i have disconnected. 
---
obviously if someone gets downed/hooked and they disconnect, it's fairly obvious, but not all disconnects are legit.
---
It’s about 30-40 seconds I believe can be extended with add-ons
---
I still see killers complaining about DS unnecessary and idiotic. It's not like there's 4 ppl running decisive every game so u saying 4 free escapes is wrong in it's own manner and that's not to mention half of the time ppl don't hit the skill check for decisive. And u gotta realize when u go against survivors with bbq NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME. Not all survivors think about faking out or hiding behind gens. And TBH killers that run bbq AND have map pressure like Billy or nurse doesn't really matter if u do that. We aren't just talking about ranks 10-1 survivors here. A lot of survivors have just recently gotten the game and have no clue how to combat that stuff let alone think about faking out the killer. So saying "not if they have half a brain" is rude and entitled asf. And saying that u don't know why survivors whine about bbq instead of self care would be like me saying "idk why killers complain about Decisive instead of self care or Deliverance". Besides I don't think killers really have a right to complain right now considering the game is catered to them 5x as much as survivors. The survivors have their perks nerfed as to where killers get buffed AND have outrageous hit boxes. So TBH I think survivors have more of a right to complain at this point in time. And before u say "oh ur just a biased survivor main" I'm honestly not, I play both evenly and even have the same amount on each side prestiged. So that argument would be invalid as hell if it was even considered to be brought up.
---
Jake Park's dad is a successful businessman... glad you caught that!
---
that's how it be sometimes
---
I’d say Botany Knowledge instead of Plunder’s if you have it. Even faster heals.
---
To be clear I am not complaining about the disconnects while loading in or the random ones that happen during the match. It's quite obvious when someone is hooked or caught and then DC. That is toxic behavior. It's not fun for the killer AND it sucks for the remaining survivors.
---
Well said, very good points. They only have access to so many testers as well. So bugs are liable to slip through. All games have bugs and some of these issues may be fixed once they do the dedicated servers. But some folks, not pointing any fingers, just saying in general. Some folks expect a triple A experience from what’s basically an independent developer. So you make good points on the difficulty of hiring more people for a project.
---
Z A P
---
...what?
---
I was once playing against three people (fourth didn't load in) they were having lag issues that gave me an advantage, and at the end they accused me of lagswitching. I don't even know how to do that, much less have the balls to use it.
---
I feel like remember me should be higher. If they're in dream state they aren't opening the door.
---
Sorry I meant to put faster after phase.
---
Sorry but dying light is probably the best thing for Freddy mains consider all they do is camp and tunnel every person in the game
---
Lets be real, we both know you come there to watch the Saw movies.
---
everyone has when they first start the game anyway
---
It took me a while. First I made the art for the perks. I found a blank template of a perk and tried to imitate the DBD style. When that was done, I made a template for the perk descriptions and set it over a background of the DBD campfire that I found online. Wasn't super difficult, just had to know how to use Gimp.
---
i figured as much. i just like to throw those two cents in so that other people see that it isn't always like that.
---
for the record i had zero problems with your post, and i agree that DC is a problem. honestly, it's just sad. if you play a game where you're being hunted, you're not going to survive all the time.  that's just the way it is.
---
Been there man, I just go into another game and have the same thing happen again
---
This is thebest thing i have seen. Yall got a youtube channel?
---
I think I’ve had 1 bloodpoints before. I might have taken a screenshot
---
Wiggle has been broken for a while now. Kate was my first main. Boil over was ok before. But it should speed up your wiggle meter. Thats what the perk should do. But it doesn't. 
---
So quick answer, its useless. Id use hope before i ran boil over.
---
They're still M1 killers so Mom still has an effect on them.
---
Disconnections are easy to fix, just give everyone a grace period of disconnections. If they disconnected too many times regardless of reason, then penalize them. Make them play only with other dcers or slap them with a -10% bp earned or something.
---
Yes, not as easy. But if every other game devs can fix bugs (except for friday the 13th), then it might be a sign that they need to review the skills of the people in their bug fixing department.
---
Also, if fixing bugs creates more bugs that also creates more bugs, it might be a sign of either spaghetti code or shitty devs.
---
The best one with Best JOJO
---
Agreed.
---
Like I mentioned before, I've put over 1k hours into the game and have never complained or posted on reddit before. I just think that the trend needs to be dealt with before it drives people away from the game.
---
Is it? Damn. I'm on PC
---
It isn’t. 
---
I got four kills once the plague dropped and I didn’t get it. Had to rely on the second game where I did get the achievement.
---
Ok but again, you can’t expect a disconnect thing like that to just work right away. Again they have to do the coding and when it’s done they need to do testing and such. Plus they are trying to fix a hundred things all at once and again, it’s a small team.
---
Not every game is innocent. I’ve played plenty of games and ran into multiple bugs, some game breaking. Sure most are fixed but a lot of them still reside in the games. I remember playing Fallout 3 DLC like 2 years after it came out and ran into a huge bug where I kept falling through the floor and was nearly game breaking until I found a video online showing the specific route to jump around to get to where I needed to go. So even big developers like Bethesda have issues that still linger.
---
It has nothing to do with shitty devs or spaghetti code. It’s the fact they have multiple things they are trying to fix at once, with a limited crew that they perhaps can on,y make so big. We don’t know how big the office is, we don’t know how much money they make, we don’t know if they like resourcing outside the company. There are many factors to think about here. So if you have a limited crew trying to fix say, 15 bugs, you gotta expect wires to get crossed along the way. You might get 3 bugs fixed and as you work on fixing the 4th something could go wrong with fix 2. Conflicts happen, look at something as simple as running programs on a PC. You’ll instal one program and then another and then you’ll get a notice that program 3 interferes with program 2, same idea. It’s not about bad coding, it’s just something all games have issues with. 
---
Then on top of all that when a patch is created they need to submit them to the platforms for approval. So Sony, Microsoft and I assume Steam need to give approval for said patch to avoid any security issues and what not. It’s a very complicated and stressful situation for developers to go through.
---
When I'm playing survivor I often can take a hit when I feel like there is a danger of trading pallet and use my hit sprint instead to get distance, it often buys me time and also save the pallet for future use
---
The cornfields are the bane of my bloody (Somewhat literally. Yes I’m hilarious) existence, predator actually might be a good option for my go-to tracking perk
---
Alright then, fair enough.
---
Oddly satisfying.
---
Do you know the tiles? It’s all about knowing the tile, knowing how many times you can run a loop before you can throw the pallet down, and reading the killer
---
This would increase suiciding on first hook thus doing nothing.
---
It's possible but depending on your rank pretty stupid. Like you have to go out of your way and let survivors unhook so you can get more hook points. Also playing any one hit down killer automatically makes it impossible to double pip. It's dumb
---
me, i prefer being a sneeky breeky ultra fast croucher with SB and UE.
---
It is individual.   
---
With the standard of dynamic IP addresses, usage for a "block" functionality is a bit unreliable.  It works within the same session decently, but day to day/week to week, people will eventually get a renewed address and you'll have to block again.   It is a much more accurate ping indicator though, so you can watch for irregular spikes.
---
No Plague perks?
---
I'd put dark devotion up there in the A-B rank
---
Ye, I noticed that and the start and end but I'll keep that in mind for the next animation I do.
---
Nah, really doesn't fit the theme for me. The whole chapter is a huge let down.
---
It pisses me off when Freddy’s do this shit because you can’t really do anything except for hope he’s trash at getting survivors in loops
---
Boring perks
---
My theory is this: all the casual players have stopped playing DBD on PS4 because of its many issues at the moment. All that’s left is the people who are invested, the people who can loop like champions, have all the meta perks, and are extremely jaded and bitter about everything. This is why both killers and survivors are sweating their asses off, because if they don’t then gens get done in two minutes or they get camped to death on their first hook.
---
Useless
---
I couldn't find a list that contained Plague perks.
---
All of her perks work well. I'd say they're all C - A tier.
---
So......how killers are suppose to suspect the DS?
---
Why are the moris so tame? Aftet watching my daughter play Mortal Kombat 10, Dead by Daylight looks almost like a kiddie game.
---
Totem : Spawns next to me
---
Me : I'm sorry little one
---
Honestly if I had a render of Jake's blond head it would've fit Ceaser pretty well.
---
Hook distribution has changed so it is more consistent.   If someone isn't actively body blocking at the correct moment or sabo frenzy, you are going on the hook.
---
LAG SWITCHER! “Points at you”
---
&gt; I still see killers complaining about DS unnecessary and idiotic.
---
I dunno. I can't remember the last time I saw anyone complain about DS. And if you did see people complaining about new DS it is definitely not as much as I see people complain about BBQ
---
&gt; It's not like there's 4 ppl running decisive every game so u saying 4 free escapes is wrong in it's own manner
---
Ohh oh oh buddy yes there was. Once you got past rank like 12 or 11? Yeah it was everywhere.
---
&gt; And u gotta realize when u go against survivors with bbq NOT EVERYONE IS THE SAME. Not all survivors think about faking out or hiding behind gens.
---
People not yet realizing what counters are available is not an argument that BBQ is too strong or that it's comparable to old DS. 
---
&gt; And TBH killers that run bbq AND have map pressure like Billy or nurse doesn't really matter if u do that.
---
Sure, BBQ has a lot more utility on these two killers than others. Luckily Billy is very loopable and because Nurse has such low base speed, if you wait about two seconds, take a couple steps in one direction, reverse course and find somewhere to blend you'll be fine. Unless she has Whispers. (also I think nurse is fun to juke)
---
&gt; A lot of survivors have just recently gotten the game and have no clue how to combat that stuff let alone think about faking out the killer. So saying "not if they have half a brain" is rude and entitled asf.
---
That's fair. The game has an unnecessarily rough learning curve. I've been playing for a long time so I've forgotten how little you know at first. In one of my first games I didn't even realize Nurse was a killer and thought it was an AI on the map lol
---
&gt; And saying that u don't know why survivors whine about bbq instead of self care would be like me saying "idk why killers complain about Decisive instead of self care or Deliverance".
---
I can't even figure out what you're saying here. This sentence does not make sense. You're, like, mixing up perks and shit.
---
&gt; Besides I don't think killers really have a right to complain right now considering the game is catered to them 5x as much as survivors. The survivors have their perks nerfed as to where killers get buffed AND have outrageous hit boxes.
---
This is extremely dramatic and very misleading. 
---
1) Survivors need to have perks that are weaker on an individual level than killer perks because there is 4 of you. If individual survivor perks were as strong as individual killer perks it would be impossible for a killer to ever win a game. And frankly, you're proving my point when I talked about 4 versus 1 game balance. I know that you as the survivor player don't give a fuck, but the people making the game do and know that it's necessary.
---
2) Individual killers had to be buffed because they were straight up not viable against the reality that you play against SWF almost every game. And I also think you're referring to perks like NOED and Ruin receiving "buffs" but making lower tiers less not good isn't a buff to the perk. It makes them more commonly used, but that isn't a buff unless the perk itself actually gets stronger which is not the case.
---
3) Hit boxes are fine. It really truly is a latency issue and I have no idea why you guys refuse to acknowledge that and also that the adjustment to fast vaults made window hits more rare. Remember when they actually made the hit boxes for hatchets smaller? It made them essentially impossible to land. Even straight up experts like ScottJund couldn't do it, and that's because it's a latency problem that the basketball shaped hit boxes currently address. I was watching EdgarAlanbro stream the other night and he played against a Huntress in Haddonfield and there were some hatchets she missed and all I could think was "this totally disprove reddit's beliefs on hatchet hit boxes" because if what you guys thought was true they would have damaged him.
---
4) Survivors have a number of good perks not in the current meta. You guys just don't wanna try.
---
&gt; So TBH I think survivors have more of a right to complain at this point in time.
---
I think everyone has a right to complain because the game can be frustrating, but currently it is the most balanced it has ever been.
---
I heard the next Killer is going to be the Great Mighty Poo. You'll just have to believe me...
---
If one or more people don't load in to my games or they dc at the start, I usually take the Entity Displeased to let them escape after farming a bit. I main survivor and on the rare occasion I play a nurse or piggy game I feel too terrible to try vs 2 or 3 people. I wish more killers would do this :(
---
Yeah agreed, people just view businesses as ...well erm, 'entities'. I'm not sure how small BHVR is, but if it is a small team then they will have even smaller teams working on distinct aspects.
---
Anybody who has worked with code, or computer programmes that require attention to detail understands how easy it can be to make a human error - or spot something after you click submit. And people forget that it *is* humans coding every aspect of the things they love. And if you are expanding on a game without 'redoing'  everything from scratch every time then there becomes exponentially more things to think about.
---
I.e. I think it was very telling when they had some perks displaying something like 'script.dec'. That is just a classic code error where something interfered with something else. It highlights well how businesses are open to human error (and that is just basic programming, let alone looking after and providing support for online survers and things).
---
And every time they add a new perk - that has to interact with every perk and detail they have added up to now. 
---
But yes, viewing businesses as businesses leads to this very common thought that they could just hire more.  (they might be anyway). Sometimes it is justified... i.e. epic games could buy in whatever department they want after their 'boom' with fortnite.
---
But for a steady-going game, offering gradual new content and non-overwhelming' player base. Not always the easiest to justify bringing in 'a new team to work on X'.
---
And some Survivors REEEEEEE after getting downed... once.
---
I definetly think Mettle of Man is more balanced than old DS, but with that being said it seems largely bugged now. I'm pretty sure if you go into dying state it's supposed to lose all its "tokens", so you're supposed to have to tank hits for your allies / escape chases in order to get it off. Now it seems to just always happen which is definetly a bug.
---
I swear auras were fine on that map until recently...
---
I feel for ya
---
Boop the snoot, we will be your friend forever
---
That would be the glass shards on her body. I'm going to pick a different colour background for the next one I create.
---
Was wondering when he would achieve his levitation merit badge!
---
Same thing I did haha
---
Oh god, yeah. They're so boring. Sixth generation style animations and they're all real watered down.
---
I'm going to be doing that for the next animation I create.
---
It does punish enough. As people dont realize it allows gens to be completed. You can get up to 3 gens done while being camped. Plus they lose devout pip points
---
legion can fuck off
---
&gt;So it is always better to leave immediately after a hook, and if you're running BBQ, go sleep another survivor.
---
Only necessary in about 10% of games. Majority of the time another person will just instantly unhook because sleep timer and no hook grab possible.  Usually gets them killed, but they got those farm stacks.
---
Lmao very true
---
No
---
thats the best feeling ever, just stalking people without them noticing. man, myers is the best killer.
---
Feels bad man when I bring Ace in The Hole + Plunderers and give everyone gifts of flashlights and medkits but they all die to the Spirit who never even hit me once.
---
ok
---
Ruin, Distressing, Coulrophobia, Sloppy Butcher, and to make this build even better, use addons to increase terror radius and maybe even a game offering
---
Wow either those guys time it at the same moment or the game booted them for that perfect 3 man DC, was playing huntress last night and was right in the middle of a good game and boom BLUE SCREEN error message on PS4. It happened 4 times yesterday, 1 time on my work PS4 and then 3 times on my Home PS4 this game has been acting terrible lately and still getting the infinite load screen.
---
yikes selfless promotions
---
Do killers *really* feel like this game isn't tipped in their favour? Not trying to start any mains wars or anything but as a survivor main I've always felt the game is usually in their odds far more, but I always see for certain survivor perks to be nerfed etc which I feel sort of puts us back to square one.
---
I'd just like to hear a killer main's side on this.
---
My only issue is when I play with friends we have people randomly disconnect where they lose connection to the host. It looks like they intentionally did it and I don't want to get screwed because we DCd bc the killer has bad internet.
---
his game is stretched for him too, and it’s not squared, it’s something like 1600 x 1080.
---
you have to change it in the game files, and also gotta change the stretch setting in your graphics card program.
---
I'm pretty sure Meg and Claudette changed, in the trailer their skin color is reversed.
---
But there is no on screen notifications or incentive to move away. It just ruins the game for one person and often makes 2/3 members of the team disconnect. 
---
I see what you mean by the fact that others can do gens but even then it is hard for survivors to rank up on a killer that doesn’t chase that much or being able to save/heal others. 
---
I know that survivors can be just as toxic but it just doesn’t seem fair.
---
They all would DC once they seen you and the infinite mend time!
---
if i was danny phantom i would be jumping into girls bodies and touching my own breast. I would be a villain :(
---
&gt; can just spray and pray, stopping the survivor from dodging and eliminating the skill needed for the killer 
---
The attack has a pretty short range, low movement speed, and is easy to escape by looping. It has low accessibility and its availability is almost entirely up to the survivors. You can bait a pallet stun and remove the rest of the duration of the attack. And if you hear her power up just play more immersed for about a minute.
---
It's not necessarily skill based but it's well balanced and not as strong as your acting
---
Yea most of the time, campers are really only hurting themselves. It sucks to be the guy on the hook, but if your team is halfway decent, you'll likely be the only kill.. You're making a worthy sacrifice, friend! We salute you!
---
-The guy doing gens while you're being camped.
---
P. S. I'll try and save people even when they are being camped. I run borrowed time and WGLF pretty much everywhere, maybe even some We'll make it, most of the time.
---
You can do 3 gens when someone facecamps, so if u run the killer for 2 hens and they facecamp, u legit win the game. It sux for the survivor being face camped but survivors overall win. The face camper gets very little bp and probably doesn’t pip. And you could always run ds and borrowed time to counter it
---
Your passive aggressiveness because he misunderstood you is called being a dick. And hello. this is a public forum. If it were in private messages it wouldn't be my business, nor anybody else's that ends up seeing your back and forth convo. So thank you, but no thank you.
---
Looking forward to it!
---
Nope, I really did lose the pip.
---
Its faster to kick a pallet than use the chainsaw to break the pallet.
---
I usually use the chainsaw to keep a survivor at the pallet on short loops or to make them abandon the loop early so I don't need to break it. 
---
The chainsaw trick works much more efficiently on Hillbilly as he moves faster with it but with Bubba, it zones survivors to one side of the pallet instead of running around you. 
---
You can also use bubbas charge to break a pallet after dowing someone with it due to the charge continuing after hitting someone. Can be useful for efficiency if you down someone right next to a loop.
---
That would explain it
---
It's mine, both uploads. I just hadnt finished the full video yet. I wanted to tease people with this one, thats all :)
---
Meg’s permanent bitch face really goes with her character IMO
---
On the subject of tunneling I know I'll be downvoted for saying it but logically it is the most efficient method. Taking a Survivor out of the match lowers the number of hands on deck which slows the game down and makes it easier for you to win. The entire concept of Moris hinges on this fact and tunneling is honestly rather similar.
---
The problem is just that it's not fun to be focused out, and I think it's on the devs to fix what is an inherent problem with the design of their game. I don't know how you can make tunneling less of an issue since it's not a cut-and-dry "do (x) to fix (y)" problem. Perks like Make Your Choice, Barbeque and Chili, Borrowed Time, and now new Decisive Strike are all great places to start but the core mechanics really need to be fixed. We can't just keep making perks to compensate for bad gameplay mechanics.
---
As for Moonwalking (I assume with Legion): I mean that's an exploit. Exploits obviously need to be fixed.
---
Couldn’t he have just left?
---
lol funniest thing ive ever seen (laughing e)
---
It’s because it’s taken several years for the victim to die
---
Heh. Yeah, I don't cheat, mostly because I don't want my account to get banned.
---
i'm going to guess they had to be quick, otherwise no one would use them
---
Would it though? It would give the killer the deserved bloodpoints and urge other survivors to help get their teammates off hooks.
---
*I'm never gonna catch my breath*  
---
*Think the killer has a mori*  
---
*Why was I an uncool fool that ignored gens?*
---
Terrible connection or Legion. If I knew I was going against a face camper before the match I would DC there as well.
---
Alot of ppl say they have trouble with que times but almost always I WILL find a game INSTANTLY,    but on PC the game is optimized way better than console
---
Thats why I ALWAYS run borrowed time
---
Killers are flawless and the bastion of sportsmanship obviously.
---
While you may be right, at least on lower levels, at rank 1, playing killer is a chore.
---
If you, as a survivor run a meta perk build, the killer is more at a disadvantage than you are. 
---
This might also be inherent in the game itself. As a killer, all you can really do, for the most part, is capitalize in a survivor series mistake. There is very little you can do, unless the survivors make a mistake. As survivors start ranking up, they become more aware of these mistakes, and therefore don't commit them as often. Add to this the fact that survivors have many "crutch" perks, that allow them to recover from said mistakes, might indicate an unbalance, in favour of survivors in general.
---
If you have solidarity and autodidact will the first 2 regressing skill-checks regress the progression on your health if you’re injured as well?
---
Good ol ditzy Linda.
---
How would it not? Players who would DC would just get hit, hooked, and then suicides. It’s a faster way to get out of games and get that timer down.  
---
Who wants to play super well to get zero bloodpoints when you could suicide and move on. 
---
Other survivors probably wouldn’t get there fast enough
---
no idea. maybe you're right, cause i played without BBQ on it several times and i don't use other aura reading perks. but the damn scratch marks were always as all survivors run Lightweight that's for sure
---
No, but don't act like the DC issue isn't a particularly survivor sided one. Let's be real, please.
---
seven seven seven seven seven seven seven seven sevon sevon sevon sevon sevon sevon sevon sevon
---
If the guy can't understand a simple sentence he doesn't have the mental capacity to argue with anyone or play an 18 game. You didn't have to butt in, but you did, why? I don't know, maybe you have nothing better to do with your life.

---
Hope is actually a rly good perk for looping
---
So, if there’s two different types of totems. There are dull totems that aren’t lit up at all, and look normal. The ones that have the trapped hex in it have an orangish glow. Those are the ones you have to cleanse. 
---
Sometimes you can’t always get rid of the status effect. For example, if you’re going against a Michael Myers and he gets Tier 3 evil within, everyone is exposed until it goes back to Tier 2. You can’t get rid of that. Killer perks like “Sloppy Butcher” makes anyone the killer hits have the Mangled status effect, and it goes away after you heal. 
---
It all kinda depends on if it’s a hex being used, if it’s an add on from a killer or if it’s part of a perk. Hope this helps!
---
Tell me senpai how did you do that?
---
&gt;Plague’s fountain mechanic.
---
This doesn't seem broken at all, you just won't get it for free all that early, survivors will have to run further after some time if they want to cleanse themselves, I see it as a small balance shift. And look on my explanation on jigsaw boxes how I would "fix" this
---
&gt;Jigsaw boxes being across the map
---
I already made a post a few mounths ago going into detail of the game mechanics and how more complicated killers would work, I could place a link if you want. One of the things I said was that the map has 4 invisible sections (with invisible I mean that there is no clear divide between the sections). Each killer has their own section with 5 totems and in the case of pig, their jigsaw boxes.
---
So, the most this would break is that the pig might be able to place a trap on someone at the other side of the map
---
&gt;broken perks such as fire up which would give up to an 80% bonus.
---
Fire Up would indeed need some adjustment, but just like everything else would get scaled, it would be possible to scale fire up by deviding it's effect by 4
---
&gt;Broken add ons such as Michael with Judith tombstone who could just get evil within 3 within minutes.
---
Michael will have a hard time and they don't even need to scale everything. In a match, there is a total amount of stalk present, it gets devided over all survivors equally. Right now, if you load in with only 2 survivors, you get double the stalk points on you than you would normaly have.
---
I think the normal evil points present is 40, with 16 survivors, this means he only has 2.5 evil points per survivor. This will force him to switch survivors very often if he wants to get enough points to activate an infinite tombstone
---
Shhhh
---
It doesn't even have to be them being bullied by the entire team. I'm not even that good a survivor, but sometimes I'll outplay a killer a couple times in a row, like they'll miss several hits when I'm looping them and then I manage to lose them entirely with Iron Will, and they'll just DC even if they haven't really lost that much time.
---
That's not a difficult decision. It's always mori.
---
A hex totem is a bone totem that has its candles lit. When you break it, it should make a thunder like sound effect &amp; you will get 1000 bp for destroying the hex.
---
The other totems in the match are called dull totems. They look the same as Hex totems but do not have their candles lit. These totems have nothing attached to them &amp; breaking them will not cause a thunderous sound effect. You get 600 BP for breaking them. 
---
There is a really strong perk that activates on one of these dull totems when the exit gates are powered called Hex: No one escapes death/
---
This is a really strong hex perk so its adviced that you break all the totems you see to stop the perk from activating. At the very least watch out for dull totems suddenly having their candles lit to become a hex totem.
---
It's likely that you broke a couple of dull totems thus the cursed effect did not disappear. You need to find the specific lit totems &amp; destroy them to get rid of the hex. You can hear them as they release a soft crackling fire sound effect when near them. 
---
You can get status effects from other factors in the game. For example, a perk called Sloppy Butcher puts the hemorrhage &amp; Mangled status effect on you until you are healed. The only way to remove these status effects is to heal fully.
---
&gt;Why did everyone lose connection at the exact same second despite nothing happening to cause them to disconnect. Hm; must just be toxicity. Dead by Daylight is a flawless masterpiece and there's absolutely zero chance that the game bugged out. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
He's sort of reminiscent of Bill in some ways but I think Bill is a lot more of a gruff hard-ass.
---
I really like this concept though and I would FOR SURE use Bounce Back to become the real William "Bill" Overbeck.
---
That was the Pig's internet router.
---
Lol, nice noed
---
I remember hearing 35% from some dev stream or other
---
It's synchronize with the music i am listening
---
There are total 5 fountains.
---
Bill &lt;3
---
nah
---
It depends on the effect and what is causing it. Some are on a timer and will eventually go away on their own, others require you to heal to get rid of the effect, and some need you to do something specific like cleansing a totem to remove.
---
To use blindness as an example, the killer may have been using Hex: Third Seal. This hex gives you blindness when the killer hits you (so you can't see auras) and then only way to get rid of it is to cleanse the hex totem for that specific perk. There is a specific hex totem linked to the perk, you can't just cleanse *any* hex totem to get rid of it.
---
(Details here about Third Seal, if you're curious:  [https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:\_The\_Third\_Seal](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Hex:_The_Third_Seal) )
---
As a truly incompetent killer I say...no? By this I mean it's likely biased to give the killer a chance against four independent survivors. But any synergistic action from the survivors can tip the balance very easily.
---
It’s not op, it’s legit one extra hit, and it has a pretty balanced penalty for that
---
At least I’m not the only one having issues. Devs need to come up with a better game-plan! I totally get not wanting to farm and waste time. You just wanna move on to the next game and get it over with. But as a survivor, I do greatly appreciate killers who acknowledge DC’s and go easy on the survs after them.
---
Congrats on being a rank 1 killer though. You have like double my hours and I’ve had this game since August 2016 😂 That’s awesome yo.
---
They need to fix all the matchmaking and bugs. It’s ruining the game.
---
Ok so the first part about complaining about DS means that I think it's unnecessary not that I see them CURRENTLY complaining. Wording issue.
---
As for 4 ppl running it, I have been past ranks 11 and 12. I've been down to rank 1 and I'm on PS4 (idk what u play on) but I rarely ever seen 4 ppl play decisive, maybe once a day which honestly wasn't bad if u down them close to a hook, which the way the hooked are set, it's not far especially if u use the offering.
---
About nurse and Billy, yeah sure Billy is loopable unless he gets annoyed and slugs lol. As for nurse they are easy to juke but u gotta admit ppl are starting to learn her more and more and it's not as easy as it used to be. And yeah she is fun to juke, especially running her around tires lol.
---
And yeah I mixed up my sentence there I meant to say "don't know why killers whine about bbq rather than" I forgot the other perk u said but that's what I meant to say, I was thinking of what to say next and typed half of each sentence lol. Had a brain fart.
---
And it might be dramatic but it's Tru, but I mean u might be right about the hitboxes but it's still very annoying getting hit through pallettes, windows, etc. 
---
I get that perks need to be bigger and better for killers to be balanced but at the same time why buff perks that don't need buffed. Like ruin, ruin was already bad enough with the regression. But once they made it to where every tier does the same thing but added 1% to the regression was kinda pointless. Just made it more annoying. 
---
As for survivors not trying all the perks, I use all perks. The only perks I don't use are the ones I don't own or the ones that only increase blood points, ..... Also I don't use no mither cause it's honestly pointless and trashy lol.
---
Yeah everyone has the right to complain but once u say it's balanced and yet there's still tunnelers and campers/lag switchers into the fray then it's waaaay under balanced. I get securing a kill after gates are open but DURING the game all the killer perks, PLUS camping/tunneling makes it unbalanced and unfair. 
---
But anyway I'm not trying to argue or be "entitled" if that's how I sound (which ik the part of me being dramatic does). Like I said earlier I don't main anything. I'm just trying to express my opinions and why I think that way. So if I said anything misleading or rude I am sorry.
---
Totally understand
---
Game over.
---
looping as a survivor is more intuitive at that stage. literally all you have to do is keep the killer at the other side and they never get you. you really don't need to know how to do those things competently
---
Take your participation trophy and LIKE IT!
---
I believe the only reason people get salty about something is because of the hilarious bp gain for survivors.
---
You can play an entire game up until the end and only get like 15 while the killer easily, after a long game, gets  30k.
---
The caps are the issue I think. Also the fact that certain actions like coop *shares* category with skill checks is the most insane thing to me.
---
The reason is because survivors get points based off interaction with the killer overall. 
---
A killer interacts with every survivor so he constantly gets points. But since there is only one killer its not possible for every survivor to interact at all times with killers. So naturally it's harder.
---
As to why BHVR doesn't balance it so survivors get equal points it's so that there is more incentive to play killer. Since for every killer who doesn't play that's 4 survivors who can't play either.
---
Yeah Lmao
---
Sony would probably not allow it. Xbox probably would but maybe it's too difficult for BHVR to implement? Maybe when dedicated servers come out.
---
I'd sure like that.
---
I suppose he is. I am a Bill main, so favoritism is not out of the question...
---
"precious"
---
dude she walks over to it and touches it once for half a second.
---
You didn’t actually de pip, restart your game
---
Killer is host, so its your internet  that is causing the hiccups
---
not even a day old reddit account. hmmmmm. also rank 19 so you playing with hopefully other low rank people and showing that you can do well
---
&gt; and is easy to evade by looping
---
I can agree with the other stuff but how exactly does looping do anything against a ranged hit? windows and pallets are out of the question and I doubt you can run around some small loop for ages.
---
Yeah, i know. I don't care about ranks, but i prefer playing survivor and mostly with friends. Are none of them online I'll play killer for bp, so i can prestige my precious Nea &lt;3
---
I hate this shit and it happens every damn game. I’ll be on the other side. Both feet planted. Already about to run and I’m downed. The lunge + lag is big yikes
---
As a Killer main, it can get pretty frustrating pretty quickly especially if you miss hits that are free. There is a lot of pressure as Killer because you rely entirely on yourself, meaning repeated mistakes can really get into your head. Killers shouldn’t dc intentionally but I can understand why they do.
---
*Best case scenario they'll use one and you can save yours* :hyperdoc:
---
And the mixtape playing in the background.
---
Can someone make this for Myers?
---
&gt; So if I said anything misleading or rude I am sorry.
---
No worries. 
---
I don't have much time for a long discussion, so I'll just touch on one thing
---
&gt; but once u say it's balanced and yet there's still tunnelers and campers/lag switchers into the fray
---
These things are not balance issues. They are individual player behavior issues.
---
You didnt find the bug... The first mentions about this go wayyyy back with Paulie Esthter back in 2017, he did the glitch in kyf with his friends on purpose and continues to do so to this day. He did 5 survs or multiple killers..... Dont take credit for copypasta, pleb.

I assume you mean well known streamers. Not just every Jim and Bob with a .tv name. They don’t count, they’re not real streamers.
---
It's okay with all other games though.  I have decent speeds, anything I can do to make the issue better?
---
[***CRAAAAAAAAAWLING IN MY SKIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIN!***](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gd9OhYroLN0)
---
Oh okay. I forgot which one was proximity to hook.
---
Easy or not, it shouldn’t really be happening
---
I meant by playing around high and long walls, sorry.
---
I will once I've more experience with him.
---
This is amazing, you have talent!
---
When something else needs my attention for whatever reason, mostly. I've DC'd eight or nine times (over 1000 hours). One for an emergency where I needed to take someone to the hospital, for reference. I'd say roughly half the times I DC'd were situations where my attention was needed somewhere else besides the game.
---
Two or three of the handful of times have been games where I loaded in by myself, or everyone else had already DC'd and I just said "fuck that."
---
I have DC'd a total of one time because the killer slugged me down looking for the other survivor. This was the first time I'd been downed all game, so I had a full bleed out timer, and the other survivor was on hatch (or so I assumed, as they were teabagging repeatedly in an attempt to communicate with me) so I DC'd so they could have hatch. Normally I wouldn't have given up the BP I earned for that match just to let this guy get the hatch, but for some reason it just seemed like the right thing to do at the moment.
---
I mean, you sure do seem to care about numbers because you seem to be farming for the most downvotes ever from this subreddit.
---
Well is it okay with Candy Crush?  Seriously, make sure you are hard wired in you can check their connection speed when they enter the camp, if it doesnt stable out then you may need to back out.  
---
But if you are feeling really irritated...  take a break and play something else
---
Best survivor concept I’ve seen!
---
yeah they readded double pallets at those tiles, super rare though.
---
I usually just look straight up. Seems to work for me.
---
until they have a casual mode there isn't a way to punish players for DC's. And do you really want a guy in a game where no blood points are earned? The game can hardly handle adjusting its pipping system. You think it will be able to properly put players who needed a soft BP ban into only ques' with similar kind&gt;? Hardly. They will get into normal games they will be the biggest potatoes. Since rank doesn't matter they will most likely just stand there or farm you , or point you out to the killer.   
---
I feel if a quick play mode was available they could bring harsher bans or more penalties to poor sportsmanship players with its comp mode. This is pretty much the norm for most FPS, Moba, etc. or more established games.
---
Sadly true
---
When people are let down like that I’ll tend to give hatch after farming for a bit, really frustrating to genuinely have potatoes for a team
---
I agree
---
 I know if you are complaining about lag as a killer its on your end.  Maybe you should turn off your PS4 instead of Rest mode and make sure you are not downloading updates in the back ground...  
---
and Maybe just Maybe instead of complaining about lag... they are just 360ing you..  Own up to your own mistakes, or console frames or whatever else excuse you want to make up...
---
Not helpful?! just Git Gud
---
No, but im sorry for you man. Have you reported them? I had the same done to me by tombstone piece myers (quick info: you know how play with your food loses a token on hits? It doesn't when you get moried. That means sonic Myers.) and after I reported, in the next week I got a message saying they were banned( as far as I remember)
---
7 bucks is enough for a beer and a measley tip. Go out OP!
---
Just kidding
---
New player here, can you explain pip and depipp to me?
---
I'm not sure honestly, but whenever I play against him I seem to get slaughtered. It might just be my total lack of skill in this game but his sleep radius is pretty big, so once you're asleep you have to loop like crazy or he'll get to you quick.
---
I do find it weird how he's essentially a killer built around tunneling.
---
Yeah decently known or if they a thot. Excuse my language.
---
If you made this, it deserves more upvotes.
---
They all look AMAZING but holy shit that Huntress is spot on
---
Dang, was about to say "man you wasted Balanced", but that tiny boost prob helped ya open the door just in time.
---
I’ve never been loud playing ash
---
Will still tunnel one person.
---
Weird flex but ok
---
On one hand a killer who has broken addons that never get addressed and ruin the structure of the game isn’t fun for anyone.
---
On the other hand a killer who can 4K even if a monkey plays him has an impressive track record.
---
Camping happens alot to me, especially when it's MM, Leatherface or Huntress. Especially when it comes to hill hooks or basement hooks. The only way I can ever get a killer to stop camping is with diversion. As for tunneling like u said some ppl just don't care about a survivor trying to take aggro. It just ruins games and isn't fair to the survivor who gets tunnelled. They wait such a long time for queues, sometimes getting dodged only to get in a game they can't do anything in. And alot of killers along with the devs don't see anything wrong with it. Nor do they care about having good moral and feeling sorry for the survivors. Anyway, I gotta get ready for work so I'll leave off with this. Sorry if I'm annoying lol
---
It’s jank as fuck. You can’t even get pissed at people for DCs. It’s legit completely random. 
---
Killer hits a survivor: survivor on the other side of the map gets kicked. 
---
Unhook a survivor, get stuck in an infinite animation because the game kicks them. 
---
The game keeps getting more broken with every patch.
---
There is pressure on survivors too, especially for those play solo. I can think of some frustrating things like getting hit when the killer isn't even facing you or when you're on the other side of the pallet that's been thrown down or hell, getting unfairly matched against a killer of high ranking when they're still getting the hang of the game.
---
Which is a shame really, you'd think they'd crack down on it to some degree, either way, you're right about running kindred, guess that's our only hope lmao
---
There are ton of surv dc's too.
---
First of this is not KyF. And I did not find any type of record of this bug and how you preform it. So if this is such a well known bug, please tell me how to do it. Because it would be intresting to hear ur way of doing it.
---
no it isnt theres a lot of very strong pallets in it the only time its killer sided is with a doctor with distressing and the addons that increase terror raduis
---
I did on the end game scoreboard, but didn’t do it on BHVRs website.
---
&gt; along with the devs don't see anything wrong with it.
---
That's really not true. You should watch their streams sometime!
---
When he’s injured he grunts so loudly.
---
This is by far the funniest bug in this game
---
I swear to god if the credits better refer to her as Anna
---
[You serious?](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFJ6UZ0SkYY&amp;t=0m29s)
---
It depends on how good survivor is with timings, sometimes you won't have time to look up
---
Did you u/kasskar make a post about the same game lol?
---
Spirit
---
Wow. Funny meme
---
The devs have twitch streams? 
---
And I won't lol, I'm a librarian xD just gotta put away books
---
That’s a fair point.
---
Haha I agree to 100%
---
Haha, we will see :) Thank you!
---
They all do that
---
They could do it like a modified version of the werewolf infected from Deceit, were it obscures the vision of the survivors
---
This would be a really fucking cool screensaver without the recover notification
---
I love the idea of this survivor as a killer main this would be one of the only survivor I play
---
Google: did you mean "Charles Manson"
---
Yeah but not that loud I can easily hear him.
---
I love the backstory and the other two perks, but Low Profile would probably make killers camp a lot more.
---
"What about Me? Oh, don't worry. No one's gonna miss ol' Charlie."
---
P... PROTECC HIM! 
---
No, but this is pretty good! That first perk is right up my alley, and his backstory is nice.
---
Dead Hard to a pallet or try and 360 to a vault or fake a window to bait an attack
---
Not his fault the killer is afraid he won't catch anybody else and NEEDS to get at least one kill.
---
So fun.
---
I’m more of a 60/40 killer to survivor spread and in my eyes, the game is getting more balanced to favor killer because of what the state of the game was like before. 
---
When it comes to perk strength, the survivors do have a lot of perks that cover their misplays and mistakes that the killers don’t have either as much of or in any comparable power. Look at perks like Dead Hard, Mettle Of Man, old and new DS, Borrowed Time or Adrenaline. It’s not to suggest these perks should be nerfed, but in combination you can make quite a few mistakes in chases and still get out okay. 
---
On the other side, Killer perks that give leverage or cover mistakes are limited to an active Spirit Fury, STBFL, Unrelenting, And Bamboozle. Everything else for killer relies on anticipating the survivors mistake and reacting to it. Outside of those perks, only a few killers can actually create an opening to put the chases flow in their power beside Bloodlust. 
---
This is why killer perks need to be stronger/on the oppressive side because without that leverage, people will either have to accept losses or play killers who are also oppressively strong to make up for the fact it takes too much time to as any other killer to produce results.
---
Haha no worries, I like to say gg and then watch their rage.  Makes me chuckle 
---
And thanks for the tip ;)
---
I strongly dislike toolboxes as killer too, even when I run Ruin
---
Reasons to camp:
---
A: Surv was being toxic: Don't do this... you want to... they might actually deserve it... but you shouldn't... it just spreading more toxicity in this community... god knows we have enough.
---
B: 1 gen/gates powered: Only way a killer can maintain control of the game. Yeah it doesn't feel great, but hey, all your friend got out(unless they tried to save you &amp; failed).
---
C: Killer saw other survs nearby: The killer knows where multiple survs are &amp; knows if they leave the surv will be saved immediately so they're going to remain close to the hooked surv &amp; look for the others, but not going to stray too far away. 
---
D: Insidious/0 Terror Radius: More for memes than anything else... MOST survs are pretty fine with it &amp; don't even "attempt escape" to tell survs your nearby. I'm honestly perfectly fine with insidious camping as it's what the bad perk was designed for(also it's fun for me on both sides). And the second people know the killer has insidious, they are gonna stay away, or put everything in an attempt to save the surv &amp; remove all pressure the killer has.
---
E: Leatherface: \*sigh\* Leatherfaces power sucks... the only way any killer can use it effectively is to face camp... otherwise he is just a M1 killer since his chainsaw is so easy to avoid. Don't get me wrong, playing leatherface isn't an excuse, this is probably the worst, but just know that keeping one survivor on a hook is all his power can do.
---
No, chase somebody else. If you find them again later it's on.
---
But tunneling off the hook lame to the extreme.
---
Those words two cant go together.... buff?? Whats that
---
i picked up freddy recently.  and yes he's not easy to use, but he's def fun.  
---
besides, i dont foresee ANYONE getting hate mail for using freddy.  
---
i would recommend the plague too.  she's a lot of fun
---
I wish there was an alternative as well.
---
Jason? Also all shirtless characters are welcome Myers, Freddy, Trapper, Clown, Pig doesn't matter no shirts for all
---
I'm always relieved when the first person I find is a possesser of the Box of Genrush
---
Ash is the loudest by far.
---
I know I'm a buzz kill, but i will kindly say fuck posts like this for momentarily making me think a big new change is happening to DBD.
---
It's mori... no ifs, ands, or buts. It's always mori
---
How did you get 7?
---
Reminded me of don't starve and I am very ok with this cross over
---
I suddenly remembered that screenshot of lobby with 4 survivors each having toolbox called:
---
Genrush1
---
Genrush2
---
Genrush3
---
Genrush4
---
Just coming back what do people mean when they refer to the games meta?
---
I can not care about them but still use them to prove a point. I really don't think that's too hard to understand.
---
Thanks haha😂
---
I'm sorry I ruin things
---
I don't think camping is nearly as prevalent as people act here. Tunneling is tho and there's essentially no such thing as a safe unhook because the killer will just ignore shit like Borrowed Time or a blocker trying to take aggro
---
Ahh I see
---
&gt; but you just know that there’s survivors near by right before the phase changes so if I haven’t found someone I bet on finding someone then
---
That's my entire point. Lower skill killers use it as a crutch.
---
I've played killers that never go back to the hook....and still DESTROYED us. They don't play cheap and still get a 4k. It is possible. Those are the funnest games, even if I die. Even if we get massacred, it's fun because there's a lot of chases and rescues.
---
Instead of relying on crutches and cheap tactics, killers should learn a better strategy and pressure. Bad killers make the game boring. The best killers make it soooo fun!
---
E-fucking-xactly
---
wraith would be more fun if they cut his speed to 0 while uncloaking but increased his movement speed while cloaked  to like max windstorm level imo
---
Did the killer drop the surv with a high wiggle bar or 4 times in a row? if so that's an instant escape plus a stun
---
nah you can blame the meg for unhooking and farming you, killer kills. Not gonna not get you when the meg just unhooked you 10 seconds after i hooked you lol
---
The dev team who created his kit suck. lul
---
It depends
---
Are they the only one asleep? If so, let them be and find others.
---
Is everyone asleep? Sleep them one more time and then chase them.
---
Is one or two other people asleep? You might hit them, but I'd not down them. They'll either waste time healing, or are in danger in being downed if they are caught in a bad position. 
---
If the gen is super progressed? Then do it a couple more times and then decide.
---
Generally I go for hooks to put pressure if there is at least one other survivor asleep. Hooking them while no one else is asleep isn't always bad, especially from a pressure standpoint, but you kinda wanna have intel on at least one survivor at all times.
---
Sounds like a weird pale wraith
---
Not sure when they will but I'm in the same boat. I'll play killer and knock a survivor through a window or through a pallet stun and I'm like "that sucks but thems the breaks". *hooks*
---
 Gave me a good laugh, thank you!
---
How though? What did he do wrong? You're not making all that much sense if I'm honest.
---
Can there be an obsession without and obsession perks/ad ons?I think I was the obsession once without anyone using anything
---
Not liking content and saying it = Lack of intelligence. TIL.
---
These perks are all interesting and unique. Some values may need to be tweeked though. 16 meters seems really close. And the healling one sounds kind of like a netter MoM.
---
I was telling someone earlier that at first I didn't realize Nurse was a killer and thought it was some kind of AI that just went about the map I dunno
---
Why isn't Ash available for purchase with iridescent shares like all the other DLC characters?
---
I would say Freddy because you can get the other killers with irridecent shards
---
Okay thank you.
---
Galllade
---
No...not yet.
---
I too have been suffering from this. From what i can tell it only doesn't play like 70% of the time... so it's still a massive problem
---
TLDR: \*oink\*
---
They are progressively moving towards punishing camping, especially with the new emblem system. If you camp right on hook, it is very hard to pip. Unfortunately killers like spirit, nurse, billy, etc. Don’t need to be near the hook since they can get back so fast, so those killers are available to avoid any punishment.
---
I don't know much about Deceit, but that seems like an interesting idea. Btw, happy cake day!
---
Do u have pallets that stun you if someone drops it on u as well? In which universe are you living. Im interested!
---
Help, by asking if Candy Crush works okay?!  What's that got to do with an online ps4 multiplayer game?
---
It's fun on some screw around builds.   Infinite T3 Mike with insidious, distressing, &amp; a dead rabbit makes for quite the "WTF is happening?" effect on survivors.
---
It’s based on personal preference which is fair enough
---
It’s actually one of the safest spots in the game, double pallet in very safe spots. Just don’t get trapped in the bathroom by a billy or bubba and you’re golden.
---
I love how players are so salty they think everything in this game is toxic.
---
 what does other games have to do when you are complaining about DbD?
---
instant + stun, she just waited near the hatch to get downed then just like that she escaped
---
Ah ok, im starting to wonder if it’s possible to get more than 50% health with the regressing skillchecks
---
Laurie, Quentin, Tapp, Myers, Leatherface, Pig, and Freddy are not either because they are licensed
---
Dirty Deeds Done Dirt OINK
---
"I'm going to make a claim where this is already a known thing and try and get OP Downvoted. Perfect plan as always! Just gotta put more coals into my steam engine of a brain here and then watch the upvotes come rolling in for me!"  
---
"Wait, I'm getting downvoted?! AND OP is asking for PROOF!? Shit... I don't have any cause I'm obviously f u c k i n g  w r o n g and lying out of my ass. Oh well! Better call him insecure! That'll show him!"  
---
Honestly Catarina. Thats how I see you. Can you do everyone a favour and politely get bent? Thanks :)
---
It’s supposed to be a list for discussion instead of being needlessly condescending to the OP
---
Yup I have experienced two games like this during my time in dbd where there is clear Killer/Survivor coop.  It's reportable and bannable if you recorded the game.
---
Well actually there illusions know your terms😂👍🤓
---
downvoted to give someone else the honor of making it 69 again
---
I mean I still think the game is fun. If the survivors recognize the killer won’t come back until he predicts a survivor is going to be there, then go at a time he doesn’t predict it. Like I’ll walk to gens to see if there’s anyone until about 10 seconds before the hook change, so the survivors have plenty of time to be altruistic. I don’t see it as any different than going to a generator you think a survivor will be at
---
Dwight Schrute costume?
---
Was there a firecracker involved?
---
Freddy main, haunted grounds should be way higher, absolute godsend of a perk when you get it to work but it can be quite unreliable. nurses should be higher aswell because hes one of the best anti heal killers.
---
i dont quite understand the ruin placement tho, and why devour hope is so high.
---
overall good list!
---
Smh imagine not existing tbh
---
Ability: Summons multiple killers and survivors from different servers.
---
Because you said that my internet was causing the problems...
---
It’s in the game. Use it. You’re a killer. You kill. Why would you not use it. So what if other people think it’s whack? Being concerned about what other people think of you limits the amount of fun you have in a game. It’s a game for a reason.
---
Ash is a licensed DLC. All dlc is t free dlc.
---
Haha, so me when I'm @ school
---
and it must if as a killer YOU are experiencing issues..
---
she was the only one left
---
This is why balanced landing is superior.
---
There had to have been a perk or addon used by someone. If all players loaded in with no perks or addons, there’s be no obsession.
---
Yes.
---
YOOOOOOOOO! Shawnee Smith plays DbD?! I would of asked "Did you manage to play as The Pig and purposefully kill yourself as Detective Tapp?" Dude. Sorry to seem so fanboy-ey. But to me thats pretty dang sweet.
---
Agreed
---
Lmao, had a similar experience happen to me, saved three people and did four gens (I died) and de-piped for it ?!  Gotta loved the new system ?
---
The bad old days of trying to avoid drawing mom aggro.
---
just get used to the timing and it becomes muscle memory, like flicking with your aim in FPS games.
---
My friend just had it pretty bad in one game. The next wasn’t as bad.
---
This happens to me soo much it's crazy.
---
Killer doesn't want the person who embarrassed them to get hatch, and the randoms will gladly sell you out for an escape.
---
I've even had it happen in a SWF... Killer kept leaving my friend alone , wanted me bad.
---
My friend did the last gen since he wasn't gonna kill him and we both escaped.
---
Killers are way more toxic than survivors
---
Don't say that about best girl nea
---
This is absolutely horrifying.
---
Nope. Not even on about the content. Again. lack of intelligence. No I'm talking about how you seem to think subs matter on a youtube channel. That being not only childish but stupid. Ergo, you are an idiot. Good day. :)
---
I understand what you mean, but I really don’t see them losing too much of their own identity. Wraith would still be bing bong invisible just with an adjustment. Trapper could still have traps but maybe carry them as stacks like the huntress does with her axes. They’re still traps, he just works different
---
Ah true the combos would be sweet enough to even make the survivor laugh but with 7 survivors roaming free and on the same number of gennys the killers are somehow better working solo most the time too so its still kinda balanced.
---
They should have this as an unrankes or separately ranked game mode honestly I would be in full support 😂
---
We can hit you through windows. if your standing AWAY from the window... ok, but if it right as you land... it was a normal hit.
---
Normal American day!
---
NOED isn't OP, it punishes players and teams who don't go looking for Totems, for which they are rewarded with BP. They should go and look for it, it's not hard to find 5 totems
---
Cool
---
What the fuck, these are way better than they should be.  
---
Good job
---
"yet" is the operative word here. We have announced in a live stream that we are working on it. :)
---
Well, tbh I really enjoy watching killers hooking teabaggers at the exit gates that didn't predict the potential presence of NOED and got cocky and toxic as u said, but it is not there for that. My theory(and many  people's theory) for NOED is that it helps killers that don't do well until the exit doors are powered up to have another chance to at least get an easier kill at the end. And since most players are too altruistic to leave him behind they may fall as well trying to save the one and it happens so many times. Although it is quite nice to feel that ur teammates want to help you escape, sometimes it ends up in a total failure and everyone is dead with the killer head-shaking the first altruistic player to try saving the hooked one. Overall I would say NOED is just on the good side of killer perks but maybe not the best for an experienced killer.
---
As for Ruin, I would never say it is OP at least for most killers. It just makes the game slower. Now in one of my last matches, me and the rest of the survivors managed to repair all gens with ruin on and only one guy hooked once because the killer(LF) was camping the hex totem(mostly). One guy died at the end, the rest of us escaped. But in other games of mine, killers combine ruin with camping and tunneling hooked players making an easy 4k. 
---
It is my first post in this sub. I don't like complaining but something needs to be done about those killers. Everything I mentioned is part of the game,everyone does what he wants with the game, but the game got really fucked up lately
---
be team player ;)
---
I've literally not had a single killer hesitate to pick me up when tunneling me since the change, as they just know people don't use DS now. It's not an anti tunneling perk at all its just a dead perk now. I don't see anyone using it.
---
"NO FATSHAMING ALLOWED ON REDDIT&lt; WOMEN ARE BOOTIFUL AND MEN ARE PIGS"
---
Well, I will let the numbers speak for them self. I appreciate ur time and have a good day sir! :) ''Mr.famous youtuber''
---
Honestly, yesterday I dc'd twice because in those two games, two players dc'd. I just didn't see the point.
---
😂😂😂
---
r/theydidthemonstermath
---
&gt; meg just unhooked you 10 seconds after i hooked you lol.
---
10 seconds is a long time. If you're still at the hook after 10 seconds...you're gonna camp. No matter when Meg unhooks me...you're gonna be there. So I don't blame Meg, cuz you're gonna keep coming back to the hook every 5 seconds or so to tunnel. So no matter when Meg unhooks me you're gonna be there to make sure you down me before I can get away and ignore Meg.
---
Boring game, and I move on to the next one and hopefully get a better killer. Sad I have to hope for better opponents to get a fun match. In most games it's the other way around.
---
so am i not allowed to counter DS? just asking
---
Spirit in the game of potatoes didn't want to farm. I did at least manage to bait her and struggle off her shoulders though.
---
You really are just a fucking idiot hahahaha
---
I am thinking about it too but I really don't want to reach to that point. I really love how the game was a few months ago and I still hope it'll get better. It can be much fun. We can make it so
---
Still a cool idea
---
I like how you're going for an insult like that when I said in the first place that I don't care lmfao.
---
you do you but i refuse to play that
---
Yes but not when the chase ends as soon as you get pulled lol.
---
Bet she gives good neck, swallow every inch. Bitch got skills.
---
Have you played much survivor?
---
Hook and leave killers are the most fun. Even if they run me over with a lawnmower and 4k my ass...it's still fun.
---
Hook and leave 4k -&gt; Fun
---
Camp 4k -&gt; most boring shit ever
---
it would be cool but itll never happen
---
Well if you hit one he is vulnerable,so the closest to get hooked,so that's I chose that word but,yeah, "Hooked" is more accurate
---
Yes, that is far more believable than two people telling you more than one creator council participant has said they got a peek at the new killer. 
---
I've told you my source, first or second stream back from canada. Believe what you want.
---
&gt; unless it’s a coordinated SWF
---
I play TotH a lot just because and I can tell you that coordinated SWF groups absolutely do not cleanse totems. Straight up, survivors almost never even try
---
Flip the page around, pooh!!!! Wouldn't need to squint if you actually looked at the word
---
Ah right, sorry lol
---
So you can't hit *over* a dropped (or being dropped) pallet right?
---
I'm new new, like 3 days new
---
When is rank reset and how often is it?
---
My thing is once i get to a tile or somewhere safer they are already on my ass and i take a hit. Sometimes i take a hit as soon as the chase starts and it takes me a minute to get sonewhere where i feel safe and i dont have any space to do any loops before i toss a pallet.
---
Lmao
---
Okay I admit, it is more reason 2 than 1.
---
Darn better get rid of my colored perks me no want ban
---
And going back to the hook is 100% evil. It's when you go back to the hook, run around and ignore the unhooker and tunnel the guy that just got unhooked.
---
That's when it's 100% lame sauce.
---
Last year the nightmare x dbd
---
He knows how to do this and won’t tell anybody else. Then read my other comment.
---
thanks &lt;3
---
Lol ok fair point
---
I definitely hesitate when I spawn next to a totem like that. I feel bad for the killer because the game screwed him out of one their perks right away.
---
FOR REAL!
---
Don’t let me drop the pallet if I’m just gonna get hit anyway.
---
Ive seen some people reccomend camping and tunneling to get kills. I wonder if I can find the channel again.
---
&gt; over a dropped
---
You can hit a survivor who is sliding across a pallet. If they're just on the other side you can't hit them. Unless you're Huntress or Plague
---
&gt; (or being dropped)
---
The 3 outcomes I listed earlier apply here
---
I dont have problems with pallets on window hits occasionally. All about timing. If you cant time it right on a normal connection and get bupped that's on you. Then again I understand the frustration if the killer isnt good and that's the hit that fucks you over.
---
It's the middle of every month. It's the 12th or 13th of every month where they reset the ranks usually.
---
Why would you watermark a generic application of an existing meme lol.
---
Husk tried to use internet shield!  
---
But it failed so fucking miserably that he just ended up looking like a bigger fucking idiot
---
He said he’s not gonna show people how to do it
---
This is helpful information. Does vaulting windows help with bloodlust if you break the chase?
---
The killers all look pretty spot on, but Huntress, Hag and Spirit look like they could be actual Lego versions of the characters. Amazing!
---
Happened earlier, game started off with a DC as well.
---
Yeah you should be able to kill without a first hook restriction smh
---
Discord at B? Wut?
---
A
---
It appears there is someone else who basks in others' salt. It's great aint it
---
If you ever become a really good killer you'll get it. Until that day, have fun being toxic and boring. Enjoy.
---
I asked HybridPanda live on his stream if he knew who the next killer was and he said yes

59 juicy days, and some days with two memes.

Um no bitch.
---
He didnt say who the killer was.. he said YES, he knows who it is thus not breaking the NDA
---
I'm totally on board for doing a Trump skin for Clown
---
I don't think that flashlights are in it of themselves toxic, it's just when players run up to you and stay just out of range and constantly flash it in your face over and over again that it gets annoying because they're taunting you. Yeah I get that they're wasting time by trying to annoy me when they do that and they're not doing generators, but it still annoys me all the same.
---
I blocked him now. It's not that I can't take criticism It's just that he gives me nothing. His ''feedback'' is worthless to me. It's all just hate, I don't see a reason why not to block him. Idk what his problem was :P  
---
But if he is a true hater, then he will find a new way of hating.
---
well the reason behind why it doesnt is because it doesnt count as a normal hit it counts as a blink attack and that counts for every killer for example huntress axes doesnt count wraith surprise attack doesnt count, the hags phantasm attack doesnt count, the pigs ambush attack doesnt count, the trappers traps dont count nearly every killer that can used their ability to get a hit doesnt count
---
My 4 mains are Huntress, Piggly Wiggly, Myers and Billy. I also play on ps4 can confirm, this is accurate as fuck.
---
You sleep a survivor
---
You apply OC
---
They wake up
---
You resleep them
---
Then you either hit them, chase to hook, or go off to sleep other people.
---
This is best with Blocks and combines well with Huntress Lulaby. Still does well by itself.
---
Matchmaking sucking combined with the new PIP system SUCKS. I was 1 pip away from 6 and I'm not mid 9 because all we get is rank 2 killers all night. I havent played in a week and really have no desire to head back in right now and that's sad because I love this game typically
---
go outside
---
haha oh i was going to ask what drilling means!
---
Could we get Chris Hansen in DBD? Except as a killer
---
They're not, but toxic survivors almost always have them.
---
HAHAHHAAHHAHAaHahhahhhhahahahahhaaaaaaaaa...... you must be new here. If you weren't already able to convert other people's salt into joy, your going to. Don't take anything anyone says seriously, they just mad that they die
---
All the other kids...

My wallet: Press X to doubt

Doctor? The big black man with big hands and an actual education? Make it for Clown and then we’ll talk.
---
Drunk not even after the first game
---
Feeling god WaW vibes so much.
---
Freddy has to play a certain way. You need 1-2k before the gens go. Then you need to activate blood warden and know where they are already. If you don't you get screwed by awake run outs usually.
---
Orang man bad!! He baby hand
---
Yo-yo
---
That’s not the fault of Legion then, that’s the fault of the braindead people you got paired with. You can’t call a killer OP because your teammates aren’t doing anything.
---
haha itd be funny for it to say after a killer match "Entity Pissed"
---
i would dc in order to let the last survivor get the hatch but other than that i dont see a point
---
I can understand that. But as developers have stated, it's not bannable and it is more of a lose all around. Killers choice to start it. Toxicity is around the gane both survivors and killers can do such, from being creative in game or post game chat. 
---
The best we can all do is make due with what we have and cant do. See someone camping? Do gens near them and if he pulls away towards you have someone get the person off hook. 
---
It's a horrible situation but what can you do? The more people complain the more people will laugh and not care. Toxicity is part of every game and as gamers we have two options: complain or make the best of the situation.
---
Can I get the original pic please? Want to make my own meme with this
---
This is like a 0IQ move. Why would anyone do this? If they were lagswitching they'd do it in game.
---
More likely he just had shit connection.
---
I love how the same people who call others "NPCs" for not liking Trump spend all day parroting this "orange man bad" meme-criticism. It really is just a fantastic lack of awareness.
---
Mm young ash 😍
---
If I gave gold's I'd give one to you.
---
Yeah man that happens. There is even a streamer who go temp banned for doing it on stream...not gonna name any names though....
---
I only do it to toxic survivors if I know for a fact that they're gonna die. It also serves them right.  What's the point of dancing after dropping every pallet?
---
Meh...
---
yeah, i think that as well because usually when i'm spectating somebody and use DS, it appears that the perk is brighter and the skillcheck as well so
---
Rank 20 killer here. 
---
i don't camp, don't tunnel. don't get too many kills, to be honest. but i'm ok with that, i enjoy hunting down survivors. i  play survivors more often than killer, so i can study people and learn new tactics. 
---
it would be nice if i got more kills, but i'm ok with getting 0-2, as long as i don't have to play on the meat packing plant.  :)
---
That all? 
---
Should have recorded more.
---
Saw this movie over the weekend, and let me tell you this movie was such a let down imo
---
It’s not even about ranking up. The rank is the reward if anything. And I’d like to climb out of potato rank ville. The best teammates tend to be in Purple ranks (5-8) IMO. Rank 1-4 is just sweatville. All Hillbillies’ with Moris. 
---
My main issue is that I didn’t even get shit for points now. I’m lucky if I break 15k. And then I don’t even get a pip for it to compensate. Meaning there is no reward for any of these games. They aren’t enjoyable, and I’m steamrolled. It’s just really disheartening a I really liked this game...
---
Ugh, well I’ll definitely be on the lookout then if I’m playing solo. It’s not even that I embarrassed the killer either (minus the fact that they didn’t get me for twenty minutes of colluding gameplay). They had hooked me earlier, and I only escaped a couple of chases, and did a couple gens. (Nor was I an Ash running MoM that could have pissed them off).
---
For real tho. More importantly it's not fun for either the killer or the survivors. Once you get a taste of that sweet sweet hunting, camping becomes ultra degenerate
---
it’s caused by lag, dedicated servers will fix it, so summer this year.
---
You're missing the side boob... Kappa
---
you can find me. i can't do shit but lay there and bleed out. i have to depend on a single use of a very situational perk or someone else. literally boring, i'm not doing it. you supposed to be looking for me anyway, like it's your objective, you even have "survivor found" bp compensation. i don't get shit for being a slug except for boredom. 
---
besides, old ds i used only couple times just for testing out builds and there being slugged for it was 100% okay. here i literally lose a perk because it's only active for 60 seconds and if i'm on death hook i can't use a perk that counters killer's shit decisions not unnecessary punishes like old ds.
---
No you need to hook everyone 3 times. Someone in this game probably escaped from the hatch and he didn't get the last kill.
---
Camping I only encounter occasionally. DC on the other hand...
---
Also comms are super prevalent but we don't talk about that
---
Really? I was hyped to go see it as well :[
---
Sounda like Wraith
---
Sounds like an offbrand wraith
---
I mean, with his first hit, I ran off as far as I could hoping someone else would get it while I was being chased. They did get it later since he hooked me far from the totem, and they got it while he was facecamping me too, and he still didn't leave.
---
They really should just have better placement in the tiles. A lot of them are in plain sight and only a few tiles have actual good spots where they're tucked away.
---
Had a Plague stand above me while I was downed shaking her head 'no' at me while puking (I was already infected) and then proceeded to camp me at the hook with 5 gens still to do. What'd I do you ask? I almost finished breaking her ruin totem. I didn't know playing the game was toxic. 🤷‍♂️
---
Just a hurricane of axe swings
---
Badass idea
---
It's 2019.
---
Theres nothing wronng with using it, but it will prevent you from getting better eventually
---
I like how you censor goddamn but not fucking haha
---
Usually it’s just the character no map or killer
---
**EXPOSED**
---
He got like... 11k BP's I think, which tbh is too much imo. I only got 3k for being chased. I had found the totem super early in the middle of a cornfield, so I didn't get to do much other game stuff. But the time I was on hook, 3 gens were done.  
---
When the gates were open, he camped another person too. But someone had grabbed my anti-hemorrhagic needle and was able to save them.
---
Anything is possible as long as the developers have the time and resources to do so. When they said 5 years is a projected timeline of the games life, and I wouldn’t call it impossible that we could get more game modes.
---
What's worse? A survivor who d/c's at the beginning of the game? Or a killer who mercilessly takes advantage of it?
---
With the flashlights and toolboxes...
---
yes, if you're a survivor then completing generators, unhooking and healing teammates, successfully surviving chases, etc will be the categories you want to go for.
---
You know what? I’m not done. The point of this post was to bait idiots like you into getting pissed, you fell into his trap. My comment was made for the same reason, you fucking fell for it twice
---
It is, it’s a thing of beauty
---
Oink
---
Just like how when they said killers based of actual phobias like Clowns will ‘never’ happen, right?
---
Lol, you're wrong.
---
I love running STBL on my Clown paired with Enduring and Spirit Fury. It transformed me into a fucking machine gun.
---
lmao oh god you’re a sad little man
---
That all?
---
Yeah some killers arent smart or get emotion over small things like that. Not all killers just some! Like if he had insidous i kinda would get why he's camping but if not he's just being a jerk.
---
Irrelevant, but skuntank is my favorite Pokémon
---
Haha chill yall it was a funny coincidence this was somebody's name on console
---
Still?! Why can’t you just let it go?
---
I haven't tried enough, but I heard looking down works better?    I heard that somewhere.  Maybe I'll try it later today or something.
---
Are they actually ever going to fix this games load in bug and my follow up any chance we get an event that isn't broke at launch?
---
I said on a recent post that this would be a *hilarious* idea, except the killers aren't teamed up and need the most kills.  
---
For instance:  
---
Hilly-billy downs you and picks you up, then WHAM, he's hit by a Huntress hatchet and you're set free! But you gotta run now.
---
How so? Pointing out an irony? Oh what a tragedy
---
what side boob :/ ?
---
Add Dark Devotion and Infectious Fright to the "does this shit even do anything with Freddy?" tier.
---
COOL SHIT BRO VERY NICE UWU OWO 👍👍 YES
---
&gt;Since the 23th of januari this issue has been in the game.
---
I immediately just started rummaging through all the issues in the game in my mental library.
---
thanks
---
We play a game where we can kill haha offending god or religion should be a non issue lol

Everyone huh? I’ve let about 30 survivors go in the last couple hours alone, I didn’t know I was being toxic 😕
---
why am I getting karmabombed for no reason.
---
Do you not play the game? Do you understand that using no mither and self-care together is a joke? Do you know what no mither is?
---
Most killers are just all "yup, totes camped, get over it!"  
---
But why lie about it when everyone can *see* you doing it? It's Kindred 3. They watched as he stood in front of me for two solid minutes, hitting me over and over again.
---
i dont get it
---
Thank you man
---

Never considered Trump to be anywhere sexy, but I won't judge. I'm in however for more doctor skins, like Teacher , COP and Gangster Carter
---
Killers are rewarded more points for score events. The economy is needed as most are addon reliant for each match.
---
And you're supposed to avoid getting found &amp; downed. If you don't like being slugged, don't use DS(we can tell, if your my obsession, 80% of the time you have DS). If you don't like getting hooked, run perks to escape &amp;/or avoid the killer(any exhaustion perk, lightweight, quick &amp; quiet &amp; diversion for example). Being hooked is the same as being downed except you cant move. You don't get points for being hooked or slugged, &amp; we don't get points for losing a surv &amp; having a surv saved from a hook.
---
If you just in general don't like being slugged or hooked(which you would dislike with your arguments against slugging, or your just salty killers are trying to manage their time effectively), stop playing the game. If you just like being completely untouched &amp; immortal, this isn't the game for that, &amp; i'm giving none of that "just switch to killer biz" 'cause i don't want a toxic killer bring down the rest of us like you do to survs.
---
Very well done. The head choices were spot on and really make it work.

---
How are you still going? Wtf
---
I feel like I should know this, but what is meant when people refer to a) slugging and b) tunneling?
---
Also does anyone have any tips/good videos that can help win chases as survivors?
---
The hardest I laughed at a Monto video in a while.
---
it still affects me. its tough against any besides hillbilly , even cannibal uses his m1 more than his m2.
---
And you count 120 seconds and it still doesn't go away...
---
heart
---
I'm sorry, huh? I was thinking about Castlevania. 
---
Ohhhh. Okay. Not bad I guess.
---
I've been doing this on and off for about two years. Some characters were easier to make than others. Legion took about 20 minutes, but Wraith and Plague took much longer, and they both went through several iterations. I even had to cheese Wraith's weapon and make an alt skin, not the default Azarov's skull.
---
When I ordered something online, it would usually arrive within the week. Stores on bricklink are almost always reliable and respond quickly. I didn't have a single problem with the orders.
---
AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH
---
Pretty much me every game, killer lunges can be pretty insane.
---
A man of quality!
---
For me it’s Rank 13-8 that is pure trash and filth. It’s painful to claw your way out of.
---
i am saddened that noone downvoted for a 69, it is now 76. upvoting again.
---
Was balance landing always the most popular exhausting perk?
---
Possibly one of the best concepts I’ve ever seen so far. My only worry is Low Profile just promotes camping, but still valuable to use. Maybe just safer to use NOT on Charlie, so Killer doesn’t predict it easily. 
---
Still though. All of these are pretty solid. Did you have any idea for a counterpart killer or cosmetics/character design for Charlie?
---
y-you didnt buy it right?
---
Shirtless pig
---
A suggested non license survivor that isn't just OP and looks fun? BHVR should use this in the game and as an example of something new and fun.
---
Filthy Killers at a Reasonable Price
---
I've seen enough people playing this game on potato PCs with jumping FPS from 10 to 50 to understand that most of the time those are not nearly as impressive.
---
I feel you long lobby times, que in shorthanded, slide bug still present, trees try to eat you, can barely see auras on mormond. I complained about the bugs on the official forum and said no one should buy cosmetics or chapters and i got banned. #honesty
---
Killer main since launch, could not be further from the truth. No killer wants less than a 4k, and they're made increasingly hard to get unless you get a few solo queues in your lobby or the swf you are playing drastically over estimates how slick they are.
---
Given the sheer number of "second chance" perks there are for survivors to get away with taking hits or unlocking themselves, it can sometimes be hard to even secure one against a coordinated SWF.
---
(Cue clip of Big Boss saluting over The Boss’ grave)
---
and also, i started using ds like yesterday. before that playing my normal builds i was getting Obsession status with no fukin reason just because someone in game had ds or mettle of man. so yeah, fuck you and your assumptions. ds right now is a totally awesome perk that i highly respect people using because now it's just a help against cunts that feel the need to go for unhooked person. so shut up and stop assuming people's sides.
---
this deserves a platinum im sorry i have no money
---
Anyone who also comments, correct me if I’m wrong!
---
a) Slugging is when a killer downs a survivor and, instead of hooking them, leaves them in the dying state and moves on to down another survivor
---
b) Tunnelling is when a killer basically clings to one survivor. For example, say a Dwight has just been hooked and a Meg comes to unhook him. If the killer then chooses to chase the Dwight, no matter what the Meg does, he is “tunnelling” the Dwight.
---
With regard to tips on chases, what I try to do is confuse them with scratch marks. So if I run into a room, I’ll try and do a lap so my scratch marks aren’t obviously pointing to which way I went (sorry if this makes no sense 😂)
---
Hope this helped you out!
---
I guess so :/
---
Honestly, I have no interest in hitting Rank 1 ever again, it's just not fun
---
You did say so, and you were wrong so I guess you weren't as sure as you thought.
---
Okay, A: thought you where saying Nurse slugging you to bring up slugging in general
---
B: slugging is situational, a nurse won't pick you up if someone else is hooked as they won't be able to blink back. I'm sorry, but if you're a killer main you should know WHY someone slugs you. Either to save them A LOT of time, or because there's 2 survs left. Just because someone is a Nurse doesn't mean that there no allowed to play strategically.
---
C: if your talking slugging as in not hooking &amp; just downing everyone, ok. i get that, but at least wait &amp; see if you'll be healed or everyone is downed before DCing(in my opinion at least(might be different for you, but at least try to wait, don't wan't another one of us DCing because a generator was completed)). 
---
now if you'll excuse me, i'm going to sleep. goodbye
---
I challenge you to get max sacrifice points without a mori. $20 in steam/Xbox/psn gift cards says you can't.
---
I like how the one that didnt disconnect was named“Hex: Cockslut” that made me laugh for too long and idk why
---
Memes are welcome yes, but at the same time it's sad to see that all we have to keep this place from becoming a shithole is just memes. I know it's impossible to ask everyone to stop bitching for just a few moments but if it was possible, this sub could get cleaned up a little more. Make room for some actual discussions, which are super rare sights on front page.
---
Damn don’t make me break out the secret weapon; the quad back maneuver.
---
I literally explained with math how you can max it out without a Mori.
---
It's harder to rank up but it's not that bad.
---
If you think you're having a bad time ranking up though try playing survivor, they have it even worse atm. Lol
---
Show your work then. What do you have to lose?
---
I see your point
---
Haha, thanks. Sorry you had to listen to some salty survivor yell at you for fake collision.
---
He brought a flithy AND a nasty blade to school
---
you do realize that NOED doesn't counter BT and MoM, right?
---
I've been able to reach Rank 1 with The Pig on PS4 and I haven't faced any Survivors above Rank 4.
---
Honestly it seems like solo Survivors can't get past Rank 8 and SWF's can't get passed Rank 4.
---
Yup, if you're cleansing at the fountain next to the gen you're working on, you kinda deserve to be downed.
---
The shit thing about this is, by occupying the killer for an entire match, you did not score points of any other type, and also deprived your teammates of some. This system rewards you for playing like a drone, and punishes you for playing well.
---
"I'm sure he didn't notice."
---
*sniped off the gen by half-map Shock Therapy*
---
I love when a survivor pallet stuns you, tea bags, you fake the phase, and they vault right into your arms. Greatest feeling
---
Now that’s what i call a happy ending
---
yeah. i have been stuck at the same rank rank for a week. almost every game i just get zero rank up even if i leave through the exit gates. its incredibly frustrating. in my last game i got 17k points and didn't even come close to pipping. i did all kinds of shit but i just didn't tick all the right boxes so all my work means nothing. feeling like i need to tick inane boxes instead of play the game organically is so incredibly NOT fun.
---
It happens to everyone atleast once I guess ^^. My killer dc-ed after it happened to me and I did not realise for a while what happened actually lol
---
WARNING: Entitled survivor main whining about how op killers perks are when their team all are running Adreniline, borrowed time, dead hard, and self-care and they have memorized every totem and pallet spawn on every map.
---
Oh yeah, killers have it easy, nothing to fear against an organized four man team on mics.
---
Immersed survivors are the survivor equivalent of facecampers.  They aren't worth the skin their printed on and basically serve no other purpose than to simply do nothing while they kill their teamates and wait out their hatch.  Hot garbage every last one of them.
---
Short Answer: No
---
Long Answer: Dedicated servers won't fix this either.
---
I disagree, but if you dont play a lot of killer I can see how you would come to that conclusion.
---
With mettle of man, dead hard, borrowed time, etc etc... you can easily lose 2-3 generators to chasing a skilled survivor. In those cases I often. Break off the second a chase takes me by another survivor and pray to the entity that they're worse at running.
---
From a killer main point of view, it seems like devs math it out as 4x more survivors than killers, and the public face of their game are survivor streamers.
---
It's why the hatch close mechanic was fully scrapped. Too many survivors complaining about not being able to escape.
---
I'm not saying there arent some very un-fun things to survive against (1 shot hatchets, for example), but once you hit purple ranks as a killer... it's time to play something else until rank reset.
---
i didn't say that my obsession is never a DS user, but most of the time at least one surv is using it. i personally power through it(i swear it's 5 &amp; not 3 seconds, but i might just be scarred from the old one). btw i never said DS is a bad perk. I LOVE the new one(it's still annoying to face, but in the same way that thanatophobia is). Also "assuming people's sides." what? you mean me calling you a surv main? cause... that's just what i felt from what you where saying; Just like me seeing someone who is of the female SEX &amp; my brain says, "well, i mean... i'm not gonna make up a personality for everyone you see. They are a female both sex &amp; gender unless they say otherwise, 'cause i'm not spending my time on trying to read their mind" then talk the them &amp; then get yelled at for "assuming their gender". If your talking about me assuming my obsession has DS, well, yeah. It's a good obsession perk, it's 60s, you can easily get use of it if you're not tunnelled. Hence why i assume my obsession is going to run it.
---
Um...do you know how these perks work?
---
NOED gives me the speed boost to prevent the unhook by catching survivors quickly and immediately downing someone who's healthy. 
---
Mettle of man only activates if someone is injured. I could have downed the MoM guy while he was healthy and caught him with NOED.
---
But I don't wanna be forced to use a perk like that, esp when it can be easily removed by a totem cleanse.
---
I've been able to get to Rank 1 with Killer... And I main The Pig...
---
If you suspect BT you can always subdue your terror radius away with your bell so BT doesn't trigger.
---
I wouldn’t say it’s a let down. It sure does go slow though and you’ll probably be a bit bored halfway through.
---
Still, I think it’s worth a watch.
---
It really is a shitty movie unfortunately.
---
You should add the concept art. You’d be surprised how supportive people are of it.
---
NOED counters MoM unless they are injured.
---
It’s 60 seconds at base.
---
Lol you're mad they denied you the ability to get a camp kill? 
---
This is exactly why me and my SWF run BT , DS , DH and MOM. These are the situations these perks were made for. 
---
The counterplay to this is ... Get good.
---
Okay so specifically a nurse standing over you, waiting for DS to run out?
---
please don't reply for a while... me ned rest
---
Nurse mains are lowkey very chill yet weird ass players. Usually really good but you have no idea what goes on in their head sometimes.
---
Frank and yank em.
---
Slap the item out of their hands and pull the ripcord. It's about the only way to hurt em.
---
Have you ever tried to find a urban evading Claudette when playimg killer? Lol
---
I actually do that. There are many perks that I never touch because they may not match my playstyle. But I have about a dozen of those than I play with. I always liked to mix things up. Otherwise the game feels boring. I really hope people do that as well. It would be nice to have to guess, adjust and use different tactics at each game ftw.
---
And it feels like you actually move slightly fadtercthan walking pace while crouching with urbanm
---
Camping only works if the survivors are playing poorly. In the time it takes for a killer to find, chase, catch, hook and then facecamp to death one survivor, 3 good survivors can easily get 3 gens done, and more likely 4-5. Camping only works when there are one or more survivors waiting near the hook, being completely useless to the team, and promoting bad play by not capitalising on the killer's mistake.
---
If you can't rank up past 16... You're doing something wrong.
---
Did you know camping can cause you to not pip?
---
Alot of yellow ranks aren't aware
---
The lack of uniforms and the violence suggests America, but the stabbing leads me to believe this takes place in England.
---
Should of recorded the part where legion loses chase then follows you as the frenzy bar slowly runs outm
---
Yes, a common misconception comes from those who think this is a competitive game (which is ridiculous) and that the rank system is competitive, but its there only to make sure a new killer doesn't face survivors with +2000h of play time.
---
Me neither I'm more boosted as killer than as a survivor. As a survivor I can struggle in those prison ranks because I'm good but I'm very good as a kinda support, I'm not one of those who can carry a potato team to victory.
---
My goal is always to reach a rank where my fellow teammates now what to do when I run Kindred.
---
Would be neat if you could also use it to unhook yourself. Again, like you said, would need some hardcore balancing done to it, but it would still be a pretty neat "Boy howdy my teammates are useless" perk for when nobody goes for heals or saves.
---
Blood Warden. You gotta plan a couple gens ahead of time but it’s your best bet
---
Lmao, just farm with Legion. I've been doing this, and I have pipped once every game. Stab the survivors about 40 million times, smack some gens, repeat. I also hook everyone once (muh BBQ), then slug until the game is over.
---
Okay. And...?
---
Not really sure what you're getting at.
---
The perks are way too strong imo. Good concept tho.
---
I’m definitely a weeb but I ain’t scared
---
Doing God's work &lt;3
---
How about becoming better at killer so you won't make it to the end game stage at all?
---
Lol the retcon.
---
Honestly I got tired of doing this every game recently. Solo survivor is so boring. Killer is way more fun for me, don’t gotta rely on potato Kate’s  and megs. I can hook em instead
---
Bro I just explained the math to you again lol. Please just look at my other comments so I dont have to explain it again.
---
Totally agree. Throws off the balance of the game. Furthermore, it requires no brainpower or skill to use. Epitome of a crutch perk.
---
I just got back into dbd and I'm loving it but the load times r brutal. 10-15 mins to find a game is stress
---
Low loops for dodging sick and hatchets. Moving around objects when killer is searching an area. Getting unhook from someone surrounded by  hag traps.  I rate urban, but some immersed surviors use it wrong.
---
NOED and pre-nerf DS. I can argue Adreniline and MoM are crutch as well but they aren't as impactful as ds and not as unbalanced as NOED so it's whatever.
---
Omg roasted!  Perfection.
---
https://redd.it/b8nk2q Did this without a mori about 2 weeks ago
---
Trash killer using noed haha. Good job!
---
They all look so terrified of the killer
---
I’d that’s how it works that’s not how it reads. It very clearly says “mettle of man will deactivate will deactivate the next time you are put into the dying state”
---
Why cant we all just say all perks are good in their own way. I dont care what perks you run.
---
Nah I'm not salty. I just know what's lame and what isn't. There's nothing wrong with being lame as long as you admit it!  
---
It's just a video game, if I get tunneled I move on to the next game. Honestly feel nothing. You seem to really get off on trying to make survivors salty though. Were you bullied a lot in school and this is your chance to get revenge, lul
---
Exactly. Same here.
---
I love spirit.
---
Get this man a $20 steam card.
---
He got 11 hooks in the game not 12. He got 200 points from going into the last phase when someone got hooked on their second hook. If you take that 200 away from sitting on the hook, you'll end up with 700 points. Which would be the 12th hook and the final hook phase.
---
Neither BBQ or Nurses are crutch perks, they are both easily countered (unless it's a billy or nurse that has BBQ) and they don't make that big of a difference. If tracking alone counts as crutchs then the Doctor and Freddy are the strongest killers in the game.
---
Yes, everyone who doesnt have the same hierarchy of values as you is stupid, you are 100% right. I am never short on bloodpoints, and mood &gt; imaginary currency. And I am obviously whiny, because I get upset over witnessing character being brutally killed in the pseudo-horror game.
---
I'm guessing you also have a screenshot of your load out for that game
---
Well done!
---
When/are they going to fix FPS on PS4 To run at 60fps?
---
I'm not saying the perks are bad, I'm saying that the perk is so strong that it carries you every game.
---
yeah i wish getting hit would stop the pallet drop animation, if the hit would down you
---
Devour SOAP
---
My anxiety...
---
I love this. Tbh if I could play some hobo street urchin I would drop Nea in a heartbeat. Fun perks, neato character. Gimme.
---
Suddenly Wu Chang shows up.
---
I've never even saw these assholes before*
---
Windows aren't walls. Killers can reach through them.
---
As much as I hate babykillers I'm inclined to agree with you immersed survivors feel even worse.  They piss me off so much lol.  I can loop a killer to try and prevent the hook and camp but I cannot force a teamate to be useful.
---
*stares at post with no emotion*
---
Haha, ye. Some say I have a pretty odd laugh. I can't disagree tho, haha!
---
It depends on lunge range for the window I think. Tier 3 Mikey can DEFINITELY hit you from the other side of a window.
---
I was playing killer and there was a meg who did no gens and walked around the map. She didn’t save any team mates and eventually left someone to die on the floor to try and get the hatch. She stood still next to the hatch for too long and got crows and good thing the killer got her. I had 20k the other two had 18k and the Meg 3k.
---
Oh wow enduring really helps you knock down ds guy before he gets to a pallet or vault, amazing, I'm sure sometimes you were successful. Even if ds guy does go down again shortly after, that is still like 16 extra seconds that 3 gens are being worked on by the time you get to a hook.
---
Dude where the fuck that you live that you can get a beer +tip for $7, where I live it's like $7-9 for a beer
---
i mean he technically walks faster since he slows survivors down by 15 percent and if you throw a bottle down when you pick up a survivor with d-strike you can make them run slower after you take d-strike
---
You will be fine. Its also not against the rules to win as killer.
---
God?
---
ok, i'll agree with you about this but tbh, UE should have a cooldown so at least players will be mindful of how to use that perk instead of spamming that shit the entire match.
---
Thought Cerberus busted through the gate and took your legs off
---
Its fun safety-pipping for running around the killer for 4 gens, running out of a purple medkit for healing others, and escaping. You did all that? Heres a safety pip, better luck next time. 
---
~~(its either that or getting 4k'd before one gen is popped)~~
---
You are correct.
---
If someone is running decisive strike now a random person is the obsession. So that might have happened to you.
---
Gotta go fast asserting dominance
---
there is nothing wrong with what you did
---
No because i wouldn't  stand for bullying lol, If someone did try to bully me I'd get my "revenge" by giving them something to go cry to mommy about lol. I guess "bullying" nowadays is where you get called a name and break down in tears, no wonder this new generation are called snowflakes lol.  Just because i play how i play triggers you lol. If it doesn't trigger you begone lmao
---
Why not both?
---
I mean he hit me and i would recover faster down him and hook him. It rarely would start a large chase. I felt the point of the perk was for last minute escapes for hatch or near the door. But once again no perk in the game to me and me alone is too powerful.
---
I lived in Denver where you can get cheap draft beer for $5. I currently live in Yuma, AZ where you can *definitely* get a beer for $5.
---
i forgot which episode it was
---
Hit the people unhooking to avoid BT, really MOM has no counter
---
Susie’s Mix Tape?
---
OH SHIT i forgot he was in mk lol
---
chances of survival...none.
---
Worse thing recently is people so scared of "farming" you they just let you hit struggle or die, im about to die anyway at least try if youve come all the way to the hook
---
It's hard for sure. At any jungle gyms with vaults, forget it. And a loop able building such as Ironwork's main structure or the fractured cowshed, forget it. It's great for every situation otherwise.
---
It’s great! I did 3 gens and opened a door yesterday. Even ended up maxing out points in the objective category and didn’t even get iridescent light bringer :)
---
I'm stuck hovering around rank 9/8 on solo survivor. I'll start getting some traction then get knocked back down again because I got face camped or the team didn't get hooked enough or some other frustrating reason.
---
Hopefully it's just an iterative process and BHVR will tweak the formula again.
---
I think you meant "The Tamarind"
---
I actually really like the song she's humming, and after playing DBD, I've noticed myself humming the tune whilst playing other games.  Heh.
---
Gotcha! Thanks for your input!
---
Tunneling/camping are terms used by some survivors to demoralize a killer and invalidate their role by unnecessarily criticizing how they played their own game.
---
I used to be a killer msin, then I switched over to being a survivor main who is and always will be a die hard killer white knight if a survivor bitches about camping and/or tunneling in the post chat.
---
Its actually not a bad perk but people who tend to use it are immersed babies
---
well, i don't think someone will heal themselves with the perk active since the killer can see your aura, especially in the endgames
---
[Is nice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSiouayIEAI&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=77)
---
As someone who doesn't play Doctor...
---
Wtf do the fake Doctors even do?
---
Shows the doctor your last recent location
---
Ahh Seattle Metro
---
Pallets and Windows aren't supposed to 'protect you.' They're utilized in chase mechanics but just being near a pallet or a window isn't a save all. Camping pallets can get you hit through them, just like still being close to a window can get you hit through windows. Even if you vaulted it, it's still a huge ass window the killer can hit you through. Even if you haven't just vaulted it and are just running past a window, the killer's still going to be able to hit you on the other side. 
---
It's not some magic wall that only works for you.
---
While there's definitely some bugs with hitboxes, like I said, pallets and windows aren't there for protection. They're there for utilization, and utilizing them incorrectly will fuck you over.
---
OMG this happened to me yesterday. Me, my friend and a claudette was working on a gen in the red forest against a doctor. It was the last gen and it was at 50%. The p3 Claudette came straight to us, while running tapped her flashlight at us and brought him to us resulting in my friend getting her last hook along with the p3 Claudette. I finished the gen and he downed me and the regular Claudette with NoED. Me and my friend were very upset.
---
Because most campers cant fathom the idea that there proxy 10 meter from the hook patrol is camping.
---
We're talking about fast vault desynch.
---
Points =/= pipping.  It's kind of like the electoral college.
---
i think they should decrease the time it takes to charge his saw
---
Because when Ruin blows up in the first minute and they start powering through gens, you need something to catch up.
---
Gotta keep tradition alive. M O R I that bitch.
---
Literally same. I'm only playing Kill your friends from now on. Ofc we don't always have 5 ppl available tho
---
Yeah. If you’re on the fence on watching it , I would just wait it out and see it online. There’s nothing spectacular about this movie and the ending to me is just so corny
---
Is this legit? Hows this happening
---
If it was PC, the game chat would be toxic af about that
---
Sorry but you don't seem tofully knpw how the perk works.
---
You can heal to full fine with MoM active (ready to go) without being seen. Only after it actually triggered and protected you and *then* you heal you will be seen by the killer.
---
Explains why your beer is so expensive. With $7-9 bucks you could get a Long Island Iced Tea (moreso closer to $9). It's girly, I know, but it fucks you up fast if you're on a budget.
---
No. Sprint Burst once was. I also think Dead Hard is currently more popular but I'm not sure
---
They look like father and daughter
---
Except Susie.
---
???
---
So I shouldn't secure a kill? I should chase the guy with MoM who gets a free hit...and let the team get an easy unhook? Lord the entitlement.
---
I think it was Sprint Burst more often than not because of how it used to cool down.
---
When the Pig stepped in the trap I legit started crying from laughter.
---
What's a BL loop? (Sorry I'm still learning)
---
takes waaay too many hits to take down survivors
---
It's probably also due to a build up of dust that I'm too inexperienced to clean but DBD is the only game that causes my PS4 to overheat. People on my stream say the loading at the start sounds like my PS4 trying to take off. I can now no longer play more than three rounds at a time lol.
---
This is the same community who blames players for hatch standoffs and not the mechanic itself
---
There should be a certain radius where the survivor's health bar will either go down slower or not do down at all, punishing the killer by wasting even more times and letting generators get done for staying nearby the hooked survivor. To keep bloodpoints from getting too high, for every, for example, ten seconds the killer spends within that radius, they lose a considerable amount of bloodpoints. they, however, can be in that radius without the risk of bloodpoints if another survivor is withing the radius
---
Survivors usually don't except it as well. Works well with  others killers too if you use Insidious too although it isn't really worth the perk slot unless you plant to camp etc.
---
When chasing survivors as killer on PC (I mostly play Doctor) is it faster to just press W when looping instead of using A and D to strafe around items? I always feel like survivors are faster than me.
---
Tunneling just Makes the game boring for survivors and honnestly it's pretty sad that killers have to go as far as saying it's normal to tunnel
---
Beautiful.
---
*Masked breathing intensifies*
---
r/unexpectedtf2
---
School shooter OP spotted
---
I'm pretty sure you just start a KYF lobby, choose to play killer than have a friend start a SWF lobby to which they send you an invite. You accept the invite while having killer selected in the KYF friends lobby, and bam glitch.
---
Balanced Landing Loop
---
how is it not he can catch up to survivors quicker by slowing them down not as fast as billy or nurse.
---
if you throw a bottle on a downed survivor with d strike you can slow them down after eating up ds also he can force people into meduim vaults if the gas hits the survivor before a vault and get a hit i really dont understand how this isnt applicable?
---
I do it all the time as Wraith, I body block pallets.
---
Why do you use self care in SWF?
---
Who cares, itll probably be more fun than anything else this game has to offer at the time
---
Trust me I know.
---
Dude quit being a damn troll. The dude was just asking a question. GTFO of here with that salty shit.
---
Here in Germany you can get beer for almost no money. Even the cheap ones taste good.
---
Did you not read what I said dude? "Depending on the circumstances and how it is being done" If you're a killer and body blocking them in the basement or in a corner for periods of time that is body blocking by the definition.
---
That was the goal behind it. I'm glad you like it!
---
I feel the same way. Watching hybrid panda stream/vids make me so upset sometimes, he will crouch next to or do a totem/gen next to a hooked survivor because it’s “too soon” to unhook them even though the killer is on the other side of the map. He’s still my fav streamer to watch tho, such an awesome dude.
---
LOOK AT THAT LIL FUCKIN BEAN NEXT TO HIM, SO FUCKING CUTE
---
How much euros for a beer?
---
Clown is boring because he has a really mundane way of playing for both sides involved. Frankly, Clown is the killer most catered to lazy, auto-pilot play in my opinion. Just throw a flask to shorten a loop and call it a day. I want the experience to be better than that. So making the effect of his power less and less potent the farther from the center they are but more powerful than its current state if the killer lands the center on you (or hits you with the flask) would be a nice change.
---
Did 3 gens, escaped legion twice, made 3 hook saves (1 was unsafe), broke all of the totems and opened 1 door. Escaped.....black pip.
---
2 hooked 1 guy, killed 3, hit all but maybe 2 chainsaws, 2 gens left.....no pip.
---
Scoring in this game is borked. It bases everything off of things that you have little or no control over. Makes no sense.
---
Moris are fine, the only thing id change is making ATLEAST 2 hooks required before a kill. They are so detrimental to your score its not even worth using.
---
Add ons are also fine, save maybe prayer beads.
---
This is all my opinion. I need this  sub to reaaaally remember that.
---
The new dresses for Kate and Claudette better come out tomorrow
---
Oh 100% agreed.  Insidious is so niche it's ridiculous.  But when I do see it and it is rare it's usually on a Bubba.  I will say though most of the Bubbas I've been playing in general lately haven't been camping. I've fought so very good ones recently.  Hope the trend continues.
---
Around 4 euros for 6 good beers.
---
Does anyone have this format blank
---
OP needs to go to Germany to get plastered with his 7 bucks
---
Ohhh, I didn't know that, that would make sense, yeah. Both option #2 and #3 seem like a possibility. Thanks!
---
huntress lullaby in A tier OMEGALUL. A totem that can be broken, starts with no power other than a bit of extra regression if the survivors fail a skillcheck and even when fully stacked can be rendered useless. Please - lullaby is garbage tier.
---
I did. 
---
My point is just that body blocking is not the bannable offense. It is just semantics though. Holding the game hostage is what is bannable. Body blocking is usually used to do it but not always. 
---
It is like saying driving your car is illegal while only going above the speedlimit is whats illegal.
---
All memes aside I actually really love playing him. I played him the whole time I was getting level 35 for BBQ and chilli teachable, and it's just so satisfying to cut down SWF rescue groups.
---
I'm not trying to insult survivor mains, but I think there's a mistaken perception that space is a safety button. Lag is definitely a factor, but I genuinely don't think it's lag when most people complain. I think it's a mistake they're making because they aren't looking at the animations and hitboxes, they're thinking about their inputs. "I hit the button in time and things have gone horribly wrong. This feels unfair."
---
The pallet throw has a wind-up animation. There's a part of the animation when your character "slides" into place on their side of the pallet, then reaches up to grab the pallet. We can hit you underneath a pallet during that part of the animation because that part of the animation doesn't stun. Then, because killers can't actually interrupt your animations by hitting you (except unhooking/healing/a few others), your character finishes throwing the pallet and then either gets hit/goes down. And that feels kinda BS, right? You hit space before you took damage, your character used the pallet and got nothing from it. But it's just timing. If you threw the pallet earlier, you'd have got us. You just let us get too close / didn't have enough distance to make it through AND throw the pallet in time.
---
There are survivors that can consistently stun me at every pallet. I can usually tell from the first pallet or two they drop, because it feels like they're slamming the silly things down on my tippy toes. It's so early, so ridiculously early I can barely believe it stuns at all. I know I'm never going to get hits on those players at pallets. And it's clearly a skill thing, it's just something they learned to do by watching the pallets and thinking about what they needed to do to get the most of them.
---
And think about how really good killers use spirit fury to get a fast second hit - instead of tapping you before you get to the pallet and watching you hit sprint away, they'll hug your back as you go underneath it, then m1 you as you reach for the pallet. They're deliberately waiting for you to lock yourself into the animation so you waste a bunch of your hitsprint (and so the stun will cancel their blade wipe animation). They understand that you can't stun them instantly, so they know they're safe waiting until you have the prompt.
---
Vaults are similar. You're not actually safe when the vault finishes. The vault leaves you close enough to the window that you're still inside my attack hitbox. It's just a window, not a forcefield, so if I swing the game's gonna draw my hitbox and you're gonna be in it and there's not going to be anything in the way except a tiny waist high wall. You don't just need enough time to finish the vault, you need enough time to take a step away from the window. And I do mean away, don't run perpendicular to the window after vaulting it. This happens a lot at shack and long walls, because once you vault shack/longwalls the next thing to do is turn left or right, right? But if the killer is right on your ass you don't wanna do that, you wanna maximize distance in case they lunged, so just let your character take a step forward before turning and continuing the loop. It's an edge case, but it's once that'll save you from a hit every now and then.
---
In fact, right now, medium vault hitboxes appear to be broken in a way that can make survivors almost impossible to hit DURING the medium vault, so that it's actually easier to hit you once your feet are on the other side and you have a normal hitbox again. This is really noticeable with Billy's chainsaw. I think there were some clips that got upvoted here awhile back showing Billy's chainsaw bouncing off the will even with the survivor's butt still hanging out the window. And then Billy's chainsaw landing perfectly once they were on the other side. Looks really goofy.
---
Lag definitely happens and fucks people over, but more than anything I think it's an expectation that input = safety. The spacebar isn't the safety button; it just starts some animations, and those animations have their own weird properties. Pay really close attention to the animations to learn how to get the most out of pallets and vaults. I think you'll find the game is a lot less bullshit on average (as long as you dodge the games where BHVR puts you with a killer on another continent to whom you have like 300-400 ping).
---
I think the change was that totems no longer spawn within survivors' LoS at the start of the round.
---
That totem was slightly hidden behind tires. Cheeky little devs.
---
absolutely. and once you get someone in the basement, the round is basically over
---
Hmmm, this is nerfing him. I'm sorry but most people aleady think Legion is a weak killer anyway. Legion ablity is built to find survivors not down them. So here's my suggestion. 
---
1. When in Feral Frenzy mode all survivors who are in your terror radius aura is reveled to you.
---
2.  Survivors who are hit twice while in Feral Frenzy have the Broken status effect applied to them.
---
Was playing freddy, and downed someone in dream state just as they blew up a gen, and they were stuck in the physical state and I couldn't dream them while they were slugged. Is this a bug or intentional?
---
Honestly, it's fine on one person as-is. It shouldn't affect an obsession and non-obsession equally, though.
---
Huntress can ignore most loops. She makes killer shack irrelevant, vaults and pallets are always answered by throwing a hatchet.
---
You’ve left out something or are just lying for upvotes. Ive had a game where I got a 2k with LF and still pipped. Rank 13.
---
Somebody call Dr. Loomis. I think I just read something even more evil than Michael.
---
That’s not really helpful
---
Not enough. Right now just loss of BP and losing two pips.
---
They actually could have gotten him out. When someone is down right next to the exit and you are near you should start healing them. Killer can’t pick him up while you are healing, he have to hit you, you’ll fall out in the exit and downed person can crawl out while killer is on hit cooldown animation.
---
Is witch hunting on Twitch a bannable offense? Say a DbD streamer didn't like the way I played as as killer, and thought I tunneled a little too much. After the game, if he incites people to "memorize my name", and then shows my username and pastes my steam ID in his Twitch chat, is that a bannable offense? If so, how should one go about reporting that?
---
Will there ever be hope that i can play with a friend after 8 pm in consoles? Right now its just not possible with those queue times
---
You lose 2 rank pips (need 4 to rank up)  and you forfeit all the blood points you've earned during the trial.
---
&gt; should be cussed out afterwards
---
I don't agree. It's a game. No one needs to cuss anyone out. Frustration is part of conflict, but it doesn't need to get to the degree of being unnecessarily rude/toxic.
---
As /u/agesboy has said, just because you grow up super used to toxicity doesn't make toxic behavior any less toxic.
---
Youd be surprised actually, I've had quite a few games where the killer took the bait. Although I'd like to say that I actually main killer and the killer is never "tricked" by it, generally if they take the bait it's to get you to shut the fuck up.
---
I wish Sony would let you change your name.
---
Agree with pretty much everything you said. The Ebony mori is so bad as implemented, though. The fact that it’s bad for Killer and Survivor experience is damning. It’s no fun for Survs, and the killer usually black pips at best if they use it. It should def require 2 hooks first.
---
I played Plague on this map. What a nightmare.
---
I honestly don’t think it’s that bad. Im rank 5 and had a game where I double pipped and maxed every category while being the only one to escape. I think they should reward you more for keeping the killer occupied cause it is true if you get chased the whole game you won’t pip or get barely any points even tho ur doing the heavy lifting
---
Expected troll, got schooled.
---
Well played.
---
Considering that they haven't even been able to balance 1v4 after all these years, BHVR trying to implement 2v8 would be a complete fustercluck.
---
Why not? Literally the only counter to her. If you are injured and you don’t have Iron Will, no matter what you do you’re fucked.
---
You start to see the illusions at Madness 2. The Doctor can tell your location if he sees an illusion. At Madness 3, the Doctor sees the illusion as an aura, letting him track your location from anywhere on the map. One of his best add ons, Restraint, extends the duration of these illusions and allows him to see them as auras while you’re in Madness 2. And since you can not revert back to Madness 1 from Madness 2, it essentially allows the Doc to keep track of your location for the entire game.
---
This is actually oddly cute.
---
I just started playing this weekend, but I made an observation about this in my 50 or so rounds thus far. (I'm on Xbox) When I'm the killer, and waiting for people, it tends to throw less than 4 survivors in the lobby at first. If I ready up (as the killer) before there's 4 survivors, it takes a considerably longer amount of time for it to fill the slots. I "unready" and they're filled in seconds. Contrarily, if I'm a survivor in a non-full lobby with the killer ready'd up, I'll leave after 30 seconds or so because it can take ridiculously long.
---
Probably just coincidence, but there's something for you to look into :)
---
Guess it was a bug then, thanks.
---
1 million in the bank, 3 high-reward daily rituals untouched, BBQ and any good farming killer, bloody party streamers or survivor pudding to boot, spend a whole day grinding out those bloodpoints the best you can. It won't be easy but it's feasible. On top of that you can spend shards in the shrine of secrets to get bloodpoints but I wouldn't recommend that.
---
Seems pragmatic to me since your making sure the trap kills them
---
You can only mindgame when you are full health. Iron Will is also overall a good perk against all killers.
---
Why not? It's incredible software and dirt cheap. It gets frequent updates and the developer is very open to user feedback. By all means, buy it.
---
You can easily mindgame when injured what?
---
If the killer is deaf, yeah.
---
Imagine recognizing a troll and still feeding into it. Imagine.
---
I like them both.
---
Poeple shit on noed simply because it’s a really strong perk, and they can’t accept that. In my opinion is fine, as it is required for some newbies to actually have a chance to not be completely destroyed against experienced players. But what can you do if those toxic people are like this ƪ(˘⌣˘)ʃ
---
Well you must suck at mindgames, it’s easy to do... you don’t have to be standing next to the killer for the mindgame to work
---
Depiping. This game can’t be played casually as killer. Maybe survivor but only on swf. Otherwise you are stressing about your potato teammates (In fact, almost every survivor I talk to says they have potato teammates. That speaks wonders about you doesn’t it?) or you have to focus on looping. For killer you have to actively be aware of your surroundings and focus on everything. I’m not saying it’s bad that there is no real casual mode except for kyf, just saying that it causes a lot more toxicity. Games with a “toxic” community are competitive multiplayer. For example, Rust and For Honor. These games have no casual mode so people do anything they can to survive/win. This includes but not limited to, spawn camping, killing fresh players, legging, griefing, and much *much* more. Dbd is a competitive game and therefore toxic. How many single player games have a toxic fan base? When did you hear about people who played This War of Mine doing ANYTHING we do?
---
Nope. Sprint burst was the most popular before exhaustion existed (and it was technically the only one) as it just worked on a cooldown and could just use it over and over again in a chase. Then when balanced came along it had its own cooldown so it could be used in tandem with sprint burst which is what caused exhaustion to be introduced into the game in patch 1.5.0, but at this time exhaustion would recover while sprinting at double the time it would normally take (40s to 80s). A few patches later exhaustion would become what it is now which is when balanced (and to a certain extent dead hard) took over for sprint burst.
---
If you say so.
---
yeah , freddy is really fun for ranks 15-20 . Also wraith .
---
Just like Amanda rigged the trap of the woman in the 4th Saw film. You did good hehe, just like the real pig would do
---
Leather face. Always use BBQ and Chilli. Getting blood points will be super easy
---
It’s spiteful and a little petty in my eyes but whatever works I guess.
---
I was thinking of that, being in tune with how she rigged up the unwinnable games
---
Low rank killers are the worst though. They believe camping is the only way to win.
---
Out of the default killers, trapper is very easy to pickup. His power is very straightforward, only issue is hes not very good. But at the low ranks it really shouldnt be too much of an issue. Hillbilly and Nurse are very strong but are harder to learn, Nurse more so.
---
I actually checked if this is real
---
Anything is OP against complete idiots like that lol
---
Wraith is an easy one. You cloak to go fast, get a speed boost when you uncloak, and you can sneak up on people. It's pretty straight forward, you can't do it wrong.
---
Other than wraith, I would also recommend leatherface. He's very simple, not hard to control or anything.
---
Yeah low rank killers can be unfun. I’m just reminiscing with my (probably rose tinted) memory of just running around with no idea of what meta is. Lol
---
Legion counters MoM. While in Deep wound status effect MoM does not activate.
---
That Ash got what he deserved. Anybody who doesn't leave just to stay and mock the killer and then gets got has no room to complain about anything.
---
I don’t understand the debate lol urban evasion is obviously a good perk and we all know that so let’s stop talking about that. The problem is all the baby survivors using it. I can have way more points than someone using urban immersion and die my first hook because my other teammate is getting chased while the baby is crouching on the edge of the map and of course they will escape and I will not because the killer will never find them with how slow they play the game.  It’s so frustrating like the only way to play around this is to play just as immersed as they are playing which will end up in such a drawn out hatch game
---
They’d have to optimize console as good as pc if that were to happen. One of the best killers Nurse, is not that great on console due to low frame rate.
---
That’s how you look when I have exhaustion on my bottle
---
Really? I live in England, and haven't heard of a rash of "school stabbings".
---
Look, I get it. You watch Fox News. Your pile of dead children is a lot larger than ours, and that makes you feel bad, so you have to say "well in England there's statistically more knife crime" and then not look any deeper than that, or at things like death rates. But don't just make shit up.
---
I found something that works: do 3 safe unhooks, do 2-3 gens by yourself or with someone, just be sure to do them from start to finish, try to escape (if you get downed less than 3 times and escape u get gold unbroken) and then try to win quick chases against the killer, but this is hard and not required. U should usually get iridescent lightbringer and altruism, with gold (or maybe iridescent) unbroken and at least silver in chases. Prioritise gens over chases, and unhook before your teammates, BE SURE TO DO SAFE UNHOOKS, and get those sweet points. It may sound hard but it is doable, good luck
---
He does have VOD turned on, I think. At least I could make a "clip" of said moment. So dumb question #2: where should I go to submit the ticket? I remember the old report forms, but I'm not entirely sure what tickets are comprised of.
---
Holy fuck. I’m tired of people saying pallets and windows in this argument. Look at how think the wall is. It’s literally like the size of your thumb. I can expect a for a 2 foot long incense burner/machete/sword/club/skull/chainsaw/other chainsaw to hit past that point. Maybe not the various knives but those killers still have arms. I understand hit boxes are bugged but most of the time you are hit on a pallet or window it was fine.
---
I had a game as LF where the swf would keep rescuing a guy immediately after I hooked him. Like I would not take more than 5 steps away from the hook before they rescue. It was really fun mowing them all down.
---
I seen someone saying switching from survivor to killer when the game is counting down. They said that's how you do it with kill your friends, but rarely happens in ranked. I would like to know exactly how myself. Hopefully this wonderful community could share the wisdom.
---
All of those flying rats are snitches
---
LMAO so basically u like to watch ppl suffer? Good to know xD
---
I expected a DS against you
---
I actually kindof like that idea, but I would say just having a survivor within the radius would negate it.  If there's survivor(s) around circling the hook, the smart choice is for the killer to try to find them instead of buggering off to the other end of the map.  
---
We already got the bp loss for the killer being within a radius around the killer, no need to stack it even more.  There's already punishment for a killer tryingto defend a hook that a survivor is circling.  We need to balance those killers being d-bags by hard camping because and those who are making smart plays.
---
Every game involving going to a certain area and is multiplayer.
---
Dead By Daylight, camp hook.
---
Identity V, camp chair.
---
Cops and Robbers (any version/edition), camp the escape route.
---
What is the little brain on the right of the screen? It looks like it has a meter counting down but often never moves.
---
More fun than trying to pip in the current environment.  Let the people have their fun.
---
Probably has half a brain. Can’t try to comprehend stupidity.
---
Sweet legion gameplay
---
NOED seem to be the only perk survivors complain about but they have all these op perks like BT, Dead Hard, DS, and MoM (which counters NOED if the person is injured). So they really dont have room to complain.
---
I think you don't know what competitive means. For a game to be competitive it has to be balanced. An asymetrical multiplayer by definition can't be competitive because it can't be balanced. For Honor is also not competitive because it has terrible balance problems, the first tournament was a shitshow. The only games that are competitive are fighting games, FPS and sport games because the two sides of the game can be balanced making skill somewhat the deciding factor.
---
This game can't be played casually? Your terms are a bit off, what do you mean by "casually"? You mean without purple add ons, etc?
---
yeah, i kind of wish they had two different types of lobbies, casual and ranked. but i doubt that would turn out well.
---
It is. You as a survivor tunnel generators for the same reasons killers tunnel survivors. You don't go around and 99% each gen instead of popping them ASAP, do you?
---
All four of legion together in one shot. That must be a mistake, no can do.
---
Love the series!
---
Madness meter, which is only used with the Doctor as the killer.  It fills up when you're within his terror radius and he has his aura ability or hits you with his shocking attack, and goes down when you're outside of his terror radius.
---
I think it’s the fact that it’s both a one shot and a speed boost. If it were one or the other I doubt as many people would complain about it.
---
Best, non Doctor build to farm up BP with?
---
Told people it was gonna happen...what did they expect me not to call out the fog whisper who purposely de-ranked(bannable offense by the way) to bully killers and they want her to be a tutorial? watch people who dont cheat the system or at least make it less obvious. And if y'all know Jen tell her i called her out!
---
Survivors have moved on to complaining about Ruin and bbq as well. Which is interesting considering what you said that they have perks like adrenaline and definitely MoM that are strong and frequently used in the same way...
---
i think there's an implication that you'll get banned for doing so.
---
but i would also like to know this power.
---
I'm okay with NOED, both as killer and survivor, as long as the killer is good and uses that perk as any other perk and not to get a cheap kill end-game. Half of the killers can't even get a kill without it
---
Thank you sir! I guess it’s just a game of figuring out what survivors are trying to do, and figuring out the maps.
---
&gt; 11k BP's I think, which tbh is too much imo
---
That's extremely low. It's almost impossible for a killer to get any less
---
-J
---
Object Class: Safe
---
Special Containment Procedures: SCP-789-J is kept in my toilet and only i can talk to it
---
Description: SCP-789-J is a ghost that is a face. it lives in a toilet and it talks to you while you poop. then when you poop it goes "no stop aaaa-" and then stops because there is poop in its mouth.
---
SCP-789-J travels around in butts. you can only get rid of it by wiping. that is the moral of the story.
---
sometimes it kills other butts and makes them butt ghosts too. but it is always lonely because it is a butt ghost.
---
Addendum: if you fall in the toilet, it eats your butt.
---
There is No Escape.
---
What an ass
---
Positivity is a big thing for me, I can't watch streamers like Tru3, I just find he complains alot. 
---
I really like puppers, super positive and you can tell he cares about his viewers. He actually engages with the twitch chat too which is nice.
---
I swear Dwight mains are spies. They do run Bond, after all.
---
YES
---
I promise you I am not lying or leaving things out
---
me 2, thats why i stopped a little when I grabbeg him... lol
---
His weakness is his chases.  If you get good at the loops, being able to read the 'tiles' (terrain blocks that are put down randomly) at a glance, and mind games, he struggles because his power doesn't help with it.
---
You know, this could be avoided if you stopped dcing and suciding on hook to be a higher rank ... but I guess rank doesn't matter ...
---
Oh no i get you, just thought it was kinda harsh lol.
---
Fr tho like how, I’m tryin to fuck with my friends
---
Puppers is the best dbd streamer, imo! I like that he even compliments killers when they figure out his jukes or get a good hit on him. I've never seen him become intentionally or maliciously toxic when he plays, he listens to and chats with his audience, and he's just very positive overall. I definitely prefer watching him over people that are mean in both gameplay and verbally to killers/survivors :)
---
....correct. but not a meme and also not me. I thought it was a funny coincidence i saw on console. chill bud
---
How about starting a match against Leatherface. He finds me immediately. I loop him for hex ruin and 2 gens. Finally I go down. He hooks me in the basement and proceeds to camp. I get unhooked he DC's... Depip. This game really penalizes you. I never DC and have multiple games a day where its 3v1 or 2v1. But to have the killer DC and you depip....
---
The controls are drastically different between the two.  The amount of time that it takes a killer to 180 is insane on consoles compared to PC.
---
Why are people downvoting this? Im not taking credit for it
---
I am now the juke master
---
If you want to remove Moris which I am fine with, then remove toolboxs as well. The games already go insanely fast even with killer gen slow-down perks . A toolbox is the equivalent of a survivor mori, speeding threw their objectives while a mori speeds a killers objectives as well as punishing both side for points. 
---
Also your remove killer ultra rare add on is a joke.. surv main confirmed.
---
Yeah, but on PC they'll do a lot of crazy shit. I once got kicked from a lobby because BHVR couldn't verify that I wasn't a bot because I had a one line name.
---
Thanks. Now I have to binge-watch STBlackST's animations again.
---
Can I say that the middle perk is like the coolest perk/perk idea I have ever seen and I love the idea, but does the symbol for your status on the hud get delayed as well?
---
It wasn't actually 'deserved' though, I think.
---
Imagine the terror of getting shocked when you're not within his terror radius.
---
&gt; The lack of uniforms 
---
I know uniforms in schools are things but are they really considered the norm in  england?
---
The new ranking system forces you to compete (against your fellow survivors) for the limited points available in the match in each category. If you completed 3-ish gens by yourself, the system forces you to stop doing gens if you want to rank up even if no one else is doing gens since you won't get any more points in Lightbringer. To fix this, they need to change the scaling and/or remove the point cap so survivors can actually work together to try to escape (the point of being survivor) instead of fight each other for rank.
---
But then again, why does rank matter when there are no rewards and is used only as an MMR?
---
I believe we've been in a game together recently, based on your behavior, you don't deserve the de-pips.
---
noed gives a speedbuff and insta down to shitty killers who can't accomplish anything at any other point in the game
---
Sometimes it’s nessasary if it’s a swf all looping the killer at the hook when someone’s hooked like he sees them and what’s he supposed to do? Let them unhook?
---
That was the intended effect, yes. I should have made that clearer in the description. As it is, its been misinterpreted many times!
---
I’m a New Yorker and I don’t have a statistic or anything but all the brits I’ve met online wear uniforms. So uh, Maybe?
---
Yeah, she was the only killer who it wasn't immediately clear who they were based on. The others are either licensed characters, based on one, or have obvious inspirations. 'The Whore' is the closest figure/story/lore that I could find for 'The Plague'.
---
You can also be the obsession without any perks if the killer is running perk tied to obession (dying light, rancor, play with your food etc.)
---
If they have a funny personality and know how to crack jokes even if they're being camped lmao
---
I'd read a suggestion like that before, and it was met with a 'ton' of salt from Killer mains. I do think it's odd that they give the players all of these perks to try and inhibit camping and people still camp anyway.
---
Why have BBQ and nurses calling if you're gonna stay in one spot after the hook? Why stay there at all if someone might be running Borrowed Time, or Mettle, or have the revamped DS? It's like the devs are screaming that camping is a bad idea, but it's still being done.
---
Killer main actually. Guess we disagree about Iridescent Head. 
---
But I agree the games are way too fast. I don’t think removing toolboxes are the answer; there are other gameplay changes I’d like to see that would be a better survivor experience. I think in general it should take longer to repair generators. It feels really punishing to play certain killers against strong survivors, mostly because they can just fly through gens.

why can't WGLF work like BBQ? every time you unhook a survivor and the killer is farther than 40m from the hook, both of you can see his/her aura for 4 seconds.
---
bUt LeGiOn Is BaLlAnCeD
---
I edited it before you replied to me because I thought better of, it wasn't some elaborate plot to frame you.
---
No it’s been like this always? It even says in loading screens sometimes that killers can do it. That’s why it’s better to go through the hatch while they’re in recovery from hitting.
---
Now all I can think of is Legion taking off his mask and revealing that he was actually that weaselly little shit Nevel the entire time, and telling Meg that she would “Rue the day!” that she denied him his pip by running Borrowed Time.
---
I've come up against a few groups of survivors that insist upon staying fully infected and rushing gens until all gens are completed before they use the fountains. This strategy of theirs is surprisingly effective and annoying, but I found a way to counter the strategy simply by using Thanatophobia. When all 4 survivors become broken they add 12 seconds to gen repairs, so paring it Ruin, and Pop goes the weasel really takes it toll on them. Any survivors attempting this strategy quickly find they have to abandon it because staying broken is not only giving you 1 shot downs but also slowing their repair speeds, and that's where the purple tablet comes into play if you want to be really nasty. You force them to use fountains with thana, and you gain your corrupt purge quickly and often, typically during a chase. This build turns Corrupt purge into a main focus for you, but you stay away from using it unless the survivor you're chasing takes you by a corrupt fountain, or if there's one close by after a hook. 
---
So to sum this up, if you are running across groups of survivors who don't use the fountains until endgame and just gen rush as their strategy, put Thanatophobia in to counter them, and you can even add more add-ons and perks to maximize your corrupt purge potential. Turns out they really hate this.
---
Never saw a picture that accurate. Get your updoot.
---
No, she's THICC
---
I might get crucified here but Legion with BBQ and going for a lot of chases and frenzy hits will get you an insane amount of BP.
---
oohh
---
Played against hag yesterday. He hooked a survivor after the 1st gen. I head over to unhook him and get chased by hag but they break off once im a good distance from the hook. All 3 of us tried to lure hag away but they wouldnt break far enough for a safe hook. Additionally this is solo queue so Im not on comms with them. So this survivor died on hook. Then he camped the 2nd survivor to be hooked. Each time never chasing me further then safe hook distance. After the game I asked why they camped so hard. Their response.. "What am I just suppost to let you unhook them?" I said why are you breaking chase to defend the hook. He argued that you cant let a survivor off the hook thats how you play.
---
Survivors have a smaller hitbox allowing them to loop closer to obstacles, so it's important to turn as tightly as you can. As for whether to use W or A and D, that's up to what feels most effective for you. Keep in mind that Doctor moves slower while in treatment (shock) mode.
---
I just started playing, but wow, that's absolutely terrible. Regardless of what the game says that should absolutely not be in the game, and anyone I come across that's doing that will be reported by myself, ten of my others accounts, and everyone I can get on my friends list to do it.
---
Again, that's just circlejerking BS with no substance.  The whole notion that NOED means the killer is complete garbage and "didn't accomplish anything" is just being an ass.  What if they've managed to just get one person dead before the last gen?  How about if everyone or almost everyone has been hooked twice?  How about if everyone's on separate gens and they just get done too fast?  How would any of those scenarios mean the killer was bad?
---
It's because it's a crutch perk, just like DS was. I mainly play killer and don't use NOED. If youre playing a late game, exit gate type build, then noed fits that and that's fine. But most killers I see use it in standard meta builds. If you use it in a standard build, youre just saying that you aren't confident in your mid game skills and you need the perk to try and garunteed the last kill when gates are open.
---
When you have noed active and someone on hook, what are you doing? Are you patrolling between gates or are you camping/proxy the hook? If youre camping the hook, you're using it as a crutch and I'm willing to bet most people using it are doing that.
---
obvious troll
---
According to the Devs, disconnecting more than 30% of the matches you play will result in a permanent ban, but that is the only consequence. Hopefully more disconnect penalties are added soon, and I wouldn't be surprised if that happens.
---
Circle jerking this lie doesn't help with getting the situation fixed. The tournament revealed the best killer tactic very clearly: Play nurse and hard camp first hook to elimate one player asap.
---
But my point is
---
There is litreal no downside of using it, like you're getting the best, a one shot free for you!
---
Get hooked once and boom it gets activated, at average ranks you get hooked before the first gens are popped, my point is if you're good then you're probably fcking the killer in a huge way in the end game.
---
It's like why people cried over DS, I know it's different than it but can we get perks for surviors which doesn't help surviors on their misplay
---
Thanks
---
Body Blocking is a tatic that killers use. Wraith for example. Its only bannable when you use it to take hostage of the game. For example 2 or 3 survivors are in the basement and you block the stairs for a length of time. Your fine. Survivors needs to stop being so salty when they misplay
---
The pig doesn't look like Shawnee Smith, the devs just made up some default face, so she doesn't really have anything to do with DbD , unlike

Ain’t it the seven you spam switch the roles until ether you have 5 survivors or 2 killers? At least in kyf it is
---
Don't you just press escape? I think so, but could be wrong :D
---
They are working on the load in bug currently, and have fixed one cause for it in the last patch. There have been numerous other issues that people doubted would ever be fixed, and eventually they were, so I'm sure it'll happen eventually. As for events, who can know?
---
Somebody should do this with all 4 legion skins

So I stream and I don't use a "t.tv" username, but every time I am *actively streaming* and see a t.tv name my first thought is "oh God, fuckin streamers" lol

Had this happen  yesterday. Leatherface DC'd after he chased me for 2 gens and hex ruin. I depip. I have to ask myself what more could I have done just to hit the safety pip. Im chased 20 seconds into the game. Did a pretty good job looping and being chased only to be penalized after the killer DCs
---
Bug
---
Hey, I'm new to the game, what pip means?
---
There are pictures of the pig without the mask and it's just some made up face that doesn't look anything like this woman. The devs didn't get rights to use her face so even if there will be maskless pig skin it wouldn't be the woman in those pics.
---
I think you're looking at it wrong, NOED doesn't reward killers for playing poorly, it punishes survivors for cutting corners and trying to rush their opponent out of the match. It's obviously a rubber-band mechanic for some killers, especially the ones who didn't pressure gens right, but it has the same benefit for 'bad' killers as it does for 'good' ones, the killer's skill has no bearing on whether NOED's effectiveness. Trash killers, MLG players, NOED works the same way and conveys the same benefit every time. 
---
I think a lot of the resentment over it would fade if more players stopped seeing the activation of five generators as 'completing the objective'; No doubt that getting one-shotted is frustrating, but part of the reason IMO that a lot of survivors consider it cheap is because they considered their victory as a forgone conclusion up to that point, and feel like it was taken from them at the finish line.
---
Uh, when exactly? I have been in so many games lately, I can barely remember people. Also, you do realize multiple people on Steam can have the same name right?
---
I would not expect it any time within the next few years, but some day maybe.
---
Man who plays d&amp;d without rp. That sounds horrible lmao
---
Tried pointing this out before and got downvoted. MoM is aids when a whole SWF is running it.
---
I've only recently started playing this game but I caught a jendenise stream last night/this morning and learned a heck of a lot. Those loops are good.
---
I prefer leader for opening exit gates. Sure, somebody else has to do it, but it usually works out. Them gates FLY open!
---
BHVR is almost certainly still working on it, but they haven't found an option that they are happy with making public. There is no date for when it will be ready, we just have to wait until they find an option they're happy with unfortunately.

I don't see why a meta build is a problem, in any game there's always going to be some perk or addon or power that's good and some that aren't, whether in general or good for this guy/bad for that one, any PvP game is going to have some sort of meta.  How many survivors run very similar perks all the time, other than pre-nerf DS I don't see the same general "bleh you're just using meta perks" for stuff like Adrenaline or Dead Hard like I usually hear for running Ruin or BBQ.  
---
Personally, I try to leave hooked survivors unless I saw someone or scratchmarks, but when you're at the end of the game, you really can't wander far once you know the gates are open, you're essentially just giving away the kill.  When it's a rough game, you're either a camping tryhard with 1 kill, or an idiot babykiller with 0 kills, and either way you're going to get harassed in post chat.
---
Pretty good overall, maybe try syncing hits/hooks to match the rhythm
---
I don’t know but maybe you should stream and show us your tricks.
---
I mean, I main Killer and I think Killers also get a ton of information they shouldn't reasonably be able to get either that completely kills stealth game play making quite a few perks useless.
---
Me when I'm not running fast enough from the killer
---
Lol I actually just had a game with a completely useless fuckin teammate. I was doing my thing, baiting the killer and running him around hoping that the team would finish the gens. David joins me and we keep the killer's attention and gens were getting done but at a slower rate than I anticipated. Come to find out Meg was alone doing gens while the P2 Claudette was doing jack shit. I caught her hiding in a corner waiting until we all died so she could get the hatch. 
---
1 gen left, David and Meg are both dead. There was no way in hell I was gonna have them die in vain. Luckily Claudette was too stupid not to stay idle for too long so she gathered crows and there was a trap near her so I set it off and dipped. The killer found her and hooked her and I made sure she saw me teabag as I let her die. 
---
I got the hatch 
---
Justice was served~
---
&gt;If you aren't a hyper mobile killer like Billy or Nurse, you just aren't going to have that kind of heavy map pressure unless you got lucky and get a survivor hooked really quickly after the game starts.
---
This is the mentality of a bad killer, and that's why people don't like noed. You're saying youre not good enough to get kills early on so you need noed to supplement that lack of skill.
---
Flashlights aren't that good anymore
---
Laurie is a licenced character. BHVR isn't allowed to. 
---
Same goes for Leatherface, Michael etc.
---
Console faces poorer performance, and are forced to use controllers. Different strategies work on each platform, and crossplay would likely lead to one platform's players having an advantage over the others.
---
The most probable reason however, is simply that it isn't built to support it, and BHVR don't want to spend the resources on it currently.
---
Self Care, Lithe, premonition, and mettle of man is a fun and strong build. But of those I’d say Self Care is mandatory
---
It’s a baby huntress! I’m sure she’ll get taller overtime, they all do.
---
It all makes sense now lol thanks
---
Trust me no one wants to play on that map, not even survivors...
---
You'll get better! My advice would be to NOT be afraid of getting stunned by pallets, to try and avoid the same path twice, and to abandon a chase if they're doing a loop you're not good at yet.
---
What survivor were you playing?
---
I feel like they should at least consider it once they bring dedicated servers. At that point, I think they should branch out of the 1v4 only and give the game some variety.
---
I think this is a fair assessment, the speed boost feels very tacked on.  I see what they're going for with the flavor of it, "you can't escape death" and all, but just being an unconditional one-shot would be enough I think, the perk doesn't also need the 2%/3%/4% speed boost.
---
He's very good if you can get survivors grouped up... how? Well, camping is one method XD But other methods can include that perk that tells you when two people are working on one gen, tracking perks, etc.

Fuck yo NoED
---
I thought it was using a fake finger to flip him off with then when he grabs it for a trophy a bunch of colored hanky’s stream out the bottom, maybe even a rabbit too. While he is laughing you run away (in a straight line).
---
&gt; SWF can combat NOED easily but soloqueues don't really have an effective way of ensuring the 5 totems are cleansed making it an almost near certainty that against randoms you can and will get that NOED proc and last ez down and kill either on whoever you're chasing at the end when the final gen pops OR simply catching someone as they attempt to open a door handle.
---
This meme that you need SWF to cleanse totems is so ridiculous. I almost only play solo and I usually crank out 3 totems on my own as I go about. 
---
But here's another thing:
---
Most survivors don't even try to cleanse totems ever, whether they are SWF or not.
---
I run Thrill a lot and I can tell you unequivocally that the vast majority of survivors don't even touch two totems in the entire match.
---
I'm gonna pluck out one part of your comment real quick before I finish up:
---
&gt; don't really have an effective way of ensuring the 5 totems are cleansed
---
And there never will be because the uncertainty is the point and that same uncertainty is what makes Devour Hope not a lump of trash.
---
Anyway, once I see that survivors, including SWF groups, actually start even trying to cleanse totems then I will possibly consider the arguments you guys make about how cleansing totems is not a viable counter. But not until that point. I'm not going to entertain the complaints of people not even trying.
---
I kinda want to see all 4 Legion members in one game now.
---
To me it's a clear display of cockiness and sometimes I'll "take the bait" in an effort to make them pay for their hubris.
---
Be glad you have Ruin; I'm using NOED as my game slowing perk and I get dumped on. Had a survivor shittalk me saying "So sick of low ranks, NOED everywhere" "NOED is a crutch" etc. Dude was pretty sick at juking me, so yes he /should/ have lived... But if you know NOED is abound, don't you think you'd take Small Game and actually go totem hunting?
---
You forgot "If you're not in a SWF, how are you supposed to know how many totems are left"
---
The honest truth is this. If there were a radius made where being near a hook meant the timer slowed or stopped, then Killer mains would just learn how to tell where that radius is and stay juuuuuuuuust outside of it.
---
The hag having shorter legs than normal, nice attention to detail!
---
My friend got 8 k points he piped I got 13 k in the same match and depiped
---
&gt;I don't see why a meta build is a problem, in any game there's always going to be some perk or addon or power that's good and some that aren't, whether in general or good for this guy/bad for that one, any PvP game is going to have some sort of meta.  How many survivors run very similar perks all the time, other than pre-nerf DS I don't see the same general "bleh you're just using meta perks" for stuff like Adrenaline or Dead Hard like I usually hear for running Ruin or BBQ.  
---
I'm not saying meta builds are bad. The current killer meta builds focus on mid game pressure and tracking. I can't think of any of my perks I would switch out for noed because they are all important. Adding noed to a standard mid game meta build is saying "I lose a lot and need help"
---
&gt;Personally, I try to leave hooked survivors unless I saw someone or scratchmarks, but when you're at the end of the game, you really can't wander far once you know the gates are open, you're essentially just giving away the kill.  When it's a rough game, you're either a camping tryhard with 1 kill, or an idiot babykiller with 0 kills, and either way you're going to get harassed in post chat.
---
That's the thing. If youre staying near the hook, which is perfectly acceptable, you dont need noed to protect it and if you do, that's where the crutch comes in. Youre better of using a perk that you benefit from during the earlier stages of the game.
---
P r o p o s t e r o u s
---
Gore makes achieving certain age ratings in different countries very difficult. China for instance really hates skeletons, any game with skeletons almost always needs to create a different version for China, or face getting a crazy age restriction, if it will be sold at all.
---
Mortal Kombat is devoted to gore, it's a core selling point. But for Dead by Daylight, they don't consider it worth the added difficulty with ratings and localization.
---
When your reward at the end is the single biggest possible buff to a killer short of a Mori you really aren't that shorthanded during the game.  Besides the 4th slot on every killer is pretty open anyways.  Usually that's that slot you could mess around with anyone of numerous different perks.
---
NOED is bad, but swf is fine, survivor logic.

Honestly, most of the killers I run NOED on are killers that I've just got nothing better to finish the loadout.  Yes NOED puts in work sometimes, while other times you swing and find out they got all your dull totems, which you can't really be mad about.  I'm just so tired of the whining and insults about trying to put together a loadout that will at least do something.  Since they buffed BBQ and Ruin to at least function at level 1 and 2, it's helped but I still lack worthwhile other perks to run on some of my killers.
---
I went from pipping most matches , to depipping nearly 14 straight.  Admittedly the old system was too easy but the emblem adjustments really seems to have killed me.
---
Your honest assessment of the game is the mentality of a bad killer. That's just my honest assessment. You can play killers other than nurse and Billy at high ranks and still be able to stall gens.
---
There’s a lot more to being good or bad than looking at who’s dead when the last generator goes on. Are the survivors a SWF, how many people have you hooked in the match, what items were brought in. You can’t look at a 30 second clip without the killer in it and determine if they’re bad or not.
---
unless the survivors incentivize it, which they do at least half the time.
---
It’s nice as an anti tunnel perk, im glad they increased the stun duration for it because 3 seconds was just too little. It’s just not going to be anything more than anti tunnel bc you only get to use it 60 seconds after a hook
---
I would have just ignored him tbh.
---
Rare look inside the Switch port of DBD coming 2019
---

---
At least tell me, can you do this alone or do you have to have someone with you to pull it off?
---
If it was Jane I was gonna make a joke saying she’s too thicc to fit in the map but ig not :(
---
Yup, I do it if I have to but I don't like doing it, boring af and those gens WILL start pinging.
---
I don't man, it just annoys me. :P  I agree with you obviously, it's just frustrating to see all the hate for using whatever perk.
---
why NOED is not in SS++ tier ???
---

---
You're right but honestly? I'm fine with that. Anti tunnel is good. Most of the current and new perks designs are centered around it, and for good reason imo. It's absolutely the least fun part of the game for survivors, bar holding m1 on gens for 5 minutes.
---
Because that is how they chose to design him.
---
My problem is that I was rank 12 and my friend was rank 13 and we got rank 20 David’s. It pissed me off that they did nothing the whole game but it pissed me off more that I was even paired with them.
---
Run, duck boy! RUUUUUUUUUUUUUN!
---
Run the killer perk that decreases your m1 cooldown
---
looping currently is nothing but a killers time waste and is not fun for them. and I'm saying this from a survivors perspective, remember when we didn't have to loop? we could use our perks to help us? y'know make it a fucking CHASE?
---
not lunging also counters dead hard.
---
he is actually faster? Isnt he 115?
---
Indeed
---
You have a window of time around 10% of the match to make up for the ground lost through running three perks, it's a nerfed Devour Hope that procs more reliably, but yeah I agree that the fourth slot is usually flexible to experiment or play around with. I'm not really in disagreement with the strength of the perk, when it activates, more likely we're in disagreement about the consequences it has on player behavior and the effect on average match length. I'm with BHVR on this one, that it's in a good spot with appropriate ways to mitigate, avoid or neutralize it. I wouldn't disagree with a totem counter though, but I wonder what the effect on match length would be if dull totems suddenly became less attractive to spend time cleansing.
---
Meta of Man lol
---
I wish I could stop this but it's every time right before they reach a pallet lol
---
They don't know how to balance obviously. A fast killer with a big aoe slow.hmm yeah, dumb devs!
---
Haha
---
He is the same speed as most of the killers in dead by daylight. [killer speeds](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Movement_Speeds)
---
&gt; i know leatherface is horrible at anything other than camping
---
Where
---
This guy gets it.
---
Except game balance in a 4 v 1 game does not work this way. It does not matter from a game balance perspective that it only helps that one individual player once. It can be used up to 4 times in one match
---
I do, and it’s always I’ve cleansed 4 totems then die to NOED. Always...
---
While this sounds incredible, and I would name my first born @Mcote_BHVR to get it, the only problem would be map size. The maps are just too small for 4 killers. It would have to be only 2.
---
well thats good i feel like people get so into the game and so salty that they forget to enjoy it sometimes
---
he had adrenaline he is fine now .
---
&gt; Always...
---
Incredibly remarkably doubtful
---
He’s a 115% killer
---
And what is the mentality of a *good* killer that has this omnipresent pressure at all times?  Because I fundamentally don't see how acknowledging killer limitations is admitting defeat.  Can you stall and dominate with non-top tier killers?  Of course, do you have Ruin and are the survivors bothered by it/destroy it right away?  They're just as relevant factors to how well/poorly you're going to do.
---
when will they add it to the game?
---
"We made it so that hex totems will spawn atleast 32 meters away from survivors, also being out of sight"
---
Also DBD:
---
Well how do you explain it? A 4K is a pip. If you killed all 4 you had enough for at least a pip.
---
Not if it's stream dad. He's pretty nice
---
wHy dO yOu hAtE fRiEnDsHiP??
---
I too would like to know alas I don’t anyone will actually share the knowledge even through a pm ;)
---
I’d like to see a br dbd, I think it would be actually fun
---
Yea and in that case it's fine, ignore the salty survivors. I run noed on my trapper because he's a lower level and all I have is just shit perks for him. I don't think the noed debate applies if you just don't have good enough alternative perks yet.
---
what head cosmetic is that jake wearing? his hair looks poofy
---
The Dead Hard complaints are crazy, I've never heard more bitching over a perk that's invalidated *just* by assuming they have it. If you're not lunging at every single attack then it's not an issue, 99% of survivors will proc it when you're in lunge range instead of waiting for you to be right ontop of them. So just....don't lunge
---
If they DID add this idea, my suggestion would be to have future perks where the advantage would be a big increase in this rage, or a small added bonus to a perk with a few different advantages. For example, a perk that would increase the speed of repairing, healing, hook sabotage, and opening exit gates, and increases the radius of this effect, a few meters wider for every tier of the perk.
---
Exactly, survivors only ever pull it off once against me. I usually quickly learn who I need to bait it out of. After that, it’s a waste of a perk slot.
---
Skinny legend, we have to stan
---
Prepare to be the most let down you've been in... like a few days. It's not the end of the world but it's not great
---
i think they should make it so if u take a hit and MoM triggers you should go into the broken status it really is a problem right now for m1 killers i got sick of it and started playing nurse because i dont want to deal with it
---
It's a meme my guy calm down
---
Yea idk, just too fast for being his size
---
Survivors like that just don't like it when you use a perk that will allow you to find and/or kill them
---
yes and I will
---
use boil over too
---
Okay? The game is working as intended then
---
the aura effect is pretty much useless
---
I can't because I don't have Technician unlocked yet so my teammates make me find totems and open chests. :(
---
Somebody please teach me how to do this before they patch it! (Just dm since its against rules to say on here :/) this looks like alot of fun
---
Careful son you may cut yourself with all that edge
---
I missed it at first too, don't feel bad
---
Oh god
---
agreed there is no downside i wish people would see how much of a problem it is atm ive run killers for 4 and 5 gens with the damnn thing im sure thats super fun for them
---
Lightweight for survivor, and Hex: Devour Hope for killer. Lightweight is criminally underrated due to how little survivors think about their scratch marks. Devour hope is situational but god damn getting the 5 tokens in the best feeling ever.
---
Anytime! :)
---
Especially considering most hatch standoffs I’ve had are with level 20s who haven’t quite got a full under standing on the game
---
The definition of competing is, “striving against one another to gain or win something.” Being asymmetrical doesn’t mean shit. I don’t play too much For Honor but enough to know it follows this definition. What I mean my casually is basically the ability to fuck around. Like for example you can *very* easily fuck around in Friday the 13th and maybe a better example, Fallout 3. Sure I could immerse myself into Fallout 3 but I much rather blow up megaton, have sex with as many people as possible, enslave people of all ages, murder an entire town with a nuclear catapult and the list goes on. What can you do in dbd as survivor? Well you can put on meme builds but most of them don’t change much with the exception of Object and No Mither. This and swf are the only ways to just play casually. In any other scenario you have to juggle between objectives,  potato teammates, chase/looping judgements, and general assumptions. A big reason for this is the small amount of survivors. For example, a massive game like Battlefield could allow you being useless but a game like Counter Strike wouldn’t. As for killer... there is nothing. As killer you have to outsmart 4 other real humans. There is no room for error at all, unlike survivor. Say I get hooked as survivor, I can still do a lot but if a killer loses a survivor they may have wasted valuable time. Survivors juggle objectives while killers juggle time. The ONLY way for both sides to play casually is kyf. I also forgot to mention addons and perks. Sometimes I can’t dick around as survivor simply because of addons. If the Spirit has Crystal Beads I’m on full alert. There are so many addons to list here but you get my point. Dead By Daylight is competitive. Maybe not tournaments but definitely as people we have to actively compete to win.
---
Can be done in kyf, I believe, if one of the survivors switches to killer as the timer is about to hit zero or something. Never tried it myself so I'm not entirely sure
---
*laughs in save the best for last*
---
Ignore them. Play the game the way you want to :D
---
people will abuse staying near the killer and even if they dont most of the time i see someone with the aura im chasing someone else or too far away for it to matter at all im not going to drop a chase and run half the map to come and get you thats not good time management
---
I like the design of this map just not playing on it.
---
NEAT!
---
they are rewarded by having survivors depip for playing well, it would be like if the killer depipped for killing 3 survivors then the 4th one dcs and the killer gets zero blood points
---
Played a KYF game where my friend was wraith on this map. It was a stressful experience to say the least

I actually have seen a decrease in the amount of Ruins, last month it used to be almost every game (~80%) now I find it closer to (~60%). This is probably rank related since I was rank 4 but am now 12. This makes me want to make an actual usage chart over ranks

I agree with this lol. Although, I honestly don't think they even have any effect on anything. Can report all of the DC'ers you want, and have never seen it make a difference.

With the new rank system they won’t go anywhere but down and won’t even safety pip when it comes to camping, I laugh when assholes sit and camp now and know before to long they will be at the bottom again!

Nah. Its been over a month since i played this game due to the bugs, queues, and toxicity, so no i won't just play the game.

Same here, been trying to figure it out for hours now.

Honestly I don’t care lol. Go to bed, you deserve it.

I do, indeed.

Shiiiit, if that was the case, we'd run out of memes before that time.

Just the amount of consecutive days that I have posted a meme reformat
---
ah yeah good point about the healing thing. maybe Poised if you have Jane? I swear by that perk.
---
100% correct on all.
---
This happened to me and my swf teammate got out because of it
---
Why should it get patched? It’s a good way to bait hits and only works on bad killers anyway
---
This happened to me twice i thought it was gonna give me a seizure
---
Denying the enemy!
---
In addition to what Devilswings5 said, you can just 99% your heal and then heal up only when the killer gets close. That way, you're healed but not really healed, and the downside of the aura-reading is completely removed.
---
Try using a Lerys offering with boil over. If you get hit through a window you can get some decent crawling distance with some recover bar before you get picked up.  Then the killer won't be able to see nearby hooks. This works out more towards the center cause there are always hallway hooks. 
---
This build works better with SWF to take aggro or body block
---
It's free software if you compile it yourself, and there are guides for non-tech people on how to do this just for aseprite iirc
---
Someone gets hookef
---

True, we'd have to fund an immortality project for you if that was the case

Yeah. I've also seen glitches where multiple killers load into the same lobby. To be honest I'm hoping it's another game mode, 2 Vs. 8.

Green flashlights are better, change my mind.
---
It lets lounge further. I would explain it, but there's too much science to it.
---
can you tell me about that doctor farm build?

Non-Toxic, positive, funny, good but doesn't try superhard(what i mean by that is, yes they try to win but not 4-man stack every game with Adrenaline/MoM/BL/BT)

He runs at 115% speed, the reason he looks even faster than normal is because of how fast his animation is so it looks even faster. I'd imagine he runs at 115% primarily because his power is ranged but not a full blown offensive in the context that it causes damage to a survivor.

Cannibal for BBQ
---
Myers for fun
---
Spirit for the plays
---
This helps, be more like this dood

DISCLAIMER: I’m NOT the original author.
---
I just found this on Pinterest and thought I should share it here.
---
If you know the original artist feel free to let everyone know.
---
I don't understand why you're being downvoted, it's clearly flaired shitpost.
---
Oooooo noice! Lol 😆
---
dunno some absolute unit clearly doesn’t understand 😂 r/whoosh
---
step 4 to step 5 made me think of /r/restofthefuckingowl LMFAO
---
also /r/dbdgonewild is probably gonna love this if you haven't already posted it there! really nice work, love how clean your lineart is!
---
Slugging is much more better, once I was against a swf that sabotaged my hooks, so I slugged one, went for another, slugged, came for the previous one that was being healed, chased the healer, placed a bear trap every time to buy some time, in the end I managed to 4k without camping at all.
---
Camping is just a waste of time and you don't get good at the game by camping, you need to interact with survivors and learn how to put pressure on the map, which camping doesn't do.
---
how did he not hear the spirit phase it shows like a shower thats next to your room
---
They actually nerfed it to no longer increase the efficiency of sabotage toolboxes.
---
I just hate the fact that i can throw a pallet down before a killer starts to swing, it will stun them, but ill still take a hit.
---
Lol, that’s because they removed that component of the game completely. Toolboxes now use 1 charge per second when sabotaging, same as repairing.
---
Alrighty, so my personal views on these perks (these are opinions and some ideas, so I'm sorry if I offend or annoy some people. I know some people really like some of these perks.)
---
**Autodidact**
---
Not so sure, the downside is WAY to heavy for a heavily RNG based upside.
---
**Boil Over**
---
Kinda bad, but could probably work with a buff. Probably an additional wiggle speed, would work great with stuff like Flip Flop and might shift the meta abit.
---
**No One Left Behind**
---
No idea. I would need either a serious buff or a complete rework.
---
**Premonition**
---
Kinda outclassed by Spine Chill entirely. I'd like it to work well along side Spine Chill so it'd probably be better off reworked, but into something entirely new could still be exciting!
---
**Resilience + This is Not Happening + No Mither**
---
It'd be nice to put all of these together. Otherwise Resilience could just work with a buff to maybe 15% movement speed.
---
**Saboteur**
---
Not sure, but at the moment it has really no reason to be ran since it doesn't impact the game in a meaningful way without wasting a stupid amount of time.
---
**Streetwise**
---
Maybe just a buff to 20% reduction in item charge consumption?
---
**Sole Survivor**
---
It's an alright perk as it is, just *extremely* underwhelming. I don't know what to do with this perk...
---
**Up The Ante**
---
Make luck affect more things or rework it. It has near to no impact on the game realistically.
---
**Vigil**
---
Make it recover from status effects 30% faster or the more controversial idea, make it recover status effects slowly while running, semi-restoring a mechanic remove from the game, but sacrificing a perk slot for those who want to use it that way. I'd be happier with a +30% recover rate though.
---
**Left Behind**
---
Make it so that you can get more than 25% bonus to repairing at the end, but only if you take hits, do safe saves from the hook or healing people. It'd be a small increase for each action, maybe like 2% for each state healed, 1% for each hit taken and 3% for an unhook. It'd reward people who actually contribute to the game AND reward them if they manage to survive with everyone else dying.
---
**Slippery Meat**
---
Having perks that affect only one killer with a very underwhelming secondary side effect what is now redundant due to Deliverance. And being saved by team mates. I'd say rework it entirely.
---
**Small Game**
---
This one is purely for me since I can be abit of a dumbass. Different sounds for totems found and traps found. I've ran into too many traps thinking that there's a totem there.
---
**Technician**
---
At the moment, it doesn't actually reduce the distance you hear repairing. It just muffles the sound which is still the same volume. I'd like to see it reworked but keeping some of it's original functionality.
---
**Wake Up**
---
I love this perk. I have no idea how to rework it. I'd say it'd benefit for a second effect it also gives along side opening gates faster.
---
This isn't me saying "I want these changes". I don't just play one side either, so I like to think that I'm not biased. I just really want to start a discussion about perks that either don't function correctly, could be better or should be entirely re-done.
---
If you have any ideas of perks that I didn't have a real idea of how to change or even just to talk about another perk not here that you'd like to see a rework, please do! I'd love to see how people see some of the survivor perks in their current state.

Seriously is it me or do Michaels tend to camp more often than not?
---
Meme correction: Dwight should say "a beer" instead of "a flashlight"
---
Ok then why do killers get that info of seeing survivors further away
---
yep, and they said they dont really care
---
Killer main here, Gideon's is the best map for killers don't @ me.
---
&gt;survivors having no idea whether you're a floor above or right behind them
---
&gt;stupidly visible scratch marks mean you're never losing anybody
---
&gt;probably the only map where survivors reliably fail to find gens because of how mazelike it is
---
&gt;You can basically walk around most pallets and windows with little to no penalty (aside from the ones near the bathroom gen, those suck)
---
&gt;No dumb environmental objects that get in the way of your vision (angrily glares at tall grass, corn and the bamboo on Yamaoka's Haunting)
---
Unless I'm Hillbilly or Nurse Gideon's is the ideal map for me.
---
Normal. I ran a Bubba for nearly two hook states last night and neither of the other two team mates would save the 3rd guy on the hook. He had Kindred too, which annoyed me even further since they could SEE what was going on. But no, let's hide behind some bushes on opposite sides of the map.
---
Maybe unpopular opinion- camping is whatever, it has overall vulnerabilities. One should learn to loop better and hide better in the first place? 
---
Idk.
---
😩 twice in a row yesterday - four-stacked party streamers with the group i was playing with. first game we all went down within five minutes and killer didn't even pip because he one-hooked most of us, and the second game i got kicked. so fucking frustrating.
---
The survivors should have useful info on the killer.
---
A day late boy-o
---
There's definitely times to camp.
---
Honestly, just use whatever killer you're the most comfortable using. If you play better, you get more points. Although, some killers struggle getting deviousness points (the Pig comes to mind). But yeah, slap on BBQ and a survivor pudding and try to get a lot of hooks and use your power a lot.
---
No witch hunts
---
I kinda like this idea for saboteur. It adds a little bit more functionality and also gives you information that you wouldn't usually get. Nice idea!
---
Exactly this, if there's 5 gens left and 1 guy on a hook you may as well camp or at least patrol around, they're likely all 3 running to the hook.
---
*yoink. I’lllllllll take that.
---
Solved by kindred!
---
Myers if you want all the ladies to flock to you. 
---
Cannibal if you want easy BP and don’t care if people think you’re gross. 
---
Pig if you like cute stun noises and spooks. 
---
Spirit if you want to be a racecar. 
---
Legion if you want everyone to hate you. 
---
Plague if you want to be a Huntress main but can’t bother to practice hatchets.
---
I main Pig and Spirit myself but LF’s BBQ is a must for people who play any killer.
---
Ok
---
What are you getting at? You said no one does totems. Just trolling?
---
Myers is my favourite killer in the game. He is so much fun to play, I’d go for him.
---
Those aren't Freddy mains.  They're people in the "7 seconds so he sucks" camping playing that way because they think it's all they can do.  I wish more people learnt how to play sweater boi properly

I miss the weekly streams with Mathieu and not_queen, it’s a shame we won’t be getting those anymore.
---
Yup, played 3 games in a row with hard tunnels. Even to the point where my other team mates tried to protect me long enough to be healed by the other guy. They tried body blocking the hag, trying to take hits, but the hag would only go for me. 
---
The others called the Killer out in post game and they said "so Im not supposed to go for the injured person". The others said they tried body blocking/standing in front of them to intentionally take them off of me/to take the hit but the Killer chose to ignore the other 3 physically trying to intervene. Weird shit.
---
Nice try. But that doesn’t apply here.
---
That's right, take your L and leave. I chewed you up and spit you out libtard.
---
You didn't address the poster who replied to you that you can just 99% the heal and completely avoid having your aura exposed.
---
Link me to where they said they don't care, please.
---
Wow! This is exactly why I don't do that kinda stuff. On a side note the spirit looks so weird when she is nodding like that. Lol!
---
Every one on this subreddit keeps saying ranked. What is that? Is it just a normal game?
---

---
When I play survivor usually the only reason I do it is to distract from a chase that's currently happening. That's just me though, I definitely have run into people who do it just to be cocky and I know what it's like when survivors won't just leave.
---
On Freddy whe  survivors intentionally fail skill checks to wake up, the extra gen regression is exactly what you want
