Had a Jane feed a Myers the other day, she looped him for not even 10 seconds, then just stood at the other side of a window pointing at him.
---

---
He was a fucking infinite tier 3 Myers, long story short, he killed everyone and I got hatch
---
---
---
As someone that used to be a killer main... I hate to shatter your dreams, but I never really cared.
---
"I'm not stupid enough to fall for this loop."
---
"Two gens popped while I was chasing that guy."
---
"Why didn't that hit?!"
---
"Oh fucking flashlight camping."
---
"You're next."
---
"I hate these people."
---
"Fuck this game."
---
"Glad you stopped to taunt me in the exit like a loser."
---
"Fuck you Entity."
---
When you vault a window but lag makes you enter a lock in a chase
---
Gotta slow the game down

Check out Demons (1985), an Italian Gore-fest, with one of the COOLEST Mo-Fo's in cinema... Well worth 90mins of your time! :)

Thank you, i appreciate someone reading them!

Last one was Dredd 3D wasn‚Äôt it? If so,

We gotta wait for 4D

I see a lot of people recommending certain perks or perk setups to deal with specific killers, but I don‚Äôt really understand how one is supposed to know before loading in what to run since you can‚Äôt see what killer you‚Äôre up against. Do you just run generally good perks until high ranks when you‚Äôre more likely to run into nurses and spirits constantly or something?
---
I've done that exact thing. Said I tunneled just because I hooked him twice at the start. I had hooked about before I hooked him his final time. Got a 12h, 4k match on that one.
---
Very true
---
Lmfao who is the wah wah bitch? Nurse?
---
Nea changed to Dwight like 5 seconds after I said that.
---
Yeah well, it's hard for people to get started on twitch cause well....ya know, a lot of twitch traffic goes to unoriginal females who....got lucky. I don't blame them for putting twitch in their name, getting started on YouTube and twitch is challenging in this climate
---
im not one to dc but i can't say i blame you
---
Wow a plague, this might be the most rare thing I have ever witnessed in my entire life
---
She slams open the locker door and he's just holding out a hatchet
---
Honestly just increase the rarity, it's only a freaking purple add-on and it's too tier
---
&gt; Your entire rant doesn't refute my point at all.
---
You know what, you‚Äôre right, because aside from apparently threats to find you and harm you irl in the *first* paragraph (literally, raise hell with Twitch, they won‚Äôt tolerate that shit and ban the streamer, I promise), your second paragraph talks about a sabo **squad**, and the fourth talks about **four man stacking of perks and items**.  It‚Äôs almost like you‚Äôre complaining about *Survive with Friends* and not the average streamer. ü§î
---
I can‚Äôt make you follow my advice, but you need to let some of the anger go. At the end of the day, it‚Äôs just a game. If you find yourself getting legitimately angry, like it actually comes off in your posts, you need to take a step back and reevaluate your view on things. The entire point is to have fun, and if certain perks or items or killers or whatever makes you angry to the point that you‚Äôre going to use it as an excuse to act in a toxic manner, then maybe DBD isn‚Äôt the game for you. Maybe taking a break would be a healthy idea.
---
I'm thinking they meant that it is the spots where a pallet could spawn but Freddy out one there himself.
---
I mean, a lot of this sub seems pretty adamant that spirit is broken, but i totally disagree. There's plenty of counter play and ways to lose her and therefore make her waste time. but people just hug walls, try to loop her, wait at pallets, and go predictable routes, or just straight up run the entire time. If you get to know her as a survivor, and practice, it's very fun because it's not your standard loop, pallet, route, repeat
---
Yeah. Theirs not very much of us wraith mains
---
My life
---
This is his twitter post regarding his break.
---
https://twitter.com/HybridPanda/status/1166352784771428353?s=09
---
Awwhhhhhhh! That's hot!
---
One got away
---
I get DC's whenever I loop the killer for just 3 pallets lmfao
---
Is the new content free?
---
BTW can I only get offerings to play license killers or can I get offerings for other killers like Spirit and Plague cause I only have license Killers offerings
---
I think
---
Noed is prevented by not reaching the endgame as well
---
Steve, fam. Demo looks cool too but Steve comes first.
---
Well, only for the Ptb
---
Wraith wasn't all bad either, he just lost it after finding out how many people he unknowingly killed.
---
What‚Äôs funny is there is porn of dbd for some reason don‚Äôt ask me
---
A good map with too many pallets in bad spots is Gideon Meat Plant. I had a troll there who ended up escaping because I was being cocky
---
Free? If by free you mean the public test build will be free for PC players to take part in tomorrow then yes. 
---
It‚Äôs going to be a $12-$15 pack IIRC.
---
I had a game where my other three teammates disconnected but coincidentally the hatch popped up the next place I looked, always stick to it no matter how bleak things look!
---
I'm gonna be honest I'm trash at this game but Im happy whit that 3k :)
---
Tunneling is trash, If you cant play the game without camping or tunneling you should uninstall.
---
&gt; The Magnificent Seven
---
Who's that? Not trying to name and shame but the only "Famous" or recognizable players I know are Entity's Left Hand, Monto, Noob3, etc.
---
First and foremost you need to use your ears - get real comfortable with knowing how loud breathing is, what vaults sound like, what gens sound like when they're being worked on.
---
After your ears, your eyes - survivors still cause grass, corn, etc. to move around as they walk through it.
---
Distressing and Whispers can be handy starting out - if a survivor is in your Terror Radius, they don't hear your Phasing sound. Use Whispers (32m) to find a survivor, move a little closer (Distressing TR 30.24m), then Phase and go for the hit. As you get better with her you'll not need to "surprise" survivors as much - Sloppy Butcher will become more important because you'll be absolutely keyed-in on the sound of injured survivors, and it won't matter if they hear you coming.
---
Remember that if you bump into something invisible blocking you, it's probably a survivor.
---
My favorite Nea cosmetics. :]
---
It looks fantastic.
---
Yo, Angelo
---
Reminder for your reminder, demogorgon nancy and steve are Wednesday. Tuesday is dedicated servers and the bloodweb changes on the ptb
---
Survivors have a fairly well-defined meta perk loadout, one that is strengthened by a well-organised SWF team.
---
"Counter" builds are generally there so that you can spend more time learning how to "handle" a killer. Eventually you'll go back to the meta loadout but with a bit more awareness of what you need to do against that particular killer.
---
‚ÄúWhat the fuck‚Äù 
---
‚ÄúMeg fucking do something‚Äù

‚ÄúHow is this rank 5‚Äù

Big brain 4 dwight 1 generator action, fam.
---
i hope your joking
---
You know what could solve all your woes?
---
Franklin's.
---
I don't know for sure, but I'm fairly certain NOED needs a free dull totem *at the time the last gen is done* in order to activate. If Haunted Ground is taking up both the remaining totems when the final gen is done, NOED has nowhere to go and you're out of luck. In practice, though, this will probably never come up, as Haunted Ground is usually triggered towards the start of the game.
---
This pleases me.
---
Because u face camp.
---
please be satire
---
I thought I saw a post a few days ago saying they were most excited to see the new leaked cosmetics (not for Steve or Nancy) datamined in the PTB. I can‚Äôt find that post anymore so I wanted confirmation
---
This is more of a gripe if anything, but why is it such a chore to climb out of yellow ranks or in general? I'm not the best and I'm trying to improve, and lately I've been pipping here and there (doing a gen or two, searching and breaking dull totems, saving people when I can, I just suck at running the killer though), but Jesus at Rank 15, I feel I have to run WGLF + offering and trying to carry the team to climb. It's not like I even want to get to Rank 1, just back to low green ranks or even purple. How do some of you remain consistent in pipping?
---
I suppose. Time to get bitched at for using franklins.
---
I DC if the killer is camping or tunneling or when it‚Äôs a Doctor. Sometimes when my teammate dc‚Äôs I will too
---
Farm
---
And?
---
original content &gt; putting TTV in your name. I've never seen a successful streamer put it in their name
---
Same fam, I camp 1 Claudette with leatherface and suddenly it's "piece of shit no skill camping bubba. Kys. I hope your Xbox bricks" I'm not the silly noobs that rushed a hook though and all got insta downed. Ez 4k.
---
Gen rush while they camp or try borrowed time.
---
What does SWF mean?
---
Survive with friends
---
I mean, if you want game audio from two games, sure, but DBD isn't really the game for that. Point is, advertising to people who are already doing something isn't likely to generate viewership
---
Ohhh. Ok thanks
---
It still hasn't gotten any better, when I'm playing as killer I'll regularly go take a shower or cook some dinner after queuing up.
---
Wait its tommorow?
---
u should check ur karma score
---
Np
---
Soon
---
You personally? Not much you can do if a killer is in your face while on the hook. Your team, however, should be rushing gens. They know where the killer is so they can safely rush them. 
---
Don't make the mistake where the entire team tries to save one person. More often than not it ends badly for you all.
---
bugs are never karma
---
its the game depriving you of something you deserve and giving it to someone who doesn't
---
its like your boss not paying you and giving the money to your highschool math teacher
---
karma is one thing but bugs are another
---
It's because she requires survivors to actually think and mindgame rather than just run to the next palletloop. And her counter perks are not meta, so plenty of people don't run them.
---
Personally, I think Spirit is one of the best designed killers in the game and I don't even main her.
---
And run decisive
---
It's alright, just got Too Excited
---
@redsquirrel0249 lol
---
&gt; Ruin doesn't require a downed survivor.
---
Wdym? I don't think I implied this; I just said it'd be nice if ruin can't be yeeted until a survivor goes down. Then it chooses an existing totem to pop up on.
---
&gt;"Just run to another part of the map", then 4 gens are gonna proc instead
---
How? If you're joining a survivor humping a broken building with 1 gen you deserve to get 4 gens popped on you for being a bad killer
---
&gt;"Just run whispers", are you implying that there should be 2 perks killers always have to run?
---
BBQ, Enduring, and whispers are fairly essential. Why not- they're very useful. Whispers if I remember correctly is a common pool perk by default so even new players can get it.
---
That's like saying "What, if I play survivor I HAVE to run an exhaustion perk???"- yeah why the fuck not.
---
If you're god tier and know every maps spawning patterns and layout/ can keep track of survivors all match, you don't NEED to run whispers.
---
&gt;The point with genregressing is that it's a waste of time, and you're not going to have time to kick it anyways if the survivors play well
---
?
---
I don't get what you're trying to communicate here- do you mean kicking gens is not a useful mechanic as is?
---
&gt;"Doing gens is the least fun part of the game", maybe for survivors but for killers it's not having a chance to impact the game because generators go by way too fast.
---
You have tools to stop it and gens get WAY slower once you've got the first survivor down.
---
swung straight thru a David earlier today. shit pissed me the fuck off
---
Survivor mains: *plays 3 trials, gets 80k bloodpoints*
---
Killer mains: I‚Äôm gonna do what‚Äôs called a pro gamer move.
---
I don't want to be funny in this conversation. I just find both funny and sad that everyone is complaining about a strong killer when dbd is a game where survivors have more power that their enemy. As i said before, this game is not balanced. Apart from nurse and spirit any other killer can be looped for so much time, can be flashlighted when breaking a pallet, cannot have proper map pressure due to their movement limit. There are 3 killers who are harder to bully, nurse, spirit and billy. Billy can still be looped and bullied, but he's fast as fuck and he can instadown. Nurse can teleport and spirit can phase. There are only two killer in the entire game who cannot be looped constantly, and people still bitch about that. Survivors can simply run borrowed time, dead hard, ds, self care, spine chill, balance landing, adrenaline... There are so much perks who can ruin a killer game. As you can bully most of the killers, be prepared to having a bad time. Spirit is not op, people just play her like other killer and die. I play both surv and killer, and fuck, playing as a killer is a torture if you go against a swf. Just learn how to counter her or prepare yourself for a massive nerd wave, dbd should not be "killer try to slow down the win", it should be a fair fight.

You know you don't have to play legion in order to upgrade him right?
---
who made you this way
---
It‚Äôs a joke
---
bbq and ruin ghostface? nice
---
If it is, he played it well because all of the comments he left looked like he was defending his position. Maybe I got out-sarcasm‚Äôd this time
---
It's not
---
It's almost certain. It'd break pattern otherwise. If not tomorrow, Wednesday, and if not Wednesday, BHVR are being weird
---
^darn
---
I would report him to the dbd support. They don‚Äôt tolerate stuff like that.
---
Don't listen to those nea mains
---
It's still absolutely impossible for any non developers like us to know what is coming out. They can be hyped and guess when it's coming out but in reality they have no idea
---
I don't think this is actually that crazy ignore the fact that in the animation freddy has his hand reared back pay attention to how far freddy is from nea right *before* nea speed up and its not too crazy especially considering we don't know the ping. If it was like a 100 ms ping i wouldn't be supprised.
---
Shirtless quinten but his in-game face. That's what I want to see. Dbd Quinten is a snack

Isn‚Äôt that what most people run?

You may not be a nazi but your grandpa was. *USA after WW2* ez gg scrubs

i thought tomorrow are the dedicated servers and ST is wednesday
---
I believe that was supposed to be their interpretation of a flashlight, but some dumbass accidentally put "gun"
---
This mostly happens to me with gens.  I have been robbed of 90% of gen grabs I could have had.
---
scoobs is the killer but he is now a mangled monster that can trike survivors into thinking hes just a harmless survivor (i found scoobs desqises hilarious and would think they would be fun a a joke killer) before emerging as his true monstrosity
---
Not unless its paired with another add on
---
They should really buff the hell out of mending but making it impossible to see is incredibly annoying so maybe they could remove that. Because seriously it gets so dark
---
"Haha ecks dee Ghostface is a killer!" Dude stop its 2019 Ghostface is a killer memes are boring
---
Nobody likes doing Adept Bill because the perks required are a very mixed bag and you have to explicitly set out to do it, whereas Left for Dead is an achievement any player can hypothetically get the opportunity to earn without setting out with a specific subpar build. Even if the opportunity is exceedingly rare it's clearly more common than people who have the will to get Adept Bill, as is more broadly evidenced by the positive correlation of playability of adept build (arbitrary units) to players who have it (per cent).
---
Whether swf or killer, shit takes forever.
---
I think everything should have collision.
---
Yup. All I think when it happens is that they‚Äôre dumb for missing out on their own bloodpoints.
---
Yes
---
Yeah because shit like that makes him not fun to play and play against
---
1 bloddy claudette: alright all cool with me. 
---
2 bloddy claudettes: alright these 2 are probs together I'll just watch out. 
---
3 bloddy claudettes: alright I'm going as my main. 
---
4 bloddy Claudette's with "hex:..."/ttv names, and items: That's it, I'm getting me mor√≠.
---
Is there a problem with that...?
---
Imagine thinking urban evasion is a good perk.
---
Lmfao, I play ALOT of games and no game comes close to dbd in terms of how mad people get over little shit. Really doesn‚Äôt make sense why people take it so seriously. Also, shamWoW infomercials are fuckin sick, so idk what you‚Äôre talkin about
---
Not another killing game
---
How is it the same? Camping and tunneling isn‚Äôt the same as using a mori lol. Plus I made sure to use it once they were dead on hook. So quit crying
---
I‚Äôm guessing you have ttv in your name cuz you seem a little trigged
---
^^
---
I don't actually have ttv in my name nor do I stream. it's just pathetic
---
Yeah like I'm not just gonna level her up because shes super cute. For the longest time I didnt  have any perks from Male survivors because I exclusively played females. Dont underestimate how big of a pervert I am.
---
Rng: *sends billy to treatment theatre*  
---
Entity: what the- ***Entity displeased***
---
seriously though what happened
---
He‚Äôs going to be my main no question
---
Same, I can handle most things. But rubber banding around the map is a no-go for me.
---
The idiots probably moved before you finished the heal.
---
&gt;Shut the fuck up  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;‚Äî When do you say that??
---
1) In a swf
---
2) When you're injured or there is an injured teammate nearby and the killer is near
---
3) Your character screams because of madness or infectious fright
---
They can do whatever they want with their OCs, but aside from Ghostface and maybe Bubba, the licensed Killers must be getting HINDERED by the Entity.
---
Death by high blood pressure
---
I'm a dumb ass that's how
---
Lol its the killers that complain every fucking post. Issues like Spirit requiring no skill to play is soemthing that needs to be brang up.

Spirit is hot as fuck, coming from a spirit main

To be fair its not like you get a choice in the matter, someone else chooses to stream and your gameplay gets streamed as well. At that point, knowing your on record, why not Mori the guy?

Those are heels

It‚Äôs pathetic to enjoy using a mori on someone who knows advertising twitch makes them a target? It‚Äôs pathetic to get butthurt over something so small.

Had a game where someone D/Ced at first down and then someone else did apparently just because it was a 3man. The Ghostface just teabagged at us while we finished gens and left.
---
No Problem ^^
---
I feel stupid I've seen this meme template 3 times now and still don't get it anyone care to explain?
---
I changed my name to learn to loop, without streaming.Never blame those who tunneled me.

Gotta go with Ghost Toast

Both end the game faster.

uh huh. do you think i care?

"or when it's a Doctor."

Crash Bandicoot doesn‚Äôt count. Online PvP games is where you encounter irrationally mad people.

Just say at the end of the game you stream, honestly I'm more inclined to watch if players tell me rather than getting players with ttv in their name that disconnect the second they go down.
---
The Original Lobby Simulator, circa 2016
---
It‚Äôs more about checking stuff off your list to get a pip. Obviously getting chased is important as survivor but doing gens, totems and getting heals are just as important. I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about doing everything but at least focusing on doing your gens and at least getting safe unhooks. In contrast to purple or even low green getting out of yellow should be a massive breeze. Just be cautious of making foolhardy or just outright nonsense plays. Recognize what you‚Äôre doing and where you‚Äôre running to/the gens you‚Äôre on and you‚Äôll make it out.
---
Nope.

Survivor was just being rude cause they died to noed.
---
Survivors' The World is, indeed, the power to rule over the world.
---
&gt; It's because she requires survivors to actually think and mindgame rather than just run to the next palletloop
---
Please enlighten me how you mindgame a spirit
---
Isn't Ash canonically left-handed, anyway?
---
I saw this comment. Went to another meme. Realised what you said and came back just to say that movie sucked more dick than a New York prostitute.

I never even  considered that I could place it in a diffrent slot to change its location. Tank you. This changes everything.
---
It sounds like you were ddosed or something like that
---
Idrk how it works but I don‚Äôt think they access anything personal while doing that. All it really does is spam your network with packets of random/useless information but it‚Äôs too much to process and it overloads and shuts off your connection
---
So many people say Spine Chill is underrated that now I think it's appropriately rated.
---
Perks: Then who‚Äôs flickering the lights? 
---
When a gen explodes, survivors are blinded for 5/7/10 seconds.
---
Rest of y‚Äôall comment more perks
---
To be fair, Ghostface teabagging is pretty hilarious (at least to me) and makes me laugh more often than not compared to nodding, hitting you on the hook, or the other ways killers would BM. I've probably laughed at every teabagging Ghostface and I love teabagging back at teabagging survivors.
---
But yeah Killers definitely bm'd before, I just find Ghostface funny.
---
Had three killers DC so far today. Juked a Nurse terribly (I‚Äôm not that good) and she just straight up quit. We already had one surv DC at the beginning of the match. I just wanted to play a full game.
---
Yee dawg im super butthurt for tryna ask a question
---
I would use memorial flower and hairbrush both yellow add ons but theyre pretty good. Another good pair would be j myers memorial with dead rabbit but you need monitor and abuse if you use dead rabbit or its basically useless
---
Honestly, if I could play every match as just a bog standard M1 killer with no power I would. But I cannot handle survivors who play immersed/ barely touch gens and crouch whenever they graze the terror radius.
---
Wraith is like the "gimme chases" killer with none of the hiding bullshit. I love chases.
---
Piggybacking off the below comment, Stridor is a good perk to help listen for survivors.
---
Also I've seen one Spirit build that uses Thrill of the Hunt and other hex builds. The trick is to wait till your Thrill goes off, and then ghostwalk over there and yank them off the totem.
---
It's fine when you watch videos of some csgo players performing trick shots. It's fine once and awhile when you see some cheeky ass in a game. It can be fun. But when you have 4 team swf who do their damndest to make your life miserable, and teabagging little shits every couple of games, it gets annoying. What killer wants to play knowing their next game might be ruined by a overly coordinated group with 4 instaheals, object of obsession and a desire to Male you suffer. It's fun to be toxic. Its fun to watch streamers be toxic. It's not fun to play with toxic people every game. It's why playing killer can be insanley stressful without super OP addons and perks. I dont feel the need to win every game, but getting absolutely destroyed tears at me emotionally. That's the power toxic players have.
---
Entity wants to play
---
Thought I was in r/sbubby for a sec ngl.
---
it is a skill, it's just not a very high cap skill. just listen, you're done.
---
Shook
---
also there's literally no spirit specific mindgames or anything, stand afk? awesome dude
---
If you "need" to play spirit to 4k you gotta understand you have to work your way up from rank 15 again and actually pick up on how to play the game

Like yeah, his chainsaw is nowhere near as amazing as Billy's, but he's an "okay" step up from M1 killer. Just don't go for a chainsaw all the time

Yeah I‚Äôm trying to get Barb 3 on him for bloodpoints s
---
You can get her with iridicent shards too, 9000 I believe.
---
I never mori but  *regularly* get brutal pip 4ks. Honestly I get brutal 3/4ks more often than I pip off of 3/4ks. 
---
Some killers just seem to have that happen if you play well, e.g. plague
---
Not just bloodpoints, it combos incredibly well with PGTW and his gen teleport ability
---
Idk if you‚Äôve noticed but in this game‚Äôs reddit every third post is complaints about toxicity and its not like that for any other game except maybe for honor

Legion 100%. Makes the game really boring and not enjoyable to play.

Seriously. I don't know if it's the killers I play (e.g. plague) but if I don't purposefully draw out matches I will end the night with 0/-1 pip increases despite almost every match being a 3-4k.
---
anyone that makes my matches last less than 5 minutes
---
You should try plague. Survivors get sick and become very loud, making it impossible to hide. Also she's actually a pretty solid character
---
its just as toxic as every other pvp gaming community, people call every pvp game the "most toxic community"
---
I just slam the pallet down when he's in a frenzy, let him jump over it, then jump back over to the side he came from and he always ends up hitting the pallet and boom, his frenzy is gone.
---
Yes, you are correct.
---
To me I just don't care if I die or escape. If I get like 20 seconds of chase in but I'm M1'ing gens and gates open in 5 minutes, that is a dogshit match.
---
Spirit takes the only fun part of the game and just makes it coinflip central. You *never* feel like you outplay a spirit or get outplayed by a spirit. If every spirit played optimally, I would not say that. GOOD spirits can have counters, cause you play around their optimal routes.
---
But the fact that she practically only requires headphones to play, anyone can play her, and you get questionable pathing from lobby to lobby.
---
She's not as strong as nurse- she has limited map control in exchange for strong chase game (like clown or something)
---
But god, it is boring. Just like Clown.
---
The objective and such is all very the same, however the way you choose to play and what you play with as well as how others play and what they play with can make the game vary greatly. Making it different enough each time to feel not entirely repetitive, and enjoyable. That's how i see it anyway.
---
Thank you.
---
Gonna avoid using blond hair as it seems detrimental.
---
Bruh this can't be true my main is still Kate but I'm def gonna max her and play her too
---
Well tbh that would kinda make certain perks useless
---
Spirit for sure
---
I'd love to see Shaun, Ripley, and Frank West.
---
I think for the trapper it should be the survivors head instead of their chest.
---
For the wraith: Put the bell on the survivors head and bing bong a lot.
---
I've never had a problem playing a game seamlessly online but I get disconnected a lot from loading screens. Is this normal?
---
Sike I don‚Äôt use these ever I just love stockpiling my own little ‚Äúbad day‚Äù Mori kit for the laughs v
---
I know but............. why
---
Ive been playing him since i started playing and hes my favorite killer next to spirit
---
A troll. I can't stand someone playing only to ruin the experience of others. Killer or survivor my least favorite type I find in the fog are definitely trolls.
---
Well, the worst is that what if I actually look you up and your not streamin... looks dumb, huh?
---
rick would work tho
---
&gt;We hope y'all are hyped for the Dedicated Servers &amp; Stranger Things PTB this week! 
---
Forget those, biker girl Kate is coming.
---
They seem to have gotten better with moris as time as has gone on, so we will definitely see some better ones in the future, but I've got no idea if they will ever revisit old ones.
---
pretty much everything but the face is solid. she kinda looks like a cat lmao
---
It‚Äôs a matter of opinion. I don‚Äôt use spinechill because I don‚Äôt notice any difference in performance. It really just makes you feel more comfortable, that‚Äôs about it.
---
woah, someones triggered
---
Haha that's funny I was going to say put the bell on the head. This game doesn't go too far with the graphics, if they could make the head pop then yeah but it'd probably just be a head in the undamaged heap and look weird.
---
I agree with all of this
---
Imagine complaining about the objectively funnest killer next to Billy
---
There is points awarded for gen progress while in a chase, it‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs there. If they rushed the gens fast you probably wouldn‚Äôt get many points.
---
The game uses a peer-to-peer connection so any survivor can get the host‚Äôs IP address and vice versa. Most modern routers will change your IP address if you restart them. To answer your question though, no he won‚Äôt be able to access anything, just the potential to be a pest until he gets bored/you change your IP address.
---
Hell even Mori dlc packs. 2 mori's per killer, 500 cells, that'd be cool, customize the killer a little more.
---
I really hope so, cause Friday the 13th kills is much more satisfying than DBDs sadly.
---
No offense but this game is definitely more toxic than most games. I've played many different multiplayer games and I've never been pissed of like I am playing DbD.
---
Lmfao
---
Fuck mori‚Äôs though like for real.
---
They should be nothing more than something equivalent to a Mortal Kombat fatality, something extra that has no real effect on gameplay.
---
Jesus Christ, I‚Äôd hate to be the Nea that pisses off the guy with 50 Ebonies
---
He's the only killer that seems appealing to me. I really like his stalking mechanic and tiny terror radius.
---
Still pissed Kincaid died within the first twenty minutes of The Dream Master. Hell, they killed all of the remaining Dream Warriors within the first thirty minutes.
---
I think the chats, the player count per game, and the pocketknife are the best things about that game. Dbd is better.
---
Would definitely be cool. Don't know if I'd spend 5 dollars on two moris but the idea is definitely something id invest in for the right price.
---
this just reminds me how forgettable the elm street reboot is because i do not remember this at all
---
If a survivor is in a Chase, their goal is to waste the killers time...
---
No dispute there, was just talking about how the killer kills animations.
---
Lol
---
I honestly don't get why ppl Mori streamers. Kinda seems like a dick move. All they wanna do is promote their streams and make careers (granted they could always add it to their profile description, but then again ppl like privacy too). Instead taking a Mori wouldn't it be better to prove how good u are and play a honest game to show ur skills through the stream? Again, I don't get it. I mean ik some streamer can be toxic like Ochido but c'mon dude... Really..
---
Im guessing you dont need advice on how to play him at all or do you?
---
True, you'll never see limbs cut off or decapitations in Dbd.
---
Controller Throwing Simulator 2017
---
Or
---
Death Is Not An Escape
---
Lol yes, I used the slogan
---
Killers shouldn't have complained about MoM. It was their own toxic tunneling faults that the perk even got introduced but their crying was loud enough that they nerfed survivors yet again. 
---
Then killers do nothing but cry about Meta perks such as decisive, dead hard, adrenaline, and etc.
---
50? That‚Äôs just on my spirit, in total between all the killers I have P3 50 I have approximately 124 Ebony Mori‚Äôs. 
---
Actually a David king that I let his entire team escape sent me a message a few minutes ago flipping out saying ‚Äúf you‚Äù ‚Äúplay the game normal b****‚Äù so I politely informed him that in lieu of party streamers like last game I have a nice red present for him next time.
---
Have Shawn and Ash have dialogue between them
---
BM?
---
Not a fan of the 2nd either but the pool scene is hysterical and wild so it gets points just for that.
---
Feels unrewarding to play though
---
Like the only joy i get is just being really toxic to the idiots who cleanse, as like revenge on all the teammates who do it when I play survivor
---
Idk- she's nowhere near as fun as Huntress. If getting killer sick was a lot harder it'd be fun.
---
I'n assuming you got 8k points in boldness. The point is if you want more points you should try to balance your time between all 4 categories. Getting chased for 4 gens is good, but it means you were only doing one thing the whole game, which is why you got so few bloodpoints.
---
Yeah I usually save Ivories for extremely toxic survivors, but I‚Äôm way too busy getting splinters for killers I already own to get Ebonies
---
If only it would be that easy lol. I put heaps of time into my videos but i'm happy that they're not getting many views. don't get me wrong more views would make me happier but rn it's not really bothering me
---
Unfortunately I can't remember. I'm sure I'll run into him again as I try to grind rank
---
If the killer continues to chase me tho that's their choice I would much rather just be doing gens or cleansing but if they keep chasing allowing my team to do gens I don't think that's toxic if I've been forced into the situation

And the ones who make it so you can‚Äôt message them
---
Ikr? If the Wraith can muffle his bell and the Spirit use beads to spook survivors, why can't the Piggy not go AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA when she wants to suprise them?
---
I've played this game almost every day for the last 3 months, sometimes just a single game, sometimes 4 or 5, but I don't think I have ever seen someone with TTV on their name being toxic, survivor or killer, rank 20 or rank 1.
---
Honestly, most people that gave me hatch were TTV people, and most TTV survivors I found weren't exactly toxic, they played pretty well but they weren't toxic.
---
That's probably why I don't get the amount of toxic posts targeting streamers just because they would like to get a viewer or two while they play
---
I wish he could've lasted longer, but at least his kill was pretty good. "I'll see you in hell!" *"Tell'm Freddy sent ya."*
---
A lot of effort to voice your terrible opinion eh?
---
The thing I don't like about spirit is that you don't hear phasewalking when you're in her terror radius. So you never know when she'a using her power. That being said, it leads to 50/50 gambles when trying to mindgame the spirit. Mindgames aren't fun when you have to roll dice.
---
I feel that, running into endless bully squads SUCKS, at some point you just wanna play the game without it but it takes way less than a full bully squad to trigger half of this community. One tbag or point at the killer/ one swipe at a hooked survivor and everyone loses their mind lol, this com is way more sensitive than most, its baffling lol
---
Downvoted.
---
Just get the fuck out :P
---
We can make do with losing that.
---
When the last survivor tries to jump for the hatch and you try to grab them but swing instead. I've lost a few mori offering because of that shit.
---
I agree
---
that issue is probably due to you can't tell if a person legitimately deranked or not through the system. Outside of mass DCing which is a separate issue that should be punished.
---
But anyone who knows how the ranking system works can effortlessly derank and still play in a match. You can still get your altruism points and escape if you always unsafe unhook and just bring a key for the hatch ignoring gens for the most part, boom you just guaranteed a depip with black pip at best while still escaping with a decent chunk of points.
---
Same for killer; just slug, facecamp, make sure everyone dies on first hook, and use insta downs. You will most likely depip but still get tons of points.
---
Problem being that the system most likely can't tell the difference between matches like those and matches where the player was actually just bad.

Still going to be an issue its not ran, i can see people leaveing it after realiseing everyone else has the same idea and can get only one or two heals off by useing it.
---
I personaly think a totem counter should be introduced to make it easier to know when to do totems and some more dull totem killer perks being introduced would be great.
---
For example, hex the third seal and huntress's lullaby would make great dull hex perks as they are not realy strong enough to warrant being lit hex perks. In addition it would be interesting to see fire up buffed depending on the ammount of totems on the map.
---
How hard is this? I just started and I'm like 16 I think?

well to be fair i rarely use plague XD mostly ghost face rn
---
Where is Clementine and Kenny?
---
I would argue otherwise. A movie can be objectively bad but still entertaining. Or you can enjoy what you know is a bad movie, even if others don't and you know from an objective standpoint it's bad.
---
I, for example, love the SAW series to death, even if I know that past the first movie it's *objectively* bad film. I just find it charming. You can like bad things, but that doesn't mean they're not bad.

Lol she just yells as shes cuasing you all you hear is AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

Think it would be pretty dope if the wraith just stopped a running away survivor from behind, put his hand into their torso and ripped out their spine and skull and then proceeded to beat the remaining survivors with said spine club. 
---
That being said I‚Äôm a survivor main and that would be super scary/amazing.
---
ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è then leatherface could just insidious camp
---
Gtfo honestly
---
You cannot fathom how badly I want a mod of that
---
Probably the hag considering how physically weak she must be and mentally. Ghostface also seems easy to fight back against as it's just a skinny journalist that only kills unaware victims so fighting an aware one would probably be a challenge for him.
---
Some people have told me ruin isn't worth running on him because he doesn't have map pressure. Would you agree with that?
---
Actually in regards to survivor cosmetics, the developers didn't change them in of themselves, they messed with textures and lighting in the game, was ages ago AND it was in the patch notes that things would look different,  the changes were a result of that. Whenever they mess with the graphics things as a whole change a lot. But they didn't change the actual cosmetics with the exception of when they reworked the blood, that changed prestige outfits.
---
Still though this carry on about cosmetics not assisting you in game is hilarious. They're not meant to, its a fucking skin. Don't like them then do the buy them. 
---
I agree though, anyone mentioning Claudette outfits needs to git gud. If you're just wanting to urban around and not be seen then why bother, makes the game very boring and any idiot can do it. Claudette mains just camp hatch after others did the work hoping the remaining players will die. Way to go, a depip and 75% of your pitiful end score is hatch provided you actually make it.
---
Clown because If I can't out-sprint an obese man who's walking then i'd be disappointed in myself. that and I can just hold my breath when running through his toxins
---
I feel your pain....
---
If you play toxic against people that aren't being toxic, the only one spreading bad manners is you
---
For real he better be burnt
---
You do realise that Aftercare """buff""" doesn't actually do anything until rank 3, right? Did you mean to implicitly remove the cap on auras visible?
---
Damn. You play a lot. I wish i had the time. Im honestly jealous.
---
I play on PS4 and I turned off my messages long ago. Made the game more enjoyable.
---
yeah. So when i get hooked, i lose one survivor aura instead of 2
---
Well id say use ruin or corrupt intervention it was just on shrine
---
But I go back and check
---
It's really easy to recognize a deranker from someone who's just bad, speaking from personal experience.
---
I actually really like that concept, that would be a interesting addition to the game.
---
This is my stand, „ÄåBAD BEHAVIOUR„Äç!
---
With its power, I can bullshit any attack into a whiff, get into locations where I'm unable to be hit, get the killer stuck, and cause hitboxes to cease existing, by manipulating the very fabric of BHVR's coding! You'll never be able to reach the plateau I stand upon!
---
Hell yeah, The Boys memes
---
Do you find that the mirror shards make an impact? Where you see survivor auras for a few seconds after stalking.
---
This just happened to me about an hour ago and what made it worse was I had one dead, two on hooks and the jackass that got the hatch let the two hooked die, so they could get the hatch. I saw them heading at the hatch as I found it and made it there with just enough time to snatch and all I did was swing my damn weapon. I wanted them to die.
---
Nightmare 2 is by no means perfect, although I disagree that the gay vibes were for no reason. The script writer, very intentionally, added gay sub-tones about a boy battling his sexuality. Somehow, it went under the noses of the entire production crew. Whether it worked or not is up to you. I think it'd honestly be a great idea for a new movie. Also the logic behind the movie was that Fred was possessing Jesse. I mean, he is a demon afterall, even if it didn't work that well.
---
I think liking Nightmare 2 over the remake solely because of Englund is a valid reason, though. Horror movies are just as much about the monster as they are the survivor. Texas Chain Saw Massacre is about the family more than it is Sally. No offense to Jackie, but he was *awful* in the remake. It's not his fault, either: the makeup was cumbersome and the dialogue was shit (give or take a few good lines I wish were in better movies). Nonetheless, the end result is a horrible sounding, and horrible looking, Freddy. On top of that, they played the pedophile aspect into the dirt. It's not about whether you think he was one in the original or not; you shouldn't JUST focus on that to be scary.
---
Englund is just as great as he always is in Nightmare 2. There's weird and fun scenes in Fred's Revenge, even if they're fun for the wrong reasons (Jesse's infamous dance scene). Jesse was weird, but at least he was memorable. And really, that goes for any Nightmare movie... except for the remake. Just about all of the originals have at least 1 or 2 memorable characters, and they all have a great Freddy. 2010 Nancy and Quentin were horribly bland. 
---

Forgive me for writing blocks of text! I could talk about these movies for hours haha

Ok its a skin just like you said you have the skin your not gonna play ghostface oh well get over it just play the game
---
Just tosses his old weapon and uses your body...uhgh I like it
---
the stream sniping is real. My friend has TTV in his name and he streams when we play survivor. we get streamed sniped all the time.

You know what they say. If they have twitch in the name, don‚Äôt expect intelligence

Hah! The real solution is to just be so trash you never get into people/red like me!

I thought 1 was meh and 2 was amazing. Didn't care for the others though. Haven't seen the last 2 or 3 movies though
---
Its good if you go up like on a hill and stalk but other than that it has little to no use
---
Give pig a cowboy hat and a megaphone. Oh god I can hear her nowü§£
---
You swung your weapon because they removed hatch grabs when they released end game collapse.
---
I cannot confirm if its true or not but have heard it multiple times and obviously its going to change when dedicated servers come out
---
I thought someone who posted spirit furry would ne able to appreciate this
---
3000+ hours in man and don‚Äôt be jealous i sacrifice sleep for video games a lot. I‚Äôd be rank 1 this season by now but it took me a few weeks to reach rank 1 no mither.
---
You cant hatch grab anymore, they removed it in wndgame collapse.
---
I didn‚Äôt know that......
---
No one is saying original content is bad. The TTV thing also does not mean your content isn't original, the TTV thing just could help with getting you traction, whether it's effective or not in your opinion does not matter. Point is, it's hard to grow as a content creator on both of the online content juggernauts known as Twitch and YouTube, anything you can do helps.
---
All I want to do is use my cypress mori without some bullshit happening is that too much to ask?
---
Pretty situational and a waste of killers time
---
I would gladly welcome death if I saw that irl
---
I mean I guess, but it isn't exactly punishable to be too good for the rank you're at. Not to mention rank reset still being a thing, It also isn't common for someone to just not play for a month or 2 and come back as a rank 17 survivor/killer and still be as good as they once were, that's not exactly deranking but still has the same outcome.
---
I find it fun when you and a GF like, accidentally walk into the same place at the same time and have a brief meeting where GF teabags, you do it back, and this goes on for a few seconds before the chase starts.
---
I can hear this asdfghjkl
---
Distractions don't work against any killer worth their salt. Mindgames win you loops not chases. And no stun lasts long enough to break LOS and stealth away (and even if it did, scratch marks would work against it). And jukes do not work unless the killer is a potato

She may be hot as fuck, but she is indeed a blueberry bitch
---
Me playing as Jane just got a nasty hit with a hatchet across the entire map. I got a clip of it from the killer's POV so at least there's that.
---
does she have a skill ceiling? sure. does it make any fucking difference? absolutely not. 
---
as long as you're not absolute garbage you're gonna do well with spirit- the difference in the in-game effect between the skill floor and ceiling is miniscule.

Huntress
---
I'm not entirely sure this would work. Youd have to maintain chase from quite a bit away since it only activates while in chase and youd still have to ultimately finish the job because a survivor could just stay in a loop that's within your terror radius anyway.
---
F13 has ideas that honestly would work amazing in DBD. For one, having different objective options is very welcome. Rather than being stuck with just doing Generators in DBD, in F13 you could handle fixing the Boat, fixing the car, calling the cops, or if you‚Äôre feeling lucky with a team, kill Jason.  I honestly somewhat prefer the gameplay of F13 to DBD. I really don‚Äôt like that looping the killer is a common thing, it just isn‚Äôt fitting for the concept of the game. F13, you can‚Äôt do that. You gotta avoid Jason and keep your fear in check, so you don‚Äôt trip and get caught. As well, the survivors are different in more than perks. In DBD, once you get the teachables, all survivors are the exact same, just skins. Not really ideal. In f13, there‚Äôs stats like how good this character is at not panicking, how fast they are, and even repairing. This makes the survivor choice more meaningful even later in the game. As for Jason, I have mixed feelings on his power level. I like it getting more powerful as the match progresses, just not the time it takes for his grab to unlock kill options. I do like weapon swapping, and honestly it‚Äôd be an amusing, albeit silly idea in DBD. Cause imagining the Legion chase you down with a katana is something I‚Äôd honestly pay to see.
---
Being honest? I think getting more ideas from F13 would be good. The gameplay is more fun, just not polished.

If someone quits during the loading screen or right before, it disconnects you. If youre just getting disconnected for no reason, then more than likely the game is messing up but it could be your internet too
---
I want the guy who covered wars.
---
If Jake wanted chips, he should have gotten a bag from the hamburger store
---
But the juicy salt though
---
Dont know what rank you play at but I've seen all survivors I've played against doing pretty much all of those (while not consistently)
---
Wraiths piss me off.
---
Okay, thanks for all the help.
---
You also forgot when someone complains about being camped and etc you have some killers say I bet you did something to deserve it no way a killer would just do that lol
---
Ok I was just asking.
---
The only thing here that's terrible is spiderman 3
---
Hiding lol. Also it looks cool
---
I'm rank 1 survivor and rank 1 killer. Once you start playing the game, you understand how to run the killer around, what to do in certain moments, you will see it's not that hard. It's much harder to reach rank 1 killer and I did it today (you can check my profile). This was the point of the post btw, I wanted to say that I'm rank 1 survivor and killer that's why I put '...'
---
When you cleanse a totem, does the killer get a notice?
---
"I, Giorno Giovanni, have a dream..."
---
Omegablink is not extra blinks. Omegablink is stacking range addons
---
Thanks for the reply but thats why i ask to know if those techniches are being used because i do not enjoy the moonwalking legion and now i consider that in fact yes. I was wrong but it was a question so thaks.
---
But can xbox ban me for this ? He told me xbox would . He was so salty in chat . Saying stuff like ggez baby killer reported for facecamp  , i didn‚Äôt message back tho .
---
I would kill for Frank as a survivor
---
Yeah happy to help
---
I've been playing for only a year and I make it to rank 1 all months. My point was to say that I'm also rank 1 killer (I made 2 posts, hence the '...')
---
I‚Äôm not defending him but you can‚Äôt depip past rank 16 so he prob just did not play for awhile
---
that last perk + iron will
---
I've been discussing it with another friend, and ultimately what hurts him is his 2 forms.
---
I mean, hillbilly doesn't have to change forms to use his ability, so why does Doctor? Only thing I can wager on is because of his Terror Radius static field thing.
---
Which admittedly might need some tweaking, but really M2 should just allow him to use his shock attack, instead of having to switch back and forth which is admittedly kind of clunky as it is.
---
this game looks kinda unfair, so its understandable
---
 Nah of course they can‚Äôt. Microsoft won‚Äôt ban your account for in-game stuff unless you‚Äôre modding/hacking.
---
I love when they instantly disconnect. They trash Talk you for the way you play and then block you or leave the post game before you can say anything back
---
Why prestige someone if you don‚Äôt have blood points saved up?
---
Oh believe me I get my fill in post game chat
---
It's interesting to see how a lot of the "Nea is a killer" memes started to die off once she started getting good cosmetics.
---
Keep going I'm almost there
---
Thanks :) i got kinda scared for a moment . I guess that guy was just salty
---
lemme get chuck greene
---
haha survivor bad killer good upvote plz
---
Rank is useless. I warn you, if you want to have fun in the game, then just stick to rank 16.
---
Do so love getting downvoted because I don't think people should just be randomly posting movie spoilers at will on here. Heaven forbid that someone not see something right away and not want it ruined.
---
I honestly don't think their unique art style would mesh well in DbD.
---
Based on what emerges from the void when a survivor gets sacrificed, The entity's (who I think of as female for some reason) physical form is spider-like.
---
That being said she's definitely some sort of eldritch being, who's true form on her plane of existence is probably unknowable to us feeble mortals.
---
Hey you got a 4 k maybe you deserve rank 1
---
Template? :D
---
Haha thanks dude, I‚Äôm not going to lie they were kinda bad for their rank
---
Oh big sad
---
^here ^you ^go
---
&gt; Yeah, God forbid a survivor tries do their main 
---
Ok, I see where you're going.
---
&gt; and only objective as fast as possible.
---
And that's why you get clapped by NoED.
---
If you're doing well enough that the Killer got a 4K they didn't deserve at the end of the game, you were doing well enough that you had time to cleanse totems. Totems are definitely a side objective, so Generators aren't the only one.
---
And I hear someone say off in the distance "I'm not going to cleanse Totems since not every Killer runs NoED", and I'm going to preemptively counter that by saying if enough Killers run it that it's a problem, enough Killers run it that you can cleanse the totems.
---
That's how it is some times on reddit but here if it makes it any better take a upvote
---
Kinda random question
---
Wow a Boil Over change that isn't "make the wiggle bar feel faster." For that alone you should feel proud, whether or not these ideas are viable or not.
---
You forget Clown was an amazing track star...
---
Matchmaking is like broken right now. Today I played a few games at rank 1 killer and got matched against ranks 16 and 17. Same happened when I played survivor. I'm also rank 1 and played against green and yellow killers. All of this will be better in the next update tho.
---
red rank has plenty of terrible players, not every high rank player is a good player
---
But all quintons are gremlin man. That part is a fact. :)
---
No worries. Please are always gonna be salty, just have your fun.
---
How‚Äôs that random? The post is about a prestiged survivor with no perks
---
Key word, was
---
* Dull totems: no
---
* Hex totems, aka lit totems, aka fire totems: yes, they get a big explosion + thunder sound when the cleanse is completed
---
--EXTRA--
---
If the killer is running the perk Hex: Thrill of the Hunt, they get a notification whenever someone STARTS cleansing ANY type of totem (so not when the cleanse is over and not only with hex totems as explained above)
---
No the killer doesn‚Äôt notice, unless he has a perk called thrill of the hunt on, and that perk only applies to hex totems not regular ones.
---
If they aren‚Äôt effected by the Entity (super strength) probably Hag or Pig since they are both weak.
---
thanks. I thought about that change for a while, if you have a better idea you can comment down here as well.  In here we can all have idea for some perk changes.
---
A Mori is an offering that a killer can use to trigger a kill animation on a survivor in the trial. There are three Mori offerings: one allows you to kill the last survivor in the trial when you down them, one allows you to kill any one survivor that has been previously hooked, and one allows you to kill every survivor that has been previously hooked.
---
So I know their implementation would result in cries for their killer but I'm just gonna go ahead and say Macready from The Thing. Also I second Ripley if only for the Xenomorph. Not that I'd likely play them since I almost exclusively play killer, but the old horror fan would love to see them.
---
no haha, I whacked him and I went literally thru him. I clipped thru him. I was pissed and shook at the same time. I still ended up getting the 4k at the end, but at that moment I wanted to put my controller thru my monitor. LMAO
---
"You stupid bitch" üíÄ Yesss!!!
---
Reading everyone else's comments I thought I was just an extremely aggressive player.
---
This is why children shouldn't be allowed on the internet.
---
The Memento Moris are offerings that grant the killers the ability to kill survibirvors by their own hand instead of by hooking them. If you down a survivor after already having hooked them once you get a special prompt that says ¬´kill¬ª and it triggers a mini cinematic where the killer slays the survivor
---
MLGA them. Avoid in the future.
---
Waaaaaah, waaaaaaah
---
Slight related. Don‚Äôt necessarily want to see Shaun but Sgt Angel from hot shots would be dope
---
This is why I almost always try and play a disruption style in this and other games that can possibly get repetitive... sure I rarely get to run meta builds but it causes every round to have it's own flair depending on what side I'm on and how those around or against me react.
---
Sir this is a Wendy‚Äôs

That's why ur mom got raped by the ups man
---
There are multiple versions of the preschool maps?!
---
I see the Wraith let out his dog.
---
Why did your mommy let you get on Reddit? So irresponsible...
---
It's possible that the killer closed the hatch on the last survivor, which powers the exit gates. This allows the last survivor to try opening the gates.
---
Google Endgame Collapse for more info.
---
High ranks and still do this
---
It's a problem that strikes many killers. Billy is one lf them. Because his chainsaw both insta downs and can end chases quickly, you almost never actually get anything better than silver in chaser.
---
i haven't played DBD in a while and i'm kinda out of the loop so what does blood warden do ?

Check new subreddit rule

Why did ur dad fuck prostitutes so irresponsible

I like going against her.

Holy crap, you need to be banned from speaking online until you grow up.

Hahahaha hahahaha ha you tried to dodge my hatchet hahahaha trash got downed hahaha then dc hahahaha

Not really there‚Äôs only a not stupid reason to dc, keep ur item. He lost nothing and if he dc on hook actually that benefits the killer.

when meg runs up to the gen
---
On some real shit Ruin totems may as well have a giant beacon of light telling us where they are since everytime I spawn into a game it's literally ten steps away from me, usually out in the fucking open begging me to cleanse it like it knows I'm a slut for bloodpoints.
---
K

amazing...also shade the names next time...no need to shame anyone buddy
---
Yes plz ‚ù§
---
Loop time
---
The peacocking here is insane.
---
"How does it feel, Billy? Having someone rob you of your movement, if I had to describe it, is like when a guy without a toolbox works on a gen for 80 seconds, and at the very last second before his Adrenaline activates, a scratched mirror Myers grabs him from behind, and he's dragged back onto a hook. Does that sound right?"

The nightmare
---
Y did u grow up in a concentration camp
---
I am.
---
Yea, that SteelFuxorz guy is the problem with this community.  He thinks DCing against any "toxic" tactic the killer uses (aka any time he doesn't win) is him "teaching the killer a lesson" and thinks he's better off for it.  When in reality he's the cancerous one depriving both himself of points and his allies of any chance of winning.
---
Poor guy was probably bullied as a kid and he DCs in DbD as some sort of revenge fantasy.
---
Amazon listing makes it seem like it will include all original DLC upto the spirit one. The listing is a bit vague but it sounds like the licensed content will not be included
---
Of course it's face camping, but what else can you do?
---
That's obvious considering you're trying to say DbD is better than F13.
---
Do u have parkasins... y did u run away from ur nursing home?

Just tunnel the guy who has the key.

My bad. I wasn‚Äôt 100% sure so I checked on google and it the top source said 2011, but looking back now almost all the other ones have 2:11. Thanks man.
---
Screw getting survivors I want doodlebob and Hash swinging, slash being, rash bringing, hash slinging slasher
---
Bloodhound is great on them allows you to track even in feral frenzy after a hit
---
This is such a low effort meme template.
---
Then I suck so much dick
---
Three of the images have an appearance similar to the actual actor in some reboot/remake of the freddy movie. The non-conforming is considered ugly/bad.
---
yea bro I can fuck literally anyone up w my chainsaw since I‚Äôve been using him since he came out so I dk t have a problem w that. I was thinking cause that‚Äôs a whole 30 percent of the gen regressed bro that‚Äôs fucking insane. So bbq and chilli and deerstalker are perks I‚Äôm 100 percent running that‚Äôs without a doubt. So now I‚Äôm guessing pop goes and overcharge? I‚Äôll try that out bro cause I‚Äôm fucking sick and tired of getting my ruin destroyed literally within the first 5 minutes of the game and then they gen rush the shit out of me, appreciate the response bro I‚Äôll def give this a try
---
if the exit gates are opened and you hook someone, the exit gates are blocked by the entity for 60(?) seconds
---
that wouldn't be too difficult to use, headshots come regularly as huntress
---
Wooow that's so cheap, did you report him and notify Behavior about this at least? The least they can do is add another way down if this gets repetitive on this map.
---
I can't sit and play 10 rounds of F13, I can easily do that with Dbd. I just had it first I guess, just me, I still fuckin love F13 though don't get me wrong.
---
Seriously kid, I hope your parents find this thread and ground you from the internet for a good year or so.
---
Man Spirit sucks ass to play against, but she is the second killer that i hate versing, the first one is hag and the third one is nurse. People say that doc is annoying too, but i'd rather verse 5 docs in a roll then face half a hag
---
Distressing + Speed Limiter Pog

Wednesday
---
Yes there is. When stalking a survivor their white outline will start turning red to show how much is left.
---
Okay so like, serious question. What do you want the survivors to do, realistically speaking? Do you just want them to just not do gens? Dont do great skill checks even if they are skilled enough to do so? And I mean why? Do you want a survivor to say "man we're being too hard on the killer, let's stop doing gens for a little while so they have a sporting chance"? As nice as a sentiment as that would be, you cant actually read that and not think that sounds absolutely ridiculous. So what do you want survivors to do if not gens?
---
Had a guy with ttv in his name where his duo queue told me to kill myself after game. Guy didn‚Äôt say shit but I went to his stream after to watch that section of the vod and he was talking mad shit telling him to say it. Yet somehow that‚Äôs not enough evidence to BHVR for them to do something. It‚Äôs wild.
---
Mike: Haha your not in dbd!
---
Jason: Bitch I got my own shit to run.
---
*Complains about killers being toxic crybabies*
---
*Posts twenty times in this thread whining about killers*
---
I was bullied at home and school as a kid. Just shit post on 4chan like a regular person
---
When 80% of the ".TTV" players are 4 man SWFs with 3 players just doing nothing but carrying the streamer... well, it starts to make sense.  This is roughly 50% of female DBD streamers.  
---
My nickname for this phenomenon is "beta escort squad".
---
Dont sweat it a lot of idiots play the game
---
Frank's mixtape is the worst add on in the game.
---
I run Iron Will on all my survivors (or try to, the bloodweb has not been very generous to me on that front) specifically in case I run into a spirit. It's comforting to have against other killers (especially since when I play killer I rely so much on audio cues), but it really is a must-have against spirit for me.
---
And it was exciting and awesome when it first came out
---
Sorry, but this has me laughing pretty good...
---
It's easy to sit and play 10 rounds of F13. Way easier than doing so with DbD, plus F13 has a less toxic community.
---
Basement blocking could hold the emotive match hostage when a couple of people were down there for either a save or just bad luck, or could even be used to nullify borrowed time. 
---
This house, although the play was great by the Killer, should probably have a broken banister akin to those found in the Badham houses. Small design flaw, but devs are already hard at work fixing things (or at least attempting to fix things) that are frequently encountered in the game, add new content, and generally QOL.
---
He's a pretty big douche and most of us are already aware
---
I think people would see stranger things and never heard of dbd but play just for stranger things
---
I have a hook that‚Äôs perfect for you
---
True. But I'm just like damn how dense are you lol
---
I mean... if they're camping they might be viewbotting too.  Who would want to watch that?  Super boring.
---
TBH I see NOED as a bit crutchy and don't use it (I dislike sacrificing a perk slot just for a "Stronger endgame") outside of super weak killers like Leatherface, (It's so hard to hit people with his chainsaw) Wraith,  or Trapper (He wastes a TON of time setting his traps up). I also use it for an Endgame build. (NOED + Remember Me + Blood Warden) Besides that I don't like using NOED as a "Band-aid" and refuse to use it on stronger killers. 
---
I do agree one can argue it's the survivor's fault for not doing totems. 
---
IMHO we just need a totem counter. I'd throw it on Small Game and maybe make the "Clunk!" noise a dull totem makes when destroyed global so people can keep track even if they're not running Small Game. 
---
I cleanse every dull I see and sometimes play "Hex Detective" (Tapp with Detective's Hunch, a normal map since Detective Hunch totems show up on your map even without addons, and Small Game) trying to get as many totems as possible.
---
Either way run NOED, don't run it, whatever. Survivors run Adrenaline and NOED can be seen as the counterpart of Adrenaline. 
---
In terms of NOED rewarding failure, just because the last gen was popped doesn't mean the killer "Failed". As soon as the 5th gen pops, the game doesn't immediately boot everyone to the results screen. (Well, unless the killer ragequits)
---
5th gen popping simply means the endgame has started. The killer's job is to hook (And several hooks. I've done endgame builds and gotten a 3K and depipped) and kill. The emblems credit the killer for chases, hooking, and sacrificing survivors. 
---
Yes the killer's other job is to defend the generators so the match doesn't end early and to stall for time. Lightbringer even grades the killer on defending the generators. But just because the 5th gen popped does not always mean the killer necessarily failed at their job, just the survivors have accomplished theirs. Even if they manage to get 5 gens, they still haven't escaped just yet.
---
Tbh I've taken a very nihilist view on the emblems. I've had Doctor 3-gen games that end with EVERYONE, including the survivors who were sacrificed double-pipping. I've had 3K's and depipped. 
---
Whether NOED is concerned it's debatable. Survivors do have counterplay but IMHO the dull totems need to be easier to track because I have been the "Totem Guy" and with randoms it's impossible to know how many totems are remaining.
---
As a Jane main this is extremely accurate. I always feel like such a bad bitch when I stun with head on.
---

Ahh, so that's what it is. Does it ever go away? Like, overtime?

He realized he did something stupid and decided he didn't deserve to live
---
yo who spilled red Icee on my girl
---
&gt;tfw they weren't streaming so you used a mori for nothing
---
You all are why killer queues take like 20 minutes.
---
And even then, if they have stridor you‚Äôre still fucked
---
Ssttuuuuppppiiiiidddd bbbiiiitttccchhhh! XD
---
He‚Äôs not making fun. Claudette is black and so is OP. OP even Thought it was funny so chill out dude.
---
I put [t.tv](https://t.tv) in my name purely bc if i get mori'd, or tunneled, thats free content. You're giving my 2.5 viewers something to laugh about and that's all that matters to me chief.
---
I get the odd facecamper, nothing too frustrating, and I get the add asshole in F13 follwing with a flashlight, trolling me. But often. Like I said both are great, both have strengths, I go through phases between the two.
---
Hahaha! Tucker running from the bees with the chainsaw was the best.
---
Replace brutal strength with both. Both Nurses and BBQ are S tier compared to that mediocre perk.
---
When you loop a killer the entire game then Adrenaline pop up
---
&gt;Save in front of your face 5 seconds after you hook
---
&gt;T-bag and instaheal if you hit the saving survivor
---
&gt;Borrowed time/D-Strike if you hit the unhooked survivor
---
Yea kinda tbh
---
If only we had some sort of voting system where the community could decide what it wanted to see rather than it being forced. I don't like any of that stuff either but just downvote it, don't censor.
---
Yeah it was for old Legion, Filthy Blade then.
---
He isnt breaking any rules though, the rules say if they are mentioning other players in a bad light but he's just saying he won without any stuff on
---
What does ttv mean because my friend has itü•∫
---
matchmaking at it's finest
---
If you wanted to survive ghostface or legion 
---
If you wanted to really get that blood pumping i would say pig because it would be pretty intense trying to get the RBT off irl
---
&gt; Yeah, God forbid a survivor tries do their main and only objective as fast as possible.
---
This argument can also be applied to killers tunneling and using Moris. 
---
I only argue gen-rushing is a thing where people bring 4 purple toolboxes with socket swivels and clean rags with No Mither, Resilience, and This Is Not Happening and fly through gens super fast. 
---
IMHO generators can be completed too fast but we NEED side objectives that are "Mandatory" like having to find a breaker part for the exit gate, or needing to find something like gears, fuel. wires, etc. in chests or lying around to either initiate repairs or do repairs at normal speed (Like if you're missing certain "spare parts" you can only repair a gen to X%, or slower than normal, etc.). 
---
If we do the "part system" Brand New Part could be reworked to not be so useless. 
---
IMHO "M1 and Hit Space Simulator" needs to be more fun and engaging. We shouldn't just band-aid it by simply making generators take even longer, although an interim solution could be to buff perks like Thanatophobia etc. so killers have more options to slow the game down. 
---
In the Plague PTB IIRC they were going to buff Thanatophobia to something like 24% slow with everyone hurt. It would have been a good idea but it was reverted presumably because of shit like Legion running Thanato with Sloppy Butcher, Dying Light, etc. and making healing take forever esp with Self-Care.
---
I'd just bring back the 24% slow, but make it apply to everything BESIDES healing and bam problem solved. If survivors are scared of dying since everyone's beat up and bloody, they can't repair or do sabotage as fast since they're distracted with the injuries among them. Healing however, wouldn't be slowed.
---
It'd make sense (Better than "Oh no everyone's hurt, I can't focus and I'm too scared to even heal them") and have a hefty penalty on everything else, but if they want to remove the penalty, healing wouldn't be slowed. Viable yet still having counterplay, while not leading to super mega long heals. 
---
The only "Problem" would be if buffed thantophobia was ran on Plague since everyone would be slowed almost as much as Dying Light if they refuse to cleanse, but I see that as a strong synergy and not "gamebreaking", similar to M&amp;A Myers, Distressing + Unnerving + Overcharge Dr. Worldwide, Infectious Fright Nurse, Iron Maiden Huntress, Pop Goes The Weasel Freddy, Make Your Choice Hag, and BBQ &amp; Billy.
---
A flashlight troll is nowhere near as bad as a facecamping killer. Those things can't even be compared.
---
They're both pretty good choices for Michael. M&amp;A plus nurse's would let you sneak up on healing survivors really well. BBQ is good for keeping up pressure after a hook though
---
 I think BBQ would be best because you would help you make the most of your tier 3 evil by possibly chaining it to multiple survivors.
---
Scream is a slasher movie and it's more about Sid than it is about Ghostface. 
---
Halloween is a slasher movie and it's about Laurie and Micheal equally. 
---
Nightmare on Elm Street was a slasher and for a while it focused on Nancy as well as Freddy. 
---
Only ones I can think of that follow the pattern you mention are TCM and Child's play (to a limited degree).
---
I've gone to streams plenty of times after playing killer just to watch the vod of their reaction playing against me. 
---
I've found a couple of pretty entertaining people doing this.
---
No you dont
---
It's weird to me that it's only a day's difference.
---
I don‚Äôt know Add ons im to paranoid of using them
---
That's fair. I haven't found anyone who has truly been an asshole playing ghostface yet. And amen for the power working poorly.
---
Fair
---
entity: hey so have you... played hillbilly recently?
---
Simple and to the point I like you

We don‚Äôt talk about those sins here

Not many people run strider to be honest
---
Always run Calm spirit and you will never winne again
---
Lockers are a good bet. Get spine chill and stay out of his radius the best you can.
---
What did it take?...
---
Or right next to a safe gen.
---
I thought they removed region's ability to see blood while in feral frenzy. Does bloodhound negate that?
---
Eh pretty good lost my dog tho

r/unexpectedblackwidow

This has nothing to do with the post....just trying to push a dumb argument....shut the fuck up.
---
Legion but Suzie
---
Do you have to be like right on their ass?  Or not moving when you attack?
---
Dude don‚Äôt leak future content
---
I mean from a certain point of view, *they should know what they're getting into*. You can argue whether it's subjectively **right** or **wrong** to mori people who openly advertise their stream in your game until the sun goes out, but they should definitely know what they're getting into (because right or wrong, it is still a thing that happens).
---
Unless you're saying "you should totally deny and not know about this thing that happens", that'd be ridiculous.
---
Looks awesome! Keep up the good work!
---
Letting your kids play dead by daylight is bad parenting ? What?
---
I agree.  I still reported, to see what the devs decide or if they care at all. It's one of those grey areas where it's not certain if it's an exploit or devs being okay with it.
---
I would concede on Pig and Clown, but trapper, billy, and bubba are absolutely something more than human.
---
Dont talk to me or my son ever again
---
That sounds exactly like when dead hard wouldn‚Äôt do the animation
---
Were you playing Nea?
---
For the most part, yes. But as you get higher in the ranks you get more clever/less toxic survivors. Watch DBD Casefiles by Bricky on YouTube, a little outdated but still give  pretty good info in the killers.
---
Ummm ok... the playstyle and role of killers strongly depend on the killer, if you have a killer in mind feel free to ask, I'm a rank 1 trapper main with at least 200hrs on every killer with over 1000 on trapper himself.
---
Killers playstyle varry on the map, and the killer being played, aswell as the build your running... theres a time and a place in every match where you have to choose your priorities and these aswell as area management are 2 incredible killer factors that effect every killer... some more than others though.
---
Those are perks buddy
---
Yep.
---
Oh no it‚Äôs the build police
---
Boy you‚Äôre packing heat with that many moris.
---
Should've never brought F13 up in the first place, especially when you were gonna diss it without any legitimate points.
---
dafuq huntress "poisoned cinnamon roll?"  
---
*h u h*
---
Okay, thanks.
---
I am incredibly patient when it comes to campers.
---
Had this Leatherface try to mindgame me around a safe pallet for like 60 seconds in order to basement camp when he finally caught me later, it's all about delaying for as long as you can.
---
If I know the killer is just going to facecamp me then I can just use every pallet on the map to avoid getting hit for as possible when I otherwise would be concerned about creating a deadzone (though admittedly this only usually happens when I'm not the first caught because someone else suicided on hook due to being camped and I got found second).
---
I'm pretty sure that lag can't do that. You just pressed too early/close to the locker
---
100% agree a rocket league/cs go timeout system would stop people doing it as much there‚Äôs basically no long term down side to dcing just bp and pips both of which can be earned back in subsequent games.
---
Amazing!
---
One was a pig, but there was a Huntress, Wraith (visible), Billy and Leatherface.
---
Spine Chill has been more than sufficient for me against Spirit. But I do run Iron Will as well.
---
I don't think so, they take the fan bases concerns very serious for the most part seeing as how they removed the basement body blocking. Well even if they don't fix anything you could always disable the hook when the game starts so the killer can't exploit this.
---
Lag rubber band to a locker
---
but... if you have Ace In The Hole you'll always get add-ons, and if you don't, you'll never get them.
---
Started running small game after the point buff to totems. ez ruin cleanse
---
I had a Ghostface DC on me because they weren't in Night Shroud, I'd 99'd the gate, and the injured person they were chasing was running towards me and I bodyblocked for them.
---
Just immediately turned to face the wall, it would have only taken me 3-4 seconds to get out and I was halfway there (actually in the gate area) running and boom, disconnect. Literally the moment I got between killer and survivor they decided to pull the plug on the game, it was ridiculous.
---
Do you happen to know how to reach out to them with this video?
---
Yeah DBD should just be E for
---
Yes it does you fool, just because you cant get off the floor doesnt mean no one else can
---
Not DoodleBob? Don't talk to me or my snail ever again.
---
i can never tell what emotion jay's face is holding at any given time
---
Let's think about this. Doors opening/open, no chance to kill anybody else, she has you. What else is one expected to do? Let you get unhooked, eat borrowed time and get out?
---
Pig, Billy, Huntress, Leatherface, Wraith I've experienced this with probably more...
---
20 mins sounds like a cute duration , take 5 hours with only 8 killer games played
---
&gt;how well you entertain the entity
---
Yeah, like I said it's a great theme and I could totally see bloodpoints being based on it, I just don't think ranking/matchmaking should be impacted by theme.
---
Short for "twitch.tv". Implies they are streaming and that the rest of their name is their Twitch username.
---
Dude if you don‚Äôt control your gens dream pallets aren‚Äôt going to matter. Finding your survivors and getting them to throw them down is what you need to even make pallets work.
---
i 4k and double pip with sprit whenever i play her in red ranks LUL
---
Ah ok thank you!
---
On one hand yeah it counters Iron Will, but Stridor itself is an extremely mediocre perk.
---
I recommend trying it out.
---
If you see two survivors working on a gen on the other side of the map there is very little you can do unless you're playing a high mobility killer.
---
Don't forget Nurse's Calling
---
And even then, I wouldn‚Äôt really even call Kate ‚Äòstereotypical beauty‚Äô to be honest, not really. DBD has done a really good job of diversity, in both killers and survivors.

Sweaty killers at night.

Can confirm am both.

There‚Äôs even a pinned post, they should start handing out bans because people can‚Äôt read
---
Clown is probably not a good bet. 
---
He was a track star, who at speed-walking speed, can outrun a track star.
---
His gas is mostly unavoidable is used well, reveals you and disorientates you. Also it slows you down as you are afflicted by it.
---
He is pretty dangerous.
---
If you can't hide without the bloody clothes you don't deserve the bloody clothes.
---
If Ruin lasts five minutes than that means that it did it's job and then some. Also why Deerstalker? The perk is a decent QOL improvement, but it doesn't actually give you anything that help you win. Absolutely run Ruin.
---
You can try through their main website or social media.
---
Had played during a storm, and the power went out.
---
Came back after the power came back on, and people in the next lobby like "This guy DC's" and they all dipped.
---
I felt like such a loser.... üòî
---
Mettle Of Man had literally no counterplay for "Basic" M1 killers who can't play around it. (Wraith, Freddy, Doctor, Nurse, Spirit, I think Legion, Pig, Clown, Hag, etc.) However how much difference the extra hit makes depends on the killer. It will still ALWAYS activate even if the killer tunneled off the hook each time. If the survivor heals after being unhooked, MoM will proc on the second "Engagement" (Chase) with the killer.
---
"Advanced" M1 killers (Plague via puking to wound, Ghostface, and Myers for instadown, Trapper's traps) can play around it but require certain steps be done to avoid giving MoM enough stacks or downing from healthy.
---
Even "M2 Killers" (Huntress, Billy, also Plague with corrupt, Leatherface, etc.) can be affected by MoM. If the survivor got enough stacks by forcing out M1 hits and is injured, not even a hatchet or chainsaw hit will down them.
---
Yes one extra hit "Doesn't seem like a big deal" but an extremely good looper can get a ton of extra mileage out of the speed boost from being hit + the killer's slowdown to do the weapon wipe. By itself on one survivor it's not that big a deal but frustrating. 
---
A survivor can combo MoM with Dead Hard, Deliverance, and Decisive Strike with an instaheal and they turn into tanks. Hit, they instaheal. Hit again, swing and they dead hard. Down and hook. They yeet off the hook right in your face and fookin' dead hard. You hit them finally and Mettle Of Man lets them ignore the hit and speed boost to the next loop. Down, go to pick up, and they DS you. 
---
This scenario wasn't rare during the "Mettle Of Man Crisis." All four survivors could run MoM too meaning an M1 killer required one extra hit each on everyone.
---
The only counterplay (as in, MoM never activates) an M1 Killer had was to tunnel off the hook with a Mori, facecamp one hook state and then tunnel, or Rancor. I got pissed off enough during this time period I started running Rancor, STBFL and PWYF on Freddy to instagib at least one MoM user per match. 
---
OLD (Pre-rework) DS and OG MoM flat-out punished killers for normal gameplay. Hell I went out of my way to tunnel Ash Williams as much as possible so I can get MoM over and done with ASAP since if you didn't, chances are MoM's gonna end up proccing as you hit him on his way out of the exit gate. 
---
MoM should have been nerfed but shouldn't have been made useless like it is now. It's like Blackbeard in Siege. It shouldn't exist. Do what they did to Tinkerer and turn Mettle Of Man into an entirely different perk that has no resemblance to the old MoM.
---
ow
---
That's what I would run. Brutal Strength is decent, but BBQ and Nurse's will both give you better milage.
---
Yeah, you‚Äôd better start using addons. You get them so easily it really doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
But to answer your question... Paint Thinner is obviously the best addon for the Dream Pallet mechanic. Then I typically run either Nancy‚Äôs Masterpiece or Pill Bottle.
---
I don‚Äôt think it was lag switch, he sent me his clip too. In his I‚Äôm just standing in front of the hook and he downs me. Then I crawl away at sprint burst speed.and thank you!
---
Good Spirits don't need it because a lot of them can still track footsteps and scratch marks. It's not always guaranteed but its still do-able.
---
There are multiple people I'm confusing them together, anyways, right, spirit has a large skill gap between the floor and ceiling, just because the floor is effective enough to not incentivize rising up in skill doesnt mean the gap doesnt exist.
---
It depends since before the trials the legion was together when they did things so irl you might be up against all four too
---
I usually got against terrible ones. Even at red ranks. Maybe it's cuz I'm on console.
---
When I switch to pc I wonder if being a furry is gonna lead to me getting moried a lot
---
Would u date him?
---
So the internet was just potato? That's gotta suck regardless i've not seen that level lag a wraith match they did it intentionally.
---
I‚Äôd honestly trade dream pallets for the puddles because the puddles are more effective at doing more. For example protecting a gen or totem or basement or hook or door.
---
Perhaps- but even so, out of all the killers, the Legion would be easiest. Susie might freak out too (like when they killed the janitor), so that‚Äôs already one out of the way.
---
To be fair, I had a twitchy flashlight click and use a blendette earlier.
---
Good plays in there, thanks for not making a intro about "clicking the subscribe button" and shit.
---
"HEX: " names too.
---
Unfortunately, people who stream, especially on this game, have garnered a reputation for being assholes to create content for themselves to post. Between this and a lot of low follower streamers tend to be massive dicks just naturally has created a stereotype that tends to ring true about 7/10 times.
---
It‚Äôs not fair, but it‚Äôs been proven right enough times (probably by confirmation bias) that its a part of gamer culture now and the biases carry to any multiplayer game.
---
Look at the cute couple escaping together.
---
Pick it up on Humble Bundle it's half off right now for the next 10 days.
---
‚ÄúI can bring a mori for people who just want to play the game and stream then cry about toxic survivors after :(‚Äú
---
At yellow ranks most streamers are really nice
---
Short for twitch.tv

‚ÄúLmao where‚Äôs your chapter? And your new movie trilogy? Fucking loser.‚Äù
---
Or game bugged out in some dumb w
---
That meg part is fucking accurate. It's always thr meg heads.
---
&gt; there are killers out there that spend minutes in the killer shack loop
---
if someone spends more than 15 seconds at shack, they deserve to lose
---
Me as I put no pressure on the gens at all: they're fucking rushing me
---
Salt Mining and Hook Farming
---
Hell, Peanits (one of the community managers) actually turns up in this sub regularly- with any luck, he‚Äôll see it.
---
+1. Had a .ttv follow me the first bit of a game, flashlight clicking, teabagging, even would stop while I chased him to let me catch up, then sprint burst away. Even when I tried to ignore him, he would run in front of me and teabag some more. 
---
I never ever facecamp, but I got him in the basement and ‚Äúbroke my one rule‚Äù.
---
The only time ive dced in my 150+ hours is because of that
---
Bodyblocking is standing in the way to prevent from getting somewhere, either killer or survivor can do it depending on context. 
---
As for holding the game hostage , before EGC was introduced, some survivors would keep hiding and keeping the game going on forever. I thought that is what it was?
---
My most used phrases are
---
Nice one! /s
---
What the fuck are you doing?
---
Ah yeah just bring him over here while I'm on hook
---
GET OUT OF MY WAY!
---
I have no clue how he didn't see me
---
I have no clue how he didn't s... oh he found me
---
Where the hell did he go? *SMACK* fuck tinkerer.
---
Ouuuuu ruin!
---
Ouuuuu ruin *10 seconds later* oh it was haunted gro- *someone gets insta downed*
---
I hope there's a pallet here
---
Stop running, I need to heal you, stop running, you would have been healed by now, dude we both could have been healed by now.
---
Gen is almost done, please don't get a skill check
---
I'm going to flashlight save this game *doesn't get a single save and just pallet blinds*
---
And why is this a meme? I don't play DBD sorry, I like to watch it from time to time
---
Any dogshit player can get some in on any set of survivors as Spirit
---
Nurse is too extreme, but at the very least "mediocre" nurses get their shit pushed in by good survivors.
---
Spirit isn't NEARLY as bad as pre-nerf legion, who a deaf blind player could reach rank 1 with. But she is braindead as fuck- boring to go against to boot.
---
Killer side:
---
"Amazing game devs"
---
"How does that miss?"
---
"Oh my fucking GOD!!!"
---
Just a little bit
---
Its totally the hostage thing, if this happened before any gens popped the outcome would still be the same. The survivors have literally no play other then the last guy who does the gens and escapes. Body blocking is getting in between the killer and his target or hook. Holding the game hostage is putting the other player or players in a position where they are forced to DC or die from collapse. Before collapse this would result in a stalemate much like a hatch-standoff except the killer can leave and go watch tv or something and the suevivors can't even attempt to escape.
---
When i fucking lag into the killer for the fourth time im going to dc
---
THIS. I've been playing the game casually for two years but have only been playing DBD on my PS4. And once you start to understand the ranking system it changes how you play. I would run in and unhook other players no matter the situation thinking I was helping. But you have to look at your unhooks as safe or unsafe. Once you realize the ranking system penalizes you for unsafe hooks you become more aware. And in turn a better player.
---
I suggest reading all your rankings when you finish a match. It really helps you figure out what areas you need to improve and in doing so it makes you a better player in general. You'll see yourself surviving way more often.
---
How would you feel if you were bowling with some randoms and then one of them started handing out business cards? I'd think that was preeeetty weird personally.
---
Nah, that‚Äôs a legit strat for killers, a lot of survivors complain about it though. There‚Äôs nothing illegal about it.
---
I'm still depressed stranger things took the 13th chapter from him (still love stranger thing)
---
Actually it throws a lot of people off more than it helps.  The increased distance can screw over chasing as you gauge the survivor closer than they actually are and may misplay because of it. 
---
It can help,  but a lot of people don't run it as it can hurt you more
---
The only real way to hold the game hostage is to body block someone in a corner so that the only way they can get out of the game is to dc. Making it very hard to do gens is not holding the game hostage
---
This is the image my friend sent me after I failed getting into a sports team I trained a year for.
---
paul blart
---
Not at all. That is known as the 3-gen strat, at that point it‚Äôs the survivors fault for doing the gens so close to each other. It‚Äôs smart to do gens spread apart to prevent such an occasion. Happens rarely, and when it does, that‚Äôs pretty much a lost more or less. You did fine. I wouldn‚Äôt worry so much.
---
May want to run Thanatopia from the Nurse since it seems you like slugging (Deerstalker) it will make it that much harder for the ones you haven't downed yet.
---
Where‚Äôs my boi Fred :(
---
Ain't this a repost
---
When you're the killer, you can see everyones ping bar
---
You are completely missing the point of Ruin. There is a reason why it ones of the most used perks on every killer at all levels of play. There is a reason why it is considered almost mandatory at higher levels. The point of Ruin is to break up the first few minutes of a match, which are some of the most important, and the point of the game at which the killer is most vulnerable. Momentum is weighted heavily towards the survivors because they can just hop on a gen with nothing stopping them, and since the killer has to patrol every gen, they can often get done before they have time to even walk to the other side of the map. Ruin stops that momentum. Ruin does two main things: 1) it massively slows down the speed at which survivors are able to repair generators, and 2) it forces survivors to get off of gens to look for the totem, either way it wastes time. It doesn't matter if it only lasts for the first few minutes, because the first few minutes are the ones that it is supposed to protect.
---
then dont be surprised when u get a mori
---
Of course with any character there‚Äôs definitely room for improvement. I‚Äôm by no means perfect. However you do need to factor in there are killers who do and do not have chase flow control. Outside of standard mind games (tileset depending) not many killers can really do anything in a chase besides run at them brute force or use Bamboozle/Pallet Fury simply because their kit doesn‚Äôt allow it. And with that comes the gap in killer power because if you have little to no chase flow control you‚Äôre gonna get creamed by any team of good survivors or even if there are two good survivors. 
---
Spirit, similar to Nurse, Hag, Huntress and lessee extent Clown, don‚Äôt really give a shit about the standard chase rules. Hag needs prep time, Huntress is a bit loop dependent and Clown needs rotation mechanics, but Nurse and Spirit don‚Äôt chase people. They open the game into tile mindgames. Even in my few hours of playing Spirit still at the same rank, I‚Äôve noticed a drastic change in my games because like Hag, I‚Äôm not chasing the survivors at all. I‚Äôm recognizing the tiles they‚Äôre on and the areas they can go and making them check their knowledge of it and punishing them for walking into me/being in a bad spot. It feels fucking awesome to have this level of control. Not since I was learning Hag and got her core down did I feel like I was an actual threat vs just the spooky heartbeat guy who needed to walk around the pallets and maintain this boring ass L-T, Shack, Unmindgameable pallet rotation over and over. Actually putting the stress of chase on the survivors is way more fun because I‚Äôm actually allowed to have fun in chases again.
---
They introduced Legion perk "Mad Grit" to deal with the body-blocking complaints. They put in Collapse to stop survivors from holding the game hostage. Then changed the basement to prevent killers from standing on the stairs and holding the game hostage for the survivors in the basement. 
---
This is the same thing except upstairs instead of basement. Since BHVR changed the basement stairs to prevent this from happening my guess is its unintended and they would be very keen to hear about this (throw it in their forums) so they can fix it.
---
I assumed he was talking as a survivor, I gotta go back to playing killer. I'm playing too much Dwight üòÖ
---
Yea I might give that a go, thx for the suggestion bro
---
I was over exaggerating mate I don't get moried that much. Also I never said I was surprised, I just pointed the fact out.
---
Equips Ruin. "Now dig on this." \*Snaps fingers\*
---
If you're nothing without the suit, you shouldn't have it.
---
Okay but they were NOT forced to DC. The EGC timer ends the game, therefore it was not held hostage.
---
Hostage is when there is no other way to end the game than to DC. This was BODYBLOCKING, no hostage taking place plain and simple.
---
Like you said BEFORE egc this would've been but thanks EGC it is not. Got it? Cool.
---
Is this a Homecoming reference?
---
Poised works even if you aren't the person who finishes the generator. It's underrated.
---
Ok, thanks much more the input. It's such a rare situation though, almost comical, but also has high potential for trolling/abuse.
---
Do you even read the other comments? When did I ever say I was nothing. I just said it looks cool and helps to hide. It's like saying if I don't go perkless, I'm bad at the game. Your logic astounds me.
---
100% been saying the same thing. Nemesis was my all time favorite of the tyrants and hearing his iconic "stars" proclamation would be terrifying as hell.
---
Did people just downvote you for playing spirit?
---
Solidarity only works when not using a medkit. Like Autodidact, you gotta use your hands. But it helps to stack it with Botany/We‚Äôll Make It.

Even before Stranger Things, when ever I see a killer struggling I try to give advice for them, I suck at survivor so I stay at lower ranks, but I struggle to stay out of red ranks ask killer.
---
Lucky me I've found two of the three Quentin mains in existence. What wisdom can you bestow upon this lowly Tapp main, oh sleepy one?

Far more common that experienced killers bully survivors who obviously don't know what they're doing. Claudette isn't the one who tunnels the baby dwight for the ez early game kill, all I'm saying.
---
If a survivor with any stalk time left disconnects it will be evenly distributed among the remaining survivors. This is only only applies to disconnects.
---
why freddy and not myers
---
Dbd uses a peer to peer connection for it's hosting.
---
This makes it shockingly easy, for anyone who even vaguely knows what they are doing, to find the ip of ppl they play with.
---
As others have speculated, they probably just dos'd you. 
---
For now, anyways.
---
What others have said about resetting your router changing your ip is only partially true. Resetting your router may change your devices ip on your internal network, assuming you are using dhcp, but most service providers hand you a static ("permanent") ip on their network. At least that's how it works in the u.s. I assume it's the same in the u.k.
---
If you don't change your public/external ip, and the attacker still has it, then it's entirely possible he'll come back for more. 
---
It sounds like you aren't super tech savvy (that's not a judgement,just an observation) , so i'm guessing your router is mostly a default setup. It's not terribly difficult to gain access to most of those common consumer routers, given enough time and dedication. From there, it's possible to gain access to the devices on your internal network itself.
---
Your best bet is to make an ip change request to your service provider, and use a vpn service going forward. At the very least.
---
I'm not trying to fear monger, but you should be informed of the situation. In all likelyhood, the guy has grown bored and moved on, but who knows.

My personal rule is that if you have "ttv" in your name, im going to snipe you. That's just how it is. If you don't want to get sniped, either put your twitch name in you steam bio, or say that you stream in the pre-game or post-game chat.

I think it isn't as much about the larger streamers you mentioned as it is more about the smaller more insecure children that think being an asshole in front of their 2 and a half viewers is edgy and cool. Nothing against small streamers in general you will definitely find cool people in your lobbies just speaking majority isn't too nice in post game chat.
---
It's not a dbd thing really, just people who stream  on twitch like to advertise themselves in games. And are usually toxic.
---
Basically lol. I'm hoping to do a shoot with my gf as susie.
---
THIS IS MY WHOLE POINT. Everyone gets pissed at videogames but a little tiny bit of teabag and people can‚Äôt function. 360/ps3 era games were filled with toxicity and it never was a huge issue. If people are using exploits and harassing you thats one thing but I‚Äôve never seen teabagging have such a big effect on a playerbaseüòÇ
---
I‚Äôm pretty new to this game can someone explain this perk lol
---
People who put .ttv in their username stereotypically have some of the worst BM as survivors, which creates a vicious circle where killers will target the .ttv steamer first, doing BM tactics themselves.

Rather be safe than sorry. I don't want to play against someone who constantly spikes to 250+ ping. I also don't like playing killer Vs survivors with 250+ ping. And as killer would prefer them to leave cause I know I ain't sitting through the queue again.

Even body blocking the basement, people argue it isn't toxic so fucking often and will say, "It's a strat." As a response, "Dude literally stood at the time of the basement AFK where we couldn't get past him until we gave up and AFKed in front of him for him to chainsaw all at once as LF."

I don't hate them, I just think there are better ways to become popular.
---
I mean if my alternative as killer is getting teabagged and looped with some sweet "gg ez baby killerino" in post game chat sorry but sometimes it's just nice to know you have some chances based on character.
---
Lol what do u want BHVR to do?
---
This actually isn‚Äôt holding the game hostage since the end game timer is ticking and they are going to die eventually.
---
The thing is, that Twitch-Streamers did and still do a big part in encouraging toxicity in the game, so I can see where the general dislike is coming from.
---
Poised is God tier if you know how to loop, suddenly losing the scratch marks fuck with the killers head
---
I have lots of experience..  the way I talk has no contribution to my gameplay. Ik I may sound like a dumbass sometimes so correct me if I say stupid shit sometime  in other threads, but I play completely differently than the way I talk. And honestly you sound like you have some good experience yourself by the attention to detail your applying on a perk lol, I‚Äôm prolly just salty because my ruin gets crushed in the first few minutes and no matter what I do from that point on, I get gen rushed. You win lol.
---
Could you explain why please. Not to justify or anything I'm actually curious why people still DC against one of the worst killers right now.
---
I think the addendum is every twitch streamer you KNOW you've encountered. Only a very specific subset of people actually tag themselves as a streamer in games.
---
U 9 years old?
---
Stalls for 40 seconds looking preoccupied* 
---
Starts moving for an unhook knowing they waited too fucking long* 
---
(Gets sacrificed) 
---
Also that random: sOrRy bRo i tRiEd tO sAvE yOu
---
You hide in a locker for three seconds and when the killer is nearby you can stun them by rushing out of the locker
---
I meant more /r/withoutcontext
---
I am a rank 1 killer, I have legitimate reason to play spirit vs swf at high ranks.
---
It seems like you want it to fail, which I‚Äôm not quite understanding. Why can‚Äôt both be successful? I live in the US, and I like both. In fact, I like a lot about IV more than DBD. 
---
They have different game modes, including one with two hunters and 8 survivors, they have a new blackjack mode, which is fun and challenging, and it‚Äôs very different than typical gameplay. The survivors have their traits that are both good and bad, and they make each survivor unique, unlike on DBD, where all survivors are just skins. 
---
The survivors have items they start with, but some of them can get a different item from the chest, and there are a lot more items than just toolboxes, flashlights, and medkits. The abilities of the hunters and survivors are very unique like the spider that can spin you into a cocoon, the photographer who can damage you in a picture and it damages you in real life too, having puppets who stand by ciphers, and you can teleport to them to get survivors. Survivors can slow down or speed up time, can shoot the hunter with one bullet, rescue someone with a lasso, etc. There are a lot of unique abilities. 
---
Also you can buy rooms and have whatever survivor or hunter you want that you own to walk around while you choose your match. By just playing matches you earn clues that you use to obtain graffiti you can use in game, you can earn survivors and hunters, as well as their costumes. You can have a pet that follows you around that the hunter can‚Äôt see. 
---
They have events pretty frequently, unlike DBD, which has had maybe two events in the year and two months that I‚Äôve played it. They also have tournaments you can compete in for prizes. You can like other survivors, and after the matches, you can go and see who all played, who died, etc. The survivors all look like dolls, and the hunters are various creatures and monsters. 
---
Yes, the game mechanics are basically the same where you have 4 survivors and one hunter, and they have to fix the 5 ciphers to open a gate and escape. Other than that, everything is different. That‚Äôs like saying that any game that‚Äôs a first person shooter is exactly the same as another FPS, even though there‚Äôs more different than similar.
---
&gt; Outside of standard mind games (tileset depending) not many killers can really do anything in a chase besides run at them brute force or use Bamboozle/Pallet Fury simply because their kit doesn‚Äôt allow it. And with that comes the gap in killer power because if you have little to no chase flow control you‚Äôre gonna get creamed by any team of good survivors or even if there are two good survivors.
---
Very true. If you commit to every chase, this is how it feels.
---
But the killer role has a little more than *simply* being good at chases- it's leveraging pressure and knowing what's worth investing in. Should you chase the bright pink and neon green flashy Feng next to 2 long wall tiles + cowshed window + pig tree, or maybe ditch for a second, walk around and listen to which gens are being worked on and maybe shift aggression to that baby meg lookin' lad in the lobby?
---
To boot, once you've got 1 or 2 people off gens, you can invest time to squashing out strong tiles by forcing the pallets to be spent with either a trash or good survivor, creating larger and larger deadzones on the map to leverage against survivors.
---
You can plan ahead which gens you don't mind getting popped (one gen in the far corner of the map halfway done at start of match? Good. Finish it 5 seconds before I down and hook this survivor I'm chasing)
---
Of course, if every survivor in the match is great at using tiles, not dropping pallets, and quick to get right back on gens if you move in their area, and commit to popping gens that are bunched up (and removing leverage/ map control from your hands) that's unfortunate. Survivors win and that's fine in an assymetric party horror game that has an unbelievable amount of RNG involved.
---
But there are times I'm playing surivor, even killer, I notice and recognize when killers are making "bad investments". Even things like choosing to *slug* a survivor and get a free hit on their teammate that's in a deadzone- maybe even LETTING the slugged survivor get picked up (and returning to said deadzone with knowledge of where 1 injured and 1 healthy survivor is almost exactly)
---
See what I mean? Lots of stuff that kinda seems unintuitive but you see really good killers employ. There's also smaller tricks, like mindgames you can do on certain tiles, cutting corners tighter without slowing down, more refined moonwalks/ timings to powers, deliberate zoning techniques and cutting bad habits (like choosing left when running L+T walls)
---
Too often killers get looped in Asylum, have 5 gens popped in their face, and blame the game for being unbalanced and forcing them to use overkill builds. Not knowing how much they COULD have played differently to offset the major weaknesses or killers or exploits certain maps have. (fuck haddonfield + balanced landing)
---
I love friendly killers just vsed a leather face that was from Japan and he fucken camped the entire game after he hooked someone and literally stood right next to the hook. I reported him and so did everyone else and I‚Äôm making shit post about him soon so everyone gets him banned ü§† because he pathetic
---
Just use Monster Reborn to bring the survivors back then use Pot Of Greed to restock your hand then again you probably don't k ow what Pot Of Greed does since most don't.
---
I had someone do this for me today! I only started about 5 days ago and someone typed advice for me as the killer rather then ‚Äúlol gg ez boring game‚Äù or ‚Äúimagine being bad‚Äù I‚Äôve experienced both üôÉ so I thank you!
---
Idk why you're being downvoted, after the EGC update that is pretty much the only way to hold a game hostage
---
If they are going to either bleed out or die to collapse the devs don‚Äôt care, it‚Äôs not holding the game hostage as long as they die somehow.
---
Use we're gonna make it or whatever David's perk is called
---
Nice use of the god pallet lol
---
This must be a sign from the entity
---
He could big brain and run devour hope or rancor
---
Thank you for posting! Nobody cares!
---
Dude he was just trying to fact check that
---
yeah, but not our fault for their only being 3 viable killers at high ranks, so there's no reason to bitch at against a spirit if you're in the red ranks, it should be expected because the devs only made 3 viable strong killers. So if you're in red rank don't be surprised
---
Where spirit at?
---
I was scrolling through reddit looking for good porn to jack off to but couldn't help myself and had to take the time to appreciate it and upvote
---
I‚Äôm a noob don‚Äôt judge me üòÇ
---
Just because we want to win doesn't mean we're sweaty, its just the other weak killers aren't viable at high ranks
---
I can't see what you are referring to.

Meanwhile i leave if i join a lobby with a brightly colored character that readies up instantly in fear of the fucker that got us farmed with no fucks given, The Same happened to my brother but at least that was somewhat discreet, meanwhile we're being unhooked, hit, rehooked and downed again. "Thomas has never seen such bullshit in his life" Makes it a bit worse when my friend was a baby jake and didn't exactly know what was happening until the last hook
---
I‚Äôm sorry..
---
*unzips*
---
Are ps4 players getting double blood points while the PTB is out for PC?
---
 No what your doing called three gen defense, it a common strategy for Doctor mains. Taking the game hostage is something like standing in the middle of the stair case to the basement and blocking the survivors from exciting for like twenty minutes.
---
It's been changed now. It basically said that they were wrong on the date (it was never officially released by the devs, people got it through data mining), and the date has now been postponed.
---
Pig main. Yep this is it.
---
Like I said, I don‚Äôt DC. I just find his whole setup annoying. I realize he has no map pressure and has to substitute that with slowing things down with ‚Äúmadness‚Äù and such. It‚Äôs just not a fun match for me. I still play and probably win more than I lose but I‚Äôd rather play against other killers. It‚Äôs like Corrupt Intervention, all it does is make most games 2 minutes longer.
---
Same. I‚Äôd rather just play a good killer and make 60-90K BP with BBQ and a pudding or streamers and just keep refreshing those until its someone not as annoying to use in high ranks.
---
She's not *strong* though. She gets downs semi consistently, similar to how pre-nerf legion you always had guaranteed downs "in a matter of time" with almost no effort required.
---
Against those groups I choose Huntress or Hillbilly- there is a ton of back and forth, reads, counterplay, borderline "hilarious" set of events.
---
Spirit on the other hand is cut and dry. Straightforward. You don't outplay and you don't get outplayed. Throw random shit at the wall and ~70% of the time it sticks.
---
Believe it or not, even with the existence of strong tile setups and broken structures simple M1 killers like Wraith or Leatherface can still chew through maps, apply zoning/ pressure, and work the game into an area that's easy to control. It takes experience of knowing how to shut chases down on certain tiles, what areas/ chases are not worth investing in, intuition on where survivors are and what gens they're working at (it's okay to let them pop that far off corner generator) and where players are moving to and from.
---
People just don't know where they're making mistakes, and think the game is fundamentally broken because they got looped on asylum for 5 gens as Piggy. I was there too.
---
yeah honestly, it doesn't have to be anything special, just a small nudge that "hey we appreciate you for dealing with the old system and like that you like our game this much" would be really nice
---
Thanks.
---
I agree.
---
Max the Swing!!! That‚Äôs 100% needed especially if someone tries and jukes you.
---
Yea to really hold the game hostage you‚Äôd have to either somehow bodyblock everyone (such as on the basement stairs if you were able to catch them all down there), or work with the other survivors to grief someone
---
I don't play spirit (only for dailies) but this rework will just turn her into another B-C tier garbage which is a joke at high ranks. Alerting survivor when she uses phase by that footsteps sound is enough
---
The middle bus window and cabin window on autowreckers have been bugged for ever, and I've seen two more in the last 3 games I played.
---
Half is an exageration, but they're definitely increasing for some reason.
---
So dont play something you enjoy because other people dont like it? Screw that I play to win, dont like it? Find a way to stop it.
---
Gotta realize when ur just being bitter, let ppl advertise their stream if it makes them happy, doesnt mean you gotta do it too
---
I mean yes and no... one is a multi dimensional being that can alter spacetime as we know it and the other is essentially a parasite.
---
Jake main. Well, till Steve shows up
---
I actually love this idea from a lore standpoint, prayer beads remove sound from the "real world" and transfer it to the "spirit world"
---
I can hear it now: 
---
Frank: *Now we're going to--*
---
Julie: * Get back in the kitchen, Frank*
---
F: *Y-yes dear...*
---
It means he's good at his role even though he's new to the game. 
---
Now relax grammar police.
---
I‚Äôll bite. I don‚Äôt like it very much at all and I HATE playing against the Spirit sometimes, that‚Äôs just way too much. 
---
Collision on phase removed? Maybe. 
---
No directional sound when phasing for injured survivors? Butchers her ability if there‚Äôs a vault or pallet or wall now you have a 50/50 or less if they manage to have iron will to find them or they escape. 
---
No invisibility while phasing? So a short burst melee attack that you need to pause yourself to do that gives the survivor ample time to set up and position themselves to avoid a hit easy, think Pig lounge there‚Äôs too many obstacles for that power to be nearly as effective. 
---
Honestly butchering the spirit this far is the last possible direction I hope they go, they knee jerk nerfed Freddy and it took 2 years to fix him. Why should another killer that people potentially spent hundreds of hours and millions of blood points on to make viable become D Tier? Legion was fundamentally flawed from the get go and instead of fixing his addons and adjusting his abilities to be capable yet skill dependent or fair they also got neutered entirely. 
---
I‚Äôm all for slight adjustments to kits and making things more fair and balanced so that skill comes into the game when you do get a down or sacrifice or escape but then we look at someone like Nurse who literally ignores walls, pallets, windows, floors, ceilings, and has insane map pressure and she remains untouched. Hillbilly has a piss easy insta down and incredible map pressure and can eat pallets for breakfast and is noticeably superior to most killers for a reason. If we keep nerfing new killers to the ground were just gonna have another year of Hillbilly fest on console and Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress on PC it makes the experience stale having 14 or whatever killers and only seeing 2.
---
I don‚Äôt even care I‚Äôm gonna play her just cause it‚Äôs Nancy fucking Wheeler.
---
This has been in Game since it launched. It's a limiter for the host advantage on Killer by making a double check for grabs, or most Killer/Survivor interactions.
---
When clicking M1 as Killer the game checks to see if a Survivor is holding M1 for an action. If true the Killer is teleported into position and starts the grab animation. But just as the animation starts the game does another check for the Survivor still holding M1. It true, you grab. If false, you just swing even though the grab animation clearly started.
---
This gives Survivors a moment to react to the Killer and limit the host advantage of P2P. Even a basic lunge attack has a double check system. First checks for a Survivor in range to end the lunge, then checks again for damage once the attack starts after a brief moment post lunge. This is why Sprint Burst or any speed boost allows you to run out of an attack. It isnt I-frames, you are running out of range between the lunge ending and damage done.
---
Being on the hook gives you time to check your phone and stuff tho
---
bruh moment
---
## bruh üôåüôåüôåüëåüëå
---
Pop and bamboozle are pretty good perks I would recommend as soon as you get good with bottles he goes from trash killer to ok killer but it honestly depends on your play style
---
This isn't holding the game hostage it's a douche move but not holding the game hostage.
---
It's been setting multiple times as long as the survivor is on a timer that is not consider holding the game hostage.
---
This means you are allowed to block people so you can get end game kills or reverse bear trap kills
---
Sad thing is killer mains on this sub try to justify this behavior.
---
when it said TTV in there i thought it was a fortnite meme when i don't even follow r/FortNiteBR
---
Oops I‚Äôll fix it next time I didn‚Äôt know there was a new rule
---
Yeah for real, spine chill kills any spirit mindgame
---
honestly prefer playing against 4 man swf, they're usually easier to deal with on nurse then the solo selfish stealth builds.
---
I guess I check the answer to what Im about to say myself but I am not at home atm but ill ask anyway does 100% brightness not make the game too bright? to where it doesnt feel like a dark spooky- ish game or does it still look pretty dark?
---
If youre following what I mean haha, if its just a preference for you then thats understandable and thankyou for your reply but I will definitrly change the other settings and possibly test the brightness.
---
Don‚Äôt forget Hexy
---
Thanks I didn‚Äôt know
---
You can still phase invisibly though
---
lol how? Keys cant get everyone out unless gens are repaired. A mori is so much more op compared to a key.
---
Lucky you, I have 3 of those for Nurse. On xbox mind you.
---
Honestly nancy's actress is quite the looker, I plan to make her my new female survivor main. Her perks are just a bonus. Steve comes in at a hot second behind the real dad, Ace.
---
Is not taking the game hostage because the survivors have a timer attached to them if they didn't did it would definitely be considered taking the game hostage.
---
Whether you like it or not that's how it works the same thing goes for a pig that body blocks you when you have a reverse bear trap that's active.
---
Worst case scenario you could probably peg this for griefing but it is not holding the game hostage
---
I am not proud to say that I got that achievement and do my Bubba dailies over many, many, many basement Bubbas. Only viable way to use his power.
---
True. I am gay and love to mori
---
Song? I‚Äôm not too good with keepin up with the times
---
The most important thing is to be looking behind you a lot, seeing where the killer is give you a huge advantage. You also need to learn how to cut corners on loops well, as well as to always get as much from a loop as possible. Dont just sit next to a pallet if not necessary, they are a limited resource.  Your reaction time is really important as well, if you think a killer will go around a well as you're about to vault you should probably not vault it. These are the basic but you could probably find out about some good looping routes on youtube.
---
r/dbdgonegay
---
‚ÄòNuff said. Don‚Äôt go there.
---
its a game mechanic idk what your complaining about. Its actually good when a survivor flashes you behind a pallet. Its time there wasted not running away.
---
In a corner, by herself, because she‚Äôs less fun to play against than old legion.
---
I like Ruin, BBQ, Enduring and Spirit Fury personally.
---
PainReliever is really good to. He does commentaries where he actually explains why he‚Äôll do things
---
Strongly agree.
---
1000th upvote, youre in hot

Bond is an under rated perk.

Spirit because I would use the power of white privileged to send her back to the kitchen
---
Why do all these survivor mains want to butcher one of the only viable killers?
---
You‚Äôre right. It‚Äôs been a while since I‚Äôve played and I really like that endgame addition. Thank you!
---
Survivor mains that teabag on pallet clicking flashlight and trying to burn my eyes everytime possible deserves nothing else than die on hook and i dont give a fuck About your opinion. I let you be unless youre not toxic fuck in first place.
---
Misses the stun: **OOOHHH I BOTCHED IT. AHHH YUP, THATS A BOTCHED LOCKER-STUN. OOHH LEMME PLUG UP THE WOUND WITH SOME GARBAGE**
---
Thats a pretty weak excuse to avoid saying: I'm desperate for viewers and content so please come watch my stream. I dont want to be advertised to by some random with a spongelike personality while im playing a game thanks.
---
You guys don't seem to realize because of the clowns weight, the momuntum of his weight makes his body swing forward faster, making him very fast
---
Dbd is poorly optimized. Try restarting the game, that's what works for me.
---
You forgot that he roasted Morpheus
---
Oh i see your just a cunt.
---
Left handed survivor
---
20 percent more glitches
---
extra time because everything has to be figured out reverse for them
---
It‚Äôs just a product of being basic af. They don‚Äôt actually have a personality they‚Äôre just copying everything they think they‚Äôre supposed to be doing without actually giving it a second thought. It‚Äôs boring and I honestly don‚Äôt even want to camp these people anymore I just feel bad for their need to be such a way.
---
Feel free to keep denying your own failures entirely and instead blame the game, see where that gets you
---
Pip, not bp.
---
Why do you have to play as someone prestiged?
---
That hook upstairs was a massive mistake. So many opportunities to do shit like this. I cant' believe they have NEVER fixed this spot, 3 years later.
---
I want my human chili damn you &gt;:V
---
Please make some for the rest of the killers and survivors
---
It's like WGLF, but better in every way.
---
What changes are coming
---
Keep basing your opinions on people above devotion 5 and see where that gets you
---
Never!!! Try rabbit stew, I heard it tastes pretty good
---
I love the perk but it‚Äôs honestly annoying how much time people waste on attempting poorly executed baits. Especially when they‚Äôre trying to give a notification with quick and quiet like bruh.
---
Yeah WGLF needs a bit of a change
---
It really is. Also, how come BBQ gets a bonus perk on top of bloodpoints, but WGLF gets nada. I play both sides. But seriously BBQ is definitely two perks in one.
---
i hate streamers that are purposefully toxic and have ttv in their name. it‚Äôs like they want people to go over to their chat and give them a hard time. like wtf
---
i‚Äôm a streamer myself, and when i stream, i‚Äôll put the ttv in my name. but that‚Äôs just cuz i‚Äôm small and want to find more people in the community to play with and have fun. being toxic is like, not in my books at all
---
Ur pulling facts out of your ass if u think a gen can be finished in 40 seconds in high competitive play or by swfs. If u knew two things about this game maybe u would realise good swfs put survs on all different gens to create pressure not all pack onto one gen like noobs
---
Give her some boobs, and hips, and post it to /r/dbdgonewild and I'll follow you until the world burns
---
OPs point was that they couldn't do anything but run the killer, so they can't balance their time. Only option would be to get intentionally caught early and hope you aren't camped.
---
Human is the best tasting meat,Bubba wants that meat
---
Well they are constantly optimizating the game's FPS to perform faster and smoothly. The X has 60 frames per second while the original does not. My guess they'll focus on the Xbox X version since it isn't as limited.
---
What do you mean
---
Not true
---
Sure, bud
---
"just get good at the game bro" /s
---
What did they use and what rank
---
No. Just dont. Shes alright as she is. Shes not too strong or too weak if you ask me.
---
Highly debatable. 
---
Killers can make it to red ranks that aren‚Äôt high tier. Sure they can. With perks and enough mistakes by survivors anything can make it to rank 1. It‚Äôs can they play consistently well against a stacked team or not? Because that‚Äôs when you start to see a huge difference. Some games you‚Äôll be in a rank 1 lobby and it seems like all 4 survivors are either brain dead or got carried really far and their strong link wasn‚Äôt on. Other games you‚Äôll see all 4 using god tier looping skills, cooperation, communication, perks, and items that will make playing a C tier or lower killer feel like punching yourself in the balls over and over again. 
---
I‚Äôve gotten to rank 1 as Doctor for 2 years but I know that he has his limits and if I‚Äôm in a fully stacked GOOD survivor team in red ranks I‚Äôm doubtfully going to have a good time.
---
Where's GF????
---
It feels kinda unfair IMO. BBQ has a secondary effect that's always good. Even if all 3 other survivors predict the BBQ and hop in a locker, that still slows the game down. WGLF only provides the BP bonus, and it's much harder to get a stack.
---
Theres no better shortcut to learning game than quitting game and watching that game from opponents perspective if he is live. If you click on videos, current stream will be available immediately and you just go 15ish minutes before the end to watch the game you just played against them.
---
Like is there a gameplay mechanic I‚Äôm missing here because my Bt Timer is active and I got downed on the hit
---
Well, yes, but they'll also probably just get another kill if the rest of your team doesn't know he's there and camping, either. I usually play solo queue and no one seems to know what waving your arms to indicate a camping killer means.
---
Cannibal and Legion arent really that viable or good for that matter. Nor is Wraith.
---
Honestly hahahaha, these new players coming in and crying about OP swfs without actually learning how to play properly.
---
Make your choice, probably.
---
Red ranks and they used stridor, BBQ, Ruin, PGTW or Sloppy (alternated between)
---
Welp I hope the x goes on sale soon
---
I don‚Äôt think you have eyeballs... look that the screen
---
Hopefully
---
No exposed
---
Y‚Äôall need to just hug and get along this ain‚Äôt fight club it‚Äôs a gaming community be joyful with eachother and don‚Äôt let a petty argument about a video game impact a positive discussion. Bringing rank or accusations of personal skill into a debate is always the go to response for anyone with an opinion on here. (Both y‚Äôall be nice)
---
And I was the one on the hook...
---
So, you... play the game like any other survivor who plays runner? Got it.
---
I faced a TTV survivor the other day, he wasnt good to be honest.
---
thats why MLGA is nice tbh, its WAY better at knowing the ping to players and I only ever love my friends incase I get into games with them
---
Borrowed time only works on the person you unhooked.
---
It's yet another old bug that the Devs have neglected.
---
EXACTLY this. It‚Äôs legitimately 50/50 on whether or not you get hit at a pallet/vault when she uses her power. The Killer player just has to get lucky and guess correctly which side you‚Äôre on. It‚Äôs not fun for either player.
---
Are you gunna look at the picture?
---
At the edge of the exit gate, just a couple steps from leaving, got a little cocky and checked my phone before leaving. Literally not even a few seconds i look up and i was downed by the Hillbilly's chainsaw. Before i could crawl out, he grabbed me, hooked me, and i died
---
Yeah I‚Äôm sure they won‚Äôt replace my items either unfortunately I‚Äôll probably get the same response as last time
---
Killers perspective https://1drv.ms/v/s!AjvGxd22bKvtgyziCs8AIKyw2Ak3
---
I oh see messed up, sorry
---
No /s man, fuck this game. But sometimes it's worth it to play.
---
Man you are not fun and unhealthy for the game. Its the same thing with freddy and legion. They get nerfed to the ground because the survivors thought it was "too op" and "not fun". Who the fuck goes to a serial killer and says they are not fun. No shit, their job is to kill you, not make you have fun. You can still have fun if you outplay a spirit. And from personal experience, outsmarting a killer is the best feeling in the world.
---
Nurse isn't that bad either, she kinda just snapped because of her poor work situation.
---
The problem I have with them is that they usually try to be as toxic as possible just for the "laughs" meanwhile having 5 viewers and 3 of them are rest of their SWF party. Constant teabagging, flashlight clicking, toxicity in postgame chat. That's my experience with most of the TTV players so don't by surprised why many people don't like playing against them. 
---
Of course I'm not saying all do that, I have zero problems if the guy is just trying to promote their stream and not being an asshole, but little advice. 
---
I used to do YouTube content. Yes I know it's little bit different than streaming but I can tell you I've never promoted by channel somehow, I just didn't like the idea of changing my name everywhere to my YouTube channel (many people do that). And I can tell you my 1 300 subscribers with people coming to watch my content not because they saw my name, but because they found it on YouTube, felt much better because of how I earned them.
---
By the way I stopped doing YT content back in 2014 so altough I'm not saying 1 300 is a lot, it was definitely not bad back in the day. I was even making some money out of it.
---
No dumb ass, using a decent toolbox and hitting all greats (which is hard at all) is easily under 40 seconds
---
Cannibal and Wraith I've seen slay in red ranks *with the right add ons* 
---
Never a legion post-nerf though, sadly
---
Full Hex Spirit with the addon that makes you go super fast in Spirit mode, each time you hear a Thrill of The Hunt notification you rush to the totem and try to grab the survivor  
---
Fruit Ninja everything, Mad Grit, Agitation, Play with your Food and Iron Grasp, to have super fast attacks while carrying a survivor and chase the others ones trying to bodyblock, save, or just being near
---
All these came to me from Hybrid Panda
---
No. Give it up. Its a bad idea. You are fixing shit that doesnt need fixing. Its like putting duct tape over a boarded up spot. Its already good, why are you wasting time.
---
So? I was literally a foot away and he hit me anyway.
---
What if the rabbit was raised like a human and went to school, got a job, then had a family. Is it human enough?
---
The perk was there two weeks ago. The last time it was there was 6 months ago or so. Just buy the character, it's a good perk just for the bloodppoints. They had to make it OP by revealing auras too.
---
Nice.
---
Iron will solves the problem. 
---
Collision check makes her more accessible for weaker players as otherwise she is not worthy wasting time
---
None if you have no experience in killers. Basically play them all atleast once and pick one you like the most. After that find who you want to learn next and feed all the blood points into them until you unlock all their teachables. I started with trapper he was easy to learn until higher ranks
---
Kira Yoshikage: *happiness noises*
---
because head canon
---
Poor Billy just wants to farm and some edgy teenagers are still coming to his little farm meanwhile teabagging, dropping pallets on his head, flashlight clicking and so on. I'd be pissed too to be fair.
---
It doesnt even let u start now
---
I had a survivor that was constantly pointing out where their teammates were to me as killer, so I not only hooked her every time instead, I also saw them in a later lobby when I switched to survivor and was pleased to watch them die again
---
With one person... yeah sure it is bud
---
Trapper is ripped and Billy and Bubba have fucking chainsaws. No thank you.
---
The Ink that appears when Henry his hit in BATIM will be incorporated, however not as a Perk. Can't give anymore details then that sadly without spoiling things. :P
---
It's the same type of person who demands safe spaces
---
So you don't think the experience of playing as a killer will change much as you level them up? My fear is that there's a killer that's lackluster at the beginning but gets *really* good once you get some of their later perks. I would be happy to learn that's not the case.
---
And werent u just talking before about ruin which would negate the great skill check thing üßê
---
Well at least for me, I will rarely check you out if you send a message about it isnce those messages are often/always extremely cheesy.   
---
Just casually have it in your name if you ask me.
---
I‚Äôd smashüòÇüòÇ
---
Alright so, once you level any character (survivor or killer) to level 30, 35, 40 (respectively) their 3 perks become reachable through the bloodweb to all other characters. For survivors, if you‚Äôre playing alone, I recommend leveling up Claudette first because she has a perk that can heal yourself which is helpful for solo queue. Otherwise, Meg, nea, and feng (for lithe). Becuase they have decent perks. I don‚Äôt play killer too often but BBQ and chili on leatherface is a good teachable to learn for everybody, as well as hex: ruin on hag, nurse‚Äôs calling from the nurse, maybe even discordance from legion. But that‚Äôs Just from a survivor main ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è did that make any sense? And have any questions about it?
---
Yeah, I feel like everyone needs to ask themselves before calling for a nerf is "is it stronger than nurse/billy?" If not, no nerf needed.
---
To be honest, at the start you should pick a character whose base power you like the most, because that's what's most important at the start. But don't level them up more than you need to (needing to meaning, unlocking enough non-teachables to have a still fun and playable game) 
---
As you play that killer that you enjoy with the base powers that you enjoy, along with the non teachables, use the bloodpoints you use from *those* games to level up the killer whose perks you want to unlock the teachables for, so your fave killer can have those perks too. 
---
I hope that made sense. I've been awake for almost 24 hours now.
---
Honestly, just play someone until you think you've got a good understanding of how to play them. Don't worry too much about the perks right now, maybe try and get them to at least 10 so you have 3 perk slots to use though
---
NOED, Make Your Choice, Haunted Grounds, and Iron Maiden on either Ghostface or infinite tier 3 Myers.
---
They are changing this in 3-4 weeks
---
I'd say play a good 20 games... mess around with some builds, try some maps try some different strats and get some idea of the usage and utility of the killers power....
---
Just for new players, I have every killer maxed out P3 lvl 50 so I know who i do and dont like, and where and when I dont like them.
---
When you need a fucking add on to make a killer viable. How fucking much of a joke is that. Bubbas chainsaw hits no1 ever without add ons, wraith barely gets anything done without add ons, legions just bad because BEhavior decided it was ok to slam the nerf hammer down cause they didnt know what to do with him. Now hes just an another trash tier killer which goes blind when he uses his ability. His ability slows the game down but it doesnt really help you locate survivors because the speed is not enough to go to said survivor when Killers instinct is active. And the game punishes you for using the normal attack button successfully. "Oh you hit a survivor? Yeah go fuck yourself. Frenzy went back halfway." My point is that some killers need a full rework or atleast a bit of a buff to make them viable. Cannibal def needs a rework, Legion should be able to see blood during frenzy and frenzys speed/duration should go up a little bit. (Duration probably since if we increase the speed its just going to be the day 1 release back in action) With wraith, idk. Hes pretty trash all things considered but hes not impossible to use. His ding dong bell is just so easy to hear and you wont surprise anyone.
---
Awesome is there any way I can read up on this
---
And then the swing is delayed so it misses anyway
---
Might be in like 1 depending on the ptb
---
Exactly. When a killer becomes old freddy tier bad or worse than legion, i would def say they need a buff.
---
**especially killer shack
---
Throw in a NOED to really piss em off
---
Public test build
---
That quentin looked more like he realsied blood warden and started memeing,
---
You‚Äôre trying way too hard to make points that aren‚Äôt concrete. They are YOUR personal opinion. If you‚Äôre upset with the killer and REFUSE to take any tips or hints or perks to aid you agains the killer then there‚Äôs literally no helping you. The game gives you tools to win and you say ‚ÄúLmfaooooo fuck iron will to use it against 1/15 killers?‚Äù I guess you‚Äôre not used to the red ranks but iron will is part of the meta perks for a reason it helps you a fuck ton against every killer. Being able to be injured and not make a sound means you‚Äôre not getting tracked by sound at all anymore by 15 killers that also use sound as a tracking tool? 
---
Spine chill is a god send against things like Tinkerer, Wraith, Spirit, Myers, Literally any killer when you don‚Äôt have full awareness of the killers actions or where abouts. 
---
If somehow Spirit was SOOOOO flawless and perfect then she wouldn‚Äôt get beaten by me using No Mither and 1 SWF teammate in Rank 1 lobbies. Nurse literally IGNORES PHYSICAL OBJECTS and destroys looping entirely and she‚Äôs fine? Spirit is a slow ass killer in between her phasing she has NOTHING going for her. You can ‚Äúfake phase‚Äù but a smart survivor can and does figure out when a spirits able to phase or not by their movements and if they‚Äôve just recently phased or not. Did the phase to your location? Then you‚Äôve got 10 seconds to waste her time as a Hag speed killer. I‚Äôve listed 5 counters to her including instructions. Do you need video demonstrations?
---
wolves
---
Hiveminds, echochambers and circlejerks. The Holy Trinity of reddit. They say ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs because of ‚Äòthese‚Äô streamers were toxic.‚Äù They never want to know that not everyone does that and shouldn‚Äôt be thrown under the same blanket. ‚ÄúB-bUt TheY aRe aLl LiKe tHaT.‚Äù Its as dumb as the surv/killer war.
---
Oh and you dont have to play as a character to level them up. Find the killer/survivor you want to play as, use them and spend the earned bloodpoints on the characters you want the teachables of. I played as Freddy the entire time I leveled up other killers (175 total levels lol) the entire time he was a lvl 7 and I was still taking out rank 2-8's with one perk. Again you win some you lose some. Its points either way.
---
I reckon this will happen a lot more once dedicated servers get implemented, since there will be another delay in communication with the servers.
---
Unless a different method for validating grabs is implemented. I still think one side will often end up feeling robbed.
---
Lets being Back instablinds and old BNP's but to balance it we make them rarer /s
---
I mean...it took them forever just to add the hook upstairs.
---
Bill or Feng, those seem to attract the most toxic survivors lately.
---
I KNOW, its like how am i even swinging i dont have the weapon out lmao and after the swing ur still in treatment, its definitely glitchy.
---
I always hug the walls and etc but yeah I guess so about it not being worth it
---
Because of exploited addons and moonwalking having zero counter play. üò≠ 
---
Meaning that every single time a legion got their free hit that was spammable that also moved them faster and made there be literally not a single thing to do. Spirit there‚Äôs options. Use them or you‚Äôre doomed to fail.
---
Thanks other Dwight
---
Or we could just not care if they have ttv in their names
---
Rather find some dudes ig -&gt; discord.
---
That's a bannable offense for twitch btw
---
Yeah, repairing, cleansing, unhooking, sabotaging and exit-gates-opening survivors can be healthy, vaulting survivors have to be injured to be grabbed.
---
It's a good hook, don't get me wrong. Previously, unless the basement's there, you'd be fucked, right? But they fixed one thing and left another unfixed, so they went two steps forward, one step back.
---
i like all ideas
---
It's due to the language differences. In the US we say "September 3rd, 2019" mm/dd/yyyy. A lot of other places would say "The 3rd of September, 2019" dd/mm/yyyy. Also d/m/y makes so much more sense as it scales up, but idk man America is fucking weird. And that's coming from an American, lol
---
You can grab it on cdkeys for like 5Eur.
---
Yeah sometimes you just wanna force the break to get more distance or back to another pallet
---
WOKE
---
that‚Äôs what i love her for (:
---
That was a big help, thanks! I actually started buying the DLC because I wanted to play as Ash; then I figured I'd probably want them all eventually so I just went and bought them all before the sale ended. I tried playing as Ash, though, and his perks didn't seem to be getting any use so I haven't used him in a while.
---
&gt;Its the same thing with freddy and legion
---
Old freddy was horrible for new players, but weak competitively. I think the rework is amazing- addresses all facets of his annoying strengths but blatant weaknesses.
---
I would SERIOUSLY argue old Freddy was *less fun* than the clearly stronger new Freddy, simply because of the nature of how sleep state slowed gens down but how he could walk up/ hump you for a free hit if he has terror radius reducing perks/ add-ons.
---
**OLD LEGION???** Don't- don't even go here. Don't even *hint* that old Legion was okay. He's the exact problem Spirit is like halfway down; Killer that is too easily accessible and guarantee winning a chase with, but not exactly overtly *strong*. He had just *zero* counterplay. It was almost game killing levels of horrible, only offset by the fact that DC'ing is a thing and people had enough self respect to see that Legion's gameplay was boring as shit.
---
Billy and Huntress are the two most fun killers to go against.
---
--------------------------
---
**I believe that.** That is my opinion that I can argue till kingdom come. I'm not some survivor main pleb who wants easy killers to bully- I play for the league of interactions, the human behaviour, the reads, the counter play, CHASES, making team plays-
---
Billy and Huntress facilitates interesting behaviour, counterplay, all while keeping them an ACTIVE threat at all times.
---
That's how killers SHOULD be. THIS IS WHAT FREDDY FALLS MORE IN LINE WITH! He can apply pressure all game and though his new powers are less chase specific, he introduces more *goals* and choices for players to make and introduces interesting behaviour you can learn as the match progresses.
---
Like think about how interesting his power is- you can reset your sleep timer failing a gen skillcheck, but now he knows you're on it and can TP to gen. But not only that, he can *fake* the tp and surprise them from a new angle.
---
That shit doesn't exist with Spirit. That didn't exist AT ALL with pre-change Legion.
---
&gt;You can still have fun if you outplay a spirit
---
So you're one of these gamers who think a spirit has any counter
---
You know that episode of always sunny in philly where they are doing the game show? You know when Dennis is doing his section and whenever he hears the buzzer he flinches to the point where he falls down to the ground and scream "THIS DOESN'T REPRESENT ME!!" Replace the buzzer with a gen being completed sound and you have me.
---
Yeah, I noticed that as a while, and I think it's a great idea. Having to play as a lvl 1 character when everyone else is level 50 or whatever is always lame, so I'm glad they don't require that.
---
Trying to facecamp with doctor because I was a yellow killer vs. Purples and reds. Instead of spamming my melee with treatment mode to instantly grab survivors, I was spamming the shock, which has a window you can rescue the hooked survivor. Guess what happened next. Got better at facecamping tho, after that match I did it 3 more times successfully to make up for that first f up. Just give me yellows man.
---
Technically not a reportable offense on the killer‚Äôs part. Holding the game hostage is keeping anyone from playing the game and wasting large chunks of time. This just seems to be him using an unfortunate game mechanic to finish off a match. The game didn‚Äôt take longer than it should have, and he didn‚Äôt use any bugs or cheats to perform this. Just poor level design. 
---
If he‚Äôs trapped you all up there before EGC happened though and just kept you stuck there for 10-20 minutes or something, that definitely would be reportable!
---
Like I've always said, Moris are the price for self advertisement and also a way to entertain streamer's viewers
---
Thanks I'll try to work on my grabs!
---
Good to know, thank you
---
Say sike right now
---
No Mither + Self Care is always a winner.
---
Killers should care about survivor fun because matchmaking already takes forever for killers, and they keep getting longer because survivor isnt as fun as killer. If you wanna play killer there needs to be people having fun on the otherside so that there is an otherside to play against.
---
&gt; you‚Äôre not used to the red ranks but iron will is part of the meta perks for a reason
---
Bruh
---
&gt;Spine chill is a god send against things like Tinkerer, Wraith, Spirit, Myers, Literally any killer when you don‚Äôt have full awareness of the killers actions or where abouts.
---
I've run it for a bit when I was learning survivor, stopped running it cause I picked up on general game sense/ intuition. If you're not able to know where the killer is 90% of the time you're still new and learning (or it's a ghostface/ hag)
---
Mmmh good good, can we do worse? I mean, istead of an useless perk, is there one that debuff the crap out of you?
---
First: y u mad, it's clearly a jojo reference.
---
second: let me lube up first and make sure you have those heels on.
---
No Mither is a shoe-in. Bond, autodidact, and head-on maybe? I mean, if you're going to meme, I would just run sprint burst with balanced landing and lithe
---
I mean that‚Äôs like saying let‚Äôs not let nurse teleport through objects. Only in straight lines. It defeats the purpose of her ability. 
---
If you think spirit is easy that‚Äôs not true. Phasing can completely make you lose the survivor even if they are injured. ALSO I‚Äôll remind you that you HAVE a perk that allows you to be diligent while injured. 
---
Moreover there is obviously counter play to her abilities movement and gameplay. You say it‚Äôs a 50/50 for you as survivor well guess what buddy it‚Äôs a 50/50 for her too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and if that‚Äôs not the most balanced thing I‚Äôve ever seen I don‚Äôt know what is. ITS LITERALLY 50/50 you said it yourself. Why does that need changing at all?
---
No, i said, THE WORST, i bet we can do worse
---
love the edit lmao
---
Can I pay you to do a Huntress one for my above recent followers panel on twitch?
---
You think I contradicted myself because ONE cosmetic is kind of bright. Again, you're an idiot.
---
I‚Äôve got 3000+ hours situational awareness only takes you so far. If you‚Äôre off coms and not using object of obsession to know exactly where a killer is then you‚Äôre just fucking Jesus for knowing that amazing made up percentile amount of times you know where exactly the killer is. You‚Äôve NEVER been surprised before? By a Myers? Or a Low terror radius or tinkerer killer? Ever? Quit while you‚Äôre ahead, you made one decent suggestion I already highlighted it, the rest are horrible. The fact you literally are being hand fed a way to beat spirits and you‚Äôre still covering your ears and taking my quotes to use against me to better suit your narrative while somehow failing.
---
your animation state is wrong, something that is tightly-coupled with your health state in a properly programmed game. I don't see what the problem is? Pretty Good Job So Far...
---
Without exploiting, he's definitely better, but not good by any means really.
---
I just saw a message somewhere on a dbd Instagram I followed that the dev's confirmed that date but then I saw that forum post that they're sorry to inform that date will not be the right date. Also it was "announced" before they announced when the ptb was going to be out
---
&gt; Because of exploited addons and moonwalking having zero counter play. üò≠
---
*Exactly*.
---
But he wasn't objectively *stronger* than say a good Billy or Nurse. You get what I mean?
---
&gt;Spirit there‚Äôs options. Use them or you‚Äôre doomed to fail.
---
But what options? Iron will so it bounces back to being a 50/50 coinflip against *dogshit* spirits instead of a 90/10 one? Spine chill so you can be like half certain they're faking a phase (even though the common counter play is to just go away to the next tile whether or not they are)
---
You don't learn anything interesting playing against any Spirit. Literally even if they just made you see the path she took after her phase is finished, you can pick up on the type of player they are and the decisions they make.
---
Right now she is stale as dry rocks to play against.
---
That‚Äôs not super engaging, right now she‚Äôs engaging. She forces survivors to change their gameplay, don‚Äôt be predictable. Don‚Äôt run. Use iron will. Get good man. Tons of streamers, players and even just regular red rank players avoid her with ease. But that‚Äôs because they understand her gameplay and what they have to do to counter it.
---
Wow, that is very accurate. I used to main Bing Bing boy at start of game, I'm not emo though
---
No, i fully expect to be downed at some point and only expect to juke and evade for 30 seconds tops. i just know that when i'm tunneled im getting points and my team is out doing gens. i always see being tunneled as a killer nerfing themselves by almost voluntarily giving up 3 gens....
---
I think the knee is a good killer but i perfer the leg
---
&gt; First of all, legion was only "viable" with the mending exploit/bug and the chase exploit. Now he is much better without any exploits being involved. He very much needed a rework.
---
Yeah. He needed a rework. He wasn't super strong.
---
But the "If they're not stronger than billy/ nurse" take was serious, Legion didn't need a rework by that logic.
---
What does that even mean?
---
Would be weird since why would it have killers if it could sacrifice people to itself all by itself haha
---
Probably 4 man SWF. Unlikely that you hit a 4 man combo of random solo cry-babies. Could have used spine chill as well as a counter.
---
Just write "gg" and move on.
---
It was indeed a four man, I just simply asked what‚Äôs the issue and I just got berated. Not worth my time.

I think poisoned cinnamon roll refers to a character that is too sweet and precious for the toxic and poisoned world they live in. A delicacy that must be protected from their poisoned reality.

Source - urban dictionary I guess ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
the reason why your queue are that long it's because there isn't  constantly enough survivors playing and too much killer wannabe
---
Obviously, because you know when you face a prayer beads spirit right? No one is supposed to be forced to use a perk every game just to counter a possible add-on on a possible killer. Stop saying this stupid excuse, using a perk just to counter an unfair and broken add-on is unfair as fuck. It's like slugging repeatedly to avoid old DS, was it good? No, then STOP

D r o p p e d
---
For small specific things like that, just read the description in game or go to the dead by daylight wiki.
---
I would say:  
---
No Mither: Always Injured  
---
Autodidact: Worse skill checks  
---
Object of Obsession: Killer can find you easily  
---
No fourth perk or any useless perk. I couldn't find any others that debuffed you in any way.
---
Wait someone is using tombstone without infinite tier 3
---
Prayer beads is a broken add-on without counterplay. "Use spine chill" is not an excuse because no one should be forced to use a perk every single game just to counter a possible add-on on a possible killer. I would never DC but you can't compare DS and BT with prayer beads. I wouldn't call you toxic either because the add-on exist because of Devs fault but it's still a broken add-on.
---
Just the fact that some people say make any killer work, or tier lists aren‚Äôt a thing shows that they haven‚Äôt experienced top tier gameplay. And the viable killers are obvious, any killer who‚Äôs ability helps them get to survivors faster. 
---
Nurse. Spirit. Billy. In that order. 
---
Nurse because she can go anywhere. Your skill and ability with her determines what she can do, the better you are the better she is and is able to get to any survivor no matter what. 
---
Spirit has a huge advantage by being able to close the gap from survivors but really strong loops with really good survivors still give her trouble. 
---
Billy is a bit overrated but his mobility and map pressure make him above most other killers (especially his joke of a twin leatherface) he can still be hindered by intelligent survivors and strong loop combinations forcing players who play him regularly to understand some loops take too much time, leave and find someone else. Also his perk selection matters. Finding combinations of perks that work for how you intend to play him is vital because he is the weaker of the three. The first two could go in with no adds ons even and still succeed but billy needs perks and add ons to be at their best
---
Yes they can
---
I know part of the lore states the entity is beyond our comprehension as well as it gets stronger from sacrifices.
---
I'd like to see your idea of a killer better linked to the entity. Maybe like one that was fully possessed by the entity, has parts like the entity claws coming from its back and so on.
---
Or given the fact the entity creates from others memories a killer it created to be its avatar using bits and pieces of peoples memories maybe incorporate common fears or even pieces from the original killers into some kind of mashup.
---
Big same here man.
---
they are trying and that is what counts is that what you are saying?
---
BECAUSE IF YOU ARE I 100% AGREE!
---
I suppose it would be a killer that serves directly under the entity? Maybe something like "the butler" his mori could be that he rips a picture of your dead parents in half and in complete shock you just die on the spot
---
Wtf did u just bring upon this cursed land
---
Damn, I did miss the opportunity. :(
---
&gt; You‚Äôve NEVER been surprised before? By a Myers? Or a Low terror radius or tinkerer killer? Ever? 
---
That's the 10% of the time

Of course killers can surprise you- hell good killers playing terror radius perks can use your intuition against you. You know how you relax when you see a survivor being chased and see them getting injured behind walls? You don't expect the killer to double back and check on your gen, and now you're scrambling to remember where that window/ pallet combo was and if you could get there. Or you overextended while injured to get a center gen popped while you thought killer had been occupied.
---
There's intuition between walls- it's how good survivors find pallets as well. Killer goes into a corner of the map and right back to the center chasing a survivor? The pallets on that corner of the map are likely still all up. You know- shit like that.
---
&gt;And ‚ÄúBruh‚Äù? That‚Äôs your response? Lmfao I‚Äôm done. Bye.
---
And I quote:
---
&gt;Being able to be injured and not make a sound means you‚Äôre not getting tracked by sound at all anymore by 15 killers that also use sound as a tracking tool?
---
**You do not have 3k+ hours in this game.**
---
The text in the last panel is so redundant. If you can‚Äôt figure the joke out by just the picture, you are the one deserving the crown.
---
Haha true. But that's Just how DbD works atm I guess. They should improve those spots or as I said work on a completely new thing on how to hide totem spawns. 
---
And yes if you would play against a surv like me your totems wouldn't last long as I am a totem hunter with urban evasion, spine chill, small game and adrenaline. I manage almost every trial to break at least 3/5 and the others are broken by the time I come across them. (2019 - Never NOED) haha
---
Being toxic to new players = fun?
---
You clearly missunderstood my point. Im not saying old legion was ok. But old freddy, day 1 freddy was ok. I was just bringing up the points you are creating the same huge nerf effect on spirit right now. We dont need spirit nerfed for any damn reason. And yes i can outplay spirit. You want to know how? I dont run when its obvious SHES PHASING AND WHEN SHES DONE I BOOK IT. Why do people like you think their ideas is so damn great because they cant fight spirit.  Also "old freddy was horrible to new players" what kind of a dumbass point is that. Most killers are bad for new players if we count in the possibility of a rank reset. We can argue nurse is bad for new players? Does she need a nerf or has she been nerfed? Nope. Also billy and huntress are bad for new players aswell. Better start writing an another post for those two. Oh wait you wont because THEY ARE FUN. What is your logic with fun killers. Personally I ignored some of your points because you are just walking in circles or misunderstood a point so im not even going to mention them.
---
Suddenly a locker nearby slowly opens, and out pops the killer... An 8 feet tall pizza dweet
---
Why the fuck is the truth being downvoted?
---
For sure. I remember the feeling I got when I had lucky matches where I would kill everyone in just a few minutes.
---
Laughs whilst prestiging every killer and survivor at the same time again.
---
Reminds me of one time where I lost a survivor during a chase, and I checked a locker for them and found another survivor instead. In the end-game chat the survivor I found was confused how I found them.
---
2 minutes is a gen and a half. By that point Ruin has served its purpose.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve heard a single person who plays her
---
.... ????
---
No i'm talking basically every single popular streamer with literally thousands of hours in the game and who are actually capable of playing roles
---
IKR... Its reminding me more on horror anime than anything remotely related to concept of cute
---
I'm cancelling the Stranger Things DLC for this
---
No Mither, Auto didact, This is not happening, object of obsession.
---
It was actually solved, but recently came back. So, not a 3 year problem. More like a year, at most.
---
Ye I get you, even demigorgon looks like hag teleport just you get to see it happen and it's a permanent trap woth only so many to put down, I hope they bring out something totally fresh that we haven't seen, that's why I think the entity would be perfect for that
---
How's Solidarity supposed to work in terms of "Adverse Effects"?
---
Old legion wasnt busted. He was in the golden middle ground of if even a slight nerf could fuck up him up royally up the ass. And it sure fucked him up. Now if you wanted a busted legion, they could have buffed him and made him an A-S tier killer. And legion isnt fine as is. Hes ability doesnt stay up long enough/isnt fast enough to hit survivors, and the removal of the fact he can see blood doesnt help at all.
---
Probably gonna run Sprint Burst since he is fast as fuk boi
---
Luck also increases the odds of retrieving an item from a chest.
---
Well shit. Time to depip and protect some baby survivors as both killer and survivor
---
I can think of like 3 streamers who are popular who for sure don‚Äôt think that. If you have thousands of hours in the game then she shouldn‚Äôt really be that difficult to deal with. Her current toolset gives her the ability to compete against competent survivors. Hindering her any further would make her not a viable killer at all
---
Gonna be a blendette
---
TTV = mori is all about fun. Moris come in a limited supply, so streamers get the "privelege" of getting mori'd.
---
He's probably gonna play killer.
---
I've used it to communicate with a streamer before.
---
I love HP
---
Tbh if you are a good bubba, those dailys are easily achievable in one game.
---
Almost an instadown build , will try
---
Exactly. A lot of looping ability and experience comes from time, practice, but also map knowledge. Once you've repetitively played the same maps over and over, the layout stays the same. The only thing different is RNG, like pallet spawns and such. I have been playing for two months, and just achieved red rank (which I'm so proud of, yay!). And have noticed things like certain killers, perk loadouts, and mindgames are pretty consistent. Practice and time, my friend.
---
&gt; if spirit loses her ability to collide with survivors, she would be extremely easy to dodge and thus she becomes extremely easy to win against
---
?????????
---
No? Any Spirit that isn't on the brink of unconsciousness will be able to hear survivor breathing/ grass rustling/ see the trail of scratches lead to something. No collision gives survivors a chance to run the spirit a run for her money on her tracking and detection.
---
SPIRIT IS FUN TO PLAY AS.
---
-----------
---
Her tracking dynamic is very very interesting. You get the luxury of moving fast-as-fuck in exchange for having to test your tracking. Collision takes this challenge, crumbles it up, and instead makes this boring scenario where if you're running things optimally you won't really even need to pay attention to the tracking aspect.
---
&gt;Nerfs you're suggesting are not making her gameplay more "skillful" but only make her "guessing games" much more onesided.
---
I'm struggling to see what makes you think this- is the tracking engagement not part of Spirit's trade off for her going blazing speed?
---
I feel like I'd have absolutely no trouble playing Spirit with the nerfs I suggested. She's **so** incredibly easy right now, it's no wonder so many lobbies are filled with Spirit killers who are barely capable as anyone else.
---
Shy bubba is def my next meme build lmao . Goat suggestion
---
I‚Äôm a trapper main so this should be fun!
---
Why do people Mori p3 Claudettes?
---
And I'm saying Spirit needs a rework. She's stale, like old Legion but not nearly as *offensive.*
---
You're a moron.
---
She‚Äôs fine. Your opinion isn‚Äôt the majority opinion. She‚Äôs a good killer she has a strong kit. She doesn‚Äôt have the strongest kit. She doesn‚Äôt have a fundamentally broken kit like Legions was. She has counters, perks that counter her, gameplay decisions that counter her and she‚Äôs not able to teleport through walls I think she‚Äôs fine.
---
I never really thought of jane as fat, she looks pretty normal sized to me if at least a little larger then the other gangly ass claudettes and megs.
---
You said ‚Äústealth killers don‚Äôt have bright cosmetics‚Äù 
---
Don‚Äôt have = 0
---
Some = &gt;0
---
In your own words, you did contradict yourself.
---
&gt; THEY ARE WEAK KILLERS
---
When played by *bad* players. How do you play him? Frenzy, hit 1 guy, cancel frenzy and chase him down? He has a power that helps you track an entire lobby and lay in damage to keep everyone injured/ one tap very easily. As a 115% killer that's *very* solid.
---
Oh you use twitch emotes on reddit OmegaLUL. Anyways now that we have that amazing joke out the way, you didnt counter argument anything. If anything you walked in circles. Again. 
---
&gt;Freddy was especially bad because at low ranks the game is hide and seek
---
Oh so wraith is super bad for new survivors too. Got it. Better nerf him up too!
---
&gt;Oh of course! Why didn't I think of that 4Head
---
I mean you obviously didnt since you didnt even try to make an counter argument. You arent that bright are you? What is that comment going to proove, that im an idiot and you're right? Our sponsors say no. It just shows that you didnt think for that response very long and just wanted to be a bit sassy. Which I understand. Got to keep yourself confident I presume?
---
He wears dungarees.
---
Who is the plague? Or are you misspelling "THE PLAGGGGGGGGGGGGG DUDEEEEEEEE?"
---
Right... Except that perk is mainly for people who avoid the killer. You should get rid of it and learn to loop. For one because it's fun and for two because it helps your team by keeping the killer busy
---
It's a common joke my doggie.
---
Are the Devs aware of the state of the community rn? Do they have any idea how they're gonna tackle the toxicity?
---
Don't worry, I understood that refrence.
---
&gt; Leatherface barely reaches a survivor with the chainsaw
---
You nudge up to them and they don't have a pallet/ window in 3 seconds it's a free down. Play him like an M1 killer with the ability to create deadzones quickly with chainsawing pallets afterwards and the *threat* of an insta down on survivors in deadzone areas.
---
He's shit, but you act like if someone is a bad killer they're useless at certain ranks- even implying rank fucking means anything on this game.
---
... What? Did you just destroy your argument?    
---
&gt;Without exploiting, he's definitely better, but not good by any means really.
---
&gt;he's definitely better, but not good by any means really.
---
&gt; but not good by any means really.
---
Definitely better huh. That would explain that the player base is swarming with Legions then, right? Oh wait "hes not good in any means really"..... Which is it. Did they nerf him or buff him in your opinion. Take your pick.
---
&gt; Old legion wasnt busted
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oExzT4O0Ap8
---
4 man DC when they noticed Spirit with Prayer Beads? That must've been beautiful! So far me and my friends only managed to pull a 3 man DC against Spirits. We coordinately disconnect at the same second, is awesome. Screw this character and screw it even more this broken add-on.
---
If I get 100 upvotes then I will make a survivor lobby remix. Let's make it happen!
---
As if we need this POS making this community even saltier. Seriously how does this guy still have a fanbase? I thought the jury was out on him like 4 years ago.
---
Which streamers? I've seen one say Spirit has counterplay, and they even looked like they had legitimately high amount of hours in the game. (Tons of cosmetics/ map knowledge)
---
I watched them play survivor/ play against Spirit in like 5 matches and quickly realized why they were fine with her.
---
It doesn't "help him in every way."  
---
It denies you a lot of pip bonus and you might not rank up or even rank down due to survivors disconnecting.
---
Be mindful of the fact that if your true intentions are to make it specifically to lower ranks (which most of the time, it should, so that you can become a better player), that keeping track of the things you do play into the ranking system, and pip'ing.
---
For instance, doing a generator with a teammate completely. After two gens of this you are done with your Objective category and can focus on other things like Boldness or Altruism. I realize you said you are not as effective trying to loop a killer but taking some time to hone the craft is extremely advantageous not only to you, but your team, plus your boldness category. Also keep in mind that focusing primarily on pip'ing is NOT advantageous to your team as it could be to you.
---
Excuse me but what the fubar
---
FUCK THIS, *DC*
---
As in he could use a buff to make him more viable since his rework didn't make him a viable killer, it just made him much more usable than before. Are you dense, or is English not your first language?
---
Ok, I'm Earth0rganism (with a zero),I was rank 8 but I stopped playing for a month since I was busy(its 13 rn but I think I once I get a chance to get to around 8-10 I think I would stay there,when I was in those ranks I would have very quick lobbies, and I know the rank system is fucked). I dont usually run the same build over and over again, and I don't really like using the meta, but if I had to pick 4 perks it would be Selfcare(I know it's not effective against some killers,I also might switch this with the new nancy perk) , Bond(so when I'm in a chase, I don't bring them to my teammates or someone else is in a chase and I know when they're near), Spine chill (underrated), and an exhaustion perk
---
I mean, if there was a way to deliberately opt into having SWF I'd rather play that, cause the solo queue lobbies in Rank 1 are so unbelievably easy I strictly play killer for the point gen.
---
I used to relate to all the frustrations I see on this subreddit from "killer mains" but since all the killer buffs and survivor nerfs I just don't feel it. The game is incredibly easy as nearly every killer if you get "decent for both sides" maps.
---
You ignored the point. In HIGH RANKS. Any braindead killer can kill low rank survivors as a low rank killer. Cmon now. Use your head.
---
&gt; I NEED TO GET BETTER, BECAUSE YOU CANT WIN AGAINST SPIRITS?!
---
"Just run immersion builds 4head"
---
&gt;Iron will doesn‚Äôt work against spirit. Yet everyone who survives against her is suggesting you use it? Fucking absolute potato.
---
Iron Will 100% does not work against a Spirit who isn't braindead. You are still playing the coinflip game, and no game at all if the killer is actually good at their role and uses their fucking eyes to see blood or grass moving.
---
Atleast if you quote me, quote the whole sentence.
---
omg so sweet
---
As a part time streamer (dbd being my game of choice mostly) I like to fuck about and meme more than play seriously. But as I'm a killer main I commonly get people who come into my post game chat and give me nothing but death threats or something along those lines. It's got to the point I no longer advertise my twitch fully but hide it in the more info part of my steam profile for those sneaky enough to find it and have my name set to something that gives angry survivors or killers something to easily assume and hate me for, stopping them giving me the normal toxicity.
---
As a Pig main...same thing hunty...
---
Main licensed killer I want is springtrap idk if I could see scott allowing that tho but I can hope he matches this game surprisingly well and would be a very unique killer
---
ALIEN AND PREDATOR
---
You'll love r/raimimemes
---
It's just on PC sorry!
---
So you're saying that Wraith is a waifu? This opens up many different possibilities I've never considered.
---
Like a furry subreddit
---
Yeah but tbf they have good reason to as Claudettes half the time blend in or are super toxic, it's not fun trying to play a game of Where's Wally when you just want to kill

I love these survivors when I play killer.  Guess we all get to listen to your voice chat now.
---
&gt; I mean you obviously didnt since you didnt even try to make an counter argument
---
[Enlighten me what you do in this situation against spirit](https://i.imgur.com/ctRJbQ9.png)
---
&gt;Oh so wraith is super bad for new survivors too. Got it. 
---
Yeah. But I'm not saying he needs nerfs. I'm saying old OLD freddy was decent on top of making it miserable for new players. I'm not calling arms to nerf noob squashing killers- I off-handedly said that's why old freddy was fixed in a knee jerk fashion.
---
 English isnt actually my first language actually
---
&gt; it just made him much more usable than before
---
Ah yes. Thats why we see so many legions nowadays, right?  He is only usable in low ranks now. I do agree with the point he should buff him a little but the rework never made him more usable.
---
Was going to shoot you a follow after seeing this, but looks like I already do, so have a red upwards facing arrow instead.
---
My usual survivor build usually goes like this: Sprint Burst, Adrenaline, Self-Heal, and a filler perk (I like to use Spine Chill).
---
Sprint Burst is exceptional used correctly, as if a killer closes the gap before you realize he/she is there (Wraith, Spirit) you have the ability to "make-up" the distance. The downside is that you can't just run around to places as easily as if you had Balanced Landing, but a way to look past that is that it's only 40 seconds CD and before the Exhaustion timer expires you can run around as it won't expire the timer until you stop running.
---
Adrenaline is perfect for clutch situations. You are running a killer and someone pops the last gen; not only to get a Haste effect, but if you are hurt then you are healed. (This works for being on the hook too, as you will be fully healed after being unhooked.)
---
Self-Heal...I mean c'mon.
---
And I usually use Spine Chill as it is very good situationally, it's nice to know if a killer is committing towards coming your direction. 
---
As to what you should look for when in a chase to know if you should commit to a pallet. Look forward and to the sides of your surroundings. Is there another loop nearby? How safe is the loop? Will you have time to make it there? Think about these things and adjust accordingly.
---
Hope it helps! Have fun as Survivor!
---
That's easy
---
No Mither, Self Care, Solidarity and No One Left Behind.
---
Weirdly enough Predators getting his own game
---
:/ oh.
---
Is there some kind of level gap where low ranks can‚Äôt take their red rank mates into an SWF? I‚Äôm sick of getting red and green ranks then one rank 16 on the survivor team, all flashlight clicking me.
---
This is what most people mean when they say "rank means nothing". You can literally pip most games by urban evading around, doing gens, making saves and dying on first contact with the killer. Will you learn how to play? Not necessarily but you will get to rank 1. 
---
If you thought red ranks was full of god players like most killer mains like to pretend, you are up to a huge disappointment.
---
I mean,
---
1st - you wrote this whole text simply because it SEEMS I wanted it to fail. Congratulations! I never thought it would fail (it's a Chinese game, so many chinese people will keep playing)
---
2nd - the game is even more umbalanced.
---
There's gonna be a Friday the 13th chapter, and other hilarious jokes you can tell yourself.
---
I just can't
---
Your plan only had one flaw... We have the same type of Stand
---
Me when i hear the Nurse's teleporting sounds
---
The worst build is no mither object of obsession self care and auto didact.
---
Explain plz
---
Because sometimes that's what makes it fun for the killer again it's not his responsibility to make a game fun that's what the devs should do.
---
‚Äúyes sir i‚Äôm going back to the basement now‚Äù
---
https://youtu.be/v8XcQoJHauA
---
I guess this proves leatherface with speed limiter is op too
---
If it's the only survivor you hit or hooked then yea.
---
I want a resident evil chapter or even a silent hill chapter! 
---
Side note: I‚Äôd also like the scissorman from clocktower
---
I can imagine clown using wolverine and laughing my ass off
---
Claudette could help him with her botany knowledge tho
---
RKO imminent
---
Also when I asked what they used I also meant addons, if they're using shit like prayer beads then...
---
Absolutely genius! Keep working in this style cuz you got true talent.
---
Do you plan to pixelart Ghost Face?
---
No, if at least one survivor is dead then all 3 survivors can get out without the killer even knowing, think about that. 3 survivors could leave the game and win prematurely without the killer even knowing, and without much skill, just like the killer could take a survivor out prematurely after one hook
---
I apprechiate players with ttv in their nams, If they played well I would love to watch their stream, will also be able to watch the game from the streamers pov, which is interesting.
---
Haha I had no other choice
---
Lol. Pig &amp; Wraith must be in the rv
---
It can be yes. If someone is talin out of the game early it can put the test of the team in a huge bond making the game harder for them and easyer for the killer .
---
Bhvr isnt going to ban people over some petty beef
---
How dare you call Michael basic REEEEEEE
---
That looks so real and the texture with his colors are amazing.
---
But its fooni to mori streamers
---
I have a perk question. On my lvl 33 Wraith I have a choice between NOED lvl 3 or Ruin lvl 1 and I dont know what to pick.
---
she gives survivors no information meaning they have to entirely guess.
---
the only full proof counter to her is dcing.
---
before you say it, if perks are the only counters you can think of for a killer that shows clear imbalance.
---
vaulting a window slowly and walking when she phases are not reliable counters, they only work on bad spirits, not top tier ones.
---
vs a top tier spirit that doesn't make mistakes.. you just die.
---
I think the best explanation I got from a survivor dcing was "sorry my mom called me to dinner" üò≠
---
not nerf, fix. there's a lot of changes they could implement that wouldn't just be straight up nerfs, we don't wanna see her made useless. she can stay strong in other ways other than just making people have to guess.
---
if you would like to hear some of my suggestions I'm happy to fill you in.
---
I was playing totem roulette, which involves bringing all 5 totems (Thrill, Ruin, Devour, Haunted) and then using prayer beads for the yoinks
---
:(
---
No mither- always injured, self care- can't heal yourself because of no mither, object of obsession- killer always knows where injured you is at, autodiadact- if you try to heal a teammate it will take longer.
---
This is why at low ranks you always gtfo of the game as soon as you can before the killer rage quits
---
We found a winner! Now if only i had those perks
---
&gt; This will fool the killer into thinking I was going for pallet loops and gives me a chance to escape
---
They run through the pallet from the bottom, don't feel your collision, see your scratch marks stopped. If they're playing spirit they take this route:
---
https://i.imgur.com/jSB96sP.png
---
If they're bold they'll chance colliding with you towards shack or just simply unphase on that corner and see where you're at. As soon as they're out you've zoned yourself out of anything to work with and she gets a free hit

---
hmm. maybe something like no mither, OoO, left behind, and deja vu
---
&gt;I disagree. This is a gamestyle also in higher ranks. Blendettes exist. And its not just blendettes either, most survivors prefer to hide than to run since you dont give your position away.
---
That's precisely what I mean by there's morons at red ranks too. No killer worth their salt has trouble with blendettes. You can hear them just fine and they're usually too slow/ lack game sense to make proper plays.
---
When i started playing the killer side i mained wraith coz survivors keep disappearing. So i ran bloodhound, sloppy butcher and that one add on which make blood glow in cloak. Blood trails were like neon lights lol
---
this is really biased and twisted.
---
nobody said they have to win, there's so many other killers that I'd happily die to if the matchup felt fair and like they earned it.
---
there are so many changes they could implement that would solve the issue without making spirit worse, just a bit of balancing is in order.
---
just because survivors don't like your anime waifu doesn't mean they're just salty and saying so is really ignorant. instead you could try symphasising with them and listening to their complaints, then form and opinion and maybe suggest some changes that could be added without just hard nerfing.
---
but what am i saying, reddit killer mains are always biased and refuse to listen to genuine complaints. i tried.
---
Ow... OoO?
---
object of obsession
---
Is that freddy's swing hitbox in the background?
---
You should have more upvotes. I'd add, Adrenaline, Borrowed time, Prove thyself, We'll Make it and Self care.
---
Wait.... Wait. You‚Äôre gonna Mori me for being female?? WHY?!
---
lmao you can hear when she phases and can judge distance on how loud it is also that's kinda the point of being top tier that you are unstoppble
---
Someone perform an exorcism on this bitch
---
&gt;They run through the pallet from the bottom, don't feel your collision, see your scratch marks stopped. If they're playing spirit they take this route:
---
Exactly. Now you have an option of looping her through the pallet next to rubbish for a few times until you leave or you run towards the other direction and try and loose her. This might cost you a free hit BUT it will give other survivors enough time to complete gens and probably save you depending on your perks. And if we go with my build, we also have 1 use of dead hard.
---
^ and yet they winge that their queue times are long
---
Bro believe me you do not want to mess with speeds in a game like dbd.
---
Also scratch marks are already fucked on some maps like Lerys, the house on Cold wind and other indoor big places. 
---
Also that exhaustion perk could result in the survivor being hit many times so it's like a worse dead hard?
---
Determination sounds fine but no cooldown? You could just proxy chase lul also there already is play with your food.
---
Was the killer Pennywise?
---
Try and do Billy or spirit they're 2 of the best killers in the game, nurse is without a doubt the strongest however you're gonna have some issues playing her on console, generally killers with movement abilities are considered to be better because they can apply pressure throughout the whole map and spirit and Billy have this with added chase potential good luck
---
I don‚Äôt even play killer in the slightest. But I also have never tea bagged at an exit. That said I LOVE watching blood warden clips and seeing the sweet satisfaction of it all unfold.
---
&gt;That's precisely what I mean by there's morons at red ranks too. No killer worth their salt has trouble with blendettes. You can hear them just fine and they're usually too slow/ lack game sense to make proper plays.
---
Got no counter argument. I just overall agree lol.
---
"No counter bro there's no counter bro just a coin flip bro" literally just use a flashlight lol, or walk instead of running, or use quick and quiet. Or use iron will or you can fake to vault the pallet and see if they fall for it and move to grab you or use etc etc etc ,there are a lot of ways to counter spirit but y'all just wanna whine and go "muh headphones" and since when is using nothing but sound not a skill? It's not something anyone can do. And it takes practice to get consistent results with it, you guys just hate anything different.
---
What kind of notification does the killer get if I use diversion? Is it comparable with that small explosion by fast vaulting?
---
Time to undust ebony mori prayer beads spirit.
---
Not on ps4 at least, I waited more than 40 minutes for a lobby and it would've still gone forward if I didn't close the game in frustration.
---
you can't hear her phasing when you're in TR this is useless information during a chase.
---
if a killer is unstoppable that literally shows clear imbalance, how is that not obvious.
---
yes other killers are weaker, this isn't a competition saying all killers should be weak I definitely think the other killers deserve to be higher tier.
---
doc used to annoy me a lot back in like 2017,not a big deal anymore though he's pretty weak anyways so. i think people just hate screaming every 5 seconds
---
Why does he gets so upset when i fix his generators?:(
---
exactly, so it'd be a sort of nerf but not even much of a nerf.
---
sure if they buff weak killers i would be fine with nerfing strong ones
---
that's a bit of a stretch, considering I was making a joke. do you know what a joke is?
---
Taking the game hostage is literally what it sounds like.
---
The state of current match is frozen in place and cannot progress or resolve itself, that's taking the game hostage.
---
Example: 3 Survivor dead, 1 Generator left, Hatch open. Killer finds last survivor in a spot with no exit and blocks him. That survivor is stuck in that place and cannot leave anyhow. Killer then leaves for half an hour to make food. Endgame Collapse is not running and so the game is taken hostage, because the match cannot end anyhow at that point.
---
Example of what is not taking game hostage: Similar scenario as above, except the killer blocks the survivor for a minute, because he assumes the survivor has for some reason Deceisive Strike available and is waiting for it to run out. Similar case for Borrowed Time. Or if the endgame collapse is in progress. In first 2 cases, the killer would wait some time until the buffs run out and then proceed hitting survivor, in 3rd case the killer can go afk and make food until the entity claims the unfortunate survivor.
---
Friendly killers are fun for about 10 seconds and then you realize they're just wasting your time and can I PLEASE just play the actual game?
---
Michael: Am I a joke to you?
---
Yikes, this whole comment section probably runs-
---
 Decisive, Adrenaline, borrowed time and dead hard....
---
Keep being blinky mc-tbag toxic build survivors, thats how you turn trapper killers into spirit killers
---
I think that happens if you buy killers with cells instead of directly on the store
---
&gt;I was playing totem roulette, which involves bringing all 5 totems (Thrill, Ruin, Devour, Haunted) and then using prayer beads for the yoinks
---
Very fun to go against! /s^
---
Whait, what? I made this yesterday, sorry if it's an repost. Whasn't the intend :/
---
Amazingly, a game is supposed to be fun
---
It was supposed to explicitly look as sweaty as physically possible. 
---
Stridors training wheels? Definitely makes Iron Will users less of an issue but I usually use Sloppy Butcher in place of it anyways.
---
Lol yess I love when this happens!
---
well i mean i‚Äôm sure a lot of things us survivors do isn‚Äôt fun to go against either.
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again:
---
Omega Blink Nurse? Bring it on. Iridescent Head Huntress? Sounds like a challenge. Insidious Basement Bubba? Well, my offering is in the objective category anyway. 
---
Base Spirit? Nope. I'm out. Fuck her and everything she stands for.
---
(Note I'm not saying Spirit is overpowered, I just hate her playstyle as well as her animations)
---
That depends on how many new mods we'll invite after finishing the final voting and how rapidly the subreddit keeps growing.
---
A lot of hours and I basically never use them or see no reason anyone needs to use them as a spirit.
---
Stop you're going to get me playing Michael all over again
---
Wow, you've either new played against a spirit or your only experience was from crouching behind a bush all game.
---
You cannot hear the spirit phase when you're in her terror radius i.e. when you're being chased. She can hear you, see your character interacting with the environment (grass moving), she can collide into you and she can see your scratch marks. 
---
Whereas on the contrary, you have no idea when she is phasing and you can't hear where she is.
---
I'd love you here your ideas, because getting your name out there to everyone you play with is pretty damn beneficial.
---
Dude few killers require actual skill, it's just follow the survivor until you catch up, maybe trapper require some brain, but the others not so much
---
What the actual fuck did you make me watch?
---
Fun perk when it works.
---
I can't tell you how many times it's "activated" only to not stun the killer who then turns to me and shakes their head haha
---
say it louder one more time i think some people missed it
---
Tbf he is pretty much. Hold M2 and stalk survivors, at T3 you gain a one shot temporarily and your lunge is increased. 
---
Kind of wish they would rework him considering Ghost Face‚Äôs power is literally the same, but starting at T2 and no increased lunge
---
Removing collision will fix prayer beads anyway, no need to double nerf.
---
Looping can be fun, but it's not the most fun thing in the game lol, it's always the same thing
---
&gt;Why Legion is a great concept, but was deemed to be unfun to play as or against? 
---
I'm sorry but I did not want to read your post. I'm not sure if you're genuinely asking this question or if it's a rhetoricle question
---
Here's a genuine answer though:
---
He follows the pattern of a very easy execution "average pressure layout" game design. Think of something like an AR in a shooter. Sprays bullets, as long as you stay on target you're dealing damage. Miss some shots? Oh well, you micro adjust and you can continue laying in X amount of effectiveness in Y time.
---
But now let's introduce concepts like snipers and shotguns; say you miss shots as sniper or mis-time your shotgun shots. They have a high reload speed or punish to your poor execution, but when you *do* land it it makes up for the time you lost. You end up matching the gun that sprays in terms of X effectiveness in Y time.
---
**This matter of pay-off is not just a shooter thing.** I like to call it **"Shotguns are fun mentality"**
---
What do I mean? People like the stuff "around" the big moments or the great executions. Our brains are more event orientated rather than processing individual moments one after another. "Turn corner, see person, shotgun, miss, hide, reload, turn around, take a hit, shoot, hit"- we remember a small narrative of events more. It's *fun* knowing a "story" could've gone differently if you executed things slightly different, or were more skilled.
---
**This applies to DBD in a sense.** Take killers like Billy or Huntress. They have this sort of slow reload but high payoff dynamic. Excellent execution is rewarding, failed execution slows you down.
---
In a multiplayer game these tools are used against each other.
---
A survivor will toe the line to make a Billy mess up their execution, and exploit the window of opportunity for when they fail it. Same with a Huntress missing her hatchet. These build up, tension, execution, pay-off moments, drawn together, are *fun.*
---
**LEGION** by comparison cut execution out of the picture. He was the AR in DBD. He dealt consistent damage- they even employed a new mechanic that watered down hits cause a "fast killer" dealing tons of hits on a 2 hit focused game is fucking busted.
---
Legion didn't reward precise execution or toe'ing the line from the other side. He runs at you and does his dps.
---
Fundamentally, played correctly, he's unfun.
---
**Then on top of that unfun core design focus he was literally broken.**
---
[Small video showing precisely how this goes down.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oExzT4O0Ap8)
---
More like BillMori am I right
---
For like a licensed killer I want Chucky and Tiffany (Yes I want both cause why not?) but as like an original killer it be epic if they had a killer trained conductor.
---
There's no reason not to farm with your killer and just buy your way into the two L35 teachables, especially if you're good with your killer and have T3 Barbecue &amp; Chili - I'd always go with efficiency if you're looking to farm well during a Bloodpoint event.
---
Adrenaline and Dead Hard are both L40 perks. Borrowed Time and Decisive Strike are L35. I'd say pick Bill or Laurie, until L35, switch to the other until L35, then Meg or David until L40, and then finally switch to the last remaining one.
---
As for pallets, as a killer main you should be innately aware of when you *don't* want to eat a pallet - so as a survivor that's the *exact* time you want to slam one. Depending on the killer you may even want to slam pallets early, and mindgame around them. There's no single solution.
---
Yamcha.
---
i never kobe
---
Said the rank 20 survivor.
---
You haven't played other killers long enough clearly
---
*upvotes*
---
My first kobe on console after my PC died
---
Just try them all out and see how each Killer‚Äôs ability works and what seems to your liking. I recommend Billy. Not only does he have insane mobility and a one shot, but his teachable perk, Enduring, is one of the best perks as a killer.
---
Omg the Strangers Things fans that see this are going to be freaking out üòÇ
---
&gt;well i mean i‚Äôm sure a lot of things us survivors do isn‚Äôt fun to go against either.
---
So? Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
If this were survivors complaining about killer DCing on them because they had Balanced Landing and burned Haddonfield I would react the same way.
---
Why is it every time we are discussing about something, there is always someone: "*yeah but what about that*". 
---
This just escalates things and it never stops.
---
How about we fix high rank survivors so we arent forced to play a mix of 3, maybe 4 killers
---
It‚Äôs a joke -.-
---
You're playing against bad spirits. There's no spirit than can be creatively mind-gamed when she can literally hear see and touch you in phase.
---
As is actually tomorrow?
---
OOWOOooOHOHOHOOOH
---
You want to play survivor, but you want blood points, so you play killer instead, dbd is truly a work of art demonstrating how in this capitalistic world, one must kill and put others down, to get ahead.
---
Thank you, thank you, hold your applause
---
/s
---
A key part of Michael's gameplay is making sure you don't run out of Stalk. A common mistake is to drain one survivor and use the T3 to successfully sacrifice one or two that haven't even been Stalked yet. This can make things trickier as the game runs on, especially at endgame where you may end up really needing the T3 instadown.

---
&gt; Tbh i doubt the spirit would go towards the pallet to risk a stun to begin with
---
They have nothing to lose using their collision to check, especially if you approach from an odd angle. They 9 times out of 10 get to feel your collision, unphase and instantly hit you before you can react if you're camping the pallet.
---
&gt;Most situations are in dbd, infact, a gamble
---
Absolutely, but a measured gamble. You get information constantly from a killer and their behaviour- with spirit you don't, so you feel kind of like you're playing chess against an invisible pieces.
---
Lots of streamers are suggesting simply ways to make it feel more like you're playing against a human- one suggestion I saw was that you see the path the spirit travelled after she's done her phase, so you can get a glimpse of how she paths around things and how she chooses to do things.
---
Cause right now there's so little back and forth. It's why lately players find Nurse refreshing, because you can at least watch her execute or fail her blinks, and reactively try and make shit tough for her.
---
*Chillin‚Äô....Killin‚Äô‚Äù
---
Cause idiots are on the internet.
---
Nurse can be juked, you can play reactionary to her ability, as strong as it is. It totally breaks the game, but if you've got some moves, you can keep her busy. 
---
Spirit stands still and you lose.
---
Agreed. And it is quite underwhelming, because it is such an awesome idea for a game mechanic! I do remember waiting to insta main him because of that concept. But then I was quite disappointed in its execution... As we all were)
---
Don't like it, don't read it
---
Only "kinda"? :P
---
Nice, thank you!
---
I think this whole resource management along with opportunities for making team plays with perk synergy are the funnest events in the game, aside from pure behaviour watching. (even between teammates)
---
Stand - leatherboy
---
Stand master - meghead
---
Why should it not be a mindgame? Does the same apply to other killers that can pretend to use their power? What is a mindgame in these arbitrary conditions you deem fair?
---
Probably only up to 3-4 hooks. Usually experienced survivor teams tend to be able to figure out when hillbilly has BBQ and Chilli. At least from my experience.
---
You're always rolling dice in minigames,  that's the whole point of them
---
Why are y'all downvoting this, its literally true
---
He has been the only thing I have paid for in this game and I like to think that he was worth every penny.  Yea he might not be that good now, but that hasnt stopped me from playing him almost every day.
---
Projection
---
Many people have already said Tiffany could be the main killer and Chucky would be apart of her power.
---
I can tell you freddy didn't
---
Just bring self charging flashlight
---
But i love umaru-chan....
---
u/AverageNOEDuser is referring to u/int3r4ct's "Entity Education" series.
---
The more recent videos now use numbers that have been datamined from the game, so they're as accurate as they can be *at time of video creation*.
---
Some numbers are also held in the official wiki.
---
I'm not currently aware of a constantly updated record being held anywhere, although I'm sure it exists.
---
I mean faster pallet breaking alone plays into the fact that you wanna set up deadzones with him. Play M1, force pallets down when you see an opportunity. Not much different than playing Doc, Wraith, or Piggy. I feel more comfortable with Bubba because you always get morons in every lobby caught with their pants down in a deadzone.
---
He's not *terrible.* BAD players will be looped to high fucking hell because they don't know fundamentals of M1 chases, as well as see their chainsaw and think "I must use this always"
---
I always imagined that every time Entity becomes stronger it cares less about what's happening in its realm. 
---
And once it becomes strong enough to no longer be dependent on trials, it will just dump all killers and survivors(hopefully back on Earth and not into void) and moves on conquer greater worlds.
---
Well because other killers who pretend to use their power still have an animation tied to it. So when the wraith bing bong cancels and carries on chasing, I can see him doing that. When the trapper pretends to place a trap, I can see him doing that. 
---
When the spirit stands still, I literally have no information as to whether she's already using her ability, or just standing there watching me, or somewhere else on the map entirely. You shouldn't have that kind of influence over a survivor just because the devs decided to not give her an animation because they had no idea of her power level when they made her.
---
Imagine if a Huntress had no wind up on her hatchets, they just flew out of her chest whenever she felt like it. Sure would be fun.
---
Try again? Fuk you think this is? Killers are just supposed to sit in the corner and reflect on their actions? Lol no
---
Yeah, same. I‚Äôve been reported (as killer) more times than I can count for lag switching, but naw, my internet is just shitty.
---
That's like saying Slenderman can be in the game or a grim reaper.
---
I love Taylor and I'm gay. I think I'm smiley!
---
putting \*\*stars around your message like this \*\* will make it appear **like this**
---
one star like *this*
---
Well noone seems to be answering you :D   OoO =  object of obsession
---
They should definitely NOT rework Myers. In my opinion, he's one of the best designed killers in the game. He has similar mechanics to Ghostface, but a very different play style.
---
I would recommend Hag. Look up some playstyle tutorials for her to learn the different ways you can play her. Shes quite versatile, easy to learn, and can be absolutely devastating when her traps start popping off. If you like a playstyle that's different from the rest, you can get Plague. It takes a while to learn how to play her, but she can really slow the game down when going against altruistic survivors. If you want to go for ranking up and just slaughtering the survivors, definitely go for Spirit or Hag
---
Can you elaborate more on that? I don't see how Chucky, Slenderman and The Grim Reaper are alike.
---
I always thought they should have just buffed deep wounds to be a real threat and just get rid of his pallet vaulting nonsense
---
This would be cool, but the devs said that the reason that the characters all have the same walking animation is because it costs way too much money for a new one, so I don't think they would add it because if a walk costs too much a wolf would cost even more, cool concept though.
---
It would honestly feel goos
---
Well that's just wrong.
---
Lol that's literally what myers is doing! Keep scraping the bottom of the barrel for bp killers!
---
better yet just revert the phase sound change they made. Let people close up hear it who gives a damn.
---
Fake window vault
---
You're not done, there's more
---
No one said that the other killers don't need buffs. It is absolutely not okay to basically have no chance against a good nurse or spirit just because the other killers are weak.
---
Legion. 4 v 1 but i got a gun
---
A p3 Claudette is usually know as a "blendette". Due to their bloody clothes, they are harder to spot. Most killers do not like this. So they will bring a very special present for them. It's mostly a meme, but it does happen.
---
he said git gud
---
OH NO you lost a pip we're getting you legacy 3 for every character as gift have fun
---
YES.
---
So many times i see Survivors but act like i know nothing. They will noz run away, i get closer, **whack**
---
I dont really get your points here, also she does have multiple counterplays
---
Sloppy butcher is gud yuh
---
Yup, i don't mind getting moried aswell, idk why people ragequit and go salty
---
Makes sense
---
They should open a door or window
---
I agree to be honest, I think a lot of them put on an "act" 
---
Thats the thing that people don't recognize is that you need to be entertaining, for some people that means they "dial it up to 11" .
---
Not that every content creator does that, but some do for sure.
---
I won't argue ranks because rank reset comes around and you may be 3 months in playing killer at rank 15 and I'm 2 years in on survivor playing at 12. But just learn from it. Don't get swept up in emotions. Play your best and laugh the entire time. Trust me. Get shit talked. Brush it off. You won't win them all and it takes 0 skill to face camp. You're only hindering yourself from learning maps loops etc. Trust me! A better killer is good for everyone. I want to stick around when a killer has a bad game and loop to teach or if the killer is good learn! But that's "holding the game hostage". Trust me! Please! I'm begging you! Leave that survivor and find another to start chase again! It will make you better, I swear!
---
This is blatantly wrong and I can't believe how many people up voted you.
---
Section V of the EULA:
---
&gt; Both you and BHVR (or its licensors) may terminate this EULA at any time for any reason or for no reason. Termination by BHVR will be effective upon notice to you, termination or deletion of your Account (if any), or BHVR‚Äôs decision to permanently discontinue offering and/or supporting the Game, which it may do at any time in its sole discretion.
---
Take note of that **"for any reason or for no reason"**
---
BHVR's frequent inaction on people like this has nothing to do with what they're allowed to do, they flat-out *choose* not to actually punish people for breaking their rules despite being fully within their rights to do so.
---
That's a good point, also I'm not sure how they would widen the stairs without completely redesigning the house
---
Nurse, so i can just die
---
TIL meta perks = toxic
---
Please respond! I have to see what you come up with next.
---
These are the people that say no to cross platform. Playing controller or keyboard on survivor isnt much of a difference but playing controller vs keyboard as killer is and really impacts your gameplay (aim, mind game potential etc) . They dont want cross platform so they can bully killers. Id love to see them against a rank 1 nurse on pc
---
the only skill based actions you can do is getting chased / looped.
---
Actually, it is a double edged sword. If you remove his haste, then deep wounds will need a massive buff (which can decrease the interest of playing Legion, as he will become M1 killer).
---
Also, then the deep wounds might tick down much faster near the killer, which will be an obnoxious tunneling thing. So, Idk about that.
---
My idea was to leave the haste as it is, but make deep woulds tick a very very little in a proximity to the killer, as well as MUCH faster outside of it. However, the mending time will be very small too (let‚Äôs say, 10ish seconds), so, you can mend mid-chase, and it does not work as a stalling tool.
---
The reason we should not remove haste is that it is both fun to use, and gives Legion an incentive to hit multiple people with deep wounds (he will get a speed boost and aura reveal). 
---
However, tweaking it can also have it‚Äôs place. For example, haste is only for movement speed OR vaulting, but no haste. This can make it a tad bit balanced too (more conterplay too it).
---
I hope you get my point more clearly now. Please, if you have any thoughts why it is a bad/good idea, write it out ‚Äî I will be happy to agree/debate. The point of this point is to determine what is a good tweak to current Legion, after all.
---
Agree. It honestly depends how long it took that Kate to open the exit gates after finishing the last gen. If she went straight for it - yeah, you can thank her for that. If she waited to see wtf was going on and simply lost the waiting game - yeah, that's borderline keeping the game hostage on the killer's part.
---
Would love this chapter the map would be so cool
---
More or less, though that‚Äôs usually just ‚Äúcinnamon roll‚Äù. I think the poisoned means she‚Äôs already corrupted, but is still somewhat innocent
---
Yeah and i hear booom and hooking noises
---
Ooh. Thanks. I will edit it!
---
There are two tipes of people, the one that constantly loop the killer and the ones who manage to escape in three seconds. Guess who has more brain
---
Good point... the stairs would have to change. Maybe they can add that tech which allows you to go through killers - the ones that work in basements.
---
How are they coin flips? You can not say that unless you concede that all dbd mindgames are coinflips, is moonwalking at a pallet a coin flip? Which way is the killer gonna walk ooOooOooO
---
Got the day 1 day ago and already have ruin, impressive. You must have played for like 12 hours straight
---
Ha! No.
---
Link?
---
did someone actually downvote this or is Reddit trolling me? lol don't downvote people giving credit where credit is do!!
---
Bruh you can literally just listen to her footsteps,  and I'm sorry but if blocking line of sight and moonwalking is a mindgame then I don't see how standing still isn't one
---
dumb a$$ F@g downvoting but saying a doll can be put in game is stupid because slenderman can't move only teleport.
---
TIL meta killers = no skill toxic killer
---
I hate playing against spirit
---
Probably Mattew, Kevin or a Sugarplum Fairy.
---
r/nou
---
stupid f@gs
---
They‚Äôre both toxic as fuck
---
you can adapt to mindgames with experience and expect them on both sides but they can still catch you off guard. A moonwalking killer tends to be countered much more frequently by experienced survivors. A spirit has the clear advantage and leaves no info to the survivor while having all information on the survivor
---
It was in the shrine store but I did sink in a lot of hours. My Wraith is already almost lvl 50.
---
I also have NOED.
---
pu$$y a$$ nigs
---
It really shows how worthless ranks are when rank 1 survivors can't counter a spirit
---
Now u cant start healing
---
Oh no, progress I worked for and earned was stolen from me via glitch #9953795 in the game! How dare I be upset. It wasn‚Äôt even just that my rank progress was stolen, it stole the same amount of rank progress from the person in my SWF simply because the match was canceled. Gtfo
---
Do GFs actually camp? I've been playing a lot of low-rank survivor lately (not SWF booster, just soloQ reformed killer main) and I literally haven't even seen the guy. He sure is sneaky I guess lol. I actually main dat boi in rank 6-8 on PC, no camping at those ranks tho ofc.
---
How do you counter a spirit? Give me some examples.
---
Wait what are you talking about? If you're saying I downvoted you I didn't. All I said Was it be cool if Chucky was going to be the next licensed killer and if the next chapter is an original killer it would be cool if it was some type of Ghost Trained Conductor.
---
Frick yea
---
Woah someone is salty as hell
---
Feels good being the bad guy

BEST feeling.

Bloodwarden BEST perk.

&gt; Bruh you can literally just listen to her footsteps

No you can't.

&gt; blocking line of sight and moonwalking is a mindgame then I don't see how standing still isn't one

I just told you why.

---
Thank you kind sir.
---
U and your friends sound like losers lol
---
No one said Spirit is toxic, they said she's OP and not fun to play against. 
---
Do you know what Toxic means?
---
Wait really? Aww man that be so cool if Tiffany comes\~!!!
---
If you can't see the killer you see no animation so your argument is invalid, you have no information and have to guess if they're moonwalking or not, the exact same thing applies to spirit standing still
---
Ngl I'm pretty scared to share the link to my dbd video because I don't want to be hates for self promo. But there's also another dbd video on the way right now
---
https://youtu.be/_a_N1NHJRgQ
---
(And thanks for being interested, it really does mean a lot)
---
oh, i didn‚Äôt know her perks was self centred tbh. I take that in mind when i do the killers perks and for more survivor perks. thanks for the info.
---
I'd love to play Plague mainly because of her lore and my love for ancient history. She has good perks too, the same goes with Hag. I unlocked Hex: Ruin in this week's shrine, but she still has something to offer, doesen't she?
---
*embarrassed heavy breathing*
---
lol
---
Probably the reason I like her
---
Sweetie I was specifically talking about moonwalking when there's no line of sight, because it's the only scenario  where it works, but feel free to ignore that to fit your narrative, and if you think hiding the red light takes any skill at all then that's just sad :(
---
Honest, I‚Äôd say Wraith. He‚Äôs just a M1 killer, but still does pretty well, and he‚Äôs fun to play.
---
I like those :(
---
Why are you booing me? I‚Äôm right
---
Because it‚Äôs a fictional character that has the same potential to be gay vs straight, and is up to the individual to make that decision for themselves and not shame others for what they chose. And OP has chosen gay.    
---
Also Trapper‚Äôs totally a bear lol
---
He deserves it for running ruin in 2019
---
I don't care for your initial point, it's obvious. Yes, if you're facing swf with meta perks, you're probably going to need to bring a top tier killer. Wow, what an observation. Has nothing to do with the balance of the spirit.
---
I just thought it was useful to point out how ridiculous it was to claim that using perks is toxic.
---
K bud

Gen better just reset lmao

there is a differnce between running loops, or the one true infinite left in the game. It's the same as saying using a lagswitch is perfectly fine and fair since it's something you can do in the game, and if it would be fun and fair they wouldn't have stuffed most infinites up. I was talking about a macro which spams it like 20 times per second, not normal clicking, even if that still is pretty borderline. If you use bamboozle you straight up lose, because you took a perk for one loop on one map which you can't even get 100% for sure, even with an map offering.

If they managed to get money out of you, you've already lost. Lets be real, what game does NOT have bugs like this. You think Overwatch is any better? Fortnite is any more fun? What about Rainbow Six: Siege. You think they're any better?  
---
Please keep those kinds of comments to yourself my guy.  We really do not honestly care.
---
Actually this was a terrible play by your part, you essentially killed your 2 teammates by what you did, luckily the killer was way worse, but that doesn't make what you did right.  
---
I'll go a little into detail on why this is, first thing you did was unhooking Meg when the killer was coming to this very hook, he doesn't have a hook available there, so just don't unhook while Jake is wiggling, killer will either drop him (if it isn't too late) or he will wiggle free, you also unhooked without BT, you farmed meg and didn't even try to tank the hit for her either.  
---
If the killer was a bit better/didn't stress out, he would've downed Meg instantly and then hooked Jake, leaving you no choice but to leave.
---
If you had done nothing they would've died anyway but good plays feel nice to pull off.
---
I mean you don't really need anything against dumb killers anyways, since your team just wins as long as they all do their job, as you said, map pressure is missing
---
Based

Its fun
---
Exactly this. Combined with the fact that it's forced advertisement.
---
Mori== biatch
---
Ye they‚Äôre making my out in the rv
---
Survivors: Still complain about Yamaoko's haunting xD
---
Ah, the wording implies differently.  Does make it much better than thought then.   Figured it was just like Dark Sense in only really doing anything if you did the gen.
---
Anime pfps and P3 Claudettes are so common, I'd have to bring a mori pretty much every game.
---
I can also DC if we're the last two remaining survivors, the killer is slugging me, the other one found the hatch and that other one survivor wasn't an asshole
---
Patch 3.2.2
---
- Removed the Spirit because rank 20s said so.
---
I would too, if my lifelyhood depends on if a game stays alive or not tbh
---
Fuck a duck
---
I wish him big dick in his eyeballs then
---
Stardew Valley intensifies
---
I always mori twitch streamers when i play killer, not because theyre toxic but because theyre shit teammates who can lose the team a whole game
---
Happy birthday :D
---
It will be cool as a skin
---
If I can't see the killer, I have no information, correct. What does that have to do with any of this? I'm specifically talking about when I can see the killer, I should be able to see whether or not they're using their ability. You've deviated so far from the discussion just to try and make some kind of point...
---
My narrative? Haha.
---
Ofc moon-walking takes skill. It takes timing and loop knowledge. I've seen many failed attempts at moonwalkling; that wouldn't be the case if it took skill. Moonwalking does heavily rely on latency though and once servers are in the game and survivors can react quicker to killer actions, it won't be anywhere near as strong.
---
Funny story about ttv 
---
I've played with 2 famous streamers, noob3 and puppers (well #2 here thinks he's famous anyway) .
---
When I began to actually win the game he screamed "oh boy we've got a stream sniper". This is after being looped by noob3 for at least 2 minutes and the guy playing like a fucking god. 
---
Now I know this because noob3 stands out a fuck ton with the way he plays and the way he used to dress as nea. After the game I checked his stream. 
---
The toxicity in that guy when he plays with puppers is immense and it hurt as a fan watching them mock the way I was playing. 
---
I've also played against Monto who I don't think streams and was pleasant overall. Very humble in chat.
---
I really dislike the twitch crowd. They're the most enabled and encouraged to feel triggered and even the odd ttv stream I did open the people seem triggered or upset at least half the time. Really sad.
---
&gt;The perks from left to right go bottom right left top
---
Really? I never noticed that. Thanks for the info
---
I‚Äôd love to hear your ideas too. Having ‚ÄúTTV/YT‚Äù in your name is the easiest way to self promo if you have a small following. 
---
Now if they have 500+ followers and are still doing that.. well, that‚Äôs a different story
---
Ghostface:(Leans in) So what‚Äôs your favorite scary movie?
---
Thanks
---
Bill Clinton
---
No, the whole point of her power is to be invisible and phase around. Her power is supposed to be guessing where she goes when using her power, not whether or not she's actually using her power.
---
Nah I mean like if its endgame and its been a god awful game, barely caught anyone, green/purple/red ranks destroying you in chases, and you just want that one kill rather than letting them go and watching them teabag at the exit gate
---
Why can‚Äôt you work?
---
@pixiv Hey
---
Hot
---
And then after tons of people are banned for being toxic and no other reason people will boycott because that's such a shitty thing to do.
---
How to turn one of the 2 killers that can do their job into garbage
---
Sounds like a different bug to me
---
I keep saying this! Make it to where you cant heal deep wound without a med kit or another survivor! That way it takes two people out of the fight
---
Nice Susie!
---
As u/TheFace0FBoe said, salty messages of any kind have been against the rules for a long time. Obviously we're not omnipresent and posts will slip through our moderation; however we try to catch up eventually. This problem is currently worse than it should be because of the fact that our mod team is understaffed, but new mods will be here soon, which should ensure a better rule enforcement.
---
The only exceptions to this rule are extremely funny chatlogs or chatlogs with r/rareinsults.
---
Billy OMEGALUL
---
I'm definitely not down for more cloaked killers
---
It will most likely release some time around the shrine of secrets refresh, at least I would hope it will come then, or sooner.
---
It's the PTB, the whole purpose is to test the update and find bugs
---
format getting boring
---
Ok that was hilarious
---
They remain largely unchanged though? How would this affect spirit's effectiveness? It just gives survivors more info on her behaviour rather than "at the whims of invisible opponent" and the odd chance she brushes collision box for the easy hit.
---
Or atleast something that will do something with the survivor you unhooked like being to see their aura for 30 seconds
---
The only thing more satisfying is cleansing devour hope before they can mori your downed mate
---
We will not completely prohibit shitposts, no. The majority of the community enjoys them and there are solid counter arguments against prohibiting memes.
---
The Office (US version) is on Netflix until January when NBC(?) is taking its rights back for its own streaming app.
---
&lt;3
---
I can agree with you but with the limitations of being at more of a disadvantage while uncloaking I think it makes it the worst cloaked killer in the game also he can't body block in corners while uncloaking is my idea
---
"Alright, who let myers get into tier 4?!" -Last words spoken by a doomed survivor...
---
Watch him now and again. Never seen him be in any way toxic in or out of game. Beyond a bit of grouchy moaning he has always struck me as a fairly wholesome streamer?
---
Played this game for years and id still give it a thumbs down
---
r/eyebleach
---
At that point the PTB is basically Wednesday and Thursday instead.
---
Keemstar. He is the host of a youtube channel called drama alert (which is a channel that reports news and drama regarding the community)
---
I play both and can confirm that strategically waiting for altruism is very strong for them
---
If you put a Bear Trap on someone after all the gens are done, they're useless. You can go through the gate with a trap on as long as it's not activated.
---
How could you say something so controversial but brave
---
im not saying Predator wouldnt be a cool addition but it will never happen unless Predator Hunting Grounds fails miserably and they decide to trade off the IP
---
Except from what /u/PsykeySleaze said, we can assume they put in a report and clipped the part of the vod with the streamer antagonizing his friend to be a jackass.
---
Expecting bhvr employees to watch every streamer to monitor them is unreasonable, and you know that's not what I was implying they do. But providing evidence of someone that violates their own EULA's behavioral guidelines and they do nothing about it makes you wonder how much they care about the health of the community.
---
Ohh. This a such seewt art. Good work. üñ§
---
Don't forget the sad edge-boy anime pfp with 3000+ hrs in DBD and their name is some smallass text like  "·µâ ·µó ·µâ  ≥ ‚Åø ·µÉ À°   À¢ ·µÉ ·µà  ‚Åø ·µâ À¢ À¢"
---
  
---
  If you hate DBD so much, stop playing it. No? 
---
Ok, here is a mori.
---
They're hateful people
---
Eww stridor
---
The pig and spirits ability to scare the fuck outta you is what really makes them fun.
---
He's very environmentally conscious. Billy has worked hard to get the Entity to go green. You just can't see the solar panels on top of the killer shack.
---
I hope I‚Äôm not the only one that doesn‚Äôt know wtf they‚Äôre looking at
---
First... I get you in mood
---
No particular order
---
Most - Myers, Clown, Wraith, Plague, Leatherface, Doc, Huntress
---
Least - Hillbilly, Legion, Ghostface
---
I don‚Äôt really like Trapper or Pig but those 3 above are the only killers where I would rather not play the game at all than play those three.
---
Mostly only supersweats who t-bag after every pallet play her at P3.
---
Distortion only has 3 stacks though. They should buff it to make stacks regainable
---
I love trapper! What are you on???
---
Live action goomba lookin ass
---
Who‚Äôs that guy who plays mostly Myers, says every killer is shit tier and loses his mind if anyone says more than GG in the end chat?
---
new dlc is probaly at the end of the month
---
If you avoid his traps he doesn‚Äôt really do anything else.
---
You should be able to get away with pretty much anything, assuming you learn to play nurse well. Some of the best perks on her are ones to help you find survivors - if you're new to the game and don't have a lot available to you then try Nurse's Calling, Whispers tier 3, and/or Bitter Murmur. If you got BBQ from the shrine, feel free to use that. A common build is to play with keeping survivors injured and run things like sloppy butcher and thanatophobia which will both help slow the game down and give you time to use your other perks. Good luck!
---
*laughs in Giorno Giovanna having a dream*
---
I disagree, how about not berating people on their choice of perks?
---
If that person can play well, what's it to you which perks he uses?
---
I also doubt that simply by adding a fourth perk said player would have magically performed far better and turned the game around with just that.
---
Also do you wanna know why the killer version is stronger than the survivor version?
---
Because survivors can specialize. You can use your 4 perk slots to be super stealthy and fix gens that way.
---
You can take 4 aggressive perks that help you in the chase, loop the killer around while your team fixes the gen.
---
Or you can make a build that focuses on healing and coop actions, and stay out of trouble.
---
The killer on the other hand always needs tracking, gen protection/regression and chase potential. In every single trial.
---
Balance wise a killer perk slot is more valueable then 1 survivor perk slot on all 4 survivors combined
---
its not a bug its a feature
---
on the right killers for sure. Pretty much every killer has their own optimal playstyles + build combos. For example, ruin is a waste of a slot on some killers for sure.
---
Add ons were meant to be used and abused fam, burn through them, you get so much BP playing freddy that you can easily get your money back
---
That‚Äôs the fun bit! Placing traps in unexpected locations and clever chases which traps them! So much fun!
---
I‚Äôm lost, and also new here, what‚Äôs significant about having ttv in your name?
---
I love this feature
---
I can picture her as "The Crab."
---
I'm not a nurse player, but what I often hear from people is to get used to her blinks without add-ons. You need to develop muscle memory for distances and charge times before you start using add-ons. 
---
Whispers, nurse's calling, sloppy butcher and thanatophobia is a good combination of perks that isn't from other killers. 
---
As for teachables, Nurse is great with BBQ and chili, monitor and abuse, Ruin (that goes for every killer, but nurse is able to defend/avenge her totems more reliably than most), make your choice.... I'd recommend checking out some YouTube videos for more gimmicky builds. Monto, Noob3, farmer John, Otzdarva all have good nurse content.
---
yeah I know
---
Thanks. It makes sense that they need to be active now that I think about it. Man, the end game collapse update did a number on the pig. I remember when I could get a bunch of traps to pop.
---
Seconded, who da fuck dis?
---
They aren't tilting there heads there breaking there necks
---
I need the sauce for all three of these
---
The amount of times my devour hope gets cleansed after 1 mori is ridiculous
---
Survivors: Theres no counter play, it‚Äôs not fair!
---
Also survivors: Let me run some M1 killers around god windows and ultra safe pallets with no counter play.
---
1 sided mind games aren't skillful or fun.
---
Some Russian gave me the exact same threat. This happened a year ago... still waiting for me to ‚Äúenjoy not have internrt pig‚Äù
---
Any strats for David King? What perks are good for him?
---
Should start in either 3 hours, or 6 hours. Same time tomorrow.
---
Lol at iron maiden still being a meme
---
Hopefully never
---
No
---
I got a Twitch in my game last night. Normally I lobby dodge but I was on a good streak and I was playing a meme build, body block had on The Game. The Twitcher was a flashlight warrior killing my traps, and was more keen on using that flashlight up front than dodging granny. Good kiter when she tried, but I got the 4K.
---
How does camping even work on ghostface? The hooked guy can just uncloak him
---
I‚Äôm confused as to why you pointed this out, is it bad? Is it good? Are you just saying it for no reason?
---
Keem is playing Rocket League now? 
---
Can't wait to see that 
---
maybe that stuff works for nurse, billy and spirit but in red ranks the first build is pretty much optimal in those purple and red ranks for other killers. 
---
Just swap out brutal strength for ruin and most m1 killers can benefit from it.
---
Instead of whining on this sub, you can also just report him on Twitch and they'll get banned 100% guaranteed. Twitch has a very strict policy towards things like this.
---
As killer I've never had ttv in my lobby(PLENTY as survivor) but I did have someone tell me they were recording and if I'd like my user tag blurred out or not. Now that's respectful and I even asked him for his YT/twitch channel. I guess he had more leeway making a recording than doing a stream but a heads up and choice of privacy is really nice and makes me more inclined to see your content. Rather than 'Lol say hi to the audience you dumb baby killer' which has happened to my friend
---
How hard of a camper/tunneler do you have to be to complain about Borrowed Time?
---
big clownerino dickerino
---
They should either widen the stairway or add another one outside
---
I think part of the level progression of it should be 3/4/5 tokens.
---
Why would using perks be bannable.  Mad grit is where the devs want it to be, from what I understand.  You should be fine.
---
If it's possible within the game without cheating you can't be banned. Play what you want, how you want, abs sunny cheat.
---
It's just salty survivors crying
---
Yeah, how dare survivors try to get more bloodpoints.
---
It used to be on the PTB. Spamming with mad grit made your character faster for some reason, but it was fixed before reaching live I think. But I don‚Äôt think you can get banned by using a certain build lol. Not even if you facecamp.
---
Yes actually.
---
No. You won't get banned for using any in game perks.
---
I was told by one that I was molested as a kid and how I should KYS. Went to his channel and he said it was friendly just banter.
---
Dang, I didn‚Äôt know it was controversial lol. She is by far the worst character in the show.
---
I kinda assumed everyone was on the same page about her.
---
No mention of arrogant crybaby Tyde?
---
^ This. Just becuase BHVR doesn't do anything doesn't mean there is nothing to be done.
---
Don't forget puppers! But yeah, I don't really get it as long as they aren't being little shits. Maybe it's the obnoxiousness of self promotion, maybe people are jealous that person can stream and potentially make money and they can't, maybe some of them are just super toxic. Idk I don't hate them in sight like some people do
---
If that‚Äôs true that‚Äôs good to know ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
That's one question. It can be answered: people go bombrush hooks, endgame, etc., etc.
---
But it's the first time I see somebody complains about "being bullied by Borrowed Time". Killers are so soft these days lol.
---
No One understands what I said: I meant that I want to change builds, I don't want to use Spine Chill every single game. I know it's useful but I want to change it for something else. So, how do I know when to use it? I can't
---
If it glows it goes
---
Especially since at the beginning the was no punishment for DCing it actually prevented the killer from pipping most times
---
Master forgive me. I must go all out, just this once.
---
How is it hindering?
---
You find a spot that lets you see the hook but keeps you away from the sight of the hooked guy.
---
Marika tachibana
---
This is so calm
---
Dropkicking be like
---
As a console player I can confirm. Also I just wanna watch the Demogorgon gameplay on YouTube :)
---
Any perk is obviously intended for use within the game so no you won‚Äôt be banned for it. The only time most people would agree or say something is ban worthy is if you use a perk knowing full well it‚Äôs glitched like the wake up glitch we had or if you use glitched add ons. However I never saw anyone banned for those.
---
Though all bear traps were disarmed, there was one trap they couldn't escape.
---
No. Using in game perks (that aren‚Äôt bugged) is not bannable. If they‚Äôre bugged I guess you could get done for exploits, but it‚Äôs still unlikely.
---
Sadly having ttv in your name is a liability. Easly the whole team can be stream sniped. Not worth it.
---
good
---
I have noticed that too. My friend and I were talking about how games like ow and dbd can be so toxic and I noticed a lot of the behavior I see in my own games is really just them copying from some 'toxic' streamer or YouTuber. A couple ttv I've teamed with as survivors tend to be the 'i can totally run the killer for 5 gens, even though I cant loop for shit' or 'i know it's your first hook after you've unhooked me twice...but I have a key and found the hatch also I'm doing adept for my audience so....YEET'
---
Are there anymore?
---
r/dbdlfg
---
I think the official Discord server has some LFG channels, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.
---
I usually do a short patrol. NS behind cover and respect the hooks LOS, your lack of terror radius combined with being a but further from the hook means usually stealthy unhookers just go for it. 
---
It's one of the best times for stalk as the unhooker feels safe enough to finish the job even if they spot you. You'll get a sort of discount make your choice out of it.
---
You typically catch someone bolting to the hook on the way to the gen and just prowl back over there for the unhook-expose.
---
Why don‚Äôt you like playing against ghostface?
---
I‚Äôll send you it :)
---
I've had something like this happen to one of my friends except they were already fully out of the gate just to get tombstoned

No mother and object of obsession. Toss in premonition and lithe
---
Ah so just double fucking your team over?
---
a Jane player tried to pull the heads on bullshit with me snd i ended up grabbing her ass
---
Why report him? He didnt break any rules.
---
See I‚Äôd take Spirit over Billy anyday. Spirit can‚Äôt zoom across the map at 100mph and instadown someone in the first 10 seconds if the game. Spirit cant use bbq and instadown someone at the other side of the map, then zoom back to tunnel the first person hooked. She cant because she cant instadown, and her power has a cooldown.
---
She cant walk behind you while casually revving a chainsaw with no downside and she cant swing instadown after instadown after instadown all game long with no penalty.
---
I‚Äôd take prayer beads spirit over Hillbilly. Hes such a boring twat and is far too easy to use at low ranks so if you play after rank reset then GG because any chump can pick billy and 4k at green ranks.
---
Also its funny how everyone complains about spirit having no counter play yet nobody focuses on the fucking god windows. How do you deal with 4 survivors running for the ironworks window every single time they get chased? ‚ÄúJuSt bRiNg BaMbOoZlE‚Äù, hmm, almost like when killers say to counter spirit ‚ÄújUsT bRiNg IrOn WiLl‚Äù, except iron will is at least more useful across the board on a survivor.
---
Not to mention there are still hundreds of safe loops in the game with no line of sight blockers, meaning no mindgames.
---
Like its ok for things on the survivor side to have little to no counter play but its a sin on the killer side. Even the almighty NOED - which I hate btw - has counter play, but Adrenaline? None other than ‚ÄújuSt kIlL them AlL b4 The LaSt GeN pOpz‚Äù.
---
Usually around 2:00 or 3:00 I think
---
I agree with your point, but you‚Äôre waving a red flag to an easily provoked bull by naming streamers in this subreddit.
---
You forgot this some bullshit and I'm 5 minutes away from not playing dbd forever.
---
I‚Äôm on pc, queue times + horrible bugs. Your not missing out on much.
---
ptb always releases around 6pm UK, so it will be that time most likely
---
I personally bring them for p3s with flashlights or ttvs
---
Get over it mate, it happens. People get offended over the dumbest of stuff now days.
---
You get it dude but I flex on Reddit to unlike you
---
I was just talking about the people that the other guy mentioned, haven't even paid attention to Tyde since one of the times where he claimed to quit DbD or some shit like that
---
Ah yes. This month we rag on the spirit. Yes yes.
---
Is next month "do something about nurse already" month or are we complaining about billy again?
---
Oh, or is it hag month? That ones rare, I like hag month.
---
Back in the day, there was no hatch. But generators also couldn't be regressed, so escaping alone was sometimes easier.
---
One time I brung the wrong addons so I just jumpscared with wraith.
---
I‚Äôm talking about when going AGAINST the killer.
---
Mask in need to be a little more round. But u did a pretty good job already.
---
ttv = toxic survivor main = Mori time
---
said they were clipping the end game chat and the "exploit" like okay go off Claudette.
---
Can‚Äôt relate but you‚Äôre probably right
---
Blue blood prestige.
---
It's time for a crusade.
---
I hate selfies too, always put a bag on my head whenever somebody tries that shit with me
---
I play spirit I‚Äôve never really seen a problem with her but I play her cause she fun to play so I probably wouldn‚Äôt know the problem
---
Sounds un-fun for both sides. Classic dbd.
---
Killer rank btw
---
Alternative title:
---
"How to take advantage of 3 idiots cornering themselves."
---
I‚Äôve had three of these the past couple games I‚Äôve played. And it gets me mad every time. I grabbed one survivor vaulting a pallet and then randomly the animation stopped and she rain it while my killer did a missed swing animation.
---
I watched Scott Jund once and he was tea bagging and flash light clicking the whole game lmao never went back, Otz and Cope are the ones I like to watch.
---
It comes down to personal situation, if you play on green/purple ranks he might seem very good at the game, whereas if you are a solid rank 1 player you know he makes loads of mistakes, and theres something else to blame firstly before admitting any sort of wrongdoing. I think thats why some people dont enjoy his atitude.

Because he is a survivor, you can use any perks from other survivors if you have them. Personally I like having at least one of a character's teachable perks and both dead hard and We're going to live forever both work for me. From there, I usually run self care for solos and I'll switch up the last perk. I would just avoid no mither at all cost though. Good luck!
---
Survivors are all reskins, so it'd be the same perks as you'd use for any other survivor.
---
Strats depend on perks - if you're using meta perks, then meta strats. If you're going for his Adept then there's a few YouTube videos that can help you with that.
---
Explain
---
We have one DLC killer shown here. Weirdly.
---
I think it's because there is a type of person who ttv's their name vs someone who just streams their Gameplay.
---
It's scary how easy it it's to predict that shit now. Every time I oneshot someone from stealth with Ghostface I 100% expect them to DC and usually they do
---
I don‚Äôt know if you meant it like this, but ‚Äúthe jury is out‚Äù means something remains undecided
---
Huntress x Jake Park
---
Most enjoyable - Myers, Freddy (with pallets), Spirit
---
Least enjoyable - Trapper, Nurse, Hag
---
Stranger Things chapter won't even be out on the PTB today so you are not really in a rush. It comes out tomorrow.
---
While I disagree, the ‚Äúpick one‚Äù sass is new to me, so upvote.
---
Dang thatsa nice duck
---
The spirit must be *invited* in by the living in order to cross a doorway, in the native tongue of the dead, as spake of in the Necronomicon Ex Mortis
---
I don't think there's much to say about the killer because they weren't that good tbh, and the team kept getting downed.
---
Why are criticizing a RANT post? Ffs
---
JKGTW
---
I go for Billy for easy games, Nurse for complicated games, personally. I prefer Nurse but I'm on console so, like, don't expect me to be good at Nurse without a few hundred hours worth of practice.
---
strictly speaking there's 3 dlc killers but only 1 licenced killer, which is what i assume you mean
---
This right here. People dont seem to realize how much you screw your team over when you dc.
---
Played a game last night as a rank 12 killer vs rank 2, 2, 4, 11 survivors on haddenfield as bubba.  They made sure to let me know that NOED is a crutch (the guy I was chasing was injured and had adrenaline pop)...let‚Äôs also ignore the d-strikes, dead hards and Brand new part. 
---
Regardless I was just going for my 8 hooks and wasn‚Äôt planning on killing anyone but his teammates left.  I guess bubba gonna eat.
---
Ok
---
Ooh I had an idea, what if instead, ultimate hunter worked like a reverse Quick and quiet, by making interactions by survivors louder, such as jumping into a locker and grass rustling. Maybe increases distance you can hear gens being worked on?
---
Not increasing breathing noise because that‚Äôs stepping on Stridor‚Äôs toes, poor perk..
---
Entity loves you.
---
Should‚Äôve used dead hard... oof
---
Is it annoying? Yeah. But you‚Äôre not abusing flaws in perks/bugs/exploited, etc. You‚Äôre literally just using perks. So no, you can‚Äôt be banned.
---
He says stream sniping but it's likely killers who see he's streaming and hop on stream to watch where he's going and whatnot, not the usual "stream sniping" which involves a viewer trying to get into the same match as the streamer.
---
You‚Äôre really working on this aren‚Äôt you? Best of luck and more importantly, have fun.
---
I dont blame her tbh, ive seen OhTofu killing himself on hook on spirit games all the time, have you faced a rank 1 spirit? Whats the fun of playing vs a Op killer that literally takes no skill to use, very little counter to a strong game breaking power? I dont think the devs think what will people on the elite skill level will do with this type of killers, its all fun and games when we talking low/medium ranks, but when you go against the best killers in the game playing with a major advantage like spirit gives you, its not about losing, its simply not fun.
---
Yeah dont do this unless youre literally the biggest cunt out there
---
You have a pic with the knife in focus? That would look rly nice aswell. 
---
Good job with the susie!^^
---
What does it do? Am noob.
---
Bear traps only activate when a gen is completed. *You would expect that by now one of her weaker add-ons would have been changed to activate bear traps after this point, wouldn't you?*
---
Note that not all survivors realise bear traps have changed - some will still try and remove their trap, and others that are wearing an *active* trap will just run out of the gate and get popped.
---
Be aware that bear traps mean nothing to the hatch.
---
Pig used to have stronger endgame pressure, to be sure - traps and Blood Warden could help you claw some momentum back. Current traps are more like Ruin - they're a means for slowing down the game, giving the survivors something else to do. In that respect they're more in line with *most* other killer powers.
---
I don't do this, and mind you I'm not trying to be a friendly killer (it's just sub-optimal), but how you would do it is to hide behind something close to the hook so you're out of LOS.
---
OR, if you're facecamping, don't even go into stealth until the rescue animation starts. Then you go stealth to counter BT (BT only triggers within the TR of the killer, stealth GF has no TR). Better is to bring nurse's and MYC. Sneak back to the hook after starting a chase off a gen and you've got 2 downs and 3 off gens, easy.
---
No, Edgar has done it multiple times on stream with devs in his stream laughing. You won‚Äôt be banned.
---
Let em come, I'd rather hear what they have to say than just blindly dismiss them.
---
*Gets reported for working with killer cause he didnt wanna kill him. So he slugged cause of DC at the beginning of the game.
---
You mean without scratched mirror right?
---
I used WGLF to get points from protection hits... Rude.
---
It's not my comic, dude. I'm just a shitposter.
---
Mettle of Men activates after receiving three protective hits in the scoring event (which is shown on the right hand side during the game). For something to be considered a protective hit, the killer MUST hit you in close proximity to another survivor after an unhook or during a chase (from what I‚Äôve noticed). Once the perk is active, on the next hit when you‚Äôre injured, the dying state is ignored. After you fully heal, the killer has an aura reading on you if you‚Äôre farther than 12/14/16 m from them.
---
This needs to be the brain getting brighter and brighter template.  Final box: Putting twitch TTV in your name so you can see a mori.
---
I can‚Äôt remember the last time I had my guts eaten by Hag.
---
I recognise 'Takane' but I thought her name was Ene or something tbh, not a big anime person.
---
Not really. I have 600 hours in the game and as a furry, I've only ever been harassed for it once or twice, and It was because I sandbagged a hatch-camper and stole said hatch from him.
---
I feel the love.
---
If you enjoy being toxic to people, you have bigger problems than just video games.
---
Consider reflecting upon why you like hurting people in any form. Honestly that's not a good attitude to have.
---
Extra extra
---
Thinking of you
---
Literally tell them to read mad grit
---
Jeez, Ace looking fine he can heal me anyday...
---
I was thinking of something like that where everything is just louder and ur suggestion would probably make the perk way better. In my eyes the perk would be really good on something like lerys where if ur looking around the gen for them and they vault a window they get cucked over but I like ur idea much more
---
If you hook someone when the gates are open, the entity blocks the exit.
---
Thank you very much, glad you like it!
---
 Determination is just as broken as old legion. You can turn around and end a chase then turn around again and have a huge speed boost
---
One by one would work better as a STBFL stacking system, where hitting your obsession makes you lose tokens. If its a hex it would be cleansed too fast
---
No witnesses is just rancor but worse because it promotes tunneling the obsession
---
A team would make chases very difficult to win against a coordinated team. 5% speed is the difference between trapper and huntress speed, and having it reduced would be devastating. Far too strong.
---
Dissapearing act could work, if it was on a longer cooldown. Maybe having it trigger when you vault a window would be better
---
Strength is an awful perk. Might as well just give the killer a free hit
---
It blocks the exit gates for some time when they are opened and you've hooked a survivor.
---
Will you do other killers to?
---
only nurse and spirit, maybe billy dont need ruin.
---
&gt; Spirit can‚Äôt zoom across the map at 100mph and instadown someone in the first 10 seconds if the game. Spirit cant use bbq and instadown someone at the other side of the map, then zoom back to tunnel the first person hooked
---
If that unironically happens these are some potatoes getting whomped
---
&gt;She cant walk behind you while casually revving a chainsaw with no downside
---
Ah, so you're one of those people who thinks Billy is unfun or OP
---
&gt;yet nobody focuses on the fucking god windows
---
Literally everyone with a good head screwed on will say maps are the root of all problems with DBD's atrocious balancing issues. They'll bring up infinites on haddonfield/ ormond and the bullshit windows like cowshed or ironworks.
---
Generally though with what you said, I would say avoid letting yourself get looped here.
---
&gt;Not to mention there are still hundreds of safe loops in the game with no line of sight blockers, meaning no mindgames.
---
Yeah you just chew through them. They're the only great resource survivors got, and once they're used up they're done.
---
&gt;Like its ok for things on the survivor side to have little to no counter play
---
They absolutely have counter play, it's just one of the elements of the game you have to juggle. If you find yourself frustrated at *every* safe pallet (There's really not a lot on most maps) then idk man, you get used to it. I main killers like Wraith, Billy, Huntress and Hag, depending on the survivors I see queue up in Lobby. I try to play around with the pressure I think I can handle. I won't commit to chases in nasty setup areas unless I'm sure it's only possible for 1 or 2 survivors to be even touching a gen.
---
&gt;Adrenaline
---
Adrenaline has flat out counterplay, what do you mean
---
Don't slug or go for simple injures when there's 1 gen left, focus on hooking and just play it out. If you lose you lose- 5 gens being done means gg. Literally to counter adrenaline just don't lose.
---
Idk, I find killer very relaxing lately and I don't opt for overkill add-ons/ builds. Most lobbies are just so dumb as fuck, and if the survivors genuinely play well and use resources wisely, as long as I got like 8 hooks in minimum and all 4 stacks I'm perfectly happy. Sweating kills just isn't as fun as it used to be with how easy playing any killer has gotten on like 90% of maps.
---
And you're right, but it was my first time working with worbla and I'm actually really happy how it turned out :)
---
Who hurt you?
---
Dont complain her. She had some kind of Stockholm syndrom ? :(
---
how do you guys not know the meme, the legend, the one and only...
---
KILLER KEEMSTAR
---
LETS GEEEEET ROOOOOOOOOIIGHTTT INTO THE NEEEEEWS!
---
Well, maybe. But the message is still important.
---
Thank you!
---
And yes I have some with the knife in focus as well, but I didn't want to spam the subreddit with all those pictures
---
If you add a drop there it literally becomes a infinte though, so it's not that easy to fix
---
The devs lmao
---
And you could never ever cathc any survivor again in the house
---
It goes *somewhere*, though currently the players aren't privy to that information. u/Peanits might be using it to make a naughty and nice list, where you get rarer add-ons, "better" perks, and shorter queues if you have a lot of kudos - who knows? I suspect it'll get a lot more interesting once dedicated servers arrive and it becomes a lot easier to keep track of things.
---
People do get banned from DBD on console - note that this is an entirely separate process from any "blanket" punishment dished out by Sony or Microsoft.
---
Sorry I don‚Äôt know this is. Is he a YouTuber, gamer?
---
It remains interesting because of the dedicated servers.
---
Get that^^ just got an image in my head that it would look cool since you have alot of details in the mask etc.
---
Do you report people using the ironworks infinite as well? No? It's only fun to abuse map design as surv I guess
---
Like you can hear sabotaging, bones and repairs done at increased distances and slightly louder, I‚Äôm keeping off the healing and hiding side because poor Stridor is already unloved as it is.
---
Thanks for your help
---
I'm rank 1 killer too
---
If that's what makes you content, then by all means...but when you get to lower ranks you're going to end up watching her escape with no ability to stop it. So while your at the high levels learning...LEARN. you'll be happier in the long run. You may be able to kinda cheese out some players now because they don't know how to play well and killer is made to win against a surv but down the road you're going to get mopped and wish you learned why at these ranks. Imagine fortnite/COD... yeah, sit in the corner and wait for someone to run by and get a kill OR run around like a mad man dying all the time but eventually getting good enough to have a gun fight with multiple players. Understand my point? Idk I don't play fortnite.
---
Ace is the sophisticated snack you nibble on to impress the "adults" in the room.
---
He's a piece of shit YouTuber who gets off on attention.
---
- Dont lunge after a blink unless ur 100% sure you‚Äôll hit, as you‚Äôll get an extra second of cooldown.
---
- You can control the range of you blink even at max charge by aiming at the ground you want to tp to, eg. you could look straight down to appear in the same place you disappeared (sorry im struggling to explain it).
---
- Use range add ons, they are amazing
---
- When you start the game, blink towards the gens farthest from you, as there are probably survivors there
---
Imagine getting banned before hitting double digit followers lol
---
He's a youtube news channel who has been a main centrepiece in several dramas for the last 5 years of youtube.
---
There was the n-word controversy, the Keemstar vs Leafy, the Keemstar vs Idubbz, the keemstar KSI vs Deji, the keemstar Logan vs Ksi... the list goes on and on. It's like a drama show, but real.
---
the king said it releases september 3rd tuedsay which is today
---
Oof that burn but we can agree that David can heal us anyday
---
Everyone makes mistakes. Still he makes really good moves and wins hard games
---
Uhh there is also the balance changes, bug fixes and the new friends system.
---
Plenty of reason to play besides new characters the whole patch besides them is today.
---
I will upload it at some point on this sub, but not sure when ~
---
If you want to see it I can send it to you or give you my Twitter, cause I already uploaded it there
---
And he's not nearly as grouchy about it as AngryPug, who pulls similar numbers. That whiny alcoholic is going to give himself a brain aneurysm if he keeps playing this game which he hates ever so much.
---
One of the best perks to use blood warden with, though it'll kinda screw your early game a bit.
---
Right so in others don‚Äôt even bother with the guy
---
 definitely buy ruin in the shrine if u can
---
then nurses and sloppy.
---
Is there a Steve version of this ?
---
Oh sure!^^
---
The ptb does but not the stranger things bit is what he was saying.
---
You got it right
---
o yea by bad
---
Unless you're super high rank, those are pretty much free tbh. Especially with decent add-ons.
---
In the instance of a player giving commendations to another player, they‚Äôre not notified about it. I‚Äôm sure Behavior does collect data on this, but it‚Äôs pointless since there‚Äôs no reward system to it (like Overwatch). So, at the moment, it does go into the void.

---
Oh on xbox hag,doctor,huntress and nurse are free, myers isnt though
---
Game 1 yesterday: I hit every single hex skill check
---
Game 2 yesterday: I missed every single skillchecks, even popped gens a couple of times.
---
Why? Who the fuck knows. Probably has to do with the inconsistent skippy frames on the skillchecks themselves.
---
I never seen anyone camp with ghostfsce is that his reputation? When I play him I ferociously hunt people like in the movies only attacking if thier alone unless there toxic (I bring lerys and the game offerings alot) then again I play on console as a rank 1
---
If they considered all of these reports... more than 50% of the community will be banned. Lmao
---
I assume you mean which killer or generic killer perk.
---
 It‚Äôs a Freddy Teachable.
---
I‚Äôm tempted to use my twitch name when playing even though I never stream just to see if I get tunnelled more often.
---
yes they are, there are no legal consequences for them banning people, they can ban whoever the fuck they like for whatever reason they want.
---
oh shit dog props! who you maining in R1 that ain't the big 3?
---
Literally me whenever I play Hillbilly
---
Imagine responding imagining anyone gives a fuck about YOUR half brain cell queef; about who thinks what about anything. Drink cum queer.
---
yes please
---
Playing with dumb survivors gets me 1,000 times more upset then any killer ever has.
---
I heard the bong at the DC
---
Honestly, if you are going to be scrolling through reddit you have to have a thick skin. It is a terrible place if you took everything seriously.  Memes are memes. They're meant to be funny. Take a break from it if you can't enjoy it üòä.
---
Huntress is left handed isn't she?
---
Hey I knew that too. Does this make us dual kings?
---
Depending on your rank you'll either have a rough time or a good time, not because I think ranks = skill but because more experienced survivors know how to play against the doctor.
---
To be honest just put your link in your profile bio and not your name, if a person goes to your profile then they're probably interested in you in one way or another, but putting it in your name is just annoying and makes you seem like a fucking clown when you act like an asshat.
---
Oh, I play The Huntress or The Clown most of the time, but Nurse is what I pick against Swfs if I have prior experience with them. 
---
Leveling The Plague right now to start playing her.  : )
---
Nobody really knows advanced hatchet dodges / loop techs except a few really experienced players, so The Huntress is a solid pick, in any rank. Unfortunately large maps like Mother's dwelling screw her bad.
---
Of course that's a thing.
---
Jojo references are everywhere I go, I can't find a sub that doesn't make jojo references. This shit is just getting old
---
Don't threaten me with a good time
---
Oh they already got on that? Word
---
Did you just call someone sad for using DH, that's pretty sad dude. You need to hook five people and have them be unhooked 24(?) meters away and you also need to be lucky for the totem to stay up.
---
He's a good dude but says a lot of stupid shit and can often come off as very rude or condescensing when someone questions him. At least in my experience.
---
Waking up distinguishes between fake pallets and real but once your hit your back in dream world. His traps are alot like clowns gas but when you run over them they dissapear ( I think). He can teleport to gens, so when it starts spewing blood he may be appearing. He's definitely got some power now so don't think you can play like you used to. I usually wake up when possible and drop any dream pallets I know are fake (but have definitely dropped real ones and that sucks). God tier lunge still a thing tho. Lol
---
Urm. Yes. And so is content from Saw, Ghostface, and Evil Dead, etc. but they aren‚Äôt in the meme above...
---
Does anyone watch Tyde anymore?
---
I hate that shit,  she had megs worst hairstyle too
---
Library &gt; Right click 'Dead by Daylight' &gt; Properties &gt; Betas &gt; Opt into beta (when its available)
---
No sense adding extra details that confuse things :P
---
Sorry to be that guy... but brought.
---
I mean the keemstar screaming clip is from him playing rocket league
---
Well that gave me a good idea for the UR addon so yes.
---
&gt; this is really biased and twisted
---
...have you seen the survivors ranting about how killers should play?
---
&gt; there's so many other killers that I'd happily die to if the matchup felt fair and like they earned it.
---
So losing two-three survivors because of a key they found is fair?
---
This game relies on RNG so it's never going to be totally fair.
---
&gt; just because survivors don't like your anime waifu doesn't mean they're just salty and saying so is really ignorant. instead you could try sympathising with them and listening to their complaints, then form and opinion and maybe suggest some changes that could be added without just hard nerfing.
---
Look, pal.  I play survivor almost as much as I play killer nowadays, sometimes more survivor than killer due to how chill it is.  Nurse has complete bullshit as her power, sure, but unless running the right addons she's somewhat difficult to juke.  Just don't be in an open area and keep making her guess (kind of like Spirit) where you're going and yet the survivors have been trying for many months to get her nerfed.  Now it'll be the same for Spirit, the survivors will try for many months to get her nerfed when she doesn't need it.  She has counterplay.  Learn it.
---
&gt; not all survivors think the same thing so obviously some dislike nurse more than others, WE ARE ENTITLED TO OUR OWN OPINIONS. unlike you we're not a hive mind.
---
Survivor opinion got Freddy gutted day one and turned him into a living meme for so long before the rework.  I'll never forgive them for that.  Survivor opinion is also louder due to there being more of you so there's that.
---
&gt; but what am i saying, reddit killer mains are always biased and refuse to listen to genuine complaints. i tried.
---
You mean like how BHVR took so long to listen to killers and FINALLY nerf certain maps (Badham, Coldwind's transparent walls)?  Keep playing the victim here, pal.  
---
Cause we all know survivors are soft, cuddly widdle cuties that killers must P R O T E C C.
---
BM?  Abusing cheese loops?  Taking advantage of survivor-biased bugs/glitches in the most spectacular fashion?  Nah.  They don't do that.  Never.
---
I strategically run kindred and open handed all the time since he came out
---
Are you beating them too quickly? You need to really farm at lower levels to make sure you don‚Äôt de pip.
---
I‚Äôm a solo que player and my teammates are usually around the same rank as the killer. Matches take a pretty long time but somehow I‚Äôm still depipping every game D:
---
Huntress is free on Xbox? I only have Trapper, Wraith, Nurse, Hag, Hillbilly and Doctor.
---
you guys will like anyting, god this is shit
---
*What the fuck did you just bring upon this cursed land*
---
Sounds good! Thank you for following up
---
No.  We really shouldn't.  
---
By your logic, we should HAPPILY deal with whatever BM/stupidity the survivors throw at us because survivors wanna have FUN.  That doesn't sound screwed up at all to you?
---
Scary to expose yourself like that but I appreciate it :) I had some luck in nerfing the crap out of the resolution slider. Bumped graphics up to medium and resolution down to like 40 and the game runs a lot smoother.
---
^
---
You just wrote a short story, congrats.
---
It is like saying that, but only one statement is true. Dead hard is a perk that anyone can have once it's teachable. This person is saying that if you put enough BP into claudette to have bloody clothing, you should be good enough to live without it. It was never meant to be another advantage or "crutch". Nobody is saying you can't use it (by any means, the bloody cosmetics are awesome) but if you're bad, then don't be mad that the above comment directly applies to you XD
---
DBD Duesday
---
Yep, and you don't know if you get tunneled and need ds.
---
Or you don't know if the trial will reach endgame and adrenalin will be useful.
---
Or if there will be a ruin/noed and small game will be useful.
---
Perks are situational, if you don't want to run them every game, then don't, but then you need to deal with those situation.
---
Like with prayer beads you'll have to be paranoid. If you don't know where the spirit is you might wanna watch out for crows nearby, or if worst comes to worst gen tap until you are positive that the spirit is somewhere else.
---
Yeah, I know. Just Michael is licensed, you gotta buy him to play him, makes no sense to me why he's there.
---
Her perks suck?
---
both are big fag losers
---
Go to the xbox store,I'm pretty sure you have to install her
---
You need the maximum range addons if you wanna be super op. Them bad boys will make anyone a rank 1 nurse
---
What if swf
---
Wanted to bully the killer
---
But the killer said
---
Franklin's demise + Haunted Grounds + Ruin + Nurse's calling
---
You just wrote a short story about complaining OP.
---
Why would you think this is a joke?
---
You just wrote a short story, congrats OP.
---
Noice
---
I may start streaming again just so I can be moried by Legion and Ghostface. UwU
---
I‚Äôve got 9000 shards saved up. Been thinking of getting the clown. Enjoying him?
---
You mean, when EGC glitched and didn't slow down when person got downed/hooked?
---
Is this it? Are Death Note memes gonna be a thing now? Its about time.
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm a fucking coward
---
I really think our differing opinions are based on what we believe is considered a "WIN". I get chased for 2-3 gens then face camped-I died but still considered that a win...even if it was the last gens. Sure, it's endgame and if you leave me then I may escape but I'm laughing at the killer the whole time because i won. All survivors die and killer gets hatch before I find it but I hide until endgame kills me-win. You see where I'm going with this. Escaping the trial hasn't been the objective for me since my first time hitting red rank ! Only to do well in chases. From what I've seen on here from killers is that they/or you consider a win by killing everyone. Whether that be slugging or face camping or whatever and they/you are willing to do anything possible to get that. Let's say I'm playing killer (I do.rank 7) and I get looped for 2 gens. That survivor won because if the other 3 are as good as them then they could do basically 8 gens while only being hooked once! They only need 5! Are you following me here? Hell if they only got 1 gen done I lost...but I never cared about how many escaped! Only whether or not I played well in chase! Survivors will come for that unhook but your playing the game in reverse! Killer's look for survivors and survivors run/hide. You are waiting for the survivors to come to you and they will with bt and insta heals and then you'll be so upset you'll come here and complain about how op survivors and instas are instead of getting better at your gameplay (HYPOTHETICALLY!!!!). NOT SAYING YOU DO/WILL!!!
---
I have not seen one ounce of nurse porn I‚Äôve seen hag and the spirit
---
Good luck!
---
Your forgot Nea bro
---
He‚Äôs pretty fun. Great anti Looper, and solid perks. Just have to lock down the aiming his vials but he‚Äôs great.
---
It has an enter code option, is there a code required? Also thanks for the help!!
---
Almost! Infectious Fright, thats what i mean with Shit your pants (The devs said that it was the betas name for the perk, so we call it syp).
---
She was very shy, not very confident and held back, plus her relationship with her brother was not great.
---
Throughout the show she becomes a caring, selfless and brave character, her relationship with her brother improved. She becomes a key asset to the team but could also get stuff done independently.
---
I hate those plus it makes survivors feel so stupid  when they loop you around a dream pallet
---
Oh, alright. Thanks! I'll see if I can. That's kinda confusing but oh well, glad to know I get one extra Killer around.
---
This sums it up
---
Friken jojos reference
---
Not the guy you replied to, but being stalked by someone crouching is fucking annoying. At least with Myers, you can see his stalking because he's as big as a house.
---
I ain't mad on any of the statements made above. I'm just giving my opinion. I said I enjoy bloody clothing because it HELPS you play the game. We could say going with any perk is a crutch and your bad at the game unless you go perkless. It's just about helping out your different advantages.
---
yeah im on PC sometimes on ps4 as well, i dont really use iron maiden on huntress i just thought the tag sounded nice altogether :)
---
Where did you buy this costume from? I‚Äôve been looking at a few of them online.
---
It was an exaggeration and I see now people take it too far. Honestly I don't get moried that much because no one honestly fucking cares.
---
Found the survivor main
---
Gotcha sorry mate
---
Teletabies
---
Noooo my greatest weakness
---
Sigh. Another comment which is repeating everything else. 
---
I don't care IF I get moried mate. I just enjoy how the bloody cosmetics look.
---
What happened to a certain character in S2 is my guess
---
he‚Äôs gonna go back in time and play og Legion so he can have more control while being fast as fuck boiii
---
Congratulations! Have poor man's gold!
---
üèÖ
---
If that's what you see as a win why are you so upset by face camping on this situation? I mean, that Laurie obviously won. In that situation I wouldn't care about winning but I would still try my damnedest to get some kills for those sweet blood points, I'm not one to give up mid trial.
---
I honestly don't get it. I'm getting so much hate for just doing something I enjoy.
---
No I was exaggerating which people find to take pretty far.
---
Just about all of the feedback you can give in the end game screen is used.
---
The rate match score doesn't do anything on its own, but it's used by our team to spot trends (e.g. Almost every time someone plays X killer on Y map, they give it a low score). It's just an extra way for us to get feedback from a wide range of people rather than the few who go to forums, Reddit, etc.
---
Reports are definitely used. We've got a team of ACMs dedicated to reviewing reports. Reports alone don't do anything; someone won't get banned just because they have a lot of reports. We will always review them first and make sure they are true before taking action.
---
The only bit that doesn't quite serve a purpose right now are the props. They're saved and we can see them, but they currently do not serve a purpose.
---
And in one fell swoop, we got millions complaining
---
Its so fun when survivors have no ideaüòÇ

When was he removed? I thought they just added him to consoles.

When you "grab" the survivor out of the locker but jump out at the last second with head on, stunning you in the grab animation.
---
oink
---
They weren‚Äôt that good but they got a 3K and won the game? What are you trying to say?
---
I mean from what I‚Äôve seen she‚Äôs a slut so I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll do you
---
It like that all over?
---
Props to Samination for keeping up the creativity in the DbD community
---
Got me good
---
I still have like 3 episodes left in season 3 but I‚Äôve only seen her be a slut and then a brat. Steve is much better at character development and being a team player
---
Hopper is dope though.
---
I didn't know batman was in this game
---
- eats and eats but skinny
---
- feels left out
---
- caffeine and regret
---
Never thought I‚Äôd relate the the Hag so much.
---
I think that in red-purple ranks it only works one time, then the killer knows you have it and will counter it.
---
A slut? What the fuck?
---
&gt;I'm p3 claudette but the amount of moris against me made me start to prestige my bill.
---
This initial comment implies you are frustrated with the treatment you are receiving - i.e, the targetted moris due you being P3 claudette
---
First she sleeps with Steve and then yeah the creepy stalking picture dude, Jonathon. 
---
Which sucks because I actually used to like Jonathan but him being with her makes me hate him too.
---

---
No cause that rabbit isn't killing most things
---
We live in a society
---
Didn't notice sarcasm lol haha
---
"He's to dangerous to be kept alive!"
---
Oh those mean survivors wouldnt dignify playing against your busted add ons? 
---
Better go cry about it on reddit. You sure showed them.
---
I love how the title of the video mentions a tunneling wraith even though the survivors are the ones being stupid here by farming each other off the hook right next to the killer.
---
It‚Äôs all randomized
---
Yeah it's chill lol it's not easy with text
---
Hah XD
---
Yeah get them through the exit games fast so you can waste 15 minutes in queue and loading screens until the next game that may get canceled because someone DC'd during the loading screen.
---
Which, incidentally, is why the survivors DC'd. Believe it or not but survivors are trying to have fun too. 
---
You wanted a breeze easy 4k, and you got it. Pat yourself on the back buddy. You did it.
---
Most enjoyable:Everyone except Spirit.

Least enjoyable:Spirit

Not imo. Nancy is.

---
I usually don't bother to wake up unless he's using fake pallets. The gen teleport is pretty annoying, but it has a pretty long recharge time. I really like playing as him after all the changes. Against him is another story lol.
---
Well, yeah. But it would make more sense when he doesn't have a trap to do a simple machete slash.
---
Your opinion freaking SUCKS THEN! 
---
Jk enjoy whoever you want. Even though I will never understand lol.
---
Double emblem points for the killer, yay!
---
Nah, that just says that OP is also farming blood points (like everyone), not that he also uses WGLF and this was satire.
---
I never took it as dead serious either, but the criticism points in the text sure strike me as seriously meant, even if cloaked in jest a bit.
---
Bob was better than Hopper.
---
No, it's not, if you open your perk list, the first slot represents the botton one, then follow: left, right and Up
---
I just played a game last night against the hag. Her jump scares are single handedly terrifying. I jumped everytime I triggered her trap.
---
He has gotten me to say that everytime  I get a head-on play. It's like a ritual now. Thank you fam XD
---
I‚Äôd prioritize matchmaking, but yeah this would be good
---
Myers with the perk Monitor &amp; Abuse reduces his terror radius to 0 when in tier 1 and not in a chase. You can also run the perk and the Dead Rabbit addon to have a 2m terror radius in tier 2.
---
WTF was that King Crimson shit?
---
Don't feel bad about it. In my opinion he is hard to play. You will get it soon. ^^
---
bubba is extremely hated because he is the best killer to punish extreme altruism
---
Well they‚Äôre never in the same spot for me
---
Once happened against a nurse and some meg, they basically farmed hooked survivors and gave them no chance of escaping. The two idiots werent even able to prevent all 5 gens from being done so I senaked around them easily opened a gate. Best thing is that as soon as I escaped the nurse turned on meg and killed her it was like a "you did your job wrong so now I kill you" kinda situation
---
Shit man you right
---
Itt, a million immersed bloody Claudettes complaining about unfun one sided gameplay
---
They could just add a hole in the floor somewhere.
---
I think I‚Äôm just gonna past out again
---
‚ÄúFuck she has beads‚Äù 
---
The real tea.
---
Myers's terror radius depends on his Evil Within level. They were probably using add-ons like Scratched Mirror that makes them stay in EW1 and/or Dead Rabbit to reduce their Terror Radius.
---
If you don't have Ruin you're gonna have a bad time.
---
You escape within three seconds of starting the game? Sick? I have to do gens and loop the killer to do that.
---
You can't use it while healthy
---
She was in love with Steve. As for Jonathan they connected over missing loved ones and a spooky alternate reality with monsters so it's no surprise their relationship escalated the way it did. No need to slut shame.
---
I don‚Äôt think so. I liked Bob too but he was super one dimensional, but he wasn‚Äôt really around long enough for them to give him anymore than that I guess.
---
I was really wanting him to end up being a bad guy though lol. Like ‚ÄúJoyce you idiot I was just waiting for an opportunity to kidnap Will for the Russians!‚Äù Or something like that lol.
---
It is kinda viable of Plague, since the cheeky bastards don't feel like purging most of the time but in the end the numbers on it just don't make enough of a difference imo
---
What's BHVR?
---
I know, man. I just find it weird the creator felt it was necessary.
---
I hate to be that guy but there are no kicks in judo.
---
The general consensus is that Thana‚Äôs values are too small to make the perk good, but Plague is the best killer to run the perk on. Its either gonna make survivors think they should cleanse which benefits you, or the survivors don‚Äôt cleanse and you keep that 15% debuff all game which isn‚Äôt too bad.
---
Really most meta perks apply to her as well. Whispers, PGTW, Enduring, Discordance, etc.
---
I was about to comment that, thank you, kind stranger.
---
Thanks yall
---
I really just wrote a title.
---
Lets not forget that he made fun of mental health and Etika, then when Etika died, kept talking about how they were such good friends and how mental health is no joke.
---
If he joins I swear to the Entity to burn all my ultra rares/moris on his ass specifically.
---
AFAIK the rarity bump is negligible and affects mostly white items not appearing as much
---
This happened to me the other day with a toxic laggy ghostface. Yeah I cried and died.
---
that is not true at all lol
---
How/Where or Can i even find somewhere how many hours i have on dbd on ps4?
---
I prestige them all because I can't stand the sight of the Prestige button taunting me. I'm weak uwu
---
Fire up is nightmare on elm street 2 and the power has his face on it
---
You're banned from making memes
---
I don‚Äôt really remember her doing very much besides having to deal with a very 2D cast of misogynists that felt more like artificial roadblocks than anything
---
It would certainly be a useful resource, which is why I'd be surprised if it doesn't already exist somewhere - one would expect the wiki to be using something like that to keep their info accurate (although given the fact that some scoring events are missing from the Bloodpoints entry, perhaps it's not feasible for them).
---
Looking forward to seeing your contest video!
---
No offense man but that'd be straight up broken. Even half of that would make the trapper S tier.
---
The Stranger Things chapter comes on the 4th so like yeah
---
Never have I read a comment so dumber than yours in this sub.
---
&gt;toxic high rank survivors they'll drag match out forever just to bully you
---
If you aren't playing killer agressively, you shouldn't expect any kills, period. Killers who know how to patrol well and mindgame survivors will have no problem at all.
---
If you are not doing any of the above while playing killer, then you ARE playing killer wrong.
---
No idea why killer players in this community feel so entitled for kills by doing nothing, and whining about survivors 'making them work' for said kills. Do survivor players automatically escape when they enter the game? Nope. They do work as well.
---
Escape the chase
---
i found bottle of champagne
---
it empty though
---
After the rework, Freddy is much more fun to play and a stronger match up against survivors regardless, making him a worthwhile addition to your collection. Blood Warden would be a cherry on the top for you.
---
&gt; *Someone*
---
***Kono DeadQthulhu da!***
---
How far do reports on DCers go? I realise it goes under unsportsmanlike and I've been both actively reporting recently and encouraging others to do so.
---
Those look quality, nice work
---
Can i just say how amused i am that this sub thinks there will be a bunch of new players that will love this game beacuse of stranger things and yet ever since i got back to playing on xbox people ragequit 9/10 games... especially if they are the first downed. This is at low ranks btw... i really don't understand why people think this game will be revitalised when you can barely play a proper match against 4 survivors or play as a survivor without teammates rage quitting. That's not to mention the long ass time for killers to find a game... honestly i really like this game but it's ridiculous to think it can continue like this. 
---
Maybe this is just a low to mid rank xbox problem, but i have my doubts.
---
I thought it was a joke because of the crayons, then I saw you were serious. 
---
Spirit it's one of the 3 top viable Killers for a reason, you just don't get it.
---
People here already stated, very good reasons why your proposal it's full of errors. Try harder next time.
---
one is a silhouette, just a shape. its basic and could be anyone... it could be fucking Kevin Bacon standing there with a glove and a fedora. its a drawing.... same with the power. its just a generic drawing of the character Freddy. the overall killer and lore used is based off the 2010 remake that is universally hated.
---
She never "hardly" knew him though.
---
I am and thank you very much. I just hope the end result is something you'll all enjoy.
---
If they made the exposed 30 seconds at Max rank it should be fine
---
Somebody's offended. Not exactly my fault I'm right but ok gamer
---
 [It's true, unfortunately](https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1168725930216501248).
---
But ghostface has the natural skill of camping
---
demi has the right idea you might wanna get on his level
---
I play PC and the only free to play Killers I was given at the beginning was trapper, wraith, hillbilly, nurse, and huntress. The rest I have to purchase. When I said dlc killers, I meant the rest of the non free ones listed as the list showed Michael and the hag, two id have to purchase to play.
---
The dev's for the game
---
True. True.
---
Haha poor nurse
---
Built-in insidious!
---
This proves why dead hard, No mither,  self care, and Solidarity are op. She would have lived if she had it
---
We wouldn't know.
---
Did you check the emblems after each match to see what was lacking?
---
&gt; They hated Jesus because he told them the truth
---
Oink
---
Are Thanatophobia or Pop Goes The Weasel or even Sloppy Butcher a good replacement for Ruin? I always run Ruin but sometimes when a player spawns right by it, I play the entire game with three perks. How does the math add up when compared to those three when it comes to slowing the game down (just a little bit).
---
Does Adrenaline cleanse you when playing The Plague? Or is that only for waking you up against Freddy and healing you against all other killers?
---
So that‚Äôs why you hate me? Thanks I guess
---
Beads are strong, but I like to stack movement speed add ons, for the speed hax.
---
Nah sounds kinda stressful/fun
---
Bath water lady just wants to clicky clicky her flashlight too. Smh.
---
So accurate
---
dont shake your head it might break your spine just like what bubba is gonna do to you after you disrespected him keep shaking your head
---
Why don‚Äôt they just add a drop down from the top of the house? Because it‚Äôs meant to give the killer a free hit anytime you‚Äôre up there?
---
Is this on Youtube? Would love to add it to a playlist I‚Äôve got
---
Doctor because you can find people easily and top that off with some sight perks (BBQ&amp;C, DeerStalker, Nurses Calling, and Bloodhound) you can easily make the survivors suffer or rage quit
---
When is you next stream i wanna watch
---
What‚Äôs wrong with protection hits at the moment?
---
Not gonna lie, whenever I face a doctor I get the slight urge to DC.
---
He's way too powerful for me.
---
They don't register when the should sometimes.
---
How am I being toxic? I'm just showing an exploit/bug/design flaw that the developers should pay attention to
---
PGTW is definitely a good perk, especially on mobile killers.
---
Thanat is not a good replacement. It‚Äôs really only a viable perk on the Plague, the numbers are just too small to make a meaningful impact. If you want a little math example, a gen takes 80 seconds solo to complete, and 44.44 seconds to complete with 2 people. You are unlikely to have more than 2 stacks of thanat outside of plague. 1 stack is adding on 4.8 seconds to a solo gen, and 2.6 seconds to 2 people on a gen. 2 stacks adds on 7 seconds to a solo and 4 seconds to a 2 person gen.
---
The numbers just aren‚Äôt that good :(
---
I‚Äôm excited for the ptb even though I‚Äôm on ps4 mostly just want to see demogoron add-ons.
---
This was in hot like yesterday...
---
I always like to think that I‚Äôm Nightcrawler or The Flash when this happens and (just as you said), I just have fun and mess around.
---
why dont we make the survivors spawn on basement hooks when they start the match THAT WOULD  BE A GREAT IDEA
---
Yeah! Git gud! Stop whining. 
---
*Proceeds to whine for 3 paragraphs*
---
people DC to me all the time. i get it though its such a troll build lol
---
Incredibly disappointed to hear that! Especially because I'm always careful in my reporting where I consider if they could have had connectivity issues (I won't report) or if it appears more malicious (i.e they get downed then DCed)
---
Dedicated servers and punishment for rage quitters are both on he horizon from what I‚Äôve read
---
I almost always DC. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs too powerful he‚Äôs just super annoying and I play the game to have fun not to be annoyed to death lol.
---
It's not holding the game hostage but using a design flaw to get an advantage. Whatever the semantics, this demonstrates that the killer can abuse this and hold the game hostage if the ECG had not started. It's a gray area that the devs must decide for themselves.
---
Voice chat turns the game 100% into the survivor‚Äôs favor. Big time. No comms keeps it even. That‚Äôs what many people dodge SWF.
---
You must have awful comprehension skills if you think that was 'whining' hahahahahahahaha
---
What stage?
---
If he were to DC during the loading screen, he'd really only be screwing the TTV hating killer over since everyone would just go requeue and killer queue times are far longer.
---
One could even argue he's saving his survivor teammates from the mori, assuming he only DC'd when seeing the hidden offering.
---
It's very common unfortunately. Huntress axe hitbox is stupid and broken
---
I wish he‚Äôd let me go lol or at least followed me into the basement
---
Second question from me today. I notice in some games where a killer doesn't run an obsession perk/add-on, there may be an obsession on a survivor. This can be where there are no survivor perks present in the game, or in today's case, where another survivor has an obsession perk. Is this a blip/random occurance or is there a mechanic I'm not seeing?
---
I think most perks are good as is, and some people are pussy's (Killer and survivor), but noed does need a nerf. It seems like people want the exposed to completely be gone from noed, but I see that as being to harsh. I think that noed should be like hope or haunted grounds, lasting a somewhat long but somewhat short duration as long as 1 totem was alive while the last gen popped. That totem can be cleansed to get rid of it, and if the timer for it runs out, the totem automatically breaks. The survivors could counter this perk by just waiting it out, but that could lead to them getting caught. The killer could counter this by opening a gate to start the egc, but then that would risk the survivors escaping through the door.
---
Anyone but nurse. I still have nightmares of playing her
---
*insert cloaker noises*
---
hit boxes in the game are literal boxes. it doesnt always have to actually hit your body to hit you
---
&gt; Besides, plenty of lower rank survivors get paired against high rank killers with moris, so no idea why you are complaining.
---
it's almost as if neither of those things should happen whoa
---
&gt; Just get used to it because there's plenty you can learn playing against red rank players.
---
You learn by playing people in your relative skill level. You do not learn when you are totally out of your league against people using comms. Getting steamrolled does not have educational value, despite what 80s movie montages say
---
Good ol' 99-5 gen strats
---
Jeez youre really gettin it today from these ignorant people who dont read your comments first xd
---
\*Dresses up as Myers and does the Orange justice\*  
---
Downvote me, you know what I'm doing is actually pretty funny.
---
I also main huntress but iridecent head and infantry belt feels so tryhard that I feel sorry for survivors to use it
---
wth, why so many downvotes?
---
trapper. i love playing him because imo there is no better feeling in the game than watching a survivor running straight into a trap during a chase.
---
I'm on the red ranks you arrogant bastard (playing a low tier killer btw), so I have seen all kinds of survivors, from God tier to scrubs, using all kind of perks, from meta to niche, and not once I have complained. I take my wins and losses and move on but I'm not one to just extend the red carpet and lead you trough the gate even on a bad game. So you can leave you prejudice at the door.
---
Correction ‚Äúbut I need this‚Äù
---
Well if they want to repeat it I wont mind no matter how annoying it is.
---
Have yet to see this happen tbh
---
Its Patrick Bateman in American psycho
---
Nice. I've seen gameplay of him, he looks pretty fun.
---
exactly, if you just stop trying to win and mess around (with your friends if playing swf) it's way more enjoyable and quite a fun experience as long as it doesn't happen too frequently.
---
There is an obsession in the game as long as a single obsession perk/addon is being used, regardless if it‚Äôs survivor or killer. If no obsession perks/addon is being used by anyone, then there is no obsession that game.
---
The doc Is med school
---
To clarify, they *do* act on people who disconnect often. They simply don't need to rely on player reports because they can track it more efficiently on their own.
---
Hahaha "saltiest game on the internet" 
---
have you played rust lol
---
Because the Prestige button in the middle of the bloodweb taunts me and my will is weak
---
Yeah that‚Äôs a fair point, if there were more players I think this would be a really intense mode, if you are the first one found and die on the hook, that‚Äôs just the way it goes.
---
Nothing slows down the game like Ruin and you don't even have to do anything. It puts pressure on less experienced survs to waste time looking for a totem
---
" *everyone* who plays the game a bit will reach Devotion 69 or 69 hours at some point ," specifically those who play 69 hours.
---
it is bodyblocking, that is reportable
---
As someone who wants to use Mettle of Man + WGLF on my Ash regularly; this is such a desire of mine. Like if BHVR wants to nerf Ash's highest perk, at least let it work with the new restrictions. 
---
PS - I know people will ask so the nerf to Mettle of Man was that it FORMERLY only took 3 regular hits to activate the power. NOW it takes 3 *protection* hits to activate the perk.
---
you mean the superior one
---
I actually use doctor so thats accurate
---
Same. One time my internet forced me to quit after a long chase and I had just downed the guy. I got 3 "you mad?" messages. Lmao
---
I never said it does but if someone is racist to you ,you probably won't have a problem to be racist to them
---
I main Billy, because it‚Äôs fun to just zoom across the map looking for survivors instead of slowly walking, and then deleting them if I see them because I‚Äôm a fucking surgeon with a chainsaw.
---
The new Freddy 
---
I love his new kit and always leave the game with a 4K
---
Have so many games where I‚Äôm chasing someone and I dream project to a generator they are running towards and I down them lol I can only imagine the scare lol
---
And dream pallets are hilarious survivors just stop using all the pallets and that‚Äôs an easy down for me üòé
---
I just wish.. his mor√≠ was better, like can I just see a hole in the chest so It feels more intense
---
I mean, I totally am a toxic survivor so
---
yeah
---
Freddy. Big fan of the movies. His re-work was great even though he should start the match with full teleport power. He's slightly better than Billy IMO. Prestige Freddy looks a little bit more like Robert Englund.
---
The UI changes sound great, I'd have to have more of a think on the functionality changes though - there's a lot going on there that'll take me time to unpack.
---
Isn't the timer currently 150s (2.5 minutes), not 90s (1.5 minutes)?
---
Dead rabbit addon + rank 3 monitor and abuse perk = zero terror radius Michael.
---
They each take off 8m and his TR is only 16M in tier2
---
Pig, she has a little bit of everything. She's stealthy, she has traps that work like a built in game slower and she has the dash for mindgames.
---
works once = successful advertising
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how few images of the bar there are on google.
---
Pretty sure the wording is ‚Äúwhen a generator is completed‚Äù.
---
Saucy Quentin is sexy, but should only happen if his face is fixed in game. Otherwise no naked Gollums please.
---
I cant lie. that's humourous
---
No, cuz that is a perk, first you gotta have the perk and 2nd you must hook someone to activate it. That means you must work for it, unlike this.
---
I really hope they don't buff insidious.
---
Seriously, someone ban this guy. This is terrible.
---
I could upload it to youtube
---
Nice catch, ya that's my bad, it's not supposed to say 90 seconds.
---
To 135, down from 150.
---
No, missed skillchecks only
---
No problem. I'm not that exprienced anyways (I got 70 hours in the game).
---
Advice taken!
---
That‚Äôd be dope.
---
Plus if you‚Äôve got any other tracks, I‚Äôm a huge fan of synth, so you probably got a subscriber on your hands ;p
---
Thank you very much!
---
I don't plan on making Ghostface right now. I prefer to be commissioned for these things, this was actually a gift that a friend won in my Twitch stream, so I made it on stream and had a lot of fun.
---
Me personally I like hillbilly mainly because of how quick he can just go across the map and because I‚Äôm on console he‚Äôs a bit easier to play but I like most killers I used to play a lot of trapper and hag but recently stopped playing them as much because of of hags slow movement speed and how i have my trapper fairly high level I also enjoy Michael and doctor quite a bit Doctor‚Äôs fun because of just how much he can do I don‚Äôt really enjoy the plague or legion because neither of them have like really cool thing you can do (except jumping over a pallet a legion) were billy can do like cool chainsaw charges and trapper and hag tricking people into their traps doctor and Michael just being able to 4K well and doctor is just cool stylistic wise
---
You mean, the fact we see a killer and it says "attempt to escape" in the middle of the screen doesn't give it away?
---
Yup. DBD is saltier.
---
Just wanted to post it in reddit to see if anyone would see at all. I wasnt expecting this many upvotes already!
---
Meant to ask this on my first question. Sorry for breaking the rules. 
---
Anyway, what is the speed of Billy‚Äôs Chainsaw Sprint? It‚Äôs faster than a survivor‚Äôs sprint burst at 150% it appears. How fast is it?
---
We already have confirmed consent from Kyle Gallner to use his likeness (on twitter). If we can get him to agree to it for free, we would have every reason for normal looking Quentin.
---
Thanks! It was quite a lot of fun to put together. I laughed a lot because during the process, when making his weapon, I was like, "Man, Bubba looks like he's got a corndog on a stick right now,"
---
What? i literally just said he was racist, that's it. Then you replied;
---
&gt;The guy that he said the racist things to was racist to him about being Italian **so you have no idea what you are talkin about**
---
Absolutely know what i'm talking about, so your entire comment thread makes no sense.
---

I have a channel made just for music but I never use it. But listening to this. I'll open it up. The channel is called Ramen Remix (My nickname is Roman Noodles)
---
But clearly they're not.
---
Not as of yet! I hope to do some more another time. 
---
Right now what might come first though is my (and friends) renditions of the survivors-turned-killer. We've got some really cool ideas!
---
What if you like getting moried and stay?
---
Very interesting you get that feeling from this, but that's great! Thanks!
---
I dont get it. I really dont mind Doc. He can be a bitch in The Game though.
---
Party city!
---
It depends. Usually anywhere between 14:00 UTC and 18:00 UTC. 
---
[Current UTC here](https://time.is/UTC)
---
These are some pretty thought out updates. I like them! I really like the idea for the add-ons and how they provide different game play styles. Well done!
---
Without speed addons, it doubles his speed, which is 230%.
---
Oh well my bad I watched an edited version I guess
---
Glad to hear it! 
---
Once you do open it up and upload it, you should definitely post a link as a comment on the thread.
---
I have less than 100 hours as a killer, started maining clown, but right now my favourite killer to play is Freddy. I don't use ruin in any killer because I don't want to rank up too quickly and I prioritise BP.
---
Freddy applies a lot of pressure without the need of ruin. I also prefer snares over pallets.
---
So this doesn't apply to people who play both sides or for when killer mains play survivor?
---
Thats a thing?
---
All the children that get girlfriends are super open about it right from the start, so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs a great point.
---
But Nancy was probably with a different guy every other week so I guess it makes sense why she wouldn‚Äôt tell.
---
Spirit because I‚Äôm always the power role and I always stand a chance. 
---
Huntress because she‚Äôs so satisfying and counters a lot of loops
---
Really don't think 3 letters made the difference for those people who were successful, but that's not my point: it's not that people shouldn't use the name suffix, it's that it's overused by hypercasual streamers who aren't serious and just want clout. It's one thing to be getting started, it's another to have a twitch account and a recording program.
---
Haha I like the wraith in the back
---
I'm saving this for later
---
Mad grit is working as intended. Devs have confirmed this.

Wow! I haven‚Äôt seen this one before. /s

A trapper DCed on us a couple of nights ago, He had NOEd 6 traps surrounding the hooked person.
---
I saved him from hook, he hit the one that was hooked, borrowed time saved him, ran after him into his own trap and DCed.
---
it was HILARIOUS, besides the fact I depipped because of it.
---
For me, ghosface is the most fun killer to go against.
---
I particularly hate going against Hillbillies.
---
I actually enjoy playing against her since she's the only killer that scares me when she pops up. I get the urge to DC against Legion and Ghost face because a lot of the ones ive encountered are sluggers and campers respectively
---
That‚Äôs a fair opinion on ghostface. I can see how that can be annoying.
---
Punishments for DC-ing should be a lot more harsh.  Loosing blood points or temporary ban or a separate queue for people that like to dc
---
He did quit, from what I can tell he only plays deathgarden or whatever the new game is
---
Least enjoyable- Nurse, Clown, Ghostface, Hillbilly, Huntress, Leatherface, Plague, Legion, Freddy, Spirit, Trapper, Wraith, Hag, Doctor, Pig and Myers
---
Most enjoyable- Nea Karlsson
---
I guess my problem is that it's somewhat overused, particularly by overly casual streamers that aren't serious. It's obvs not intrinsically a bad thing, I just find more often than not a TTV is someone not even streaming, and if they are, they have 0-2 views and don't do it regularly. I think there are people that think having TTV in their name will just make them a streamer, when it doesn't.
---
Pig because I love her character in-game and her Reverse Bear Traps really help so down the game.
---
Well then maybe I was wrong and I'm one of the only ones who doesn't tell people how to play

Leukemia doesn‚Äôt have the traditional cancer rating system (I think it‚Äôs called TNM) that you‚Äôre referring to. And even if it did, cancer diagnosis and classifications have gone far beyond a simple/singular number. Modern medicine has gotten much more specific in the diagnosis and assessment of cancer. 
---
With that being said, I have AML. And furthermore, I choose not to further discuss my personal life and/or personal medical issues and conditions in a mass public/unknown persons format such as this, so further questions posted here won‚Äôt be answered. I shouldn‚Äôt have to say why that is, but being this is Reddit and (I am NOT IMPLYING YOU), it seems people online seem to think they‚Äôre entitled or have a right to personal and/or private information, I‚Äôll simply say because it‚Äôs my life and I choose discretion, dignity and privacy. You can read plenty more about Acute Myeloid Leukemia in-line though, mind isn‚Äôt any different than the range of typical cases with that classification. 
---
With all this being said, further questions can be sent via instant message, however still keep in mind that in no way is this an open ‚ÄúAMA‚Äù, and it is still at my own discretion, not others‚Äô discretion. 
---
And to all the snowflakes that may get offended over my choice (still a free world we live in, right?) to keep things such as stated above to myself: you‚Äôre neither friend nor family nor doctor nor medical professional and I don‚Äôt owe you an explanation and/or details beyond what is contained in this post. Also this will likely seem (to you) that I‚Äôm an ‚Äúasshole‚Äù or I ‚Äúneed to chill‚Äù. The opposite is actually true because it should be that people are alloyed their own personal space, respect and privacy but these times‚Äô it would seem the general mass internet opinion is ‚Äúbecause you‚Äôre online, you can, and/or should, tell me anything and everything‚Äù. No, it doesn‚Äôt work like that. Sorry if that‚Äôs harsh but it‚Äôs truth and it‚Äôs not up to me to choose whether you accept and abide in that truth or not, but I absolutely will state said truth as well as the prior ones‚Äô in this post. 
---
I hate feeling the need to explain basic human privacy rights and dignity but I‚Äôm simply trying my best to cover all the bases. I hope this post helped (really, why not go to reputable online medical websites and learn a bit about cancer today?), and I hope that anyone reading this would have decency amongst themselves and humankind. Again, I‚Äôm not implying any of this at YOU, I have no way of knowing if it applies or not (I‚Äôm inclined to think it doesn‚Äôt), however, in my experiences online, that sort of stuff happens more often than not. 
---
I hope anyone and everyone reading this has a great day, and Thank you!
---
Am not much of a weeb but that last one is pretty cute
---
Any idea why my post was no longer shown in new? I wonder if the mods hid it for some reason.
---
No if you leave during the loading screen ;)
---
Hex: No one escapes exit gate.
---
At the start of the trial, a random fire barrel is chosen for No one escapes exit gate. This perk is active as long as the fire barrel remains uncleansed.
---
While HNOEEG is active, a random survivor is unable to leave the trial via the exit gates. This perk does not take up a perk slot.
---
Hope I cleared things up a bit.
---
It went from 5 gens remaining to 6 gens remaining. He kicked it so hard that the dev's headquarters shook and self-coded itself an extra generator in the basement.
---
ew immersed claudettes no they complain about literally anything, this is related to a genuine topic of issue.
---
just because you don't agree doesn't mean you need to insult.
---
I don't insult streamers, use mories, or hate streamers, I'm simply making a point that TTV is overused because there are many people that use it that aren't serious about streaming. Obviously it's silly for TTV in your name to solely be a bad thing, but I suppose my problem is that many people that use it aren't actually trying to be streamers, they just like to stream every once in a blue moon, and so having TTV in name kinda defeats the purpose.
---
Alright where is natsuki
---
Its absolute trash since the nerf. Needs a rework.
---
Sorry not an explanation but u/chiefixis explained better than I could have
---
Yes, people just also need to do more than that. I see plenty of people that *just* do that and they're unremarkable for that lack of effort.
---
Alright where is Natsuki
---
Doctor for me, because of many reasons. I like finding survivors with ease, I like ending loops before they even begin with the high stimulus electrode, and my favorite thing is seeing a not so new survivor waiting at a pallet, thinking your going to lunge, and they forget what I can do. All I can do is laugh when that happens.
---
Love that.
---
&gt; I'm one of the only ones who doesn't tell people how to play
---
what? who here is telling anyone how to play? i dont even know what you're on about
---
Ah ***fuck***, she stepped on the bone meal. Oh shidd oh heck oh crap she's coming
---
Legion needs a full rework without deep wounds or the free hit. They‚Äôve tried to incorporate it and it never works.
---
I‚Äôd rather them rework him into something which makes use of the gang theme. Somehow switching between them on the fly.
---
Rofl who prestiges without saving points first
---
Agreed 100%, man! I have a motto for DBD: I NEVER (intentionally) disconnect. I play it to have fun and enjoy it, not much else to it than that for me.
---
so because some dumbass survivors are being dumbasses that justifies you doing the same? k
---
i also never said keys are fine, something funny I've noticed is instead of defending spirit with legitimate points (seemingly because there are none) people here just try to divert the attention to other issues saying stuff like "well X is broken and X killer is so weak.." that has nothing to do with this. I have not commented on ANY mechanic other than Spirit here, so stop trying to justify it because there are "other broken things" in the game.
---
i agree keys are bullshit.
---
and as if you have the audacity to say "survivor opinion is what got freddy nerfed day one". the game, the community and the devs were very different back then. The devs were still learning how to balance (they still are but they're definitely better at it now) and most of the complaints came from low ranks. The mistake was the low ranks being more vocal than the high ranks.
---
Not all survivors think like a hive mind, a very crazy concept to get your head around but they don't.
---
so basically all I've gotten from your message is excuse after excuse, divertion of attention trying to justify one issue because there's other issues.
---
biased.
---
Most survivors despise the killer knowing where they are, even if it's an easily loopable killer
---
my only issue with Doc is that newish SFX where it blows your ears out when you go up a tier
---
Still a ridiculous amount of time
---
Depending on rank, I'd say Discordance or Infectious Fright. Both of them play very well with the nature of her power, since it makes it easier for you to hit multiple people at once.
---
Discordance tends to pay off as you get closer to endgame, since there's more chance of survivors doubling up (especially in a 3-gen situation where they *need* to rush that last gen). Infectious Fright is brutal *if* survivors cleanse.
---
Barbecue &amp; Chili isn't an ideal choice on her, so if you don't need the Bloodpoints then switch it out for either of the above perks - remember, she *really* wants to know when survivors are in groups.
---
That's the point. It's effective against lower rank survivors. High rank survivors would have no problem dealing with ruin.
---
So both you, and op are wrong.
---
you don't see a problem until you vs her 50 times and get sick of it. i used to main her too
---
Everyone who plays Nea is copying me I was the first ever person to main Nea everyone else is just a clone of me!
---
Wish they'd find someone less toxic to draw inspiration from, but whatever.
---
A Ghost face that camps? Ive never seen that lol. If anything wouldn't that be bad for him since he can just get exposed?
---
No shit I think billy is unfun, that was the point of my post. And its not just ‚Äúpotatoes‚Äù its average survivors or weak survivors. The point is you NEED good runners against Billy, while the Billy players themselves arent really anything special. Thats why Billy dominates at low ranks, because anyone can pick him up and dominate. However nurse and spirit are both garbage at low ranks which shows there must be more skill involved in playing spirit than billy.
---
Billy is too strong for how easy he is to use, thats what im saying. Playing after rank reset is a nightmare.
---
He either needs to be harder to use and keep his strength, or he needs to be nerfed and the devs should create a new very strong but hard to play killer like Nurse.
---
Adrenaline has no counterplay. If all 4 bring it you cant do anything to stop all 4 getting it unless they‚Äôre dead.
---
You say dont slug with one gen left, but any good player would slug in that case because it means they desperately need to put pressure on the survivors. Sure you could chase one and hook but then you‚Äôre letting the others go, and the one hooked if they arent dead on hook then they get unhooked with full health and an easy escape. Again its best to just tunnel to make sure one is dead at that point with adrenaline.
---
I think it was after that, but before it was hard. It was like when Legion just came out and all you had to do was stab a lot of people and let them go, and stab them some more. You'd get tons of brutality points and a high hunting score. Once they introduced the new scoring system I got less interested in the game as a whole, because it feels like everyone takes every match a lot more seriously.
---
Interesting how you chose to have a black survivor and the word "enslaved" in the same picture.
---
So I was wondering about wiggle progression and when you are dropped by the killer. I was dropped by a nurse and left on the ground for like 30 seconds (I sabo'd like every hook on the map) and by the time she got back my wiggle progression was already like half way. How does being dropped work as a survivor in terms of wiggle progression?
---
What an asshole
---
That‚Äôs pretty fuckin stupid üòí
---
Huntress is my main atm. She was the first killer I liked and the very 1st game I played I got the grand sacrifice on XB1. I average three sacrifices a game with her too.

---
There are some survivors that don't like being given the hatch.  They prefer or feel like they need to earn it.
---
Spirit! I love the fluidity of getting to disappear and reappear at random. I try hard to be totally unpredictable, and my favorite thing is randomly switching targets to haunt so it feels as much as possible like I am anywhere and everywhere at once
---
And bt can't proc!
---
that left behind buff lol
---
HATCH TIEM
---
Nah rust is a lot more toxic the game itself is toxic not only the players
---
Freddy ha that table clock now too. I don't think people knowing it's a Huntress early on is that big of a deal, especially since SWF is a thing.
---
Corrupt Intervention is arguably the only true "rival" to Ruin, although you need to be quite aggressive in order to get the same "time payout". Corrupt Intervention doesn't stop people rushing the other gens, while Ruin stalls *all* progression, not to mention the added effect of making survivors hunt for the totem.
---
Thanatophobia requires injuries, which you don't get at game start, and the penalty isn't significant - it doesn't regress gens like Ruin, it merely slows their progress. Pop Goes the Weasel is a strong regression perk, but is tied to hooks (which you also don't get at game start) and only affects one gen at a time.
---
Every second Ruin is active, you're getting a benefit. Corrupt Intervention is 2 minutes of forcing survivors into a smaller game space. Thanatophobia and Pop Goes the Weasel just don't compare. The Demogorgon perk Surge *might* be competitive against Corrupt Intervention and/or Pop Goes the Weasel, but it really depends on the map and generator spacing.
---
&gt; Does Adrenaline cleanse you when playing The Plague? 
---
Damn it, this sort of annoys me. Why does EVERYONE think small DBD YouTubers are copying Noob? Can we not just be proud people make others laugh or have fun with making videos. Sorry. This is a pet peeve of mine.
---
***THE LITTLE MERMAID?***
---
dying light rework pog
---
Left behind is actually decent now
---
No i think they do, because they've had to had it happen to them, but i think they just don't care
---
FAT YELLOW ONE
---
Tunneling Light change nicee
---
&gt; Left Behind: When you are the last Survivor alive in the trial, the hatch aura is revealed to you within a 24/28/32 meter range.
---
Wow this could actually be somewhat decent now.
---
&gt; Dark Sense: Now triggers from any generator completion instead of only generators completed by the perk owner.
---
Might use this now but I think Alert is more consistent.
---
Oh look another survivor trying to pretend only killers are on this sub.
---
No more tunneling from Dying Light, if I read it right.
---
If the situation is bad enough, I will report them to Xbox because they crack down on those assholes.
---
Does blood warden activate one time or can it activate again if you hook another one
---
Plenty of killers already do that. And there it only reveals aura when you are the last person left. Plus it‚Äôs range is 32 meters so there is still a chance killer can find it first. Plus you are bringing a perk that you might not even get to use. It‚Äôs fine.

No explain it, what was the joke?

Just and FYI you don‚Äôt need DeerStalker on Doctor. Downed survivors still gain madness

Bills with their BT thinking it makes the unhooked person invincible, and Davids wanting those juicy stacks.

I see this as an absolute win!
---
How about we all snipe him with some gracious bullshit so he and his fans don't come to the community. I have always bewn on the side of content creators, but i think keem is the one person i don't wanna see in this game
---
All the killers here are arranged in the order that they were released in.  I'd assume that this was made sometime after the huntress was released in 2017, but before Leatherface was released in the same year.
---
Did they fix the bamboozle bug where it doesn‚Äôt block the window until like 5 seconds later?
---
it's gotta be a safe hook rescue tho, so hes gonna a hit....probably
---
You can literally hear every killer's footsteps. Some maps or killers make it even easier. 
---
Huntress has her stomping sounds due to her boots.
---
Wraith and Spirit are both barefoot, so their feet have a slapping sound when they move. 
---
All killers make squishing sounds on the Swamp. All killer footsteps echo on Lery's or Gideon's.
---
These are the maps/killers that make it super obvious that they're moving. The rest just have feet that make the same generic sound that survivor footsteps make while running.
---
Literally the only killer without footstep sounds is Nurse. But her asthmatic breathing gives her away even if she doesn't blink.
---
Michael, Ghostface, and Pig all have disturbingly loud breathing, even in their stealth.
---
Every killer has a fairly obvious audio cue for the people who care to listen. Just because you're in denial about it, doesn't mean it isn't true. Open your ears and listen more instead of running your mouth so much and you'll hear more. That holds true to real life and DBD.
---
The fact they stopped running really pissed me off
---
"I gotta tell ya, this is pretty terrific."
---
When you ragequit you should incur a debt to the Entity - you can't add points to any bloodweb without paying it off. 
---
Like maybe the first DC its trivial - to account for actual DCs and not ragequits. But it steady climbs and after like 4 or 5 becomes significant enough that ragequitting costs you a few games worth of bloodpoints.
---
My killer br√∂thers.
---
Whenever this piece of shit joins your lobby, tunnel/camp/mori him every time, and let the other survivors live.
---
My survivor br√∂thers.
---
Follow / point him out to killers.
---
Meth vs hair spray
---
Man, Dying Light got stomped into dust.
---
I get it needed a rework, but if they're going to go this route with it, it needs to function while the Obsession is Dead. Makes the perk play better with STBFL as well.
---
BHVR needs to stop forcing these perks to rely on survivors staying alive to function. The downside should be the survivor heals/rescues faster. Not that the survivor gets to know the killer is punished if they die.
---
yeah, i can for sure do that. just have to figure out how to get video from PS4 to reddit is all

"Guy with ttv in his name: tries to get attention by having ttv in his name"

don‚Äôt compare Steve to that ugly wart :(
---
You might not remember old legion with both his deep wound timer addons. People sure got banned for playing the game as is.
---
But yeah, in general  behaviour announces what leads to a ban very clearly (and hasn't the mad grit bug been fixed anyway?)
---
literally the only thing it does is showing the aura to the last survivor. good ? yes. OP? lmao
---
Definitely. Laurie is another character I get ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a bad bitch you can‚Äôt kill me‚Äù vibes from when I play her lmao
---
Allow me to elaborate. You would gain points for a killer following you. This is how that will play out especially against lower rank killers: one person or two people in a SWF start taunting the killer into a chase and inform their group to start on gens. If you get BP for being chased, then that only promotes trying to get the killer's attention. The opposite of the object of the game. If SWF communication cheese wasn't a thing, I'd think the idea could work in some instance.
---
garden gnome is gonna be the killer killer

I dunno I think 3 percent debuff per hook is pretty neat

Sue them for what exactly? Banning you from their game? It's their game, who has access to the online services is entirely at BHVR's discretion.

I think the survivor buff is supposed to "disincentivize" the obsession from just suiciding to deny the perk? It's kinda weird.

Dark Sense now makes a nice combo with Poised.

I had to get adept Bill before Left Behind got massively changed, I feel cheated at the effort I had to use
---
The UI sucks
---
The thing that I hate is that when a killer dcs and I have an object from a chest and it says I got it, it never appears
---
Same here. I‚Äôm almost exclusively a survivor player. When I do play killer for bps I feel insanely bad for tunneling or killing survivors early and will stop chase to go for another survivor if i‚Äôve been tunneling one. I literally could not even imagine face camping a hook. I don‚Äôt understand how they feel no remorse about doing this stuff in the name of ‚Äòcompetitiveness‚Äô. This sub acts like survivor is easy so being toxic one way back is justified but being toxic (or just even looping and flashlighting on pallets) as survivor is bannable or something.
---
whoa now partner
---
Lol, are people really still thinking Iron Maiden won't be a shit perk anymore?
---
You clearly don‚Äôt understand the reference
---
Darn, life's hard for a David player.
---
Killers shouldn't be handed 4ks, but shouldn't lose them through no fault of their own.
---
BHVR also shouldn't be encouraging anti-fun tactics like slugging.
---
Thing about the hatch, right now, is that it is a balanced race for it. This perk gives the Survivor an unfair advantage.
---
No way!

Monto started streaming recently on Twitch, if you have any interest in checking that out. Can't quite remember the username (theonlymonto or something like that), but he links it on his videos.

---
That seems a little OP, im thinking about T3 with 5 tokens. The entity progression would be 35% faster. Holy damn
---
So Dying Light
---
27% total penalty to those actions for killing all 3 survivors besides the obsession.
---
18% penalty when 2 survivors are sacrificed
---
9% penalty when one is sacrificed.
---
Look, it's great that we don't need to tunnel the Obsession now but the perk is kinda useless at the same time now. Why not buff it to 5%? Killing two survivors already gives them a 30% penalty but I guess that's way too much. Maybe 4% is a better middle ground? I mean the original was 25% so I really wouldn't mind 24% just for killing two survivors (which is still more work for just tunneling the obsession)
---
I didn‚Äôt think it would happen with him being licensed. This is awesome.
---
Thoughts? To me, it only seems good if the obsession is good at chasing. I wonder if this addon forces an obsession into the game.
---
No the dlc isnt supposed to come out today nor is the ptb for it supposed to come out. 
---
Today is the ptb for the dedicated servers. If everything goes well, then tomorrow will be the ptb for the dlc
---
It amazes me how people fail to understand this. Two wrongs don't make a right and we'll never get a balanced game if people want to keep **their** broken mechanics but get rid of others.
---
It's a "nerf" because the impact it has on the game is worse. But the perk is overall "better" due to a healthier design.
---
Some people still think its a bug, hell i did till i read the perk and saw it was changed
---
More Mod suppression of actual issues because if they suck off the devs hard enough, they might get a mention one day.

Say they have only repaired 1-2 gens, the hatch won't spawn until the 3rd Survivor is dead. This means it is extremely unlikely you'll find the hatch before the Survivor does.

You say ash and david mains but what if I have mettle of man and WGLF on Nea?
---
But the perk is completely useless unless you're the last one alive. It's a risk, and frankly more selfish than self care. If survivors use this perk than that's fine, because that's one less perk the team has the entirety of the match
---
This and the chainsaw one haunt my dreams

&gt;What is that shadow in the back????

New UI to invite friends. You click on a shadow and you can invite a friend.

True and that could be too much. But the killer would have to try to get five hooks without killing anyone, which gives the survivors a much higher ability to do gens
---
The reference and the point are two very different things.
---
I love that Doctor skin.
---
i thought it was 40+
---
Dude i wouldn't reply, i get the supreme feeling that theres more than a few screws loose.
---
Yeah I get that, but people make it sound useless now. I think it opens up to a lot more possible combinations for killers now than it did before. It seems like the perk is more useful now to me and encourages less tunnelling the obsession and more broadening the attacks at everyone instead of just one. It‚Äôll make for some interesting perk combos.
---
you should do one for the survivors
---
Why do they always make Nea look like that?
---
But that would motivate survivors to leave eachother on the hook
---
*caffeine and regret*
---
She's boring and problematic. She's rampant in higher ranks now and is making playing survivor grating. So much so getting a nurse match is refreshing.
---
Its a meme. Stop nitpicking it lmao. I said Ash and David Mains cause it's THEIR perks and would most likely run THEIR perks
---
Bruh u ask people to make u a bad build and u dont even have the perks, god tier plays
---
Kind of your fault for not reading the post where they announced the PTB.
---
There‚Äôs a difference in saying you‚Äôre disappointed and saying that they suck and shouldn‚Äôt play the game.
---
I believe 40+ has 3 perks on the web and 50+ has 4
---
Oh shoot, wrong guy. My bad homie.
---
Oh wow, 30 minutes. You gonna be okay?
---
Said it in the other thread, Dying Light needs to function regardless of whether the Obsession is alive or dead. Sure, let tokens only accumulate while the obsession is alive but drop the nonsense that deactivates the perk when the obsession dies (rage quits)
---
You already know Monto is going to do a "don't kill them" build with Michael's three perks, all of which encourage keeping the obsession alive/letting them get away.
---
The PTB for stranger things is tomorrow. So we can all have chance to check out dedicated servers and friends list :D
---
*Poisoned Cinnamon Roll*
---
New Dying Light counter. Obsession heals 33% faster, use this add-on to find them so they can heal you speedily. Or just know where the killer's chasing them.
---
&gt;i thought it was 40+
---
It is but I went straight to a level 50 characters to see how the 4 perks would work.
---
Gross
---
extremely unlikely? eh. i think that's an overreaction. also they are wasting a perk slot for this one situational aspect of the game. it's fine
---
IMO 4k's should be hard. If three are dead the last survivor should have the advantage to escape.
---
This means if the killer does 4k then it really shows they earned it, rather than just snowballing into it
---
I've found success using it on Billy and nurse, stops all of the locker juking shenanigans.

I think everyone is just asking "why?"

Xbox. Happy whenever PTB comes out because I wouldn't want to play it myself. I like watching others play it so I know what I'm getting into. Plus, kinks will be worked out before we get it.
---
can she be anything but a killer?
---
You think it reveals the Obsession to the killer?
---
I assumed it just revealed them to the person using the map.
---
Cool!
---
They come out today on the ptb
---
Well i dident say they should stop playing but i will still say that they suck cause as i said a good player would have atleast tried to save me

Do you own a lot of teachables? Or are are you purposefully not buying perks in hopes of getting BBQ? Both of these would explain your issue, otherwise you‚Äôre just mad unlucky

I wouldn't call in a dying light nerf. It's definitely a nerf to the dying light + mori combo (which is really cheap and annoying to go against anyway) but the new dying light might be useful in some other builds like with thanatophobia when they're all injured and freddy addons that slow survivor repair speeds, we will have to see how it actually plays out, but I do know it'll get more use in builds than old dying light did which was really only used with tombstone or mori.
---
Just a little detail, in judo you can't literally kick the opponent :D
---
Left Behind is going to be my new favorite perk to use around rank reset. As a solo survivor, the potato teammates in the lower ranks can be more of a hindrance than helpful.
---
You cannot believe the developers didn't add an infinite loop you can use using balanced landing?
---
I can believe it myself.
---
Not if the kill animation has begun.
---
Are they the same actor? Sorry never seen both movie/show.
---
How do you like the UI for it? Someone else said it wasn't very good. Looks neat, though
---
Just unlucky. This is why the community has been asking for blood web changes for a while now. Now that we'll be able to get 2 perks per bloodweb, it might make it easier tho.
---
I own a lot of teachables. Aside from the killers I listed as leveling after unlocking bbq, I have 35 Wraith/40 Huntress/41 Hag.
---
I'm making sure to always buy a perk in each web
---
I guess that would be the survivors decision, having more survivors to distract the killer or do gens, or instead having someone die early. I think that going for the save would still pay off more than being down a survivor early.
---
Eat
---
Who the hell is ghost?!
---
Uhhhh a lot of people?
---
I got my first rage message last night after playing for less than a week. Apparently I was "proxi camping far too much" as Ghostface.
---
Yeah you‚Äôve just got a large perk pool to draw from then, keep leveling, BBQ will be there eventually
---
Valak aka The Nun
---
Yo my favorite Mario character: Ghost!!!
---
Nope, I said if it IS your kink, then good for you.
---
There's no way it reveals the survivor to the killer. why do you think that?
---
Got it? Cuz tapp is a pedo
---
"haha i punched this person in the face and they got mad. lol triggered" 
---
if you antagonize someone and they respond appropriately I don't see the humor and saying "hurt feelings". I explained pretty calmly and concisely why I thought camping with the wraith made some sense in my first game. I'm not embarrassed by that. You however clearly have some weird dick measuring bully complex. life's gonna be real fun for you. good luck

Wow, I made a list of survivor perk changes a last week and they somewhat implemented the change I had for Left Behind. I know they didn't see my list but it's nice top know I wasn't too far off.
---
Tbh i have a friend who's quite bad at the game and reached rank 8. All you need to do is play in SWF, and play a lot, and high ranks are ez to reach as survivor as long as u know how to profit from emblem system. Escaping isn't even necessary most of the time.
---
Noice.
---
Yeah, those current numbers are absolutely worthless.
---
Unlucky. It really all boils down to luck if you have all teachables/most teachables. Had to level my legion more than 120 levels for bbq tier 1
---
But you can close the hatch as the survivor is jumping in. So if you were close enough to hatch grab then it's pretty much the same thing.
---
I have no clue honestly. I dont even try to rank and get to rank 1 every season since I started over a year ago. I hear people complain they cant get past X rank a lot though. I guess it's all based on how iindividuals play and the time they put in. Do you play a lot?
---
The servers should make it more fun to play against huntress if anything. I‚Äôm tired of seeing the hatchet whizz by on my screen and then get downed a full second later
---
I wasn‚Äôt referring to Mad Grit. I was clarifying that the only time perks are an issue is if they‚Äôre clearly bugged, for example the previous issue with Wake Up.
---
im aware, not that upset by it tbh. I was in a kyf group that decided to install it the moment one of us got the notification it came out before any of us even bothered reading the entire thing. We were all so hyped up to play on the new map with the new characters
---
Someone beat you to it
---
youre doing fine :)
---
No "angrily squeaks" for Amanda?
---
Hey did you guys know Feng is a GAMER??
---
Yeah, I get they were going for playing with and leaving the obsession until last but I see to many DC or suicide on first hook to make the perk too viable. I can also see late game if it gets built up other survivors leaving the obsession to die on hook to get the debuff to clear. 
---
Also anyone know what happens with DS? Say I got 4 tokens built up and my obsession dies but then I get DS does my tokens resume at 4 or do I start again at 0?

It‚Äôs like a fortnite lobby now

That sucks thought because if I have a dc and someone commits suicide within the first 30 seconds, I dont really want to be stuck playing that match but if I dc I get a harsh punishment because of the coices of others.

There isn't anything to discuss that hasn't been "discussed" to death.

To clarify, the Ash skin is actually from the end of the show, where Ash ends up in the future. The hand is still a prosthetic, it's just near indistinguishable from a real hand.
---
the best timing
---
The Clown Mori is going to be a fun one....
---
I have no frame of reference for that comparison
---
1. 4ks shouldn't require scummy tactics.
---
2. Why should Survivors have the advantage? Shouldn't escaping be hard?
---
A better idea would be:
---
"If you are the last Survivor left alive, when the Killer closes the hatch, the doors start at [whatever percentage makes the first light glow]".
---
So the Killer can't immediately see what door you're at.
---
According to the [Game Rules modpost on the official forums](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/19450/game-rules-and-report-system), bodyblocking in and of itself is not a bannable offense, and should not be reported.
---
&gt; THE FOLLOWING ARE NOT CONSIDERED BANNABLE OFFENSES - PLEASE DO NOT REPORT
---
&gt; * Camping  
---
&gt; * Slugging  
---
&gt; * Tunneling  
---
&gt; * Streamsniping  
---
&gt; * Teabagging  
---
&gt; * Bodyblocking  
---
&gt; * Looping  
---
&gt; * Tapping generators with ruin    
---
Bodyblocking is bannable when used to hold the game hostage.  So in this instance, given that the EGC put a fixed timer on the match, it's not a bannable offense.  Don't get me wrong, it's still a major asshole move.
---
From what I understand from dev posts, the "Bodyblocking" that is listed on the in-game report screen is specifically for the case of creating a potentially infinite standoff, where the only option is to DC.  Although that really needs to be clarified better.
---
Additionally, that house really needs another exit, to prevent this behavior in the future.
---

Where's the new killers and the new survivors though ?

Is the score points the only indication the blind succeeded? Cause when I'm in a chase it's hard for me to focus on the score points.

Same here. I need those bloodpoints for healing them.

Maybe I‚Äôm blind, but is there no mention of the exit gates not letting you escape bug? Everything else looks great (I‚Äôm pumped for Left Behind) but I hope they take some time soon to dig into that issue

You can do this on any killer, I would just call ‚ÄúM1 challenge‚Äù
---
If you paid money for something they cannot terminate your account for literally no reason given. Games like KF2 literally state in their ToS that if you just DARE say racist things online you can and will be revoked access to the online services AND you are FORCED to IMMEDIATELY uninstall the software from your system which I am pretty sure will never hold up anywhere. They can restrict online access over stupid things, but they can't force you to uninstall something you paid money for and hold a license. Same reason Valve and other companies don't remove someone's license from their account after getting banned, it's illegal.
---
He just had a suggestion for a rule I advise you do the same and shut up.
---
shit nobody wanted. more garbage in the bloodweb
---
seriously, wtf. there is already add ons to track survivor auras
---
I wish we were actually allowed to do this during Judo haha
---
You're just mad you can't tunnel the obsession with a mori anymore and get a free 25% penalty speed.
---
I don‚Äôt really see the point of this. I guess it will make syringes less common which is nice.
---
Except that's not true. You can request a refund and fight for it if they're unwilling to give you one and/or are unwilling to tell you why you've been banned.
---
Honestly, I have no idea. I just don't think that BHVR would made an iri add-on unless they had something better in mind for it than that
---
Quit advertising that Twitter that just takes from this subreddit
---
I love Rin too but she reminds me of The Grudge too much. They should have Sarah Michelle Gellar as a survivor
---
Those games are much less buggy than DbD *currently*.
---
But Huntress has slower speed and bigger terror radius which makes it more challenging than doing it on a trapper.
---
I tried it on Nurse before but i lost that one :P
---
Hol' up.

That's just not true my dude.

I feel like it'd be better as a purple, but I guess the idea is that it also dodges being obsession. Global one-way aftercare, but useless if obsession dies.

stop

Thats just m1 challenge...

I'm guessing this was made like two years ago
---
The people that own the Ash license has to be the only ones that are actually willing to let BHVR do their thing, absolutely amazing to see. This shows that we will without a doubt get even more cosmetics for Ash in the future. Now to hope netflix will let Steve and Nancy get more as well.
---
I can already imagine how pissed off im going to be if there are 5 perks left for me to unlock and the one i want refuses to show up. Unless there's an algorithm that prevents that, im sure that rng is going to screw me over lmao

Myers is permanently in tier 1 so he‚Äôs slow and has no terror radius, but pressing the stalk button lets him see through walls. Combine that with the Lery‚Äôs map, and you‚Äôll never see him coming, but you can be sure as hell that he sees you.
---
Nah, the offering doesn't work. The perks do, though!
---
During the last developer stream McCote mentioned that the people they were dealing with at Netflix were very accommodating so I‚Äôm hopeful
---
Yo, are survivors getting new addons? I wonder if any killers are getting new addons too
---
huh interesting I wonder if they will add more stuff in the future to decrease your obession chance
---
If you had read the dev's post you'd already know the answer to this
---
I genuinely appreciate all of the tips.  As I'm slowly getting higher ranked, I'm having games where I'm getting 4-man escaped, and then a 4K followed right after.  What am I doing wrong?  Am I just not adapting so some teams?  I sometimes play worse against the immersed playstyle, I get really impatient and frustrated when I'll go minutes without even seeing anyone, and then they'll be completing gens and crouching/walking away to avoid leaving scratch marks.  Right off the start, if I see someone, should I keep purging them until they're broken to get a free down right away?  Or try to get everyone infected asap?  Also, I think I need to be smarter with my corrupt purge uses.  If a fountain is able to be picked up to give myself corrupt purge, can survivors still use that fountain or no?  I definitely mindlessly go for the corrupt fountains sometimes that are way out of the way, and that definitely hurts me.
---
Oh god oh hell

Please stop with the fluro cyber shit already.

...But there's a point to the comment and it's hard to figure out why you would say that unless it was a complaint. So what were you trying to get across?

---
still does

Well if you do it a certain way it already does that...

No one should be harassing. Especially not a 4 man SWF all DC
---
&gt; ¬†If the Obsession is alive, all Survivors get a 2/2.5/3% penalty to repair, healing and sabotage speed for each token.
---
I dunno, I can't read that any other way. Right now it just seems like  another Thana-level perk. (I.e, turn the progress bar red but don't actually do much to slow down the game)

Probably because he‚Äôs actually pretty good now and people don‚Äôt want to learn how to vs him
---
This is one of the reasons I don't rank up, there is zero benefit to ranking up so there is no reason for me to want to climb away from Rank 20-17s.
---
Besides, low rank survivors are funny, I decided to play Doctor and not actually hit anybody, and the survivors 3 genned themselves, fell for every hallucination as if I was there (dropping pallets when I wasn't really close) and kept running across the map from the gens to break out of Madness.
---
I'd like to think I helped them get better at the game, I was running Overcharge and Unnerving Presence, so skill checks must've been more difficult for them to hit than usual.
---
Congratulations. This is my favorite version of this meme.
---
If the window blocking noise reduction applies to Bamboozle then thats an indirect buff. It's very satisfying when survivors run into a window I blocked off.
---
Well that could be used for some really interesting builds.
---
But what did it cost you?
---
The theme has already been changed to the Stranger Things music &lt;3

so you actually only truly have control over the first perk? that is extremely lame

A new Evil Dead game is coming soon to PC and console starring Bruce Campbell himself as Ash, it will probably continue the story of the show!
---
I hate when I use bbq and they do before I can hook them and get that sweet bonus
---
It's more like for the setup time to get any sort of decent progress on the perk, the match is more or less over. If you were to 2 hook all non obsession players you're looking at just 18% repair penalty. That's what an extra 15ish seconds to a gen? By the time you're going onto hook 7 almost all the gens are sure to be done, if not already done. The perk is more or less useless. If you get that perk stacked up like that super early...the team is basically dead as it is thus making the perk useless yet again.
---
At the very least this synergizes with STBFL/PWYF fairly well but even then it's a tough sell. It the perk had a 4% or 5% value it would be an easier sell. 4 hooks for a full stack thana effect; now we're getting somewhere.
---
5 to be precise
---
If the entity blocking noise applies to Bamboozle then that perk got buffed slightly.
---
If Clown is coughing simulator then Doctor is laughing simulator
---
For playing the game?
---
Which killer is it for?
---
It shows you the obsession's aura (presumably from across the map)
---
It DECREASES your chance of being the obsession
---
Simple. Not anything groundbreaking but I'm happy that they are adding new add-ons for base items.
---
Well technically it is the 4th and has been since for a while now. In the pacific at least
---
It's allowed but don't say that out loud to killers. They don't like that.
---
Esports
---
Wheeere can I get this
---
Ultra rare addon for the key that lets you see the obsession's aura from any distance. 
---
It also decreases your chances of becoming the obession at the beginning of the match.
---
*[Tiers up instead of just swinging]*
---
Kinda overkill but aight
---
Ngl if someone kobe'd in this situation I'd finish hooking the other survivor before I chased the person who kobe'd.
---
Everything
---
Ah okay. I don't run Bamboozle and usually when killers run it against me they use it while in a chase so I would always notice regardless of the sound range. But if you use it preemptively that makes sense
---
I'M FAST AS FUCK BOIII
---
I don't think it'll be meta or anything but imagine thana + new DL + swing chains on Freddy. Throw in sloppy for good measure.
---
A new way to slow the game down.
---
Clown probably.
---
*groovy noises*
---
They nerfed Surge and Cruel Limits, they seems useless now.
---
Really wished they buffed the other killers only Nurse Spirit Billy and Nightmare are viable in red ranks and the only ones that can ensure constant wins the others are too weak
---
baby steves must be protected and cared for
---
You sound like a cunt, ngl
---
Bing bing your virginity‚Äôs gonged
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused the stun zone from Head On not to last for the full animation.
---
&gt;I'm not certain what this means
---
It means that the stun wasn't playing for the full animation, so basically when you jump out of the locker when head on activates and the survivor does the lil dash out of the locker it wasn't stunning during the entire thing.
---
What are they changing?
---
Yep I am trying to get my ass out of here. Cant wait for rank reset
---
The demogorgons weapon prestige has to be my favorite because both hands have the blood and Gore which make me happy. The body and head kinda look eh though
---
sorry buddy but when im in SWF we're gonna both use Pebble Time and you will never stop us
---
If servers dont fix it they probably won't be changed.
---
no, but they are the first Step for that. To be able to fix hitboxes, you first need to monomlze the desync, which is pretty much Impossible without Servers
---
I'm sorry, did I ask for an explanation?
---
You can take more perks above lvl 40
---
Yeah that's the only time I can have fun with weaker killers
---
Did they? What are the old and new values
---
So not just 2 like before?
---
I can understand face camping but tunneling is completely counter-playable and anyone who complains about it should be complaining at their lack of skill in a chase. I've gone up against plenty of tunnelers (I play both survivor and killer) and it's easy if you have good perks and know how to maneuver. Face camping can also be countered with Borrowed Time, both face camping and tunneling together is a tough pickle sure but I rarely see it and I never do it myself.
---
You mean people blaming everything on the killers latency or not having dedicated servers and them being the fix were completely wrong? Weird
---
&gt;-subtlety doesn‚Äôt seem to be your guys specialty, try not to sprint everywhere, especially when vaulting. 
---
The only time I don't sprint is when I have sprint burst.
---
Ain't got no time to slow vault windows we got gens to do and killers to loop
---
I would love that Asylum skin! Too bad they already gave the Ashy Slashy hand cosmetic to the Jacksonville skin
---
I can only wish that all the shitty "When X but Y" posts would dissapear forever. I know it will never happen but meme templates are just garbage.
---
I like it too
---
I know, but i wanted to not show the whole cuss word.
---
Are you ok? I never said he didn't . I wanted to tell you that you know nothing and he did it for a reaaon. You just care about the fact and not what happened before.
---
nah this just isn't true
---
And the next one, and the next one, and the next one
---
I mean.. the Doctor is literally a doctor.
---
Clown I guess he‚Äôs a big ruthless bastard with some ability to make chemicals
---
Above 40 3 apear can take 2 
---
Lvl 50 4 apear take 2
---
I figured thats why. I agree, personally, that he is the most respectable because of that.
---
Or just don't be a dickhead?
---
üòÇ A murderous doctor, but a doctor nonetheless üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Is this ban able?
---
Can't fix what isn't broken. 90% of complaints about allegedly "broken hitboxes" were latency related and latency is still a thing with server, just more stable.
---
Dude just played with 75 ping and it‚Äôs awful, although I‚Äôm watching streamers who are playing with 50 and it‚Äôs completely fine, so idk..
---
Shut up nerd. He's talking about the first down in the game, and also the first person ever to be downed. Hence, the double first.
---
The Legion/Detroit Become Human reference got me good
---
You think they don't get mori'd too?
---
Thats fricking awesome
---
This is stupid.
---
I don't think that man's ever been to medical school...
---
Right, yes, Bruce Campbell himself was, but there's no official word about Ash's handedness before the possession. I got mixed up a bit.
---
Begginers luck must be real because that thing is amazing and I want it
---
Good now I can get a better chance kf grabbing BBQ
---
i guess it still helps the grind but that's disappointing
---
The time it would have lost walking towards the door as the animation of opening happened so as to hold the sprint burst would have had her in lunge range anyway. She was dead no matter what.

Screaming about perks that havent actually been fully tested yet, aight.

That's cute as fuck, I need one. Do you ever plan on selling these? Cause I'd 10000% buy.

Lol, this took forever. I didn't have a pattern to follow, so there was a lot of starting over and frustration, but I'm glad i stuck to it and didn't give up.
---
This subreddit rees at D/Cs. To be fair, they kind of screw everyone over in some capacity, so you should at least be sure it's worth spiting everyone in the lobby.
---
I started using Sprint Burst and realized how agressive you can be with it, you can 99% It after a chase and using it after a long loop to get to another loop. Sprint Burst + Fixated will be so good

Well they have *1* picture so far.
---
it can be... clunky? I guess that's the best way to put it. for me it performs weird and is also difficult to get a match
---
* Same height as a crouched survivor
---
* Can crawl under dropped pallets
---
* Mori animation is the "you've been gnomed" video
---
Yea i watch her a lot she is pretty skilled and entertaining. Hot is a bonus.
---
What about Billy?
---
Well, not necessarily. Hex: Ruin is meta, so it's definitely ideal for Killers, but Hag herself has no slows, and Ghostface and Legion instead speed up their work.
---
Just right... Aaah
---
Hag would be my choice. Shes easy to play and has some awesome perks and a high skill cap. She can adjust her playstyle depending on what you're going up against and can take a lot of perks. Just watch out for corn blindness
---
And then you're stuck playing a game with 800 ping because of the peer-to-peer hosting that's used ATM and you can't DC.
---
No one will use it anyways.
---
Many people complain about Nurse and Spirit too. Like, a lot.
---
Nah, but i sure as shit kill the one that wouldn't ready up before the timer ran out
---
Yeah, I just tried to check. Absolutely not, It was a huntress and I was running through a pallet when she hit me with her melee from the other side
---
They made their bed and now they have to lie in it.
---
A lot of people said the Xenomorph wouldnt be a killer because they only allow human like killers, now that the demogorgon is out that opens up some possibilities
---
 
---
I'll try to get footage of these as best i can and update the list as/if i found more or they get fixed. If theres somewhere to actually post bugs i found that isnt here please let me know, i cant seem to find a way to post it so i apologize if this is the wrong spot.
---
1: When getting unhooked, if the person unhooking you gets hit you will be bugged, you can no longer be saved. I've only had this happen in the struggle phase and if it does happen you will continue to struggle even without pressing space bar. Doesnt happen every time but has happened to me 3 games in a row.
---
2: When getting healed by survivors after being "slugged", if the killer hits the one healing you again, you get bugged, you can no longer move, you can't be healed and the game acts as if you are still in dying state even but you do not continue to bleed out, you can only leave or die to end game, killer also can not hit you again. Only seen it in one game.
---
3: The exit gates are again making next to no noise, the only noise is the staging noises it makes but its only making 2 of the noises for me. This has happened every game so far.
---
4: Pallets also occasionally dont make noise when you place them down, only happened a couple times.
---
5: Huntress sometimes gets 1 shot hatchets for some reason? Pretty sure this bug existed once or twice in a past PTB as well.
---
On the plus side the ping feels great, im in AU and its 3am so only finding asian servers but 130 ping on the PTB feels way better than 130 ping regularly.
---
Billy for sure
---
same thing happened to me just wanted to have a fun game but some dumb ass thinks mad grit is an exploit. youre fine they just cant read
---
Looks like nurse can finally get engaged
---
Why?
---
What a random...
---
&gt; normie
---
Careful with all that edge, sir. This isn't 9gag.
---
No , doesn‚Äôt work in her phase walk, just the husk
---
Ty
---
Nooo buddy haha you got it all wrong haha. All you need to do is to not suck literal ass at the game and not rely on a single perk cause you couldn‚Äôt get a kill during the whole match. Maybe it‚Äôs time to git gud ü•µ
---
Allegedly, dedicated servers should do something.
---
I would say give a temp buff to other Survivors when one D/Cs, but then it'd become a strategy. Definitely give more BP to everyone over a D/C.
---
Susie didn‚Äôt even wanna do the things that Legion did, the Entity forced her to his realm because she was just with the wrong crowd.
---
I'm not too knowledgeable about the lore, but aren't a lot of the killers were good people who got a really bad hand in life?
---
Granted, there are a lot of them that are just straight up evil, but Wraith, Hag, Huntress, and Billy just got totally screwed over (if i recall correctly), hat doesn't excuse the fact of what they've become, but still...
---
It's different for everyone. I for one have 2k hours and I've never been lower than Rank 6 on survivor - as long as you're having fun it doesn't really matter.
---
Reminds me of social mediasochist.
---
I mean, all you literally have to do is survive to get adept survivors. It even counts when you escape hatch despite no gens being done. Killers on the other hand...
---
Y'all talking about Dying Light and Left Behind but ain't nobody talkin bout the BANDAID BUFF
---
Looks like a fucking anus
---
In For Honor, if you leave an unfinished game, you have to wait 15 min before you can play again. They really should implement something like that to punish DCers
---
Can‚Äôt wait for dat bloodweb fix hnnng.
---
I hate looking at this, I don't like it when someone gives my location away or someone else, and when I see a survivor block another survivor during a chase, I get extremely irritated.
---
And that's why I make sure I down and hook those survivors. I wouldn't want you giving away my position to the killer, I'm not letting you give away a survivor's position. You be an ass to your teammates, and you better expect a tunnel and camping if you're lucky I don't have a mori on.
---
Nah man I'm one of them and this guy's a fuckin dick
---
You get adepts on rank reset using good addons, that's pretty much it. I always did it much easier than anticipated
---
Okay! No problem :) sounds good, thank you.
---
Honestly skip on the addons until you get a feel for her base blinks. Equipping any of her addons will hurt you more because it'll screw with your timing.
---
Like how you have for the map offering
---
The milk woman with them tits
---
Yeah DS and Borrowed Time might both need a looking at. If they we're actually used like anti-tunneling perks they'd be fine, but I feel like whoever just got unhooked runs straight at me and body blocks for the other person.
---
You have to go above and beyond using only 3 specific perks. It‚Äôs not fair that killers need to double pip but survivors can just fuck around, escape the hatch when no gens were done, and adept was still won.
---
And ghostface?
---
All lunges are the same besides tier 1 and 3 Myers
---
Freddy main here (sorry Clown). Wake up whenever possible. I can't stress enough how important that is. Very few loops are safe against good snare placement. He's an M1 killer with a teleport when you're awake, but he's a whole different beast if you're asleep. I often let awake survivors go if I think I can find a sleeping survivor. 
---
The other big thing is to spread out. I can only teleport to one generator at a time. Then I have to wait for the cooldown. It makes my job a lot easier if there are 2 or 3 of you on the same gen. If you're grouped up, it's guaranteed that I'm coming for you. If you're spread out, it's 1/4 or 1/3 chance. You get the idea. 
---
At loops, try to loop the opposite side that I just faked. Chances are I put a snare down while I was faking and rotating back to the pallet.
---
Don't know, there's a lot of arguing in the comments whether it is. Bodyblocking isn't bannable. But it's also an exploit of error in design. It could also be potentially holding the game hostage if you trap someone up there without the EGC. 
---
I'll let the developers decide
---
With that perk you can hook obsession as much as you'd like tho
---
actually, that bit about asking for freddy nerfs is when he got released and survivors refused to learn how to play against him and demanded for him to be nerfed.
---
I wonder if Wraith's Mori animation being kind of lackluster can be interpreted as him trying to kill as quickly and "Cleanly" as possible. 
---
He doesn't seem to "enjoy" the kill like Clown does where he laughs and takes a keepsake of the survivor.
---
&gt; Wow this could actually be somewhat decent now.
---
Call me entitled, but a perk that does the job of a map but worse isn't that good of a change.
---
It should definitely have additional features folded into it, like providing the Endurance status, hiding your scratch marks permanently, or permanently concealing your aura when you're the last one alive.
---
Is it a better perk? Sure. Will anyone use a whole fucking perk slot to tell them the location of the hatch when they can hear it from 20 meters away? Initially, but I guarantee you no-one will after a week or two.
---
its literally the opposite. Before red ranks you can get away with winning games whitout ruins. But it becomes necessary at red ranks.
---
F. FFS.
---
Here is the thing, they dont. Developers themselfes said that every killer has the same lunge range but they also admitted that visuals and animations can make you think some of them are shorter/longer. They plan on fixing that so all of them feel the same.
---
Let him know pain.
---
Huge F
---
the entity giving me dailies be like girl if you don't play these damn low tiers.....
---
Not trying to be aggressive at all actually? So not sure what the issue is. They do conduct some amount of limited testing prior to the ptb, and they explained specifically that those perks were already proving to be particularly strong on small maps. The issue with that, is that if the demogorgon ends up being too strong, it becomes somewhat more difficult to place whether its the demogorgon, or the perks, so they toned down the perks for the time being. Peanits explained it all in depth on the forums if you wanna go look. But testing is a process, its not as black and white as you are portraying it. I'd have been more surprised if the numbers on the PTB were identical to the older build numbers we saw previously.
---
Freddy with Bbq-Bamboozle-PGTW-Ruin is really good
---
Evil within tier 4
---
Aw, my favorite killer!
---
Not gonna lie, this made me pee a little. I'm scared. ;-;
---
Wait  I think jandenise derank to play with new killers she is not nice people
---
Look it up. It should be pretty clear
---
So... Borrowed Time does not work when the unhooker is asleep, because he's Oblivious (no matter how close Freddy is to the hook).
---
[deleted]
---
New Dying Light might be okay on Freddy if you pair it with Thana and his add-ons that reduce action speed. But it's only 3%. I wonder if it's capped at 1 hook per survivor?
---
Can I have a link instead?
---
I really wish I knew how to play Doc better. He seems so fun but I'm horrid with him!
---
 ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§ Summon The PTB ‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï\_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
not_queen doesn‚Äôt know what she‚Äôs unleashed...
---
Exactly, this is purely exploiting a design flaw.
---
&gt; Not trying to be aggressive at all actually? So not sure what the issue is.
---
lol okay guy whatever you say
---
I'm fully aware they do their own testing before the PTB. It's always been garbage and never reflects actual gameplay by real players
---
Most of the killers seem to have been set on their current path by the actions others rather than their own actions, or just plain bad luck
---
F. Yes please.
---
*me sitting on 26 ebonies never using them unless I see a team of ttv/hex named squadettes* :
---
... K, cool
---
The last survivor should have advantage, in my opinion, because a 3k should mean a win and a 4k should mean utter domination. At the moment once you get a 3k you're pretty much guaranteed a 4k
---
It's a common game mechanic to offer the losing side a rebuttal. Like in darts where you need to bring your score down to zero exactly, this gives a chance for the losing side to catch up, **but** if the winning side is truly skilled it doesn't make a difference though
---
Does nurse after blink not have different lunge range?
---
I didnt understand half the lingo you used, bro. I wasn't unsure which game you were talking about for almost the entirety of this post
---
I mean, as long as they don't look in the direction of my Fredward...
---
You see the killer more, you know where the person getting chased is and you know what pallets have been used. Alert is much better than Dark Sense but at least the change will make it a better perk for new players.
---
The Hag is bae (do kids still say that?). I just love her map presence, finding ways to end loops early, and just the jumpscares she brings. Nothing is more satisfying than having someone trip a trap that you placed in front of a hooked survivor and yoinking them off &lt;3
---
Adrenaline would like a word with you.  Or maybe Insta-heals?  I dunno man, there are some really powerful perks on the survivor side, along with powerful add ons.
---
I think that's a Nurse outfit?  While Dwight is with Ambulance operator or medical intern?  Doctor is a Surgeon.
---
Larger cunt than the guy who brought a Mori in because TTV?
---
Nothing about the broken trophies on PS4 üò†
---
I like the A7X reference makes edgy Highschool me happy
---
where's hindered smh
---
My rank tends to go down when I play with my casual SWF buddies
---
Do you still have to struggle/spam space bar?
---
nurse's post blink lunge range is shorter too
---
I think it will be used in the yellow and green ranks by solo survivors. You cant really rely on your team at those ranks and Left Behind is a perk that will help you escape. 
---
It still might be better to just use Wake Up and try to beat the killer to a gate if you‚Äôre worried about escaping end game. Since Wake Up can be used if the gates are powered.
---
I love mind gaming with the teleport and he's the only other killer -aside from Nurse- that can deal with a gen on top of a hill or on the 2nd story of a building.
---
Are you posting the other 2 over there as well?
---
You can still prestige up to three times with any character and get the bloody cosmetics rewards like normal. The only difference is in the bloodweb itself, not with the prestige mechanics.
---
Okay, again, they already explained their reasons, and those two perks may be buffed after the ptb, because again, numbers werent final before, and numbers arent final now.
---
I could sit right under the hook without being unveiled. Not that I really was camping there, it's kinda dumb
---
A punishment for doing the objective lmao. Buddy, you‚Äôre noed gamer, your opinion literally doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Either hindered or madness, can't get both.
---
Most enjoyable - 
---
Least enjoyable - the rest
---
neat story. it's still not a good idea to change what they already had before allowing actual players to touch it
---
Like dinging a dong and binging a bong
---
Too op
---
Absolutely no high rank killer uses it. It‚Äôs literally a sign of a low rank killer. You can tell who uses noed because of how poorly they play.
---
Yeah those values are absolutely ridiculous. It's a game-extension perk that has the worst values in the game, and if you're hooking people left and right to the point where those values add up to something significant to slow the game down, then you don't need the perk because you're probably winning.
---
It's frustrating how little BHVR know about their own game.
---
wendigoag is the plural of wendigo
---
restart your PC
---
Probably not up yet
---
Shit answer I know but it's my best guess sorry
---
???
---
I didn't say she's bad lol. I'm just not interested in checking her out because I don't like this type of propaganda.
---
I quite like this idea! It would definitely need a tweak here and there (as much as I'd love to have dark regression, it's probably a bit too good)
---
I really like the idea, though! Maybe the monster could have a bit more use as an info gatherer, as well? Maybe like an audio queue when it finds a survivor or something?
---
Game start: Nurse omegablinks in hit range from across the map.
---
OoO: Chuckles, im in danger :)
---
not true.
---
Yeah, but the point of new Dying Light is to NOT hook the Obsession. You only gain tokens for Dying Light if you hook somebody who isn't the Obsession. Furtive Chase requires you TO hook the Obsession.
---
I feel like they could do really cool Ultra Rares for nurse that change the way she‚Äôs played. Like how Myers Purple and Iridescent add ons.
---
Good for forcing face campers out
---
I'm mostly running BBQ for the BP since I don't play Billy/Nurse much. Until this game's grind becomes far less insane I don't care how much survivors complain about it because it's quite an easily counterable perk.
---
You should strip the paint off those top cabinets and stain it a similar color to the lower ones
---
I really hope you are right. I would hate to see another perk i love to run get nerfed into the ground
---
Im glad that i dont get much use out of borrowed time so i get a non meta perk slot without feeling guilty about missing out on a good perk. Im just not much of a saver. Ill normally just choose to stay on the gen and hope someone else gets them in time
---
*hatch king noices intensify*
---
You arent supposed to 4k every game anyways.
---
easier said tan done when your team killed all the pallets  and its a tier 3 myers
---
Bruh, stop
---
Any gen on a second story is fun as well. Start the teleport and wait for them to jump into you. Make Your Choice is incredible on him.
---
I actually dislike it a lot, left behind definitely needed changes but to me this isn‚Äôt going to change high ranks at all, but it‚Äôs going to be popular at low ranks where if a game looks like its going south at all, survivors will just hide and do nothing so that they can get a hatch escape with no risk to themselves.
---
I usually keep stacks for the lategame
---
technically, yea, but the difference is unnoticable
---
Boooooooooooooooooooo üëé
---
Slowed the game down by two minutes didn't it?
---
Why not just ask them using the lobby chatbox? Or check their profiles or something.
---
i wish theyd give him the bandana/sunglasses look he had in s2
---
No.
---
Also BBQ is instantly noticeable if the hooked guy has Kindred
---
I don't care if she's bad, I don't like seeing ads on reddit
---
He would absolutely have to have a "Frankenstein" reference, it would have to happen
---
Stupid self promos
---
Aww. This makes nea actually look cute
---
Thank you :3
---
I think instead of punishing the person who dced it should reward remaining players because sometimes you actually have to quit for an emergency or something. I don‚Äôt think people would rage quit if they knew they were benefiting the other side by doing so
---
I don't think it's a bad rework either  (I do think it's a weak perk though) but on the topic of endgame you're forgetting something. The hatch itself is the advantage the survivor gets. It holds no value to the killer other than denying it to the survivor. It's a way out after not doing the objective.
---
She has a *slightly* shorter lunge
---
she used to have the shortest lunge in the game without blinking and the longest with blinking, but they changed it to the same as every other killer there and there
---
her post blink range is a tiny bit shorter tho (probably a bug). Around 5% less distance. it's very hard to notice
---
ü§£
---
Whatever you say mr. Balance expert.
---
To be fair, we did get those Saw cosmetics, and they weren't even canon.
---
Actually spirit is also really respectable
---
Thank you c:
---
The toy came to the site when stranger things premiered, and the fan art on the site indicated it as a stranger things knock-off called "Stranger Dongs". It's not official, but they're probably the only people selling a demogorgon dildo lol
---
Agreed. I main her, and I love her backstory. Family went under, got a job to try and help with the bills, and the father went insane due to being fired.
---
Yea, the double pip part is overdoing it imo. Making ebony kinda pointless.
---
Their not broken. Their shadow nerfed.
---
Player A is injured and running towards the gate
---
Player B blocks a hit and receives a protection hit
---
Player C lines up behind and then also takes a hit for player A but this time he will receive no protection hit. 
---
This is because player A can only award one protection hit until he is unhooked or picked up from the ground. 
---
There is also a limitation in trading protection hits. 
---
If player A awards player B a protection hit
---
then player B (who is now injured) cannot give player A a protection hit even if it qualified. 
---
However player C should be able to get a stack from player B. 
---
Finally taking a hit pre-hook, unhooking with BT, then taking a hit post-hook only gives you 2 stacks not 3, that is including the safe unhook.
---

---
Do you need to activate the key for this to work like the other add ons or is it on permanently?
---
C: thanks!
---
Lmao, where the fuck did that come from? Guilty conscience?
---
I love the nurse bc her power is unique and once you get really good with her , it‚Äôs really rewarding and I love that . It‚Äôs really satisfying when they think you‚Äôre a baby nurse but then you kill them all , satisfaction!!! Also her skins are so dope tooo !
---
Wtf what did she do to become a slut?
---
Good thing people are providing feedback on those changes....
---
Is there a trick to getting hatch with EndGameCollapse outside of a key? The hatch takes so long to open after the last hook, half the time the killer's already stomping it by the time it opens. This perk doesn't seem as useful as it would have been pre-EGC.
---
Woah that sucks! :(
---
yeah I guess they don't, and?

\&gt; Reworked the hair on Meg's Game Set Match head customization items 
---
am i stupid or something? i can't find this cosmetic at all
---
All killers other than tier 1 and 3 myers (and as stated in other comments, post blink nurse, but it's unnoticable) have the same lunge range and hitbox.
---
The thing is, the hitbox is always the same when weapons look different. That's why Freddy's hits look so BS. He has a short weapon and a small body, making his hitboxes seem the most "broken"
---
Maybe ST is older than I thought, memory is a fickle thing. I don‚Äôt remember seeing the stranger dongs on the page until when I opened that one today, but I suppose it‚Äôs possible that I just never opened that one. I got 3 seconds into the intro of the first episode before I stopped watching the showüòÇ
---
getting the demo skin or the doc, it depends
---
I wouldn't say you have to go above and beyond if it's rank reset and you have some nice addons, but yeah, it's easier as survivor and it's pretty pointless to have Merciless, 4k is enough.
---
That's 15 seconds after 6 individual hooks on 3 survivors that aren't the obsession. By that point either you've completely wiped the floor and have won or the last gen is likely in heavy progress. Once this new DL is stacked up, it's not going to have much effect at all. You literally gain 20 seconds on a gen from a single kick when pop is active.
---
They already revealed that a long time ago lol. The "Rift"
---
I think it could be beneficial, but it doesn't really give her any more map presence, but i do think it's a good idea!
---
True, I went braindead mode
---
Stranger Things DLC gets added tomorrow to the PTB.
---
More like Ash mains when old MoM returns
---
Before actually having a chance to test them for any length of time at all yet? They cant even be used in normal games yet, only in KYF which tend to be a bit abnormal. I just wish people would give stuff like this like, literally just a day to settle before going ballistic about how the devs dont know what they are doing.
---
Thank you friend
---
So down them and follow the person, someone will have to come to pick them up and waste persons time.
---
Maybe you blocked him/her and so did i? One never knows
---
DLC usually gets released to live 2 weeks after it hits PTB.
---
Haha! Ok ok give me a bit to make the body again. Send me a message and we can go from there.
---
Its not me tho üòÇ
---
EZ just break your own leg /s
---
Restart worked for me
---
**OINK**
---
"Activate windows"
---
Yes good ideas. It obviously would need tweaking just like every new killers.
---
im talking from a perspective of someone whos fully aware of the mechaniques of the game, as well of a medium level of gamesense. 650h is still very much the early phase of learning the game. you are still learning the game. you can't possibily know with 650h, you cant even play trapper well. 
---
if you cant build a house yet dont expect to build the eiffel tower.  
---
Don't take my word for it? that ok, here's QuixoticGreen, prob the best HillBilly in this game [having a say oh the matter.](https://clips.twitch.tv/BreakableOilyHamsterKappaWealth)
---
It is but if its a killer that is around that area and fully facing camping it's a big negative I mean sure you won't die because you have 34 seconds but someone else's position has been found.
---
Get him Demi!!!
---
Yea i think she just needs more vievers shes alot of fun to watch
---
*amanda squeak noise*
---
Oh damn, that does look good. Okay, you've sold me.
---
If you play it right it's a free escape once the gates are powered when paired with DS
---
Yeah pls dont bring mori
---
Okay, but then you are wasting your time since it's a lot more effort to down a survivor then it is to pick one up. And if they have Dead Hard it takes even longer.
---
On top of that you're going to lose the survivor who did the unhook so now you're back to looking for survivors or wasting 60 seconds to pick one up.
---
I still think it should work with killer distance.
---
I just want this community to be less toxic like her and get shit for self promoting. Just love ffom this community &lt;3
---
Lmao
---
If you get near the perk without picking it up maybe you can sort of manipulate which one to grab first depending on how close the entity is to it, maybe? Entity gets automatically summoned after 5 was it?
---
could someone give me a idea how big 32 meters is on a map?
---
Hatch works
---
September guaranteed. It was on the trailer.
---
:O that's quite the achievement, friend! Congratulations!
---
(Here's hoping i can get there someday too, lol)
---
Free copy from my friend, so I don't have a product key
---
I can't because mods remove anything I try to submit.
---
No, i don't think i will
---
Scoops heh... Scoops Ahoy
---
The only one that has a stick up their ass is you, hypocrite.
---
My wait for Classic Freddy continues
---
Is that with Scratched Mirror? Or just T1 Myers all the time?
---
Thats your loss
---
Okay, NOW the perk is good. Was way too short beforehand, now it's a solid way to help teammates save you if the killer is camping.
---
Have you ever played any other online multiplayer game? Having dedicated servers doesn't magically make hitboxes work perfectly. It's something they'll have to tune as they get more info.
---
The reason I‚Äôve been losing rank is because I let everyone farm points as trapper. I‚Äôve been doing this for weeks as prep for the update
---
Because I don‚Äôt want strict rules against people posting memes on a sub with a flair specifically for memes?
---
Leeeeeeeeeets get riiiiiiiiiiiiiight iiiiiin to the mori!
---
Awesome thanks! Im assuming the patch and dedicated servers around the same time?
---
Fix protection hits but MOM will never recover from that nerf
---
lmao you're free to be wrong and intentionally ignorant if you want, I guess.
---
 Thanks for making it easy to ignore you and disregard your dumbass opinions.
---
Not really keen on calming down on the hate of a total piece of shit
---
Actually played with him last night. Cool guy, he added me to give me props on a nice mindgame.
---
When the grabbing animation starts but survivor DC so you're stack dabbing for a minute
---
Poor me
---
I dont need help solving issues I havnt touched this game in over 5 months, the games become a literal joke with the direction the dev's want to take their game. I'll continue to point out and ridicule a dev team that have has literal fucking years to fix such a huge gameplay bug and it's not the only major bug they haven't fixed yet. It's almost as if the team is run by actual apes
---
this is the closest we‚Äôve come to getting shirtless doctor

---
Why were you downvoted ,wth
---
That dying lying change deserves a "you tried" star.
---

---
Holy shit this made me laugh so much! Made my day.
---
No, it's because you have a stick up your ass,   
---
and you need to loosen up your tight asshole and calm down lol
---
I literally played a normal game cause I chose pig by accident and my phone started going crazy. Don‚Äôt know why they were so mad lol
---
NEAt
---
What is your definition of,‚ÄúStick up one‚Äôs ass‚Äù?
---
I'm a rather new player, and this question will probably reveal my ignorance, but what do you mean by farming points? Also, how does that send you back to low rank?
---
5 seems too high though, as you can bet most people are going to run this with Thanatophobia. I‚Äôm sure that was considered when setting the values where they are. 3 seems like a good starting point as it could get obnoxious when stacked.
---
Keen? More like KEEM hahaha get it? Haha...ha.......ok I'll go now...
---
I mean it‚Äôs already trash and nobody runs it except new players, extremely niche builds and people going for the Adept. At least the new version will actually provide some slight help with the Adept, since it now synergises with Myers‚Äô other perks rather than them countering each other.
---
I haven‚Äôt had s single complete match on the PTB today. It‚Äôs been DCing from either every survivor when we do poorly, or every killer when a single gen is done without hooking someone.
---
This is getting ridiculous.
---
The Wraith's power BM potential is insane

---
Are you on console or pc ?

I‚Äôve had one guy do this to me too, and I‚Äôve only been playing for 3 weeks, some of these hoes be thug whilin

I don't understand the hate for legion. He is one of the easiest to escape from, they rarely tunnel or camp, and he's loopable. I agree with OP he's fun to face.

What does prestige do?

That is fucking cute!!
---
Nah he‚Äôd be a facecamping LF
---
Oh I bet, and I'll readily admit some of them I have played and ran an honest lobby and then some of them I'd rather mori them tbh mostly because they played in stacked groups of 3-4 man swf where they all have 4-8 thousands hours a piece.
---
Thank you ^^

Look up hwidgen on Reddit

I try my best to do the gens, save my team mates and run the killer as best I can.

Can't speak for everybody though and I do feel you on the pain of having really sub par team mates.
---

---
*bruh*
---
I'm so fucking sorry.

I honestly figured this would get posted here
---
Have you ever played a game of Dead By Daylight before?
---
You posted 4 times in this sub.
---
The first 3 posts are basically just you, memeing around. (unless there is something thought-provoking about drinking with Clown?)
---
The last one is you, crying about posts not being serious enough, when none of yours are in the first place.
---
You played yourself, and you insulting me just doesn't help your case.
---
how can you see the perks? isn‚Äôt the dlc tomorrow?
---
PC from day one  ü§ò üòà
---
***URSULA. WAS. HILARIOUS! COME HERE YOU LITTLE SHIT!***
---
David King has a perk that multiplies the amount of BP you get at the end of the game. I've gotten 100k+ using We're gonna live forever.
---
*Groovy*
---
&gt;I think if you buy 4 non perks first, you can guarantee that the entity won‚Äôt take the other perk you want. I think it takes pathing into account when it chooses which perk to take. I have heard that it works that way for items
---
I tried this. 
---
I "prepped" two perks that I wanted to grab and the entity signalized she was going to grab one of them. I bought it before the entity could and instead of taking one of the other two, it immediately grabbed my other choice.
---
[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/GRWF9Ma.jpg)
---
Cool but still bad imo.
---
Considering what you're basically asking for is to just make hitboxes small enough that  the killer's arm needs to touch the survivor with their hand, that pallets can't be contested and there's even less effort involved in looping, it's just a fat nerf to m1 killers. Not sure hammering wraith, legion, pig, etc even further into irrelevancy is a good idea.
---
OH SHIT, A HATCH
---
Thomas has never seen such bullshit in his life
---
BHVR plz fix
---
Could potentially save someone from accidentally dying due to neglect
---
&gt;Maybe dedicated servers will help?
---
If the killer lives closer to your regional server than you, it shouldn't.
---
I‚Äôm his roommate, I witnessed it. Funniest shit I‚Äôve seen in awhile.
---
Finally! Have fun! It's fun to watch until it gets released...
---
Huntress and nurse are free on PC as well, but you have to pay for doctor and hag
---
Good. Still very niche, but at least a nice fuck you to campers, and won‚Äôt bother me at all as killer.
---
Interesting, yes. But honestly kinda weak. It certainly shouldn't be Ultra-Rare considering the fact that there are already add-ons that show you all survivors' auras.
---
TTV is old news its all about MXR now.
---
Someone missed the PTB patch notes.
---
It's more of a smug look
---
You being an obvious blatant hypocrite.
---
I see, perhaps I should start helping farm as well? I'm already low rank so it wouldn't really do anything to me
---
wraith is the most kawaii!

---
His straight jacket from when he‚Äôs working with Baal in season 2
---
His red leather jacket from the beginning of season 1
---
How are the controls on mobile?
---
Just because it looks right for the killer doesn't mean it's fair. The Leatherface was charging the hit while the Bill was already falling after vaulting, that hits and it's fair? Nah
---
Susie was physically forced by Frank, after Julie handed her the knife and told her to do it.

Or, I could try to provide actual important content instead of worthless shitposts.

How to download on mobile?
---
Wonder if that debuff stacks or is multiplicative, cause someone said in a video they tested Thana and Sloppy and that debuff was multiplicative, adding little time to the heal when combined.
---
Console is more toxic, unsurprisingly. If you leave the endgame lobby without reading chat then there's nothing those Internet tough guys can do

Dummy.
---
I don't have david king, I play dbd because it's in the game pass for xbox :D
---
This guy gets it.
---
I mean only do that if the killer is not hooking you. Otherwise you‚Äôll just cost the game for your team and you won‚Äôt gain any points yourself
---
They could make both hook states last for infinity and it still wouldn‚Äôt be a great perk tbh. Survivors don‚Äôt want to leave other survivors on the hook unless they‚Äôre facing a camper.
---
‚ÄúLoves his sister(?)‚Äù SOMEBODY GET ME THE HELL OUTTA HERE PLEASE üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ I‚Äôm dying!!!!!!
---
Yeah I‚Äôm thinking of using it on plague. Thanatophobia plus a couple stacks of dying light is gonna be brutal. Especially w PGTW
---
Eight? Just eight?
---
I want to go further.
---
I want to miss each blink and then get stuck in a forty second fatigue animation
---
I think that 32 meters is a good range for this perk. That‚Äôs almost the range of bond. Pair that with open-handed and it could be a really good combo.
---
Items and currency earned in the PTB aren't carried over to Live. If you're needing to farm up a few BP or Shards for the DLC you can't do that in PTB. Plus it's a test build similar to a beta test build - there's almost always bugs and sometimes they can be pretty annoying. Most players I know play PTB for a couple hours to see what they think and then switch back over to live by the next day to continue farming.
---
It does sound like it could be fun! I doubt I'll buy the dlc, but I'll definitely farm a bit, so i can level Hag and Plague up! (Once I get them, lol)
---
People would just run it to troll
---
Not only that, all his videos have the same title's, "Once Upon a Toxic.." Its a far fetch yea but cmon..
---
If this is intentional, prepare for the influx of prayer beads
---
How do you get this game on mobile? Is it on iPhone?
---
No, holding the game hostage is bannable. Bodyblocking isn't
---
Plague and huntress, both require you to loop more carefully due to their projectiles and huntresses humming really makes her stand out from some of the other killers. Plague can create the stink locker.
---
So with Dying Light, is there no token cap? If so, then that means you could get a max of 9 tokens, although that wouldn't matter since by then the obsession isn't affected by the slowdown anyway. So 8 tokens would be the most tokens you can get that would still have an effect. But then it'd be 24% slowdown, and only affect one survivor, while there is also another survivor in the match that isn't affected at all. This is vs the current 25% slowdown that affects up to 3 survivors. I'm glad that it discourages tunneling now, but this is a pretty huge nerf. I like the spirit of what they're doing to reduce the toxic nature of the perk, but I feel like the slowdown penalty is now way too weak and becomes useful way too late into the game. I'd say maybe like 6% slowdown per token, with a cap of 5 tokens would be better. That way at max power it is stronger than the original perk, and only needing 5 tokens instead of 8 makes it become active earlier in the match where it'd still be useful.
---
its the 7th vid if im not mistaken
---
I feel the face is kinda different but I don't know if I'm just having a stroke
---
Not everyone knows how to access it (even if it's easy). It requires you to do a download every time you switch (at least for me). Since nothing is saved, not only is there less motivation since none of your progress is saved, it also encourages people to spam their best items and offerings which can be a miserable experience on either side.
---
I did the ptb for clown, and I used to do the overwatch version when they dropped a new hero. I found that I did 1 or 2 games, and decided to just wait for the real release because, again, no progress is saved. I do enjoy watching streamers do the ptb.
---
I think it's more you can just see the face now lol.
---
Plague: ***Rhhhea Rhheaa!!***
---
Lmao yea i actually have, and it was also against legion
---
i understand where you're coming from, but the forum is technically the only official avenue of communication between us and BHVR. Twitter has a 280 character limit, making it difficult to talk about something that may need more explanation than just one tweet, hence why they typically seem to only share major updates and fanart there. if you're really frustrated with a problem, IE matchmaking being fucked, i'd imagine you'd be checking the forums for an answer anyway, wouldn't you?
---
New gameode confirmed?!?
---
Is the difference that there are more perks available? Sorry haven‚Äôt played in a while and kinda forgot what it looks like normally.
---
It isn't though...
---
I use IPhone, but I think it‚Äôs available for Android
---
You are right this Has nothing to do with dbd and isn't even that good of a meme
---
Baby normie
---
Friday the 13th tried to be half of what DBD is and failed. Oh well.
---
I'd love an answer as well, so many people have been saying both good and bad things about them, it's confusing as hell...
---
Annoying, especially chucking the hatchets. But it‚Äôs still in beta so I‚Äôll let it slip
---
Says the person who made this post
---
AppStore and google play I think
---
The lighting in the PTB is slightly different and makes a lot of the characters faces look softer now. Meg face looks like it has less lines with the new lighting for example.
---
Yea mods when you accept this shit instead of my actual relevant posts, don't expect me to ever take you seriously.
---
I'll always go for the safe hook with Adam, I still have another 14 more self unhooks to go for my achievement, I try to do at least 1 deliverance per day.
---
It‚Äôs very difficult with the controls and everything but when you hit them, it‚Äôs satisfying
---
OMG LEFT BEHIND IS ACTUALLY USEFUL NOW THEY LISTENED TO US
---
This is cool :D
---
What's the new dying light?
---
Made with mematic
---
That's so cool!!
---
Says the hypocrite who offered nothing useful and only offered up immature drama and bullshit lies
---
Yes! I was waiting for this! üî•üî•
---
It's the new Wedding Ring addon for the key. Lowers your chance of becoming the obsession and also allows you to see the obsession's aura. Pretty underwhelming for an ultra rare in my opinion.
---
I think I just played you lmao
---
I am really suprised you didnt put nurse lower like probably every baby loosing to them on a regular basis
---
Fun list
---
._.
---
Ooh, gotta check the ptb now then!
---
Yea I'm the ghost boi, I literally said out loud to my roommate "watch someone posted this to Reddit"
---
The only reason I thought of this was a n00b video where he did it with the pig. I saw the last gen get popped and she was running towards the gate and it was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. GGs

Nurse gives a nice change of pace by having me play more smart instead of just running around debris until im smacked. Also forces me to learn how to break a chase or at least line of sight. :)
---
They really wanna show off that forehead huh
---
That's a very good drawing, you did a great job with it!
---
Only question with dying light is if it's capped. Get 3 hooks mid-way through the match, pair that with Thanatophobia, and pair all of that with Freddy's action speed add-ons and you have something that might really slow them down.
---
Ah, my favorite survivor.
---
Shadow dude
---
It's called "bloodhunt" and it's beautiful, I think there is one in the next week or two
---
I think it's deserved because you don't want it just to become a 3 gen perk plus cutting the distance a little won't hurt the perk too much
---
I was like "Fuckin cool. 3 perks instead of 2. Nice". Then I seen the 4th. üëå
---
Whenever you hook a survivor thats not the obsession, gain a token that reduces the speed of repairing, healing, and sabotaging. Each token gives a 3% penalty to these actions. If the obsession dies, this perk deactivates.
---
How about the perk make both state last for infinity, but on the Killer's UI, it looks like the progression is going down. Ultimate Camper counter ;) Still a wasted perk against most Killers tho.
---
Can't nerf a perk that was never released. They said things were subject to change. They still are.
---
Yeah let me tell you how you're wrong. All you have to do is look at any Red ranked killer streams,
---
I found my favorite streamer from playing a game with him and having his stream up while I played.
---
I didn't realize what was wrong until I read the add-on description
---
It wouldn't be a PTB without a crippling spirit bug. A similar big appeared a few ptbs back--a stun would deplete her power bar and she would make a sound when starting to phase or window vaulting.
---
Devs said it was an unplanned bug. If it was a nerf, it would have been in the patch notes 
---
BUT the bug will probably make it into live and take a while to fix. So spirit will be nerfed for the next 3-6 weeks if past history is anything to go by.
---
Do xbox players even complain about exclusive releases? I always used to see them complain about PS4 players getting more stuff but now that‚Äôs died out and everyone is like ‚Äúok‚Äù but now I see PS4 players complain about xbox players getting early releases.
---
Maybe Xbox players are more humble now.
---
Either way as a PC player it‚Äôs just interesting to see
---
Red add-ons just yeets survivor onto a nearby hook.

Well because she‚Äôs considered one of the only Top Tier Killers... largely in part due to how you cannot tell if she‚Äôs phasing if you‚Äôre inside her Terror Radius, which gives way for a lot of mind game potential.
---
That ash skin
---
oh yes
---
What gets me is when my teammate decides to DC and they‚Äôre on their last hook. Like... okay just lose all your points for absolutely no reason
---
Tomorrow with the dlc
---
Since they posted an official list of perks and values it was actually nerfed.
---
Its not like the perks were datamined, besides i was asking for your opinion, not a meaningless comment
---
Haven't watched streams this long yet but so far it looks like its VERY laggy/buggy.
---
Couldn't help but notice there's nothing in there about custom menu music, which they said they were going to add.

He also had 1999 MacMillan's offerings and had his Nea completely leveled out with just 0,1 years on steam.

The ghost face perk that switchs obsessions when the obsession is unhooked

**Non stop screeching for a full minute**
---
Five gens later, the nurse finally recovers from her fatigue.
---
Neat! I'll definitely have to look into it! I didn't realize that DbD had events like that...
---
Kinda feel stupid for not knowing that...
---
I hoped for it to be a meta changer , maybe a somewhat better ruin, but i guess it works fine as well, will need to test it a bit in actual games
---
these are PTB-specific patch notes, why would they mention consoles?
---
what is that perk?
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
We need that face rework.
---
That‚Äôs Johnathan tho
---
Don't forget self care and solidarity
---
Ye happened to me last game, which got me the idea
---
I genuinely hate this comment but I can't not upvote it so here you fuckin go
---
Thats the cutest damn thing ive seen all day!
---
It gave the killer a concussion rendering him useless so that me and my boy dwight made a quick get away.
---
If I play survivor '.TTV' survivors are the best. I can see when the killer is chasing them or (If they are swf) when their team mates get chased.
---
So? I care less about points and more about that killing the obsession doesn't do *anything at all* unless you have a perk for it. It just feels like a pointless mechanic that could've been called anything and had the same impact.
---
That makes me feel good! Heres an upvote.
---
This is too cute! Somebody else mentioned this, but I‚Äôd totally buy one. Especially if it was of a baby dweeght!
---
It‚Äôs Quentin
---
One of spirts best skills is the mind games she can pull off that‚Äôs why she‚Äôs such a powerful chaser with this she will only be used for quick downs but still has to loop pallets  as no survivor is gonna fall her mind games
---
I plan to make all the surviviors and killers, its on my bucketlist. Lol
---
Suhrect Ur Curr
---
oof....really not sure about the head on that Dwight outfit.
---
so it's bad for survivors to bm, but you playing a killer that the community as a whole pretty much agrees sucks the fun out of the game for all but one person, is ok? 
---
Also at worst, survivors bm is just tbagging behind a pallet, and them wasting time they could have been using to run away.  Or tbagging at exit gates, which you can solve by going in and hitting them, which gets you, the killer, more bloodpoints. 
---
If you get mad at survivors bm, then the problem isn't the bm, it's you, because all forms of survivor bm get the killer more bloodpoints or make chases easier.
---
Killers can bm way harder, but if i bring up facecamping, or tunneling, or slugging, im sure i'll just get the "you're just a baby survivor main, and ACKSHUALLY killers can't be bm, because it's a 1v4 and we are constantly in a disadvantage state."
---
Would you be able to upload the theme to YouTube? Apparently the files are unsupported
---
Don't feel stupid at all! They don't advertise them much and they aren't that often
---
An old irrelevant streamer who did some shitty things and then when a few edgy youtubers called him out, an entire fanbase (which was probably one of the biggest ones at the time) harassed him and went to his house to insult him until he made like 5 videos of himself crying and has since then apologized several times and has changed a lot.
---
Honestly people should get over it, he used to be a shitty person and it stained him, some people even released his personal information and of his entire family.
---
Note that this was in 2016, and it‚Äôs currently 2019. People still aren‚Äôt over him. Personally I think people should just leave him and his small fanbase alone already.
---
It says that it pauses it for three seconds at maximum, which gave me the misinterpretation that it added time. I only left this in here so anyone who misread it like myself will know now.
---
are you able to get 2 perks per bloodweb now?
---
Is there an issue with the download? I can upload it on Youtube if there is.
---
I don‚Äôt have a sister lmao but you seem pretty tilted
---
:,(
---
Good choice in fav moris! Im still trying to pick but I'll always have plague in my top 5.
---
Why is everyone shitting their pants at keemstar considering playing the game? Goddamn it‚Äôs been 3 years since the circlejerk started, you‚Äôd think after all those hemerroids these people would finally let go
---
This is nice, shouldnt be ultra rare in my opinion, the key should be a bit more playable anyways
---
Possibly just my device, but I can't access any of the files
---
Lol, what a lil bitch you are
---
Good save strength, your gonna need it for honeymoon
---
Headshot Hatchets are back!
---
Well when you're not reading all said requirements, I find that argument very logical. However, killing a survivor is much, much more than just hitting them.
---
I was half memeing as we had 4 gens done, but the kate killed herself on hook. The dwight and I were having fun, but trying at the same time. Not sure about the other person...
---
Right. I mean, it wouldn‚Äôt take much to get say, just 4 hooks and everyone sick. That‚Äôs 28% already combined with Thanat. If the values were raised to 5% at tier 3, now it‚Äôs 36%! And that‚Äôs just FOUR hooks. So yeah, I seriously don‚Äôt think it should be higher than 3% due to stacking potential. This will be a popular combo on Legion too I‚Äôm sure.

---
Perk changes are really low and slow. Funny enough Mettle of Man wasn‚Äôt this bad and was borderline OP.
---
Just gonna chime in here. 
---
Killer Main. 
---
I see this more often when I down the first survivor I find. They can feel that nothing has happened yet and they‚Äôre already heading for the hook and it stings. I‚Äôve been a killer main since launch and I can almost hear the 
---
I prevent this, _sometimes_ to my detriment, I‚Äôll start by hitting the first survivor I find and then abandoning the chase to down the next survivor I find. The second survivor to get hit _almost_ never quits when I down them. Typically I only waste about 15 seconds doing this and as a skilled killer I can usually make them up with mind games. 
---
I think this is working because the downed survivor feels like they‚Äôve accomplished something rather than getting hooked with 150bp on the board. Who knows, I could be wrong, but choosing not to down the first survivor I find seems to get me to the end of a lot of games. More so than before I started doing this. 
---
Mind you, if I don‚Äôt find someone immediately, I‚Äôll ignore this change of play altogether.
---
Whattt, that's so weird what is that?
---
Jake that's not what head on is
---
Have you been on r/dankmemes
---
Oh no, my fear of bad dedicated servers is coming true
---
Standing still isn‚Äôt a mindgame.
---
Probably a week after ptb ends
---
PTB goes live tommorow so for PS4 and XBOX it should be 18th of September
---
It's cool, I've been in the situation you've described. If you've thrown the pallet and the spirit is stand opposite to you vaulting is almost a guaranteed loss so don't do that, bringing DH is always a good option that helps when she is not faking her phase and is tracking you. If you're really good at looping and friends are popping gens "poised" is your beat friend and those two perks are for most killers so it's not just an anti spirit build. It does matter about predictability too, I went up against a spirit who guessed that i would run for the nearest pallet and would phase ahead of me to try to catch me off guard once i saw what she was doing I'd run past close pallets while she would come out of the phase looking like a crackhead swinging at nothing and thats just one match. You can predict and counter a spirit
---
This sounds good but like it‚Äôs so confusing. I keep hearing one beat and then I hear another, it‚Äôs either off tune or I‚Äôm paying too much attention to the instruments/sounds
---
If it works how the wording saids it works, but i dont think it does
---
"You know what?" He said as he loaded into the game. "I'm gonna be toxic and do gens!"
---
Thank You!
---
No they don't
---
I've met so many people that do this...
---
Fuck them guys
---
Please it makes the menu look really bad. I think they could maybe make outlines of 3 random online friends characters that replace the shadow people. Or they could just remove them entirely and just leave the + signs
---
I don't care what she looks like if she doesn't have the likeness of Jamie Lee Curtis then she isn't Laurie Strode
---
Thank you :)
---
Which ones?
---
Definitely shouldn't be ultra rare but makes me wonder if we are having reworks to perks that will actually benefit knowing where the obsession is/not being the obsession
---
I was playing like 5 matches and sometimes I had the ping at 250 (red) but there wasn't any lag

---
I see a little silhouetto of a man?
---
It's definitely different

He meant left behind
---
Finally. That girl looked like a scarecrow mess.
---
It's probably on the rise because it's so damn easy to do and a modern game shouldn't have this issue üòí
---
They literally said it's not a final decision. This is why the devs do not make announcements early, because people like you try to argue semantics
---
Spirit will still be top tier. This change is not going to kill her.
---
I‚Äôm talking about the public test build, not music
---
Are you clicking the download icon in the top right corner? Just to be sure.
---
It gives you 25% actonspeed boost for every person that has died.
---
Thats your word. For all I know you play this game day in day out. But if you say so, alright then. All I'm suggesting is to not be a douche and let the devs work on the game while also being respectful of what changes need to be done. Simple enough if you ask me.
---
Hag being looped??? Against a good hag?
---
You do have to go above and beyond, it's almost impossible on most killers. All it takes is one DC or one escape and you lose it. All I get paired against is 3-man or 4-man SWF groups. Rank reset isn't going to help me much.
---
If you play never getting caught right? Wutface

I‚Äôm just waiting for the gameplay videos and breakdowns. I know Monto, Tru and hopefully Ardetha will have some good stuff to put out. I‚Äôm beyond hype to see Coconut‚Äôs input too.
---
Spirit and Michael would be my S tiers. Legion, Nurse, and Doctor would be at the bottom for me.
---
This line of logic literally work for any killer.
---
Surveillance is affected by it and I guess it is not a big, most likely a feature
---
It does effect pop right now, also does not consume pop. So you can use it twice(37% on the downed player and the gens around) and the normal pop on any gen for 25%
---
üòä
---
report him that's a unused perk and that's 100% hacks
---
Love most of these changes. I was just ranting the other day about how god-awful and useless Left Behind is after EGC.
---
If I read it right, I think the new glowing bar is gonna be stupid. Survivors already get way too much free information about the Killer. Not only that, it seems like a nerf to Blindness and Knock Out, two things that were already practically useless.
---
It means that the bleed out timer has been paused. Getting picked up and being healed stop it.
---
I‚Äôm saying in a last man standing all 3 teammates are dead moment and the hatch is closed you‚Äôre essentially screwed. Having a BT effect or d strike when you‚Äôre the last one alive without the hatch available would be OP how? Gives the survivor a chance to break chase and try and actually open a gate if they have 0 other options and sounds like a lot safer than hoping for the hatch to spawn within 32 meters and not being in range of the audible hatch sounds, also the killer can‚Äôt be closer or have been watching the hatch waiting, also unless the game went 3 Dead and 2 or less gens have been completed you‚Äôd be able to just look for the hatch before your teammate dies anyways and wait by it. The amount of cards that have to line up in your favor or against your favor are too much to take away a perk slot that would actually help your team survive or finish gens.
---
Its nice seeing people reply with their own rankings, it's interesting to see how everyones opinion varies :)
---
This looks amazing! &lt;3 
---
I would buy one if I had money XD
---
And the irony is they buffed no one left behind to encourage hiding in a locker and waiting for your team mates to die.
---
Good thing it‚Äôs a bug :)
---
[New vs Old Cosmetic Changes](https://imgur.com/a/CmPfMEy)

Didn't know Keemstar was on reddit. Anyone got links to his info?
---
He means when your teammates misjudge how much time you have so that you don't die 0.3 seconds before they actually reach the hook.
---
and that is exactly why I stay in midranks because it is impossible to be successful using anything other than meta killers and perks
---
Childish much?
---
Ooo I love playing against a myers, especially jumpscare myers.
---
I don't HATE spirit I just prefer every other killer over her ATM. Maybe my opinion will change overtime :)
---
Yeah the lag was pretty bad when we first started. Hopefully that's a me problem and not the "dedicated servers" because if it isn't, yikes.

what the fuck is that hit disgusting

Thank you ü§ó.

Me getting a pc the 1st of October: I'll just wait another 2 months

There are a few cosmetics that aren't worth the auric cells. Adam having a slightly taller hairdo in one example

Don't worry, *I* understood the Sharp Hand Joe reference.
---
People probably get it confused with the [judo trip](https://m.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&amp;v=Ts1-3JqrG4A) which is very real and another attack Myers should have.
---
Yesssss now I can get two more chances at finding Hope in my bloodweb
---
I love going against 3+ flashlights. I can also tell if they're doing a quick switch. I just put on Lightborn and I love seeing them wasting time attempting to blind me at pallets to just get hit or downed and them all around me going for flashlight saves they won't get.
---
Dwight's new skin is meh but that new Ash one is awesome!
---
Yeah but I‚Äôm interested in seeing the actual effects cause I do see a decent amount of potential in demogorgon having real effect changing and style changing add-ons akin to doc and Michael
---
Want to see leg
---
Typical.
---
Cute wig.
---
Fred, he's just so fun to play as plus his power helps him in chases and gives him pressure so...plus I was a fred main before the rework bc of the memes and I liked a challenge, fred op plz nerf

I read this in her voice

Use them both

Are dedicated servers enabled on consoles?
---
Hey look at me go around in circles I‚Äôm so good
---
Wish I could do that to cancerous Ghostface players.
---
Well, I appreciate you keeping it civil despite the barrage of downvotes and me acting like an all knowing ass, but I still think the situation you described is quite rare because it requires two loops that are quite close to each other. Might be misunderstanding you here.
---
This hurts to look at
---
I love the dead by Daylight community
---
Ghost face is now a solid c or b tier killer lol
---
if it was reveal the obsession's aura to you and your aura to the obsession that'd be better
---
Can someone put this on YouTube
---
Well whatever you want to call it, I still have red rank Survivors run back to me or vault back over pallets and windows into me.
---
I rather they make green key useful. Even if it can be used to instantly open a treasure chest.
---
Not me.  I haven't been on DBD as killer lately.  Last few matches I did was as Ash doing a chase daily.
---
dying light isnt a nerf. first killers wont have to tunnel the obsession with it anymore. second you dont have to fully kill a survivor for it to activate, meaning survivors will have penalties to actions early game. and its possible to get 27% action penalty.
---
Killer doesn't lose their item when someone DCs ~~on loading screen~~ so...
---
Congratulations? You played yourself?
---
I mean that black could be a bust
---
He recently made a video saying he‚Äôs coming back to dbd actually. Meet him once while playing that last year game. Dude was incredibly condescending and trying his hardest to win while everyone was just messing around and having a good time.
---
That usually happens when I mange to down a survivor in the first 30 seconds of a match
---
You misspelt Spirit.
---
It's the proposed [Remember Me Nerf](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7aegar/postnerf_remember_me_flowchart/?st=k048qkyk&amp;sh=cb74abcb) all over again. (Killing the obsession would deplete half your Remember Me stacks)
---
Legit had and end game where I unhooked a guy with bt so he could escape then took the hit, used deliverance then decisive strike to escape. Killer has left the chat.
---
I know it's a meme but OP doesn't know anything about judo...
---
probably from borrowed time
---
Took them a few years
---
Why do you feel the need to identify that they‚Äôre red rank? 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what rank you are if you have to make a complete guess, especially against spirit. There‚Äôs very little outplay potential.
---
Yeah, I haven't bothered with that, since I don't play Adam anyway and I didn't care for that set and indeed, the hair was way too expensive
---
I absolutely hate playing against Ghostface. Every one I face is some kinda sweaty tryhard who moris everyone lol
---
No clue tbh. It happened when I switched to killer in kyf
---
i think he looks like elon musk
---
Lmao I'm not even annoyed with you anymore
---
K but top right looks like her neck snapped.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs actually an early state of left behind and then they realized it was broken. It‚Äôs only obtainable by cheating
---
Bruh they probably place holders
---
The numbers are way too low but I love what they did with it.
---
If know where the hatch is ahead of time, then you are escaping unless the killer mobilizes there fast enough. 
---
If the killer knows and you don‚Äôt, it‚Äôs actually better to try to go for one of the gates if your spawns are lucky. (Honestly most exit gate spawns need to be more dynamically spread out so the killer can‚Äôt just do a 180 and eye both of them. It‚Äôs just bad luck at that point. You‚Äôre honestly safer and more likely to get the gate if your gates are further out. 
---
If you and the killer don‚Äôt know where hatch is (less than 2 gens done and you‚Äôre the last one) then this perk will let you even more safely pick between finding the gate or finding the hatch. 
---
Getting a free DS or BT would mean the killer is going to just slug you down and let you bleed out if it‚Äôs DS-esque or just wait for you to touch the switch and yank you off, meaning no BT. Like, in both scenarios where the effect would be useful, you‚Äôre still gonna lose if the killer finds you. Calling it overkill is a bit silly, I‚Äôll admit because now that I think of most end game ‚Äúhatch‚Äù offs, you‚Äôre more likely to die because you‚Äôre getting chased for the hatch than risking a 50-50 for a gate.
---
maybe, hope so
---
Tracking scratch marks is a pretty basic fundamental to playing killer...
---
I really don't know what you're trying to imply here
---
Imagine 5 Omega Blinks with reduced fatigue.
---
Damn how did i not notice before that's yvett nicole brown
---
Yeah, not for the voice lines though.

-200 IQ play
---
Being a better version of thanatophobia isnt really impressive.  Thanatophobia is garbage.  Dying Light is useless now too.
---
That's certainly a thing...
---
This has some potential for certain builds but in the grand scheme of things I doubt it's that useful. Even the "don't be the obsession bit" seems kinda forced.
---
Definitely shouldn't be Ultra Rare. This is worse than Black Amber most of the time and pretty bad when compared to the gold tokens too.
---
I feel like it should reveal your aura instead, enabling you to guide your team to the hatch. Or for your team to find you and guide you to the hatch for a team exit.
---
I just wanna run faster in FF. I miss being fast. They can keep all the other nerfs. I miss my speedy boi/gril
---
I've had the myers things happen to me a lot. Sitting doing the bathroom gen and hear loud ass footsteps and get grabbed off the gen. I'm pretty sure my heart stopped.
---
I have interesting games with spirit and learn a lot from games with her but I just generally prefer the other killers.
---
I give it a week before it is nerfed during the full release
---
I mainly just want the DBD x Stranger Things theme to be released.
---
You have to download the zipped file to get the music. Blame Google Drive for that.

uh no it doesn't. freddy is a standard, loopable killer

Doctor is actually a doctor now!

Because she's a gamer girl and dont you know all gamer girls are cute little Asians that wear tight uniforms and are super sporty and have SUPER UNIQUE dyed hair :)))))
---
Ruin maybe?
---
I'll literally be jamming out to it everywhere I go for the next couple weeks.
---
Context: I was testing the dedicated servers and the new perk changes while running Dying Light, Bamboozle, Ruin, and STBFL as Pig. I had a lovely chat with these swf and asked them questions about the changes, but amongst the trash they were throwing at me they exposed how stupid they are themselves.
---
Sorry for the mouse cursor!
---
I dont really care for playing against ghostface but I also dont hate playing against him. I always have spinechill so the only time im ever expose is when I cant figure out where he's stalking me from. Him, the doctor, and the legion are the only characters im fine with being mori'd by though since I like their moris.
---
TBH those ratings say a lot more than the existence of this tweet.
---
Ruin gets destroyed 10 seconds into the match 95% of the time.
---
If they change that the new menu will look cool I think
---
That‚Äôs to balance the perk
---
Do you have a video? Not saying you're lying.
---
Yisus, at rank 5 Killer,  I swear those survs get full mode SWAT to rescue the one dude hooked like "Hang in there pal, We are about to blow this up"
---
 I even get scared when they approach me from different angles. No fear in those eyes bro, its all or nothing...
---
Omg a killer is using an in-game mechanic in order to succes in playing his role as the killer and killing all other players!!!!1!!!1!111 He is using a fundamental mechanic that exists to help him locate and chase other players OMG SO TOXIC
---
It unfortunately also happened before when they tested the dedicated servers.
---
*Huntress agressively breathes in background*
---
thing is, they arent the same. sometimes, you can get hit in the general vicinity of another survivor, and it counts as the "protection" scoring event because it sees you as having distracted the killer. and this works if youre several meters away. but for WGLF, it only counts if you get hit while so close to another survivor, that they would have been hit if you didnt. so it's just the same name for two slightly different things.
---
‚ÄúScrew yew geys, eym going home!‚Äù
---
switch out dead hard with object of obsession to make it more OP
---
Holy shit! Well played lol This would have been a fun game even as survivor.
---
I'd like to see a Med-kit addon that when used, opens a window where you can drag an available perk into your current build, swapping one out.
---
perma
---
You just have to know how the bloodweb works and you will get 2 perks everytime.
---
Unfortunately I don't record my screen at all times, so no.
---
He sounds like an incel
---
I never got to experience it :(
---
I'm always just right there on a survivors but and i run out. Like if I was just the tiniest bit faster I would get it.
---
I just realized I've never been morid by a legion
---
Bruh !
---
Nurse is S tier you IDIOT
---
https://youtu.be/f1LZfOALGnQ is a pretty good video imo.
---
Hehe try rank 12 against 3 tank 2s and a rank 1, they gave the big peepee that match. But they said sorry so that helps. They were also happy I didn't dc cause 3 party starters is good even if you get destroyed as killer
---
ew
---
I think the best fix is:
---
* Nerf the OP Killers such as nurse spirit or even billy
---
* Remove ruins from the game
---
* Increase gen repair time by at least 20%
---
And before people reply the classic "but survivors hate working on gens", Ruins actually make you work on gen longer if its not found early.
---
^Oink! I think shes leaving 
---
#OINK!
---
She got that wig from party city, girl
---
2 things to consider:
---
1. You can get 4 nodes before the entity will start swallowing stuff.
---
2. If you get 2 items thowards an item on the third ring of the web twice, you can guarantee to get both. This may change with the perks, but I feel like they'd have that planned.
---
So what this means is that if you got the items before the 2 perks you wanted, you should have been able to get them both.
---
Thank you! I'll watch it in a bit :)
---
LOL What the even heck?!?
---
I've had times where the hatchet flies right through the survivor,but the survivor is the usual suffering side lmao
---
Why would a survivor need to see the obsession? This would be better for killers
---
Dwight looks like every super greasy nerdy boy I had a crush on in high school, it is gross but in the way that kinda turns me on.
---
Just cause dedicated servers are out doesn‚Äôt mean your connection might not be good
---
Not sure honestly

---
&gt;So what this means is that if you got the items before the 2 perks you wanted, you should have been able to get them both.
---
I "prepped" two perks that I wanted to grab and the entity signalized it was going to grab one of them. I bought it before the entity could and instead of taking one of the other two, it immediately grabbed my other choice.

The fact that judo kicking doesn't exist just makes judo-kicking Myers even scarier.
---
I‚Äôve seen way worse
---
It's junk. 32m might have only hit one gen before, now at 24 it's going to be extremely fucking rare that you ever hit more than one perk.
---
Also lol at this "iT wUz 2 StRoNk 4 da 3 gEnZ". Umm, if the killer has a 3 gen strat then just fucking run away from the gens if they chase you, which is what you should be doing anyway so your teammates can finish the gens.
---
Absolute garbage perk.
---
Okay, so Nancy is Fine, Steve sounds *way* younger than he should be, and Demogorgon's screech is terrifying.
---
PTB IS OUT?
---
She had two add-ons, one to increase wind-up speed (a yellow) and some other one that was green.
---
I understand that it's possible for region to make my connection worse, but then why wouldn't region based matchmaking be implemented? It seems counter intuitive to place me into Brazilian servers. Hopefully it's just a PTB thing for finding games faster. 
---
The video is more of a meme than me actually complaining, if I was actually mad I would have mad the title a lot more ***ANGRY AND MAD*** while writing a 1000 word essay on Dead by Daylight.
---
that's lame I wish it was purple for ace in the hole
---
My glasses paired with No Mither and Unbreakable would literally make you unhookable, provided I read the wiki right.
---
Notice Me would pop off heals in 4 seconds, again, provided I did math right. If everyone ran it healing would be stupidly fast.
---
Old tech would probably be low tier.
---
I would love for open-handed to get a rise in popularity tbh. It's great with kindred.
---
what reason is there to dodge being the obsession though? Rancor...?
---
What the hell are you talking about?
---
There you go then. The nerf everyone was crying for.
---
the only perks that revolve around wanting to find the obsession are Rancor and PWYF.
---
Both are terrible but honestly if the killer has PWYF you sorta WANT to be the obsession because then they're not gonna kill you, lmao.
---
Yeah I'd stop playing DBD if that happened
---
I'm pretty sure he's supposed to be an ambulance driver or something.
---
Holy crap why does it matter if judo kicking is real or not.. just enjoy a meme and move on
---
Dude, he spent 5 years being trained by the very best e-sports pro gamers on how to run in a circle and drop a pallet. Don't mock him.
---
Just once
---
Or Hag's lettuce head. I definitely would have copped it if it weren't for that mess.
---
Detroit: Become Legion
---
I'm quite surprised that all the changes are positive lmao. They went from useless-toxic perks to might use perks.
---
They need to just redo his whole face.
---
What's wrong with that
---
I appreciate people who aren't toxic and put ttv in their name so i can go back and see the VOD and watch how i play. It's very helpful.
---
Lmfao you are embarrassing yourself kid
---
Howdy this was me lol - Bragdon On Air, I am on NA West servers not Brazilian lol.
---
ur mome
---
It allows you to play the killer it says in the description, once you have the killer they are not supposed to appear anymore but it‚Äôs dbd
---
Because both add ons reduce your movement speed, so you're super slow.
---
Well this was a smart choice of post!
---
His hand could be the fuzzy boxing glove from earlier in that episode
---

---
I was in that game :‚Äù)
---
The one with the hex game tag.
---
*sad titanic theme plays*
---
Leatherface isn't "Evil" per say. He just doesn't understand what he's doing isn't normal behavior. He thinks he's protecting his family.
---
Now if we could get his ripped up clothes or armor from ED2/AoD, I‚Äôd be set
---
I've been trying to change my mindset and culture.  Remembering that there is another human being on the other end and that I've been there, either being tunneled or doing the tunneling, and how bad I felt is pretty sobering.
---
you're right it does but I think the addon still isn't helpful because:
---
1. You don't know the killer has it until it's too late
---
2. Someone is going to be the obsession either way, and honestly I'd rather it be in my hands than a randoms.
---
r/asseating
---
What season is the middle cosmetic from?
---
Ah yes, the bandaged hand might work
---
Knife seks
---
Have you ever used the internet
---
I've had some pretty great runs and bullied Jason quite a bit.  Of course I have almost 1000 hours in F13 but still.  lol
---
It‚Äôs for players to test out a killer and hopefully get them to buy said killer. You don‚Äôt get to use any of the killer‚Äôs add-ons btw.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why the splinter showed up in your blood web if you already have the pig. It‚Äôs happened to me with Myers &amp; Freddy even though I got them a while ago.
---
I'm kinda disappointed with how dying light changed. It 100% needed to be changed but now it's another perk where being the obsession is a benefit. 
---
There should be a risk and reward factor for being the obsession but right now there's just too much of a benefit.
---
Oh so they are saying he‚Äôs fat lol
---
Well atleast it's decent now.
---
What's the Nerf?
---
That should be the animation for Pop Goes the Weasel when you kick a generator.
---
You sure ghostface isn't hiding behind that tree?
---
How so?
---
LOL Yup..  Or a team mate hears the faint whisper of the heartbeat.

---
Nurse because she respects the survivors enough to close their eyes after the Mori
---
I actually don't like playing vs Trapper because it's hard to find those traps sometimes and it makes you feel like an idiot if you hit them
---
Mine too considering im only gonna buy Steve's Scoops Ahoy and I have enough auric cells for that
---
I don't remember it being a bug in the previous ptb? Do you have proof?
---
Do survivors not know that the killer sees you when you're near the exits? If I see blood warden I just leave the area.
---
The power in IF is that it only shows living survivors so you can directly run towards them. Now you cannot be sure anymore.
---
S: Nurse, Billy, Leatherface
---
A: Trapper, Plague, Freddy, Hag, Doctor, Wraith, Ghostface, Clown,Pig,Micheal,Huntress
---
B: Legion
---
C:
---
D:
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think the add on is useful either. Hell, Nine times out of ten is rather be the obsession because of what we established about killer perks avoiding the obsession
---
Lol Jason is NOT overpowered. He actually needs a huge buff.
---
Oh no, another ultra rare addon that can possibly replace the other ultra rare garbage in the bloodweb! Huge nerf! Nevermind the fact that you get up to 4 perks in the web now! Nerfs all around!!!!!!!!
---
The Hair in general got a change. So pretty much everyone. Kate looks way better. Also laurie looks better
---
Are you actually braindead
---
Ikr?
---
reworked in PTB, now encourages you to leave your obsession alive and go for other people
---
Yeah but she can teleport
---
You cannot be sure if the popup is a slug or a healthy survivor anymore
---
This man gets it, literally guys who cares I don‚Äôt do judo so how would I know you guys are acting like I cleansed your ruin totem 15 seconds into the match.
---
Oh come on now I‚Äôm a p3 Claudette main but I like to support newer players
---
:D How was the game on your side? lots of lag or nah?
---
We're not bitching about it. We will gladly accept this addon, even if we're not sure when we'd use it over something else.
---
So wait, you're telling me Laurie doesn't look like she has pasta for hair anymore?
---
DERPY  animation glitch also happen in the next match :D
---

---
Oh I was gonna swear I was on dota subreddit. I completely agree with your take on dead by daylight community. Damn was I confused
---
When does console get this?
---
Pretty much yes.
---
You don't lose the tokens but the perk deactivates if the obsession is dead.
---
There would never be a buff without the community freaking out again. Remove feral Frenzy and give them an entirely new power. Complete rework like Freddy. Only way I see them viable and fun to play against.
---
Perhaps using a power that actually fits the theme of the Killer and makes sense for them.
---
When everyone else does. Probably this month at some point.
---
That's awesome! Pls do more if you can, I would love to see them :)
---
Never said you personally, in fact I'm grateful that you posted it. I wouldn't have known about it otherwise. I'm referring more to the comments.
---
The survivor he ends up accidentally camping without realizing the unwritten rules
---
The chapter part is tomorrow. Today is the dedicated server and bloodweb. We have seen this already and expected it.
---
oh thank yoy
---
SCARAMOOTCH, SCARAMOOTCH, WILL YOU DO THE FANDANGO?!
---
yeah i was kinda confused because i already had the pig
---
Really? That‚Äôs great! Do you have any pics of Kate you could message me? Sorry if I‚Äôm being annoying, I just love seeing improvement.
---
Why does that lowkey sound interesting though?
---
Yes but we are talking about the first survivor to get downed, not the first to get hit. The first player that got downed back in the first stages of the game is also the first player to get downed out of his teammates, no matter who got hit before. It's not like I will down you, and then down player B, but player B was the first to be downed. That's not how logic works.
---
They changed scoring events for the Obsession. I believe thats why
---
Am a David main
---
Should probably at the very least censor those other two Survivor names as well, my man, I'm guessing based on you censoring your own that you wouldn't want your name being shown in someone else's post either.
---
only if it comes with a mechanical hand
---
I don't understand what distinguishes Leatherface from Hillbilly. Neither were technically abandoned, they were just raised by incredibly shitty families.
---
Yeah, I have the cannibal and still get the ones for him too, Behavior is just 10/10
---
Already in bed browsing reddit sorry. But there Are some pics on /r/leaksbydaylight is the subreddit i believe
---
He's a lot better these days tbh
---
You're joking right? If you catch a camp counselor they're basically dead if you know what you're doing.
---
That looks pretty cool actually
---
It's cool I couldn't care less about downvotes, but I get what you mean. I just have a lot of map knowledge so I plan my routes before I get  into a chase and even during. The spirit is tricky but I just learned to watch the killer as closely as possible, no worries man
---
Keep this guy off our game
---
Yes, I didn‚Äôt need it explained to me I understood. Had you read my post, rather than skimming it before offering what you thought was necessary input, you would have noticed that I was offering a solution, not an explanation.
---
Same here. As someone who doesn't automatically buy the dlc on day one anymore, it's interesting to see how they'll play before they get released and what (if anything) changes.
---
Eh small improvement... she still still look wack
---
Oh yea don't get me wrong, veterans can make Jason look silly.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel, Ruin, Survailence, Discordance, Overcharge... All perks that can help with this. Learn to use them effectively. Not to mention we have 2 new killer perks that will help as well.
---
Slugging a survivor every now and then, not tunnelling and using certain add ons are also things that will apply pressure and/or get people off gens...
---
Also, learn to quit a chase against someone skilled and go after someone else. Chasing 1 survivor for a majority of the match is a dumb thing to do as well.
---
Your idea would kill the game.
---
All the survivors were from Brazil and my ping was roughly 120 while I am on U.S east coast with 100 up/down. So it must've been Brazilian servers as I normally get 70 or less ping anywhere in the U.S
---
Honestly it's kind of nice having it on cooldown so I can actually run when I want instead of waiting to be chased.
---
Closing steam and restarting it should make it work.
---
Also if you're referring to steam region, dead by daylight doesn't use that system.
---
Having perk synergy is generally good. It doesn‚Äôt make you feel like you have to shoehorn it into a build or when there‚Äôs synergy both perks are just stronger and it feels better as a result. Like Monitor and Abuse with Nurses Calling. You shrink your terror radius to catch people healing nearby and sneak attack them. 
---
Or like Enduring and Spirit Fury. That‚Äôs really obvious synergy. 
---
When the perk doesn‚Äôt have synergy it just plays awkward and Furtive Chase is already awkward enough because it doesn‚Äôt synergize with.....anything besides MYC but even then it‚Äôs a weak effect for two perk slots. 
---
When has wanting synergy ever been a bad thing?
---
The killer is right. Same thing applies to killer pipping, too
---
&gt; Rank 2 btw, have played 15 games today, 1 gained pip, 1 Loss, 13 Black
---
Uh yeah it's supposed to be hard to pip at this rank
---
I did read your post, and you talked about how you hit the first survivor you see, then move to the next survivor so the first one doesnt DC. Vad you read my initial comment, you would have seen that we are not talking about solutions, we are talking about grammar, and how there was no need for the double "first"
---
But it‚Äôs easy af to run Jason around. You can use windows and lock the door inside cabins. You just have to use your stamina wisely, know how to juke him when he is shifting, and know where you are going next. 
---
Most games I just waited for the timer to run out.
---
Never said it did, I'm just showing that dedicated servers do have problems. Not sure where you're getting the notion that I thought the servers were God sent
---
S Myers, Pig, Huntress, Leatherface.
---
A Wraith, New Freddy, Hag
---
B Billy because B
---
C Nurse, Spirit, 
---
D Plaag, Ghostface, Clown
---
F Legion, Doctor, Legion, Trapper, Legion and Legion.
---
Still cant find flashlight though
---
And this change would spoon fed killers wins
---
You got you own game and you were laughing on me, but know we are laughing about your game
---
Cool thanks! Wonder why I got downvoted for asking a question lol this sub is goofy :3
---
Yeah i got her free
---
Jokes on you, I run tenacity, unbreakable, iron will and boiled over at red ranks and play super care free. Either that or I go full head on build for the lols. Both sets work really well.
---
It means the same thing. It‚Äôs unnecessary, but doesn‚Äôt change the meaning. Nor is there _technically_ anything grammatically wrong with doing so. 
---
Btw, thanks for not ripping me to shreds there, my post came out a tad more condescending than I had intended.
---
Me an intellectual enjoys not_Queen using technician and Otzdarva using resiliance
---
nope. Joe Keery is the actor for Steve and Quentin is interpreted by Kyle Gallner
---
So the PTB isn‚Äôt out yet then. I thought it was. Thanks.
---
Thank god its what we actually want the mori to be.
---
Big brain moment.
---
With Bubba and Myers they were both raised by super shitty parents
---
Thanks for watching man, I'm super appreciative of you
---
doubt
---
She always looks nice üòçüòçüòçüòè
---
strong contenders for me was Freddy, leatherface and Micheal
---
I really enjoy the "through the guts" approach.
---
i‚Äôm gay
---
Yeah I took it off because it has failed too many times when it shouldn't have...I'm not sure if it's bugged on ps4 or what but they can be right in front of me and nothing will happen when the perk is ready to go.
---
I thought the ghostface license was for the mask, that's the reason he can look so different from the original and have all these cosmetics?
---
This is amazing
---
Holy shiesse, she does?
---
Okay good
---
I will try! I plan to do all the surviviors and try the killers tol
---
It won't be in a trial so he won't be powered by the entity. I'm sure he'll get exhausted shortly into the chase
---
Boi I agree with your S tier  
---
EXCEPT TRAPPER, You masochist.
---
I‚Äôm at work now, but I‚Äôll send you some when I get home.
---
I used to tunnel a LOT, now I try my best to rotate hooks but I usually chase whomever is injured or I see them first.
---
Thing is, if you are on your last hook you gotta lay low.
---
 I will last hook people if I see them because thats just common sense.
---
me reading this
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusZXECS0mM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pusZXECS0mM)
---
Yeah that how it works, you shouldn't be rewarded for a match that was clearly too easy for you
---
Trapper S but Hag F? Dude, you love traps or hate traps. Can't be both! /s
---
i think you like legion, im not sure tho
---
yes lots, especially at pallet drops you would lag and then get hit through it, happened to me once in the game with monto actually
---
Ohhhh ok I see, I was mistakenly thinking IF was Dark Devotion
---
Probably not it's most likely the fact they were preparing for the dlc and working on bugs instead of skins (yes I know design team is different then the development team but they can relocate people into different sections) that or they just don't have any good ideas for cosmetics
---
Looks awesome!
---
What's the difference??
---
I‚Äôm at work atm, but I‚Äôll send you some when I get home.
---
Actually most survivor mains like a challenge, bullying a baby isn't that fun
---
Yeee and Abed was in Winter Soldier
---
ah okay.
---
Honestly it captures his likeness pretty well. Most games aren't able to do that, there's always something a little "off" about the character (Nancy's model, for exmaple), but with Steve they did an excellent job.
---
Oh my gosh please pleasee I wanna see the new hairs &lt;3
---
you can see the ranks of your teammates before the game starts
---
You can escape without doing much at all. You can barely touch gens, never get chased, not do saves and still escape. They don't want to reward that. It makes total sense.
---
It's the same reason killers don't pip simply for getting 4 kills. There are various measurements of skill that are considered
---
legion r/detroitbecomehuman
---
Dark sense has also been changed to work even when a teammate completes a gen, not just you
---
Should take the stick out of your ass and shove a spelling book up in it.
---
Billy was abandoned or at least neglected for years leatherface's family at least liked him
---
I mean they got a subreddit for that lol.
---
Nice
---
Dang. Still super thrilled about the bloodweb changes, that‚Äôs my biggest hype.
---
Always wanted that one but an Army of Darkness version would be great. Younger Ash wearing full body armour
---
Imagine a young ash cosmetic, it would be cool but would counter his lore as ash is already old in ash vs evil dead
---
https://imgur.com/a/oq29CJT
---
Slightly reworded repost :/
---
It encouraged tunneling.  It made the game very unfun for one unlucky SOB. 
---
And if you didn't tunnel down the obsession? Good luck getting it to take effect at a reasonable time. 
---
Most people I've seen use it as a survivor? If they play fair and not scummy? Dying Light is useless cause it only starts taking effect on 1 or 2 generators left.
---
The change was needed.
---
You Husband now.
---
Ummm you used first twice.
---
Yup, you got it!
---
The whole Army of Darkness look would be perfect
---
&gt;You had the choice between Breakdown and Head On and you chose breakdown. I don't blame the Entity, I'd snatch that Head On up too.
---
Listen, I did it for science ok? I wanted Head On right from the start but I also wanted to see what the entity would do if I grabbed any of the other 3. I sacrificed Head On for the greater good!
---
Correct I almost forgot about that one!
---
FINALLY
---
I swear i only ever see hag when i take off urban or small game
---
He really isn't that fast, his animation just makes it look so.
---
I'd say just situational awareness and either spine chill or premonition (both, if you hate him that much haha)
---
If he is leaning/crouch around don't try to detect him, hide instead. But if you got clear LOS then go for detecting him
---
Also he knows when someone is detecting him...so if you want to stay hidden and he doesn't know where you are, point your camera away
---
It was a perk that encouraged tunnelling and usually a first hook mori which just destroys the fun for that unlucky obsession. Always hated it.
---
Oh my god.
---
thanks!
---
bruh
---
I understand some of those comments though, The only attention keys got since patch 1.1.2 (Which is somewhere in 2016) is this addon which is completly useless because of:
---
Golden token - Reveals **Survivors' Auras** when within **48 metres** of range. 
---
If you need heals and you cant see any survivors 48m near you, then it wouldnt be worth it running 48m+ to find the obssesion to heal. If you want to do gens with someone, It also isnt worth it running 48m+ just to get on a gen with the obssesion. 
---
Thus, Golden token completly outshines this one (And its only green too)
---
90% of the time they tend to be toxic teabaggers running object of obsession. They tend to derank so they look good on stream and they tend to be survive with friends using lackeys that will die for them.
---
Stereotypes have to come from somewhere originally. Not all are bad but most streamers tend to be quite cancerous because that's what gets attention and moris
---
This is gonna be harsh, but you have to get good. That's simply it. He is objectively the same speed as any other killer, so I don't know what else to tell you.
---
As far as his stalking goes, it's kind of buggy. There have been times I could not break him out and others when I broke him out without looking at him at all.
---
The key, however, is actively using your camera. In my experience, the people who have the most issue with becoming exposed are ones who keep their camera pretty static.
---
You could also bring Spine Chill to give you a heads up on his approach
---
Yeah same. I just started her so I‚Äôm stuck with being vulnerable and shitting myself every 2 seconds.
---
You‚Äôve never felt the power of DeliverStrike during the end game collapse. Yeet off the hook and just walk to the exit gate cause you‚Äôre just untouchable.
---
Dbd in a nutshell part 8
---
That looks weird they shoulda just kept it empty.
---
Spoiler
---
I love seeing people use hope because 7% doesn‚Äôt seem like a lot but i comes in clutch sometimes
---
What are you talking about? Hillbilly's parents were so ashamed of his physical deformities that they bricked him up behind a wall like a freaking Edgar Allen Poe story.
---
You can see evidence of it in Monto‚Äôs vid from a couple months ago
---
Considering it hasn't been announced, it can't be delayed.
---
Hmm.. they said that interaction wouldn't exist, while they may have changed their mind on that, I doubt being able to use PGTW for the kick afterwards is intended 
---
I suspect one of those is a bug and will be patched (either it interacting in the first place, or being able to double dip)
---
First if u know that it is ghostface play more carefully and look around alot. U also can look at him to take out his power. He is not faster than other killers so try to loop him same way than billy for example.
---
Very end of Season 3, where &gt;!Ash wakes up in a Mad Max style future and end the show on a cliffhanger.!&lt;
---
I love this perk a lot tbh, I just wish it notified your team if it activates. Guess you could always tell them beforehand and hope they remember.
---
"She has fuck beads"
---
Is how I initially reddit
---
Bubba wants itüåö
---
tru, tru
---
Most probably a bug.
---
Change your region to Denmark and use the zip code 3900
---
Yep. She insults the killer playerbase as a whole and quits, blocks, or reports regularly if the killer outplays her or beats her. She also deranks for easy wins.
---
But noob3 plays like an ass on purpose, how is this an argument against bullying streamers?
---
I want Samus' gun arm.
---
Michael is S tier for me, Nurse and spirit are at Z tier, but Im not a dick enough to D/C on my team
---
Everyone against a good nurse: 
---
Chuckles, im in danger :)
---
I like it
---
I‚Äôm confused. What‚Äôs PTB
---
Pretty much.
---
Combine this with the Furtive Chase and you could set up some interesting situations. Survivors who think they have the speed bonus but lost it when they were unhooked. Survivors fight might to become the obsession. That sort of thing.
---
But that's the thing, obviously I'm good. I win tons of matches I know how to tactically play. It's just this killer that makes it impossible. I dont struggle with any other killer. Are you sure this guy isnt faster then others. Because it seems like hes on my ass in seconds and always being insta downed it gives me no chance. I dunno man. Getting good isnt the problem here. He is obviously a unique killer in how plays. I dont understand why when I face ghost face the entire team is wrecked in minutes. NO OTHER KILLER CAN DO THIS TO ME.
---
Yes sir !
---
They want everyone to buy the only option they have then release more good ones so you buy those too because you didn't know about them.
---
Right click on the game in steam -&gt; options -&gt; ???? -&gt; verify game files
---
You should be easily able to figure it out on Google if you don't find it there
---
Hacking game files for certain items, teabagging, taking the game hostage, trash talk, he would derank himself on purpose so he could bully low rank killers and look good. Just to name a few things.
---
He's moved on from that and completed the Redemption Arc though. Now he's one of the good guys for the most part
---
I run the build on the right for the fun of it, combine ti with legacy and you got one hell of a threat
---
He has the same speed as every average killer, 115, like Trapper. 
---
Best counter to him is to simply look around and be aware of your surroundings. When you see him, try your best to reveal him before he can stalk you. If he is good at evading you then just get as much distance as possible. As a normal speed killer he can be looped the same as others. I think when you see him you must just get nervous and mess up? Try to stay calm against him and play safe if you are exposed. 
---
I suggest you run Spine Chill since it will tell you when he is looking at you and can be helpful against all killers.
---
No, but I know there are clips of huntresses one shotting 4 people with 1 hatchet.
---
She sounds like a piece of shit
---
I'm hoping the being able to kick afterwards is the bug, as this could combo well with Mindbreaker. It's not even that strong as they nerfed the radius of Surge from 32m to 24m.
---
The main thing is the insta downs. If he is even remotely close to me I have zero chance of escaping. Hes way faster then myers. At least myers is slow. Myers actually has to earn that insta. Unlike ghost face who can literally zero in on me and bam dead.
---
It didn‚Äôt matter. They knew end game collapse would kill them before the blood warden ended
---
Not really
---
Does it also apply Overcharge the next time the survivor goes to work on it?
---
Quentin is a Cutie but Steve is looking fresh there
---
did you guys check if the pop was applied to every gen? because this perk kicks multiple gens in an area right?
---
I think it would look better if they were smokey silhouettes instead of hard lined cutouts
---
And Dying Light
---
Edit: Okay, how did BHVR fuck it up this time?
---
I think 20 minutes temp ban would be good, because it‚Äôd turn into a strategy to leave the game to help the other players
---
ü¶ÄAsh has his hand againü¶Ä
---
What exactly about this is ‚Äúnew‚Äù?
---
Gold token presumably
---
A tunnelling killer
---
Good, 0 counterplay to the killer. You GUESS, if she's phasing, there is no skill in that.
---
We didn't, but I'm sure it does since Pop didn't deactivate after the down.
---
What about just rewarding the other side, like rewarding survivors if a killer dcs and just rewarding killer if a survivor dcs
---
Are you pc or console? Sorry I‚Äôm just trying to see if I can verify the issue
---
Yeah. It's just another game. People shouldn't get so worked up for the other person playing how they want.
---
Personally I prefer getting a Mori to dying on a hook. It means I get out of a bad match sooner and usually doesn't involve me waiting on a hook giving the killer more points while my team does nothing and I'm forced to watch.
---
The Mori also makes me feel special.
---
As a side note I play Both Sides equally and would never put .TTV in my name because that's gross and I bring a Mori for streamers every time.
---
Well if you don't like giving away your position when he's looking for you, then that's you're move. Can't have it both ways
---
What did people expect when they opened this, it literally says demogorgon mori.
---
if he is a dev he could ahve the perk. if he aint well then he should be banned.
---
They‚Äôre going to start leaving behind husks if they DC, so you can still get benefits from perks that involve hooking them. Not sure when it‚Äôs going to be implemented though.
---
How do we not have Evil Dead 2 Ash yet?
---
lmao yeah
---
&gt; Are you sure this guy isnt faster then others
---
yes, it is an objective fact
---
&gt; obviously I'm good. I win tons of matches I know how to tactically play.
---
&gt; NO OTHER KILLER CAN DO THIS TO ME.
---
Okay, fair enough. You need to get good and apply your skills here in this scenario, with this killer :P
---
It sounds like your main issue is being exposed. So let's work that out!
---
Are you being exposed *during* a chase, or before?
---
Maybe I do suck. But that means that every team I play with sucks too. I also see alot of people disconnecting when they know its ghostface. I refuse to give up though. And I may bitch about how op he is. But I dont want a nerf. I want to conquer this overpowered asshole and win. But it seems impossible
---
I need proof. In this ptb it might be happening, but in curiois if this was a bug beforehand.
---
Ps4, also have restarted multiple times, actually got into a match and played through it when that just happened again
---
If it worked with Pop it would probably work with Overcharge, yes. It seems Surge counts as 'breaking' the generator, as described in Pop's description.
---
But then the survivors get completely screwed over because one dude left and now the killer benefits
---
Noed=DC forehead
---
Just another toxic streamer who gets away with their behavior because of popularity or the advantage of being female on Twitch. She's not as bad as she used to be but still definitely not a good example of the community. She uses her influence to punish people better than her
---
Unless it's a bug then you aren't
---
There are four perks, meaning you can take two instead of two perks and you can only get one. 
---
This cuts the number of webs down hard.
---
What is the new DL?
---
My main survivor cool! (except I use the pink hair but epic doll either way)
---
Did you restart the game? And how much storage is left?
---
i think its more towards it should be a op perk for hostage docs but i see your point.
---
Number of teachables. There‚Äôs 4 with two to take instead of 2 with only one to take.
---
Except with this addon, the aura reveal is permanent. You don't need to channel the key to see it. Having a permanent aura reveal on another survivor is pretty strong
---
Myers: Stabs
---
Leatherface: Clubs
---
Hag: **S  L  A  P**
---
thats crazy. Insane to think you could apply PGTW to a 3 gen situation lol
---
Okay wow I didnt know that he can tell when hes detected. Alright that's a nice piece of advice there.
---
I've played 5 games on ptb today, every round I had at least one OoO running best Flashlight, ds, adrenaline and Borrow time. always red rank aswell. I'm rank 13. . .
---
This image bothers me so much and I don't know why
---
You can have videos auto play while scrolling through
---
I'm famous now
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any mention of the new status effects in the patch notes. How exactly is Obliviousness and Undetectable applied?
---
I edited my previous comment, and about 100 GB, although I don't know why that would be a problem, never seen something like that before
---
I sincerely hope this is a band-aid fix for a later change
---
gEn RuShInG aNd DoInG oBjEcTiVeS iS tOxIc
---
Typically I run self care spine chill and an exhaustion. Sometimes I'll run wglf if I'm farming points. But no matter what spine chill and self care on every build
---
Yeah I guess. I think the best option would be to give a bp multiplier depending on your rank so that there is a good reason to not dc and stay and pip
---
New gen regression perk, you just run to a gen and fucking drop kick it
---
Are you newer? The game has a wild learning curve and ghost's brand of stealth could be more difficult than Myer's or Pig's
---
I understand people wanting to tweak it some but it's brand new, it's probably going to be modified. Some of the comments are just completely ungrateful. They want to complain more than anything else and I'm tired of seeing that part of the community. 
---
It probably shouldn't be ultra rare, but, from what I understand you don't even have to channel it. It's not useless by any means. It's like being able to bring a 1-person bond with you in game. It gives the green key value which is what people have been asking for this whole time.
---
Best QOL change ever.
---
Thank you, kind sir
---
Ill do pink hair Nea at some point
---
I was just thinking about this...
---
Wat
---
Nah. True talent tested live and it didn't work
---
It's actually more difficult to get the exposed status as Ghost than Myers
---
Been playing about 3 monthes I'm rank 3. Was rank 1 until these last few matches were I got destroyed by ghostface over and over again lol
---
play console and you get doc, hag, feng and ace for free
---
I agree but with the new Dying Light I'm going to bring Knock Out and just keep slugging the obsession repeatedly so they can't suicide on hook, but won't be doing gens. I agree being tunnel-mori'd sucks but at least it's over quick. New DL arguably is going to promote nearly as unfun gameplay if the killer wants to milk as much advantage as he can out of it.
---
Yay, now it's even easier for SWF groups to bully the killer and/or farm solo players. Woohoo.
---
re-work legion
---
‚ÄúWHAT DO YOU MEAN WE‚ÄôRE OUT OF ONION RINGS???‚Äù
---
But when people just decide to leave because they got downed, they don‚Äôt get punished even though they messed up the match for both killer and surv. I genuinely think a 20 minute temp ban would be perfect because if you left because of an actual emergency you would only have 10 or 5 minutes left of the ban when you come back
---
It doesn‚Äôt say it is, though you can only get so many hooks.
---
Non licensed killers and survs can be bought for iredescent shards that u gain from leveling account up. However, licensed character can only be bought by donating.
---
Tbh, there is nothing unique about the survivors themselves, all they do is give you access to their perks. As for killers, most worthwhile killers can be bought with in game currency
---
It‚Äôs an save/profile error usually caused for when you still have the game on when you turn off your console usually. If restarting and checking if it‚Äôs up to date doesn‚Äôt work try hard restarting your console( not a factory reset but a proper restart) or if that doesn‚Äôt work uninstall and reinstall
---
This is golden!üòÇ
---
I defintally can loop pig or myers and usually hide and escape
---
Yeah I'm not gonna pretend all of them are saints, but I think everyone deserves a fair shake.
---
r/dontputyourdickinthat
---
im sorry dude, but those perks.... not a single one of them makes any sense
---
If anything you should enjoy the salt, those people are stupid enough to complain about PERKS
---
I would get David at some point. His perk, were gonna live forever is great for BP farming and helps you level characters up faster.
---
Yep, that's also the reason the MTV show had a different mask.
---
So what is different when it's Ghost? Does it mess you up when he hides his stain?
---
You can unlock characters with play time, technically for free. 
---
Out of 12 DLC killers (already counting Demogorgon), 6 you can unlock for free. 
---
Out of 12 DLC survivors (already counting Steve and Nancy), 6 you can unlock for free.
---
This is for the PC version.
---
That could work nice but I still think there needs to be rewards for higher rank because all you get right now is long queue times and tougher matches
---
Before a chase typically. Usually when my spine chill lights up I try and move.
---
ok then you can only down 1 survivor at a time.
---
How does he play like an ass though? By looping and doing flashlight saves?
---
The only thing I don't like him for is running long windows, I find that and bringing in instant medkits very deplorable but I wouldn't say thats "toxic" by itself.
---
It goes from probably one of the worst perks in the game to one of the worst perks in the game still I think
---
The Void
---
That sounds like necrophilia with extra steps
---
How so? I'm open to criticisms
---
Yup, he gets the same audio indicator as you and if you fully detect him he gets a specific location indicator I think
---
I just like Quentin's bloody jacket
---
A BP multiplier + the 20 min temp ban would probably be the best result
---
Well at least for right now
---
Jake has the best hair change overall IMO
---
What‚Äôs your twitch ?
---
what is shrine of secrets? i don't understand the bloodweb/etc.
---
If you're leaving when Spine Chill lights up there's no way he would be in a position to stalk you well
---
It was a joke about the brazzers logo. Since there is a dbd subreddit where it's all porn.
---
That's why I only bring an ivory unless I recognize them and their cronies.
---
So that way if they're not being that bad or toxic I can just not use the Mori on them.
---
I actually like moris, I wish there was an option to mori someone instead of hooking them a third time.
---
Yeah I did leave it open for awhile, so that makes sense, thanks for the help man
---
i think my newest console is a ps2.
---
A lot of people prestige with a ton of BP saved up, thus avoiding the situation your meme describes. That's why that guy asked.
---
Sure. But is a guaranteed derank if the killer brought a mori and you‚Äôre dying light. At least when the game is prolonged you can safety pip.
---
WAAZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP
---
Oh yeah it‚Äôs certainly not good. The post was just about scummy tactics with the new Dying Light as a meme and Furtive Chase can also apply
---
Looks brutal and underwhelming at the same time if you consider no limbs will be torn apart.
---
It looks like he's trying to start it
---
Public  T E S T  Beta

Yep we just gotta wait and see I'm betting it's a glitch

---
Well see the thing is its one of the most broken addons in game that take no skill to use. So I dont blame them
---
They could always do that in the first place by simply listening for the hatch.
---
Playing killer now has input lag so people are testing the characters that might suffer the most because of it. 
---
Huntress is the most affected and Nurse could have some issues as well with charging and releasing her blink.
---
The insta down. So typically I will escape every chase injured because of that quick boost you get when hit. But when his bloodlust starts getting fast and he hits my once I'm downed. Does this guy ever have to hit you twice or is it always insta ? I've never had a ghostface him me twice. Always once and I'm dead
---
Is there a big reason you wouldn't want to be the obsession, honestly?
---
Thank you for being a good person. Not all Claudettes are evil.
---
Look, Mum! I'm on TV!
---
yes, currently bloodwebs have max 2 perks at any level, this one has 4. pretty neat change
---
Say you hook every non-obsession twice. You hook the obsession, they get saved, now you can hook that person again to gain a token you couldn't get otherwise. It ups the maximum tokens without killing anyone from 6 to 7.
---
Resilience is actually legit, improved vault speed and tons of other actions!
---
Technician not so much, but I say not_queen can enjoy whatever perks she likes lol

Jane is eligible to receive the male genitals
---
Public T E S T Build*
---
It's literally at the top right of your screen at all times üòÇ
---
And yea the red stain might be a factor. Honestly I need to learn how to put space in a chase before I take a hit. Cause obviously with him I will always die on the first hit.
---
How come my post keep getting taken down?
---
Shrine is part of Shop where random 4 teachable perks pop up every week. U can buy one for 2000 iredescent shards. Bloodweb is your character level upgrading. In it u can obtain items, addons and perks.
---
Every survivor and killer has unique bloodweb, so it mean that u need to upgrade every surv and killer separately
---
I think the best chance you have is either having two generators done so it spawns after the last survivor dies, or you find it and the killer downs the other survivor away from it.
---
Isn't there a still chance it doesn't send you to the map? Or are you implying its bugged which is a possibility too since its the PTB.
---
Not only do I find both sides fun, but it helps me not choose sides and see what's  unbalanced and balanced about the game. It doesnt hurt to try it out a bit, but if you enjoy killer more, just keep playing more killer than survivor
---
But myers walks tho right ? He feels alot slower
---
I imagine it's hard to make controls for a mobile game.
---
Nah I get that. But the way I see it, if i'm gonna fuck around and troll. Why give the killer more points?
---
New content isn't enabled yet. They will enable it tomorrow at 3 PM UTC.
---
Yeah. At least for the last survivor or something. Most of the time people have too few of them to actually want to risk losing one by bringing it into a match.
---
They give the killers character and I know they were originally supposed to allow you to choose between hooking or killing but the developers saw it as overpowered and remove to that idea.
---
I still agree to an extent. Bare minimum we should at least be able to kill the last survivor. Or after a gate has been opened all survivors can be killed.
---
The whole point of Hag is that she's good at shutting down loops before they begin. So if you're looping a Hag really well it's because she is being played wrong. I've only ever gotten looped hardcore as  a Hag before and it was at the killer shack, I was being stupid and wouldn't break the chase to set traps.
---
Shit Myers will expose me and I dont even see his ass. He will be on the other side of a wall and I'll get exposed lol
---
You get more characters but the game is more expensive compared to pc
---
The servers are brand new so obviously they aren‚Äôt going to be fucking top notch amazing no problems. You dick üçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜüçÜ
---
Every week 4 perks go up on what's called the "Shrine of Secrets" which is a part of the in-game Dead By Daylight store. You can exchange iridescent shards you get from playing the game and leveling up your account to unlock the perks so they can start showing up in your bloodweb.
---
The blood web is a sort of grid that contains perks, items, offerings, and add-ons that appear more or less randomly. You exchange bloodpoints you earn and save up from each match you play for the contents of the bloodweb, kind of creating a patch through what you want. But at some point the Entity (the antagonist of the universe) will begin blocking some off so you have to choose carefully
---
I personally recommend to always play the opposite so you understand how they think, use loops, and mind game.
---
Survivor will find the hatch ez so you can‚Äôt get the achievement
---
They changed like half of the new perks. 
---
Nerfed killer buffed survivor...
---
the second one is wayyyy too situational, the first one requires teammates to kill themselves on hook, and third one heals you but then instantly makes you onehit again? like what. i dont see the value in any of the perks
---
I love devi
---
I'm sorry, are you the Huntress? If not, don't treat fellow people like slaves and remove their freedom of speech!
---
I didn't open it I was scrolling on mobile and it auto played the video
---
I definitely agree on that! although very occasionally when I'm playing high ranks and just had a bad day and then run into an omega blink nurse i do sometimes disconnect
---
I'd say Spirit is more "Poop yourself because she whooshed to your gen and grabbed you off" tier.
---
Yes, I believe people should play both. It stops you getting burned out or jaded about one side, and lets you see what frustrations the other side has to deal with.
---
They specified that the perk shouldn‚Äôt work with PGTW, Overcharge or Surveillance and considering it was still letting the Killer kick another gen with Pop i‚Äôd presume it‚Äôs a bug.
---
Mematic?
---
Does stalk trigger the insta down ? Or is he always able to insta down?
---
So, was [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cuwkwi/new_blood_hunt_event_date_revealed/) just fake?
---
If you play both then you'll properly understand the other side.
---
Like if you play survivor a bunch then when you go back to killer you'll be able to get a grip on how survivors act, for example...
---
A survivor misses a gen skill check, you go over and don't see anyone so you might just leave the area...but the survivor might be hiding behind something that you wouldn't have normally looked. Does that make sense lol
---
Plus you can also understand how certain perks work, it's all very well reading about it but something else seeing it in person.
---
LAURIE MAINS RISE UP! Slightly better
---
yeah but usually nothing worth dcing over
---
How cool would it be if Dark Devotion made the obsession look like the killer during the duration.
---
Love me some oversaturated content.
---
Sad old noises*
---
Read the new spam thread these posts are against the rules now
---
Hey don't be so harsh get to know them a little bit
---
Yeah they need a better placeholder for empty slots but the best thing I can think of is to rework the lobby screen to be the four survivors actually sitting at the campfire on logs, and just have the empty slots be just logs.
---
This gives me serious **Little Big Planet** vibes, I love it (side note, I really miss that game, wish they‚Äôd make an equivalent for Xbox or something)
---
Can I give it to the huntress?
---
&gt;So, was this post just fake?
---
It is not fake but the source is not BHVR. Always take the information on the wiki with a grain of discredit.
---
Armored Ash is probably my most wanted cosmetic, alongside his torn up look from Evil Dead 2

It's a PTB.

Agreed.

Thanks for the help yall
---
Well im little scared of farming as survivor.
---
Urgh, I just assumed it was true. Thank you!
---
Your joking right... 101 upvotes!?... I have work to do
---
I think what he meant to say was *I want legions ability to be changed*
---
It was supposed to be the original ending to Army of Darkness. Pretty cool that they brought it back.
---
They may have gone back on that and changed the radius of the perk to 24m instead, to allow consistency between perk descriptions without making it too powerful. I say keep the 32m and see what happens. :D
---
Fusion is just a cheap tactic to make low tier killers stronger
---
Strange that it seems to be a PTB only bug.
---
Not when it's only one survivor and limited use. You might as well just run Empathy or Aftercare. Like I said, it's got no business being Ultra-Rare. That's basically saying it's as useful as a BNP or an iridescent bulb. Not even close.
---
But i really want to try survivor.  I think they're little easier
---
The first perk is a joke on how in the movie people start killing themselves on accident, and I was.just trying to not make op perks. Guess I should redo them?
---
That feels like something you can fix to be honest, because that sounds like a recipe for setting yourself up to see things you don't want to see as well.
---
Probably because Ash vs Evil Dead is a separate license from Evil Dead II. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the case or not but it‚Äôs my best guess.
---
It's my reddit name minus the DBD part!
---
This is fine :)
---
Rule 8, friend. We know its bad
---
What triggers his insta down? Is it exposed that does?
---
I love the fact that bullshit mm posts have become spam. Like that's so fucked about this game lol.
---
Jesus Christ people still hate on him? Grow the fuck up and move along.
---
Interesting....
---
only time i dc is when i get insidious face camped and i just do it so the killer doesnt get pips/points for ruining the game for me
---
This is something I didn‚Äôt know o was missing in my life.
---
Ha, you think that makes any change? I still don't have friends!!
---
Literally.
---
Ikr i think they should still be allowed so BHVR FIXES THEIR FUCKING GAME
---
It's so hard to explain. Try google or search tutorials. Visually teach every aspect is much easily
---
Bro it‚Äôs a public test build, literally anything can and will change
---
Honestly, I'd prefer they fix his overall character model. It looks more like a cheap cosplayer instead of Bruce Campbell. Another way to put it is that the in-game Ash definitely doesn't have a chin that could kill...
---
Probably should have waited a bit closer to the gate
---
Dont be worried about it. The worst thing you'll encounter as a survivor is being face camped. Even then it isnt the biggest deal. I tend to struggle so my team can make progress, but you can also just kill yourself and move on from it. Dont worry about rank and you'll have fun, at least in my opinion
---
So it comes when he stalks u and u can counter it by looking to his face
---
It got a buff?
---
I‚Äôm one of the few Ghostface‚Äôs who don‚Äôt camp. Sorry bout the majority of them tho.
---
Hmm, thats a good advise but i dont know when to change from survivor to killer and opposite. After i dont know maybe after im getting bad games as killer or survivors?
---
Because edgy kids find him funny and couldn't care less about everything he's done.
---
But does it taste like one?
---
So revealing him gets rid of Insta down is what your saying?
---
This is a really good perk combo hope it's not a bug
---
Mod suppression force needs something new to get their rocks off.   Can't have actual issues experienced in game disrupt the unholy view that game is perfect.
---
Update with the scoreboard screenshot, good luck!
---
I think thats because they thought Obsession was a good idea, especially thematically, when they released Myers. They were right to some degree but at the same it opens up a playstyle thats incredibly unfun to play against and honestly toxic. I'm really not sure the thought process behind OG Dying Light, it really only encourages you to play one way and its not very fun for the person that is the obsession. The biggest issue with Obsession perks is that things like Dying Light and Rancor are fine when they were made to punish perks like Decisive Strike but if the entirety of the survivor team doesn't have an obsession perk between them it feels like you are being punished for losing an RNG battle with your teammates. Dying to Rancor mori's when you're not running an obsession perk feels like shit tbh.
---
Yes if he hasnt exposed u yet
---
oh my god this got leaked hahahha
---
Wdym this is peak human comedy
---
I always thought "The Beast" that the entity uses to keep the killers in check would be a cool killer
---
And don‚Äôt forget oblivious on the PTB
---
Eh I think there needs to be a limit but yeah it's an issue that should be forever there until they fucking fix that shit. Like a nice nail in their foot.
---
As killer, I like Left Behind being buffed, anything being made more viable besides the big 4 is good for the game in general. Not too hyped about dark sense being buffed though since killer aura reveal with swf is kind of broken as it is.
---
GF: Can I get you guys anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me Know! Oh, God love ya.
---
Yeah, there's some weird shit over there.
---
Either it's random or rarity could play a part in it as well.
---
They'll go crazy for you, good luck killer
---
How must it feel to be a Quentin main?
---
A guy left and the game was cancelled.
---
Followed you! I‚Äôll try to tune in! You play console or pc ?
---
Needs more compression I can still make out the image.
---
Lol no it doesn't. It lasts for 1-2 minutes normally
---
Adding a QOL change does not effect any of that and will be done with or without a simple lobby system.
---
Snitches god damn y‚Äôall hate fun huh?
---
Add a dash of Make Your Choice and baby you got a stew going!
---
Severe nerf IMHO. I get old Dying Light "Tunnel N' Mori" gameplay was unfun as fuck for the Obsession, but at least it was over quick. 
---
Now it's a weaker Thanatophobia which can be countered by the obsession DCing.
---
Please Valve just give BHVR the rights to Bill you can't do anything else with the character at this point just let them take him and give him a Hawaiian shirt its all I want just let him get to the Florida Keys like he always wanted to please bro please.
---
This looks so dumb lmao
---
That and because even if the protection worked every time it‚Äôd STILL be bad.
---
They both have a movement speed reduction as they stalk and both have 115 percent regular movement speed. When Myers hits his 1 hit stage, though, he also gets a longer lunge and faster vault speed
---
Look at the notes.
---
Probably but I usually run out when I do that. I would have ran out if I new my controller was low but my controller gave no warnings of low battery

---
This is what they announced during the stream.
---
You can go in a custom game where you'll have access to all the perks and read and see what's changed. 
---
They nerfed surge nerfed cruel confinement, buffed second wind I think and buffed camaraderie.
---
Thank god I got it forever ago then... feel bad for people doing it today
---
Zap them boys, you funky little doctor!
---
When I started I played them equally. Maybe one night will be killer only, one night survivor.
---
After a year I class myself as a survivor main but I'll play killer every now and again, like if I'm wanting blood points, a daily ritual and so I don't become too rusty.
---
Try them equally my man.
---
Ok, thanks for advice. Im scared of farming but i heard there will be some changes in bloodweb so maybe it will be easier for new players, me as survivor xd and people who dont really play too much.
---
WAZZAAAAAAAA
---
It ended cuz someone left before it started.
---
Rip you, that's why I leave.
---
Its not great but i like that they added something new
---
That's because his stalk and exposed effect is not individually based like Ghost's. Ghost only exposes individuals and has a much shorter duration than Myers, who exposes everyone at once
---
Could be related to the dedicated servers
---
He has to stalk for it
---
Let‚Äôs also make killers move at 160% speed, and let‚Äôs remove pallets from the game.
---
And then their heads remain the same.... I hope that's not the case.
---
It's the Public Test Build. Every player who's playing through stream can access a test build of the new mechanics and report bugs before the update goes live for everyone.
---
It's cute that you can propose to people in dbd now. Just drop them a key with that add on :D
---
Seems pretty weak to me as an actual add on tho. Just run bond/the other much better add on that lets you see survivor auras.
---
Same! Once i get devour hope on all my killers i think ill be able to narrow it down more easily
---
I‚Äôve decided I‚Äôm gonna do a meme like this for every survivor and their associated stereotype any suggestions for the next?
---
But this encourages people not tunnel
---
bruh i hate teamates
---
It's probably because somebody else was already in the killer role with Michael selected but you switched as well to the killer role but you had huntress selected. If you were to try and go into that game you wouldn't be able too as it won't let you start with two killers and of they changed to survivors there would he nothing there and you'd have do deselect and reselect huntress to see her again. This is also a cheat way to see who the killer is playing as in KYF if you quickly switch to killer then back.
---
I think my other replies essentially covered this. Let me know if not
---
He's 14 years old. Doubt he is a dev xD

:( I am sad now, but also get filled by happy memories, confusing.
---
Noooooooooo, that's the worst. All that waiting..... For nothing üò≠
---
I just started leveling up laurie and plan on playing her, at least i know whats coming now.
---
Maybe. I hope it gets fixed before dedicated servers come out. That would be a disaater if it made it into the main game.
---
I didn't have any problems with the game before I installed the PTB. After, it would always fail file verification after every update. Inlcuding smaller ones. I had to reinstall the game to get it to stop. 
---
As much as I want to try out ST, I'm still on the fence about doing the PTB. Plus I don't want to get bored with the content before everyone else gets it.
---
someone have the kate hair old and new? Plsss
---
I think we‚Äôre more humble because we have crossplay with both switch and pc on a few games as well as the game pass which allows for us to try out games we may have otherwise avoided because we didn‚Äôt want to shell out 30-50 $. From what I‚Äôve noticed though PS4 has the better exclusives (imo) but they‚Äôre also more toxic in games like Overwatch and R6 Siege.
---
If they have decided to include it to work with those perks they all need updating then to be honest because all the descriptions will be massively inconsistent. Surge refers it causing an ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù, PGTW refers to the next gen you ‚Äúbreak‚Äù and Overcharge says ‚Äúperforming the generator damage action‚Äù which is confusing.
---
Damn that would be kinda cool
---
Kate gonna find out just how thicc our Bubba boy is ;)
---
Literally no one who has ever played survivor would agree with this logic.
---
And it sucks cuz I had time enough for one game before I had to leave for like 2 hours :/
---
Yeah cause cheating to get an advantage is fun.
---
i added u back. hopefully we‚Äôll play sometime bc i‚Äôm getting so sick of solo q
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone likes this doofus lmao
---
Thank u for advice. Im going to start playing survivor tommorow.
---
This would be greatly improved if the silhouettes were also T posing
---
yess i got on top of a chest before i was like huh
---
It's been sooooooooo long
---
Nope
---
Michael has grown tired of using a kitchen knife and now adheres to the way of YEET
---
Metal of man used to be good....
---
Ahhh. I thought you meant like farming killers Haha. It is a bit of grind. If the grind worries you, level up David first. He has Were Gonna Live Forever. Basically, if you preform 4 safe hook rescues/take 4 hits for other survivors in a match, you'll get double bloodpoints
---
Ik. I‚Äôm gonna get hate but I think that the hillbilly should get an ‚Äúevil dead‚Äù skin with his chainsaw being his hand.
---
Would you wanna play sometime? I mainly play on PC but I have it on Xbox 1 also
---
Rip no season 4 tho
---
That's a really overpowered perk combo and thankfully obviously a bug. Probably not a bug so much as it is an oversight. It probably just tells every gen that it got locked by the killer and the game takes that to imply PGTW was proc'd. 
---
Down a survivor and all gens in the area lose 30 whole seconds of progress. Fuck that.
---
Do you have a link for that? I can‚Äôt seem to find anything on it.
---
Petition should be to the licence holder, not Behaviour. They can‚Äôt do anything with Myers without permission from the people who own the licence. I wish you all the luck in the world convincing Universal Pictures into allowing this.
---
This is very good for people going for his adept because now it doesn't contradict his other perks
---
Woah woah, treat people like WHAT? I don‚Äôt have to listen to your racism, buddy.
---
I'd love original evil dead trilogy outfits but the license is for Ash Vs Evil Dead so I doubt we'd get anything from the trilogy sadly
---
Did something like this the other day with legion and NOED, got told to fuck off after. Idiot should have did bones
---
He munches! He crunches! He enjoys survivor Lunches!
---
We can't even play the new map.
---
oh sorry i havent seen the movie, but yes, redo them. the ideas themselves arent too bad, but try to remake them with more thought behind what they would bring to the table
---
One is sexy the other isnt
---
You're making out like the effort of remaking the lobby is not worth playing with your friends.
---
Good luck. I used to main doctor he is a lot of fun
---
Seems kinda lame they nerfed the killer perks. They didnt seem that good to begin with while the survivor ones were pretty good already. Feels like they been going hard on killers. Not really giving any strong perks in a while. Thankfully nothing seems too busted on either side.
---
However if you have the killer already, all tour perks can be used with the offering so you can have some fun tricking survivors into thinking there‚Äôs a more.
---
BEHAVIOR, WHAT HAVE YOU DONE!?
---
Oooooh! Didn‚Äôt realize that! Aww man üòï
---
Oh man he deleted the comment
---
That's legit kind of awesome...I didn't know me and Bruce had that in common!
---
Moonwalking leaves no information either
---
I mean clown can take a finger but I doubt BHVR would take someone‚Äôs head off
---
Signed
---
But Ash brethren, what of a tuxedo as in Bruce Campbell's Spiderman 2 cameo
---
One step closer to seeing teammates loadouts so I can yeet the fuck out of any game where I match with Urban Evasion/Self-Care users.
---
I've noticed in my Ghostface games that it's buggy. A lot of the time I don't get the detection indicator at all.
---
I love Alert so much, I never realised what a good perk it was until I was trying to get Adept Feng. It's helped me get better at chases.
---
LOL THIS WAS MY ROOMMATE. I walked into the living room to get some water, and he had the biggest shit-eating grin on his face.
---
Could be legit if it consumed PGTW, because as it is, you'll have it for 60secs, making it absurd
---
Yeah it's two different licences so probably never gonna get a trilogy ash skin unless devs pull a sneaky [and probably expensive] one on us
---
Had to make sure my boys were safe.
---
Wazzuuuuuuuuuuuuup üòÇ
---
For sure.
---
Amen brother
---
thought this format was dead tbh
---
Plague would turn around then continuously vomit explosively for fast travel. 
---
Doctor would electrocute a sewer lid like Static Shock to zoom around. 
---
Leatherface will stick his chainsaw into the ground and ride around on it. 
---
Trapper would ride a motorcycle. 
---
Clown would drive a clown car or float around with bunch of balloons.
---
Ghostface would teleport to lockers
---
No that's the busted version that never made it in the vanilla game
---
I know.
---
By most of the community you mean your hearsay
---
AUUGHAUGH is best boy don't @ me
---
LMFAOO imagine getting this mad. I hate reddit. Y‚Äôall cry to much.
---
Are Steve's moans sourced from gay porn??
---
I've been followed by these dark creatures ever since i'm in search for a match
---
I don't like the entity blocker change because it implies to me that BHVR think that running Bamboozle is actually some sort of mind game.
---
Thank u!!
---
He talked about it last year but [here is a recent interview ](https://youtu.be/i2AULc3sg28)where he talks about the game.
---
Im devotion 2 and I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing
---
At least ghostfaces power has more uses outside of camping unlike bubba
---
How is spirit not in top tier her back story is fucking tragic
---
PC, its where all the cool kids are (just kidding!)
---
He obviously wants Legion to be the most jacked dude of all time.
---
Hmm, Were Gonna Live Forever will work good with  Deliverance?
---
Imagine thinking im mad. Just telling you my opinion my dude. You need to chill.
---
The opposite was true. Some of the new killer perks were extremely good, whereas a majority of the survivor perks were pretty lackluster.
---
Perfect man thank you
---
I do this on purpose whenever I want to have fun
---
I make sure they're all on death hook then I chase an injured survivor after i open an exit gate until half of the EGC is gone, then I down them and hook them for a 4k. I love doing this to see who's toxic and wants to teabag the killer and who isn't. 
---
Because im at relatively high ranks everyone wants to teabag the killer so this strat works 80% of the time, even though it's memey
---
Why would a spirit mind game work against a spirit, bro I wasnt aware that there was a killer versus mode...
---
Looks the the inside of a butthole.
---
G r o o v y
---
yeah, i also don't like it. it's a braindead perk imo. its only legit use is to counter the broken god windows but bhvr just needs to get around to balancing that shit soon. please.
---
I just went and watched Legion's Mori and that shit is epic my guy
---
Wonderful lol. Difficult to deal with and buggy. Always makes for a fun game
---
yeah for sure!
---
Show me where I said they better be top notch, go ahead, find it.
---
That's pure bullshit dude. Like playing Survivor is already bring as hell since if you have to do a gen allone for some reason it Tales forever
---
I've had ideas like that. Like I once imagined the endgame screen (where the four survivors run through fog for eternity) get changed to be the campfire and survivors arrive when they escape (i.e if you escape first, you arrive at the fire alone) and people run in from offscreen as they escape the trial, if they do. Survivors who were injured arrive injured and receive care from the survivors. Dying survivors arrive crawling and get helped up, etc. 
---
Killers get a unique screen of them looking out the exit gates. 
---
If a survivor exits through the hatch, they get a unique screen of them falling endlessly through a pitch black abyss. If multiple survivors key out through the hatch than they'll all be falling together etc.
---
So... no Steve and Nacy cosmetics?
---
Second roommate here, watching this happen live was so great. Boi had the dumbest shit-eating grin on his face.
---
The worst part is like Remember Me, the obsession now is no longer slowed for repairs, sabo, etc. so if you let the obsession lives they get everything done at normal speed, but if you kill them your perk shuts off.
---
You implied it in your title
---
I don't really agree with that imo but I guess kinda.
---
Couldnt you also have overwhelming and unnerving presence next to thanatophobia?
---
I'm just looking for an excuse to poopoo on furtive chase because its existence pisses me off
---
In b4 theres this same thing but its Nancy willingly popping haunted grounds
---
This needs a Dying Light icon too.
---

What did they change
---
It's a post for fun you asshat, enjoy the funny moment and go on your way. It would be a different story if I went "WAAAAHHG DEDICATED SERVES ARE TRASH WAAAAHHHHH". Fuck off man.
---
They are in the PTB tomorrow!
---
yeah, that's just dbd. i know at this point what i'm getting into and have accepted it haha
---
Yeah I got this like a million times lol, but I never run decisive strike
---
Plus, I love diversi√≥n too much
---
read the sticky
---
Ok.
---
I really made you mad didn‚Äôt I?
---
The btw is a dbd meme you spaz, it's a JOKE
---
Signed for the holy cause!!
---
What platform
---
You‚Äôre very angry over a misunderstanding aren‚Äôt you?
---
Would give the game a needed fresh and modern look honnestly.
---
Thank you my brother!
---
PS4
---
Wounded Healer, Medic, and one other that I can't recall.
---
Think John Carpenter would be down? I've seen Big Trouble in Little China, guy must have  a sense of humour.
---
You have to unhook others. Even still. It's not hard to get at least 2 stacks even on the worst of games, which is 50% more bloodpoints
---
(‚ï•Ôπè‚ï•)
---
Only no they aren‚Äôt brand new, we‚Äôve been testing them since April and they‚Äôre suppose to come to live servers by the end of summer which is in 20 days. I always stand up for bhvr but let‚Äôs call the servers what they are, dog shit, unacceptable, barely improved from the first test, and extremely disappointing. Check yourself before you call others a dick dumbass.
---
Because they adjusted a different achievement/trophy, as well as the fact that the trophies have been bugged for months and still haven't been referenced as "known issues" by the devs.
---
I think the toxicity comes from the fact that they have a bigger community, so the ratio of Normal to Toxic is bigger
---
I think they should have empty logs by the fire instead
---
Ah yes, I forgot that replying to someone with anymore than 1 sentence makes me mad. Or did you just bring up me supposedly being angry cause I made your point invalid.
---
I wish we had actuall shadow men that watched over us like how tje crows do
---
Man, I spent so many bloodpoints in his bloodweb to realize he's not for me.
---
Maybe you are a Doc main at heart, though! Best of luck, keep us posted.
---
Fat yellow one...
---
New killer: The Minion‚Ñ¢
---
The nightmare shadows scare little Feng min more than the killer
---
Not fuck it up actually, it's pretty nice.
---
When you hook people that aren't your obsession, you gain a token. For each token, the survivors get 3% penalty to action speed. You can get up to 9 stacks, 11 if you get decisive striked by someone and the obsession switches to someone else.
---
While being the fastest? I dunno what character you use but I'm always feral frenzied (Point blank to ensure a hit) followed by him chasing me to a spot I can't easily escape from, getting close-Missing point blank (usually with the cooldown for missed) and tunneled. Like zero interplay, He sees me and follows at the speed of legion. S tier is high for my list though
---
Using meme wrong boi
---
***Oinks intensifies***
---
Piggy and Huntress for me, but mostly piggy. 
---
Piggy is just fun all around. Sure, some people hate her, because bad pig players use her ability to camp. And honestly, can't blame them, but playing against a good pig is a lot of fun, but rare (for me at least)
---
Her dash, even a bit situational depending on the loop, can make for some fun mind games. Her stealth feels fun to use and not super limiting if used well. And I just love her aesthetics. I seriously want a black coat cosmetic for her. Like the one John Kramer has.
---
Like Pig, I love the Huntress' aesthetics and ability. I am not a fan of slower killers, but with the Huntress it feels nicer due to her ranged attack.
---
I actually bursted out laughing at this one üòÇ
---
I feel like there should be a tier for ‚Äúmisunderstood‚Äù between ‚Äúevil from vengeance‚Äù and ‚Äúasshole‚Äù. Characters like Michael, Clown, and Bubba aren‚Äôt assholes; they just either don‚Äôt know better or are mentally unwell. Michael lacks empathy, Bubba is forced to kill by fear of failure, and Clown kills because it gives him a sense of empowerment because he‚Äôs felt powerless his entire life.
---
You literally keyboard warrior‚Äôd me and got all defensive when someone had a different opinion than you
---
no Adam clothes RIP
---
Why would you ever have the lights on in that case?
---
I think it would make more sense if killers could see better in the dark but not survivors.
---
That would be the trade off.
---
Throwing in more interaction with the map for strategies sake is a good idea though.
---
We'll get 2018 before shirtless myers. How the fuck did this even start?
---
When will the Demogorgon be added to the PTB. I already know it's coming tomorrow, but is there a set time?
---
You get another useless thing that has a chance to replace something worth using in the web.
---
i want Asylum Ash with sock ashy slashy hand
---
Today was just testing the dedicated servers. The Stranger Things stuff is tomorrow
---
I‚Äôll double check the trophy lists in a moment to see if I can spot a problem.
---
monto, noob3, puppers, tru3; and their communities tend to agree. 
---
and those are just the people i watch.
---
Just don‚Äôt zoom in the on the mouth
---
It's more so the angle that bothers me then the mouth
---
Indeed. Though I never ran any of his perks. I just main him because I like Evil Dead, Bruce Campbell, and I wanted to reward BHVR for shelling out the money for likeness and voice acting. Though I can't help but feel I get targeted for my P3 Ash...
---
You‚Äôre probably right, plus their native recording feature records game chat meanwhile the same cannot   be said for Xbox so it‚Äôs easier for them to showcase the toxicity.
---
what is the new staus effect?
---
As a Nurse main, yes.
---
Considering nothing changed from the first time we got to test dedicated servers back on Plague's PTB, the hope for improvement is pretty much lost.
---
I mean, another useless thing makes the 2 items worth purchasing even less likely to spawn, so in a way it is a nerf.
---
&gt;Nevermind the fact that you get up to 4 perks in the web now!
---
That's a change for everyone, not a side specific buff.
---
They reduced the radius of the perk, at most it'll work on two, more often than not one though. I think they intended for this interaction, except for Pop still being usable, and nerfed it accordingly.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt have friends
---
They could just take out some of the railing
---
Wounded Healer at 0.1% earned (PS4) despite being out for months. The only other 0.1%s are the Huntress's 100 24m hatchet downs and Left Behind.
---
I can't okay survivor if it's not SWF because I can't stand solo queue because I'm only rank 15 atm. I really only play survivor when the boys is online. Otherwise I stick to killer, which I'm decent at
---
This is making me lol in a place I really shouldn‚Äôt be lol‚Äôing in... lol
---
Ptb?
---
Many of them are actually fucking sick. But I dont know why but almost All of the killer perks seem way too OP for me.. Maybe because im a Survivor Main but idk
---
I didn't believe them for one second when they said that they were coming this summer, especially with all the inconsistencies that I've seen when the servers have been in use. The devs are notorious for missing their deadlines. People just seem to become oblivious to that fact when they announce DLCs and all.
---
oh yeah not actual legacy obviously. it could really be just a small thing
---
Yeah looks like I'm gonna have to learn a diff killer from now on cuz my huntress was my only red rank skill killer
---
VERY important knowledge, especially when you‚Äôve got sensitive ears
---
 I was there 3 years ago when it happened. You could explore the outside map due to zero collapse.
---
The bug hasn‚Äôt stayed for 3 years, it WAS FIXED.... BUT CAME BACK
---
You got one, at least.
---
The thing is that there's no reason to see the aura of the obsession to know whether or not they're in a chase since the entity's legs that show who's the obsession twitch when they're in a chase
---
I mean if you care enough to see other survivors' auras why not just use bond? You get to see everyone and if you become obsession you don't lose the ability.
---
&gt;and certainly better than the key's other survivor tracking addon.
---
How is seeing 1 person all the time better than seeing all 3 people whenever you want/need to? Slap beads on and you get bond as long as you don't spam the key all the time.
---
I‚Äôve always wanted them to add more general addons and the like.
---
How are you even getting access to the perks
---
Bouncy castle
---
Now is clear for my ttv=mori
---
I want dad-bod Ash in his wifebeater.
---
Thank you
---
&gt; best strategy is to just stay hidden when she has her power
---
So if anyone happens to be hooked and then she grabs her power, just let that person die or reach struggle?
---
So ummmm.... Where's this dedicated server list that was supposed to come out? Is Australia/OCE in it?
---

---
It is the best strategy, because you nullify her extremely strong power and are still able to do gens instead of just hiding and doing nothing.
---
This is not an unofficial rules type of thing, it's just playing smart so you don't get your teammates killed.
---
That would indeed be groovy fellow Ash brethren
---
thanks automod but its not a support post :)
---
what this man said
---
There's a MOBILE VERSION??
---
I checked wounded healer and I scored that one on 4/20 (airhorn intensifies) but I‚Äôd suggest just trolling with NM and Botany to fast heal people. 
---
The Huntress one I will never be able to get cause I‚Äôm a shit Huntress and don‚Äôt play her.
---
Yes absolutely.
---
Lmao, I've seen plenty of "ToXiC kILlEr" memes.
---
Once again, you're pretending that they don't exist for the sake of being able to complain.
---
There's no survivor rule book, and there's no killer rule book, stop making shit up.
---
Oh my god that‚Äôs literally all they had to say. -_-
---
Didnt wanna leave him a chance, huh?
---
Im so happy &lt;3 now me and my terrible friends can continue to die together :D
---
as close as you can get to object without running object
---
I don't know why, but that would look like a fun game mode or something.
---
All 4 members of Legion vs 4 survivors. Maybe not with doing gens, but with something else.
---
I personally like playing more as Quentin; I'm not very good at escaping the killer when I get caught. Being able to consistently find good medkits and open the exit gates faster is more fun imo tho
---
HAVE SOME FAITH
---
They will remove this
---
spirit because she can do nice mindgames
---
Okay have fun with your shitty opinion
---
If Dedi servers actually fix hitbox registration at all huntress will drop to bottom tier killer. 95% of the time hatchets shouldn‚Äôt hit imo.
---
Dlc as in licsenced?
---
Duel wielding and two left hands?  
---
Micheal is hanged man confirmed?
---
Throwaway account bait? Yawn. Next.
---
Don't diddle kids it's no good diddling kids!
---
Looks like something out of a shitty mobile game
---
You *only* get paired with a small minority (around 16%) of the playerbase? Yeah I highly doubt it.
---
And while you're doing that, his three other survivor pals have already finished the gens, opened the gates, and are getting their daily set of squats in.
---
Congrats.
---
Omg It‚Äôs the gray guy from Danganronpa
---
Myers, I love playing him and I love his perks and how good he is with them
---
Nope because they go for the teamate on the hook and then I kill them all.
---
My body is broken and mangled, I've gone mentally insane, I'm bleeding everywhere, my body is exposed, oh and I'm CURSED AND BLIND
---
I like pig mainly bc she has a lot to offer, stealth, no terror radius, lunge attacks, traps, etc. It offers an interesting and new game style every time you play
---
I‚Äôm not sure which ones are all licensed but I mean the following ones:
---
Ghost Face
---
Plague 
---
Legion
---
Spirit
---
Clown
---
Nightmare
---
Cannibal
---
Shape
---
*Demogorgon*
---
(Already have the pig)

---
The beads will run out. This one does not unless you're channelling another aura. Keep in mind the bar filling before you see anything counts as channelling, so every time you use it it wastes more and more power. It also frees up another addon spot on the key for you to use a weave/glass, so you can actually use it as a key. No range limit either. It also directly counters the new dying light, which may or may not come to be useful.
---
If it's on a green key, then sure, the gold tokens better.
---
Ah, I see, you're a rank 15 then. Explains a lot.
---
I mean yeah, but really all you did was trade her range ability for her basically being tier 3 myers at that point. Also to clarify, I don't mean exclusively hide, work on a gen obviously. Idk I also don't really have problems nuking her vomit. Crouch at pallet loops, run around L and T walls. Cleansing against her isnt a bad strategy. I mean i can see why ppl bitch not to though but I'm just saying it's not the definitive best or only strategy against her.
---
He‚Äôs worse than bill
---
That build would encourage tunneling. You‚Äôd hook someone, obsession changes to unhook so you go for the guy who got unhooked.
---
I don't even know how the ranking system works in this game but I'm a rank 20
---
I‚Äôd like to, I really would. I just can‚Äôt, it saves me from the disappointment down the road.
---
Shirtless Myers is in Tahiti
---
Oh sick I just prestiged :(
---
Battletoads
---
I think they've hit all the good ones. I'd be very excited to see something original at this point.
---
Kill Your Friends, you can use all Perks there
---
I know for sure I'd rather have this addon than a rainbow map, a ultra rare key, odd bulb, and even the syringe considering the styptic agent is usually more than enough for most scenarios. The only ultra rare worth getting over this would be bnp, and thats a stretch because instructions + spool/swivels are usually better.
---
Most enjoyable - Pig, Legion and Hillbilly
---
Least: Clown and Doc
---
What power would they have?
---
Yeah don‚Äôt cleanse unless you NEED to. And by NEED to I mean that everyone‚Äôs broken and someone‚Äôs getting patrolled on the hook or you‚Äôre dead on hook. But if you REALLY need to cleanse do it as far away from gens that aren‚Äôt finished yet as possible or as far away from the Plague as physically possible and don‚Äôt do it multiple times a match you‚Äôre just essentially turning Plague from a joke to a wrecking ball.
---
I have a dream that my fellow toxic gamers will be able to forfill their dreams of playing as Shirtless Myers in DbD.
---
I have a dream today!
---
IS and HS, and go afk for a 4k.
---
You can't under certain conditions. I know for certain you can't get a stack for WGLF if you have the endurance status effect (under BT or MoM)
---
From what I have seen they dont want to add anything that can alternate the game to much. New items would be nice since the green key is virtually useless and they nerf flash lights so hard
---
Definitely, I love their original stories like Anna and The Legion.
---
Shape!
---
My name is outlined in gold so I don't know if that's a good or bad thing but personally I don't care because it's soooooo much fun to annoy these loopers that boast about their looping skills on their steam profiles.
---
Leatherface, and you get Bbq and Franklin's Demise if you already don't have it.
---
not really a franchise but I really hope they come out with some sort of spider-queen or something as the killer. I also hope they find a way to make the game scarier, cuz for anyone who's been playing for a while, this game isn't scary anymore
---
It should be a rare or uncommon addond, broken keys are pretty much useless atm
---
Wow you‚Äôre so cool, congrats
---
I wouldn‚Äôt call it a balanced race. Killers are faster than survivors. I don‚Äôt think this perk encourages slugging any more than the fact that hatch exists already does.
---
They run into a sprint and full on deck the survivors
---
Yeah MoM is garbage. I bought Ash on sale but alas, mettle of man was already sent to the tip, I've only ever gotten it to work once too. They really should've just made it so you're broken for 60 seconds when MoM activated, or at least work with safe unhooks and not just body blocking. The killer can also see their aura once they're healed after it activates. 
---
In any case, I could see it as being frustrating as getting hit through vaults when I've vaulted from the second floor and am already falling, yet still get hit through the window, sent to basement, and die, when that could've been avoided entirely if the bullshit lunge didn't teleport the weapon through the window and halfway down a storey
---
Lmao yeah
---
Ah, the good 'ol days... Remember the weird broken minigame that you had to do to get beta keys?
---
What.. where did you see this info
---
Well no, obviously go in for the save just like with any other killer. Her puke isnt even that hard to juke and other than the range whats the difference if she can hit you down in 1 hit or vomit on you twice? I get its easier to run around a killer w/o range but if you dont cleanse you are basically playing against infinite tier myers really(minus the few small buffs he gets to lunge and vault speed). Personally, as I said I don't really struggle to juke her puke so 2 hits are better than 1 imo. I dont think either strategy is horrible though, it's just a case of pick your poison
---
How the frcik does that happen
---
Stacks how?
---
Can't wait to find you in a game and see you try to loop me all game but then get mad when I kill you and stab you repeatedly on a hook.
---
Very healthy game mechanic with plenty of counter play. Fun for the while family.
---
If you've never played PWYF wraith, you totally should try it! A ton of fun!
---
Yh that could be really cool, i could see her power being like maybe a massive cobweb that she can spew out and block hlways and doors, definitely food for thought
---
Ok. We won't need to reload the PTB will we? I mean like going back to the live servers and back to the PTB again.
---
I'm guessing someone along the lines of huntress with status add-ons devour hope at 3 tokens and slobby butcher?
---
That is not at all how thanatophobia worked prior to the changes in 2.6.0. Survivor action speed was reduced by 6/9/12/15% depending on how many were injured/hooked/dying. It was changed so for each dying/hooked/injured survivor, action speed was reduced by 4% up to a max of 16%.
---
The ptb just came today, and the new killer is coming tomorrow, they wi not make a bloodhunt this weekend
---
I would love to see this, I think the backstory of the killers would be my preferred initial focus(namely Billy and Huntress).
---
you go to rank 9
---
I am confused. Why are they like that?

Man I would love an Evil dead chapter, I love Ash and I could defiantly like the town where he grew up in to be a map
---
My game disconnected right at the results screen of my killer game. Didn't keep the bloodpoints unfortunately.
---
I dunno I'll dodge some swf lobbies just cause I'm looking for a lower stress game, and for lower skilled players it can be really disheartening to get blasted. I agree and feel a bp boost or atleast the knowledge of a swf group in lobby could be nice.
---
Have you ever ducked at a loop? Or juked  at a L or T wall? Or 360'd when she tried to puke on you? She can literally only puke on you if she has LOS. She also slows down slightly when she charges it up. All I am saying is it is not 'definitively' best to just not cleanse. It seems different people struggle with different things honestly
---
Now that‚Äôs cool
---
Man the locker perk is sick that could actually be really cool.
---
I hate being a poor console player but college ain't gonna pay for itself
---
hatch now spawns when there is one surv left. the gen requirement was removed with EGC.
---
looks fake it looks like the spirts ring add on
---
It's funny how every looper I come across has the same arrogance and none of them can own up to the fact that they are being annoying as hell doing it.
---
Without blood and the head being removed it looks somewhat silly. Still great animation tho, just missing that +18 element.
---
Jesus Christ that‚Äôs why I said fucking ‚ÄúNEWLY‚Äù prestiged key word being ‚ÄúNEWLY‚Äù

Yeah, I love the huntress‚Äô and Legion‚Äôs backstories.

---
Nerf decisions aren't made based on the community dude.
---
Bamboozle is a shit perk because pallets have less counterplay than windows and you deny windows with it
---
Yeah the other survivors have really basic stories.
---
If he didn't pick you up, you'd be dead.
---
only reason i didn't instacop the new outfit is the hair looks so wack
---
Come to think of it, I'm pretty sure 100% of the damage we took was from the chainsaw. I don't think he used his normal attack at all.
---
You‚Äôre right, it done by the people who created no mither and the original Deja v√∫
---
Unlucky. The amount of toxic players in this community never fails to surprise me ): Better luck in your future games!
---
Have you seriously never played a video game with a friend? The purpose of SWF isn‚Äôt to give an unfair advantage, that‚Äôs just an unbalanced side effect. People just like playing games with their friends, it tends to be more fun.
---
I can't figure out how to link my Xbox account with DBD on guilded. Any advice?
---
They made a while ago and OCE wasn't in it
---
Maybe you could hide a DS with it??? Maybe????? But that'd also rely on someone else bringing an obsession perk, or for the killer to bring an obsession perk, but you can't rely on either of those scenarios when this thing is a red add-on.  
---
This thing is beyond useless.
---
Lol I just saw a bill in my lobby and thought if they were gonna do anything not original I'd love to see something Like a witch, hunter, shit even a smoker, from left 4 dead.
---
Lmao i see them taking a step up in the games visuals. Seeing as they modeled and entire new skeleton they probably went ahead and added new assets
---
I mean I understand it, but i still don‚Äôt think you should DC from it. If I‚Äôm getting face camped, I just stick it out and buy time for my team to do gens. The longer he sits at the hook, the more points he loses and if your team is smart, they all get on different gens and punish him for camping. You can buy so much time for your team and punish the killer hard for camping if you just stick it out. Just don‚Äôt let it get to you. I mean, it‚Äôs frustrating so I get just wanting to go to the next game but I‚Äôd rather punish the killer by allowing my team to get work done.
---
Oh!! That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre doing. I always figured they just wanted to be annoying. Makes more sense haha!
---
Well I just bought the shape so I‚Äôll definitely give it a try once I have the perk as a teachable!
---
I would love a series or movie based on DBD but not sure how they'd go about it unless they focus on the backstories? Not sure if I'd want Netflix to do it tho...
---
I smell a meme format
---
if only you could rip their heads off..
---
But it makes it easier and encourages/endorses the current SWF system that totally throws the balance off of games.
---
Literally any survivor &gt; Quentin
---
Legion is a really fun killer to play if you enjoy a faster paced play style. Also they‚Äôre a beast for bloodpoints, you‚Äôll get a ton even without BBQ :) They are pretty low tier, but that doesn‚Äôt matter as long as you‚Äôre enjoying the killer you‚Äôre playing. I‚Äôd definitely recommend
---
Looping is a game mechanic. It is intentional. It's obvious you don't know shit about this game. Play something else and don't ruin actual players game.
---
I think lagswitching would freeze ur character. But then again the last time I had lag switching was in Halo Reach so I may be a little rusty on how that works
---
i dont insta dc i just dc before he gets the last hook cause sac is worth the most bloodpoints and contributes more to pips, still waste his time, and hopefully he doesn't pip off of it as well.
---
Entity displeased
---
I dont strictly hide, only if she is near with her power. I'm pretty good at dodging her puking. She is good at effortlessly infecting things, I never cleanse immediately, pretty much finish a gen and then go cleanse. I'm not saying it is wrong to just not cleanse. All I am saying is people shouldn't get salty if other people do, it can be just as effective honestly. Legion is another story, I won't heal against legion unless I have a good med kit. SC is way to long to heal a lot, but since his base speed was buffed to 115% he is as fast as a standard killer and it is fine if people heal against him imo, but only if he actually commits.to chases, not those legions that smack, then onto the next with there power
---
Wow i don't know the artist who made this ace but congratulations to them i guess
---
(Also i always check ttv Just to have a little chat)
---
Screw dedicated servers, screw toxic players, and screw having laggy matches! Thus is where it's at fam
---
It might just be me but this has been happening for me for about 2 weeks or so now! (XB1)
---
It decreases your chances of being the obsession so that the add on isn‚Äôt useless
---
I‚Äôm a console player, we play on what we can :)
---
If looping is an intended game mechanic then Ghandi is a fucking rapper, I'd love to see any official word from the devs on how they intended for you to go in circles doing the same maneuvers every round. I'm sure I'll get a response from you next Christmas
---
Right! Hopefully it will change once it is released publicly.
---
Where's this mans frontpage?
---
What they should do is allow people to cash in items. Even if it‚Äôs just 1 bloodpoints per item. Allow me to cash in the misty offerings for 1 point each. I like when my offerings and items and add ons all look clean with stuff I like using, I‚Äôd like to just get rid of stuff.
---
I feel they must at least give extra no for 3+ swf players but if there are other ways to counter it that makes sense that is good
---
Extremely bitter players like you always make the DBD experience so much funnier :D
---
Is that real?
---
Legend says Meg is the greatest player of Sports Balls of all time, she really does make the ball go.
---
u/vredditdownloader
---
Yea plus it would give survivors way more hard time to loop they'd have to adapt on the fly instead of oh time to just run this loop and drop the pallet.
---
Well, hopefully you bringing it up will lead to bhvr making it so we can choose which perks. Thanks for posting this!

Arrogant loopers like you that are so overconfident in their abilities to do the same dogshit maneuvers every single time and then end up ragequitting when they actually get killed ruin the game? Kind of speaks about the age range of most of these loopers.
---
3 stacks of the perk at level 3 means you gain on survivors twice as fast. This cuts chases more than in half because things like vaults extend chases and, because you can  close the gap quicker, they get less of them
---
It's not a terrible idea.  SWF do tend to have more communication skills than Randos
---
September 17th. 2 tuesdays from the start of the ptb. Assuming they don‚Äôt deviate from the norm.
---
It's true!
---
Ruin would like a word
---
Vore
---
I feel like a better way to counter it is to just raise the BP gain on what ever side is being played less. Like if there are a shit ton of killers making lobbies (like during double bp) then survivors would get a BP boost. I just think there shouldn't be a way to tell if people are swf or not, you can't nerf swf/remove it bc then the game will die
---
Ruin + Haunted Grounds = Damned if you do, damned if you don't.
---
You don't understand how it is to be a killer. We deal with so many toxic assholes that we just end up giving everybody the same amount of disrespect so we can see their true colors after the game ends.
---
Definitely need more Evil Dead rep. New costumes for Ash (His knight get up with Army Of Darkness, Asylum Ash, maybe the Biker lookin' Ash from when he married Candy.) Any of the demons would be cool killers.. Maybe Ruby or one of her Demon Spawn or Baal. Elk Grove is begging to be a map with gens in places like the bar, the hardware store/it's cellar, maybe the highschool. They could do such cool stuff with the series and I'm more then grateful for Ash being added it's just a shame it was only him. Also Rick Grimes survivor and Jason with Tommy Jarvis survivor and Camp Crystal Lake map.
---
I know what you mean. I a little ocd with stuff like that. Like how in some games you‚Äôll get something new and that ‚Äúnew‚Äù sticker is beside the area. I have to go in just to get rid of that, bothers me. Same here. I get items that are useless to me I just wanna get rid of it.
---
The current implementation of a SWF system is completely unbalanced in the survivors' favor. It's impossible to deny that. If it's not survivors giving a play by play to each other, it's using low ranked friends to smurf lower-ranked, easier killers. Blocking the killer's perks until all are sacrificed is really the only counter to SWF that the devs have given killers.
---
She finally looks normal and doesn't have pasta hair.
---
Nah, Michael's not misunderstood, he's **legitimately** the personification of true evil. He might not even be human. (Talking about the original timeline.)
---
The game is all about looping. Just watch any match of this game from decent ranks and you'll see. Camping is just a way bad killers get kills. In red ranks all gens will get done while you are camping and you'll get 1 kill.
---
Sure but maybe an actual gameplay solution would be better than a clunky system.
---
it's the lack of the dark thin hairs that used to be there

***P L E A S E***
---
Aren't generators the things that make electricity?
---
Why would they add looping there if it's not a game mechanic. There's no point in arguing. Enjoy being an asshole.
---
yeah i just lost all my shit though and i'm tight that i might not be getting it all back
---
So you're just chatting with your friends on comms and not telling them the killer's every move. You seriously don't think that gives you an unfair advantage?
---
Thanks, **I HATE IT.**
---
Tbh, reaching Rank 1 is kinda pointless. There‚Äôs no reward, no bonus points or shards. Just... longer wait times and more toxic people. Anyway, congratz.
---
Feng‚Äôs is most definitely a convention goer outfit. I‚Äôm a nurse and can‚Äôt imagine ever wearing that on the job, lol.
---
Yeah you're right. My bad.
---
They didn't add looping, dipshit it was something the players came up with from the mechanics of the game, they allowed it because it wasn't an exploit but I'm pretty sure that even the devs think it is a dick move.
---
That's literally what I'm saying and getting downvoted for. ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Don't head shots one shot now?
---
Because people in this game expect you to do things their way 100% of the time
---
No it makes it 18+
---
Hatchet chapter, anyone? Victor Crowley as the killer, a bayou map and Marybeth as a survivor. His power could've something to do with his overwhelming strength. Maybe somekind of rage mode? Could be cool.
---
Also me and my friends have been toying with the idea of adding Darth Vader as a killer. Could have an indoors Death Star map with a trash compactor vault similar to The Game's pig vat room. Also Luke as a survivor. His power would of course center around The Force, force pull for example. His mori would use his force choke. Would be cool.
---
I have no friends ............
---
Trash b8 from a trash killer youch
---
wait the hatch can be blocked now?
---
I'd say usable
---
Way to over generalize
---
Hell yes, it's about damn time.
---
aw hell yeah
---
I was just like you. I played for a year and a half as only killer. My answer: absolutely. Survivor is a very stressful experience at first, but you‚Äôll slowly see the fun and beauty of it. Not to mention the super fast wait times. Also, I suggest you play survivor to analyze other survivors. If you can learn what a typical survivor does and be able to read your opponents, you‚Äôll be a far more formidable killer.
---
No, they just ran out of time just as they got to it.
---
He also gets off on nearly making people commit suicide, just like he did with Bashurverse
---
Ak 74u
---
That can actually give them a chance of escaping if their team has bt, but youre on yellow ranks so i doubt they have It often
---
It's funny how loopers both go in loops with the same insults and they go in loops when they are in a game but when they are in a game and when they are in an argument they still get salty when they are treated like shit  for their shitty tactic
---
I like Demogorgon‚Äôs mori but I‚Äôm sad they didn‚Äôt include decapitation :(
---
Then I'm the almost impossible man I guess :/ Tho I even ain't that good as a killer
---
Whats wrong with facing the poor clown? It‚Äôs not like she‚Äôs even that good :(
---
YESSS!!
---
I‚Äôm a Pig main and I do neither. Maybe it‚Äôs just the ones I meet.
---
They said in the stream that the numbers were subject to change. also, just because they look weak doesnt make them weak until you play around using them
---
This game is not all about looping, just like camping looping is a shitty tactic that terrible survivors use because they can't win any other way.
---
aww look at her cold, black, emotionless eyes. really portrays her.
---
Shitty tactic yet its the best way to avoid taking hits and keeping the killer occupied, as someone who plays both sides you‚Äôre salty, bitter and the arrogant one, your salt b8 is low effort and we‚Äôve all seen it before. Now if you want us to come up with new tactics to slam you then come up with something else to whine about, gg guy
---
huh.. i dont see a body it just really looks like the hatch was blocked or something
---
Even if it was something players came up with, it is a core part of surviving now. Loops in this game got nerfed countless times and yet they are still in the game. It's not impossible to counter. 
---
If you want more proof it's a game mechanic, watch the dev stream of the bedham preschool map rework, where they made the loops shorter but more frequent.
---
Steves scoops head would of been a funny sight lol.
---
Idk about graphical limitations, dev limitations maybe
---
They‚Äôre playable right now in KYF.....
---
Makes sense, but I‚Äôm looking at him from the perspective of the first movie, since that‚Äôs the Michael we see. It‚Äôs also a debate of nature vs. nurture. Was he always evil, or did his upbringing and failed treatment make him evil?
---
Pwyf is underrated holy shit
---
Its not hard to invite people off of a friends list. Its not hard at all. Its simply annoying. Nobody has ever said "Wow I hate inviting my friends maybe I should just play alone." Its literally how the game is that swf will communicate. Theres no way to stop it. If you're gonna cry about it just dodge the lobby when they join.
---
Yes, they can't win any other way because THERE IS NO OTHER WAY
---
Spirits tunnel, they dont camp
---
He was still using it on his stream for most of the night haha
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure he meant misunderstood in a loose context - Michael is mentally ill, and due to the treatment he received in the time period of the movie, it would only have made him worse - he lacks any form of empathy; he is definitely human, just mentally ill - unable to tell the difference between right and wrong; thus - the loose term of misunderstood comes in.
---
It honestly looks terrible.
---
Never thought this would come
---
Oh. I was unaware of that. What does the key do?
---
I also hope not. I can imagine some of these killers with legitimate short stories from Netflix dedicated to their characters and backstories.
---
And that proves what excalty? KYF isnt a good place to acaullty 'test' how well they work in a real match, espcially around rank 1
---
OINK
---
:( When I point I don‚Äôt mean you have to leave, I‚Äôm just taking a jab at you for messing up. But if you mess up more than twice then yeah I‚Äôd prefer you dip lol
---
I don‚Äôt think they ever did but it was just my best guess
---
Should be as gross as Hag's is. :(
---
It was simply a reply to you saying they‚Äôd need to be used first.
---
There‚Äôs a know bug that occurs that will make you lose any progress made during a play session. You need to send a support ticket. They will ask you how long you played and reward you bloodpoints. I don‚Äôt think they can restore your rank though.
---
She should at least be in ‚ÄúEndured unspeakable hardship and torment‚Äù, I mean her father did fucking fruit ninja her mother and then herself, and she was promised vengeance and seemingly never gotten it; thus forced to kill for the entity.
---
Im not quite sure either. Normally with lag switching, you'll be sucked back a few feet. You can usually tell when they are because it wont happen unless the killer is losing lol
---
About a week, then a week with no ptb, then the dlc is released. Somebody correct me if I‚Äôm wrong
---
r/speedoflobsters
---
This is great for deaf players
---
Yeah, I meant from the first movie too. He's just straight up Evil Incarnate, it's why Loomis tried keeping him locked up for so long and keeps talking about how he is just straight evil. I think he was just born with that "evil seed" inside of him, honestly. For some reason. He's purely and simply...[ evil](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Blq11wjG30).
---
adept is when you use the the killer or survivor 3 especific perks. To Achieve adept, as survivor you need to escape. As a killer you need double pip.
---
Darn so there‚Äôs seriously no way to actually stop it? That sucks, but thank you for the advice
---
I don't think the majority of players are what this subreddit would call good :)
---
When you think you escaped by the entity is a sore loser.
---
You look just like my old anatomy teacher.
---
Lol you're a rank 20, only people you're gonna come up against are casuals who just bought the game.
---
The shadow guys are 100% just placeholders - it‚Äôs the PTB; it **will** change.
---
I don‚Äôt like it!  They‚Äôre weird and scary!
---
Not gonna lie. Sometimes I'll give the hooked survivor an extra smack when I get them on the hook if they popped my ruin or fed me a bunch of pallets
---
I always saw Michael as human-*shaped.* We can never really tell if he **is** human or not. That's Carpenter's intention. He looks like one, but no human can take as  many bullets and brutality as he has over the years. Even in just the first movie, _any_ human would have died after five (or seven?) times then falling off the second story of a building.
---
Do bones
---
Rip Carl the Cashier, gone but not forgotten
---
Dedicated servers also makes it harder/impossible to recognize swf groups since you're likely to get placed into a lobby with four waiting survivors and unless they're meming characters/usernames it's not obvious.
---
Given Demogorgon won't be most likely play tested until next week, it's safe to assume the 23rd might even be when everything gets released. This a bigger update than the rest, and everything is trying to be securely tested. At any rate, it should be this month and hopefully, everything works out.
---
Try that on red/purple ranks. Lol they'd get ya while your attack is on cooldown.
---
Game was meant to not have a party system. They said they implemented it afterwards and it was the best they could do with their setup.
---
Epic Prank.  
---
Force them to wait 6 months then don't give them fixes to latency issue
---
They need to be tested in a real game
---
Yeah, more like:
---
   
---
Killer:    
---
Survivor: ‚ÄúDishonor on you, dishonor on your cow, dishonor on your entire family.‚Äù
---
Thank you! That's pretty short, honestly. I play rainbow six and their test server is 3 weeks.
---
But SWF could run it. One guy could run this and be the designated hook rusher. Just like how in current SWF play there's a designated guy with Head On.
---
Tch, rank 20, you‚Äôre the lowest rank out there, no wonder why you can‚Äôt stop loops, delete this game and leave this subreddit and the community will be a little but better
---
Prepare for the toxic boyos
---
it‚Äôs much easier to spot a moonwalking killer than an invisible killer. If I believed they were even remotely similar I would agree but it‚Äôs not true. a moonwalking killer is nothing in comparison to spirit phasing. moonwalking killers depend on high walls and must do it properly for it to work. Spirit just roams invisible it‚Äôs not hard to understand
---
Looks ridiculous...
---
Yep checks out, thats accurate!
---
I don‚Äôt see how KYF couldn‚Äôt suffice. Even if it didn‚Äôt, I was still just staying the fact that they are playable.
---
With lagswitching in this game, you got frozen in place and can't do anything.
---
Demogorgon is supposed to be play tested tomorrow assuming the dedicated server play test goes well today.
---
..and what does not having to reinvite anymore have to do with that?
---
Wow the demigoron has so many sounds holy moly
---
Very interesting, thanks for sharing!
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me. I had WGLF stacks too but i ended up not receiving blood points and i lost two pips. I kept my item tho but i don‚Äôt even know what happened. This happened on Friday.
---
I hope so, the sooner the better, but if they take some extra time to work out the kinks, I ain't even going to be mad. They're doing some real work with the QOL changes this update.
---
In my opinion, the Michael Myers we are introduced to in the first film is not supernatural, inhuman or impervious. He is a mentally disturbed man with formidable strength and a high tolerance to pain - perhaps another mental disorder which prevents people from feeling pain. He was strong enough to uproot a 100 Lbs to 150 Lbs tombstone. He is a rage fueled adrenaline nightmare of a human being. You can also say the mask is the source of his seemingly fearless and ferocious nature. When he is unmasked in the first film, you can see the terror wash over him as he struggles to get it back on. Without the mask he is nothing. The mask frees him.
---
No it doesn't? The comparison would be if NOED activated when there was one survivor remaining. Left Behind only improves your odds in a 1v1 with the killer, NOED improves your odds even if (and especially if) all four are alive.
---
Pretty sure that, if not something very similar happened to me. It's a 10/10 perfect game. No bugs
---
Press Triangle to pay respecta
---
IT'S ABOUT FUCKING TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Mm, interesting way of thinking about it.
---
WHAAAAAATTT ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME HOLY SHIT
---
IMO Alert is still better as it will trigger tons of times while Dark Sense only 5.
---
Lol same here but yellow, incomplete perks, no add-ons and offerings. Getting looped by skilled players sucks it forces me to facecamp just to sacrifice ONE. Even then, facecamping vs. Reds or purps is hard, so run doctor and use treatment mode, then spam the shock input and grab saviors quickly while they are unhooking (don't get faked).
---
Can anybody put the steve and Nancy audio on YouTube for people from mobile?
---
Yeah but they also said that wasn't finalised and said last week that a final list will come out this week... I hope enough of the OCE player base voiced outrage that after allllll this time, we can only connect to Singapore at best.... Hopefully it will be enough to convince them that an OCE server is essential
---
What about the people you met along the way?
---
Imagine a mini series with each 30 min episode dedicated to the backstory of a killer(I find survivor lore uninteresting personally).
---
Watch Jake bust through the concrete fondation (also nice flair)
---
That‚Äôs fair, I‚Äôm glad it worked out for them
---
Tysm!
---
Also that suit in the picture collage reminds me of Austin Powers
---
Yeah, it really sucks when you already know a game is over with before it really starts because of your team. But I‚Äôll send a game inv anytime I‚Äôm on, 2 competent players can even carry games. Also I run BT, DS, Adrenaline and DH, most games anyway. 
---
Getting on now too if you happen to see this in time

Hopefully they do the same for you! Good luck!

They didnt like him enough to not abuse him constantly though
---
we still dont got dedicated servers........
---
I‚Äôm so sorry
---
Well, that is our basic disagreement then. Not much else to discuss.
---
Hadn't heard about the Bashuverse thing but holy shit. He did something similar to an older guy who streamed on Twitch. Keemstar accused him of being a pedophile and the old man got so much hate that he stopped streaming. Turns out Keemstar was wrong and the old guy got bullied because Keemstar is an attention whore.
---
piquer
---
Is there hair physics for Laurie now, similar to the non-licensed characters?
---
Thank god
---
The tonic spam. Like the ones that aren't accurate and just throw tonic everywhere.
---
It would of been in the patch notes
---
He obviously has eyes, it's just not shown because he has that weird shadow people get in movies where it only cover a bit of the face but not all of it.
---
17 is to low to reset, 16 is the lowest rank that resets if I recall correctly
---
Why is that surprising?
---
Every survivor has their teachable perks show up in their bloodweb when they reach level 30, 35, and 40 respectively for their 3 unique perks. For example, when you reach level 30 as David you can buy the teachable version of We're gonna live forever. Teachable perks have a chance of showing up in other survivor's bloodwebs.
---
I recommend the perk spine chill, it lights up when a killer is looking in your direction and can help you avoid them.
---
I didn't notice either, I'm hoping now other killers have interesting animations and it isn't just spirit with a cool hatch close lol
---
The Entity enters thru the hatch 101
---
&gt; Maybe you could hide a DS with it??? 
---
DS does that anyway. 99% of the time another player spawns as the obsession who doesn't even have DS.
---

Aww that‚Äôs so cute, i love it! Please send me a message if you start selling them, I‚Äôd honestly buy the whole set. :)
---
Do whatever you want. I dont tend to do it and I'm a hag main, but that's because I prefer gen control over hook control. Survivors may frown upon it, and even I know it can get annoying from my time assurvivor, but it's completely fair. Dont let anyone tell you otherwise
---
I mean... just do it the way you want to do it.
---
There‚Äôs never a right way to play and people will always hate. Just do what‚Äôs fun for you. 
---
But if I were to say it‚Äôs tunneling.. eh not really. Besides, they can counter your traps so it‚Äôs not your fault that they don‚Äôt ;)
---
I think it was "okay" at best. Like, God forbid survivors actually get a decent perk.
---
Probably 8am PST and 11am EST tomorrow morning.
---
Oh look a hatch!
---
*Asserting Dominance tier 3*
---
Get over yourself! Everyone here on Reddit has just as much right to an opinion as you do! If you don't respect said opinions, then fine, but don't talk shit about other people or their opinions just because you can!
---
Yea pretty sure thats it
---
There's much worse examples of matchmaking, red survivors vs. purple killers is the norm.
---
I would assume he needed the chainsaw daily and most likely doesn't care to actually hook you guys. I've done it a lot when I've gotten 3 killer dailies and need to get rid of one.
---
It frustrates me to hell and back to get hit by it, but there's nothing wrong with it, you're just playing the character optimally and anyone complaining about it is usually in the heat-of-the-moment rage (also why there's DCs.)
---
It's frustrating but not frowned upon. Complaining about hook traps against Hag is like complaining about Hillbillies using the chainsaw to get instadowns.
---
I recognize this user has made a decision, but given that it‚Äôs a stupid-ass decision, I‚Äôve elected to ignore it.
---
Called it the day it was announced.
---
All the possible ways they could alleviate the grind a little, and they choose the ONE way that still fucks us over.
---
2 perks one the bloodweb*
---
*But you can only get 1 good one and whatever trash the entity forces you into.
---
You better not buy that jigsaw offering.... lol
---
You can also get teachable perks for survivors you own and don't own from the shrine for 2000 iridescent shards which you get by leveling up.  The shrine changes weekly.
---
ok
---
It's been an issue since the last Dedicated Servers PTB. Can't believe they didn't come up with a fix for it considering how game breaking it is.
---
I want your entire stock
---
Where are Jake and David outfits, BHVR?
---
rank 10 two pips
---
I thought these kind of posts are banned.
---
Have you like, read the auto mod that messages you each time? We are not the auto mod, we can not help you.
---
As if SWF needed another buff. Typical Devs, no idea what theyre doing.
---
They should increase the number of nodes you can take before the entity starts.
---
Make it just enough that you can reach 2 perks, then both the others will be taken at the same time.
---
We wanted to be able to put builds together faster and not have to spend hundreds of levels to secure perks, why lock them behind more bullshit RNG where it isn't possible to get what we want from a bloodweb?
---
I‚Äôm not sure, seeing that I play pa4 and can‚Äôt even play the ptb, but I heard the hatchets might (accidentally I assume)  be effected by noed- idk mind, but that may have been the reason
---
I remember each time they were asked about this they would give a different excuse as why this couldn‚Äôt happen
---
Quit embarrassing yourself! I see who you really are, @Freddy.
---
Same brother you‚Äôre never alone in this community.
---
It's being discussed in the patch notes thread, that's stickied to the top of the sub.
---
After matches, but not after getting dodged or dodging a lobby yourself? I think the latter is the more annoying one, when you have to re-invite over and over while lobby surfing.
---
finally a p3 that doesnt have extremely small amounts of blod
---
That is amazing.
---
This has been my biggest complaint and to finally have this is perfect
---
Could be a bug.
---
solo queues get screws
---
The game is now balanced the way it‚Äôs hella difficult (but, to say the truth, that much enjoyable) for solos and easy as goo for SWFs. :(
---
While you didn't exactly explain at all what the joke was I finally got it. It's because one of the wheels are always bad
---
actually it counts towards pips as well. look it up
---
Encouraging Try hard with friends. Fun
---
Lmao what??? I play both sides equally and survivors have plenty of great perks.
---
I'm fine with the balance of the game for the most part. I do about 60/40 solo/swf. You need a very strong rando team to win at high ranks for sure.  But when you do it's very enjoyable. I mean killers are supposed to be the dominant one.
---
You're confused. You die on the hook when you're the last survivor alive in the match or if it's your third hook, or if you don't struggle. If a survivor is on the hook and dies while you're getting hooked then you won't get to escape/struggle depending on how long into the "dying" process their animation was.
---
Only took a few years!
---
While I agree the Legion‚Äôs lore is more so ‚ÄúFrank‚Äôs Lore‚Äù  
---
imo. Frank‚Äôs troubled upbringing is what lead him to become a delinquent/murderer, Julie is just madly in love with Frank and is will to do anything for him, Joey I think had always been more likely to bouts of violence but I think Frank was his catalyst (as well as getting fired), and Susie was the naive girl who followed her best friend into the wrong crowd and didn‚Äôt know how to get out.
---
I think Frank and Joey both fit in ‚ÄúAsshole from day 1‚Äù and that Susie and Julie would have their own tier of ‚ÄúForced/Manipulated into murderous acts‚Äù Wraith could probably fit there as well.
---
What's hunt mode?
---
at least it's unique and dynamic unlike just a solitary throat slash i.e. the pigs mori
---
Dedicated servers have made her more consistent to use and fixed the hit boxes kinda because of the servers. She‚Äôs now definitely S tier in the right hands, but it really just depends how well you can aim, she has a huge skill range.
---
You haven‚Äôt unlocked them yet
---
Oh man, do not say such things in this group. Downvote patrol is coming.
---
Isn't that the same as being broken and getting downed in one hit though? At least by cleansing you don't leave a trail and make a bunch of noise
---
dude I need one of them
---
Demogorgon looks like it wants to speak to the manager.
---
Myers was the og head tilter
---
You can use them in a custom game
---
You will after a few month of not playing. Happened to me. Then I wrecked all the people at rank 19-20 and felt bad
---
Ehhh seems like most agree so far.  But in the end that's just facts on what happened.  Not even stating an opinion. 
---
Besides internet points are internet points lol.  Thanks though.
---
Yea just lil bit:)
---
I hate going up against trappers
---
Pffft we all know that identity v is clearly the superior one
---
I fuse my lvl 10 Shape with my lvl 40 Wraith what persona do I get
---
OMG. Best update ever.
---
My friend got reported for bodyblocking windows as billy cuz "bodyblocking banned" lol
---
I mean I guess it‚Äôs tunneling if you go for the one who got unhooked other wise no not at all.
---
I don‚Äôt have Bubba, nor have I bought it from the shrine of secrets
---
Actually, if you have better connection than the killer, it‚Äôll favor your view point over there‚Äôs, so if it misses for the better connected player, than it IS a miss.
---
when it opens up its flower head thingy.. its designated as hunt in files.. usual walking has the flower petal thingy all curledup .. I suspect it unfurls in chase..
---
The problem I see with your build is you invest too much into the endgame. There‚Äôs 2 problems with this
---
The first is about ranking up. One of the most important things you need to do to gain a pip is to slow the completion of gens, only one of your perks does this (SB) and it‚Äôs not going to be enough when you start to rank up. My recommendation is to remove remember me, and try to level another killer like nurse, leatherface, hag or legion to get a good teachable perk.
---
Your second problem is with Noed. Noed is a really strong perk, but believe me, if your Noed totem gets cleansed, your entire build will fall apart, and since you only have sloppy butcher for the mid game, you‚Äôre going to have a bunch of hooks to get to sacrifice people.
---
TLDR: don‚Äôt run remember me, it‚Äôs not very good, get a different teachable to help with mid game.
---
well heres hoping they put in an outfit or something lol
---
I tend not to but if I lost the one who unhooked the survivor I will go after the one who was just unhooked
---
