Hello there!
---
---
---
Iri heads are basically common addons at this point. The same thing is happening to me lol
---
You would have died anyways
---
He was jokingly blaming the hit on you for not joking the killer successfully. He was fully aware you could have done nothing. It's called sarcasm.
---
That is the counter. You hit the unhooker. You now have 2 injured survivors and can choose one to pursue resulting in a hook. What other counter do you need?
---
Nah, You can't go thru the exit gate with an activated BRT, but you can go thru the hatch.
---
It's pretty funny how you've defended it.  Wow, look how dumb that made you look.
---

---
It's also pretty funny watching you go through the stages of denial, acceptance and now anger.
---
Oh god no I hear it enough in game I can’t take any more
---
a way to get actually get a down when youve taken one surv hostage in end game collapse
---
The Friday the 13th game would have a hissy fit and getting the rights for him would be an absolute pain in the entity’s asshole so I feel like it won’t be possible but that’s my take on it.
---
Fucking love that theme
---
I’ve had wait times like that at rank 10. Usually a good 10-15 like you’ve said. But sometimes I still get placed with yellow ranks, both sides are getting longer q times but killer is worse
---
To be frank at high levels (Not even that high) you always get one ultra rare node (Sometimes even 2) per bloodweb. 
---
Since moonlight offerings are no longer a thing, for killer this leaves ultra rare addons, DLC killer splinters (Which stop showing up once you get the Myers, Pig, and Leatherface DLCs) and Ebony Moris. 
---
This means Nurse, Billy, and Leatherface get an ebony mori every bloodweb and can easily hoard them.
---
Keep poating these, maybe the devs will see
---
Makes sense
---
The legion, specificaly susie
---
As a killer, I urge you to continue giving the free hits. If you know the killer is nearby, just stand still next to the exit, don't T-bag and just allow them to down you. If the killer is not nearby and you have no reason to stay, just leave.
---
There are killers who really apreciate the free hits survivors give
---
SURVIVOR SQUADS ARE ACTUALLY CANCER
---
I JUST WANT TO FUCKING PLAY THE GODAMN GAME AND PASS SOME TIME AND THOSE FUCKING ASSHOLES KEEP APPEARING GOD
---
YOU PLAY WELL THEY FLAME YOU YOU DONT THEY GO TO YOUR PROFILE AND FLAME YOU WHY ARE PEOPLE SO GARBAGE IM FUCKING RUNING A MORI EVERY MATCH FROM NOW ON
---
Watch [these](https://youtu.be/arEkqdiMKNI) it will change your life (watch all of them there funny)
---
I seriously hate it, so damn cringey.
---
Remind me again why a toxic shitlord that whines like the biggest bitch ever when not being able to bully a lowrank and screams "THIS IS SO OP!!!!" Every time he plays killer is so popular?
---
There are actually people who find this cringy guy funny?
---
1. Some people are competitive, of course they will play to win.
---
2. Just cause you think perks are boring doesnt mean other people do.
---
Youre coming off very biased here.
---
Oh wait, i already know lol, forgot even if i watched them 666 times
---
I sincerely apologize for doing something somewhat productive with my spare time.
---
That reminds me, I just got clowns teachables, then leveled up huntress one time and immediately got pop goes the weasel and that was a great feeling as huntress is my main.
---
Amateur I watched the 69,420 times
---
Yes, because its toxic for survivors to do their only objective in this game. Lmak
---
I'm not even OP dumbass
---
Wut.... fits perfectly, i remember early 2018 in pax they asked to mathieu if jason was coming anywere soon, and he said no, but that he fitted perfectly in the game, btw the 2009 version is a human, see that movie and u gonna love jason
---
Ghostface is now a thing, as we all know. Personally, I would most like to see a vamp from 30 Days of Night, or a good old fashioned werewolf. Maybe a Predator or a Xenomorph
---
I meaned, 666.420.300.069.times
---
You heal other survivors twice as fast for 90 seconds after you unhook someone.
---
I get ebonies every lf bloodweb
---
You won’t this round
---
I'm rather encouraging people to play other perks instead! Ah man you all standing here on the subreddit and strike that poor Ririmo for nothin'.
---
Downvotes are op isn't it man
---
“Toxic shitlord” only for videos lol and I never see him being a bitch and screaming either
---
Ooh, not worth it, CYA!!MEEP MEEP
---
Productive would be doing your taxes, sorting your finances, doing chores around the house, working, exercising... if this is how low you set the bar then you're setting yourself up for a life of disappointment.
---
TOTH on it's own can make survivors paranoid that you have DH, works best on a SWF with voice coms. They'll sometimes suicide just to get the totem
---
Bruh this was the shit XD
---
No u
---
Love both and freddy looks incredibly fun with his rework. I'd go freddy personally but still love myers.
---
My favorite part is when they run object of obsession and expect you not to tunnel them down!
---
Oh, I dont mind. This community isnt always the brightest.
---
r/classicblunder
---
I'm Xbox has a fit when it loads a backwards compatible game then once it loads it goes back to being silent
---
The most infuriating perk in the game....for the person using it. Every time I try the killer gets a free locker grab, even if I do it early.
---
Doctor is great for new players considering how much he slows the game down, how great he is at earning BP, and the fact he deletes stealth from the game. 
---
Also Monitor And Abuse is super strong on Myers.
---
OK you are cringy
---
Just like survivors aren't guaranteed an escape when egc happens, killers aren't guaranteed a kill. Earn it.
---
I would say Jason probably won't be a thing, due to his similarity to the Trapper, but they brought in Leatherface with the Hillbilly being a thing, so idk. Samara, definitely not. Nothing about the way she kills would really fit the DbD atmosphere, and she doesn't run, like, ever.
---
I am getting sooo fucking tired of this game. 
---
Survivor experience : I’m fucking Superman and need to do everything including hooks and gens while my team(if I’m lucky) distracts the killer by getting downed every 10-15 seconds.
---
Killer experience: Always match with a well coordinated team that by the time I hook the first survivor within 30-60 seconds means there are 3-4 gens finished. Even if is stop chasing to apply pressure the loops are too fucking op and we don’t have enough perks or killers who can stop loops, and the ones we do are very few. 
---
I am afraid that if devs don’t fix this unbalance somehow , once dc bans are implemented the player base will get smaller.
---
Ahhhh yes things for a teen to be doing at 3 in the morning I will immediately start filing my taxes while waking my family up to the sound of a vacuum going off.
---
I don't have Freddy, but since you have Ghostface I would go freddy anyway; Shape and Ghostface have similar play styles. Although, Shape is my go-to killer because he's really fun. Plague is another favorite of mine too.
---
I’m gonna guess you only watched 1 or 2 videos of his or your just pulling this out of your ass.
---
This isn't encouraging lol. This is complaining. Nice try tho. If you wanted to encourage you could post and say "hey guys, what if other perks were more meta". Or "hey guys, what if we buffed some weak survivor perks so we see them used more".
---
Leatherface for BBQ and chili.
---
Jesus man get a hobby.
---
It’s DBD....you don’t need much else.
---
He keeps it short,well edited and no Mid-Roll Ads,I say he’s ok.
---
I had an idea for slowing gen progression that I discussed with a friend.
---
So basically, fuel cans are scattered across the map, not too common, but not especially hard to find, and each fuel can can only be used on a single gen, and multiple cans can't be used on the same gen until the other runs out. So basically, each can is worth a gen and a half of progress, so if a survivor hits all skill checks successfully, they'll have about half a gen left. An if the fuel runs out, so progression can be made on the generator until it gets more fuel, so the killer can slow the game down by consistently regressing gens, therefore forcing survivors to get more fuel,wander the map, and give him more opportunities to kill, also, once every can has been used, they respawn, kinda like Plague fountains.
---
This obviously isn't the most refined idea, but i liked the sound of it.
---
Myers. His perks may suck but he’s very versatile and fun to play as! I would also like to recommend leatherface I mean yea he’s not too great but bbq and chili help with bloodpoints
---
If you’re using NOED or if you tunneled me for a good portion of the match, it’s because I want to teabag you
---
So do I
---
General Kenboi
---
I DOWND 2 SURVIVORS AND THEN IN ONE NANOSECOND THEY ALL DISCONNECTED THEN I LOST 2 RANK POINTS 
---
WTF
---
Bbq &amp; chili gives you a 25% bloodpoints bonus for each survivor you hook so if you hook all 4 survivors once you get double the bloodpoints. But if you don’t care about the grind for bloodpoints then I’d recommend Myers because he’s fun and very versatile
---
I love myers. Run the scratched mirror build for some spooks
---
you’re right IMO, i’ve seen a lotta killers DC against me and my buddy, even though we’re both basically braindead and are probably a disadvantage to our other survivors
---
Get a job and save up. Simples!
---
No
---
Promote chases without loops, I mean with more vaulting, stairs, jumps, something like a REAL chase / more action or intensity. Right now they already exist but of course the game promotes to take a safe loop, nothing wrong in that. ( aka: normally the main buildings which survs run arround in circles)
---
Don’t... don’t make me hopeful for a shirtless Dwight
---
Yes they stack
---
Spent all I had on Belle's bathwater &gt;.&lt;
---
Kinda want the Spirit now
---
I'd enjoy this.
---
(Laughs in splinters being bugged and still being accessible if you buy the dlc)
---
Only time a DC is justifiable
---
Very creative! Don’t worry I also lost but I was proud of mine too! The Feng one that won was cool and creative too so I was honestly glad. (Between you and me there was a popular one that was visually boring I was rooting against LOL)
---
Enter giveaways
---
Yeah but that’s in the past, but I will say he is still a little toxic.
---
The Roblox ripoff would probably have better ping and less glitches tbh
---
Did you get them via auric cells? I heard they only stop showing up if you own the actual DLC. I have the SAW, Halloween, and Leatherface DLC and they quit showing up for me.
---
I still have a ton of pig splinters and I like to burn them from time to time because it'll use whatever loadout your pig has (Perks and addons) while making it look like you have a Mori on the loading screen. (survivors still spawn together so it's not a shroud of separation.)
---
Shrine is available to everyone.
---
Bro red ranks have waaaaaay more time to invest and or skill. No one is the same and if we play the game and end up frustrated the fan base will just be red ranks and no one else to support the game.  I don’t think it’s fair for red ranks to just say to get good when they don’t realize a lot of us aren’t willing to sacrifice our time that much or aren’t naturally talented, it sucks but it’s true. This is why game communities end up always harvesting toxicity because the elite players want everyone else to be like them realizing not everyone plays the game to be the best. I think even not making killers loose bloodlust unless he gets smacked by a pallet would be a good idea. But again we are unfortunately the minority on this site.
---
Because Meg and Claudette mains don't deserve anything.
---
Kill her, then sell the water at an inflated price.
---
THIS RANKING SYSTEM IS THE WORST GARBAGE IVE EVER SEEN WHAT THE FUCK
---
Ever since this weeks rank reset every match has been 
---
"HAHA BABY KILLER" when i play something unranked and fun
---
or
---
"I DCED BECAUSE YOU DIDNT MEME AND MAKE IT FUN FOR ME"
---
You get bitched at for playing well or poorly. DBD needs desperate moderation, it feels more toxic than Overwatchs.
---
Claudette is a great first pick for new survivors because of her perk self care, which lets you heal without a medkit. I’d recommend her first. Second should be David king for his dead hard and we’re gonna live forever. Dead hard gives you a tiny sprint burst. During this sprint burst you are completely invincible. We’re gonna live forever gives you a bloodpoint boost when you save people. You can use this to get more blood points for other characters. 👌
---
*failed skill check noise*
---
But everyone needs their flu shot
---
a full video of bad hit detection and memes wen?
---
I don't mind camping if they deserved it. If they're being toxic, get them outta the match pronto.
---
AiNt NoBoDy GoT tImE fOr ThAt
---
I based the number of BPs per level on my own bloodwebs
---
DLC comes with an extra cosmetic for the survivor IIRC, although it depends on the DLC. Jane, Adam, Ash, and Jeff for example have basically slight recolors, (Sometimes literally just one extra cosmetic which is a recolor) while Ace gets an actual tuxedo, Tapp gets a jacket and different pants with no hat, Feng Min gets a casual outfit, etc. 
---
I am not sure if buying Doctor with shards/cells gives you his "Project Awakening" set.
---
God I would hate to be you for a day man.
---
Play any mid to low tier killer without ruin and it will change your mind
---
I play console, so doctor is free. I also already have 90% of all Nea cosmetics, and she’s all I play for survivor, so I don’t need more survivor skins, or more survivors.
---
But wait, we never got an answer
---
How about swf teams force a teammate to play killer and the others play survivors.
---
For example 2 swf no problem.
---
3 swf  one has to play killer.
---
4 swf one has to play killer.
---
Yes it could incite toxic matches but then bvhr just needs to actually penalize people when they get reported.
---
Halloween for Laurie Strode (her perk, Decesive Strike, is one of the strongest perks in the game and if you get tunneled, you can stun the killer and escape and since you're new, you'll get tunneled and camped a lot)
---
this is pretty cool
---
Predator unfortunately wouldn't fit, also the devs behind F13 already have a Predator game in the works
---
Killers don’t care enough to actually try their asses off to win every game, especially with the ranking system being so bad
---
Storm's brewing.
---
If I didn’t have more I’d have been pissed
---
Baby Meg thought she’d pull a sneaky on me.
---
How do you do that?
---
upvote for Ferris Bueller reference.
---
Unbelievably cool, bhvr plz
---
Are you on mobile, cause I have no idea on pc
---
SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY
---
PC
---
Go to the store
---
_Stonks_
---
Ah, dunno but on mobile in the top right corner there's an edit button if you ever go on mobile
---
Yeah but who wants remake Jason.
---
I see, thanks for the help.
---
Np
---
Samination is just amazing... Rule book was a nice way to make fun of
---
S   O   M   E
---
S   U   R   V   I   V   O   R   S
---
Or when you’re getting chased and someone destroys haunted grounds
---
Lol now I want a meme of General Kenboi
---
BBQ and Chilli also reveals the locations of survivors that are a pretty decent distance away for 4 seconds, allowing you to have much better control of the game.
---
Not the worst story ive seen, but I am a sucker for cannibals.
---
Power just seems like a slightly different Legion though, maybe make it a bit different.
---
If they don’t say does not stack they stack
---
I like it. I came of with a few ideas though, if you dont mind.
---
&gt;Gain a token upon hooking a survivor, up to a maximum of 2. When a survivor is unhooked within 32 meters of the killer, lose 1 token.
---
(Since some killers can hide their terror radius, or have very small ones. Ghostface, Pig, Tier 1 Myers, etc.)
---
&gt;When a generator is 90% repaired, the entity will block the generator for 8/12/14 seconds. Affected generator is highlighted in yellow for 3 seconds. Consumes 1 token.
---
Lowered the block times and added the aura, aswell as a token comsumption mechanic, so you have to work for it.
---
Why? Easy BP
---
Thanks, I'll edit it soon
---
It was me ok... :(
---
This has been suggested a thousand times already, just stop. Think for two seconds and you’ll realize this would never work.
---
Honestly so would I
---
Jeez no need to be so rude, I didn’t know.
---
That hasn't been working too well for me lately. I'll stare directly at him, and I still get stalked.
---
The dash is good for mind gaming loops, put yourself between them and a pallet and crouch then lunge and make them guess which way you're going
---
Karma
---
I mean they did nerf DS and made it only work as a anti tunnel perk and then they nerfed mettle to the ground so idk if it’s realy right to use those perks as examples as killers did not get over it they just complained until it got nerfed
---
Clown doesn’t have a single bad skin. His default is great, his Children’s Party outfit is horrifyingly good, the Downtown Fair outfit is cool, Santa Clown is dope and Pagliacci is maybe his best. I am so glad to see that this trend is continuing with... deformed elephant clown? He may not get much in terms of cosmetics, but every single one is a gem- quality over quantity, guys.
---
If you don't want to pay the terrible prices for photoshop you can download GIMP, I've been using it for years now and it's never let me down. It's a little different to use than photoshop, but pretty much whatever you can do in photoshop you can do in gimp
---
Didn’t know about it when you made this exact same post a week or two ago either, huh?
---
How are flashlight blinds toxic?
---
Yeah, I love me some shitposts, but it's nice to get a break from them every so often, and people really do manage to make some incredible things.
---
Yea I reposted because it got deleted, I didn’t know that other people posted it.
---
the elefant on the room hahahah
---
I Love the art design of dishonored &lt;3
---
Imagine telling Michael Myers he can't chase you anymore because he hit you once. Or telling Freddy Krueger that he can't use certain dream powers because they're not fun for you. Or telling Leatherface he has to pretty much leave the fucking farm if he throws you on a hook in his basement. Or telling Ghostface he can't watch you through your living room window because "it's camping!" 
---
If you honestly think that's how any of this goes, you're naive as fuck and this ain't the game for you princess.
---
I agree. The remake Jason is brutal. He also has the bag and hockey mask for cosmetics.
---
Click or hover over your person and M1 or hold right trigger
---
heat vision as a power may be a max oof
---
How do you get this to work with multiple people? I can only ever see my own rotation.
---
uhh, im just going by what they said on stream. So im guessing they dont if thats what youre implying.
---
I’m that last person, sorry guys I always forget or think I already ready up.
---
Thank you! Someone once told me to hold X and move the left stick and I stupidly tried it 🙈
---
To be fair they also said they wouldn't do a clown killer as to not trigger people's actual coulrophobia ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Yeah this comment was inevitable lool
---
Could hurt killer too, killers need to see just as much if not more than survivors
---
You can only rotate yourself- the two Claudettes are positioned like that as part of their lobby animation is to look from side to side nervously.
---
Rin and Len are my favorite!
---
Everything is gross if youre at my level
---
I do not want a demigorgon killer. I’d want to see a killer that isn’t the demigorgon
---
I play on pc :(
---
Yeah you can only see yourself, probably the other two are photoshop i´d guess :)
---
I appreciate the honesty and taking the time to even comment, ty so much!
---
But that's how you do it, at least on PS4.
---
I a LOT of good addons without prestige
---
I... disagree. I’ll get downvoted, of course I will, but Noob’s content has never struck with me and neither has he as a person.
---
If you like winning, play spirit lol. Shes also just super fun to play.
---
Yes, it’s when she gets her corrupted purge
---
The flair is quite appropriate :)
---
I've seen this same post like five times in the past week.
---
pfft it's 2019 who does gens
---
Yes he is
---
I changed the skill check button to one of the controller face buttons since it seems a bit more responsive.
---
Of course the real reason to do that is because when you inevitably have to itch your nose you WILL get a skill check and you won't miss it that way.
---
As long as they don't flat out lie to us it won't be near as bad as A:CM.
---
I'm very curious how they'll handle the gameplay presuming you play as soldiers who can fight back with weapons
---
It's caught my eye for sure
---
There’s a stigma in a lot of subs where if you don’t agree with the opinion of the majority of the fanbase, you get downvoted. A lot. I like Monto a lot, but if someone says that they personally don’t like them, it’s fine. Doesn’t affect me, shouldn’t be a problem. However, I’m glad to be proven wrong in this instance.

Can you guys share a link to the contest or other designs?
---
Same and it's absolutely awful when my WiFi gets interference and disconnects only to be greeted by a jet as I test the WiFi to reconnect it to ease the jet engine that is my MHW Pro.
---
His streams are a lot better then his videos, tbh, he’s a very chill guy
---
You know what. Happy Cake Day!
---
This is barely relevant to the post and seems more like an excuse to brag about your Nurse.
---
WAADSAFLSDFAKDJFSALDN MAKEUP!
---
Like the Killers are any better
---
What else is a Netflix original worthy of being in a game
---
Should have submitted during the competition. Great effort. :)
---
No problem I use her on red ranks just takes patience, good luck.👍🏻
---
Survivor rule book:
---
-Don’t tbag
---
Killer rule book:
---
-No camping (even if all gens are done!!)
---
-No tunneling
---
-No Mori
---
-No NOED
---
-No walking
---
-No bbq
---
-No ultra rare addons
---
-No purple addons(some characters)
---
-No addons at all actually
---
-No using your ability a lot(billy/bubba were looking at you)
---
-If one person DCs, go easy 
---
-If two people DC give free win
---
-Actually just always give free win or else you’re toxic
---
I think that’s the main thing that will separate it from DBD (as it was very hard to not draw comparisons between DBD and F13). The ability to fight back and kill the one pursuing you could make for some very interesting gameplay moments.
---
This is obviously bs if a killer camps every hook their not good, I’m guessing he just R2 all game and missed his hatchet throws? It’s also not hard to play huntress once you know how to abuse the hit boxes coming from a huntress main lol
---
Bring Disordance then, Adept Legion.
---
Kinda getting some zombieland saga vibes, art is fucking sick man good job!
---
I only play SWF because when I don't I feel really lonely.
---
Lol yeah I should probably wait for a few rank resets before I try too much. Plus I'm a doctor main so I'll also have to get used to finding survivors on my own and not just with maddness lmao.
---
Freddy isnt weak tho
---
I hope theres a photo that just shows the top of the ocean and all of a sudden bubbles start showing up. Could end thus meme with "closes hatch in front of you and hooks you". Man I'd laugh
---
REEEEEEEEEEE!
---
I HATE PEOPLE! 
---
AHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH DBD!!!
---
So saying that Omegablink is sweaty AF means they are disabled. Okay then.
---
Yeah I guess I do. At least in the grey/yellow ranks where everybody tunnels you to high hell. I just get frustrated. Maybe I need a break.
---
Yea you're right, but at least you tried :)
---
Oops, I must've forgot! We're supposed to hide for as long as we can, take the hatch with 0 gens done, and say "GG ez, baby killer &amp; trash teammates."
---
For PS4, that’s how I do it.
---
Oops
---
Weak ass eyes
---
Legitimately the best post I've seen on the reddit. Bless.
---
Myers got the mani-pedi done.
---
And he can be called out for his hypocrisy, what's there so hard to understand? Damn, his fanboys really are the worst.
---
*insert first time meme here*
---
Laurie chode
---
I mean, this is my opinion but Camping is only necessary when things aren’t in your favor. You could either camp around the hook or slug some Survivors to buy yourself time and apply some pressure. BUT! if you camp straight from the start of the game, you’re just wasting time and not getting any bloodpoints. It’s a very controversial method but effective.
---
I have pc, Xbox, and PS4, and I can safely say that some games are better for console, some are better for pc. it really doesn’t matter what you play on other than personal preference
---
“Snappy Clappy Ankle Detector 3000” 😂😂😂 how about “Snappy Boi”?
---
i actually am! just bought all survivors and my next one is spirit for sure
---
It's on there Twitter if you still need the link I will send it to you
---
Big brain Bubba
---
oh yeah I forgot about console what would be very weird is if they made a daytime map/
---
I think leatherface’s power is one of the most op things imo and a lot of people don’t understand me but I’ve seen the man kill two survivors at one go countless times. That seems so op to me. Lol
---
Well....her Body escaped XD.
---
This was GOLD
---
My take on it as a killer main is this. It isn't fun. Don't get me wrong if someone runs up to the hook I'm gonna follow but standing at the hook hoping someone runs up to save just isn't fun for me. You do you tho.
---
Close the hatch and enable the end game collapse let the timer run to 1/4 carry them and watch them helplessly try to open the gates like rats before getting killed by the entity.
---
GIVE ME CAMERA BOY!!!!
---
Amazing.
---
There was only 3 gens left and they were close together. At least all I saw were three gens.
---
my favorite are the Baby Jakes, and Baby Aces......
---
The devs rushed their 2.6.0 Killer Emblem changes thinking that most of them were amazing and the community knew nothing. They only made a small change to the Devout Emblem in case one Survivor DCs. It’s obvious the community does not like the new Emblems, so I’m a little surprised they haven’t just reverted the changes or are taking so long to announce more changes.
---
This is the worst thing I've even seen. Got my upvote!
---
And then again after he was a youtuber.
---
D E A D A R D
---
Oh neat, what's that little red circ- OH GOD OH FUCK
---
Only if he makes a squeaker sound when he gets hit
---
IM SO FUCKING TIRED OF DYING TO NOED WHEN I LOOPED THE KILLER FOR THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME ITS THE MOST CRUTCH PERK IN THE ENTIRE GAME. WHY WAS DECISIVE STRIKE REWORKED INTO A SHIT TIER PERK BUT NOT NOED? FUCKING CHRIST CAN YOU KILLERS JUST HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT YOU'LL END THE GAME BEFORE THE GATES ARE FUCKING POWERED? IM SICK OF IT.
---
Rancor just gives you a free mori.  Thats what its called when you kill someone by hand (not by hook) regardless of if its from an offering or a perk
---
It’s where the killer can instantly down you to the ground with one hit. Can be countered by finding the fire skulls and destroying it OR by steroying all the skulls (5)
---
It amazes me how game devs can’t think of skins that would fly off the shelves. Some of the skins seem flat out lazy. Lol
---
alternatively: oof ow my bones!
---
When you don’t want to try as Killer and you just want a chill game......then you get 360........*Leans forward and start to try*
---
Late post but one of my favorite combos is Black Incense (See auras of people puking, it even shows people who are hooked or on the ground slugged) + an apple. Against "Do Not Cleanse" strat (Which I find stupid) this will lead to massive amounts of salt.
---
Break everyone, grab the super-puke they thought they were denying you anyway, and run around instadowning everyone since you know EXACTLY where they are. On small maps you can get everyone down extremely fast since if they were refusing to cleanse, they're all one-shot and there's no time looking for them. 
---
Post-Game you usually get alot of salt. I find the "Just don't cleanse 4head" thing stupid as shit because if remaining one-shot is preferable, why the fuck isn't the meta No Mither, Resilience, and Dead Hard for faster genrushing at high ranks then? Yes in the end Plague is a M1 Killer but look how often survivors complain about NOED or one-shots in general as well as how strong adrenaline and instaheals are. Survivors *choose* to effectively give you NOED the entire match (Well, they're injured and noisy, so maybe more like give themselves No Mither) and it pretty much bypasses instaheals and adrenaline. 
---
It seriously boggles my mind and I honestly feel like survivors who choose not to cleanse results in an easier time for me since I only have to M1 them down once. I suck at getting hits with corrupt purge. 
---
Do note all survivors have to cleanse or not cleanse. I've also had times where I had 3 "non-cleansers" and one guy who cleansed, and Plague's super puke + everyone else effectively having No Mither = a bad time.
---
Those changes are already in the game.
---
I think it's a glitch, I've seen it before too
---
I saw another post where it happened to another ghostface. The devs need to hire some more people to fix all these bugs. This game is pretty good, but it’s pretty much completely broken.
---
I'm hoping to see alot of 4 man lobbies
---
All versions of big J are affected by the lawsuit.  The lawsuit goes back to the original progenitor, so any derivitive work is affected.  Remake is just as off limits right now as main Jason.
---
It may have been the "glass bead" map add-on.
---
A) I'm a killer main, and you must seem to just have bad luck, as I never seem to get tbagged.   
---
  
---
B) Blinds and stuns aren't toxic. How else is the survivor supposed to escape a chase?   Also gen rushing is just rushing the objective, run anti-gen perks or try to 3-gen. Hell bring Franklin's if you can't handle a pallet blind.
---
   
---
C) DCing on hook only gives the killer extra points, and I'd rather just keep what little points I got.
---
LMFAO i love it
---
The game is broken, not just ghostface
---
Now we're talking. I enjoy that name alot.
---
instead of a bloodthirsty killer he becomes some sort of strange BDSM daddy or something
---
True.
---
He's an old soul
---
“HOUSTON! WE GOT A SOLUTION!”
---
We must cleans the heretics brother.
---
survivors are skins my ass 2: electric boogaloo
---
No, I’m not a asshole, either I come straight to you for a run or I’m quietly working on a gen, in which I was then was chased and tunneled the rest of the match.
---
So is OhTofu
---
There is a lot for me to learn. I barely know what perks are good for killers or survivors. I play the killer more than the survivors. I get a lot of rank 6 survivors as a rank 14 killer so im getting juked out my ass. I need to look for the hatch better xD i got a lot to learn.
---
Take it up with karmacourt if it'll make you feel better.
---
Can other people see ur rotation
---
If you're talking about Tru, I think he just lets them.
---
I wanna say either doctor or wraith. Wraith is a stealth killer that’s job is done better by other stealth killers while the doctor’s ability just isn’t good enough. Players going against the doctor will just throw the pallet down early if you try to zap them. For the most part though killers like pig, clown, plague, trapper, and maybe legion just need quality of life improvements.

---
I will also be doing survivors, along with alternatives for those who have more than one official alt art available by behaviour. Thanks for checking my stuff out!
---
Thank you for telling me, didn’t know that subreddit existed
---
Had this happened to me once I was a Nurse and there was this Survivor downed at a pallet,after a while trying to chase them away,I decided to pick him up.
---
I got a pallet dropped on me and didn’t get Stun,I was like:Your only chance......and you failed  ha ha.
---
Then I realized I was stuck in the Pallet while carrying a survivor”no problem this guy is gonna wiggle and I will be able to blink out of it”.
---
He’s AFK.....I Can’t drop him.
---
3Mins. Passed,luckily nobody did gens because they were trying to free me,one was farming chase points and an other was waiting and letting me hit her for points.
---
When I was about to send a msg to say: well...this is it and leave that Kate comes with a Flashlight she found in a chest,I was like OMG and little while later the survivor I was carrying Dc’ed don’t know if it was for inactivity or because I got free,but we proceeded to play our game.
---
Ik I went with my ball Jointed doll spirit idea but I didnt put nearly as much effort into the artwork. Maybe next time.
---
Can he have one of those masks with the zipper mouth thing? it could work.
---
I have all the killers and STILL get Freddy offerings.
---
that’s what i’m here for! you should check out the amazing things they are producing over there!
---
monto’s newly edited version lol
---
Yikes
---
You ever have any survivors start working on a gen you're goofing around at?
---
would he not be justified in being angry.
---
Interesting new idea for new offerings.
---
Clever
---
[removed]
---
Noob3 the absolute legend
---
God damn i was on my toes watching this shit.
---
Well now I see why there are 3 disconnects
---
Camp maybe don’t go to the hook! Salty survivor
---
Playing as Wraith and using the bell to invisible could be pretty fun, especially using the add on that makes the survivors not be able to tell where the ringing sound is coming from.
---
Great original meme!
---
If you T-Bag while waiting for the Killer to break the safe pallet then it’s Toxic,but I’m with you Normally it isn’t toxic and a great load of points+making a chase last longer if the Killer isn’t a Sound-Killer.
---
That's the other uncle
---
Spine chill should help you a lot with this problem. Also use exhaustion perks like lithe, sprint burst, and balanced landing to increase your chances of escaping a chase. 
---
If you can play with some friends, make sure that y’alls have borrowed time too. Very helpful for campers. We’ll make it also creates much less crunch time for heals.
---
Dead by daylight: no
---
Dead before daylight: no
---
Dead by roblox: Y E S
---
I’m not saying I’m good by any means, but I’ve found if you pull a few good runs at avoiding tunnelling or a chase goes for longer than normal some killers get camp happy... It’s annoying but I’m a team player and if they all realise they’re not getting me off, I see it as time not wasted if the team does Gens.
---
Really?! I never got in to watching watching his videos. He did this to people?
---
Honestly, it's not too bad. The only things that really need improvement would be to make it look more like he's gripping the knife and to make the blade longer.
---
50% movement speed boost is extremely overpowered... it’s a free hit every 30 seconds. 
---
Jamming exit gates is extremely overpowered and makes him even more overpowered against low rank survivors. 
---
The gen pop reveal+3 perks idea is bad. You basically sacrifice a perk slot for a worse version of bitter murmur.
---
Also you said killers luck is greatly increased... I don’t think killers even have a luck stat. They have nothing to do with luck.
---
I do like the idea of survivors getting worse items from chests... I feel like that could be a troll perk, not a killers passive. 
---
Is the “additional skill check” only for survivors on gens? Not that it really matters since skill checks are very easy lol. If they fail the skill check they were already revealed to you, so all it would do is a tiny regression on gens
---
—
---
I’m gonna have to pass on this one
---
“Even though they are strong, they are really boring.”
---
Exactly how I describe nurse, barbecue and chili, ruin, etc.  face it, no one’s putting themself at a disadvantage for the 2 seconds wake up takes off the gate
---
If I'm killer, I put on a mori when they don't ready up. Otherwise, I put up a bloody party streamer or Gruesome Gateau. It's all up to them..
---
Just checked your other one, I definitely think this one is a little more polished but clearly you are talented so keep it up.
---
Killers dc too
---
I believe dropping a pallet without looping or stun and just teabagging like your the dope shit warrants a tunnel and camp, reward toxicity with toxicity!
---
Watching some of his recent videos from the past few days you can tell it's starting to really piss him off. Of course they rarely survive but it's ruining the experience for him and his audience and the devs won't do anything despite it being extremely obvious they are harassing him. I think BHVR is being willfully ignorant on this whole "how can you prove they're stream sniping?" nonsense, I highly doubt these people are able to guess his build and killer every match and somehow get it right every time.
---
I see you can also have another account on psn and practice that way of course BP won't account to your main but I definitely recommend branching out from killers I use to be a hag main until I found the beauty of add-on dream transition Fred and Nurse.
---
I’m a proud Canadian now, blessed with knowledge.
---
Just something I thought about after fully realizing _none_ of them have their own themes when every Killer after v2.0 got their own themes. I know these will never happen, but I just thought it'd be fun to see (or hear).
---
Check my profile I posted all of them
---
It would likely negatively affect console performance.
---
Sometimes, its worth it though. The people with high ping get ever higher ping whenever they interact with an object.
---
I'm Xbox but yeah I didn't even think about Smurf accounts. Guess I won't have to wait lol
---
Yes, he’s that much of a cunt
---
Don’t forget urban evasion with nea. When I first stared stealth was my only way of avoiding the killer. That combined with spin chill made it great for staying alive long enough to do objectives.
---
Yeah, sorry but this is one of those "Just because you say it doesn't make it true" times. Relying on camping as a strategy is for new killers and toxic killers. You're making it less fun for everyone involved and it's not even effective on top of it.
---
Thats my line!
---
yeah ive been scared? of this i guess so ive been baiting pallets to get rid of them early on
---
I swear, 80% of my games...theres always that o e guy...
---
Haven't had any issues with getting insta lobbies as a survivor on PC this evening
---
Yeah, I always "search for game" then get up and go do stuff around the house until the sound in my headphones indicates the game is starting, at which point I sprint back to my PC
---
i mean... they can still get the license, more hard to get it, but they absolutly can, i remmeber on a morf stream, peanits was there and i asked him if is posible to get Jason, and he said nothing is impossible... soo we'll se then...
---
I wish Jane would stand in the lobby with this view
---
david is so hot. i’d do things with him.
---
Been messing around a ton in VRChat and trying to reenact some memes I like. I have 0 editing skills so I didnt want to touch it ;-; I hope you guys like it.
---
You forgot the part where you can be staring right at him at an open area and it won't reveal him.
---
They are simply not good at the game. Unless all gens are done then they are securing final kill
---
Apparently from other comments, no. I have almost 400 hrs in this game and never knew you even could rotate.
---
Don't try it.
---
Thank you.
---
Id be confused and scared if i say that in a trial. I just imagine instead of a heartbeat for terror radius its Jpop instead. Yea im looking way too far into this
---
if it was also making a noise, it was a map marker called glass bead.
---
&gt;killers complain about survivors
---
&gt;game cant exist without survivors
---
Logic 100
---
For survivor or killer? Survivors usually get games in 5 minutes or less.
---
OK then IDK who you area
---
Well it is. There is no casual mode. That’s why we get pricks that face camp and teabag. If a Casual mode existed most face campers would go to Comp.  it really sucks that you really can’t go and meme if you are in high ranks.
---
Play KYF
---
Put on Freddy with fast transition add-ons
---
Put on Rancor with no other perks
---
Find the obsession and follow them the entire game
---
As the door opens sleep them, one hit them, and mori them
---
You lose but it’s hilarious, the first time.
---
WHEN I BLOCK SURVIVORS AND KILLERS THAT ARE TOXIC BASTARDS, I EXPECT TO NOT PLAY AGAINST THEM, THANKS.
---
I'm pretty certain, because the times it DOES actually reveal the survivor, it's the one behind the wall.
---
I think there should be no gates and only the hatch. It only opens when one survivor is left, and keys have a 70% chance not to work.
---
Man i didn't know you could get DC tokens on the bloodweb
---
Okay truth but killer sees hatch where I’d like he is ROBAMA with see the hatch
---
Solo is usually fast. And they are working on fixing / updating Match making to be faster and better
---
Actually pretty ridiculous tbh
---
Ha... one of my rules. If it gets down to 10 secs the mori goes up.
---
Face campers and teabaggers would be in both modes without a doubt
---
yeah i tried to make a pink and white like a finger nail but the pink was a bit to bright and the white was mixed with blue from my sisters so yeah and ive actually made that joke to my dad a bunch
---
I think there should be two hatches, no exit gates. That way bad killer game is 2 kills so they don’t feel that bad. Good killer game is 4 kills, average game is 3 kills. Good system with fair even scale between good/average/bad
---
This is one of the reasons why I hate selfcare!
---
True but if you’re that sweaty you prolly take yourself seriously so *most* of those people will go to Comp. Teabaggers will stay though. That’s just part of the game by now and it doesn’t matter too much if at all to me.
---
*protection points intensify*
---
I'm 42 and my 16 year old son got me hooked on it haha. I play survivor and he plays killer..
---
Get it and all dlc while on sale. You will pay about the price of the game and have everything. Buying dlc from the store also unlocks an additional cosmetic for each character. If can't get them all Leatherface if playing killer for his perks.
---
Play as each killer so you know how to counter them as a survivor. The experience as a killer will allow you to understand their mechanics so you can better counter them.
---
You do get tips for other Killers, haha. I promise you, I've put more than enough time into the game to know. :Smile:
---
Just rotate her.
---
They are new hence why they camped not a excuse of course but they are learning
---
Herman Lerpiss as a killer skin, tho.
---
I really like Zubat and Otz. Otz really nails the educational aspect and I love how he uses non-meta perks in such creative and effective ways. Zubat nails high skill plays across the board ranging from mindgaming to understanding map layout.
---
It's not about making it harder, but making the game last a little longer by having more than just doing gens. The games can go by so fast and if the killer picks one bad chase and do a few mistakes here and there it will cost him the game in matter of minutes. Then he will complain about "gen rush" in post chat and then on Reddit, but the fact is the 3 other survivors did the only thing they could do and thats repairing gens. 
---
If they were to add more things for survivors to drag out the game a little more they also have  to do something about the hooked survivors. 
---
I wouldn't mind if they gave hooked survivors more time betwen phases, and also stalling progression if the killer is x meters close to the hook if he is not in a chase.
---
And yet she's still in the game completely untouched.
---
I still find it amusing the first DLC they ever made was a killer that literally negates the entire game.
---
where does this come from?
---
Are there any DLC killers (or expansions) that you particularly recommend?
---
Yeah thanks
---
Thanks
---
Leatherface, Pig, Ghostface, Ash
---
Jeff and legion are cool both are connected and then clown has a cool background pretty scary stuff
---
Yeah not enough room poorly planned it
---
There should be no hatches and no exit gates. All survivors have to die and are only their for the killers enjoyment.
---
Tammy one as the nurse and Tammy two as the legion
---
They aren’t going to do this.
---
yup
---
This isn't even good bait.
---
Yes!?!?!
---
My experiences are bad. It's worth literally giving up the chase at some point just so you can get hooked then unhooked and hopefully get to repair a gen so you can at least get one pip. That's not good design.
---
I honestly think they should add The Saw theme when the survivors have to scramble to remove the head piece, like start the countdown when it activates , it’ll give suspense during the time.
---
Key as well, of course
---
what is wrong with people like this
---
Or as pig crouch no terror radius no bt
---
And at third prestige, she’s done it three times.
---
Ur rong. Their should be no exit g8s and no hatches at all!! If am killer I should kill all! 🤓 killer man big Brian.
---
It's sarcasm, not bait.
---
Wait he is from Canada ?? I didnt know that lol
---
That cat is my spirit animal
---
The fuck are you on about, its the same thing
---
Yeah In my fishing box
---
My favourite one is where you vault and keep running and then you're back behind the window running into it getting bitchslapped
---
Nice job claud squad
---
Nice one!
---
The best time of year
---
How dare they recieve free BP!! /s
---
Why should killers make that distinction? The game should reward survivors who do enough but still get sacrificed. You're only sounding like you want to get treated as a child.
---
See, that is the problem. I also think that if you see the guy have a horrible team, they can be let go. But back to the main point, paying attention really is the only problem.
---
Every single fucking game
---
Jane is ready to fight.
---
Can a killer distinguish the potato versus the trying hard? I usually can only distinguish the nice guy versus the toxic bitch (but I'm a main surv). But, at the end of the day his objective is killing everybody. Wanna live? Deserve it.
---
Format please!!
---
Wow TBH that felt like an actual saw scene due to how close the ending was thanks for the link
---
*complains about someone not readying up
---
Doesn't do so and just stands and complains* /s
---
pretty much just me panicking everywhere and somehow losing hillbilly
---
Don't you dare
---
Yo how tf do I get purple Lightweight? On every survivor I have it on yellow version for 2 seconds, I would use it if I could get the max 4 seconds. My highest survivor level is 50
---
You know, you can draw on the canvas with pencil before hand, to plan out the painting
---
play more
---
ahahaha someone seems to have hurt you.
---
Sometimes. EA is from Canada
---
Literally the worst bug in the game, as the killer with decent perks maintains a natural advantage.  Why cripple the survivors more?  It's not like they have much of a chance if you know what you're doing.
---
Rule 3, boss.
---
Why would you ever make me look that up
---
Im sorry but his name is literally ice. You would have to scroll through thousands of profiles to find him. I didnt even give my rank so you could scour through profiles to find him.
---
I like Monto and DamnNoHTML
---
I noticed this when using the red and purple addons for Ghost Face wondering why this aspect of his addons weren't in the description.
---
Random, you're pulling numbers out of your ass on how long it'll take normal players to reach whatever desired perks they want. 
---
Point of the progression system is to reward playing. You just want things faster for no other reason than just because you don't feel like playing as much. 
---
Guessing you didn't take in the daily missions, offerings or certain perks into account that make getting BP so much faster? Oh your post didn't even mention it because then your numbers might look off. Also a suspicious lack of details like how long it'd actually take to get all the perks, you only mention the amount of bloodwebs which is nearly useless information given your suggestion.
---
Say 1 level for 1 moderate killer game game. 1 game on average is 8-10 minutes. You can gain 6 levels an hour, and that doesn't include perks, offerings or dailys that would deeply cut into that time. Very very easy
---
180 divided by 6 is 30. So 30 hours total to get all killer perks in the game. Couple hours a gaming a night would get you there in no time. All the while you're progressing towards rank 1 where you aren't playing against maxed out SWF squads every game and won't need all the perks.
---
Because this is a rank 20 game? If you try face camping at lower ranks, you'll get punished.
---
I’m sorry but it’s in the rules. Nobody is exempt, especially when your entire post is after game, no value to the sub, salt.
---
Sure. I just love getting exposed every single corner I take. And of course get mori’d. Tunneled, camped. Get punished for removing totems (wtf?). As long as the killer is having fun massacring us. Fuck me, eh?
---
I actually want this wtf
---
The killer is supposed to try to massacre you, and you guys can play dirty too like shine flashlights in their faces and circle a billion times and all that shit
---
With their free time, not with the time they use to be productive. You realise you can have both? You don't have to be either 100% slacker or 100% workaholic.
---
Productive at 3 am would be to sleep so you can do that when you wake in the morning, if you do.
---
What perks were you running?
---
Spirit fury enduring (didnt get to use it), bbq, and ruin. Ik very toxic.
---
Love. It.
---
I'll wait for the mods to decide my fate.
---
Oh I use the same build but I use whispers instead of ruin
---
Yeah if you're in the middle of nowhere and the killer baits it, but good survivors will use it to reach a safe location like a pallet or make the loop last longer and the killer will just have to take it. That's why it's one of the best perks.
---
Yeah I feel kinda bad for her
---
Rancor is more annoying than NOED, change my mind
---
More like rank 12 almost 11 lol
---
I Bought Mine Day 1 And Its Quick And Quiet
---
It's not toxic to do gens. That's the point of the fucking game.
---
I disagree with disappearing traps when someone disarms them, that would make the iridecent add on useless
---
But spam is delicious. Just posting some moments. I'm done now.
---
We’ll act like it. You’re spamming the feed on new for basic stuff that happens. You’ve posted about 20+ times within the past half hour.
---
2 its ok 3 or 4 its pain
---
You gotta have a super good los blocker when you use it. Otherwise its like D tier.
---
Pig. The saw series is my all time favorite horror series.
---
I mean, with Lithe it isn't that bad.
---
Seems to be from [here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Art/comments/ceszst/mine_digital_2018/)
---
It's a very recent submission to that sub.
---
As if flashlights were easy to use. Anything else is probably more beneficial. And looping is definitely easy with hatchets getting thrown at you. Spirit going invisible and the nurse teleporting 5 times in a row. 
---
The game was fun when I started with my friends. We got our shit kicked in, sure. 9 times outta 10 we lost. But we still had fun. Now every game they’re running ruin, nord, mori’s and other game-fucking shit and people justifying it going “it’s your fault you didn’t remove it” as if the killer doesn’t patrol over the one thing they can’t win without.
---
This game has many flaws and I don’t know why I play this piece of shit. But here we are.
---
Fair enough.
---
Same and I’ve been loving here knew weapons
---
Now I see why people were complaining about you spamming.
---
Is this a forum for people to post highlights and discuss on the game? I thought this was America. I do apologize for the "spamming" I'm done now, just enjoying the "polite" comments rolling in lol
---
Spam. That’s all I will say.
---
thanks man, im ok, just stressing over wor--WAIT WHAT IS THIS SKULL
---
Lmao exactly I’m sure he runs meta kills perks. Might even be a NOED “skiller”
---
Man are you always a piece of shit? If this person is a teen, having hobbies is cognitively beneficial, therefore productive over all. There is no reason for the bullshit you spewed on this thread. What a buzz I'll really
---
 No my post didn’t take them into account because I didn’t consider them, not because it made my numbers look off, you seem to be getting upset by this if you’re starting to assume things like that. Again I don’t want them fast, I’m suggesting we should rework the web since it’s going to get even worse as time goes on. Also you didn’t take into account queue times and how much longer it gets the higher your rank.  Hell neither of us are even considering events, new killer release que times, offerings and all of that so of course we’re just ball parking the time. I’m still waiting on literally any reason to not rework the blood web you keep repeating “you don’t need every perk” or “it doesn’t take that long”. I don’t understand why you’re getting so heated over cutting some slack in the grind especially when it’ll just get long again to the point where this conversation will happen yet again
---
Please tell me they died.
---
I got it [here](https://wall.alphacoders.com/by_sub_category.php?id=228280&amp;name=Firewatch+Wallpapers&amp;page=2) I think, but you can google "Firewatch wallpaper" and your screen resolution for a good selection.
---
just keep walkin' like nothing happened
---
To be fair you do flood the feed with a fuck ton of clips
---
He literally said he’s a teenager and it’s 3 AM. It’s summer, the fuck does he need to be doing at 3 AM if he doesn’t want to/can’t sleep?
---
Holy fucking shit, his profile when you go to posts.. A video aprox every 2 mins
---
Then idk, people dcing for no reason sucks. But I have seen a lot of people leaving matches because of face camping tonight.
---
i actually love freddy’s laugh
---
I'm really not. His "rework" seems extremely overly complicated, is a mish-mash of other killers' powers and there's nothing really unique to Freddy there anymore, and none of it matches his theme of tracking, stalling, and stealth (save for the invisibility that he has kept when survivors are awake and a certain distance away from him).
---
You probably played scummy
---
Did you get any pop up errors? If you're playing on PS4, I know there's been a lot of issues with the servers these past few days.
---
Uhhh what am I not getting
---
If you dont want to make it too "spammy" (I don't think it's spam if it's all different ones) put it all together before posting here
---
So much idiots dcing and not working on gens cause ruin up. I can't wait to escape this green rank hell
---
I actually tried but the video I made wouldn't upload (and it was so good and even had a funny music track to it lol) I do apologize and have already posted an apology to the community.
---
Ah yes, it’s never the survivor that dc’s it has to be the killer fault
---
I tried but the vid I made wouldn't upload for some reason. It was so good too, had funny music and nicely spliced 😭😭
---
You posted 20 mundane clips with no commentary or editing and didn't expect backlash? 
---
 
---
This IS a public forum to talk about a game. However it 100% is NOT a dumping ground for low-rank clips that aren't in any way signifigant. It keeps the rest of us from being able to see actual posts because we have to sift through your nonsense.
---
you could of put all of these together in one video and then posted it instead of making like 30 posts
---
Had a rank 7 spirit dc the other day soon as ruin and thrill got popped. Had 2 hooks and 5 gens left with prayer beads. My last cake was wasted and I'm sure everyone got a -1 pip. "I was trying to get the achievement" he said in a later match.
---
Geez is everybody in this community toxic af? I pologized for it and you're still belly aching over it. Grow up dude, I'm sorry you had to scroll your finger up a little bit more to get past my vids
---
I found pouring bleach into my eyes really helped.
---
YESSSSSS DUDE
---
Thanks I will make sure to try that
---
Yeah that's true. I often notice that when a survivor joins the lobby the ping rises suddenly too high. And then it drops down. But won't be the same as before.
---
You're making it a bigger deal than it is. Just accept the apology and move on.
---
Im not a big fan if current Freddy and thats mostly because whenever i get chased by him he goes up my ass to hit me. For surivors i dont like claudette because her scream hurts my ears
---
Yea theres definitely a few bugs on survivor side. I play a lot using Ash mainly. I'm about rank 10-12 on both killer and survivor. Looking forward to the reworks. Hoping they get dropped this Tuesday like I've been hearing.
---
Thanks man, appreciate it
---
It’s low ranks it’s common. Keep playing and stop camping.
---
I don’t camp lol
---
In terms of perks, it's less
---
Yeah I did it today, not sure what it could mean lol
---
Ill be honest, sweaty killers dont bother me, i get it you want to win. Its the killers that try to holt the game to a stand still and make the match 30 minutes that are my least favorite. Like the times we 3 gen ourselves and its a doctor with overcharge that kicks gens and refuses chases just to be annoying, fuck those people.
---
Did you just miss 2 regular skill checks lmaoooo
---
Killers: Leatherface because when I play against him he camps, when I play him I'm basically an M1 killer who likes to occasionally give people head starts by hitting objects with my chainsaw. 
---
Survivors: I can't remember the one lady that screams so damn loudly when they get hooked but that one.
---
But you had 5pips worth of fun 🤔
---
Yes.... Yes I did. Hence the reason I said f this shit im out lol worked out in the end, made the killer go that direction while I made the rescue 😅
---
Honest question, just seeing Wraith and the very low BP of the guy who died...were you cloaked camping? I could see why everyone else just said hell with it the game is waste of time. Not accusing, just that it seems plausible.
---
dedicated servers are just going to make the killer start teleporting back and forth too
---
I noticed that last weekend, couldn't play a survivor game all weekend but I played a few killer games.
---
Wow!
---
It's not the survivors fault this happened its a bug. He would we justified in being angry at the game but not the survivors. I know its common sense not to be angry at the survivors but you would be surprised how many killers would assume the survivors glitched them into it.
---
Your friend is bullshitting, there ain't no glitch that prevents you from hitting ready before 30 seconds. It's when it hits 15 you can't select ready anymore. Hurry the fuck up and press the button.
---
No0b3!
---
tfw I've been insulted by survivors even after letting them live pushing me to no longer do that anymore
---
Aw man, then I'm not sure what it could be. :( Ah well, nothing gained, nothing lost.
---
I’ve ignored Ruin because it forces me to hit great skill checks, which has actually helped me to practice. Considering my other teammates however aren’t exactly helping and keep blowing up gens, I do them a service by distracting the killer for half an hour while they find the totem and finally do one damn gen
---
My timd
---
Guess lots of Anime nerds voted for it lol
---
Kill her, harvest her organs, sell them on the black market....at an inflated price
---
/s
---
Yeah, they let her be in the game for so long, it's too late to change her. People got too used to her, there would be too much backlash if they were to rework her now.
---
The only thing they can do is change her add ons, which is what they are doing.
---
I just chalk it up as free quitter bonus and mive on to the next kill. The worst part is wasting all the time walking to a hook and THEN they dc 😑 when I play survivor I'll struggle all the way til the end if hooked. Out of spite just to make it last longer and for the struggle points lol
---
Nah, they would just stop working
---
Hadenfield isn't even that great of a map for survivors? Just try different techniques for chases, gen-patrolling, perks, etc
---
Dbd is made in Canada
---
Dude summer down. As if it’s not hard to scroll past a few video clips. How incredibly inconvenient for you. Talk about first world problems.
---
Nurse doesn’t need a buff, you just need to git gud.
---
The devs told me that they will delete it once you spell it correctly.
---
Any aura will do that. Hooks while you carry someone, Doctor illusions, illusion pallets etc.
---
I love DBD
---
Me: *loads up dbd*
---
PlayStation: *wrrrrr***RRRRRRRRRRRRR**
---
Dude i just noticed all of those clips were you. Glad you’re having fun with the game more we need more of that
---
I was seriously dying of laughter for a good few minutes because in all my time of playing no one ever thought of doing this
---
Also at the end of the game I brought him back to the sign and posed with him before letting him go &lt;3
---
I'm still confused why killers waste time carrying them to the hook and THEN mori them. Like, okay? I've never had a killer not either insta pick up, drop and THEN mori them, or carry them to the hook, drop, and mori them.
---
my boi hes like Myers but instead of just t-posing trough every thing until you see survivors you need to crouch around. 99’ing the stalk thing isnt the best play but against that 1 surv you can’t catch its good value.  Btw if hes the only one you have at 50 you will have trouble against higher ranks that arent dumb and boosted since you probably won’t have the perks/build to counter them, so my best 500hrs of killer maining tip would be: Level up your character one by one except for the useless ones, like doctor isnt really that important  but if you don’t have hag and leatherface with all perks unlocked you are not going the best way with your future builds. You might already know this since all i’m doing is stating the obvious and in that case I am happy to have wasted your time.
---
The survivors are supposed to survive (which means they need to escape). If that means using BL to get a good loop off so be it. They're allowed to if they want to.
---
Play Myers :P
---
As much as this subreddit would disagree sometimes, survivors aren't supposed to survive 100% of the time, just as killers aren't supposed to 4k 100% of the time. There's a difference between "a good loop" and a borderline infinite because of map design meshing with a perk in a way that's (ironically) unbalanced.
---
Do what the rest of us do. Teabag at the exit gates next time you escape.
---
But for a report to be taken seriously im pretty sure you have to submit it on the actual website

He also camped me on hoom at the beginning of game calling me a furfag, cause of my screen name. He was real edgy.
---
no, im saying you need to get gens done.
---
You spelt Ash/Jeff wrong
---
I agree on the leveling up characters. I'm currently working on my hag and leatherface. Hag is almost 30, so close lol got a build I'm working towards. I normally main as Freddy so ghostface is a whole different ballpark for me 😅
---
One of my fav pig add-on combinations is the Crate of Gears + Bag of Gears or Rule Set No.2 + Jigsaw’s Sketch.
---
How do you change rain in red forest and snow in Ormond and lery?
---
That is badass! Thank you for sharing
---
Bill if definitely gonna be one of my Mains.
---
Lol that's me as Doctor 😂
---
Here’s my build: Hex ruin, Enduring, Spirit fury, and thrilling tremors
---
Argument-less response. Showing your free downvotes makes you proud my bud? 😑
---
me and my swf do this sometimes
---
Sexytime has begun!
---
My favorite is Amanda’s letter + video tape
---
Idk if this belongs here but I was just super proud. It isn’t really accurate or perfect but I love it nonetheless
---
I mean he calls you stupid yet doesn’t know how to make a full sentence. 
---
It’s always better to make a full sentence.
---
Little iffy on the comedic timing, certain jokes, and sound effect choices. But pretty good editing.
---
I will never get why it's okay that three generators can be completed in 60 seconds if every survivor has a godbox. This is why Ruin is mandatory on most killers even if it gets immediately destroyed.
---
That’s awesome! I like it!
---
Bless you guys
---
The Huntress is my favorite killer (even though I never play killer and hate playing against her) and I figured her mask would be easiest to replicate and more iconic than say, a Trapper mask or a Pig mask cuz the pig mask could just look like any dark haired individual wearing a pig mask. Don’t let that fool ya tho, it took a while to make lol, just wanted smth for a keychain super bad
---
Thanks! I hope u enjoyed at least lmao
---
I’d probably go with another gen park Kik POP. It can help especially once Ruin goes down. 
---
Or something that helps just M1 Killers in general like Spirits Fury or Enduring. 
---
I like both Discordance and Thrilling Tremors but with Ghostface I lean more towards thrilling. But finding survivors is quite easy for me. 
---
You could Ditch BBQ since you have Discordance which is a sight seeing perk but BBQ loads you up with BP. 
---
Weirdly enough just like Myers though Corrupt Intervention could be a good enough perk. 
---
Corrupt can help you get stalk off early and not worry about too much Gen progression. But it could potentially hurt you if you don’t do anything. 
---
Myers is a great Killer for Corrupt though.
---
Tie between Leatherface and Doctor.
---
Leatherface just...doesn't work conceptually. He's Hillbilly without anything that makes Hillbilly good, save for an instadown chainsaw, only difference being it is much easier to force a M1 out of LF than Hillbilly. The only thing he's good for is basement memes. 
---
Doctor is not badly designed for the most part, the problem is just that he's been powercreeped out of usefulness and the majority of his kit does nothing with the current meta. No one plays stealthily anymore so his anti-stealth doesn't matter, and due to his slowdown in Treatment Mode and loss of bloodlust, along with how inconsistent shock interruption is, his anti-loop game is extremely unreliable and add-on dependent. Plus there are less potatoes who can't hit moving skill checks than there were when Doctor was released. 
---
These two killers definitely need the most love and attention after Freddy.
---
Well you did a great job. I would make the Wraith if I was half as talented as you haha
---
I really hope they don't the show isn't scary in the slightest and would really not fit in with the game's theme/direction so far. It would just feel really forced and made just to attract new players.
---
nice
---
Haha thanks &lt;3
---
It's okay, you're certain to get four GGs and high fives all around if they all escape, but dead silence if you do well
---
Well he is really difficult to play and RNG dependent because on maps like haddonfield he is kinda bad and good as there's alot of places to hide around the houses making you hard to see while everywhere else is just a no go zone for your ability.   If you get a open map with not alot of cover just try to use your ability for getting a M1 instead of stalking but if it's a indoors map or not very open then your ability is way more useful.    besides that there isn't really any tips I can think of besides leaning but that's obvious and he gets countered by alot he's just a M1 killer that does what Myers does but way weaker
---
SAMMMME!!!!!
---
Wait WTF NVM LOL hi Pidgeon
---
Iron will is better than lightweight tbh, so I understand that! But yes super satisfying seeing them shake their camera around lmao
---
That's why the mine fits perfectly, mess with it too long and it blows up in your face
---
I think she's camping that area because someone is hooked
---
And ur a hentai tentacle
---
didn't we just do this together
---
Not surprised it’s a wraith with a bad connection
---
LOL. I said bodyblocking as survivor isn't toxic, but as killer it is a punishable offence. maybe you should go get some game knowledge.
---
Fuck off, toxic bitch
---
and you're a female that looks like a male because anime reasons
---
 The post that we actually dont desierve
---
 Ded mim
---
Jason is going to be the nextt chapter just see
---
Just don't use M2, that's illegal
---
 Pls delete all the pallets, all the vaults and only make the map 4 meters, also make that survivors can not move now
---
And ur a fucking baku no piko wannabe
---
  Get that great movie.
---
I USE NOED AND I'M PROUD!
---
It says "hag way" 😂
---
and youre a fucking weeaboo who goes around screaming BAKA BAKA and doesnt respect japanese culture
---
I use Whispers, Nurses Calling, Unrelenting and Ruin. Sometimes if I use the prayer beads and dried cherry blossom add ons I will throw in Beast of Prey instead of Unrelenting. 
---
If you are new, I recommend getting some of the more popular perks in general like BBQ and Chili, Nurses Calling, Monitor and Abuse. They are pretty versatile across all killers.
---
Jeff.
---
The show itself isn't scary, but the monster in the show is.
---
It's actually still Huntress lullaby, its whole lenght is ~5 minutes, the longer it goes on, the more agitated her lullaby becomes, and she starts laughing at some point.
---
I think more blood would be nice but overall a really good concept

I thought it was too wow

My poor, 3 yr old probably-not-gaming laptop and the sounds it makes getting me 30 frames max

I usually use mother daughter ring and yakuyoke (purple amulet). Dried cherry blossoms buffs passive phasing right? What benefit does that have? I always thought that passive phasing didnt help much.
---
It's youre choice personally. I use NOED, Discordance, Overcharge (since I don't have Blood Warden) and Remember Me as Spirit. I  like the end game part in my build because survivors don't usually expect it. Nurses is a good perk on Spirit. Ruin is only good in ranks survivors will run around and look for the Ruin
---
🤡
---
I mean the Ghostface we got is a person that takes selfies with his victims, we got a shirtless cosmetic for david, Ash with a puppet of himself, two pizza Dwight sets, santa clown and soon to be hillbilly with a  pig leg as a weapon. This game is just flat out silly so I think nothing would feel weird or forced to have a character from stranger things appear in the game plus I think they want to mix it up instead of just oh a guy with a Knife or hey another killer with a similar ability to Micheal or doctor etc.
---
Can someone explain the whole stranger things situation and what the killer could be like I never watched the show but I know there's some sort of monster
---
WELL, YEAH, THATS HOW THE GAME WORKS. SORRY IT DOESNT CATER TO YOUR DELICATE SENSIBILITIES AND GENERAL SENSE OF ENTITLEMENT
---
Well there is a monster called the demogorgon and has a flower like face when it opens its mouth, it live in a parallel universe similar to ours but corrupted and empty and it feeds by opening rifts to snatch and eat people. The only reason people think a stranger things dlc will happen is because Netflix and BHVR did a partnership I believe
---
What do you mean?
---
Lol it sounds like you just want to being a mori man.
---
Make sure both of you are online and visible on steam.
---
If I can advise, as a rank 1 survivor that's been playing for the past 2 and a half years, priorities should lie in generators and the chase unless no one else is willing to unhook teams mates. Looping the killer around pallets instead of dropping them right away can increase the time others can work on gens, so never be afraid of the risk. Totems, always get totems. As much as possible. Number one hint? SURVIVE WITH FRIENDS. You're so much more likely to survive, or pip up, when you have a team that you mesh with well.
---
Oh I though the survivor who were angry with u was chicken little my bad but I haven't really seen any toxic survivors as much the time I played killer
---
Sadly, I do not have any friends who play Dead by Daylight, except for one but he barely plays it.
---
Just bring kindred and self care.
---
Numerous occasions when playing with a group a friends the button becomes greyed out for the last person with sometimes up to 45 seconds still left on the countdown, it's infuriating.
---
It's a unique cosmetic that cannot be obtained in any other way. Some people like them, some people don't, but I personally am okay with the prestige. If you think it's not rewarding enough just play for fun, you don't need any awards or anything.
---
At least the movie its based on has murder
---
I’d say go with Michael Myers. He’s pretty fun once you get the hang of him.
---
Maybe you should reinstall, I've never heard of that
---
Myers! His perks aren’t too great but he’s very fun to play as and very versatile!
---
A crutch for a crutch, no?
---
As someone who does not watch this show, I am now confused but intrigied. Whatever you saw in this image I'm glad it brought you this fat meme.
---
/r/yesyesyesyesno
---
Myers, Doctor, or clown imo
---
Finally someone cosplays as Julie it’s all about the other legions but great cosplay tho
---
You mean when earlier in the thread I mentioned being punished for being overly altruistic?
---
Nice
---
This deserves more likes.
---
Wait isnt doc a free killer? I already have him
---
I honestly have rare success with firecrackers.
---
I have a question though, the last winter event had firecrackers and when I was successful it would blind the killer and if they were carrying someone, they would get stuned and drop them. 
---
This is what I remember. 
---
The firecrackers from the 3 year anniversary don't drop a survivor if they are being carried. Did something change or was it always like this and I am misremembering?
---
Ok what about terror based spirit?
---
I’d use an Ebony Mori every game if  I could, screw the entity. So much more fun and satisfying completing a job by yourself!
---
I like to grind in the game and it’s takes a long time to unlock everything because I got all the teachables for survivor and killer and have to unlock more for each dlc and also it took me a year for getting a p3 Dwight with all the perks and now I’m progressing somewhat with p3 survivors and killers getting all the perks on them but not everyone have the money or time to unlock everything and also how the shrine repeats all their teachables and never really show the new teachables as well.
---
I bet he panicked when he saw you jump off the hook, swung, missed and ensured himself getting stunned by the pallet.
---
I finally just got spirit fury level 3 at blood web 150 (P3). God that grind took so many cakes and shards.
---
Ok this is actually boring
---
Play jeff
---
You have a point but the new hillbilly’s weapon is horse leg not a pig leg but I can see how you would get confused
---
Late game builds are good if the whole thing is meant for late game
---
Uh who's the actor who's face is cut out I can't really recognize them.
---
It’s a bit early to talk about 5 years anniversary don’t you think?
---
Wolverine might be the only Canadian that inspires me to be Canadian
---
Ghostface. Best killer to sneak around and be hard to see
---
Please rework that godawful squeal
---
I know I am
---
He quite literally hooks you then
---
And his cat is so fucking cute.
---
I use spirit fury level 3 and enduring 3. So when you expose them your able to hit them pretty quickly in chases and surprise the good survivors. The other two are your choice. But with the current aura bug I would limit things like BBQ, discordance (good on him though for multiple stalks). I got him to P3 level 150 rn. First time I’ve played enough to go red rank.
---
good killer can still counter friends playing together... not that hard
---
Well then...... thank you for the in depth info. Yeah. That's strange. Do you think it's intended that way or a bug?
---
Julie is pretty underrated, but I think it's BHVR's fault since they really skimped out on specifically her outfits. Like, hers are just the worst out the four.
---
Nah use a yellow one
---
Stranger things involves murder it's more suited for kids but I don't see trapper boring people in another dimension
---
I message for a escape assist or I DC lol
---
I always feel bad bringing a Mori but I just want some BP back from what I had to spend on getting the thing.
---
All you said was that "anything goes". The comment I was specifically replying to implies survivors shouldn't be in the basement for any reason. As if they've got a choice if they have been carried there.
---
It's a scummy tactic from the killer whether you say it is or not.
---
You really nailed the concept honestly, and it's the same with my friends they hate playing against her but I can't get enough of her mind games haha
---
cosplaying like its Halloween 1997 in here.
---
Yea which is pretty sad since her cosmetics are the counterpart of frank and also Susie’ make her basically forgettable
---
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PLAYING HAG FOR THE FIRST FEW TIMES TRYING HER OUT AND I GET A 4 MAN NEA SWF WHO PICK COLDWIND WITH THE MOST META BUILDS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE, LIKE GREAT, I FUCKING LOVE GETTING JUKED IN CORNFIELDS FOR 20 MINUTES STRAIGHT
---
You are a bold one!
---
You get more BP from just using a BP bonus offering
---
When you’re playing against a toxic survivor is too extra
---
its fine it's true ookkk
---
It’s definitely scummy, I’m not saying it isn’t. Sometimes you do what you gotta do for that pip, the exit gates are powered so I won’t judge him
---
Where is Zoobit?
---
We just need them to remove our bp cap
---
This is amazing lol
---
a new chapter comes out every 3 months, i'd recommend looking at this roadmap for 2019/2020! Usually chapters came with 2 characters and a map, but they've been doing things a bit different lately.  [https://imgur.com/a/fNvzgKH](https://imgur.com/a/fNvzgKH)
---
They changed the achievement, now you've gotta double pip as well
---
You need to double pip. Don't know what it was if you did double pip.
---
Send me ur steam profile... i might gonna buy u jeff
---
Yea but no. Don't think you really know how it works.
---
You need to double pip looking at the scores from the survivors there's no way you would have.  They appeared to have been tunneled off hook and killed quickly.  You won't double pip doing that.  You need more hooks and progress towards other emblems, killing all 4 isn't enough.
---
Damn mobile version and switch version sound so cool. Also i hate freddy i dont think ive escaped him once yet.
---
Aww she sad
---
We both are.
---
Some loops are broken, that is true. But, nerfing loops because inexperienced killers struggle means good killers will be op. If gens take longer, camping killers will be buffed because gen rushing wont punish them anymore. If gens take longer, survivors should last longer on the hook.
---
No... why would that matter.
---
It's one of the strongest maps in the game for survivor.   Even without Balanced the fence and house loops have quite a bit of cheese to them.  The spawns can be brutal for killer.
---
Pro gamer move: not buying DLC because you don't want bad teachables
---
I play on the Xbox One via Game Pass.
---
Jesus, that's amazing.
---
 Nice
---
Ghost Face in DBD isn't based on the movie, still accurate though
---
Aww that poor baby Dwight, did ya drop him off in the hatch like a nice killer or murder him?
---
Poor Trapper :(
---
\^ Thank you! 
---
Something doesn't need to be a slasher to fit in. As long as it has horror elements I can see it fitting into DBD.
---
Then you become a literal eyeball.

Ewwwwwww console gamers. Get out

Thanks I get it ^^

U might consider to do some engine.ini tweaks. This will boost your fps a lot
---
You were like a brother to me Anakin! I loved you!
---
Lithe is arguably the worst exhaustion perk
---
DH and BL are at the top and I’d rather have a free distance between gens and at the start of the chase that SB provides than turning already safe window into a bit more safe one you have to leave right away coz otherwise your exhaustion will be wasted
---
Wow, didn’t know shazam was from canada too!
---
that moment when you've only experienced normal menu and year 3 menu I cry
---
He’s videos have become pretty bad, he never does anything new. Same cringey sound effects and music.
---
*cries in owning almost every killer*
---
Did you hook both, or did one crawl out
---
Nurse is a brain dead op killer. Kids on this sub reddit try to make excuses but in reality it takes a few games to get the hang of her blink.
---
I kind of don't like It...He feels less special in a annoying stressful way and more the basic  cobble of what are consider strong killer skills so he can be "viable" But,he kind of lost what made him fun for me. mental taxing of wondering If he still chasing you..and minds games of tricking people who hide behind pallets into thinking you are leaving as you slowly seem them run away.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
His dream state may as well be "free Freddy nerf"  the meme since being fully asleep does nothing more then lets you be effected by his powers...Other then teleport..so,like one skill (because you gotta trade the snares for the pallets)..So,deep sleep does jack shit...So,fallin asleep is not "your in my world now" It is "Oh,boi I get to use this trap on ya now that slows ya" Oh and a alarm clock..Cause he needs a bonus way to remove his effect. Which I am gonna assume makes you freddy proof for a time since It pauses dream worlds effect
---
Yeah,now he is more mobile..(Which everyone will jackoff aggressively to) But,in reality..you want Survivors to stay some what so you can sneak up on them. (which is contrast to both freddys)....Requires you to more or less still tunnel..Because,lets be real here he aint one shoting people.
---
Basically:
---
All the same weaknesses..and a few new ones...But,hay no more magical sight cause It made surviors so upset Oh, a teleport and hag trap...What a well designed rework which does not reek of not having a idea what to do with him in the slightest.
---
Not bad, but you gotta add Slippery Meat and Up the Ante.
---
I lost it when he said m2 noob lmao
---
Rule for the killers: let the survivors gen rush and never harm a survivor in any way shape or form because playing the game is illegal
---
FUCK

I play on Xbox was this you lol

Yeah I think so, when was this
---
Hold A on your character and move the joystick i think
---
***poop***

*laughs in self care botany knowlege*

I think we'll just shut you up
---
You'll never see anything quite like this
---
A big fucking shit colored sky
---
That rains constant cyanide
---
Now it's butcher time! I don’t c y. When a survivor decides to run around, tea bag, show off and I’m able to down then and chuck’em up on my shoulder right before they can crawl to safety. The GOTCHA BITCH meme with the Smiling Jesus statue that’s doing the “finger gun wink” expression ALWAYS gets plastered in my mind lol. And even if all I get is more hit no where near as satisfying but hearing AHHAAHAYOWWW  is a decent 2nd.
---
Well its not a competition
---
Wraith hitting a dab
---
Yeah it’s worth it, just joined this week and love it
---
Idk many tips but one good one is if you get stumped on a certain aspect of the drawing, it helps to see how other artists execute that specific area and then try something similar to that, especially if it’s a part you think is out of your expertise. There’s bound to be a bunch of clown fan art somewhere. Basically, references up the wazoo

My current build (perks) for him are Ruin, Save the Best for Last, enduring and the last slot I use a random perk (I call a friend and ask for a not meta perk that is fun to use, if the perk is not Insidius I use it)
---
Noice
---
I heard the legion sucks, Freddy is good after his rework but is way different than every other killer and helps if your not too god at finding survivors, and Myers is great if you find survivors easily

Thanks for the input. I have also heard Legion sucks but they have such a cool aesthetic. I think I will eventually get them when I get enough iridescent shards but I am still stuck on what Movie character I would like to play. Freddy or Myers mainly.

The game isn't balanced but it is at it's most balanced state atm. Any killer can do well without ruin, you just need to do more than "hurr durr hook survivors". Since rank reset just happened im not rank 1 anymore so i guess im not valid to make these arguments 😔
---
I was playing as the trapper and I don’t know what it was but I had some add-on that made a random trap on the map activate after 30 seconds, and another one that made the traps so much darker that they’re practically invisible, and this one lady kept running in the traps out in the open, like she could’ve gone any direction yet all three times I was chasing her it always ended with her running into a trap out in the open
---
What in the fuck is this reply
---
Speak for yourself, the first season has so much emotional dread it was hard to watch tbh.
---
Sorry you just suck👍🏻
---
To say you have 42 hours and that most killers suck, okay then.
---
Go play minecraft. It’s also not pay to win either, what a load of shite.
---
It's basically this generation's IT; a kids adventure story that is set firmly in the horror genre.
---
There should be no pallets and windows, killers should be able to teleport to a gen with no downsides, survivors are down with one hit and can be moried instantly. Also, there should be no exit gates and hatch, survivor cannot run and there's no terror radius at all. When you hook someone everyone get downed and their aura are revealed to the killer 24/7.
---
13's way too soon tbh, I wouldn't expect it to be before chapter 15, maybe 14
---
Maybe “death is not an escape” is actually a message for the killers
---
You only have 40 hours of playing, that means you are a new player and also played with new players. I see you also played a lot of killer. Conclusion: if you sucked so bad with the killer role in low ranks, you have a problem, sir.
---
Well don't expect anyone to pity you after using a mori, that should be significantly making it easier for you. But for Hag don't go for chases, you're playing her wrong if you're just getting looped. Set traps all over the place especially after hooking someone (and I DON'T mean 10 traps all around the hook, spread them out). Go for easy hits and rely on traps to get them, otherwise she is way too easy to loop.
---
No reason they have to stick to that forever, it's just how things have been thus far.
---
Nurse is harder I agree, but you can feel how unsmooth huntress feels on console. Easy shots exist, but all the crazier long-range shots you see are nearly never done on console
---
A hex just to increase aura reading is garbage. Imagine a hex for open handed. And stop suggesting perks that affect bloodlust: bloodlust must not changed in any way because it's a shitty mechanic added just to soft solve infinites. It's unfair and should not be altered.
---
Pay to win ..yeah...no. You can be good without any DLC perks. And ALL of them are able to pop up in the shrine.
---
You know that  the grind makes the game? Otherwise you would be bored after 50 hours of playtime.
---
Ah what a suprise. The usual ‘git gud’ meme defense but with more words. You do know that any and every game which has ever had issues in the past like 6 or seven years now has always had a player base which uses this exact same defense to keep the status quo right? It’s just really not worth engaging anymore.
---
I love my friends, but EVERY time I get downed, none of them are doing gens. It really grinds on me after a few hours.
---
...it's a map addon...
---
karma
---
You’re not worth engaging, that’s why I didn’t and I presume nobody else will probably give you the time of day with this post because half of what you said is just categorically rubbish.
---
Funny because chapter 13 seems way too late to me. Every company they tagged has been a tie in to season 3.
---
Agree. That’s why I like the streams
---
There were plenty of games where I was able to get 3 or 4 kills in a match, but as the rank rose and people actually knew what to do the result is about the same most times. To be clear, the complaints I’m bringing up aren’t even original. Many of them have tons of other forum posts of people bringing up the same issues.
---
The dude waits two seconds after they’re hooked, and is mad because the killer wasn’t completely out of view
---
Honestly the first time I was teabaged, I thought of it more as a joke than a brag, so I just started moonwalking and like swinging my weapon (he was at the gate, and the last left) And I thought we both had a good laugh we both had some fun bonding over some dumb shit we were doing, then he messages me saying how trashy I was and how I was tunneling, and I’m like bitch what the fuck I thought we were friends
---
Whoops! RIP
---
fyi The Meg is the big mouth below , not the normal shark.
---
Friendly reminder that running directly into a crow that is chilling on the ground will still cause it to squawk off, regardless of Calm Spirit.  So keep an eye out for ground crows and just walk/run around them.
---
I definitely feel that spirit is the best character that you pay for, I may be a little biased since I main her
---
She technically made it into the hatch, ez escape.
---
That was so clutch. I held my breath. Good job!
---
I got this friend that I got into the game recently, and he looks exactly like Dwight irl, so obviously he’s a baby Dwight, and we almost always do a sfw, but then we got invited to another party chat (X-Box) and he just realize for the first time how fucking toxic everyone can be
---
Okay okay so the game does have a few bugs but the game is far from pay to win you have some of the best perks already in the game you have nurses calling hex ruin enduring and the list goes on those perks you don't have to buy you just have to grind I have over 600 hours clocked in the game it just takes time to get good at the game and know how to mind game the survivors I play both killer and survivor I have hit rank one on each I can say the two best killers in the game you get for free or are very cheep the nurse and hillbilly are the best killers because they have the best map pressure and no other killer can compete with them and the game is to have fun yes there is a competitive side to the game but that should be expected and the more you play the game and unlock teachables the easier each time you grind easier just play the game on your free time and you will have a love hate relationship with the game and the cosmetics have nothing to do with skill or an advantage in the game that part was just dumb my guy
---
Just gotta remember those ranges and angles,I tell you it’s less painful than a Nurse.
---
For long Shots,it’s all skills,but a lot of luck at the start,you should soon be that Huntress that throw Hatchet across the map,they are scary.
---
Yeah I think it was me
---
Its actually quite the oposite, I pick omegablink so that I can relax and have a fun game vs a 4man on comms. Its like the one thing we killers can pick where we dont have to sweat at rank1
---
Huntress on console (I've never played on pc btw) is like having a smooth animation and skipping random frames. Can you hit people? Hell yeah I'm not to shaby myself but aiming is painful because you either have low sense and get 360'd or you have high sense and watch your camera jump around. So far I've only played dbd on ps4 so the camera stutter might be exclusive to ps4 and not xbox

Pretty much what I do,I also pray he doesn’t have the injured add-on.
---
android 9 eh?
---
still a stupid reason for not doing so, even though they did
---
If they do more indoor maps I would love more indoor interaction like you can hide under the patients bed to hide from killer but the killer can do a quick check animation where he stabs through the bed
---
DamnNoHTML makes both educational videos while also shitposting. Not sure if he still shitposts since Dark Souls but he is one of my favorites!
---
\\\[T]/
---
The only times I've ever played trapper was for his achievements also if you play doctor God bless you because that is unplayable for me
---
I doubt they'd do Lucifer it doesn't fit especially since the whole show is about him being the devil but not that bad a guy
---
Yesss!!! I would love more closet variations. I'd like a stabbing animation on both Lockers and Beds to explain why you are injured when escaping off a killers shoulder after being pulled from something.
---
Sorry, still getting used to the way reddit works with posting https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cfef3c/because_template/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app 
---
My bad for not posting template in the comments
---
He usually can;t do shit when a pallet is dropped, end before he gets you he's out of bottles and needs to reload them
---
I would buy the licends killers so you can buy the original killers with shards and that way you spend he least amount of money(and legion sucks get Freddy instead he is getting a rework)
---
No Mither + Self Care + OoO = Chad.
---
Same! We need more interaction the devs want to say they want the game to focus less on looping but don't give us any interact options! Imagine how sick the animation would be of the killer grabbing your leg and dragging you out from under the bed
---
I’m not sure if it was last Xbox patch or the one before that, but Huntress is a lot smoother than she used to be. Nurse is still a headache tho
---
Ah, a fellow man of culture I see.
---
You;re not wasting them, because if you don't drop them he will get to you. Wasting pallets means you're using them when you shouldn't do them. If other survivors know how to hold m1, all gens are gonna be done in the meantime.
---
Are you showing why Canada is good or bad? Because I was all for the good until I saw that killer in the bottom panel
---
I haven't played huntress since Ghostface came out so I might be outdated :/
---
The type of tv/monitor you have can have a huge impact on performance too.
---
Sorry this is late. I see ColdWind ALL. THE. TIME. Like its annoying how often I see it. But it does feel like the First two realms have vanished. Specifically Autohaven. Haven't seen that realm for a while.
---
Reloading takes bout 5 secs. Hook them and wait around, reload then move on. And also u or the clowns u face are clearly wasting the bottles then. When reaching a pallet throw a bottle on the pallet, bait the drop, then break, little distance will be made.    
---
   And anyway by those standards most killers can do little when a pallet is dropped- other than nurse, legion and kinda plague, even the chainsaw boys aren’t great unless they’ve revved up already. Nurse is the only one who counters pallets. So that argument is a bit pointless by that point.
---
What does "new archive/new rift" mean?
---
I was messing around with the bottom stuff and accidentally added that, lol
---
Uh, can we get an F in the chat for unreleased legion.
---
I usually don't ready up because im tabbed out sry guys
---
Nah, not looking for pity, I'm not a sore loser. And I try to be cool about my Mori use, I only make use of it after I've hooked a person twice and they would have died anyway. I don't use them for advantage, I just like the animation better than a boring old hooking. I was mainly just wondering if this was something that happened to alot of other people. I'm guessing not, though lol
---
Its over feng min, i have the high ground
---
okay...
---
I hate that too, for me red ranks means "you have to play Spirit/Hag" because I suck with Nurse and she's giving me a headache from her screeching. BHVR said they wanna make fun killers, not viable killers and that makes no sense. How is playing a killer and knowing you're 80% gonna loose fun? Sometimes I play other killers and just hope I'll get red ranks potatoes. But if I don;t I get teabagged, clicked and callled a noob/trash, just because the game is designed as it is.
---
Never seen a good one tbh. But maybe it's my luck
---
Play him and figure it out. It’s a game. You won’t win every time and people will beat you.
---
If you don't know if everyone is at a gate it's good to wait to make the killer force you out, buying some time for someone who might not have made it yet.
---
teabag followed by dc. nice
---
Yeah, but it actually makes **kill**er **kill**. 
---
Instead of being a murder-cuckold that can only watch as Entity kills their play.
---
Wow, please nerf BHVR?!??
---
"Pay to win mechanics"
---
\-Strongest killers of the game are free
---
\-Strongest survivor perks in the game are free
---
\-The only thing that is "pay to win" that u really need is ruin, but u can get that for free in the shrine.
---
\-Bloodpoints cannot be purchased, so you can't spend money to level up faster. 
---
\-no one forces you to spend money for skins, you can play without them (and you can get some skins with shards)
---
Oh dear. It seems you've seen it.
---
Its awful. I love it! Take my orange arrow
---
We love noob
---
Pig’s skins were the best buff she could get Kappa
---
I think killers are becoming more mindful because I still get firecracker saves most times I bring them in.   I think they made the audio louder as of recently for them, so killers know when they’re being used.
---
I played two Myers yesterday and they 4k’d both times. Just because you’re not adept at a specific killer doesn’t mean he’s busted or not viable, it means you just need to work at it.
---
It's always the fucking Davids
---
Guilty! 🙋🏻‍♀️ I usually empty the dishwasher or something like that, loll.
---
the buff she deserves
---
I’d prefer all survivors to start in a guillotine that insta Moris them
---
My build is sloppy ruin thrilling and haunted
---
But it doesnt matter if your obsession changes mid-game for rancor?
---
Duude? That's the ochido thing, and I barely watch him.

Holy shit haha. Well played

You’re changing narratives, now.

I remember my first nurse game to this day. The trauma...
---
kick a gen or pallet for points.
---
Later queer
---
I had my first 3k after 6 games, felt good. Still mess up a lot of hits where I thought I will hit them, but I'm a few inches away.
---
I wish perks as usefull as bond were on shrine.
---
Yeah iam on pc
---
I didn’t touch nurse for weeks after the first game, then I decided to play her again and got a 3 k lmao. I still don’t know how

Sometimes i get lucky and get a good tier 3, othertimes, I can't even get tier 3.

Oh damn
---
Capitalism is the freedom of resource goods for anyone to have access to instead of the government having complete control, and also everyone has the freedom to exchange those goods how they please.  What we have now is not free market capitalism but crony capitalism which is where the government abuses the powers it’s granted to hand special access and special favors to corporations in exchange for more control over the resources those corporations control.  He is wrong.  Unions are a bandaid fix that often ends up corrupt to attempt to alleviate the core problem of too much government power.
---
DrMoonl1ght speaks the truth. Having a metacomms advantage over the killer screws over the killer.
---
Trapper: I’M BRINGING THE IRIDESCENT STONE YOU LITTLE SHI-
---
Also, can’t stress this enough, give us a killer that can hide in lockers!!!!!!!!
---
I never watched that show and don't plan to buy aren't the main characters there all children or something, can hardly make a survivor out of that
---
Ghostface is still pretty viable at high ranks, I main him at Red Ranks and am able to get consistently good games.
---
Unless they are swf, then you might get a 3k or 4k, they like being altruistic.
---
Work with your Addons maybe? I’m play survivor mostly and when I play killer I play Huntress or Legion. So I can’t help with specifics. You’ll get there. Maybe try ghost face so you’ll eventually be the one tea bagging

There are adult characters. It's actually likely going to be &gt;!Hopper after he got zappy zapped!&lt;.
---
you should do wraith next
---
It's a battle pass they're doing where you can pay to unlock exclusive skins and story related stuff including cutscenes.
---
That’s a great starting point though. Or negating points for camping killers who stay on the hook for longer and negating points for survivors who camp around hooked survivors for too long. The game is so unbalanced any change tilts the tables in one or the other direction. But again people generally play survivor more so survivors just want the easy win and not a challenging win. I love playing against op killers because it makes me get better but some loops definitely cannot be broken even with op killers they make you waste too much time.
---
I’ve been running a 3 gen build on Pig that is getting great results.  Surveillance, Discordance, Pop goes the Weasel, and Nurses Calling. 
---
Discordance lets you know where to go early game and will help all game against swf. Surveillance to track the gens you decide to pop after you get a hook.  
---
Nurses is just amazing in general, and I use Pigs stealth often so it really comes into play. 
---
With her traps and pop goes the weasel most games grind to a halt at 3 gens left.  Around then is when you should start getting 3rd hooks on people. 
---
Teams that spread out gens well cans be tough but I haven’t depipped yet using this build.  Rank 8 at the moment but I was rank 4 before reset.  I don’t get a lot of playtime otherwise I think I could have held my own at rank one. 
---
This being said I wouldn’t mind some adjustments to her kit.
---
Which is why I mention unless bvhr ever actually does anything to punish these players. It would just continue to happen. It happens now and nothing gets done.
---
Why do you care about viability when this game has less competitive integrity than rolling a die?
---
I can make one, what do you have in mind?
---
Yeah, feel free to use this for whatever you want.
---
Okay that's fair. DBD has and always will have this issue though, it's unfixable, the standard M1 killers will never be truly "viable" because the only way that's happening is if they nerf survs so hard that they won't stand a chance vs the stronger killers.
---
It's unfortunate, but I think you should be able to still win 60-70% of your games even as a weaker killer. You said you don't have Ruin? You could try going with Enduring, Brutal Strength, MaA and Sloppy. On m1nners like Myers Sloppy still slows the game down, and try to do more in tier 2, usually you shouldn't pop EW3 more than 2 or 3 times max if you use it well.
---
Thank you ^-^
---
You basically described every problem in this game perfectly. Hell, even the devs dont realise some of these things. I hope to see this post in hot.
---
Is Xbox as bad as PC for toxic survivors who DC and teabag every four seconds? Never happens on PS4
---
Good idea.
---
I don't have MaA, popping EW3 2 times is enough
---
I just had a 5 min game where they all grouped up to save a clumsy guy i downed in tier 1(big wall, he lost sight of me after i hit him and came right back to me) and was able to pop it and down them all.
---
There was another 10min game where i got stomped hard which tilted me and made me make this reddit post due to frustration.
---
What are non-M1 killers in this game?
---
It won't be xD, one of the mods and I aren't on the best terms
---
But hopefully someone sees it, the game has made a lot of steps in the right direction, I just hope by this time next year I can play this game with out the problems mentioned here
---
Myers needs monitor and abuse it is the most important perk for him. Also don't run enduring and brutal at the same time. Try some locating perks like nurses or whispers 3. Also pop goes is also good for gen regression. Also when you try to locate survivors just randomly stalk around you to get that stalker notification popup. If this still doesn't help then watch truetalent to learn mindgames and lunge distances.
---
Whaaat. It's first time I've heard about it. Has some archives already been avaible? It says "new archive/rift", implying that there was already one before (that would be "old" archive). Or am I reading too much into it? It'd really suck if I missed one of them.

Make his screeches actually deafen survivors and anyone within a twenty-meter radius of their headsets
---
Just stop the timer from EGC when someone has a RBT, no need to complicate.
---
If devs don't want to give her end game traps back, then an add-on rework and 100% crouch movement speed would also be perfect.
---
It's a weird way how they wrote it but no it's gonna be the first one, we haven't had one yet
---
When someone uses no mither.
---
(Me and the people i play with see it as useless)
---
2 weeks and the troll still doesn’t have any karma, run out of comments?
---
Dang, I watched some vids about it. Now I'm hyped af.
---
Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Huntress, Hag and Plague are classified as "non M1" because their power directly influences the chase consistently, Plague is fairly borderline though. Stuff like Trapper or LF are technically not M1nners but in practice almost always are.
---
It's not about players not being there to join. It's about the lobby being straight up broken. You'll see 3 survivors, one space open, and a few minutes will go by, someone will leave, then that space gets instantly filled, and again leaving one space open that never gets filled. It's broken.
---
\*run in adrenaline
---
This might be a bit biased, but Nea has some of the best outfits. I run multiple combinations
---
Is MaA good for it's FOV for stalking or the TR reduction? Cause if it's the latter then Myers breathing reveals him way before his TR.
---
I don't have a lot of teachable perks, i only have 120 hours in 3 weeks so far(most of that time is queueing) i don't have trouble finding survivors, just pressuring them. I know the lunge distance for T2 and T3, T1 is hard to get used to.
---
Thank you for the suggestions and help.
---
Enduring and Brutal are great together, I never said you shouldnt run both? 
---
Deerstalker helps when you're slugging and for example have to chase the last surv for a while, it allows you to find your slugs at the end.
---
the new cosmetic that Kate will get
---
The first is good against toxicity but the second one not. Sometimes you simple have to play def. especially against SWF when you are a killer like trapper or hag which natures are more def.
---
Leatherface is the current worst killer now after the Freddy buff  
---
\*sad special needs noises\*
---
I did! But the other guy wasn’t too happy about it
---
Yeah well my friends taught me to always be useful like always attempt to be on a gen or going to help someone off a hook but yeah I definitely know what you mean about bad team mates multiple times I have died on hook after only one hook cause no team mates bothered to help or they just randomly run around or something it's super frustrating and annoying
---
Oh sorry, someone else said that. Iam gonna play Myers until rank 7 then switch to billy.
---
Thank you for the help.
---
Its really sad to see this type behavior from survivors. Like, they have the control and they throw it away because of fear of the killer, and instead of making gens they just crouch behind a random rock so in the end they can get the hatch
---
Lol
---
Dark Devotion tier 4 looking good
---
People care about that? I mean yeah I don't want to see a Martian with a laser gun or anything but I don't much care what the origins of a killer is. Only if they are fun to play.
---
I guess maybe they want a specific aesthetic to killers as a corrupted human. Especially since the entity seems to be a kind of God of serial killers.
---
I thought this meme was going to be about OoO and the woman pointing was the survivor, because every time people use OoO they do the pointing emote and I make the face that cat makes in the original meme.
---
And you found this impressive?
---
It depends, you are correct for most of your part, but say you have god pallet at the shack and Clown gets you early. Are you willing to waste that pallet? I know I certainly wouldn't. I would take the hit and run to another pallet or loop. What I mean by wasting pallets, are pallets that are ridiculous good and shouldn't be wasted at the start of a match. Simple pallets around poor loops by all means use, but any decent survivor knows to never waste the god pallet early in a match.
---
I think that teabag means "please spare me" after the dcs (they obviously lost) and she dc because killer didn't want to show mercy.
---
I'm really glad i'm not the only one having this issue. I just don't understand that in the previous month i've started at rank 20, because i've had like 3 month break from the game, and i almost easily got into low purple ranks, now i'm stack in low gray. And like i said i'm not even getting matched with good killers, but the other survivors are my real enemies recently.
---
r/ihadastroke
---
Because melting humans to make a giant flesh-monster is..not murder? Not saying that stranger things is particullary scary but i wouldnt let an 8 year old watch that.
---
This sub needs a mod wipe.
---
I’m down if the killer looks exactly like D’vorah from MK. She already kills everyone anyway.
---
And at some point, you'll just get hit through a window, pallet or because of the bad hitboxes, you can't do nothing about that. And it's even harder on console when all the killers have ping around 110 ms for some reason.
---
Lmao if you think cleansing is necessary you really do not play Dead By Daylight
---
Yeah, i can just hope i'll get lucky one day.
---
Yeah
---
When did I say anything about that?
---
The lobby straight up will never fill until you make a new one. It doesn't matter how many people there are. The lobby ***does not fill, ever.***
---
I like Feng’s Rare loot collector outfit
---
It is for the terror radius. If you know where they are and you can approach from cover then it is a free hit then stalk.
---
Beep beep here comes the fucking fastest killer, everyone!
---
Ah I see, also why shouldn't I run Enduring and BS together?
---
lol maybe ur just 50 hours
---
tokyo subway Feng
---
What do you mean mate
---
if you want to, you can Upload some Gameplay and I will help you find out whats wrong.
---
BTW. is David your Main Survivor? You should really Upgrade your perks
---
Whoops, spent all my shards in a shovel for billy.
---
Yes
---
I knew it
---
What perks do you have for him?
---
Also, you can use the pt3 claudette that just urbans evasion the entire fucking game to make a pallet free area with 3 untouched gens. Protect those gens and attack at evil within 3 and you should be able to punish their dumb decisions and poor gen control more often
---
Her real power would be making survivors stuck in tbag dance xD
---
If she's refusing to use corrupt purge then you might as well cleanse anyway so you're not one-shot. That's not time wasted. Taking two-hits (or having to wait for the Plague player to break you with vomit before M1ing you) to be downed is better than one hit.
---
Entity only pulls humans to the realm, the monster is human?
---
i mean yeah
---
Yes, but actually no.
---
FINALLY someone that acknowledge this problem. Don't uds how people went berserk for the Wake Up bug, but this has been going on for about as long as the wake up bug and nobody ever says shit about it. Thank you so much op! :D
---
ChipsPickle.. How many hours do you have in the game, because you can clearly see in a few hours playing as killer or survivor that killers can only rely on survivors making mistakes (unless its the nurse) and if you have at least a few dozens of hours you know that getting better is only knowing the common mistakes and capitalizing on them
---
It's creative and well-drawn, but it loses the silhouette.
---
Same. XD
---
The killer is tiering up in their move speed
---
Autocorrect, sorry
---
Pretty sure the entity has the power to take anything into his realm, not only did he take the clown's horse but he also can literally pull people in from any time period and alternative realities. It's not a stretch he can bring a non human into the realm.
---
I disagree with this, noob is my least favorite dbd youtuber
---
Agree
---
Honestly, I kinda agree. I still watch them, but they have become kinda of linear. I love his streams a lot though!
---
Silly Canadians!
---
Too bad you kind of have to buy him if you want bbq
---
They would never allow them to do something like that to 11 nor due I think most people wanna see 11 turned into something like that, if anything that'd just work better as an original killer based off that idea.
---
I think Steve and Hopper would be great additions to the game.
---
Its because the devs already acknowledged it and are working on it, it should be fixed in the mid chapter patch... hopefully
---
I will be the most dedicated Dol-Ota. Waving glowsticks while she chases me down.
---
I saw an older game from a streamer that used an incidious slugging build on Myers at rand one and did well. Might have been Monto. I think the build was incidious, mad grit, agitation and nurses. I know one of those is DLC exclusive character perk but it seemed to work for him. Admitted it was a toxic build but, it seems like if you want to play a non top tier killer in top tier ranks you have to play with an unexpected play style.
---
Why not cleanse ? Her Corrupt Purge even isn't that good to begin with. She needs to waste time to get her Corrupt Purge, especially if you are smart with cleansing, after she gets her Corrupt Purge you hear the "Dong" sound, so you know when she has it, so you can just hide from her, you can use loops with high walls, so she can't throw over it, a pallet stun remove her Corrupt Purge, so just stun her with a pallet or DS and she loses her power and she slow herself 3 times to release Corrupt Purge, so baiting pallets also works well against her.
---
Also, spreading out is also a big counter, because her Corrupt Purge is on a 1 minute timer, so even if she gets 1 survivor with her Corrupt Purge, she can't get everyone if people are spread out.
---
I'm almost 90% sure that during the 3 year event and other events they said in live that everyone have to be human or at least one day was one (like hag), so killers like The Alien will never happen
---
I have decent success with him, but if you don't have the best perks you're at a disadvantage, no other way to put it. Myers benefits so much from perks.
---
BBQ/Ruin are the usual no brainer on him, then I go for either Monitor &amp; Abuse and Nurse's Calling or Enduring &amp; Spirit Fury.
---
M&amp;A build you get sneak attacks super easily, people pretty much run into you. If you run Dead Rabbit as well you can lunge around corners on people healing when you see them with Nurse's Calling; it's sometimes easier to hit them once, pretend to break chase/hit someone else then go back and ambush them while they heal. Also generally makes stalking easier due to such low TR.
---
Enduring/Spirit Fury build is pure brute force and probably pulls ahead at higher ranks. Spirit Fury is really a must-have on Myers if you're going with Enduring imo, he benefits so much from SF because he can 99% EW2 and pop it after he barrels through a pallet with SF for an easy down. The dirtiest build I run on him is the Enduring/SF one with the green faster stalk addon and Tombstone Piece; get 99% EW2 ready by the time Spirit Fury comes online, smash through a pallet, pop EW3 and rather than downing you instead remove them from the game. It's cheesy as shit.
---
A quirky off-meta build is something like long/perma EW3 with Knockout and Infectious Fright, and some form of increased Terror Radius (Distressing or Dead Rabbit). It can work to play for a slugging snowball with a build like this, especially on small maps, but it's not as consistent.
---
Without Ruin, yeah it will be harder because Myers has very little map presence &amp; pressure besides slugging or making players immersed if you're Scratched Mirror on Treatment Theatre/The Game. 
---
If I only had the perks you've mentioned &amp; non-teachables I would probably go with something like Enduring, Brutal, Whispers, Sloppy and always run fast stalk addons to help ease the early game.
---
Looking through your posts I would probably recommend you get Spirit so you can get Spirit Fury &amp; also try Spirit. She's really fun, but simple and super strong.
---
Hope that dedicated servers are coming soon. This should have been 3 x 1 day of temporary ban for all of them.
---
I mean, that combo is insane, but Black Incense is an ultra rare, you can't run it every match.
---
disconnecting is coming to a end
---
Why are you running fire up
---
Not only that but there's been dead bodies shown before, people getting shot, ripped apart, being stabbed in that one part, and like you said a whole plot point of people being literally melted alive (including children, but wasn't shown on camera).
---
The show has a TON of murder in it
---
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks?
---
The necc
---
Basically Jane Prentiss from Magnus Archives
---
Wow mr kill joy over here
---
Yeah, and if survivors can't loop that well, you're even more fucked with her Corrupt Purge, how can you not see this?
---
I would love more stuff for both sides to activate. Like if survivors got more variation in hiding places and chase breakers and killers got cool map-specific tools.
---
We have gens that open doors and stuff, we could have hooks that cause effects the first time a survivor is put there.
---
Well as long as the perk works like a close range Scaredy cat it shouldn’t be a problem, adding like 6-12% to a survivors chance to escape to get another down/injure isn’t a bad trade imo, plus it only works during the first hook.
---
The God pallet is something else, if I;m not injured I'd rather take a hit, that's true ^_^
---
Hell yeah. I can't wait to see what your Ghost Face will look like.
---
That's my assumption too, people seem to just hate on popular things or think just because they don't like it means it's a stupid idea and that it's not liked by anybody else.
---
I don't like Scream or Ghostface that much, but im not complaining about the fact he's in the game, because I know he means a lot to a lot of people.
---
I get this all the time. Hook someone in basement, they abuse god pallet on shack than accuse of camping...maybe don’t loop me around killer shack when someone is below in basement than?
---
Don’t even watch his vids anymore and I do think he was a little a toxic with the occasional dc or farm but the things in the original comment are false.
---
ye i agree but with that little tweak (disabled after exit gates are open or powered) this would be so nice.  
---
yesterday and the day before that the rate of hard campers was about 50/50 for my group.
---
Tip, Prove Thyself isnt as good as you think either. Mainly because doing 4 separate gens is more efficient than 4 people on one gen. I used it for a while and found out it was just a wasted perk slot in the long run
---
This violating me.
---
ALL OF THESE ARE FAIR POINTS.
---
Exactly! Just hand out disproportionate temporary bans, because someone on the internet feels like it's the best solution. Heck, why not perma ban people on their first DC?
---
Maybe not older versions but EAC definitely blocks it.
---
Play to your strengths, but dont completely handicap yourself. So, stick to gens and stealth more, stay out of chase rather than engaging the Killer, but also... Dont use shit perks.  Something like Exhaust/selfcare/alert/adren is good for solo. You should also look up tile guides so you can improve at looping each type of obstacle. dont ignore that aspect completely of course, but focus on making distance. I dont know and can only guess, but most people’s problem is they try some epic youtube clip moment they saw some eceleb do, that rarely ever works unless the killer is just shit - instead of RUNNING THE FUCK AWAY. The point of vaults, pallet stuns etc, is to create distance and break line of site, not to stand there wiggling your butt hoping the killer doesn’t know what a lunge is, or how to turn his bloodlust stain away from corners. network latency is a thing we all know exists, yet for some reason survivors love to stand at palettes and try a split second stun, crying foul when they get lunged, instead of MAKING DISTANCE AND BREAKING LoS. so yes, stick to basic fundamentals — if you are running through a pallet and not in immediate danger, keep going dont stop. if you are unsure and might not make it, just drop the damn thing. 
---
and lastly just remember everyone will get downed and hooked, no one is invincible. if the game is frustrating you such that no aspect is enjoyable, take a break.
---
Nobody knows how to spell Myers apparently
---
The tricky thing is that Urban and Self Care technically are powerful perks, but they encourage a playstyle that is overall detrimental to the team. 
---
I agree it's much more rewarding to get better at chases and positioning wisely though.
---
I have 3,5k hours in the game. You are delusional if you think killers actions don't matter and survivors are the only ones with power. Besides we are talking about survivors below even green ranks.
---
Except Scream wasn't really satire. It had satiric and comedic elements, yes, but it was for all intents and purposes a horror movie that glorified violence, or more specifically it was a slasher flick.  
---
As for Scary Movie being "mediocre," well, that's just like your opinion, man.
---
Never happens on PS4?! You been on purple and red ranks?! Happens PLENT of times.
---
She disolves survivors on her shoulder.
---
Ikr I always love to hook up with him when I'm playing killer
---
You just made my morning 😂
---
The reverse bear trap instantly kills them when on shoulder
---
I have a better idea for staring contest. Instead of giving chance to escape, make it so the entity progresses 50%/75%/100% slower during hooks. This makes it so the remaining survivors can get more time to do gens/totems/formulate a plan, plus its more useful during both the first and second hook instead of just the first hook, and its less abusable by SWF (even though i don’t think either option is especially susceptible to SWF griefing.)
---
First things first --- Killer main?
---
Oops.
---
How did you even get the chance to attempt?! Everyone was dead and one escaped
---
They probably got lucky in found a key in a chest
---
And that ass gets exposed right away I see.
---
Oh ok thanks! What does the add on do? Because nothing was at the bottom of it
---
Thought so, I personally play both sides.
---
I really like Kate's flag top with her brunette hair and jeans.  I'm not a huge fan of the leather kit, but I might get it to see what mixes and matches.
---
WAIT.  THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS?
---
Now we enter the real of the possibilities. If you are in a wall loop, even the worst survivor can avoid her, if she is a garbage loop than you are fucked, and thats why cleansing can be a good option. You can still waste her time and stay more safe on specific loops (which means that the cleansing option can be very poor if done in certain maps) but if there is a wall you're likely fine
---
You shouldn't have even had the option to attempt in the first place, every one was dead and one escaped before you were hooked. Is this some bs in XBOX?!
---
This sounds good too.
---
I run a combo of outfits on Legion. It’s glowy and pretty and i like it.
---
God stfu we get post like this everyday
---
I quit this game yesterday. Uninstalled it and everything. I still have sub 100 hours, so I don't have everything unlocked, all I'm trying to do is raise BP but because of dumb shit like this it takes so long to get a single survivor or killer to a point where they have enough perks unlocked to be fun and playable that I'd rather just not bother anymore. Especially when 2 out of 4 games are me a rank 16ish on both roles going against Greens and Purples, like yeah, thanks for Tbagging me, bullying me as my one killer with BBQ and not letting me get a hook so I can get SOME BP after my 15 min wait for a lobby.
---
My fat ass thought it was a cookie.
---
Thats 3/7 games though. Two out of those games three people bailed like that. Thats broken.
---
"PACK OF FUCKING MONGOLOIDS WITH LUPUS" SOUNDS AMAZING.  MIND IF I BORROW THIS?
---
Ok?
---
Huh, will watch that. I had the impression that since im running bond, i will always find someone to fix with me. Because be real, in a random group its never so coordinated that there are 4 different gens done at once.
---
Yeah....no.
---
That is actually a good idea wtf.
---
It's all those pallets he got hit by when chasing during transitions...
---
Is the second time you posted this?
---
Creates a beam of light
---
little she know, spirit fury was up
---
Well, yeah kinda, we didnt have any problems from the beginning to the middle of the match,until we started lagging like crazy near the end, the nurse was fine tho, she had noed and even managed to get a hook, but looking that way i feel kinda bad now :/
---
I like the spinning. Then at least you had a laugh when the killer moris you.
---
I ended up being able to fix it simply be reinstalling. Still don't know what caused this, I know I had nothing in task manager.
---
Perhaps Freddy's a gamer.
---
Oh it definetly is hard to be coordinated with randoms, and on occasion it can help, but there are plenty of better perks. Though by all means stick with it if you want. I use Well Make It even though I've been told time and time again it isnt too great of a perk. Unless you want to follow the meta, just use whatever perks you feel like
---
i really can't tell if he is lag switching or not
---
I was thinking the same. More game devs in general should consider doing things like these to help reduce toxic behaviour in their games by making those behaviours costly to the toxic player.
---
Could really Work... But has to be Bit stronger i think. If The next chapter will really be The demogorgon from Stranger Things, what is most likely, The other Dimension would be The shaddow Dimension!
---
Not every killer... some run bbq or remember me lol also I mean survivors do the same thing

In my opinion, his little edits make it a little more funny instead of some youtubers just putting a thousand of them whenever possible
---
It’s not good
---
Second one I really like, only fear is that it’ll become useless at decent ranks when face-camping isn’t common
---
I like using it
---
Wait doctor is unplayable to you? Why? I just played him for about 5 games and had zero issues
---
Hey, those are the exact perks I run!  Now, let me explain:
---
Adrenaline:  Sure, it is powerful.  It also only shows up if you let me be injured when we are winning the game.  It is a win more perk, which is nice, but honestly, it is just there because there is nothing better.
---
Decisive Strike:  Don't tunnel me, Killer.  It is a perk that only activates if you choose to do something in particular.  Sure, sometimes I will run in to take the protection hit because I have it active, but honestly, 9 times out of 10, it works because I'm being tunneled.  I have no issue running this to stop that from happening.
---
Borrowed Time:  I will go in for saves.  If you are camping, I will guarantee a safe rescue, giving me quite a lot of points and also hopefully stopping the camping.  Again, this perk only works if the killer is acting in a way that allows me to exploit it.  Don't want it to go off?  Don't camp.  Easy peasy.
---
Dead Hard:  Well, I'm going to be diving in for saves on a camper and I'm going to be DSing a tunneler.  Dead Hard gives me another hit, or extends a chase to a pallet.  Guess what?  It's an easy pick.
---
The perks aren't particularly toxic.  They just punish certain actions by the killer.  And I'm okay with that.  Against a non-camping, non-tunneling Killer, I have (maybe) Dead Hard and (potentially) Adrenaline.   And I'm not going to yell at a killer for how they play.  I'm just going to pick my perks to be able to have a counterplay against things I don't care for.
---
Staring contest shouldn't be every second moreso every 5
---
Then that is all that matters
---
God damn, Hope shows up as the alternative unlock for every survivor I'm leveling. I'm tempted to unlock it just so it fucks off.
---
Im not saying that they dont matter, but the killer control is so limited to the point that the survivors can counter every single thing that the killer do without consequences to him, unlike the killer that takes a really heavy punishment for every mistake he makes, also, recently there was a rank reset so uts likely that he was playing with people who know enough about the game to destroy him
---
Idk man, I think the "Humanoid shaped predator from another dimension" fits pretty well.
---
Staring Contest should be tokens that give 25% chance each (4 tokens) so you can keep track of what percentage you're at.
---
If your not sure whether a comment will be taken as a joke or not use /s
---
I had a pass from Claudette
---
What are his perks?
---
The first one sounds awful vs Myers, Huntress, Ghostface, Plague.
---
You start out looking like one of the survivors, no killer radius, you can crouch and vault windows and even WORK ON GENS! But, you don't actually make gen progress.
---
Your power is to "un-cloak", you turn into a horrifying version of the survivor you're mimicking. All survivors have different looking Thing skins. Only then can you attack. 
---
Yea, it's very similar to Wraith. I'm sure we could town-hall this shit, make it decent. Maybe an irridescent that allows them to stay as a survivor, still attack, and change skins on the fly?
---
You could argue that time you spend running, looking for another survivor, even with bond, could be longer than just healing yourself. Granted, there’s the other benefit of seeing your tram’s auras. I’d personally choose self care over bond since it guarantees you can be healed when you feel it’s safe, and can be finished if it gets interrupted.
---
You can use a few things to "kill a survivor by hand."
---
The easiest is to burn a Mori offering There's 3:
---
Ebony Mori (kill any / all survivors by hand)
---
IvoryMori (kill any one survivor by hand), Cypress Mori (kill the last survivor by hand)
---
If you don't have a Mori offering to burn there's 2 perks you can use (assuming you have them unlocked on your hag.
---
Rancor, which is a spirit perk, allows you to kill your obsession by hand once the last gen is powered on (or end game is triggered, assuming your obsession is the last survivor alive).
---
Or Devour Hope (which is a hag perk) that allows you to kill any survivor by hand, once you get your DH stacks.
---
You're welcome 😊
---
Did the majority of players tell you that
---
The hatch appears and is locked when 2 survivors are left. Keys have chances of spawning in chests. They just got lucky.
---
Fine by me. I can max points on a couple of gens which allows me to make more saves (tasty wglf stacks) and get more chases.
---
Staring contest needs to deactivate if there are other survivors nearby /if the killer is in a chase.
---
Sorry, if it's not allowed, I'll delete it
---
Yeah it normally goes. Hook survivor, go to bbq proc person, chase them, they run to hooked survivor, u down them, hook them and repeat.
---
End game lobby full of "nice camp"
---
Like cmon dude it's not my fault if I chase you and you run right to the guy who's already hooked, that's on you.
---
I don’t get it, is the point to show off how small your dick is or what, because it looks like you’re compensating for something.
---
Im gonna ride a high comment. This isnt fair, not for the killers anyway. Sometimes, a killer has to camp if they want any chance of getting a pip or a black pip. Hear me out. Tbagging is not an issue for the killers. It really isnt. Facecampers exist, and killers that just want to win also exist. "I dont tea bag so win win" Except its lose win lmao. A survivor who is only disadvantaged if they go out of their way to be a loser, and a killer who is forced to camp because its the only way they might win. ANY killer at all would take teabags over having all 4 survivors escape. 
---
Ah fuck what am I doing this is a shitpost.
---
Lucky enough to make me spiral into a deep depression when the game just suddenly ends and I was doing fine.
---
I agree. Don’t get me wrong i’m not saying i’m great at the game but I can easily get into red ranks (when i’m getting properly matched games) and even though the constant Spirits and Billys with Ruin/BBQ/Spirit Fury/Enduring get tiring at least your teammates are half decent. Red ranks are the best place to be for solo Survivors as you can actually have some faith in your teammates to do well, even if Killers are a bit sweaty for the 4K.
---
Happens to a lot of us. Just move on and load the next match.
---
Name checks out.
---
I'd start by digging around your router and chdcking your p2p settings.
---
If thats what you wantx then go for it
---
Looking here alone can show you how desperate people are to level up more. Double BP events are always requested and the shrine of secrets thread is full of people saying how glad they are that a park has come up that they havent grinded yet.
---
There's also other forums, twitch chat etc. all saying the same thing. Not everyone has time to grind everything all the time. Hell I've got 700 hours in the game and I've only got one survivor and almost one killer with all perks. The grind is real.
---
A rank 20 Trapper with just Agitation wow you guys are soooooo good
---
Thats understandable. But I think every realm should get their 5 maps. Regardless of how boring they are to be on. (Not gonna lie I wouldn't mind Swamp being the last to complete the realm)
---
Pretty sure that it's not their first DC. Temp bans that increase each time you DC is probably the best solution against this kind of people. Some will obviously keep doing it, others will stop or do it less
---
You also have to realize as you progress through the ranks you are gonna start playing against better and better killers. My top suggestions are:
---
1. Know your exit paths before you start a gen
---
2. Dont over extend on anything, looping, gens, or saves if it means sacrificing the rest of the game. Ie 5 gens still to go so im going straight for a save with the killer standing there.

3. Pay attention to your surroundings most of the time you can see the killer way before he sees you. Dont immediately  run just try to walk somewhere else and hide while he kicks your gen. Your tracks gove away way more than you think. Also your breathing will give you away if you are hurt. ( its how i find 95% of survivors)
---
4. Just keep at it sometimes you get really good killers at low ranks because of rank resets/ smurf accounts
---
The 2nd one isn't bad actually
---
I GET WHERE YOU'RE COMING FROM BUT ALSO IT'S UNDERSTANDABLE TO BE MAD IF YOU'RE TUNNELED FOR NO REASON.
---
I can't stand when my teammate's just throw down all the pallets when the killer is ten feet behind them 🤦🏻‍♂️ and then they can't loop so save their damn life
---
Look I don’t have time for your bullshit right now oh and on the topic contributing to the discussion, what did you contribute by talking to me?
---
I don't make it my goal to look for someone that can heal me in that case, when I don't see anyone I just keep doing objectives even injured.
---
you can just save your hatchets for pallets and windows and chases shouldn't last too long
---
If he straightened up he'd be almost half a foot taller.
---
I think its more points if you double hook each and mori instead of 3rd hook
---
Gotta lean forward if you don't want to get 360'd /s
---
Getting tierd
---
Well done you bullied a rank 20 who has 1 perk, People like you ruin low ranks and is the reason why this community is toxic.
---
Gotcha. You could also argue that not having Self Care puts your team at higher risk of losing since it’d only take the killer one hit to down you. Then that’s more time wasted off gens since they’d have to come save you more frequently? Idk.
---
Well first of all there’s words. Those are combined to make up the topic, The begging were just the lyrics of a heavy metal song I was listening to as I posted it and it refers to my state of mind and motivation when survivors decide to stay for whatever reason to Seek &amp; destroy- song by Metallica mabey I would of used that as the reference because there much more well known then the band Nothingface. The lyrics are from the some Here comes the Butchers.
---
Nice man
---
I'm sure they could work out a deal with getting access to the license.  They just can't do ANYTHING with it.  No new assets can be produced until the lawsuit is resolved.  No matter who has what license.  If it wasn't made before June of last year, it cannot be used until the lawsuit is resolved.  Doesn't matter if it's dunes, new line, or a funko.  No new creations.  Jason in Dbd would be a new creation.
---
Very nice
---
i want to upvote but i don't support Nea being on the bad side hmf
---
she's my baby
---
This looks like hag
---
In the second and third season we see the big bad (a giant Spider-like Creature) could take control of human hosts as well as Monsters and plantlife creating a hivemind. We could finally have a real Legion.
---
This would get rid of toxic players and face campers. 👍
---
yknow who else was leaked in the 3.0 patch? MY MOM!!!
---
Looks cool! It kind of reminds me of the Starbucks logo
---
Screw your rule book Trapper do what he want
---
HEY I BROUGHT A BLOODY PARTY STREAMERS AND AN INSTA-HEAL AND THE KILLER DC'D AFTER ONE PALLET STUN. SURVIVORS NEED TO KEEP THEIR SHIT IF THE KILLER DISCONNECTS, IT'S SHITTY TO WASTE SUCH RARE OFFERINGS AND ADD-ONS BECAUSE THE KILLER DECIDED TO BE SUCH A SELFISH BITCH.
---
Done in 3 takes ;) I'll take it!
---
A nice bulid that you might want to try is Spine Chill, Bond, lightweight and Balenced landing/Lithe
---
I enjoyed that you enjoyed it :)
---
I was just stating how he can’t really use those 2 as examples
---
Holy shit, I jumped just watching that!
---
Fuck the official discord right?
---
Pumped up kick should be like this instead
---
"for every crouch spam, killer will receive a a point of salt, after 50 points, killer's ability will be replaced with an AR with infinite ammo for 60s"
---
We already have this perk. Calls Empathy
---
I haven't seen remember me in months Lmfao.
---
If you’re playing with friends why don’t you tell them to do gens
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
im getting tierd of your shit Michel Myers
---
He can though, killers complained about those but survivors still used it. Just like killers will still use NOED no matter how much survivors complain about it.
---
USE HEADPHONES AND LISTEN FOR FOOTSTEPS WHILE PHASING. KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR LITTLE VISUAL CUES LIKE GRASS MOVING, OR IF YOU RUN INTO THEM AND YOU SUDDENLY STOP MOVING UNPHASE AND SWING. USE MIND GAMES AT LOOPS, START A PHASE AT A PALLET SO THE COPY YOU LEAVE BEHIND KEEPS THEM FROM DROPPING IT. PERKS LIKE SPIES FROM THE SHADOWS ARE GREAT ON SPIRIT BECAUSE THEY GIVE YOU NOTIFICATIONS WHILE PHASING IF THEY TRY TO JUKE YOU WHILE AURA READING PERKS DO NOT.
---
Ah yes Legion, my favorite survivor
---
Not really this is a perk that shows others where you are not the other way around
---
He had borrowed though so if the feng took the hit everyone would be safe
---
Empathy is much better, this would be useless. Plus, only once per trial would be POINTLESS. Maybe if it was once every 60 seconds ?
---
The injured feng did more body blocking than you

I've played 100 games without this happening. It's called RNG. Quit crying.
---
&gt; This game needs more scary things.
---
I mean that's just accurate.
---
He means by how you said its unfair they can use keys to get out by hatch
---
Pumped up kicks should give you a gun and auto bring you to the school map
---
I didn’t notice the survivor thing. Honestly then, i just run a head on meg with the 80’s collection pants and rooster shirt.
---
If someone uses the crouch button on the map you gain 300% movement speed,you teleport to that survivor and you get instadowns
---
The Ability sounds like an unnerfed feral frenzy legion but without the deep wounds drawback. Also, I don't think the community would agree with a constant 130% speed killer as he would be able to kill from loop to loop too quickly. Other than that, I love the idea.
---
Why people will use this new perk? Empathy will be better yet. U can see your friends aura ALL THE TIME (128 meters)
---
“Garden work has taken its toll on my back, bitch!”
---
PI3?
---
On PS4 I get great items.
---
Hey if they stay close it means they aren't doing anything useful. Get that 4k and pop a mori next time you see them if they call you a camper.
---
Eh ya I guess I missed his point
---
Also, damn, we posted 3 killer ideas in a row, lol.
---
When first time do good 360° and killer miss attack*
---
Past five games I've been in, it's been these.
---
Why would you use reshade on this game it makes no sense. It's too dark. Reshade is to make games more realistic and beautiful. This game has ps2 graphics.
---
Tbf even as a rank 7 survivor, I run into killers that if someone gets out in the basement, they will camp, tunnel, do almost anything to make sure that that survivor is going to die in the basement. Not sure if going for achievement..? Either way, survivors that loop around where the hooked guy is, are idiots.
---
Is it August
---
I guess he... slept funny
---
Oh ok now i understand are u saying if Im injured. Empathy the others need use. Ok. But maybe bond ?? Idk i dont think we need a perk like that
---
XD yes... exactly
---
You were playing against swf. According to the killer rulebook by survivors, you had already lost the second the game started
---
I kinda forgot perks and the Freddy rework was on my mind so I was like “remember was used kinda sorta a little like once” lol
---
I didn’t even think to message, I just got out of there after a while lol
---
Just know that this isn’t on purpose 100% of the time. Bond is a good perk for this if you know a teammate has the killer and he is just coming to you to switch the killers focus you can get off the genny before they arrive and hide so the killers agro doesn’t go to you.
---
When he came out (like most new perks) it was used 24/7.
---
BHVR must not want the stalky boi to shine
---
Yeah I suffered few first days as nurse but it's only fair to get bullied before you can bully yourself
---
Pretty accurate, just adding that Dead hard is base on console (David and Huntress are free DLC)
---
I have two questions Iv been really wanting to know.Does anyone know if there’s been mention of a freddy rework release date for PS4?
---
And When we will get a PINHEAD? I saw multiple posts saying that he will join the killer roster. Here’s link to a post where Clive Barker confirms it. 
---
http://www.clivebarkercast.com/2018/04/01/pinhead-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight/
---
It’s from May 2018 and it states the chapters going to be The Hellraiser Chapter. He would be perfect! His power should have to to with pain, like every time he hits a survivor he gets pain tokens or a pain gauge. His Mori HAS to be the “ multi chains with hooks” that rips  his target to pieces.
---
It was removed because it gave Micheal away most of the time.
---
I do like a slow tbag when I'm trying to nicely signal to the killer, like on-off crouch every 3 seconds
---
I would love to get more of the greatest movie soundtrack in this game.
---
I too have a sense of humour, fellow human.
---
Did you survive though?
---
The confusion.....
---
Poor spirit is going into the dream world
---
It is just the cherry of the cake.
---
If a survivor teabags me and gets downed in 5 seconds, I don't mind at all. hell, I find it amusing that he is trying to piss me off, kinda like that guy you just give the roast of his life and can't answer anything but: eh...ah.. Fuck you!
---
I usually hang at the exit during endgame because of points that boost my survival (I believe the longer the trial goes on with you surviving the more points you get in a specific category)
---
I usually try not to Tbag as an insult, really I only do it for the whole “C’MON! COME GET ME YOU BIG LUMMOX!” So my allies are safer, but usually it comes down to “he’ll find my pal soon! Gotta make some noise! (bursts a gen or throws down a pallet)”
---
If you think trapper isn't complex 1. You're shit at the game 2. You've never played trapper.
---
Spirit is just listening for survivors grunts and bumping into them, if you find spirit hard you're most likely bad at the game.
---
Go home kid
---
Because if you never cleanse, she has unlimited NOED.
---
You've just got to know when to cleanse and how to avoid her puke.
---
Lol it’s happened to me 4 times. 3 of those times I didn’t have to message for the assist. 1 survivor freed me while the rest just power squatted in front of me. 
---
Result= power squatters dead, good sports repaired all generators, cleansed all totems, got chests, gates, etc.
---
What rank are you? Trapper is easy af.
---
Ok I forgot (I’ve never played freddy because 1: I’m broke and 2: ima buy myers first)
---
If you think the killer has NOED why would you be in a bad place when the last gen pops? If you’re not expecting it who’s fault is that?
---
The players who constantly complain about this just aren’t as good as they think they are.
---
This could be really good killer with tones of different play styles, like following the bot to trap survivors or apply pressure to the entire map
---
Oh shit I didn’t even see that there. My bad man.
---
Yeah, who wants to stay inside a match and actually play the game? Fuck the other four people I'm playing with, time to be a huge pussy! **WOO****!**
---
Idk why people get offended! It's just been told to everyone that's it's a bad thing so these killer mains become triggered by it..  it's just someone squatting gotta work on those glutes especially at the exit gate. They just went on a long run so they gotta finish with a few squat....
---
Killermains get over it!! Yall have ghostface and are now able to do the samething. Yall camp/tunnel to show your dominance, so i guess survivors squat to show their dominance at the exit gate. It is what it is.
---
Nah he’s from Pennsylvania but moved to Canada with his wife. Can’t say I blame him, no one wants to stay in PA.
---
I hope you're trying to be funny rather than serious my guy.
---
Huntress certainly has a "lag" to her, especially with the hatchet release. I haven't played on PC so I'm not sure how different she is, but when I release LT and my finger is now resting on the trigger and ready to pull again, and she still hasn't yet released her axe until another moment or two later. 
---
She's fun and I have seen some highly skilled killers with her but fpr me, as a ranged killer, I would like her controls a little tighter. Right now its just another factor in while taking a shot
---
Unfortunately Meyers has a terminal case of Hank Hill Ass or HHA for short.
---
Nice troll
---
I feel like it’s a typo but maybe at the same time it’s for the Terms &amp; Condition you agreed on
---
Obvious it happened to me alot too when i Tbag someone and get caught 5 seconds after its insanely Funny for both sides. The thing i dont understand why does it build rage inside of you? Isnt tbagging in your Favor? Cause the time he tbags he could run like 20 meters where the chase would be automatically longer
---
Sure but I find it pretty comparable to looping but on the killer’s side, there’s nothing much the killer can do about looping and he loses the ability to pip (because he can’t defend gens and if all the survivors can loop he’s just going to have all gens pop) along with losing the resource of time. On the opposite side when a killer camps there’s nothing much the survivor can do about it, he loses pip, and loses the resource of time for himself and some number of teammates depending on how many go for the save.
---
U also need the perks at tier 3
---
Make it to be on cooldown, once per trial would've been worth it.
---
Thanks, Satan
---
I love Dead Harding over a trap between a pallet loop and the Trapper steps in his own trap, then I pallet stun him before I go to the next loop.
---
And this is one of the many reasons I don’t like swf. “I left the game because it’s bullshit” okay well I’m having fun am I suppose to leave the game too? Games like that are better off solo at least I can get new teammates the next game. Lol
---
OMG tunnelling
---
When you stalk a Myers?
---
Here comes the *S A L T*
---
My easyness chart is 1: wraith, 2: clown, 3: trapper Freddy at high ranks is brutal to get kills with because he’s so easily counterable
---
I still ignore the one who got unhooked. I hate being tunneled as a survivor, so I won't tunnel as a killer.
---
Now if I ignore you, come back and you haven't healed or attempted to avoid me, tough titty. Get back on the hook.

Little did the survivor know but killer queen has already touched that trap

shirtless myers

Naw
---
I think you made a typo.  "Why wouldn't" you use reshade. FTFY.
---
I would only change Staring Contest to be ignored if another survivor is within a 16 meter radius. Other than that I really like the idea of these perks. Everyone would be running them.
---
How do you finish a gen yourself if you're being chased when the last gen pops? Saying "don't be in a chase" is much easier said than done, with 3 gens left for the killer to patrol, you're basically saying "hope they dont come by your gen" or "hide and be useless till that less gen pops" or maybe "hope he is on someone else" (which would just be putting the problem on someone else) . I wouldn't say it's only low ranks complaining about it, it's just obnoxious to deal with overall really. And if it is lower ranks, it might be lower ranks since swf is more common in higher ranks and they can actually communicate to eachother
---
Idk why but wraith is my least favorite to go against. I’m not saying all killer mains who play wraith are the same I’ve faced a few who didn’t use the invisible ability as much, but I swear 95% of games against wraith they just use invisibility, smack you, then hook you and then hide 15 yards away waiting for someone to get you. Unless they are getting gen rushed most wraiths I’ve played against just linger around the hook. 
---
I can handle most other killers. I could care less if I get hooked by Michael, legion, hillbilly, etc. but it’s the wraith that gets to me.
---
One crawled out, I let the one I hit with that throw leave
---
Overwhelming advantage that you cannot counter? What is this??? 
---
''Survivors should have a counter to run from the killer, but those things should have ways to be countered'' Survivors have counters to camping and tunneling (BT and DS) and killers have the counter to that by not camping or tunneling.
---
Most loops in this game can be mindgamed. Even shack can be mindgamed, unless the pallet is down in which case just break it. You have a weird point of view that breaking the pallet as a killer is a punishment. You remove a loop from the game. It's not a design flaw that the survivors have chances to escape the killer. 
---
Mettle of a men isn't even a good perk anymore after the nerf. DS only activates if you're tunneled and dead hard can be baited easily. How is enduring/spirit fury not on that same level btw? And I don't think perks should make a game turn for the killer? No perk in the game should have that kind of powe.
---
Soooo PC only perk?
---
Playing for a year now, P3 Claudette... just invest your bloodpoints in your favourite character.
---
Trolls on reddit don't make me mad bye :DDD
---
Wraiths mori
---
I use it for sharpening and vibrance, it makes the game beautiful ❤️
---
And this helps the person on the hook how exactly?
---
NA player? Don't answer, I can tell.
---
That sucks... i hardly see many different builds in red ranks same old bbq,nurses,ruin, pop,monitor, sloppy, enduring and spirit fury..
---
I want Huntress to ara ara me tbh
---
I mean you get bp for camping too as you’re going to chase survivors around the killer shack or other basement site areas and probably get a hit or kill off on people that start going down into basement or alternatively survivors are just working on gens getting points without pressure. Also I still feel like the mind game aspect comes into play a lot in camping scenarios just in a different aspect, rather than having to flip a coin and hope the survivor falls for you waiting around a corner or turns around and runs into you (which isn’t even a possibility on most very visible pallet areas) the mind game aspect comes down to perks, survivors can bait you into thinking they have borrowed time and you have to judge which survivor has borrowed time or dead hard if it’s early in the game or you haven’t met that survivor yet. Considering ever hit counts a lot when survivors are going for a save you really have to judge what perks survivors have by their play-style and plan accordingly as dead hard and borrowed time could make a basement save easily successful if you hit the wrong people at the wrong times.
---
Ahhhh.. Kos, or some say Kosm.
---
I’d personally have liked a small tool tip to appear, probably top right of the screen, whenever something new happens, such as exposed, exhausted, etc.
---
I’m not going to be able to look at any Jane in game without this music playing 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
---
Don’t know how you’re supposed to effectively use false friend. You have to damage them for them to heal in the first place. Are you trying to go for a “punish tunneling” perk? Cause if so then... that’s actually pretty smart. Instead of going for one target most of the time, you focus on everyone at once (so instead of going for a hook victim who was unhooked you go for the rescuer and are rewarded for it decently enough)
---
I only "camp" when I **KNOW** that the others are close. Eg. if I see scratch marks right there, the survivors have been rescuing and helping one another like crazy, I see them with Bitter Murmur or any other perk, if I am the Doctor and I see you scream right there or see a new illusion appear there.
---
Like, I'm not leaving, I know you'll come. Hell, I know none of you are doing gens cause you're too busy saving one another like crazy
---
hope that teaches you not to bm
---
That sounds toxic. "To make them lose BP"
---
i panicked and just ran acrossed the street lol.
---
I don’t get how you were exposed either
---
Uptade: I changed the vault and drop pallet to L3 and it’s pretty nice

Burn it before it lays eggs

Wtf huntress is easy as fuck on console i always get them nutty snipes

Check out people who stream this game with over 2k hours, they bitch and moan going against decent killers and DC complaining its unfair or unfun but spend a week at rank 11 after reset. Im literally stuck at rank 10 due to the amount of SWFs who DC because it wasnt fun enough or they wanted their friend to get hatch. Theres no punishment, if they depip, they get too keep playing against bad killers.
---
As a survivor main, how does one accuse of camping when your person designated to loop stays by the hooked survivor? I just-
---
Humanoid and human are not the same thing

Territorial Imperrative, Beast of Prey, Hex: The Third Seal etc.

Ok? Just because it's the worst of the exhaustion perks doesn't mean it's a bad perk. All of the exhaustion perks are C tier or above.
---
Pig kinda got a pig head doe
---
These should definitely be implemented as rules not perks but still nice work, somebody inform the devs they need to see this.
---
Freddy, Doctor and Trapper are my main three

Okay I'm going to have this open in an alt tab and get back to you on August 23rd.

---
There’s also the small stuff he does- like, whenever he’s sneaking around as Ghostface he’ll play the Pink Panther theme. It just makes his streams all the more fun to watch.
---
I don't agree with Lors point completely but I think: "You shouldn't do this completely legit game mechanic that benefits you as killer because it isn't nice for the survivors" shouldn't be a response.
---
L
---
Please learn to read, I said either don’t be in a chase when the last generator gets popped by someone else or use the Dark Sense perk and pop it yourself when you’re not being chased.
---
You can avoid this entire situation by cleansing totems anyways, it doesn’t take long for the potential payoff of denying the killer a perk slot. You can do it yourself.
---
It’s a neutral perk that shows up in a lot of bloodwebs, that’s why a lot of “bad” or new killers use it because they don’t have any other better perks.
---
The survivors who die to this though are equally bad, that’s why it’s not used much in high ranks by killers. Because good survivors easily counter it.
---
There’s a lot of obnoxious things in this game, pallet looping’s obnoxious, face camping. Best get used to it.
---
BHVR hire this guy PLEASE!
---
5 was a typo i meant 4
---
I finally found the original in a video store. I bought it. http://imgur.com/a/WXB3j6D
---
You can only mind game certain loops. Majority of them can't be mindgamed.  
---
And camping got counterplay aswell?  
---
BT, tanking hits and then going for the unhook, deliverance, unhooking into adrenaline.   
---
If the killer is arround you while you are hooked that doesn't mean that you're 100% dead.
---
Maybe then there should be an addendum, the perm only works when survivors are outside a 20 meter range or something like that (I'm not sure about that number I just threw something out there that sounded like a decent distance lol)
---
I never five ppl hatch after wiping their squad unless they deserve it
---
fen ming
---
this edit gave me a chuckle :}
---
Instead of the Freddy style gauntlet 
---
How about a great big syringe and the stun animation is him refilling the syringe
---
Respectful
---
Just delete your comment.
---
Uhhhh, I didn't even see the original.
---
Make the person who just sandbagged their teammate lose BP. If you go after the person unhooking in front of you, they will get the safe unhook and possibly a protection hit. So they are actually rewarded for not giving a shit about their team. If you hit the person who was just unhooked, it is now considered an unsafe unhook and they will lose points toward their pip and won’t gain BP for safe unhook/protection.
---
It really just takes forever to unlock perks and they’re being scummy about rank reset.
---
I see it constantly, most of them still somehow die with full maxed out teachables and crap because they can’t do anything but bully baby killers.
---
I can imagine ghostface stalking from that 🤣🤣
---
Some people don’t care, some people take it too the heart. I personally don’t mind it, I actually find it funny, I nod back at them. Sometimes, games just become a meme fest because of it and I love that
---
Exactly what I mean
---
Or if the killer is not in a chase
---
So the story will go that the Entity pulled the Demogorgo from its dimension to kill for it?
---
I wonder who the survivor would be, so long as this would be a proper chapter. I can't see them adding a kid
---
This is why I have not played nurse yet lol. I'm new to the game and the first games with wraith were terrible and filled with salty people. Now I'm doing the same with ghost face and he is waaay harder than wraith lol. The cycle repeats XD
---
No red stain for the monster? This would make it more scary and fun imo.
---
Killer: Haddonfield, Ironworks of Misery, Temple of Purgation, Yamaoka Estate, The Asylum     
---
Survivor: Haddonfield, Shelter Words, Groaning Storehouse, Ironworks of Misery, Thompson House
---
Oh no...
---
Please help with frame drops too
---
great one
---
Simple Tweak \*This perk will not be activated if there another UNHOOKED survivor standing nearby\*
---
Agreed totally. I never run self care now and just bring a single med kit, or ditch that and run adrenaline if I’m sure my teammates are competent.
---
But urban evasion I still love. Not for crouching around the map, but when spine chill lights up and I’m on a gen, it’s much easier to hide from a killer with UE then without it.
---
People who use it at the start of the game because they’re “immersed” are the problem
---
Easy fix, for every second the killer is within 12 seconds and no other survivors are with 32 meters. Now your squad gotta stay tf away.
---
so balance right?
---
I've been addicted to this game for almost a month now 😻 I've not waited for Myers at the exit since and I never will 💀
---
Jumpscare Myers is the scariest thing in the game by far. All of a sudden he pops out of a corner and smacks you with his knife
---
That's why we have the embers at the beginning to warn survivors that it's about to light. Also, you can just avoid running into the flames and take the m1 hit.
---
Not that strong, definitely should be able to see, and instead of a terror radius, perhaps very loud, large footsteps. The monster should be a deterrent to completing objectives, but no one will get caught without bloodlust and lunge unless they're not paying attention.
---
So, a 4 man obvious SWF with purple toolboxes and purple add-ons going from gen to gen while ignoring any teammates on the hook is not genrushing. It's not toxic to try and end the game so quickly that the Killer has no fun, no chances to play the game, and it's a easy victory for you.
---
Doing gens =/= genrushing. Trust me, when Killers say "genrush", they don't mean "doing gens".
---
How is no one saying Spirit. 
---
That ass tho
---
The hiker Meg is the best survivor, the demon ghostface best killer
---
Psh I can't imagine being upset by teabagging. Guess you've not played a lot of Halo. A shame :(
---
Havent seen a post on this and im pretty active on reddit
---
I think you’re being downvoted because instead of offering criticism constructively, you come off as salty about a mechanic that was meant to balance the game and your wording comes off as entirely attacking instead of however you meant it.
---
I meant to try and come up with perks the helped hunters with tracking and chasing, as that’s what this killer is really centered on, but without making them spot applicable to him alone.
---
This made me laugh hard, especially that you can see pixels on Myers hand and knife
---
If you want my build I have about 2.2k hours balanced landing, iron will, bond, and either decisive strike, borrowed, or we'll make it depending on the day
---
Just run Bond by the heavens, is it that hard to understand with your peasant brains?
---
Ah i gotcha, yup agreed. Also these shouldnt be perks, just implemented into the rules
---
This would be cool to see in the game because it would make survivors more aware and give a sense of insecurity. But I can see people complaining about this.
---
Tombstones brutal.
---
It’s a cool idea but swf would destroy it
---
Or pulls you right off that gen 🥴
---
Oops my bad
---
I'll notice that people who are quick to complain about killer perks are usually running spine chill/dead hard/adrenaline/decisive strike

Also, it is an ultra rare, there had to be some strength.
---
Yeah I can totally see that happening 😂
---
I was going only Bubba recently for bbq and I just love those moments when its either I bait a survivor for unsafe unhook when I come back and saw them down right after both are on the ground or when survs are way too agressive and they get 3 downed in a matter of minute. *Snowballing is fun*
---
Still get called camper tho.
---
Even then seemed a lil BS, but I guess it’s just the vision hitbox
---
I think he meant you can only use it once every time you are injured. You can't use it multiple times for the same "injured moment"
---
I really like this idea from the killer to the perks. Maybe if the speed numbers were tweaked a little bit this would actually be fun to play as/against
---
Nice English. lmao
---
Very cool though. Better quote for PUK would be https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amYzBQMT4VI
---
Staring Contest should probably be "gg ez baby killer camper". lmao
---
Mb missed the arming time, also what about for boiler room lockers would be so hot survivor could only stay in them for 20/15/10 seconds before being forced to fast vault out
---
Dark Devotion Tier 4: Every survivor from the beggining of the game permamently emits a terror radius so loud, that it blows ppl eardrums and they become deaf for the rest of their lifes
---
Your own terror radius becomes 0 meters
---
They rarely ever disarm my traps because they don’t expect or see them (unless it’s gideons or lerrys but a lot of killers suffer on those maps tbh)
---
Could be a good addition. Thanks!
---
no crying cat man
---
Perfectly balanced.
---
Post game chat:
---
WOW SO TOXIC CAMPER TUNNELER BABY KILLER L2P WTF REPORT
---
Yup, only way to stop that behavior is to make it unrewarding, and taking the hit for your teammate gets you BP, while farming them makes you lose it majorly, risking the de-pip.
---
bond is a great perk too but it's range is too small
---
As all things should be.
---
The first one I thought was funny the second one is awesome
---
The only thing that’s hot about him is the fingers because he only dips them in hot sauce
---
32m should be plenty, if people are out of range just do gens or something productive.
---
Camping is inferior to patrolling and applying map pressure, unless the gates are open, even then it's still fair because if you loose the entire game why should a survivor die to a cheap mechanic that has no counterplay minus, you guessed it - perks!!!1!
---
Don't confuse poor play with "unfairness"
---
Self Care is fine. It’s not a top tier survivor perk but you shouldn’t feel bad about using it.
---
&gt; and instead of a terror radius, perhaps very loud, large footsteps.
---
That's a very good idea for sure.
---
&gt; but no one will get caught without bloodlust and lunge unless they're not paying attention.
---
The monster alone will never catch anyone, but if the killer works together with the monster, it might be quite hard to loop them.
---
These should be just normally implemented in the game both sides should have 1. Kindred on always so killers have incentive to get away from the hook. 2. I would buff pumped up kicks so it’s flashlights and vaulting. (Making a new meta of having to cycle survivors who are looping the killer)
---
How about give him a molotov or small ranged flame thrower that shoots gasoline 1st spray the fire 2nd 10 sec cooldown.  Having him make walls of fire is far to limiting, and will be abused by high tier survivors
---
I don't think anyones saying they are worthless perks. But there's at least room for discussion on if that slot could be used better or not. Don't know why you're calling people idiots. Chill out.
---
Its named Dead because all the salt thats in it comes from Dead By Daylight community
---
I generally try to go do something else to give survivors opportunities to unhook, as that means more BP for me to hit them.
---
Because of that, if I walk 3 steps and suddenly the survivor gets unhooked, I turn around and attack whoever is in front of me. The unhooker made a bad decision in not waiting a second for me to leave and now they’ll get punished for it.
---
Sick!
---
i always hunt them down
---
Sounds a bit like Identity V Hell Ember
---
I did. Sometimes authenticity is overrated lol.
---
[if you don't know where this is from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMKUlsJpov8)
---
Thank you for seeing that
---
I like the complete jet-black better than the default Ghostface skin we have now. I prestige 3’d my Ghostface as fast as I could to have a cooler, darker skin, but if the jet black robe was available I’d probably use that over the bloody robes. Nice job!
---
Oh No, Bodybuilder and My Mom!
---
A flamethrower would be difficult or impossible to dodge. The molotov could be a green addon though.
---
Normal bloodlust: good.
---
Upgrading bloodlust with a perk: unfair. That's what I said
---
New Bubba passive: When survivor is hooked in the basement and you camp with Insidious, he gest sacrificed 50% faster
---
No that's why it's in burst 1st trigger pull shoots a mist of gas. 2nd a controlled burst of flame/sparks to ignite the people  who got gas on them
---
He tends to be very laggy and for whatever reason can't seem to get more than 20 fps when in any mode especially treatment. It could be my cosmetic but you can barely see It as killer. My cosmetic is the blight outfit btw
---
Doctor
---
Bro she’s like 8 mentally
---
Thanks, I was leaning towards that the monster can take on the form of 4 survivors that are in the lobby. Example would be that I could possibly choose to be Claudette and have same look as her. If this is confusing then I’ll make it short; copycat the looks of survivors that are in the game.
---
Here we go again rank 20...
---
lol no people complain about bbq and adrenaline and ds and nurse's and ruin and dead hard and and and and and
---
I say just play the game. Imma killer main and I do pretty well, but sometimes I get some real good survivors and they hit me with firecrackers, flashlights, break hooks the works. It pisses me off but it also makes it the more satisfying  to kill them. You win some  , and you lose some.
---
I cant even play without spine chill on
---
Haha.
---
When you can get a 4k with all 5 gens still left and winning every single chase, and still only get "brutal killer"
---
I think it's safe to say that no one gives a flying Meg about pips. Least on the killer side.
---
Vigil, Pharmacy
---
Killers when they get that third token: I’m gonna do what’s called a pro gamer move ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Yea it's really dumb that DBD uses every fucking button on a controller.. TOO BAD
---
Bold of you to assume him mortal.
---
Just leave at the exit gate, there's no need to draw out the game longer than it has to be, especially when things like tombstone, NOED and Blood Warden exist.
---
crazy, because i play huntress on console and i feel the long shots are easier than the ones up close, for me at least. i always seem to miss the up close shots.
---
He gave her a fair chance. Stop complaining about fair Killers.
---
I thought this was due to the person being healed prematurely runs off but know you say it’s a bug I can tell you it has been happening way often. I’m on Xbox as well
---
I tend to still ignore them, or leave them down for a bit to be picked up. Especially if it's just a case of being screwed over by whoever unhooked them right in front of me. That way I don't feel quite as tunnel hungry but still keep pressure on the survivors by making one unable to do gens and forcing the others to spend time picking that one up.  I just try to make the game as fun for everyone when I can
---
No need to be offended. I'm sure there are situations where it's very useful, but your average survivor..well, you know what I'm aiming for. Just 20 minutes ago I had a bill who refused to stop healing himself while I was standing right next to him, bouncing up and down so I can heal him faster. Then I just abandoned him. 
---
I know it's a hot topic, and I like the discussion here, but yeah, don't call people idiots.
---
Is that sheet heart attack
---
I run bond and I like that perk but my whole point is trying to make healed easy. I mean if you go patrol jens it will take plenty of time. Instead of doing that u can just press m and other players will notice you.
---
Nah I play both sides and readily admit keys are the stupidest thing in the game on survivor side. Next to no counterplay.  
---
Though to be fair unbiased accuracy killers get ebony moris which are just as bullshit.  Basically two different sides of the same crutch.  Early Escapes vs. Early kills.
---
What if the killer made everyone look like Nea, and looked like Nea.
---
Honestly this is me whenever I’m on any coldwin map and sometimes Mt Ormand
---
"swing... uhhhhh !!!"
---
Spamming crouch should give exhaustion and increase bloodlust
---
Should be default mechanics tbh
---
Or perhaps the fact that the survivors are constantly getting hung on dirty hooks that don’t get cleaned. Nearly all of them are bound to have hiv/aids at this point
---
It would be terrible. I want a stranger things chapter. Or a sabrina chapter.
---
Thicc I mean This.
---
Man that’s a myth. She grew up alone in the wild but nothing says that she didn’t develop naturally as she got older. If anything she’s somewhat like an animal; she’s misguided and wants to be like her mother but doesn’t know how.
---
baby nurse now has a "fuck it" perk, V E R Y  N I C E
---
Stranger Things is f'n Awesome. People hate way too much. Yes it is Sci-fi but also humor and some horror. I am 27 years old and love the show. It's not just for kids SMH. They have so many things threw in the show that I love like, ghost busters etc
---
I'd say make it a thing that only the Myers player can hear, since it could give away the killer if they're 99%
---
Original post taken from r/dndmemes - https://old.reddit.com/r/dndmemes/comments/cfma4g/all_of_my_incomplete_dice_sets_because_of_this/
---
Yeah that much is true but the fact that she leaves little girls in the forest expecting them to be able to live off the land like she did does either contribute to animal or 8 year old
---
I'm sorry, but most of your suggestions are a no. Pig if anythung needs more proper buffs like a 20-30% cooldwon upon a successful dash attack, and Wraith needs faster base speed while cloaked (right now it's 5% faster than base).
---
I'd say take more time to experience the game. Then reevaluate your post.
---
I feel you, I play probably 50/50 so I see both sides so often it's a bummer
---
Yes, but the addons aren’t hard to get, so if you have a key, you probably have the addons
---
Because this game is all about survivor's enjoyment, duh. It's your job to be their whipping bitch for 15 minutes and the post game chat. /s
---
In all seriousness, this attitude from survivors is why I stopped playing friendly killer on anything other than a multiple early disconnect game. If I see you and I have no obvious objectives right now, you're getting downed and put up on a hook. And if I see your idiot friend Dwight's head popping over the nearby wall, you can bet your ass I'm not chasing him away just to give Meg a free unhook. Why would I? I have 2 survivors not doing gens right now. Maybe more.
---
It's what she deserves.
---
I mean, mathematically, the game thinks this is a fair matchup. All four survivor ranks average out to about a 14 (this killer is probably 1 pip away, but still very close). The matchmaking is actually working as they intend it to work.
---
That would be amazing. Just have it play for the killer everytime they stalk.
---
KILLERS ONLY WANT ONE THING AND IT'S DISGUSTING.
---
No I agree we definitely don't need it, maybe a modified version of it would be a neat support perk
---
make a joke about something and immediately get 10 downvotes from the salty gamers who think you're serious. gamer rage gamer rage
---
Ghostface takes a selfie as a Mori legion is a gang of teenagers who jumped a janitor that's not scary so what's the problem
---
brain not big thank
---
he has a wife? wow
---
Its legit criticism of the game, player frustration and toxicity. You may not like it, doesnt mean he isnt right. New player experience is dog shit. No perks, long queues, you need BP time to play against those SWF who are actually rank 1.
---
Good to see Myers getting some good bloodpoints because you’re a brainlet.
---
I liked getting Bamboozle.
---
Why would't you just pick Bond ? If the point is to find help to get healed it's just better
---
I bought Bamboozle yesterday
---
I as a killer do the 5 spin red light dance once I catch a chronic tea bagger. 
---
I've actually done a game ending waltz while 3 very toxic survivors bleed out on the ground from might hag slaps 🤣🤣🤣
---
For a tip I would run nurses calling because if your in night shroud you have a chance they will NOT know your coming and heal in that 28 meter radius. That’s all I got besides stalking behind cover and such
---
Yes thats true but its a survival horror game do you really think if they made a show it wouldnt be horror based...meaning it would need to be scary.
---
Looping also requires a lot more skill then camping does as well. Survivors get punished for screwing up loops, killers get opportunities to capitalize on it. Good killers can mind game certain loops, good survivors know which loops they're going to want to run to stay alive.
---
Imo as a killer one of the hardest things to learn is giving up on chases. You can't catch em all at every chase.
---
Meanwhile he loads into the end game screen and looks at his Ds,self care,Dead hard,bond
---
Pumped up kicks: every time a survivor teabags you, gain a token. When you reach 5 tokens, you gain the ability to whip out a glock and down the survivor. This resets your tokens to zero
---
Ok, first of all, what rank are you?
---
But that wasn't the response. They just said it feels shitty when it does happen. Just because someone says something sucks doesn't mean they think their entitled to it never happening. Sometimes people are just expressing how something is, not trying to argue.
---
Easy fix. Just have it disabled when a chase is active
---
is suggest using mettle of man with a big charge medkit
---
Yeah I've won a lot of games simply because survivors drop everything to save their teammates the instant they're downed. The only time I play friendly killer is if they tell me they want to farm and are willing to help me get my daily
---
And with that “unplug your Ethernet” “or DC” comments you are a Survivor I hope to never see in my life.
---
But that last one should actually be a perk is the thing.
---
I’m not here for a long lecture on ranks and skill and killer viability and metagame but right now I’m rank 13. I occasionally hit 12. I also know I suck at the game
---
You do you, js saying Bond is better, not to mention it can have multiple functions as well. Leading chase away for gens, finding someone to heal you and flashlight saves.
---
I had no idea you could rotate.
---
Hillbilly let's show some love for the un loved
---
It's duration way too short for it to be usefull unless you use good duration addons, and I'd rather save these addons for other keys. Green key is the only item that has no functionality whatsoever without addons currently.
---
bc bond's range is too small
---
Pharmacy&gt;self care
---
Thank you!  I love how someone will attempt to dispute a suggestion based on the assumption of running an Ultra Rare addon or offering.  Of course you destroyed them you ran one of the strongest addons across all killers in the entire game.  Against good survivors who can loop it typically doesn't pay to cleanse and feed corrupt purges (the only thing that makes Plague strong) her ranged down.  This strategy only works if noone cleanses though.  If you got a scared potato running off to the showers every 40 seconds to cleanse than you're pretty much required to cleanse because their fed purges alone will murder the rest of your team.
---
What about a perk against toxic suvivors for suvivors ?\`Who fucking sandbag you and unhook you in front of a killer ?
---
They had this for a week. It was quickly reverted
---
I would def recommend Magnus, my favorite horror podcast
---
ı agree that bond is a better perk. Hear me is just an option
---
Mayor of pallet town
---
What if the survivors got a set % of speed boost when near the killer/bot at the same time?
---
It only takes a single pixel to injure you.  You're only outrunning a full corrupt purge against a complete potato.
---
Just a waste of slot perk in my own opinion
---
Reminds me of a game a played earlier today. I brought a tombstone piece and I had it at 99% ready to pop it when I felt like needed it. I just got the third survivor on death hook and was rushing to the exit gate before David could open it and leave. He just got it open when I got there and was close to escaping, but I managed to get my tier 3 and killed him just inches away from the exit. Caused him to DC immediately.
---
You did the opposite of most lol, I can play every other killer BUT Nurse
---
So far the most intelligent comment on this post.
---
right? it's always been a cheeky a thing to do in videogames but people in this community seem to get genuinely angry about it.
---
Change Ds and BL to Left Behind and No Mither and your solid
---
Shit like that is the most Fun i have in this Game and thats all about it
---
What I think should be made is like a system where you could throw down a pallet on the monster, which breaks the pallet instantly, but then the monster will be disabled for a period of time like 30 seconds and maybe I think that there should be some addons that change how the injection works and instead makes him vault and break pallets faster and other addons could increase the effectiveness of either mode.
---
Solid.
---
Yup. Staring contest sounds good. But camping isnt bad if you know they are there.
---
Camping for no reason? I mean jerk move but hopefully you are punished with people finishing gens fast then.
---
and somehow its toxic? other games people screaming your garbage over the mic and saying the n word is toxic, in this game its when someone crouches
---
&gt; Sometimes people are just expressing how something is, not trying to argue. 
---
I agree with you here.  
---
But this is a very often used point by actually a lot of survivor mains on this reddit.
---
And these posts tend to get upvoted a lot.  
---
So there is either a survivor bias or people just agree with the stance that only survivors are entitled of having fun.
---
I had countless discussions that went like this:
---
"They should remove NOED."  
---
Why?  
---
"Because it's not fun for the survivors side."  
---
Just cleanse the totems?  
---
"That's not fun either, I'd rather do gens."  
---
\---
---
"Killers should never tunnel. It's toxic."  
---
Why? Removing a person from the game can slow down gen progress which might be necessary in SOME games.  
---
"But it's not FUN getting tunneled."
---
"Killers should never facecamp."  
---
But there might be situations where 'face'camping might be the right call? What about if the gates are allready open? Or every other survivor is circling arround the hook not doing any progress, just waiting for the opportunity to save?  
---
"But it's not fun for me if I can't do anything on the hook."  
---
And these are just a few examples.  
---
There are a lot of loops that can't be mindgamed. It's not fun for me (the killer main) to just have to follow you in a circle.  
---
Totem spawns are still shit. It's not fun for me if Ruin falls within the first 20 seconds because it spawns 20m next to a survivor spawn, directly next to a gen.  
---
It's not fun getting hit by DS because the only valid counterplay to that perk is: "Just leave the guy for 60seconds".  
---
It's not fun playing against SWFs that sit in coms.  
---
It's not fun getting t-bagged after every pallet + the exit gate.
---
But I don't see killers making posts like: "Survivors shouldn't cleanse hex totems because it isn't fun for the killer to lose a perk."
---
Getting downed by your teamates corrupt purges is even less fun.  So many Plagues proxy hooks with it active too essentially facecamping from 20 yards out.  Cleansing is not necessary until endgame if your team doesn't suck.  If everyone can handle themselves in a chase you can own through gens faster than she can kill all of her since you're forcing her to become a powerless M1 killer at that point.
---
Having played a lot of Halo is exactly what makes teabagging so aggravating.
---
Myers cock, that is all.
---
Ghostface is viable at least worst killers rn is bubba and legion
---
I also feel like that’s kind of the point though, it’s a *broken* key, meaning you need additional tools to use it effectively. That’s my take on it
---
How do you “abuse” shack pallet?
---
Yup
---
Only worth if it is genji saying “I need healing”
---
It's your opinion and I respect that but I think this perk can be useful
---
yeah i really don't get it. people get in the foulest of moods when they think their skill in this game is being questioned. i've genuinely never seen it so bad before. like not even in my cod or tf2 comp days.
---
You do you.
---
Too OP
---
Yeah i was just using his normal outfit (black) and the baseball bat. I've been suspecting some of the outfit options to be the cause as well
---
Its been going up the past 3-4 days, Xbox/Steam/PS4 all are having issues with certain trophy/achievements not popping. This one is bugged, there's been adept killer trophies popping without a merciless, I personally have the P3-50 trophy but it never gave me the one for hitting prestige 3.
---
Damn who was this streamer?
---
I'm not telling people to DC for no reason but what's the point in playing if you are just on the hook or down 24/7
---
That rarely happens to me but it's a situation in which i feel dcing is justified
---
Bye bye toxicity!
---
You do hear them in this case but dont know know if its 50%.
---
If you could all survivors would just camp pallets then let you down them so their teammates could rush in and easily save them
---
Most streamers love to use sniping as a excuse and it sucks when a army of 12 year olds believes them. Best to turn off notifications.
---
Ah, The usual “I suck at this game but instead of getting better I will go on and complain and hope for nerfs”. The fact that you said COSMETICS are P2W just honestly makes you look like more of an idiot. You can play without cosmetics Einstein
---
Not all of them are like this, but i agree they can be really annoying with the stream sniping accusation. I've been accused by them many times but i never stream snip.
---
Craziest example in memory in some dude who self cared in basement while i had nurse calling. Then he entered a locker when he heard my radius and i went straight to his locker. He accused me of sniping post game and i pointed out i simply used nurse's calling. Then he denied even using it lol
---
Playing Halo is kind of why teabagging is seen as it is in every game. Besides, saying that only confirms that you were attempting to be rude. Good job Ochido.
---
I'm glad I don't have to deal with childish streamers on xbox
---
Sad but true. Maybe like 50% of them love to use this excuse.
---
I'm perfectly fine with putting TTV in your name for publicity and i even go follow some of them, but stop accusing people all the time.
---
To screw over your teammates? 
---
It happens too fucking often one person gets camped and dcs creating a domino effect because they are selfish and don’t care for a team game. 
---
Dcing on the hook is as frustrating as someone trying to 4% off the hook then kill them self if they don’t get it.
---
I stay on the Hooks to let my team have a chance at winning, pipping 1 or twice, or even just safety piping.
---
I added that in the pay to category because they are extremely expensive. Admittedly I should have been clearer that wasn't part of the pay to win mechanic but part of the bleeding customers as dry as possible. 
---
Also, the git gud argument is a way for idiots to defend the status quo even when a game has genuine issues
---
Getting Hepatitis B from the looks of it.
---
Honestly I think there should be cross console so we have more players to make these matches have more even plans in addition to speeding up times for everyone.
---
&gt; which breaks the pallet instantly, but then the monster will be disabled for a period of time like 30 seconds
---
Sure that sounds like a fair idea.
---
Spirit is stupid easy and I can never understand why people try to argue she is difficult.  Forcing survivors take 50/50 chances doesn't take much skill. At least with trapper, you have plan out where survivors will go while at the same time keeping the element of surprise and on top of that shepard them into traps.
---
I wish stuff like this wasn't implemented as Band-Aids such as perks, but instead would just be implemented as core mechanics of the game.
---
Funny you shoudl pick up on that, I'm actually also working on a few different sets of tarot cards right now - [here are some examples](https://imgur.com/gallery/rrbbBY5)
---
No mither + self care = meta build
---
here we have another example of people drawing conclusions too early.
---
that's if the perk actually works
---
and he did.
---
Probably turn the camera around when spine chill lits up to know the killer's location
---
This seems like excessive censorship.
---
Probably should rework the survivor perks so that at tier 1, if 1 surivor is near it shuts of, then 2 survivors, then it doesnt turn off at all, so SWF and uber abuse the perk
---
I actually have an easier time sideways too.
---
as a kinda newish player who started a few days before the BP and 3rd year anniversary, it feels extremely slow now.
---
Staring contest should have Larry, not Huntress.
---
If you don't see aynone with bond, it means they are at the other side of the map that's it
---
Never underestimate the power of survivors. If I were there I would have run around all the traps activate them get the killer attention and run. other team mate with BT would have saved you easily the other fix gens. Easy but not hard to save need quick cooperation. Sometimes survivors become potatoes and watch die in glee.
---
They're on this sub so your odds are better than a coinflip.
---
What happened in EGC?
---
I love this idea, but SWF destroys it. Does that mean it shouldn’t be done anyways? I think so
---
&gt; I'm a Killer main and I have to disagree with you about this Reddit having a Survivor bias 
---
Well then we pretty much disagree.
---
Don't get me wrong: Both sides DO cry a lot.   
---
But I see threads here where killers complain about toxicity and the upvoted responses are: Just deal with it. It's the internet lol.  
---
Then after the Ghostface release some survivors complained how his "t-bagging" is toxic. The same responses got downvoted and people seemed to agree that stuff like this just doesn't add any value to the game.  
---
It's little things like that, same with every NOED controversity, that makes me certain that this reddit got more survivor circlejerking than killer crybabies.  
---
But since this isn't a contest it pretty much doesn't mean anything.  
---
&gt; "Killer's Rulebook for Survivors" 
---
Like I said, there are killer crybabies and certain attitudes towards survivors from killers, which are mainstream and toxic aswell. But there is a reason why the "Survivor's rulebook" made it into the parody.  
---
Everyone heard of stupid phrases like: "You have to respect the 4%"
---
or: "If someone dc's the killer has to play nice."  
---
While there aren't many killer punchlines.
---
&gt; Furthermore, I will always argue that while Killers can lose control of a match, it's never due to the Survivors being toxic.  
---
Yes sure. I agree. Survivors being toxic doesn't make the killer lose the game.
---
&gt; But you'll see plenty of Killers who think Survivors are toxic for running strong addons or using a flashlight, as if those are any different than a Killer running their strong addons. This is just as silly as a Survivor thinking Killers shouldn't use certain addons or tactics. 
---
Yes, you got this on both sides. A killer might think that using DS isn't fair play while survivors might think that running NOED isn't fair. 
---
Problem on this subreddit is, coming back to the bias point, that people usually only agree on the survivors pov.  
---
I've seen countless highly upvoted responses like: "But DS has counterplay, and NOED doesnt" which is just objectivly false.  
---
&gt; Ultimately, both sides have things that frustrate them 
---
Yea I agree. I think everyone does.   
---
For me personally (this is subjective - my opinion) it's mostly the survivors, though.  
---
As killer I sometimes get frustrated playing against SWFs that run 2-4 insta heals, t-bag etc.  
---
As survivor I sometimes get frustrated seeing other survivors dc'ing, sandbagging me, or doing nothing the whole game.
---
If I die to a facecamping killer I am not mad at the killer. I am mad at the 3 survivors watching me for 120 seconds doing nothing instead of doing gens and punishing him.
---
If one of them is getting facecamped I am mad at them for instantly sacrificing themselves on the hook instead of giving us time.
---
But like I said, that's just me.  
---
&gt;  they go beyond that into suggesting things are off-limits, then of course their being dumb. I'd hardly call it one sided though. 
---
Like camping, tunneling, slugging and running NOED. Mostly complains from the survivor side targeting killers behavior.
---
&gt; The Killer victimhood mentality is very strong in this community 
---
I agree but I think it's usually justified. Not allways, but mostly I can see where they are coming from / relating with them.  
---
You get more toxicity playing killer. That's just a fact. So I can relate with killers more complaining about survivors toxicity, than I can relate with survivors complaining about killers toxicity.  
---
That's just a numbers thing.  
---
If both sides got (hypothetically) equal amounts of toxic players - Let's just say every 8th killer/survivor is a toxic shithead that insults you after the game) every second game as killer you'll end up facing toxicity, while as survivor you'll have 7 nice killers until facing an idiot.
---
But that's just because it's an asymmetrical setup where 1 guy faces 4 players in a team.
---
&gt; Instead of addressing what they can work on to do better, they blame Survivors and the game itself. 
---
Yea. Like you and me said, there are crybabies on both sides.  
---
But for every: "I camp because I don't want to play otherwise and survivors annoy me" there are 5 "NOED is OP and broken and there is literally 0 you can do against that perk and killers are shitty and toxic noobs for using it" posts.
---
It's the tutorial, I don't think you're going to get any of the bloodpoints except the set ones for doing the tutorial.
---
I'd use em; hell they should be standard things that are just part of the game so they don't take up a slot
---
You can just DC to 16 these days. Rank reset can easily push you to grey. 
---
It sucks but at least you get practice against typical green ranks.
---
ok, thanks for the heads up.
---
This! I love this!
---
mommy huntress pls.
---
I'm nearly 100% sure bloodpoints earned during the tutorial don't count besides the flat 25k (Or was it 50k? Can't remember) you earn for doing the killer and survivor tutorials the first time.
---
Even then the basement time BP counts as boldness, takes ages to tick up, and since it's boldness it'd max out at 8k BP. If it did count you can earn more at a faster rate by playing actual matches especially as killer.
---
Survivors would never go for it, it's way too lenient. Maybe if the effect starts 1 second after hooking. If you're still there after 2 seconds, you're camping.
---
? So? What’s wrong with it being scary?
---
This looks awesome dude, I just started playing him and I would totally use this over his current robe
---
Thats not my point. My point is the game is described as a horror game. The trailers protray it has something dark and horrific. Yes people who've played the game realize its not scary, but like it or not its a survival horror game. Im not saying its actually scary but if you made a show off of the game it has to be a thriller or a horror show it cant be a comedy because that doesnt make sense with how the story of the game is. Thats the same problem resident evil had.
---
I'm more like "goddammit you're in my way."
---
stfu Chaos.
---
I just love how to looks such more like the original, while still being new and interesting. All by just making it black.
---
I will still facecamp those mfs
---
From level 10 an beyond , the Entity (aka that dark fog) will "eat" parts of your bloodweb. In order to avoid you getting 2 perks on the same web and it helps make the bloodweb faster since you don't need to get all of it.
---
hello there, i can’t help but notice your flair. the way to play dbd on a mac is to sign up for a program called Nvidia Geforce Now (it’s free, just has a really long waiting list). it allows you to stream games directly from an Nvidia servers, and very well, too. i play dbd on a mac through nvidia geforce now and i get a solid 60fps at max graphic settings
---
The black stuff? That starts around level 10 bloodwebs i believe, it's the Entity. Basically after you have grabbed some of that web, the Entity shows up to take some for itself. It also immediately shows up and takes a perk if you grab the other perk on a web
---
I don’t care about ranking. I’ll stand the fuck in front of you and lose points. I’ll do what I want. Lol.
---
Feng would have gone down, so you would lose a survivor anyway.
---
They'll camp if your friends are crowding the hook
---
Because it being scary makes sense to the plot but not to people experiencing the game. Its like how can a character you Teabag with and loop against killers be scared of the hag who looks smaller than them. The plot wouldnt make sense.  Think about how the plot would work, would it actually males sense with how the game is played?
---
So survivor is just one of those boxes where you have to fit the right piece in the right hole, except all the pieces are the same and the box has one massive hole everything fits into
---
These are great 👍 good job
---
I'm not saying no one has ever complained about it I'm just saying if you search BBQ and Chili or Nurses and you search up NOED you are going to see very different results. If you think people hate BBQ or Nurse's as much as NOED you are kidding yourself.
---
this is a nice idea but bond is better eventhough it has a limited range but 36(?) Meters should be pretty fine
---
Hey! Pharmacy is way better to get and have than trash self care where you sit and mend for the next 5mins in a corner, while I’m looping the killer and no gens are getting done!
---
ok
---
So on the flip side it would be cool for survivors to run keys every game.
---
Yeah, but it actually makes survivors survive.
---
Lol ebony moris might be fun for you but honestly they're unhealthy for the game and running them every game would be cancer.
---
The first time I tried to play nurse I couldn't lay but a couple of hits on the survivors. One of them reached the exit gates and instead of leaving he disconnected. THESE are the kind of players we need
---
But why is it taking a  part that doesnt exist for me?
---
kes lan sesini
---
It a tier 3 stalk perk. I think he has a pink add on? I'm not sure the specific terms of use but I think it's once the exit is open. Be careful out there 👀
---
She is easy, but not really easier than Trapper. He is just bad, not difficult.
---
They don't make it easy that's for sure
---
They're lurking in the dark, they will attack all together. They're trying to create an army so this is top secret information.
---
Any game that has multiplayer will always be toxic especially competitive ones. 
---
And yes you can make it to where you don’t see messages. 
---
You can look it up since I don’t know what you’re playing on.
---
Something to do. Basically a mini game.
---
that actually looks better .
---
Most often, I see people give killers a hard time for using Bamboozle. I don't know if you know this, but it makes for an easy follow up hit or pallet drop. I run perks that help me win, and if Bamboozle does that, I'm going to run it. With mindgames, the survivor has to actually stay at the unsafe pallet or window, and it doesn't save as much time as just getting rid of the window. Chases are designed to distract the killer. If I'm the killer, I want to spend as little time as possible being distracted. 
---
And as for getting rid of the window block mechanic, that'd make the perk almost useless, unless the vault speed were to be faster than a survivor's. Most windows are near a door that the killer can just go through already, but the window block is why people run it.
---
Wa*luigi sounds
---
I literally watched you stay in my chat for multiple games. Who are you trying to prove yourself to??? Like why lie?
---
No they don’t, it probably doesn’t help that I don’t gg every game. I feel like it sours the point of gg if it’s said on games that aren’t good. For me that just means if the match was fun, I’ll drop a gg, doesn’t matter if I win or lose.
---
The first one is a meme but the second one is genuinely close to what a real perk might be.
---
Oo good to noe 👍
---
Survivors can survive without keys. Killers can't actually kill with their own hands unless they have mori, or certain perks.
---
Lmao it just happened again, three survivors down the hatch. Thought it only spawned when two were left?
---
Exactly. You aren't hurting the killer by dcing, but if it helps you sleep at night be my guest.
---
Seriously. You can be only just decent at Spirit and still demolish survivors. Trapper requires much more to reach his maximum potential and there is a reason I hardly ever see them at red ranks. You know when a trapper is really good because the difference is huge. With Spirit? It's either sit in a corner and whiff or straight up broken.
---
It’s not the stun I’d wish they’d changed. I’m fine being punished for making a mistake, I think all killers should have something like that. The problem lies in his chainsaw never being able to connect without really good add-ons. They just need his chainsaw to be more connectable
---
Larry? You mean Bubba?
---
Not sure if you've heard of Google Stadia, but you may want to look into it if you want to be able to play new games on a shit PC.  
---
Of course, it doesn't release until november
---
It was announced at the three year anniversary event. I can't remember what they are exactly, but I think they are a means of accessing more information on the pasts of the survivors (and possibly killers too?).
---
You must be a camper killer. I’m not. I enjoy the hunt. Must suck to have to camp
---
I dont think ayylmaos fits this game at all
---
It doesn’t consume the offering. The devs changed the game so that if a survivor left then you won’t lose any add-one or offerings
---
Another camper killer. You give us actually skilled killers a bad name.
---
why don’t i have my offering anymore then?
---
I disagree. But it is what it is.
---
Grab a brush and put a little makeup
---
Wonder what the last guy is thinking.
---
I would just disable messages. No matter what game people are toxic nowadays.
---
You can report them for being rude. Simply don’t respond and just report them. Block them if they won’t leave you alone
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cfp7th/next_new_killer_confirmed/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
“Guess I’ll die”
---
The hatch has appeared at 3 survivors left in my games.
---
He means a pallet that’s been thrown down and hasn’t been broken 🤡
---
These sound like great perks in theory but if people would just stop teabagging in front of killers which means that the perk did its job well. The Survivor perk however could be used for exploits. Sometimes the Killer is left with no option. They have a hook in the basement and see the other three survivors with an open gate right outside the killer Shack. You know they have borrowed time and decisive strike. They are survive with friends and will keep you close until their friend is able to escape and then they will body block or use DS.
---
Honestly this game is ridden with toxic players so all I did was change who can send me messages to friends only so that way when I kill a group of swf or have that random hater they can’t even message me which makes them even madder so let them loathe in self pity! Enjoy the game and just set your messaging to friends only to avoid the toxicity.
---
So glad he got you with it. Trash
---
I have no idea why you are being downvoted. A chase against a spirit is a coin flip and not a mindgame; From the survivor perspective it is a guessing game but from the spirit perspective, she does not need to guess, she has so many information (scratch marks, sound, moving grass, collision while phasing... etc). 
---
She is not easy to master though.
---
it's called a tombstone and it essentially makes t3 a one touch kill, in exchange for making t3 take a long time to get and if youre not running the other ultra rare(infinite t3) it makes him lose a bunch of stalk energy so he tiers down quickly
---
Add “after 5 seconds” for staring contest so killer can actually leave the hook before you get stacks
---
They probably had that as their name because they know how to go against legion well so when people see that they go as legion then possibly lose because that person is good against them? For the other bit  people are just toxic in this game and think they are entitled to a win when they aren't also this game is a addiction for some so people  may hate the game but still play it.
---
Random really. It’s basically just a lottery of which 4 perks will be put on there. But if you want to wait fine by me.
---
Tombstone deserved.
---
are you speaking from experience as a huntress, or out of your ass?
---
This sub has more survivor mains than killers. Even then tunneling and camping is more of survivors complaining about killers. Killers don’t have to follow a rule book or have to play nice. And allow people to run away from unhooks and shit. Now tunneling has multiple meaning depends on who you ask. What a lot of people call tunneling, is the survivor being a dumbass and doing someshit like running into the killer after being unhooked. Campers get what they get.
---
Best thing to do is ignore and play on. One thing you need to do in this game is to play with nerves of steel whenever you’re faced with toxicity. Otherwise you’re in for a bad time.
---
Just have an opening narration that says “in the Fog, common sense and logic are removed as the Entity’s rules demand...” because I’m pretty sure one or two devs confirmed the entity just fucks with you making your mind not so smart as before in some areas but better in others. The fact you don’t pass out after being hooked twice in a row in the same spot kinda adds to that.
---
how tf they run 8 perks
---
If the devs always buffed the weakest killer because he/she are "the weakest" then life for survivors would be living hell
---
They should reduce it by a couple secounds tho
---
It'll spawn when one more gen is completed than there are remaining survivors left alive on the map.
---
No it’s not that “survivors can’t have nice things” it’s that you, just like the killer, have repercussions to your actions. It’s already easy  enough to pallet save, I don’t understand why you would complain about it in the first place it’s not like it changes anything
---
Honestly bright neon pink would work much better for him and it would be cool if he had Minecraft beacon on his head showing his location to everyone at all time's!!!
---
&gt; From my personal Survivor experience, which is about 20% of my DBD play time, I've been told that I shouldn't: loop, do generators too fast, use items, use addons, play in a SWF even without coms, break hex totems too soon, wear dark cosmetics, wear bright cosmetics, let a chase go on for too long, drop a pallet on the killer, flashlight stun, or use the following perks: Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, Balanced Landing, and Deliverance (these are more understandable because they're good and can turn a match/abuse maps) Breakdown (!), Unbreakable, Iron Will, Object of Obsession, We'll Make It, and in the most hilarious case, the Dwight Adept set since apparently that's op. 
---
I have never seen any killer main say that you shouldn't do it. Complaining about it: Yes. But forbidding it? No.
---
But if this is your experience, well ... okay?  
---
I see killers (me too) pointing out that SWFs in coms break the meta, but usually people are either frustrated about these groups or they blame bhrv for not fixing it.  
---
I've never seen any killer say: "You're toxic for running Iron Will. You should never run it."  
---
But to see posts like: "You're toxic for running NOED and you should never use it unless you're a rank 20 that can't play the game" you'll just have to read this subreddit every 2 days.
---
&gt;  I'm genuinely incredulous about the suggestion that Killers aren't complaining about things in post game chat with equal measure. 
---
From personal experience: They don't.
---
They DO complain. But not in equal measure.
---
&gt; I totally disagree the Killer victimhood mentality is justified. 
---
If we go by the rulebook example I see killers being the victim of survivors constantly telling them how to play the game.  
---
"Never go for the one that gets unhooked".
---
"Respect the 4%"
---
"Never run noed, it's for noobs only"
---
"Never camp, only noobs and baby killers camp."
---
I've seen killers complaining about gen rushing and looping, but I've never seen a killer telling a survivor how to play the game. "First you have to cleanse a totem and search atleast 2 chests before working on a gen" or something similiar.
---
That's why the rulebook parody is so funny and accurate.
---
Because survivors telling a killer how to play the game is pretty much what happens every day.
---
Just a few days ago someone asked here: "I am new to DbD and a lot of people say that killers do a lot of toxic stuff. What is toxic here?"  
---
And holy shit there were lots of highly upvoted survivor-favoring responses to his question which didnt made any sense from a killer pov.
---
"Never run a mori. It's toxic."  
---
"Don't run ruin unless you're in red ranks."  
---
"Never slug."  
---
"If the survivors played nice you have to gift the hatch."  
---
I am sitting there shaking my head and asking myself if people are really that unable to see any kind of bias there.  
---
Just mention that camping has its pros in some situations and your response will be at -12 karma within minutes.
---
&gt; not whine about the ones I can't 
---
This is a balance issue though. I've seen Tru3Talent talk about this. He said something along the lines of (Which I fully agree on)  
---
"There are a lot of weak killers that hit a limit in red ranks. Like sometimes when you lose as wraith and you know that you've played everything perfectly, but you've still lost."
---
Not sure if I am making my point clear here. The game has been favoring survivors for ages. It still does.  
---
It's now more balanced than ever, but there are a lot of killer related topics like hex spawns, majority of killers, some almost-infinite loop spots, not mindgam'able pallets and more which needs some adressing.  
---
Killers should be able to speak out and point at this instead of: "Stop whining. Just improve."
---
BUT generally speaking I agree with your approach. You should allways be self-critical if you want to improve.
---
&gt; If I allow that to bother me beyond the match, it's because I've made a choice to do so. 
---
No No, I would hardly disagree here.
---
This is 100% emotional. You can't just decide for something not to bother you.  
---
If you cry because you lost someone, you don't tell that person: "You are deciding to be sad right now. Just don't be sad."  
---
Some people deal with this better than others. I have a thick skin when it comes to toxicity, because of playing LoL, Warcraft, CS, Starcraft, DotA and more.  
---
But there are lots of people who have problems dealing with toxicity. And I wouldn't victim-blame here.
---
&gt; but it being more likely does not make it justified. 
---
Why not? If my point is that killers are way more often the victim of toxicity, they should be able/allowed to speak from the perspective of the victim in that certain scenario.
---
If we talk about T-Bagging for example it's going to be 99% about survivors t-bagging killers, 0,9% about Ghostface and maybe 0,1% Pig.
---
Ooohhh gotcha, had no idea
---
autodidact really is a good perk
---
“Tierd”
---
It would be nice to see that fight between that one survivor and a killer though, I’ve only heard about it but apparently one of the survivors tried (emphasis on tried) to fight back against a killer, but only slightly damaged the killer since the Entity enhances the powers of all it’s killers.
---
I was going to say, just make it if a survivor is in the same area the buff won't hit the survivor
---
Neat
---
Mark a hex totem/gen you're working on.
---
They can already do that, changing the time on a pallet save doesn’t do anything it just makes it easier
---
Oh it's an Anthony Fantano reference. He's the source of the audio.
---
It does work wdym
---
I did, he didnt grab me
---
But only when I'm about to die, like if I get hooked again the entity will just kill me.
---
I can't wait for OVERCHARGED to appear again, that's my favorite flavor.
---
-50 Groove Points for BL
---
Just to spite MTV for making Scream season 3 a VH1-exclusive, they make a season about Jed Olsen.
---
DCing doesn't hurt the killer (shy of bloodpoints) it just screws over your teammates. I try to lobby-dodge them if I'm a survivor but with queue times what they are screw it.
---
Premonition to know roughly where the Killers location is, and Spine Chill to know if he’s coming to the Gen I’m at
---
Are you under the assumption huntress throwing hatches at pallets is a secret
---
&gt; Any game that has multiplayer will always be toxic especially competitive ones.
---
Honneslty i think some games have more toxic communities than others. I do think the toxicity of the survivors toward the killers is really up there on toxicity levels...
---
As a basic example i rarely had much toxicity when i played games like PUBG.
---
What’s moonwalk? Ya gotta go backwards by shifting your survivor’s view between left and right and keeping it backwards so thy don’t fully turn around?
---
I know BBQ is a must for making tier 3 more useful after hooking someone, i've considering purchasing leatherface, i've tried him using his bone splinters and he seems like a lot of fun but i heard he isn't viable in higher ranks due to survivors dodging his ability easily.
---
Basically
---
I was in the exact same boat a few weeks ago - I used Prove Thyself in almost every game. Someone mentioned to me that it doesn’t get gens done more quickly, it just maxes out your Objective points category faster, which is what convinced me to try experimenting with other perks in its place. Although the extra BP was sweet, the perk was also really conditional since sometimes in games, no one would hop on the gen as me. 
---
I do a lot of survivor solo-queueing, so I’ve found Resilience and This Is Not Happening to be really helpful for speeding gens along during the games where you’re just constantly injured and unable to heal for whatever reason.
---
Not anymore! It *used* to be possibly bannable prior to a recent update within the EAC (Easy Anti-Cheat) client that DBD uses as it noticed editing within any game files, but now the EAC only bans edits to the pak files, which are basically the core systems that run the game, so you're all good to change anything within the **UI** (user interface) files!
---
It's still only during match. You cant break 8000 maximum with it, unlike WGLF which is post game, meaning every category doubles after the game granting above the maximum
---
“Lmao what kinda idiot actually gets caught in a tr- AAAAAAAAUGH”
---
Then what am I going to say to survivors with left behind?
---
Shut the fuck up. You cant have a semblence of a sense of humor on this sub without some armchair intellectual one side purist telling you why you're wrong. Fuck off.
---
Happy cake day! I'm not ever stopping, tea bagging is an ancient art 😹
---
I honestly thought he was mad because I was new and he was trying to seem like he was superior because he had more 'experience'. He even said "no one is gonna carry u"
---
Sorry you had bad experiences and no one will carry you, buddy. He was pathetic tbh.
---
Thank you!
---
Really? Lmfao. I'd be petty and keep them on but I won't.
---
As long as I get a good amount of bloodpoints I’m happy to not pip. Pipping is too easy anyway. I’m currently back to rank 5 and I’m yet to safety or depip
---
Ooooo, I'd like that for sure! Probably would be a lot friendlier to being stealthy, and would still bring a cool little feature at the same time.
---
No they shouldn't because players will always find a way around any sort of system put in place.  If this went out right now the tea bagging survivors would find something else to do.  Like holding crouch and looking straight up after pallet slamming you, or of course the classic flashlight spam.
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one that did a double take at the amount of hours lol
---
I mention in my post that I use PS4. :)
---
True, but every game has a level of saltiness. This game, I'd so far rate 3/10 because everyone else I played with was decent.
---
\*takes notes\* okay so dress and act like a sweet lil Dwight
---
This. If I'm likely gonna depip ( or I made my pip but clearly not gonna get a double) I dont struggle on second hook. I feel good inside knowing I didn't lose anything I likely wasn't going to lose anyway and a good chance I denied the killer a double pip unless they go real hard for it. I move on to try for my next pip or double pip quicker while the killer suffers. BP is not a factor I still have 29 mil from error 302.
---
Lol! That's great
---
Hmm... maybe when the reversed beartrap is in its final moments before exploding, make the Saw theme play? (Though it'd cost more than it does now \~licence)
---
Holy crap 120,000 hours?
---
so hard to tell the difference between a consistent 300 ping and a situation where the connection is completely cut off for 15 seconds? do u even know which one of them is considered a lag switch dude. that's what op gets for queueing up against someone from the other side of the globe
---
Ohh thanks, very helpful!
---
This could have ended so bad because of that bodyblock.
---
*It's time for another fucking crusade*
---
It’s what she deserves ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I hope he keeps his chainsaw tho
---
I’m assuming this is sarcasm 😂
---
From what I can remember, 3 of us spawned in a room that had a generator in it, so we worked on it since it seemed like a lucky place to spawn it. Killer came in when we were just done and I was the first to run. I don't know why he flamed me instead of the others who sat there and took a sec to process. I don't know what to learn from that, except not to help with generators. I forgot the Survivors name but she had a perk that helped with repairing generators and made sure it was done quietly, so I thought I was Jesus for a couple of minutes. Guess not?
---
I have no idea what terms you're mentioning because like I said, I'm new, but hopefully I'll learn sometime, aha.
---
If he;s rank 19 it can;t be rank reset...
---
You feel good knowing you screwed your teamates over by killing yourself early and also hurt the killers ability to rank up potentially?  Yikes dude that is dickhead 101 for both sides.
---
Thx bud
---
In the lobby, i enjoy looking up the channels of people with the .ttv names. I warn them that they will be face camped and the salty mutes are always hilarious.
---
Really like the idea for the Venus fly trap because it would add alot of risk but reward I feel for the idea to be better it should be one specific survivor instead of everyone having a chance of the key to make more balanced because you could just have one teammate injure everyone then you're kinda screwed. Good ideas though as it would add variety and Lord knows we need it.
---
How often do you play killer because like holy shit 4man teams make me want to D i E
---
I love dead harding into walls, sick plays
---
Platform: PS4
---
Bug type: in game
---
Bug Description: Survivors outlines can be seen in the auras of generators, hooks, etc..
---
Steps to reproduce: Look at a generator if someone is on it you should be able to see them.
---
"When the hell did I run into Michael Myers??? Uhmmm..."
---
I should try that, aha. Sounds like a fun fest.
---
Reverse Bear Trap, Pig's Power
---
Boi I literally cannot tell your comment apart from any other person either joking or being genuinely serious. You can only express so much when you’re only using text
---
The hatch appears when repaired gens&gt;living survivors. It will appear when all gens are completed, no matter what. Each dead survivor decreases the number of finished gens required by one.

I felt nostalgic last night and went through some old formats.

Nice job. :) Photoshop?
---
I do have nerves of steel; I play LOL \[the salty goldmine\] and I don't let things in there bother me, but when watching videos of DBD gameplay I thought the community was great because I saw nothing similar to toxicity. It was more of a surprise then anything. And who the fuck bullies new players? Helping them instead of calling them names is more beneficial.
---
I turned my fr's and my pm's off. 
---
Or “Hear me: activates microphone, players within a 4 meter distance can hear you speak if you have a mic”
---
By playing effectively and efficiently. Being good at the game and outplaying your opponent is abuse.
---
:) no problem
---
Is that community really that sensitive? Ugh.
---
Yikes you're a dick. Hurting the killer and your teammates just because you don't care and want to be an ass.
---
They should make the duration an entire minute so you can use it as intended without it just dying after 10 seconds
---
Yeah it is, you just gotta be groovy instead of a little bitch to get it.
---
It doesnt. Everytime they got the hatch there was one gen left that needed repair and 3 survivors alive
---
My favourite dead hard plays is when i use it and go down exhausted
---
Thanks, man. I honestly thought that they nerfed movement speed xD and i was about to quit this game and uninstall it lmao!
---
I fixed my controller by blowing on it though... xD
---
Not at all. I don't watch streamers for that reason. I watch the ones that I watch because they're entertaining and/or knowledgeable about the games they're playing. You're neither and that's why I said that the chat "loves" you.
---
Just be a trap killer every time you get Haddonfield :) Just leave every chase :)
---
Chat loved seeing me get rekt because it was out of the blue. It was a brutal scene! Nothing to do with my gender. I hope you can overcome your incel-like thoughts. Not everyone panders to horny men on Twitch. Best of luck friendo
---
When your mindgames are so strong, they even work on you.
---
On the reworked map, there are more pallets, but the loops are shorter, so it makes for more skill based chases and less running in a circle.
---
I know that they're probably going to be improved, but after seeing the testing period I really don't have high hopes for the dedicated servers lol
---
I dislike this streamer
---
not exactly. 
---
The minimum number of possible spawns hasnt changed, just the range at which they can spawn. It's RNG.
---
I didn't say you pandered to them either. I just said that's why they're watching you. They're watch you even without you pandering.
---
Just more pallets closer together doesn't mean we will see more as they have a limit, change is more so to give survivors more of a chance instead of being in a dead zone and getting downed
---
Empathy shows u where the other players are. This perk shows others where you are
---
Thanks. I blocked messages and I decline friend requests from now on unless I know they're not gonna pull a sneaky on me. Hopefully this gets better for me. :)

Just disable messages and try to improve
---
Idk that skin, but it sounds right
---
he actually pops now, made me realize just how muted his colours are
---
I thought so too, but it started happening most games and I don't touch WASD when I'm getting healed.
---
Oh ok, that makes sense
---
Clearing out your fat mama's feeding trough.
---
You deserved it honestly. This is why people say survivors are too toxic. If the match is over and you won, leave. Let the match end so everyone can get into a new match. Stop teabagging and being a general asshole. There's is literally no reason to do that, other than to be a jerk.
---
U can have fun trying to win haha
---
Pallets aren't viable against a Spirit at all. Your only two options are to A) run/walk away or B) camp/drop the pallet immediately. Both options result in a loss a good 90% of the time if the Spirit player decides to simply stand still and wait to see what you do. At best you'll force her to break the pallet, at which point she can simply phase right to you again and down you.
---
I'll be honest, I've seen a lot of bad Spirit players in the past. There is some truth to your statement. But as someone who almost exclusively mains killer and plays Spirit the most out of any other character: she's busted.
---
Awesome. Punishing toxic behavior cant go wrong lol
---
Lol I know it wasn’t you and I was letting you and everyone else know that I’m not that annoying little shit who bully’s the killer
---
Don't forget Ryan gosling. Canada has the monopoly on great actors named ryan.

What, any girl on Twitch is only being watched because she's a girl? That's ridiculous. Maybe in the just chatting or the asmr sections but in the gaming parts that's not true. That's such a gross way of thinking.
---
This works with team heals too. You can max altruism very quickly with prove thyself.
---
If you're wasting the killers time, you're buying time for gens. Simple as that.
---
If you are playing with your friends u can do that
---
This. His black outfit should be black and his white outfit should be white. The Red and blue could be solid colors too.
---
All the grey he has now really messes with his look IMO.
---
I didn't even consider it bm until I came into this subreddit. I did it hoping for the extra escape points. And I'll still do it I dont think it's a big deal. Its not like I'm messaging them anything nasty, they get extra hit points and I get extra escape points
---
This is wrong. Please check the wiki or any other discussion about this if you would like to confirm that.
---
Good thing to mention the movement speed cap, imagine T-bagging the killer so much he can go from one side of the map to the other within a second as long as he initiates the chase. Which of course would make chasing the actual survivor impossible because as soon as the chase begins you *ZOOOOOOMMM* all the way to the other side of the map, way past your target.
---
Yeah I was impressed by how good she was at finding traps that were in terrible locations, I had a good laugh after the 2nd/3rd chase
---

---
Yup. It’s easily the most toxic gaming community I’ve been a part of. 
---
It’s still my favorite game of all time, though. You get used to the people pretty quickly.
---
Again, no. THOSE type of people will watch you regardless is what I'm saying. And those are the same type of people that would say they loved you getting wrecked, instead of the truth and telling you to stop being toxic and leave. That's what a true fan/friend would say.
---
I know because I stream and a few of my friends stream. And our viewers will tell us we're being assholes if we're being assholes.
---
Lmao pumped up kicks
---
I heard they aren't doing a full overhaul like with Freddy, but some changes like with the Legion balance.
---
let this dumbass camp, ez points and escape for us :)
---
Honestly, awesome! Get the devs in here!
---
I always do all the bones :)
---
That’s not what happened tho. He literally said that a survivor left and he got the entity displeased
---
Just no
---
At least this'll be fixed soon, and then everyone with potato connections will only have themselves to blame.
---
Dead Harding into my arms so i can splapp you!
---
But why would it be a bit much? Plz explain
---
I mean theres a difference between teabagging in a chase to taunt the killer, and teabagging because you're about to DC like that. I don't think it was supposed to taunt, just going with the meme.
---
That would actually be really nice, it’s been getting pretty dirty and I’d like to prevent any possible disease. How thoughtful of you.
---
I got tired of saying it every 30 seconds. They stop doing anything to go hide every time they see or hear the killer even if he's chasing someone else. Then if he's nowhere near them they'll be doing some dumb shit like doing chests or dull totems etc. lol
---
Why not?
---
I’m going back and fourth with some fucker Rn after he accused me of sandbagging him smh ...
---
If u can’t handle the hate mail just change ur privacy settings. IMO toxic messages are all part of the game I don’t send them out but if I get one I definitely respond 😂
---
It’s not tunneling if they were unhooked right in front of you imo. Why should you take a chance at hitting the new guy twice when you can guarantee a hit on the dying guy?
---
Thats amazing nice work!
---
When did I say it was so often? No matter how good of a killer you are, you'll hit a tree when getting looped 1-5% of the time. This is to make it so when you get stunned you don't automatically lose 20+ seconds from being stunned/catching up to the survivor.
---
Don't get too salty just cause someone who has played the game for a month is better than you.
---
Thanks for downvoting my opinion after I brought up a good point?
---
r/lostredditors
---
Survivor with Iron Will be like when struck "Huh, what's that sound?".
---
God playing Bubba in ranks 14+ is so fun. Everyone's so bad at saving that they flame you for camping, when you see two of them right on your ass when you hook someone. That just makes it so much sweeter when you down all of them with one chainsaw swing
---
This brought me great joy.
---
?
---
"EEEEEEEEE-"
---
We have to literally appeal to them just so they won't be toxic
---
Thanks! I had to think about em for a bit, since I decided to make up perks that would actually be cool in game.
---
They'd have to get permission from Charlie Clouser.
---
I think this fits pretty accurately
---
You're gonna rub yourself raw jerking yourself off like this. 
---
But alright Sport, you're the best killer there is.
---
This pretty good, but people will probably adapt to this and swf can counter this easily
---
I was just trying to get Nurse's teachables and I ran into so much toxicity because I sucked as nurse. It's weird how these asshat survivors will teabag and bully killers who are really bad but I don't see any of this when I play a killer I'm good at.
---
I didn't. Someone upvoted me and downvoted you. Welcome to reddit, it's dumb.
---
If my games with this are like all my other games, no one will come anyway :(
---
I think the teabagging one should only affect the survivor who did it. It would be horrible if one person threw the game by teabagging and helping the killer.
---
Toxic survivors BTFO
---
I just finished grinding bubba for bbq.
---
God,that sucked.
---
Bloodthirster Annie? Crutch item
---
I just got on this sub to rant about killers who camp. It's happening too often 🙄
---
Im the one who should be sad. Microsoft gotta work on these MF "upload to Xbox live" thing
---
camping is incomparable with teabagging though
---
You don't have to play her for teachables but I figured I might as well since she was what I was spending all my BP on. I never got more than a 1k and only got hate :( that's awesome though I'm glad there were some people actually worth playing with

You could have gotten your point across without being a tool
---
Because would you be ok not being able to play the game just because your teammate is a sandbagging dummy?

Contrary to popular belief, noed is completely chair. Everyone just chooses to gen rush and ignore dull totems.

---
Yeah, if you get a game where the killer downed everyone and decides to be a dick and bleeds everyone out for 2 minutes instead of hooking anyone, I think you should have the right to dc and not get punished by it.
---
If you queue up to a match, in the lobby the ping appears alright but once you are in the game it's super laggy and you physically can't play the game, you should be able to dc from that match without getting punished.
---
If you are vs hostage doc you should be allowed to dc without getting punished.
---
If you get stuck in one spot because of x glitch, you should be allowed to dc without getting punished.
---
Making every DC be punishable will severely hurt player experience and will probably make a lot of players quit the game.
---
Trapper: lol idiots stepped in my dumbest traps, how can they be so bli- *snap* UGH
---
Seems a little underwhelming, killers that run enduring/spirit fury would completely make the perk useless. Not too powerful, i personally wouldnt use it.
---
You’re just being annoying i’d say the mute is warranted
---
I don't know how I got here, but fuck you Dwight! You're going on a hook!
---
noed is for faggots
---
with the build you have in mind spirit would probably be more your speed. clown is more so just ending loops early with the gas where as with spirit you can mind game and have the potential to avoid getting looped altogether. PGTW would benefit spirit more due to phase walk which gives a her a decent amount of map pressure allowing you to use it more frequently than with clown. as for a fourth perk slot spirit also has a tiny bit more flexibility. in my experience as survivor spirit greatly benefits from MYC, again do to her better mobility.
---
I wouldn't put clown as viable in high ranks, spirit on the other hand is top2 (or 3, depending who you ask). So if you want a strong killer go with spirit. 
---
You are also a lot more versatile with her when it comes to perk, since she doesn't need perks that help woth chasing.
---
Pgtw is good no question, but in terms of gen slowing nothing beats ruin sadly.
---
Does the speed buff apply to survivors that Ghostface repeatedly crouches in front of?
---
Weird.  On PS4 it takes 2 quick button presses to screenshot anything.
---
I mean realistically, as the killer I don’t care. I’m trying to win not give the guy a handicap because his teammate is dumb... If the smartest move is downing the same guy, that’s what I’m gonna do.
---
Unless the person on the hook is an insufferable cunt I always let the survivors lure me away with a chase. I actively encourage the behavior.
---
The people who don't run away always confused me.
---
I am giving you free points dammit! Run!
---
I'm talking from a survivor standpoint. At the end of the day, you're getting pixels on a screen and that's it. Why not let everyone have fun?
---
Yeah it’s normal to feel like that, you’ll just get to a point where you start to not care and do whatever you want
---
Im sorry for any damage that this piece of shit can cause. First try at the Virgin vs Chad memes, wasted so much of my life.
---
You’d think those kinds of posts fall under rules 3 and 8
---
I’ve seen way too many of those posts
---
I think people get way too upset over this, think about why its upsetting you in the first place? Is it because somebody miles away is shifting over and over, or because we can't laugh anymore at something like this
---
It's an optical illusion, measured it lackadaisically on my finger.
---
Can relate, and I'm the killer side. "This team looks fishy, I think they're up to something. Better get a mori, if it's nothing I'll just mori deathhooks". And then there's a secret, and a map offering... Yep, I felt it.
---
No sympathy here lady
---
&gt; it's literally bannable
---
BHVR would have to actually give a shit about moderating their game in order for it to be bannable.
---
“I’m getting tired of your shit.”
---
That’s tough. Playing with friends that have zero game sense can be annoying but cheer up at least you enjoy their company.
---
Just checked the wiki it says that it stops at 100% for ALL accumulative healing bonuses.

---
Then the hook time lasts twice as long whenever you’re 6 meters from them or looking at them within 12 meters. It has counters like moonwalking up to the hook to reduce the time, but it would incentivize people to not camp as hard.
---
Mildly interesting: 120.000 hours are in fact exactly 5000 days.
---
This perk has a lot of potential to for example signal the survivors to the exit gate. I think the perk would be better when it can be used multiple times with a 3/4 minute cooldown
---
eZ.
---
Reading these comments I feel like OP recently went up against me as Spirit lol.

1:I’m not lying and it would ave been impossible to know you were on the hex with your steam delay and 2:I’m trying to protect myself from your allegations
---
With the amount of delay on Twitch, if you’re getting stream sniped, you suck. 
---
99% of the time Steam sniping is a streaming being salty about being bad
---
You should be maxxed out with the doc Everytime
---
I said headphones.
---
it's because tbagging is a dick move and it's single purpose is to upset the other person. is  do you really think that's ok?
---
Instead of actual buffs on these we should just have extra blood points. This will make it so people can gloat but don’t piss anyone off?
---
Ugh please no, it's going to turn even more people away from the game. I hate dc'ing as much as the next person but BHVR are already notoriously awful at handing out bans with no communication. A 1 day ban for 1 dc is really excessive. Just make it a timeout in the queue system like Overwatch has. Way more fair and it DOES put people off of leaving games for the most part.
---
They don't work together. You can't go beyond 100 percent healing speed bonus.
---
Ty ^^
---
Dunno what that is.
---
Exactly, have you played a match past rank 15 recently
---
I'll be honest, I only run across it immediately after rank reset. People get absolutely venomous for about a week or two after. I've kinda just stopped playing during that time, since it's not fun to be treated like that.
---
As a player of both, I would say this game is worse.
---
That percent reminds me of ratchet and clank up your arsenal.
---
Yeah my problem with some of my kills is that a guy gets unhooked and I run to the hook. Then I just see the guy there standing still and you know that meme that’s like “it was at this moment that he knew. He effed up” meme? Yeah I just hear that in the back of my brain as I hit them.
---
But you do...
---
“i’m getting sick of your shit” sounds like it could have been said by any killer
---
You are asserting the only meta perks are dlc but they aren't. I have 1000+ hours on this game and have been rank 1 killer and survivor with tier 2 perks before. It doesn't matter what perks you have (to an extent) if you can mind game the killer and play effectively. I'm not just saying get good either.
---
Can you read that other guy's comment? I think the man had a stroke while typing and went way off topic. But no, I'm a lot more experienced with this game than most of the people on here.
---
Down with the thiccness
---
Tbh if u unhook right in front of my im going to wait for your friend to come off the hook and get downed isntantly
---
Because I know it pisses off the killer is why I do it.. it's my way of giving you the middle finger at the exit gate... it's like bitch you thought you were gonna get me..
---
The game runs smooth in console so I don't know if that trope is relevant anymore. Huntress at launch though? Ugh
---
this is one of the funniest things i’ve seen on here so far
---
When you're not allowed to say anything critical of anything because "Well U card enuogh to make a coment!!1" *drooling*
---
I like the idea, however, I imagine that would increase shit talking messages
---
In that context I'm pretty sure it means awesome in the sense something is "awe inspiring" or derives a lot of awe from it, not so much the way we use awesome in modern day.
---
Lol you're bit slow... I named all the perks I see in red ranks any of those perk combos is what ya get in red ranks ya dig?

Mhmm. In hindsight I should of provided a link to the source audio....

As I Nea player, I used to be a toxic virgin, but then I went into rehab, and now I have my flair to remind me of what shame I once bore.

I wish the cute clothes weren’t considered toxic. I wear the blue feng pigtails and skirt with her sweater bc I think it is adorable :( I may die but at least I look cute.....

Wait a few weeks. Rank reset just happened, it basically adds 10 to everyones rank. So the 12 you were against was probably a rank 5 or 6.
---
Ty for adding this!
---
get dunked on
---
I do not have the necessary to use the APP through the phone, the annoyance for me is the loading time, if you wish bad things happen to me then i believe i have nothing more to say
---
Noed isn't overpowered, just cleanse totems. 
---
:)
---
Witch hunting is bannable.
---
Please stop.
---
I suggest going after perks as the first thing you do, you’ll have to weigh which ones you want at one point though because sometimes you get two perks in one web.
---
*Can* you even stream snipe? Pretty sure matchmaking is random.
---
Dude, I always use two perks in every single loadout, one is self-care and the other is bond. I feel like bond is extremely underrated, it makes me know where my teammates are so I always avoid bringing the killer near them unless they're close to the only loop or pallet available, and that's just one of its many uses. It's so true though, you always see them bringing the killer to them because it's not their problem but complain when the same is done to them.
---
Yeah, I was trying to get the NOED first thing lol
---
I think I had a stroke reading this, wtf.
---
My name is Evan MacMillan. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of MacMillan estate, where all the pallets are, and I am not married. I work as an assistant for my father in our own mining business, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally eat pallets. I'm near campfire by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a look at Jane's butt and polishing my cleaver before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until daylight. Just like Dwight, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were pallet pieces in my body at my last entity check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care to trouble myself with any survivors I see, pleasing the entity brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone. Except P3 Claudettes and toxic Neas
---
Theres also another mindgame besides just hurting the survivors you’re could do with that; using it on a hooked person if you are hidden would destroy teamwork, as you could make them think that their teammates are toxic.
---
I just want to take a picture of your comment and frame it. 
---
You are defending instasaw, saying that you can just leave the loop vs bloodlust (you will just get hit) and other amazing ideas. I'm done here, I can't help you. You go and have a good life.
---
I'm conflicted because I feel like I waited too long and I might as well hold out for the next gen console at this point. On the other hand, I almost exclusively play dbd so it might be worth it regardless.
---
Would be dope. Could help players focus on improving their gameplay in specific areas.
---
Yikes man
---
Delete this
---
OK i'll simplify
---
Im wrong and Im lazy
---
Jake and Claudette getting their picture taken together! Thats nice.
---
yes, I get that people can consider it rude, but when you get upset over it, you're giving them the reaction they want
---
I don’t think it should be active on hooked players. Seems pointless. I’m also the guy who prefers things stay nice and not rude for all parties involved.
---
It's from Metal Gear Rising.
---
&gt;NOED is OP and broken and there is literally 0 you can do against that perk and killers are shitty and toxic noobs for using it" posts.
---
Those posts don't exist. Whenever legit reasons are given for why Noed is bullshit, the counterplay is acknowledged and then is explained in finer detail why it doesn't matter
---
Honestly same, it is bad that some clothing are now linked to toxic and tryhards, especially Neas and Claudettes. I love them both, but can't use them without making the other players think that I will be a toxic asshole.
---
I think that's intended.
---
It be like this
---
Would be an insta buy for me not gonna lie
---
This would make an absolutely banger tshirt with some DBD themed typography!
---
Agreed
---
Not really, only 1 or 2 today. But the fact that spirit requires no skill is painful apparent to anyone with a slight amount of common sense.
---
The Halloween Dwight outfit (HE LOOKS CUTE OK)
---
Punk David but with green Mohawk instead of the fedora 
---
Ash in regular outfit but puppet hand 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
As meg, dont worry, escape, i will ve faster, the killer will not follow you!
---
Thx m8
---
Same
---
I'll also accept an RJ MacReady survivor
---
That feng thought you had read the rulebook, it clearly states that because meg and/or claudette left, you, the killer, had to play nice.
---
Getting into a specific streamers lobby is kinda impossible anymore with the new matchmaking lobbies.
---
It's still a dick move by the killer and what else is he supposed to do it's the objective. It's like the killer letting someone almost crawl to the hatch and closing it right before. It's not necessary.
---
This isn’t related but im watching that harry potter movie rn and the scene just came up.
---
Fake af and I've heard things about his dog
---
billy tried

So uhh, object of obsession?
---
Ahktually, that’s a line from “Stains of Time”, “It Has to be This Way” is Senator Armstrong’s theme.  And furtherm-... hang on, my “quit being a massive twat” alarm is going off.  BRB, please enjoy this upvote while I’m gone.
---
It's still fun, I just don't expect to escape often lol
---
Ok but spongebob is showing the good things
---
Ah, okay.
---
Good to see you're still an idiot, sassy.
---
Busted because survivors lose the power role? Nice.
---
I think if those are your only out in a Chase then they should be multi use since burning would be similar to the blead out timer that was nerfed
---
The origin of 420 was some college kids in california trying to get others to join their love hitler club. Hitler's birthday is 420 which is why they chose that number so go ahead and continue their tradition just know that I will have nothing to do with it except bring awareness to it's origin.
---
What’s dodging ds
---
Me, as meg: *inserit meme quote jnto gg and nice job you cool killer
---
Just dont tbag. What's so fuckin difficult about that?
---
I didn’t realize my eyes could throw up until after I read this.
---
Interesting!!
---
If you queue up around the same time as them you have a chance, give or take how imbalanced queues are.
---
These should be built in mechanics. Fuck the perks
---
Tired***
---
Akshukally pigs power is called jigsaws bruhtism and includes the amBush(did9/11) attack ass well.
---
Are you mad bro?  Only idiot I see is you! Coming on my post and insulting me for no reason... cute
---
I meant it's going to have a map and a survivor + killer.
---
Lmao, it’s also a GAME, you’re meant to have fun my dood, and it’s not fun when you get tunneled, hell, when I play killer I don’t tunnel because it’s just not fun.
---
Dodging decisive strike by letting him slug just a little bit
---
how about just the ability to manually cancel the chainsaw early. every time you even manage to make the lucky play where you chainsaw someone you have to spend 8 seconds sawing the air above their body before you can pick them up, negating any advantage from downing them early
---
...
---
Yeah that’s a dick move.
---
I never even realized this was ghost face. I always thought he was scream.
---
What's moonwalk you ask? 
---
This is moonwalk

https://youtu.be/b6pomaq30Gg
---
dude its your console res settings. Doesnt mean the game is 4k. DBD runs at 1080p on the pro
---
I'm sure it's easier, but i'm pretty sure with the money a stranger things chapter would make and how much more exposure it'd give DBD it'd be worth it rather than an original killer that was designed like that.
---
Hahaha dude don’t mind him i dodge ds all the time
---
Esplain
---
Unbreakable is the new anti tunnel perk
---
I see you don't know what is survivors rulebook for killers
---
The one we have in game with the weird gray color makes him look like a medieval Archer or Rogue. He does not look like he's from the past 300 years century and it annoys me. He's actually buting doctor and becoming my least favorite killer in the game. Doesn't help that I've never liked Ghostface to begin with
---
Not with the Borrowed Time effect on her, no.
---
Literally just had the immersed claudette in my last game .
---
fun fact, his absurd neck is actually a reference to his worm form from dream warriors /s
---
then you don't DC correctly dude
---
Try r/dbdLFG/
---
https://dbd.onteh.net.au/
---
You can snipe killers fairly easily if you're at high ranks, survivors not so much.
---
I like the camera shot because it makes me feel like they're a cute noob (:
---
Of all the keys you could have chosen you picked M?
---
I prefer to heal myself whenever possible, I use bond for pretty much everything else like not give away survivors when in a chase so they can repair in peace, go assist a teammate with a gen for extra coop points rather than doing two separate ones, not running into them as accidental sandbagging and general knowledge of what everyone is doing so I make better decisions on my own while playing solo. It's true that it may seem a bit redundant but it seems like every time I take self-care out I get downed while looking for someone to heal me and I'm not comfortable repairing and playing in general while injured. Just personal preference I guess.
---
Basically there's the book, then the real old original, then John Carpenter's remake, then a cgi prequel to the remake. I haven't seen the true original, but the John Carpenter one's pretty great.
---
That’s not how it works. If you wanted the bloodpoints you’d have to buy the Clown, get the teachable in his bloodweb, and then pay shards to get it off the shrine
---
every “welcoming” discord community is trigger happy with the ban button
---
Because thats not how it works
---
Really? Leatherface seems like a million times harder to me than Wraith is. LF feels like his power has very little benefit compared to the ways it can turbofuck you, with its hyperstun and getting caught on everything.
---
"not taking a 5 sec stun which the surv doesnt actually have to do anything for is a dick move"
---
???
---
Nope, the last one is not a parody to anyone, its more like an extreme exageration. I just took dwight because I needed a legacy survivor and Meg is a female while Jake is kinda not known as toxic.
---
Happened to me the other day....I was so ashamed
---
Reported to the mods for personal attacks.
---
I only think it'll be later because we first heard about ghostface coming to dbd a year before it actually happened. It sounds like this is later in the process than that but I still wouldn't expect it to be soon at all.
---
BHVR, please.
---
Oh yeah league is definitely top of the line toxic. A whole new brand of toxicity lol. Yeah this game has is moments but it’s really so much fun and  a lot of people in the community are great so it makes up for it. Enjoy!
---
the risk is that your team dies and you lose (plus lose your newfound item) because you weren’t working on gens/primary objectives/looping and instead were looting chests. the reward is that you obtain a useful item. considering literally every other item in the game for both survivor and killer is positive and useful at least to some degree the green key is somewhat inconsistent and out of place as a pointless tool. i also don’t understand why you feel the need to be a stuck up asshat just because i implored about your thought process and disagreed with you.
---
That’s fair
---
Ooga booga teabag bad
---
Competition is in everyone bruv. You sound just as silly as you're thinking everyone else is for wanting to win.
---
Thats part of the comedy. Anything the virgin does is exagerated to be bad, whereas chad is good. Finally, Lad is so good it becomes bad.
---
You get mad because that survivor is better than you, that got nothing to do with teabagging. You still get to move around and strategize against a teabagger, against 3 campers in a row you gonna sprain your finger and can't play no more.
---
Lol yep my first few games on nurse went like that so I’m like nope nope I don’t want to practice and get in a bad mood. 
---
So I’m probably never going to play nurse again lol. 
---
Good luck to you on your journey!
---
Do you t-bag? Many killers seem to camp survivors who t-bag, so if u do it it might explain why it happens so often. Not that I’m certain u do it, just a theory.
---
&gt;It does not matter what killer I play it does not matter what perks I bring, this is a problem that needs to be addressed.
---
"this is a problem that needs to be addressed"
---
This almost sounds like they haven't been intensively meddling with MM for the past months.
---
I'm actually the Hillbilly in this photo.....
---
I mean, I guess, but matchmaking is bonk whether you play against SWF or not.
---
Do you mean Larryface ?
---
Literally, too
---
Squadette.
---
They'd kinda not work well at all though. Deliverance is 100% once it's active so staring contest would be useless there.
---
and then on PC it's because you're playing  one of the easiest killers in DBD and not because it's hard to play Nurse
---
You can want to win all you want but that doesn't mean you have to ruin everyone else's fun
---
Read the second half
---
Is that a gun?
---
Yeah iam killer rank 12 ATM and that guy was rank 8, and got mad cuz I dodged his friends ds
---
Ignore them.  Toxic people are in EVERY game you just gotta realize it’s more a reflection of how shitty a person they are rather than any value you have.  No matter WHAT you do, even if you do everything perfectly, someone eventually will get pissy.
---
Just have fun man.  All you can do
---
the best thing you can do against that is just ignore it and make them rage even more haha
---
Finkle is Einhorn!
---
Not OP just Broken.
---
As she says, and I quote, “Happy cake day! I'm not ever stopping, tea bagging is an ancient art 😹.” People like her are why survivors are called toxic in the first place.
---
It doesn't. 
---
It shows fake pallets just like real ones, you'll have to remember which auras were there before you entered dream world.
---
Being bad doesn't mean it can't be used well, and definitly doesn't mean it's not fun. Even old Freddy could be used well and get 4k, and was kinda fun for some people.
---
But to use bad characters well requires a lot of game knowledge imo, knowing where survs may hide, how to pressure them, when you should stop searching for surv and go back to patroling, etc. At least more than using good characters well (outside of Huntress and Nurse, as those require a *lot* of skill).
---
So to someone that is pretty new to the game, I'd recommend at least mid-tier killers.
---
Platform: Xbox
---
Type: in-game
---
Description: survivors are getting multiple Sprint bursts in chases with the perk 'sprint burst'.
---
Windows or opportunity will light up dream pallets like normal
---
And I appreciate that.
---
Revving it slows him down, but I'm pretty sure that he actually speeds up while he uses it.
---
I would love to see this 🤣😂
---
Exactly, I don’t play killer to win, I play killer to, uhhhh. Yah.
---
Nice!!! Thanks!!
---
He is viable yes. Hey just removed any scummy gameplay. He sits himself fine in C tier
---
Toxic fucking people man. Ignorant asf. And they wonder why we get such a bad rep. 😒🙄 Sorry if you saw my other comment, I read your post wrong.
---
&gt;Ping abuse is just too much of a problem and wasn’t dealt with at all.
---
Right... is not like dedicated servers are on the verge of going live or anything. BHVR is definitely ignoring this problem.
---
Well yeah I've camped when one of you bodyblocked me while i was trying to hook and then he just disappeared
---
Lol honestly the spirit is not very effective at all unless you know how to mindgame. And on top of that, if you can't land hits exiting Haunt it is really hard to face good survivors. Saying it requires no skill says more about you than it does spirit.
---
Ghostface is the Leaning Lad for the glorious alliteration
---
Nah they still have a few weeks of life
---
Oh ok lol damn read through so many comments about the first half of the perk I forgot it did anything else
---
This big exists from the moment of adding the Collapse lul
---
I feel you but I wouldn’t say it should be bannable I’d just say separate the pings into 0-150, 151-300 ect... because sometimes I’ll get survivors at like 97 with a. Teammate of 627 and I end up swinging to realize they are cross map, and same thing with killers I’ll turn a corner to be warped 5 feet back and insta hit it’s annoying to say the least
---
Killers don't get mad because the survivor is better, it has everything to do with the teabagging and flashlight spams. When I play survivor against a killer I can clearly outrun, I don't try to make them feel like shit for it. 
---
Both sides deal with unnecessary toxicity. That's the whole point of the meme.
---
Coulda, shoulda 😅
---
For me it’s the swamp maps.
---
theres like a 5-10 second delay which is nothing
---
I believe its initial removal was a bug but they said they liked it that way because the music just always gave him away that he was stalking you
---
I don't rely on it but when I get punished for not tunneling because the guy with the helmet opens hatch with a key it's a little annoying.
---
I don't think Small Game affects Freddy's dream pallets.
---
I always make an effort to let nice looking Feng min's escape, how could you kill such a cutie?
---
I love them both, solves the main problems for both sides.
---
Staring Contest is going to screw over regular killers a bit though, since SWFs or idiot survivors will hide around the hook, and try (and fail) to save the person on the hook, but give them a free unhook anyway. Basically, your teammates failures give them a reward anyway.
---
meg was the one with borrowed time so feng would just get downed
---
My TV cuts the screen, when changing characters I only see the word "chara"
---
I get that men get mad at female game streamers solely for their gender. You can ensure that my comment is legitimate because I'm a female gamer as well, not a "good sir gentleman".
---
I also have been playing even survivor/killer for about two years. It's not a bandwagon; teabagging at the gates IS toxic. All I'm saying is, be careful with how you comment if you want to be a public figure in this gaming community; these commenters will eat you alive.
---
I hardly ever see Stridor. I don't even see the point of having it in the build.
---
Yes my brother has all the same dlcs as me
---
It wouldn't be fair to a level 17 player or even a level 11 player if they went up against a level 4 killer. I know you guys have a lot to say about fairness, but that wouldn't be fair. They made it so the levels of everyone in the SWF are averaged out. That is more fair than it was before, and it is more fair than pitting a level 17 survivor against a level 4 killer. I honestly do not know why you are complaining when you have gotten kills in literally every game you posted. Do you want to 4k every game? Do you want it easy for you?
---
I'm not criticizing a female streamer for being female. I'm criticizing the people that watch a female streamer just because she's a female.
---
Hang mans trick.
---
Theres literally nothing wrong
---
You're right, that's WAY less silly
---
Pumped up kicks change, "repeatedly crouches in front of you during chase."
---
The image is being upscaled by the TV.
---
Yeah thats what I meant I didnt see that it was meg who got unhooked. The point still stands though
---
Yeah this guy's a total idiot. I get viewers because I put a lot of effort into my stream. You dont just click Go Live button &amp; get viewers for being female. Ridiculous.
---
It happened to me before ever since then I don't chance it with sneaky Mikey
---
ooga booga girl playing video game make my pp hard
---
No, I don’t care about getting 4k’s every single game, I care about a decent matchmaking system and having a fun game.
---
I don't know man. The water box seems pretty fricking op.
---
I mean I'm gay but thanks for attempting to steal my joke
---
 You're welcome
---
It's honestly one of the best feelings I get when playing the game
---
oh i see now, one body block is a mark of toxic SWF and so a completely valid reason to tunnel, camp, dodge ds and then complain about dc and survivors being mad? Pepega community
---
you're right it was a very funny and original joke I shouldn't have copied such a comedic masterwork my apologies
---
Rank 20
---
Usually if you get camped, tunnel, t bagged, or hooked in front of the exit gate. You usually did something to make the killer  a m g e r y. I would guess there was a fair share of BM from both sides in this.
---
I mean not my fault you guys get triggered over a simple action.
---
Meta Nurse Boys
---
Fire Up - Bamboozle - Enduring - Spirit Fury
---
Just wait till the Freddy rework comes out. I doubt anyone will be playing survivor.
---
Lag
---
That's great and all but how about just completely removing collision with survivors when she's phasing? No more free bs hits just because you bumped into someone
---
I think it would be better if this guy was an engineer because he doesn't have an exhaustion perk like an athlete would
---
Swap the words killer for survivor and survivor for killer. Works the exact same way.
---
They are both giant spiders so it's possible.
---
*snap* that ones going in the cringe comp for sure
---
Wait... YOU CHASE THE KILLER? 
---
Holy crap it's a Nea main.
---
And you say I dont make funny jokes
---
I find that hard to believe tbh 
---
95% of killers at red and purple ranks use ruin so I don't see why a rank 3 survivor would be so shocked to see ruin.
---
That sounds good. Make the baseball a bolt or nut.
---
This shit has happened to me multiple times and I don’t understand it. Sometimes everyone experiences it and other times it’s just me and people think I’m mental
---
I didn't say that, I think you're hilarious
---
It’s a thrill I live for that rarely happens.
---
Shadowborne. Extremely pointless to have equipped.
---
it is very difficult to phase and find a survivor by either colliding with them or listening to them scream in agony. you really need to have a high IQ to play spirit
---
It's perfectly fine for killers to bodyblock survivors to get free chainsaws or to block the basement but if you bodyblock hooks you're exploiting and should be banned !!!
---
Just because people don't like teabagging, doesn't mean they're offended. I don't like teabagging because it's childish and pointless, but I also don't care if people wanna do it. But it's still childish and pointless and it's perfectly ok to call people out for being childish.
---

You have to buy the full dlc. You can’t buy one killer with coins or something and get it on all accounts unless you go through the PS store
---
Looks like he was camping hatch,probably why he gave that dwight away.
---
Ricardo? Like ricky retardo? Gottem
---
IT just chose a form we can comprehend (or was it that we couldn’t comprehend it’s true form? Dunno which)
---
He needs it about as much as he needs the reduced movement speed on his power charge. And he needs neither.
---
The timer for the trap doesn’t stop when they do a trap.
---
it doesn't stand at all since feng doesn't have borrowed time thus would just get downed anyways
---
most people i know do it by accident as they don’t know that it’s tunnelling, they just play the game to try and kill everyone
---
How about dodge them instead of being a reject?
---
I'd rather not experience the guaranteed stun that I've heard about from a while back.
---
You could always just not die then you won't be teabagged by these childish and pointless people! :)
---
Man... you must watch some shitty streamers. Lol
---
Oh man, I played last night, and the survivors doing that first one forced me to be guilty of that second one. I won, but it did nooooot feel good.
---
Y e s, t h a t i s t h e p r o b l e m
---
Almost everyone uses ruin, the fact that a rank 3 complained about it is the thing that brothers me, he/she also complaint about a lot of things including lag switching (which i can actually forgive since i livre in Brazil but srly he/she could have checked the ping bar before)
---
From a survivor stand point, take note of every pallet you come across. Decent chance he placed a trap there for future chases.
---
Survivor: a pallet! I still have a chance!
---
Trapper: **Yare yare daze...**
---
Survivor: *gets caught on trap inbetween pallet* NANI?!?!
---
He was never good, just really toxic in design. The rework was an objective buff but increased the skill-requirement by infinity because your power does not guarantee a down anymore.
---
I can understand that. Waiting either way might benefit you because the 1x price will go down as well. But it runs outstanding.
---
Yeah exactly
---
They don't play for more than a month/don't play beyond a certain rank, and get reset back to the baby ranks so they can use their stacked loadouts against noobs.
---
MINIMUM 21, not all are the same age
---
Sometimes the killer will wait for the game to start then start downloading games, streaming movie, etc.
---
What is DS?
---
Honestly I play both LoL and this game and the toxicity just depends on who you encounter. I find this game less toxic speech but more toxic behavior and vise versa. Either way, I play on PS4 for over a year and I don’t have a problem with toxic people too much. They show up like once a month. I wouldn’t worry too much. But it gets worse for killers
---
How do you know IT's not in the game? 
---
It turns into your biggest fears. 
---
EVERYTIME YOU GET CAMPED OR TUNNELED, R E M E M B E R.
---
The condescending “good sir gentleman” comment is pretty unnecessary. You put a clip out to the public and are going to receive feedback, good or bad. Not once did I insult or attack you, just stating a fact, tea bagging at the gate is toxic. If you weren’t trying to get a rise out of someone you wouldn’t have done anything. You can give the free hit by standing by the exit if that’s what you want to do. 
---
For the record, I personally don’t care if you’re a girl gamer, poor behavior is poor behavior. I would have made the same comment regardless of gender. This game can be rough enough as it is without people encouraging BM through streaming. Is it so hard to just not be a rude person?
---
Pro tip, if you're hurt and want healed, you can take empathy and when someone else is hurt and needs healed you can run up to them and heal each other :)
---
I’m not defending Stridor as a great perk, but I personally do like it and will pop it on, on occasion. It does exactly what it says it does and it adds a new layer to pinpointing survivors.
---
But what if you down somebody after the last gen is done the trap is activated straight away
---
"B-but you promised, that if everyone else DC'd, you'd let me escape"
---
"Know your place. Such a deal is obviously too good to be true for a flashlight noob like you"
---
"YOU SICK BASTAAAAAA-"
---
Right, aaaaaand how often does this happen again? I'm willing to bet it's not very often and you're just making negative assumptions.
---
somewhere around 30-40 if you start at lvl 1.
---
&gt;About what level do you get around when you spend 1 million bp on a character that’s level 1?
---
It depends on RNG and how good you are at manipulating the bloodweb.
---
Roughly between levels 30 and 42 at the very best.
---
**fleshlights**
---
Well isn’t a female survivor and a flesh light the same thing, Trapper?
---
I said sometimes? There will always be a few who do it.
---
It stops when incapped, hooked or chased. The rest is up to how they manage time. The timer is 2:30 seconds long once activated. At shortest 2:00. That is plenty of time to search the boxes out of chase. If they manage they're time poorly they shouldn't be rewarded.
---
In my experience, 34-36, depending on how much you spend on each bloodweb.
---
The thing about Myers is that his score adds to the atmosphere of playing him/against him, but against sweaty teams, having too many queues is a hazard.
---
It isnt.
---
Could he be from Boston and have a speed boost perk for when he isn’t being chased by the killer?
---
Yea, kind of but I don't personally see lots of people using it recently. It's great playing, relying on headset, but anyways k prefer Whispers
---
I guess I am the Ace type
---
Yes, a few, most people on this sub probably haven't faced more than a handful of actual lagswitchers, heck I can only think of 2 times where I've played vs a legitimate lagswitcher, every other time it was just dogshit connection.
---
You commented to me and not op, but yeah you nailed it on the head.
---
Sometimes it’s because teammates won’t stop throwing themselves at your hooked body regardless of how close the killer is, resulting in the killer punishing that type of play style by staying near you.

She earned that stabbing.
---
Wtf? Spirit is imo the second hardest killer in the game. You need to know exactly how survivors act, have good ears and practice knowing and identify distance according to volume, etc...
---
Run open handed. Extra 8 metres and worth an extra perk slot. Ezzzzz /s
---
If you got camped for 5 gens it just proves gen rush is a bad thing
---
Amanda uses a gun in the movies. Jigsaw uses the hidden blade.
---
I think Pig should be able to use a gun to shoot survivors. Instantly killing them.
---
It pasues during chase, not for just being in terror radius.
---
*muda intensifies*
---
I have a weird attraction to doctor, even with his "thing" in his mouth. 
---
I'm not gay, but if I were a girl, I'd date him if I had the chance.
---
Insidious Freddy is my favorite meme build
---
Turns out that the survivors didn't wanna play a game.
---
It does here’s the proof https://youtu.be/ZJIulUI3efE 6:19
---
Sadly, this isn't true, unless the killer mistaked me for another I didn't BM the killer at all, I was usually working on generators across to map. I would understand and suck it up if I teabagged the killer but I never met the killer until the end.

This was at the end of last season. I’ve only been playing for two weeks
---
At least on PC, dbd is 720p upscaled. With some messing with settings you can get it to be 1080/1440/2560p/whatever the heck one has but idk how to do that on console.
---
Lmao, where are you guys getting all these killers who actually aren't heartless monsters? Down here at around rank 15, i only bump into sweaty tryhards who always try and go for complete stomps no matter what, or people who have no clue how to play killers, and therefore the whole team escapes anyways.
---
You will never understand getting camped by a shit killer yeah it's annoying it going to happen if you like it or not
---
You guys put less and less effort in memes every day amazing
---
These are the people who used to complain about dribbling.
---
Damn.
---
Devour Hope on any killer but Hag usually surprises me.
---
It's useful on spirit. Maybe my headset is not as good as it should be but without stridor i rarely can pinpoint the sirvivors while phasing.
---
I also use it on nurse from time to time. Blinking around and suddenly hearing the claudette breathe while i blink past is always fun.
---
That's not even what he said. He said that they bodyblocked so he knew they were around the hook still.
---
thanks for the tip idk i can take screenshots xd
---
Everyone dies in video games. Everyone. But NOT everyone teabags. That's you choosing to do it.
---
fuck streamers.

You survivor mains should just ask to remove totems
---
Depends on what you buy and how you manipulate the entity. To be safe id say between lvl 27-42ish.
---
I just think everyone should experience both sides before jumping to the "survivor handbook". Those people are killer mains who have played less games as survivor than they can count on two hands.
---
The same goes to survivor mains who scream dumb shit. I dont know why someone wouldnt play both sides atleast for a few hours. I got way better at survivor after learning what a killer can and cannot due so the transition was easy. The same as killer because I know the juke or movement they will most likely take.
---
I'm just getting real tired of seeing these posts where one side is pointing out the other but those people have absolutely 0 understanding of why survivors/killers. This mostly goes for killer mains though because at the end of the day they can ruin a game because they control it vs a survivor can just annoy you and that's up to you to take personally.
---
It always says entity displeased if the game cancels.
---
Typical suggestion. Let's just combine the powers of two perks while keeping both perks separate. Reminds me of when SB and BL could be stacked.
---

Too bad already made it :^)
---
“Perk idea: removes all hex totems from the game
---
Lmk what u guys think:)))))”
---
I can imagine, these are great killer examples of using this perk. I have to take Stridor for a ride then to make it more popular ^°^
---
Meg had the BT, not Feng.
---
Spoiler?
---
Look at all the blue falcons taking flight.
---
Billy has created Politics?
---
The trap is supposed to be a chance for a fucked over last player, it wouldn’t really be in best interest to add a way to completely stop it outside of closing the hatch
---
By mindgaming you mean 50/50 guessing game. Thats what spirit mindgames are
---
It's honestly hilarious you think it's immoral to teabag. I'll keep doing the butt dance regardless. Have a wonderful day &lt;3
---
I kind of like Shadowborn on Nurse or even Ghostface. Makes my FOV wider but I've got your point, there should be FOV change in options rather than taking one perk slot.
---
Ok
---
Rain would hinder vision for both sides, snow would cause footprints to be left behind (which would be cool), wind would disrupt sounds.
---
I disagree the add-ons are there to help every killer including Nurse, and the higher rank you are the more experienced Survivors your going to face bringing in instaheals and tool boxes to shut you down and teabag at the gates. I say once you learn how to blink bringing in additional blink to secure the kill just to make the game the much easier. I hear people go by these rules that are just generic "Your not a good Nurse if you (insert perk/playstyle here)..." Best advice, use add-ons if you want to win against players who will bring whatever means to win.
---
Exactly, but I undurstand that they didn't get it right, my English kinda sux
---
Whoops, my apologies. Must not have been paying attention. I’m sure she’ll see. I appreciate that you agree, this game definitely doesn’t need more stress.
---
it Just doesn't make sense to me how it pops heads at the door but not the hatch. And I feel the hatch is already too safe.
---
Thanks.
---
Lol Boston Marathon joke?
---
I get 1-2 of those every time I play survivor
---
Nah, if you press “play as killer” you should just get a “you win” notification
---
Nerf her range add one first
---
You deserve that for not just running out the damn exit gates lol I never even hesitate
---
&gt;handwriting
---
Bruh
---
It was plenty clear. They just wanted to interpret it a certain way.
---
Yes agree also
---
Get a support ticket. They will ask for proof of bp earned and reimburse you all your bp. I lost david donkey jacket and billy's propain hammer. Hope you didnt play much. I got 128 mil decided to prestige 2 surv and 1 killer. Still have 29 mil. I dont earn bp for games until I spend it. I spent hours just spending bp butvgave up. Gonna p3 Bill day 1. I have a couple hundred firecrackers and couple anniversary party streamer things spread across 5 surv.
---
From my experience as the pig it's always the first or second box and seeing as how the pig never gets head pops the timer is fine.
---
That's why the single idea of Ban Killers with shity Ping its pretty stupid lol
---
Only 6k hours? Pleb, I watch and support a streamer who played 9k hours and fucki gates dbd... Blood harvesting is better balanced lol. Death garden is actually balanced.
---
The killers I play against are fine. There was even one I had encountered earlier who didn't attempt to stop us. He was fun but it was unfortunately my first victory of the day. I blocked my messages even though I always keep them open. :s
---
NOED on billy,Myers and huntress! Why you may ask? Simple billy and Myers have an instadown mechanic while huntress if she hits you with a hatchet it gives a notification and doesn’t instadown you. 
---
Also honorable mention insidious on a wraith just because you can easily go invisible instead of wasting a perk slot but eh to each their own!
---
Jiren Myers: H-HOW? NO ONE CAN JUST DODGE IN LAG!

Nearby rank 1 Dwight god: **they’re coming...**
---
*Ultra Instinct theme begins to play*
---
That’s stupid too though. This guy wants to go out of his way to take away any advantage a survivor has (which is next to none anyways), meanwhile he’s playing as the killer... the guy who gets to literally kill the entire lobby.
---
love it! I love every bit of what you just described!
---
Wow you're such an honorable person. I commend you for being such an obedient survivor ⭐
---
Nope

---
**i regret nothing**
---
She’s not overpowered, she already has a high skill cap, she doesn’t need a nerf.
---
Seeing that Meg is also a very iconic survivor in DBD, I really wanted to insert her in the meme. But I don't know who she could be.
---
Everyone spam crouch so the killer slams uncontrollably into the walls of the trial repeatedly
---
Woulda coulda shoulda, except you’re a bitch that wants to piss people off. And don’t pull bloodpoints on my, it’s almost nothing.
---
What an useless coment haha just write "I hate nurse op" next time
---
Are you by any chance playing on console where the sens and frames make it that way
---
Both have to be on the condition that other survivors aren't within a slightly greater range and that it isn't the last survivor alive. Survivors do camp and dive bomb hooks and crouch to great each other or take advantage or avoid certain perks. Meanwhile if a killer gets the last survivor hooked, they'll probably stay at or near the hook unless they know something breakable is nearby.
---
Are you blind lmao he was literally proxy camping and he would’ve killed him if they didn’t have lithe...
---
What rank are you because when the last gen is completed the traps will activate automatically
---
you don’t know that shitpost from hours ago? That Pumped Up Kicks And the Staring Contest shitpost?
---
That's what we were discussing in another thread, sadly the other fker was just Spaming "your opinion its bias your are a killer" like duuuh haha
---
I get kinda the same match making it sucks honestly, Facing 4 and higher rank than you wtf haha
---
Nurse without lunge after second blink would be shit, I think the fact that she is slower than a survivor is balancing her pretty well
---
They changed that during the EGC patch. Was in the patch notes and everything.
---
Btw, you can't grab people out of hatch, but you can close it. Just thought I'd mention that seeing how you seem out of the loop.
---
Oregon?
---
I haven't seen the show yet
---
Even on console with the frames shes by far the best. No idea why anyone would think otherwise.
---
Rank 6. When the gen is activated yes. When the gens are activated no. As in if the gen is already done when Helmet is put on it wont activate.
---
I hope you have public steam profile comments
---
But when all gens are done it activates
---
Didn't say immoral. I said childish and pointless.
---
Never disagreed, which one u on?
---

Everyone on here talking down to her. She's hot and can bm me anytime. You on PS4?
---
But again, why is it the killer's fault for playing the game and taking the avenue that more often than not would secure a victory and not their teammate who put them in that dangerous position in the first place? Why does the killer have to handicap themselves but the survivor is completely fine trying to screw over their teammate?
---
Why
---
I main pig I know this
---
Did you even watch? No ill intent in my clip. Unlike you, who's failing at pissing me off :D
---
Facts I'm a rank 5 nurse main and I couldn't get up there with any other killer 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
They should just revert amandas rbt to trigger in egc
---
Mostly in the higher ranks where killers recognize that they could end you but show mercy because they have the ability to
---
Yes it can... you can derank yourself to 15 then not play and get reset to 19
---
Damn by posting this you say i am the toxic one?    
---
Should i remove it? No way do i want to sound or be toxic. I thought this was an achievement to be proud of (as a new killer main)
---
No I’ll intent, except for the teabagging? You’re obviously a liar.
---
For her killer power, she wields a **G U N**
---
Were the doors open were you in a chase with him?
---
i like this idea, it’s great for solo survivors who dont want to use self care, it’s pretty cool.
---
The problem isnt the aura side of the perk, its really how hard it is to get. Love seeing Ash's crouching in front of hooks, right?
---
And when the killer finds you first you can still escape if not injured. If the survivor has key and is full healed you can shut the hatch all you want and they will still escape.
---
Did you get steamrolled by a nurse recently?
---
I don’t have a problem with SWF. I just have a problem when I have to play with people who are way above my rank when I’m a rank 10 killer
---
Great another ochidoo wanna be fantastic
---
I have a theory that the ranked system is so flawed that eventually people who can pip past the 20s range will eventually get to rank 1 which is why they have the rank resets. Otherwise, there would be nobody between 18 and 3.
---
? Exploit? Using a normal game mechanics is an exploit? Imagine DS without the timer, but imagine being the killer
---
Exactly, that’s my main complaint.
---
I'm just trying to hold out hope that this could work it's literally the best of both worlds.
---
YAMAOKA ESTATE
---
Yeah just look why they were mad at me
---
No but if a helmet is and you shut the hatch it will not activate neither.
---
Being also on Xbox one I can confirm that every time u try to blink the game basically freezes
---
Had a toxic killer earlier, called him out on it and he said "Everyone else does it". Felt like I was talking to a child, like, if everyone else jumped off a cliff...
---
Lol, I didn't mean to make you feel bad.  Sorry, dude. XD  Fair enough, though.  I couldn't infer as much from the screenshot in combination with the title, is why I asked.  Obviously, I can't tell you if it was or wasn't lagswitching either.
---
Just remove her addons and maybe increase the fatigue. And make jt so she cant see scratch marks or blood after she blinks for 10 seconds or so.
---
Very true. After a lot of preparation only then you wreck havoc on the survivors. But if its a SWF group, everything falls apart if they start telling your traps. Worse yet, someone always takes notes of your traps and disarms them one after another.
---
Not to mention those Chilli add-ons that do literally nothing.
---
Yeah that too. Maybe even rework how the traps activate
---
It do be looking kinda fresh doe 😋
---
What is the positive for Lab Rat?
---
Survivors have 0 advantage?
---
Hahaha I love these
---
It would bring potatoes and campers.
---
So empathy, but worse?
---
And that (the downvotes)  is why you put the /s, even if you don’t believe it
---
Depipping is a good thing though.
---
Also any survivor that bodyblocks or does a calculated move MUST be a SWF
---
Good thing that isn’t the case right? Except you guys get to completely nullify one of the best survivor perks in the game by spamming the drop button. I’m sorry but I’m being serious, killers get to take away literally every advantage a survivor can get right now with next to no effort. Flashlights, tool boxes, medkits, keys or maps? Franklin’s. DS? Drop them every so often. SWF? Face camp.
---
Or just play as Cannibal and it doesn’t matter anyways, you either win in seconds or lose in a slow burn, it’s practically RNG when you play him regardless of who brought what.
---
Listening for panting and carefully watching scratch marks and bending grass and predicting misdirects is not 50/50 anything dude lol. Have you ever played killer?
---
They're burnt out of the game but nothing else gives them as many views (=money) so they complain constantly which I guess is normal for someone who is doing something they don't enjoy for so many hours almost every day. You don't even need to speculate, streamers usually admit they don't feel like playing other games different from their main(s) because they don't pull views. One of them I follow left DbD for a while for another game, publicly said was so tired of DbD and so happy to leave it for good and yet when that other game died, went straight back to DbD, big surprise. It's actually kind of sad, at least until they're back on shitting on random people who just want to have fun and you think they deserve it. I don't really envy them the least bit. People see it as earning money playing video games but it must take a mental toll on you, even more than a regular job.
---
There actually really good for toxic survivors and camping killers
---
I think there’s confusion in the comments. This is a killer-side change, yes? So a killer running Devour Hope and Ruin sees Devour hope with like a green border and a corresponding green highlight in-game? And a similar purple border-highlight for Ruin?
---
So the killer knows which totem has which perk in case they want to defend one more than the other?
---
depends on if you go for expensive or cheap shit
---
Who said zero advantage? I didn’t.
---
I said very little. Never said zero.
---
Eyy i get that reference lmao
---
It would expand the community and grow the game more. It will rise in popularity and the devs would make more money that they could pour into the game
---
Me: actually edit the videos
---
Mrgolden007: ochido wannabe
---
Bro, ochido didint created the sound effects, what ur saying is that, if u use those sound effects on dbd, ur an ochido wannabe....? Ok.
---
Just gut her add-ons, seriously, her range add-ons indirectly grant her 2 other stats for no negative and 3/4/5 blinks don deserve to exist.
---
you do not have over 120 THOUSAND hours...
---
That wouldnt change anything besides making them pander to low ranks and no one wants that.
---
Pretty sure it’s a killer-side buff
---
Yea
---
You can find better and less annoying sound effects
---
But you allready getting salty when someone calls out your shitty video
---
Or they could do the obvious change and do protection hits and safe unhooks
---
Oinker finds gun, kills Entity and enforces her own rules
---
Sandbag yourself until you’re ready, or play survivor. I’ve got probably 1000+ hours on console, and just bought the game on PC; haven’t played even one match yet. My plan is grind survivor then dump points into killer.
---
No nerfing. Just leave her alone.
---
exactly 10 years before the game even came out XD
---
It’s a killer buff, not a survivor buff
---
1.Put rule set #2 in her base kit 
---
2.Even If they were put after the last gen was done make RBTs activate at the exit gate
---
*I've been playing this game for a month now*
---
Yeah she DC'd after, then everyone else did
---
Yes I main Spirit and Hag because they are the easiest killers to get BBQ stacks for me personally.
---
I play on Xbox and recently DbD was put on game pass so we had a flooding of noobs but despite our community being a toxic one people still help each other to learn eventually people will get better.
---
I just wanna know who voiced Feng because she did an amazing job
---
OK but anyway, do you think  when killer uses mechanics against survivors that it is an exploit?
---
It means I’m asking for the original comic
---
Confused TOTH for Small game, my bad b
---
Yeah i play xbox too it was horrid i had to strictly play pc after 2 days.
---
Was this post necessary? No. Is it stupid? Yes.
---
Im not defending the video, im defending myself... and yea, tell me where you see any ear rape or toxic behavior... 
---
btw having haters means ur growing up, so im not mad;)
---
You should have posted a screenshot of your post game loadout so we could see what you ran to accompany the brag post
---
It could be fake right? Or did she somehow voice chat you?
---
:(
---
Deserved it

I’m not sure if it was his mom but she was talking in post game
---
I actually did good my first time as The Huntress on PS4. Granted, I was facing low-ranks (I was low-ranked as well)
---
Should have had Leatherface as the icon for the 2nd perk LOOL
---
So you've heard the voice right?
---
supposed to show that it's a swf but ok
---
Nah I didn’t I don’t believe it was actually his mom but if it was then I get to laugh even more
---
Why does everyone hate The Game? I get that it's slightly killer-sided, but it's my favorite map as both killer and survivor as it usually produces a fun round.
---
Then again, I also hate Coldwind maps as a survivor, so maybe I'm just weird...
---
This comment can't be real.
---
If Michael choking survivors out spawns “harder daddy” memes, would The Nurse choking survivors create “harder mommy” memes?
---
I had a stroke trying to understand you please elaborate
---
But it grows our community ppl will learn how to play eventually u just have to give them the chance to get good also not playing the game bc newer ppl started joining seems a bit extreme.
---
Didn’t here it but I don’t really believe it was his mom but I can laugh if it was
---
or they just use reddit mobile
---
Or i can tell you what i had with me: 
---
— Agitation.

Not all of them. Just juggling them specifically. As far as I know the rest is legitimate.

Yeah but if he expected to scare me I can laugh even more

No. I dont want little kids already ruining a toxic community and thats the kind of people he brings. Im for more adults sure, but pewdiepie would just bring loud and idiotic children. It would be the same if ninja did it and once again no one wants that.
---
Yeah expected you to have ran NOED.  The screenshot also would have shown bloodpoints for all which shows if you say camped to death on first hook etc...regardless all I'm saying is if you're going to brag about a 4K on here and survivor salt include the post game so we can see if this is entitled survivors whining, or a babykiller that played scummy.  We don't know without the pic.
