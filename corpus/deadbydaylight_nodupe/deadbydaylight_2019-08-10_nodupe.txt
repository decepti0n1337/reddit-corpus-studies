---
Wait rejoining was a thing a long time ago?
---
how the fuck would the shark from jaws work? only on one map? survivors fixing gens underwater? that‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous.
---
im saying dont start witg exhaustions. sprint burst is shit no matter whar rank lmao. i suggested claudette. get better with skillchecks, dont rely on shit teamates to heal and can see where a killer is chasing an injured survivor.
---
Plague: Thanatophobia, Brutal Strength, Bamboozle, Pop Goes The Weasel. Survivors never wanna cleanse so they're one shot and this build helps remove loops and end chases, Pop to fuck fuck witg gens and the thanatophobia is to annoy them and it lasts consistently longer than any Ruin.
---

---
Pig: Save The Best For Last, Pop Goes The Weasel, Nurse's Calling, BBQ. STBFL on Pig is great since they smoothed out her crouch speeds and her dash isn't a regular attack so it won't cost you tokens if hitting your obsession
---
i agree challanges can be good, but dbd is broken asf i think its challanging as it is :(
---
You are far too upset for this meme.
---
"You stay right there I'm complimenting you"   
---
Lost it
---
for pig: whispers LEVEL 2. it‚Äôs important that it‚Äôs level 2 and not lvl 3. so you can crouch before people hear you TR. maybe PWYF? obviously m1 killer stuff like SF and enduring etc.
---
Absolutely. There's anti-heal builds and slug builds and stall builds. You have to think of how perks work together especially with your Killer's power. For example, Freddy's Addon Blue Dress works immensely well with Hex: Ruin and Hex: Huntress' Lullaby. If you get all 5 stacks of the Lullaby and Ruin is still up, it will be a true feat for a Survivor to finish a generator. There's a lot of combination like this, all it take is some imagination or research.
---
I don't get it
---
Well that went over my head, yikes
---
Lol, is a child really trying to lecture me? Ok buddy, maybe it's time to put you down for a nap. Maybe change your diaper while we're at it?
---
My man, she‚Äôs wearing a huge ass sweatshirt and probably clothes under it. She could be chubby?
---
Nice cosplay.
---
Proving my point the more you talk.
---
but where does it go no shit
---
Abusing the chainsaw lol. That's like the suvivors that complain the killer killed them.
---
It‚Äôs French you arrogant man
---
Nobody is obligated to save you. Judging by your attitude, I don't blame em.
---
Sad thing is, you don't have a point. If anything, your whole argument has been "no you".
---
Never show mercy.

Well since we're being smartasses here I thought I'd chime in. Grammar\*

They should replace it with "entity slightly less pleased, but it's okay because you did your best." It should also come with a smiley face sticker.

Stunted on that pro gamer with my smartness üòé  üòé
---
Given how stupid you've been up til now, I feel it's only fair to tell you that this is kind of what I mean about you.
---
Like, I'd feel bad for you, but it'd be wasted on you since you don't know sympathy.
---
ohhh i see haha
---
Too many people taking "200" literally ;-;
---
All I know is that I've gotten like at least 70 Bloodwebs into this Killer. I can actually check all the perk levels on my Trapper to get the actual total number of Bloodwebs I've done without getting the perk I want.
---
I dunno, I don't want to go deaf from every other sound.
---
That and tinnitus means I'm not the best at tracking, I can hear injured survivors, but have to fish around for them a bit.
---
Verbatim from online ‚Äúthe art or practice of costuming oneself‚Äù. I hope you realize that by your standards, a guy who puts in countless hours on a actual build like you claim to have worked on, is goin to be the same level as someone who‚Äôs wearing jeans and a paper mask. Your the reason why cosplay is dying and complete Amazon dog shit. Nice opinion tho.
---
Hmm... I max out and get a lot of bloodpoints. It has slowed down so many games. So maybe I'll be less lenient on the good players that are toxic. I just don't find it fun when I take the game seriously as a killer. It kinda bores me, and I lose more matches that way. Maybe I need to mix things up.
---
Lol. What an alpha compliment.
---
I got a rant like this after leaving from a lagswitching nurse, the exact msg: ‚Äúimagine raging and leaving the game‚Äù
---
Give us prestige skins as layers.
---
The salt is deep in this one
---
I think it‚Äôs because you‚Äôre three gen-ing them and that makes the game last longer than normal, and if your attacking them and leaving them on the ground for someone else to come get them, then they may think you were trying to slug
---
The hills have eyes
---
Its what's wrong with this community tho so
---
Well shes retarded. I dont do that shit. The people that do this shit are retarded objectively.
---
There is a button you can push to stop it from being anonymous when you go to gift it. It's on by default though. I think most people don't want to take an action like that because it seems like your fishing for thanks or something.
---
Is there any word on us Australians getting a dedicated server?
---
I give them enough time to pick some 1 up, so I can resume chasing and scaring them, unless I need to slow the game even more, then I'll slug, but won't hook after. I mainly resume my patrol, and enable several saves.
---
I hope the bloodweb change isn't too drastic and easy. Part of DBD I've enjoyed is the grind.
---
9 now.

Add water to the map.. and have it not deep water so survivors can still walk and do everything...

Hey at least, the more people complaining, the more likely to nerf her ass
---
what.
---
In my opinion music helps me focus more, as well as I don‚Äôt care about having to listen to little sounds like survivors breathing or a Michael or Ghost Face breathing.
---
Nah, just a bunch of ropes will do.
---
I bet you've never been left behind on purpose or left to die on hook by a SWF who doesn't like that you didn't unhook somebody immediately
---
hmm, what do you think of xbox/ps4/switch having the same matchmaking pools and if a swf member is a pc user they get into the pc pools
---
Why do it though? This serves literally no purpose other than to be annoying.
---
And if that really is the end goal in this, please try to remember, there is a human being on the other side of your screen, who is also trying to have fun. Hearing that sound is annoying as fuck, but knowing that someone actually put effort into making it more annoying really fucking sucks.
---
Tbagging = all die
---
Fun game = let last survivor go
---
I know. Just gotta get your head out of the ground and move on. It's gonna happen and it will stay. 
---
You have to try and ignore it. Never respond to toxic survivors/killers, it'll only fuel it. And try not to become part of the toxicity. 
---
Be the better person and set things in the right motion.

Playing killer is toxic
---
Yeah I guess it is simple to do, i mean she managed to float and teleport with only a very tight pillowcase
---
I gotta wonder if all the people that say wraith is bad/one of the worse killers are playing him wrong. Even in high ranks my wraith game is on point. His cloak speed lets you speed around the map. Moreso with addons. I play wraith in high ranks addon-less and do well. If I feel its a swf or problem survivors then I'll slap some addons.
---
well the babushka is good but i have one suggestiom, if you use the iridesent head it makes you only start out with 1 hatchet so pair that up with the infantry belt that gives you 2 extra hatchets so you have 3
---
Bill became the very thing he sought to destroy.
---
play however you want, dont let other people control-s your game style, just do what the killer is supposed to do, if a surivvors is running at you, hit them.

Interesting how different people react to it, I completely lose focus because I can't filter out what I want to hear. Especially with the Spirit I need sound to play, but I noticed I can't play any type of game (maybe minus The Sims) while listening to music.

Farming BP'S so I don't end up in bad games on survivor (solo). While I get the stuff I need, so I can  build an awesome build for myself, and gain some confident to play solo survivor games. I sometimes do it, but need more confidence or I'll get destroyed every couple of games.
---
Iron Will (Self care takes too long) , Decisive Strike,(I get tunneled a lot), Dead Hard ( Easy to counter but I sometimes use it to get some distance or go over a trap, and Borrowed Time so of the killer camps I can at least help them have another chance to live
---
There's not much you can do, survivors only have their perspective and whatever you do they'll thing this or that is toxic because they don't see through your eyes and don't know what your thought process is.
---
Yes, nerf Legion more. He stabs people so much it needs to be bannable

How is he OP ?

If someone is dead on hook or injured, why would they go for a save?
---
Aww now I‚Äôm hungry.
---
Bruh u being to wholesome in this sub I'm not used to this. I know and agree with you but the better I get and the higher rank I become in both sides, the worse time I have. I dont want to go against rank 10s where I can play any killer and have fun and win because it's too easy but being rank 3 is painful unless you are the top 5 killers. Same with survivor. I played a game where not a single person was hooked and only 2 times was someone even injured. It may be fun for me but I feel bad cause I know how he's feeling. But then at higher ranks it's just cancer. It sucks.
---
If I ever run into you, I'm just gonna offer up a Seperation Shroud and laugh at your coward ass.
---
Will do man, thanks for the compliment
---
I bet every dbd player EVER has been left to die. I had a 3 man swf leave me to die atleast 5 times. I get left behind all the time. At the end of the day, you gotta do what you gotta do.
---
Sadly you're right. I've noticed in all my gametime the only time survivors feel inclined to drop a gg is if/when they all escaped. They're not dropping the gg to say gg, it's more to be salty/gg ez etc. Don't get me wrong, some survivors say gg, myself if I don't drop a gg after as a survivor is prob bc I'm already queued up for the next game. I play both sides, prob 60/40 (killer/survivor)
---
Well, you are welcome to think that but until Dante actually responds and says it was a joke, you don't honestly know either so I responded in such.
---
I feel like to balance the huge gap between console and pc would be to increase the sensitivity limit on console. Any one have any other suggestions? Or maybe allow a keyboard and mouse on console (if possible)
---
Right okay sure, tbh the survivor was so dumb I genuinelly thought that was him tryna speak English tho
---
It's more meh'd out.  The rework is fun and all, but it was *exactly* as I predicted: Old Freddy mains got left in the dirt without so much as a "thanks for playing him pre-rework" message.   New Freddy is so different that I actually struggle to use him well because he feels like he actively grates *against* the playstyle I'd grown used to using.
---
The worst part was he brought in prayer beads. That's when I knew something was up, and this was no rage quit.
---
Came here to comment this.
---
I always use decisive adreanline borrowed time and lithe
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter what you do, you‚Äôll always be toxic to a survivor
---
I usually like to let the survivors go if they are nice, of course i play seriously 1st so they don't catch on if i plan to let them go and just hook them twice then let them know I'm a nice killer i consider myself a ghostface main so i just look at them and butt dance to show them i'm friendly. If anyone bring a BPS i let them all live and farm if they want so we all get the most BP but usually i choose 1 or 2 survivors to let go, so i really hope that letting people go isn't a bad thing either lol
---
There has to be some line. Literal facecamping or just waiting for someone to show up meanwhile going in the circles around the hook is not fine, but at the same time camping can be used like a legit tactic. Some killers, like Bubba, are actually good only in camping and can make survivors break their keyboards thanks to Insidious perk. Or when I see an obvious SWF trying to get their friend, giving up on the gens completely and literally circling around me what should I do, leave? I mean do survivors realize they can completely outplay campers just by doing gens, right? In the past, you could rank up with camping but this hasn't been thing a years, killer who only camps just for one kill will always derank. 
---
I feel like many survivors are paranoid and think every killer who isn't on the other side of the map camps. It's better to give up on what survivors say, I get called camper anyway when I literally go on the other side of the map so they can unhook, if they're not teabagging SWF trolls, just to keep the game going. But I'm not gonna play stupid if you're sneaking up literally next to me.

Yeah, the person I let go was fun to go against and wasn't toxic. I let him go because his teammate were pretty bad, and I just felt bad. Another survivor reported me for teaming with a survivor because I let him go and I found other survivors pretty easily (they thought I was talking to the other survivor, with him telling their locations. I was not). I'll comment if I do get banned, but I probably won't anyway.

I've been sitting around rank 12 for a while, haven't recieved much salt at all tbh
---
Well done for not being a generic whiny 2 year old the second someone has an opinion or comment on a topic, well played, this is a true story but just extremely exaggerated, sprinkle in a really unlikeable fake personality and you get all the entitled killer and survivor mains swarming in with their salt like they know what they‚Äôre talking about, I do as well believe me, but I know it wouldn‚Äôt have been much different if I was honest and complained about a SL hillbilly ruining my fun, might as well read some hilarious replies instead xD ggwp tho, you have a keen eye for exaggeration
---
True, I guess it seemed too obvious. 
---
But that does lead me to another suggestion - sometimes it's not so much about "getting away" as it is wasting the killers time. If you can draw out a chase long enough often they will give up and go after someone else or go patrolling to keep up pressure.
---
Try running above it
---
Why can someone who is cut into pieces float? It‚Äôs a game and it would be fun to have them as killers.
---
Imagine telling someone that they're doing what they enjoy wrong
---
Yeah but you can‚Äôt yeet spirit. it would look so ducking dumb

Just sent you a friend request my name is grantTM

Currently enjoying iron will, lithe, deliverance, and spine chill. Haven't gotten adrenaline but will likely sub out deliverance or spine chill once I unlock that.

I personally use : 
---
-Borrowed time for risky hook saves 
---
-decisive strike bc i get tunneled every game 
---
-balanced landing , lithe or dead hard as exhaustion perk
---
-Self-care when i play solo because you just can‚Äôt rely on random teammates 
---
Also I sometimes replace some of my

perks by Empathy , bond , deliverance , adrenaline or spine chill

yeah ever since they increased her terror radius to be 32m, whispers got soooo much worse, I only run it with monitor &amp; abuse now.

Also, r/AceBase
---
we get the pants. xbox gets the shirt im p sure

Yea... My idea to make it less OP is that you have to help finish a generator to activate Trooper.

From what reality tv show is this meme from?
---
I can‚Äôt read that let alone say it out loud without feeling some sort of way.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter if you didn‚Äôt do a single scummy thing the entire game and play fair. Even though it‚Äôs not common in those types of games there will be someone who just spams the word toxic
---
This is so sick. The shading is awesome
---
Oh yeah way too big but I mean like a phantom but it has the sound effects of the nightmare.
---
No way u get the pants haha imma look that up
---
U sure about that?
---
Oh hell yeah dude, imagine the killer power being able to transform into a different kind of phantom like electricity or fire
---
A youtuber named Otzdarva recently tried a build with Dark Devotion on Legion. I'd been thinking about it since the Legion rework, but thought it wouldn't work too well, but Otz went and tried it. Turns out I was right. 
---
Dark Devotion transfers killer terror radius to the obsession after hitting them for 30 seconds. The gimmick is fun, but it wastes more time trying to get them to bleed out than actually just using M1 to down them.
---
On ps4 I‚Äôve been rank 1 with Bubba. No camping, no basement build bs. Its achievable with any killer, its just hard.

you might like OhTofu's videos as well!

feeling bad for the Legion cosplayers on this subreddit rn. don't worry guys, *i* still love you.

I wouldnt know haha im full PC, but i wouldnt think every console player gets the 130 dollar exclusive

Yeah, I prefer the HP lovecraft mind trickery but I think that type of mechanic has been used too much in DBD.
---
I actually find his DBD parodies somewhat funny, but you're definitely right about the John Carpenter bit, that was hilarious.
---
It's too bad you don't get the same enjoyment out of Sam's videos as some people do, but to each their own, ya know?

xbox gets the shirt thats it doe
---
It‚Äôs the Halloween theme, or at least the first few measures of it.
---
Frank‚Äôs is garbage what the hell? You mean iridescent button/tape?
---
I like how you got the illuminati‚Äôs logo to the hex
---
Ahh ok thats a reskin of the actual shirt from the code looks just as good tho PC gets that one too
---
me neither üò≠ i'm teasingly mean to people when i admire what they do, it isn't a cute look. we'll keep working on it tho, i believe in us!
---
If they swing fast, don't stop at the pallet, they'll miss. If you did stop for some reason, just don't go for the stun, drop the pallet early.
---
Also, if they swing through and it will probably hit you, don't drop the pallet. Take the speed boost from getting hit and run, save the pallet for a later loop.
---
I‚Äôm thinking the friends list is a bridge towards moving the game to (or at the least making it available on) the epic game store as well. So people on pc can be playing on either store and invite/play with people from the other.

Finally a miniature pig picture I can enjoy.  I owe you one.

How is Trapper on the same tier as a gangrenous woman who vomits everywhere
---
It‚Äôs the only option though, they are never going to buff anything like you are suggesting. Extra BP makes them a bit more unique without actually changing anything. Even if you made the buff amounts very minimal, I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would care about that more than a BP bonus. Would I rather have a 1-2% speed increase in something, or just extra points? Everyone would prefer the points. The only way people would care about buffed abilities if you make it worthwhile, and they definitely can not do that.

Love when you put Kate on a hook and her wig floats off
---
Depends on what winning is?
---
As Killer? Some people consider 4 kills a win. Others consider ranking up a win.
---
Survivors either see escapes or ranking up as winning.
---
To me, getting a large amount of BP is winning. Usually it comes with ranking up, but getting all the kills or escaping is just icing on the cake.
---
We now need Kermit as a survivor
---
I tell myself I struggle for bloodpoints and to give the others time to do work, but honestly I think I'm funny as shit cussing out my teammates hoping to see them lose.  I'm pretty and I know it.

It sounds loony, but it does help to keep a checklist or something and mark off perks as you get them tier 3. Because then you can at least see the incremental process you make.
---
I know it's not exactly what you mean, but using your 57.6% value, let's say that corresponds to 35 perks (rounding up, whee!) leveled and done with. In this hypothetical scenario, that means 25 perks remain. (I know it doesn't line up perfectly since most people will have a mix of partially leveled perks, much like your Corrupt Intervention 2 but bear with me)
---
That means right now, you would still only have a ~15.66% chance of seeing either perk on the next web you generated. At 24 perks remaining, this only grows to 16.30%. 
---
I've long since stopped expecting specific perks to show up because the fishing pool is just too widely stocked. And it might just be me, but I noticed trends where I'll pick a perk, and then see it 2 more times in either quick succession or within the next 5 webs, almost like the game is taunting me to just take it already.
---
I dunno, maybe it's just me but ever since I started keeping track of what perks I've got left and just ticking them off as I get them, it helps ease the pain by showing the progress I've made.
---
I played mostly killer until recently. Its honestly shocking how many toxic killers there are. In comparison I'm the fun killer. Rather than slugging the last person to death or face camping I just play and if theres a DC or something I'll drag the last person to the door to let them out.
---
Been playing survivor and now I get face camped, slugged, moried, and trolled constantly. And NoED is in like every other game.

Canonically Trapper. But I'd say maybe like... eventually they realize the Entity is the true enemy and try to escape it and like...when they learn how the Entity deploys the Nurse against them.
---
I've noticed dc'ers becoming a lot more common recently.
---
Is it a killer you dont like? DC
---
Get downed/hooked? DC
---
Killer has ruin or any other perk you don't like? DC
---
It's becoming a real problem.
---
Patch notes for Legion rework should have it, as well as lots of players generally know that it no longer works off terror radius.
---
XD  
---
Just put in the time dude... wraith is seriously fucking good
---
I doubt it would work but even if it did you‚Äôd have to be facing a rank 20 lol
---
nah, what bothers me is that i have to waste time (and/or a perk slot) for the POSSIBILITY that the killer has noed
---
It‚Äôs a win win for the killer: either survivors waste a shit ton of time or you get to instadown survivors. And what did the killer do to get that instadown? Absolutely nothing, he simply failed to be a proper killer, he failed to apply proper pressure.
---
Survivors are punished for getting the objective done, killers are rewarded for failing the objective
---
Fair and balanced obviously
---
Maybe you should implement how you want killers to play, by playing that way yourself as a killer. It's actually fun messing with survivor, in the end, I let most of them, if not all of them win.
---
He is kinda scary in his movies. Why would they call it a ‚Äúhorror movie‚Äù.
---
tbh I wanna be fucked by Trapper
---
You're talking a lot of shit for someone in mori range
---
I just feel as though that would be such a disadvantage. Seeing as you can hear EVERY single sound the survivors and killer make; from breathing, repairing, cleansing, healing, walking in the grass, walking on bare floor, a good portion of killers have unique walking sounds as well, and on top of that all sounds are directional too.
---
unless you have super high quality surround sound or something, I feel like you're tracking as a killer and your awareness as a survivor are really hindered.
---
These look amazing
---
Fortnite burger
---
i like the part where I said crouch by it for the love of
---
Yes I do. It‚Äôs an objective I can work towards, and being high rank feels good
---
When I first started dbd I tried killer first and I patrolled the hook, I was playing billy so I would chainsaw to a gen nearby then chainsaw back (maybe 20 or so meters away) I got all 4 by doing that and got a message afterwards from one of the survivors that was more helpful than anything lol he said something along the lines of, "Hey I know you are probably new, the group and I could tell, but how you sat really close to the hook the whole time like that is really frowned upon in this game. I probably wouldn't do that in the future, you will get a whole lot of hate. Plus you will most likely get more bps by leaving them and patrolling gens." I've never camped or patrolled since and I enjoy the game so much more because of it. When I play survivor and am camped I just remember how that guy didn't go off on me and just leave it be and go. I use to pass on the message in a nice way as well but people would respond with a huge amount of toxicity like "lol you just mad scrub" stuff like that lol so I turned off psn messages XD
---
No when I'm killer I make sure to tunnel one survivor at a time, and camp like it's Friday the 13th.  A kill is a kill, and I'm batting 1000 versus each player I get.  Got eem
---
It. Is. A. Meme. Calm down
---
doesn‚Äôt make the joke any less cringe
---
I get plenty of BP'S 25k+ . Every 1 lives.
---
I'll check those out!  Thanks for the suggestion!
---
others. Like, play that music and everybody starts working faster...but the killer can hear it.
---
I get plenty under 10k with one kill.  It's the only one that matters in that scenario.
---
Lol right
---
I know just making sure nobody tries to call me out I guess I dunno.
---
I do it coz its funny, that fact that another person is getting tilted makes it so much funnier, just like insidious camping, always brings good funny salt haha, triggered by pixels kinda meme is why, Like I find tbagging funny if I get tbagged some ppl cry and whine, just kill them for gods sake lol, also its so funny when u know somone is so tilted that they wiff there hits you get a 360 on them, always a good laugh haha, only thing it really exploits, is a mentally unstable persons brain.
---
Also its dead by daylight, kill or be killed, why would I want somone who is trying to kill me to have fun, sure if this was a coop game, but its not its either killer has fun or survivor has fun, vary rare do u see matches were both sides had fun unless your all fully memeing, thats why arguments of bullying in this game dont exist, if your trying to kill me, im gonna try to piss you off lol, part of the game, and if im killer and ur pissing me off Im gonna kill ya, ppl get sooo butt hurt over this game like its competative cs or somthing, a symetry games never will be competative one side will always not have fun!
---
Its like 5 clicks so yeah
---
Funnily enough i do better against survivors when i play wraith, so many disconnects and salty messages when they realize they're losing against a 'trash' killer.
---
hot take: If camping/tunneling gets you more than a 2k, the survivors dun fucked up strategically.
---
PS: it's only tunneling if you go out of your way to fuck over one survivor, punishing bad plays or happening to find a previously hooked survivor is fine
---
Play whatever way you get the most enjoyment.
---
At rhe end of the day,it's you playing,no one else.
---
I also enjoy the chase, the jump scares,and messing with the survivors heads......but once someone teabags or acts like an ass, all bets are off. I toss the survivor rulebook for killera out the window and make sure i do everything i can to feed that survivor to the entity.
---
Or they have a flashlight.......F flashlights.

---
Congrats good job! And don‚Äôt sell yourself short any win (especially on this game) is always something to be proud of!
---
Rubik's will is op for legion, and the last perk is too situational, I think the ability might be a little op just because of how fast he can travel and if combined with tracking perks he can find anyone even after landing a hit just because of the speed
---
Her Rochelle panta go better with that shirt don't @ me
---
I just realised we have two faces in dbd, ghostface and leather face.
---
retarded idea kid
---
It rarely is, but does make you more likely to crash into things, or give away an incoming dead hard.
---
Same but Julie.
---
I‚Äôm sure Frank won‚Äôt mind. owo‚Äù
---
I think the biggest thing would be not making him only chainsaw.  Add some additional power for him to use.  I think hes mostly fine as is though. Currently he's pretty faithful to his movie imo, even how people run him with insidious camping.    
---
  
---
Id rather see a rework/buff to trapper or wraith.
---
How do you catch pasta on fire tho
---
Doctor, Clown, LF
---
All can be looped, with no map pressure
---
Lol
---
I don‚Äôt want this isolation
---
Np, its ok that happens a lot xD especially with swf some of them good and some of them bad
---
Hmmm is the spirit your main?
---
Because if she.. you have to search some vids how to mindgame the survivor and you will be so pretty good at her..
---
Yet all the blind idiots give them thousands of upvotes as if pretending it took some effort.
---
To be honest you have a point they should probably add some additional powers. He is faithful to the movies. However in the movies he had insane endurance when it came down to running and being able to take a hit. Maybe a cool passive ability to know where pallets are. Something of the sesh would be interesting
---
Do you guys just never move your camera? If you watch the killer you can anticipate his next move, and then you can turn your camera to look for a path to take, and then, now here‚Äôs the kicker, you can turn the camera back around and watch the killer again.
---
Accurate
---
It's not just when the killer lags. 
---
IT'S. EVERY. GODDAMN. TIME.
---
OH FUCK U
---
Who is LF
---
Survivors also have perks that reward them for failing. For instance decisive strike ( only about half the time ). Sometimes survivors that aren‚Äôt being tunnelled just get killed so quickly because the killer is destroying them. then they get downed before the 1 minute, and the killer gets stunned and loses 1 hook
---
That‚Äôs the one joy of no persistent lobbies. Probably won‚Äôt see them again. Then you can just enjoy the next match
---
Are you someone who keeps smacking the hooked survivors too
---
Maybe they can give him trap-like things, where he'll laydown animal bones and it reveals the aura of survivors on top of them, or survivors working on totems since theyre bones.  
---
I remember one person stumbling into his taxidermy collection and him noticing her because of it.  Just an idea, probably too similar to Nightmares traps though.  
---
I do like the endurance idea as well.  I toyed with the idea of M1 hits giving him speed boosts or something, because it's 'for his family'.  
---
Idk, itll be interesting to see where they take it
---
Leatherface looks on in confusion
---
Balanced landing
---
Hit or miss
---
I think you faked this image but it wouldn't surprise me if it's real
---
I play both Hag and Spirit but spirit's playstyle is def my favorite. I'm going to have to watch some vids about mindgames because frankly I just can't trick anybody lol
---
Never claimed to play that way, but thanks for the insults anyway. That'll teach me for trying to play devil's advocate on this sub.
---
nice, i remember getting my first 32k. i think i got it 2ish weeks in with doctor during a half anhour game where they 3 gened themselves on lodge
---
I'm pretty sure it just increases aura reading range, not aura blocking.
---
Better hurry up though, the 13th is close
---
I do now, thanks mate!!! Epic juke

But console has a frame lock of 30fps so it wouldn't be fair against 60fps and mouse and keyboard sensitivity ect. But its always an option

Actually that's Legion after being hit with Head On.
---
I usually heal out of paranoia since im not very good in a chase, and to counter that I like to sneak around, but when my injuries are dummy thicc, the clap of my skin flaps keeps alerting the killer.
---
Haven‚Äôt laughed like this since ‚ÄúE‚Äù
---
You could say when 4 no mither join the game
---
If you like to set up around 3 close gens, might I suggest someone like Doctor, Trapper, or Hag? They all bring something different to the table, but really shine when they guard 3 close gens.
---
Best part is, these killers all benefit from each other's perks. 
---
M&amp;A from Doc reduces terror radius by 8m when not chasing. Bad on Doc, good on Hag because she has a small terror radius.
---
Unnerving Prescence from Trapper makes skillchecks harder. Really good on Doc because Doc makes skillchecks really difficult already.
---
Brutal Strength is good on both Doc and Trapper, since they do a lot of chasing.
---
Hex: Ruin is just the best perk for killers who spend lots of time setting traps or using a power that doesn't down survivors.
---
If any of these killers stand out to you, go ahead and ask me a bit about them. I'm a long time Doc main, and love playing Trapper and Hag to switch it up from time to time.
---
Are you standing on something or just floating?
---
Someone who was probably either found first or got hit with EW3 first.
---
I definitely see how the last one is a bit situational, but from my experience as playing killer, a solid 50% or more teams have someone with Decisive Strike. And Ruvik‚Äôs will would definitely have a lot of uses for legion, yeah. But I doubt it‚Äôs any more OP than some of the perks already in the game, like how OP Noed can be for killers, or DS for survivors. 
---
The ability is definitely a tad OP, however there‚Äôs a large drawback which is the ‚Äúflashing black screen‚Äù I mentioned. It‚Äôs very hard to explain, but let‚Äôs just say that if your within 48 metres, you will absolutely know he‚Äôs just teleported. That being said, other than the teleport and high movement speed, he‚Äôs really restricted to M1s.
---
If he was added (I know he won‚Äôt be, but this is just a hypothetical) I wouldn‚Äôt even see him making the top 4 killers, as Billy, Nurse, Spirit and Huntress just have more strengths.

So yeah, it's nice to see someone who understands that winning isn't everything and has some chill.

I haven‚Äôt heard any Dems talking about this either, it‚Äôs going unnoticed which is the problem. Dems are focusing on illegals when they should be focusing on this. It‚Äôs both parties imo because they are both turning a blind eye or don‚Äôt notice it‚Äôs going on.
---
True, I think that his lunge should be reduced to a tier 1 or 2 michael lunge to balance out the ability maybe.
---
No shit, sherlock
---
Remember, Hope lasts for 2 minutes but Endgame timer will slow down if someone is downed or hooked. I think the slowed down timer is like 3 minutes, so fair warning, Hope might not last the whole time.

Where can I find it? Sorry, I'm kinda new.

Never Go Alone would be broken beyond belief

So what happened was I had already bought him but when I tried to use the ofdering to play him someone d/c'd thunking it was a mori. I switched onto freddy himself. But yes I love him rework!

Definitely. I was leaning towards extending the time between attacks too.

Right?

Did you fr get offended I called you rank 15 in a video game lol

Still don't really get the DC though, why not just go AFK?

Damn, Save the Best For Last and Play With Your Food with Dying Light.

Yeah, after that he would seem pretty balanced. Good idea for a new licensed killer!

Gl on your quest! Any suggestions who I should do next? I have all non licensed characters and ghostface. Hag is only p3-50

at least the one dude gets it

It's pretty clear we don't agree and won't ever agree, u think Ruin is needed, I don't, let's just leave it here instead of going in circles. Have a great rest of your day man.

I reckon they just discovered his stand ability is blood warden

I'm sorry :(
---
Hopefully one day console can enjoy custom icons too!
---
Nurse is about to be outclassed...
---
Telling him gg makes him think he was playing right though, and as we know, camping is neither good for the survivor being camped nor the killer. You should at least inform him of why that is bad play.

I mean this in the nicest way, but get good? It‚Äôs quite rewarding to finally catch players like that. They‚Äôll taunt you so you obsess about them. Just go kill their friends instead and don‚Äôt give them any air. Then slap them with noed and bathe in their salty tears after the game

He listed out all the double pallets on Gideon's and you think he said there are no pallets. Good job redditor! Way to demonstrate that ability to read!
---
And something can be super unfavorable to one side but you can still lose while using it. Ever heard of Nurse? She's top tier but some people just can't make her work for them.

He says Gideon's is survivor-sided, but he has trouble due to the confusing sound of the terror radius.

My good sir this is a discussion. If people aren't going to come and actually submit ideas no matter how outlandish then what's the point. Also if you were going to do Jaws you run into the problem of the shark. Either you're going to make it a humanoid or you're going to bring back somebody from the dead has a ghost with shark like features. Kind of like a drowned zombie.

Don‚Äôt worry, here are some quick definitions for you new killer players!

---
Tunneller: 99% of the time you play fairly as a good killer
---
Both: 100% of the time you played against salty survivors
---
People have been saying that since she came out
---
I‚Äôm a solid rank 7-6 killer on console if I had to guess, or at least I was like a month or two ago lol haven‚Äôt been super active so I figured I didn‚Äôt need to try-hard. Bill was the first survivor I found and I could instantly tell he was a rank 20, running past jungle gyms to a dead zone... I knew he was too precious to kill right then and there and decided if anyone would escape, it‚Äôd be him. Getting kills isn‚Äôt everything, so long as I‚Äôm having fun, it‚Äôs chill. The rank 7 though felt like a rank 20, probably thinking that i would be trash so they didn‚Äôt think they needed to try lol 
---
On a side note, got my friend who played DBD a few times like right after it got ported to PS4 but hasn‚Äôt played since to play with me earlier. they were a proper rank 20, it was fun hearing her react to the killer, screaming as soon as she got in her first chase lol
---
It‚Äôs under options. You can change some button assignments.
---
Can you change wiggle?
---
The initial idea behind him is easier to hit chainsaw but whitout billy map presence. The result is harder to hit chainsaw whitout map presence. ....
---
Nah I agree playing against hag is for sure the least fun. 99% of hag players don‚Äôt know how to use her traps right and it just devolves in to advanced camping.
---
The problem with Wake Up is that Leader actually works better. 
---
Leader has gives your nearby teammates a 25% boost to totem cleansing, healing, searching chests, unhooking, sabotage, and *opening exit gates*.
---
Wake Up gives you a 15% boost to opening the exit gates, reveals them to you, and gives your team info on where you are when you are opening a gate. This isn't even close to as good. 
---
Leader is active all game. You will use it more than once, on kore than one action, and, you speed up more than one person at a time. 
---
Wake Up is active for less actions, it's also slower than Leader, and you have to get both gates *yourself* to get maximum effectiveness.
---
So Wake Up actually has to do better than Leader to be competitive for gate opening. And Leader would still be a better use of the perk slot.
---
It's a bit of an odd concept, for sure. Here's a quick video I altered to show what it would look like from the survivor's perspective: https://imgur.com/9MonPq7
---
So if the killer is the only one with access to both basement entrances, they'd sort of Portal in if they enter from the other entrance.
---
takes 50 hours to get an excellent survivor build and a decent killer build on billy w/o any dlc content.
---
idk why anyone complains there is literally like 20 playable perks across killers &amp; survivors
---
STOP UNLOCKING FUCKKNG GARBAGE PERKS AND YOU WOULDNT SEE THEM IN BLOODWEBS
---
Oh lmao. That usually happens with me I'm stalking them then I tier up and most of the time that survivor starts running
---
Securing a kill is food if you just want to win and the survivors aren't doing gens while you kill em.
---
For best results use Insidious on Leatherface and rev the chainsaw
---
Just saying but the game has been out for years, so not really an excuse. I still play the game it just sucks when it happen you know?
---
hey man mind me asking what you use to record? It looks super good!
---
Please wear this outfit on Halloween.
---
you are right. Game is more fun when you play for fun and not for pips.
---
My headphones (turtle beach x42 , wireless with optic cable connection) cost me usd$60 about 6 years ago. They weren‚Äôt cheap but weren‚Äôt exactly expensive either. The fact they are still going strong shows I got my money‚Äôs worth
---
Swing and a miss, I play both sides quite heavily.  As a killer you should be aiming to end games with gens up.  NOED is conceding pre lobby that you don't have the ability to achieve this and need to plan for not having them by using the poorest designed perk currently left in the game post MoM and Decisive rework.  Needing to rely on a zero effort instadown earned by playing unoptimally  to bail you out of games is an unhealthy place to be in.  Good groups will wreck you as they cleanse totems to prevent your crutch from even spawning.  At that point you're at the mercy of the loops you never learned how to counterplay because you were too busy sucking out games with NOED instead of learning the various mechanics of playing the role of killer.
---
A lot of games it‚Äôs bass response to ear footsteps coming, not necessarily volume
---
You just need to work on your ability to chase and down survivors, it can be really hard at first but once you get more game sense and knowledge it should come easier. Just try your best and don‚Äôt let 0k games get you down, once you get better you should be able to get 4ks semi-consistently üëç
---
Nice, always fun getting people to try out horror games. When I learned about this game, I just had to get my mom to try it, at least once. She's super excitable, and is so tense, it's contagious. Definitely upped the experience with her freaking out.

Yeah he really meant people are wearing a pig head irl. Its obviously a joke my guy.

I do like Hag and her teleports.  I keep getting Doctor dailies so I'm getting used to the switching between his two sets.

None of my characters are above level 10, most are around 5, so I need to invest in them more and play more.

Thank you so much for the tips, i really appreciate it!

I haven't played as the Trapper, maybe twice?  Pretty satisfying getting someone in a trap but I only did it once.

How do you manage to set traps but still be mindful of gens popping?

The best perk ever

"HEY SALLY! WAKE UP!"

I'm with you on the one hook before ruin gets found, but what do you want, the totems to be invisible? Barely being able to see it is as fair as it gets, now I'm just patiently waiting for this to be implemented in all maps

I'll do that, as I bought him and I'm using him a bunch to get my money worth.  Him and Myers are who I use if I don't have a specific killer daily and I want the bonus points from my first killer play of the day.

Thanks for the encouragement!

A vast number of perks are win-win; spirit fury rewards the killer for getting hit by pallets, make your choice rewards the killer for survivor unhooks, and so forth. That‚Äôs simply the nature of perks: to make the killer better at particular parts of the game. As for rewarded for failing, the same can be said for survivor perks: decisive strike rewards you for getting picked up, etc. The trade-off with NOED is that, while it has a very powerful effect, it is easy to shut down and is only usable in the last few moments of a losing game, effectively playing the majority of the match with three perks. The game‚Äôs not over once the gates are open; it just becomes easy for the survivors to win in most cases. If a survivor gets hit by an endgame ability that could have been shut down in the midgame, well, that‚Äôs life.

Sounds a bit like my Myers build, thanks

Way harder to do on console
---
Yeah, believe me I kick myself for not getting it on the shrine...
---
And I‚Äôm a fool and didn‚Äôt get it off the shrine a few weeks ago... sigh
---
57.6% means that the full value of all my perks leveled (3 x all my level 3 perks, 2 x all my level 2 perks, 1 x all my level 1 perks) equals 57.6% of the total perks in the game, or 102 Bloodwebs total to level up each perk once.
---
Shoulda got spirit lmao
---
Hope it‚Äôs Stranger Things tbh. Killer- Demogorgon survivor- Joyce or Hopper.
---
And also, think about it like this: The only point of rank right now is so that strong survivors play against strong killers, and weak survivors play against weak killers.
---
I don't think the game should depip you for it, that needs to be changed, but if the killer is chasing someone else around the map the whole game, it would be bad to give you a pip for that. The game can't tell if you're a strong or weak survivor if you just do gens for the entire time while the killer's elsewhere.
---
You forgot the /s bubby
---
"You don't know why they DCed. Maybe their house was on fire." This man's house *was* on fire.
---
Yeah, I believe this is the reason why. Maybe if they re-add it, only Myers should be able to hear it.
---
They work on different ga- mmmmm
---
I thought most Rank 1s main Billy or Nurse
---
I'm surprised no one has hit you with downvote salt yet
---
Like I said in the past, DBD could really use an endorsement system like Overwatch has. Not only will encourage more player positivity and lessen the salt, it can also help lessen the BP grind. And of course, you should not be able to endorse friends. Also, an avoid teammate for survivors would be great. I don't want to play with people who deliberately throw the game.

That sounds amazing. My mom isn't creeped out by me and my brother talking about it, she usually tunes us out, but she gets super freaked out whenever she watches and the killer happens to be near me.

Okay but that Billy is actually blind as shit.
---
Currently waiting on DS to pop up but it hasnt.
---
So what actually happens at 40 where the perks become teachable?  Does the game direct me on how to do that?
---
Thanks for all of this great information!
---
Yeah, since the game loses the scare factor after you get into it, having your mom nearby really brings it back and just makes the game so much more fun.
---
Whenever I see someone try, one of them usually gets hooked.
---
is this the new game mode
---
Totems are part of your objective, just like defending the generators are only part of the killers objective. If defending 5 gens was the only objective, then all of Freddy's perks would be useless.
---
What would Hillbilly's be?
---
Bro that's why I censored myself. And you just said it yourself uncensored so that's kinda hippo critical.
---
Hahaha.. I had a game where I was lowkey hoping the killer would just end me because i had to take a dump.
---
Those would be tight. Old school Trapper I'd grab in a heartbeat
---
slightly less lumpy
---
Literally just did this xD
---
If you camp a survivor who ran you for awhile or as a lot of people will call ‚Äútoxic‚Äù then you‚Äôre just feeding them and taking a free loss
---
Nah man our boy "Jesus johanson* knows I'm spreading the good word
---
I've been on hiatus from the PC version since the clown was the latest killer and waiting for the Switch version, but for $40, I'm not really sure I want to dip my toes into fresher pastures of green. What are they including in it to jack the price up so much compared to other versions beyond "Switch tax" that most games have?
---
Alright, will do. Thanks for the help!
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä

My goal is to kill survivors so fuck what they say. They‚Äôre not supposed to like it.
---
No problem. Also, just in case I've misunderstood, if you learn a characters teachables and then prestige, you keep them. You don't lose teachables when you prestige.
---
o shit freddy beefin with billy. One disfigured boi vs another
---
I usually use leatherface and basically every perk shows me where they are constantly. It‚Äôs fun.
---
"Just green rank" lol I feel disrespected
---
Your right though as an avid user of huntresses lulliby (its like a sneaky less severe ruin so it goes unnoticed till ots too late i love it) i hate when totems are super obvious but i also use hunted grounds and thats freaking hilarious when its obvious
---
And one day, I just uh felt like runnin
---
I think you‚Äôre right. Thanks!!
---
Yeah, it's a nice change of pace seeing players who really enjoy the game and having fun as opposed to getting super toxic players in my own games.
---
So does your flair check out after the Freddy update orrrr
---
It's not necessarily just the jumpscare. Its is he jumpscare? Is he Infinite T3? Is he FUCK YOU YOU'RE DEAD tombstone meyers? You never know until it happens with him. Its like no other killer, there's no preparing for it. No other killer has addons that drastically alter their power into a completely different playstyle - you dont see Billy with an addon that changes the chainsaw into a lasso (though thatd be sick).
---
I prefer to roam constantly but if I hook some survived that‚Äôs been taunting me then fuck that guy. I‚Äôm standing right in his face until he gives up and dies. That‚Äôs better than a win.
---
I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs a reason to dc. Just walk away from the game and if the match is still going when you get back keep playing
---
I enjoy hooking then going stealth then rushing in to the hook rescue with Leatherface‚Äôs special and downing both. Good times.
---
It will be the buggiest thing in existence. On top it‚Äôs going to divide bhvrs attention more for a port that will need a bunch of care and won‚Äôt have a ton of players in the first place.
---
My preferred build is adrenaline, prove thyself, bond, and we‚Äôre gonna live forever. It‚Äôs not a build for everyone

https://youtu.be/-gSGzkvMkLU . Graphically speaking the game looks great for the switch aside form horrible skills this player has lol.

I want switch version to at least have a chance

ioS13 will be adding Bluetooth compatible with the ps4 controller, dunno about anything else, will probably be released same time official mobile release.

I wouldn‚Äôt play mobile for any other reason than shits and giggles and to ACTUALLY test and feedback, plus the system seems to be the old build when the game came out, I noticed I‚Äôm not getting 1k for dull totems anymore and it‚Äôs back to the 600

Yeah, tbf it's almost like going beyond the level of 50... Orrr... Well, depends on your prestige level
---
I‚Äôve seen gameplay of mobile and trust me it looks quite worse than the switch. Also I have an Xbox and unfortunately I don‚Äôt have time to just sit down and play. I rarely have a chance to stay in one room for at least 30 minutes. If I can play dead by Daylight while doing laundry then that will make my life a little more enjoyable. Also the switch version can help fix those problems by giving the dbd team more capital for the ship (dbd). I feel it will do more good than harm if sold well

I got Freddy and got the Adept achievement on my 3rd game

I agree. Three gen docs are practically holding games hostage.

Definition of cosplay

---
Totems just need a overhaul in general, people in solo apparently want a totem timer ( guess we‚Äôre just asking for free handouts now) for how many are remaining on the map.
---
This ‚Äòongoing totem rework‚Äô eXcUsE has been going on for over a Y E A R!!!!!
---
Some maps they did better with the totem reworks but obviously from the SS there leaves much to be desired....
---
What I mean, is that sometimes the killer kills the survivors so quickly ( he had time to already hook 1 or 2 survivors ) He then comes by a random survivor which happens to be the guy with DS, and then the guy with DS gets downed very quickly and is able to stun the killer because he sucks at chases
---
I dont makes feel chill and not have to take the game so seriously. Cant imagine this game without listening to music.
---
Looks like I'll be buying Hag, I need the fucking ruin to slow the game down-
---
Yeah there isnt much to do to run away from the killer, the game is made so he eventually gets you, what you want to try to do is when you hear the heart beat, go full awareness and run the opposite way from the killer, best thing is to leave before he gets close but if hes already close look for a pallet and try to run around it twice before dropping it on the killer then when hes stunned or hes breaking it you run to another pallet bro and do the same, try not to just get to a pallet and drop it, it screws everyone else over later in the game.
---
Well if you hardly play then your pretty casual and the mobile and switch versions are good for causal stuffs but I‚Äôm more focused on other issues that affect frequent players more
---

Different PCs have different FPS so thats not really a good argument.

If you tbag and click that flashlight, you're playing like a douchebag. I don't support the face camping thing though, only two times I'll ever camp are when the other 3 are immediately circling for a save, where I'll just spread hits around until everyone is injured then commit to one. The only other time is when the exit gates are powered, as at that point, you gotta do what you gotta do, don't have to take any pleasure in it though.
---
Me too. How do I save the last minute?

Basing on the lists form good streamers 
---
The worst one is leatherface, he has an instadown and shit but his power is very hard to use (long charge, slows you down, shitty acceleration) so you can‚Äôt use it unless someone makes a huge mistake (so he has no power other than camping) AND on top of that, he‚Äôs just a worse hillbilly
---
Second one is wraith. While having some cool add-on combos, his base power is just ‚Äúyou walk around the map slightly faster‚Äù as his stealth sucks (he‚Äôs clearly visible across the map) and his power can be barely used during the chase, especially when there are windows around
---
Those two are reliably put on the 2 last spots. Everyone argues about the third.
---
OhTofu suggested, that nurse, spirit, hillbilly, huntress, freddy and hag are the top 6 in that order, wraith and Leatherface are top 2 worst killers and the rest is ‚Äúin between‚Äù in any order one likes as they are hard to determine
---
Mid to low purple has the best survivors. Red ranks, especially rank 1, has by far  probably the worst survivors.
---
You might gets gens done more often but if you aren't hard carrying against a killer running overkill perks (happens often at red ranks) your team will fall like dominoes cause they insist on hiding behind trees.
---
XD
---
 Asic idea is if the pallet is safe break it as soon as the surv starts abusing it, if its unsafe leave it till after the chase.
---
No welcome to the club. Anything you do is camping, tunneling or toxic. And doing gens or the objective is the worst possible thing to do. All joking aside just don‚Äôt stand directly infront of a survivor as killer and do gens as a survivor. I would be down to give you more tips if u tell what killer/survivor you main.
---
STBFL doesn‚Äôt affect the cooldown on her ambush attack though so it‚Äôs pointless on pig.
---
please not another one
---
Well bhvr is almost done with cleaning their shit with Freddy and legion reworks being done, maps being updated, bloodweb being fixed, maybe it's time to look at misses nurse, her add on changes is not enough, most people play without them.
---
Also more nerfs for pig.

What‚Äòs the point of doing that?

End Game Collapse made it so the game does not go in forever, what do you mean. It is equally right for both sides imo. Who ever finds the hatch first is how it currently is... it is almost like you are saying the killer should be able to close the hatch and the survivor must still do gens??? Fairness should be in order. I play Killer AND Survivor. I think things are fine on both sides, but the killer honestly has the advantage usually if they know what they are doing.
---
You aren‚Äôt meant to ‚Äúescape‚Äù, you are meant to take as much of the killer‚Äôs time  as possible before going down
---
windows and pallets are your friend, but I‚Äôd watch a ‚Äúlooping tutorial‚Äù first to know how to use them
---
For the legion, are we fucking Susie or Frank?

You can gain a bunch of Tokens though base attacks and then always Ambush attack your obsession.

The thing banning changed icons would be EAC. Devs stated that they won't unban anyone who's getting banned by EAC.

30 seconds haste is ridiculous

This would be so cool for streamers who play killer and would let viewers watch from this perspective.
---
We're all rank 20 just restarted
---
Guess you did not make the right rotation then huh?
---
what is camping?
---
Yep, it's like, few hundred hour sink before you can even think about some decent builds for one side. If you wanna play both sides equally, well, you fucked.
---
Honestly, survivors outnumber killers.  If you don‚Äôt do or agree with what they say is ok, you‚Äôll probably get downvoted.

Borrowed time often makes some really clutch moments if you play altruistically.
---
You also can't go wrong with an exhaustion perk up your sleeve - balanced landing, dead hard, etc.
---
Hopefully one day when the lawsuit gets resolved they will add him. He seems to be the only popular killer missing.
---
Doesn't it count as a surprise attack if you hit a survivor very fast after you see them, right as you enter a chase?
---
I just want to know the basic things that are frowned upon. Usually all games have advanced rules for too players where certain perks/things are seen as a crutch. Most advanced players frown upon crutches cause they make everything too simple.
---
If that is the case, I apologise, it‚Äôs been a little while since I‚Äôve played.
---
who is this guy?
---
Yea. It doesn't worth to Wake up! when you can open gates faster with leader and leader is active   the entire game. Wake up was just a sh*t and i tried to make it more viabele and crazy bcz for a perk that you can use just once it shoud be crazy amd i tried to make it(crazy). A maximum of 110% of faster open gates is beter i think but i think only swf would take the andvantege of this perk bcz in solo matches,even with the aura would be hard so i still think how to make it better
---
There is no perk that does that. Survivors can crouch over them to stop them from triggering, as well as use flashlights to destroy them (the latter would still give a notification).
---
A bit game breaking
---
His/my name is UPLAYN2
---
I‚Äôm a Level 80 and didn‚Äôt know you can destroy traps with a flashlight. Learn something new every day
---
Urban Evasion helps vs Hags traps since you dont lose Speed while crouching but Other than that There is no perk which negates them
---
Yeah. The only popular killer tall enough. I would really like to see The Thing somehow. I would also like to see Pennywise but "The Clown" is taken and The Doctor is based around fear, like Pennywise is.
---
Fucking Japanese teen corpses, how many fucked up shit you gonna get from do you think?
---
Wow I never knew that. Thanks for telling me, it's a shame the game never tells you about that while playing the hag, at least the crouch workaround. 
---
Dont know because I haven't tried it, but can you crouch and perform an action then too? Had a trap placed directly on the door lever yet it never activated and the door was open, so how could someone crouch on top of it, stand up to do the lever, and crouch down without it ever being activated?
---
I don't know if what I said is true, hence wording it as a question. Wouldn't those count as surprise attacks, though?
---
I thought surprise attacks only worked on killers with a stealth ability, wraith, pig and (I assume) ghostface.
---
I made this rework in idea of "Wake up dude,the killer is comming,open this faster" . i unerstand what do you want to say but for this  situasion i dont is necesary
---
He probably panicked
---
Yes, you can crouch and do an action at the same time. So you can do stuff like open doors, work on gens, heal teammates, and perform hook saves without triggering traps as long as you hold crouch when you start and end the action.

Xbox - Rosie Laaad. Rank 7 survivor rank 12 killer, looking for people to play with who don‚Äôt take the game seriously and who have decent banter whilst player. If you complain about the game I ain‚Äôt got time to listen to that.
---
I wasn't sure if this idea had been pitched before, but I had the thought of it while playing earlier today, and thought it would be a cool implementation into the game
---
Its better then getting super aids
---
Thank you so much for that explanation!  I need to start leveling these killers up!  I've been purposely going after perks as I hate losing items when I die.  I'll start using them once I get a better handle on characters.
---
* Common image repost.
---
The traps only activate if you‚Äôre walking or running over them. Survivors are standing still when performing actions like unhooking or opening doors, so traps don‚Äôt activate.
---
oh my god. I'm cracking up lmfao!
---
In some situations Hook Camping is a legit strategy, especially in a 4-man SWF group you know it's easier to make 'em come to you that way. Is it fun, no, is it fair, maybe not for the guy on the hook, but in the end it's a gameplay mechanic and if you insta save 3 times you really believe I'm going to walk away again?
---
Happened to me just this morning...while I was running a tombstone Meyers. The Nea fed my EW until Tier 3 lmao. DC sound effect twaaang'd the second my knife went in.

i was thinking that but i wouldn't know if they'd do that because she's a kid. If they ever were able to add Jason i was hoping they'd add Tina from part VII since she is psychic too (even though they'd just add Tommy because recognizability)

Killers used to dodge a lot of lobbies,

this is a forces system by BHVR to make that happen less.

I am one of the few that think that a shapeshifter killer might be useful, but not as many people think. a shapeshifter is not supposed to fool survivors to approach him or to walk directly towards them expecting them to not know it is the killer. a shapeshifter should apprach survivors without being noticed and attack by surprise, in other words: a shapeshifter killer should be like a ninja, stay hidden and only come out to attack and the survivor disguise should be treated like camouflage not an invisibility cape. It also needs a power that helps him down survivors in chases.
---
Now about the perks, those are not perks. they are add ons for that specific killer.
---

---
School is out until after September starts where I live. We recognize summer until late September here.
---
Mix of both. I love licensed killers like Pig and Freddy, but at the same time there's misses. Ghostface shows they have no idea what the appeal of licensed killers is, or they wouldn't have cheaped out and actually got the Scream licensing.
---
Also, there's a LOT of people who rally for killers from obscure shit movies that never took off.

Did you make this yourself?

Good stuff!

But if i wanted to start using blending and messing with DBD models how should i start?

His perk fire up is criminally underrated.
---
I have unlocked all perks on both survivor and killer, and I have one P3 survivor with all the perks on and one P3 killer with all the perks on
---
I don't mind camping if the gates are open. Unless you have NOED, you're probably not gonna hook anyone else, so why leave and risk letting the hooked survivor get away? That being said, camping any other time is stupid and does more harm to both killer and survivors.
---
Its also good to mention, adrenaline overrides your exhaustion. So if you use Dead hard, and it kicks in, you get haste and the heal still. 
---
Now after that? You fucked lol.
---

Dude, the clown is a fat dude that throws anesthetics in bottles, outside of being a clown he has nothing to do with Pennywise, besides, like Heznarrt said, we have the Hillbilly and Leatherface and Legion and Ghostface, and those are actually related. Don't lose hope on seeing him eventually.
---
A little bit
---
Ds punishes the killer for tunneling, not for because the survivor has been hit.
---
Adrenaline rewards the survivor for succesfully looping the killer and getting an second chance of actually escaping. None of those perks you're talking about does any of that.
---
That is all Ghostface (movie) is. Teens that like to dress up and stab people.
---
I once had to DC outta a really great pig game cuz my microwave caught fire, sucked too cuz I had a bloody party streamer so that wasted but at least my house didn't catch fire lmao
---
that can be complete rng based on survivors spawn and if people hide as they hear terror radius killers dont actually have time to search around a gen before another will get done
---
Looks like Rick Astley
---
That's kinda ridiculous. It's the same person in almost all of his games - that wouldn't happen unless someone was TRYING to do it. He played for 6 hours the other day and all but one of his killer games had the same guy in it. It doesn't matter if this person does it to others when the target streamer isn't online, just seeking to constantly get into the games is bad enough.
---
I once had to dc because I had to carry the groceries (I could‚Äôve 4ked)
---
This deserves more upvotes
---
Btw why only killers get BP when somebody DC but survs that are in-game dont get anythink from this?
---
Nope.
---
The game will look awful and have a tiny playerbase. On top of that, trying to play online games on-the-go is extremely laggy.
---
Ah yes. This. I went against a swf group today with nurses, devour, hex, and bbq. Killed the rank 15, 6, and 5. The rank 4 got the hatch when the rank 5 d/c'd. They proceeded to tell me all about how I was the worst try hard because of my perks. I'm a rank 14 killer. Just wow.
---
more like house &gt; dbd
---
Yeah pc is locked 60fps.  360s on controller killers would be really easy because of the low sensitivity (of course not all but most would)
---
Gotta love the classic "Survivor's Rulebook for Killers."
---
I love how you're so desperate for attention, you have to come on here to try and irritate people
---
The only thing we know is loop.
---
Waaaaaat....noooooo I don‚Äôt do thissssssssss..
---
I noticed that I misspelled it after I posted it, but it wouldn‚Äôt let me change it ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
When a holiday event is goin on and you find the killer
---
Wouldn't be a bad idea if you wanted to test out a new killer/survivor or had them at a lower level and don't want to risk losing badly.
---
The accumulated salt from the past games are reacting.
---
I was like really you're going to take the moral high ground? You're using a level 15 to bully baby killers and get easy pips. Wow.
---
My very first thought when they leaked Ghostface was that it was going to be another guy running with a knife like Legion. Thankfully he plays different but yeah, there is definitely similarities there.
---
Click the link, there should be a Download box in the top right corner.
---
I don‚Äôt believe it
---
Downloading it makes it not a folder though, it's like a .7p file? Im not at my computer anymore for the night so i can't recollect, but i don't need to sign in or have drop box on the computer right?
---
So the rank 2 ran the killer all game, you did obj, and the other 2 just immersed into the map? Harsh. There‚Äôs a lot of players afraid to ‚Äúget their toes in the water‚Äù so to speak. Sorta sounds like a 3 man team with the more experienced of the group ‚Äúleading the charge.‚Äù
---
Urbz over that stuff
---
the new human centipede movies looks crazy
---
Grabs are bugged.
---
That is why instead of saying mori me plz you say MORI ME DICKHEAD
---
I started the game and I got a trail of notifications, where a player had been throwing down pallets, I go down to the basement to find all 4 lockers being thrown open and shut as the players entered and exited. It made me laugh - they all had head-on so we just grinded bps for a little while.
---
It happens enough for you to make a reddit post about it. it's annoying but just move on otherwise like I said maybe its something else your doing, after all you DC and you have toxic Nea on your profile so if they are like me and you are toxic in games maybe they don't want to save you.
---
My fist and the wall
---
Have you taped paper to your face?
---
So the main ones are ruin, noed, camping and tunneling
---
Sometimes also slugging (downing someone and not hooking them)
---
Terms Camping and Tunneling are vague, so let me break it down for you
---
Camping: basic definition - standing close to the hooked survivor
---
Some survivors will give you shit for ‚Äúcamping‚Äù even when you know there are multiple survivors close by. Don‚Äôt care about those. Even the game doesn‚Äôt give you the ‚Äústanding close to a hooked survivor‚Äù penalty when survivors are close.
---
Some survivors will also give you shit for camping when the gens are done and gates open/at 99% even tho for most killers it‚Äôs impossible to get another kill at this point and there‚Äôs no reason to leave the hook. Also don‚Äôt care about those
---
There‚Äôs also face camping, camping but literally putting your face against the survivor. They really hate those.
---
There‚Äôs also proxy-camping, AKA patrol camping. It‚Äôs when the killer is patrolling the area around the hooked survivor
---
The range at which you‚Äôre camping depends on which killer you‚Äôre playing
---
For most killers it‚Äôs 16 meters 
---
For hag, billy, spirit and nurse it‚Äôs 40 meters
---
For huntress it‚Äôs whereever within the line of sight 
---
Tunneling: deliberately trying to get one survivor killed. 
---
Some survivors will give you shit for hitting the unhooked person when they‚Äôve been unhooked right next to you. Don‚Äôt care about those. If you can‚Äôt down the unhooker. Hitting the unhooked is the correct play. You have a free down (unless the unhooker had borrowed time, which makes them have to mend before healing so it‚Äôs not so bad) and you take away benevolent points from the unhooker.
---
Some survivors think it‚Äôs tunneling when they run into you after getting unhooked and you down them
---
Some survivors think it‚Äôs tunneling when you randomly stumble upon then OR when the unhooker hide and you only found the unhooked survivor
---
Some survivors think it‚Äôs tunneling when you even go toward the unhook notification even when you knew nothing about where other survivors are
---
Ignore all those
---
The only real tunneling:
---
1. Leaving your current chase right as an unhook happens with and intention of down the unhooked person
---
2. Ignoring all the bodyblocks and straight up going for the down even when the injured person is kinda far away
---
My manners are my curse.
---
Ever thought that they *tried* to get the licence to Scream?
---
Hell, the people who OWN Scream couldn't even get the mask for the first 2 seasons of the TV show. Odds are the whole Weinstein situation made getting the Scream licence impossible.
---
I believe the real question here is, why haven't \*you\* taped paper to your face?
---
I know that in the first movie there were 2, in the second there were 1 or 2 (I can‚Äôt remember if the mom ever actually puts on the costume and does some murdering or if she was just an accomplice the entire time), in the third there was 1, in the 4th there was 1 (I remember crazy bitch, but I can‚Äôt remember if she had an accomplice or not), and in the show... okay, NGL, I watched 2 episode of the show and it bored the shit out of me so I have no idea what happens.  Anyway, I know Ghostface is a different person every movie, but at least they all have some tangental relationship to the original 2 killers (other than the show probably) or were inspired by them.  This The Ghost Face^TM has no relation or reference to anything in the series, and is just an original character wearing the mask (and not the full costume) of a recognizable killer in the hopes of getting some cheap sales.
---
Also, I never said that Ghostface would have to have voice acting by the original actor(s/ actresses), Pig and Freddy don‚Äôt say shit in game and they‚Äôre quite chatty in their respective movies.

I‚Äôm not trying to be a dick man but this idea gets suggested every two seconds here on the subreddit despite the fact that it will never ever work in this game, and the devs have already addressed the idea and that it wouldn‚Äôt work.
---
My display name on my Reddit profile is a joke because some people are like Nea main = toxic. I'll only flashlight click when I'm listening to The Anthem by Good Charlotte. I only ever DC for 2 reasons unless I'm in an "I don't give a fuck" mood
---
Giggity
---
just stop having manners then D:
---
Oh I am sorry I didn't realise its not toxic if your flash light clicking to a song only you can hear or that the DC doesn't count because you didn't feel like it. Clearly my mistake for somehow confusing these things as toxic behaviour to anyone else in the game.
---
It should release fairly soon. Usually(if i remember right) a chapter lasts 3 months or so.
---
This is like asking if you'll get something for a product you bought years ago going on sale now.
---
Caping is fine at the end of a match, they were just dumb for going for the save instead of leaving and securing a few extra BP.
---
When I first started s friend of mine told me to keep the negative messages on my profile as a "sign of victory"

Its 12pm in the EU tho. Probably would just get a SWF group ngl. I cant be fucked to play with russians all day.
---
Good to hear. I thought the same, I told them they should‚Äôve just left. Instead, they all swarmed the shack like ants and got downed one by one. I truly expected it to be the end of the game and hoped for maybe one more down or hit by camping at the basement, but it turned into a 4K. Bad on their part.
---
Playing Killer will net you the most BP. If you have the Cannibal perk BBQ and Chili, it will boost your BP gains significantly.
---
If you only play survivor, then run David King's We're Gonna Live Forever perk.
---
I have it but it isn‚Äôt teachable. Would it work if I was able to get another survivor to tap a gen then let me break it then they tap it again and back and forth, or is there a limit?
---

---
I prefer unlicensed since you can buy them with shards but it's nice to see there was room for creativity from the devs side when they introduce a new killer they made plus the liscensed ones always come out weak as hell when released with the exception of Michael who hasn't had too many nerds or buffs
---
The ability to turn into objects.
---
Ok, it just takes so long to level up a character. Do you think I should do the break/fix technique until I level him up all the way or should I just play normal games
---
Can it be a scratch and smell sticker?
---
Play a killer you are good at, or doc or legion if you are garbage at killer, put on bbq and chili, put on any BP offering, pudding is the best, and get 60k+ depending on offerings super easy.
---
No mither, self care, and adrenaline.
---
I think they were always there but a bug caused them to be a passive sound, but now they only occur when he moves
---
yes as far as destruction catagory this usually work but its important  to pace games and dont kill people to fast you need to hunt/hit/damage/be deviousness in order to max out every category but I seen screenshots on reddit were people make about 29k with out sacrificing the whole team and that category doesnt  usually max out for me anyways so dont worry about always sacrificing as long as you do everything else to max out catagories you should be fine but sacrificing them would help a little more as well
---
We‚Äôll make it, Lithe, Urban evasion, Dark sense.

When I first played killer I sucked, I could find and chase em but kept missing hitting them. After my first game I guy went off a me for ‚Äòoverchasing‚Äô I could only laugh and tell him trust me I was trying to kill you not chase you around the whole map üòí

and she's still the best killer in the game

I was recently in a game against heavily lagging spirit, I'm talking about performing vault and still staying on the same side of wall lag.

So, that one time she hits me and I get stuck in on-hit sprint boost was laggy short distance teleportations, and it was like that for the rest of the match. I was able to heal, fix gens and still maintain that godlike speed.

The problem being that survivors who hang around hooked survivors and then complain about camping are part of the issue too. Too many survivors out there wanting killers to play by their rulebook. Just do you, don't worry about anyone else.

camping is not bannable or anything and if it's the end of the game, it's just their fault for suiciding

if they can track THAT then why not start showing the killer eho is swf? and to prevent killers from quitting on swf give them bp bonus.

---
Not to mention when they insult you for camping the last hook, doors opened, all others survivors fully healed. Apparently you are obligated by law to chase someone else while they rescue the survivor with borrowed time so everyone can escape.
---
Ok thanks a lot for the detailed answer. I think I have a problem with slugging. I often leave several players on the ground as I patrol the 3 generators I'm defending. Breaking down gens instead. At what point is slugging not ok? Any depth to this?
---
I refuse to upvote this.
---
C'mere cutie!
---
I would not call legion changes a rework. He was gutted and thrown away into the abyss like an unwanted child. He still needs his rework imho.
---
Killers usually very good per match, especially when matched up vs less skilled players.  But this means a very long game and a long matchmaking time. A selfish Solo Survivor BP takes the cake, and has almost no matchmaking wait.
---
Run We're gonna live forever,  we'll make it, Botany knowledge, self care, and bring any ol medkit.  
---
As soon as a survivor gets injured run on over to 'help'.  Body block them as soon as they are picked up for a stack of WGLF.   Then go hide and selfcare with your medkit while the killer waddles to a hook.   Let the killer wander away and go unhook and heal with we'll make it for a second stack of WGLF.       Do this once more and you are up to max WGLF stacks and you can stop body blocking.  A third hook will likely exceed your altruism cap, so it may or may not be worth it.  
---
Then go bust totems/rep gens until you get in a chase, focus on pallet stuns even if it injures you, they are worth buku points (3-4 stuns to max out boldness, less 1 for every two totems you broke).   If caught Struggle to phase 2 because toxic and you don't make bp on hook phase 1.   If the person that hook saved you follows you attempting to heal, find a gen and work it.  They will t-bag you a bit wanting to heal you and then give up and usually help with the gen giving you a co-op bonus on top of the gen repair bp.  
---
With a couple of good pallet hits you can easily get 20k points (40k after WGLF) for 5 minutes of work while a killer is in the game for up to 15-20 mins struggling to get that 30k before their next 8ish min wait in matchmaking.
---
Do I recommend this? No.  But DC's have gotten so popular it likely wont really hurt your team and its fast
---
I had a game where someone DC'd less than 30 seconds in. So I played extra nice, two hooked everyone and then let them all go. I get a message after the game "boring, play a real game next time scrub".

The most recent DBD parody by Samination perfectly sums up many of the survivors in this game. Where there is a killer rule book and if you break any of the many rules you are toxic. Give it a watch.
---
How did you get this photo of me
---
Closing the game is not an escape.
---
People camp for some reason the killers who camp when survivors did nothing toxic are bad people who easier get pissed off will camp toxic survivors then you have people who camp the hook when the exit is by the hook which is fine imo then you have the ss tier LF mains who camp to basement chest.
---
Exactly.Im talking about the campers that camp for jo good reason
---
How to tell when survivor has ds as killer?
---
I don't think so for a really good looper/chasee , even for sally you need three blinks and a fast charge to be effective. Rin too needs some speed boost in blinks and/or visual aide to have an upper hand. Just like trapper needs Iri stone and Huntress needs faster loading. No killer can win without the advantage.

Calm Spirit: Added "Crows will not fly over you when hiding within a locker or remaining inactive" \[\[\[\[This condition goes along properly with the perk and it allows them to stay still longer. This is only usable in very rare circumstances, but now the extremes are added with it.\]\]\]\]  
---
this is broken. basically just enables holding the game hostage, no effect to actual play  
---
Some of these changes aren't really good? But I like others.  
---
There's really far too many changes to comment on directly, but it seems like you hand out buffs a little bit too much- for example iron maiden is fine where it is- it already shuts down lockers hard.

It's an exhaustion glitch.

In this patch, there's a bug regarding any perks that give you exhaustion and the speed you get from them lasting forever.
---

---

---
Really it depends on my mood but if I see someone get hook bombed I‚Äôll smack them down but won‚Äôt hook them but I won‚Äôt let them go and do gens, I catch you again though hurt or not your fair game.
---
But this perk that you want is specifically for hatch/exit gate moments. Whispers can be used at the start and the end of the game REALLY well, I just don‚Äôt see why you would want something else
---
every survivors+most killers\*
---
This made me consider atheism.
---
I wouldn't say it's "relying" on Bloodhound, ideally it should be training you in survivor behaviour - Shadowborn won't really tell you when someone has juked you, and good Shadowborn technique involves practice so that you know *where to be looking when fatigue kicks in*. It's your choice, though.
---
As for NOED, it's not really "relying" on it either, and it can't really be described as a "crutch perk" since it only activates if survivors ignore totems. In addition, if the full survivor team is running around when the gates activate then it's NOED or nothing. Bear in mind that in this situation NOED extends the game - survivors may come back to save their friend, so you have more opportunity to practice your Blinking on whatever map was difficult enough to allow NOED to activate.
---
**The perks you use as you're learning are rarely going to be the perks you use when you have mastery.**
---
&gt; Are there any youtubers you know of that plays nurse at a high level without crazy addons?
---
There are no shortage of no perk and/or no add-on clips of full trial Nurse play. They are generally not commentated because it's being done only to showcase that Nurse is the most powerful killer, and the only skills required are the player's mastery of Blink and their aptitude for making the right decision when a survivor runs.
---
I did a fast search on YouTube for L√©ry's and honestly all I can find are matches with terrible survivors, matches with no commentary, matches with nothing but music, and matches where the entire commentary is how bad L√©ry's is for Nurse. I am doubtful you will find much of value, but again you're free to go and look for yourself.
---
&gt; they have so much information for each other
---
Killer knows where all the gens are - as soon as you spawn into L√©ry's, choose your 3-gen. If they go for a gen you're protecting, then you *should* be able to down them. Don't let them kite you too far from the gen - remember, they *have* to do the gens, so sooner or later they need to come to you.
---
&gt; I take too long to chase
---
Again, Nurse will never win a foot chase. A Blink chase should be about making your move at a favourable time, not just spamming a Blink and eating fatigue for no reason. Most L√©ry's videos are terrible but they at least show people making predictions (which is the core of Nurse play since most survivors are going to want to juke you so that they don't get hit).
---
If your problem is Blink chases in general, then that's a matter of time and practice.
---
If your problem is Blink chases *only on L√©ry's* then organise a Kill Your Friends game so that you can Blink around the map at leisure.
---
There's not much I can say now other than to wish you good luck as you practice her.

Even though I hate it, why not camp and tunnel? There's no punishment for it and 9 times out of 10 it pays off. At least from the games I've seen. The devs don't give a shit that your making the game boring as fuck for the person being camped and tunneled
---
i dont think people got the joke
---
Ok.
---
Thanks for the tips, I really appreciate them!
---
But you also need abs
---
Literally even playing the game and unintentionally tunneling because survivors made it easy for u is seen as toxic cause of but hurt survivors
---
EGC is already killer favored, no need to make it even more so
---
Give leatherface a rage mechanic. As objectives are done and he takes pallets to the face or gets ds‚Äôed a meter goes up that speeds up his chainsaw charge time and makes him move slightly faster.
---
Nothing too op, just make him a threat.
---
Like the movies, he freaks out and people get butchered. üòÅ
---
It means prestige three claudette. Prestiging gives you a bloody piece of clothing, resets your character, and gives you a better shot at higher level perks
---
We are still on the "fuck legion" phase is all
---
LMAO
---
Playing without music is boring but I play better..
---
Good point, good point. You won't be able to *see* it, but you just won't have that Michael Myers aura.

"Ooh that mild salsa has some serious kick to it!  Jalapenos are just mean in my tummy."

Easily my favorite white people jokes, my parents were that way, not anymore.

So many people are saying this is gross or goth or whatever just because they‚Äôll never feel anything close to the love in this picture.

It‚Äôs not your fault that you‚Äôre completely emotionally closed off... Oh wait no, it is.
---
Already got her
---
People are always like ‚Äúbro x tentacoin is dead‚Äù and im like ya I know read it again. I love it.
---
Just buy the Halloween chapter if you haven't already imo
---
Myers is actually really fun so it's def worth if you haven't got him already
---
95% of D Strikes i have seen are against people that arent even tunneling. Players are just bad and get caught soon after their savior is downed and hooked. This isnt even an unpopular opinion. Literally every top tier player agrees that decisive strike's timer needs to be lowered.
---
Freddy with Overcharge - obviously. ‚ö°Ô∏è
---
Nice !!!
---
Lol no all platforms are fine
---
I imagine The Legion were originally meant to be Ghostface, but the deal fell through. In the end, it was a case of this Ghostface, or no Ghostface.
---
What we got isn't bad. We got the iconic mask (more than the first 2 seasons of the show, which still felt very Scream). The power suits the character (though Legion's would've been better) and the weapon-wipe is straight out of Scream.
---
Also, Scream Resurrection features the costume, but no links to the movies. Ultimately, Scream has two trademarks: the mask and the voice. At least we got one.
---
I wonder if this becomes the most downvoted comment on this sub up to date.
---
Tbh even the whispers that play when Plague has corrupt purge annoy me. Like stfu im listening for survivors.
---
I liked Freddy before the rework, still do too.

PLEASE!!!
---
I kind  of disagree.  
---
Tunneling IS a viable strategy. You're the killer and you SHOULD do everything to win. If tunneling is a strategically better choice, you should do it. It's literally your role.  
---
Camping is kinda iffy though, as I don't feel that actually benefits anyone and is just boring (both as killer and survivor).
---
I leveled Jake for Iron Will for exactly this reason. Seems like the best counter to Spirit.
---
Funny you say this, because even the top survivor mains think adrenaline is bs and think the argument about noed is stupid. adrenaline has always been a get out of jail free card in a game where survivors can still pallet loop for days minus on 2 maps. makes 0 sense with your argument is invalid from that alone. claiming you earned something from end of game to deny a killer potentially even 1 kill is dumb. if they do decide to run it  then they earn it by dealing with being pallet looped, house looped, window looped and yall complain about 1 sided argument Both perks are fine just people being stupid because they get upset they dont get to live every game.
---
Honestly this is one reason I love Pig, if u lose a survivor u can crouch to instantly cut out the chase music. Then you can just stand back up and proceed with the hunt like normal.
---
I think Barb would be a better candidate for the Stranger Things chapter.

Leatherface + level 35

GREATLY appreciated.. Thanks so very much
---
If it's a kill your friends match and the host of the match is the one that's dead, that can happen when they're switching who they're spectating. It's super annoying when they're constantly doing it.
---
I concur!
---
Got room for one more?
---
Billy looks like Thanos‚Äô ball chin had a stroke.
---
Yeah i talk to my people in the stream.. I mean i feel its rude not to lol
---
Can you explain why? It doesnt seem very useful until the end game or near-end game.
---
Yes I think, if he went to the upper platform
---
I hate when they designate one dude to go break your ankles
---
Makes sense people hate you
---
Yeah bask in their hate me personally I love it I bathe in it

Lol when i played legion. people would give me salt showers .
---
Just ignore what people send you. But who you want.  Just enjoy the game. That‚Äôs what is important.  Who cares what other people think about who you buy?

As a killer those moments are so sweet... as a survivor though, oof

what are those?

No, I'm saying, before survivors had to do at least two gens to earn an escape, now they can have it for free even if they got destroyed.

Is it the mind game mechanic you don‚Äôt like or gen grab spirit?

Its not third person billy. If you watch correctly the person having the third person view of the killer is actually the hooked survivor

Keep trying. You will get there one day. I believe in you.

There are so many lag switchers.

Its not a point if it isnt excisting.

can you take this to PMs please?

Can you not make posts to earn quick karma xD
---
I do not see how that Calm Spirit change holds the game hostage. From my understanding, and the wiki, crows appear for staying within an 8 meter area which no actions are performed for 60 seconds. This includes vaulting, repairing, healing, etc etc. In terms of holding the game hostage, I think you are referring to the final survivor, when in reality, staying afk is just not good as the last survivor. Either move closer to a door or attempt to find the hatch, as you will always die if you do neither of these.  
---
Not all of the changes are designed to be good. (I'm assuming you are talking about the change making X mechanic or X perk good) They are designed to become more usable than in 1/100000 situations. For example, Slippery Meat is one of these. 
---
The reason quite a few buffs are handed out is because when it comes to balancing a game, utilizing nerfs will eventually create a threshold. Too many nerfs, and this threshold will allow for a power creep within the game. And it is always easier to dial something back if it becomes to strong, rather than dialing it up, because dialing it up can cause unforseen consequences more than nerfs can. 
---
Iron Maiden never really shut down lockers, because the hollow notification never gave a sound notification. In many situations, the killer was not able to look away, or would be to far to hear the scream from the survivor. In to many situations, the exposed effect was never able to be utilized as it took far to long to reach the location. This way both sides of the perk become usable. (In all reality, this perk is still not great.)
---
I appreciate you coming back later :D

I dunno bout anyone else but I can see wraith plain as day even in the distance

That's not that bad

What does luck actually affect
---
Since I think you guys might enjoy this amazing thread between me (The Trapper) and a pretty butthurt survive with friends. 
---
Long story short, am a Micheal one trick, felt bad about it so I wanted to play Trapper since he‚Äôs essentially an M1 killer so it would be more of a challenge. Second match, new killer, only running that one perk that allows you to break pallets faster. I kill all the survivors, don‚Äôt tunnel, don‚Äôt camp (I always make sure to leave I fucking despise tunneling/camping) and I get this gem after the match 
---
Jetli0876 (because fuck him): Reported 4x, get trumped spic
---
Me: Lmao
---
M: I got a 4 Man and I was only running a single perk
---
J: I called Sony too
---
M: GG, don‚Äôt be sore losers next time
---
J: A troll with DC, isn‚Äôt a 4K it‚Äôs a suspension (so he got mad at me because a survivor left the game) 
---
J: I sent your troll vid to them Gg
---
M:How was I trolling?? Your so bad it‚Äôs funny. 
---
J: by being a POS
---
M: (that one PSN sticker of Kratos laughing with tears coming down his face)
---
In conclusion, hoes mad.
---
Am I missing something ? This is fine
---
I was hooked...
---
Hope is much better than people think, but it's outshined by Adrenaline. 
---
You shouldn't get a haste effect this easily. getting used to survivor's running speed is a CRUCIAL skill to learn as the killer and increasing it even slightly throws all that out of the window. 
---
also, look how hope is AT THE END OF THE GAME and lasts 2 minutes. your haste can be used multiple times during the match. 30 seconds is too much.
---
&gt;  Also repairing pallets could be helpful in lower ranks when baby survivirs throw down pallets 
---
and broken in higher ranks
---
Looks like someone doesn't have their priorities right
---
3% is massive vs a 110 killer. It will be literally impossible to catch up for 30 seconds with collider differences. Not to mention not triggering exhaustion.
---
i mean, its frustrating watching someone get camped and there is nothing I can do. I'm a team player, and it feels like we let that guy down and won't even try to save him in favour of gens or escaping. Especially when the hooked person was on their first hook and didn't do anything wrong to tilt the killer. Survivors job is to do gens and help each other. One person literally can't do anything, the other people have to give up a part of their objective because a killer is being a dick.
---
You get better chances of higher rarity items/offerings and bloody clothing.
---
It‚Äôs an accomplishment for me tbh. A full set of bloody clothing looks pretty nice and it‚Äôs a cool flex to switch to multiple P3‚Äôd characters in the character lobby age it shows that you‚Äôre exoirenced
---
Prestiging a character slightly increases the quality chance of items showing in blood web
---
Anything licensed usually holds pay2win perks, Ash and his Mom is the most recent example but Laurie with DS was the same shit. Anyone who denies its pay2win or actually likes pay2win games is weird to me.
---
Hybrid Panda says he has been passed a potential leak about the next killer being called 'the phoenix' with his power being able to emmit smoke and ignite it. 
---
We shall see however.
---
Legion with Furtive Chase + Tinkerer = Mass bleedoits
---
just played my first game. sadly it wasn‚Äôt 4K i did get one though lol i listened to you and got two of them to dead hook and one died thanks bro!
---
I tried that but my classmates urban evasioned in the corner of the classroom instead of escaping smh
---
Sitting in comic Con dressed as Ghostface, you made me really intimidated.
---
Wow first /r/deadbydaylight killer that didn't actually camp, use mori or tunnel. Took us 3 years but we finally have a killer who isn't scumbag. Look at Otzdarva's stream and all day all night he will get positive comments in post-game chat because he doesn't play like an angry tryhard.
---
i have tinkerer but not furtive ;( totally getting that next tho lol thanks man!
---
He ahas three states of movements. When he first appears he walks, but after time he begins moving rather quickly. Then, every time he‚Äôs killed, he gets a boost of speed for a few seconds, which inspired his ability.
---
Doctor and distressing
---
That's pretty fine actually.
---
I thought they fixed this?
---
Enlighten me please
---
use their salt to become stronger
---
Oh nice! I actually didn't know that! Thank you for the clarification. No wonder I died to him so much lol
---
That's actually dope

oh trust me i am &gt;:)

Omfg look at spirit in that image üòÇüòÇ

Oh that was a bug? I thought It was meant to be like that.

Don't prestige unless you want the cosmetic that comes with it  easy as that

That's pretty awesome!
---
 *Devs are interested to keep the game frustrating for killers. That's their way of getting the 1/4 playerbase this game needs. If the killer side becomes funnier than the survivors side, there would be a* ***catastrophic problem****.*
---
I don‚Äôt play killer much so I don‚Äôt really worry about that stuff. And usually I only listen to music when I‚Äôm playing alone.
---
 **Nightmare on Elm street Perk rework** 
---
\*slightly increases numbers\*
---
that's not how you "rework" something
---
Yeah plus you need to get a good mask which is super hard to find, you can really only find mass produced ones that are 30 bucks and look like garbage
---
I 100% agree with you on that.  Both sides are more interested in politicking than protecting the people.  However, your original question was ‚Äúhow are the feds breaking the law‚Äù.
---
Jesus could you at least give your bullshit-scenario 4 instaheals? Wtf is DH and DS gonna do?
---
Pretty much every M1 proxy camps hooks
---
Spirit is pretty easy. Just rub a balloon on your head, get naked, and cut off your limbs.
---
I hope you had a flashlight, or at least crouched over it.
---
I normally only use headphones. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever tried to play without them.
---
Yikes indeed. They can downvote all they want but if they don't challenge what we're saying it just shows their stubborness and inability to hear things that they don't like. It's really sad, considering if they listened they'd be better players.

For Myers you need to be really hot so I guess that‚Äôs the difference

You ever tried to find a true Mikey mask? Shit is WILDY hard to find, and if you do, be prepared for about a 250 dollar fee.
---
Cursed
---
Might be Tinkerer
---
Just left, be there tommorow. Dublin comic con, (Ireland, btw)
---
Killer didn‚Äôt have tinkerer at the end when it just happened.
---
This game could really use a native English speaker working on their translations.
---
The game's descriptions of killers are full of misspellings and downright wrong uses of words, they either did a google translation or have someone who took two years of English in h.s. doing their translations. 
---
It just comes off lazy. I was shocked when I learned the devs are Canadian, but less shocked when I learned they're Qu√©b√©cois.
---
PS It looks like the people at Microsoft could use a lesson in French. Quebecois is not flagged (it's wrong) and yet Qu√©b√©cois gets flagged as a spelling mistake. Come on, y'all. Spelling is not hard.
---
The reason I‚Äôm complaining is because these guys did nothing all game I was the one distracting the killer while they hide in lockers and I was the one doings gens
---
Just think, a tombstone myers popping tier 3 as soon as all 5 gens are done, he has remember me up, and you hear this music and know you're screwed
---
Does John Carpenter know this game exists? Does he know about this?
---
Depends on your rank. Only red ranks 100% need to kill all 4. But killing all 4 really helps achieve double pip.
---
Killer is about to mori Kate and she does a wig reveal
---
Yeah, wasting pallets and not knowing loops makes the game frustrating and not fun. Just a shame some people are too close minded to even listen to other people who know what they're doing.
---
Matchmaking seems to fine tbh
---
Maybe they do understand and its you are the one who doesnt undestand that its time to stopgen rushing... Killers want to have fun to...
---
You may be very nice in end game chat, but that doesn't mean everyone else will.
---
Relax man, it was just a meme. It feels like you're projecting a little bit here given how super defensive you're being.
---
That's perfectly fine, wish I had this all the time. You just had bad teammates
---
Thanks! Glad you like it. :)

---
They've gone full critical and have reversed polarity! They're completely sweet now!! :O
---
???
---
üòâ
---
Lol game must've still registered you as in after the collapse
---
Ok so one not being able to grab someone while they unhook would be absolutely terrible in swf, gaining a speed boost every single time a generator is done for permanently and not a specific time would make you faster than the killer after 3 gens and being able to stun a killer for trying to prevent an unhook is just straight unfair. You could literally pair what you picked with DS and/or MoM and you wouldn‚Äôt be able to kill swf ever
---
Oh my god you‚Äôre right
---
You were blessed with a bug and running through the exit gates did nothing so your only option was to die to EGC.
---
There was a couple things going around a while ago about netflix working with behaviour. It may have been debunked in that time, but couldn't find anything to suggest otherwise. It was fun to write nonetheless and I'm happy with how it came out :)
---
You got a new follower out of me tho Cuz I like good killer plays, but I don't like playing killer.
---
Definitely not on the same level as post man.  At the very least give them 3 needles and a key or something.
---
Legion's mask needs to be made in an art class. Myers' mask can just be bought.
---
Maybe i should, but its to funny to see them cry ^^
---
Thank you :)
---
It also means survivors can just rush hooks with no repercussions for the one rushing hook.
---
Thanks. Glad you like it!
---
Yeah but the killer usually brings Mori. A shame it's not as rare as in game
---
Thanks so much.. Well im a killer main that is also TRYING to do some surviving sometimes and its hard playing with randoms as a noob lol.. Thanks again for the follow..
---
this is the eleventh time this meme has been posted in the last month
---
Look at OP defending his absolutely broken perk ideas. Literally a survivor main would say these are broken. Want to achieve true balance? Only listen to people who play both sides.
---
What perks were you running?
---
Is there a sub rule against reüÖ±Ô∏èosts?
---
What I'm saying is, what would you call Pennywise? I don't think they'll break the pattern and just call him "IT."
---
If anyone still casts salt at players for using Legion they are babysurvivor cartoons at this point.  Reworked Legion is completely balanced and fair now and not even remotely worth salt raging about.  Ignore them and play whoever you want.
---
Don't forget the talcum powder
---
Dude for real it's just the incels mad that some females play this game and get attention because they dressed like one of the characters lol
---
So after 3 gens you could literally walk as fast as you run then after that you would walk faster than you run? That makes no sense
---
This is genuinely incredible.
---
I'll just be a George Costanza Myers.
---
Poor doc hurt his back
---
New movie 2020 bubba and shirtless Myers adventure to save the world
---
Lmao what‚Äôs the matter? Couldn‚Äôt take the criticism?
---
This is legit scary üòÇ
---
If you really want it to change try suggesting what those changes should be. The devs, or anyone else for that matter, can't use "FIX HADDONFIELD" for anything.
---
Huntress‚Äô thighs + my weak skull
---
Then this image has done some good in this world c:
---
Meh thats the next step unless you get killer teachables. Just try to exhaust all the items on survivors before you prestige them and make sure you have a mil bp saved up to get them to around 35-40 right away
---
Lmfao 99% of ps4 survivors don‚Äôt even look behind them let alone actually loop pallets/windows correctly. Bubba at red ranks on pc would get shit on. All you need is 1 decently good looper and the other 3 to hit the gens and you‚Äôre fucked
---
The Lug ... nut.
---
Y'all just gonna ignore that the Jane also made a post?
---
I know they wanted a video
---
So I just saw a clip of this match from that David's pov and I'm really sorry this happened to you (it's happened to me too) but I thought that was super funny to see this from both sides.
---
Is this a Jane specific bug? Ive only seen this happen to Janes.

For like, what, a few seconds or however long her fatigue is?

Thanks :D But I think we both know that would never happen unless they get a chance to read it. Hopefully my forum post will get their attention!
---
I never throw down pallets against Legion if I'm healthy or Feral Frenzy is being used. It'll be a waste of the pallet as you'll get hit by them just vaulting it immediately. Also all Legions I played respect pallets hard with Frenzy. I've gotten one to respect a pallet 3 times in one Frenzy and they ended up losing their power without any hits. Then after that thet stopped respecting pallets lol.
---
He‚Äôs got an ability that removes his TR and lets him stalk, it can get removed by him hitting someone or being revealed by a survivor. Then, like spirit or legion, he needs to wait for his power bar to recharge before he can remove his TR again.
---
Really op. It doesn't allow survivors to do gens at all
---
bruh
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Make sure you blow through all your offerings and items when you get close to rank 50 to have bp to spend back when you prestige. Give you a chance to practice instaheals, flashlight saves or pallet stuns etc.
---
Ah, ok. 
---
I was afraid of that, but still it's good to know going forward.
---
Thanks :D
---
Ya you can just go to the store XD
---
Unless you‚Äôve been revealed or made an attack to break you out of the night shroud before the downing blow. (Hit or miss)
---
Maybe For Wake up it could be EGC gets exteneded?
---
Tunneling actively hurts your chances at winning too it's such a bad strategy but it works well against bad opponents.  For instance if a killer was to tunnel me they'd find themselves losing a lot of gens on their way to a satisfying 1K as long as my teamates aren't all potatoes.  I will waste so much time and make the act of tunneling me as fun as pulling teeth.  Tunneling is one of those things that sounds like a good idea but the reality of it is the other 3 survivors you ignore just plow through gens.  GG.
---
I only prestige if I have another survivor with the same bulid. For killer do it at rank reset
---
Distressing is actually really smart on GF, you get bonus BP and hardly get any drawbacks when you‚Äôre cloaked.
---
Nope I main M1 killers and don't camp shit.  Pretty much every bad killer proxy camps hooks.  Edited for accuracy.
---
I'm a rank 8 and played with a rank 1, a rank 3, a rank 10, and a rank 15 killer.
---
‚ÄúTryhard killer‚Äù lmao ok sorry for playing the game. Not sure what you mean by ‚Äútryhard‚Äù
---
Isn't small game supposed to do that first idea? I like that second one though
---
Thats why I said ALMOST, I'm sure theres still alot of killers who might still take that poorly. Just because 95% of the time only tbagging happens after a pallet or exit gates. So if you do an action that 95% of the time is to mock them of course we -may- think its still disrespectful.  Pointing would be alot better of an option
---
Of course theres execptions, but dont be suprised when a killers whos been dealing with toxic surviors gets salty and kills you anyway.
---
Toxic killers cause toxic survivors and toxic survivors cause toxic killers. Its a big ass loop that will mever end
---
How long do you think it should be before it is too op. Like 30 seconds?
---
I do believe they are a translation of Phantom of the Opera lyrics / story. Unfortunately, I haven't seen it, so I'm probably missing iconic lines / backstory, but:
---
I gave you a song
---
Every night, a song of repose
---
I don't need anything in return
---
Because you said, "I won't forget you, Andrew" (the name of the composer?)
---
Despite this
---
"I love you" (said by the woman, who is happier because of the Phantom)
---
Anyone else kept thinking about illidan?
---
And what you get from chests
---
How well can you play with your red stain on controller? Like moonwalking etc. I honestly don't know. It's most likely possible but I don't play with controller
---
So what happens?
---
Same as mouse, not that different.
---
Did you not see him?
---
Take it
---
Not only that, but acting as Michael Myers and getting into the role is a lot easier than Legion. Legion fidgets around with their blade, makes Legion grunts and noises, and is overall just an annoying teenager, while Michael Myers... You just stand there!
---
It's not camping when there is an open exit gate you're fine there.  NOED is totally a crutch though biggest crutch perk in the game.  Run it if you want but that comment was accurate.
---
Works both ways hun

It makes it bad if an item does its job better and can easily be brought in or even found. Medkits are the most common drop in chests. Heck, even Pharmacy would be better than Self-care
---
It‚Äôs kinda meh
---
How can you win against a killer like that ?
---
Lol! I know right? I laughed at that as well after I took it XD

Bond next

But from my experiences, the mask does cost some money. And who just has a Myers jumpsuit just lying around.
---
But I do know that pretty much everyone owns a hoodie and a piece of paper
---
Why wouldn't you?
---
Wake Up!, as terrible as it is, was supposed to be a built in counter to Remember Me. 
---
I get that everyone wants to say that it's only 3 seconds off of opening the door (The real benefit of the perk is showing people that the door is being opened, fwiw. Not saying that it's still a good perk though) always forget that it was closer to 9 seconds when Remember Me was fully charged pre-nerf, and that you didn't need someone to have Leader be standing next to you to do it.
---
This isn't to say the perk isn't bad, or that it doesn't need a rework, but Wake Up is one of those perks that is a bandaid to a bandaid and as long as Remember Me exists, it probably won't be changed.
---
Hey, not to be mean but why are you using noed on a killer that can easily one shot? I mean, any other perk would be better imo.
---
Anyway people in this game complain about everything. Nothing surprises me anymore.
---
What makes you think that? I just think it's because a lot of people post legion cosplays and they are all very similar
---
Why the fuck did I click this.

Oh thanks man another person agrees

I got to 9000 shards at level ~45!
---
not really, dbdgonegay is better for this. since those special snowflakes in dbdgonewild that cant STAND to look at gay stuff will downvote it.

I think it was in the early 40s if I remember right.

Lmfao im choking

On console, Spirit. 100%. Every time I see it I severely want to disconnect. But I'd rather not be reported so I play the match begrudgingly.
---
I know. Lol
---
People out here getting genuinely upset that Myers is just a pay to win cosplay. It‚Äôs a meme guys relax
---
"go to sleep ugly"
---
Wait, that‚Äôs illegal!
---
I have the dlc item to try Freddy on my brsnf new untouched freddy
---
Oh wow that was a lucky spawn XD lol!
---
You slightly get more shards per level over time. I‚Äôm 80‚Äôs and get 350(?) shards a level so do some easy multiplication :) / dividing by educated guess for estimate (level 45 divided by however many shards u get now as a rough guess... then knowing you eventually get more shards, assume you‚Äôll actually be a lower level). It all makes sense trust me
---
Wow that sounds like a great cosplay, but it's not feasible for everyone. As long as you're dressing up as the character you're cosplaying.
---
Small game lets you know in a 45 degree cone something is there (trap or totem). This would give traps auras within range but not trigger on totems.
---
You can't burn your chest when you're already smoking hot üëâüòéüëâ
---
So you don't even try to have fun with the surviors. Thats pretty shitty. Especially if they aren't even trying to play the game right
---
Ikr!
---
Evil never dies and that he is
---
I hate it more
---
when it works seamlessly
---
Dude I srsly think they need to give licensed killers skins.
---
For freddy use the classic ons or the Wes Cravens New Nightmare one.
---
Leatherface, you can give him his grandma  or one of his remake looks
---
You already said what Michael should get but maybe they can also give him his hobo outfit from hid Halloween II remake by Rob Zombie.
---
The way you describe it is as though they ignore other players. What I mean is if someone is unhooked, and you see both players, downing the person who was unhooked instead of the teammate who did the unhooking. Although usually I use that down to snowball and chase the other guy
---
Wait a minute.. Legion.. Ion..A mech from titanfall will be a new killer.
---
To clarify my friend (the feng min) told me she wanted to play DBD. She is very bad at the game and can‚Äôt loop at all, So when Ghostface showed up I was telling her to run in hopes she would lead him away from the gen and I could finish it.
---
Upvoted, best one yet.
---
My top most wanted one is Pretty Woman leatherface, I'm so set on it that I'm saving up auric cells for Pretty Woman leatherface, if he ever comes out I am destined to have it
---
Maybe add some pizza near the mouth and more blood on the mask and it'll look like you killed delivery Dwight ha-ha
---
Thanks buddy, can't wait to do nurse next
---
I'm getting some you are just kind of a little mean vibes
---
If not Tinkerer, Insidious will do it, so will Dark Devotion. Or you could be playing against a Pig or Ghostface.
---
If it's happening every game, then it's nothing to do with the killers or their perks unless you're playing against the same killers over and over.
---
welcome to BHVR match making
---
They‚Äôre cute!
---
It‚Äôs not any of these because it‚Äôs always while I‚Äôm mid chase or when I get hooked but the killer is moving so it‚Äôs not insidious but it‚Äôs not pigs crouch or gfs power. It just happened with a clown while he was chasing me.
---
Ha! Just wait till you have a kid!
---
Yeap, I know but I dont understunt the bugs un this game :v
---
I've resorted to turning off messages on my ps4. Just play the game how you want. Who cares what others say :)
---
Lol no worries üòä
---
You boil water and put in pasta tho...
---
9 rank difference is about the usual. When I was in 12 survivors were in 2 and 3.
---
Gg :)
---
I wanna be that guy
---
Xbox player? Add me lol
---
I think it was a tweet on netflix's twitter account
---
Whenever i play survivor i always get people within a 2 or 3 rank difference. Its weird to see such a big range on killer
---
Just spray paint a Captain Kirk mask white
---
^  can confirm. I main Wraith and I don't camp at all. In fact I go out of my way not to camp. The game's a tiny bit harder I must admit, sometimes I get survivors that just know where every pallet is and runs me around for ages and I have to leave them to patrol gens, and I still win about half the time. But the feel good factor is when I get wholesome post game chats. Nobody complains about me being a campy tunnelling scrub because I plainly don't do that. If you have to resort to that to win, I mean, it's not against the rules, but I'd still say killers that resort to camping or tunnelling, must be pretty bad at the game.
---
Food before anything in my world lol
---
No u
---
No it happened to me as Dwight lol it sucks!
---
Or when they pick you up when downed, drop you to pop the adrenaline and smack you back down. When it first happened I said the same thing xD. Smart play though.
---
Or he's just thinking how much force it'll take to push your monitor off the table onto the floor.
---
Just do it!!!
---
Unless we know the other perks/add ons (even though i don't think clown has any that remove heartbeat), we can't tell if it's intended or a bug.
---
Me too. The Xbox dead by daylight club, there are people posting clips of them using that bug.
---
Tbh its probably just a problem with me since I dont actually bm
---
I dunno man, seems kinda gay to me
---
Actually!  
---
Myers is a difficult cosplay because a quality mask needs to be custom made.  The mass produced versions don't look right and aren't up to the same quality.  Then you have to decide which Myers you're portraying since all the masks from film to film have differences.  Compare, say, H1 to H6.  
---
And a truly great Myers cosplay will incorporate proper scenery and shadows.
---
Ive dc‚Äôd twice in my 200 hours on dbd, 
---
Once against a freddy on lery‚Äôs who was lagging so bas i was getting hit before i even got put to sleep fully.
---
The other i got hooked in the basement and when i looked at my teammates auras they were t-bagging and point at me.
---
I just don‚Äôt find it worth my time to dc, i‚Äôd rather get the  bloodpoints.
---
I absolutely loathe playing against a spirit regardless of their addons and i still stick it out against one.
---
And if you didn‚Äôt  tunnel then you wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about decisive strike would ya?
---
Halloween (1978), H20, Resurrection(?), Remakes and (2018) - He isn't, he's just a psychopath.
---
Halloween 2, 4 and 6 (Theatrical) - He's pure evil, but can be potentially destroyed. 
---
Halloween 5 and 6 (Producer's Cut) - He's immortal until he kills all his bloodline or passes on the curse of Thorne.
---
I hear the killers heartbeat during a chase but i almost never hear their terror radius when they‚Äôre clearly walking around me when I‚Äôm on the hook and they don‚Äôt have tinkerer or any of the terror radius suppressing add ons
---
Nice thanks for this spot

Lord forgive me for what I must do
---
It‚Äôs because so many more people play killer, mainly because a decent game with BBQ gets you ~50,000 BPS while a perfect survivor game without WGLF will get you ~20,000. Plus WGLF stacks require you to actually be skilled enough to save people not spam.

Can I just ask, what do you do with all the time you save by skipping those four letters?
---
The only reason I picked him is I have so much trouble findin survivors. I am constantly losing them, and the doc is constantly causing them to reveal themselves. If there was another killer with that ability I would probably try them out as well
---
You're not that good dude
---
Just an automatic Mori. When you pick up a survivor to try and hook them you just squish them.

Good question

thats such a good feeling

This is 10x more true when someone finally cleanses against the plague and getting stunned completely wipes the power.

That has honestly mever happened to me but as a nurse main ive done that to so many people amd its just big brain plays : D. But that gen pop thing thi has happened to me so many times

Yeah neither do I, so its a little bit more frusterating when that day happens where everyone seems to be a dick. Thank god its not always consistent

Speak for yourself I wear exclusively boiler suits one for each day of the week

So you only got +1 and were just short of +2.  That isn't punishment.  It's like you were 2 points away on a test from an A and received a B+ instead.  Whammy.
---
Different colors?
---
Killer can do whatever he wants.
---
lmfao what the fuck is this shit. I like it
---
Im a survivor main, and I understand that the killers‚Äô objective is to win. Ofc u try to have fun playing but that doesn‚Äôt mean letting survivors win, or stay alive if there‚Äôs no reason to keep them alive. When I‚Äôm up against baby dwights ofc I‚Äôm going to go easy on them. &amp; occasionally when there‚Äôs no toxic people I‚Äôll be lighthearted. But when I play killer I play like any person with a brain would. Go after toxic survivors.
---
Huh
---
No actually on the back they have a different logo cause I work at a different place each day sometimes I gas light my coworkers when they see me I claim to not know them
---
I was thinking 20 but 30 works
---
that could be good, but it definitely shouldn't stack if other survs are running it
---
But totems reward you with sweet bp. So do them!
---
World of warcraft - legion
---
Tunnelers do ignore the other players that's the very definition of tunneling.  If you tunnel the unhooked survivor never mind you taking the path of least skill you're subjecting yourself to both Borrowed Time and Decisive.  If you were to tunnel me off hook for instance all I'm going to do is decisive you then go right back to wasting your time with the loops.  Tunneling hurts so bad against capable players.
---
That pec is a boob.
---
lmao
---
Exactly. I play nurse and i dont run noed for reasons and i run thanatophobia and i already knew all survs were gonna complete gens and i had them all injured but out of nowhere they are all healed as the gen is done and even my nurse self cant stop all of them at that point now.
---
‚ÄúEverything the knife touches, lets you see a weird red glowy thing in your terror radius.‚Äù -mufasa, probably.
---
Sort by new, another guy who was in your game posted a clip from his perspective
---
2M/S might indeed be too fast. Maybe 1M/S for better balance?
---
Tell me Me if it helped,it‚Äôs red ranks gameplay,but TrU3 provides solid knowledge with Spirit.
---
As for Looping,you have to be better at mind games(and have a good headset) It‚Äôs the Strength Of Spirit,to be able to mind game every pallet.
---
Also Spirit phasing when Walking(on the Survivor side)can help.
---
It‚Äôs such a well done Killer compared to My Legion(but I love it way too much to change)
---

Can we please fix the test subject saw weapon animation for Amanda on the main screen? It's just sawing straight through her middle knuckle and looks weird.

Hold on why did it only just spawn in then, the hatch spawns randomly at the start doesnt it?
---
Does Home Depot sell jumpsuits?
---
Nice job! :D
---
I only think if someone spawns in with a key
---
Insufficient funds or a limit on the card, usually.
---
Yeah, I thought about that pack. For now, though, I‚Äôll think about it.
---
No it's not the speed it just that the survivors can stop
---
I dont think so ive found it randomly when theres been 3 survivors left and i didnt have a key though
---
Nurse would just be a confused lady wondering why she is floating and screaming
---
My cosplay is not low effort, is minimal

I‚Äôm not sure then

Whoa

No not that one you bimbo the one that plays while in a chase

Get out of there Spongebob!!!

Like, exactly zero.

Probably not what's said in the title, but they've already got your view
---
Smh, not even being committed enough to sow your boiler suit onto your person

I wear one under my regular boiler suits so I‚Äôm always wearing one it‚Äôs been so many years I‚Äôm scared to look at the horror I might see I saw alittle bit once it looked back

---
Lol, 360's are easier to do on controller than K&amp;B and it's a much more common tactic on console so nothing would really change for console killers except less people doing 360's.
---
Yes but Michael is hot
---
You lost me at
---
&gt;as long as my teammates aren't all potatoes
---
I hope that this leak is true because a power like that sounds super fun.
---
Would rather see the slowdown when hag teleports get removed and allow her to keep her momentum.
---
Unless idk, you see scratch marks by the hooked guy implying someone is waiting for you to leave and many perks in the game work when 2 survivors are near by. Or if your a trap character then you still have to set up some traps near the guy. But besides that, yeah you should leave.
---
Instead of having to wait much longer for all rank 20-17 players, you got to play a game sooner. The way to get better is to play people that are better than you.  Yeah it might suck to lose, but as you play you will get a mix of experienced players and newer players anyway. Just take a loss and play again,  try to learn what worked and what didn't work.
---
They patch one glitch, 2 more pop up in its place
---
This is the greatest thing I‚Äôve ever seen from this sub.

I refuse to believe such a thing exists, I guess Rule 34 is the universal law.
---
Now, is there a page like this without the gay? I need it for... scientific purposes.
---
I think this counts as a map exploit, and if given proper video evidence BHVR could get you in trouble for doing it.
---
Also some datamined sounds from pre-ghostface sounding vaguely like stuff used in ST3's soundtrack

No, Splinters arent supposed to even appear anymore.

H... how would you not
---
No us
---
That's not the thing, you need to think of a way that the survivor can stop the zombies, if it chases them all game they'll just have no way of doing anything, no matter how slow the zombies are. Maybe what you can do is that the zombies stop chasing once they lose the sigh of the survivor.
---
Like they are 1m/s until they find someone than they are 4.4 m/s until you break line of sight. But it's the zombie lord that tells them where to check for survs
---
So do I. I've been getting higher rankings lately but especially with killer, the higher the rank the less fun killers you can play. It fucking sucks. If there is lag or it puts you in a sour mood then okay but like people dc for everything now and it's the pussiest thing in the world.

Two thirds there! Now how do I get undressed without arms...

Dude, absolutely amazing!

---
That only happens if you buy him (and other splinter killers for that matter) with auric cells.
---
If you contact support and ask for a refund, and mention you're buying the full chapter after, they should do it. That's what I did, I'm on PC though.
---
When aggressive sustained counter fire isn't enough.
---
Your killer rank is shared, it would happen no matter what killer you played.  Just keep learning killer basics, patrol gens, tracking survivors, following scratch marks, get better at ending chases,  using killer powers, and trying out perks.  You will get better. It just takes time.
---
That would be r/dbdgonewild

Netflix made a tweet saying they were working with 4 gaming companies, and BHVR was one of them. The other 3 all made or put Stranger Things content in their games. Mcote replied to the tweet too, implying that it's DBD related. 
---
There's two other leaks that also point towards a ST chapter coming up, so I'm surprised they haven't announced it yet.
---
Maybe the killer shouldn't come back if the killer has failed to kill anyone by the time 5 gens have been done. Sounds like to me that survivors did their objective and killer failed theirs. And in the context of this meme, the killer has failed to realise that the gen next to them is being worked on, and failed to apply pressure to it.
---
DS is only obnoxious if the killer tunnels. It's fine.
---
im using the cells though
---
So DH buys you, maybe 6 seconds because nurse instadowns you.
---
&gt; Decisive Strike has been a meta king perk for some time now, and creates an especially uninteractive burden on the killer. Unlike other potent, but less obnoxious perks, Decisive doesn't demand the killer adapt and overcome their game plan to surpass some mechanic, instead Decisive sits on a gameplay chokepoint that makes it unavoidable.
---
I don't tunnel so survivors can never D strike me. Simple.
---
Your suggestion seems to no longer make it a tunnel counter unless i understood it wrong.
---
So, a typical Tuesday?
---
Claudette- Dwight, are you sure that was the right mushroom?
---
Dwight- (Flipping through Claudette‚Äôs notes) Y-yeah?  Brown stripe with orange and white cap, right?
---
Claudette- ...brown STIPE with orange and white cap.
---
Dwight- Oh... thought that was a typo... you, uh, you alright?
---
Claudette-  That depends.  Are bees crawling out of my fingernails?
---
So lets break this down:
---
He starts with four zombie helpers right next to him that move the shortest possible path between them and the Survivors. This means that the moment the game starts, he knows exactly where the Survivors are, what Gen they're close to, and who is near who; if one zombie careens off by themselves, congrats you know who is alone and won't be bailed out by their buddies. This is already broken by itself due to the amount of information it gives you at the beginning.
---
Secondly, because each Zombie is always pointed towards it's personal survivor and the Zombie Lord can see his zombie's auras, ZL always knows where every Survivor is throughout the entire map. Again, the amount of info this gives you is busted beyond belief since it removes all forms of Stealth and counterplay from the equation.
---
Thirdly, because each Survivor is constantly being chased by a Zombie, each Survivor is not allowed to do anything productive all game. You can't sit on a Generator because you've got a Zombie coming after you, and even if the Zombies move slow enough that you can sit on a gen for 80 seconds and not do anything, the Zombie Lord has an "arrow" pointing directly at the Survivor for that entire duration, so he's making a beeline straight towards it now.
---
Lastly, the power absolutely messes up Looping, since the Zombie Lord can corner the Survivor between himself on one side of a pallet/window, and the zombie is on the other side; Survivor either has to get hit by the zombie, hit by the Zombie Lord, or maybe even get hit by both.
---
Now, the idea does have potential. Summoning minions could work if they were sufficiently weak enough and could be dealt with somehow. But as written this is blatantly broken.
---
And Myers is a classic character.
---
PC  
---
Injured sprint burst  
---
I played just know on swap against a Freddy when i threw down the fake pallet he hit me and i kept the speed boost for the whole game i could out run him easily.  
---
I was playing Bill with borrowed time, spinechill, kindred and unbreakable so it wasnt a perk bug either
---
His idea also is just a buffed flip flop
---
I like that slight smile of sheer confidence on Myers' face. He knows that he doesn't need to be anybody else but himself. I love me a confident killer.
---
Now, I believe such a thing exists, thank you random kind stranger. May the toxicity be with you.
---
Shhhhh that never happened
---
I mean, you‚Äôre not wrong, killers will call you toxic for blinding or looping. But this shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise for anyone, of course there‚Äôs entitled people on both sides
---
Never expected Myers to be a good father
---
Need to edit the music to swell right as she disppears.
---
There isn't much that can be done to fix it of you end a chase in 5 seconds because chainsaw
---
Listen
---
&gt; This means that the moment the game starts, he knows exactly where the Survivors are
---
I mean maybe it helps him know the direction they are, but not exactly where they are.
---
&gt; Secondly, because each Zombie is always pointed towards it's personal survivor and the Zombie Lord can see his zombie's auras, ZL always knows where every Survivor is throughout the entire map. 
---
Again, the direction, not where they are exactly, but i actually think it was probably a poor idea to see the auras, i would agree it should be removed.
---
&gt; Thirdly, because each Survivor is constantly being chased by a Zombie, each Survivor is not allowed to do anything productive all game. You can't sit on a Generator because you've got a Zombie coming after you, and even if the Zombies move slow enough that you can sit on a gen for 80 seconds and not do anything, the Zombie Lord has an "arrow" pointing directly at the Survivor for that entire duration, so he's making a beeline straight towards it now.
---
You are right and this why i think 2M/S was too fast. At 1M/s, it would probably be more fair. Once found by a zombie, you have plenty of time to go to a different gens and the zombie won't be there for a while.
---
&gt; Now, the idea does have potential. Summoning minions could work if they were sufficiently weak enough and could be dealt with somehow. But as written this is blatantly broken.
---
I think the problem is the original speed i choose of 2M/s. With 1M/s i think it would be slow enough.
---
Also maybe the speed of the lord himself could be slower too to balance it out. 4.2M/s maybe.
---
Every Bloodweb I get a leather face splinter, or Ebony.
---
It depends on the amount of gens that are done. If gens done &gt; survivors alive then it spawns
---
I really love how you also captured the essence of Mt. Ormond with the background. A lot of Legion cosplayers don't even try to.
---
Go away Navi
---
No it spawns if the the number of survivors + 1 generators have been completed eg. 3 survivors = 4 gens needed. If there‚Äôs one guy left no matter how many gens the hatch spawns.
---
This community is so fucking backwards. I remember saying how lazy of a "cosplay" legion is when people first started doing it after he came to the game because it literally takes no fucking effort. Billions of downvotes. Now people are ripping on these lazy ass "cosplays" and getting billions of upvotes.

Y'all are either fucked in the head or finally realizing just how stupid and lazy legion cosplay is.

* Have DS Work BOTH on first and second hook. So potential to use twice it against a big tunneler.
---
* Have DS go off once the Killer hooks a different survivor.
---
Thanks I spent a lot of time on the background. Notice how you cannot see auras
---
Trick or Trick tots website has a good one
---
u can used this clip for edited XD
---
Bigger the abs the larger the terror radius irl
---
Gg :3
---
Wait til the movie
---
And a sprint burst!
---
This ^
---
They should be cooking BBQ &amp; Chili
---
I like it
---
You gotta be tall. A small Michael Myers will look stupid.
---
Yeah... I think maybe he really needs a hard snowball without ruin or you lose.
---
I hate those things, I have so many but I also have all the killers, something should be done where of we have that killer we can just get bloodpoints or they don't show up in the bloodweb or something
---
Pretty gross haha
---
Maybe... but I have on bbq and got cannibal so who breaks first ha
---
Because the vast majority of people on this sub don't care about anything but roleplaying as noob3 when they play this game. Just baby survivor mains wasting bloodpoints and complaining that killers exist at all.
---
The problem is both ways the devs already said their not doing anything about camping. It's already in the game and it's already punished by 
---
A. The blood Point penalty
---
B.most likely getting an entity Displeased for not applying gen pressure and actively getting into chases and doing tons of actions like destroying pallets
---
C.depipping
---
At a survivor stand Point people see it as so powerful because they keep going for saves and basically letting themselves get downed. When they can already punish the camper by just doing Gens. If the killer is just going to stand at the hook . While gens are being done then they seriously waited 10 minutes in the killer queue to let 3 survivors escape over 1 kill. Just gen rush them they"ll get the hint sooner or later and leave the hook.
---
Camping is controversial yes. But the devs have stated it as a strategy meaning there's no point to continue arguing about it and suggesting counters. The devs aren't doing anything about it since they don't see it as game breaking. I think we should all stop arguing about it on both sides.
---
I think she would be walking perhaps?
---
Only Splinters from not licensed killers and if you already have this killer don't appear anymore but the ones for licensed killers should still appear.
---
but why i don't get more point for short chase as it in the description ?!
---
Tunneling is braindead too in red ranks. You have to juggle survivors and get them all death hook. It pressures them off gens way more than just fucking up one person. ESPECIALLY since everyone and their mother runs DS
---
Pretty gay is better than ugly gay.
---
and there is what to do a lot of solutions!!1
---
sounds like something an incel would say...
---
Thanks!
---
Lf is my favorite killer, and me and my friends abuse survivors with him.
---
L
---
https://youtu.be/-gSGzkvMkLU . The game looks pretty good to me aside from the horrible skills this player has.
---
Thank you so much! :D
---
Same thing happened to me yesterday. The last survivor called me garbage and trash.
---
One survivor was dead and two were knocked on the ground. The 4th survivor( who was doing the last gen) triggered my hag trap so I able to find, hook, and kill him.
---
He said I only won because he set off my hag trap. Funny thing I was only using the hags blindness perk, not devour hope, or ruin. Also, I didn't use  add ons or offerings.
---
Good killers don't call you toxic for looping or flashlights (I don't). But in my experience, it's more rare to have non-toxic survivors. If you obliterate them, they find something to complain about (camp, tunnel, patrol, perk or addon choices). If they obliterate you, you're bad, "baby" killer, boosted. If you get anything other than 4KS, those who survive have a 50/50 chance of talking trash like above in post game. Honestly, Behavior has created this environment with their design choices. It's not a great state of the game.
---
https://youtu.be/-gSGzkvMkLU . It looks pretty good graphically speaking.
---
And how can the killer do that? Unless they are new, survivors practically have to LET the killer grab them.
---
This would solve my biggest problem with the perk right now. Sometimes as killer you can be demolishing the survivors and getting two hooks a minute. Sucks when you've hooked someone else before going back for another survivor only to get hit by DS out of nowhere.
---
I can help you!
---
That‚Äôs how I play Myers lmao, stalking... stalking... I give up
---
Been there before but with reheating chalupas
---
Yup. I really wish they‚Äôd do something so ruin isn‚Äôt required on every character except billy, spirit, and nurse.
---
I don't think changing this is necessary. If she kept her momentum, it would create many more pallet trading situations out of teleport. She doesn't need this as her pallet mindgame with the trap is already extremely strong.
---
Straight people (90% of the world) don't want to look at gay shit. Go figure.
---
I play both sides and have over 3k hours in the game. 
---
By far and large the most toxic ones are the survivors and it's not even close. I get messages from the killer in maybe 1 out of 30 games. I get salt from survivors about every other game.

---
Is this good?
---
I got yelled at cuz I didn‚Äôt use an offering to increase blood points lol
---
Yeah bc we need more useless slug perks atm lol DS isnt even good anymore, if you are struggling against it I suggest stop tunneling and git gud
---
Punctuation would be nice.
---
I disagree.
---
Tiny Michael Myers sounds terrifying.
---
Yeah, u don‚Äôt need to be a tunneler to be ‚ÄúDSed‚Äù u can pretty easy hook 1-2 survivors in the time that DS still activate, I don‚Äôt think having 2 DS for player every game is a good idea btw, I see it from both sides.
---
So I‚Äôve only tried playing as the Nurse a couple of times... are you saying you can control how far she teleports by pointing your cursor at the ground? I thought how far you teleported was only based on how long you held the ability button haha. I had a TERRIBLE time trying to hit survivors
---
You can literally buy a Ghostface costume at the store though.
---
Yeah but most of them down vote it to hell instead of fucking ignoring it. Its not like dbdgonewild is only for straight stuff.
---
Legion is one that I have been wanting to try. Just such an interesting character to me and I wish they got more love!
---
Seems like at the moment pop is really the only alternative. Or patrolling nearby a hook but then of course it‚Äôs considered camping.
---
I wasn‚Äôt sure but yeah.
---
Ya know, since we are upvoting nsfw posts now. I saw the post of Myers and leatherface get upvoted so let's see if this one does too.
---
Asking due to you flair.
---
Any tips for spirit? I have the most trouble finding people while in Yamoaka Huanting.
---
i give this post 10 minutes
---
Nope, I‚Äôve hooked DS users, had them fuck off, so I fuck off and lay down some pressure on gens and down and hook someone else for them to fuck back over and body block my hook, go down and after I hook the person I pick them up and get shanked because I must be tunneling, BT is a good anti tunneling perk, DS is an obnoxious anti tunneling perk that is too good, granted it‚Äôs better than it was it still needs tweaks and you‚Äôre blinded if you don‚Äôt agree, or you don‚Äôt play much killer
---
Ghost face
---
Lol very fair.
---
Yet the Myers and leatherface one stays up. For some reason there is a gay bias on Reddit.
---
Jason Todd.
---
downvote me, i don't care, it's rule 8 at this point
---
Uhh im think im on wrong sub......
---
It‚Äôs better than a tunnel counter, it doesn‚Äôt matter if you get tunneled, because usually good DS players will let you get them to let a teammate escape you, meaning you tunnel the kid you were chasing or hit the stupid DS user and give em what they want, and yeah you can slug them but then you‚Äôre a toxic slugger and a tunneler
---
Try to get a 4k at red ranks against optimal swf with any killer except the holy trinity by doing random hooks without getting genrushed you pretentious pleb. I can assure you that with any low pressure killer you don't have the physical time to patrol gens around the map AND at the same time do mixed hooks without securing a kill in the first 2-3 gens; i am devotion 5 and still against coordinated survs you literally trade a hook for a gen even if my chases are almost always short timed, there is no way to counter that shit.
---
It's always meant to have been ambiguous. Is he pure evil on two legs, as Loomis claims? Is he psychotic, and just has an unnaturally high pain tolerance?
---
Michael never "dies" in any of the films except for the sequel to the remake, so it's unknown if he is immortal, or just a tough bastard.
---
There's a reason no gay stuff is posted on most porn subreddits. It's assumed because most people are straight.
---
Just seems like i can never get away from her.
---
Can't loop her,and she moves so fast in phase that you can't run from her.Seems the only escape is if you get lucky and she phases the wrong way.
---
When a spirit spots me i might as well just go ahead and lay down on the ground.
---
Thank you! that's one of my favorite parts of it, I'm really happy with how it came out
---
Yes I also agree that keys are a really really stupid item. The hatch only spawns after certain conditions though, still not balanced but its there.
---
Ahaha I wish
---
I still get splinters and I own every killer
---
I suppose you've never been grabbed by the Spirit, or Myers, or Ghostface, or Wraith using the Clapper.  All of those killers can, and do, abruptly sneak up on survivors without much warning.  Hell I've seen videos on this subreddit of people turning their camera around whilst repairing, and seeing a Ghostface or a Myers right on top of them.  Or how about the clips of the Spirit with beads suddenly pulling people off of gens?  That's not to mention grabbing them out of a locker, or off of a pallet as they vault over (which every single killer can do, and many survivors seem to enjoy staying at a pallet for too long playing the vaulting game)
---
The point of my response wasn't to say that it is uber easy for every killer to grab a survivor, however, it is possible.  Just like it isn't easy to find every totem and cleanse it JUST IN CASE NoED is in the trial and still have time to get the gens done and escape.  I see NoED in roughly 75% of my trials, and only a couple times has it never been activated due to the totems all being cleared before the end game.  It doesn't happen often.
---
The point here is Killers always use the very dull excuse of "do totems" to counter NoED, or "don't get hit", yet when countered with advice to "just grab survivors" to defeat the rare heals they are flabbergasted as if that isn't a viable option.  It's hypocrisy.
---
Instead of nerfing already good perks, why don't we buff the other 70% that are borderline useless?
---
for me it's daytime dependent. From morning til early afternoon I have instant survivor lobbies and killer lobbies take about 5min. From evening til latenight it's the complete opposite. I'm in Germany on ps4.
---
I‚Äôve got a bone splinter on my bubba
---
Yeah perma tier 3 is what ever. It does take a long time to get but is So strong once you get it.
---
They turned it inside out in the original film, I believe.
---
Get a killer
---
I mean I get it, legion is annoying, granted he‚Äôs terrible but wow is he infinitely unfun to play against (I don‚Äôt DC pretty much ever but I get the urge)

Easy reply. "Sucks 2 suck." Lol

What happened where'd they go?
---
Haha, this game has absolute Perfection
---
Bubba + Noed
---
Hopefully the mods don't delete this one since they allowed the Myers and bubba one to stay up.
---
Yeah, the only thing about pop though is that you can still only really get a ton of use out of it on (once again) Nurse, spirit, and billy (also fredster). It‚Äôs not really a very viable alternative on killers like ghostface.
---
Gens popping too quickly is a core issue of the game that they‚Äôd rather keep adding perks to semi bandaid than fix.
---
Mobility is the absolute strongest aspect of a killer. I really really wish they‚Äôd experiment with giving the more M1ish killers faster base movement speed so they can stop loops easier. Which is another core issue of the game, looping isn‚Äôt fun for either side and is honestly just an exploit of the gameplay, it‚Äôs really sad that it‚Äôs considered what you‚Äôre supposed to learn as a survivor and how the game is played.
---
Holy shit, amazing art
---
This isn‚Äôt even a laggy situation, this is a desync, on the huntress‚Äôs screen you must have collided with the wall. Dedicated servers wont necessarily solve this problem.
---
Games are won or lost in that amount of time constantly, DS can throw that swing with bait plays and like I know how to play around them but now I‚Äôm a toxic slugger eggsdee so like no mater what survs (I know this because I‚Äôm bitchy when I play surv too) are gonna complain about my play so why not nerf DS so it serves its purpose better rather than broader
---
Thank you!!
---
take this dreck to r/dbdgonewild
---
Don't see the issue wih noed just destroy all the totems which you should be doing anyway plus it's a good back up in case you can't stop them from doing gens which is likely to happen aganst swf groups
---
The game tries to kick some sense into you, so you wouldn't buy GF. Cuz' he sucks for the time of being.
---
I did too! Now I feel like every game is a challenge now that I‚Äôm being paired up with other purple ranks and some red ranks. I like it and hopefully it teaches me to get better to continue to climb the ranks.
---
What an idiot just escape
---
Yeah I like it too. It‚Äôs getting tough tho aha
---
Rule 8
---
Did you gett if from the bloodweb?
---
Noice

Reanimated corpse of the murdered janitor

No mither and self care you mean
---
solidarity and self care with no mither has the same amount of uselessness
---
Nah, the Myers and bubba one is on the front page.
---
Kate cuz she's pretty
---
What do you mean useless it‚Äôs obviously the best build
---
NTA is generally acceptable to camp when an exit gate is powered and imo a fun part of the game for survivors since you really have to think and plan how you can save or if you can save. What did they expect you to do? Go across the map and let everyone out? Lol
---
I feel that. I did a legion cosplay for a con this year with my girlfriend, we hand-sewn parts of hoodies, dyed wigs, and I spent 2 weeks making masks out of clay for it. It was really a labor of love for my first costume and it feels shitty to think a lot of people dont think cosplayers arent putting in effort
---
Yeah i felt a little bad at the end..

Nah man fuck em, they‚Äôre lames for DCing, props to that one trooper, both of you should be rewarded rather than punished by the game for that waste of time
---
The Slippery Meat change basically dances on Clown‚Äôs grave. Granted it‚Äôs pretty much as situational as it was, but Clown alone is pretty weak and this does not help. The way I see it, Freddy‚Äôs snares basically outclass Clown‚Äôs Afterpiece Tonic. Clown‚Äôs tonic last too short and the slow down does not compete with Freddy‚Äôs. The only thing that Clown has is that his tonic is not a trap, but that doesn‚Äôt matter most of the time since proper snare placement works better than Clown‚Äôs.
---
True thats true..
---
No you undress BEFORE you cut your arms off. Rookie mistake. Did that my first four times
---
You'd think, but because it's so simple, people shit on it a lot. Too short? Not skinny-muscular enough? Don't have everything looking perfect? People will shit on it.
---
Lmao! Myers was shirtless with bubba groping him! You are only supporting it because it was gay. There are no nipples or vagina in this pic.
---
The next shrine is gonna be even worse, just watch
---
DS and dead hard are fine, the reason they are used so much is most survivor perks do absolutley nothing
---
oh god o h fuck NO PLE*ASE*
---
You can point at the ground so that you teleport barely distance at all, this is good for faking a teleport if you think survivors are going to turn and run at you or if you think they might vault back over a pallet
---
What is good about him?
---
Idk I like wraith and don‚Äôt think anyone else I would like
---
No...this...is requiem...
---
So a L4D hunter with a legion mask.
---
lol, i dont camp because thats just plain fucking stupid, and i literslly avoid fresh unhooks to avoid tunnelling, i will look straight at them and walk away because im not a cunt and yet survivors still try to be toxic... no more needs to be said, killer mains &gt;
---
It's end of the season. There aren't so many low rank survivors available so the game puts you against what is available.
---
How small we talking? Like 2 foot?
---
This is worse
---
"You paid for the movie ticket anybody who doesn't like that you and your friends are very loudly talking about Becky' s new boyfriend anybody else who is trying to enjoy the movie  can shove it roflcopter stupid people
---
Same, we spawned on The Game. I spent a minute searching for survivors, the moment i walk around the corner and make eye contact with survivors on a gen and start running at them they begin to dc.
---
He is unkillable.
---
amazing and sadüòî
---
i don‚Äôt think 20$ will be enough for all killers
---
Yeah I wouldn't bring a shroud ever either (unless I was just memeing or something) but I imagine it's pretty funny when DC-prone survivors see the hidden offering, assume it's a mori ("Who the fuck would use a shroud? It's definitely a mori") and DC in the load screen because of it
---
Get a cosmetic for him if you like him that munch
---
Thing is, it‚Äòs not forbidden. Camping usually doesn‚Äòt pay off, but can be a viable strategy against survivors that are too altruistic. I play and have fun, I doesn‚Äòt care if I win or lose anymore. But I try to keep it fair and square (as a killer at least). But again, playing unfair and being a dickhead is allowed, just not welcomed. So from a perspective of moral, yes you probably should draw a line at the you do you part, but at the same time, DbD is a game, so you can‚Äòt expect people to play in a way you consider fair and fun.
---
It's not broken that's just the normal game fam
---
That‚Äôs what I was thinking
---
With the requirement that the killer has to ignore you on the ground, or take his sweet ass time getting you to a hook. Its supposed to force the killer to accept what he gets on downing you, and you being on the ground is time the others can regain control.  
---
For example, lots of trappers will down someone and just leave them while they reset, and then hook them after its been an eternity. This is supposed to provide the same anti-tunnel perk, by making it so that when the Killer commits to a single person, they have to commit fully, and in that time, they can't reset their zone so effectively. Generally making camping and tunneling more expensive.
---
I play both survivor and Killer and this would help me in both case. As Killer i have same issue as you, and as survivor, a single DS is sometimes not enough to counter a big tunneler.
---
How?
---
Ah right. That‚Äôs good to know, cheers
---
Well I was just giving a rough estimate. But I also have discounts through the Xbox game pass
---
I believe you ignored the second part of my change.
---
I saw the bubba and Myers but it doesn't include pornography
---
Thanks for translation! In fact Andrew is the name of Nurse's husband, which makes the whole story more sadüò¢
---

---
Mentioned it to someone else, but the same applies here.
---
True. I‚Äôm worried about dedicated servers because if there‚Äôs not that many people in the que, you‚Äôll be loaded into empty servers like in battlefield 4. Idk if bhvr is gonna try and prevent this, but it‚Äôs a concern for me
---
I feel like this video with a small glimpse of whatever the killer for the chapter would be at the end would be a cool teaser thing
---
What does this have anything to do with legion or this meme?
---
How fast can you earn those shards tho? I only get like 160 or something a level. Like plague is 9000 shards and I only have 750 or something like that hahaha.
---
3 inches, give or take. Small enough to brandish a toothpick instead of a knife.
---
If you just started I think you should wait a bit, maybe buy Leatherface and The Hag because they are essential if you play killer, their perks I mean. But other than that, just wait, you'll see some killers are exceptionally bad and you might regret buying them with money.
---
Adam deliverance op
---
Haha. Thanks, I was starting to get really worried after seeing so many people getting banned over such simple things.
---
Oh i see thanks
---
The opposite might have been risky. If Bills tells you where Kate is, and then you let Kate escape, that could be seen as teaming.
---
Yeah the only survivor I‚Äôm interested in is ash because I‚Äôm a huge evil dead fan. But thank you for the info :D
---
Instead of one there‚Äôs hundreds of them. They swarm you and take you down.
---
As plague in corrupt purge, you respect the pallet like a fucking goddess you uncultured swine.
---
Probably because I believe Susie is considered underage if I remember the lore right.
---
Okay, thank you. Nice to know that i don't have to be stressed right now.
---
That‚Äôs true. Luckily I have most of the og killers already with special edition the only ones I don‚Äôt have are the movie killers and plague, legion, clown and spirit.
---
It's worse than the Bubba/Myers one but I think both should be removed.
---
Np &lt;&lt;3 good luck and have fun
---
As a pig main *oink* and also smashy smashy pallets mashy
---
This has a lot of good ideas for the overall health of the game. I don‚Äôt agree with all of them but I‚Äôd be more than willing to test them all out in a PTB. Great writeup!
---
Reminds me of the tea bagging morons. I slice them but I can‚Äôt finish them. I‚Äôm ranking up my pig at the moment. I just don‚Äôt get it.
---
So if he acctually reported me he would get banned?
---
Yeah, so?
---
I don't really enjoy reporting people but it's nice to know that I can if I have to. Thanks!
---
Bittersweet.
---
Unless they recorded you doing something obviously wrong and it was a re-occurrence like hacking or cheating
---
Tunneling is a good strategy if you the survivor you are tunneling gets caught in a few seconds. that way you get rid of one faster.
---
Camping is also a good strategy if the other survivors are potatoes and just stay around you watching or try to make a suicide save when there is a leatherface with his chainsaw ready.
---
why is legion hated so much?
---
I'm surprised every one of those didn't connect anyway.
---
Baby Dwight POV
---
Hag, Pig, Spirit... it works surprisingly well on Legion.
---
Who the fuck is the figure in the last pic
---
Doctor
---
*Jesus christ*
---
I was talking about Myers lmao
---
That sly motherfucker
---
If they add cross-play i‚Äôm definitely gonna buy the switch version.
---
Is it just me or does it feel like the hatch has a bias to spawn in places easier for the survivors to find it
---
For example right next to the last survivor or where the most recent survivor was sacrificed
---
Yeah, that happens to me quite often when playing in low ranks. Thanks for the reply.
---
Reports basically mean nothing so you are safe endless you hack
---
‚ÄúIt is my opinion that the developers would not put a shirtless cosmetic into the game, opting instead for the bandaged face or 2018 Michael cosmetics. If I‚Äôm wrong I‚Äôll delete the game off my ps4 that‚Äôs how sure I am‚Äù

Your issue is you‚Äôre lunging when you don‚Äôt need to, if you‚Äôre on her ass just tap RT quickest swing, best cone of connection for up close, and stay on her ass, eat pallets if you have to, break them if you can‚Äôt catch her at it

eventually there will be no more pallets
---
SWF is cancer. Babies who no can play on own can only with with they internet "friends" is bad, QoL updates for them is bad. Baby pussy sister fuckers. They deserving to never being play with "friends" and get shitting on each and every day.
---
Very nice!
---
Before he was nerfed, he had a strat that involved putting a Survivor in the mending phase, then moonwalking so that the bar would go down. If the "chase" lasted too long, you'd instantly go down. He also had an add-on combo that resulted in something called infinite mending Legion, which as the game went on, the mending time did too. It got so bad that running it was a bannable offense
---
Little too much overlap there, your auras on regressing generators is a much better idea since it's a unique effect and could honestly just be tacked on to current Wake Up to make Wake Up the ultimate "I know where to go to GTFO" perk
---
Technically you did hack so you could get banned but usually only repeat offenders will get banned. Plus all you did was remove the grind so some people may be upset but most won‚Äôt care as they‚Äôre too busy grinding themselves.

Friend got hit by a full MOM(pre nerf), DS, DH, BT squad with flashlights with one game offering, 2 Bloody Party streamers, and a murky regent. He didn‚Äôt have any coke to do after such a horrifying defeat that he did salt and died.
---
Tell me what you think after you finish if you feel like it
---
I mean; there are different variations but generally it involves you playing Leatherface with Insidious and just sitting In the basement all game.
---
You can either just lurk there the entire game and chainsaw any Survivors foolish enough to enter/mess with the basement chest, or you can bring Agitation + Iron Grasp, and try to drag Survivors to the basement to camp them.
---
Both are pretty boring for Survivors but you'll get less salt with the first one.
---
Provides comedy while occasionally making you poo your pants
---
Honestly trying to get that right now and it‚Äôs hard. I love the game but hate the grind.
---
‚Äúsummer fun mikey‚Äù
---
yes, you can, but the travel time is set for how long you held the blink (example, holding the blink for exactly 8 meters of travel will take you there almost instantly, when holding the blink fully and aiming at the 8 meters range will take you there in over a second)
---
That's rough that is rough indeed

Same with Huntress
---
You husband now
---
Ngl i would pay. Overcooked is awesome.
---
Is it weird that I got slightly aroused by this?
---
This is a great idea. 2 things though, rank 1 and 2 should be in the same bracket since a 1 depip puts you from 1 to 2. 4000 points is perfect since we get shards from player level as well, actually it might be to generous, I typically can save up enoufh shards currently to buy an unlicensed chapter every 3 months. With the added shards I would spend them purely on cosmetics because of this if we received too many each month eventually they'd become redundant and we'd end up with people purposely deranking again in no time
---
Insidious, Agitation, IG, and a 4th perk of choice, usually Mad Grit or Noed. 
---
Hook someone in basement (if they don't dc)
---
then hide somewhere to activate Insidious, try not to be seen while hiding.
---
Profit and enjoy the salt afterwards :)
---
Yeah other comments will just be saying the same. But you just keep an eye for them around basement, or try to corral them there and then focus on making the team play around there. Hooks, downs. Etc. Lots of people use insidious but I don‚Äôt think it makes for a fun game on either side.
---
I know in the (official) newsletter, BHVR are going to rework the bloodweb, so it‚Äôs less grindy, along with some patches, hopefully that fixes the character shard problem.
---
So if you close the hatch with the an active trap on someone, they can walk out??
---
Fixed
---
no i dont, i stopped playing for a bit before legions release and got back into it after ghost face
---
Yeah but... Isnt that the same about Legion?  
---
Each legion has small details in their outfit. Hell, Franks pants alone are more detailed than 80% of Michael.
---
Speedo Myers
---
Ricardo Myers
---
It‚Äôs best played at yellow ranks
---
PLEASE HOW WILL I FEED MY KIDS
---
So? People have always this discussion with huntress. It's not pedophilia, she is an adult, even if she has mental problems she is still an adult.
---
Ohm!!
---
no u
---
Dedicated servers and therefore punishments are soon, let them all rot in a lobby together, never actually getting a game due to someone always DCing, it's a funny thought
---
*looks at post history* Well that's ironic.
---
What you just said doesn‚Äôt even exist.  Lol Was the streamer you watch randomly saying this shit and you soaked it up like a sponge and regurgitating orr was it you making this up? I‚Äôm confused. I mean I know it‚Äôs edgy for girls to call anyone an incel that‚Äôs on their bad side but come on. Lol
---
Guess they never miss, huh?
---
Petition for fat, neutered Brian Griffin as the next survivor
---
I didn't downvote you tho. I left no score. at all
---
about perk changes
---
Wake Up - still not worth the perk spot, but a welcome change
---
Pharmacy - the increase is worthless. I'd make it so you either get a green or purple med-kit
---
 Vigil - good change, but I'd go a step higher. I'd make it give you a 50% recovery increase when standing still (or working on a gen)
---
 Remember Me - there's a problem with remember me. it's too weak to use normally and too strong when there's one guy left and EGC is going on. I'd revert the old remember me but make it not affect the last survivor
---
 Blood Warden - it not activating on door that isn't open yet is a form of counterplay against it and I'm not sure if I want it changed
---
No kidding haha just got to rank 8 myself!
---
There are a couple of things you can do to this;
---
1) Brutal Strength kicks down the pallets faster while also having the added bonus of allowing you to kick Gens faster. It's a Trapper unlock, so it's only one killer and it's pretty easy to get. Probably the least effective tactic though.
---
2) Spirit Fury + Enduring. Gotta level up two killers for this one, as Spirit has Fury and Hillbilly has Enduring. You break two pallets as normal, and then the third pallet that gets smashed over your head automatically breaks and you're barely stunned. This gives you what is basically a "free" hit since the Survivors can't make it to another pallet unless you got really unlucky with pallet spawns.
---
3) Just destroy the pallets and keep chasing the Survivor. The thing is that eventually the Survivors are going to run out of pallets (specifically on the side of the map your on), so just following someone around who likes to throw down pallets is eventually going to screw over the entire Survivor side since there are no more pallets to throw down. You've got to be able to apply enough pressure (through Hex: Ruin, Thrilling Tremors, or something else) in order for this to be a viable tactic cause it can take some time to do though.

Good job my closest was when I got 31,950

Wouldn‚Äôt call wraith stealth. Unless you have that one add on, he literally announces he‚Äôs about to attack you
---
How dare you! My father died in a salt mine!
---
Ayyyyyy we watch the same stugf
---
and that's why it won't be implemented
---
Sadly incel has just about lost its meaning because of the misuse of the word.
---
Loooooool it's you I see your all stocked
---
No killer is OP w/o certain add ons/offerings
---
Please no. One of the few benefits to playing this game on console. I never want to have to deal with that
---
You can't be a nice killer if you play that toxic killer
---
"HUUUUNTERRRR!!!"
---
"No! Bill put down the gun! It's just the Legion!"
---
I been playing for 3 days. It‚Äôs fun but I really wish I knew wtf you guys are talking about. All these terms and names I have no idea what is going on.
---
Holy shi thats so good
---
They have better frames and connection and smoother gameplay. Whereas console is janky as shit
---
Would give an award if I had money
---
Although it would have been mechanically difficult to implement, the Hunter could have made a really cool Killer, change my mind.
---
That‚Äôs a shit argument in it self. Just because SOME people won‚Äôt have the advantage doesn‚Äôt mean that it should be ignored. We should be able to play on an equal playing field and since we can‚Äôt, it should not be a forced option
---
$60 is a cheap gaming headset relatively speaking
---
i also heard players saying his chainsaw should apply deep wound effect and not be able to break pallets + his movement speed to be decreased to 110 because he already has a mobility power
---
like wtf, you basically want to make him worse than LF, Billy is fine and really balanced
---
Fucking Amazing! Best fan trailer I‚Äôve seen in my life!
---
I actually made this my myself thank you
---
Why did you take a picture of your screen, every device capable or running this game has a screenshot function
---
It's just boring to hold M1 most of the game
---
There‚Äôs a lot of rumors about a stranger things tie in, but that‚Äôs all we know for the near future.
---
The cast is already star studded though, with killers like Freddy, leatherface, ghostface, Michael Myers, and saw.
---
The idea is ok but 5 minutes and a half is way too much time
---
It would be hard to play with only one hand
---
me against a ghost face with a mori is just "why aren't they picking them up?" and then i see their head lift up and i go üò≥
---
#AH SHIT WE'VE BEEN FOUND OUT. ABORT, **ABORT**
---
Perks shouldn't have the ability to affect actual details of the game.
---
That encourages a team mate to just chill by the killer for a while, hell no.
---
Mettle of man just needs to be forgotten, it was an atrocious addition to the game and I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs gone.
---
I did actually make this myself but wouldn't be surprised if it'd been done before. Sorry if I did
---
I‚Äôm kicking myself for not knowing he streamed DBD too.
---
Honestly the only nerf I can see being justified on him is to make him slower while revving up the saw so that it's a little harder to just run up on someone and rev the saw right behind their head. Otherwise yeah he's not OP, I'd argue he's almost a benchmark of how strong a simple killer should be.
---
Just sign your name in blood right here on this dotted line, and my superiors can arrange a way to settle your debt.
---
I would just use them then. No harm no foul, right?
---
It needs to be buffed. This isn't about changing the perk, but about making it stronger or more useful.
---
the switch version comes with 9 killers, 10 survivors, and 3 cosmetic packs (plus the exclusive trapper skin)
---
Or somehow get into the hatch
---
That ones pretty good actually. You can see the shape is off a little bit, but that‚Äôs probably the closest one I‚Äôve seen accurate to the In-Game one.
---
Lol bruh really, he has an unique voice! üòÇüòÇ
---
It can happen to anyone I think it happened to me many times (about 12 times)
---
They should make the Shrine of Secrets only feature perks from DLCs.
---
Billy is an amazing example of balance in this game and should be used as a reference point for a strong but fair killer. I wish every killer was on his level.
---
It's quite the absurd amount. I'll just use them whenever I feel like I deserve to rank up or something. Don't want to ruin the game for others, and myself. Thanks :)
---
He does, doesn‚Äôt he?
---
Just don‚Äôt tunnel
---
Eye see what you did there!
---
Artistic nudity that is mildly pornographic.
---
Regardless there's a sub for this stuff, it doesn't belong here.
---
Well really 2 was supposed to be the last. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch was a strange one with a completely isolated story that supposed to start a tradition of Halloween movies set about different tales/folklore/etc. It was a weird movie and did very poorly so they just brought back Michael to do watered down slasher flicks.
---
Then they decided all the narrative past the first movie was not canon. It‚Äôs weird. The new movie was decent though.
---
Honestly i would use them to unlock some perks(if you truly have that many) that you want like, in my case, i would use them for Deliverance. In your case, you may want something else but it‚Äôs the same principle.
---
I have to disagree with you on Fire Up. At tier 3, if all 5 gens are completed, it is on the same level as Brutal Strength and Bamboozle. The only problem is, that's too late now.
---
You've played the game with one less perk, the gates are powered, and you finally have a somewhat useful bonus from Fire Up. The only issue is that the change is so negligible that if you see a survivor vault a window, it's still faster to just go around. Same with pallets. Unless you stack Fire Up with Brutal Strength and Bamboozle, it doesn't have that much of an impact on your chase times.
---
I can understand the argument that his ability has 0 drawbacks. Billy can do everything without any penalty. Also his hitboxes are completely broken.
---
Isnt it Klingon cloaking device?
---
Please no. PC players would have such a huge advantage over console
---
Like any game, everything comes with experience bud. You just got to learn the ropes on your own sometimes. The more you play, the more you will adapt to countering flashlights and findings those Claudettes. Community is toxic only if you let them, either ignore it or fight back with fire. Depends what time of day you play on will sync you in a low rank match simply because they don‚Äôt want you qued forever.
---
Fuck the music skosxlldlxlüò≠
---
You need ruins or they will do gens faster than u can break the pallets.
---
and i think tcm 2003 remake version of leatherface was in mortal kombat x so i dont know what would stop them from getting leatherface skins
---
He‚Äôs just obnoxious I guess
---
Well the idea is not that it's over powered but the fact that in my opinion that all survivors getting the exposed effect should be put on the back of the team as a whole instead of the mistake of one person. This rework idea is to put the harshest punishment on the one who broke the totem while keeping the idea of all survivors suffering thus the repair speed decrease for the time. However it does still suffer from needing to be broken in the first place but survivors not playing into the killer's hand is a problem all hexs can suffer from.  And due to the new effect it would make weather the survivors are injured or not irrelevant and slows down the game which most killers want so even there it more of a buff. Now instead of a sometimes getting multi downs or sometimes get none. It would be consistent at slowing down the game (well as consistent as hexs like this can be) while being under my absurd sense of balance for the exposed effect.
---
Thank you be a part of the discussion I look forward to a rebuttal.
---
Good work.  Funny how I didn't realize that were that many survivors until now.
---
Honestly, at this point *any* rank rewards would be nice. Rank is completely pointless at the moment since it doesn't even dictate what players you go against, give that matchmaking is so broken. I will say this is one of the most "balanced" ones yet, Iridescant Shards are the best of the three currencies to give out I think. 
---
~~Sure we want Auric Cells but that's not realistic.~~

**Note :** *"This was made purely for entertainment only and i have nothing against anyone." -DR.TheOnlyJigmac*

Was that momo that i heard

Legion is fast boy
---
But how many ~~add-ons~~ electrons he will need to be stable?
---
That's fair, lol I feel alone when I say the likes of "yay! Facing Legion!" Lol
---
Look all im gonna say is if you get unhooked and when i check the hook your still there, your getting hooked again.
---
well spirit fury completely counters reconstruction btw and maybe instead of haste its just like a 3/4/5 sec speed boost
---
That ain't camping bro, it's stupidity on the survivor's part xD
---
Platform: PC
---
Bug Type: Ingame
---
Losing pips on killer disconnects if they do it after we joined the actual game, if they do it within 10s-4 minutes and no emblems have been gotten I depip. It is not a visual bug and restarting the game does nothing. Happened 2 times in a row today. Has happened multiple times since the last 2 rank resets and nothing has been done.
---
That is some cinematic shit right there!
---
He came back to save us from the almighty Entity Lord!
---
Ghost Face : \*\*stalks from afar\*\*
---
I‚Äôve seen one with 100+ before
---
It was on his twitch steam yesterday I believe (I get confused because I watch vods mainly).
---
He explained he was going to make a video, but then got frustrated and said it all.
---
Well the idea is to make it better for survivors without ruining it for killer's by slowing the game and making it more consistent.
---
If you get exsposed it should be a sacrifice you made the choice of  or you deserve it. Not just happenstance that you got hit as a friend just broke haunted grounds. Although I could just be trash.
---
Thank you for being a part of the discussion. I look forward to a rebuttal
---
Nope just once but that's all it takes to punish a babytunnels gamer hard if you know how to loop which I do.  When I am focused that hard it's not uncommon at all for a killer to lose all 5 gens doing it.  Even if they manage to kill me they're punished hard for doing it.
---
Yes
---
Thank you very much. I'll look at maybe doing some other stuff future definitely. :)
---
Nice!!!
---
How do I cut off my right hand if I don‚Äôt have a left hand
---
It's not a rumor. It's confirmed. The Stranger Things twitter fucked up &amp; tweeted out that "They were so happy to have a collaboration with BHVR". Then the licensing manager for BHVR replied to the tweet &amp; liked it. It's absolutely confirmed.
---
in that case, where the *fuck* can you get the hoodie for Joey?
---
I mean yeah, but having to hold M1 for even longer without any ability to speed it up(Maybe Leader works on mending, but I'm not sure and then again, why would you run a perk to counter one killer in the game) is boring and thankfully devs are going to do something about it in the near future
---
I think they‚Äôve fixed that, and when they did, this bug started happening lol.
---
50/50
---
Lol usual bhvr
---
I've seen no one ever complain about this perk.
---
Maybe brown and yellow survivors who don't know about obscure killer perks do. 
---
On the other hand I see killers complaining about every decent survivor perk imaginable so I'm not sure you should be targeting survivors specifically for complaining about perks.
---
To bring you to exit just to mori you
---
*sadness noises*
---
Hundreds of tiny Michael Myers stalking you.
---
No need to have so many. Just let him get to Tier 3 and he'll take you down with a toothpick too...
---
That was such a sick scene
---
Oh I just realized I forgot to mention, this is my first post on here so hello dbd friends!
---
When the killer tunnels.
---
Zubatlel recent video with bubba and demi's recent video too. Other ones as well like monto
---
How was that person running back around in the exit gate past the threshold LOL
---
Or to drop you and close the hatch in front of your face
---
I would replace Self-care since Deliverance blocks you from healing for a while and Self-care takes a hefty amount of time to heal you. Probably better to use an Exhaustion perk to help with chases.
---
Also, Ace in the Hole is a pretty good perk, but only worthwhile when you pair it with Plunderer's Instinct. I'd probably drop Ace in the Hole for something like Borrowed Time or Decisive Strike.
---
Ironically, my husband (avid FPS player) hates it and will only play if we have a friends-only game and rotate killer.
---
I wouldn't mind if they implemented your idea, as a survivor main Im saying this. I have no issue with HG myself bc its basically a 1 time tier 3 meyers activation for any killer and then it is a dead perk. A lot of the time I go against it and it gets cleansed most the team knows to hide and wait it out, yeah it can be popped while you are being chased, but the killer will probably only down you with it and then its a dead perk. I mostly play 2-4 man swf so we kinda can tell if it is HG and avoid it and when I am playing solo I rarely have it popped as I'm being chased, if it does I just hope I can run them till it wears off
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/com0k4/may_have_this_wrong_but_why_is_balanced_landing/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
lol people complain about that perk? its garbage. Honestly its weak enough that it could be baked in to all killers baseline and it wouldnt affect the game really. Body blocking a killer/hooks was always a stupid abuse of collision in this game and was never meant to be an actual mechanic.  Mad Grit is just a waste of a perk slot.
---
alkali
---
What? I've only heard adrenaline get co.plained about. Have u been on this sub before? Noed, rancor, ruin, devour hope, and bbq are complained about constantly. Old decisive was complained about cause it gave a free second chance for nothing. So did MoM. You are kidding yourself if you think killers complain more than survivors and this is coming from a person who plays survivor more than killer.
---
Yeah, I'm the salty one sure bud ;)
---
That is what I indeed said.
---
Well let's just say this: When old legion was a thing the playerbase was at an all time low according to steam data. They very nearly killed the game if they hadn't reworked them.
---
No the thing where you can spam the regular hits because there is no cooldown.
---
I still think he is well designed/balanced, but he is definitely not as good as the top 3.
---
Don't get your hopes up about Stranger Things characters getting added to the game. Lots of desperate people here who are really making evidence out of rumors.
---
Adrenaline
---
Is this true? If so, I stand corrected.
---
Balanced Landing is very map dependent. Godlike on Haddonfield but a bit weak on some maps.
---
Dead hard is killer dependent. useless vs 1 hit kill killers, but pretty good vs Nurse.
---
Sprint burst is strong, and helps vs campers, but has the drawback of making you walk too much.
---
Welp, that just means more bloodpoints. Win win.
---
One person you HAVE to watch is Fungoose. He‚Äôs a twitch streamer and is without a doubt in my mind the best killer in DBD. He‚Äôs an educational streamer so he tells you what he‚Äôs doing and why. He‚Äôs a Plague main with 7,000 hours in the game but plays all killers, 4ks every single game. The exit gates have been opened against him literally ONE time this month, and it was because he was playing Legion against a SwF. Usually exit gates are only opened against him once a month (and these are 8-12 hour type streams). I can‚Äôt exaggerate. You have to watch him lol, i think he‚Äôs streaming maybe around 9-10PM tonight. I would also say he‚Äôs the best survivor main. I sound like a shill but I can‚Äôt say in words how good he is
---
I play on xbox usually around midnight onwards and find matches very quickly around rank 9. But most of the time the survivors have red ranks which can complicate things sometimes
---
Naw hes dead.
---
I was probably the only non-legion player that liked going against him. I run No Mither, Tenacity, Unbreakable and Dead Hard. This was the only killer where No Mither was an actual honest counter. I left no bloodmark so they had a hard time moonwalking me and the 50% noise reduction on ace makes it hard to track via audio cues. Their 110% movement speed made it hard to chase me normally and if I were to go down because of the deep wounds, I could crawl away while recovering and just get up myself. I miss these times :'(
---
Boop the snoot.
---
Wait till you reach red lol
---
Yeah
---
That‚Äôs such a dick move. Sabotage the people AFTER the last game because you‚Äôre salty. If you see 3 flashlights in the lobby, why not put it on then and there? If they play their best shit then you play yours. But if I‚Äôm queued into a lobby and you play a Mori while I‚Äôm chilling with no items, I‚Äôll restart the game lol
---
I'd personally put him next to Billy.
---
Where Killers should be, but not overpowered (nurse) or underpowered (Leatherface).
---
The fact that his traps come down as fast as they do is great, and the pallets are awesome, but it's balanced out by the sleep mechanic.
---
And while I stand by the fact that his map pressure isn't as good as Billy's (Since Billy can run anywhere and Freddy is limited to gens), he still has some considerable map pressure.
---
Or the toilet paper to cover them nips
---
I‚Äôve had the same, but honestly I couldn‚Äôt wait so I changed my country/region so that I could play the beta.
---
Don't be such a Meg
---
It's a glitch.
---
Head On &gt;:)
---
Underrated post
---
Since it's not worth opening up a new thread for, what are we looking at for the Stranger Things killer?
---
I'd assume the Demagorgon, but what does it actually do? I don't have a Netflix account and haven't seen the show.
---
1) probably survive with friends, and yes its broken and annoying. Basically a rank 5-1 playing survive with friends with his rank 19 pal who either just got the game or worse has experience just hasn't played since the rank reset. Supposedly theres a fix where match making will match killers based on the highest ranking survivor rather than the average but I'm not sure if thats true.
---
2. I have no idea why this community is so exceptionally toxic, but a good deal of it has to do with how many exploits the devs leave in the game to be toxic. Like before toxic survivors would dance around the map trying to bore the killer into DCing for 40 minutes if they crushed them. You know what solved that? Making it so you literally cannot do that anymore with the collapse. 
---
3. yes there are issues with maps, its better than it was before but there are still plenty of infinite loops for survivors to exploit. A lot of being a good survivor in this game is just playing it enough that you can exploit loops for maximum effect so teammates can focus on gens. The idea of stealth is thrown out the window by most experienced survivors.
---
4. thats what shes nicknamed blendette.  Devs had a mind fart and didn't realize pairing dark skin tons with dark clothing makes some survivors way easier to hide than others.
---
6. I feel like it gets faster once you get into the swing of using actual perk builds and such. Problem is its grind AF to get actual perk teachables either through the shrine or through leveling.
---
7. Mostly a bullshit term, but basically the act of going after one survivor and one survivor only because you know you can kill them faster. Which is a valid strat because well its way easier to kill people with only 3 survivors rather than 4.  That said I found a lot of times a "tunneling" accusation gets thrown about its just because the survivor that got hooked the first time is *gasp* way easier to find and catch than their teammates by habit. I generally tried to avoid rehooking the same person twice because decisive strike but a lot of time some SWF will drag their level 19 friend into my match and their potato pal  will literally bump into me repeatedly. Survivors who toss around tunneling accusations should really ask themselves "Am I being tunneled or am I just bad at not getting hit?"
---
8. Look to the side, hope the flashlight doesnt have good add ons, don't pick up a dying survivor until you found and downed the flashlighter, position yourself so the flashlighter cannot see your face while picking up, eat the blind kick the pallet and do your best to follow the sound. A lot of flashlight users vastly overestimate how much distance they can get by blinding at a pallet if you do that. And if all else fails I suggest getting Franklin's demise when you can.  Makes them drop items when hit and at rank 2/3 they lose charges.
---
9. youtube, Tru3 does some mind tricks and suck, theres also other tutorials on there. But basically you need to learn the difference between a safe pallet and a dangerous pallet and when and how to mindgame.
---
Thats just a bad killer tbh but both sides complain way too much
---
Bro dcing is pussy wtf. When I bring a mori I do it on their last hook so they'd be dead anyway I just want the extra points. People who dc at that point need to change their diaper. Also it's tough to tell from the lobby cause there are some survivors that think they are noob3 or ochido with flashlights and shit but end up flash lighting my crotch instead so. Also at high ranks you get them reliably almost every game so.
---
Nice try
---
What you don't have anything else to say? oh but "killers don't complain about survivors perks except for adren and im a survivor main !!11!!"
---
Damn that's wholesome, nice haha
---
It‚Äôll get worse and more challenging I know lol
---
1. Matchmaking works like this: it will first try and match players of the same rank +/-3. After a while, it gives up and matches anyone together. Because there are only 3 days until rank reset, very few players are your rank, so you're being thrown into any lobby with a free slot.
---
2. The community is verbally aggressive, but gameplay-wise, it's tolerable. R6 Siege's teamkilling, DC'ing and AFK'ing were all much worse. Plus, there's no voice chat  \\o/
---
3. Most maps are dookie. If you've broken a couple pallets without hitting the Survivor, go find someone else. Plus, Killer shack is ridiculously safe.
---
4. Blendettes have been a problem forever. Always check tall grass, corn and corners.
---
5. Just here or the list breaks.
---
6. Focus on Hillbilly and Hag for now. They are strong without perks or add-ons and you can use them to grind.
---
7. Tunnelling is when you focus on one Survivor, while ignoring others. Generally you'll be called a tunneller if you chase some who's just been unhooked. Survivors hat it because they don't get much of a chance to do gens or totems, and can't get points towards their Benevolent Emblem.
---
8. You can't avoid them when vaulting or breaking a pallet. When picking someone up, try to face a wall or tall object before starting the animation.
---
9. Check OhTofu and Ardetha on YouTube. They break down people's matches and give advice.
---
It's possible to do as many games do and have 5 days of an average value for the common currency (bloodpoints) then the last two days have a small amount of the more important currency, in this case, Iri Shards. Numbers are tuned so if you want the same value as buying it, on in this case leveling up, you have to claim your daily for multiple months in a row so no economies are damaged, and if you want something big you'd have to save a ridiculously long time or just spend money, but either Shrine is more accessible or players can buy some of the cheaper outfits more reliably.
---
You just need the mask, your kitchen knife, and to take your shirt off*

What? I just said my response can you read? What else is to be said till someone responds?
---
No idea. Personally I hate Stranger Things. I'm not excited in the slightest.

He doesnt, it will be too cold for him when playing on Ormond

Yes and it's only with DBD. Other games with better graphics? Can barely hear the fan unless I try. DBD? Computer sounds like it's going to fly to space.

That's exciting, I'll check him out, thanks!

---
Did you post it on a separate account? The only user that replied is braceyplayz
---
Nope, y'all need to see this. We need representation
---
Yes I agree it is easy as hell to loop which is why I said I routinely do it to killers attempting to tunnel me for numerous gens regularly.  Yet despite it being easy to do as you readily admit you still questioned my ability to do it based on zero evidence to the contrary.
---
When the hell did anyone mention a Nurse specifically?  If you have to default to the one killer in game that breaks all chase mechanics to make your point than it isn't a very sound one.  Not to mention any respectable nurse wouldn't tunnel survivors off hook anyways.  There's no need to, you're a fucking nurse lol.
---
If the killer has noed active, but didn‚Äôt hit anyone yet so the survivors don‚Äôt know, will the survivor still open gates 50% faster or just the 25%
---
Hiding the lobby does nothing, and adding a delay kills stream interactivity. Saying 'they stream so it's only fair' is crazy, none of us would accept someone coming to our place of work each day and harassing us, why should it be any different just because your place of work is the Internet? Victim blaming is an absolute fail.
---
Stop making OP killer ideas, BHVR might add it into the game.
---
Thanks dude! I see what you mean by not opening doors to countering blood warden. Also when I posted this, like as soon as you left your comment it got downvoted. I shouldn't have assumed it was you. My bad. 
---
On pharmacy, it does give you a green medkit and some people say the green one is better than the purple because of the quicker healing speed. Purple is slightly slower but with more charges.
---
You should snowball if you hit someone off the hook. And if they have borrowed, hit them and leave them, it creates pressure
---
Max 32000?
---
Sigh. OK send them here. https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cokqf5/stock_up_here/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Yep
---
Niiiiiice
---
Wdym? Just curious. Up the ante affects the game by giving survivors the equivalent of a very rare luck offering. Self-care alows survivors to heal without a medkit. Do you mean like it shouldn't affect basic mechanics such as how long end game is or what windows spawn where?
---
I like the challenge.
---
Honestly if there are 3, 2 or 1 gens left, two ppl and I get caught... I‚Äôm giving up and letting the other person try to get the hatch. Why would I wanna be selfish and have them risk their life for me &gt;_&gt; just go find the hatch, Bc the killer is gonna camp me.
---
Congrats my dude!
---
Yeah, I don't disagree entirely. You should spread out the injured, but if you see someone come off the hook, you shouldn't ignore them.
---
Don‚Äôt bite ur nails plz
---
So it's just worse borrowed time?
---
Thats the huge issue, its been a persistent bug that isn't easy to replicate and thus it can't be solved that readily.
---
Same thing with Phantom hits, just go look up "phantom saw" to see a clear version of it hillbilly saw.
---
*they‚Äôre
---
Actually the 12th time it's been posted. Its lame.
---
Huh, I see what you mean but fire up is a combo of those two perks as well as additional benefits. Making it any stronger would make it too op, right?
---
No perks should be able to affect the static countdown of endgame.
---
Shit the grammer police got me
---
Clown is d?
---
I absolutely agree. Unfortunately I highly doubt that‚Äôll ever happen though because killer mains would get upset. That‚Äôs why they increased the hitboxes when legion came out.
---
A survivor sent me a salty message saying I found him using an exploit, aka BBQ&amp;Chili.So yeah.
---
I thought Freddy was the worst killer in the game?
---
It makes since that freddy could reach you there.
---
You are in the dream world after all.Which freddy has control over.
---
Time enough to down and hook someone else. Find the person again and get d-struck
---
Go kick some gens dweeb
---
I dont, I just cut them right before this pic, I'm good
---
I mean, moris only work after the the survivor has already been hooked once.
---
I get what your saying, seeing the exit always as well as having people see you open it is very helpful but it should open the exits quicker, especially now since Remember Me has been changed.
---
\*laughs in just upgrading the survivors\*
---
I like tiered perks
---
Also if you really want to I guess you can zoom in, that's not skin it's more nail
---
They need to lock the framerates on the title screen to prevent that. No idea why they haven't yet.
---
My thoughts:
---
**Mettle of Man**
---
Mettle of Man needs an entirely new effect. It was annoying before, it's almost impossible to acquire now, and your rework would make it annoying again.
---
-With your Mettle of Man: Killer picks up first downed Survivor and heads to hook, Ash bodyblocks once and gets a token, Killer hooks Survivor, Ash instaheals and immediately unhooks Survivor with BT. No matter what the Killer does now, they're screwed. If they hit Ash, he gets his 2nd and 3rd tokens and can take another hit thanks to MoM. If they tunnel, the Survivor has BT and possibly DS and Ash gets his 2nd token. Ash played stupidly, but the Killer gets punished and Ash gets rewarded.
---
My suggestion? Remove protection hits and add generators. For every safe unhook and generator they complete the Survivor gains a token. At 3 tokens Mettle of Man activates and any damage that would put the Survivor into the Dying state from the Healthy state instead puts them into the Deep Wounds state. It'd be a perk to counter instadowns instead of M1 Killers.
---
**Flip-Flop**
---
I honestly don't think the perk needs to be that strong to have a good effect. You can already use Flip Flop as is with decent success in the right situation.
---
IMO old Flip-Flop's effect should stay at a 50% conversion rate but become part of Boil Over, to make that perk less garbage. Flip-Flop itself should get an entirely new effect.
---
My suggestion? If the Killer hits you while carrying a Survivor that Survivor gains 10/15/20% progression on their wiggle bar. When a Survivor breaks free from the Killer's Grasp due to your efforts this perk enters into a 60 second cooldown. It's still a perk about wiggling free, but now it helps your teammates instead of yourself.
---
**Buckle Up**
---
I don't quite understand your version of Buckle Up. It seems like it'd work somewhat like an instaheal, but only if the Survivor had half recovered already and with the penalty of revealing you and your teammate to the Killer.
---
Personally I'd leave it as is, just with the addition that any Survivor you heal from the Dying state gains the Endurance status effect for 10 seconds.
---
LOOL, you are saying you're the best player in the game dude, you are boasting about your hours and saying: "TrY tuNNElIng me In GaME anD sEE how aCcuraTe thAt sTatEMENt is"
---
Definitely not. It sounds op because it has the effects of two perks in one, but only when the game is over.
---
Bear in mind, Bamboozle also blocks a window for 16 seconds. Why would I run Fire Up if I could use Bamboozle? Bamboozle is strong the whole game and blocks the loop while Fire Up is only good as a late game Brutal Strength Bamboozle combo.
---
That being said, killers aren't really designed to play for the late game. Survivors have a very simple objective for escaping. They open the gates, they leave. Fire Up doesn't have enough impact to catch survivors as they are already leaving.
---
Dead Hard
---
This is why r/dbdgonewild was created.
---
Thank you so much, but I sincerely hope it never comes down to people having to pay for them.
---
Killer: *Attempts to pick up the survivor they downed within 60 seconds of being unhooked instead of not tunneling or slugging*
---
Survivor: *uses D Strike*
---
Killer: *surprised Pikachu*
---
At least stand still while taking the pic...
---
Not only would this be helpful towards getting new killers, but it would actually give people a *reason* to be toxic at higher ranks
---
Yeah even in higher ranks ruin is still worth it, especially on ghostface. If you‚Äôre in higher ranks you should know ghostface is poo poo at keeping map pressure.
---
Lmaooo
---
Did you also drink a gallon of red bull before snapping it?
---
I don‚Äôt think i like that. Really messes with me if i‚Äôm playing killer and they know i‚Äôm behind x wall while waiting for that one baby meg to go for the unsafe unhook right after i hook the survivor.
---
I've only seen Scream 1. I want to watch the others. I've heard the way tbe Scream movie series works is that there's copycat killers each movie. That makes sense considering the ending of Scream.
---
Never played Freddy pre-rework. Now, he has a lot of mobility from his Projection, the Projection allows you to pressure gens while you are doing something else, the Snares are basically Clown bottles but way better, and personally I think the Pallets are a bit underwhelming.
---
Ironically, Freddy get‚Äôs pretty weak at the end of the game. He has fewer (or none at all) gens to teleport to, robbing him of his mobility. I believe that if he could teleport to finished gens or at least the exit gates, he‚Äôd be much better. It might make him a bit busted, but I think that‚Äôs he really needs.
---
As for his placement on the hierarchy, he‚Äôs not Billy or Spirit level, but inbetween them and the rest. I‚Äôd say he‚Äôs on the same level as the Hag. Good mobility, good chase-ending tools, and, in general, powerful.
---
Also, the fact that none of his abilities slow him down is a massive quality of life aspect. Clown is slowed down whenever he throws a bottle, and that really drives me crazy.
---
PS4, ingame bug
---
I had a game with a very laggy Freddy the other day, I pulled a Jake from the hook and when he tried to wake me up I was locked in place unable to move. It was not lag as everyone around me was moving just fine including the killer, who was able to slap me. He was able to kill get me into the dying state but I was still in the crouched position and they were not able to pick me up. Him closing the hatch wouldn't let me use my adrenaline either so I had to DC.
---
I'm not sure if this was because of the lag that might of got me into this state, but the rest of the game didn't feel as laggy as it did when I was floored.
---
Even if it comes to us having to pay for them i would be fine with it as long as it‚Äôs the same quality as the cosmetic items.
---
Nea = new bush
---
What‚Äôs coincidence... I just saw this episode about an hour ago haha
---
I run around like a crackhead lol. If someone tries runnin me around I instead run to opposite of where they want me to go then they are trying to get me away from their friends. Bamboozle and bbq together let me get the gen they are currently working on.
---
Then they could do it like every other game, if you use controller then you play with people who are using controller. If it‚Äôs mixed in a party then it‚Äôs with either
---
That's right get yo *MegAss* outta here...
---
The trap should've still killed her. The traps still kill if they try to leave when it's been activated. Putting a trap by the end of the game is useless since there are no more generators to be completed thus no activation. However, you mentioned it was already on by the 3rd gen all the way up until the exit, so she should've died still having it on. It could've just been a bug, coming from DBD, that wouldn't be much of a surprise
---
In what way?
---
Buff both solo survivors and killer to bring everyone closer to swf.
---
Haha, I'll remember this post. Thanks though!
---
Then get DS‚Äôd idk what to tell you

Nobody watches that scene without crying

Hex/ stop touching my damn stuff AKA Hex: Haunted Ground.

I‚Äôve reached the rank 1 before. Nothing too difficult just groups of gen rushers. Use the plague. Should be easier to deal with.

Nothing is truly conclusive, but data and patterns can be mapped to give a fairly decent representation.

I can‚Äôt arrange them, but you probably are looking at Billy, Freddy, Spirit, Nurse and... Huntress? Up for debate.
---
Who says stuff like this? Is it really that important that you feel you have to call someone out because they haven't responded to your post? Grow up.
---
Gotcha!
---
Does it come in chicken flavour?
---
25% precent bcz theoretically you aren't exposed
---
I think I failed to make a clear point. What I meant is that players that only play survivors have difficulty emphatizing with the killer.
---
They fail to understand that their opponent is also a human being that wants to do well just like them. And most of the times in order to do well you need to do somethings survivors wont like (Be it "camping", "tunneling", or using powerfull killers and add-ond)
---
And guess what, killers get equally -if not more- irritated when survivors use powerfull perks, items or tactics as well. It is part of the game, it is a war that both sides wants to win.
---
I want survivors to see how things can be really tough as a killer. I want them to recognise how impossible it is to win if you try play like how survivors wants you to play.
---
I just want a little emphaty.

---
Somewhat new to this game but I was playing as Nurse and used Blink and got outside the Exit Gates. I was able to teleport back in but didnt take time to replicate it
---
This is just aggressively unfunny. Get a different hobby my guy.
---
Insta-heals are a little unbalanced, but for a 1 time use it's not super op. And it usually only works if the killer is slugging. But I completely agree with you on the map offerings. Some are just too survivor sided,  but there are also maps that really, really suck for survivors.
---
Wraith sucks so badly... He needs more updates :&lt;
---
That actually sounds fun. Draw a triangle somewhere, leave it there, and teleport to it whenever you want.
---
Bruh, so glad I stopped playing this game. It's community is a bunch of Pride supporting, dick riding faggots.
---
How long will that be? A year from now
---
This is easy, try making a legion cosplay
---
It‚Äôs really easy to just tap your screen before taking a pic, focusing the picture. Lol but congrats on the almost 32k
---
Yeah you just only get to save two health states and negate an entire killer‚Äôs chase. Or heal behind a pallet versus an M1 killer and loop him for another minute. Not super OP at all, you‚Äôre right.
---
Every map in the game is pretty survivor favored. No maps ‚Äúreally, really suck for survivors‚Äù.
---
Is genrushing bad?
---
Unfortunately, I have an older iPhone and the quality of my camera is usually like that :( but thank you for the kind words
---
I prefer to ignore any hate messages I get, I dont have the best nerves out there and can hardly stay calm under that much toxicity (Mostly harming myself in the process)
---
And I will be happy even if I manage to make only one person realize how it is like to be on the other side of the coin.
---
Finally got the "Blood in your Face" Achie today for mori-ing all 4 survivors in one game, it was a joy actually and even more so because it was a 4-man SWF group :p
---
Nice play!!
---
Lol no this 2019
---
Even though this is the only Spirit cosplay I‚Äôve seen, I have a feeling it‚Äôs going to be the best.
---
There ain't any gosh darn GhostFace splinters ma dude.
---
This is actually when I get those most excited and most anxiety playing as survivor.
---
I think so
---
Yes, these ones, any increase to repair, heal or movement speed would be just broken, the others are really nice tho and i think they could be even stronger , also i dont like lauries being the obsession, it adds no value other then being the obssesion which in itself has no value. I would go even a step further and add a bp bonus to playing multiple killers and survivors  just to increase variety
---
The problem with that statement is Survivors seem to decide that every time they get slammed into the dirt they where tunneled... There is nothing wrong with D-strike and if it's gone it's gone, it's best they use it early so they can't when the gates are open!
---
Congrats! It only goes downhill from there.
---
If thats op, then the iridescent head addon is op, Billy's chainsaw is op, LF's chainsaw is op, Michael Myers tier 3 is op, Ghost Face marking people is op, NOeD is op, Devour Hope is OP, Haumted Grounds is op, etc. Why? Oh because it takes away 2 health states instead of one. 
---
(Hint: They're not op. Some things HAVE to be strong.)
---
And I literally agreed with you on the Map thing, but SOME maps do suck for survivors. (Ex: Most survivors HATE "The Game.")
---
Daddy I hear a black woman crying!  
---
It's just a train passing by son no need to worry.

I know. I'm just poking fun- I've been running Iron Will since I first started playing last December, and I just find it really funny that everyone went from saying the perk isn't really all that good to 'Everyone has to run it because Spirit exists'.

Also freddy. All you need is his finger knife glove(which you can get at almost every Halloween/costume store), his green and red sweater (also at almost every Halloween/costume store), a brown fedora or even a replica of his fedora, and maybe mask of his face? When I dressed up for him on one Halloween, I just painted on red spots on my face with some Halloween face paint kit. Also you have to be a smartass.
---
I main survivor, and I'm only a rank 18 killer.  Every time I play killer, this is the team I'm up against.  
---
3 generators are done in 2 minutes and I get every single pallet dropped on my head, followed by a blinding flashlight **every single time**.  When I can finally see again, I see the survivor out in the distance, waiting at the next pallet and t-bagging me through the fog.  
---
Like, where the fuck are all the potatoes I play with when I'm a survivor?  Where are the people who seem to not even know what a fucking generator is?  Why the fuck am I a rank 18 killer going up against a team of people 5 ranks higher than me?  
---
It really turns me off from playing killer.

all you gotta do is get naked as the spirit and roll around in glass

---
ngl this is deserving of being one of the highest rated posts on this sub
---
I see that too.
---
Myers is good, but has no real way to pressure his prey in the endgame unlike the above characters
---
But it is an exploit, you're not supposed to be there
---
Tier 1 Michael: Am i a joke to you?
---
Which add-on is that
---
See with Laurie I couldn't think of anything special about her perks that could be taken to be just a her thing besides the fact that that all of them increase her obsession chance. Sole survivor is meh and has nothing that could really be taken from, DS can't because it would be broken to have a built in DS and object would hurt the survivor more than benefit.
---
Also i wouldn't say heal or sabo speed increase is broken. Healing is good but it's not progressing the game faster, and sabo is eh. But to make it more fair we could say Dwight has increased proficiency when repairing gens with a toolbox (so his toolbox lasts longer but only slight), meg has slightly less exhaustion time (like instead of 60 50 40 she has 55,45,35, Claud could have increased proficiency in healing with medkit slightly, and jake increased proficiency in saboing with a toolbox.
---
ding, ding, ding now this reunion come to order
---
Ok thanks. I was thinking of getting ghostface, or myers. Ghostface because I could tea bag the toxic survivors and Myers because I have just heard a lot of good things about how good he is. I may just get ghostface or Freddy now.
---
‚ÄúI referenced stranger things gib likes‚Äù
---
I just had a match where a survivor being chased by a killer ran and circled several gens. Then the killer face camped after hooking me. So I don‚Äôt know which I hate more at the moment
---
They're not toxic on purpose necessarily, if you mean tunneling and camping. They don't know any better.
---
It's so obvious, yet I laughed.
---
Well done, good sir!
---
He‚Äôs even got the head tilt going. Nice.
---
Thank you for your story kind stranger, I hope we can build some bridges between two opposing sides (At least until they get destroyed by another controversial post)
---
People that do this are poop. Go do the objective or dc.
---
Very, very poorly, so luck will be needed
---
probably because they think they should camp. i remember when i was new, i thought that attacking a camped person still had an effect on their HP
---
Omae wa mou shindeiru
---
You don't have the drawbacks.
---
We don't know EXACTLY what the chapter would be, so it's an assumption.
---
There's still correlation.  You're allowed to disagree, but patterns are patterns, even in smaller samples.  In fact, if I document 100 games, and then document 100 more and the results are still very similar then it proves a point.  Pattern recognition.  The only thing that changes those data pools drastically are bloodpoint events.
---
The huntress spot is definitely based on the killers‚Äô skill, hag gives people hell, with great teachables to boot
---
Honestly no cosplay is easy unless it's a closet one.
---
Nah there‚Äôs only facecamping and proxycamping. If a survivor is around the hook and you hit them go chase the survivor and down them quick if you‚Äôre good. quit going back to the hook. Lol
---
You don‚Äôt even need to bother with the shirt anymore.
---
Honestly, I think there are too many details. Minimalist art tends to get all the way down to the bare essentials. The gradients feel out of place.
---
And yet you're here, my friend
---
I'd be okay with it.
---
Very true, I also don‚Äôt know how I feel about huntresses ranking currently because of how inconsistent her hatchets can be, sometimes you‚Äôll land hatchets you clearly miss and other times you‚Äôll miss hatchets that went straight through janes phat ass.
---
Pfft. Nah. Let me tell you. Have you ever cosplayed a map? I dont think you have havent you.
---
Camping is a fine strategy. It‚Äôs hilarious though when a killer acts like it was the survivor‚Äôs fault they camped when in reality they planned on proxy camping before they found a match. Like come on. Just admit you want to camp and it‚Äôs no one‚Äôs fault but you‚Äôre own.
---
Impossible
---
True
---
Oh god plz be Jason I don‚Äôt care if he‚Äôs in a lawsuit the remake is still up for grabs or they can do what they did with ghostface idc

You've really improved eye'm really proud of you

Whoever made that post about ds

I once bodyblocked a Billy so hard he couldn't get any hooks for 3 gens and when he did I looped and saved the hooked survivor then he hit me with the lagswitch and facecamped me and the 3 other survivors didn't attempt to even save me. But it's alright cause I was making hard plays and just bullying Billy to save my buddies so I'm just glad it was me who died and not Jane Kate or David cause those are my favorite survivors and that's who the other 3 were playing.
---
Oh cool
---
A L L  O F  T H E M !!!
---
Not even kidding
---
Freddy is really hot right now, and GF is pretty good too; you should pursue whatever playstyle interests you more.
---
Oh you meant Michael
---
It isn't different. But more survivors tbag then killers slash on the hook just cause of the numbers.
---
Because thats what hero davids do.
---
Im not saying that the data will be inherently wrong, merely that it‚Äôs much less likely to be as accurate as a proper study. The very observation changes the results if you‚Äôre playing as survivor since it impacts odds of facing Swf, and there‚Äôs one less variable. Playing killer means you only get a sample at whatever rank you are, not to mention that your rank will fluctuate meaning you face people at different ranks. It‚Äôll be interesting, but hardly accurate
---
Hey man im rank 15/16 and when i play at night I always go against rank 10s and even a couple rank 2-3. They always bring in their tolken rank 18 friend to get the match with me.
---
Its kinda bogus, when i play during the day the match making is usually better and I go against people who are my own rank and have fun and competative games, at night I just get bullied and end up getting mad.
---
Looks like Starbucks Halloween logo lol
---
True dat üòî
---
I play both killer and survivor and so I do have that aspect of empathy for killers, but I still hate undeserved tunnelling and camping and I still think there need to be more anti-tunnel perks, or maybe changes to the anti-tunnel perks we have. I usually don't mind the powerful killer perks or addons, unless it's a killer way above my rank and skill level as at that point I don't stand a chance. It's just every time I get tunnelled and camped I don't really deserve it, and I get tunnelled a lot.

No cosplay is lazy üò§

There's no salt im just calling you out for blatantly lying. You're saying you don't lose at red ranks with Wraith. That's an example of lying.

‚Ä¢ DEATH TIMER: +300 BP (New Score Event; Gained each time a Survivors Reverse Bear Trap Death Timer reaches either the 25%, 50%, or 75% marks)
---
having info on the helmet percent is hidden for a reason bro
---
Omg
---
*Laughs in Deliverance*
---
Even if everyone was a straight up badass in the lobbying if they are all running solo there‚Äôs no way to know what‚Äôs going on unless the hooked person is running kindred or if they go check out the situation themselves. This leads to gen time being wasted and there‚Äôs no way to weigh out your priorities when you‚Äôre not exactly sure what‚Äôs going on. Sure they could do 3 gens and sacrifice that dude‚Äôs first phase on the hook but that is rarely happening in solo que. when I say rarely I mean I‚Äôve seen it happen maybe twice with thousands of hours on the game and both of those times the guy wasn‚Äôt being camped anyways so it was more due to a reluctance of getting the gens done as opposed to countering anything.
---
That's not true at all. Survivors easily have all the control even at red ranks. If you don't feel that way it's because you're not a good survivor.
---
don't need the jumpsuit. just go shirtless myers
---
Don't forget 3 hit down Legion you could NEVER get away from.
---
Id like to welcome our newest killer that Nea i mean the entity has brought in
---
CALM SPIRIT
---
Right now i main zappy boi. But im willing to get every killer just to see who i best play as.
---
not even a full on rainbow
---
B b b but I like sacrificing people in bubbas basement
---
My thoughts exactly.
---
Coolest way to reply to salt
---
Yeah most of them would probably but someone like David Lynch would have a mental brake down.
---
You do you amigo just have fun
---
When the killer also hates sandbaggers
---
Thats a straight up nerf to the nerfed Version of mom
---
i enjoyed old Freddy more, but this one is also kinda fun
---
Imagine if Hopper is a new survivor
---
You get the same info by just seeing weither their Reverse Bear Traps light is white, yellow, or red.
---
It's not accumulative either, you literally just get a flat +300 BP anytime a Survivors Reverse Bear Trap's Death Timer passes either 25%, 50%, or 75%.
---
 Im not a pro here, only rank 14, but I don‚Äôt think scotch tape would be a good buff for legion. Gorilla tape would be a better choice. I don‚Äôt have legion though so I don‚Äôt know about the addons
---
Yea sorry bout that
---
  (Wall of text incoming but please read it all)
---
  Try to look at "camping" and "tunneling" as a last resort to get some kills. Not every killer is capable of quickly ending chases and hooking survivors. Especially if they are going against good survivors that knows what they are doing.
---
  Lets say every time you hook someone, they get unhooked before reaching to next phase. This means you have to hook every survivor 3 times to kill them. And this means 12 hooks in one match (In the worst case senario)
---
  If you go after every new survivor you see instead of finishing off the ones you already hooked previously, 12 hookes is exactly what you need. And provided survivors you are going up against are not complete morons and do generators while killer is busy, chances are you will hardly get one kill by the end of the match.
---
  Now lets try to "tunnel" survivors. You hook the survivor Number 1 first, they unhook him and Number 2 and 3 are trying to get your attention so Number 1 can heal. But you go after Number 1 again, hook him and same thing happens, one more time at Number 1 and boom, he is dead. 1 or 2 generators are done but they lost manpower, so it will be slower to do gens, heal and rescue survivors. Now you go after Number 2 and boom, now only 2 mans left and 1 or 2 generators needs to be done. Here, things get a lot better for the killer. When you hook Number 3 for the first time Number 4 have to make a choice: 1)He can risk his life to save Number 3, 2)He can try to finish gens and then try to save Number 3, 3)He can let Number 3 die on the hook and go for the hatch.
---
  Now, you see in this situation, smartest thing the Killer can do is "camp" the Number 3 so if Number 4 comes for him, he can get him quite easily and if Number 4 doesnt come, Killer would have secured the kill and depending on the situation either Number 4 escapes or he gets killed as well.
---
  As a result with this playstyle you only needed to get 6 hooks to completly take the control of the game and possibly 8 hooks to get a 4K
---
  Now I will be the first one to admit that "tunneling" and "camping" isnt always the best approach, but sometimes it is. Dont see this as something you deserve or not, this is just common sense, it is not personal.
---
  I actually made a flowchart about this, you can go over my profile and see for yourself. I think if this wall of text didnt make much sense, that will.
---
That's very true. I think his power should be the orbs.
---
It is not confirmed at all I for one would love a stranger things chapter but just because Netflix tweeted at bhvr involving stranger things doesn‚Äôt automatically mean dbd as bhvr has worked on mobile games and such that being said mcote did reply with a hi, so bhvr is working on something stranger things related but doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean dbd but I am hopefully
---
That is my point exactly. But all these rank 1 survivors out here trynna justify this games lack of animation to hitbox accuracy.
---
When I see two people left and like 3 gens left. I usually give the hatch to the person who's actually doing the gens rather than immersed claudette doing nothing but waiting for the other one to die
---
Bruh foh with that bullshitüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Dunno bout XBOX, but on PS4 the problem is reversed, and the survs are the ones that have to wait long. Maybe it's a similar case on xbox?
---
Honestly purple ranks I prefer. I rarely get camping killers and most of the teammates are find except for the ones that got to higher ranks by crouching everywhere
---
This change is ridiculously overpowered. Getting skillchecks to recover is just a better Unbreakable. It also gives a sprint burst if you get up.
---
If you don't get up, the killer picks you up, and gets stunned for 4/5/6 *ADDITIONAL* seconds on top of the stun for dropping you. That leaves them stunned for 6/7/8 seconds.
---
I don't know what drugs you're smoking if this change sounds *more* balanced than current DS but please let me have some.
---
Ugh...such a claudette
---
Or just makeup and paint lol.
---
Hahaha, that's fair enough. I understand where you're coming from, it is massively shoved in your face especially around release time. It is one of their flagship shows however so it must bring them in a fair bit of dollar. I mean the product placement in season 3 was ridiculous. They weren't subtle with it at all. Mind you it was like that in 80s/90s movies as well haha. I personally wouldn't mind any of the characters as a survivor, but cosmetics would be great as well.
---
Yeah that's what it is supposed to do. You have to take it off before you leave.
---
Well, considering Susie is a thing, I think we will never go off "*fuck* Legion" phase.
---
I was the killer when this happened and got a 4K to average the meg
---
Yeah I am green rank with killer and survivor. I have an understanding on both sides but people need to be fair too. If something is broken or could use improvement why not work in it?
---
Well either way, confirmed or not, I shall remain hopeful as well. :)
---
I know but having better ping still helps me a lot during chases.
---
Yes. 
---
You are. 
---
Fan art is fan art and how they want to draw them is how they want to draw them. The developers/BHVR team have even gone on record at one point to say that some of them have relationships. Quit raining on people's parade, man, if you don't like it, don't look.
---
I used to make dbd vids for fun, same thing happened to me so I made a meme vid on it. https://youtu.be/aKNwTWXllT0

Bing bong
---
This is where Ash's chainsaw hand would be uhh ..handy.
---
Wraith, Doctor and Leatherface
---
Wraith is worse than Clown tho
---
That‚Äôs so wholesome, I love this.
---
legion, ghostface, myers, trapper. half of killers are men with white masks.
---
It's hilarious to consider the icon of Horror could have been wearing Richard Nixon's mask if the past went a bit differently.
---
you miss the part where you go through extreme pain after
---
looked really difficult!
---
That's not actually the case I think. Ghostface in DBD has different outfit, only the mask is the same.
---
ik ur making a joke but just don‚Äôt tunnel and decisive isn‚Äôt an issue
---
Really? All i get are campers and tunnelers
---
You just have to burn yourself, no biggie.
---
Not really for me then. Normally I don't enjoy tv series, and I sometimes have problems even with the ones I like (haven't gotten myself to watch 2nd episode of Ash vs Evil Dead for over a week). Something about their overall lenght just turns me off most of the time with some exceptions (Slasher was awesome).
---
movement speed doesn‚Äôt sound unreasonable, if anything would just make m2 more meta
---
Original ones for sure
---
People do tend to do so as gratitude... For whatever practical reason. You can just pretend to accept it, nod at them swing at the item to show them that you're good or anything. I *love* these little interactions
---
I‚Äôm still trying to figure out how The Cannibal keeps that face mask on right, Mine keeps sliding around making it hard to see
---
Reddit wants everyone to be gay for some reason.
---
Yea, his video was done before the rework. I would put Billy, spirit, nurse, hag and huntress top 5 probably. My favorite to play as have been doctor, hag, pig and Freddy (both versions are great, too bad we'll never get to play v1 again)
---
There's almost no puninshment for DCing so people just abuse it.
---
And the wraiths one ain't even got a real human spine
---
I'm not going to lie sometimes when I'm overly compassionate to survivors that played hard I regret it. But when I see that Survivor drop his flashlight right before leaving it definitely made me happy to play the game non-toxic
---
[deleted]
---
Same.  I'll slug the first person who's actually participating just so I can find the garbage immersed survivor kill them and give the slug the hatch.  I can't stand survivors that say fuck you to their teamates and just hide until they can take a hatch.  Immersed teamates are their sides equivalent of facecampers imo.
---
There‚Äôs a leaked DBD theme song infused with stranger things. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs just rumors anymore.
---
Usually it's mostly 3 or 4 mans who DC, like the 4man I just got against who were pissed that I slugged even if I knew everyone was trying to rush for the unhook. Not many people DC outside of 3 and 4 mans or really salty survivors, and when it does happen theres only 1 or 2 reasons why they DC. The game itself isn't really competitive, so I don't have much of a problem anymore when it comes to DCers unless they just do it because they don't like how the killer plays.
---
Nothing more to explain ;) 4 survivors need to do 5 gens which are made insanely quick, most killers already struggle against good survivors even with instadowns, Plague showed that survivors don't even need to heal to completely destroy a killer.
---
Did you see season 3?
---
***Billy as survivor***
---
How‚Äôd you do the wraith mask, is it clay or something? I‚Äôve wanted to do wraith for a long time but couldn‚Äôt work out how to do the head without it being a heavy mess lol
---
That's interesting. I get like that sometimes, although it will happen later into a series for me. Then I'll take ages to finish the last few episodes, sometimes never at all. And this happens even when I'm really enjoying a series, so I know the feeling.
---
just to speed up the game a lil bit
---
I'm glad to know that it's a legit thing y'all do. It makes me happy Toronto to survivors like that. Especially because they were good enough to earn free passes from my clutches by their overall skill
---
Burn the offering but only use it on the last survivor/people you think deserve it.
---
How bout no
---
Does it really need to search that hard ;D
---
yesterday was the first time i saw spirit's hatch closing animation and i thought it was so cool (yeah its one of the few that isn't just a stomp)
---
Oh my god lmao
---
Well yeah, because if the killer commits to immediately hooking you and sacrifices their control over the area, you effectively don't have a fourth perk.
---
Shouldn't you already know?
---
It's all that stitching
---
And let me tell you as a killer man who literally just started playing Survivor last week I appreciate players like you.
---
Did you ever hear the tragedy of Nea the Wise?
---
I thought not. It's not a story the Killers would tell you. It's a Survivor legend. Nea was a Survivor, so powerful and so wise she could use the instaheals to create life... She had such a knowledge of the meta that she could even keep the ones she cared about from dying. The meta of the Survivor is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. She became so powerful... the only thing she was afraid of was getting sacrificed, which eventually, of course, she got. Unfortunately, she taught her baby Dwight everything she knew, then he left her on a hook.
---
Ironic. She could save others from death, but not herself.
---
you livin up to your flair my dude.
---
Trapper, I just hate this anxiety, also I tend to disarm every trap with my ankles.
---
we gay keep scrollin
---
I like the idea but the gun feel odd.
---
I get it, it just the holster missing
---
**Good**.
---
r/justneckbeardthings
---
Honestly it depends on how you're playing the 3 gen strat.  If you're purely defending and not playing to down a survivor until they get fed up with the 20 minute game and throw themselves at you those ones do feel pretty cheesy and lame.  3 gen is a legit strat but it's execution can range from totally acceptable to borderline game hostage-like such as when Docs play only to keep you all in madness with no offense.
---
I use bbq,whisperers,infectious fright and ruin but ruin gets cleansed in 1 min 90% of the time. Also fyi I am rank 5 right now.
---
Because gay
---
Hope you gave 'em a replay on how you got it
---
‚ÄúI think we‚Äôre doing a pretty good job so far‚Äù
---
Is that Chiraq üò≠
---
I had this happen on Xbox once with a Feng. But it would just shoot me across the map and wouldn't progress the heal. I kept using it to escape till she got wrecked.
---
Monitor and abuse 100%
---
Yeah no I try my best to down people but I can usually tell when they're purposely trying to run me to the opposite side of the map and I'll leave them I'm not going to throw the game chasing 1 person that isn't even on death hook. So it may take a while but I'm not purposely trying to prolong the game by leaving people.
---
What the Meg?!?
---
But huntress isn‚Äôt one of them
---
It‚Äôs not common, but It does happen more than you‚Äôd like to think
---
I feel ya
---
*Michael‚Äôs mask jowls vigorously shake like a bulldog‚Äôs while chasing Laurie.*
---
god i hate cosplays with fake human bones
---
For slightly less exhaustion times and slightly faster vaulting or slightly quieter gen repairs?
---
Being a fucking wall of a man is half the cosplay for MM
---
Even if you miss half of your shots though, she can still be brutal on most maps. Getting a hand for shots when survivor are locked in vaulting and pallet dropping animations gives some ez downs. It's surprising how often players do those things in line of sight.
---
Not yet buddy, entity wants a fifth
---
I wish they did more unique ones like the Spirit.
---
This guy gets it^
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Not
---
from a Trapper.
---
Eye don't know but it's becoming really difficult to cube up with new puns every t-eye-me
---
i have all of them. it keeps dailys and the game kind of diverse, keeps it from feeling  too repetitious. also different killers fit different play styles.
---
^this
---
So beastiality it is then!
---
Universe Brain:  Instinctively disconnecting from Reddit every time you see a Legion Post because four months ago Legion was abusable and you never forgive, forget, or think about context.
---
The jumpsuit is well over $100 though.
---
This is why I lurk in new
---
That's what it used to be, and it was probably the most badly designed and balanced perk in the game
---
.
---
Is it just me or every spirit main I encounter a anime pp? (Profile pic)
---
Yikes
---
no no no no no... sexy mike... mmmmmm
---
That's pretty grim is there not constant patches and new content for this are they not thinking about adding a punishment?
---
Turn the chat off. It isnt worth it
---
SURE IS üíÖ
---
actually would be great tho, would have to cycle gens. something like it follows. nerf tf outta main guy you play as
---
This. Is. EPIC!!!
---
You should start working for behavior, man.
---
It's pretty grim for the other survivors. I don't play this with anyone so it's usually me or me and one other when the other two DC.
---
not dead by daylight, but i have to mention Deacon from fallout 4
---
LMFAO THIS
---
#DcGang
---
All we need is Jason then we‚Äôve got all of them
---
A good swf pretty much ruins any semblance of balance in this game.
---
It's a joke when 4 geared out people out comms are placed against 1 person. 
---
Communication and coordination will always overpower any perk,killer,or item.
---
Fuck me gently with a chainsaw
---
I met a girl who was missing part of her arm. She had the best Full Metal Alchemist Cosplay
---
I'm on the second season too. In the same boat as you, started it but never carried on.
---
Why are you so mad about it? A little insecure aren't you?
---
Whats the streamers name?
---
Let me tell you, I brought borrowed time for that whole purpose and got saved everyone atleast twice, the moment I get hooked no one comes for me
---
If it's active it kills them. If it's just on the white deactivated mode they can leave with it on and survive
---
Even though Myers was under 6ft in the original film? That makes total sense...
---
I play on Xbox so I can‚Äôt relate
---
I mean the trick or treat studios masks look okay
---
Wraith looks like that zombie Morty cosplay
---
Alright breeder
---
Just recently I had a match where I was legion and these two Meg's brought in BPS but the other two DC'd on them. I didn't want them to DC on me too so I just let them start farming. 
---
But I do have one rule when doing a 4-man farmer. If any of them let someone die on hook (I usually only hook once) or bleed out, esp if it happened to a solo survivor, EVERYBODY dies, no exceptions. If I let you farm I let everyone farm
---
Yeah, mines from Night Owl.
---
No one:
---
The Piller men:
---
Official stats say 6ft4 so.....
---
We are legion mains
---
I guess that's true but the Death Timer Score Event doesn't tell you how far a Survivors Reverse Bear Trap Death Timer has progressed, just that it either reached 25%, 50%, or 75%. You actually get more info from just seeing the light indicator.
---
I did, personally didn‚Äôt like billy though. Which is why I want hopper or Joyce
---
I barely see 2 or more DCs when I play survivor.
---
Wish I found that two years ago.
---
You combat toxicity with toxicity. Only thing you can do.
---
Seriously just had another match. It lasted 25mins cause the killer was slugging the last two guys over and over but couldnt find both.  
---
Last 3 gens were stupidly near together. Like 80 feet to each other and killer just patrolled in the middle of them. there was no way we could do the last gen! It was gg.  
---
So I showed the other guy where the hatch is and then went onto doing one gen and if I get detected just take the killer with me and get him as away from the gens as possible. I ended on the other side of the map and got hooked. The guy got detected with BBQ cause he was not smart enough to go into a locker.  
---
Killer went for him and hit him once. He then decided to go all the way back to me. Meanwhile I tried to unhook me myself 3 times and was just about to let go when I saw he was trying to unhook me. So I let him for the points otherwise he would have been downed and the game would be over.  
---
I escaped and managed to loose the killer. He got downed but not hooked (It would have been his final hook). And now the whole process began from start.  
---
As I didnt want to spent any more minute in the game, he was nearly bleeded out \~10%. I just waited 20 seconds and took the hatch.  
---
In the after chat killer and survivor were again complaining how they knew I was taking the hatch and being selfish. My toolbox and being a claudette gave it away and all other sort.
---
Mkey
---
I‚Äôm probably going to get a new one one thing that annoys me is you have to be a really high level to actually switch his weapons
---
body blocking is a pretty bad strategy. Simply hit those survivors, then drop whoever u were carrying, and slug them all. ez
---
If you really suck and really can't deal with it, equip mad grit.
---
Give him the thong coward
---
Body blocking is not toxic, neither is camping. Body blocking has counters, just swing and hit them. If they do not move and you down them that is on the survivors.
---
Um so, I've never made anything like this before. Sorry if it's terrible! if you have any criticism I don't mind, just keep it light plss. It's my first time...u//u
---
But then I don't enjoy it when it gets to that point. Camping takes the fun out of the game for me. It's only momentarily enjoyable to watch the toxic players struggling on a hook.
---
If they‚Äôre swarming you when you pick people up just think of it as free hits. And as for the looping it‚Äôs like the one thing survivors can do in a chase to survive. Spend some time playing survivor and killer in equal measure and you‚Äôll start sympathizing with both.
---
At least killers check on generators and you have a risk of failing skill checks and notifying the killer where you are.
---
Perhaps because we are all gay and/or queer? I mean, I doubt a bunch of 100% straight ppl would have such... gay demands lol. 
---
Can we get Ru as a killer? It would be iconic, hunty.
---
The most concerning noise that makes me think it's a new character are pages turning and twinkling maybe a storybook killer or some 4th wall JoJo breaking killer
---
Ur free to. I just wanted to do it quick
---
What points did you get for this
---
Thanks man :D
---
Appreciate it!
---
I feel this personally and it hurts especially when if you weren‚Äôt there they‚Äôd all be dead
---
I don't understand how people are getting salty about this post.  This was never a brag post and I'm not "sucking my dick".  This was me backing up my point about tunneling being detrimental to the killer with an in game example.  Looping isn't difficult and it's very common for many of your opponents to be more than capable of handling themselves in a chase.  I see killers throw away games doing it so often.  You'll possibly get that kill against them but if the other survivors aren't braindead they'll be pounding out gens during your chases.
---
I can deal with it most of the time on a higher level killer, but when I'm on the early levels of a new killer it becomes a pain in the ass. I hit them but they don't move, and by that point the survivor I'm holding has pretty much wiggled free and they all fuck off on the Teabag Train
---
Ok sweaty
---
19.7k came out to about 60k with BBQ and BPS
---
Sounds like a black pip?
---
I‚Äôm just a prophet; the true lord of darkness who came up with it is /u/thecowrus
---
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED!!!
---
True so very true.. Feels like im riding in my old school chevy lol
---
 No, you are doing the objective. But if you all huddle together, I'm going to get a free puke on everyone. It's more efficient (and safe) to split up.
---
meme review
---
*Ayayaya intensifies*
---
Wait thats illegal
---
He‚Äôs off to a better place now
---
Any survivor would be an easy cosplay imo.
---
Nice doodles!
---
They look like they're reacting to the other 3 Survivors DC'ing. (or maybe that's just me projecting?)
---
I said you'll lose against good survivors and you said you never have that problem.
---
Personally, I like both. But I won‚Äôt lie, it‚Äôs super cool that I have an option to play my favorite horror icon, Freddy Krueger. I also like the fact that they got Bruce Campbell for Ash. I guess it depends on the day, but ultimately, I think I prefer unlicensed survivors and licensed killers.
---
Camping and tunnelling prevents a player from fully playing the game. 
---
There's nothing stopping you to drop the survivor and not those body blockers. Your game time is not cut short either by another player. See the difference?
---
I for one think seeing Myers shirtless would be utterly hilarious.
---
We should be getting the new chapter in the first week or so of september, right?  
---
When do these things usually get announced?  A week before?
---
This better not awaken anything in me.
---
gender is fluid üòé
---
Thanks! Idk maybe I just posted at a bad time or it doesn't look like myers to some people, I don't understand what most of the comments are getting at.
---
Ok so i dont get it. How do so many people think the killers are cute or "hot?" I can see something like they're cool but not either of those. Please explain?
---
Wait is this on pc? :D i think that was my friend not sure cuz cropped names tho
---
Well shit I didn't know he had a skin like that.
---
Oh, I definitely agree that it would be rare (and honestly, I think my solution is a bit ugly and thrown together: If either of us gave it much more thought I'm sure we'd think of an even better solution), but I think the devs in general want to avoid as many unwanted information as possible with powers that only work when outside of the terror radius.
---
There is no 100% guaranteed way to do this even if it isn't a SWF comp. Best bet would have been just downing as many as you can and slugging them while that person struggled on hook.
---
Go up behind the guy trying to unhook your target and press r2 or w/e the attack button is on pc tho I would just completely ignore the toxic teabagged like completely don't even chase him pay him no attention at all cause that's basically what he wants attention
---
Probably because he is level one.
---
Nah, the only killer that can camp without any way to counter is leatherface
---
You‚Äôre still supposed to start with all three teachables
---
So the fact that he killed all 4 despite the thumbs down means he didnt do what he was supposed to? Now the rank progress makes sense!
---
I mean you don't need it because giving the survivors that info then the survivors know who the killer is. Or and I'm just spit balling here maybe the new chapter has a perk to give the first one so the killer knows when he can't be detected and it shows for how long
---
Indeed
---
people are into different things, man.
---
With wraith specifically, I believe that canonically he is reluctant to kill and very shy, but the entity makes him/brings out the murderer in him. I think it‚Äôs part of why his power is invisibility. So people think he‚Äôs cute for being shy and tilting his head like a confused puppy or something.
---
Otherwise, it‚Äôs not too hard to appreciate good looks/body even behind some scars/blood/missing bits etc.
---
Oh, and drawing chibi versions of the killers makes them much cuter!
---
an actually good idea
---
I just barely realized that. Good point.
---
All the Killer mains crying about survivors being toxic even though killers are way worse
---
Only his perks
---
I have never seen something more genuinely funny and yet, so unbelievably awful are your comment history. It should be framed in a museum
---
My suggestion is just "after a certain amount of time passes while a single gen remains, a key will spawn in the basement's chest" but yeah i think i mostly spoke out of salt but it's still annoying as hell.

And then she disconnected later.
---
I feel like Legion would be one of the MOST done cosplays because of how easy it is
---
Wait so you want to get rid of a good anti-tunneling perk for this wildly OP combination. 
---
The ability to quickly get back up in a matter of seconds. And get a sprint burst. That also has the option to build up struggle progress on the ground, with a massive stun if you escape the killer's shoulder?
---
What about this seems more fair than current DS. By changing it, you make it *EASIER* to tunnel because your new perk idea does nothing against tunnelers. You also make it impossible to slug as killer because the survivor will guarantee have this insane perk.
---
WHY ISN'T SHE  N A K E D?
---
Everything about this idea is just... no. Also if a survivor leads the killer back to the 4th survivor, you must not be playing with very good survivors.  And why did you flair this as "BHVR official" when it clearly is not.

I actually prefer STBFL over PWYF because I find having kill pressure more valuable than temporary movement speed. Especially since I like to run Windstorm addons.
---
That would completely make the endgame collapse pointless. If you were guaranteed a key survivors would just stay in game for the key and get a free escape.
---
I usually always give the last guy hatch, unless he wiggles. You wiggle you die.

I've never once had this happen or even heard of it

True indeed. The game shouldn't reward you with an escape for failing objectives

Finally, at the end of the game there was no player, it was a 3vs1 game
---
Are you sure it's uncommon?
---
I think the comment was sarcasm. Haha.
---
Ok retard
---
It was 3 hits not 4. But if you make it 5 hits would prob make it a little more fair cause you would have had to get away and heal at least 1 time but ya honestly they just need to rework it from ground up

What's accurate about someone making an accusation about NOED when there isn't one, and then admitting that they don't even know what they're facing?

---
- End Game Collapse is now a thing. Killers can no longer grab Survivors out of the Hatch Animation, but they *can* close the hatch if they get to it first, powering the exit gates and starting the Collapse. The Collapse lasts two-three minutes (I forget which) after which any Survivor still in the game is instantly sacrificed and dies. If a Survivor is on the Hook or Downed, the timer is slowed to half speed.
---
- Plague is a Killer that infects people giving them Broken status, which can be healed at one of her healing stations. She can drink from her used healing station to get a ranged attack than can down people.
---
- Ghostface is the newest Killer, and he's basically a cross between Pig (Can crouch and kill his terror radius) and Myers (Can stalk individuals survivors to individually expose them). 
---
- Ash Williams from Evil Dead fame has been added to the game. He came out with Mettle of Man, which was frankly broken, and has since been nerfed to the ground. Unless you want to actually play as him, he's entirely skippable. (And that hurts to say).
---
- Something called the Archive is coming out soon, somehow this is supposed to lessen the grind.
---
- Dedicated Servers and a Switch port are coming out sometime around the end of the month.
---
- Pig's Hats no longer pop a Survivor if they try to leave unless a gen was completed and they were turned on. Any Hat not used prior to the last gen being completed is completely wasted.
---
- Bunch of perk nerfs and buffs. Too many to list for a years time.
