Pretty much.
---
---
---
Im PRETTY SURE its a nerf that implies rather than maintaining the speed boost for the entirety of the granted period, it drops off in speed the longer you travel to hit somebody. 
---

---
So to my understanding youre the fastest when you hit someone the second you come out, but if youre trying to hit someone further away, it will take you (lets say) 2 seconds to reach them, you wont have the same speed as you did when initially exiting, making it less likely to hit them

---
And now that the developers do not have to worry about Balanced Landing, they can keep the vertical creativity in the game and change maps accordingly. I do not see the issue here.
---
It's hard to make it work. Maybe against some killers that don't like to break pallets? Like Spirit rarely breaks pallets, Nurse never gave a shit about them. But you are better off running literally any meta perk to help you against those two. And the only pallets the majority of killers will avoid breaking are the unsafe ones, but they are well, unsafe. (and even then, they will break them if they down someone nearby)
---
I doubt it will be ever good for solo survivors. I could see SWF meme around with it, but I doubt it will work too well. There is a certain type of killers that will never break a pallet if they see someone run away immediately, so against them it will be good? To me at least it seems like it's one of those perks that seems good at first glance, but when you realize most killers break pallets immediately, it's pointless.
---
Calling this right now - survivor mains will cry so loud on Oni, since if you master him he is a beast, and he will get nerfed into legion level. 
---
This guy has literally everything survivor main can cry about.
---
I looked it up but its not on xbox. Looks amazing though
---
Congrats!!
---
Well, when I do play survivor, I'm just good enough at hiding to survive but terrible at escaping and looping. That combo means that I often wind up being caught at the exit gate as the 4th guy. Anecdotal evidence, I know, but it surprisingly seems to happen to me fairly often. I'm rank 15, which could explain some of it.
---
No way to buff him without making him bullshit. He already excels in chases, what else would you suggest? Can’t have him teleport across the map and shit
---
In her lore in game and on the wiki
---
The killer not breaking god pallet deserves to not get any kills
---
Hey you have an Instagram notification
---
I can already see another person slowly hating The Oni
---
I agree
---
Good
---
New survivor: Jesus
---
It’s the same as the other shorter killers, (the pig, the nightmare, the legion, etc)
---
Fucking poggers bruh holy shit. yessss
---
Cause I don't like DS... I am a soft killer ok? Stop bullying me
---
Got Beast of Prey right! Who knew?
---
Exactly.
---
Could also be useful to take it into a KYF on a new map to see the stuff faster
---
Weeping angels confirmed for next chapter
---
Ah so just give up till next rank reset
---
Wow wow wow
---
[hope this helps](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyrmhp/new_vault_animation_for_spirit/)
---
Put your PS4 in a different spot. Or just hide it with something that buys you enough time to pull him off if he tries to mess with it. Pretend he's a pesky survivor going for a sabo and put him on a hook until it's time for him to leave.
---
I'm sad that I was right, I knew this would be a yikes shrine
---
Reverse the order and it’s accurate
---
Dead Harding for distance was always better than BL. People would use DH+BL to be able to dead hard for distance while still being able to loop around drop down points but solo DH was always better than solo BL.
---
Can we expect you back for this chapter? ;)
---
...And she can be as toxic as Belladonna
---
People who dc all the time are dickheads and weve had to deal with them dcing for fucking nothing just because they felt that the killer tunnelled them when there were 2 hooks in between their hooks. Blame the dickheads who dc when first caught and fuck over their team.
---
Any mori on Steve is the saddest thing to see
---
It's all good. See you in the basement ;)
---
I purposely took forever on that one cause F wasting good pallets.
---
The entity said it was my turn on the xbox
---
That's the risk of going into a game with a team in most any games, tbh. Especially PvP ones. You get one potato and your team can be sunk from there.
---
Thats me baby.
---
Haha thanks I’ll try that
---
whats the shrine of secrets rn
---
the worst part to be honest is he's too big for certain spaces on haddonfield.  Seriously, i was trying to get past a pallet to one of the closet garages by a cop car and i was literally too big to enter, same with doors unless I'm in Yamaoka's Wrath.  Seems to be a glaring problem.
---
u/OsukaTheOracleTurret is this secretly a preview for the new chapter?
---
Is that the amazing bulk
---
Could any means necessary become meta? Being able to reset pallets? Now we can actually do what the loading screens want us to do
---
You’re not really playing if you’re sitting on the ground are you? Moron
---
Cant tell if thats a pun or not
---
Lmao, look at all the floating accessories. Claudette apparently wears a wig
---
It makes haddonfield easy mode. I feel so bad whenever I get that map as survivor and am running BL. If the stagger reduction was a separate perk that wasn't even exhaustion I could see it being fine. As it is now, with no map reworks, it's way too strong on a few maps.
---
Look whos shittin in the tall grass!
---
Man, and we all thought it was daddy yamaoka
---
I don't think she's considered best though
---
Just run nemesis and now you have OP old legion.
---
enjoy facing ruin &amp; bbq every game as survivor
---
enjoy facing swf every game as killer
---
F
---
To expand, there are 5 rarities for perks (common, uncommon, rare, very rare and ultra rare), like everything else. But for some reason they only ever show as three colours. So both common and uncommon will appear as uncommon, and very rare and ultra rare both appear as very rare.
---
There is unbalanced crap every survivor equips too
---
Oh my lorde 
---
Beautiful
---
I know, id rather have [Perk nobody would agree with] nerfed.
---
Really? I think it looks great. Her standing on the top of the window for a half second looks creepy as fuck
---
What an absolute unit
---
Nope: nurse/billy have always been fun to play as, and also higher skillcap than all the other killers. Spirit and Freddy are way easier but still quite fun to play, ghostface with a stalk heavy playstyle (not the tru3talent way of playing him, I think that’s horribly boring), Myers, Huntress, all of these killers are a lot of fun to play as. The only killers I hate playing as are like: wraith and clown.
---
Wait are the eyes red in the p3 or is it only like that cuz of the blood fury effect
---
I really wanted to but like not all people are "intellectuals" like others and I'm pretty sure they wouldn't want to see the other version.
---
Thanks! Thanks! Thanks!
---
Ruin can easily be gone within the first minute of the match. Not only that but sometimes it doesn’t even make much difference
---
At least then they have the option of being picked up and then playing normally later. If they keep suiciding that's on them.
---
Still haven't seen a good reason why I'm an asshole for wanting to see karma hit people who ruin games.
---
What program do you use?
---
That is interesting ! Are you sure about that ? First time I read about it I thought this is only about the hemorrhage effect cause it is mentioned after it and not at the end of the perk description. Have you seen it actually tested ?
---
Ooh yeah that would be pretty cool!
---
No feedback in chase against Spirit was really engaging gameplay experience for survivor.  
---
The only reason you play survivor is to engage in chase with the killer because otherwise you’d rather just play killer and actually have fun.
---
Most streamer/YouTubers I've watched play Oni say that his dash is easier than Billy's and his Insta down doesn't need to be fully charged to proc. You can almost tap the button and it still works. You only use the wind up to lunge. Don't know why you're complaining. He's definitely on the stronger side of killers with his high lethality and mobility.
---
 I don’t have access to PTB (console pleb) could anybody tell me how big of an impact the balanced landing nerf feels? In my head it’s pretty major as it’ll essentially stop people using it for infinite’s after the first use!
---
First gyaru dbd survivor. Now for the sea hag gyaru cosmetic.....
---
The counterplay is break the chase, which is admittedly difficult with legion, but not impossible. The amount of time that Legion has to commit to downing someone purely by waiting for bloodlust is pretty great, so that gives the team time to do gens, heal, spread out. Hence why I said I dont think its broken, but probably not super fun to play against.
---
I feel like someone’s gonna take this, add a body of someone, and replace Jeff with Jesus
---
You should ask them to send pictures of the cat weekly so you know it’s healthy. Or maybe it might sound weird but ask them to FaceTime the cat so you can see it
---
Is there something going on with moonwalking?  i've literally never seen so many people doing it and it's so smooth
---
I only teabag killers that camp or tunnel in hopes that they get triggered and chase me.
---
Not end game campers though.
---
what on earth are you talking about 360s for? You sound like a perma stuck on yellow ranks gamer. 360s are irrelevant.
---
Off topic from the post however i need to know so tell us.
---
she heard about what BHVR is doing to Balanced Landing
---
You're a furry.
---
a good killer with ruin and bbq may be tough, but far more fun to face than the usual low ranks that camp, tunnel and NOED
---
Sorry, Frank. But Oni might be my main!
---
Its the same in every game, i will BM if a killer does somthing like camp (heavily), tunnel (heavily), or brings some sort of OP addon or offering.
---
There is no point in complaining about it, Killers and survivors do it plenty to the point it just doesnt do anything to me anymore. Yea it sucks, but what honestly. nothing feels better then stomping a killer that has been tunneling you all game or destorying a team of survivors that have been little shits.
---
I think an easy fix is to just get rid of teachable perks.
---
I waited for this
---
Looks neat
---
Just waiting for everyone to keep saying one of the perks is too OP and they need to nerf it
---
So can Myers. His ability is still limited
---
I’m conflicted on this. I don’t think they should drop blood for Oni. They are one hit anyways it just seems silly they drip blood.
---
No ranking. Shut up
---
 Sis looks like the female version of horwang from tekken
---
“Knock Knock”
---
I haven't played For Honor in ages, I'm having flashbacks
---
That would destroy the game imo
---
This happens to me every other trap I place. I keep wasting time because the trap decides to immediately snap on my foot. I HAVE EVEN TESTED NOT PRESSING A BUTTON, AND IT STILL SNAPS!
---
&gt;rank 8 survivor and rank 12 killer in about a week. 
---
Am I that bad? I've been playing like a month and I'm only rank 15 in each. What's your total play time?
---
Yes the game is unbalanced which is why most killers need Ruin to even stand a chance against good survivors.
---
Finally a survivor with the muscle strength to lift a  pallet. David was way to weak
---
I’m rank 15 and I’m kinda getting the hang of everything. I still suck at looping and all that. But other then that, I’m getting better. I’ve only ever been escorted to the hatch once. Pretty much every round, it’s a tunneling killer and incompetent survivors. I’m not nearly as lucky as you.
---
Myers builds up to tier 3 after which his basic attacks instadown. This is different from Billy as he has more control and it is harder to dodge a lunge than it is a chainsaw.
---
The Oni builds up his instant down by playing the game normally, after which he has an attack that is only slightly slower than a basic attack that is also harder to dodge than a chainsaw.
---
Legion nerfs are a wonderful reminder that BHVR has a long way to go.
---
Dropping blood has a set timing and actions to drop it so no mither probably won't help ever
---
45 mins til reset
---
i'll take camping over these builds i see game after game after game.
---
Whoa! Wtf lol? Never seen that...
---
New perk with the new chapter
---
Dunno I had a break in happen when I was younger so home invaders kinda freak me out
---
How?
---
Those loops are still insanely strong and waste a shit ton of time without BL. I use them all the time and I havent ran BL in awhile.
---
this is mad
---
Its a waste to use both since they consume the medkit once used but idk which one it uses since the change
---
like 60 hours
---
Unless it applies both affects at the same time it won't work. Using one depletes the med kit. Never tried to see if they both take effect though.
---
*spirit stun noises*
---
Why the fuck does MoM cost 2700?
---
Looks badass!
---
Eh, it doesn’t look that great, but it’s better than her just standing there and poofing into existence on the other side. I can run a killer around shack easily, but spirits brain fuck me if they ever take the vault, just because I don’t know if they’re phasing, standing there, or they’re actually vaulting.
---
Mettle of Man is only on the shrine because it got nerfed.
---
I have 9000 shards, why would you do It?
---
I guess it’s still considered to be from a recent DLC
---
That moment you have to decide between playing as Waldo dwight and Ace with pink pants pornstache and animal print shirt........
---
I was thinking about God pallet but I don't think there's ever been a case of it not getting kicked
---
The agent gives me Endurance if hit while its active, and the syringe heals after a short time. So, i would be healed and cant be downed during that time
---
No when ptb hits it's always two weeks after .
---
#ONE OF US
---
Pretty sure it doesn't work on live either.
---
She’s smiling
---
When its a perks first time on the shrine it costs 2,700 shards. It gives 250k bloodpoints instead of 150k if you already have the perk.
---
honestly shook its in there, wp.
---
Because then you’re pigeonholed into running the same perks every game. Not to mention some killers have 3 literal trash perks.
---
2700 because it’s the first time being on SoS. It was the same with furtive chase a few weeks ago.
---
Console has no Dedicated Servers yet
---
Dementor’s and Voldemort’s mori would be obvious
---
It literally got buffed in the PTB prot procs are pretty reliable now.
---
Elderly Black Drag Drax
---
just slap some phase effects on this and it would be ok
---
My new background. Amazing.
---
Gonna main her just for those nails, sorry nea :/
---
\*SCREAMING CHARGE\*
---
It's really not...
---
Rank 20 mindgaming
---
It's chosen randomly. Plus they just buffed protection hits on the PTR, so it's way better now.
---
Its the same key to use them, so im assuming it would work? like just both get used?
---
Nice! Hopefully one of many!
---
For me personally, and I think for a lot of people, working towards getting teachable perks is one of the things that keeps me playing for as long as I do, and there's simply perks I like to run together on certain killers. 
---
As for survivors, I usually only play as Kate, I would despise only being able to use her three teachable perks, which although aren't horrible are definitely not the most fun perks to run.
---
Besides, both ruin and bbq are easy to counter, and are far from the least fun perks to go against, at least in my opinion.
---
And Freddy
---
Glad to know all of these comments are on the same page
---
I seriously dont know how they're gonna come up with new ideas for future killers and perks, like, we're almost 4 years in and we have 18 killers, imagine the game in the next 5 years or less lol
---
Beast of Prey isn’t good on anyone.
---
Nice job
---
iirc Monto brought up similar points in his Oni video today. The Plague comparisons that is.
---
well seeing the same perks in every game isn't much fun either. when i see ruin for the 8 game in a row i just want to d/c cause it's not fun over and over and over.
---
Seems it's not just Spirit because when I played Ghostface on the institute map I kept easily downing them as they couldn't track me due to nightshroud plus the Ebony and on that ups the meter for stalking while leaning which is very strong in that map.
---
No more than 2 minutes in 2 survivors DC after I down them and then another DC after that.
---
2 game's in a row what the hell?
---
Anyone who thinks Demo is anything like Hag has obviously not played either very much. 
---
Hag is slow and not very mobile. She needs to stay in one area of the map to be successful. Demo is one of the most mobile killers in the game and one of the few who can do well on big maps.
---
Demo is definitely not worse than Hag either. I'd hesitate to even say he's worse than Huntress. He's pretty powerful.
---
You could not be more wrong about the Legion changes.
---
Sloppy Butcher only applies on basic attacks. It doesn't apply on hatchets, chainsaws, demo lunge, etc. Please don't spread misinformation.
---
Removing Feral Frenzy as a basic attack means Legion can't run anti heal builds anymore, which was easily his best. People say "oh well just down them with your basic attack after frenzy." But the WHOLE POINT of Legions power is to hit everyone, then chase one person. Sloppy Butcher not hitting multiple targets per Feral Frenzy makes it useless.
---
The best legion build is now going back to the gimmick of letting the timer run out. This time with Beast of Prey's new effect instead of moonwalking.
---
It's called a Dwight Bulb
---
The satisfaction of predicting a terrible shrine is quickly smothered by the angst of having a terrible shrine :c
---
I like to think they are feathers
---
It reminds me of a fit Shugoki from For Honor.
---
It's ok. Survivors must now have skill in Chase's on more maps. You'll adjust. I already have, cuz I use Sprint Burst.
---
Kate is love. Kate is life.
---
Mrs Voorhees would be the ultimate win for a DBD killer. Jason is baby trapper.
---
Yup I'm just that bad lol
---
The problem with what you're suggesting is that the perk still gets to do two things and no other exhaustion perk does that.  
---
Sprint Burst: burst of speed for a few seconds  
---
Lithe: speed burst out of vault  
---
Dead Hard: Get out of jail free  
---
Head On: be a wholesome memer  
---
Then you have current Balanced Landing, which is ironically the least balanced of them all. You get a speed burst from a jump, and then when you're exhausted you still get the passive buff of no stagger when landing. It's too strong and it makes certain structures (or entire maps like Handdonfield) a nightmare to deal with.  
---
It doesn't need to do anything else than "speed burst after jumping". This change brings it on par with all the other exhaustion perks.
---
But the difference is that looping actually takes skill that is more difficult to learn and get use to. Whereas tunneling and camping aren’t skillful.

---
I honestly don't think so.  
---
It has quite a long cooldown, and it requires the killer to leave the pallet.  
---
The only way that I can see this perk being ruin efficiently is with a 4-man SWF. It'll certainly be rather awful for solo play.
---
Totally agree, was gonna say this myself
---
Well looking at the description, it’s based off early game. If you’re right in the middle I don’t think it’s an issue.
---
[removed]
---
Didn’t they only nerf the passive ability of stagger when you were exhausted?
---
Vibe check... overpowered much?
---
And? Sloppy doesn't proc on feral hits now, so there is little reason to run a weak perk like Thanatophobia without Sloppy.
---
Jolly good show jolly good show
---
It lasts 60 seconds. You can stand still for 60 seconds before crows show up. Maybe hide in a locker or behind a rock for that time? You don’t even have to move, just don’t get caught. 
---
Meanwhile, Xbox players bee line for the killer to get out of the game when someone breaks the totem
---
Oh man i imagine her with a heavy osaka dialect
---
I wish you literally could just drop a survivor into a hatch
---
When you´ve seen one Oni Character you´ve seen them all, basicly
---
Run shadow dance with windstorm, and for perks go thanataphobia, dying light, pop goes the weasel and ruin
---
bruh, if I've hooked you twice and see you and someone i haven't touchedrunning passed, why wouldn't i chase you? its called playing with your brain. camping i understand, but tunneling is called strategy
---
Billy's still a stronger killer he doesnt need to farm a massive power bar to use his 215% movespeed and one shot down...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmqgp7xFU0w](Get in on the meme.)
---
“Why does everyone hate survivor mains?”
---
RISE
---
I would put here behind Billy and Ghost face. But I see you're point, I hate hank's.
---
How is this nsfw
---
I’m just seeing mostly on reddit all the flat comparisons of hillbilly and billy only, personally at first I felt it was more of Myers hillbilly hybrid but I’ve since shifted to a more plague styled view of it
---
Wait so how many insta down killers are healthy? And being able to see auras constantly because of the onis add on is perfectly healthy? Like wut
---
And stealth killers?Like lets look at what killers this map is good for,bad for and ok for.
---
Trapper:His traps are visible,so #badmap.
---
Wraith:You cannot see him soming due to walls,so #goodmap.
---
Billy:Go watch araon plays video that shows many 1 shot potential on this map.#okmap.
---
Nurse:she cannot see survivors,so #badmap.
---
Myres:cannot see him coming,so #goodmap.
---
Hag:trap narrow paths,I played her on this map and she is good on this map:#goodmap
---
Doctor:Small map so easy to get madness,so #goodmap.
---
Huntress:Cannot snipe,so #badmap.
---
Cannibal:Corners make it hard,so #bad map.
---
Freddy:He can abuse better his small terror radius due to walls,so#good map.
---
Pig:You cannot see her coming due to walls,so #goodmap
---
Clown:can use bottles to get escapes rouths cut of,so #goodmap.
---
Spirit:She is not map relient,so I would say #okmap
---
Legion:Lots of pallets to cancel his power so #badmap
---
Plague:Due to turning walls,it can be hard to puke.#Bad map.
---
Demogorgon:His shred can deal with some loops and portals are hard to [see.At](https://see.At) least #okmap
---
Ghostface:Cannot see him coming due to walls,so #good map
---
Conclusion:
---
\-6 bad
---
\-3 ok
---
\-8 goods.
---
So most killers will benefit from that map,one more point that proves that this map is killer favored.
---
its a multihit, intentional, he needs to be fully charged~ and right on top of you to do it though, a max range hit wont do it.
---
Most killers run ruin because if they don't 3 gens will have popped in the first 80-90 seconds of the game, at least if they're playing against somewhat decent survivors. I know a lot of people run BBQ primarily for the bloodpoints, but it's also easily one of, if not the best, tracking perk. But tbf you can say the same thing about survivors who run adrenaline, DS, dead hard, BT and whichever meta perks there are.
---
Also he charges his power for hitting unhooked survivor with regular attack
---
I relapsed recently, yes UwU
---
I literally play 5 different killers at rank 1, a large reason of that is because you can mix up different perks to the suit the killer that you’re playing. Making perks locked to certain characters just encourages people to play Hag every game for Ruin, or Leatherface every game for BBQ. 
---
I get that you’re new to the game so you think Ruin is OP, but it’s really not. Plus to you’re only rank 12 killer. Get to rank 1 with Wraith using only his 3 perks and then we’ll talk lol.
---
but this is a horror game so he should at least have one eye scratched out or something
---
It's not nice to BM in general unless they deserve it. Why get even tilted on teabagging? I find it funny how people get offended easily with taunts. It is to annoy the opponent and to make them misplay. It is commonly used in fighting games even without an actual taunt. It's when a player is styin' on another and it asserts pressure to the opponent when the reads are so good. It is BM to taunt at the end of the match, everyone knows who escaped and whatnot, but why bother getting tilted in a game? That is why they do it because they want to argue in post chat. Just say GG WP and leave.
---
A lot of people consider hag top tier actually, if played well and used to their full extent, most killer can be devastating. It's just that some of them have a higher skill floor/ceiling than others
---
T-Tier\*
---
Yeah because all the killer mains will throw temper tantrums if the survivors get a good perk that can actually balance the game out. Ergo why literally anytime killers struggle even slightly the want a perk,add on or item nerfed
---
Plsdontstackplsdontstackplsdontstackplsdontstack
---
the only time I'll camp a hook is during the end game collapse because its boring and I'm not about to let you escape. i want my points i would likely lose otherwise. and even then i get flamed as a camper
---
WOOOO
---
I love this new feature. I reckon it’s a good design for survivors who rage quit when meeting certain killers. Iridescent hatchet huntresses for example will at least get the chance to play a game for once.
---
all those perks just to get smacked with NOED and abandoned
---
Are we going to be able to buy her with shards?
---
Someone posted this like, an hour after you
---
Got i can’t wait for the interaction between these two
---
I think your take on it is interesting! However, for me, I often try to get myself in chases, and the speed boost is vital for those really close call swings that I’ve managed to escape from. I’m sad that it’s getting nerfed, but I think I’d rather keep the speed boost over the stagger reduction, but thats just me :)
---
Kowaii schoolgirl is level ONE??
---
I assume it's just for PTB. I'm pretty sure they did the same for Jane, who I'm pretty sure had like Feng's voice or something on PTB.
---
Do you know how scary it's gonna be trying to sneak around and see this fucking BEHEMOTH stalking you?
---
Buggy revealing mechanic not working and gets down even though you’re looking at him
---
Ok, yes, I understand that. That makes sense. But the thing that pisses me off is when a killer will focus solely on that one survivor. They could be healed and harder to get to and the killer would just walk past an injured survivor that is easy to grab. That’s not skillful, that’s just being toxic. What you’re saying, I definitely understand.
---
Yeah, I thought she'd just sort of phase through the wall in pieces.  Like first her torso+leg would just instantly appear on the other side of the window in a frozen state while leaving her arms+elbow bit+leg on the starting side of the window, then one by one the leftover pieces would snap forward into position and once all of them had met back up with her she'd be able to move freely again.  That way she has an easily telegraphed vault animation allowing survivors proper counter-play while also being unique and creepy as fuck.
---
Who has ever said that lmao
---
I think you can also activate it by taking a drop on the basement stairs
---
neat, blood orbs come out every time you do something that causes bleeding? the blood orbs thing reminds me of hack n slash games like devil may cry, god of war, etc. as if the killer is from a hack n slash game. but it sounds like it would be more fun to pick them up by touching them instead of holding a button to collect them all
---
Aw geez the fabled t tier
---
Bullshit aa always
---
quick description of Oni's power
---
* you collect floating blood in the air from injured survivors
---
* once you collect enough you can activate bloody fury  (or you can call it demon mode if that is easier for you since it unlocks the named demon abilities)
---
   * Demon Strike- the bam-bam meme. One-hit downs survivors
---
   * Demon Rush- billy dash + bam-bam meme. Run really fast like Billy and one-hit downs
---
both sides are toxic
---
I may be wrong, but isn't he suggesting that it should be made not an exhaustion perk, since the speed boost is removed? I think he wants it to be a normal perk.
---
He means like the name of the custom perk icon pack. I couldn't tell him because I'm on console and we don't have those.
---
at this point im wondering less "should i try a different exhaustion perk" bad more "do i even want to continue playing this fucking game?"
---
Don’t bring Coco Montrese into this.
---
but no more save the best for last &gt;:(
---
I mean.... i would say yes personally.
---
Let's face it. Hype aside, he sounds like another meh dash/charging killer to be honest. Everyone will overhype then a few weeks after release no one will play him. Just like the Demogorgon.
---
The killers that I think benefit from this the most are Plague and Legion, maybe to a lesser extent Hag. If you're playing a killer that can spread a lot of pain around really quickly then this is a perk that's going to put even more of a hamper on the survivors.
---
I see this being used in a very general pressure sense, but you're only going to get that sweet reward IF 1) you  actually hit/injure survivors 2) you're able to keep survivors off gens and snowball downs/hooks.
---
it's not worth it
---
in the scenario you just placed, I'd probably smack the injured dude and see if i can't catch up to you before hooking him
---
NO
---
Literally first thing that came to mind
---
For honor Shugoki is where I learned what a kanabo is
---
Bubba needs a soft nerf. He shouldn't be able to continuously spam his chainsaw just like the Huntress can't spam hatchet throws. It's not as bad with Hillbilly because he can only really attack straight on. Bubba can 360 spin with his chainsaw. I think a good fix would be he has a limited amount of fuel for his chainsaw throughout the match and has to conserve it. Or has to refill his fuel from lockers like Huntress with her hatches. And perk/offerings could be used to lessen the amount of times he has to refill his fuel.
---
What does the Oblivous Status effect do? I haven't played in forever.
---
That'd be kinda funny if crouching actually makes more blood orbs to come out.
---
It got "buffed" in the PTB, sorta. Still hard to pull off but at least it now works with protection hits. I'd say pass.
---
Im probably just gonna give up exhaustion perks tbh. Might replace Balanced Landing with the new Kindred.
---
Lucky Break seems absolute garbage since it's just blood, so I assume scratch marks don't count.
---
Any means necessary is def top tier though, if the killer doesn't break a pallet you can reset it, which is powerful at specific loops or the shack. This basically forced the killer to break the pallet, which allows you to predict easier and run away, or if they don't then you got a free pallet.
---
Nice, i can save my shards for something else, even when i feel tempted to try MoM
---
Nobody ever said that. 1/3 games for me at least end up like this. Both sides are hella toxic.
---
I’ve had the scenario I just described happen several times.
---
It does
---
When survivors t-bag me as ghostface, I always t-bag back
---
Syringe effect goes off on hit
---
Legion is the new Freddy. Can't wait for the legion rework in 2022 to make him top tier
---
or if he farms
---
Removed for unrelated to dead by daylight
---
Probably yes since she isn't licensed
---
Perhaps
---
Thanatophobia is too weak by itself because healing is too fast without Sloppy. Legion can't effectively apply sloppy so Legion can't use Thanatophobia.
---
Hell no, the perks that some of the killers have are trash. Leatherface with BBQ is bad because he doesn’t have whole map pressure while Billy with BBQ is amazing. Without teachable perks the game would be very very very survivor sided which is unfun.
---
Ok, thank you
---
I was watching a streamer look over them and his chat  was immediately like "OMG SURVIVOR PERKS ARE SO OP DOES BHVR EVEN KNOW WHAT BALANCE IS?" and I was just sitting there thinking "these are pretty shit... Fun... But shit"
---
Not bleeding doesn't do much if you are running from the killer or grunting in pain, so you need two perks to make it useful
---
Resetting palets is absolutely useless because they are either going to be broken or you're wasting a perk slot for the chance to drop a single extra pallet if you're lucky
---
And the last one is just a meme, you get to run head on into the killer while they are carrying a survivor to MAYBE help them save themselves from the hook, but if that really became powerful enough to be meta, killers have powerful perks that completely negate this so it doesn't even matter
---
I'm not saying i have the answers. All i'm saying is it doesn't take much to understand when something in a video game is used 80-90% of the time, over a bunch of other options there is probably a balance issue.
---
Ok
---
People don't play Demogorgon on console because it's a 50/50 of having absolutely abysmal fps and having no chance at doing anything or it being manageable.
---
If it is intentional i dont think it should be. Leatherface has a multihit ability that requires a charge and it doesnt INSTANTLY down you through endurance. 
---
This dude is pretty much leatherface but way better. 
---
I dont personally think we should be rewarding hook camping but thats just me.
---
It could also be good for when you got that one rank 20 feng who never looks back in a chase back and throws down the pallet when the killer is 20 meters away. 😋 (this comment is a joke)
---
It’s called moon walking and it doesn’t do anything. They’re just messing around in the game.
---
People are overreacting to the passive being removed. It still lets you reduce the landing lag of your first drop which still makes it good on the maps it was already good on (Haddonfield, The Game, but also the swamp maps, Crotus Pen, Coldwind Farm combine harvesters, and Autohaven cranes.)
---
It's still great for what it originally did: enabling some good one-time use loops and giving you an easier time on certain maps. It's just no longer a free win on maps with a lot of drops.
---
I love this! Do you have more DBD art? I'd love to see them or you should make more. Keep up the great work!!
---
Lithe gang rise up
---
There are builds where you WANT to chase/hit the obsession, right?
---
Play With Your Food and Dark Devotion come to mind
---
Also keep in mind that once Nemesis creates a new obsession, that obsession cannot hear your terror radius for 60 seconds.
---
I hope they change a bit in this ptb I really do but while I agree spirit was over preforming I can't say she is op mostly cause I found out her counter and I can loop her well, I'm not saying I'm a god tier survivor cause hell no I'm not. But if I pay attention to the Spirit's hair I can tell if she is phasing or not making it much easier to play against her, also iron will can shut her down pretty well, so yes she can be countered but you need to learn how.
---
lol. noob
---
Dying light doesnt lose stack on hits, it loses effect on death. which you can now change by having someone pallet slam you.
---
this DLC just made Dying light a god tier perk.
---
One of the leaked skins is mostly shirtless im pretty sure
---
good luck getting anything out of it
---
Otz tested beasts of prey it takes way too long for it to be worth it
---
Furtive Chase + Nemesis looks like a lot of fun. 
---
Furtive Chase + Nemesis + Make Your Choice feels like it could be crazy on certain killers. 
---
Furtive Chase  make anyone unhooking a survivor become the obsession(plus reduces your terror radius)
---
When they become the new obsession Nemesis makes them oblivious and shows their aura. 
---
Make Your Choice makes them exposed. 
---
Murder, Death, Kill.
---
I'm just going to reiterate when a few perks outshine the majority of the rest and become "must have" for high rank play the game is probably unbalanced.
---
Out of the loop, what's going on?
---
So use some of the add-ons that cause the broken effect. Then they can't heal at all for a minute and still have to mend. And because it's easier to hit people with Frenzy now, you can capitalize on the broken effect slowing the game down with Thanatophobia during its duration. This may not be a replacement for Sloppy, but now Legion has something in their power to work with
---
exactly
---
Try bringing back old legion by giving him no terror radius for the dude inflicted with deep wounds.
---
100%

Blood.  Oni can see blood orbs through walls.  This basically makes it near impossible to hide from Oni while injured, and gives Oni an inbuilt Nurses' Calling AND Deerstalker
---
Just put in Tony, mori the survivors with your fists in one go

So having you constantly be insulted online every killer face would numb you to it and give you thick skin, no?
---
well were you expecting to pull it back up and immediately throw it back down in the killer's face?

They are really going to make me buy Leatherface and the shape aren't they?...

Its why i tend to post this whenever a new patch comes out

People should not have to be doing a QA session on your own bloody game just to test if everything is functioning, i mean for christ sake, add functionality to disable Items and Addons already, at least then people dont waste time under the assumption that X item is functioning this patch.

you don't even have to escape as survivor, just farm points in the categories and it's easy to climb.

It counters NOED, Make your Choice, haunted ground, all slugging builds, Ghostface, Hillbilly , Leatherface, Meyers, plaguw, Iridescent head, and more

*grabs Mettle of Man*
---
I'll have to find a new crutch perk *cough * *cough* Poised
---
oh right forgot about that thanks!
---
I don’t think they will ever rework ruin, it’s a fair perk. It slows the game down and survivors would waste time looking for the hex totem. I don’t think they need to rework ruin, just rework totem placement so they’re not right next to gens.
---
If I need to use add-ons to achieve what I could do without add-ons before, don't you think that's a nerf? How do you see this as a buff? Vaulting 0.2 seconds faster doesn't do shit to counteract having to run add-ons now.
---
I’m saying it’s pathetic - implying that you’ve built ThIcK sKiN from post game bragging in a video game is a kick in the balls to those of us who have insults thrown at us IRL
---
I've been doing much better just going for hook saves rather than focusing on surviving lately
---
M1 is for the big boys
---
The only reason to run Beast of Prey is maybe on Legion because of the new undetectable, other than that, don't.
---
Is mettle of man even worth it anymore?
---
&gt;No Mither is finally strong against a killer
---
Bruh did you miss Plague week
---
I dont think that this will be the only thing they'll do in the dc area, it needs more work but I'd say that this is a good start, besides I dont mind longer queue times if that means that im gonna get matched with someone who'll actually play the game instead of dcing the first time they get hit, but thats my personal opinion.
---
Either way for me it beats dc'ing and having 0 penalty except losing 2 pips, that "punishment" was dreadful
---
*Feng KateDenson Denson Feng*
---
I honestly can't think of any other survivor perk that gives as much utility the whole game and should be nerfed. If anything I can think of 40 that need buffs. Balanced landing as it is now would just be like if Lithe had dance with me built in, and it worked even when exhausted on no cooldown.
---
I'm not pretending I know how to balance DbD. Just correcting people who claim that Haddonfield was the only place that could be abused.
---
Legion is less dependent on perks now. You can have variation now. You don't need Sloppy as a crutch now that the add-ons actually have a purpose
---
Ive seen this exact same format execpt the dye one was just a black image and the one saying "They're the same picture" was a dwight with a pacifier
---
Fuck yah it’s on ptb?
---
Issa joke, I don’t think he’s comparing “gg ez noob” to racial slurs and regular verbal harassment
---
Dear lord, dudes, he now vaults SO fkn fast, almost twice faster than survivor does, his speed boost is okay because it is major and you can feel it as you play. No running in circles anymore. I never used stbfl on legion so not a big deal, and about sloppy, I think its for the best, because playing against such legion is a healing-mending simulator, its just boring, I used to just give up to them because of how unfun it is to play, just kill me already. I find his nerf wich is buff actually good. Im an ex legion main but I still do and likely will play him
---
On Xbox? I wonder if that's the same guy I was playing against earlier. He would camp hooks and tbag at every down. He had NOED as well.
---
Ah ha, a man of culture I see
---
With BL some stuff becomes loopable when otherwise it wouldn't. Which becomes sorta bullshit in places that have enough other loops even without it
---
What’s changing
---
"Just don't lose it's a strategy"
---
Based on the PTB, I’d say it is.
---
I will say that buff might be an overstatement in hindsight, but this isn't a full on gutting of a character.
---
You have to expect these kind of toxic people when you play honestly. In high ranks there’s a ton of these SWFs that I’ve encountered. It’s just how some people try to get an easy win by a DC or the killer constantly chasing one person while everyone comes to the rescue with a flashlight when the survivor gets downed. It happens all the time, you just gotta get used to it.
---
#WhyNotBoth
---
I'll be adding her to my prestiege collection along with Nea and David.
---
I’ve been enjoying the SB + Fixated combo.
---
so what the hell is the point of Demon strike then.
---
Wait you can reset pallets?
---
im gonna cry they finally gave my grandpa a cosmetic thank you so much valve for the gift of licensed content
---
I would say it is because of the fix protection hits are getting in the next patch.
---
Wait a minute...
---
How did they balanced-landing looped when it got nerfed and it only works once?
---
SWF, flashlight blinding, camping, tunneling, all of these things are in the game and it’s not a bannable offense. Why ban people from trying out new content when they’re doing things that are not bannable? If people can spam flashlights with their friends and bully killers, that’s allowed so I’m saying just deal with it because BHVR is not gonna ban them.
---
That “counter” works only on some cosmetics. And it can be faked if thy pretend to phase. A much better method is to watch her shards, but even that is a terrible method. None of what you’ve “discovered” is new, it’s just so inconsistent that it’s not a real counter. Spirit isn’t counterable. Things will change in this ptb, likely a lot of things
---
Borrowed time- protection for your unhooked survivor...
---
We'll make it- +100% healing speed after unhooking someone...
---
Babysitter- uncooked survivor leaves no scratch marks while you see the killer and killer sees you...
---
I donno what else maybe an exhaustion perks so you can get away
---
Oni-Chan is sexy.  Huge, muscular, and has a big club.
---
...
---
Don't judge me.  &gt;.&gt;
---
Survivors should be faster than killers
---
Who's the streamer?
---
Wouldn't want to spoil the joke
---
How original. I totally haven't seen multiple posts like this already today.
---
Don't get hung up on one suggestion.
---
https://clips.twitch.tv/FairEnergeticInternTF2John
---
distortion and babysitter are cool, no one leaves scratch marks when you reacue from hooks
---
r/yourjokebutworse
---
Ash probably, dwight is free
---
No, you didn’t. That works on only a couple cosmetic sets and happens if she charges the bar halfway too. Any good spirit will charge the bar halfway to make that happen and there goes your entire “counter”. You played against bad spirits and have applied what you learned to every spirit.
---
Pretty good job so far :D
---
Comments or posts? I haven't seen any
---
It's a super strong perk. Being able to reset a loop is well worth time wasted not on gens
---
The disrespect of that pallet lmao
---
How am I getting hung up on one suggestion? I’m saying removing teachable perks would be horrible for the game.
---
So far I’ve only blinded at pallets :D
---
I don’t think so, considering they were all Rank 6-10
---
I don’t tbag at all lmao. And I didn’t stalk the whole game, so it literally wouldn’t have mattered if they revealed me or not.
---
Actually the oldest selling technique if we’re being honest
---
Yes please make all the killers really weak because even though this killer is less than 6 hours old, we count counter him 😭😭. How about learn to counter him first before complaining about stuff like this.
---
Personally I'd go for the Ash one, but its all about playstyle and if you play solo or swf more.
---
No one Likes a Dead killer, so yes people want him to function. Its just about the fact his power was so badly designed that it needs to be torn down and reworked instead of being tweaked.
---
Bloodhound is FAR from a top tier perk, but I honestly still think it's kind of underrated, especially on Legion. 
---
It makes it literally impossible to lose an injured survivor no matter what they do, (well, unless they're running this perk) + you can see the blood stains from a mile away so if the survivors don't heal, they physically cannot stealth from you, even with Iron Will.
---
The biggest issue is finding a perk slot for it, though. It's not BAD but there's a LOT of better perks out there.
---
Oni's mori is fucking brutal. Jesus Christ.
---
Pirates were fucked up, [like look at this shit](https://archive.archaeology.org/online/reviews/pirates/poll.html). 
---
However, a viking killer would be badass as well, especially with a blood eagle mori.
---
I wonder what sort of map either one would have though.
---
Just remember that the killer can see your aura after you unhook, but you can use that to your advantage.  Walk away from where you want to go, then double back after a few secinds where your aura can't be seen anymore.  By then, the person you unhook will be long gone.
---
Borrowed time, We'll make it, Head-on, Bond/empathy (head-on for the possibility of stunning someone out of a basement hook or while they're being chased)
---
Aaannndddd they got you
---
/s?
---
Firstly I have my Legion prestiged. Secondly now you know how Pig mains feel.
---
Nah her hair does change and I take that into consideration I start running even if I see that hair change or not it still works and it may not work 100% of the time it still works regardless to keep the chase going for just a few more seconds.
---
Am a Nea main; can confirm I try my hardest to communicate despite being limited to nodding, shaking my head, pointing, waving, and running in circles.
---
you only drop one color rank 
---
red -&gt; purple 
---
purple -&gt; green 
---
green -&gt; yellow
---
Oh well that's dumb, changing a killer because of one perk
---
Well with a viking just have it be similar to the red forest or some ancient village. Idk that any sort of naval map would work.
---
Rank 16s going against Rank 6 is not normal matchmaking. People take advantage of the PTB matchmaking system because they don’t go against killers that are their rank. Just wait the week and the matchmaking will be normal after PTB is over.
---
Shirtless Trapper OP.
---
The new survivor gets to reset pallets while the new killer perks are entirely worthless.
---
Ok.
---
Now I start understanding...
---
If BHVR makes a weeping angel killer, I'm fucking gone dude
---
BL was powerful even in cooldown. It could turn many loops like the tractors into semi-infinites. It was not just a single map problem.
---
I think a port sort of map would be great for either, maybe with like a moored ship or shipwreck as a part of it too.
---
People dc against every killer
---
Me either. I'm not sure if I can face her right now. But I've been playing Jake all day, I think she suspects something.
---
My issues is the repetition and how similar every game feels because of how often i play against the same builds. It gets boring fast.
---
BBQ and Chilli was in the Shroud a couple of weeks ago. :(
---
Ugh why do they keep putting perks from free characters on the shrine?
---
I know it's not new these counters but I run regardless if she is faking it, if I see that hair move I run cause I want to squeeze every last second out of the ongoing chase so my teammates can do gens.
---
We really need just a completely new power. Poor Legion just cant catch a break.
---
All of them? Or do you think bubba and myers are op? And i dont see anything wrong with a killer having a good iridescent add on.
---
lmao, come back when you hit a thousand and ill just call you wrong instead of a noob ok cutie? 2k+ hrs btw
---
It was in the patch notes no idea if it’s only for pc and switch users hopefully it is only for them as ps4 and Xbox has no dedicated servers
---
Are yall forgetting about the upcoming survivor perks and the fact that protection hits are getting a buff? If anything, I would suggest picking up Mettle of Man unless you don't wanna try out different builds. But hey, that's just my two cents.
---
That's how The Entity works!
---
meh. it's more the general direction the game is going that im not liking
---
Possibly. I feel like the entity would have some competition from Cthulhu then though lol. These Eldritch deities fighting for whatever it is they get out of this.
---
He has an easier time hitting instadowns, the patrol time is pretty similar, he has tracking with the blood orbs, his demon dash is quieter, and he can nearly instantly get his power if survivors dont heal on gens
---
Spamming Any Means Necessary locks pallets so that Legion can't vault them.  Who knows how many twists and turns Mr. Bone's Wild Ride really has?
---
be careful, the "i dont agree with you so ill just downvote instead" squad appears to be out in force tonight
---
No. It's not bad, but it's definitely not worth 2700. It's purely situational and unreliable.
---
Thank you, ok.
---
That’s true and not, the oni with no addons only see the orbs very close to them
---
the direction of this post is very unclear
---
Right, I’m just saying that from your post you seem to be saying Ruin is overpowered. The imbalance is that really good survivors can get the gens done unreasonably quick, not that the perk itself is too strong.
---
The new survivor has that exact perk, but I think it's a 3 minute cooldown
---
Behavior Interactive have around 500 employees as of 2019. NetEase is a publicity trading company with net income of 10.85B CNY and 18129 employees as of 2017.  Yeah you can keep your face palm going.
---
Screams in spirit fury...
---
Guy above is a crybaby, pay him no mind
---
He asked i question on my post...
---
Are you really gatekeeping by 200 fucking hours?
---
I would say completely remove the terror radius reduction, and give him haste after consuming a flower, but only for a certain amount of time
---
It looks like her arms and shoulders stretch to fit the animation.
---
Kinda like they just tried to force her skeleton through an animation meant for another Killer without modifying the animation at all.
---
if you showed the kate biker skin i would say you werent racist, but Feng has NOTHING in common with the new character except being asian
---
Do you think I really meant WGLF, I hoped you would catch on and think, DS, Adrenaline, Dead Hard, Object of Obsession, Unbreakable to a extent, and while perks are constantly changed for survivors, killers have their base kit changed cause survivors have no base kit other than run vault or drop pallet.
---
I love how lore wise spirit and oni were lead to their paths in different ways but they still converged together.
---
Pretty sure Adam and rin aren’t. Just the fact that they both were in Japan, they were in different parts of Japan and Adam was in elementary schools not Rins private school
---
I didn't say it was op.
---
Define “play good” if I play nurse and end every chase within seconds and instantly hook I’ll be denied a pip. I would barely safety at all. What is “playinggood”? If I hook survivors twice each then mori of course I’ll pip but is that “playing good”?
---
After a few hours of gameplay, this is what I've noticed. Since The Oni is pretty much forced to slug if he doesn't want to lose his ability, you're gonna spend more gameplay healing other downed survivors. Another dilemma is do you heal fully or do you not? He has an insta-down but if you are injured you allow him to activate his power and you're tracked easier. I'm going to guess healing perks like Inner Strength and Autodidact are going to be more common in response to this killer.
---
I say get MoM since Dwight is free. Also MoM will pair well with Bond even, so you could be leveling Dwight anyway.
---
No, you have to pay or use iridisicent shards,
---
What I’m saying is you should expect this kind of thing when you play, many players are toxic and BHVR time and time again does nothing about it, I’m not blaming the victim, I’m telling them to have to get used to it bc it’s not gonna be fixed any time soon. My wording was weird.
---
In twitch chat someone was reading the lore and all these people were upset about “politics” in their games. Im beginning to think that people hide behind “politics” to avoid having empathy for others.

Except Plague uses Blood Echo better, and Nemesis Legion is gonna pull off some really dirty shit with Deep Wound essentially becoming inescapable (No TR, so constantly ticking down, and he’s gonna be hot on your heels)
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
Make her flop through the windowing like a dead fish.
---
It's not aout being OP, it's about it being stupid. Like, you can just walk after someone and don;t do anything and there's nothing the survivor can do. The old Legion was trash tier without their best addons but still they were extremely unfun and boring to play against, because the only thing they provided was braindead W holding.
---
Nemesis looking good on Legion
---
I use default skins :)
---
I mean it’s not really an exploit so much as a skill
---
The amount of people falling for this bait
---
*The Legion changes*
---
Stop, stop! He's already dead!
---
Exactly! Her body doesn;t fit the animation at all...
---
By playing good I mean do all the requirements to get gold or iridescent badges in each category, except sacrifice category. If you get iridescent in all other categories you should still pip. That’s what I mean by “playing good”
---
I'm a survivor main with nearly 1,000 hours in, and I literally only play killer to complete daily rituals. I usually try to initiate farm games by picking people up and dropping them at gens, smacking gens, letting them pallet slam me, etc. But they always respond t-bagging, Balanced Landing looping, flashlight clicking, pointing at pallets, and t-bagging at the exit gates. Like, I just want to have a fun, stress-free game where everyone gets bloodpoints and I get my daily ritual, but they just want to be toxic little shits. It makes me feel bad for every killer I've ever BM'd, and the main reason I don't anymore.
---
Lmao
---
Neither, just level them up
---
Most have been mentioned but also consider WGLF from David. It’s the BP equivalent of BBQ for killers so as long as you’re not abusing it and screwing your team over for stacks, it could serve you well.
---
First appearance of the perk in the shrine
---
It was mentioned in the bug fix section of the PTB
---
Oni really be out here vibe checking everyone
---
"oh no, im a five year old for not knowing that information", what the fuck am i going to debate about, "oh hey, its kinda weird that you have shit wifi, ever thought of getting better internet"
---
Please stfu
---
Because it's the first the perk is in the shrine.
---
I love haddenfield, as a killer it never bothered me loop a window I'll still get you. Shit without that I'ma just roll through that map once all the pallets are dropped in no time.
---
So will breakout stack with Boilover?
---
ya, just wanted to ss for people who wanted to see it in game :)
---
Isnt this literally Legions
---
This would be great
---
Neither. MoM is trash and Prove Thyself comes from Dwight who you probably want to level up anyway for Bond.
---
He's not that tall, just disappointing.
---
2 things
---
Private schools can be elementary
---
And the whole timeline with who gets taken first is never confirmed, except that the entity has its own timeline to abide by. That’s why instead of every survivor existing at once, only some are, meaning the entity has to go back and forth to live
---
There was something in the patch notes that said that it fixed the entry of Haddonfield garages. It’ll be out in the next patch. There were leaked patch notes.
---
esY
---
THAT'S TRUE! Dude if you are reading this i congratulate you.
---
Still, no reason to be that way honestly. It's just a dick move to be like oh how do I know. If you don't know, don't say shit
---
Yeah, not shown was the garage right next to this one also being blocked at all entrances
---
If you want to get Mettle so you don't have to buy Ash at some point go for it. Personally I'd pass on both perks and wait for next week. Proove Thyself is okay I guess if you want the extra coop bloodpoints and the +10% are nice but there are just so many better perks out there...
---
Can't relate
---
Map also looks ugly as fuck now too
---
damn what a daddy
---
They indicated that perks required to complete levels of the archives would be available in the shrine, so that explains some of the free perks we've seen lately.
---
Blood for the Blood God, SKULLS FOR THE SKULL THRONE.
---
Sry wrong game
---
i honestly think that this legion update is a buff, at least in my eyes
---
it's the same style c but it's completely destroyed, and there's a samurai statue in the middle that's destroyed
---
I fear no man... but, that **THING**
---
*any means necessary and breakout*
---
It scares me.
---
Feng is just the "weaker bloodline"
---
&gt;If you don't know, don't say shit
---
Counter point: if you know no one has the answer then dont ask the question dumbass, questions entitles an answer, asking a question you knlw cant be answered then dont ask the question
---
Sounds good
---
am i the only one who loves it wtf
---
Notice how all the "do good" survivors and getting salty. Fucking hypocrites
---
Ok, do you want access to the document?
---
Downed survivors don't drop blood that the Oni can collect, to my knowledge
---
.3 slower, his vault speed was actually nerfed.
---
built in iron maiden
---
Will you shut the fuck up
---
I knew I recognized the art style from somewhere
---
They don’t lmfaoo
---
If you're going by that logic this then makes the questions such as "is there a God?" "What's the meaning of life" irrelevant
---
I think it's because there not even challenges. It's something you can do easily but it's such a high requirement that it's nothing more than yet another thing to grind
---
&gt;STBFL is meant to be used to AVOID hitting your obsession. This “nerf” fixes that.
---
On contrary, it makes you hit them because now you will not lose stacks. Or did i not get what you mean?
---
she has been my high school crush but I'm all over it now. Asian kate is way better
---
Japan and Jamaica 
---
&gt;Both are small island countries

&gt;Both start with the letter J

Yeah, they're practically the same thing - BHVR
---
I wish it didn't have to be like this.
---
I brought the mori this time B O Y S
---
It's gone while you're exhausted. So now it's lithe but harder to activate
---
Wraith can be good with Windstorm and Swift Hunt, but yeah, he is pretty weak without those add ons. Still think he is better than Legion tho
---
A lot worse looking than her old one, but I get why it had to be changed.
---
At least add in some warp-y effects like when she’s walking. Watching her move like a normal person is unnerving.
---
Would you chill up, man?
---
Indeed. Made me sad after that trailer tbh
---
it is a DARN situation indeed.
---
I wouldn’t even waste my time with them but that’s the only way to acquire the putrid serum. I just wanted to see if anyone else was feeling annoyed by these challenges too
---
Oh oh oh! I get it! Is it because of *Diversion*?? Ba-dum TSS!
---
Yeah, it's a bit of a handful on Xbone
---
Killers kits change because they are variable. Same reason some items for survivors get rebalanced, like BNP or instaheals. As new perks get added and rebalanced, new playstyles can develop that reveals a lack of balance, this prompts change, which can unbalance something else. 
---
That's the constant dev cycle for games like this. Acting like it's all in one sides favour is just ridiculous.
---
They're just gonna keep nerfing Legion until one day he ends up as a survivor
---
🤣
---
It’s like you are paid 100 upvotes for your transcribing lol.
---
Day 1 and the bullying has already begun. 
---
Oh god. Oh fuck.
---
Yes I’m just doing it with fun
---
I think I’m scarred.
---
It's an additional effect.
---
I love how the common cosmetics change her hair color. I’m totally using the purple or the red hair
---
How To Train Your Swamp Demon
---
It's a weird flex
---
What about the Plague she is also strong?
---
Yes it was definitely very strong. But I was just explaining why it had a second component. They should have just reduced it, not gotten rid of it while you're exhausted. just give it a lower reduction? People aren't going to run this anymore.
---
By elementary schools I meant numerous schools in a different part of Japan, Kagoshima. Whereas rin lived in Kagawa, Japan where she went to Takamatsu private school which was a university. He wasn’t her teacher.
---
This always happens on PTB.
---
the virgin standstill "mindgame" vs CHAD BONK
---
u made me slightly angery but heres my upvote
---
Haven't seen any posts on this so just feeding you guys my crazed theories. All killers in the menu are in order of their release/chapter number. Nurse is chapter one, Mikey is chapter two, etc. Until now the only exception to this rule was Huntress, and I've assumed that this is because she is available to all players and it would be strange if she was offset whenever you get a new DLC. If that assumption is correct, the same could be true for the new Chapter.
---
THE PTB IS OUT?!?
---
Dead Harding for distance is a bigger problem than BL was because of how restrictive BL is. You can Dead Hard for distance on every map on every tile. You could only exploit certain loops with BL on certain maps and those loops are already exploitable without BL. So its weird for them to completely destroy BL but keep dead hard the same.
---
sigh 
---
*unzips pants*
---
Don’t worry you didn’t, cause jokes are supposed to be fun. The reference has already been made several times.
---
Fuck it, grey thanos
---
I don't seem to remember that being the case with Demo, but I suppose it does make kind of sense since the new chapters are always free on the ptb.
---
I've put... a little too much time into Wraith (I'm [approaching](https://dbd.onteh.net.au/playerstats/76561198201386175/) 10k uncloak attacks), and FWIW I think the swift hunt + windstorm combo is his best set of add-ons by miles. I think there's some room to experiment with the swift hunt slot (possibly "shadow dance," "the ghost," "all seeing," etc.), but if you want to do well with him you're not going to have a good time without windstorm - even the "mud"/yellow variant is worth it IMO.
---
If you care for any perk suggestions I'd be happy to share builds I like to run!
---
You should apply makeup, it can do wonders trust me !!!.

Leaked photo of Amanda hiding away from BHVR nerf wheel. (2019 colorized)
---
but Adam was in japan for college
---
Those fuckers could be neon pink and I’d guarantee my dumb ass would still get caught.
---
For the love of god dont complain about it if you dont know what you're doing. Their have been NUMEROUS tests on revealing him and he has to have 30 or more % of his body reavealed and he needs to bc almost directly above your survivors head. Survivors even have the advantage bc you can still reveal him .3 seconds after hes gone behind cover. Piss off its not broken you're just retarded
---
Been out for a few hours now. Enjoy if your PC, or join me in hideous envy if your a console guy.
---
GIVE US DADDY ONI
---
Us ghosty mains just gotta deal with it. People will come up with all kinds of excuses for DC'ing but at the end of the day they're just sore losers who don't want a challenging game, they want easy wins. Keep spooking and stabbing. Tbag their dc'd corpses while you're at it.
---
Could you elaborate? What direction do you think it's going in?
---
Literally dueled this guy yesterday lol. And now I’m running from his scary ass.
---
2 minutes isn’t worth it, just use corrupt then patrol the 4 gens. You’ll likely get downs and they’ll get little to no gen progress
---
NO MORE MINDGAMES
---
Chill up? Nice one
---
Okay... I suppose that's fair enough. Sadly accurate.
---
Long as we can agree that it *shouldn't* be tolerated, and that the devs doing nothing is unfortunate, then I guess we're mostly on the same page.
---
Thanks for sharing, I know this was bumming a lot of people out.
---
They have no reason to make chapters free anymore because all original chapters essentially are free. You can buy them with playtime.
---
BOM BOM
---
I know the lore, just havin fun with the meme
---
That's only if you count all Killers equally, though, instead of adjusting for base power or playrate.
---
Garbage as usual. Might as fell get MoM because I don't have Ash. Thank you
---
Someone's out of the loop I guess
---
Yup, the chapter is in the ptb ready for testing
---
oh k
---
Yes, you get a frank and julie skin
---
And survivors want to have fun too and experience the new killer in chases, yet heres killers with their rare add ons hard tunneling, camping the first hook all game, and slugging the last survivor to drag the game out.
---
It works both ways.
---
That’s kind of why I was caught off guard by it, but I guess I jumped the gun a little since this has apparently happened on previous PTBs.
---
It’s not
---
Thank fuck it isnt another sporty Meg
---
Those challenges are easy, it just takes time. You're getting rewarded for doing things you'd normally do anyway.
---
What’s your steam, I’ll show you that you can’t even run me for 30 seconds. Prayer beads you can’t counter as you get no chance to react. Plus spirit is too easy to play for how strong she is, shit players can do well as her “mindgame” isn’t hard. You just think you’re a good player because you went against 1 shit spirit. Add my steam same as reddit and I’ll shit on you
---
That's a fair assessment.

He is the ancestor who founded the estate. The Katana her father used to murder Rin was a family heirloom.
---
Basically he went around butchering "unworthy" warriors.
---
Seems the entity likes this family
---
I main both survivor and killer and honestly, removing the stagger is absolutely ridiculous. Certain loops are completely useless now, and killers are potentially guaranteed a hit. The stagger is extreme and barely gives time to recover before the killer can hit you, and even without the nerf, BL was easily counterable. Once you hit the survivor once, they don't want to play on that loop anymore.
---
No the fuck he does not. Leave him alone.
---
You can not break pallets with the dash as ive learned. The dash itself doesnt do shit, you have to use the attack while in it to use it. It is defetinly faster then i thought though
---
This video is so wholesome
---
Spirit was fine imo
---
Legion was just so boring with his most common builds that it really ruined the game.
---
We've loved for so long. But I guess I'm just like all of the others. Willing to just ship when someone new comes along.
---
Not worse than Hag kind of automatically disqualifies this as a valid opinion in higher rank gameplay. And then you imply Huntress is good, when a majority of maps make her easy to run even for average survivors.
---
Not that I necessarily agree, but I think OP's point is this. 
---
Rin could have attended elementary School in Kagoshima, with Adam as a teacher, then Adam gets snatched, fast forward 10-15 years, Rin is a student at Takamatsu and then the stuff with her dad happens. 
---
I think it's a stretch, but unless I'm missing something it's certainly possible.
---
You have to let survivors salty rage FUEL you!
---
Every part of me wants this to be a Dwight in there.
---
This shrine is very good...
---
...for those who like shit
---
I felt a little bad about that read lol
---
I thought Renjiro, his father, was the first Yamaoka? One of his addons is a fragment of a ship which Renjiro was on, which coincidentally coincides with the first Yamaoka's story.
---
What is oblivious??
---
ELI5 please?
---
You might be right actually.
---
It takes unnecessary time, I really don’t like grinding and that’s what it basically is. You have to play more than 5 matches to get 15 gens done. It’s bullshit
---
oni only has to charge for about a second to do a walking one-hit
---
I was taking a break from the game when that happened :(
---
It’s meant to be that way. It’s situational and doesn’t happen all the time. Just like Freddy and BT
---
He’s the best killer in the game now... he’s either gonna stay as is or needs a little nerf to make him nurse/spirit level but right now I know as a fact he’s getting a nerf. If you can’t lose as him than he needs a nerf as much as I like him and as much as I like winning I know he needs one.
---
is it only within the PTB?

All I saw in the video was a GhostFace commemorating his victory. It's not that bad that they t-bagged you.
---
I know they got with noed, but from what I can see he had already sacrificed all 3 survivors and closed hatch, so it's just what he could do, make use of his perk. What were them supposed to do? Stand in the corner doing nothing? Let them commemorate their victory. Fair or not. You said the door was at 90%, escape was already pretty impossible, even if he didn't have noed.
---
If they did face camp or tunnel all game, I can see the toxicity in that. If they just manage to secure a win. That is no sign of toxicity.
---
Then don't do the challenges if they piss you off that much.
---
Ok lol, sorry I dont spend all of my time on this sub. Am I mistaken, or was the character revealed just today?
---
Do you lose all of the charge too? Or does it just cut out and then you need to build it back up from the cut-out point?
---
Its just as broken on PC and seems completely random at times as to whether it reveals him or not.
---
Which is why survivors get frustrated, which is why they d/c
---
I’ve played Ghostface too and had a survivor look at me from the other side of a pallet. It didn’t even start to reveal me. I felt so bad for the survivor.
---
Thank you for your help I wanted to make sure!
---
I'm pretty sure the same thing happened TO Demogorgon in that PTB (happened to somebody, I know that for certain), doesn't mean anything.
---
Time to retire from DBD.
---
Not really, plague becomes useless. Whereas oni has a chance to use his ability.
---
No Mither hard counters Oni.
---
It says disconnecting early as in before the match ends not as in only if you disconnect in the early game.
---
Or maybe people just want the reveal mechanic to work as intended?
---
No couldnt possibly be that
---
I wouldn’t but that’s the only way to get the serum, which is pretty stupid if you ask me
---
Was the new killer possessed by the sword or is he the one that possessed the sword or is it ambiguous? Cos for the father it sounded like he was possessed or something.
---
Because it’s garb
---
My memory must be shit because I think you might be right. Now it's just a question of whether or not to take the post down or take the shame in full force.
---
r/internettoughguy
---
have 3 people in your game go in spectator you'll be surprised
---
The Oni is half Kensei and half Shugoki mix.
---
the oni is an “ancient” ancestor of the spirit and the yamaoka family.
---
Yup. Worse of all? They reward 3 rift fragments..
---
Dude youre wasting your breath this game is insanely survivor sided and they nerf what little killers have but these entitled survivors still act like theyre the victim. “Hey 3 killers just got absolutely gutted”. “GoOd X pLaYeRs CaN sTiLl MaKe It WoRk” “who cares did you see they nerfed a degenerate perk that enabled countless god loops like omg think of the fun of the survivors for once”. And then they wonder why their queue times are so fucking long its cuz no one wants to play killer man.
---
Yeah I do love playing Legion but I hate doing the same builds.
---
And you still play despite showing disdain for it?
---
Honestly, from what I’ve heard, it’s consistently toxic on both sides in all ranks.
---
Thats a mood definitely buying the chapter
---
Not as much as killers like ghostface, clown, nurse and spirit, which are either hard and/or annoying killers to play against.
---
Idiot checks out.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyuu0f/iron_will_glitch/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Matchmaking time is dependant on the community. First come first served depending on ranks and so on. If there aren’t players there aren’t games, simple
---
They're probably going to have a system that checks if a person is hitting ESC + leave match. So people will have to ALT+F4 or unplugging their internet, which they might track if a user is DCing an uncommon amount.
---
Either way, I'll take less DCs all around than the current state the game is in.
---
Welcome to dbd, half the players are assholes and the other half aren't
---
I would argue iridescent hatchet isnt playing the game just because it ends so quickly. But it will stop salty killers from DCing too. Works both ways and definitely a good change.
---
As far as I could tell
---
Oof, I got bad news for you. Honestly best thing to do on PC is close the chat and on Console either ignore or set it so that no one can send you messages unfortunately.
---
Hey, chill out.
---
I hate it 😭 but I love the game so I’m booboo the fool
---
Stops killers from DCing too
---
Base game killers are also part of a chapter, aren't they?
---
This is why new players shouldn’t suggest balance changes, are you farming downvotes
---
Ah, my mistake. And no, there’s no way. The house has been passed down generations. They couldn’t have made other arrangements. Unless there’s another branch of the family, which doesn’t seem so. Still, maybe future archives will reveal more
---
They also broke sound again and Killers can no longer track Survivors efficiently because of aggressive occultism culling. This marks the tenth? Eleventh? Time a new update has broken sounds in the same way.
---
So yeah they're really hitting out out of the park as usual.
---
Like BL wasnt already in tryhard builds
---
Mhm sure. That's why they took away Styptic healing a single state and instead of Anti healing two states, now takes 16 seconds for one state, while yet again adding a killer who not only has a one hit down, but moves fast as hell.
---
Exactly. I'm a killer main on PC with 2k hours and I pkay fair yet still get shit from survivors sometimes. Its just not nice.
---
Oni can very easily curve around corners, besides, I wasn't comparing Oni to Billy I was saying that he is a strict upgrade to Myers.
---
Is there a strategy for being last survivor alive and the gates are closed to get out? It's happened like 3 times now.
---
Got found instantly tunneled and camped still should have gotten points tho
---
Fuck yeah 😎🔫
---
Play her. Watch some good streamers play her. Keep playing against her.
---
I can often last longer against a Spirit than other killers lol it just takes a lot of experience and eventually you begin to predict their every move.
---
Do you actually think I that I think I'm good that's funny cause I said nothing about my personal skill, I just stated that I know how to counter her.
---
Yep because once again bland perks for survivor, one is one time use whether or not you choose to use it. Hillbilly 2.0 was added, took away insta heals and added more insta downs.
---
That's fair, right? Taking away what balanced out insta downs.
---
They are, those questions are pointless as they wont be answered, sorry to break your philosophical brain
---
Don't really see the justification in needing to change this addon, other killers have 1 hit downing abilities. It's limited anyway, even with other add-ons you still have to use it wisely.
---
Run BBQ instead of Beast Of Prey. BBQ N' Billy is very strong and sets you up for starting a new chase after hooking someone + more points.
---
As a survivor you won’t get messages instead you’ll be face camped but that’s really rare as a killer the best you can do is just ignore those people as best you can
---
Possessed by the Sword. Hmmm, arthas would like to have a chat with him.
---
I want to see the President get snatched in the middle of a speech

I believe were seeing this aafter dedicated servers because they can tell the nature of the DC.

I suppose a work around could be to just unplug the router
---
-Have to "activate" power based on blood
---
-Must use melee separately to instadown (not just run into them and drop
---
-Same for pallets
---
-No stun and more strafe control when in sprint mode
---
-Can loop pretty normally into insta-down
---
-blood gives information on top of charging power
---
-if power is active it will reset when picking up a survivor
---
Basically; more like Meyers in how his power will trigger intermittently throughout a match (much more frequently), has passive information gathering, and his power burst works similar to billy but noticeably different
---
I want it, 👏 gimme skin bhvr 👏
---
When you say “mindgame” because you don’t understand what mindgames are
---
I've been playing for years and all I can tell you is that it doesn't really get any better. Best thing you can do is troll the salty people and don't feed trolls trying to make you salty.
---
Hahaha (not a fake laugh)
---
Imagine if BHVR did that, bad teens gone clean, and are altruistic to their team.
---
Please explain, you’re going against a spirit with strider. What’s the counter? Run to a pallet? That’s 50/50 she can come from either way, go to a vault, another 50/50, run a somewhat open route, she can hear you. Run iron will and walk, strider completely counters. Please expand if you feel a need
---
The tongue alone is meh compared to hag for sure, but smashing their head with his club 3 times after makes it more brutal imo.
---
Or you just nerf the perk so you never have this issue on any map ever again.
---
Isn't that our duty as killer? To just shut up and let them go?
---
I don't disagree with you, I just kind of want it to stop.
---
Holy thats like a teir three michael with sprint burst.
---
&lt;those questions are pointless as they won't be answered
---
So, by your logic, asking someone's opinion via question is pointless?
---
Killer main (so no one thinks i'm an entitled survivor main), I think Oni should be taken out of his power if he breaks a pallet to remedy things like this. It makes it to where survs have to waste a pallet but it also adds a bit of weight to the decision instead of being able to take out every thrown pallet on the map within 15 seconds.
---
Why couldn't they just show her like have a seizure or something, it was fine as a teleport it just needed an animation to let you know she was doing it.
---
Father was being agitated by the entity in order to make him a raging killer. Rins reaction to being murdered prooved to be a stronger emotional catalyst for it.
---
If there is an "Oni" haunting the family it's probably just the influence of the entity
---
Oooohhh I get you now. Thanks for the clear up
---
After the protection hit rework maybe
---
ure a somewhat hot girl who likes that survivor with teh roboto hand and nancy?

She's an original survivor, so probably

you did this the last 2 DLC drops, it wasnt even funny the first time
---
Only problem with that is he sounds useless then unless all pallets are broken on that side of the map.
---
Yeah exactly, by not allowing a survivor to make one loop (making a pallet forced down) yet being also able to instantly break it kind of means a win win for Oni.
---
This is similar to the Demogorgon but he is balanced where survivors can risk looping him again as the lunge is in a straight line.
---
So let’s ignore the fact that mobile games makes more money. Let’s ignore the fact that NetEase has huge Chinese market while DBD is banned from streaming in mainland China. Let’s ignore the fact that developing more games at a larger scale lowers the cost of developing each one. Let’s ignore that they can take higher risk and make bigger investments in each DLC. Let’s just talk about human power, let’s assume BHVR only work on 3 games currently, which is obviously an understatement but whatever, so they have 500 employees and they work on 3 games. NetEase will need to be actively working on 18000/500*3=108 games to have equal amount of human input. It’s simple math but you are too busy face palming yourself to do the calculation...
---
Oh suck it up. Light trashing has existed in games for decades, it's harmless competitive egging. It's like mooning the opposing dodge ball team - do you have a sook when that happens too in PE? 
---
If your incredibly vulnerable ego can't take someone literally ***tapping fucking ceouch***, maybe just don't play until you've sorted yourself out.
---
I mean I know I'm not gonna change anything cause I'm just 1 person, but I hate how one sided this game is becoming and still will because survivors want to have fun and have no hard times.
---
set messages to friends only. its a competitive game
---
You can break pallets as Hag, but it's better to trap pallets for the mindgame.
---
No as it has a opininated answer, asking someone their opinion on something isnt for an answer, its to learn about the person, its not about the answer but kore wjat it says about them
---
That always seemed like a powerful combo, reduces the main drawback of SB.
---
Would you ever run one without the other?
---
Entitled Killer Main: NERF THIS PLEASE
---
Well huntress is an example. But yeah I’m basically saying that if your a killer or survivor and join a lobby, You gotta accept who you’re versing and just play the game and have fun. Quitting early just ruins the experience for everyone.
---
A character standing still doing no animations lewl. 
---
Second picture, using a child to display soemthing that you could most likely find a better picture representing him. 
---
You only put the child picture to make it look bad lul.
---
minus the part about trolling salty ppl. never troll under any circumstances
---
Hes fine stop whining. His power is limited timing and its not like he can just make 360 turns.
---
True. Maybe either give him the ability to stomp pallets as normal or make it only take a chunk out of the power meter instead of fully depleting it. Or even just require a fully charged hit.
---
I'm not joking, just asking you to not respond so ragefully towards someone that you don't even know. They want to show something and we should respect it, even if you disagree with them.
---
If you do want to start a discussion with them, show them your point of view. If you don't have anything constructive to say, don't say it. Keep your curses to yourself, as they have done nothing wrong towards you.
---
Every time I go to play killer the game crashes but survivor works fine. 
---
Anyone else have this issue?
---
I know don't worry
---
Seems like a situational "stop bloodlusting my friend" perk. Sorta.

---
I like the ones that make me use a perk/character I don’t usually.
---
Yeah, I also feel Oni gets 'T3' a lot faster and more frequent than Myers too.
---
They are always after the Huntress on the PTB because they are free to play on PTB. On the live version they move.
---
While I agree that, aesthetically, he is really awesome, in reality his power is basically just that unfortunately.
---
Dont care didnt ask
---
This implies I use exhaustion perks.
---
My name is not bricky
---
His is quite maneuverable, I find. I certainly have played a lot of killers which I can easily spin around or 'juke' but there is one guy I've played a lot who seems to get the hang of it and it's quite hard to do anything of that sort.
---
Its always the case.
---
Nice art 👍
---
I'm not saying I'm good at this game I'm far from it but I have learned to predict a spirit if she is doing her "mind game" and I know I will get caught eventually but I strive to keep the chase going as long as I can so my teammates can get gens done. It's not that I'm saying I can loop for days but I'm saying I'm capable of stalling.
---
Yeah those are fun
---
What? His katana is his weapon.
---
[Not sure if you already found it or not but here it is] (https://youtu.be/PXK9aSIZcUs)
---
It's the only video I could find showcasing their backstory, he does read through really fast but you can pause and read at your own pace
---
Timestamps:
---
Killer: 1:39
---
Survivor: 15:41
---
And again why is it a problem? His power is both limited in duration and it takes awhile to build it up, not to mention his dash itself ittrely doesn't do anything, its  his attack which has a windup and low AoE based range.
---
&gt;and was so mad i just dc when he finally got me
---
Man I was with you all the way until this. People can be shit, and toxic, and awful, but don't feed into it. Dc'ing just promotes more toxic behaviour.
---
The game is like alcohol, poisonous yet addictive and great when you're in the right mood/shits going okay. Bad when things aint going so swell.
---
Honestly it usually doesn't bother me none, it can get a little annoying when they attempt a 360, but I adapt quick to those so those survivors don't last long. Trying to hit through pallets just for then to suddenly be forward two inches is also irritating, but manageable.
---
No sbit being a team is optional but having being a team be optional requires there to be people to optionally play as a team. Not babies rage quitting. Having that extra person to get chased during the game is crucial even if they dont want points or to level up and dont do shit. Dcing doesnt change the choice to teaming being optional, it changes it to nothing. Next excuse my dude.
---
Fair enough. Yes he won. This is considered poor sportsmanship to tbag and slash hooked survivors. Some people don’t know how to win. Same dbags idolize the yards who choreograph a touchdown dance. It’s poor taste
---
No he won't be free.
---
Yea me too
---
The dash is just a good form of movement, his power lasts enough to get 1 to 2 survivors (like Myers) but regens a lot faster since eventually the blood is everywhere.
---
Well then.
---
Ah so you'll only be nice if there is a tangible reward huh? Pretty childish. Also makes you an asshole. But whatever, have fun being a prick online for no reason.
---
I'm still Kate main
---
Lol nice
---
I'm on console too, and I've had some issues with revealing him. I recently had a game where I was Exposed while staring directly at him from across a pallet, and another time he was revealed when I flicked my camera back for a second while I was running away. There's very little feedback to let you know if you're revealing him until you get the notification either way.
---
I don't own GF, so I've tried watching a bunch of videos from his perspective and from those of other survivors to see if I can figure out if I'm doing something wrong, but my experience with it varies so much from match to match (and sometimes within the same match) that it hasn't helped much.
---
Any constructive tips on how to reveal him are appreciated!
---
Well if you have a pleasant way to respond to someone telling you to kill yourself shoot for it. I'll stick to trolling though in the meantime.
---
God forbide a strong situational perk. Those maps are out of how many?
---
I would buy these boys day fuckin 1
---
I'm used to other games aswell, but honestly this community come close to the league community in terms of toxicness which is quite disappointing
---
Both. They've been being posted all day
---
One small nerf is making it so movement speed while charging doesn’t stack with add ons cuz you go nutty fast with two of them
---
Well now that you know you'll never get cut any slack for how you play you now know you can play however you want. 
---
When I play killer I hardly ever get a response from survivors and when they do say something it will be a "GG" (only by that last one to die) or one survivor will complain about who they had on there team.  
---
Also they dont just bash killers , they bash each other aswell.
---
"OMG what was everyone doing?"
---
"Way to sandbag and farm me"
---
"3 people over there while I kept the killer busy and no one broke noed"
---
A handful of survivors have a crappy mentality so you can either laugh at it or ignore it.
---
Sorry b0ss, it ended up being an ace
---
Maps like Haddonfield and Disturbed Ward are exceedingly survivor-sided even without Balanced Landing. It exacerbates the issue, sure, but it's hardly the full story. Maps like that simply don't work with the way the game is built, BL or otherwise. This is literally just a bandaid fix.
---
People D/C when its anything they dont like
---
It’s so nice when it works but so bad when it doesn’t
---
Respect for strangers has no place here. I can do as I please. So fuck off with your gospel esq responses
---
Poor taste in commemoration, yes, but he is losing the points he got in the match while doing it. If he wants to have fun, let him have it.
---
He also has a big stick thing
---
“I can basically run her round all game”, your words not mine. That’s why I said that. We are all experienced players we play both sides(most of us), we know what a spirit will try etc. Like if you’re injured and she has strider you’re fucked. But when healthy there are many things you can do but it’s too easy to play as her. I’ve got to rank 1 as spirit and have a good understanding of how to play her, yet playing against her there’s little to no counter if she has somewhat of a brain.
---
I'm playing both and I barley see killers facecamp, I do ignore the people after game but I'm just surprised by the consistency of the saltiness
---
Gonna cry?
---
I usally dont but i turned the whole game off . So igs thats a dc
---
Finally I’m sit tired of no mither
---
Thank you!
---
I main Adam too, I feel like not enough people appreciate him and his damn christmas sweater.
---
Me running from the killer in my thigh high suede boots and diamond studded barrette
---
Welcome to the family.
---
yep, been there. Solo queue survivor is wonderful. The other guy was probably TBagging at an exit gate even if the killer wasn't near there.
---
Licence holders say "You can use our character, but only under these conditions" and BHVR has decided the proposed conditions are unreasonable.
---
/u/Cheshire-Cad gave the example that a company could offer their character as a survivor, but don't want Plague to be able to face them. It would be ridiculous to force Plague players to switch if this hypothetically survivor joined the lobby, so BHVR wouldn't add that survivor
---
I swear it wasn't on purpose
---
Lol, no I didn't. You're a liar.
---
Nope
---
Ok, smartass. Let's see your ideas.
---
Guy has the rinnesharigan lol
---
I got the jeans jacket hoodie and dread costmetic on him. I never see any other Adam player with that cosmetic.
---
I certainly don't get it. Explain to me the logic behind healing against a killer whose power is a free injure? If there is no logic behind it, why would you run a perk that slows down an action that nobody will do?
---
Hell to the no.
---
Thats awesome
---
as usual
---
Lol true. His character is all ego so I get it
---
Did you see the edit? I put it in after the 2nd person told me that.
---
No hate here, but I personally think she has the [worst ass](https://i.imgur.com/T9drcoE.png) in the game.
---
She looks so silly
---
4 person SFW..... just the worst way to go
---
Feng: is chinese
---
everyone: yui, a japanese woman, is new feng
---
"... To submit a job application."
---
When you still haven't grown out of being an "epic troll XD"
---
wait I havent seen that one
---
Not saying it’s going to be a good perk, but Hemorrhage should actually be quite relevant on him, since he gathers blood for demon form.
---
r/dbdgonewild would like to know your location
---
Good job promoting being an asshole that's just what the community needs!
---
Survivors are just as toxic as killers.
---
Found one of the toxic pieces of shit everybody
---
I dont mind the messages, I was just wondering
---
Yeah I sure want to play Billy or Leatherface when the new guy can do [this.](https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel/clip/UninterestedLittleQueleaRedCoat?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
He's way better than you think. I expect him to get some nerfs before he goes live.
---
The bloodweb is endless. It allows you to get endless items and offerings just at the cost if bloodpoints. You get bloodpoints just by playing. If you bring in an item and die you lose it, if you escape you keep it and the charges are reset. The bloodweb also allows you to level perks up and make them better. Each survivor and killer has 3 personal perks and once you get the blood web for that character past 30 then other characters can be "taught" those perks and have them unlocked in their own bloodweb. Offerings disappear after every game no matter what. Once you get to level 50 on the bloodweb you have the ability to prestige which resets all you're perks and basically resets your character. However, the bloodweb has better stuff and you get a bloody cosmetic. The prestige is like in call of duty where all your stuff resets. Hope this helps
---
I’m just worried if the killers internet is shit and disconnect everyone the system will detect that as you doing it. As there is a way to dc as killer to make everyone else appear to dc and you get all the points
---
Agreed.
---
(Dead rising intensifies)
---
I think its called Canadian tuxedo
---
I think they're nerfing legion because of nemesis. Get pallet stunned and their deep wound starts going down in a chase.
---
Yes thats... the point... ?
---
And why I'd it easy to lose chase with a 125% Zkiller, ecsvgly?
---
Yes 
---
Get kills early on so there’s no survivors to open the exit gate therefore they can’t unhook
---
Who need a flashlight when you ARE THE FLASHLIGHT!
---
Yeah better than the other person I might add
---
Hello, great-great-great-grandad!
---
I agree. And had I did some toxic shit then I would’ve expected someone to be this kind of dbag
---
Creates blood orbs everywhere, no hit required.
---
Behavior doesn't really bend to whining, save for maybe Freddy launch (toxic design). I don't get why your so pessimistic. If he gets nerfed its because he deserves it. 
---
Considering he has god like tracking, conditionally great mobility, and one shots I doubt he will be nerfed for no reason if he's nerfed.
---
Billy but better.
---
Wondering when I'll meet the other half
---
I think you have to use the lunge attack while sprinting, I don't think just the sprint does it.
---
His mori is him just doing the sit on you execution.
---
Welcome to the internet
---
Maybe just maybe the day the dlc gets released they secretly add actual voice lines to her and that’s why she has place holder voice screams
---
So Myers can
---
-Hold t3 until right behind a survior in a chase and instadown mid-loop
---
-have rediced terror radius in t1 and t2
---
-super long t3 lunge range with no charge
---
-faster t3 vault
---
-can down and hook a survivor with out loosing t3
---
-use stalk to extend his t3
---
-no stun when leaving t3
---
It's Apples to Oranges mate
---
great, now i have to shell out money for feng even though yui will be out soon. either that or hope that lithe will be in the shrine.
---
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I IMAGINED after seeing gameplay and the mori.
---
You have way more control than billy. Look at [this.](https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel/clip/HyperMagnificentSkunkBuddhaBar?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time)
---
Billy doesn't even come close.
---
You gonna cry too?
---
I usually laugh it off, cause quite honestly? its hilarious.
---
I'm sure you don't l
---
I agree her asscheeks are beanbags.
---
You need to wait for like 2 to 3 seconds before moving
---
Sono chi no sadame!
---
***Seriously though it looks really amazing***
---
OHHHHH okay that outfit is hella gucci actually
---
aye man, rip ;_;
---
You still drop blood orbs with No mither. In fact, it's even worse coz he doesn't have to injure you first to make you start dropping them. It's a nerf to no mither if anything, lol.
---
*shits in the tall grass*
---
So am I and I have 500 hours lol, but on a serious note they're very rare but so great when you find them, like the guys who give you hatch or die to save you, as killer at most they'd give you a gg wp
---
Beast of Prey is bad because it requires bloodlust to activate. If you’re not a good killer and a chase takes you more than 15+ seconds to hit a survivor maybe it’s somewhat useful? Even then, it’s just bad.
---
Yeah fr. This is nothing I haven't seen in a million other basic, non-horror themed games with oni. Really disappointed. They really didn't put any effort into making it scary looking.
---
Yes, literally everyone has compared the two characters all day
---
whats wrong with haddonfield?
---
No, dont hook camp, It hurts you more than it helps. You could have applied pressure on the other 3 while the forth was on the hook, they only rushed you like that because you were focus on one kill.
---
I never see other adams use it. Just the starter one or the bloody presitege one. And one using the 80s fit that made him look like carlton from fresh prince
---
People said the same about plague, let's give him some time before we decide if he's OP. 
---
We won't know until about 2-3 weeks of people getting good with him and people being used to playing vs him
---
First they came for the fingers, then for the tongues!
---
Why is this NSFW?
---
No one escapes death. Unless they do bones
---
what's the second half?
---
Thanks, I'll give it a try
---
Literally nobody has ever said that
---
if I somehow knew ahead of time that the killer was going to do nothing but slug until we all bleed out, I still wouldn't bring buckle-up
---
Use Leatherface and hold the power button right in his/her face. Unleash it when someone is about to unhook. Even if they get the unhook, you’ll knock the other down right away
---
This is probably the most toxic thing you can possibly do.
---
Are you agreeing with me, or disagreeing with me?
---
With inner strength it's just 7 seconds with less risk of dying though.
---
The survivor perk is OP unless like 90% wiggle
---
When the game that has like 100,000 players goes down to like 40,000 players because the community is full of ragequitters the debate is going to be over anyway.
---
It looks dorky as shit like she's about to do a little dance lol, she should have phased through it
---
I think you shouldn't be able to see the aura of the blood orbs, but other than that he doesn't look any more objectionable than Billy.  The way it looks now, if you're injured, he has built in "I'm All Ears".
---
What separates a good looking ass from a bad looking ass?
---
I expect this to apply to killers who DC before the match even begins? Love spending 30+ minutes a night (as we are currently) trying to matchmake a SWF without the weak killers DCing in the lobby
---
With your sneaky build replace shadowborn for Predator. Can really help when you get that first hit.
---
Because with Thanatophobia and Pop, you can slow the game enough that survivors will want to heal. Since healing doesnt take long without Sloppy, Thanatophobia doesn't do anything. He's already hurt by perks like Inner Strength and Adrenaline.
---
Why would you ever intentionally go neat a pallet anyway?
---
Take my upvote, hero
---
If you're saying the clown is considered the worst then I'm disagreeing with you. 
---
With hindered he's incredibly capable at rank 1.
---
That too lol
---
Thanks for the phone background.
---
I’m cool with it being free tbh
---
Glad to hear you like it. :) I hadn't heard it until today, either. I was busy with... other things. :)
---
Probably easier to implement it across the board, but I don't think it really matters if Killers DC or not? They're only screwing themselves and everyone else gets free points.
---
I read it With noob3 voice
---
Jesus + Bob Ross = Jeff?
---
thanks for telling me what build to use next
---
Huntress and Nurse are, but they're special cases.
---
r/whatthefuck
---
Welcome to the dbd sub where new killers are both simultaneously OP and shit mere seconds after becoming playable
---
Tbh if it weren't for her hair and top I wouldn't even consider her, but she has a cool outfit, so here I am, having an existential crisis.
---
I, along with some other killers might swap a perk out for Franklin's and Lightborn if they see several flashlights or a key.
---
Don't survivors already "Bring a perk to counter toxic behavior" with Borrowed Time, Decisive Strike, etc?
---
I don't see anything wrong with slugging for a 4K given how strict pipping is at high ranks. Nobody is "held hostage" and survivors have at the very most 4 minutes. You don't want to be slugged bring unbreakable. Otherwise take even the smallest victory like 
---
crawling away when the killer is chasing the last survivor, managing to get so far away the killer can't find you when he comes back and then bleeding out into the dirt instead of being sacrificed, etc.
---
Good? You mean broken iridescent add on
---
I wrote Tim on accident. Fucking autocorrect
---
What !? Why !? Who !?
---
My Poor Legion....I....don’t get it BHVR.
---
You don't know what you're talking about
---
There are *maybe* 2 S-Tier killers
---
You don't know what literally means, there's not "literally" a petition involving 2k hour players calling him OP within hours of his release.
---
PTB isn't a good measure of how good or bad a killer is.
---
Other people are complaining about SWF deathsquads and not getting a single kill
---
This. Same. Shit. Happens. On. Every. Single. PTB.
---
Chill, give it 2 weeks in proper matchmaking and we'll find out once survivors know how to juke him and figure out how to get around his abilities  his "OPness" will drop considerably.
---
If there are some adjustments to be made they should be made then.
---
Yes sir
---
They are both also Um.. I got nothing
---
pallet: is picked up
---
oni:.....A
---
(　˙-˙　)
---
I think it's fine as is. Finally can deck the survivors that try to endlessly loop
---
idk when they said the ptb was "soon" it was the next day so who knows
---
I can’t load into a game as killer. 
---
I go to do it and the whole game crashes.
---
It is only by reading the perk that I gather that. Iirc, only Sloppy Butcher specifically calls out that the status effects lasts until fully healed, but there are also quite a few addons which have similar rules, so the precedent is there.
---
Omg is this the real monto
---
The Devs tend to be notoriously slow in regards to rework and sweeping changes for killers, i mean lets be real half the killer 'cubes' where QOL changes Masquerading as a Rework and Addons being made to compensate for weakness as opposed to shifting the base kit.
---
So yeah we may get a Legion cube maybe a year down the line but i assume its going to make him hyper add on reliant and at best maybe make him a Low B list killer.
---
very dbd related post
---
HAHA FUNNY CAT MEME
---
My last two matches were crap so I need a new build, any ideas ?
---
Nah just some random ancestor
---
Thanks for the offer, ill try to reach 18k but looks like an hard task lol i reached 9k After maybe a month
---
oh lawd he comin
---
Would No Mither counter?
---
I can p3 lvl 50 a killer without ever playing them, and saying that pig also got nerfed doesn't mean Legion should.
---
Oni can break pallets much faster, use his insta down faster, has better control his dash. At the cost of it being more limited.
---
Yeah, not sure defending toxic Survivors *telling me to kill myself* is it, chief.
---
Don't know if it's an option for you but since you haven't been playing long maybe switch to console. 90% less toxic. I play a ton and get maybe one message a week if even that. I know it is extremely toxic on PC comparatively.
---
Yes, they *should* have zero impact, but this is BHVR.
---
Also, shit like the stuff you mentioned is why I use game engines with delta time as a base feature
---
I saw I’m this on the for honor subreddits and didn’t think much of it, now the new killer has been announced and I think the dude who made it may have predicted the future...
---
Survivor: 
---
1) The first time you're injured, stop bleeding for 180 seconds.

She might be phasing, so you might jump to the other side of the pallet.
---
She might not be phasing, so you still might jump to other side of the pallet.
---
What part isn't a mindgame?
---
Sad to read that Legion got nerfed... Yep, LEGION
---
Let's review your first point-the killer sided endgame is there because there used to be hatch standoffs where either side would just stand there refusing to lose the game and lose the 4K. Now you can close hatch to force the game to end. If you failed to complete all 5 generators AND find hatch that means you didnt deserve the win. Another reason the endgame collapse is in the game is because players used to just hide when the exit gates were open with nothing to force them out. Keys existed before endgame collapse was a thing and they were always op because it cut your objective short. There is no cOunTeRplAy because as a killer you can camp hatch to make sure nobody uses a key on it and then the survivors do gens. But if you patrol gens they escape through hatch. 
---
They nerfed everything????? Wtf are you stupid. They nerfed balanced landing so it is an EXHAUSTION PERK. Which means it only works when you aren't exhausted. And they also nerfed the shit out of agitation and iron grasp. They nerfed the shit out of a lot of killer perks. 
---
Yeah they deleted the chase. But with all of the insta down abilities they require the killer to have skill. Huntress has reduced hatchets. Clown has to actually land a bottle hit which is pretty hard. Billy and LF have to charge the chainsaw and actually catch up to the survivor at the right time.  Red instaheals took no skill to use. Hold m1 and hit space after the killer downs someone while they clean their weapon. And good survivors can easily loop a killer for 3 gens and then get downed then insta heal completely eliminates the whole chase that just happened for the killer.
---
No just no
---
Except the kanabo is more dangerous
---
Oh he is definitely getting nerfed, but not to Oblivion. Any killer dropped with hard difficulty is supposed to be viable. They're the competitive killers. So for a potential need they're probably just gonna make it so hitting healthy survivors doesn't fill your gauge half way automatically
---
well no choice but to buy the son of a bitch and pour a few hours of work into him
---
So what's the joke
---
they're removing surviviors ability to play aggressively. in a few patches all i expect will be left is hide or die.
---
I'd be perfectly fine with that tbh.
---
Another valid use is on killers with insta downs, such as the Oni “Bam-Bam” Yakamuda himself, but I’m more thinking about good ol’ Bubba. Many survivors do not like to bother with healing against chainsaws, but unlike Billy or Bam-Bam, Bubba can lose a ton of distance due to exhaustion perks. 
---
So there *may* be a build for Bubba with BE playing a role in forcing survivors in deciding between doing gens or healing against a chainsaw. Maybe something like BE, PWYF, Ruin (or Pop), and perhaps Nemesis. 
---
I bring up Nemesis because I’ll bet (need to test this) that if you are in a chase and get pallet stunned, having Nemesis will while still in chase will give you give you the option to drop chase and get a PWYF stack right there. It’s a janky combo, but if it does work, then you get a very nice speed boost to regain chase and close the gap.
---
So basically, the killer can track blood?
---
Their getting fixed, how ?
---
You’re hired
---
yes
---
It looks like BHVR listened to my previous character concepts. This is all me, friends. You can thank me, polish my boots, wash my car if I had one. Yep, all thanks to me. Hehe. I'm number one.
---
This is cringe dude....
---
Mind game for spirit and nothing for survivors
---
What did their comment say?
---
That is Natalia Dyer the actor of Nancy wheeler
---
The difference between an A and an A+
---
It's gonna be real awkward when I come across survivors that wanted to farm and instead of just dcing I trudge through murdering them. I'll feel bad about it, but it's on them imo
---
hex: jinx
---
If he gets nerfed, I feel it would be pretty unnecessary. His power is technically inferior to (as i said) Hillbilly, and arguably weaker than Evil within level 3 (definitely weaker if you include the addons for evil within) and needs to be ‘charged’ although technically still easier to charge than Evil Within. It’s definitely stronger than say, Wraith, but I don’t think it’s nearly as strong as Nurse or Hillbilly. Maybe Leatherface level
---
This looks awful. I don’t understand why they won’t reuse her vaulting animation from the PTB that she was introduced in
---
Can't apply basic attack related perks, double hit addons are being changed to anyone who has killer instinct when hit gets it
---
tar bottle should be base
---
Overall he’s very powerful from what I’ve seen. Clearly survivors just shouldn’t get injured.
---
I can see a rework coming like reducing the amount of orbs created or increasing the amount needed for his power, or decreasing his power time. 
---
His perks are meh, they have good synergy with him (except that window one) and his add ons work well. 
---
Pretty happy, expecting a nerf but hopefully it’ll be small
---
Thank you, this is a sad time to be alive
---
Definietly higher than Leatherface but lower than Spirit, Nurse, Freddy, and Billy.
---
I'd say he has potential for top 5 but is about as strong as Mikey, Ghostface, and Huntress.
---
No, it seems you're the one ignoring me.
---
My point is that Balanced Landing in its previous state was a massive roadblock that restricted a lot of potential map designs and rework concepts. Now that, that is no longer the case, they can make changes unabated. This includes 'soft' infinites, with or without balanced landing.
---
I love the goggles and I love the hair but I wish she didn't have a penis. :\
---
Good for you you can chase someone while they have deep wound ls and kill them with beast of prey
---
No, only against bad spirits. Agood soirit will use your “counterplay” to bait you into making the wrong play.
---
It's because this tome is about Claudette and the Trapper. They're the only playable characters who have their lore revealed (The others being the Alchemist and the Entity). The next tomes will give you challenges and lore about other killers and survivors
---
I’m gonna sound like an idiot, but was that sarcasm ?
---
It’s probably because the current tome is about him and Claudette. When the next set of tomes comes out, it will probably favor a different killer and survivor.
---
This is a work of art on so many levels.
---
You messed up here, he wouldn't have gotten you if you didn't stagger for so long. You need to learn to play against him more before you call him OP.
---
Instantly thought of monto
---
Yeah, that’s not counterplay. That’s hoping the spirit doesn’t do well. Extending the chase by a single second is worthless, that’s why she needs proper changes
---
No, i was saying it's good he got a buff somewhat. Here's the notes

---
&gt;  It takes big companies years to implement crossplay
---
I'm talking about unique killers, not entire systems changes. Unique killer powers involve a LOT less work than implementing crossplay. You're honestly acting like creating a killer power that isn't a rehash of an already existing one is impossible for BHVR lol..
---
A counter to your disguiser "house rule" would be to give the killer the ability to point or do any gesture as well. Not too difficult of a problem to solve tbh.
---
&gt;Also, you keep saying killer A is a hybrid of killer B and C etc. But you can say that for almost any game with a lot of characters.
---
Not really though? Dota, LoL, Overwatch, all have tons of unique characters. On top of that, those games have to balance the characters against each other. BHVR has it easy with this game because they don't need to balance the killers against each other, they just need to balance the killers against a base survivor who can run around, throw pallets, and do generators. BHVR should have an *easier* time than the aforementioned games to come up with something unique because of this fact.
---
The duration didn't come into play tho, he had over half of his charge left. He'd 100% complete this whole action within 1 use of the power.
---
His only weakness so far seems to be having to hit someone to get his power. After the first hit he just snowballs like hell. He has no cooldown after ending/finishing the charge, he doesn't bump into walls when he runs straight into them in his charge, he has [10 time the turn control billy has](https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel/clip/HyperMagnificentSkunkBuddhaBar?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time) and he can [flick his power around corners.](https://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulHorribleWeaselNerfRedBlaster)

* Having an unintentional or passing resemblance to Dead by Daylight is not sufficient (e.g. real life hatchets, generators or pallets; the looping scene from the Scream movies; news articles that mention Dead by Daylight in passing, …).

---
Yea how dare they release counters to things. Ridiculous.
---
Wait is it out?!?
---
Dc duh.../s
---
Because survivor perks are able to be played across the game and killers powers are solely for that killer?
---
No better than any other exhaustion perk now sadly
---
I guess it's boring if you don't normally play Survivor or like it. But like others have said it's things you would normally do anyways. I mean you have two weeks or something to complete them so you don't have to grind necessarily.
---
Does it allow the killer to break it while you are working on it ?
---
lol definitely
---
&gt;everything breakout does
---
It does exactly two things, though. 20% increased wiggle speed is very little on its own.
---
No. Shard prices usually do not go down.
---
This likely wont happen
---
Being able to Do all the gens in five minutes is also healthy
---
Oh no it a good idea for many reason I would sh*t my pants out of pure terror because imagine doing a genny and you heard just stomping and then what if
---
You saw the mofo peaking around he corner yah this sound like a good idea
---
fucking terrifying. scariest thing in this game
---
I play both killer and survivor in the higher ranks. I'd like for you to explain to me how you consider Hag to be mobile in any way. She is 110% movement speed. Her traps only allow her to teleport 40 meters, and only if a survivor trips them, which means she can't use them to get around the map like Demogorgon, Billy, or Freddy can. She can be deadly on a small map like the game, or if she gets herself a three or four gen, but on a big map where survivors split up and do gens on opposite sides of the map, she's just fucked. There's nothing a Hag player can do to counter that; no matter how good they are, she just can't get around quick enough to stop gens getting done. Demogorgon doesn't have that problem because he is mobile enough to get around the map. Hag isn't bottom tier by any means, but Demogorgon just outclasses her.
---
As for Huntress, yeah she has a lot of weaknesses. Like Hag, she's screwed on big maps, but that's the case for the majority of killers, tbh. It just affects 110% killers more. Unlike Hag though, she can down you almost instantly if she catches you in a bad spot, can shut down any loop that she can see over, can zone survivors in just by holding up a hatchet, and is one of the few killers in the game who can effectively deal with platform generators (alongside Demogorgon, again, but also Freddy and Nurse). Yes, a really good Huntress will get crushed by really good survivors every time. So will a really good Hag, or a really good Demo. There are only two killers in the game for whom that isn't true, and I think everyone already knows who they are.
---
No I get that, but when you just wanna move on to another challenge already but you can’t
---
Just to make sure: If I go to PTB while having 1,000,000 bp on the actual client, do all my PTB shenanegans for a while, and then come back to the main client at the end of the PTB, I'll still have my 1,000,000 bp?
---
Its ok we dont need nice things.
---
Oh youre right...damn
---
Welp theirs goes nnn
---
AFAIK you just have to be injured, bleed frequency doesn’t matter. So No Mither would actually greatly help out Oni
---
I saw a video of this on this sub!!!
---
I’m stuck on the last challenge to blind the killer twice. Literally pull this off all the time but as soon as I highlight the challenge it’s franklins, tunneling killers, and moris. Tried all night to get it but no. Just gonna grind it out like all the others.
---
See that’s where you’re sarcasm is wrong my friend. There was no problem with counters, it was the fact that it’s all released at the same time whilst always benefiting the killer. You don’t see a counter at the same time as a perk/power that benefits the survivors very often.
---
I thought it was about Billy...never knew
---
&gt;Any sane dev would rather make a perk uselessly niche than balance the game whether or not that perk is involved, as it is not the source of the issue but simply exacerbates existing issues.
---
the ash sweater and bills are both dope
---
OP is spot on
---
so is oni a slug master? saw a video where his ability depletes when picking up a survivor. going to try the ptb when i get home
---
Yes. Nothing you do on the PTB will affect live whatsoever.
---
Tunneling killers make these so annoying lol! Just ask the killer if you can blind him twice for a challenge, whenever I need help that’s what I do and most times they’re chill about it. I love the dbd community cause they’re helpful.
---
0/10 just look at ghostface he not as thicc as his new classic cosmetic(just joking Those look awesome)
---
Yeah, and I can get that but that doesn’t explain the Discordance and Prove Thy Self being at the same time
---
It does deplete allbe it slowly and the more you charge or swing the faster it depletes. Each swing has cooldown and unlike other one shot killers his is more limited(except Michael) and the basic swing is very wonky looking on the killer side, not unusable but weird.
---
she hawt though so doesn't really matter,and ther will be recolors likely
---
From the PTB 3.4.0 patch notes:
---
“The conditions for Protection Hits have been adjusted. To trigger a Protection Hit a Survivor must be within range of a "Survivor in Need" which translates to being close to an Injured Survivor. Players can now trigger Protection Hits each 3 seconds instead of each 20 seconds. Any hit received by a Survivor while the Killer is carrying another Survivor will count as a Protection Hit.”
---
The whole trap four survivors in one game challenge is killing me. Even after watching some decent players to learn trap placement and picking up some decent addons to hide traps and set them up faster, everyone seems to be running small game. I'll get maybe two trapped survivors before most of my traps are sabotaged.
---
Did they say anything about clown reworks?
---
Tried him out today, his demon strikes break pallets like shred does.
---
Worse than most* considering there are only a few places in most maps it’s usable, will sprint burst DH have unlimited places to use it and Lithe has many spots/ pallets on maps
---
Idk how to find out who the killer is. Is it obvious or am I missing something?
---
I love Boil Over (in theory) but I can't even argue against this. I've only ever gotten Boil Over to work once or twice without sabo'ing hooks beforehand or at least doing unbreakable + flip flop to be prepared. I want Boil Over to be more effective so bad. I don't know if that means better hook aura blocking or something else.
---
well i mean that video would be right if it didnt call people who liked it that
---
I gave this suggestion to another player on here but ask the survivors if they could help you with your challenge! Most of the time dbd players are chill and will help you out
---
Suffering this great must be shielded
---
Wow you look pretty handsome and thicc
---
What are you even on about? Discordance was released because gens can literally get done in 20 seconds with multiple people on them and that perk is bhvr’s band-aide fix. Prove thyself got changed because it was fucking garbage. If you are afraid the killer has discordance just dont hop on a gen with someone its really that easy. Why wouldnt they release counters at the same time? You want something to go uncounterable for a period of time and then have a counter introduced later?
---
I was kidding because he got glitched into the ceiling
---
Lithe was always more reliable imo because every map has windows but the reduced stagger helped A LOT in certain circumstances.
---
That’s fair! :) it never hurts to ask.
---
I play on console and all I have to do is go to my profile when I’m in a lobby and I can see all the players including the killer, I’m not sure if you can view the killer through pc
---
Imagine his blight skin that going to be terrifying
---
Nemesis allows for constant use of PWYF, Pop to slow gens down, and you already know everyone is gonna heal as soon as possible. As well some blood orb frequency and pick up speed for the add-ons.
---
"Well adrenaline is next I guess" lmao yeah, it should be ya dunce. That perk is busted. DS next then BT.
---
Nerfing balanced?
---
One of her leaked cosmetics changes hair color
---
Most likely her hair was originally intended to be black but they changed it to blonde last minute.
---
I would rather her stand there for a while and then instantly appear on the other side.
---
She would look better with black hair anyways
---
Oh it's bad, doesnt fit her, its basically Freddy's animation. It was so cool to see her unique hatch close animation, I really hope they change this one to something more ''ghostly'' or creepy idk, she's a really creative character and deserves better
---
The BIG DICK STICK
---
I actually forgot about dcing because of how frequent they are, I down someone, grab him and he yeets himself out of my match
---
Now imagine a Billy that can drift left and right through the map, slide along walls, and pull a 180 lunge at a moment's notice during their sprint
---
I like to drop off the "botany knowledge" with "we're gonna live forever" for them extra spicy point gains.
---
Shirtless David is a manly skin for manly men.  Being seen across the map is intentional, as Shirtless Davids welcome the challenge.
---
How dare you?
---
 (but with my shirt off)
---
You're right in that she isn't mobile in the sense that she can autonomously traverse the map like Billy, absolutely. But she's moving about through traps perfectly well if you play her well. Demogorgon doesn't outclass her because his traversal is announced and slow and has a cooldown, and his chase power is subpar on top of that. Demogorgon can traverse, sure, but he gets nothing from the mobility because it's not threatening.
---
And yes, all killers get crushed by the best survivors, but the degree of which that is true (and to what extent this scales to "only" very good, good, decent survivors) can be discussed. 
---
Mobility means nothing if you can't do anything with what it gives you. Demo's mobility does nothing against even just competent survivors, at which point his only power is cutting shack a little shorter, maybe.
---
Still a feng main. yui doesn’t interest me
---
He was shocked so many times by the Doctor that he became a lightbulb.
---
It's so obvious that this animation doesn't match her that even the model's arms are deformed during it
---
Big oof
---
I don't stalk either. I use the stealth to juggle them. But this is what I meant about excuses. It's just whining. I can get pulled out consistently by competent players. But they'll blame the game and demand nerfs.
---
100% thought that’s monto
---
nah the sword had nothing to do with anything. Except one of his addons is a sword he broke, which may be the same sword that became an heirloom and eventually the spirit's weapon.
---
I can't think of any map in the game where this perk wouldn't be useful as a trapper.
---
Nice, Ash is a happy man now
---
One ugly mother fucker
---
Thanks I will try this next time!
---
kinda sad I saw this, no more imagining him looking like a badass chad with scars on his face
---
He...kinda already is a better Billy. Don’t shoot me
---
There's no fuckin way it does, this would literally break the game
---
[Insert Ghostface sigh here] okay so I’ll say this again but first, why are we starting to get upset... not once did I say anything upsetting like calm down, and just because I brought up the fact about perks and counters while using Discordance as an example doesn’t mean I’m scared of Discordance... it isn’t even run that much and even if it was who cares it’s Discordance, not overpowered. People can bring things up whilst not being personally involved in said thing, it’s an example. But anyways, once more, nothing wrong with counters, we need them in the game, hence most of the complaints come from not having counters to things... I’m saying why are these counters always a killer counter to survivor and not vice-versa.
---
Looks fitting to me.  Gives that creepy Japanese horror vibe with movies like The Grudge/Ring.
---
Stop
---
Because it’s an asymmetrical game and the killer is supposed to be more powerful than the survivors.
---
Survivor has anything slightly useful to help them in a chase.
---
The devs: NERF
---
Renjiro wore the mask himself in battle, Kazan hated the name Oni Yamaoka and the Entity is a bit of a dick so it decided to forever make Kazan an Oni, hence the moving Eye in the mask. He was proud of his family regardless so I doubt he would approve of the state the Yamaokas turned into over the years.
---
Ok. But Billy's saw is always on hand. Oni has to chase injured people and go around where they were just to build up his power and it takes a good amount. From the readiness difference alone Billy is superior just for being consistently threatening throughout the match
---
I'd say it's light brown not blonde but I guess it depends on lighting
---
Underwhelming imo
---
Copied from another user in another thread. Not my transcript:
---
**Honoring his family name was never enough for Kazan Yamaoka. He wanted to surpass his father's reputation and end what he saw as the thinning of samurai culture with farmers often posing as samurai. His father tried to turn Kazan's attention to more noble pursuits, but Kazan refused to heed his advice, and borrowing his father's katana, he embarked on a dark pilgrimage to prove his worth and rid Japan of imposters. Ignoring the code that had been taught to him, Kazan killed imposters in the hills and the valleys, on the beaches and in the woodland. The killings were brutal, cruel and morbid. He humiliated farmers and warriors alike, yanking off their topknots and stripping them of their armor. His rage, bloodlust and perverse sense of honor knew no bounds. Monks believed he was possessed by something dark and otherwordly and cursed him while a noble lord began to call him 'Oni-Yamaoka,' the rageful Samurai, an insult both to Kazan and his family.
---
Determined to redeem his family's name, Kazan now butchered anyone who dared to call him Oni-Yamaoka. The insult confused him. He had defeated the best and had purified the samurai class by ridding the land of imposters. How could anyone refer to him as an ogre? Had it been because he had marched onto a battlefield to cut down the fiercest warriors. Had it been because he had taken a akanabo and dashed hundreds of skulls with it? Or had it been because of his need to secure a 'trophy' from his victims. It didn't matter. Being called an ogre was more than he could bear and an ominous voice in his head urged him to strike down the lord who has desecrated his name.
---
As Kazan made for the lord's town, he suddenly found himself face to face with a samurai standing on a dirt road, blocking his way. Kazan readied his kanabo. Without a word, the smaurai attacked and quickly secured the upper hand. But he hesitated. With a devastating blow, Kazan crused the samurai's head and cracked his helmet. As Kazan approached the fallen samurai, he saw his father's face and staggered back to his haunches. His father stared at Kazan with mingled shame and regret as he issued his last breath. Kazan closed his eyes and screamed in agony until he could scream no more. When he opened his eyes again...his father was gone. Not only had he killed his faather, but he had allowed thieves to steal his body for armor.
---
Bitted , lost and disillusioned, Kazan roamed the land aimlessly with his father's voice rattling in his head, taunting him, reminding him of his failures, sending him into fits of uncontrollable black rage. One day, walking in the woods, Kazan happened upon an Oni statue. He stopped and stood motionless for a long moment. The weathered and overgrown statue seemed to be ridiculing him, accusing hi of being the imposter samurai he had so desperately sought to destroy. Kazan shook the laughing voice out of his head and half remembered the lord who had ridiculed him as 'Oni-Yamaoka.'
---
With renewed anger, Kazan journeyd to a town high up in the snowy mountains where the lord resided. A dozen samurai met Kazan at the gates of the town. A dozen samurai fell to his kanabo. His speed and stregth were unmatched. His rage was incomprehensible. Covered in blood and gore, Kazan battled through the town and soon found the lord hiding in a villa. He dragged him out of a cabinet, sliced his tendons to immobilize him and watched him beg and squirm like a dog. Without hesitation, he thrust his fist into the lordäs mouth and yanked out the wicked tongue that had desecrated his name.
---
Satisfied, Kazan exited the villa to find himself surrounded by dozens of farmers wielding rusted scythes, sharp pitchforks, and heavy clubs. He survived the first few assaults, but there were too many attackers coming from every direction. Within moments Kazan was on the ground staring at a cold, indifferent, darkening sky as farmers took turns stabbing and torturing the 'Oni' who had butchered their beloved lord. The frenzied mob dragged Kazan into a small stone mill to continue the tortute and finally left him to die a slow, agonizing death. When they returned, the mill was filled with a strange black fog and Kazan's body and the kanabo were nowhere to be found. It was the beginning of a dark legend about a rageful Oni haunting the town**
---
Yeah, you got me there mate... I will try to improve my gameplay
---
The window isn't perfectly aligned with the wall. If you look at the bottom of the windowsill, you can see the bottom cut-out where the window should actually be. So basically the frame is 2-3 inches above the bottom of the window. You can see the roof outside through it.
---
Woah CuteC3 finally getting into DBD niceeee I love your work and baby dwights are fricken adorable you drew it very close to their resemblance haha
---
Just FYI ‘Lucky Break’ isn’t once per trial. It’s a total of 120 seconds per trial. For example:
---
You get hit, it takes you 40 seconds to escape the chase and get healed up. You now have 80s worth of no-bleeding left
---
True but that’s why they have ability’s AND 4 perks, to give them a leg up. And I’m not really touching on power it’s more so that survivors can have counters to killers whilst the killers still being more powerful, look at every horror movie for example.
---
Watch any competent killer streamer and you will see he's gonna need a Nerf, not a huge one but a Nerf. Currently He has God tier tracking without perks, an easier to land insta down than any other killer that can down multiple people at once, great map pressure, pallet deletion and better than huntress snowball potential. He's very easy to keep pressure up with.
---
Trapper in a nutshell
---

40 seconds
---
It's not even the fact that reworking a portion of the map would take time; it's the fact that without balanced landing, THERE IS NO HADDONFIELD INFINITE! People are acting like the perk should go back to the way it was and the map should be changed, but that is just stupid backwards logic because the perk itself ALLOWS for the infinite to exist. So therefore the perk should be nerfed, and it was. Good day lmao
---
There's a prequel reference for this and I can't think of it
---
halloween event is boring and the last one was way better
---
Also...dental plan
---
Clown is really old tho, and judging by Kate's clothes, she seems to be more.. recent
---
Perks should be good by themselves not only work with other perks. Their either running out of ideas or their just lazy cause these perks aren't unique in anyway. Only like two perks from the killer and survivor combined are actually good.
---
Man I don't even know if BHVR knows what they're doing.
---
Seems like the age old problem of different teams working on different things with absolutely no communication between them.
---
Nerfing all exhaustion perks into eventual oblivion = balanced gameplay
---
Next we need to nerf no mither
---
How does it work in the PTB? Is it going to be meta again?
---
I am so pumped they're doing sweaters again this year ❤
---
Better idea. Furtive Chase with Make Your Choice. Find obsession win game.
---
&gt; survivors move faster than killers 
---
&gt; can literally run in a straight line to get away
---
Can’t remember
---
she should crawl through it all creepy ring girl style
---
Ah, now I see it. As far as I’m aware that’s new, I’ve never noticed it before
---
“Always look on the Dwight side of life”
---
There's no way this is making it through the PTB
---
Did one of them have potato in there name? Could have been me and my group of friends haha :p
---
That was monto
---
This is pretty embarrassing tbh
---
No unfortunately no 😝
---
Carl needs to become the next survivor!
---
You're cringe dude
---
Sloppy Butcher used to apply on non-basic attacks, I just didn't know it apparently now doesn't anmore. If anything, that's an unnecessary nerf to the perk that should be revised.
---
But like I said, I really don't think "anti-heal" builds are good on Legion. Good survivors do not heal against Legion to begin with, precisely because it is regularly a waste of time given that Legion can just injure them again with inescapable ease. Butcher also merely adds 4 seconds per heal, so even in the cases where survivors do heal against Legion for one reason or another, it's not as impactful as people make it out to be. I've always seen Butcher as a perk that increases pressure and snowball potential more so than a stalling perk, by keeping survivors injured, but Legion can literally do that with his ability.
---
I don't think the Beast Of Prey/Nemesis interaction with Legion will be gimmicky, but downright broken. To an extent where I think they cannot release them like that. Either way, I think Blood Echo will be great on Legion - since you will regularly have multiple if not all survivors injured, Blood Echo can more or less take Exhaustion perks out of the round entirely, starting with your first hook. Or at least forcing survivors to heal up, which again, is also great for Legion, since healing takes survivors way more time than it does Legion to injure them again.
---
Souka.
---
We gunna talk about this is completely countered if you just dont pallet stun
---
woah im in this one.
---
I looked for this reply. Thank you.
---
I think he's supposed to be a very distant ancestor.
---
Since the STBFL nerf was for 'consistency' purposes, part of me hopes this perk was meant to help to negate the nerf?? But that might just be wishful thinking that BHVR knew this was gonna happen lol
---
It’s any stun
---
He doesn't track while transformed.
---
Obviously ya dummy, everyone switched factions
---
GROOVY
---
scp 173 confirmed next killer? Not clickbait huge leak?
---
Sounds about right
---
I doubt BHVR knew what they were doing, they hardly do. I never thought I would see devs more concerned about consistency then actual balance. Legion is the worst killer in the game, there’s no reason to nerf him more because his power is “inconsistant”
---
Dang haha
---
Dwight has officially ascended.
---
Freddy with Nemesis/Furtive Chase/Make Your Choice/Haunted Grounds and Black Box add-on = instant 4k
---
they buffed hex: the third seal?
---
That’s not practical
---
Thank you! Damn he’s brutal, can’t wait to get my hands on this chapter!
---
you guys are mad about the two being annoying but this is a custom game with friends haha
---
I have already said I didn’t mean they are necessarily right when they said a disguise killer won’t work. I mean they did looked into the idea and made some analysis. Please read before you reply would you?
---
I haven’t said creating a refreshing killer ability is the same as crossplay. What I am saying is you cannot copy paste things from one platform to another easily. And it may surprise you but the game DBD is build on a pretty shitty engine without brilliant coding optimization. Implementing complicated ideas such as “disguise” which requires complex visual effect, would pretty much require them to rebuild the whole game again which requires a lot of money resources and human power.
---
And it is interesting you brought up lol, overwatch and dota. In lol, people complaining about them copying ideas from other games since the birth of the game. People complaining about all heroes being the same all the time. If you look through heroes in lol, a large portion of them are build out of one prototype, and are extremely similar. People just play whoever is the strongest at the moment. 
---
Overwatch has 30 or 31 heroes that falls into 3 categories, so each category would only have 10 heroes if split equally, which is about 60% of the number of killers. Yet a lot of heroes still share a ton of similarities. For example, ash is more of a hybrid between Mercee and widow according to your standard. Mini dva and mercy has the same gun according to your standard. Sigma and Zarya have shields that gains power depending on amount of stuff they absorb etc... 
---
In dota, there’s a ton of heroes all have the similar blink power or teleport power. Many stun abilities, aoe abilities are extremely identical. etc... 
---
Yeah there are unique designs in those games, so is in DBD. To say that those games have heroes all unique to each other but DBD has a bunch of “hybrids” is either oblivious or double-standard.
---
Could you elaborate more?
---
Nice trapper mask for the comic
---
I wonder if this is gonna make it through the PTB without major nerfs to Nemesis and/or Legion but tbh I doubt it.
---
I really hope they don't continue to nerf Legion into oblivion, this perk is a decent way to negate the STBFL Legion nerf and bring back Legion into the realm of viability. 
---
Based on this clip, Legion is only deadly when using up one of his perk slots *and* using decent add-ons. How much different is that from using add-ons like iridescent head on Huntress? Imo this seems like a good thing if it stays (with tweaking ofc)
---
Pretty good job so fa-AAHHHHHH!
---
SCP chapter with 173 would be dope. Can move by teleporting but only outside of survivors FOV. That would be some terrifying shit.
---
People will demand nerfs and BHVR will listen
---
smol uwu bean  and oni-chan
---
That seemed fine to me tbh
---
Thank, ok you?
---
Yep it’s so stupid, if they keep nerfing killers jus because ppl dc or all the shitty toxic survivor mains demand nerfs, the game will just eventually die bro.
---
I wouldn't get too excited.  He's potentially somewhat effective; BHVR will gut him pre-launch.
---
It says the file might cause harm to my device so Ill wait lmao
---
Also Frank's Mixtape and Stab Wound Study will be suddenly "Viable" again.
---
They should give her the demogorgon vault animation
---
Interesting. How would you change this?
---
You're not the first and you're definitely not the last but THIS made me giggle
---
You have to hold the pallet for 3 seconds to get it back up
---
finally i can play susie AND be viable
---
r/ahego
---
good guess but ghostface actually
---
Im actually not a fan. I get that he's supposed to be a Japanese killer and Oni just means demon but it looks like they just had bunch of weebs design him. He's not creepy or scary like the others he looks like something out of DBZ. Could have been designed better imo
---
Went to college for game design.  Did my best work with 3d models and textures.  It's really not that hard. The head is already detached and all they would have to do is replace the head model with just a neck. And some gore texture.  Pretty basic shit imo
---
How so? That is literally a better version of billy and also a bubba at the same time. Its ridiculous.
---
What’s with the title?
---
Please forgive me for this but who's Joey? I'm really confused
---
Alright this is just cringey.
---
Better to release a strong killer than to release yet another Freddy/Legion/Pig
---
Why would you signal someone that everything's fine? That would mean you constantly are spamming it. That doesn't make sense. If someone is spamming the hook I'm staying on a gen
---
Can't believe I see someone mentioning Nosgoth in 2019, close to 2020. Miss that game :(
---
That's the idea, because you cant normally spectate the killer, so this bug is the only true way to see what killers perspective in 3rd person  would be like
---
What have you brought upon this cursed land
---
STBFL, Infectious Fright, Sloppy Butcher, Thanataphobia, I’m All Ears, BBQ &amp; Chili
---
Most likely
---
Stuff like sloppy and thanataphobia with dying light. Keep them injured to slow the game down. Just try to stack hooks faster than they can power through gens with all the slowdown you’ve got
---
No thats how the Yakuza works

The 3rd person killer crap has been going on for nearly a year.
---
Y'all just ignant.
---
funny thing, even if they introduce the DW timer pausing in chase, they can just moonwalk again like earlier this year.
---
This boy ain't right 
---
He's flawed
---
They also reduced the time needed to mend deep wound by 20%, which is faster if someone else mends you now (not sure if that's a change from before).
---
Either way you’re a dick my dude
---
Shugoki looks nice
---
Am I missing something or the Oni is just Billy but with fuel needed?
---
I know I’m probably alone in this but I hate this fucking killer. His lore, his op Billy charge, his Medal of Honor knockoff looking ass, the whole thing feels lazy. My shitty opinion. Everyone else enjoy.
---
Oh lol, so people just switched to the winning side when the going got tough? SHAME. Samurai for life!
---
Yeah that’s why he said “oh wait wrong streamer”
---
did he do it today and can you link me the vod?
---
If you own the killer that the splinter is assigned to and load them up with a build and cosmetics, then using their splinter offering will use the build you have for them.
---
As a Feng main. I’m screaming.
---
He doesn't have a point. This has nothing to do with moris. You want to remove moris that's a different topic all together. Having one broken game mechanic doesn't make another one ok. This is about keys which allows multiple survivors to escape without doing their objective with close to zero counterplay. And as I said you can't play killer and find a mori in a chest.
---
It can be done, same as playing around Spirit Fury, but it's going to cut loops much shorter and the Legion can yeet themselves over the donwed pallet for a free hit, so you're still screwed.
---
DS did something for yeaaaaaars, that didn't negate its change being deserved.
---
I want it
---
prove thyself XD
---
You can buy them with shards. Not a big deal
---
"A handful", he says.  I want your survivors.   The absolute best I get is on very, very.....\*very\* rare occasions if I stomp them so bad they were embarrassed, they keep their mouths shut.  Otherwise it's fuck you, piece of shit, kill yourself, all day long.  
---
And OP I admire your optimism, it gets signifigantly worse at higher ranks.
---
Tru3talent has a video explaining how to counter her good
---
Oh, okay! I just figured it would clear the killer of any perks or add ons anyways, but good to know in the future. Thanks!
---
Thanks
---
Well, aren't you a Smart Ace
---
Why would you show an alternative cosmetic on the official splashart though??
---
Especially if you have to pay for dark hair.

---
No, my friend sent me a screenshot saying he was thinking of trying this and I realized how stupid it would be. I just want to know if it works. If Decisive causes oblivious, why wouldnt Furtive work?
---
It breaks my heart to retire Feng. Yui is my baby now.
---
They do not balance out. You honestly think moris are more op then keys? To even use a mori you have to down a survivor twice. As survivor you can bring or find a key and just hide until gens are done and escape without doing any of your objective.
---
You're talking about a playerbase that got coddled and handheld for 2 1/2 years, many of whom run nothing but crutch perks because getting better at running in circles is too hard. This same playerbase who left 550+ negative reviews on the day BHVR said they were thinking about changing DS. They're entitled beyond belief.
---
Mindbreaker: Mindbreaker
---
Blood Echo: the cooler Mindbreaker
---
He's essentially saying that keys are the survivor equivalent of moris. Keys do make it to where survivors have an easy escape, but only once they do the objective partially. The same thing for moris. You only have to hook someone once and then they can be full dead, rather than them being on the hook two minutes or three times. The fact that moris exist works to balance out the existence of a key. You see a key in the lobby? Equip a mori. Another argument you had was it having no counterplay. Neither does a mori.
---
A hottie
---
Hype/Wanting Money like every company
---
***companies need moneh to survive***
---
Op
---
And falls to minecraft
---
I think it’s just a tricky balancing act. For killer you really only have to worry about how that will work for him in a broad sense, whereas with survivors you have to consider how it works with 3 other survivors and their other perks. Or look at it as how it synergizes with 3 other perks for the killer, vs 15 other perks for survivors.
---
You could signal that the coast is clear if:
---
· No one is coming to get you out because they already think that someone is gonna unhook you
---
· Someone is hesitant to get you out because they think that the killer is near
---
· Some survivor decides to walk towards you when you're about to hit second state so you're trying to tell them to hurry
---
Honestly there are a lot of situations on which you could make those signals, and in the same way that you are staying on a gen if someone is spamming the hook, other survivors could try to get to the hook if they see someone spamming.
---
 I could see this argument being made if we had our emotes of pointing and waving while we're on first state, but if we can only left click to communicate, then theres no way a random survivor will know what we are trying to say
---
DS is better now than it used to be so honestly I consider it a buff 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
You know it's a joke right?
---
You do realize each hero in those games have way more hero power and the games are in a competitive setting with complicated game mechanisms, where as BDB is a casual game that is designed to be easy to understand and intuitive to play. Yeah, having 4 abilities and 1 passive all identical to another hero is of course way harder, but not so much when you are trying to design killers that only have 1-2 power. Also, if you say you never heard those complains, I am done taking with you. I played dota dota2 extensively. I played lol for the first a few years, and I played ow since release. What I heard are totally different stories.
---
"It's dead hard, then."
---
Do you not see how they are basically the equivalent to each other though? That's why people are mentioning moris
---
Yea he's a slugging machine. I love it too but its a necessary nerf
---
He looks amazing
---
My first impressions are that he’s mediocre
---
Excuse me? How is bt nerfed?
---
Sounds pretty Overpowered and not very unique.
---
Yes you can. You can A- not unhook them so if the killer is camping waste 2 minutes of their time. B- use borrowed time, instant medkit borrowed time, adrenaline if timed right, body block for them. I don't main anything but I'm red rank survivor and only rank 8 killer. You would rather turn this into a red vs blue then just be honest and admit how broken keys are.
---
I have a wonderful collecting of disconnects from my plague matches. Perhaps I can retire collecting the disconnects now.
---
Just to be sure breakout doesn't stack with someone else using it right? RIGHT??
---
Nah keys are fine nerf legion
---
:D
---
Oh you want to speak to the manager call the manager you see Oni come from the back with a giant back VIBE CHECK TIME
---
Getting some heavy Baader Meinhof effect vibes in this thread. The song everyone is referencing here was on the radio just earlier today, and I looked it up and properly listened to it for the first time.
---
Throw piggy in their as well.
---
The blood orbs disappear when you activate your Shugoki power is what I meant. The additional tracking feature Oni has.
---
He too thicc
---
I think they're both broken at times. I also think your b is a super crazy suggestion and makes it seem like you really dont play survivor, when the hell would that play ever happen dude?
---
A real ogre
---
Thicccc with an extra c
---
THANK YOU. I said something similar and I know I’m going to get downvoted to hell but this looks stupid as fuck. It looks like they took a dude from Medal of Honor and threw it in DBD. Lazy and boring.
---
Survivors don’t get insta downed
---
Tier 3 is two minutes
---
i too play shirtless David. A small price to pay for salvation
---
Thanataphobia is useless against a toxic no mither gen rusher with resilience and a toolbox
---
No vod. [Youtube okay?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgSkP4bZy9o)
---
I don't see them that way. Mori= down a survivor twice then spend 10 seconds in an animation to kill them. Key- be alive when 2 or more gens are done. There is counterplay to moris, body block borrowed time, instant borrowed time med kit, adrenaline etc. What is the counter to 3 genning 3 survivors and having hatch spawn across the map?
---
I wouldnt mind if they TEAM up with DC and bring the shade into the game
---
Oh I understand.
---
Glad there is something to compensate for the fact he has to earn and collect his power over time! 
---
I'll find a way to play around it Lol
---
Old BT? What? Old bt sucked. One time use only and the killer could chase you until the timer goes down, its only advantage was that both players had the protection
---
???????? ITS A HORROR GAME killers are supposed to be scary god of all the complaints I’ve heard “killers shouldn’t be scary” was never one I thought I’d heard XD you play killer to be scary and threatening with this fucking genius logic next killer should be normal dude with butter knife considering BHVR shouldn’t be making killers scary also HOW DOES THIS TAKE AWAY ANYTHING FROM THE GAME the new killer is still a powerful fun killer
---
Switch Ruin for Devour Hope for the style points.
---
What makes it op? It’s not a one shot
---
Someone didn't folloe the directions, if you're trying to justify it, just don't.
---
I agree it was a strong play but definitely not because his power is op
---
You can do that with without a key... it's called being a shitty teammate
---
Throw in the reworked Beast of Prey and you’re screwed no matter what
---
Also do perks that lessen your blood trace effect the blood orbs?
---
You kill the person that has the key right away if you see it in the pregame, and again dude unless someone is an swf you're coming up with the craziest counterplay just to say you can somehow beat a mori
---
What the hell is this killer
---
Yes and to use a key with over 2 people there need to be at least 3 gens done.  I think they are as op as keys considering they both GREATLY shorten the game length.  If you bring an ebony there’s an extremely low chance more than one person survives and thats solely by hatch escape.  Including the fact if one survive is killed off early the chance of survival greatly decreases.
---
Nono, this is not okay. Many reliable streamers who have been around since 2016 and are killer mains are stating this. It needs a huge nerf. https://clips.twitch.tv/AntediluvianMistyVampireOneHand
---
It be like spongebob and plankton F is for friendship imagine a animation like that
---
About ducking time. I swear, it’s started to skyrocket right after the last rank reset.
---
I feel your pain. Feng is the only survivor I have gotten to even regular level 50(she’s P3 now of course) so it’s hard time for is all
---
You must not be very good at survivor or only play solo then. If we know the killer has a mori which you do know, first off you don't save until last second of the struggle, then you don't save unless you have borrowed time, and if you unhook someone with the killer nearby and don't bodyblock you are an asshole, even more so if you know they have a mori. Sounds like you need to play with a decent team if you seriously haven't tried any of those strategies.
---
He wasnt defending moris. Hes just trying to talk about keys but everytime someone does that people just start reeeing about moris. Moris are busted but thats not what he was talking about right now.
---
Definitely, most absolutely worth it. If they hypothetically skipped the next chapter, and had a graphics/lighting overhaul, plus optimization of the games spaghetti code, and reworked the Chainsaw killers and buffed many weak perks; this game would be so much more enjoyable.
---
That’s fecking terrifying and i live it i hope it’s like one sided or something to make the spook factor very high
---
Wait what?
---
Cough cough “”””Legion buff””””cough cough
---
Well now this post has gotta be pretty awkward for ya, bub
---
No, Trapper in a nutshell is: 
---
Survivor farts, counters Trapper.
---
Sadly there are some legion mains that think the survivor going down that easily with no counterplay is balanced...
---
ye
---
I play solo and you're straight up coming up with a crazy play to say moris have a counter, they dont dude, if the killer wants to use it they will unless they're the worst killer ever.
---
Legion addon buff
---
If you're going in blind for the first time it can be, obviously. But I don't consider outlast particularly scary either since every iteration has been predictable jumpscares and not much more. Despite outlast 2's attempts at changing that.
---
Being used to disrespect isn't the point, the disrespect is the point.
---
New perk, Nemesis, I think combined with stab wounds study and Frank's mixtape brings back the original Legion but with less stabs required. Otz did the vid on it
---
You could always kill the person running the key that’s the major drawback to  even running a key. It’s like noed it sucks but it’s relatively counterable
---
I feel like they should do something about the blood orbs. Either decrease the frequency of blood orb spawns, or decrease amount of power they give. I play almost exclusively killer, btw, so no bias here.
---
You know... I do see a number of holes in that pallet... Brb
---
Groovy
---
And of course we don't get a new map, they're just going to add something to the Yamaoka one like they did with the Plague map. So lazy.
---
I gotta test this once it comes out.
---
Except dark hair isn't objectively better than blonde hair, so thats a total conspiracy as to why she has the wrong hair color. And intentional false advertising is pretty fucked up.
---
Most likely it was not intentional, there's no businessmen reason for it, they just changed her hair last minute and didn't edit the chapter splashart, but it should still be changed.
---
I know but hes defending them as if keys are broken but they're not, which is why the conversation has kind of changed to them being equivalent in a lot of peoples eyes
---
Ok so I camp the person with the key and then camp the hook where they died the rest of the game? How bout a survivor finds a key in a chest while you are chasing another survivor? What then? The counterplay I am talking about is not crazy at all, it is simply what you do as a team when going against a mori. I have done it as a team and I have gone against a team countering mine. You for real think it is crazy? It's what you do lol.
---
Holly shit
---
This Dweet skin is mine
---
Let me just whip out a flintlock pistol and blast the fuck out of some scrub survivors
---
Right i dnt understand why people are asking for an already shirtless killer to be shirtless XD
---
ummm it makes the progress bar red
---
FOREVER.
---
that's busted
---
I was thinking like a cutlass but hell yeah let's shoot the dweets
---
Bro r/dbdgonewile is going to go sicko mode
---
Except I did none of those things :) engaging with people is a way to change behavior rather successfully provided that people are reasonable, and I like to believe that there are plenty of survivors that just never play killer and need a reminder of killer perspective.  So yes there is a point.
---
4 hrs. One game. Just infinite lobbys. Switch is fuckered
---
Still useful, sure, but it's not better. It's not that hard to play around it  now and any halfway decent Killer who has played for a bit knows how to. The only real counter before was something the Killer couldn't exactly control, so. 
---
And it was pretty much guaranteed all 4 people, every single match, would have the damn thing. Nowadays, not so much.
---
The counter to pop is not getting hooked. But for real, how are you going to complain that killers get the better counters and survivors get nothing and not have an example? You do realize that killers are the ones that need counters more so right? If survivors got a favorable counter always, killers would be useless. It's a 4v1. The killer should be the power role, which sadly it isnt for 90% of them.
---
Moris are not a 100 percent guarantee. If you camp and tunnel sure you might get close to 100 percent but in the time you are wasting the gens should be done rather soon after getting the mori.
---
She does look nice but not Kate nice. ;)
---
I find it’s super useful now. Has saved me so many times. But to each their own.
---
The question is. How would they change this?
---
I think he fits really well even having the blue skin to connect him to the spirit and him having a really thrown together mess of stuff on him fits his story with him collecting trophy from victims
---
All killer should get a Christmas sweater Myers Clown Bubba Ghostface every killer need to be warm especially trapper he’s  wearing overall he needs something
---
Warm
---
I think at this point with the Oni swords are over done let’s just have him use a hook hand the spin it around for his weapon wipe of animation and we could add some secondary abilities with his pistol maybe something to do with rum or parrots
---
yeah, a good killer will dominate bad survivors but optimal survivors will destroy a killer that doesn't take advantage of their mistakes. 
---
i dont know about bbq, not too bad imo but ruin and slugging is a big issue because all 3 survivors on gens for a single good chase will finish very quick. so ruin slows that game down to get the killer momentum at least. (if your bad at hitting greats)
---
Survivor at higher ranks, optimal,  can dominate killers  without  high mobility or gen pressure. 
---
but everything can and will be abused for the advantage of both sides, just luck other times
---
It seriously doesn't matter who you get paired with, if you are good you will climb if you are bad you will stay at that rank
---
So you get two girls mixed up and got a tranny preop.
---
I think he meant like, money-bought DLC killers, like Bubba and Ghostface.
---
I keep seeing people calling the new character “Kimura”. Kimura is a very common Kapanese surname. 
---
Her first name is Yui. Depending on the Kanji, her name could mean “supportive” “sole” “unique” “alone”.
---
If its nauseatingly popular and its been out nearly a year how is it not fixed?
---
Ah yes, being able to be one shottied is very powerful indeed. Why, I'd even say just wait for the dead hard and boom... their down. I understand no mither does counter things like plague and legion, but you can be downed in one shot, and if the killer is dumb and doesn't pick you up, then you are basically always easially killable(unless you're really good at looping). This is imo, so please don't tell at me.
---
I shall don my oni cosplay and hunt this bastard down like the lord that kazan did
---
Yeah, that was the biggest reason I ran it. Without that effect I don't think I'll be using it from now on.
---
unpopular opinion: balanced landing didn't act like a normal exhaustion perk and even when exhausted gave the survivors a massive advantage, this nerf is more then justified  
---
feel free to downvote me to oblivion for exposing the truth
---
Give the good changes get rid of all the stupid bullshit changes like really BHVR are you that incompetent that you nerfed Legion on all fronts when literally everyone wanted buffs and I mean flat buffs not buffs with a bunch of nerfs why do they go so hard on nerfs but then pussy foot around buffs
---
I never said tunneling or camping, If a survivor you hooked gets down again they are getting morid.  That is a 100%.
---
I hate to say but balanced needed a nerf it was too strong in the meta and made too many loops infinites

He definetely needs a nerf.His snowball potential is huge.He is way better than Billy and much easier to use.He is God tier at tracking.This guy is probably in the TOP 3.
---
Most exhaustion perks were broken though. They deserved the nerfs. Balanced is currently the most op exhaustion perk and deserves the nerf as well. I dont see the problem.
---
That still only kind of works. You can pick up a key from a dead body, you can find a key in a chest. Plus I'm not going to waste time camping and tunneling a hook while letting the gens get done. Not you but everyone else wants to bring up moris fine, get rid of them if it means getting rid of free escapes by survivors who played poorly.
---
I think it's crazy because it's something I've never seen someone do for me and I've played probably 3k hours in red ranks. Unless you're an swf nobody will have the communication possible to pull what you mentioned off. Have you honestly ever seen that happen when it wasnt swf? Plus you're naming perks to work against a mori but dont like the mention of just using Franklin's for your problem.
---
You think marketing is a conspiracy on the most heavily censored site on the internet? Ok dolt.

Holy shit this is the definition pf blood lust

so instead of fixing haddonfield (the only map where BL is actually stupidly op) they put a band-aid on it by nerfing the most situational exhaustion perk? great

No mercy
---
Weak... makes faking fazing through windows obsolete now.
---
Moris and keys are equivalent in many peoples eyes.  Greatly shortening the game due to an offering or item is stupid but there’s a way on both sides so arguing both being broken is a much more reasonable argument
---
Can should be blue because shes a blueberry bitch lol
---
So actually I had this happen toe as a survivor on the ptb so it's a map glitch, not the oni itself

That's what they are, though. Like, mindgames in a fighting game point of view is constantly doing different things, to keep the opponent guessing. If you don't have to guess, then in theory, any good player can completely counter what you can do.
---
Don't get me wrong, Spirit had some bullshit things (pre nerf prayer beads) but I think her having the upper hand and forcing survivors to do more than just run circles all game is good for the game.
---
"You kids sure this isnt just tall grass?"
---
There’s been a lot of crossover memes from for honor and dbd
---
Maybe it's because I like to play as swf. You should really try it sometime. Franklin's isn't even a counter. If it broke the key in one hit it still wouldn't be a complete counter because you just find a damn key in a chest. And again if you want to talk about moris that's a different topic all together.
---
If we gonna nerf him give him some love in his weaker areas ie picking up survivors doesn’t get rid of your power and I’d say make the power take longer to get last slightly less and I mean SLIGHTLY like maybe I don’t know 5 maybe 10 seconds
---
“Just don’t get hooked” 😆. Again, people keep taking my words and editing it. I never said survivors get nothing and the example was literally Pop so there is an example. As per my previous statement I said I was speaking in general not about a specific thing so when asked to come up with a specific example I did fairly quickly so.. Yes I do realize killers need more counters hence why I said I wish it was a 4:1 ratio as opposed to a 7:1 ratio, so for every 4 counters you give against survivors give 1 for them. Also, and don’t take this as a hostile tone because I’m calm and not trying to fight, but I am so sick of people using “it’s a 4v1” as an excuse. Well yea there’s never a horror anything where there’s a killer for every survivor and they made it so killers have abilities and survivors can’t really fight back as a way to balance it out. Everyone is so quick to say well survivors are in the majority so... like no, they’ve already balanced that part move on. I will say AGAIN(because this is Reddit and you can’t be too careful) none of that was intended to be malicious or yelling because I’m not trying to argue I’m just trying to discuss.
---
Half of those no longer work due to nerf
---
Oh haha weird I haven't seen his video yet
---
I couldn't get through the door as a survivor so I think it's a map glitch
---
Oh, it totally will. Just follow an unhooked survivor to fill your blood charge, M1 them, hook them, use your abilities to down as many more as you can, if anyone's still standing let them unhook, rinse and repeat.
---
I hate this shit of, “oh no keys?? Remove Moris XD” like that’s even comparable
---
8*
---
I dont necessarily consider getting 2 kills as balanced. Every killer should be able to get a 4k if played well and if played poorly get 0-1k. Getting 2 kills isnt hard. You can hard camp and guarantee at least 1 so I dont see that as a valid argument. There is literally no way to get a 4k vs good survivors with some killers. Clown for example, is not getting a 4k in red ranks unless the survivors really troll hard. 
---
I by no means think getting a 4k should be something easily done or even done often, but it should be possible for every killer at the highest level of play. As it stands that just isnt possible with roughly half the roster, if not more.
---
Wait until someone does it with the schoolgirl skin
---
They didn't know as much as they did now about game design and balance. Even the devs themselves admitted "We made nurse when we didn't quite understand how the game worked and how to balance around it". And as we introduce more and more perks into the game, it becomes more restricted by design so those perks do not break the game in any way. 
---
Slowly but surely they're making more steps in the right direction and this Balanced Landing change is a welcome one. (It was one of the best exhaustion perks, save for Dead Hard, after all.)
---
Now we just need updates to older maps and some more vertical pieces in newer maps to make BL a more reliable perk.
---
Reminds me of an Ogre
---
Annnnnd it’s boring the other one was so cool and spoopy like come on BHVR why y’all gotta take that from us
---
You are amazing
---
ohhh okay okay
---
Interesting how they have mostly the same blue skin color, although I find it a bit strange, since Rin supposedly died drenched in cold rain water and theh Oni died/disappeared while being tortured in a mill.
---
I must be overthinking this, maybe it's just a design choice.
---
I tested it today. It doesn't work.
---
What? One specific build making him mildly decent?
---
Thats an opinion
---
I mean i can see it now, but it just doesn't look good.
---
A minute in a competitive game is like a decade.
---
......the devs haven't even fixed the grab glitch. Pretty sure this will be in the game until 2026.
---
Gosh darn right we all are but that's what makes us all special.
---
Compete in a single trial
---
But we can ignore my comment because it's much funnier if the oni is just too chonky
---
Well if it doesn’t work that way it should. It specially states that when the obsession changes the perk triggers. Everything before that is just saying that this perk allows a new way for the obsession to switch.
---
&gt;You can buy them with shards. Not a big deal
---
Only non-licensed killers, which doesn't include bubba.

Id fucking pay you to never comment this whatsoever so i could have the ability of not thinking about her with an mega dick between her legs now

Match 2. We are at the meat plant against a Ghostface. He hooks the two randoms first, my friend and I save AND heal them. My friend gets hooked,  I save her and take him because he was slightly camping. He then chases me for 2 gens, I get down, hooked, and INSTANTLY unhooked by the adam francis. The killer comes for me,  I run him for another gen. Get hooked again, they pop the last gen as I'm getting unhooked. He comes to tunnel me down, so my friend takes him and gets hooked. They wave me towards them, and have a key to go out the hatch. They didn't attempt a save ALL match and were ONLY hooked once plus running bt. I try to get them to help me get my friend. They refuse and leave.. I go back for the save as he is stomping the hatch. He comes back for me, so my friend gets hatch. I asked them why they didn't help, we could've all got out, and they said we are trash for being on the hook.. Like y'all were hooked too,  we just SAVED you. But since they escaped, even tho I had more bloodpoints then everyone but 1 person without getting out, I'm trash. All because I didn't escape. Like what? Is it better to do nothing all game and escape, or max bloodpoints and die?
---
I use sloppy butcher, thana, stridor, and surveillance and get consistent 4ks
---
Nah Kate will aways be best girl

Wait, they stack? Does it say they stack in the details?

Now, for some reason, I want to see an art piece of The Oni and The Spirit either fighting or hunting together.
---
The point was not that it got nerfed, it was that it got changed due to people complaining. 
---
yes it was broken but so is a shit ton of killer addons, offering, and a few killers.
---
Ah thick skin i get it now
---
Wait, really? Such a nice detail!
---
I just feel like they are equivalent in the sense they can give who's going to lose an undeserved win that's why I have a hard time saying one should go without the other going, to be honest I'd be fine with both being removed. 
---
Also that's probably why you're more used to seeing that type of play where I've never seen it in a game that wasnt swf you must have a solid swf! I feel like a key is more avoidable than a mori from a decent killer but again I'm on board with keys and mori being op in a lot of situations.
---
The right sleeve would cover nearly half the screen
---
Yeah so I've tested it first hand and it doesn't work.
---
I would’ve killed him
---
Dont worry my guy I'm not offended or mad either. Genuine discussion here lol. How is it a 7 to 1 ratio right now. I guess that's what I'm not understanding. Seems like some made up number to me. Yeah there is not direct counter to pop, but does it really need one? Pop isnt op. Its strong and vs a 3 gen is impossible to beat but that's the only situation where its op and that's on the survivors for getting into a 3 gen. Can you give me any other examples? 
---
Also "dont get hooked" was obvious memeing but also kinda true lol.

He's Rin's long distant ancestor, his claim to fame was being an exceedingly brutal warrior in battle and leaving trails of corpses in his wake. He became exceedingly wealthy as a result of his success and purchased the Yamaoka estate with his hard earned money. Many many generations down the line, Rin and her father are now living on the estate, but it's fallen into disrepair because Rin's father is broke. The estate becomes overgrown as it falls into ruin and eventually becomes a viable window into the mortal plane for the Entity (Entity being tied to nature and such) and so she takes control of Rin's dad, causing him to kill his family in preparation for being a killer in the Entity's trials. However, as Rin was dying that ancient ancestral bloodrage that started with the Oni began to flow through her, and her last dying wish was ultimate fury-filled revenge on her father. Entity saw this and considered that she would be a better killer than her father, who was left to grieve alone over his dead family after the Entity released her grip on his mind. A side effect of Rin's passionate fury, along with the Yamaoka blood being spilled is that it awakened the ancient spirit of the Oni and so he's pissed off.

It looks really bad, she looks like a monkey or a small child.  They should have done a Ring-style crawl through the window, kind of similar to Demogorgon.
---
Interesting, maybe that's just Xbox following it's own historic trend haha. I'm on PS4 and what I said is true, at most one message a week. But then I don't play toxic either so there's that.
---
It's because Yui's placeholder voice is currently megs voice lol, no worries I know they look different
---
I just think they are very different. Keys are an item. Moris are an offering. Keys can be found during a match. Moris can not be. Keys can be used by survivors who havent worked on the objective. Moris require 2 downs to be used. Keys are stupid. Moris look awesome lol. Remove em both. We aren't a god tier swf by any means but if you see a secret offering you know not to unhook until last second, someone is always running borrowed time, and as I said if you unhook near the killer protocol is to body block. If played right you can waste a ton of time giving you time to finish the gens. Seriously if you don't play swf often I recommend it. Even just playing around with head on can make a bad game more fun.
---
They could have fixed the maps where balanced is op on
---
Reddit disagrees
---
Sorry, that was an arbitrary number, really just that it’s rare to see survivors get the counter so I personally wish it was uncommon as opposed to rare, like just down one step. But he’s you’re completely correct it was 100% a made up number. And Pop isn’t too bad on its own despite it not having a counter it’s just that it’s ALWAYS run with Ruin(which everyone will say is a must and I’m not gonna touch upon that because I don’t play killer enough to say if it is or isn’t a must) and more often lately I’ve been seeing people with: Pop, Ruin, Thana, Dying Light combos, sometimes it’s all 4 other times it’s 3 + BBQ but almost always 2 of those every match. So when you get nothing but gen-slow down perks it’s a hassle because like ruin can be broken, thana you can heal, but Dying Light and Pop the only way to avoid it is not to get hooked and if they’re paired then you will almost always not get the gens done unless you “rushed” the gens early on or the killer isn’t the best.

---
Not fun to play, not fun to verse unless it's a noob Nurse/
---
That second perk idea is basically Bamboozle.
---
The thing with balanced was that it wasn't able to be triggered as easily as other perks. That's why they buffed headon to make it better to trigger. It is more difficult to get it triggered so that's why I think it deserved that extra bonus. Head on also has an extra bonus of being able to save survivors. Of course that being that it is situational just like balanced
---
I would imagine the whole oblivious causing deep wound to tick down being a non-intended feature since the devs changed Legion and BT in the past.
---
At least i hope so... Nothing like getting outplayed by a killer just holding W, it was so fun and engaging the first time around! :)
---
ok alearean01
---
Delete legion
---
i play killer to have fun and put pressure on survivors.. literally no one is scared of the killers, that’s how you get some random claudette t-bagging pallets facing a 7 foot tall buff ass killer. if this game goes further trying to make everything scary then it’ll lose the competitiveness and become a hide and seek game. dead by daylight was never supposed to be a game where you hide as soon as you hear the heartbeat or else there wouldn’t be tools where you can fight back. it’s an asymmetrical game, yes it is defined under “horror” but real horror is where the survivors would not even be able to hold their ground against the killer. all you gotta do is stay on a few gens for ~80 seconds, use decisive strike and bam you’ve literally rocked the world of a 300 pound monster man chosen by a powerful entity.. that’s not horror. it was never meant to be. the scariest interaction you’ll get is probably when you turn around and see a stealth killer and that’s ok. bhvr will ruin their game if they continue further, and i feel like they’re going to with how many people complain about the game not being scary enough without actually looking into the facts.
---
Apparently so. It's childish to me. You have two kids. One comes to you and says the other one is outside stabbing kittens to death, you confront that one. The kitten killer says well the other child stabbed a dog yesterday. You say good answer and go back to watching tv.
---
i hope this will become a thing
---
Oh calm down.
---
Yeah it would've been cool if they added more lore between the Survivors. Honestly with Rin getting her great grandpappy I'd love to get a family member for one of the Survivors. Or at least a friend. Coworker? Something at least!
---
Steve.  Definitely Steve.
---
Sweet jesus those survivor perls are going to induce some serious cancer into the game.
---
I speak Japanese, idiot.
---
precisely
---
That's gonna be a no from me dog.
---
I mean, yeah in theory that would work. But then again why is balanced the only exhaustion perk that gives a permanent buff? It makes sense that if you're exhausted you dont get the effect. 
---
This is coming from a guy who has used balanced for over a year now in every load out I do. It hurts my soul a bit, but it makes sense. Its op.
---
Can’t wait for second day nerfs to make him underwhelming and I mean nerfs no fixes to his weaker points just fucking nerfs I’d be okay with some slight nerfs like how he turns but first can we fix how he loses his power when picking people up
---
By examining this image i can see that he was thrown into the wall breaking his spinal cord and maybe with shock force trauma breaking some ribs and skull leaving him to die on the floor
---
Didnt otz test this? Or something like it?
---
Not that that would really be a bad nerf. 
---
But it sounds like a Ghostface mixed in with Hillbilly if this nerf happens more then it being a Billy/Myers.
---
The fact that no mither is still a perk
---
Both are bad
---
What?

Yeah I know the lore too but it was really weird back when Shattered Bloodlines came out and we got a Japanese Killer with heavy Japanese themes and then our Survivor was some black guy in a trench coat whose perks involved "me throw rock" and "unhooked myself lmao."
---
One thing I do like about Yui is that her perks do have a bit of Japanese culture to them. Lucky Charm is the obvious one to mention, but you can see the Japanese character on her back in the icon for Pallet Pickup Perk (I don't care what it's actually called) too. Compared to "me throw rock" it's quite nice.
---
Yeah, anyone can slap on a costume and makeup for a quick scare, but Bill makes you believe it.
---
You can grab survivors while they try and unhook their friend even if they're at full health by lightly tapping the attack button during the unhook animation and if you're close enough. Otherwise, you just gotta make sure that the survivors aren't healthy enough to pull that off which, as much as I hate to say it, does involve getting good.

Thank you, that’s exactly what I’m looking for! I hadn’t realized unhooking was an interruptible action. Of course eventually I need to get better at chasing, hunting, etc; but sometimes it’s just about salvaging as many blood points as you can.

The fact that survivors got all the good perks while killers got meme-level perks is bad enough.

This is some next level reaching first off there’s no way in hell making killers look scary and cool would hurt the game god okay I get it all killers from now on are not allowed to be anything other then “normal dude with knife” no new scary or cool designs god the game is horror themed for a reason what the fuck do you want Mr fucking Larry from down the street as a killer????? THEIR FUCKING KILLERS AND MONSTERS HOW THE FUCK DO YOU MAKE A KILLER NOT HORROR THEMED and you you forgot to explain how making killers look cool and scary was supposedly gonna ruin the game like seriously we get a cool and fun and powerful killer with an interesting ability and guess what HES PRETTY COOL AND THREATENING LOOKING
---
Oh, okay. I don't think it will work, though.
---
At least they can't pick up pallet scraps and repair them
---
That's subjective.
---
The down side of dying light is it does nothing for you until you get hooks. So it's basically useless until you get a few hooks going which sometimes the games over already. We discussed pop already so I wont dive further into that. 
---
As for ruin being necessary. I play a lot of killer and ruin isnt technically necessary. That being said if you aren't running ruin you need to have corrupt intervention or the game is over. So I guess 1 of the 2 are necessary. Gens pop way to quickly if you dont have either of these. 
---
Pop is used every game because it's a damn good perk lol. The biggest problem with killer is that gens pop to fast. Anything to slow that down (ruin and pop) are to good to pass up. 
---
Do you have any other examples of there being no counter for a killer perk?
---
Explain this then?
---
Jeeze Rin calm down with your monkey-ass legs of yours.
---
This is nice and definitely better than her old vaulting animation (before they removed it entirely) but like... wow it's lazy. Feels like they just made her walk on the window. She couldn't like, have her torso go over just for her legs to phase through afterwards, or something?
---
That's cool and would probs make me DC 5 times.
---
I honestly main pNea no joke 🙌😤🙌
---
Keep joking like that and bhvr will add Shaman as a killer.
---
If there’s one killer that would be truly scary is a cracked out forest midget trying to bite my throat
---
Don’t really seem like it
---
Big fuckin stick sounds dope though
---
But i doubt that she won’t get like 50 different colours for hair
---
YEEEEEESSSSSSSSSS
---
Literally not once in that whole response did you explain how making killer scary looking is gonna hurt the game in anyway
---
I’m thrilled to see a Legion Blight skin.
---
Wait I just noticed, why does the new survivor make Meg grunts?
---
So to sum up reddits opinion on keys being broken. "Moris". Because as everyone knows 2 wrongs make a right. So I suppose I will spend all of my bloodpoints saving up moris and run a mori every game in case a survivor brings or finds a key. Thanks guys!
---
Could you like make a video showing how you access the ptb via geforce now ?
---
Someone who doesnt like Legion
---
That's not "old Legion". This involved a niche situation where Legion has to be stunned while the stunning survivor is affected by deep wounds.
---
That's will 100% be patched in the live version btw.
---
Not really, my post got downvoted right as he said that so I was just wondering
---
It's different than "old Legion"
---
No doubt. I'm just wondering if anyone thinks the way that they do,  or if it is just pure toxicity.
---
Thank you :)
---
Does anyone read patch notes?
---
&gt; KNOWN ISSUES
---
&gt; Invisible collisions blocking access to one of the closed house garage in the Lampkin Lane map.

Ah yes I have to work to hit the shift key, the W key, and/or the space bar
---
“I’d say I’m Dirty Dan.”
---
sprint burst is absolutely not viable. id rather use dead hard and get dedicated servered than use that perk
---
Ok but do you understand the reference he made
---
? You told me to chill, I said I'm out of chill. So if it doesn't seem like I'm out of chill why tell me to chill in the first place?
---
He should be able to drop to all fours and move around really fast or something of the sort
---
Fair
---
Read the patch notes... "Known issues" part specifically
---
Sadly no, whoooosh me good sir :(
---
Still gonna use it for meme builds and you can’t stop me!
---
That actually looks like a cool background
---
They don't have to be affected you can get stunned then do it because they're oblivious for a full minute. You could frenzy them 30 seconds after getting stunned and it'd still work.
---
Been broken since release. Scary thing is it might be better this way then what might happen if bhvr attempts to fix it lol.
---
I don’t mind toxic play style, like you can teabag me all you want, just going to make me want to get that ass even more! But in the after chat, don’t continue the BM imo.
---
It’s from south park where the ghost of Micheal Jackson possesses Ike
---
Is Haddonfield reworked?
---
My go-to build is Adrenaline, Unbreakable, Bond, and Balanced Landing, but I definitely have a few underdog favorites.
---
What about replacing Rancor with Enduring? Could be better imo
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyrcy1/does_no_mither_counter_the_oni/
---
Legit the 2nd best thing for me after the new killer lol.
---
The longer they put off an Operation Health type update the more of a clusterfuck it'll be once they have to do it.
---
I'd be fine with the first update of next year being purely a balance update, among other things.
---
I understand what you mean about lucky break, but breakout seems pretty good imo, but is the ability to re-stand a pallet bland? It seems like a pretty big feature to me, not to mention that new syptics can be better than they were before the change because they protect you from insta downs and no longer consume the full medkit.
---
You know exactly what I mean.
---
This thanos?
---
And the voice of meg
---
nice bait
---
Amen
---
**Moderator note:**
---
&gt; Posting the same meme twice doesnt get past the censors
---
So if people started calling Meg “Thomas” or Jake “Park” that’d be cool? Sure.
---
Its exactly old moonwalk legion except 1 stab vs 50000
---
Not sure, I don’t really have anything too pressing it was mainly those 2 that I see all the time. I mean sure I could bring in other perks that don’t really have counters but it’s not like they’re problematic. For Example: Save the best for last doesn’t have a counter except “don’t get hit” but I wouldn’t really say that NEEDS a counter because you lose stacks for hitting the obsession so that’s like it’s own counter but then again Balanced Landing is getting nerfed when it didn’t need to so who know maybe STBFL needs a nerf now(just kidding). Or like Sloppy Butcher not having a counter except “stay injured” or “don’t get hit” but 🤷‍♂️. Idk it’s really the perks that are all “don’t get hit” “don’t get hooked” “be the best player in the world and never make a mistake ever” type things that are the problem.
---
Lol. Chill
---
You call?
---
These sound like the type of people I hate the most. 2 survivors alive on the map and they refuse to touch a generator. 5 hours later I find and hook one giving the other the hatch just so I can escape the hell. I really need to start running whispers every game. Same type of survivor to unhook you in front of the killer and self care in your face while you have we'll make it.
---
Pro tip is that you don't need to chase down one person, you only need to chase people that are actually doing generators.
---
Its Blursed
---
You have soothed me with your unconventional methods.
---
What happened to BL?
---
That blows massive dick. I was kinda hoping no mither would be useful here
---
Cool (:
---
As someone that works with artistic mediums and knows people that work in photography, you're extremely wrong, lighting can do some really weird shit.
---
They made a more powerful old legion honestly. Provided you have the correct perks anyway
---

Blame the devs for writing it weebly on the trailer: https://i.imgur.com/FTeG74q.png

It's the same reason why people have called ["Min"](https://i.imgur.com/FJRLB6j.png) "Feng" for years at this point.
---
some rando on main
---
Okay I'll spell it out for you if you really need me to.
---
Step 1. Legion Feral Frenzy Survivor
---
Step 2. Legion hopes to God he gets pallet stunned within the next 8 seconds (with the new Legion nerf, deep wounds can be mended that quickly with a teammate. Or, ~15 seconds alone). Not 30 seconds anymore.
---
Step 2 option b. Survivors know about this exploit and will simply not pallet stun legion while they're affected by deep woulds. Boom. "old legion" is not back.
---
Regardless, all of this is 100% going to get patched. So enjoy it in the PTB while it lasts.
---
Why does her face work so well with this?
---
OH GOD I JUST REALIZED toxic survive with friends are gonna be horrible WHAT HAVE YOU DONE BHVR
---
i never said they couldn’t try to make the characters look scary, but i can tell this is the start of a “horror” direction. look at the survey, look at the community all saying the game should be more terrifying. i simply said i don’t like how he looks. he doesn’t carry the dead by daylight vibe.. he carries the appearance of an outlast character. which, if the game wants to do that, go ahead but i can already tell they’re going to try to add horror mechanics and it’s going to take an awful turn. take a look at bubba or demogorgon, in my opinion they’re pretty scary looking but they keep the dbd appearance. but holy shit the oni has flames, red eyes, spikes &amp; he’s gigantic.. it’s so obvious that they did this to introduce new interactions and ideas. his character design came from people requesting horror, his power (blood collecting) came from people requesting dynamic gameplay, the new survivor’s pallet perk came from survivors wanting new interactions etc. and it’s so easy to tell. so obviously.. they’re going to slowly inch in horror.
---
now without yelling at me through messages can you at least consider how bad the game would be if they carried through with horror?
---
Hey did you see his new perk combo? I would say that he basically got reverted due to the perk nemesis
---
A damn shame cause they already fucked him up and now they take away the only thing keeping our bois and gals together.
---
!(B)(i) so like this! (B)(i) right?
---
Custom game glitch. Pretty fun actually.
---
Depending on window spawns you can run a lot of killers for a long ass time with no pallets on coal tower, iron works, grim pantry, both Crotus Penn maps, hawkins, and to a lesser extent the actual preschool building in badham. 
---
It might be more situational than other exhaustion perks, but if you have BL in those maps you can be almost uncatchable if you know what you're doing. I use balanced landing on almost every survivor build since the switch to dedicated servers, so I'll definitely miss it, but I understand it.
---
I mean yes it is getting nerfed but it's the only exhaustion perk that does two things other than adrenaline. Sprint burst doesn't make you walk faster while not exhausted lithe doesn't give you a % increase on vaults. Dead hard doesn't reduce how much your bleeding. Head on doesn't help you crawl into lockers quicker. Honestly it wouldn't surprise me if they took the sprint burst out of adrenaline.
---
Yes
---
Do not touch billy. I have zero faith in their ability to touch anything without completely breaking it.
---
But how many times were you given the hatch out of pure lust by the killer? Exactly
---
finally i'm sick of toxic no mither davids teabagging and bleeding everywhere
---
Yeah, no one else in the game has that last name so you still no who they are talking about
---
So that's why all the killers have the skins where they're dripping in glow-in-the dark orange liquid?
---
i miss the 10 seconds ago when i didnt see this post
---
Dude yes! I play matches were my friend and I get tunneled NON stop because we are the ONLY ones doing anything and the shit bag hiding in the corner all game gets hatch. It's annoying.
---
Those changes would be absolutely terrible.... so I’d give it a month before they’re implemented
---
Then run BoP on top of it you can drain deep wound with that too once you get bl1.
---
After they dig up Legion’s grave and piss on him again
---
How does MOM work ?? Does it give you 3 hits ?
---
Kate's give me PTSD. I hate playing against Kates. Why is it Kate's? W h y.
---
So 100% free hook rescue was bad?
---
Fucking survivor mains lmao
---
Should've stuck a stick up his ass for camping
---
I agree, Billy is an amazing killer, don't get why people say he's bad.
---
It's comical to see downvotes on a post like this,  ASKING for opinions yet the only ones saying anything agree. Hmm, so guessing it's just toxic and the people down voting are the same people I described.
---
Don’t forget about spirit, they’ll be nerfing her again because they failed to change one of the main complaints about her
---
No Mither countering insta-downs and slugging is kinda a long running joke.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyv38i/after_nearly_2_12_years_no_mither_finally_has_a
---
No, First off its hard enough to get into tier 3 with Judith tombstone so about time you do get to tier 3 about 4 gens will be done
---
I hate these legion nerfs a lot, but don't diss what little buffs he did get. Vaulting and running definitely feels a LOT faster, not that it makes up for his nerfs.
---
It's not op. He has to earn his power and it lasts a limited time, loses it by picking up a suvivior and his dash doesn't even do shit by itself
---
That’s one reason why I like to play killer!
---
No need for good teammates if you don’t play in a team!
---
What insta kills are there that don't require hooks besides yellow mori (must be last survivor) Rancor (must be in end game) and Devour Hope (can be destroyed?
---
You also have to consider that its 1v4, the killer needs to be stronger. Its not just one person with insta-heals, its four.
---
If survivors allow a Myers to get his EW3 while using Judith + Tuft Hair, this is on you. Plus you can still deny his kill by entering a locker or continue repairing a generator (granted that you will die once finished).
---
Shit man its still NNN
---
Also, he's a *Community Ambassador* according to Steam.
---
Well first off you got a 28 m terror radius on a full speed killer. Terror radius is supposed to reflect the time it takes a killer to reach you and the only killers that break this rule do so as a core mechanic (Huntress for example has a smaller terror radius because she is slower than normal, but has a very large Lullaby radius because she has ranged attacks). The power also causes what the game calls "Hindered" which is slower movement speed. A full speed killer that can apply Hindered that simply isn't really that interactive. Legion had the same issue, their original power involved them just being a lot faster than survivors basically and everyone hated it because there was no counterplay. However this is not the source of them being OP because the power doesn't seem to help much in chases and around loops. The *perks* on the other hand are overpowered.   
---
The first perk, Tethered, sounds like "Play With Your Food" but has a couple glaring issues. First one is that it incentivizes tunneling which is unhealthy for the game, the second issue is that after only 20 seconds of chase you have 16% more movement speed which for most killers means they're moving at 132% speed, that's like Legion levels of speed which you get almost for free.  
---
The second perk, Nimble, is just sort of a snowball perk, it makes you stronger when you're already winning which is sort of uninteresting all things considered. Also as far as I know 60% faster vaults means you vault windows faster than survivors do. Contrast Nimble to a perk like Bamboozle, which makes your vault speed 15% faster but has a secondary effect and is always active. Nimble is just too extreme without actually being interesting.  
---
The third perk, Perfectionist, is honestly just kind of weird. Landing 2 consecutive hits typically means you've downed somebody so blocking a window won't really matter, also correct me if I'm wrong but do the 4 stacks cause windows that are nearby to you to constantly be blocked? Because if the 4 stacks that block windows will block windows near you as you walk around then that's incredibly overpowered, you cut off any chance of escape for the survivors with virtually no counterplay, but I could be misunderstanding this perk as it's worded oddly and not very clear.
---
Enlighten me to your top 5, you got my curiosity.
---
Devs didn't even acknowledged it... RIP Dead Hard I Guess.
---
People were complaining he was weak. They were more trying to buff them just not in the right way. My point stands. 4 examples against 1

Honestly, what utterly baffles me most is that they’re making changes to Legion but *still* haven’t flipped the values on Discordance. It gets worse as you level it up. It’s been almost a year: how have they not figured that out yet?
---
Counter play = break out of line of sight. 
---
With how much stalking it takes (depending on if your team is stupid or not) you can easily bully Michael and get out or at least pip. 
---
Make sure he doesn’t get T1 right away is the biggest plus, with a good team you can get 1 maybe 2 gens popped before he gets t2 or as soon as he gets t2 and then that leaves 3 more. 
---
Sure he moves faster but break line of sight as much as you can and you’ll win it’s simple and easy. 
---
No wonder why no one plays Judith’s tombstone lol.
---
&gt;What insta kills are there that don't require hooks besides yellow mori (must be last survivor) Rancor (must be in end game) and Devour Hope (can be destroyed?
---
Judith Tombstone and Tombstone Piece.
---
My guess is they are gonna make it so the mend bar only goes down when you are out of the terror radius and don't have the oblivious status effect.
---
WHAT WOULD IT MESS WITH god that’s my only question killers looking scary ain’t gonna effect anything and moving more towards scary = more scary looking killers but also I want to bring up your point of wanting this game to stay competitive WHY? No one plays this game for competitive reason they play it for fun and even if they did try to make the game more scary on survivors part that would probably mean map fixes on god loops and gens speed you know? The stuff that’s been asked for for forever but no there is literally no evidence that this will hurt the game or even if they are gonna go through with leaning further into horror
---
Intuition tell me. And I think nemesis would proc only in case of stuns or blinds, as stated in a perk, which means it is not going to activate under any other circumstances
---
Look, say what you want. They’re going to change him and this version of the killer won’t make it with the atmosphere we face in the game right now. If people will bitch about the Plague then they’ll complain about Billy 2.0
---
We need pennywise
---
He does need a nerf. You don't need to charge his bludgeon that much to make it an instant kill. It's a better chainsaw.
---
Because they did that with Demo and Freddy right?
---
Leave Daddy alone.
---
I want those eyelashes
---
To be specific, the son of the first Yamaoka.
---
Ok, I do agree that that can be made longer but he doesn't need massive nerfs like everyone whines about. Happens every time.
---
What are we doing on the ground Onii-chan?
---
Even some toxic swf wont fuck with a myers like that knowing he might have judith tombstone
---
I've played this game since release. That's not a fucking counter. You're just delaying the inevitable. Plus you can't count in the other survivors not to fuck you over
---
Sorry to do this but according to your own words we are talking about not just a shrine but an Elevated shrine
---
Again, You have no proof of this to prove otherwise. I do.
---
I'm pretty sure this isn't the first Yamaoka, I think it's supposed to be his son or something. His lore said something about him leaving the family and going and killing a bunch of dishonorable samurai or something. I may be wrong but I'm pretty sure it's not the first one.
---
Its the other way around lol
---
Seems legit
---
Who says that rank 20 is solo?
---
If his friend is red ranks it makes sense.
---
They said in AMA they will not skip a chapter to bugfix/optimize the game and instead, they'll cut resources on events 'n shit like that to use 'em on this kind of stuff.
---
Ain't gonna happen. Money is more important.
---
Ohh, how have I missed this? lol
---
B O N K
---
Meyers has tombstone piece and Judith Tombstone that just allows him to instantly kill people while in tier 3. Doesn't even have to down you. Just get close enough to hold the button and kill you
---
I agree with you, OP.
---
Legion used to be a very annoying killer, since he could make the deep wounds timer go down more with multiple hits and then harass survivors who need to mend afterward. Admittedly this isn’t terribly OP in a 1 v 4 scenario, but in 1 v 1 it arguably had less counterplay than spirit. I’ll see if I can find a video.
---
Or just increase the charge time of the insta down. It's a little bit too fast probably
---
Oh so you can predict that he won’t get nerfed? Go ahead. They didn’t nerf Ghostface because he was already weak to begin with. Demogorgon was upper C tier from the start. I don’t see your point there.
---
Yeah probably wasn’t a good call on their part. Should be consistent with the rest of the characters.
---
Well I don't know WTF to call it. The tiles in both maps are called shrine, and one of them is elevated on some steps.
---
Imagine these statues snitch your location out to the killer lol
---
She looks like a fucking goblin
---
But it should be a better chainsaw
---
All they really have to do is make so mending doesn't to down when you have the oblivious status effect. No idea how hard it's gonna be to code though. I really hope they don't nerf the perk just cause of legion but at the same time I don't want to see legion getting more and more nerfs.
---
It's from blood loss, not being cold.
---
They haven't nerfed killers on release since plague is my point. Not once. People overreact on both sides. They might make small changes but not enough to be a big deal.
---
I’m sure she wouldn’t mind sharing this spotlight... for a few matches.
---
That doesn't change the fact that there isn't a single counter play to this type of thing. Why should he be allowed to just run up and instantly kill me even though I've not been hooked a single time and didn't even get stalked? Why should I be allowed to be punished because of shit team mates?
---
Okay. Then say that and don’t drag it on like you’re all high and mighty. Jesus Christ.
---
His power needs reworked. The fact that the blood orbs exist destroys no mither (lol) and the new blood perk. You can literally always find an injured survivor you're chasing so he will always down you, especially since the orbs glow through objects. His power breaks the game.
---
 Nice play on the David
---
I first saw it in otz's stream and i legitlet out a little yelp when it happened. Don't know why but statues that move when youre not looking is just a special phobia for me
---
People don’t have faith in bhvr’s ability to balance that’s where all this stems from
---
I figured. He knew that as well. 
---
Im down for some wholesome toxicity here and there, but this kind of blatant shit going on in purple/red ranks is absurd.
---
&gt;That's not a fucking counter.
---
It is a counter, it simply denies him a kill. If he is using Tombstone Piece instead of Judith, he won't be able to kill more than 1 or 2 survivors and will become a basic M1 killer for the rest of the match.
---
&gt; Plus you can't count in the other survivors not to fuck you over
---
This isn't a problem with the add-ons but general player's skill.
---
&gt;I've played this game since release.
---
[x] Doubt.
---
I did
---
Oink mains are truly the most positive members of this sub
---
I am pretty sure if you report and the robot detected certain words, he will get banned. You can also report through the BHVR website to be sure. But it won’t be a very long ban anyway so..
---
People also like to overreact
---
Ok babysurvivor, getting all hot under the collar over an item built in the game that barely makes a difference. Inb4 u get annoyed, don't post on a subreddit with a toxic community when ur not ready to take some insults.
---
If you are far from the pallet, yes, lunge. If you got stunned and decide to break the pallet, just kick it.
---
Can someone explain how this came to be lol
---
That was broken, but he also had a lot more stuff broken as well, not just that chase cheese. Frank's Mixtape for one, which funnily enough is probably his worst add on now
---
&gt;Even some toxic swf wont fuck with a myers like that knowing he might have judith tombstone
---
If you use Judith + Tuft against a half decent SWF, match will be over before you tier up to EW2, let alone reach EW3.
---
0
---
Shakw your head, hit a gwn multiple times, and then start farm. Basically they just want to fill all 4 categories, so they do some gens, ask ya to Stand in pallet for stun. You can hook everyone twice for hook points, they gain altruiam points for unhook. Use ur ability, it give some points too
---
Wait is it getting nerfed?
---
So was yours
---
Yeah, i think the buffs are nice, just id rather have no changes than the trade we got is all
---
Meh, I think its fine. Also, does it matter how it looks? Its one vault animation. It accomplished what they wanted done so \*shrug\*
---
Sorta
---
I wouldn't care if he at least had to put me into the dying state first but he literally just runs up on me and fucking grabs me
---
Gamzee from Homestuck vibes
---
Anybody who is good at the game can play any killer and do well. However in the hands of the average player, Wraith doesn't usually do well sadly.
---
Yeah. This is broken.
---
Oddly enough, shouldn't No Mither like unironically ACTUALLY counter Oni's power?
---
I guess they don't want a situation where you face 4 No Mithers and actually are powerless, but on the flip side at that point you're facing 4 No Mithers.
---
&gt;what do you guys think?
---
I think this is oversaturated content.
---
Oh that's... that's actually a pretty reasonable reason. Oh well, thank you.
---
&gt;recently
---
Between releasing an event that's so lackluster that it might aswell not exist, postponing said event and mid-chapter patch to then release it with no real fixes, and just generally doing a terrible job at getting rid of age old bugs I can't decide which is more outstanding.
---
Oh... I guess I won’t be playing wraith today sadly.

Kind of and it's getting buffed slightly

Yeah its kinda funny, nobody slugs you if you have no mither but against a plague ive had a couple times where they forget i have no mither lmao.

another garbage dlc from bhvr
---
if they dont buff him he will be tier F
---
Yeah but some toxic swf like to stall and fuck with the killer, Ive seen swf literally stop doing gens just to do a full team hook rescue every time one of them got hooked or body blocked and followed the killer and not to gems, Its possible to get tier 3 with judith against some swf if their being reeeeeal toxic
---
I see what you mean but the original point of my comment is not that we shouldnt use it this way, I was saying that you shouldnt expect to get any real use out of it since everyone will be spamming RB to communicate various things, and you spazzing on the hook usually end up saying "look out" to anyone who's close to you and to those who are far away it wont say anything.
---
TL;DR: I get what you're saying and if everyone did this communicating inmediate danger would be easier, but a lot of people dont use it like that so you cant always be sure that you're getting your message understood
---
Good luck getting it to work. It's extremely finicky. I'm rarely ever able to actually grab somebody when they're unhooking. Maybe once every 20 tries or so.

Someone needs to load in as Billy and Oni to do a drag race.
---
How about reputation points, you lose 30 each disconnect and gain 10 if with ending, at 50 you can't enter a match with any perks and addons, at 0 or below you get banned for 5 days, you also gain 10 per day and it can be gifted as 5 by the teammates at end of each match.
---
I think you can still hit someone with demon strike before they drop the pallet at a loop if you time it correctly.

---
People not doing gens and basically throwing matches is toxic?
---
ok...
---
Dude what? You have to almost completely deplete all 4 survivors of stalk to make this work it takes forever. Also how often do you run into this? Its a meme build.
---
Thank you !
---
Shugo is becoming too powerful for one game. 
---
His mass is spreading
---
I have no idea what caused this bug but it started after I used urban evasion which is odd because I was using it early in the game just fine. The only thing I know is that the glitch stopped when I used balanced landing at the end of the game. So if anyone who can report this to BVHR that would be nice.
---
My 22 reps were not in vein
---
Careful... mods tend to remove posts like this because there are too many similar posts (ie this community isn’t good advertisement for new people to buy in, so screw You) lol
---
;'( feel ya... there are still good survivors who appreciate it.
---
The stagger can't be used while exhausted but the falling sound is muted
---
Those shorts will keep your bells in place all the way through the Holliday hustle
---
Why would it need a counter play when its hard as hell to get to? All the gens will be done about time he gets to tier 3 so either you must have teammates who dont do gens and play around when myers is the killer or you dont leave when all gens are done because you wont see tier 3 judith tombstone most the time if you have a competent team
---
Ah yes,donate art in the form of mugs and phone covers to the needy
---
Average at best. I play him without the use of add-ons most of the time. He's only good at reaching Survivors when invisible to use that extra speed. Otherwise uncloaked he's just an M1 Killer.
---
Players still tend to abuse cloaking and uncloaking speed boost just to reach one Survivor but its not efficient. (Sometimes annoying) You're good to try him as a standard Killer going to places while Survivors may not know your position unless you have good pair of eyes to see his blurry image while cloaked.
---
Ye! I was getting a degree so I had to stop for a while UwU Thanks for supporting for so long!
---
Dare i say i think he needs some very slight buffs. Id like to see the add on that allows him to pick up the blood without slowing down be base kit and also like to see him not lose his power by picking up a survivor. Other than that i think hes very balanced.
---
I definitely agree.
---
'barely makes a difference' so you're saying having to go on the hook three times to die vs only having to go once is barely a difference? That's 4 hooks to end the game vs the usual 12. And yes moris are built into the game, but that doesn't make them fun or balanced at all. Just like keys can be very unfun and unbalanced to go against as a killer
---
He's ok. I managed to get a few 4ks with him and he's not really that bad. depends on how you do your cloaking n stuff
---
Spirit’s ancestor.
---
Please look forward to it
---
No i criticize you cause u cant deal with the game clearly lol
---
I wish the old State back so people can clearly see that the current State of the game is actually balanced and people stop whining because they cant deal with Balance landing or whatever next is gonna get nerfed.  And i do play both sides, eben killer more and i just deal with stuff and still dont cry that i dont get 4k regulary. Noob
---
As soon as the chapter is live you can buy him with shards.
---
You hit tier 2 at the same rate, only going from 2 to 3 is slower.
---
You'll be excited with 3.4.0
---
That’s actually pretty helpful i’ll be sure to do that thanks 😁
---
Meh, I don't usually care if I depip, the game's much more relaxed that way. Try focusing more gens and ignoring some saves, you'll rank up eventually.
---
Proof the ancient camper is versatile and still incredibly stupid
---
After next chapter you only drop 1 rank color.
---
Now we need someone to dub in pac-man sound effects over gameplay footage.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfKDTpWz4QQ&amp;feature=emb_title
---
hes on the ptb
---
Yeah they have the worst matching system ever
---
what if 3 breakout + boil over? 5 sec wigglw time or what?
---
I DONT LIKE
---
Fun fact: The club the Oni uses is called a Kanabo. Don't think that's fun? Try changing which syllable you emphasise when saying it. 
---
I'll wait.
---
&gt;You hit tier 2 at the same rate, only going from 2 to 3 is slower.
---
Yes but you are slower than usual with Judith equipped. Add that to EW1 and any rock is an infinite denying your stalk.
---
 that’s way better actually
---
Seems pretty average? I dunno. He has good tracking and power seems strong enough, but as with every new chapter people rush to call something OP. I'm decently confident that some good counterplay exists.
---
I’m buying all the Yui cosmetics
---
they might just be leaving it at 45 seconds to make it easier to decide if it needs a buff
---
People need to learn how to avoid curving billys, its not that hard to avoid tbh
---
Merge that dwight with this one, what do we get?
---

---
[Well it's been the opposite for me.](https://youtu.be/8uxsLeViRCw)
---
I mean, its very unlikely two survivors can get two gens done. Keys are kind of a way to give you a chance to escape when you have no other choice.
---
i try not to care but i’d much rather de-pip because of something i did vs. what my team did. thanks for the advice!
---
i am, i’m so ready to get carried again.
---
I second this
---
This has nothing to do with your clip, but for anyone who doesn't know, that half wall on the left is an amazing hiding spot if you know the killer is coming. Well over half the time even at high ranks killers don't check back there. For any killer main reading this comment, if you know a survivor is in this building but you just can't find them, start checking that spot lol.
---
The teaser was released 2 days ago, you should've already known the dlc is on the way :D
---
*reparing generator in peace*
---
"ETTU SKIT!" as a forest loli comes flying by.
---
haven't played the ptb but does the wood wacker hit vertically or is it like all other weapons, it would be more balanced if it hits vertically, forcing you to be extremely accurate with each blow
---
Are you crazy? Nemesis is crazy good for Legion. If you get hit by a pallet, that makes the survivor your obsession. If you hit him with a stab, he will begin to bleed. But because of Nemesis, he suffers from the Oblivious status effect, and thus he is not in a chase and will bleed out, even if you are right behind him.
---
Confirmed next killer is a neckbeard wielding an Odachi
---
Actually I think you're correct now that I've read around a lil more. Still, absolute ancient lad, Rin's great great great great great great etc grandpappy
---
How is that relevant to my comment at all? These accounts are free, I have different ones for different groups of subs and I literally bought this game three days ago. 
---
Can you now see why you're clearly a dolt?
---
Yup, just run Beast of Prey and Nemesis.
---
Dude dumb enough to stun/blind you, FF them and free down.
---
Dude looping you forever, FF will down them after about 40 seconds and nothing they can do.
---
Not sure, it seems that it is horizontally because you can kind of shake it around while it's dropping to hit people
---
O yay. A perk that's good on a single killer and in a toxic obnoxious way. 
---
Joy.
---
If you notice, when you adjusted your camera slightly and walked forward they reacted. A good rule of thumb is to center them "behind" your head. Is it counter intuitive to look st something while covering it up? Yes. But that's how it be sometimes.
---
You cant run away from him lol
---
Definitely not my best play but his already faster speed plus a long lunge means it's a bit harder to tell which way he's gonna go and it kind of made sense he goes the opposite way around the loop instead of following me so I hesitated
---
Eat and break every pallet when you play against good SWF is a direct way to throw the game
---
The deep wound effect used to go down if you weren't in a chase so legion could just walk backwards and eventually you would have to stop and mend and then he downs you, he was impossible to actually get away from or avoid being hit, then there was the bug where certain add on combos would make the mend time 2-3 minutes.
---
Did I miss some sort of imgur scandal?
---
I love seeing chunks of their skull fly out
---
bubba needs a nerf,lol now I've heard everything,yeah bubba is the most broken killer in the game nerf him more pls
---
i’m not understanding? 
---
i haven’t been on the subreddit much today so dont yell
---
I guess, but the route a normal killer would take is going opposite to the way I'm looping and in a straighter path but instead he followed me around the loop which is why I hesitated :(
---
My point is once it gets to that point they already won unless you have noed.
---
If the gens are that far apart your patrolling wrong. You have to come up with a 3 gen strat, the closer the gens are the easier it is to defend them.
---
Dont let survivors lead you around, if you chase a survivor make sure you're in control of where they're going and if you stray to far away stop chasing that survivor. Plan ahead and take full advantage of your surroundings. Its 4v1 not 1v1 so you have to pull off some big brain moves to take the win.
---
Time is of the essence but its not always about getting hooks. It could be 1 gen left and no hooks but that doesnt mean you cant comeback if all 4 survivors are on the floor no ones getting saved from a hook.
---
This has to be a shitpost. Mori’s are a little annoying but Myers tier 3 killing you will only happen once every few hundred matches
---
the window in that spot is also a godsent for evading the killer if they come through the front. if they come through the back that spot is pretty weak tho
---
“What does it take to get a bite to eat around here?”
---
-Hag probably
---
BL is the only exhaustion perk that has a passive ability for when you’re exhausted and I think behavior is trying to get rid of that
---
Then why would you comment?
---
They are adding a killer called The Oni in this game that has a kanabo and wears an Oni mask. This character is from For Honor and he also has a kanabo and wears an Oni mask, just thought it was funny that they’re similar
---
F in the chat for my favorite. you will be missed dearly
---
ah okay gotcha, cool
---
shh. just accept it or they wont spit on it before they put it in next time
---
It’s probably just how much you hemorrhage at least that’s my guess
---
The Hag one is different. It's a copy from any other short killer (pig, ghost, legion)
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyy5me/sorry_if_this_is_spam_but_is_this_a_bug_or/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
he should be kicked out of his power after downing someone. if this isnt changed he is just going to be a slug fest.
---
So you fight fire with more fire?
---
He should definitely be able to slug, it's just that his power shouldn't force him into slugging to be efficient.
---
So? About time there's another Killer that deserves to be named that and isn't just about as dangerous as an angry kitten.
---
For #2, I don’t think his power should be completely depleted. The reason why other killers have their powers depleted is because they come back on their own. The Oni has to earn his power. However, I do think stunning him should take off some of his power. Maybe like 33% everytime he’s stunned. Just not completely
---
Then he’d be a worthless addition
---
always give the hatch to the baby dweets
---
oh well, he seems fun but kinda brainded in terms of strategy
---
For what it's worth, OP, I agree with you. It sucks total shit to get insta-killed by a Myers. Also, I'm laughing pretty hard at some of these responses that are "just don't get seen lol"
---
But, at the same time, that sort of thing is so rare that you just have to kind of accept it and try your best to play around it. Crazy shit like that is what keeps you on your toes as a survivor, otherwise the game would be incredibly stale.
---
The other day blighted spirit carried my blighted Jake to hook in McMillan estate. The colour combination of these two outfits were breathtaking, I momentarily forgot that I need to struggle.
---
Can’t unsee.
---
What perk is this? I watched monto playing as oni and seen 2 girl survs and they did that. I play console so it’s not out yet for me.
---
oh well, he seems fun but kinda low risk high reward
---
Completely worthless. I swear, survivors ask for extreme nerfs to killers without trying to at least learn to counter them
---
I thought they would just decrease the stagger reduction to 50% to reduce the distance gained. Back to bug hard zzz
---
I love him but I am talking about balance.He needs a nerf.He is way too good to use for how good he is.
---
This meme is from the far future
---
I wish. Shugoki main here
---
Puppet pal clem?
---
So crouching while injured vs oni spawns a new blood orb for every crouch, is this a shadow Nerf to tbagging?
---
Bro that's penisist
---
Can the killer break the pallet while you're bringing it up ?
---
If the killers had hooks fall in his face then of course drop, but if the survivor wants to rank hits then I’m down. Dropping him and picking him up would usually let him wiggle off anyway.
---
Shit man daughter and father matching dresses cool
---
They just mad no sweat
---
His character flow would probably be the worst in the game. He’d be so tedious, boring, and truly nothing more than a handicapped billy
---
the dweet was spared
---
I'm just wondering why she has the exact same voice as meg.
---
They're from two different fucking countries... Like, one is Chinese, the other Japanese. People are idiots.
---
it's called Any Means Necessary. Reset a fallen pallet once every 120 seconds
---
So does that new perk that stops bleeding temporarily work as a counter to his blood sucking ability is what I want to know.
---
Wait Sidney's house?
---
Nice. Could come in handy. Any news on when the update will be on console?
---
Lotta stuff I'd agree with aside from points 5 and 8. While I do think he's pretty dang weak by default at match start, I don't think dropping his terror radius is the boost he needs. Main reason being that BHVR made a statement on terror radius functionality back when they soft-reworked the Pig, it's meant to be indicative of how long it will take a killer to reach you by walking straight at you, so lower terror radius means slower killer. Anyone that breaks that rule is usually a stealth killer. I think a more fun change would be to actually give him a softer version of Demon Dash while he's not powered, just a slight increase in speed, no palette breaks of course, not a one hit down, less range, etc etc, just a cool lil samurai run to help the guy get around the map and find people.
---
As for point 8, the range you can see blood orbs is pretty short and not really indicative of where a survivor actually is since they aren't produced toooo often. I will however say that it would be best if you couldn't see orb auras until like 4 seconds after they get spawned, just so that the information they give is less accurate.
---
One more thing I think would feel about right is increasing his terror radius while he's in bloodfury, and the specific reason I suggest this is because Demon Dash is fuckin brutal if you don't have your head on a super crisp swivel. But yeah good list.
---
I think he should get kicked out but have it reset to 75 or 50%.
---
VIBE CHECK!
---
I’m honestly just trying to give small nerf ideas so they don’t completely gut him. Once survivors find a new killer to hate, it’s only a matter of time before the devs make the killer useless
---
Ok I have a question, what's with the bat thing he pulls out when blood fury is active?
---
Which is exactly the problem. She is a vengeful spirit of a dead girl that was murdered by her father, she is supposed to be scarry, not adorable.
---
New legacies leaked
---
make him keep a portion of his power, or gain it quicker.
---
i agree, but god i just dont think a killer based around slugging is going to be fun, people are going to get upset about it
---
Ghost face would just run into literally every door and fall over lol
---
Op, we weren’t ready for this
---
Sometimes the game also just crashes for no reason.
---
Its a placeholder
---
Dec 3 or Dec 10
---
They're*
---
Definitely not cringe, but definitely satire.
---
Why should he lose it when stunned? Imagine tier 3 myers who just loses his power because of a pallet
---
How bored were you when you made this?
---
As a house you say?
---
No wonder us samurai are getting second place .... your over here getting a DBD crossover and were getting beatin to a bloody pulp
---
Agree with your second point
---
I also think that whiffing with demon dash/strike should take him of his power as well or at the very least deplete a lot of it.
---
Doesnt even matter against Oni
---
😘&lt;Hag trap&gt;
---
it is frowned upon like it is in any game but what are u gonna do ban people for playing the game in a way I find boring that isn't very nice
---
She always had an animation just that it was invisible from a survivor POV, anyone who’s played spirit once would’ve expected this animation, they weren’t gonna change it :/
---
Then blame the devs for not allowing him to pick people up without losing his power. Don’t gut the killer.
---
Wait is this the otz that posted this?
---
What how?
---
You know that one guy who goes over the top at parties
---
I just wanna know why some survivors wonder why killers always bring the strong shit just like I wanna know why some killers wonder why survivors always bring the strong shit.
---
No, status effects and shit dont matter. You leave a set amount of blood orbs when you're injured and the only thing that changes that is addons
---
Now this makes me happy. 
---
I play both sides and it’s always nice for one side to get a perspective of another side.
---
So thank you for experiencing the pains of playing a killer and funny enough the reason why killer isn’t played as much lol.
---
There used to be one version but they added 4 more all with different layouts to make it more fun
---
He's not wrong but people dont like the obvious being shoved in their face
---
A lot of ppl consider Outlast extremely scary though. It's not as scary as Silent Hill obviously but still scary to the average person. Same goes for Dead by Daylight, at least early on.
---
I would be extra terrified lmao
---
Former, so Dec 3. PTB is 99% of the time, 2 weeks before the actual release (this gives the devs a whole week to do patches, and possibility a quick update within 2-3 days of the ptb going live to fix issues)
---
then he still put stbfl for oni *cringe*
---
through walls? I'd like to see that, trees well it might look like it goes through the tree but latency plus the range of the chainsaw makes it tricky
---
What if the killer served in the military?
---
Yes, i get annoyed when there's a swf group, but i dont take them seriously. Especially near the end of the game as ghost face and we all start t-bagging. Good times
---
As much as I love cosmetics, I hate them for one reason.. they get me tunneled.... I bought a tone of outfits for nea and I always get tunneled.. even if they have make your choice lol

yes, ive been finding that out. Just wondering, so many new mechanics!
---
Average. He does not have a strong enough bsae kit to consistently get 3-4ks.
---
You can just ignore it when its in the tree and let the entity eat it. Personally I’d just get it so it stops showing up.
---
There is a counter. Jump into a locker.
---
You literally posted this 20 hours ago
---
Survivors: *play 40 games against the same killers over and over, red ranks being filled with good killers since its actually hard to rank up as killer, having worthless teammates* 
---
Killers: *play one game against a decent swf*
---
Also killers: Wow we killers sure do have it hard
---
This was a joke.
---
I was deeply disturbed by the inn accuracy. Then I snip tooled both pictures into discord, snip tooled them next to each other, and posted the image link into reddit to express my outrage.
---
#killerlivesmattertoo
---
Really? I think they all are really worthless... restanding pallets is her only good perk... and its because pallets are op. So if you see someone drop one and abandon you can salvage it. Generally though I think it's only semi useful at best too.
---
Break out is ALMOST good. Hooks are way too close for a measly 20%, that and you have to he basically in hit range, and abandon doing the objective for a low chance save. 
---
The blood perk is mega worthless. Cant think of a good situation for it honestly.
---
Haha, good use of the meme format. Take an upvote
---
a Cursed Legacy
---
Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?
---
It wasn't average, it was M e t a.
---
It could drastically increase the viability of loops, either allowing you to gain distance like an on demand sprint burst, or run tiles for a stupidly long amount of time.
---
Man half of Nea's cosmetics make me wanna cry, they're terrible, wym? those board shorts, man
---
That’s why I disagree with him on her placement. I felt like some of his tier list was a bit biased towards killers that he personally enjoyed. I don’t see Myers for example being 6th best on the roster.
---
bc tombstone has a massive negative effect for a M1 killer while insta heals was click a button and win not on the same level but I do agree tombstone needs to be relooked at
---
It's called a [Kanobo!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanab%C5%8D) Basically a feudal Japanese war club
---
Its much faster. You break it almost instanly with the attqck, faster than any other killer
---
Biker Kate still the most peng one around
---
what do you even mean by dorky?sorry if there's no fireworks and earthquakes eveyrtime she vaults a window
---
The perk is fine where it's at now in the PTB
---
Looks like those Virginias from the Forest
---
Must be the haemorrhage modifier
---
Ultimately, how strong a killer is is defined by their ability to exert pressure around the board and overcome the weakness of being outnumbered 4/1 by the survivors. Demogorgon can do that, Hag can't. It's true she can end chases quicker, IF she's prepped, but so can Trapper. Both of their weakness is the time it takes to prep and their need to concentrate on a small part of the board to be effective. If you try to trap a loop midchase as Hag, a good survivor will just run to another loop, which with 110% movement speed is hard to punish.
---
And I think you're underestimating Demo's chase potential. There are a lot of jungle gyms where Shred can land a hit if timed properly, and baiting it can cause survivors to make mistakes a lot of the time.
---
Not in an even well lit scene like the chapter splashart.
---
It's not that bad. Red rank survivors are kinda dull in how quick they do gens but that's it. I dont think there more toxic
---
Or a nerf, BBQ plus this is nuts, i can find a survivor easily after a hook in 45 seconds without bbq
---
I've been doing this but I think I would recommend not gettinf teachables you dont use, that way other characters dont get fucked with only gettinf perks you dont care about
---
Since Bill is in the game and all, I thought spirit would be straight up witch from l4d when I started playing. Is she inspired by it or what
---
everybody seems to hate this but i think it's adorable
---
shorty spirit does a hopp
---
Ah ok right.
---
I wouldn't call standing still a mindgame but sure
---
True, but that isn't saying much. I'm not trying to sound like that obnoxious tough guy who isn't scared of anything. But the casual audience has that reaction to any decent horror game. And the thing is, if they get scared in the beginning they're most likely not going to keep playing further to the point where it stops being scary. More than likely, any further experience is continued vicariously through lets plays or streamers who will no doubt overplay their reactions for more views.
---
Whereas in the horror gaming community, something like Outlast is considered a joke for the most part. Something like Amnesia the Dark Descent terrified both casual and hardcore audiences.
---
If nobody is silent that means everyone is not silent
---
BAM BAM!!

Thank you

You can't get banned. I love how people report me if I do. Like it's against the rules or something.
---
You’re a crybaby
---
That still would be really strong
---
I played 5 matches in a row as Billy and finally was able to sacrifice every survivor. I had 9 total hooks, and I kept them from doing all the gens. It was the hardest and most nerve wracking game I have ever played. I thought, finally I did it and got the win but nope, because they were able to get 4 gens done. Because between instant parts, and other tool kit modifiers and 4 survivors it is practically impossible to keep people from doing gens without Ruin or Overcharge to slow them down.
---
I can play as Billy with his unique perks, but they are largely useless. Most people don't use flashlights and evasion is easy, so Lightborn sucks. Tinkerer only adds to stress because you should know which gens they are on just by logic, and Enduring is worthless because if you time your chainsaw right the pallets take almost no time to destroy.
---
I cannot imagine a scenario where I would waste a slot with any of these perks, let alone all three and only all three.
---
I had a dream and 3 of my actual friends were looping leather face on autohaven... I don't recall what happened exactly but I remember something about it being halarious.
---
I’m actually very dominant as both with over 4500 hours. I guess not everyone has the required intelligence to master and more importantly, understand both. 
---
Like solving two Rubik’s cubes at once.
---
You have to be closer though and its harder to control
---
it’s look awful.
---
How much do you play a day holy smokes.
---
His power is limited while oni's is not
---
This happened to a Detective Tapp  I played against as Freddy. For the life of me I couldn’t catch him. It took him to step in one of my snares to finally slow him down enough for me to down him. I thought he was cheating, but I messaged him and the other survivor he was playing with and they said they had no idea what happened. He just vaulted a window and that happened.
---
Yep, it used to be much worse too back in the day. Was a real challenge maintaining red ranks without playing only nurse
---
I've played 700 hours, most of which is survivor, and I've been tombstoned only once.

Wanna sprite cranberry?
---
I cleansed a Haunted Grounds earlier today and quietly said to myself, "Sorry team. If it glows, it goes."
---
Or like... not being a twat about dumb shit
---
It's great for stopping a survivor trying to get an extra loop
---
Could just be the same modifier that removes a Gen if one survivor is missing.
---
That was after forty years of survival training.
---
The Laurie in Dead by Daylight is 17 and doesn't 1v1 Myers and come out on top.
---
Done
---
Is he actually her father or a distant ancestor?
---
I forgot about this but dont you gain blood from landing hits on survivors?
---
I can't be the only one who feels they should just get rid of perk levels? 
---
Most of the difference between 1 and 3 are small and now in this case not at all.
---
Uhh, addressing old or new perk stats?
---
Lol press F to yeet survivor down hatch
---
No the premium rift is ony to unlock extra stuff like cosmetics, auric cells and charms
---
Are you sure you want the pass tho
---
Make deep wounds timer stop while in a chase. Easy.
---
Just don’t stun them lol
---
What's the oblivious status effect btw?
---
ok twitch ad
---
Yeaaaaaa I agree with that as a killer main
---
Saying the same exact thing isn’t what I’d call “trying harder”
---
I’ll say the same thing though, fuck off alt
---
Balanced landing deserves the nerf though. It's the only exhaustion perk with a permanent side effect. Its hurt my soul to see it because it's been my staple perk for a year now but its deserved.
---
Sounds like someone gets looped alot
---
I agree. I'm so excited to play against him as survivor. He's strong but not OP
---
Sailor costume Steve, he’s talking about you guys
---
&gt;There is a counter. Jump into a locker.
---
Any animation that forces a grab will counter a tombstone. Granted that a gen only lasts 80s, a totem 15s, chest 10s, etc. Locker is the best option but not the only one.
---
name checks out
---
Yeah it’ll be a new challenge, I’m saving up Iridescent shards to get him and I will play him all the time.
---
How does this stuff get missed? Or is this why they were nerfed . . .
---
Yeah use them up while you can. You go so fast it’s terrify. Also while you’re at it, pair him with that plague scream perk and monitor and abuse to slug bitches. SUPER good
---
Technically isn't Iron Grasp a hard counter to Boil Over? They basically negate each other. I agree that if it was too powerful it would be like old DS but as it stands it's pretty pointless aside from seeing a killer bump into a wall on his way to hook you. It falls into the meme category.
---
Hemorrhage doesn't increase the amount of Blood Orbs survivors drop
---
I have definitely used bluetooth headphones on my PS4
---
Many times
---
Yeah I didn't realise this was so wide spread. I hope they hotfix it because if someone can find a way to consistently do it, its gram breaking.
---
Feral Frenzy says hey. Corrupt Purge says hey. I actually completely agree with you, but the fact is that’s how it works with most other killers, so it should honestly be roster wide, or taken out completely. Corrupt Purge is the stupidest example to me.
---
No biggie. If you want good builds check out “not otzdarva” on YouTube. He does videos every day and he really explains what he’s doing and why
---
BL can activate on every map however it's usefulness on every map is extremely limited to only a few select maps.
---
Yeah but it will keep appearing in the bloodweb. I’d only ignore it if you don’t plan on dumping a lot of points into feng
---
old. You said it was an average perk, so I assumed you were talking about BL before the latest PTB
---
Maybe, though I have buddies playing on PS4 that get hate mail as often as I do. And they’re simply not good enough to be toxic
---
He honestly kinda seems like a handicapped Billy now to me. I’m happy for the people who are excited for him, because I feel like the only person who thinks he looks pretty damn weak.
---
Damn that light is dwight
---
Just kill him if he wont take hatch
---
Aight imma head in.
---
*3 seconds later*
---
Aight imma head out.
---
Dec 3
---
I’m glad I’m not the only one
---
I'm so sick of these pussy ass survivors complaining about spirit when 3/4ths of the killers are so underwhelming in high rank it makes it impossible to win unless you make it a somewhat even playing field by picking the spirit or nurse. SWF High rank is impossible unless we have killers like nurse or spirit and they keep fucking with them. Soon nobody will want to play killer
---
900 hours and I’ve probably been Tombstone’d 3-4 times.
---
Is it annoying? A little bit, yeah. But it’s not like I’m going to escape EVERY game. So I just treat it like a Mori and make a personal challenge in my head to last as long as I can, because I know I’m dead anyway. Might as well do some Gens and get some chases/stuns in.
---
Remove deepwounds from their frenzy and make it injure survivors like a normal attack, keep the tracking but only on healthy survivors within a certain range, reduce the speed of all actions and increase the cooldown on frenzy.. Maybe remove the terror radius during frenzy so they seem more like they appear in the trailer, of course that's still too strong so more counters will be needed. I also thought about what if frenzy applied the broken status effect for x amount of time, hitting them again applies deep wounds, and hitting them a third time downs survivors.
---
Ew, no, gross
---
Idk why everyone is crying about legion "nerfs" no other killer can activate status effects on survivors through their power. 
---
Guess all of you crying about it leapt for joy when the same shit was removed from pigs dash attack. Either that or you just threw it under the bus like it was no big deal.
---
Congratulation for the finish the Rift, but maybe take a break sometime you know, it is not healthy to be that obsessive with a game :)
---
It depends. I was always referred to by my last name. Many of my friends were as well. If you didn't grow up in an environment like that, it may be weird, but to me it's fairly normal.
---
Repost
---
Me going to retake my tests
---
That's monto's vid
---
Siiiiiiigh. I will never understand why people enjoy giving mercy.
---
I think so, idk how it interacts with Yui's new perk, but that perk does specifically counter Oni's power I think right?
---
As someone above stated it's usually consistent with powers that recharge themselves. Corrupt Purge makes no sense because it takes a significant amount to convince survivors to let you have it at all.
---
Probably an inexperienced player. 
---
The game by design feels favored towards killers at lower ranks (20-16 or so) 
---
Survivors dont have all the good perks yet and being a perkless killer is much easier than a perkless survivor.
---
Most killers seem op at first until you get some actual experience playing against them. 
---
Ive had plenty of friends who think killers are too quick or that 2 hits is to few and i have to tell them constantly 
---
“go play killer yourself and when you play against decent people you’ll be saying killers are too slow and that 2 hits is too many”
---
I've god and anime at my side
---
Why are they changing it. Why are they changing her at all...
---
Small correction, but probably my fault not mentioning when balanced landing was just released along with Nea. Again, you had stagger reduction percentages only. No sprint burst was there, I really don't mind it being it plain as long as falls take less time to recover.
---
...or because you guys have a wildly toxic opinion of *”this thing is shit and I don’t like it, so get rid of it.”* which is just mindless complaining. 
---
The whole point of it being a Very Rare Add-On is because you’ll em only ever see it every so often. It IS possible to escape before a Tombstone Myers can even reach Tier 3, depending on your team. The fun is in the challenge of trying to avoid it and see how far you can get, and maybe even beat him.
---
Wait they are reworking the Spirit?
---
Nopeee
---
“GUYS, Spine Chill is going off but killer is chasing someone else”
---
It's part of the reason I stopped playing. Would consistently be put into an absolutely foul mood because survivors would either bully the shit out of me then call me a baby killer, or would all get hooked and then call me a tryhard.
---
There was no winning, and fuck all sportsmanship.
---
But there were two stuck survivors and they both were Yuri's though..
---
Except if you know how and when to do it, it's called buying time for others. And in the spirits case, just run the opposite direction she expects you to run instead of dashing like a mad lad for that vault/pallet. Also I'm usually comfortable a rank 5, ive gotten red ranks but it was the most unfun experience I've had on dbd so never again.
---
A really really really distant ancestor.
---
&gt; if BHVR doesn’t nerf him to oblivion because of whiny survivor mains.
---
Why do so many people in this sub feel its ok to be so unnecessarily inflammatory? You could have easily made this post without that stuff.
---
Funny enough the game i ran no mither i actually never got hit lmao.
---
But you do drop blood orb things with no mither, i could see them around me when i was loading into the match. 
---
Id imagine since No Mither a perk that removes bleeding permanently still drops blood orb things Yui’s perk probably does as well although i haven’t tested it myself.
---
I personally don’t think that’s true. Just because it’s the only one doesn’t seem like a legit enough reason to me. The ONLY problem people had with it was that it was godly on Haddonfield other than that no one complained. You’re allowed to gave perks that are different so it’s fine that it had a stagger reduction effect. Otherwise that’s like saying Kindred needs a nerf because it’s the only aura reading perk(I think) that lets you see both killers AND survivors. Or Devour Hope needs a nerf because it’s the only totem perk that allows you to 1-hit down AND mori. Idk I feel like it wasn’t needed and I don’t even use it 😆 I’m a Dead Hard user and when it becomes too buggy for me to handle I switch over to Lithe
---
Look at mister Sherlock Holmes Jr. Right here. You really think a killer who has to work for his power and loses it whenever he picks someone up or runs out of time is OP? This dude is a good example of how killers should be. He may need some minor tweaks here and there but he really, really doesn't need a nerf considering he doesn't have a power most of the time
---
Then you get those bozos that cleanse with No Mither.
---
Because it always happens and it's true...
---
Look who shifting it the grass
---
Cuming*
---
Would honestly pay for it
---
Because every change has been because of survivor mains who have complained about completely balanced killers except spirit who was a little too OP. I could’ve made a post without saying that but just wanted to address that I don’t like the people who complain about every new killer. Not talking about survivor mains in general, just the ones who whine about every tiny advantage the killer has on them.
---
I mean, it’s not wrong.
---
They dont spawn frequently enough to make them more reliable than sounds produced by the survivor
---
I so wanted to do that but I know some people dont like seeing dirty stuff so I saved them.
---
bruh my guy be lookin' like Drax
---
Only cool thing about this dlc
---
More than half the cast are far from being scary. This collosal giant is quite unnerving especially when he activates the demon mode and sprint towards you
---
I'm lv 68 currently. I guess I just don't see what the big deal is? I've seen countless killers with the final reward so idk. grats tho!
---
“Future Steve main here”
---
Not sure why you’re getting down voted.. when you’re absolutely right
---
Because ppl love pinning two strong females against eachother a lot 🙄 it doesn't help with those "Walmart vs Chanel" memes on twitter.
---
I didn't deserve the 4k, therefore I didn't want to kill him. I only take 4ks that I deserve.
---
Yes they said this in the patch notes that she currently doesnt have her own, they'll replace it on live release
---
Got it, thanks :)
---
u/repostsleuthbot
---
I NEEDED POINTS :( I dont have a party to KYF with. Its the only peep I have bbq and chili with. Im sorry my build was so dirty too :(

Hah- hol up

All Legion has to do is moonwalk then.

Please choose one.
---
Which killers specifically? GF is a pretty solid killer, Freddy hasn't been nerfed since his rework, Plague hasn't been nerfed, Demogorgon hasn't been either. The only ones being nerfed in the last like year were Legion because Legion was legitimately full of exploits, Nurse was tweaked a little but is still top tier, and now Spirit which had a lot to do with their own internal numbers saying she was over performing than anything else.
---
Hmm somebody was quick to correct someone else when APPARENTLY they don’t even know what to call it themselves. Cute. :)
---
Nemesis ONLY activates when getting stunned or blinded. Its just bad wording by the devs
---
U can't top nurse even if u have insta downs to me The Oni is just a different Billy
---
No it doesn't
---
It’s too early for me to really make a decision 1 way or another, he seemed a little too strong at some points but that could easily be due to inexperience against him. 
---
I will say though i think playing against him was way more challenging than the demogorgon. 
---
One thing i hope doesn’t become the norm is every new killer getting pallet break with their power.
---
I look at Oni and go wow hes really nice. Then i look at wraith or bubba and go wow how the fuck are these killers supposed to compete with that?
---
Oni is basically just a much better leatherface.
---
100% way cooler than this MOH rip off
---
Then wait 4 minutes then, you can end the game. There is no reason a killer should be able to do that.
---
I think I legit had an orgasm when I saw that for the first time.!
---
Hex: Vibe Check - replaces all skill checks with vibe checks. Failing a vibe check will **exhaust/expose/injure** a survivor. The hex effect persists as long as the related hex totem is standing.
---
*Give me your vibes... I will check it*
---
oh hey you're on reddit too,did you like bricky's casefiles?
---
Its an unnecessary jab that isn't even true.
---
*Spirit cranberry
---
The thing is that it's passive ability is the reason why we love and use that perk. Honestly, the speed boost in BL was just a nice addon to it main power. And when BL was added to the game, because it's passive ability was the main reason why Bhvr added perk to a game (they added stun after falling in those patch). And now they take it away. Why? Did they really think that not newbie players really use it for the main reason because of speed boost ?
---
also, aren’t her VFX just megs?  Does anyone know if this is permanent? Or are they changing it during live? 
---
or maybe they aren’t megs and I’m just an idiot :,(
---
Now you know not to be greedy and toss the pallet right away if he's rushing.
---
I don’t really like pins but these are amazing. Really good job!
---
He cant turn around instantly so theres no point to hesitate to turn back
---
At 30 her first teachable will show up until you grab it, at 35 if you havent already grabbed the first one her first 2 will show up so you can grab the other.
---
So yes you could just keep ignoring 1 teachable and grab the other 2 if you want to.
---
I was sad to discover that furtive chase does not proc nemesis even though furtive chase does indeed change your obsession. Really wanted to combo chase with nemesis and make your choice, but I guess they figured that combo would be too nasty :(.
---
Hhhhhmmm... ( T )
---
You again, a shitty joke but a joke nonetheless.
---
I'll be real and say that using RBTs for the end stall was always a bad idea and unless you were hard built for it the traps would come off with ease, but I also put them on throughout the game to "Force" stalls at 3 gens over anything else so what do I really know on that matter.  With Legion here it makes zero sense given that he's already far worse as at least Pig's power can stall, and in rare cases, kill.
---
I don't think we should just make a legion and go "miss = lose power" seeing as it takes a bit to get his power up and ready u could just do like nurse and go "miss = a considerable slow down"
---
Reddit users seem to have an obsession with any kind of negativity or disagreement and will furiously downvote it, even when it is fully justified.
---
My theory is that the people who are on a game subreddit a lot. Like to the point it may be one of their top hobbies/their top hobby. Look at steam achievments for dbd - only 40% of people who bought the game ever increased their rank, only 1 in 4 people ever unlucked and used all 4 survivor perks. That gives an insight to an average players commitment - pretty fucking weak.
---
Now people on reddit, they play a lot more, know a lot more and experienced a lot more of the game. When confronted with a negative aspect, they often feel like a part of themselves is attacked. Thus, they take it personally, even when they really shouldn't.
---
But that's just a theory.
---

---
More legion members!
---
Why not? If you already have 1000 auric cells and buy the pass, you get back all of your 1000 auric cells from the premium track. So you get all the rewards from it for free essentially.
---
Oh hello Otz,have a nice day!
---
you knew exactly what you were doing, why not just own it?
---
That feels very weird for her, maybe do something like you can see her blipping in and out of reality through the window
---
Nah the blood orbs aren’t too much of a problem but hitting a survivor who’s healthy gives about 4% ability charge so maybe that should be decrease a bit but the blood orbs don’t even give that much
---
Honestly he just needs a whole new power like Freddy got, I dont think Legions current power is fixable and the nature of it regarding certain perks and the new undetectable status have messed with it even more
---
Idk why you got downvoted, you still leave the blood orbs when running No Mither and I’d assume Yui’s perk is the same.
---
I would say if you have some decent perks from other killers he's a decent pick. Just gotta learn when to chase invis and when not to. The silenced bell addon is pretty good to pick people of gens imo.
---
Um, can the killer be Dr. Manhattan's killer dong instead please? It looks like it could wreck a few people. Thanks.
---
bhvr needs something once two years ago and everyone shits themselves every time they release a strong killer
---
Nurse’s Addons got nerfed a bit back, Pig got nerfed, Freddy got nerfed a whole while back, Ghost face was nerfed, Legion is getting nerfed. Instead of buffing lower tier killers, BHVR constantly nerfs high tier killers based on survivor main suggestions. Freddy doesn’t need to be nerfed he’s perfectly balanced and his buff was a good job. Plague is also balanced and you will probably win against her if no one cleanses. Demogorgon is balanced and they even buffed it by making the shred able to break pallets and I think a few other stuff.
---
This is the only acceptable solution
---
Also, we know since last year that BHVR aims to release new DLCs every 3 months. 
---
If he missed that memo, there is still the new roadmap from the 3rd anniversary that shows 3 upcoming DLCs, the latest probably releasing in Spring 2020.
---
Unless nurse gets nerfed for no reason, if nurse stays as is then she will stay number 1.
---
He is extremely strong. I think a lot of people saying he is balanced have not played really good Oni players. A lot of people here on reddit are really bad.
---
Am I honestly the only one who likes this? It’s adorable!
---
Ah, I see you're a man of culture as well
---
Thats y u hook then close!
---
Don’t use bullet points with numbers pls
---
Well, Legion can be made much better with addons too. Generally tier lists go off the base killers, barring some very specific addons like old Prayer Beads for Spirit which rocketed her up to almost Nurse tier.
---
~you mean steve moaning?~
---
Only the houses?
---
Gotta throw in the occasional clown game
---
God damn that looks fucking stupid as hell. Like watching a chimp climbing through a window
---
Killers haven't gotten any new meta perks in ages. The closest is Thrilling Tremors in recent memory. Literally everything on Demo is trash and Oni's perks are pretty mid tier and situational with one of them being completely useless. Killers are in the same place, our only meta perks are Pop, Ruin and arguably BBQ. I'm not saying this shouldn't be changed for everyone, I'm just saying it's not a survivor exclusive problem.
---
Hee is too much of a unitnto be in only 1 game (and i love it!)
---
Spirit's mindgame is one-sided though. She reacts to what you do and punishes you for it while giving you no oppertunity to react yourself
---
I agree that we need killers like nurse that force a different style of chase is very fun,but spirit isn't because there's nothing you can do.You can see where Nurse is looking,how much she has charged,where she is going to land etc and you can actually counter her by blocking LoS as much as you can but there's none of that with spirit,which boils down to this:
---
1)Stay around the pallet and she watches for a bit,then phases to you for a hit.
---
2)Run away and she catches you for a hit.
---
3)She fucks up and you get to live for 10 extra seconds.
---
Pretty much
---
Got 'em
---
Getting hit through a window that you're 2 metres away from feels so shitty and is unfair.
---
Who's complaining? I thought it was amazing personally.
---
I LOVE dbd. I really actually do. But I can be honest when something I love has problems that need fixing and I don’t freak out when people point out said issues. Your theory sounds absolutely right, just reinforces that people are.... :/
---
Way too smooth for her, I think.
---
In my few games of this first day of the ptb he feels very strong going against him. I don't know how long his rage or whatever the term is lasts but it seems maybe 5-10ish seconds too long. Most games hes been a slug champion as his ability gives him the mobility to come right back to hook the moment anything happens. With my small amount of time his movement speed during rage all but secures the down for anyone not 5 feet away from a window or pallet and I havent seen it in action but Im betting the increased speed can very well shut down T Wall jungle gyms. Also from his kit looks to surpass the Spirit or at least in my perspective. He does the same thing as her but only half the time but gains exposed hits so Im not sure how many Spirits well see anymore. He does the same against Billy as well, in base form he isn't as good but in rage form he has the speed and control to get where he needs to be. Lastly I hate Blood Echo or really any perk or add on that takes our exhaustion abilities away as in a jam that's all we got aside from going for a 360 and such. On The Oni himself it seems to be pointless to have such a perk considering his movement speed and insta downs and I assume we're going to see alot more of this perk from many killers. 
---
Of course we all need alot more time to adjust to all the new stuff and The Oni himself so well see how things progress. 
---
Lastly I hate Blood Echo.
---
A hot pile of garbage that can improve to be good work is better than no hot pile of garbage at all.
---
They were going for the late game hook. They still could've managed it if they had just been facing the bill when they closed it.
---
Okay,I guess I ain't buying legion or pig anymore
---
Head on?
---
"Shit negro, that's all you had to say"
---
Nah it's just a mathmaking ban
---
Except the killer will always destroy it
---
Im selling Feng Min bath water for 1 unhook
---
You can pick him up and drop him repeatedly to force him to wiggle out.
---
I mean you can play survive with friends and it isnt cheating and its the same concept. I think its fine, but that's just my opinion.
---
I think you're taking this post too literally or you missed the point of it.
---
Oni sees the booty so he makes sure to **SMASH THE BOOTY**
---
That’s not cheating.
---
Demo was OP as fuck in the ptb too, but that was because people had to idea how to counter him. Give them time. It's always like this. People play as the new killer and play against them, they find the killer OP af but when the release comes and people play more then they start to learn. It becomes difficult to play the killer and some unnessessary nerfs come their way. My point is, give them time. People will understand his power and how to completely counter him. And tbh I really dont care about some streamer's opinions too much
---
Maybe because this isnt an issue whatsoever, if for some reason they wont take hatch kill them.
---
Yeah lmao
---
I doubt most killers would run Blood Echo because it’s not a top tier perk imo. Maybe 10% of the time a killer would run blood echo but it’s true that we do need some time to get used to Oni.
---
Guess you said “fuck it”
---
Hmmmm, that's true...
---
Players who DC: *suicides on hook instead*
---
Yeesh, Broken for 60? AND Thanatophobia effect with no way to remove it for 60 seconds? IMO that's almost as bad as infinite mending legion since it'll make games either super quick ((DCs)) or super slow. AND God forbid he stacks Thana perk, and Dying Light because I'd kms at that point
---
Not at all,the witch just gets mad when you get too close or point your flashlight at her OR if you make her listen to the midnight riders,she would just be an m1 killer with rage mode that made her much faster and gave her instadowns
---
The problem with balanced though is because of its effect, it allows for infinite loops on certain maps. Rather than reworking entire maps I think nerfing the perk is fine. I'm a balanced landing abuser myself so it sucks to see it nerfed but whatever, now I'll be using lithe lol
---
🎵Coz I got Thick Skin and an Elastic Heart🎶
---
Why? I am simply labeling each change with a number for readability's sake.
---
I don’t play the game particularly often, nor have I been very involved with the community, yet one thing that most would agree on is the toxicity in the community and the minority of survivors which simply complain for the sake of complaining. I’ve seen it, as a killer main, more than enough times.
---
Congrats, your eyes work!
---
Yeah, console is in severe need for an optimization patch. BHVR said there would be one in december...last November. You can heavily improve frames by disabling captures or, even more essential, having all of your data on internal storage. Other than that, you will improve with time as muscle memory develops.
---
And yet survivor mains won't listen
---
Legion has his power almost all the time (and legion is absolute trash so we shouldn't use him ad a standard) and Plague's Corrupt Purge is a range attack so you dont even need to go near pallets, unlike Oni who uses a melee attack
---
Yeah very well may just be my perception of things and hating stolen exhaustion but I believe that combined with Huntress/Clown exhaustion add on would be rather brutal.
---
Turn off chat/ block messaging. I did it and now I never get to deal with that shit
---
So happy for the Susie and Joey sweaters.Finally,at least some members of the legion can be warm for christmas!
---
Wow, using an in-game mechanic is considered ruining others experiences? Whoever thinks like this needs to stop being such a whiner
---
byeah.
---
Yet it lasts longer than Oni's
---
There’s not such thing as an infinite loop. You fault a window 3 times and then it’s blocked and by the time you do that 3rd vault killers already bloodlust-ed you so they can catch you easily. All that’s left is if you mind-game a pallet or fake a window but even then that buys like 3 seconds, if the killer gets “infinite-ed” then that really is all on them because the game mechanics prevent that: Entity and Bloodlust.
---
Really?

I don't believe in lines, tis the internet. Let the heathens frolic about
---
Kate with that weird half-bald blonde haircut would be a better Karen
---
Because at some point you will need to drop it and if the killer leaves it then it’s going to be another big delay for them to get you again.
---
No, there is a lot of stuff that wouldn't be a loop without BL. Also DH is meaningless on just any tile (you need a window or a pallet or something meaningful and you need to be precise) and it gives you exhaustion, with BL you can loop some additional stuff whenever you want
---
It still does what its meant to do? And you can stealth use it too. You just fall like everyone else otherwise.
---
If you upgrade to an Xbox One X this isn't really that big of a problem but I remember back in my Xbox One S days people who 360 would just make the game lag for whatever reason and it's like you said the game for some reason keep up with them spinning. This would be really obvious in places with trash cans burning and on any map with tall grass or corn fields.
---
Shame on y'all for supporting shitty developers. Game is blatantly trash.
---
She doesn't look Japanese in game either.

Reminds me of when Tapp suggested to use the hatchets in a Samination episode LOL

Yeah I forgot to say whose video it was opps

i hope legion dosent get nerfed  they are fine as they are like we dont want legion to be the next freddy oh yeah little hunting knife only make me bleed little hee hee like excuse me ik dead by daylight isnt realistic in any sense but just dont nerf legion idc about faster vaults now they have to tunnel even more to get a kill like they are already shit in high ranks but in medium low ranks the legion is fun so bvhr plz
---
What if his power was simplified.
---
Infinite time in feral frenzy, like the doctors modes but make it so when in frenzy he can stab all he wants but can't down. He has to take the stun and use a basic attack to down.
---
He'd be gaurenteed 1st hit but the survivor gets basically a free pallet stun when the killer tries for a down.
---
Pigs nerf had nothing to do with survivors demanding it though. Her kit just became a victim of not fully seeing every angle of how the end game collapse would change the game. Kinda like how certain perks became 100% useless (left behind).
---
Freddy got nerfed like 2 years ago and even the devs said they overreacted and learned from it and GF right now is a pretty lethal killer in the right hands.
---
Legion is kind of in the same place as MoM where the concept was pretty bad to being with so they had to hard nerf them and now they seem to be just messing around and putting out updates where everyone is like "uhh.. y tho?"
---
High tier killers have not been getting gutted. Nurse is still an incredibly good killer and I imagine Spirit will still be pretty strong after her nerfs and like I said, it has more to do with their internal numbers (they even said so for Spirit) than it does survivors complaining. 
---
I also think most everyone agrees that some low tier killers like LF need some love. Just because they've only really buffed Freddy, Hag, and Trapper (who needs more help imo) doesn't mean they won't be looking at others. I think they've even said Doctor is the next killer they're looking at buffing.
---
Why let it bother you?
---
I love it, please come cry in my inbox about how sore of a loser you are.
---
Idgaf if I used a key or flashlight, or if you feel like you got camped and or tunneled, by me. (I don't camp but I also don't give free unhooks from idiots)
---
There is no mercy in red ranks.
---
i would say fighting. As the Oni killed all "false" samurai, i'm sure he see a dead schoolgirl holding a katana like an abomination and an offense to the samurai order.
---
yeah removing perk levels would be really good it would make the perk grind a lot easier
---
thank you :)
---
What would make this trailer a thousand times more awesome would be a faint phasing sound with Kazan turning around and from fucking nowhere Rin reemerges and takes a swipe at him.
---
*WAHHHHHHHHHHHHH* ^you ^^big ^^^fuck^^^^er
---
thanks !
---
Forgot to say that I was Monto's video and it won't let me edit the title for some reason
---
He on live already has an addon that gives that exact same broken time. Also I am tweaking legion BASELINE I am not trying to make legion work with every perk in the game. Could someone potentially stack ALL of the game slowing perks? Sure but again I am trying to make legion strong enough to stand on his own. 
---
You don't see anyone complaining about nurse being able to use bbq, nurse's calling , sloppy butcher dying light and then just slugging you to death do you? No because that isn't about nurse its simply combing perks that benefit your killers strengths. 
---
Could it be annoying stuff takes a while to do stuff? Sure but its leagues better then whats current or old legion and the only other alternative would to be to remove the proposed slow down. And instead give legion some form of an insta-down.
---
You need 2 things to make a good killer, map control and game slow down or map control and the ability to end chases QUICKLY, usually with an insta-down. Pick your poison, i'd argue the slow-down and chain stabbing target switching is better for the health of the game overall. 
---
As it discourages tunneling, slugging, and camping, in addition it actualyl fits with the developers intentions of how legion is supposed to work.
---
Yep when I bought the game I thought it's a game that you can play casual to have some fun but many in this community seem to see this game as a Esport game and sweat really hard.
---
My honor ! :)
---
But bruh this new DLC comes with Nemesis which basically means if a non-obsession pallet stuns you, you can just vault over the pallet with your faster vault speed, stab them and then watch as they eventually bleed out since they are Oblivious.
---
I did just give him effectively a whole new power.
---
ahaha yus i understand why XD thank you tho ! :)
---
I'd rather call him Oni-chan
---
thank you so much &lt;3
---
Alright, cool so I was correct.
---
If you press your M1 button on survivors they will get no matter what,maybe discussions are becoming useless
---
yus ! even tho he is from the same family i don't think he ever had children to pass on his DNA to Spirit :)
---
Because you're perpetuating the idea that 2 people from completely different countries and different ethnocentric backgrounds are somehow similar.
---
What counterplay do killers have against that? Insta-unlock is a really fun mechanic for killers the play against.
---
Seriously it's really well done and the entire concept of it was really clever &lt;3
---
Unless you’re using Instasaw/crack billy, he’s easily one of the most balanced and fun to play against killers. A clear, choreographed ability that has mind games, counterplay, and a high skill ceiling. 100% respect anyone who gets rank 1 playing billy without using Instasaw/crack billy.
---
If the HUD tip actually said this, I would yeet a survivor down the hatch every game
---
INCREDIBILIS!
---
yus ! Oni wanted revenge on the false samurai and killed his father. Spirit got killed by her father and want revenge XD
---
Thats basically what I just suggested but without the increased map control, game slow-down and ease of finding said survivors to stab them. All things it will take to actually make legion any good.
---
Let him die and his seed will be planted into the ground, ready to sprout once again after 30 minutes of matchmaking.
---
I tried that once, he wasn't having it.
---
they would probably fight ^^ but i would love to see that :D
---
Not even a full day on the PTB and you're already calling a nerf, chill...
---
A werewolf chapter with a dark fantasy/high Middle Ages themed map would be baller, all the more likely with how archaic the new killer is
---
Nope, that's radiation.

feels like an m1 killer... until you get his power and can down an entire team if you play it right. I love him.
---
No, with balanced, there are a few infinite loops left. Well, technically they aren't infinite, but they are damn close. By the time you catch up they can loop the spot for multiple minutes in a row. Haddonfield being the most harsh example. Maps like Macmillan estate have a near infinite loop with balanced also, just to name a few. Again they aren't technically infinite, but they might as well be because if you decide to chase them and they use the loop it's a guaranteed loss.
---
To be fair the entity has it's own dimension so unless people figure a way to travel between worlds, it has nothing to be cautious about.
---
It's been well over 30 minutes, I hope his seed is doing good.
---
Not really, you just edited feral frenzy a bit and added a bunch of seemingly random changes to his speed and also removed the only interesting part of his power.
---
Feral Frenzy just isnt a good power and should be scrapped completely
---
same ! i reallty think they would fight more than hug tho :P
---
thx ! :)
---
New to reddit or just mentally ill..? Have a good one I guess, you are a dolt dude, seek help.

they only bend to survivor whining lol, havent heard any killer actively complain about BL, only for haddonfield
---
ah you might be right !
---
He stabs through the shoulder area.
---
&lt;3
---
Legion players dislike things that essentially disrupt QoL while ingame. I used to play him alot because he was the only killer that could 0k pip up because of his double stabbing for BP. The black out stun would be fine if what we are essentially seeing as a free pallet stun was worth more.
---
They had to test Oni's club so they used Legion's viability as a subject.
---
aah you insulted my family ! get smashed to the ground !
---
thank you kindly &lt;3
---
If you remove feral frenzy you remove legions entire identity that's akin to just removing legion outright. What I did was removed the mechanic that has made legion shit and a walking cheeseball since day one. Then, in turn, tweaked his remaining assets to work as the developers want legion to be played. I simply alligned proper play with what the devs want legion to be doing.
---
When someone comes in here telling us how OP Wraith is i'm totally fine with people telling them to get good. My problem is with how often I see these unnecessary shots at survivors. The last few DLC releases this sub has had way more post about "i bet these cry baby survivors are going to demand a nerf" than actual cry baby survivors demanding a nerf.
---
Its odd to me that people talk about how toxic survivors are, but then are totally hostile and toxic towards survivors in this sub (not directing this at OP, just saying in general).
---
thank you ! :3

I think it’s more of an issue with latency than anything. When it looks like you got hit through a tree it’s only the animation he does after the chainsaw that makes it looks like it. If they need to fix anything it’s dedicated servers.
---
Serves them well for leaving you in a 3v1 match.
---
I disagree. I mean, I go here a lot, got to rank 1 a few times, have like 560 hours or something in DBD, and am pretty active in the community.  
---
That said, I think DBD is currently in the best state it's ever been, and the Devs have been doing a pretty good job recently.   
---
They made a few mistakes and screw ups - that is 100% true, but they have been giving us consistently good killers since plague, consistently better maps (opinionated there), consistently better survivor perks, and gave us the archives and rift all at the same time.   
---
Plus when they did screw up (cough - Hollow Blight - cough), they still managed to work overdrive and get it out in time.   
---
Plus lets not forget what this game USED to be. It was impossible to do certain things as killer OR survivor due to broken spots, bugs, and overpowered items. They changed that for the better. Is the game or devs perfect? God no. But I honestly think they have done an incredible job recently with DBD, and I hope they continue this path with us
---
I think she's dead too though.
---
Imagine, she's racing her bike through Tokyo, and magically ends up in the countryside?
---
She probably crashed and died, probably instantly from lack of protective gear.
---
Feels bad man.
---
Totally agree with you. His power is useless because the way it was meant to be, it had no counter play by survivors. A guaranteed first hit and a massive slowdown with add ons and sloppy and thana. They nerfed him to shit first. And now nerfed him to... I'd say bellow the old Freddy. You literally have no reason to use his power now since the main reason for that was to apply deep wound, sloppy and thana. Now its completely useless and have to be changed and  reworked.
---
Honestly, that has no significant impact on game-play I see no reason to keep it as its just annoying and legion can't really do anything while stunned anyways. Ill add the removal of that to #6
---
Thana does barely anything as is
---
The haemorrhage is infinite the only thing that changes is the exhaustion but atm its unclear how it changes since the perk is always the same.
---
We were playing on this map and my friend kept yelling at me "OMG THIS IS SHREK ! SHREK IS COMING, THIS IS HIS SWAMP AND HE IS MAD"

I hope to Christ Breakout doesn't stack

Considering half of their front page are gender swaps right now, top 5 doesn´t even cut it.

Look how orange your upvote looks girl

No killer will ever top nurse he will be at the VERY best 2nd best but even then I seem him slotting in under Billy as 4th best
---
Bhvr you say?Ah yes enslaved boredom
---
that 5% is HUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE
---
killers can also do a force dc to other survivors as well so without dedicated servers I do not see how they could really detect who is really at fault
---
Probably just PTSD from when Freddy was murdered less than a week after release becouse some players started to review bomb the game instead of learning how to play against him. I agree that it is unnecessary btw.
---
Oni OP pls nerf (blendette flashlight main rank 12)
---
poor bill
---
All of the changes are made in tandem to balance legion, I'm not suggesting a set of buffs, I am suggesting an entire rework of how he works as a character. The increased speed after landing a frenzy hit is intended to combo with a map-wide killer instinct to enable him to better chain targets and slow the game down. Killer instinct not showing on survivors while in lockers is meant to provide the survivors counter-play. All the pieces need to work together to make a corherient character.
---
I'm pretty sure they played with current roster. Otherwise we'd heard about new killer back then. No way there'd be zero leaks
---
:( darn
---
Lmao that bait
---
Not when I can't put it down. That's my personal problem, at least on my console it's impossible to quickly put down a snare. It's super finicky
---
In fire for poses like this try making the upper arm longer it will look more natural, this looks great though great work 💖
---
Not really, The Legion's identity should be utilizing the fact that he is a Legion of people, which it currently doesnt. His identiy right now is: Fast agile teenager, which isnt really what he was marketed as to begin with.
---
Giving him a power that utilizes the other members of the Legion would ultimately be better to his identity. 
---
One idea would be allowing him to possibly place up to 3 members of the Legion into lockers and switching between them by entering a locker, granting him actually good map mobility, not sure what a primary power would be. Alternatively, entering a locker and switching between members of the legion and having them have unique abilities that apply pressure in different ways.
---
but Feral Frenzy just hasnt been balanceable and was not expected to be his power at all.
---
stop using sloppy butcher, if they heal legion becomes better at slowing the game
---
lots of killers are bad but only legion gets the memes because that has become a community joke at this point and people rather say lul legion bad than actually try and read the changes
---
you lost a b tier perk and a perk u shouldn't be using
---
and don't even mention Franklin's, what the fuck is that shit. scared of flashlights, u srs?
---
Someone made the same post on this subreddit about 30 minutes before you.
---
Plus, BHVR tweeted this 1 hour before you posted:
---
https://twitter.com/Behaviour/status/1196910700775518213?s=20
---
ya unless they are only added this on pc and switch for now since they have dedicated servers
---
Sometimes I wish they'd take the blizzard approach to balancing. They're so afraid of making something too strong that they never change what people are using.
---
nah loud doesn't equal funny, timing equals funny.
---
As a legion main I have to say that whenever I play I always find the best success ditching Frenzy asap because it doesn't do anything to help win the match. Obviously this has changed now given the fact you can't use StBfL in Frenzy anymore and the return of moonwalking legion but I still have to agree with u/zadeyboy and say that Legion needs a whole new power, not just a rework to frenzy. Also on that note, removing frenzy wouldn't be like removing legion; imo legion's gimmick isn't their power, it's the fact that there's 4 of them in one + frenzy doesn't fit that gimmick anyway. Don't get me wrong I'd miss Frenzy but you gotta admit it sucks as a power
---
Currently S-Tier. He has mobility, instadowns, tracking, just overall a really top tier kit. I really love him, especially his flavor and everything about him. 
---
I do think he might get some slight nerfs to his Demon Dash, not much, but he can curve a bit too much in it, especially with no collision stun. But hopefully they won´t nerf him too much, we could use another strong killer. 
---
He just needs to get the first hit quickly, which is not hard if you use Whispers or something to find survivors early, then he becomes a machine.
---
If he faced the Bill when he closed it he could have hit him before he opened it. Can't use items when you're downed. He also could have hooked first, or if he really wanted that late hook, carried Bill away a bit first. 
---
The biggest mistake here was that he didnt account for the key even though he had to have seen it while chasing Bill before.
---

&gt;Updated several Killer perks with the Undetectable status effect: Insidious, Beast of Prey, Dark Devotion and Tinkerer. 
---
Beast of Prey, before only taking your red stain, now gives you full undetectable. That's going to be absolutely insane for Legion.

I dont think its that bad

I just googled info about the hatch spawning. It was the wiki or whatever. First result I guess.

JUST to flex on the killer

I try, but the big man tenderised me like a cheap piece of steak!
---
Isnt it great
---
I just edited this into my comment but I recalled this chapter idea from a while ago that could fit Legion very well: https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/99he59/hotline_miami_chapter_the_animal_powerperks/
---
I dont play Legion much so I do want you opinion since you said you main him. Obviously not exactly 1:1 with this chapter but the general idea, with masks instead being switching between members via locker hopping or something
---
Sorry, but yes it does. I have yet to see a yellow-green rank player do anything decent against a red rank killer. From a red rank killer perspective, the game is exponentially more easy when you have them in your lobby.
---
There's a difference if it's say, a purple-green rank who just hasn't played in a while, but still knows what to do.
---
From what I’ve seen they’re simply just jokes referring to the minority. Some of them quite funny. I’ve seen way more toxicity in both the community and gameplay on the survivors side compared to the killer side. In the end, I think Oni is perfect as he is. Probably the best killer released yet. Given how lethal he is, it is logical to infer the minority of survivors will complain.
---
1/3 hits are related to wrong hitboxes, that’s ridiculous
---
Toxicity happens more often the closer you are to mid ranks, since most brown rank players want to learn the game and they often don't really care if they lose, and red rank players are usually good enough to understand their mistakes.
---
The mid rank players, on the other hand, often refuse to admit their mistakes and instead of learning and get better, they fault the killer from everything that happens.
---
High low tier without addd ons mid tier with even just yellow ones if you run a purple windstorm imo he becomes quite good
---
Hitting healthy survivors gives almost half a charge. Hitting injured survivors gives none.
---
You drop blood orbs regardless of bleeding frequency. This means that sloppy butcher and other hemorrhage perks have no effect on it either.
---
I don't mean the abilities, but the looks. Maybe also the sound :D
---
I also thought he should have a collision stun like Billy
---
I think your idea of this new status effect ist not so bad, but I would reduce the broken-effect to 20-30s (increasable by add-ons) and the reduced action time should only be available via add-on and only be affecting the broken survivor (at least as a, let‘s say, rare add-on, but all survivors as an ultra-rare?).
---
Instead, you could add a blindness effect to the broken survivor that lasts for the same time as the broken-effect?
---
What other cosmetics were leaked?
---
I physically cringed when I first saw that part, I am so excited to play against this killer.
---
Some people may wonder why survivors live again after not surviving a trial. The answer is PS1 Hagrid. He keeps them alive. He gives life.
---
Outstanding move
---
You're right.
---
It's Killer mains who want the strongest Killers nerfed!
---
Would be Min Denson actually. Feng is her family name
---
1/3 hits are related to ~~wrong hitboxes~~ connection / ping, that’s ridiculous
---
FTFY
---
The promotional material was definitely a letdown but you need to realize it was a calculated play by BHVR to make more money. Legion came out right around the time the cosmetic shop opened up. Low and behold legion has a shit-ton of cosmetics, go figure.
---
That said even if you let legion "teleport" between lockers and emerge as one of 4 different skins he would still have 0 game slow-down be a normal m1 killer and be largely map dependant on WHERE if at all the lockers are at. 
---
So that work work, and expecting BHVR to rework legion into 4 sperately balanced forms this late into the game? Its simply not going to happen. 
---
The beauty of my proposed changes here is no new art-work needs to be created, nor any new code. They can simply use the same coding for thana for the slow-down, the token system for the tokens and the healing system to remove them as counter-play. This is something they could do for very little time and money, something you could get up onto a ptb in as little as 2 weeks if you wanted to.
---
Good meme. I rate it 11/10 bloody katanas
---
What would be the killer
---
More than likely. I had a lot of fun playing as him, but also against him.
---
Only 2 nerfs I would suggest is his base walking speed and his walking speed whilst picking up blood. 
---
In my testing, he seemed to walk super fast.l normally, And his slow down whilst picking up blood was barely noticeable (still able to keep up with a running survivor whilst absorbing). Bare in mind, this was noticed whilst I playing as him.
---
Apart from that, I actually had great fun on both sides.
---
Great use of the format. Nice work!
---
Candy man
---
Considering how long it takes you to charge your power, wiffing once  before getting a down would straight up lose you the game in red ranks. For legion it makes sense since he has his power up every 10 seconds, for him it doesn't.
---
The spirit nerf hasn't even been fully implemented and already survivors have another killer in their sights.
---
His abilty to come back to the hook isn't much better than Hillbilly's, tbh.
---
If Oni gets nerfed, and Hillbilly *doesn't*, there's some double-standard buhlshiet going on.
---
Because I didnt know there was a new killer on the scene? I read your post as "I am new to playing killer and..."
---
Time for a little flip flop action if ya know what I mean lol
---
I mean maybe lowering the broken status effect might be acceptable, but making legion dependant on addons to function at a basic level is terrible design. You don't want a killer to always have to have the "right add-ons" to be playable because that shoots yourself in the foot for build diversity and creates a "best in slot" build EVERYONE is forced to run.
---
Ok sorry dedicated servers
---
Personally I really like him not having collision stuns, Billy has it but he can use his power all the time, whereas Oni needs to charge it, and it goes away once you pick a survivor up, so I am personally fine with this, it brings a bit of uniqueness to him...what feels a bit unfair is how he can just turn corners easily in dash and instadown you.
---
I used the add-on that increases it's range "considerably" however far that is. I have no idea. But still, I looked everywhere, until the map had 1% use left. 3 different times, on 3 different maps.
---
.. Obviously people calling for killer nerfs probably play more survivor just like people calling for survivor nerfs probably play more killer, that wasn't even my argument, but thanks for the snarky reply. 
---
My argument was that the devs don't go out and nerf killers into oblivion because too many survivors complained. At least not since Freddy over 2 years ago.
---
Green ranks are the worst for both sides. They know how to play and expect the whole rulebook followed, idiot players. Green rank killers finally face competant survivors and get pissy, green rank survivors are entitled af
---
The game is designed to be frustrating and so people went it by being toxic
---
He's still not good with your changes, them not having to do much is a "beauty", its lazy. 
---
Also I dont know what you mean by "where if at all", theres guaranteed lockers on every quadrant of the map so "if at all" doesnt make sense, He doesnt need to be able to teleport directly on top of somebody like Freddy, placing members in strategical locations to control the gens is a very strong mechanic. Giving him undetectable upon exiting the locker would even be a good boost to it
---
Additionally, please read the edit, since that ability is far more interesting than feral frenzy and what I proposed as well, with mask swapping being locker hopping instead.
---
&gt;It encourages slugging.
---
Sure, but only an idiot will stick around while that behemoth is flailing his Kanabo everywhere.
---
Let's see. Same move speed, bubba has a power that actually downs, legion has a power which wastes his own time and should never be used. Ye I think I have
---
Sounds reasonable, how about Atlas?
---
Bill is gonna have a hard time when he sees oni (he is already recovering from his flashbacks with plague)

Along with most who saw the teaser
---
You dumb bi-
---
It’s prayer beads that make her cancer to play against, not her power in general imo.
---
Best perk
---
Lol this guy salty cus he can’t play the game.
---
From what I can find it takes a killer 1.7 seconds to vault. If she’s not vaulting then you become aware in 1.7 seconds....or is that not a big enough window for you?
---
Besides when you have experience and understanding of the game it becomes obvious when she will vault and when she wont.
---
Otherwise you just position yourself in a way that you have time to react. Or you move and look for red stain.
---
I think I’ve been hit by a spirit window vault once from what I can remember. Dodged so many I’ve lost count.
---
But sure....it’s impossible!!! Lets judge everything by rank 20 standards
---
... meanwhile I 4K in red ranks as Clown/Wraith
---
How the fuck can you sell something that doesn’t support Bluetooth. 
---
Consoles are a meme
---
Well, I play as much killer as survivor. I can certainly tell that the frustration you experience while playing both sides is quite the same. BUT, I am a Spirit main, so shitty survivors don’t often last long. However, face camping or tunneling killers are a bigger problem. So playing solo in public without at least a DS is a suicide.
---
SPOILER:
---
I play around rank 3-5 on both killer and survivor on PS4.
---
Completely disagree, but ok
---
Looking at that new perk Nemesis? I don't think the nerf matters anymore lmao.
---
Two of the sexiest men in the universe, and you brought them together
---
I only ever play killer, but the first survivor to get heels in their cosmetic will instantly be my new main and you can forget me ever playing anyone else
---
His tracking isn't god tier at all. It shows you where a survivor has been, you still need to pick a direction to look etc. 
---
You have to either sacrifice your first chase and move to another or follow one person round for half an hour because his power will only be reasonably close to full after two hits on healthy survivors.
---
The flick on his charge might need to be changed because you can currently rotate about 180 degrees.
---
His snowball requires him not to pick anyone up so unbreakable becomes even stronger against him.
---
His map pressure and pallet breaking are strong during his power but if survivors just immerse and wait out his power then he can't do anything and if you jump in a locker, he can't get you without deactivating his power.
---
Please bhvr let their be a 2v6 mode
---
I've heard the excuse of "balance" one too many times and have had enough. Killers are not kittens, at least they shouldn't be. With the devs having nerfed the top 2 and pretty much ignoring the lower tiered ones for the longest time aside from nerfing them even more, it's enough now. IF they nerf him in the PTB, they'll go overboard again, there's literally nothing at this point indicating anything else.
---
No thanks.
---
Me too, but not the ghoul-looking from Until Dawn. More like the deer-head wendigo.

Small suggestion. Him teaching his great great —— grand daughter how to properly use such weapon.
---
He’s like those angler fish at the bottom of the ocean. The light draws in prey, and when they’re just close enough, he strikes.
---
New killer idea BHVR?
---
8 survivors is a little to much for any 2 killers, reduce  that to 6 and thats a little morr fair
---
I much prefer this type of event with simple offerings for more BP and cheaper bloodwebs than what we got with Hallowed Blight last year. The game was unplayable as survivor because people would suicide for juice, and way too many killer mains got boosted to a point where they just got destroyed when the event ended.
---
Mid-chapter patch added a ton of great balance changes, sound has finally been fixed to a point where it's relevant and overall the game is in a much better state than when I took a break earlier this year. I think people are just happy to be discontent.
---
What is with that neck? It's as big as the Oni!
---
Is this bait, sir?
---
Hold up... is her hand backwards?
---
Where is the image from?
---
It’s her other hand behind that one, but I’m seeing it now lol.
---
Truth is, the family was cursed from the start.
---
fr, this made me think of having ghostly/undead cosmetics for the Survivors. Like they've been offed so many times they never fully recover anymore, having forgotten what they used to be like.
---
Well compared to other fandoms r6 is very tame.
---
Really strong when the power is active, incredibly weak when it isn't.
---
If he takes a long time to get the first hit on the first survivor he basically loses the game and if he activates his power and doesn't get a down the game becomes a lot harder to win.
---
That said when the power is active he is really strong and could diwn the entire team if the survivors aren't careful.
---
Also lockers hard counter him since if he grabs you he loses his power.
---
Honestly legion with this perk is completely fair
---
New Shrine?
---
Why is that?0
---
Expect everyone would do it. You might as well remove the ranking system if you added this.
---
And make it double
---
Stole that jawline from tru.
---
I love all the little details and clues they've started adding in recent updates. We've really gone along way since the days of insta-blinds and perma sabo
---
When I scroll through my killers to choose one, I never even notice Legion. For me, his power is just boring and I can't be arsed.
---
**She's a Disgrace**
---
Fake people usually irks you and you hate being with them. When you're repairing a generator with an injured survivor, receive a 5% bonus repair speed.
---
*"She's a disgrace, a disgrace to humanity."*
---
**Head Bitch In-Charge**
---
Nobody messes with the head bitch in charge. Escaping the killer's grasp will stun the killer for 2 seconds more and cannot move for 1 second.
---
*"Yes, It is she! The HBIC is in the motherfucking building, I'm in the house!"*
---
**Do It, Slap Me Bitch!**
---
Your enemies are the most annoying people in the world thus you protect yourself from them. When you're in a healthy state and got hit by the killer, you receive one token, maximum of 3 tokens. With every token, receive a 2% bonus running speed. All tokens are consumed once you fully healed into healthy state.
---
 *"Her breath smelled like straight up shit. A toilet full of nasty ass shit!"*
---
So a few things, first I gave the edit a read. The perks are all way to situational. Secondly that is WAY to much complexity for a single killer, while also not being too useful or making sense. Like for example "lower reach but normal lunge" the heck does that even mean? Atack reach is based upon your movement speed and your lunge. So does that mean that particular 1/4 mask is 110% movement speed? That just seems like a nightmare to try and balance.
---
Secondly, I have watched enough umbra and scot jund to know that where lockers spawn/if they do is extremely inconsistent across the maps and would just make the legion too map dependant to work.
---
And yea you could say the changes I am suggesting are "lazy" mainly because I am not trying to reinvent the wheel here, I am trying to take what currently makes legion fun to play and what the developers want legion to do. And enable him to be rewarded for playing that way while making the changes simple enough from a technical standpoint they stand a chance of actually making it into the ptb or even live.
---
Bloodnorbs dont dissapear tho. They still leave orbs while injured but you dont seem them while in blood fury. Also slugged survivors leave no orbs.
---
More tidbits : hitting healthy survivor with m1 charges 33%? of his power (not sure about the actual percentage)
---
Let's be honest, it's more of a microwaved fix rather than fresh.

Hell yeah! And they can ride off into the sunset (or the maw of the entity)
---
If anything BT became a better perk
---
This better be a copypasta or this subreddit is actually hopeless.
---
That's also going to be nerfed 
---
Yay
---
Adrenaline, Spine Chill, DS, Dead hard
---
Nah that's not true. I get hit so many times even when im a few steps away from a vaulted Window eben though I have a good connection and a ping of 9.so that's defenetly hitboxes since I dont think there are many people with a better connection
---
Her nails sealed the deal for me to main her lol
---
Thank you for actually providing context, my friend.
---
my wlw soul immediately cried out when I saw you, oml
---
It's funny how weak and restrictive Legion is compared to this
---
Change chase music into "All star", and when he charges he yells "GET OUT OF MY SWAMP"
---
Because it’s the only exhaustion perk that’s map dependent.
---
Yeah, but it would rely on a machine and I don't have that much faith in Behavior's technical ability.
---
Honestly I'd rather them remove the button mashing, but at the same time there's moments when suicide is a good choice, such as discouraging an impossible save so that a teammate will just leave and live. Or maybe dying so the hatch will open. It is wrong to suicide to leave, but as long as there's a good reason to die on hook, punishing people for giving up is a risk I'd rather let lie.
---
He is fine. Just don't feed him and run to safe spots.
---
P.S. I know this is very likely a joke, but I'm genuinely scared they are going to nerf new killer just because everyone hasn't got used to him yet
---
D'light Bulb
---
God you must be fun at parties.
---
Its easy to say why this comunity is so toxic. Because the game is extremely killer sided. So if you play killer there are 4 people wich from the beginning of the game are sentenced to lose.
---
exactly what i thought...just run straight into the killer when the match starts, kill youself on first hook. later. only thing that changed is, that you now get some points instead of zero xD if people wanna go out of a match, they will find a way...
---
they are right. lol you're an obvious bubba main.
---
personally attacked much lol
---
Nemesis doesn't grant oblivious unless you're stunned with a pallet or headon or blinded
---
Not being a dick is a solid play on this scenario.
---
Wait, is that *ACTUALLY* Natalia Dyer hugging her in game self on a pillow or am I just stupid? Cuz if so, I need that image in my life ASAP
---
And so Rin, who had cheated death in her house inside the Yamaoka estate, cheated death once again, and The Entity's realm was forever changed.
---
not main but he doesn't seem nowhere near being too op,if anything he needs a buff
---
You know what, my bad. I didn't see he was slugged.
---
As he should be. We dont need more low tier killers.
---
Lol okay I see it now too
---
I thought she's twerking
---
More like, slight inconvenience  
---
Survivors:DC
---
So noone is going to talk about the fact that on the second picture, the survivors are in the wrong hands?
---
The fuckin motto
---
Yup. BNP and instaheals getting nerfed was totally because of whiny *survivor* mains. 
---
Get outta here with this shit. People bitch on both side, some people bitch about both sides, but stop looking to antagonise for no reason.
---
I actually didn't know you couldn't use keys while slugged, I thought that you could.
---
Default steve with the sunglasses cosmetic?
---
Yes ma’am
---
They're not unfun. They're just too strong which makes the game easy making it less rewarding as a killer. And then they give you to big of a punishment or no counterplay which sucks for the survivor
---
Again,the locker hopping isnt his primary ability in my post, I specified this in there but you seemed to just ignore it twice now, in short it's just an additional ability like Freddy's gen hopping that allows him to have map pressure, which is far more important than slowdown (this is why nurse,spirit, billy, and freddy are top tier, Freddy is the only one with inherent slowdown). I edited my previous comment to expand on this, so please read that. Once again, it doesnt matter where exactly the lockers are, as long as they move you significant enough of a distance. Every quadrant has atleast one locker, so even if it isnt  particularly close, you still traveled a much greater distance than you would have by walking.
---
But overall, I think Feral just needs to be gone and you're dwelling on it staying way too much. 
---
I agree some of the post is worded poorly,but I wasnt intending the masks to be 1:1 with the Legion members. The sentiment of the idea is the point of linking it. Additionally, you shouldve just ignored the perks since legion already had perks.
---
Alright, a couple of things and I appreciate you keeping this discussion civil. First BHVR has been know to take pieces or entire sections of people's suggestions prior in the past, so never say never. 
---
Secondly, even if lockers were reliable and he got the undetectable status upon leaving for a set amount of time, good survivors still aren't blind, there is a reason demogorans aren't constantly getting gen grabs.
---
Thirdly the current "slow down" he provides is meaningless, exploitable and a gigantic waste of time for everyone involved. Because deep wounds bears no fangs and can be done safely the moment legion isn't chasing you. Meaning the time it takes legion to catch up to you stab you and then make it to someone else and stab them you have likely already mended and the cycle continues.
---
The reason for this are numerous, but it mainly boils down to a lack of time, poor power duration and poor power movement speed increase. This also has the added effect of making his overall map control quite shit. 
---
In addition, since once he does get someone in deep wounds he is stunned in place for a solid 4 seconds and then has to chase the person as a normal m1 killer until he eventually spirt-fury endurings someone or a survivor fucks up.
---
Thats why legion is hated its not because he makes games slower, its because he is never actually doing anything but wasting EVERYONES time. With these changes, he will stab everyone, then chase someone as a normal m1 killer after the much more reasonable 2-second stun.
---
The difference between the current legion and the rework I am trying to push it the level of effectiveness as well as built-in counter-play.
---
Spirit is busted because you cant see her therefor you cant react to what she does. Oni however has counterplay like every other killer. He's been out for a day, for fucks sake. Give everyone time to figure him out before calling nerfs.
---
I had the same reaction when I started playing survivor after playing 400 hours of killer. My God it's awful there. You survivors are just as tough, especially the ones in solo queue.
---
What about frequency of blood drops though?
---
Where have you seen him?
---
It's a still from Resident Evil 2 Remake, This motherfucker would be ducking through doorways whilst chasing your ass
---
You must high or something. Killers are the ones complaining about BL lol. Like a survivor is gonna complain about a perk that favours them.
---
This comment is super underrated, and now I really want to see fan art of my two favorite big bois together
---
Nemesis is a pretty great perk. Changing Obsession is a great mechanic for Obsession-based perks like Rancor and the extra Oblivious slapped on it for the new Obsession is also nice. Not always-useful-S-Tier but great synergy and interesting builds. 
---
Lucky Break deactivates and preserves charges once you heal up so it's much better than expected, you can save it parts for the next chase. Combine it with Iron Will and you leave absolutely no blood pools and you are completely silent.
---
Nah, it's a Legion/Billy combo. It's pretty crazy, so they want to limit the amount of times you get it per match. So it gives you the choice: do you want to get a guarantee hook on the guy you just smashed, or do you want to risk using it to its full potential and attempt downing another survivor(s)? I don't think your idea is crazy or anything, I just think we will want some play time to see if his ability frequency is low or something.
---
No! Don't do it!....... I'm a virgin.
---
Idk why ur getting downvoted I see how this w BBQ could be pretty good, but at the same time idk if people will think it’s good enough to trade out ruin or pop
---
You can clearly see she has blonde hair in the trailer, the screenshots and the gameplay so it’s your own dumbass fault if you buy the dlc expecting anything different
---
How about she crawls through it similar to demogorgon 
---
think of “the ring”
---
It's so stupid, I love it
---
Stop fixing shit that isn't broken and fix the damn game.
---
Swf match making has about a 30% failure rate on xbox. People two or three steps past a vault can be hit. No cure for tunneling. No cure for camping. No cure for body blocking the killer. Invisible survivor skins. Ruin is still mandatory. Hook sabotage has no regression. Sabotaged hooks reappear too quickly. Ridiculous frame rate drops.
---
your loss then
---
*In Recent News: Ghostface Mains Rejoice!*
---
Yea it's a joke. I didnt played hin or against him yet because im not home. But for what I Heard tho He is indeed pretty op because:
---
1. Can be fast but more precise than Billy
---
2. One hit multiple players
---
3. Track down people pretty precisely because of blood orbs and with the aura addon even exactly see them every few seconds
---
4. It's so easy to get deamon Mode
---
5. He has almost no down site
---
*Every killer change and it’s not for no reason because BHVR makes a good balanced killer and then survivor mains complain about it and it gets nerfed so it’s not a good balanced killer anymore.
---
Stop caring about pixels?
---
What the frick
---
Busdy, quick hint, if they already have Bloodlust, you ain't going anywhere,
---
Now you need to face swap Hagrid and Clown
---
Aw thanks, hopefully we'll start seeing some fanart of them in the future, they could be very good friends I think
---
Literally every map balanced is useful except some where it's broken. Rather than rework the maps which is significantly harder to do, they can just nerf the perk. It's a very reasonable nerf.
---
It's really competitive, especially for survivors since it's either win or lose, while killers have a sliding scale for winning. You gotta grow some skin and live with it, or turn off chat and live without it. Personally, as long as the trial wasn't tortuous for me, I find it humorous to see people get so fired up over a mundane match. I think attempts to control behavior end poorly, pun intended.

Kate is also a biker and also a musician and also a mountain climber
---
You silly silly survivor
---
Lvl 3 makes it 120 sec btw. Not that different but still
---
Ahh, Bam Bam. Bing bongs bff
---
Right the incredibly powerful slow movement speed increase that is canceled by swinging, getting hit by a pallet, breaking a pallet, and losing chase for longer than 3 seconds. Clearly the first round of nerfs wasnt enough.
---
No, otherwise people would be freaking. Did anyone here participate? How was it?
---
it could be a nice idea if we could raise the pallets
---
Instead of petty squabbling, we must unite against our common enemy: *Default Nea*
---
I hope they find a balance of making him a good top tier killer without being too broken
---
Somewhere higher than billy but lower than pre-nerf spirit would be epic
---
Already got a nickname for him, mr steal-yo-tongue, the famous Japanese tongue stealing fat man!
---
You know the glasses shine move from anime? He got it backwards
---
Your examples of "balanced killers" are all the top tier killers though? If they are overperforming of course they will nerf them. 
---
People get this mad idea that nerfs and buffs are like, purely based on community feedback, but it's bullshit. They look at the data my dude. If killers are dominating too often, they will rework them, same as if killers are underperforming. It takes time, and they certainly don't always get it right, but that's just how it works. Blaming other players just makes you look like a twat.
---
I've had it where I was Rank 10 and went up against a 4 man SWF, all of them being Rank 4 or below.
---
On Haddonfield.
---
That was not a fun game.
---
I'm on console and I haven't run it in months. I chalked it up to me just being bad, but apparently it ended up being a legitimate issue.
---
I didn't hook a single person this entire match, unless you count one person at the very end who walked up and stood under a hook gesturing.
---
Fr. I only enjoyed killer side but after how toxic most survivors seemed I just said fucked it and uninstall. Good example of a good game ruined by it's playerbase
---
I was playing my level 13 wraith with 3 perks and one brown addon today. All 4 survivors tbagged and used flashlights all game. All 4 had DS and aggressively body blocked for each other, so I assume it was also an SWF.
---
I was just high as fuck trying to play some games. Why do people have to ruin my day like that?
---
But miss by one block
---
Not if you bring Frank's Mixtape
---
On one hand, respect for not giving more money to the man. On the other, you play so much the pass might actually be worth it for you.
---
Windows and pallets hit need work 100%, but i think thats more of an issue with the game itself and not billy alone
---
Lmao that would’ve been an ez 4k for me
---
Well good news for you, that’s a new survivor perk
---
My main problem with Oni is that he encourages slugging too much
---
Ogres have layers. Like an onion
---
congrats. you can beat low rank players and an even lower rank player couldnt...
---
cool story bro
---
My Frank's Mixtapes and Stab Wound Studies are ready.
---
I think I managed to get _one_ hit in the entire game.
---
They just teabagged, flashlight clicked and bullied me the entire game. :(
---
Im fine with legion not having the nemesis synergy. If he becomes op near spirit billy level, i wont be able to use him. I like the mid tier killers because its a game for everyone. top tier killers is mostly just a game about you, theres nothing they can do from the very start.   
---
Mid tier killers you do good you win, you do bad you lose.  
---
Top tier klillers you do good you win 5 gen, you do bad you win 2-3 gens
---
I get killer games almost instantly right now where survivor takes a few minutes or so. I'm in na
---
Honestly I'm not that into either character, map, or perks, but I enjoy having new stuff to play with, and I might change my mind once I try it out (I'm on PS4 and Switch so no PTB sadly).
---
That said, this is partially coming from someone who mains Ash and Ghostface and love them. 
---
This new killer seems like a mix of Doctor's tracking abilities and Hillbilly's chainsaw. Interesting combination. I have a feeling this will be a good killer for new players to play as.
---
New survivor has amazing lore and I can't wait for her tome memories.
---
From what I saw, I liked:
---
- map mobility;
---
- potencial 1 shot down;
---
- some good add ons;
---
- he's quite scary, very big and very noisy, which can be intimidating;
---
I don't liked:
---
- he's basically a m1 killer at the beginning, worst than clown;
---
- he's very noisy, you can literally hear his footsteps and know which direction hes going to so no mind games on t walls and tiles;
---
- because he gains his power only after hitting someone, and because he's so noisy, I think once high ranks survivors notice him, they'll be super stealthy and it'll be very hard to find the first survivor;
---
- his actions takes a loooot of time, not only you have to search, find, chase, hit someone to gain your power, you also have to collect the blood which takes time, and also his animations to get into his power are also very slow;
---
- after all the work, once you pick someone you lose all your power...
---
Overall I think he has a few flaws and will be a mid tier killer.  He's like Myers who need to stalk survivors to gain his power but Myers is very stealthy and it's easier to do it and he doesn't have to hit survivors to do it. And everyone agrees Myers is mid tier. So let's Wait to see the live version and if they buff something.
---
No other killer gives you information like that just with their base kit. That alone makes his tracking OP.
---
And to top it all off, I was trying to do a ritual (chase for 180 seconds as Huntress) and I finished the match with 179/180.
---
Eh, the only people who act like an ass are people who only play one role. The good news is if you master both roles you'll dump on them regardless of their hours played, not that I've gotten there yet.
---
Drop the pallet...just a little bit.
---
&gt;without challenges it's so slow to get rift fragments
---
Yeah thats.... kinda the point? That's how every battle pass is. They give you challenges to gain pieces of a tier. Sure you can slowly earn them without challenges, but it's way better to do em.
---
I'm just glad that the challenges arent behind a paywall like most other battle passes. I wanna see how far I can get in the rift before deciding if I wanna buy it
---
*proceeds to camp every generator, hook and pallet on the map*
---
Just play as SWF much easier and much more fun.
---
You are Actually 300 IQ, thank you for this idea
---
Use both?  
---
Nemesis for no TR for the obsession. Furtive for no TR to the team
---
Nemesis has great synergy with things like Play With Your Food. Anyone who stubs you or blinds you is a guaranteed down with that combo.
---
Ehhhhhh no thank you
---
&gt;#MATCHMAKING 
---
&gt;Recently, the matchmaking system was changed to use the highest rank in a Survivor group when searching for a Killer. This change prevents groups from using a single low ranked player to abuse the matchmaker and get less experienced opponents. 
---
&gt;We are on the lookout for any potential edge cases that may remain. To give you an idea of what is expected of the matchmaking system, here’s how the system works: 
---
&gt;* Survivors are matched to a Killer as close to their rank as possible. 
---
&gt;* **If the Survivor is playing with a group, the highest ranked Survivor’s rank will be used for matchmaking purposes. (e.g. If a rank 1 and rank 10 Survivor are playing together, the game will search for a rank 1 Killer.)**
---
 
---
&gt;* If a match of the same rank is not available, the system will gradually expand the acceptable range until it finds a match. This has a hard limit of 6 ranks above or below your rank. 
---
&gt;* **New players between rank 16 and rank 20 receive an exception to this rule in order to ensure that they can find a match, even when there’s no other new players queuing.**
---
&gt;* You will not be matched with someone outside of a given range. This is to ensure that your connection to other players is as good as possible. When on dedicated servers, players will be matched to their nearest data center rather than their distance to other players. 
---
&gt;* Survivors playing in a group with distant friends are an exception to this rule. 
---
&gt;If you experience something outside of this range, please be sure to let us know here: https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/categories/other

[DEVELOPER UPDATE | SEPTEMBER 2019

---
You cannot repair generators if you ain't cute
---
My computer decided to start installing a huge update so I'll probably make this last post on my phone and the drop this conversation. No offense or anything lol. Also I'm aware this a response to my edits after asking you to read them in a reply I made at the same time you made this post lol.
---
1. I guess, but I really doubt they would regarding anything this drastic. Usually it's only things like the current spirit nerfs
---
2. It isnt for Gen grabs, it's for getting close enough to to get a hit. Non stalking ghostface is one of the most popular and strong builds right now and its purely based on utilizing the fact that he is undetectable while shrouded to get hits. Demogorgan isnt good at this since he walks like he weighs 600 pounds. So I have to disagree with it being useless.
---
3. We are agreeing here, so no reason to respond.
---
4. You are saying Legion is hated because he wastes everyone's time, which is the same thing as saying they hate him for his slowdown. His slowdown is what is causing everyone to waste time, I think we are unintentionally agreeing here as well.
---
"With these changes, he will stand everyone, then chase someone as a normal m1 killer after the much more reasonable 2 second stun"....Uhhhh this is how people already play him on the current live build, all you did was reduce the stun by a few seconds as far as I can tell. So I'm not really seeing the point here
---
Anyways, we have different opinions on this and I'll leave it at that. Hopefully he becomes not shit someday atleast
---
I have no clue why I'm still in this sub, I stopped playing a while ago. Who TF said that?
---
&gt;Nah that's not true. I get hit so many times even when im a few steps away from a vaulted Window eben though I have a good connection and a ping of 9.so that's defenetly hitboxes since I dont think there are many people with a better connection
---
#[Guide: Hitbox](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
Doctor gives better. Plague means everyone's injured (and bleeding). Legion can find any unstabbed survivors in their terror radius during FF. Hag can be constantly in a chase if you play her right.
---
GOLD 3 MINUTES IN?
---
How much easier do you need it to be? They've increased the score event points so you earn more BP faster for literally everything you do and they've changed the bloodwebs so that you can buy 2 perks in 1 bloodweb once your character level reaches 40. Theres literally no grind for perks at all at this point. The only thing that sucks is the perk rng of the bloodweb. Not to mention you can still trade shards for teachables so it's even less of a grind.
---
It literally can't get any easier to get the perks you want now unless they just hand them all over to you. 
---
Why are people so fucking lazy?! Holy shit.
---
Self gold pretty obviously
---
Survivor main approves your points xD good thoughts
---
Also r/uselessnobody
---
Nah she's clearly Wario's distant cousin,WHAAAAAAA!
---
That's a pretty petty argument if you ask me. Like others said, this is all stuff you'd do normally by just playing so I dont see why giving you a reward for things you'd do regardless is a bad thing. I see a lot of people complaining about the "grind" of the challenges and it just doesnt make sense to me. You're gonna play the game anyway right? So why does it bother you that you now get rewards for playing the game?
---
Yikes!!
---
He hasn’t even been out a full day yet, you can’t really call him op especially if you haven’t even played him..people are still learning.
---
Not top but pretty close, he'll probably be tied with Billy after the inevitable post-PTB nerfs.
---
Also this is first post of OP in a year!!
---
Yea... What? Before the dedicated servers the hitboxes where just as Bad. I mean it got a little bit better because you and the killer are on the same Page but now they need to fix hitboxes. I mean... Did you ever inspect the hitboxes in Unreal engine?!
---
B-but my precious 2.5 seconds!!
---
In all honesty, I dunno how useful this perk will be. The only time a killer shouldnt kick a pallet is if it's a super unsafe one, and even then I dont think it's a big deal if that pallet gets reset as it should be unsafe.
---
There's probably over 100 perks for survivor and killer at this point. Perk levels made sense when there were 4 survivors and 3 killers but now the roster is pretty expansive and leveling a new/prestiged killer or survivor is downright painful and unless there's an event requires weeks of preparation.
---
Wait, If the pallet gets broken, can u reapir It?
---
Seriously. Isnt it always the school girls that have some superpower and superhuman strength and speed, not the big guy in armor, with the japanese?
---
And that’s why battle passes are trash, and bhvr does not want you to get free skins
---
Thats what we've been saying about Pig but as far as i know theres been no news about it for pig
---
I think it should definitely be toned down. Granted the PTB has been out less than a day, but it’s a little ridiculous to be able to get 4 instadowns with such low cooldown/effort.
---
Could Rancor be used with this build to help find your obsession since nemesis only shows their aura for 3 secs?
---
Second unrelated question: if you kill the obsession, can another survivor become the obsession? If so, how?
---
The camera from when you do the demon rush is horrible
---
Infected started to mutate into chargers after Bill's death. Funny meme anyways
---
No
---
Doctor tracking is not good, they scream once and that’s it. Plague’s tracking relies on them cleansing, or addons. Legion is a stupid killer. Hag maybe you got me beat on that, but I stand by my point.
---
Not saying boil over is good, but the first EVER time I used it it actually saved my ass. I was doing an upstairs totem on Haddonfield, got trapped in the room by Bubba (he had TOTH so he knew where I was), picked me up and got bodyblocked by a random Claudette who locked him in the room with me. Now when he tried to carry me downstairs, he got stuck on the rail of the stairs because of boil over for so long that I managed to wiggle free by the time we left the house. He DC'd shortly after and I laughed for a solid five minutes.
---
&gt;Yea... What? Before the dedicated servers the hitboxes where just as Bad. I mean it got a little bit better because you and the killer are on the same Page but now they need to fix hitboxes. I mean... Did you ever inspect the hitboxes in Unreal engine?!
---
Hitboxes were rarely a problem on P2P. The main issues were related to Huntress but people ignorantly went around complaining about stuff that was purely caused by Ping. 
---
A while ago the devs showed us how hitboxes look like on DBD. So yeah, I know how they are even though I never inspected.
---
To each their own but I like having additional objectives. Challenges are fun and give me more reason to play the game. You dont even have to pay for it and they give you blood points for doing them, so I don't understand why you're so upset about it.
---
Is this the start of a hentai
---
it takes her 3 seconds to lift a pallet. Adding the weight of legion i think would be too much weight. Gameplaywise just mindgame as if youre gonna go around then vault
---
Excuse me sir, are you disrespecting the pebble?
---
The dodging does happen a lot when you have brown rank with you.
---
I'm not to worried for the megs/claudettes dodging.
---
With some fava beans and a nice Chianti.
---
How *dare* you
---
Close the chat and stop relying on others for what fun is
---
Because we're not all bitter weirdos who take a casual game seriously?
---
It's very solid. I ran it in the PTB
---
Docs often leave it up because they can trap people in the shack. In any other case you're right
---
Country white girl &gt; badass Japanese biker chick

Fixed it for you

Nemesis might be a Wraith buff. PWYF on tap.
---
Wouldn’t He have to start the game in a chase that he lost?
---
I thought they fixed that a long long time ago
---
That’s the point. You’re being bullied for being annoying!
---
He is gunna be nerfed
---
Yeah this dlc is a no-brainer for me
---
Nah. Send that shit back to Square Enix games where it belongs.
---
Thank you for your kind words, as a pig main i am often depressed playing DBD
---
*equips Borrowed Time*
---
Pallets are pretty easy to predict is the problem and survivors will get a small game notification if they're looking at one. His dream snares are best used in chase to easily shut down loops. That said if you use the right perks then survivors will never be able to do a gen in peace so pallets vs snares isn't always the game changer.
---
This!
---
No it doesn't. :)
---
I managed to get every teachable for every killer and survivor and fully max out 1 survivor and 1 killer within a few months time. This was way before all the new changes and long before they decided to let you get 2 perks at once in your bloodwebs. 
---
I have a total of 9 survivors at p3 level 50 with the perks I use the most in their loadout with the rest of the perks just trash perks. I have about 4 or 5 killers at p3 level 50 with the perks specifically set up that synergize with them and their power. 
---
Tldr: You literally don't need to have every single character in the entire game fully maxed out with everything in the game in order to play it. 
---
If you want every perk in the game without playing for it then go play kill your friends with the rest of the 6 year olds. The devs shouldn't just hand them all over to you because you cry about it.
---
This one gets it.
---
It's not shocking, it's a fact that everyone predicted her model was a copy of between these two.
---
Or obvious resemblance.
---
I still love Feng, but I used to love her too.
---
I dont wanta nerf I just want an audible cue before he smashes and during he dashes
---
It dosn’t but i found it funny😂
---
But if legion stabs a secound time and start a chase there is no way you won't bleed out, right?
---
This is basically you saying "I want to play in a position where a broken feature gives me an advantage over other players"
---
He may not be her father, but he is her daddy fo sure.
---
People always cry OP when they see something new. Remember when Left Behind got reworked? Lots of whining saying it's OP and will be the new meta. Demogorgon was released? OP. Freddy now makes people oblivious in the dream world? OP. Rather than wait for the dlc to release and see how it all works out in actual matches.
---
Look at those cute lashes
---
Yep that's her.
---
Why are only the nails of The Spirit, Feng, and Yui done??? Behavior explain!!!
---
They have said many times that getting 2 kills is what is considered fair when it comes to the killers being balanced. I play at red ranks and you most definitely can get a 4K as a “low tier” killer if you are decent at playing killer. Clown may need some buffs but he definitely isn’t garbage if you can land your bottles.
---

 Roar of Rage: It fills you when rage when your prey fight back.
---
Gain a 5/7/10 percent speed boost for 3/4/5 seconds after the cooldown of being stunned/blinded.
---
Huh, neat.
---
Yaaaas I love it!
---
This perk will be really useful in green ranks where killers are more likely to leave pallets up.
---
God can you imagine the killer shack bullshit that would be possible if the killer couldn't kick pallets that are being raised
---
Hope not
---
The one time I disregarded that, it was Devour Hope. If it glows, it ALWAYS goes.
---
Kinda, but IMO it´s like the Nurse ability. Pretty terrible when you cannot control it yet, but really damn strong once you get used to it.
---
To be honest, that's not so bad. After 2-3 months break, I joined the game and my first killer game was against three 6-7 ranks and one 18 rank, while I was rank 20. So uh, matchmaking system is pretty epic.
---
Survivor mains don’t like the idea of a good killer
---
I'm guessing you're using speech to text but I played a few rounds versus Cahla on Oni in Lery's, and I can confirm the big boi definitely isn't hindered by the layout in the slightest.
---
In turn, killer mains are already crying that putting pallets back with a long ass cooldown is OP. People love to cry wolf when they see new things in DbD
---
They were going for the bm...
---
And the perk is probably gonna get nerfed to shit and we Legion mains are gonna go back to our misery ;(
---
It cant be an exploit if its the perks fault.
---
Cannibal xD

---
Yeah with bloodhound it's usefull. On some maps too. Grass maps ? Note so much.
---
So?
---
He looks like the oni making a questionable pig cosplay
---
Yuuuup that’s why I am asking haha but he probably can I guess, but you could probably drop it on him 2 times in a row I don’t know how much time the killer is stun by the pallet if it’s more than 3sec then some people will get mad
---
Thank you for the laugh.  It was appreciated.
---
Signed,
---
Killer Main.
---
Quiet is not the word I would use for Oni. He's probably the loudest killer in the game, definitely gives you that same vibe of the Demogorgon roaring and stomping around the map.
---
Dont make memes of him getting nerfed. Cause BHVR dont like jokes and make them serious updates.
---
500 games to reach rank 1.... is... a bit much.
---
I just took every trap in the map and set them up in the killer shack. Once they finished all the gens they just came over and I nodded at them and they all started walking into my traps. You’ll get it easily doing this if you aren’t at rank 20.
---
Rreeeally, now.  I wasn't aware that Small game triggered on dream pallets.  That's a bit saddening.  
---
As you said though, even in situations where survivors are getting rid of them for their team, I can still squeak by fairly well simply by pressuring gens with pop goes the weasel and the like, and I tend to play more for the purposes of being sneaky or spooky and applying pressure rather that looking for 4ks or high ranks anyway.
---
I'm not likely to stop running pallets, though I might mix it up a bit with snares from time to time though - see if I can find creative places to surprise survivors with.
---
Eh, I don't know how people don't see this nerf was warranted. Yes, Haddonfield was the worst offender (and does need a rework), but it's not even close to the only map where BL was super strong on. There's a reason why the meme name Unbalanced Landing exists. There's a reason why Dead Hard + BL in the same build was a relatively common build before dedicated servers (which made Dead Hard a lot worse). The stagger passive was just too strong, and turned too many good, highly visible loops (buildings) into "I can't chase a survivor there". Especially when combined with map offerings.
---
Found the guy's alt!
---
its an addon for it. if it was base kit id agree but with an addon i think its fine
---
We ride together 
---
We get hooked in the basement and die together
---
Early game stalls and tracking like Corrupt Intervention and Whispers or maybe Discordance to find survivors ASAP might be the key to him. He doesn´t really need much power from perks when he gets rolling, maybe BBQ or Infectious Fright to snowball, but otherwise his perks should focus on early game.
---
Yeah, he just smashes through pallets with barely any downtime, it's pretty terrifying TBH. You can't even loop him unless it's hard 90 degree angles, he runs perfect circles around stuff like Macmillan rock loops.
---
They can get fucked for nerfing him. They get to fix a new issue with legion now so fuck you bhvr.
---
Cause he's getting penetrated ;)
---
Nea calling in her employees for a meeting

I think there were a couple others, like one set for meg, billy and someone else
---
A witch. Hansel and gretal style. 
---
Maybe instead of the entity she puts them on hooks that lower the survivor into a cauldron or something
---
Why am i seeing Haydee mixed in with dbd and the meme(?) Makes no fucking sense or isnt revelant to fucking anything?
---
Pretty much,playing survivor seems much harder.
---
Yes and by standing still, you're getting into the survivor's head, making them question "Oh shit is she phasing or just standing there? Should I vault, or run, or crouch away?", ergo mindgame.
---
Fucking same dude
---
Why not both?
---
What? Billy OP nerf Billy Billy No.2 after nurse was *the* thing before suddenly everyone focused on spirit.
---
Awesome meme
---
Because its an S-Tier perk obviously
---
For real tho, perks that are in the shrine for a first time cost 2700
---
You cant really counter onis ability other than getting healed.
---
Billy is still better Vs good surv Oni seems like a noob basher
---
Even though this is too late with the nerf...this is HEROIC information lol.
---
Billy: I am the perfect balance of lethality and mobility.
---
Oni: Hold my sake.
---
When Feng dies on hook, her body is being pulled towards the sky by the entity. 
---
Thus Feng doesn't die, she rises up.
---
The main nerf he’s getting is that frenzy hits don’t count towards m1 specific perks, while it may nerf STBFL on him it buffs Play with your food. He also got vault speed buffs so he’s honestly better than he was before.
---
I'm not saying it's the perk's fault, I'm just telling you how it is. Behaviour are not really good at balancing and development (for the most part) so this is the path most logical for them. Instead of putting time, money, and effort into correctly balancing busted maps, it is more efficient to just say "Fuck it" and nerf the perk directly and let the community cry out for a few days.
---
it's not just about pipping, it's about having health games as solo survivors.
---
Kate needs to be at the bottom
---
:angry: leave my cute boi otz alone.
---
I play both, but more survivor bcs its more fun with friends. And yes games can be shitty but I think past months has seen huge improvement in survivor behavior. I dont see toxicity that often anymore. Everyone just plays their best, tries to survive or kill and thats it.
---
To be fair, the current Legion should just be scrapped and reworked 'cause they've been a failure since the start. Even if they address Nemesis, I believe Beast of Prey is getting buffed to the undetectable status so on top of no red stain, you will get no terror radius thus beginning this cycle again.
---
It's not a mindgame if the spirit wins no matter what happens,there's literally 2 reasons if a spirit can't catch you,either the player is bad or there's another pallet nearby
---
It’s still silly that she can lose it over a pallet. Like the person above me said, you don’t even know if you’re going to have access to it half the time. I would be okay with it taking a portion of everyone’s power away, but I think it’s dumb that it applies to some and not others.
---
I don't know maybe I wasn't first to be hooked?
---
That's the issue though. Haddonfield was released before BL so it gets a pass, but Hawkin's Lab, the NEWEST MAP seems to be designed entirely around BL. There's so many loops that are only really viable if you have that one perk. Same with The Game. The nerf is justified, yes, but I hope BHVR will finally stop making so many vertical maps now.
---
they should have remove the speed boost and exhaustive effect and make it a perk that always decrease falling stagger duration and noise.
---
For information that's how BL was for a long time before it got a buff.
---
Slugging IS not toxic by itself. But letting them bleedout juste for the sake of it, is.
---
It would have cost you 0 dollars and 0 cents to not post this. And yet you did.
---
So something like Sloppy and Nurses is good for him?
---
Staying on edgy of the map doing nothing. Not doing generators when someone is in chase. Not going for unhook when others can't. Going down 10 sec in chase. Wasting pallets. Etc.
---
Can't even play cool looking survs because killer will assume you're toxic and tunnel your ass. And you can't even blame them because of their past experiences
---
I feel that the fact Billy has practically zero cooldown on his one shot, which can also be used to pressure the entire map at once is a little overloaded.
---
Im also of the opinion that even a baby Billy is able to find you by relentlessly spamming their chainsaw, then just run you down with their 115% movement speed.
---
The general consensus about Billy is "LUL just loop him 4Head". Of course im trying to loop him. What do i do when he comes out of nowhere at mach 5 speed and theres legitimately no loops anywhere? Sure, there may be no loops nearby versus other killers, but they generally dont one shot me.
---
The analogy i like to use to describe current billy is;
---
If you give a blind man (a bad billy player) a hammer (one shot chainsaw on no cooldown) and a nail (survivor), the blind man can swing wildly and miss all he wants, but he WILL eventually hit the nail.
---
For me, there seems to be no downside for liberally using your power in bad situations. Take the Spirit for example, a killer that controversially splits opinion throughout the community. Regardless if you think she is overpowered or not, her power has a cooldown. Imagine she could spam that power at will AND have 115% movement speed?
---
For me, personally, i would prefer the chainsaw sprint to have a cooldown, or for billys base movement speed top be reduced from 115%. Again, this is my opinion, but i feel he has too much in his kit.
---
Why is that? I must have missed it.
---
Unless you have a perk (like legions perk that alerts you to hiding in lockers) the only way i know of would be if they fast vaulted into a locker, if they slow vault into it then it shouldn’t notify you
---
Doctor can see the auras of fake doctors and/or pallets that survivors see if you're using certain add ons and if not, he can just shock areas that you think survivors might be. Plague can follow blood pools or cleansed fountains, both work. Legion being stupid doesn't mean that's wrong.
---
I have 1500 hours on survivor alone. I think Oni is sick as a killer. I also think most things were fine in the game before they got nerfed, so does everyone I play with. I think it's in your head.
---
1v1 me on Haddonfield, Scrub. No instadowns.
---
Did you even saw the first movie?
---
It's funny. I was using Wraith earlier with Coxcomb Clapper and Soot - Ghost, and it made me realize that Wraith has like the only viable brown add I'm in the game
---
More like 0.2 seconds but ok
---
Love the Weeping Angels reference
---
You can run at them and hit M1 for an instant attack
---
I get the same hits with 30 ping as I got them with 150 ping, and I’m not the only one. So I don’t think ping is the main problem
---
That a great but...some of us have jobs and families. Crazy, right?
---
She doesn't fight him in the vein she does in the 2018 movie, is the point I was making.
---
I imagine him with a meta like ruin, sloppy as a must. And the other two can be something between bbq, whispers, pop goes the weasel, discordance, monitor and abuse, infectious fright.
---
this family is so fucked up
---
Were you rank 16 before? If so than this is the maximum ranks you can get
---
I absolutely love this.
---
Mori should make the survivors head cave in ... such a waste of possibilities
---
It fits thr gimmick of being a ghost lol
---
Yes of course its an S-Tier perk obviously yeah sure why not
---
Hey, at least he has the one thing he really wants: an enemy he can fight.
---
Sorry I'm on console so I don't have access to the ptb. So it works as normal *and* when someone else gets hooked?
---
These are great, no lie. Usually when people post these things they're absurd but I really like this.
---
Ranks 16-20 can rank with anyone
---
I do like the idea of Legion being able to switch on the fly and each member specialising in a certain area based on their personality. Something like this:
---
Frank: Aggressive Leader, base M1 Killer
---
Joey: Easily Impressed Athlete, has feral frenzy/faster base movement speed
---
Susie: Shy Stalker, less terror radius/undetectable
---
Julie: Lovestruck Girlfriend, I honestly haven't thought of anything for Julie
---
I feel Legion should be able to swap masks and become the other characters after like a 2-3 second channel and that way they'd be the perfect situational killer. You'd either start the match as Frank and swap through on a cycle or based on the cosmetics you equip at the beginning start as one of the others.
---
Hitboxes haven't been touched. ~~The only difference now is how we connect to a match. ~~ They’re same shit as before
---
I think those cosmetics are gonna be in the store
---
Yep. If you want to optimise the use of his power, you'd better slug, 'cause picking up a down survivor reset your power.
---
That said, it's not very long to get it back with the right addons.
---
Yes! Imagine what they'd make from selling Nea's sweater alone!
---
&gt;I get the same hits with 30 ping as I got them with 150 ping, and I’m not the only one. So I don’t think ping is the main problem
---
Considering hitboxes haven't changed in a long time, ping is the only problem. Doesn't matter the value, the problem is how dedicated servers are / were coded and devs have been improving them with every iteration.
---
Most likely a glitch. It’s Behavior after all.
---
The fuck?
---
He definitly fast vaulted for sure bc I don't have legion perks unlocked for anyone else. But there's no certain distance you have to be to see the notificarion right?
---
When a survivor gets in a locker, they have 2 ways of doing it.
---
Slowly going into a locker has no notification.
---
Quickly entering the locker will give you a loud sound notification unless the survivor is using a perk called Quick &amp; Quiet. You will get this notification from anywhere around the map.
---
The notification of a survivor quickly entering a locker has the same apperance and sound of someone failing a skill check or doing a fast action at a distance.
---
The only perks that exist that can tell a killer if a survivor is in a locker is Infectious Freight which will cause a survivor to scream in the locker or Iron Maiden which will make the survivor scream if they exit out of the locker.
---
I once cleansed HG at the start of the game in the Gideon bathroom while two teammates were on the gen next to me. They stopped repairing and banished me from the realm. All I could do was crouch in the corner and say "sorry guys, yoi know how it is..."
---
Its the start of a yaoi parody but shh, its such a great artstyle lets not waste it
---
When he came up behind the couch or when she hide in the closet, for excample?
---
Yep. And it’s boring as hell for the survivor.
---
Wonder when that was. So far I haven't seen the actors interact/talked or anything about DbD.
---
Yes let’s pretend Nurse, Billy, Huntress and Demogorgon don’t exist.
---
Ive read that they didnt mean no more events period they meant no more elaborate events. So like no more secondary objectives but have a offering that makes decorated gens and hooks appear similar to the halloween event we just had or the anniversary event. Obviously idk this 100% bc im not a dev but we will probably get something like Christmas light decorated gens and hooks and something like double bp but nothing really past that.
---
Hitboxes haven't been touched. 
---
~~The only difference now is how we connect to a match~~ 
---
They’re same shit as before
---
This. This I like.
---
He seems too strong at the moment, but I’m looking forward to the scare factor of running away and then seeing this mountain of a man fuckin ZOOM
---
Sadly when Surge activates on gens around the killer, it will regress them by 18% and leave them to regress. 
---
As a result you cannot kick the gens that are regressing unless a survivor taps the gen to activate it again. 
---
However, you can still save the Pop kick and find a gen that was not hit by Surge.
---
Would you like a second opinion? YOU ARE ALSO UGLY!
---
If a survivor stays in one spot for too long, crows will begin to gather around them. If this survivor sat in that locker for... I believe it's something like 30 straight seconds? might be longer. If they stay there for too long then crows will begin to show their location. First one crow, then two crows, then 3 crows. One crow is really just a warning, but it makes you easier to see. 2 crows will start making audible crow noises, and 3 crows make *visible* crow noises which might be what you saw.
---
Honestly just hive em a dunce hat.
---
The only thing I hate is when people vault and tea bag because OK?
---
And breaking my hooks. Like once a whole side of the map I had no hooks and couldn't hook anyone. Was bs.
---
I didn't know that about Infectious Freight. But thanks. I knew this guy was just being salty but I needed to know about the notifications cause i was honestly curious.
---
Nope, fast vault swill alert killer regardless of distance. Unless the survivor is using quick and quiet then they can fast vault every 20 seconds and the killer will never know
---
I've basically conceded to the fact the devs have forgotten Adam exists, he has so few options. Even Jane has more options already.
---
Because of Nemesis Old Legion is back
---
Why everyone is hot in picture.
---
Maybe :) Tho she would probably blame him for the death of her mother and herself as it was his cursed mask would controled her father.
---
Yeah no sympathy here. I just started playing again about a week or two ago so I totally missed Ghostface launch, and I still haven't bought him. But goddamn every person who plays him I've run into is just mega scummy, I havent been in a game with one yet who didn't try and camp hooks in Night Shroud and stalk off the unhooking survivor. At least Spirit players actually try and put out map pressure.
---
Fun fact he actually has a way to tell if he has it, it's hard to notice though. His left hand will be different in tier three if he has it. It has something to do with it being a fist or relaxed hand, can't remember which though. Also tombstone will usually get a maximum of two people so, just hide in a locker if he has tombstone and you can tell, it forces him to grab you and put you on a hook.
---
Killer looks great, survivor also looks great.
---
Survivor perks is good I guess , need more time to tell tho.
---
Killer power is abit disappointing tho, I too close to hillbilly, but I like the "drawing blood thing".
---
It only regresses them by 8%, where did you get 18%?
---
Haven’t heard oni in person yet because I play PS4, but god DAMN demogorgon is fucking spooky, especially as a fan of stranger things
---
The loud Thud thud thud of it’s footsteps, it’s little passive noises, it’s screech when hitting a survivor, it’s all magically scary
---
A+ BHVR
---
Yeah. I disagree that they entered penalties for dcing instead of addressing why people do it. You can’t force people to stay in a game they’re not enjoying.
---
Best thing I can do for you right now is this Monto video where you can see inside :https://youtu.be/v4MhTS56Pxg?t=708
---
So you don't think we'll get an event like we just had withering blight? I don't either tbh.
---
&gt;Hitboxes haven't been touched. The only difference now is how we connect to a match They’re same shit as before
---
Apart from versing a Huntress or Billy I don't think they were shit but then again, I am not an ignorant sheep that goes around complaining about the wrong issue.
---
The Oni is fucking ripped though, he’s not chonky
---
He’s much more comparable to Myers, trapper, maybe even billy
---
Clown is still the only thicc boy sadly
---
Wait are you calling me the survivor main or referring to yourself in the third person? Cause I play like 80% of killer, pretty much only do survivor when I'm half-conscious or going for challenges.
---
Looks loke the intro of a soap opera
---
Because with the last Halloween event you didn’t have to do the challenges to get the skins
---
Way to be a bro and point it out, I was waiting to purchase the skin due to this bug
---
Big thanks
---
Thanks bruv, figured
---
Clown doctor wraith legion and leather face all need buffs. They cant reliably get kills without survivors being bad. Everyone else I'm fine with.
---
Can somebody send me a link of the patchnotes? I can’t find it anywhere.
---
"crutch?"
---
&gt;this type of event with simple offerings for more BP and cheaper bloodwebs than what we got with Hallowed Blight last year
---
Last year we had a proper event that brought in a new mechanic, bits of lore, and a very 'pleasant' aesthetic for the halloween season. This year we had asset store pumpkins lazily placed on generators that you can do and that's it. Sound fix sure is nice, but after waiting for so long I really don't think that you should sing hymns of thankfulness for it. Plus a great amount of age-old bugs still go unfixed to this day, with no communication from the devs.
---
Also, having to be extra grateful for a 'fix' ( ' is there because it's still not a complete fix) kinda shows how sloppy and fucky the devs are - and as long as people dish out money for dumb cosmetics they will keep doing this shit.
---
They don’t need to respect you. No hate,just saying. Try to lighten up, I know for some people it could be annoying but just understand it’s not that serious.
---
It's definitely a lil odd but not impossible in the slightest.
---
Dude, you can’t force people to stay in a video game if they’re not having fun. You better believe I’m going to one hook myself if I’m in a bullshit game.
---
Not even mentioned the bug for “Medic” and “Handyman” achivement i see...
---
he cant fight without a weapon
---
Dev is gone
---
Read my flair and learn, child. Soon you shall be enlightened too.
---
You're right it is a hillbilly myers
---
people are  down voting you but I don’t conform to opinions that make me look good so I’ll say what I gotta say. You’re right. People really get so salty they feel the need to come on here and complain about teabagging for christ sake 😂 Don’t think half these kids have played halo. ITS BEEN AROUND. Move on
---
Is that what his bloody cosmetics look like?
---
Yestarday I, a rank 17 killer went against a full group of rank 6 - 7s. I dont think were SWF but my god that sucked. They were nice about it in the post game chat though.
---
&gt;People are getting way too worked up in this game like the entity is consuming their souls.
---
The irony of not being able to take your own advice is palpable. 
---
It's a game dude. Get over it. If your ego is so fragile just quit the second the end of match screen comes up.
---
&gt;It's not a mindgame if the spirit wins no matter what happens and the survivor has no input
---
So if you were to crouch away and the case ended up being that she was phasing, and she suddenly appears at the pallet, facing away from you, and smacks it thinking you'd be there, you're telling me that the spirit has won the interaction, and the survivor choosing to crouch away had zero impact on the end result of her phasing into a pallet? Either way, it's definitely a mindgame to make a survivor question your actions and then react based on what they think.
---
You and me both. Oh you want Lithe? Here, have Deva-Vu lol
---
Survivor perks are decent but will probably be thrown out a window and beaten with a stick for adrenaline, dead hard, decisive, etc
---
Killer perks are actually pretty good.
---
Level 30 perk is hot garbage
---
Level 35 perk prevents sprint burst plays witch is nice
---
Level 40 perk breaks Legion and makes him worse to deal with than before the rework.
---
Luigi
---
its a good matchmaking
---
usualy the difference is 10+ranks lol
---
Well, his downside is that you can hide. Hide and pray he doesn't use contagious fear. Jokes aside, on live he is very likely to lose his power when stunned and this will be his counterplay. 
---
He is also quiet loopable, a bit harder than billy, but it is possible.
---
what, opposed to every other step over animation..?
---
Because it's a placeholder voice for the PTB, it says so in the patch note. She'll have her own voice when the chapter releases.
---
Survivor perks are quite nice. 
---
Lucky Break: Preventing bleeding for 3 minutes seems very niche and almost worthless in my opinion. I suppose it helps immersive play if a survivor also equips Iron will but that fact that it only last for 3 minutes and is then deactivated makes it kind of a dud.
---
Any means Necessary: The ability to conserve pallets will make unsafe loops more usable as it means the killer can no longer leave unsafe pallets unbroken as survivors can reuse them. Other than that though I doubt it will be meta since the strongest pallets tend to be broken by killers.
---
Breakout: This body blocking perk looks decent. Think it will be devastating in SWF groups and perhaps see some use in Solo play. 
---
Killer Perks
---
Blood Echo: Perk seems useless unless you are playing with a killer like the Legion or the Plague. Hemorrhage is a joke of a status effect. Exhaustion is alright, especially if the killer has BBQ and can reach a survivor before exhaustion runs out but I doubt it will see much use at higher ranks.
---
Zanshin Techniques: Seems quite decent as it allows the killer to understand and predict where a survivor will run to. Might see some use for killers like the Spirit or Nurse. Probably going to be seen alot in lower ranks for new killers wanting to understand map tiles. Possible synergy with Im all ears that could be useful.
---
Nemesis: Seems like an incredibly fun perk to use but abit pointless other than its ability to change obsession. Survivors having the oblivious status effect is useful but not when you are in chase which is when this perk will really only activate. I see some great synergy though with Furtive chase + Make your choice or Nemesis + Play with Your food. 
---
Oni himself looks pretty fun to play. A mix of Myers &amp; Hillbilly. He has a great aesthetic and nice unique chase music. Think he might be a slightly weaker Hillbilly when it comes to power.
---
A "soft infinite" still isn't an infinite. Being able to loop something a little bit is fine, the problem lies when it is almost impossible for the killer to get to the survivor, which is a true infinite. Old BL was enabling true infinites, thus it was a problem and needed to go.
---
Nice, so they'll just run at the killer and suicide on hook and I'll miss out on the bloodpoints I would have gotten if they just left. This is supposed to fix anything, or just make the 3v1 FEEL like it's a 4v1?
---
Because this really doesn't do anything but punish everyone else for playing since they don't get any points anymore.
---
It's just the lighting, look at the jacket in both
---
Just to say but kindred is an anti camping perk, yes ?
---
So as Beast of prey only works when in a chase and when bloodlust kicks in so not while camping.
---
Tinkerer when a gen is 80% completed (so usefull while camping)
---
Dark devotion is useless when camping because you must be hitting your obsession.
---
I think the pallet one for the survivor is pretty OP 
---
And about legion, he is overpowered with that nemesis one
---
They expanded on the lore this year with the Alchemist stuff in the Archives. We found out more about the nectar and it's powers as well as the Void being the dumping grounds of the Fog. All kinds of cool stuff. They just kept it out of the actual games which was weird so I'll give you that.
---
Maybe they wanted to just go back to being traditional, maybe they were lazy, but the gameplay didn't suffer as a result.
---
We've gotten what, 4 new killers and survivors this year? Calling them lazy because they need to pump out new content to sustain the game is easy to do, but they're doing a way better job than so many bigger game studios (cough Bethesda cough Blizzard) at keeping a good balance between free updates, fixes and cosmetics.
---
whooooosh
---
Not really, at most I think we will get a themed rift like we have rn where you collect a currency you can spend on certain store cosmetics
---
Most of the time it's a better move to just break a pallet so I don't see it as a huge issue.
---
And this is the retribution my boy gets for losing his STBL synergy.
---
Weeby
---
It seems like the darkening with it just makes the dark parts of the base trap larger.
---
 And the green add-on makes the entire trap the dark part
---
i had similar problems until I upgraded to the ps4 from the original. 100x better.
---
Used to main Wraith when I was new to the game, I hated it so much that I quit the game for months. Then I tried Billy, then I tried Hag, then I fell in love with DBD.
---
Well, maybe not love, maybe more an abusive relationship.
---
"This guy is hacking, he was just on the other side of the map!"
---
Pretty sure he could beat the shit out of legion with just a flashlight, then use their knife against them
---
It adds an additional 8% to the normal 10% regression of a gen explosion.
---
that white mode is a choice
---
Why do you think he is weak? Just because of the first hit/down? Finding the first survivor is not hard, you can even run stuff like Stridor to counter Iron Will at high ranks, you can find the first survivors pretty easily. You don´t have to use your power on the first person, you can collect the blood and activate it after you hook him. Have BBQ to tell you where they are, dash across the map and snowball from there, once your power runs out you can collect more blood from the unhooked person (you can even track their movement with it since it lasts longer than scratch marks) and snowball again.
---
I really don´t think he will be weak.
---
Imagine how iconic that’d be to hear « It’s Britney bitch » right before the chase begins.
---
That's perfect
---
Ur a killer Harry
---
Looks like he belongs in lord of the rings
---
Or they couldve been doing the “sacrifice a survivor to the EGC” achievement for the archives.
---
“the game is killer sided”hahahahhaa you hear that everyone 😂I play both sides at rank 1(devotion 11) and after hours of playtime,I can confidently say the game is definitely survivor sided. New players or survivor mains tend to think the game is killer sided when in reality you could 1v1 a killer if you’re good enough. Gotta learn how to be a solid distraction and be able to maneuver successfully even in solo que.
---
Oh... So what I was thinking was about to happen is about to happen in a much more literal sense then..
---
Periodt.
---
This has been confirmed by Peanits to be false in the last AMA. Surge only regresses by 8%.
---
Name 3 op survivor perks that havent been nerfed.
---
Meh, two gamers is a terrible idea. Next thing you know you’re both fat and virtually fucking each other’s avatars instead of eachother irl.
---
dang, I really like this guy &lt;3 Otz, if you are reading this - you are a wholesome human being and I am sending you tons of love &lt;3
---
Why have shirtless Myers when we can have Anime Myers
---
Imagine getting sacrificed 100 times as each survivor unlocks "Sacrificed Cosmetics" where it basically zombifies them
---
I like that you say default bc Stockholm Nothern Lights Nea can do no wrong
---
He's basically Michael level IMO.
---
Probably upper mid tier or lowest top tier.
---
Biker Meg? There's only so much money I can spend on this game, bhvr please. 
---
Also now we have a full biker squad: Jeff, Kate, Yui and Meg. Sweet.
---
Your joking really? 
---
I thought with the wording similar to Overcharge it would have had a similar effect.
---
Thanks For confirming that.
---
why are you flexing a kill your friends game..lmao
---
Fenson Deng, Fate Minson, Kang Din...
---
I had this happen to me earlier, however I was playing Nea. I couldn't fit as Nea. It then happened to my friend who was playing claudette. So it's not an Oni size, we just got BHVR'd again
---
Lucky Break deactivates and preserves charges once you heal up. So if you get injured, it activates, you heal up after 20 seconds and the rest of the charges (160 seconds) are ready until you get injured again.
---
Are you implying that it *is* fun to let the opinions of strangers effect someone's emotions/state of mind?
---
Although I imagine lucky break gives you the chance to heal in that three minute, so it doesn't become completely dud.
---
I mean your brown ranks. That's as good as your going to get
---
The thing is no good spirit starts phasing immediately.They will wait for a few seconds to see what you're doing,then phase to smack you.Since you don't know when she starts to phase you can't pretend to do something.
---
I like his power. Being able to hit multiple survivors in rapid succession is fun as hell. They definitely need to give him some healthy buffs though that make it enjoyable for both killers and survivors. Don’t see them giving him a whole new power. Freddy was...well a special case. He gave everyone a 7 second head start 😂
---
no you can just raise them when they're dropped, that one of the new survivors perks
---
Yeah, it was really dumb wording and many people thought it is 18% myself included. [Peanits confirmed it here though.](https://i.redd.it/ofgfardf3hz31.png) Really sucks considering how often it can just whiff by either not being close to a gen, grabbing someone from a locker, interrupting an action (unhooks, vaults) or using a non-basic attack, and the fact that it has a cooldown...
---
We need some uzumaki on survivor side
---
😍
---
Don't forget tunnelling all 4 survivors at once
---
they wanted to make players that actually play spirit finding the vault animation relatable
---
Well after learning this I can confirm I'm making sure to unequip the perk from any of my future load outs.
---
For Honor* and I agree. More bullshit for these weebs to jerk off too
---
You are definitely missing something, but on the other hand that's certainly one way of approaching Oni.
---
The Blorb mechanic messes with the high-end survivor meta in a significant manner - running around injured against Oni is a recipe for utter disaster.
---
someone in post game chat said it https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dyfivz/this_gave_me_the_biggest_giggle_i_wouldnt_give_up/
---
Oh wow I never realized Jake/Myers was such a popular thing to spawn this much good fanart.
---
He's also way too highly rewarded, especially at the start of the match, for not just GUESSING which direction he's coming from. You hide behind a wall and he's coming from the opposite way and has his training wheel add ons to turn faster than you can reposition. Real fun.
---
Yeah Plague shouldn't lose the power from getting stunned, but some powers like Legion's can be quite problamatic if you couldn't make them lose it
---
i wonder what are they saying in the voice chat!
---
I'm insulted as a Legion main.
---
But people shouldn't be down voting you because he definietly has a polarizing power.
---
Six hours of game yesterday. Both killer and survivor. Only two games without dc. And most of the time the dc was on first down or because they didn't like the map or the killer.
---
Once while killer because two swf were being toxics (clicking their lamp, sandbagging a claudette, teabagging, unhooking in front of me when I had just hooked the guy) and I was not letting them be.
---
It hurts the survivor and the killer both.
---
Whatever the cause (minus game craching obviously and I think it can be detected) it should be penalize.
---
bHVR: gg ez
---
Wait you can down people with demon dash?
---
g o o d b y e
---
I don't see how anyone could think he needs a nerf. Unlike Hillbilly's goofy ass he has to work for his map mobility and instant down (which is also time limited when achieved). Without his power he's just your typical 115% m1 killer with nothing to help in loops.
---
Demo has one, Rat Liver, which increases your movement during shred, which increases your distance when you do it because momentum matters. 
---
But yeah.
---
Didnt say he was bad but he has a worse version of Billy's power, since it needs to be built up.
---
But what killer is going to leave a god pallet/unmindgameable pallet unkicked? If you’re chasing someone and they throw down say Shack Pallet or one of the very strong pallets on The Game, who’s just turning away and going “eh I’ll come back later” 
---
Maybe Nurse, if she cares enough about pallets, but this perk is more of a low level gimmick. Killers who don’t understand what pallets to actually care about/respect will obviously be able to get punished for leaving good pallets up but any decent killer knows what pallets are worth breaking. 
---
Unsafe pallets could regenerate for all I care, because survivors who camp them or try to play them get downed.
---
I‘m a 50/50 guy
---
You probably already know, but for the benefit of everyone else here's the rest of the answer from Peanits - `Fortunately, whenever the game is on dedicated servers, the killer dodging the lobby does not boot everyone back to the main menu. Instead, you'll stay in the lobby and it'll search for a new killer (with that lobby being put at the front of the queue). You can see this in effect on PC right now where we're testing dedicated servers.`
---
So yeah, that'll be nice.
---
Is that marley?
---
Just ignore the endgame chat.
---
Ever since switching to Nintendo switch I have realised that the game is much much more enjoyable when I'm not getting death threats for accidently tunneling a Claudette that's wearing the same cosmetic as the rest of her team.
---
“infinite time in feral frenzy” lmaooooo 😂😂😂😂😂
---
With killer queue times you take what you can get
---
No thanks new chick's finger nails are too long for me
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/search/?q=shrine&amp;include_over_18=on&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=new
---
Yeah. No scratch marks or blood trails is feels like you are playing very, very differently.
---
Mettle of Man, Prove Thyself, Agitation, Beast of Prey
---
Agitation, Beast of Prey, Prove Thyself and Mettle of Man
---
Exactly there won't be one they've said no more events like there was no summer even, Glad you agree with me
---
No one was complaining about bl, you misunderstood, i didn't say that survivors complained about it, i said survivors complain more
---
It kinda bothers me no mither still causes blood orbs to spawn, it says right in the skills description your blood coagulates, and you leave no blood. Wtf is the oni collecting?!
---
Walk away in a non-straight line then, if she is phasing then she can't see you, and if she isn't phasing, you're getting some distance from her and she'll have to start moving
---
Hes a god damn menace, Oni isnt a lot, but its something.
---
No, I'm implying you're very over the top and probably take yourself way to seriously. That little speech of yours is just ridiculous.
---
Ahh cool cool. I play on Xbox so no dedicated servers here yet. Will help cut down on queues for sure.
---
Imagine hearing Herman Carter giggling in the distance, like you're not eve in his terror radius yet you hear *Hueyheyheyheyheyhey.*
---
It is in "Gather dust and never be played" in my list
---
Did u not do any objectives before you got chased, and how didnt u get chase points?
---
well that’s why he has the ability to see anybody next to him,through walls and all
---
So the middle aged dwight?
---
Will probably be patched quickly.
---
Happy cake day
---
Dude nemesis is gonna make legion broken again
---
They wont keep it. Survivors will complain its the same as pre rework legion moonwalk and it will get removed.
---
Free hug 🤗
---
I think it's 1.5 or 2 seconds. 3 seconds seems way to long
---
So they just changed the text but not the way the perk functions?
---
No one left behind and Kindred also have new text detailing the buffs.
---
I haven't played the new killer yet I doubt I will ever use his perks or if I would play him a lot but he looks fun almost like a different Billy u go fast and insta down someone's ass
---
Its so good it cant get any better
---
Seeing as it is a rage mode u would probably take on as many survivors as u can putting some map pressure out on the field like a T3 Myers if u can't find anyone u pick up the downed person and collect more blood
---
👹👹👹👹
---
Not hit boxes it's latancy my friend now go complain about latancy and don't be a dumb dumb
---
What are you even talking about lol.
---
Yeah, it seems that you can’t deny his power completely like you can with the plague, he recharges it very slowly, gets half the meter from hitting healthy survivors and can pick up the blood orbs, he’s going to get his power at some point.
---
I’m gonna take and wild guess and assume they had already worked on the perks before releasing the patch for Switch players (which you got some time after the others) which might be the reason why the descriptions changed? I don’t think other platforms have this.
---
U can mute end game chat and pretty sure for console u can disable randos sending u messages if u don't like the toxicness then stop living around it just like there is a block button for a reason
---
There's no way this is intended. BHVR can do many strange decisions with balancing this game but no way they'd choose to bring back the old legion.
---
On one hand it is pretty fucking strong if you use it exactly that way.
---
On the other hand, if you simply don´t stun Legion you cannot activate it. Pre-throwing pallets or simply using different loops with vault completely ignore the perk. 
---
Personally I think they might remove it, but we need to see more people play with/against it on the PTB.
---
This gave me pyrovision vibes
---
Would be a nice joke on april fools indeed
---
I feel like some people will run Vigil just to deal with Blood Echo. It seems like it will be very annoying to deal with.

&gt;Oh assumptions and insults already, are we?
---
This isn't even a proper sentence, and where did I insult you? 
---
&gt;But it's ok, you're probably young and clueless.
---
So, what was that about making assumptions?
---
My dude you gave a ludicrous speech about loving toxicity, it's just pathetic. And you assuming I'm young and clueless is just the cherry. No matter how old you may be, you've got a fair bit of growing to do yet.
---
&gt; Securing a kill is not the goal of the game.
---
It is. It's a KILLER's job to KILL people. Even catching a survivor who does not loop can take up to 90 seconds, in that time 3 gens will be powered. People who abuse every single loop for at least 3-4 circles will keep killer busy for several minutes. That's enough to repair all the gens. So, unless you have noed active, letting people unhook someone will guarantee them making up to the gates. Also there is a perks like Insidious that's made especially to pretend that you leave the area and then down a survivor who will attempt the resque. So no, securing the kill is a goal of the game and there is ORIGINAL game mechanics that supporting it, when everything that supports\combats looping were added later, because looping was never an intended mechanics. 
---
It seems like you are just one of that people who's skill low enough to hide for a minute, that's why you have to use loops to stay alive.
---
Yeah I am not a fan of Beast of Prey. It just takes so long to activate and can be countered by good loops where you lose line of sight or have a good pallet. 
---
I honestly would like them to change it, because I would hate the viability of Legion to depend on one cheesy interaction, but at this point I don´t know how to do it without completely changing Nemesis or Legion himself (and I hate the changes he got in PTB)
---
It should, they have a handful of perks that straight up interact with 1 specific killer power. Sabatour for Trapper, Adrenaline for Freddy. I feel as if Poised, Babysitter, No Mither maybe even the new survivor perk should have that effect.
---
Hold the phone.
---
Ugh yea \\\[T]/
---
Im already working on it, that sounds amazing.
---
Imagine getting murdered by only your dad lol what a fucking pussy
---
BoP takes way too long to activate. If Legion chases you long enough to get the hit, proc BOP, wait out the timer, hook, that's 3 gens done right there easily. Legion lives on keeping up the pressure and by doing what you suggest you are giving up literally all the pressure you could have and just lose.
---
Bubba is still the number 1 facecamper though. Whenever I see a Bubba, I expect Insidious, Noed and Agitation. And sadly about 50% of the Bubbas I meet are that kind of player.
---
What? No. It's not "Bad Manners" if the literal developers of the game support it. It is poor sportsmanship to claim it is though.
---
They weren't just within their right to try for that. They are outright encouragemed by the games objective system itself to close the hatch before before hooking that person.
---
It's called a late game hook and they're given extra points for it.
---
Oo MoM
---
&gt; tbags
---
&gt; Complains about disconnecting. 
---
Are you clueless? Maybe don't be toxic, you got exactly what you deserved.
---
I actually spent quite a while finding the original artist but their japanese name isnt it making easier for me tbh
---
At least stop giving us nerfs and maybe work on buffing them instead on making them depend on a perk
---
I think they would argue a bit over the fact that Spirits sword is shattered
---
Good fanart indeed! But sadly a lot wasted talent aswell if you get what I mean. Many artist take it too far
---
Didn‘t you see that the meg teabagged him on a whole new level?
---
Anime Myers best Myers
---
It's a killer job to try and kill the FOUR survivors. Not just one of them.
---
Camping is a very bad way of doing it. You're basically letting 3 survivors get away with that strategy. It's an objective truth, maybe you should inform yourself, there are lots of good killers with good content to learn how to play killer out there.
---
It seems like you are just one of those people whose skill is low enough to get systematically looped and genrushed in this game. That's why you have to camp to secure one sorry kill and maybe that yellow rank safety pip.
---
Uhm he teabagged only because meg teabbaged him pretty hard...
---
That's also a possibility thanks. Either way they're trying to activate the late game and they could have been successful if they were turned around.
---
This looks like the Pig vaulting animation, might not be final.
---
Its not likely you'll down many people since he stops moving once he hits one person with his club. His pallet deletion also takes a full windup on his club and really takes just as much time as if you were to have broken it normally.
---
His map pressure is great but he doesn't always have it on hand, same as his insta-down. He has to spend a good portion of the early game as a killer without a power.
---
Youve got to admit that artstyle is pretty cool. Ive never seen such a great artstyle for Myers nor Jake
---
I get that with Bubba and Doctor all the time. I sometimes get a distance-camping Pig or Hag, but yeah. Bubba is the worst stereotype when it comes to camping.
---
Fair enough, let's just can the whole DLC because one person isn't pleased with a perk. OI BEHAVIOUR, CURSED LEGACY IS CANCELLED. WHY? BECAUSE YOU MADE YET ANOTHER POTENTIALLY POWERFUL PERK
---
rancor X nemesis allows me to rightfully punish pallet t-baggers so lick my nut. You're not happy, there's always that uninstall button
---
So? Kill the Meg, don't be toxic back. How is this concept so hard to grasp?

As a survivor you are supposed to force the killer to destroy a safe pallet by looping it and as a killer it only makes sense to get rid of safe pallets. That means only unsafe pallets will be left on the map. Imagine sacrificing ds, borrowed time, adrenaline or dead hard, so you can put an unsafe pallet up every 120 seconds. The cool down could be 30 seconds and it's still a meme perk.
---
Keep in mind: The only reason this worked is because Oni's power went off and stunned them, giving FJ enough time to actually reset it.
---
Nemesis is strong against 1 person, not that good.
---
Jeeez xD there you go. Instant toxic :D dude im both Rank 1 Killer and Survivor but I only play casualy with my friends. I just pointed out, why this comunity is so toxic and you are the prove
---
Well jeez, you must be fun at parties
---
And when they add 10 more characters with 3 perks each?
---
Potential????? M8 it's literally been showed that it makes legion into the old legion which I recall everyone wanting to get deleted and I never said throw the whole dlc away it's not like they could just rework a perk 
---
No need to be so defensive about it I'm just wondering a valid question
---
What does it do? Haven’t been keeping up.
---
Oni is amazing and I like the surv perks
---
People will quit over literally anything these days lmao
---
New map?
---
It’s absolute dog shit.
---
Legion is one of those they need to look at just bc it's fine for everyone else and broken good for one doesn't make it okay. I know they will nerf or change the perk but that's not what the OP post is about it just baffled me how after all these mistakes they continue to make such big ones and it's not even bugs
---
Lmao so survivors can tbag and laugh but when a GF tbags them thet DC? Pathetic lol
---
And u think that makes much sense in text form
---
My man looks like Drax
---
My logic is an eye for an eye. If you are toxic to me, ill be toxic back. Its only fair
---
I hear you if you say both sides can be toxic, its true for sure.
---
But i don't think I've ever had someone write nasty things on my profile when playing survivor, and if i do it's another survivor that is pissed about my performance in the game.  
---
However playing killer i get at least a page worth of -Reps every session.
---
We still got 2 weeks. It'll definitely change. And in my honest opinion legion just needs a completely different power. Maybe actually play around with the whole "we're a group of 4" aspect.
---
Lmao he was going to hook the meg, just after returning the favor. Dont dish it out if you cant take it 🙌
---
After u complete a challenge u have to collect ur reward manually
---
They don't test anything before release i don't know why you're surprised, they release maps that totally cock some killers knowing well the game has other killers just to match themes of chapters,
---
And yap the old legion is back guaranteed downs by just following you and doing nothing,
---
*oh no*
---
Ill find the bleach for my eyes hol' up
---
That's the thing though, it won't even let me select a challenge to complete.
---
3rd Dec I think was confirmed
---
Anyone tbagging deserves to have a shit game. There’s no need for it. 
---
If I see a survivor is t bagging I hope they get killed 
---
If It’s a killer and the survivor DC then that should be expected.
---
I'm always surprised they don't even have to test the perk to find out why it's broken the person who wrote OBLIVIOUS is the one that should have been thinking
---
Well who do we have here? An Elf in the Shelf!
---
"This is balanced and you should just git gud" 
---
-Every survivor main
---
Never heard the saying "an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind?"
---
Just asking u do know u can only select the unlocked challenges
---
It looks way too situational to be concerned about honestly. I mean you need two purples, and to be pallet stunned, not to mention it'll only work on one person at a time.
---
Don't dish it out. Don't be toxic. It's really that simple. Just be a good fucking person my god.
---
What's wrong with that? I'm confused
---
I don’t really consider 9th grade being HS, they are too child
---
If you’re talking to me I don’t know where you made that shit up from 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Bro that's a super mutant
---
Plot twist : Dwight lands on his head, resulting in a 4k anyways
---
Lol what are you talking about. Playing both sides is key to understanding both sides.
---
If you play survivor and haven't played killer, then you don't fully understand survivor.
---
Oh, dont pretend like you would not get down within this 60 seconds timer if this perk did not exist XD
---
Beast of prey is much much worse
---
BHRV and lesion
---
Not gonna lie, you had me in the first half.
---
Haven't seen a great deal of his content, didn't seem too much of a camper, as for toxic, hmmm... maybe at a push, he is a wind up merchant at times for sure.
---
Who would you recommend instead?
---
Honestly though i was on r/forhonor for a second.
---
You wanna know what's the worst. When a killer pretends to give you the hatch and then just shuts it in your face. It hurts man, it really does. However, the wholesome moments when a killer gives you the hatch. Or is just really impatient and let's you finish the last gen so you can open the exit gates are the best.
---
Hands down this had been my favorite "unintended feature" of them all, then.
---
I'm sad to see this get fixed.
---
Can be counterplayed just like spirit fury
---
In the collection tab, I see lots of things with locks. But in the challenges tab, there's no locks depicted on anything. The eye symbol is blue and says to select challenges to progress, but I can't select ANYTHING.
---
Yes, serum expires two weeks after the rift closes. Cosmetics can always be equippable
---
Won't be Predator; they're giving him his own game and they won't want to compete.
---
I know, I already clarified
---
Vibe check
---
&gt;meg toxic first
---
&gt;GF returns the favor
---
&gt;meg ramps up the toxicity and DCs early game
---
&gt;"wHaTtA eXpEcT? yOu tBaGgEd aS gHoStFaCe" 
---
Lmao okay bud
---
Have heard. But thats my way of doing things. And even if a survivor is toxic i can forgive. Even some of the more toxic players do have a nicer side once you just say gg wp. Then again, its just my way of doing things. I do wish people are alot more kind and forgiving than I am.
---
A Vampire would be pretty boring most likely, bit a werewolf/lycanthrope might be a cool idea.
---
Especially as there reaching out into this, build up your power an then release it, bit.
---
The video lmao. Watch it. 
---
Meg tbags first
---
GF tbags back
---
Meg DCs
---
I bet you do that a lot xD
---
&gt; Camping is a very bad way of doing it. You're basically letting 3 survivors get away with that strategy.
---
But if you don't do that, you will waste several minutes on chasing another survivor, while survivors will waste 10-20 seconds on unhooking and then will go back to fixing generators. It's not physicly possible to chase and hook twice all 4 of them, especially if it's rank 1 full swf with all meta perks. By letting someone go you not increasing your chances to kill multiple targets, but increasing your chances to kill zero. 
---
Also pips mean nothing. Actually it's better to not get them, because games on lower ranks are usually way more ballanced and fun. But they are also mean nothing to survivors as well, because you won't get promouted if you just repair 2 genes and escape... So survivors are punished for staying focused on their main objective in this game as well.
---
To be honest mate, I'm just so tired of seeing everyone around here give each other a pat on the back for being cunts to each other. It's a game. It's not even a zero-sum game, everybody can win in the sense of pipping and getting a good amount of BP. I'm not saying killers should always give hatch, or survivors should sacrifice themselves or whatever, but we could all play this game and stab the shit out of each other without the rampant bullying and toxicity. 
---
But fair call, I'm being pretty harsh for a motherfucker preaching peace and love. I appreciate you calling that out.
---
Can we complain about how laggy and slow to load the ptb is? Not even the queing times just the game starting up in general...
---
Either way he's fucked.
---
uh, excuse me? default dwight is a 100% qt and i will give him hatch every time
---
Im kinda confused. What happened?
---
Can be unviable at red ranks without the right add ons but that doesnt meant impossible. It's fun putting on his silence add ons in red ranks
---
I need more of jake&amp;myers manga so bad
---
Asain girls know how to accessorise
---
&gt; but we could all play this game and stab the shit out of each other without the rampant bullying and toxicity. 
---
This, so much, I'm sorry for getting shitty with you in the other thread, but I whole-heartedly agree. 
---
The difference is that you want a change of community interaction, and I've just accepted that people will never change, so I welcome it with open arms.
---
Doesn't mean I'm right, or my way is better, but I definitely try my best not to be toxic, and I respect you doing your part to discourage the shitty behavior.
---
Lol this pic
---
Aye. Field studies have determined that if the killer starts kickin the palette then your lift is canceled so had his power not forced an animation on him he could have lightly pushed his toe into it to stop her, but apparently Legion can't jump over a palette that's in the middle of being lifted so that's basically the only time you could make a gain with this mid chase.
---
They have to be careful because if they nerf him the wrong way, it's a slippery slope to being one of the worst killers in the game; especially when you can play billy with practicality the same, if not better results.
---
Trap absolutely everything, fake teleports to scare survivors off a gen and try to get discordance atleast 1, if you dont have it, get some info perk that helps you out.
---
It was just other Survivors.
---
Ok with dream snares put them in spots that could be looped or your trying to stop them from saving someone. Put them down and it will tell you that they hit the trap and it will slow them down so you can catch up while in a chase. They have to be in the dream state for this so hit them so the snares will work
---
I want the devs to cripple the following perks:
---
Survivors - Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time.
---
Killers - Ruin, BBQ, Spirit Fury
---
Sure, Maps need to be looked at REALLY badly, but really, both maps and the meta should be changed, I’m sick to death of the same perks from every player in the game all day long.
---
https://youtu.be/vZ0XVL5S9aE
---
Okay man look at this clip and you tell me when spirit vaulted the window. I may not be the best player but fuck me dude it’s not doable
---
Combine the ideas. Take the broken hex and place it onto a remaining dull totem.
---
Once you earn a cosmetic, it will never leave your inventory (glitch permitting).
---
Oh ok sorry
---
Or you rework the map so you never have any issue with the perk again.
---
I have all the perks I need on my pig but you bet your ass I'm still filling her web up for add-ons because if I don't, I'm stuck using mediocre yellows/playing a playstyle I don't enjoy because I don't have the right purples/reds
---
I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that you probably haven't read the new patch notes that are literally adding this.
---
There is a new perk that essentially makes Legion pre nerf, stringer even, just be prepared to DC whenever you see someone use this perk on legion, it isn’t fun to go against.
---
I think another beast killer like Yeti would be fun
---
Nice artwork style
---
This may be a dumb question, but you are progressing both the killer and survivor challenges, yes?
---
I went to far down my killer side an had to go play survivor ones to keep progressing (unless that was just a big, it's hard to tell)
---
Probably the easy insta downs but I just see him as a underpowered Billy
---
We all know what this combo does, if you even “test it” then you deserve to die in an automobile wreck.
---
I like it as a feature. Rank is useless tbh but seeing if a person's got a prestige or leveled up character tells me more about them
---
Nope bc there is nothing u can change to make her more fair then she is now
---
Thank u
---
I just want splinters for killers I own to stop showing up
---
Sweet
---
Just slap on STBFL bc u just use shred on ur obsession and win
---
I think his point is that *everyone* that T-bags deserves to have a shit game, even if it's a vengeance-bag. So that Meg deserves a shit game, the Ghostface deserves a shit game, any time someone T-bags, a shit game is delivered via FedEx on the spot.
---
Use the dream snares to churn through any and all loops pretty easily.
---
Use the teleport for crazy map pressure. BBQ and chilli is filthy on Freddy because you can potentially be in a chase a few seconds after a hook.
---
That’s a good thing, I want the meta to change, if you’re healing in the match... it’s a good thing ._.
---
Nobody here is saying that it fixes the quitting problem. It addresses part of the problem as in people who DC. I’d much rather have a form of punishment for people who deliberately dc during the match than nothing at all. It’s really pessimistic about people to claim “this won’t change x” because it’s not for that!
---
Honestly does it matter? I like being able to see it as well, but lately ranks don't mean anything. I see rank 1s playing like potatoes and rank 15s moonwalking their way into bully mode all the time.
---
Yeah because I’m not into getting hit through a pallet or windows, fuck dedicated servers, playing killer just became too ez
---
Anti Heal Meta just got another friend.
---
We have rushing crew:billy,leatherface(I think),demogorgon, and now oni
---
Yeah its such a fun mechanic to take a guess and die 9/10 times. Really makes me want to play this game more
---
Lmao no? If ur breaking every pallet ur wasting so many potential hits at unsafe pallets
---
I've got bbq, bitter murmur, nurse's calling and noed
---
They're just gonna nerf the perk and remove the oblivious or make it so the frenzy bar doesnt go down if you're close to the killer by 32m or something like that.
---
One with a new mechanic
---
If after 3 seconds you still haven't gotten your hit then the pallet needs to go.
---
Its surely gonna get nerfed, big sad
---
I mean, depends on the pallet
---
not that its wrong its just that its literally pointless. literally anyone can make the same meme in 1 minute and ignore the watermark.
---
When comparing these two killer releases take into account that Spirit was an original character, while the demogorgon was riding a hypetrain and a well established fandom.
---
It does the same thing on PS4. I have to pray that the Survivor I’m chasing isn’t going to try for a 360. If they do, then it just comes down to luck.
---
you realize the doctor already has a plauge doctor skin right?
---
Everyone chant 2v8
---
Why wouldn't you?
---
Well for me good yaoi is the exact opposite of wasted talent
---
*Indian trap music intensifies*
---
Is there a full video of this anywhere
---
Wait a second...
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIJ5gkuvOA4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kIJ5gkuvOA4) (go to 8:06)
---
Isnt there a thread for the new killer and survivor considering people have started playing and streaming already ?
---
native American themed killer
---
https://www.twitch.tv/drfruityloops/video/411565782
---
No wonder you're complaining about Legion
---
Hey can the killer start the kick animation if the survivor is picking it up?? Like when a survivor is touching a gen and they cant kick it?
---
Deadass I only did it cause I've seen others do it
---
So once it activates, I can use the stagger reduction once until I’m no longer exhausted?
---
Which makes the perk even more useless.
---
You can try to start opening one gate. Make sure none of the lights above the switch light up yet. Then wait for the killer to check the gate. Once he leaves for the other gate open all the way and hope you’ll make it. 
---
That’s how I usually do it.
---
Well sorry then, guess there is another
---
dont worry, Im on the airport waiting for the next fly, im not familiarized with what country is, but it says something with Ormond or some shit.
---
I have legit problems just following them. It really feels like maybe 15 frames times.
---
How could you forget Dwight’s elf costume. Shame man, shame.
---
Toxic players: *genuine disgust*
---
hemorrhage is so damn useless effect. I wish it be buffed in the future
---
he was spectating someone else lmao
---
he was spectating somebody else
---
Perkless survivor is significantly easier than perkless killer.
---
Oh yeah, you are right! But the fact that they got the license to make Bill's cosmetics just steals the show for me
---
He considers himself “the cure” when in reality he is a problem, like doctor considering himself a doctor despite that life being behind him and now he’s just a shock therapy sadist.
---
That’s why that name would work better than two current killer’s names together.
---
he was spectating someone, so it made it look like there were only 3 people
---
That’s a really strong perk then. A lot of killers at high ranks will just run around pallets for mind games and then chase the survivor elsewhere if needed. The mere existence of this perk forces killers to break pallets and will allow good survivors to break off the loop for free and get to another, they don’t even need to run it, the same way DS prevents a lot of tunnelling at high ranks.
---
Wouldn't the counterplay be to drop pallets early or to only stun him when he's in his power?
---
Umbra PogU
---
I thought Otz showed it drops to 30
---
It’s enough to make a grown man cry
---
I'm 6'6" :)
---
Can't tell if sarcasm or not
---
Just drop pallets early, his base is still shit.
---
Clearly you give many fucks, move along keyboard warrior.

I personally think that rule 63 (genderbend) is less cursed than incest
---
&gt; broken killer offerings
---
Fucking lul.
---
#why are you yelling
---
I guess people were finding it hard to get a game. That or the devs are trying to hide the botched matchmaking that shoves a r20 with r1 players.
---
He looks great fun to play
---
People dodging low rank teamates is likely the reason
---
Salvation will also suit him then
---
The pain ...
---
Honestly probably the thing that bugs me the most is when survivors stay at the exit gates t-bagging, like please just leave
---
pretty sure he wouldn't even need a flashlight to fuck a single teen looking guy up
---
You can drop the pallet and stun the killer, then flashlight blind, then reset the pallet and drop it again.
---
Goddammit cartman
---
Sloppy butcher thanatophobia nurses
---
so what you’re saying is you’re rank 1? Why do I find that so hard to believe... “extremely killer sided” lmaoooo dude...
---
Agreed, I'm not sure if it's the dynamic of the game but there's a lot of 'I'm right, you're wrong', name-calling and childish behaviour that gets us nowhere.
---
Fair point, Hawkins Lab having so many good BL loops seems like a significant oversight
---
I am in no way shape or form an expert on this topic but I often find build off of high rank streamers with a couple thousand hours like monto (who has a youtube channel with alot of builds) or I visit their twitch stream and ask directly since some perks are out of date like scottjund although he streams pretty late he has a decent viewer base and will likely answer your questions
---
Have you seen how quickly Oni gets full charge just from blood orbs? I want to play him, but it seems way too easy as of right now to fully charge his power. I think maybe decreasing spawn rate would be best, alongside having them disappear if left alone for too long.
---
ONI(KAGE), CHARGE!
---
it won't be useful most of the time because it takes 3 seconds to raise and the killer can just break it
---
Is this real
---
Yeah I don’t think he thought that one out lol
---
Nice
---
Oh ivy ivy ivy-
---
Oh no I'm well aware of pallet blinds. I bring lightborn anytime I see a light. I havent really seen lithe being used much. The biggest issue I face is looking away and someone disappearing without leaving scratch Mark's or they cover their marks well. Also if they keep light blinding you and you arent breaking the pallets what stops them from just looping you until you get enough bloodlust to maybe catch up?
---
sanitarium is right though...just get better and you’ll realize the true power a survivor wields
---
It’s doom 2016 berserk mode, lets be honest.
---
**now to add STBFL on top of it**
---
Killers can still break pallets even blind so..
---
Mon to is that you?
---
That’s their faults, not the killer’s or the game’s. They need to wise up and realize they lost a guy and move on. It’s hard but it’s not impossible.
---
It really is, yet we feed into it like it's our purpose here. Whether you bad mouth or just post condescending/sarcastic comments, everything spreads it around with no end in sight.
---
It's crazy that this has been the pinnacle of this community for literal years.
---
https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/105387/patch-notes-3-4-0-ptb
---
First note of the first section.
---
Sure but if u fuck it up the pain train is gonna down u and usually dropping early would mean u either give up looping or cut a loop short which is hardly counter more like sacrifices but gl using head on bc that perk is completely useless against legion bc of the perk
---
They pallet stun you, you lose your heart beat on then meaning that their mending timer will go down even if you are right next to them
---
Same. But sometimes when they DC at the start, it's something down the line "You idiot! They DCd because you've used mori! How stupid can one be!?". Me be like "ah, wait, so that's my fault?".
---
I usually stay to farm some Chase for me and the killer, and giving him a last hit event. Or when there is a Huntress to let her pratice her hatchets and my dodges.
---
Thanks bro :)
---
basically what he’s saying is you’re a pussy with soft skin like half of this community so don’t feel bad. Only in dbd will people get so salty over teabags and dumb shit like that,that they gotta hop on reddit and make post about it. Toxicity exist in any game where the player can teabag lmao get over it
---
Took his hair with him too
---
Lol so true
---
it would also take at least 20 seconds to repair the pallet probably, which means wasting a lot of time for one pallet
---
If you're sure you've checked every node an are positive this isn't a user error, all I can suggest is to submit a ticket an hope you get a speedy response.
---
Hope it works out for you man, cheers
---
The Oblivious timer is the problem bc if a survivor can't hear a TR then the deep wounds is gonna go "well if the killer isn't here time to count t down" but oh wait legion is behind u
---
go take a shower stinky
---
Freddy making you oblivious is pretty ridiculous.
---
The best part is when you get your game sense developed, and you start predicting their moves.
---
This is pretty scary Michael look like a unit good job
---
Oh I completely agree. If any killer is camping a hooked survivor and no one is doing gens then youre fucking up lol
---
Spider/Scorpion based killer. Or an insect like a Moth or something.
---
The bleeding timer inflicted by Feral Frenzy will not go down when a survivor can hear your heartbeat, this is to prevent you from just following the person you stabbed until the go down from bleeding. Nemesis makes it so that when you are stunned, the person that stunned you can't hear your heartbeat for 40 seconds. You do the math.
---
It is true, even my own comment is ironic by calling it childish! It's a shame, I really do like the game, I just wish the community wasore of a community and less of a war amongst killers/survivors. Having started playing killer recently, I can see the frustration on both sides.
---
I know I can't find this, i'm not look in PTB updates, only in PS4 notes, sorry
---
Do you have a link for the whole thing?
---
I mean you dont have to believe. I dont play much killer, after I hit my rank again after a reset, but at least for my experience i hardly djnt get 4k or at least 3k.
---
I don't remember me complaining about legion lmao and that's a great clip taken out of context lol it's like idubbbz baiting everyone with slender gangem style
---
Yep, can attest
---
I dont, its custom game
---
The oni is literally the hillbilly with extra steps
---
You can make someone bleed out from deep wounds while chasing them.
---
I was hoping she would crawl upside down like the The Exorcist.

---
Its custom game
---
Especially when I give them the gate to be nice. Chilling out with me in the exit gate is not what I meant. Just fucking walk through.
---
Yeet the dweet
---
I respect that, as someone who plays mostly Spirit on the killer side (and has done so since her release before all the controversy) and has suffered just about every form of insult and DC you can get thrown your way. I'm sorry so many scumbags are out there, but yeah I pretty much just gen rush versus a Ghostface and spam look my camera so I don't get instadowned.
---
You’re right
---
Absolutely NO ONE is talking about it
---
And I was talking just about toxicity
---
Every you tuber/streamer say that though. When monto makes a video of a build, he calls it “his build” because he created it from his own thought. That’s exactly what Tru3 is doing as well.
---
He doesn't seem too fun to go vs, yeah.
---
Oh, well there you go. Pc isn't any better (Mythbusted)
---
You just glossed over my point. If you're facing a spirit and the spirit manages to hit you. Without Iron Will it is essentially impossible for the spirit to lose you as long as they have ears and aren't stupid becuz of the groans of pain you make when injured.
---
We’re having a discussion and I pointed out you were wrong and why you were wrong. If that’s toxic to you then oh well. “Toxic” lmao don’t box me in with the community this is ME conveying my thoughts on an opinion I didn’t agree with. Just because someone disagrees and points out why you’re wrong doesn’t make them toxic. Have a good day as well lol
---
Yes no mither counter very well because the oni can put u already in dying stats and he need blood for his power. But that make him useless vs u.
---
Avoid endgame chat. Just ignore it no matter what. Even if they mock your family heritage, ignore it. They want you to respond. Don’t give them what they want.
---
Also, stick to brown-early purple ranks. That’s where it’s less toxic from my experience.
---
Yeah people talk about gen rushing (not that it ever should be a thing) - But from a solo survivor standpoint, this isn't really winning the game.
---
IMO winning the game is having a full immersive game (which you would hope you can escape). While I think these things MUST remain in the game; Mori's and Keys, while fun, end the game early and therefore make the game stale/boring. Sure you escape/kill, but you don't get points or have a decent game.
---
It is the same with 'gen rushing'. If I enter a game, do a gen and as I finish it 2 more pop up around the map - i'm actually disappointed that the chances are, I won't have a fun game or get enough points to pip.
---
Or they could like, just not stun the Legion.
---
The Feng Min was being a troll from the start of the game. Body blocking, flashlight clicking and bringing the Nurse to people on generators. She went down and the nurse was proxy camping and started chasing me. She lost track of me and I went to save the Feng Min, just as I was about to unhook her she tried to unhook herself with her last attempt. 
---
So, I left her. It's pretty rude to try an unhook attempt when someone is coming for you. Was it petty of me? Maybe. I would've still unhooked her if she wasn't being a troll or was a low rank.  
---
Anyway, she gets unhooked by someone else and she finds me when I unhook another survivor. She continues to flashlight click and follow me for the entire match, fast jumping into lockers and trying to body block me into a corner. Eventually, she does. She keeps me in the corner for a while until the nurse finds us and OFC the nurse goes for me instead. 
---
Funny stuff.
---
Either the survivor doesn't know how to loop, so they don't try looping ever and just drop pallets and run, or the survivor knows how to loop, in which case they know the pallet is unsafe...and continues to run.
---
I don't know when you guys are actually encountering certain players, like these 80 second loopers or unsafe pallet loopers. These players are virtually non existent in my experience...but I also play at low ranks so who knows how things are elsewhere.
---
Oni-on
---
Can confirm. Red ranks just DC - they don'y have time for toxicity.
---
This is such a sad day
---
He seems like a less strong Billy with more utility, I'll need some more hands on experience before I form an opinion on this, but for now I'd say they're pretty equal.
---
The tracking on the blood...orbs? Is more useful then I had originally thought.
---
Is he more powerful than Hillbilly? No. When his power's up, he's just as powerful, but he doesn't have constant access to it like Hillbilly does. Thus, he's balanced.
---
That said, I could see BHVR nerfing him. He'll lose his power when downing somone (but he'll keep it when picking someone up) and his power won't last as long.
---
Myres perfectly conveys fear in this post his staggering size could make any tremble
---
No mither and self care 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
---
You should have been here before they fixed the SWF matchmaking. It was hell for some of us. I have been having way more fun since they  “improved” it. (Unless I play after midnight then it’s infuriating)
---
I had a 3 man SWF do the same thing. People just hop on this game to troll others.
---
When you spectate, the game doesn’t show your own icon, wether you died or escaped. This isn’t something that only occurs in kill your friends, you can spectate in a solo match.
---
It would only be a decent perk if it lit up dropped unbroken pallets across the map. Then you could go reset them for points
---
Absolutely Over Powered
---
And hope and no one left behind
---
If you use the oni perk nemesis you can basically play as the old legion. Because if you get stunned you don't have a terror radio to the survivor who stunned you. Meaning chase them down and they will still need to mend.
---
Step 1: Monstrous shrine
---
Yeah - especially when I encounter Spirit for some reason :/
---
Delete key
---
How’d you have only 6000 points after a hatch escape? Slugged whole match or something?
---
Use the search function.
---
Oh yeah, one of the downsides is the matchmaking. It takes so god damn long.
---
At least when I’m playing during the day (EU time). For some reason, at night I find matches much more quickly.
---
I mean, it kinda makes sense because most players don’t work after 9 to 10 p.m so a faster MM is to be expected, but the difference between the two parts of the day is gigantic.
---
&gt;Better to release a strong killer
---
Why is it ok for one side to have busted shit? lol
---
I am making an argument that the guy is too strong and needs toning down.
---
He has no cooldown after stopping the charge, whereas if you end your charge with Billy you have to stop, go through cooldown animation and then continue chasing. He's super forgiving for mistakes. He doesn't bump into walls even if you're running right into them, if you miss your charge attack you can just flick around the corner, the guy doesn't let you punish his mistakes. His instadown attack charges faster than instasaw. You get punished for healing to deny him blood orbs since healing drops extra orbs for him to pick up. He gets his power too quickly.
---
So broken doesnt count as injured?
---
I don’t get why lobby dodging would be a problem for this. The, most likely, SWF with a potato rank, would just find a new teammate in a few seconds. The person leaving has to queue up again and queues have been pretty fucking shit lately so they’re likely to stay anyway
---
Power is boring and doesn't help in chases, it's almost literally just Bubba's Chainsaw with Speed Limiter and Grisly Chains, but sounds like it can't break pallets. Bare in mind that Bubba is considered to be one of if not *the* worst killer right now.
---
Why is thicc robutt lady with abundant rule 34 in DbD?
---
well they finally did it, well atleast if it will be working as intended. I just hope the people with worse connection don't suffer penalties for something completely out of their hands. My main question with this is if it's survivor specific or also killer specific
---
He shouldve had Franklins
---
Almost as fun as running in a circle for 12 minutes at a time.
---
Ever wonder why the really popular killers (Nurse, Spirit) are the ones that ignore looping?
---
Dcing still sucks, but technically not wrong to be testing it on ptb either.
---
Is this Daniel Radcliffe's final evolution
---
I imagine BHVR are going to have to make the choice between either making BT proximity based rather than T.R or changing Nemesis. 
---
Nemesis has potential to break alot of things. Imagine MYC + Nemesis + Furtive chase. You see your obsessions aura, they cannot hear where you are coming from and you can insta down them. 
---
Even Rancor can have amazing synergy during the end-game for insta-downing and killing survivors who do a flashlight save or stun you.
---
Me: *goes up to save you with BT* 
---
You: *declines save*
---
Me: *dies*
---
It's like they are afraid of their own game providing fun and varied matches with different builds and synergies
---
Legion the worse? Have you seen what they've done to Amanda at this point? Lol
---
I adore that Feng head cosmetic. One of the best in the game. She’s beautiful.
---
Not at the moment but it will be in the next patch. Currently, "Protection hits" are hard to get, too hard for MoM to be useful, the next patch (comes in two weeks) will make them a lot easier to get.
---
I think he’s balanced, but he’s definitely going to get nerfed if survivor mains bitch about him.
---
This is the survivor equivalent of realizing the hag actually has eyes that are just too hard to see
---
YES YES YES YES YES
---
# YES
---
Did that last night and daaaamn he fast boi
---
As killer just smack gen and nod your head, most ppl will get it
---
and dont forget to do the same joke a million times with different overused formats
---
That’s a nice concept but idk how that would work. It does get frustrating especially when it’s a new player and they just wanna help out but also saying “nah, fuck u” while on the hook and declining it is like rough
---
I know right, beast of prey is way better than it because nemesis has to be a pallet/locker stun or a flashlight save
---
Mindblowing holy fuck
---
she can and I have
---
If legion stabs a second time they get stunned while the survivor gets a speed boost. It's shooting yourself in the foot. Even with Frank's Mixtape the deep wound timer won't go down in your terror radius.
---
No that’s stupid, e.g SWFs would reject saves from ransoms and give their friends the points. Or people would deny unsafe hooks even tho you have BT and likely both will get away
---
Every generic white girl is a country girl
---
Also asain is just a broader way of saying Japanese
---
Beast of prey combined with the deep wounds is way more problematic than nemesis.
---
Nemesis can at least be avoided for the most part with the same counter you use with enduring + spirit fury.
---
Beast of prey literally has no counter play
---
This clip doesn't show enough to rule out one specific scenario. 
---
What if Bill had DS? Do we know this Bill just got unhooked? Do we know Ghostface already waited a minute?  
---
If Bill had DS this would be an auto loose situation for Ghostface. 
---
Maybe the Killer just waited out the minute and came to the reason it wouldn't be enough time. So he could gamble for Adrenaline or DS. He choose Adrenaline.  
---
Do be fair, this includes the awareness from Ghostface that Bill had a key and this fact makes the scenario really unlikely. 
---
At the end of the Day cockily denying hatches is just annoying and frustrating as well as other toxic practices.
---
F U R I T I V E C H A S E
---
its literally exactly like a skin that already exists; I'd rather have something more unique and not just an archtype
---
Tbh I am more disappointed about his powers than the killer itself. 
---
I agree that the killer doesn't really offer much as hes much like a Myers combined with a Hillbilly. Suppose my worry is that people are already calling for him to be nerfed when in reality he is kind of in a spot between Myers &amp; Hillbilly. 
---
The perks don't have any real impact, especially Blood Echo which is only got use in killers that can keep survivors injured.
---
Nemesis is a cool concept and can work well with other obsession perks but is entirely useless on its own. Same issue as Furtive chase where on its own it serves no real purpose.
---
um ok
---
Add multiple branch like lines protruding from each other coming in from the corners and walls to make it look like the entity is closing in or is in control.
---
Which they absolutely will
---
No mither, self care, second wind, mettle of man
---
A punish shouldn't be awarded with a perk like MoM that rewarded getting hit it is fine if the hit was bc they saved their team m8 but getting a positive thing for something negative is dumb same with NOED it rewards you for doing nothing even rewarding a new killer for being bad which I think everyone can agree is not healthy. 
---
This is why I think Nemesis on legion is stupid bc it takes something negative *a stun* and rewards you with a easy down and it punishes survivors for getting stuns and more points this is not fun counterplay and imo FUN is the first part that BHVR should focus on fun for both sides not one side
---
I'm in NA as well.
---
Maybe it's my rank, I'm still pretty low on the rank structure. 
---
I'll give it a try later today and see how it goes.
---
That is actually very accurate
---
BBQ+C is the entire reason why I sprint to a locker every time I see someone get downed. It fundamentally changed how I play the game and I love it. Forcing people to hide instead of do gens/get close for the unhook is badass. Use that baby for tracking guys, it makes the game more fun for everyone
---
Right now probably Archives.
---
*laughs in The Oni*
---
So what’s the punishment ?
---
I am considering buying the DLC solely for BBQ+C
---
I'm sorry but I don't like Otzdarva. I watched several Dbd streamers recently and he was, by far, the least entertaining. Very dull.
---
Before and After JoJo's Bizarre Adventure
---
Syringe Purple Medkit, No Mither, Self Care, Calm Spirit, Hope.
---
Furtive Chase will not have that much of an impact unless Legion is actively camping, hardcore patrolling or the person who went to make the save is farming.
---
Also from what I've heard on the ptb furtive chase does not activate nemesis
---
Is it the one where be goes "AUUUUUUUUUEEEEEEEGHHHHH!"?
---
Well you didnt even gave my opinion... Wich isnt a fact just an OPINION a thought. And also you strait up called me a "noob who doesn't has any idea about the game"
---
*Careless Whisper Starts playing
---
She has very few unappealing cosmetics!! She usually looks pretty fashionable tbh
---
My Bubba uses Insidious, Agitation, Iron Grasp and Monstruous Shine. Pink mori so I chainsaw them after the unhook and murder.
---
Universal Horror Nights had a segment of one of their houses last year, “Scary Tales”, that was Hansel and Gretal themed. Tbh I don’t remember the whole story behind it but the kids ended up becoming cannibals and the witch would lure people in to use them for food to feed the kids. It was definitely creepy and could be a possibility. At least just to make conversation it could be, realistically would never happen.
---
PURGE THEM IN FLAME AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!
---
Agreed. I feel like her default outfit is the only one I really don’t like.
---
Is somebody going to tell them the withering blight ended a week ago
---
You can just stun them out of it. Nemesis is worse because something as simple as a stun gives a guaranteed minute of that bar going down
---
Looks like my Skyrim orc
---
Shoot you two are convincing me to try it out!
---
Hooks. Gets in chase. Uses Frenzy. Stabs. Unhooks. Undetectable. Ez.
---
It's not a podcast but each week a YouTuber called HybridPanda makes a YouTube video called shrinewatch and in it he talks about everything that's new in dbd that week and the shrine and then plays a game with the perks.
---
But it still wastes the killers time a bit, and doesn’t cheat them out of a bbq stack
---
I mean, Billy may not be OP, but he’s definitely in the top tier.  He is one of the easiest killers to 3-gen trap survivors with, and his map control is insane- and let’s not forget the Insta-Saw addons
---
r/okaybuddyretard
---
Mettle of Man? You mean Inner Strength right?
---
Killer that can set the whole map on fire isn't unique enough for you? He surely uses some previous killer's mechanics, but he is not the first and he is not the last one.
---
Besides, Doctor's cosmetic you were referring to isn't a classic Plague Doctor costume, so I have to disagree with you. Just because they would have similar themes, it wouldn't make it worse.
---
Spirit's blight skin - The Oni.
---
Hillbilly - Cannibal.
---
Myers - Ghostface
---
Legion - Ghostface.
---
Let's be real though the same can be said about Nemesis if survivors just don't stun the killer, the same way people figured out how to counter Spirit Fury, you just drop the pallet slightly earlier. Bloodlust is really not that hard to maintain, because you don't need to worry about catching up to the survivor, you literally just need to keep an eye on them. Also I'm pretty sure the end of Frenzy fatigue counts as a new chase so actually it's a 4 second stun and only 11 seconds of chasing to start the countdown. It's not the most busted thing in the world but like, what exactly does the survivor do at that point? There are only so many God Pallets on the map.
---
In theory, you could loop a killer at a pallet and just run away to come back later and reset it. Of course the amount of killers who would just continue the chase is around 50/50
---
Dream Pallets are always Picked Up, only the Doctor's fake pallets spawn in knocked down but those are not intractable.
---
To me he reminds of vampire Lord form from Skyrim
---
Lol this is gold :)
---
I'd recommend Scott Jund and OhTofu if you like Otz.
---
Honestly if id be this Jake id freeze in fear. Straight up wouldn't be able to move for minutes
---
My point is that you aren't taking iron will to counter spirit.  You are taking it because it is a good perk, and that you should especially take iron will if you get frustrated by spirit.
---
I hear you, I’ve already started my savings for next Halloween season
---
The pages are scattered through reddit but here's this page: https://www.instagram.com/p/B5DrnBvltnN/?igshid=1s8vzgltpaef1
---
The others shouldn't be far
---
This will be a perfect perk if you have an ooopsy with Freddy's dream pallets :)
---
Ad Mortem, Inimicus!
---
which I fully expect but my OP was never about it needing a nerf
---
Those people that joined for Stranger Things didn't stick around very long.
---
Your right, I forgot about that. I guess you would just mindgame yourself or your teammates when playing against a freddy.
---
Balanced landing when the next chapter comes out
---
Then you just pair Nemesis with Brutal. If they throw it early you break it fast. If they stun you.....
---
Tick tock, tenno.
---
If we ignore the counters then yes, there is no counter
---
Charger: *Charges a Survivor through a window, instakilling you and him*
---
Good times
---
Have you ever been to the game
---
They changed the system, so whoever is the highest ranking survivor decides the killer rank so if there’s 3 rank 20s and a rank 1 the killer will be rank 1. Or three red rank survivors and a brown rank will still get you a red rank killer. So you can’t just bring a meme build because the killer doesn’t know they are potatoes. The killer is still going hard with meta perks.
---
God damn he is handsome.
---
She's supposed to be a ghost. Nurse predates her by years and floats over the window. This shit is lazy.
---
He really shouldn’t lose his power when picking people up. I‘ really not looking forward to getting slugged.
---
It was buffed dummy. 0.9 seconds is less time than 1.2 and 1.35 seconds
---
Oni has a unique step over, and so does the Nurse.
---
Please please tell me you can double stun with it
---
So nemesis question.... since it only procs on a stun/blind, and the aura last four seconds... by the time the stun is over wouldn’t the aura be gone?
---
This is what I thought they were going to have her do. Especially after seeing demos awesome vault
---
If the counters are ignorable then we ignore the counters. And if you're really worried about counterplay then simply run both Nemesis *and* Beast of Prey. They stun you? Nemesis triggers. They play it safe? BoP triggers. It's a lose-lose for the survivor.
---
The opposite
---
His power isn't preventable though. 
---
He gets charges for hitting healthy Survivors, and bleeding frequency doesn't change blood drops.
---
No Mither doesn't change how often you bleed.
---
Yeah. U can use a detection perk and start a new chase
---
If Breakout stacks I'm fuckin' done
---
I agree, the same can be said about Nemesis, and if people actually started to think about countering some combos instead of blindy doing the same stuff we would not be crying "broken" when everything new comes up. 
---
People act like these things are so insane when we have killers that have far more consistent instadowns like Billy or mechanics that completely ignore loops, but people are freaking out about a "guaranteed" down after half a minute of chase before anyone even tried countering it.
---
What console are you playing on? I’m ps4 and feel the exact opposite about the frames. It’s never been worse since I started playing.
---
Bro you don't like these two guys who have no complete relation having gay sex bro you're homophobic bro 😡
---
I play on a standard PS4.
---
I’m not saying the frames are perfect, but I’m feeling so much better than when I started playing back in 2016
---
Thank you for blessing me with this, one of my favorite memes to-date
---
Also the Huntress with Beast of Prey, the Legion doesn't have to mindgames at all with these perks, it's like old moonwalking Legion but with no moonwalk, thanks BHVR
---
No since the entity controls certain realms in the spotlight video the guy said he dropped the temple in the red forest since it’s easier to put it in a realm he knows better then to shove it in its own land
---
Aye but at that point you're basically running *either* Brutal or Nemesis, since they won't both be that useful at the same time, and you'd also be running Brutal on Legion who does still make use of it but definitely not as much as some other killers. The real trick is to run BoP and Nemesis together instead.
---
I think that’s the guy that had Ace in the arse or something like that as his flair for a while.
---
He always seemed like a total dick :D
---
Welcome to the Pig’s life
---
.............really thought this was a joke sub, but dear lord it's not. Oni come pick me up I'm scared.
---
Bruh why does everyone think that they are theorist gods after the predicted the oni. THE ONLY REAL TEASER TRAILER WAS AN ONI MASK WHAT ELSE DID YOU EXPECT?
---
I can enjoy the game perfectly fine, win or lose, doesn't matter.
---
What I can't enjoy is super toxic SWF that all run identical characters and are constantly teabagging, blinding, etc...
---
Playing in Australia, we also get the Chinese hackers coming in a wrecking games.
---
I get what you're saying, but there's a point where the toxicity gets in the way of playing the game. Been the same for all my mates that played too.
---
No Mither has also very good synergy with dying.
---
Heheheh you're 100% correct, though honestly I don't think what people are worried about with these new potential synergies is that it will be any sort of overpowered, so much as it'll just be really fuckin annoying to deal with due to lack of counterplay and slow painful assured defeat.
---
yea thats what I said
---
You don't bleed with no mither lol but you leave orbs regardless...
---
And his power is preventable by being healthy and avoiding overexposure to constant re-injures you can keep his power usage few and far between... the power itself is basically weaker billy... it would be neat if there was some kind of aura reveal when queingnup the power and the removal of the power loss when hooking a survivor... or maybe a map wide terror radius when in the power, something to separate it from Billy as a "weaker version of the power which is basically is.
---
That‘s called proxy camping. 
---
You‘re welcome
---
No, I dont. People play them because they dont bother learning how to play the game. As a killer you need to learn mindgames such as moonwalking and you need to learn how the tiles work and how long a survivor can run it. You need to take advantage over survivor's lack of sight in certain situations and punish them for their mistakes. That's what it is to play killer
---
.You outplay people using tactics and utilizing your knowledge, not stand still and react to what they do or just blink through walls. Nurse is fine since she has visible movement that people can use to outsmart her.
---
I know I was like in my head ''I swear I've seen that username before'' then I looked back and it was some salty guy I've argued with about the pig he was a dick xD
---
For me is allright... my friend is also in same situation like you, not loading
---
Oh okay I would love to see a sand map though :c
---
right? It's like they *want* people to run the same meta boring build every single game, i don't understand the mentality behing having so many perks that do nothing for the game when you could balance them every now and again and actually have a multitude of metas
---
If the counters are ignorable, then you shouldn't need either as you'll down the survivor just fine.
---
I’m not upvoting, bitch!
---
Honestly, i would pay for that to be a cosmetic piece :D
---
He is just billy with more steps
---
I know I'm 2 days late but as a fellow protan I'm glad you're at least putting pressure on BHVR to do something about this... I tried to ask them about a CB mode in their AMA and surprise surprise, it didn't get an answer!
---
hahahahahha i literally never mentioned anything about what you said being a fact,I clearly mentioned I was giving my thoughts on your OPINION :) and you can tell a lot about a players level of experience when they say stuff like “this game is extremely killer sided”
---
Nicely done.
---
Let me give you a little example
---
Let's consider that furtive chase is going to work in conjunction with nemesis
---
If the Legion is a distance away and I save somebody off to hook you become an obsession
---
I could literally just hide.
---
Why you ask 
---
If I'm under the Oblivion status condition I'm no longer affected by terror radius do you remember how killer instinct specifically works with frenzy it's based of terror radius so if I hide in a locker for example Legion can't find me.
---
They can't find me so can't hit me with deep wounds meaning can't cheese out the timer.
---
It's why I said furtive chase would only impact if the Legion is camping, the saviour is farming or Legion is hardcore patrolling
---
The Nurse floats and therefore has a unique 'any movement' animation.
---
I haven't seen The Oni vaulting - but I welcome more interesting animations.
---
The point is everyone is complaining because the first vault animations that actually do something different aren't different enough. If they did the same step over animation as everyone else; nobody would bat an eye lmao.
---
Yeah those would be good changes in both sides. Oni gets to keep his one shot and dash and survivors don’t have to run unbreakable every damn match.
---
Haha stinky poopi
---
lmao the dislikes
---
lazy, thoughtless ruins aesthetic and spirit concept , why do i expect more?....
---
I don’t think they have been as bad after I started playing again
---
For like 2 weeks I constantly saw post from him and always wondered what’s wrong with him
---
even if the killer can chase you easily in coldwind farm when you use it?
---
No mither, Self care, Metal of Man, Inner strength with a 16 second heal medkit.
---
When I read the perk, it never crossed my mind to drop pallets preemptively (essentially wasting them). 
---
The killer doesn't always break pallets in chases. If I see the killer chasing a teammate and they move to another loop after a pallet is dropped, I will go lift that pallet.
---
It'll be nice to have legion back to what he was like in the trailer. Call it broken all you want but to me swf breaks the game as well. If you can tell me how it doesn't and change my mind you get a million buckaroos
---
Weird. My PS4 is a slim. Don’t know the difference but it has to be better than the og right?
---
thanks for sharing your opinions!:)
---
What a lame ass excuse. I have both of those things as well. Quit begging for handouts. If you don't want to work at getting the perks you want then go play kill your friends mode. Literally everything is unlocked for every character in the game 24/7.
---
It's intentional due to how powerful his demon mode is. I think it's fair if it like, turns it off but not make him lose charge on it.
---
i'm not ? for some reason the text got bigger ? i don't even know how to make it  so it must be a bug XD
---
I didnt say anything else? Obviously there are many people who enjoy it but I don't. Thats all i said, i wouldve wished a different ending
---
thx ! &lt;3
---
And I’m sure Otz loves you
---
Im gay myself
---
1 perk can create so many builds I LIKE I LIKE. come killers fuck my butthole with it I'm ready !!
---
Yeah I know, I was so hyped for these changes and I really hope they don't stop here because I was disappointed, yeah the faster pallet vault and faster Frenzy is cool but STBFL isn't as optimal as it was and the power is still complete garbage
---
Ikr!
---
Finally we can see other perks getting some play. Like Hex Ruin for example.
---
Haha this happened to me as well! That entire room is blocked.
---
I wish they would just accept that's it ok to have perks without tiers sometimes.
---
Balanced, real weak in the beginning but he picks up steam real fast once there's an injury.
---
Wait what's going on with Legion and the new perk? I thought Legion was trash tier
---
Alien killer on the moon, but the entity was feeling a bit groggy that day so he just spawned some trees and a shack since it's easier
---
Yeah, that's why this is a just a meme, I making fun of it but I don't think it's a serious issue.
---
I hate this perk so fucking much. It really becomes a problem in the community when every single survivor runs it like killer runs ruin. It should obviously be considered a problem if nearly every build requires using it. I can’t even have fun as a killer in red rank because every single boosted red survivor uses a combo of no mither and self care. Where’s the counter play? Where’s the fun? You seriously telling me I have to buy a new killer just to counter this bullshit? smh dude.
---
Yes it is. Killers have not been nerfed on release since plague. If anything they were all buffed.
---
Didn't even acknowledge Autodidact. Truly mad disrespect coming from OP
---
Already hate him lol
---
Entity now has to compete with trapper
---
If it’s dropped it gets chopped
---
Technology has some weird feats these days so I can't say much, but the first thing my simpleton brain thought up upon reading that was "Well no, if it's thinner, then there's probably less room to fit in the extra processing stuff." Yeah, I just woke up, and I don't know what to tell you.
---
They didn't nerf Ghostface or Demo either, Freddy wasjt nerfed either
---
This is what i saw, "Great, Another billy with better tracking". I'm happy he has some kind of cool down so he can't just spam his 1 hit down move which billy lacks but I expected something more unique, Not a billy clone
---
Hit a survivor or keep running FAST... Tough decision. Which is why I run pwyf on trapper
---
&gt;You might not feel it, but grind and time investment is what keeps 80% of the community playing.
---
I don't buy this. The grind is the most boring, shallow part of the game. It puts me off of playing more than anything. If I logged in today and every single Killer and Survivor perk was unlocked and I had 1,000 of every add-on this would not diminish my desire to play; in fact, it would increase it.
---
If there really are a lot of people out there who play just for the mindless grind then that makes me sad.
---
*“Spirit just never was the same when Oni came to dbd, if was as if she lost her grit.”*
---
You are definitely not the only one... this sub is full of people saying the exact same thing..
---
That was litteely the only time a killer was nerfed besides plague.

---
He may be a hulking demon samurai ogre, but he's the hero we need.
---
What killers are you playing? Maybe that’s the problem :D
---
That’s if the killer slugs a no mither which they won’t, 3 hits,3 downs,3 hooks and you’re out.Bing bang boom
---
But other Ash perks have been on there as well, and they all cost 2000 as well. I'm also pretty sure Ghost face (a killer who came after ash) also has had things on the blood web that were 2000.
---
Idk what add one you need but try to aim a little more to the neck
---
Aim directly at the killers face, try blinding on pallets, takes approx 1.5 seconds
---
They prefer humanoid killers because they can re-use animations for carrying/hooking/etc. They said as much in the AMA the other day. 
---
Xeno can still stand up like a person, and maybe get on all fours and run as a power.
---
I'll probably use it in the same way I deal with totems. If I see a totem I'll do it or come back to it and it'll be the same with pallets. I'm not expecting this perk to be in my 4 must have but it'll be fun to mess around with
---
Maybe because its the level 40 perk. I think ruin was 2700 too
---
God dayum bruh time to main killer again
---
Good thing about slugging though is that your teammates can pick you up while he's chasing someone else. Or you can run Unbreakable, like I do in the ptb. But seriously though, I hope they do something to encourage less slugging
---
Watch HybridPanda he is the only youtuber ive seen that I enjoy watching
---
I think it just means 4 people need to step in a trap
---
I expect them to nerf or change this perk at some point because I'm sure this wasn't their intention when making it
---
That sounds even more balanced than my idea. Watch them steal our work.
---
r/whoosh
---
I got BBQ+C with shards and got it on my Demogorgon with Ruin, really fun.
---
Ya i triednthat but didnt get notification. I was wondering maybe there are specific addons that blinds faster? Not sure, maybe i just gotta farm fir days til i get lucky 😙
---
Bruh when did they add Fawkes
---
I swear I did it but maybe I miscounted :/
---
Nah, ruin was 2000 as well. I'm almost certain this is the first time a perks been more expensive then the rest.
---
4 instances of someone stepping in a trap. Same or different person, grabbed or not, whatever
---
I hope so
---
I aim at their forehead
---
Nemesis, Beast of Prey, Furtive Chase, and any 4th perk. You’ll never have to M1 anyone foolish enough to pallet stun you, flashlight blind you or unhook your obsession/be your obsession/exist in the same game as you.
---
I'm not sure,  I completed the challenge first try
---
How much time exactly could you tell, what is the mend timer
---
No its not theres almost always one thats 2700
---
It can be the same goober four times or every survivor once as long as four traps get stepped on by survivors.
---
Only if his Mori turns someone into an idiot sandwich
---
You’re fun...
---
No one deserves him
---
Funny thing is, I do have over 700 hours.
---
Another funny thing. You ready for this? You literally don't need to play any other characters in the entire game in order to unlock their teachables. 😱 shocking I know right? In fact, it's smarter not to. This way you can focus your BP into 1 character, have the perks you want and then still be able to work on another on the side without having to worry about the initial character since you'll have them set up how you want them to be. 
---
The only reason you ever need to play as more than one character or one that you don't use is for dailies and they're usually lame and easy to do. "Open and escape with X named survivor" 😱 real fuckin hard amirite? 
---
"Down 4 survivors with X power" 
---
"Do X for Y amount of time"
---
You just want the perks free with no time put into the game. Y'all are just babies for real.
---
Once they made the change where you could buy characters with Iridescent Shards, they dropped support for new Splinters.
---
Splinters only existed to give a 'free' option for paid DLC characters you didn't own to try and entice you into actually buying them if you liked them.
---
This is mega disappointing 😥
---
I usually focus on Freddy, Amanda, and Ghostface, but I play most of the killers pretty regularly for dailies and whatnot.
---
This is a trial. I've accepted this trial to stand victorious against my hoaxes. A person grows once they are able to defeat their weaker replicas. Wouldn't you agree, Rin Yamaoka?
---
when 2 people have the leader perk
---
first time on shrine
---
Ill allow it
---
Darn let’s not play survivor for a few weeks is on my checklist now :(
---
What is BAN?
---
perk:lamb sauce located
---
I haven't seen one if so.
---
*Laughs in ghostface* I don't have to worry about that
---
If enough people use it it'll be an indirect buff to Spirit Fury, since breaking pallets as soon as they drop will effectively make people using it have to play with just 3 perks.
---
Yeah I'm basically saying he's a better hillbilly
---
11,000 BP well spent
---
Its just like the old shire where they cost 500 but there would be one thats 750
---
I find a nurse that can phase through walls and floats a lot more scary than a Walmart brand Broly. To each his own though
---
Perk: WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE

Dr who crossover when BHVR
---
Do you have any other points besides being rank 1 or 2? No hate just asking,for real...You did say before you didn’t play killer much so I don’t know. Do you have evidence? Anyways,the majority of players including survivor mains would agree that survivors have the upper hand. It’s so easy to bully them. Also,only about 4 killers are actually viable,I play all of them but only 4...ghostface,nurse,spirit,and hillbilly.Even then I could easily bully them in solo que and swf would be a whole different kind of hell for them. Not always,but most of the time. I find it hard to believe no more than 2 people have ever escaped in your whole 2 years of playing killer at rank 1 as you claim. You must not be playing enough games if that’s the case,you did say the word never
---
You would only get decisived striked if you tunnel.
---
Did you deadass just say you counter Oni by not getting hit?
---
Legacy 2
---
Before anyone asks no this doesn't give away where the survivors/killer are, this effect is client side which means only the person looking at them can see them, they aren't pointing the same direction on everyone's screens.
---
25 seconds if u stab a healthy survivor. 15 if u stab an injured person. -5 with the addon. And franks mixtape does 5 seconds of damage.
---
 Yikes they are going for billy even though he’s like the most balanced killer in the game now
---
Excuse me? So inner strength, second wind, (the new pallet lifting perk, the new struggle bonus perk), mettle of man (now that protection hits have been fixed), flip flop, etc. That all came out this year aren't good?
---
Cause I think the last time we got decent killer perks was plague.
---
Rarity, as decided by BHVR - it affects the frequency of their appearance in the Bloodweb.
---
Thank you! ❤
---
No worries, I didn't know the thread and comment would blow up the way it did and the timing is so close.
---
A really good desert map set at dusk or using the kind of lighting used for Coldwind would be awesome.
---
Oh ok then aside from literally not having a power when the game starts and being the biggest most obvious killer in the game, yeah he's better cooler Hillbilly.
---
Two words. Nemesis Legion.
---
That's actually kind of sad 😔
---
Had a hag daily yesterday so I hit the SWF team that loaded into my lobby with the classic basement build. Managed to get called at least 3 racial slurs in post chat 🤣
---
Daaaamn he actually looks cool as fuck, when’s he out and is there anything revealed???
---
They should give Dwight the ability to see lockers auras within 24 meters for April fools
---
1st time on shrine = 2700 shards
---
2nd+ on shrine =2000 shards
---
sheeeeesh what a reach... “the mask is too pink”The mask and everything else looks great! But that mask though 🔥especially great. Awesome cosplay
---
This game is made by like 3 people. They can't add any new mechanics to it only tweak old ones.
---
Killer that comes in chapter 14 "The Oni".
---
Im completely with you on the forgetting the hooked survivor. The way I play is once that hooked survivor is on the hook, they're out of the game. The only people I need to worry about are those that are still running around. Ultimately this works in my favor, since realistically it's faster to hook someone twice/three times to kill them than stand there camping waiting for the hook to do all the work.
---
Bro its iconic dont tell mom plz no
---
Imagine seeing this charge at you in a dimly lit warehouse
---
It gets rough, dude. People are always like 'WhY aRe YoU mAd, It'S jUsT a GaMe," and you're sitting there like, "Yeah, but having people constantly funnel toxicity at me because of my favorite character really wears down on me after a while." And then they just laugh.
---
I HATE THAT KILLER MAINS TAKE THEIR WORST/MOST ANNOYING GAMES AND APPLY THOSE TO EVERY GAME AS IF THEY ARE THE NORM. 4 STACKS ARE FAR FROM THE NORM, AND NON 4 STACK TEAMS GET FUCKING DUMPSTERED AT HIGH LEVEL PLAY. I'M RED RANK AND ALMOST NEVER PLAY AS 4 STACK, AND I BASICALLY DIE EVERY SINGLE GAME BECAUSE WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE THE 4 WAY COMMUNICATION YOU LITERALLY CONSTANTLY WASTE HEALTH STATES AND HOOKS FOR NO GEN PROGRESSION.
---
BUT THE WORST PART IS THIS SUBREDDIT PERPETUATES THE MYTH THAT SURVIVORS HAVE THE ADVANTAGE AND THE GAME HAS BEEN BALANCED AROUND 4 STACK PLAY EVEN THOUGH IT'S RARE. THE REALITY IS 99% OF SURVIVORS CAN'T LOOP FOR MORE THAN 30 SECONDS WITHOUT BEING DOWNED, CAN'T PROGRESS THROUGH HEX:RUIN EFFICIENTLY, AND DON'T PROPERLY PLAY VS PERKS LIKE DISCORDANCE AND BBQ EVEN AT A "HIGH" LEVEL. THIS RESULTS IN CONSTANT PRESSURE FROM THE KILLER FROM THE START AND NEARLY NO GEN PROGRESSION UNTIL BY SOME MIRACLE THE SURVIVORS CAN STABILIZE.
---
I ACTUALLY SUSPECT THAT KILLER MAINS DON'T HAVE FRIENDS AND ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO SPEND THEIR TIME ON THIS SUBREDDIT BITCHING ABOUT HOW ONE OF THEIR TEN GAMES THEY GOT LOOPED FOR 60 SECONDS AND 2.5 GENS WERE COMPLETED.
---
I AM ACTUALLY AT MY WITS END WITH THE GAME AND I'VE ONLY BEEN PLAYING FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS, WHEN THE GAME HAS BEEN OUT THIS LONG AND KILLERS HAVE SUCH A VOCAL BASE AND ARE ABLE TO PUT SO MUCH INFLUENCE ON HOW THE GAME IS PLAYED, IT BECOMES QUITE UNFUN. I WOULD SAY A GRAND TOTAL OF ZERO PERKS THAT ARE "TOP TIER" ARE ACTUALLY *FUN* TO USE AS A SURVIVOR, AND EVERYTHING I DO FEELS FUTILE AND LIKE I'M PLAYING AGAINST A RIGGED DECK.
---
Trap a survivor 77 times in a single bear trap while using monstrous shrine.
---
*must be done in the first 3 minutes of a single trial*
---
Tell that to my long as fuck survivor queues on Asian servers
---
Killer or survivor obsession perks
---
CAN SOMEONE TELL ME IF BOTANY KNOWLEDGE ONLY EFFECTS THE OWNER OF THAT PERK, OR THE STATEMENT “ PLANTS AROUND THE CAMPFIRE” ACTUALLY MEANS EVERYONE CAN HEAL FASTER ? 
---
2 YEARS I VE BEEN PLAYING THE GAME AND COULDNT FIND A DEFINITIVE ANSWER GOOGLING IT. 
---
AND FUCK WRAITH !
---
hahahahaha what tf is this 😂not hating on the actual model cause it looks cool but she looks more like kate . Yui is asian... and uh she looks white here
---
BHVR wouldn’t fucking uproot their game to make it more scary they have a formula that they clearly like and are gonna keep it
---
IT DOESN'T WHEN HE'S DASHING.
---
Wrong
---
he was spectating someone else
---
That's actually really fucking cool. Make it a cosmetic devs!
---
you know why...
---
3 if you can.
---
Is a joke? No mither is a essential part of my Rush build I never going to be able to do the tomes challenges of dark sense againts the oni
---
He's broken beyond belief and that's undeniable. I love the concept nonetheless and I hope they don't touch him that much
---
What's even sadder is that this game was originally designed and balanced around solo queue. Now that the devs are designing killers to combat SWF altruism, it's really tough out there for us solo survivors of we're against a moderately decent player at the controls of the killer.
---
a scrub thing to say. Only able to play killer cause of cheeky crap lmao you smoking dick if you think it won’t be patched by the time the chapter drops
---
What are we supposed to be seeing here? Aside from a toxic survivor taunting at the exit gate.
---
That’s what I was thinking too
---
Oh my god this is so cute
---
Bro,Demogorgon for Prank 5 Blow when?
---
I HATE THAT A MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT POST VIDEOS OR SCREENSHOTS ON THE SUBREDDIT DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE THE PLATFORM THEY ARE ON TO SCREENSHOT OR RECORD CLIPS AND INSTEAD THEY USE A PHONE CAMERA THAT'S ALWAYS SOMEHOW POTATO QUALITY OR SIDEWAYS.
---
That's classic, good stuff.
---
I wish they had a chat filter system like R6: Siege. Messages with racial slurs and the like aren't displayed and the player is removed from the match and handed a ban for it.
---
No fuss, no issue. The only ones who complained were obviously the type who just wanted to use racist language with impunity.
---
Nothing, and I am not toxic
---
well we don’t actually know because chargers make an appearance in L4D2 in the original campaigns
---
well if you think about it, havnt a lot of the dlcs launched with clashing survivor and killer perks? Laurie had ds, allowing her to escape fast if she was the obsession. Myers has all obsession perks. quinten has wake up, while Freddy has remember me. Kate has dance with me, clown has bamboozle. Idk it just feels like kinda a theme to me, although I can’t think of directly ones for stuff like Adam and spirit, Jeff and legion. The new girl just seems to go against the new dudes more than others. Blood against his character and his exhaustion perk, the pallet one is kinda bad against nemesis. It just feels like a theme. and for the 4man swf all with that perk, I hardly doubt that would work. If ur leaving that many pallets unbroken, I kinda think ur doing something wrong as killer tbh.
---
He thinks he's good cuz he moonwalked a little and 360ed like a goober
---
The higher in ranks you go the more it flips. It's way harder to rank up as killer even if you "win" most of your games but it's easier to pip as survivor where you die but did enough to advance. That's why you see more of a disparity really.
---
In the thumbnail, i feel like he's doing a 'JoJo' pose.
---
Here goes the twenth
---
Unless you have another survivor following the survivor getting chased, the ability to pick up pallets is useless because you can just go back and break them
---
Mori isn't actually linked to Obsession at all aside from one perk called Rancor. The Obsession mechanic on its own does absolutely nothing aside from awarding bonus points to the survivor who was the obsession when their game ends. However there are several perks along with a few items that do in fact have interactions. The one I mentioned before, Rancor, is one of these perks, it makes it so that when all the generators are finished you can instantly murder whoever your Obsession is with a mori and they go down in only one hit. There are quite a few though so if you want more information then I'd suggest looking up more specific information on the wiki.
---
i believe he is out already.....a lot of gameplay on youtube already!!!
---
Then why did you t-bag
---
Except he gave away his cat after posting such an emotional video about.
---
Noob3 is a shit.
---
a scrub thing to say. Anyone with an actual brain and experience knows survivor is basically a bully sim . Killers are weaklings compared to good survivors. Seems all the bad survivors and new players are the only ones complaining about killers being too op
---
I hate how accurate this is
---
Pls nerf legion more
---
/s
---
It isn’t about the fact they actually get nerfed/bugged but rather the minority of survivors who complain for the sake of complaining.
---
Some survivor once told me red ranks is gonna roll me, I ain’t the sharpest tool in the shack.
---
I forgot that perk was even in the game, what with everyone running Monstrous Shrine
---
Agreed, it should be changed
---
That might have been me. Was there a blood Laurie?
---
Guys who say they are 6' versus guys who are actually 6'
---
A mummy killer to go with it would be amazing
---
I think I played with you last night! There was definitely a potato I played with. I was bloody Laurie.
---
It’s going to be so much fun to play with but so annoying to play against
---
If he wants to die let him die. It's honestly not a big deal, and he clearly doesnt mind.
---
What a B R U H moment
---
Now combine it with save the best for last and he be the fast thicc boy ever
---
Get blinded for 2 seconds and remove a loop from the game? Are you sure they wont just remove pallets? Survivor's severely overestimate how useful it is to blind killers at pallets, especially good ones who listen for the flashlight to click off.
---
I know it wasn't a feature, and Legion wasn't really oppressive without that.
---
Literally every killer will catch a survivor eventually, the game IS about delaying the inevitable long enough to win the game.
---
As far as I know that is not the case, but it´s only been on the PTB one day, so people need to play with it more to figure out all the interactions and counterplay.
---
I do one wuicl struggle to wave at people and let them know it’s safe to rescue, as appear to fast struggles to signify the killer is near.
---
Wait what? It literally has no change that’s sos scuffed
---
AS FAR AS I'M AWARE IT'S JUST THE OWNER'S HEALING SPEED! AND I FEEL YOU BECAUSE LATELY THE ONLY WRAITHS I HAVE ENCOUNTERED DECIMATE THE TEAM, AND WHOEVER IS THE LAST ONE LEFT, THEY TAUNT THEM WITH THE HATCH AND SLAM IT IN THEIR FACE. SO MANY DO THIS LATELY AND I'M HOPING WRAITH MAINS ARE DOING ALRIGHT IN THEIR BING BONG BRAINS.
---
Sadly mine is only December first but I guess NNN being over is a good present :(
---
micro peni mentality. Playing only broken things in the game to avoid any sort of challenge and feel proud of himself
---
lol okay sure
---
BAMBAM - *Monto*
---
The issue is also with 4 survivors and 1 killer, toxic survivors are inherently more common to play with.
---
Let’s say 20% of all players are toxic, regardless of role.
---
There is a 20% chance that the killer in any given game is toxic, but an 80% chance of at least 1 toxic survivor.
---
Oh look, it's the weekly "I played Killer for the first time and sooooo understand you guys now"-post.
---
Just play both sides equally and you will realize that they are both not that different.
---
Nemesis makes it so whoever stuns you with a pallet/locker or flashlight blinds you becomes the obsession. After becoming the obsession they're oblivious for a minute so the terror radius doesn't exist. So as a legion you can chase someone, get stunned and then stab them with you ability which applies the deep wounds effect (like borrowed time). The deep wounds timer only stops when you're in the killers terror radius so you can chase someone with deep wounds after they activate nemesis and die while in chase due to that effect. Beast of prey does the same thing and only requires you to get bloodlust 1 instead of getting pallet/locker stunned or flashlight blinded.
---
What do you mean with no change? It's purple!
---
I tried it in 6 games cant get a fucking blind. I'll just takena hit and not get this done and not complete the archives
---
10 I think
---
Oh shit you right
---
He kinda looks like mcu draxx tbh
---
I repeatedly watched the video to see if there was ANYTHING, anything at all, that could have caused yo getting hit
---
You did nothing to cause getting hit, not a single thing. He didn’t even look to the left by the end of the swing, instead he did a spin to the right, making a hit genuinely impossible even with the capsule hitbox and ping.
---
And probably gone after PTB because of salty people spamming the forum :(
---
I kinda meant it so i won't be matched against this kinda legions but i get how it sounds your way too
---
Even if it's possible why would they intentionally make her hair look a different color than it is? The answer is they wouldn't.
---
STBFL, MYC, Territorial Imperative, Agitation
---
I FINALLY GOT HEX: RUIN TEACHABLE AND FULLY LEVELED ON MY MAIN, GHOSTFACE. THE FIRST GAME I USED IT IN, RUIN WENT DOWN SOMEWHERE CLOSE TO 25 SECONDS INTO THE MATCH! MY HEART SUNK THROUGH MY CHEST AND OUT MY ASS BUT I STILL MANAGED TO GET MY 3K DESPITE A STINKY BILL BEING FLASHLIGHT TOXIC ON THAT GIANT TEMPLE OF PURGATION MAP.
---
You have to stand completely still and vulnerable at a down pallet for 3 whole interrupted seconds. If the killer even *starts* kicking the pallet during this time period then it trumps the survivor action, and there's always the possibility that the survivor can just fuck up the drop the second time around instead of more safely sliding over it. The amount of times I've lunged through a cocky pallet squatting survivor is too large to count. Also if you're chasing someone and there's a squad of people behind you resetting pallets then who's doing the gens?
---
Chases pretty much last longer than deep wound timer
---
...I’ll be honest, I genuinely don’t understand what is so similar between Yui and Feng.  They don’t look similar, their stories and cosmetics are super different, I just don’t really get it.  Is it really all just down to “they’re both Asian”?
---
I’m not even trying to start anything, just confused.  Yui seems to have a lot more in common with Kate and Nea than Feng...
---
He's easier to use but not necessarily better. Billy is still going to have better mobility overall but Oni is less countered by strong tiles as you can more or less 180 with his one shot when it's up, and hit through windows fairly easily.
---
Hopefully this changes when dedicated servers come to console
---
1. Sometimes tunneling is the only option
---
2. Sometimes it literally isn’t even tunneling
---
3. That isn’t the point of my statement, I just don’t want it to be meta, it can stay an anti tunnel perk, idc, but I don’t want to see 2-4 players running it every single game, I want something fresh, the perk has been meta for 3 years now, it’s stale and boring.
---
That's the point, the cd is longer at tier III (12s) than at tier I (8s)
---
I’m talking about survivors with actual brains in the game. Survivors who CAN do ruin and CAN loop. They obviously have the upper hand . It’s all about time in this game and ruin gets demolished within a minute when you’re playing with a good team. Even if there is ruin you can power through it if you have enough experience
---
Why would you dc? Thats sounds pretty toxic.
---
bruh I literally just explained it could be a result of the lighting and possible lighting over-exaggeration.
---
Yeah but the two things used to slow down the killer, pallets and windows, were useless against the legion in feral frenzy. Since he could do damage to your deep wound bar in feral frenzy before, it felt like there was no counterplay for the survivors while playing the legion before was very low skill which made it feel even worse. When you go down as a survivor you want to feel outplayed, like there was something you could have done but failed. Against old Legion it just felt like you couldn't do much in a chase.
---
Care to elaborate on that
---
Loop for another 60 seconds and you'll get 3 pops. Normal gen time is 80 seconds, with ruin hex checks it's about 120.
---
Yea Same. I like playing Ghostface, Myers, and Demogorgan. I get the most toxic messages after ghost face games and I really didnt know why until this thread lol. I have no crazy love for 4ks though so I dont think I'm very toxic. 8/10 times I give the last survivor hatch. If I get heavily outplayed by a single survivor and the gates get powered I chase that fucker down, knock him, and carry him to the exit gate. I play both roles a lot so I really just cant understand why being outplayed as a killer equals facecamp. I got mad respect for gokd survivors.
---
Everyone should have BBQ. I would have gone crazy if I didn´t have it on every killer I usually play. It helps so incredibly much, this game is a huge grind and even with BBQ I still have tons of stuff to grind for. Getting 60+ thousand BPs for a match is so much better.
---
And the aura reading is also really good, it allows me to leave the hook and instantly go somewhere else, which is really great for survivors too because it means less camping/tunelling and easier safe saves. Sure in higher ranks people can play against it well, but it still gets value every game.
---
Buy it, you will not regret it. Might wanna wait for the next sale and you will get the DLC for less than a cheeseburger.
---
if behavior is gonna make perk tiers worthless, like they already do on a lot of perks, can we just remove them? make the grind less grindy.
---
^ yeah that
---
It just makes for really unfun gameplay because there isn’t any counterplay and because the killer can get you downed in half a minute with no skill at all it makes even playing it as killer boring asf, it’s unhealthy for the game and needs to seek changes.
---
Hey buddy. We made a more balanced revision below. So there's that. It wouldnt be a big deal if you had to get 2 pallet stuns to rebuild it. If they want to waste a ton of time trying to get the stuns then run back to the shack then let them.
---
You didn’t even spell it right. It’s ahegao
---
DON'T FORGET FUCKING UPSIDE DOWN
---
UNLESS THEY NERF NEMESIS LEGION IS GOING BACK TO ORIGINAL STRENGTH.
---
Thanks for your great response. So you would have to go through each perk and check basically?
---
It's either Purgation or Macmillan Estate, which is SUPER BAD FOR ME because my perception of different hues of cool/blue tones is terrible; I can't hunt there no matter what I do and I waste too much time glancing around with stalk to *hope* I can see someone in white being stalked in my line of sight, because otherwise a steathly survivor on Macmillan can evade me the whole game!!!!
---
Cheers mate
---
AT LEAST WE CAN JOKE AND SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE UPSIDE DOWN AND THE DEMOGORGON WHEN PEOPLE DO THAT
---
best advice right here. Survivors expecting to survive and killers expecting to 4k every match leads to a lot of disappointment.
---
Yeah there's gonna be a new rift and tome at the end of this current rift :) tome challenges are gonna stay but the rift is one time only exclusive cosmetics for the season.
---
Lol really?
---
**WHY IS THE FUCKING ONI’S TERROR RADIUS NON-EXISTENT?????**
---
I haven't tested anything, but can anyone confirm if you bleed more or something?
---
IF YOU RUN DECISIVE STRIKE OR A INSTA HEAL YOU'RE A INSECURE LITTLE BITCH THAT CAN'T DEAL WITH FUCKING UP AND GETTING CAUGHT BY THE KILLER
---
Excuse me wtf??? What the fuck is that beast of prey is gonna make him op and this perk omg 😔😔😔
---
where did clown touch you
---
Please don't get me wrong. I'm not flaming or upset at how I've personally been playing win or lose. I'm upset at the way the game is encouraging me to win or lose. Survivor and killer. I don't want to feel like any perk is a necessity to doing well. DS, BL, Ruin, Thana/sloppy, enduring/spirit, adrenaline. At my rank any deviation from those perks is more or less an assured unpleasurable experience.  I don't want to be any better at the game, I want the game to be better in general.
---
if you go to the wiki page for perks and just search for the word "Obsession" (you can do this by hitting Ctrl+F on PC or in the top right page options on mobile) then you'll find em all pretty fast.
---
looks like christmas comes early this year
---
If it's your last one keep it active because eventually you might get a nice killer who lets you do it, I got it thanks to a demogorgon who decided to stay very still until I got my blinds while farming at the end of the match. Good luck!
---
PLAY PRAYER BEADS SPIRIT AND WATCH ALL THE DISCONNECT ICONS AFTER YOU PULL THEN OFF YOUR RUIN TOTEM WITHIN THE FIRST MINUTE. IT MAKES MY DICK HARD EVERY TIME.
---
For some reason I thought it was the other way around. Yeah that's still dumb lol.
---
I AGREE #DWIGHTGANG
---
didn't he just post a video of her on twitter last week?
---
Micheal: "You dare to try vibe check me!"
---
Even with perks I feel the game should feel like a game of cat and mouse. You aren’t really supposed to follow the cat around or chase them down, but rather run and hide, or evade the cat long enough to rescue someone who failed to do that or to give others enough time to open a hole in the wall to escape through. It’s how I play and whenever I play the mouse running from a cat, I get away, while if I play the monkey flinging feces at a Lion, I get decked.
---
Probably because everything is dark as fuck, and shrouded in dark Entity musk, which is really a fault on the shoulders of the art directors moreso than the artists themselves, bruh
---
you can stalk ur obsession at their homes and if possible try to collect their toenail clippings for your altar to them
---
So I saw a stream of his for the first time the other day...
---
Is he... a little slow or something? The way he talks about things, I don’t know. He was also saying that everything about spirit from top to bottom got completely nerfed and she’s now in the bottom 3 of killers....
---
[FUCKY FUCK](/intensifies)
---
The only worthy reason to get banned from DBD.
---
this is legit! very good execution and the picture really captured the essence of legion.
---
Does Lithe need a nerf or no? Genuine question as I enjoy that perk.
---
IMAGINE BEING SO BAD AT SKILLCHECKS THAT YOU ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT RUIN ON REDDIT.
---
How, though? If someone doesn't want to get unhooked, so be it, their choice. If the killer isn't around, you just leave and go about the business. If the killer is around, the button is working as intended. If a player wants to grief and throw the match, they already have much better ways of doing so.
---
Dammit you beat me
---
I AM NEW TO THE GAME SO I’M STILL PRACTICING CUT A LOW ELO PLAYER SOME SLACK
---
I'm constantly surprised by the lack of guro there. I'm not into that but you'd think dbd would be prime feeding ground for it.
---
My bad. Since the nerf I do believe it is. 30 seconds on a healthy survivor. 20 on an injured. -5 with add on. And Mixtape is -3 a hit.

RANK RESET IS FUCKING DUMB I HAVE 200+ HOURS IN DBD I SHOULDNT GET PUT AGAINST BRAND NEW SURVIVORS/KILLERS JUST BECAUSE I TOOK A BREAK FROM THE GAME
---
Aren't I I supposed to have tusks as well?
---
Right except Xeno won’t be a killer most likely especially with them getting their own game as well and especially not anytime soon
---
he talks in a way that you can tell you wont change his mind and as a result his chat becomes an echochamber of ppl who loves his "savagery." same thing with pug's chat, although pug's is less about game balance
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Thanks now their ears are red and sore
---
The survivors still need to stun him right? What's stopping them from just dropping the pallet early instead of going for the stun?
---
I hope not. It's still a neat perk. I'd rather they rework Deep Wounds again so you can't abuse this, because this is twice the fucky deep wounds timer is making him unfun and a little op to go against, and at this point the issue is deep wounds.
---
I can personally admit that when I play shitty/toxic games with SWF Survivors, I **immediately** re-lobby as Nurse/Spirit with a Mori and meta Perks. Fuck that.
---
Survivors would have more fun if they actually just played the game normally. I don’t care that you know how to Loop, and I don’t care that you Pallet stunned me. It’s part of the game. Teabagging me and dancing after every pallet drop, only to tell me to kill myself or uninstall after I camp you to death is not okay.
---
Sometimes I just want to play Killer to test some new things out, or to try and have a casual match. If a Survivor is more skilled than me, cool, whatever. Enjoy your Escape Points. There’s just literally no reason to be cocky about it and insult me post-game for it.
---
I can't wait to try out the Oni! I'm really thinking I need to start building a good PC so I can get in on the PTB.
---
I feel you broo
---
Give me that thing... your dark vibe
---
If I decide to DC due to Hex's being cleansed, It's because my non-ruin was cleansed withing the first 30 seconds. 
---
Reason is if I bring a non-ruin my goal is to use that perk at least a little in that game.
---
That would be sick.
---
But then Freddy knows you are dropping pallets.
---
Have you tried .... not stunning them?
---
INSTA HEAL ISN'T A THING ANYMORE AND DECISIVE STRIKE IS USEFUL IF INSECURE LITTLE BITCH KILLERS TRY TO TUNNEL YOU
---
YES! That’s exactly what I was saying, I’m wanting the meta to shift so badly its stupid, the devs are snails when it comes to optimising their game, I took a 7 month break from the game Nov last year - June this year and all that really changed was the EGC, DS “nerf,” a new chapter I didn’t care about and DS 2.0 was added.
---
I’m dying to seek change and not have to rely on the same perks over and over again but the devs being themselves, we clearly won’t see this changes til the year 2030.
---
Perks that have been meta since release:
---
Ruin, BBQ, BT, DS, Enduring, Nurses, Iron Will.
---
Perks that have left the meta:
---
Sprint Burst, Self-Care... literally it!
---
It’s a real shame, it’s so easy to buff certain perks like:
---
Spies, MoM, Solidarity, Autodidact, Fire up. 
---
It’s a real shame
---
Perks: 
---
The Perfect Sear
---
Move It, Grandpa
---
Eff Off
---
You absolute mad lads
---
Ah, okay. Good to know.
---
Perk: give me your jacket
---
When a survivor fails a skill check repairing generators their aura is revealed for 5 seconds
---
but no one will because why would you use a perk that you only get use out of against killers too stupid to break valuable pallets?
---
Exactly. The doors are usually in the killer's favor. This wouldn't help the tunneling situation against key users though.
---
I didn't like it at first because I always prefer going in as blind as possible so that the game is as mysterious and surprising as possible. Though I think it did eventually help set up survivor's expectations for relative competence
---
That being said, I won't lose sleep when it's gone. I think it's more interesting for survivors to be forced to deal with the unknown in the fog rather than pre-emptively dole out roles and expectations beforehand
---
WELL THEN DONT BLAME THE KILLER FOR USING A META PERK. DO YOU BLAME THE 12/0 JUNGLER ON THE ENEMY TEAM FOR PLAYING KHAZIX IF YOU'RE CONSTANTLY OVEREXTENDED IN TOP LANE ON TEEMO?
---
Don’t know if you’re away but a lot of Killers on PS4 DC by force closing the Application instead of using the in game Leave Match option and they do it to be spiteful. 
---
If they force close the app the game cannot properly detect what happened as the Killer is host and so the game crashes for the Survivors and puts them back to the main menu with an error message. You lose items, offerings, any BP you got, your time and sometimes you de-pip.
---
That makes sense. Hag was doing well in the beginning tho. She already had two people hooked in the first few minutes. She just dc’d when her hexes were gone. Kind of upsetting nonetheless
---
...same.... BEHAVIOUR!?
---
r/Whooosh
---
Yeah but still sucks to do 5 or 4 Gens with 3 pple tho \^\^ just imagine Killer having tana, dying light and Ruin (still active) pain in the ass \^\^
---
You know, I would like that as a sort of joke skin for him. It probably is just me but imagining me running around with a giant glowing head while trying be sneaky seems like a kind of fun challenge.
---
WHY IS IT THAT WHEN IM TRYING TO DEPLETE 6 MEDKITS, I GET INTO A NON STOP CHASE FOR 5 GENS AGAINST A TUNNELLING NURSE AND DIE? SHE LITERALLY REFUSED TO HIT ANYONE EVEN WHEN THEY TRIED TO BODYBLOCK FOR ME. THEN IN POST GAME CHAT, THEY WERE TRYING TO ACT ALL NICE. LIKE, NO BITCH. FUCK OFF. DONT SAY GG AFTER YOU TUNNELLED ME FOR 5 GENS.
---
Peoples attitudes are like buttholes. Everyone has one, but some of them stink.
---
Yeah most of the time both doors can be seen from one spot for killers, and most of the time a key bringer gets Franklin's demise
---
Okay but maybe- and just try to wrap your head around this - maybe people don't care if you live or die? Maybe they don't want to be the bait so you can squeeze out that extra gen? Is it dickish? Yeah, but is it fucking illegal? No. Get over yourself. Stop blaming your loss on someone who dc's when there are PLENTY OF OPTIONS TO STILL ESCAPE. nExT eXcUsE mY dUde.
---
The irony is that Feng Min is so competitive she's probably already beginning to study motorcycle engines
---
Or better yet she invites Yui to an arcade racing game and absolutely smokes her
---
Yep, in the PTB, Beast of Prey applies the Undetectable status effect.  No red stain, no terror radius, and a hidden aura.
---
Aren't there two seperate kinds of Oni, the Red and the Blue?
---
It's exactly what Legion did before his rework and people did nothing but complain about.
---
Which was completely justified.
---
He was spectating
---
Imagine if you put spirit fury and enduring with nemesis and rancor.
---
Nah lithe is perfect how it is. In fact after the balanced nerf comes through they'll all be perfect.
---
Let's me honest. They only two killers who have pizazz while vaulting are Michael and Demogorgon.
---
Michael fucking power steps that shit like a badass, and Demo crawls through like you'd expect a quadruped to do. It's pretty awesome.
---
THE SCREENSHOTS I TAKE AREN’T SHOWING UP AFTER I QUIT THE GAME ANYMORE AND I DON’T KNOW HOW TO FIX IT
---
You don’t NEED 3 gen strats as a rookie, dude. You also don’t need to not camp when all gens are done. 1/4 kills is a loss, 2/4 kills is a tie, and 3/4 and 4/4 kills is a win. If you already lost, at least take some points with you by making sure the one fish you caught doesn’t get away.
---
2k hours- I get to complain, and you can all suck my ass. EVERYONE knows how bad the state of the game is in. It's a fucking joke trying to take it serious.
---
If we ever get the legion skin with her actual face and no mask, then it would actually be a horror game because she looks like my ex gf
---
Aw man, now the Oni has to fight Noble 6 for my time on December 3rd
---
You'll go back to survivor, once you'll get past purple ranks..putting the balance on the side, it's just not fun at all
---
Funnily enough I just finished writing this.

Wait can killers force you to dc on PS4? Cause I have no internet issues but two games I’ve played today I’ve been fully kicked from dbd back to the menu screen saying internet error, I’ve never had internet trouble before and the internet is working fine on my phone
---
Your best bet is to do it when they are breaking a pallet. Check out OhTofu on YouTube, he has a really good flashlight guide that helped me a lot.
---
That the game has been the same for a long time. Survivors have been using the same perks same goes with killers but even then the game itself is repetitive.
---
You seriously don’t get the reference? It’s linked to the left image with the teabagging Jake, pointing Meg, and “come here” gesture claud
---
Demogorgon crawls like a quadruped would, and it's pretty dope. Simple, and flavorful.
---
Nice clip of Montos video.
---
That's what I'm saying. Repairing safe pallets after they're kicked would make coordinated Survivors outrageously difficult to kill, especially if it is god pallet.
---
My best guess to balance it for such a situation is that the pallet must be repaired within a certain time frame. 30 seconds or more I suppose.
---
Same.
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Restart the app and disable media overlay. If your game runs for too long the frame rate tanks after about an hour.
---
if everyone in the lobby had it maybe
---
An angry 12 year old who just got his first call of duty on his Xbox 360 sounds good.
---
Lmao I laughed at this way harder than I should've
---
I tested it last night and it takes AGES to do it with Beast of Prey, especially if you aren't running the purple addons. I think Beast of Prey Legion is more a niche gimmick build than an actual viable playstyle. However nemesis... nemesis has potential.
---
I’m in love with the new perk. I had a lot of fun with the PTB last night. I think BHVR has another well done chapter on their hands 👏🙌
---
Because some survivors would rather DC than adapt to the situation. Same people are the ones crying about killers being op, they’re not op they just force the survivors to play differently.
---
Media overlay? What is that?
---
Yeah that’s what I’m saying, I want change in the meta, the devs are going at snail pace rn so fuck me ig :’)
---
# holy fuck that’s the most brutal Mori I’ve seen so far.
---
For screenshots and video
---
Alright
---
When you just did a clutch save on the survivor the killer is chasing to the gate, and he suddenly turns around and kills you.
---
Console is in severe need of an optimization patch. I’m not familiar with PS4, can you choose whether to keep the game’s data on internal or hard drive? If so, keep all of your data for DBD on the console itself. Halloween skins and Halloween items for killers also cause lag/frame drops. Best of luck, I’m sure they’ll give us an optimization patch within the next decade or so
---
the game if survivors friendly
---
if u get good survivors its game over
---
if 1 or 2 of them know the map well know where the pallets are and they are good in juking etc are all over
---
if u get 1 kill u would be lucky
---
The game is just poorly optimized and it seems the way loading screens work, prior games stack onto one another and drop frame rate
---
I'm sorry. Explain that again? I don't understand how multiple hits will reduce the timer.
---
I reckon 2 protection hits after they fix protection hits and it’ll be fine.
---
And I see where you’re coming from with Spies but it ain’t S tier, not even C tier!
---
I want it buffed like crazy so we can see something different, increase it’s effective range, make it reveal auras instead, that sort of thing.
---
Hell yes! I think the Nurse has an appropriately eerie float and I also think the Hag's enthusiastic little hop makes her creepy and sinister. Like you know that little wendigo has a taste for liver
---
You’re gonna love the next update then
---
Honestly as a killer I'm always over here like "man fuck SWF it's so fucking bullshit with their comms and bodyblocking hooks and coordination OH GOD 4 GENS POPPED WHILE I  WAS RANTING TIME TO TUNNEL". 
---
Then with Survivor I'm always like "I only play with my friends on discord calls and yes I climb the ranks OH GOD ITS SPIRIT".
---
Maybe BHVR can do a complete Legion rework to counter this rather than nerf this perk.
---
wishful thinking though.
---
Yes. The horns and tusks are in the mask.
---
Implying people wouldn't abuse this even if he was a strong killer by itself?
---
All the perks suck. The worst one on each side in my opinion are the raising pallet one and the Windows of Opportunity for killer.
---
This would kind of take away from looping the legion, you either take a hit, waste a pallet,  or stun him and you're screwed
---
idk where this idea that a DC = toxic came from, that’s not what community toxicity is.
---
Just don’t use this BS combo, you’re making legion stronger yes but you’re also making the game less fun for everyone including yourself, I don’t know why people are defending this.
---
Yeah fuck a trash tier killer getting any help.
---
Of course, but u can’t deny that some killers don’t really break pallets unless it’s a strong loop, to put them back on is a pretty good use of a perk slot depending on the situation
---
Lithe sprint burst dead hard balances landing
---
How is this balanced? If you stun legion with this perk he can literally use his power and down you no matter what. 
---
It doesn’t make him OP,  but makes him extremely unfun to play against which is why he was changed in the first place.
---
The pallet waste approach is fine counterplay I’m sure but the killer has tools to force this perk to activate...
---
Dude yeah that would be cool. Using tomahawks or like a hunting spear. His Mori could incorporate scalping.
---
Thanks man:)
---
Preach
---
I was thinking of Biker kate cause of the outfit, but definetly default Kate for the head
---
Only counterplay I can think of is to bring a flashlight. I think that can burn the traps? Either way, pretty fucked up how she can camp a hook from miles away.
---
I mean using pallets like that doesn't really give you anything, it doesnt take a lot of time to walk around short loops, and on long loops they will just break it to avoid having to deal with it in the future.
---
Dude play how you want im just giving advice, i hardly ever get these issues anyway so i dont know any good low rank strats. If you're so keen on camping and using bloodpoints as an excuse have at it, just know with bbq you can still get well over 10-15k bloodpoints without a single sacrifice as long as you get a couple hooks.
---
Well I have the Pro which is only about 3 years old. But the game is still poorly optimized.
---
I had to look up furtive chase to remember what it does, and this would definitely force nemesis
---
What is the hemorrhage status effect
---
Pop got reworked to be S Tier. Discordance, Corrupt Intervention, Infectious Fright and Spirit Fury were S-A tier perks added in recent DLC. Survivors got MoM which got nerfed in a month and reworked DS.
---
Don't Pallet stun? Just use the pallets to make distance instead of stopping infront of it and doing musical chairs till the killer desides fuck it?
---
I still don't know what they did to legion
---
This would kind of take away half of the resources you actually have to counter killers. I don't want to waste pallets, but I don't want to fucking die ny the deep wound. What should I do? Disconnect? You, as a survivor is screwed both sides. That's fun to you?
---
We got Bill as a survivor. We need Pyro as a killer.
---
Lol spoiled Survivor mains are never happy.
---
Step aside finger fetishists, there's a new trophy in town!
---
What is the other effect of the perk again?
---
And what's he gonna do about it? You'll just pick it back up.
---
Pallet Flip perk is useless. Flip Flop is worse than Unbreakable. Second Wind sucks.
---
I think it balances out, since it takes up a perk slot.
---
NERFING LEGION ARE YOU KIDDING?! THEY WERE ALREADY LESS THAN GARBAGE, WHY MAKE IT WORSE?!
---
If the perk activates once in the game and you capitalise on it with feral frenzy then congrats, you’ve taken the fun out of that chase, Furtive chase can be activated 8 times in a game, DS will also activate it, a bit minor since the survivor is already injured but easy to rely on if you’re feeling lazy.
---
I don’t know why tf people are defending this when they were completely against old legion -_-
---
You bleed badly
---
Shhh don't spoil the secrets before we've had a chance to use them
---
Because "crybaby survivors nerfed all the optimal killers"
---
This is better than having a useless Killer. It balances out, since it hogs a perk slot.
---
Why are you so mad that nobody gets your dumb reference dude. Calm down.
---
You even DM’d me to explain it lmaoooo
---
I'm trying to get through Death Stranding Behaviour! Delay the Oni please!!
---
Clean bruh moment
---
I didn't ask for a nerf tho, what I was arguing against is the idea that it's better to release a killer too strong than too weak.
---
Specifically 1 victim during endgame camping.
---
I was looking yesterday and found this YouTube video https://youtu.be/p0qIyZ7IEy8 at 11:32
---
You can miss me with that "survivors don't like to adapt" bullshit. When killers start adapting instead of bitching so will I.
---
Tysm &lt;3
---
I’ve said it before, I’ll say it again. Deep Wounds is the fundamental problem, instead of it being a mandatory timer, it ought to be an inconvenient status effect—blindness, inability to do gens, broken status, inability to heal others, your pick. Once they change what that does, Legion can be a killer that gets buffs based on the number of survivors in Deep Wound state. I have no idea why this is such a mystery for the developers, but I’m confident they’ll implement this change soon enough.
---
Yo it isnt exactly the weeping Angel's but it's pretty similar in the new map.
---
If you look away and look back at the statues in the new map they will always be looking at you and will track your movement when looking away, it's pretty cool
---
??? Due to tile locations and pallet RNG I think 60 seconds is about the best you can ask for as a teammate before them getting downed. Any more than that is gravy. Looping for 120 seconds though...come on lmao, you'll use up every safe pallet in the game and that's if they were all within a reasonable distance lmao.
---
Haha, that's really funny. Who uses Lightweight in 2019?
---
Course I did because it’s a good video and it disappoints me knowing not one of you mongrels knew it. Oh you big goofs! You big ol’ not beautiful people!
---
Being able to down in two hits of feral frenzy is toxic. I'm a killer main, but this new mechanic is literally game breaking.
---
Maybe because people are tired of having their teammates DC when they encounter a killer with a perk that is “op”. DC-ing is basically throwing the game.
---
Make him good
---
Beasts of Prey is changed on PTB. Now when you gain Blood Lust one, instead of just losing your red stain, you gain the undetectable status, which makes you lose TR. and if you have no TR then they bleed out
---
If you stay one moment between them you will also hear a tribal music
---
How on earth are you going to defend Legion “soft chasing” a survivor in deep wound until their timer eventually ticks down? Thats actually hilarious that you think its ok in the slightest.
---
People may just be blinded by how this’ll make legion really strong, I’m sure while they’re out there 4K-ing as Legion they’ll be coming back to the reddit talking about how “toxic” survivors are complaining about anti-fun mechanics. :p
---
Shugoki is branching out from just FH
---
power: explosion
---
but the plane seems to get lost, now im here alone with a lot of fog.
---
After such a long wait! Finally!
---
You are implying that the perk is “op” even though you never outwardly said that. Also, sometimes you just shit outta luck when it come to chases. Thats just how it is sometimes. You aren’t always going to have the advantage in this game, you should know that by now.
---
Get a hobby
---
I really liked it as I could better prepare for the match. I think they should keep it.
---
It would have been the ultimate troll if they couldn’t. Survivor drops the pallet, stuns the killer, picks it up and stuns them again while the killer is helpless to stop it.
---
:)
---
For me, it's actually the opposite. If I play a few games as a survivor where the killer tunnels me down and facecamps me, I queue up as Huntress, throw up an ebony Mori and iridescent heads, and blow off some steam.
---
Yeah we really should use asylum building as an example for dealing with the character on normal maps. It's like saying to just play Nurse to deal with haddonfield.
---
&gt;Stranger things have rooms where you can bait and outplay the killer.
---
Aka all of the pallets are unsafe and the killer just needs to go back and forth to get a hit. If you don't get a pallet stun on those loops, you are getting hit.
---
IF INSTA HEALS AND BALANCED LANDING ARE NERFED BECAUSE THEY’RE “IMBALANCED” ADD-ONS LIKE JUDITH’S TOMBSTONE AND FRAGRANT TUFT OF HAIR SHOULD BE NERFED TOO. 4 MORIS IN ONE TRIAL WITH NO HOOKED OR DOWNED SURVIVORS?? HOW IS THAT BALANCED??
---
But a high rank killer *should* break every pallet. It's not worth having them up.
---
This is genuinely hilarious. Thanks for creating it
---
I love the one that resets pallets, but I rarely encounter killers that don’t break them right away. I’ll probably still end up using it, though. Also, the one that makes wiggling faster sounds very promising for endgame plays, especially since I’m altruistic.
---
&gt;what the michaels two obsession perks do?
---
3 and how about reading them?
---
I was excited for Nemesis synergy with Furtive Chase because Furtive can do a lot of cool stuff but nope. They don't work together. It sucks because i want to see more use for interesting non meta perks and builds but i doubt that will happen soon. Too many perks are not getting touched and remain too weak. Niche is good but what is the point if it means crippling yourself?
---
Right now I am thinking the pallet perk would be nice with quick and quiet, adrenaline, and maybe sprint burst? For me personally I really like getting the objective done and of course any additional help in a chase is awesome. Quick and Quiet has helped me a lot to avoid the killer or simply lose him. The pallet perks can come in clutch to help out friends in a chase by resetting the pallets and even going back to pallets I have dropped later to set them back up for myself and others. Adrenaline has just saved my butt a bunch lol. Sprint burst has helped me get to certain locations faster or allowed me to piss the killer off so they give up. Thats only one build I have in mind but I cant wait to explore more with the PTB tonight
---
It literally says "New SAW Collection" under both outfit names.
---
It's funny cause I'm a shugoki main so this is an absolute win for me.
---
I think I'm like Rep 24 with him or something
---
Dedicated servers was supposed to be done in summer. Halloween event and patch supposed to be released November 22th. It is only latest 2. We better just wait.
---
run around the map to hug a clock and then invisible freddy comes out of no where with no directional lullaby and gets an easy first hit on you :(
---
Except several maps have infinite or near infinite loops. And again you don't have to stun them.
---
No. You literally can run up on the top of the rafters and bait the killer towards you and jump down. Or dance with the killer there.
---
The thing about it is when there is even 1 toxic/mean Survivor it somehow makes the other 3 more likely to catch on the behaviour and do the same thing, feeling like they can get away with it/if others do it so can I. Especially if it’s a SWF. On a side note, man, does it feel nice to be acknowledged in such a way. Playing Killer can get so stressful and upsetting.
---
Ublock origin brother
---
Needs a purple toolbox with max add ons
---
Dude... I wasn’t saying it was OP or implying it, no one thought legion was OP when they came out yet they were still unbearably unfun to go against. Running until you go down isn’t being shit out of luck, it isn’t luck, it’s called getting outplayed by an anti fun mechanic
---
I actually really like that point of view.
---
This sounds less like an argument being made against the perk and more of an argument being made about pallets in general.
---
You experience this in game now, as it stands, dealing with pallets and pallet stuns, as well as the distance survivors gain by dropping pallets. 
---
The new perk doesn't change this at all, and there are a few killer perks that deal with pallets (Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, etc).
---
Yes, I'm sure there will be a few pallets picked up by survivors not in the chase, but I highly doubt this will be a considerable amount or detrimental to the game.
---
Otherwise, the nature of the game and chases goes unchanged by this perk.
---
Spirit Fury, Corrupt, Infectious, Thrilling Tremors and Discordance are all better perks than Second Wind. Demogorgon is the only one who got completely shafted on perks
---
the killer meta has not changed at all, the survivor meta maybe ever so slightly (selfcare is not viable at all, spend entire match injuried more or so).  Other than that, everyone is still running the same perks for the past 2 years.
---
NOW I REALIZE HOW ANNOYING IT IS BEING UNHOOKED ONLY TO BE TUNNELED AND DOWNED RIGHT AFTER. FELLOW SURIVORS, PLZ BE MORE OBSERVANT AND STOP FARMING MY SAD ASS
---
This was my biggest worry. Survivors already have 20 toolbox perks that fit into any map. This alone makes the primary problem of looping(God loops) that much worse. Because now instead of baiting out pallet drops and going for predictions, you have to just eat it immediately or risk another God loop. On farm maps and suffocation pit, this can literally destroy some killers.
---
Assuming that leaves PTB, which it most likely won't. Or they will change it to include chases to not count down the timer.
---
BIG BOY SEASON
---
AND PLAGUE. At least they CAN heal vs legion, it's either cleanse or eat some exhaustion.
---
They're talking about the **start of the game** . Oni's power recharges so slowly without blood orbs, so theoretically the Oni could be looped like 2-3 gens before he gets to use his power. But only on the condition that **no one gets hit** in the early game.
---
Half up ponytail (hallowed catalyst event) + hiking jacket (grey store item) + probably dirty jeans (purple store item)
---
It's probably Korean not Japanese.
---
Also, he can break pallets with his m1 damn near immediately. Billy has to fully charge the saw to do it.
---
Fun..
---
Plus once it hits official, you have to slot in enduring/fury, or brutal.
---
I think you misread, maybe? The perk activates and picks a new obsession when they blind/stun you. It doesn't activate just because a new obsession is chosen.
---
True, but sometimes thats just something you have to live with as killer.
---
Ngl it's a nasty combo, but it's not the killer's job to make the game fun for survivors. Survivors sure as hell never miss an opportunity to BM killers.
---
For the love of god don't take your time to send a toxic message. It hurts
---
&gt; Niche is good but what is the point if it means crippling yourself?
---
took the words out of my mouth
---
No way, the advantages it holds over billy's power atm make it more powerful over all, the buildup isn't enough to offset that.
---
Yeah some people have tested it, doesn’t work with fc. if that’s unintentional, I think they should keep it anyway. 
---
And it definitely takes away a lot of options if the perk actually activates. At that point, your best bet is to lose the killer as fast as possible so you can mend. If the legion is running nemesis, it’s probably best that the obsession just stays in their face for most the game and acts as the decoy while everyone else does gens.
---
Anyway, good luck out there in the fog!
---
Yo clarify, I’m not trying to claim this is balanced, but you might be overstating it a bit.
---
What it does is guarantee your chase won’t last forever.  Either A) you go down to deep wound or B) you successfully nuke him in the chase and are able to Mend.

What it does is guarantee the chase is over one way or another.  What it does is prevent a survivor from looping Legion for 2 minutes straight: they *have* to lose him or go down.  But it doesn’t necessarily mean you will ALWAYS go down, it just changes your goal from “waste his time with a super-long chase” to “end the chase by juking him for long enough to mend.”

Well I appreciate the response. I guess I’ll see when I play him, but I still feel disappointed that he seems like a variant of billy.
---
WORK ON THE GENS ANYWAY I MEAN TF
---
Don't forget demogorgon's leap
---
This makes me think of the whole spirit situation where everyone is going to ignore plague for a few months from now and all of a sudden just jump on a hate train
---
Uncommeon enough that I think it will be meme tier at best
---
Make sure to watch his Mori.
---
You're right about the counter play. I tested beast of prey legion at length and lemme tell you, there's no reason to worry. If takes a full minute from the frenzy stab before you actually fall while the killer is doing nothing but following you around. Remember if the legion breaks chase, kicks a pallet, or attacks anyone during this time, it will reset the bloodlust. If a legion actually commits to Beast of Prey you to death (without the purple addons), they are 100% throwing the game.
---
Youre welcome, steward!
---
Sorry here's the fact case and point the day after rank reset is a rank 1 survivor suddenly trash at the game? No, cause rank isn't a true representation of a players skill. It is better representing the grind a person does that season after the reset. I've seen rank 1 survivors do meme builds and drop the shack pallet 10 seconds in and rank 20s dead hard borrowed time me through NOED so it doesn't matter what you 'think' it is what it is.
---
I did, but I think he was referring to the Tank, since Oni is huge and his charge is closer to the Tank’s backhand than it is to the Charger’s grab and pummel.
---
Nah bro that’s too much work, who even reads anymore
---
It doesn’t.
---
If you are out played, you were outplayed. Get over it. Sometimes you don’t win.
---
You didn't need to. It didn't need a response. I was just enjoying a tall person joke... But that's earned a few 👎 so what do I know?
---
*Yes*
---
Dying Light makes it that when your obsession dies there's a speed penalty applied to all survivors. Save the best for Last is where each time you chase your obsession and let them get away, you get tokens that increase your movement speed, though hitting the obsession makes you lose a token. 
---
A good perk combo would be Nurse's Calling+Monitor and Abuse.
---
I feel you brother.
---
How very generous.
---
Then it would almost exclusively be useful to coordinated survivors in groups though
---
NANI???!!!
---
Surge, thrilling tremors, surveillance, corrupt intervention.
---
That’s what I’m thinking. I feel like the wiggle perk could seriously be a game changer ngl
---
so he wouldnt even read the explanation, hmmm....
---
Nice flowchart.
---
I mean, they could just make deep wound remove oblivious, and make Oblivious unobtainable with deep wound. It'd get around borrowed time and Freddy.
---
Exactly what I’m complaining about, the game has become hella stale for a reason
---
I'm not 100% sure of stridor affects breathing and footsteps, but a decent headset can help offset iron will by hearing steps.
---
Holy shit, you're allowed to not like their drawing, but you don't need to attack them for being a furry.
---
They won't be useful at the same time, but if you can't use one the other is online.
---
EVERY SINGLE TIME I GET IN A MATCH I ALWAYS GET SPOTTED FIRST BUT THATS FINE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW TO RUN THE KILLER AROUND.  THE PROBLEM IS THAT THREE MINUTES LATER THEY STILL HAVENT DONE ANY GENS AND WHEN I GET HOOKED I SEE THEM ALL CROUCHED SOMEWHERE RANDOM AND WHEN THEY COME TO UNHOOK ME ONE OF THEM ALWAYS GETS DOWNED, AND THEY START THIS ENDLESS LOOP OF UNSAFELY HOOKING EACH OTHER WITHOUT DS OR BORROWED TIME AND I GET LIKE ONE GENERATOR DONE BEFORE THEY ALL DIE
---
Knowing Behaviour's track record with Legion, expect the worst.
---
Lower..........a little lower..
---
If the survivor drops a pallet and immediately leaves the loop without even attempting to mindgame it, I'm not losing them just to break the pallet.
---
But there's something better that doesn't require a stun.
---
You can do it without addons and it's still a 30 second chase you cant win as survivor. I think its strong, but definitely not broken. There is counter play (drop pallets early, avoid being stabbed) but it will be annoying. Honestly, I think its fine without the addons. With the addons tho... its rough.
---
You should try quick and quiet with lithe if you’re into that

---
&gt;He has to actually INJURE a survivor to even START charging his ability 
---
Yeah the impossible task of getting a hit on a survivor. One hit gives you half of your power btw. 
---
&gt;And he suffers a stun if he hits a wall when attacking with his ability
---
Who's talking about the attack? I'm refering to the charge itself. When you are zooming you don't collide and bump into walls, you can run into the wall and casually slide off of it.
---
&gt;and he slows down (and mostly looks at the floor for the duration of the slow, sorta like nurse) when it ends for a bit
---
This is not what I am talking about. I am talking about finishing his charge. You can go through half of the map, stop the charge and regain complete control in like .2 of a second.
---
&gt;And keep in mind, you still need a straight path to the survivor
---
https://www.twitch.tv/zubatlel/clip/UninterestedLittleQueleaRedCoat?filter=clips&amp;range=7d&amp;sort=time
---
This kate was around a corner. He could easily curve around it and hit her anyway. Also this clip is an example of lack of post-charge cooldown I mentioned. Look at 0:22, he instantly stops and can attack again.
---
&gt;AND you can't cancel his power once you've activated it
---
Why would you ever want to cancel it? You can do everything you can do without it and better. This is in no way a downside. In fact it's better not to pick people up and slug with knockout, he's the best slugging character in the game.
---
&gt;And this is coming from someone who's only P3 character is Dwight Fairfield.
---
"Me being new to the game gives my argument more legitimacy, somehow"
---
I may be reading a different version of the perk before it’s been altered because I kid you not it says “Anytime a new survivor becomes the obsession they are affected by the Oblivious status effect for 60 seconds”
---
:/
---
Good idea! I will try that out! Thank you for the suggestion 😄
---
Pair it with Flip-flop and Boil Over. Toxic build.
---
Until you lose bloodlust, of course. (And all stacks of bloodlust are immediately removed when hitting a survivor)
---
Yea, too much work, don’t even know why he posted cause he can’t read any responses
---
But... it’s not fun for killers either... running to a survivor for 15 seconds until they get downed automatically isn’t fun.
---
His great great great granddaughter and the nurse will always be much better than him even with their nerfs
---
Are people really trying to justify this obviously broken shit? This stuff will not make it out of ptb
---
bruh...
---
Put it on Bubba. He preserves the tokens better than anyone else
---
Nea already did this to Trapper.
---
Overcharge, Unnerving, Distressing, and a 4th perk of your choosing. (Ruin, Dying Light, BBQ, Franklin's, Huntress Lullaby, etc.)
---
For addons usually double calm addons for a massive terror radius so you can debuff everyone with Unnerving Presence and passive insanity in treatment mode. Calm and Order (Order increases the rate of passive madness gain in the terror radius in treatment mode) is another combo.
---
For addons, usually the Jigsaw Piece as The Game is a tiny map and your terror radius covers both floors.

---
bruh.....
---
The chang eto moris we really need are the animations for older kills, because lets be honest: they did the first four killer dirty. Spirits could be a little better. Like I dont get mad if i get mori'd by a hag, ghostface, demogorgon, or plague because those are cool (with the exception of me needing to do a challenge that I haven't completed already in that trial), but if its a wraith or nurse for example I get mad only because I dont die in a cool way. Like oh wow, you scream in face. feelsgoodman
---
Oni has ridiculous tracking due to blood drops though.
---
While all Killers can follow blood on the ground, Oni is the only one who can see them from a ways away or even through walls.
---
"OK boomer"
---
You’re an absolute hero, thanks for your amazing post.
---
same tbh
---
"You wanna T bag me after you stunned me with that pallet? Oh you hear that? THe last gen popped. NOTICE ANYTHING DIFFERENT NOW?"
---
You mean the Beast of Prey combo that takes half a minute of chase to actually down someone and *does* require a stun because you get stunned when you get out of Feral Frenzy? And gets countered anytime the survivor manages to stun you with a pallet or runs to a good loop where you lose line of sight or have to break a pallet to keep it?
---
There are no infinites in this game.
---
&gt;No. You literally can run up on the top of the rafters and bait the killer towards you and jump down.
---
that's 1 room where you get to do anything. On any of the hallway pallets (which is over a half of pallets total) and all the rooms without walkways, you don't get to do that.
---
There is a easy fix for it all, other live service games do it regularly.  Take the most used perks (in DBD case) and nerf the hell out of them. 
---
Instead we get new perks that do not shake the meta at all.  I'd say adding a new game mode, but wait tiimes are so long now. Splitting the player base at all would be bad.  I am for removing ranks too, that needs to happen and soon
---
I am talking about new players. New players come into the game, see all the characters that are in the game, think about it a bit and fucking quit because mindlessly grinding in a game that is 4 years old SUCKS.  
---
There needs to be a catch up mechanic. I myself am doing fine because I play from launch, but you really are short sighted it seems. You only care about bragging on reddit how easy you have it since you can play this game for a lot more than the average person. New players are needed so that the game stays alive.
---
Geez dude it was a joke, ITS NOT GETTING OUTPLAYED, THERE IS NO FUCKING COUNTERPLAY
---
Get that in your head holy shit.
---
Sorry, I need to cool down, I’m clearly just a SuRVivOr MaiN who doesn’t know how difficult it is to play killer. -_-
---
Or we just dont feel like being toxic?
---
Oni is better and worse than Billy. Billy maintains his strength consistently, Oni has to work for it. Oni's strength is a little better though, but I'd say Billy is superior simply for the fact that his power is really similar but always on hand, at the ready whenever need be.
---
And you recover from that pallet break faster than either chainsaw user.
---
You can play how you want however....
---
Most people agree tunneling a guy off hook and camping the hook are scummy tactics. Numerous perks will punish you for tunneling so its almost never the right play. 
---
Camping once the gates are powered is generally expected, there isnt really anything else for the killer to do
---
with the current standard mode... what's the worse that happens when a survivor hops through a hatch or a killer uses a mori? the game ends, you pip/don't pip, gather your bloodpoints, and queue for the next one. it's really not that serious. BHVR should certainly try their base to make the game balanced and fair, but having these additional features to it is fun and i appreciate it.
---
if BHVR wanted to release a competitive game mode, they could do so by disabling items, offerings, add-on's, and SWF. and it would make for a more perfectly balanced game. in fact, weren't they looking into that with the vanilla testing?
---
What a stupid argument. After rank reset, everything is just shifted up. Obviously the rank 1s are going to all be at the same rank.
---
So you're telling me, that there would be absolutely no difference between 4 rank 15 survivors vs 4 rank 1 survivors?
---
That’s a surefire way to lose games, your first chase will be a lot longer, you won’t put on real pressure and you’ll eat a fat L.
---
thank you so so much !
---
Please don't spam the sub with stuff like this nobody cares one person disliked a video
---
Devs = snails, by the time they announce a massive change to something you for once give a shit about you would’ve already lost patience and started playing a new game by then -_-
---
Because people are stupid and cry for nerfs instead of trying to counterplay
---
Also his insta-down can hit multiple survivors. It hits one first then it hits anyone else in the area after a moment.
---
The first two are pretty fair.
---
You aren’t doing anything wrong, but the last one is a little mean. They have no choice for when they get unhooked so it’s a little unfair to punish them for someone else’s mistake
---
I don’t think you are understanding the point of my post at all. It forces you to kick pallets which allows survivors to straight up run away from the pallet right away instead of playing around it and waiting for killer to kick it.
---
Jeez your toxic.
---
The ultimate wiggle build. DS could also be useful here too lmao
---
Just rework deep wounds then.
---
Welcome to the hidden survivor's rules and guidelines of the game and how it's supposed to be played.
---
They all welcome you...lol
---
You're not allowed to camp. Not allowed to tunnel. Not allowed to slug. Not allowed to use certain perks. Not allowed to hit them. Not allowed to breathe.
---
These are just some bullshit survivor rules on how killers should act so they have the most fun possible. I recommend you just ignore these salty bastards and play however you want.
---
I failed the vibe check
---
Don’t listen to those salty toxic survivors you are going to encounter a lot of them!
---
And you will see that killers have to follow their rules but survivors can be as toxic and as unfair as they like!
---
Play how you want and remember YOU are the killer so kill by any means necessary!
---
I mean you should be kicking safe pallets anyway. I dont see it being a huge issue.
---
Well?
---
How will they patch it though?
---
Whos the guy on the left?
---
Dude, I'm a killer Main and your argument is just ridiculous. People want to waste a perk slot on this niche park that's fine with me. I smash every pallet that's ever dropped anyways and have no problem whatsoever catching survivors. I never give a shit about safe or unsafe pallets, just smash them all. At worst this might be an issue once every 20 games. Please don't start being as whiny as survivors.
---
You are doing nothing wrong in any of these. In the last one it is their fault for unhooking in your face.
---
When i did the 10 gens archive mission i used resilience and spinechill, 9% faster once you are injured and 6 from spinechill + more skillchecks (which comes fairly often when the killer is looped nearby). Also you have the security of spinechill telling you early when to get away, and in chase you get 15% vault speed which is also nice.
---
Not the biggest fan of prove thyself as it is more effective to be alone on a gen most of the time anyway
---
Play to your style you are a killer and that's kind of the thing you are supposed to do. There is a YouTube who does dbd comedy animation and he posts random numbered rules like "camping is when the killer is anywhere on the map after hooking a survivor" stay positive. There are other people who do appreciate good players on both sides of the fence. I've been invited to voice chats so the guy could try and brag to his friends and belittle me and I've also made some really good friends by acknowledging superior gameplay. Good luck and keep having fun, screw the haters
---
The DC build. Lmao
---
Though the new survivor sounds like Meg.
---
Or a really good Billy for that matter
---
Uh, no. Breaking pallets is a right move 99% of the time because, while it does make the chase go longer, it prevents chases from happening in the future. Watch any high level killer player and you'll see them break nearly every pallet that gets thrown. If you cant put on pressure because of one pallet break you werent gonna apply pressure in the first place.
---
Dude... no offense but thats a hideous rendition of the Halloween 1 mask. It looks identical to the H6 mask.
---
This is coming from a pretty big fan of the series... someone who owned the original Halloween's on VHS likely before you were born.
---
Ok boomer
---
Alright we’ll see when it drops. Trust me I’m gonna run it and it will be abused very easily. If I can run away from a dropped pallet every single time with no way to get hit I’m gonna get that much more time in chase from EACH pallet.
---
The first three killers deserve reworks, but I think Nurse’s mori is actually creepy as hell without being gory, which I can appreciate. They did a really good job with it, especially before they had the resources they do now.
---
Of course being on console I never see a nurse hook someone let alone get a mori.
---
Make it so that only the person using the key can escape; the hatch won’t stay open for the other survivors.
---
i also hope this perk doesnt do too much damage, as a killer main. like someone else said, the new killer's perks all suck, while the new survivor's perks are mostly great. my issue is that there are too many pallets. why not give the new killer an anti-pallet perk in which if he's stunned by and then breaks a pallet, it also automatically destroys the nearest pallet that was not already destroyed, whether it was down or up. a lot of times i meet a survivor who has to use almost every pallet in the map before i'm allowed to finally down and hook them, which wastes a lot of time and is tedious.
---
For those who are interested, this meme is built from the latest DarkMatter2525 video. It's basically just an atheist channel that parodies bible stories.
---
Seriously though you'd like it on him. Check Otz's Bubba Train video
---
Well, before this perk, if you don't kick the pallet, it can still be vaulted and used as a block until tended to, posing the same problem before, and after, the introduction of this new perk.
---
You're not *"forced"* to do anything. You can leave it or break it. If you leave it, there are potential consequences, regardless of the new perks abilities. 
---
So, as I stated in my original opinion, this new perk changes nothing IN THE CHASE, and only adds a very limited potential in an additional consequence of you do not break the pallet, and has multiple counters (the perks stated above).
---
The point is not that you have to kick pallets. We all kick pallets. The big thing about this perk is that it allows for survivors to drop pallets and run immediately and gain insane distance.
---
Dude its the same counter Spirit fury, The Doctor and The Clown. Just drop before he gets close enough to get stunned. Its really not that hard considering there are no complaints about Spirit fury despite it having the same counter.
---
So with this perk.... can you pallet stub a killer, pick back up the pallet while they're stunned.. then proceed to drop it in them again??? That would be the ultimate meme strat and boy o boy would killers not like you.
---
He do
---
Wow! That IS relatable!
---
You are all very unenjoyable individuals in my personal opinion
---
You have 5 seconds to live, as that is the greatest insult in all of existence
---
From what I've seen other people who have played the ptb say it hasn't come in that handy yet.
---
What a mature attitude.
---
Why is this perk going to be so good on Legion?
---
I tried it, it only works on the pools. You still drop his globs.
---
Just dont stun the killer.
---
Survivors are not entitled to the Hatch. Give it only to those you deem worthy.
---
After all Gens are done and/or gates open Camp if you want for as long as you want, at that point you have no Gens to protect. It's up to the other survivors at that point to out play you for the save.
---
Tunneling is a vague term with too many definitions that change person to person. I personally consider tunneling going after only one survivor from start to their death ignoring all others. 
---
In general Camping and Tunneling is unfun to the survivors being Tunneld/Camped but you can't get in trouble for doing so.
---
That's nice.
---
Just so you're aware, simply because YOU dislike something to the point where you don't think it "counts", it doesn't take away the fact Myers did infact get cosmetics.
---
It's not even being super serious, I respect what survivors dont like by not tunneling, camping, etc, and that's a degree of respect I would like returned at a bare minimum. No they physically dont have to, but respect is something people in general should be giving by default.
---
Great. We’re about to be nerfed even harder than before.                   
---
*End my suffering*
---
I think at the end of the day The Legions design and gameplay is either broken or not fun to play against
---
Ikr, sarcasm = rude gamers telling people to kill them self and overall make gaming an unpleasant experience.
---
You’re clearly the type to throw around the phrase “toxic”
---
Also learn to use the right “you’re” :^)
---
Okay the cool down is not thirty seconds for picking up a pallet it’s almost three minutes you are overreacting this is not a op perk and there’s a thing called brutal strength
---
First two are fine.  Last ones pretty weak though and will lose you games once you get out of potato ranks because you're going to encounter non stop Decisive Strikes and Borrowed Times playing that way.
---
It makes borrowed time do nothing.
---
Everyone got good at survivor, or they just simply hide and just rush generators..they don't heal, they rather leave team mates die on the hook, they dont do totems
---
It got to a dumb point, too many players taking dbd too serious where they try they HARDEST to be LAME. They don't just want to win and escape or be competitive, which is totally fine, but they want to do it as fast as possible thinking they are good at the game for some reason? and its just stupid
---
Enduring Spirit fury has the same counter. Why is no one complaining about that?
---
Because every killer is completely entertaining to face 🙄
---
I thought it wasn’t gonna be that great either. It was just until this morning that I thought about the real problem. It’s not the strength of picking up pallets. It’s being able to run far from the killer being forced to kick them pretty much right away.
---
The other option would be accepting the hit and not using the pallet at all.  Taking the hit and dealing with normal legion is superior than giving him the stun/light and dealing with old legion.
---
he can just vault
---
Ideally, yeah.
---
It was taken by a friend and intended to be a private photo.
---
He didn't misread, the perk is just badly worded.
---
Real talk though, did you actually moon someone in school?
---
Sometimes it takes a while for people to realize how strong something really is.
---
*hex totem gets destroyed instantly*
---
It doesnt punish anything, it just makes you waste 30 minutes before you lose.
---
Man you wouldn't believe the shit people say when they think you camped them. The slurs alone just yikes
---
There's a perk called Spirit fury
---
Haha why did the gen blow up on you? I didn’t even see a skill check
---
Switch remember me for noed if you want an endgame build and also to be a cunt
---
It's like if the killer could break an upright pallet. It's just stupid. This game has enough 1 shot perks and free escape perks as it is. This perk is just a response on how to deal with Spirit. They always do this dumb shit. Oh! A killer is bs? The survivors are crying for nerfs? Lets make a perk that combats the strong killer AND nerf the killer in question. Good call.
---
Yeah
---
Sorry, I'm still new to the game but love reading about the meta and interactions like this.  I'm just trying to understand - why does stabbing someone with feral frenzy make the killer have no radius with the nemesis perk?  Does stabbing someone with FF make them your obsession?  
---
Also, what does Legion's terror radius have to do with the bleeding starting?  All the wiki says is that it 'Triggers "Killer Instinct", revealing the location of all Survivors who do not have the Deep Wound Status Effect applied and are within The Legion's Terror Radius.'

he will be on live servers December 3, but you can test him, the new map/ survivors and other features on PTB right now
---
We will see (:
---
1) The killer granting Mercy is your choice, and the Survivors have to deal with that. Especially if you plan to get to high ranks, where the 4K is required to rank up.
---
2) Nothing wrong with this. While it is still camping the hook, when the generators are already powered there isn't much else to do. Doors take 15 seconds to open, and if they are on opposite sides of the map you can't cover both of them.
---
3) This one is a little dickish. The Survivor can't control when they get unhooked, so it's their team that is screwing them over. While you should absolutely take advantage of the situation, I recommend Slugging the guy who got unhooked and going for his dick of a team mate.
---
Play Survivor a little bit too. It'll help you improve your Killer game in so many ways.
---
It doesn't change the fact that he barely got cosmetics either. A few tools and a hospital gown... whereas nearly every other killer has a ton of options. Even Ghostface has like 6 masks to choose from and if you know anything about the Halloween series, you'd know the variance in masks is a big deal to people who actually care. 
---
Yes, he did get cosmetics.. never said he didn't.
---
Sure am. This time it’s got counterplay. Do your best to avoid stunning legion. That’s doable, at least in my experience.
---
I'm not quite sure I understand what you are saying. My whole point was that killers don't always break pallets, and you can save the ones they don't.
---
Oh shit better not write anymore entitled killer mains downvoting here. \*o\*
---
Everyone still sleepin on Hag, man.
---
And once you reach bloodlust, their meter starts going down due to Beast of Prey.
---
These 2 perks actually make Legion a threat during a chase in like all the wrong ways lol.
---
Ignore it.

... That sounds like it could work, but that requires 4 other people. I don't have 4 friends. I don't have 3 friends. I don't have any, let alone actual "friends" that would spend time fufilling my request that doesn't do anything for them, and isn't something they were going to do anyway.
---
As someone who has seen the video in question, your initial comment and follow-up behavior was nigh incomprehensible not because I didn’t get the reference, but because you need to work on your sentence structure and also calming tf down.
---
What a great outfit and photo! Nice
---
This is gold lol
---
WHY DO I KEEP LOSING FLASHLIGHTS WHEN I LEAVE A MATCH WITH IT CLICKED ON
---
He's the Oni but his real name is Yamaoka Kazan.
---
(Kazan translates to volcano, fitting.)
---
The cooldown is two minutes and a potential 4 on the map at a time. I don’t believe you are thinking about it conceptually. It doesn’t matter if a single pallet is picked up once during the match. It matters that I lose 5-8 seconds each time I get a pallet dropped on me because I need to kick it. A swf can fully take advantage of a perk of this nature. It’s the idea behind the perk, not the fact that there will potentially be more pallets.
---
Smh
---
How so?
---
Watch his video „Once upon a toxic Misty“ he explains everything in it
---
Thanks for help, can you also clarify that "try to win" moment. 
---
If I stop gens from being done until survivors let me kill them is that okay?
---
I kind of hoped she'd crawl through.
---
Don’t do that. Don’t give me hope.
---
CHARGER OR TANK- OH GOD!
---
*downed icon*
---
Yeah those S Tier Killers in the nurse and Spirit got nerfed all the way down to..S Tier?......wait you mean to tell me they're still the two best killers in game and this is just another killer main being absurd and overdramatic?  Well that can't be right...
---
I’ve played a 5v2 in a private match and it was disgusting. I was looping my friend; he was on my right. I had my next move planned and figured out, until suddenly the Nurse is on my left. With four survivors, the game can snowball very quickly so with ten survivors... uh.
---
So what do you do against that? Drop pallets early and just take the L with Thanatophobia?
---
It makes me win morally, because I forced these 4 survivors, who are used to 5 minutes games, play a 30min+ game.
---
No, I don’t. I never will have to. I do as I please and you can’t stop me. Bite me. Mongrels, all of ya.
---
You expected buffs but IT WAS ME, MORE NERFS!
---
nurse is the strongest killer and leatherface is the weakest one
---
Doctor 2.0?
---
The thought process is probably that you would have more time to look around for the gen, but 9/10 times you see the gen right away making the extended aura time worthless and actually hindering if the survivors leave the gen early because it stays highlighted for so long
---
Goblins?
---
Well that's their fault for birthing me. I didn't ask to be alive.
---
More then likely they just DC but technically if your willing to kill them its not taking the game hostage.
---
... Myers looking damn good here. No homo.
---
LOVE THEM! I'll take them all, please!!!!!!
---
I dont get how you wasting 4 random players time just for playing the game but fine.
---
The main issue I have with this combo is that legion doesn’t actually need to catch a survivor to down them. If a survivor is particularly good at looping, it won’t matter you will eventually bleed out.
---
I know you gave the possibility of losing the killer, but that’s way easier said than done against competent killers. Unless you have iron will, good luck disappearing before your timer expires.
---
You can do the same thing with the new beast of prey.  If legion hits you with his power he can just bloodlust you at safe pallets and you will eventually go down. Not because you got outplayed, but because he followed you around. 
---
I hope this clarifies things a bit. I do think legion is in need of a buff, and I hope Behavior has something planned for him.
---
To answer your question: 20 seconds after your terror radius goes away
---
A GIANT SAMURAI FUCK IS A BETTER STEALTH KILLER THAN MS. PIGGY LMAO
---
Toxic AND a grammar nazi, great combo.
---
WHY ARE YOU TWO SHOUTING
---
Than don't run hex perks because you're not grown enough to deal with losing them.  DC'ing because you lost hexes is trash dude.  Take that entitled selfish bullshit to Candycrush man.  So sick of DC divas in this game.  You people ruin the game.
---
If you're taking the game hostage with the intent to just drag the game out for no reason it can be bannable. 
---
I think it's a grey area in terms of waiting until survivors give up and let you kill them. At that point one can argue it's not really a hostage situation since they're not "Forced" to DC, they can just run up to you and wait for the sweet release of death. As long as you're not doing something like downing them, picking them up and dropping them to reset them so they don't die, only zapping them and doing nothing else, etc. you should be fine.
---
Yeah, for real. I haven’t been able to understand these Feng and Yui memes since they don’t even look alike. Not sure how this even got started, smh.
---
Legion csnt do anything else now. They just took most his perk synergy away, so you're either left with an unfun anti-heal build (which was nerfed and sont be as effective), or an effective unfun anti-TR build.
---
Legion just needs a full rework.
---
I don't think they will change anything, it's not that OP for legion to have a ability like that, anyway we will see that in a couple of days
---
Wouldn't that make it completely worthless since you could be on the other side of the map and not have to cleanse?
---
No problem I’m still learning all this stuff myself but I am glad to help. Stabbing someone with FF with the nemesis perk isn’t what makes someone become the obsession. The way that Nemesis works is when someone either pallet stuns you or flashlight blinds you they become the new obsession. Then once you get stabbed the Nemesis perk activates an effect called oblivious. That makes the killer have no terror radius. The bleeding timer stops when you are within Legions terror radius so that he can’t just chase you around forever until you go down. However with the oblivious effect applied by the Nemesis perk there is no terror radius allowing Legion to just chase you around until you enter the dying state again.
---
I did say since plague but okay. And thrilling tremors is just worse bbq.
---
That’s a relief to hear. I’m going 100% on speculation since I haven’t had the time to test anything myself, and BoP Legion was my primary concern. Do you happen to know off the top of your head what Legion’s deep wound timer is by default?
---
More like T-bag----&gt;bloodwarden amirite folk?
---
&gt; now deep wounds timer will be set to not go down within the killer's TR OR a certain proximity
---
&gt; also applies to BT deep wounds because of course
---
Oh dang... that's quicker than I thought.
---
From the first moment of seeing his secondary, I've just been waiting for the Scout memes... this is not Scout!
---
WHY THE FUCK IS BALANCED LANDING BEING NERFED? WTF IS WRONG WITH BEHAVIOR? THEY'RE COWARDS TOO AFRAID TO EVER BUFF ANYTHING LIKE PERK THAT NEED IT
---
wait is there a halo reach port coming out?
---
For the pig? Yeah, that’s true. I can understand the trap nerf with EGC, even though I’m not sure she really needed it. But they keep piling them on. I suppose it’s a perspective thing though, because I actually like her dash no longer being a basic attack, just so I can pair it with stbfl. Oh well, maybe there’s something really cool coming down the pipes, in the meantime we just gotta make sure the devs know what we want
---
Pre nerf legion: BHVR KILL HIM
---
After nerf legion: man legion got nerfed too hard, why would Bhvr do this?
---
Legion after oni update: BHVR KILL IT AGAIN.
---
I feel so bad for legion because it's always nerf him to the ground or buff him to be effective, he's never in a balanced spot.
---
Okay then learn to pallet loop/mind game instead of getting stunned at every pallet?
---
no just do a number sign example #aaaaaaaaaa
---
This is a good question. I mean, maybe they even leave it in for now. We will see.
---
&gt;One hit gives you half your power BTW
---
Yeah, I fucking noticed. And that's only if it's a healthy survivor, BTW.
---
&gt;When you are zooming you don't collide and bump into walls, you just slide off them.
---
You're supposed to be an unstoppable killer when in blood fury. Would you rather be immobile for 8 seconds?
---
&gt;You can go through half the map, stop the charge, and regain complete control in 0.22 seconds.
---
And again, aren't you supposed to be an unstoppable killer when in blood fury? If it was EXACTLY LIKE HILLBILLY, he'd actually be worse than him, since as I said, a survivor needs to be INJURED to gain blood.
---
&gt;You have way too much control over the charge
---
BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE HILLBILLY, HE'D BE DISMISSED AS BAD. YOU WANNA SEE A BAD KILLER, LOOK AT LEATHERFACE.
---
&gt;Why would you want to cancel it?
---
Simple. To pick up survivors, which it forces you to do if you pick one up. And by the way, you're still affected by stuns and blinds when in blood fury, AND slugging a survivor isn't a bright idea if they're near a pallet, or if they have Unbreakable.
---
&gt;"Me being new to the game gives me more legitimacy, somehow"
---
DO NOT PUT WORDS INTO MY MOUTH UNLESS YOU WANT ME TO STOP BEING CIVIL. I JUST SAID I WAS A SURVIVOR MAIN.
---
There are mind games that can be done without breaking the pallet. Now, these mind games are even harder to pull off because of this perk. Now the killer basically MUST break all of the pallets to ensure it doesn't happen. Poor perk design for the nature of this game. Bad call.
---
Ok, ty
---
&gt; just don't stun
---
&gt; just don't use pallets unless you're dropping them super early
---
&gt; and hope Legion mains don't use Furtive Chase as well
---
*shining red eye intensifies*
---
He kind of looks like Daniel Radcliffe in this pic but way better looking
---
He was never strong.
---
He could tunnel one Survivor down if he wanted, but it took way too long to do unless you had the right Add-ons. 
---
Legion was never fun to go against, but he was nowhere near high or mid tier.
---
I like how Scott Jund responded to the nurse nerf. He said, "if you need omega blink/multiple blink on nurse to win you were bad."
---
Even still, my point does stand.
---
My head canon always thought pee was what was in Clown's bottle, but they can't show him properly refilling due to censorship. That's why he doesn't have to go to some lab table or something to refill.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6oQUDFV2C0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6oQUDFV2C0)
---
Which it does
---
HE’S ALSO SUPER FUCKING BROKEN WITH NEMESIS. HE’S EVEN MORE BROKEN THAN HE USED TO BE! I DOUBT ANY OF THIS IS MAKING IT OUT OF THE PTB WITHOUT SOME SERIOUS CHANGES
---
Halo Reach comes to the Master Chief Collection and PC on December 3rd. It isn’t a remaster, but there are some notable changes to Forge and it’s in higher quality
---
It requires 3 seconds at any rank to pick it up, I dont know the exact time for stuns but unless its a cloaked wraith I would say probably no
---
I don't know if it plays a part in _that_ build, but keep in mind that Frank's Mixed Tape reduces the timer by 5 seconds, so stabbing twice takes you out of Frenzy and you're more quickly prepared for a regular swipe on a survivor with a shorter bar.
---
Nah I think its just poorly worded on BHVR's part. They really should've worded it differently to make it clearer that its to be taken as a whole and that the second part is tied into the first part. I can 100% see why it would've given you that impression though.
---
THEY DON’T NEED TO NERF NEMESIS (YET) BUT THEY DO NEED TO TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT HOW DEEP WOUNDS WORKS BECAUSE IT GETS BROKEN BY LITERALLY EVERY NEW THING!
---
You’re extremely good at detecting sarcasm buddy, keep it up.
---
Again, let me reiterate - those mind games during the chase around the pallet that's down don't change. And, when stalled in a chase because of a thrown pallet, you have to break it to break the loop.
---
How does this change?
---
This is my point exactly. Dbd isn't an esports game. They're is no reason I should be forced to play hyper optimal at all ranks just to have a positive experience. As survivor I have to deal with slugging, 3 different gen slowing perks, meta killers who need tweaks, all the while they sweat their asses off assuming I'm going to DS, Dead hard into a god loop if they don't Mori me as soon as I get unhooked. As killer I have to deal with 3-4 DS, 2-3 BT, 3-4 adrenalines, and typically 2 people abusing the piss out of God loops making half the map unplayable.
---
It’s not to much work I just am new to the game and I don’t understand what the perks mean. I know my question what shitty I wanted to rephrase it better but I had to do something real fast while asking this question so I just sent it out before proof reading it. My bad.
---
???
---
But any good survivor will make you kick the pallet and run away anyway
---
lol, Pathetic and cringe. but thanks
---
They're placeholder sounds. My god I wish people would just read patch notes.
---
Love this XD
---
definitely. but dumping all the shit on one side feels stupid too.
---
Her voice is currently Meg's, but it's just placeholder.
---
The thing is though sometimes it's the killer thats toxic. I play both sides and I get that survivors are  bad too but I hate when posts call out one specific side when I got teabagged by a ghostface when I didnt do anything to him but people ignore that. Again I really appreciate the post I just hate how often survivors are the ones singled out when I dont play toxic yet get teabagged by killers when they feel like being dicks.
---
Yea then for sure the killer is just being a dickhead then and deserved what he got.
---
I run infectious fright, corrupt, whispers and ruin/pop
---
Go to totem and puke it, go to nearest gen an puke it and by that time whispers would be on so I look for them, puke them all and the chase the broken one
---
Someone made this already? I honestly had no idea.
---
I fucking bet you got gold because you put Keanu Reeves in it
---
&gt;but if its a wraith or nurse for example I get mad only because I dont die in a cool way
---
Nah the nurse actually has one of the best mori's in the game imo. Everything from the struggle the survivor puts up to the little caress at the end just makes it badass.
---
thanks!
---
Its brutal against people that can just play through ruin.
---
WAY TOO MANY PERMA TIER 3 MYERS' LATELY, AND MY TEAMMATES ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO FEED THE EVERLOVING FUCK OUT OF THEM, SO THAT THEY GET THEIR TIER 3 THE MOMENT THEY SEE ME AND I GET A PIPE RAMMED UP MY ASSHOLE.
---
Sure do. Happens about 3/4 the time up at red ranks. I’m accustomed to using the black incense add on and that makes you incredibly punishing if they don’t cleanse. 
---
Also monitor and abuse helps for gaining an extra 8m of ground before your terror radius kicks in.
---
Nemesis applies oblivious only on head on, pallet stun or flashlight blind. It was tested already
---
Welcome to my world. Where every killer is toxic
---
No, the template has a spelling error that I’ve always seen
---
Oh. Thanks.
---
Yeah, it's gotten to the point that personally I see more posts talking about how it's "x sided" and talking about how people complain about the other sides than I see actual examples of it happening.
---
I was worried about using it just because it doesnt last long, but I'll have to try swapping it for ruin
---
Cool, thanks!
---
The same could be said for freddy, or the demogorgon, hell people keep asking for Pennywise and he's more powerful than a xenomorph. I personally don't think they would fit well with the theme of DbD but they're not necessarily more dangerous than some of the characters already in the game.
---
How has no one mentioned that we already have a thicc boy? Bubba? Hello?
---
I tend to keep my posts and responses fair I think, but it’s hard to sympathize with you on anything if you say you don’t like how this place is uncivil, then go on to be uncivil in your entire post.
---
Well then change the perk description then, because as is that would appear to not match what the perk says it does. 
---
Do you have a video of that?
---
Beast of prey is a waste of time. You should already have gotten the person down when you reach bloodlust 1
---
It's not dark though? They are both clearly lit by a solid light source. 
---
If the artist decides to pick a super crazy unique light setting that makes her hair look the wrong color for no reason that is their fault. Of course this is impossible with that light setting and it makes no sense to do this intentionally.
---
I don't even think it worked then! Seriously, aside from dealing damage and not infecting anything, corrupt purge is bound by the same rules as vile purge.
---
Yes, that's why nobody uses Spirit Fury and also why it's not considered one of the best killer perks in the game, because survivors can simply opt not to stun the killer.
---
...It's not possible to just avoid stunning the killer, especially if the killer is trying to get stunned, and with Nemesis Legion, any stun at any time means guaranteed death in 30 seconds, less if they also have Study and Mixtape. That's completely ridiculous and anybody that actually plays games to have interactive and engaging gameplay would not even hint at arguing in favour of what this "interaction" entails, which is literally just staring at each other until a timer runs out.
---
The obvious fix has always been to make Deep Wound bleed out not happen within a certain range of the killer, like 32 meter, rather than tie it from one exploitable mechanic to the next.
---
2 minutes is a fair amount of time, especially because it's a gamble as to whether survivors spawn on ruin, or if it spawns next to gens.  Ruin has more potential, but corrupt has more consistency.
---
That's very elitist of you, don't you think?
---
No one plays killer to run around a wall and moonwalk on occasion. We accept those things because just making the Survivors not be able to do anything would be frustrating for them and boring for us.
---
 But Nurse, Spirit, and the other high tier killers are the few that actually feel like you as the killer are in control. They just happen to be the ones that ignore or have the advantage at loops.
---
I haven't run whispers at all. Is it a pretty obvious signal when it alerts you?
---
Oh. I got this template a long time ago. I was waiting to find a good disconnect emblem, but there isn't one with a transparent background. Had to crop a picture so it's low quality.
---
Brutal strength + enduring making a comeback
---
???? The perk only activates when he's stunned
---
Anybody else read this in the Legion voice from the Samination DBD parodies?
---
OK HOW THE FUCK IS PUSHING THE CROUCH BUTTON REPEATEDLY BEING TOXIC, HOW THE FUCK IS WATCHING YOU FUCKING DIE ON A HOOK TOXIC, HOW IS ANY OF THESE THINGS YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT TOXIC? SWF PLAYING SO DAMN WELL THAT THEY RUN CIRCLES AROUND YOU? TOXIC. KILLER DOING HIS FUCKING JOB OF KILLING ANY SURVIVOR BY ANY MEANS AVAILABLE IN THE GAME? TOXIC. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST YOU PEOPLE THROW THE WORD TOXIC AROUND LIKE CUM IN A BUKKAKE PARTY. THE ONLY TOXIC THINGS YOU CAN DO IN THIS GAME IS PLAYING BAD ON PURPOSE, CHEATING AND ABUSING A BUG. EVERY THING ELSE IS FUCKING PART OF THE GAME. YOUR TEAM IS FULL OF IDIOTS? WELL YOU GONN FUCKIN DIE THEN , COZ THERES A FUCKIN KILLER ON THE LOOSE IN THE MAP. 4 FLASHLIGHTS? BOOHOO MOTHERFUCKER ENJOY YOUR TANLINES. TEABAGGING AT THE EXIT GATES? DONT FUCKIN TELL ME YOU WOULDNT DO THAT TO A FUCKER WHO CANT HURT YOU NO MORE. PLAY. KILL. SURVIVE. GG YOU PIECES OF SHIT.
---
Looks good! Great work
---
Really? I thought STFL required basic attacks? If it didn't this entire time then I don't know why people were freaking out about his "nerf" so much.
---
I guess I should probably look into how the perk functions to form a better opinion.
---
You just lose with no counter-play. Even if you drop pallets, it’s legion. They can just vault it to keep blood lust 1
---
I agree, but that is far different than "I should have been doing it anyway"
---
This one should be the top.
---
Thankyou
---
So many angry survivor mains.
---
You know what you're right, 2 mins is longer than my ruin usually lasts anyways. Its incredible how fast survivors find it
---
I’d say it’s more tongue OUT of cheek tbh. 
---
That was probably in poor TASTE, wasn’t it?
---
no, i watched streams
---
Fuuuuck, new killer or halo on pc...
---
This gives me an urge to tunnel and facecamp every Yui i find.
---
For counter a key, use ruin for slow generator. Use flanklin demise for make them drop the key. Discordance for let them know they are 2 on a gen and u can take bbq chili for reveal survivor.  U can also use Miyer with tombstone for kill them before he jump in the hatch. And locate the hatch when there is 1 gen or 2 if a survivor is dead.
---
Obviously these are fictional characters, but I think shipping in general is just taken too far when it comes to real people and it makes them uncomfortable. Many celebrities have been approached with cartoon drawings of them having sex with costars or complete strangers. When they let people know they're uncomfortable, the artists get offended. I have no idea where graphic artists started thinking it's acceptable to do this, and it would be unacceptable in any other context. To draw someone in a sexual manner, show it to them, and then get offended if they don't like it? 
---
So whenever the topic comes up, fictional or not, It's going to make some people uncomfortable. But don't dismiss it as "it's not for them" or they don't get it or something. It's just very common for it to be taken to bad places.
---
So original legion moonwalking until you bled out is considered counterplay? Because that was considered an exploit, and this isn’t much different except you need a perk.
---
Username checks out.
---
Hmm. Obliterate choice instead of fixing shitty map design philosophies. W I S E lad.
---
I love these, especially the top and right one on the left diamond! Please do a pack of them &lt;3
---
Nah, it goes on if any surv is near to you but don't tell you exactly where
---
&gt;that's why nobody uses Spirit Fury and also why it's not considered one of the best killer perks in the game
---
Except it is not...it is a mid tier perk that is only useful in a specific combo with Enduring on some killers, and once survivors figure out you have it they pre-throw every pallet (or at least when they are competent)
---
Don't listen to anyone telling you the "correct" way to play. I play both sides. I expect no mercy from both sides.
---
How about the add on that adds a cleansed fountain at the start?
---
:(
---
No yo gotta hold M1 during it to start a demon strike right out of demon dash. This mans an actual MOBA character
---
Legion is an exception to this. Legions issues were that they were full of exploits from putting on blood hound and looking down, moon walking, infinite mending, and being faster by spamming M1 in FF. Even if someone wasn't exploiting these mechanics, they had very very little counter play unless you were playing against a killer who wasn't very good and actually fell for pallet slams or the window trick.
---
Even with the exploits and lack of counter play Legion still wasn't some top tier killer. They weren't nerfed because survivors cried about them being too strong, it was because of the exploits and lack of counter play. 
---
Think about how MoM got nerfed shortly after Ash was released. That perk didn't have any exploits, but it gave a ton of killers, mostly low tier ones, no real counter play to avoid it. Should we talk about how these whinny killers got MoM nerfed? No, because it objectively was bad for the game. Legion is the same way except they had the added issue of those exploits.
---
&gt; I JUST SAID I WAS A SURVIVOR MAIN.
---
I will apologize for that, I misunderstood what you meant by that message but in my defense it was a statement you could take either way. Saying you only have 1 p3 character can mean that you main 1 class and/or that you are just starting out and haven't managed to prestiege anyone else yet.
---
&gt;Simple. To pick up survivors, which it forces you to do if you pick one up
---
It doesn't force you to pick one up. You can down someone and zoom to the next gen. It's already a common strategy on billy with knockout, that's kinda why slugging on him is really good. You get a ton of pressure with it, as people are running like headless chickens looking for the one guy. 
---
&gt;or if they have Unbreakable.
---
It's a very rare perk to see, I'll take that gamble.
---
&gt;You're supposed to be an unstoppable killer when in blood fury.
---
Why, exactly? You are making mistakes, you are not planning your charge in advance and you are making a poor job of maneuvering around obstactles. Why should you not be punished for fucking up?
---
&gt;Would you rather be immobile for 8 seconds?
---
I mean if you want to exaggerate to make ridiculous comparisons then I don't see much point in discussing this. You could make him way more reasonable than he is right now without making him a bad killer.
---
&gt;Yeah, I fucking noticed.
---
You didn't notice the point I was making. You gain the power way too quickly for how stupidly powerful it is. If you want to keep his strength in angry mode then it shouldn't be this easy to gain the power. Even if you heal to avoid giving him more orbs, you are still giving him his power as healing counts as action, and by the time you are finished healing you have generated enough orbs to give him his power.
---
&gt;BECAUSE IF IT WAS LIKE HILLBILLY, HE'D BE DISMISSED AS BAD
---
If we are at a point where the survivor can get around a sharp corner to try and avoid the charge, and the guy can just casually curve around that sharp corner and get the survivor anyway, I'd say we went too far. You are supposed to be able to do something in a chase vs this guy, and from what I've seen you can't really avoid getting hit if the Oni charging at you is competent.
---
If you can miss the charge, stop, immediately turn around and down the guy anyway, then there isn't really anything a survivor can do to avoid the hit.
---
The person who stuns last you is the obsession and is Oblivious for 60 seconds.
---
I believe it is 30 seconds. Its absurdly long. Stab Study brings it down to 20
---
He to thicc
---
Spirit is already confirmed to be nerfed stop beating a dead horse already
---
Ya that's pretty typical unfortunately.
---
perhaps I should've used 'misinterpreted' instead of misread? the poor wording on BHVR's part caused them to interpret what BHVR meant wrongly.
---
Is that the tongue he's ripping out?
---
Fastest release date with a ptb we’ve gotten
---
You dont need to be swf to just get on a gen till its timer runs out because you have no other choice though
---
PORN
---
Maybe downed players can crawl around and  pick up a bunch of their own blood orbs to slowly get back up but who knows, that might be kinda cool.
---
That would be a yes.
---
So far the responses haven't been too helpful, and the one that tried to explain was just plain wrong.  Dying light means that when you hook anyone that's not the obsession, everyone else is a little slower at everything they do, the more you hook, the slower they are.  The obsession is not affected by this slowdown.  If you hook the obsession, it doesn't affect the other survivors at all.  If you kill the obsession, this perk deactivates.  
---
Save the best for last means when you hit someone that's not the obsession, you gain a token.  Each token reduces your cool down on your primary attack by 5%, up to a max of 8 tokens or 40% reduction.  If you hit your obsession, you lose 2 tokens. If you kill your obsession, you cannot gain any more tokens, but you keep the perk active.  So if you have 6 tokens when you kill your obsession, you'll never go over 6, but you'll keep the 30% reduction.  
---
Play with your food is the perk where if you start a chase with your obsession and then lose them, you gain a token.  Each token gives you 4% movement speed (which is a HUGE bonus).  Any time you attack, you lose a token.  
---
Myers works really well with monitor and abuse (smaller terror radius out of a chase, larger in a chase, it's from The Doctor) and infectious fright (anyone in your terror radius when you down a survivor screams, revealing your location, from the Plague).  This is because you have a smaller terror radius in tier 2 by default, so monitor and abuse lets you sneak up and get extremely close before they hear you, and in tier 3, it's either normal (32m) or larger (40m) but I don't remember.  Either way, what happens is you one shot someone in tier 3, you have an extremely large terror radius because of monitor and abuse increasing it mid-chase, and infectious will make someone scream that you can go and one shot.
---
&gt;It's not a requirement, the fatigue is just something that happens and makes no difference whatsoever.
---
It literally is required because you cannot stay in Frenzy for that duration, so it needs to happen. And yeah, a 4 second stun makes a pretty big difference since it allows experienced survivors to get a great head start to a good looping spot where they can lose line of sight. 
---
&gt;Stunning killers with a pallet does not deplete Bloodlust completely, chase state is maintained and so is Bloodlust.
---
Being stunned by a pallet removes all Bloodlust. [Is the wiki wrong?](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodlust)
---
&gt;Breaking line of sight does not instantly break chase state, if the killer simply keeps following you Bloodlust is maintained.
---
Instantly? No. But there are many spots on many maps where you are forced to break a pallet to maintain chase otherwise you lose a survivor, and bloodlust.
---
thats me in the video
---
its me
---
Oh shoot! I hit downvote! Oh well, better luck next time.

I should add the guy FOUND the purple key mere minutes before he was downed. L u c k y

The stranger things dlc is best bang for your buck
---
unlocks
---
Uhhh what playstyle do you like
---
You make some great points there. Killer perks should help end chases early like survivor perks extend chases. I doubt the conditions for nemesis would be as much of an issue as beast of prey. 
---
People already throw pallets early if they believe the killer is running spirit fury, so you can play around nemesis. If legion has beast of prey they can just keep following you around that dropped pallet until you eventually bleed out. If you try to go to another loop, legion will catch up to you first. If you stay at the pallet, then you will eventually just go down. You need legion to break the pallet and reset bloodlust, so you can continue onto the next loop. 
---
Now the legion gets to down a strong looper and gets to eliminate a strong loop without any skill on the killers part.
---
Okay - what's the difference between this and survivors running meta perks to counter meta perks on killers?
---
How is this different from survivors having to take out totems to counter NOED, thus wasting time and not doing gens?
---
***LAYERS***
---
What does this button do? Oops, I blinded you again.
---
Anyone else read this like: “The Oni, Billy, The Oni, Billy, Billy, Billy
---
Big old no from me. Moris should be changed but Tombstone Myers has enough counterplay and is something the killer works to get and is earned.
---
Depends what you're looking for.  Spirit is strong (even after her nerfs), the new Oni killer will be coming out on December 3rd.  Leatherface has BBQ which is an amazing perk, and if I had to suggest you get one perk (other than something like ruin, or corrupt) it would be that, if you don't yet.  If you just want them for the gameplay and don't care about perks, you might like ghost face.
---
Well put. Thanks for your opinion on it.
---
Leather face
---
4 survivors 5 totems, 16-20 pallets 1 killer.
---
How is this getting upvotes, what is wrong with people? Did none of y'all play vs old Legion?
---
Plague doctors historically made the spread of the plague worse on accident.
---
Billy stronger early game Oni is better after the initial start would say Oni is the better kill the no cooldown being able to cancel charge without a penalty etc. But early game billy has the charge and instant down not having to rely on getting a hit for his power.
---
I mean, it could take 10 minutes for all I care, waiting for a timer to run out is still not gameplay. Besides, it's only 45 seconds, best-case scenario, and Stab Wounds Study and Frank's Mixtape still exist, as well.
---
&gt; I recommend RES and using it’s user tag feature to mark people that aren’t worth your time
---
I'll second this. I very rarely use this feature, but when I do its nice to know immediately that someone isn't worth having a conversation with.
---
There are maybe 2 loops in the entire game that are abusable now that BL is nerfed, and killers that are dumb enough to chase there are rewarded eventually anyway with bloodlust and entity blocker. Just because you can't get a down at a normal tile easily doesn't mean they should introduce killer perk combo that allows you to literally get a down just by existing.
---
I already have BBQ
---
I dm'ed you
---
It was a Meg move being Meg, and I run to the hatch and point, hoping the killer realizes what a dick my teammate was being.  Open all chests and look for a key.
---
You uses to date Amanda?  No offense man but your ex was a real Pig.
---
Doesn’t really change my point, especially since I made the 20% value up out of thin air so getting specific with the statistics isn’t particularly important.
---
Well maybe if I am rank 5 I shouldn't be teamed with 3 rank 13s. Like hell I want to stay in a game where I will probably die on first hook while running the killer for 4 minutes and not a single gen done because the killer has tier 1 ruin and they just *have* to find the totem instead of powering through it.
---
LEATHERFACE
---
Jesus christ its jason Bourne
---
What do you do with pallets in game today? Leave them all?
---
Survivor pate, extra soft.
---
Like I'm torn between Plague, Hag and Spirit. 
---
Hag has good Teachables but Ace not so much.
---
Plague and Jane both have 1 really good perk and 2 okay perks.
---
And Spirit and Adam have 2 decent perks
---
whats with that sound effect when he hits her with club LOL
---
MY SUGGESTION IS ADD A TON MORE TIME ON GENS BUT GIVE US GAS CANNISTERS/PARTS THAT CAN BE FOUND AT TWO LOCATIONS ON THE MAP. SURVIVORS CAN CARRY THEM AND DROP THEM IF THEY RUN. EVERY TRIP TO A GEN WITH THE GAS/TOOLS LETS THEM REDUCE THE TOTAL TIME TO DO THE GEN DOWN TO A MINIMUM LIMIT.
---
THIS CREATES MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERACTION WHILE ALSO ALLOWING SOLO SURVIVORS TO STILL ACCOMPLISH THINGS IF EVERYONE ELSE IS GARBAGE.
---
BUT I ALREADY HAVE BBQ AAAA
---
r/nobodyasked
---
No they keep bloodlust since the chase is separate from the power (Wraith may be the only exception)
---
Break the strong ones, leave the weak ones. There is zero reason to break weak pallets because typically they're a free hit if used.
---
L E A T H E R F A C E
---
for real doe, he’s weak as shit, but is my favorite killer. 
---
If a survivor is being toxic... U MUST PUNISH
---
Camping in basement as bubba is not gameplay too, but if they want to kill 1 man they will camp. Same with legion. You have to tunnel hard and waste a lot of time on one survivor when another 3 gen rush you. This is not effective at all, but i don't see any problems
---
Honestly, that's not a bad idea. Just make it so anyone that is afflicted with deep wound can't do a gen and re-increase the mend time, and Legion actually has a purpose. Kit game delay with a free injure, rather than the crap he is right now.
---
Okay. And, if they're weak and provide little to no protection now, they do the same after this perk.
---
Again - how does this change anything?
---
Gonna answer that with questions first. 
---
Why be a troll and ruin the game for one person? Why not hook the person right in front of you? Why not go on to try for 4 k? Why be toxic at all?
---
See, that goes both ways?
---
And yes, I’m saying you’re supporting a troll because you’ve said nothing against the killers actions, and instead picking on the survivor who was put into an auto-loss situation. 
---
If she leaves for a gen, she’s downed, hopefully hooked but if the killer is going to continue to troll, probably slugged, or picked up and forced to stand again until she runs to the same box being blocked. The killer gets to negate any option she has (depending on perks).
---
LAST NIGHT I WAS BEING CHASED BY BUBBA RIGHT AT THE START, I WAS ON THE BOAT IN BLACK SWAMP AMD A CLAUDETTE RUNS UP THE STAIRS WHILE IM RUNNING DOWN AND BLOCKS ME. BUBBA GETS THE HIT AND HOOKS ME! THEN SHE UNHOOKS ME LITERALLY RIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM, BUT INSTEAD OF GOING FOR ME, HE GOES AFTER CLAUDETTE FOR A SOLID 3-4 MINUTES! ONCE HE DOWNED HER HE HOOKED HER AND FACE CAMPED HER AND REVED HIS CHAIN SAW IN HER FACE TILL SHE WAS SACRIFICED! THE REST OF US ESCAPED! HE MESSAGED ME LATER AND SAID HE FACE CAMPED HER FOR TROLLING ME. GLORIOUS!
---
The Killers I mainly play is Huntress and Wraith so idk what that says about my playstyle
---
No.
---
I really hope they don’t nerf nemesis because of this. It’s the Oni’s only relevant perk
---
Yeah and by many others, as dennisreep rates it at a solid B-tier, and watching high ranked streams you often see people playing without it. But yeah, one of the core staples of killer loadouts!
---
&gt;Not only is pre-throwing pallets still beneficial for the killer, but even if survivors know that you have Fury you can still force getting stunned, there are a ton of possible situations that see survivors not have enough distance to live without dropping a pallet, in which cases the killer can lunge to either get the hit or the stun.
---
Okay, so let´s say you finally lose enough distance to be forced to stun the killer. At that point the chase is likely already going on for some time, and then you add the extra what, 15 seconds to guaranteed down? 
---
Most other killers would already just M1 the survivor in that time. A killer using Spirit Fury would down the survivor right there without having to wait the extra 15 seconds. We have killers that *completely* ignore loops like Nurse, and killers that have top tier mobility with unlimited instadowns like Billy who don´t have to force extended chases. But here we are, arguing that a guaranteed down in an extended chase where the rest of the survivors likely finishes multiple gens is "anti-gameplay"...okay
---
Wait, IS THAT CARL THE CASHIER
---
Cahla did this to me yesterday on stream. I was like "WTF, are you running STBFL?" Nope. Just out of curiosity I threw down like 3 in a row and she just hulk smashed through every single one.
---
Noob survivors are going to tear through your limited supply in no time flat.
---
Dude I'm not picking on anyone, I responded because you're acting like you cant just do a gen. Yes that killer is a dick but you cant do anything about it. You can do  a gen though?
---
Again I dont understand how you think the mindset to just give up is better.
---
Isnt that a bankable thing? Is it considered taking the game hostage?
---
Oh shit give me the sauce.
---
Just trying to correct the math
---
Trust me, it is still garbage, but at least this is good progress
---
Would make more sense to have her start the animation, do some phase shit or even freeze like a husk, and then appear on the other side. Seeing her hoist herself like some normie looks weird as hell.
---
Might very well be.  He's supposed to be this hulking brute of rage, so I would personally have him sound...normal.  Reasonable volume, little to no inflection, just a calm speaking voice.   That's only if you want to go against type of course.  "Big angry guy" would be perfectly fine too.
---
So the absolute worst thing that would happen is the pig leaves and tunnels the person with the trap on till they die, that buys their team huge time. Or they can finish a gen and unfortunately die, But at least they helped their team to hopefully not have to deal with the same crap. It's like how people struggle on hook against face campers even though they're dead anyway
---
NGL, I can never get the power to work right but I do pretty okay. I look forward to being able to actually DO something as Legion
---
Fanart is A-okay, there's tonnes of Dead by Daylight stuff on there.
---
I play killer, i play demogorgon because its fun, however when i get toxic players, i will do *ANYTHING* And *EVERYTHING* to take out the most toxic player
---
My issue is that it throws a core mechanic of the game out the window. You get to drop each pallet once. The game has been balanced around that for years. And now, instead of mind gaming unsafe pallets, and predicting, oh is he gonna vault it like an idiot or, will he bait it and go around, so should I go for the grab or rotate around. I have to just eat the pallet, and risk being stunned because I have to play a guessing game of fuck what if someone has BAMN and it's back up.
---
A stun is 2 seconds so you can't
---
I usually stick to the outside walls as survivors usually look in towards the map. Works for me more often than not.
---
PS4 and I have almost everything. Just need 
---
1.	Wounded Healer (I think it’s broken at the moment, ironically enough)
---
2.	Left For Dead (can’t wait to get this one)
---
3.	Swirling Death (one day I’ll finish this grind)
---
4.	Skilled Huntress (I’ve done hatchet downs a total of one time lol I suck at Huntress)
---
5.	Savage Takedown (I’m trying to learn Demogorgon better. One day!)
---
Confusedmeme.jpg
---
Lol I just realised Otzdarva commented my post
---
The real spirit nerf is that nobody will be mad against her anymore cause they'll be laughing at her vault
---
No Addon needed. The range of the blood orb auras are pretty small, though.
---
I still like watching his videos. But it did make me sad watching that video. So many people get kittens or puppies then seem shocked that they're high energy and can be destructive. He should've gotten an older cat instead of a kitten when he knew his living situation was small and he didn't have a bunch of time to play with her
---
It’ll be gone faster than a salty first down. Legion must suck.
---
Nice one! Good luck.
---
I like a Platinum myself but think this will will take a while. Medic being bugged doesn’t help either especially with the devs lazy approach to it.
---
Right but that same concept applies to Beast of Prey, except BoP does the same thing that Nemesis is doing so there's synergy
---
Oblivious makes you bleed out in chase
---
Gotcha, was watching videos and he seems a bit strong, especially with the dash and lack of penalty for bumping into things for an insta down and built in tracking killer, but we’ll see.
---
It would be nice for the killer bc the survivors wouldn’t know the killer until they saw/heard it, but I think it would clutter the map way too much and we’d also get a ton more bugs with it probably.
---
..now that I brought my whole crew. Say hi, guys.
---
Since 3.3.2 it’s been a nightmare trying to locate survivors. I can’t hear their footsteps nor their breathing when they are right behind me like I used to it’s infuriating.
---
so it becomes worse at tier 3
---
I like this idea a lot. Maybe even just having more on that killer's home map (More boxes on the meat plant for example)
---
Although I wonder if programming that would interfere with spawning these objects when that killer is really active and needs more boxes, fountains, etc.
---
I've tried searching for it, but I can't seem to find it. Got a link?
---
I'm on the fence, I keep thinking about doing it but I'm lazy.
---
you leave more blood trails
---
I feel like optimisation could be the issue, with the given track record.
---
Still, it'd be a nice addition to the atmosphere.
---
sounds hot
---
Luckily I got medic before it bugged out so I have the platinum. That’s honestly what’s making the rest take a while. Now that I have the shiny platinum I feel less need lmfao. 
---
Honestly once I get wounded healer (occasionally people get it somehow) and left for dead then I’ll really work on the killer ones. 
---
Can’t wait for the 6 new achievements coming in two weeks!
---
If you’re on PS4 too send me a message and we can look into forming a trophy group.
---
I just move in circles counter clockwise. Either way doesn’t matter tbh, neither makes it faster. Just do whatever feels right for your thumb lmao
---
I dont understand why it's a good perk for legion.
---
IF you don't break it. Simple solution.
---
I don't see this perk changing the "are they gonna throw it or loop it" game. Why would it?
---
As a survivor, are you really gonna depend on others to lift every pallet you throw? Maybe in a SWF game, but certainly not in random games are you gonna count on this level of coordination.
---
And, if you simply break the pallets, there is no coordination to be had.
---
Again - no validity to this line of argument. It's simply too easy to counter, and should likely be a main part of your strategy as killer TODAY - dealing with pallets.
---
&gt;It doesn't force you to pick up survivors
---
I never said that. I just said it cancels blood fury if you pick one up. That's strike two. One more and you're out. And blood fury doesn't last that long, either.
---
&gt;You didn't notice the point I made.
---
Uh, yeah, I did. You said "Hitting a survivor fills half your meter". I said you have to hit a fresh (healthy) survivor, which is harder than you'd think against survivors who know how to play the game. And even if healing does count as an action, that's better than the alternative, which is to let him get more blood by NOT healing.
---
&gt;If you want to exaggerate
---
I'm not even gonna bother with a response to that.
---
&gt;Why should you not be punished for fucking up?
---
I'm gonna use nurse as an example here. Nurse, unlike most killers, is SLOWER than a survivor running at a full sprint. (Unless she uses a certain add on) However, she can blink to quickly catch up to the survivor, while ignoring walls, windows, and pallets. Now, here's the catch with her. She can not cancel a blink once she starts charging it, which means a survivor can very easily move towards her to force her to either release the blink quickly, or be sent away from the survivor. Plus, when she does blink, her vision is warped during the blink, and she can't change directions during it. (At times, the latter is the ONLY thing keeping me alive during a chase) And once it ends, she will be fatigued after a short time (the more blinks she's used, the longer the fatigue), slowing her tremendously, and forcing her to look at the ground, possibly losing a survivor, or allowing one to sneak right by her. Those, in exchange for a powerful ability, are the penalties for screwing up, and they are rather fair. The Oni, however, is an M1 killer until he gets enough blood, and you know how fun they are to play as. Once he does, he's able to pretty much piss on the survivor's day... IF he doesn't waste it, because, unlike nurse, he has to choose when to activate his ability, and if he activates it in a genuinely cramped area, such as the game or a house, OR Hawkins, or in an area where it's very hard to see survivors, such as any cornfield, he's gonna have a hard time hitting a survivor. Plus, unlike hillbilly, pallets still work against him, and blinding him is not a dumb idea against him, either, since he needs to be able to SEE a survivor to hit them. He still needs to vault windows as well. Aren't those penalties for screwing up? This can also be used for your final point.
---
Ahhhh. The oblivious part is the strong part in assuming. That would remove your red stain and heartbeat? That’s insane
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 So fun e
---
I had a Ash tea bag after every flashlight save, pallet stun etc. It was obnoxious and unnecessary. His ass belonged to the entity, his friends were set free. 
---
As a survivor if I do the same I am not upset when I get tunneled and camped. I deserve it.
---
The devs honestly messed up deeps wound status effect when they reworked legion and attached the status effect to borrowed time. Same with with obliviousness and heartbeat requirements like borrowed time
---
On the train to hot!
---
It does not punish anyone. The rank system has no rewards. So, climbing rank is not important. Sometimes I just want to derank and I still manage to get a black pip by just screwing arround following the killer.
---
Cool sent you a message :)
---
That's a lot of copies of destiny being shipped out.
---
The entity brought him here, he will receive the respect he deserves
---
or just make it so instead of making hte oni lose its power when he picks up survivors, he should lose its power when he downs a survivor, thats way more fun and has more counterplays from the slug perspective, hes still gonna be slugged if the killer decides so, but there's room to save him at least... (to balance it out maybe make the oni lose less power bar since its every downed survivor, idk, i just dont think bhvr put a lot of thinking into this patch...)
---
I really like The Spirit's. The amount of anger you see in her is a really refreshing showing of emotion in the game.
---
Trapper: Should put down a trap, pick up the survivor by the back of the head, and SLAM them into it face first.
---
Wraith: Rip off the head of the survivor with spine attached. Look at his current spine club, and throw it away to use the new one. Bonus, the actual head of the survivor is at the end of his weapon for the rest of the match.
---
Hillbilly: Same as now except we actually see the survivor model split in 2.
---
same here ^^^ send a link pls
---
Completely disagree with that assessment. 
---
1. You risk bringing pig to a gen where another teammate is, and they’ll run off because they don’t know what’s happening, and prolong the game in pigs favor.
---
2. As I already stated, you wouldn’t get one second done on gen before pig rips you off of it and continues the trolling you. 
---
She’s not concerned with getting all 4 k, she’s trolling ‘one’ person, after she dies she may/probably will focus another in the same manner. But she won’t let you have the chance to help your teammates escape. She wants ‘you’ to have a frustrating and unrewarding game.
---
some of us want a longer color wffect and not constant explosions in our ear. so no, I dont agree
---
Aye and that's a thing I do like about this change, god knows this perk needed a buff. 
---
I really don't like its interaction with Legion, I hope they fix that before going live.
---
Yes'ir
---
Apparently he gave the cat to his parent temporary so the cat can interact with his parents cats, while at the same time he was moving to a new apartment.
---
Oh well I guess but the point of this post was to get other people’s opinions on perks I should use with Myers and to ask what his perks do.
---
I hope the perk doesn't get nerfed but just make it so that it doesn't work on Legion. They shouldn't change an entire perk because it's OP on one killer
---
Yeah, even edgey emo-teenagers I guess.
---
not to mention the fact that the legion can just jump the pallet
---
Nah this ain’t even true. Killers wanted maps fixing where BL is broken not the actual perk itself.
---
some of us want a longer color effect and not constant explosions in our ear. so no, I dont agree
---
Play With Your Chili
---
Gives undetectable while in use, so you can chase while the deep wounds timer kills them.
---
Next you’ll be wanting Jimmy Savile /s
---
Yes and unfortunately there is nothing you can do other than be a good teammate. She wants to make all 4 of you miserable if she can why not make her settle for 1? Either she comes to your gen and chases you which buys more time, or she chases someone else and you can attempt to get your trap off
---
Ah ok wasn’t sure and didn’t wanna spread misinformation
---
If you're the killer, and you aren't purposefully herding them towards unchecked gens, and unsafe areas, you're doing it wrong. 
---
In the beginning of my games, most of my chases end with at least two people injured. That's two people looking for heals, and potentially everyone off the gens while that happens. Which gives me time to patrol the gens, kick the ones with progression, and hunt in the area with the most progressed Gen. 
---
That will lead to a snowball more often than not.
---
You still had to do additional objectives to get then though, and do you remember how annoying it was? The vial system was shit, people would hog flowers instead of letting people get them as a group for more serum, killers were forced to run agi/iron grasp. At least with these ones when you go into a trial you're given shifting objectives that cant as easily be cucked by your teammates.
---
If you  don't have Ruin, then the Hag, if you do i would say wait for the next chapter
---
I loled
---
What are hes optimal builds? Bbq, nurses, sloppy and ruin?
---
oh no no no no survivorbros
---
Oh yh im stupid
---
I want to get Hag but I don't want Ace and I'm so conflicted
---
Looking fabulous.
---
probably 250
---
We demand a link!
---
I mean it's not a toddler with a knife  lol.
---
Give him Prod’s voice
---
There I ruined it for you lol... not that prod being a killer is a problem but rather him being oni specifically is a problem.
---
GIVE ME YOUR JUICIES
---
F tier: Your current girlfriend
---
that jojo thumbnail lol, the return of the pillar legion
---
Let Demogorgon take their heads!
---
og geez how could i forget, hags mori is pretty damn brutal too
---
What an assumption. Not only am I a killer main, but I actually play a decent amount of Legion. Depending on how this change goes I might not anymore, but being extremely good at tunneling one dude down is not a quality I want in my killers.
---
I mean, I don't play a lot of Spirit or Nurse.
---
But the fact that you think that you would get destroyed without looping says a lot more about your skill level than mine.
---

A MICHAEL WITH TUFT AND DEVOUR HOPE FOUND ME ONE TIME AND KILLED ME THE NOTIFICATION FOR DEVOUR NEVER HAPPENED UNTIL HE HIT AND KILLED ME I WAS FUCKING PISSED THE 3RD TOKEN WAS NEVER REVEALED
---
Perk, “Kiddie Fiddler” 
---
Younger survivors are brought to the killers bedroom when sacrificed,
---
You cant mend if he's following you waiting for you to bleed out. That's the whole point of the build, what are you missing?

[HOW MUCH YENS IS HE](/intensifies)
---
Random redditer confirmed as new survivor
---
“Why doesn’t everyone know what I know?”
---
It´s not like survivors didn´t have their fun when instaheal nerfs were announced
---
But it forces him to pick you up which means that (if you're the first one being chased or if everyone has it)then he only has a power for one down.
---
Devs: *hit the nerf button*
---
oNI CHAAAN
---
Worked well for head on. A lot of the community adapted to it pretty well eventually.
---
it could be the Thing from adams family. tiniest killer ever
---
They put his ears on top of his ears. Haha
---
The slaughter barn, new gay bar opening soon.
---
&gt;dennisreep
---
Chuckled, sorry. Yes, they also have Myers, Freddy and Ghostface above Billy and Nurse.
---
I don't know what to tell you other than yes, Spirit Fury is a core staple of killer loadouts.
---
&gt;At that point the chase is likely already going on for some time
---
There's a lot of situations in the game that could lead to the survivor having to drop a pallet in order not to take a hit, and very much so without there first having to have been a prolonged chase as well, such as when caught out of position, caught off-guard, or caught in save scenarios around hooks or such.
---
&gt;Most other killers would already just M1 the survivor in that time
---
This inherently depends on the skill of the respective players, rather than a set timer that takes all agency out of the equation, which is the point.
---
&gt;We have killers that completely ignore loops like Nurse
---
Nurse is in fact a pretty broken design, and good Nurse players offer little to no counterplay indeed. I do consider her to be a problematic design that could still need more changes. Either way, Nurse does not have a set timer to her chases.
---
&gt;unlimited instadowns like Billy
---
Apart from that I don't think Billy is a problematic design, this is not an argument about the "strength" of these interactions, whether they are strictly overpowered or not, but it's indeed saying that they are anti-gameplay interactions because they take the playing out of the game.
---
I think Legion is a very hard character to balance in his current state, but I do hope Behavior has bigger plans for him as they eluded in their AMA.
---
Overall, I think Behavior has been making a lot of great steps to better the health of the game, and I am confident they will fix this particular issue. My guess is that they are going to rework legion so this won’t be a problem.
---
*Frank has entered the survivor*
---
Spirit, Ghostface, Demogorgon and Freddy are very fun killers to play
---
Perfectly balanced, as all things should be...
---
Killers have nice perks, REEEEEEE NEEF! But on a serious note, if you don’t play both sides, then you can’t really decide what needs to be changed.
---
A troll isn’t going to chase someone else if they’re focusing one person to death. That’s the whole point. 
---
You keep posting the same stuff like the Killer is trying for 4K, but they’re not. If they’re focusing on ruining ‘one’ players game, they’re going to get it. They’re not gong to let you help your team escape. 
---
If they’re trolling manner ends with a 4 k, then sure, they’d love that, but the point of focusing one player is that it doesn’t matter where this survivor goes, she won’t be able to help her team when the killer does nothing but stay on her and prevent her from helping.
---
so do we know if this guy has any relations to spirit? seems to be very similar especially with the eye in the middle of his forehead seeing her latest halloween skin has one too
---
Tombstone Myers all over again.
---
Always drop pallets early? Well it's possible
---
inb4 delayed
---
Heck is there a way to send photos in comments via mobile?
---
I am also a December 1st.  Do you hate it too? Cold birthdays are laaaame
---
Idk if that would be a good idea, it would split player base, thus making longer ques.
---
Depends on what you want to buy him for. 
---
His perks are relatively poor with the exception of Nemesis which has potential synergy with other Obsession based builds. I personally wouldnt buy him for his perks unless I was a dedicated Plague or Legion Main. 
---
Killer-wise he's strong and seems quite fun to play. His add-ons are lack luster but other than that he seems to have a power that is both effective and fun. Though this is subject to change based if BHVR decide to nerf him.
---
Hell yeah. Playing with my soon to be chili :D
---
Ooh what will happen if I touch this?
---
You miss the point.
---
Players can deny safe hooks for fun, and troll people that are doing quests/dailies.
---
Just because people can DC or suicide, doesn't mean we should add in MORE ways to be a dick.
---
Imagine every survivor match you play you get sandbagged at every turn. Unhook are the only thing you can do where you can't get screwed by your teammates. Think, being blocked in a corner while doing a totem, or someone blowing skill checks on your Gen, and following you around to make sure you get no respite.
---
I AGREE BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY ONI DUE TO LONG QUEUE TIMES. I WOULD RATHER FARM MY LIMITED TIME ARCHIVE REWARDS WHILE I CAN. GETTING TO 70 HASNT BEEN EASY
---
Yes but her chasing you wont make your trap go off, you can still help your team. I'm just getting the impression  you feel like because you're getting trolled you are screwed and just let it kill you.
---
battle of the drifts
---
seriously. the fact that they ever came up with the idea of a killer whose power is to apply a buff to survivors designed for them to give to each other is absurd. I like this perk and want to use it as is on other killers. fix Legion instead.
---
Nope. Lol.

You might need to go to the top, and read the title.
---
Not really. You could post it on your reddit profile and then just link it below.
---
He sort of has a penalty? It's suprisingly long but only happens when you bump into things during a swing in wrath mode or whatever. Personally I'd say he's fun but not that overpowered after testing it out.
---
 \[MEG DEATHGARDEN MASK FOR CONSOLE PLAYERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\](/intensifies)

You could always upgrade your RAM.  To me it sounds like your gpu should have enough power but its being slowed down by the random access memory.  I'm not positive since i dont know much about that specific gpu, but usually you see a huge spike in performance with a RAM upgrade.
---
Seems BHVR has once again broken the balance of sound with the latest patch. Hopefully it gets resolved as Prior to 3.3.2 the sound was pretty good.
---
Very nice! Hope to see more!
---
Tier 5 challenge: save 6 pallets.
---
IN ONE GAME
---
Quote me directly then, because I am not even taking a side in the initial argument, but your responses are all based on me picking a side, dipshit. Try. Again.
---
That's old Dying Light and you described Play With Your Food, not Save the Best for Last
---
Man and here I was celebrating everytime I realized it was just Legion.
---
Okay, now you’re being a troll. 
---
I’ve already told you a few times over why the killer will NOT allow you to help, and you just keep saying the same thing over and over. 
---
Goodbye.
---
I think you have a valid point about queue times, but I would still support a casual/unranked mode. Leave all the sweaty players in ranked.
---
SUSIE!!!!!
---
I'm so getting that Steve one.
---
Ace
---
Look at my profile, I made a meme just like this yesterday for killers and insta-downs.
---
That exactly what I was thinking for trapper. I love wraith's because that would be mad disrespectful and hilarious. And billy that woukd be all you need
---
I really think the big difference is counterplay. Old legion could use their power at least once a minute to "force" a survivor down unless the survivor lost them. Now that needs a pallet stun to come into effect. Once it happens to the first person, survivors have a choice, much like how haunted grounds, thrill of the hunt or thrilling tremors. Plus this finally gives legion gameplay some much needed variety, like scratched mikey, or sniper doc.
---
The biggest boys of DBD.
---
I never knew I wanted an anime style Halloween series. Holy shit that would be thrilling!
---
Also looking by how Oni is working I'd suggest accumulative speed increase based on number of survivors already stabbed and the last unstabbed survivor will be instadowned. Also I'd say you don't have to loose your Frenzy on miss, just make a delay between hits unlike it was with old Legion. So if you miss too much your Frenzy will just expire.
---
you can't be serious with that dwight lmao
---
oh god oh no oh god oh no
---
well well looks like your doing a pretty good job so far
---
They tried to abbreviate "By Any Means Necessary" but that should ne "BAMN", and the perk is actually called "Any Means Necessary"
---
MY TEAMMATES KEEP LEAVING ME TO DIE ON THE FIRST HOOK AFTER I SPEND THE WHOLE GODDAMNED MATCH UNHOOKING AND HEALING THEM. QUIT WAITING ON ME TO DIE SO YOU CAN GET THE HATCH YOU FUCKS. 
---
ALSO: I AM NOT A DICKBAG CLAUDETTE PLEASE STOP TUNNELING ME
---
myes
---
The Wraith could actually get new weapons by killing survivors kinda like how Bubba gets new heads
---
The point is that running this perk with add-ons, specifically ones that affect bleedout time, essentially give the legion a guaranteed 15 second chase. Since the survivor will be oblivious, there will be no terror radius for them. Their mend timer will always be ticking down regardless of how close the legion is. There is no chance to mend, and unlike pre-nerf legion you don't even have to moonwalk to have this happen.
---
That would be much harder to keep it balanced with each new map. Devs would always need to keep in mind of that one perk so they won't create places where BL is stronger. They had tinkerer changed because it was progressively harder for them to always go back to it with new additions to the game. It's similar with the BL except the perk in its current format allows for some nasty loops in several maps.
---
They’ll probably just buff borrowed time but making it so it’s does tick down within 32 meters of the killer.
---
Am I missing something or is that obvious that its the same exact text ?
---
Wow might have to swap this one for empathy
---
Looks like it could be a vine
---
Oni shouldn’t lose his powe by picking surivors up that’s how slugging starts
---
spoiler tag...
---
Wait the hag is a free killer. Including billy, trapper, nurse, wraith and doctor. Those are all free killers and so are the survivors they come with.
---
There is no real counterplay. Whether it be with this perk or Beast of Prey, you will go down. It's the whole reason why Legion got nerfed into the ground. Now we have moonwalking Legion back again without having to moonwalk
---
So she used add-ons to make the game easier for her and a tactic unique to The Pig to secure a kill?
---
God forbid the killer bring add-ons and try to win...
---
It’s amazing
---
It's apparent you can't understand how some pallets are better left down. So whatever. Fine. Let's keep the perk that makes killer that much more frustrating, and all stay in Survivor ques for 40 minutes.

Camouflaged by the shadows. I love it!
---
This literally has nothing to do with the point i made but sure youre a good killer if thats what ur fishing for
---
Oh wow William has one, wasn’t expecting that,
---
RUIN IS THE ONLY WAY I CAN LAST IN THE EARLY GAME. I'M A BABY KILLER
---
I didn't say it was necessarily hard, just that it is easiest with Spirit.
---
Im a Legion main but I'm a bit confused why everyone is saying Legion using Nemesis is going to be very strong
---
am I just stupid? cause I don't see exactly why
---
Try to win ? Wtf are u Smoking
---
Elf Dwight is FIRE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
As unfair as ebony moris are and unfun greens can be, they at least are a one and done type item. You do have access to add-ons or offerings to keep keys. If they're the equivalents of the other it'd be nice to see them both relatively fair imo
---
THAT HELPED MY PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU!
---
Speaking as someone who owns everything other than Ghostface andseveral cosmetics, definitely buying this one on day one. Killer looks hella fun and the perks look interesting. Yui perks are kinda meh but could be fun in meme builds.
---
There are no infinite loops, entity blocker and bloodlust make it impossible to vault a window more than 3 times. You can't keep the loop going forever.
---
IKR Finally more cosmetics for her
---
that confused the hell out of me lol but I guess since they got the rights to use him on console they got the rights to do stuff like this gonna be weird seeing bill not in his jacket tho
---
BROOOO I kid you not just last fucking night I had a dream I was Trapper, like irl I was him, I downed a Jane, and I had to lug a peice of wood to a hook to repair it, but Jane's teammates where getting her up as i did that, crazy shit i have no idea where it came from, I'm a huntress main I've played Trapper like twice in 1.8k hours
---
Ah, so AMN
---
I didn't think it fit the woods either but yeah .-.
---
You fool they’re girlfriends
---
Everyone: WOW. This mori is so cool and brutal, definetely best mori in the game.                                     
---
Mortal Kombat players and bestgore users: That cool I guess.
---
You litter at can because of exhaustion perks and cancer like the asylum. Just google it and you’ll find shit loads of entries for infinite loops.
---
I really like this idea and I was wondering if I could use this in a fan made ideas compilation, you would be credited and I so have a couple changes I'd like to make. Pm me cause i have some other things I would like to ask you about this. We can discuss them here, but PM's would be easier. Thanks in advance
---
Boop the snoot
---
seriously, I really want to use it as is on other killers to counter the red stain without some moonwalking BS, especially on console. if they nerf the perk, it'll just be another case of all the other killers missing out on something good because of Legion.
---
The ability to restand a pallet is very situational and has a long CD, but that's needed so you don't go resetting everything. But that means you have to hope the killer doesn't smash on through, go back at some point, put it up and then start the chase in that area. A lot of work, as I don't think it can be used during a chase.
---
Eh, the insta heals I did like better before. They protect from 1 hits, but then leave you open to getting chased until you bleed out unless that got changed, can't remember.
---
But like the Oni gets a perk that rewards him for missing swings or missing on purpose to find survivors, granted I don't know the max radius for it fully leveled as I don't think 12m is too big.
---
I see hook suicide, a lot of them
---
Just wanted to have an honest opinion of the balance in keys being in the game when it comes to hatch and reusability. I've heard people argue killers have noed (which if used you won't hear the last of it), but noed has counterplay in it's ability to be destroyed. I just want to know how people genuinely feel keys are or aren't fair in mid/high ranks.
---
Sr.Pelo reference I see
---
That’s the other add on I often use! Having a corrupted fountain up my sleeve is a nice trick. Once I’ve got myself into a dominant position and everyone is broken, I collect my pool and go to town. Usually it’ll inspire someone to cleanse and then I have another pool. And maybe another.
---
Can someone explain this to me please
---
Maybe a year or two ago. 
---
Asylum is not an infinite. It's a really long loop yes, but that's not what an infinite is.
---
I love the little zombies on the bottom of it.
---
Oni: “I don’t really think a girl oughta be saying that kinda stuff.”
---
Yui: “...’kay.”
---
Looks like someone's embarrassed themselves and is now trying to cover for it lmao
---
"I'm usually rank 16-14" yeah that pretty much explains it
---
Idkw but seeing "William" instead of "Bill" brothers me immensely
---
Wait, it doesn't change nothing through the tiers?
---
There is no "skill" in survivor gameplay without looping. What are you even talking about?
---
Local man has wonderful time
---
That's good to hear :)
---
I've had quite a few toxic games, but I've also had quite a few killers drop me at the hatch after a really good game, people suck that they can be so toxic, but just ignore it and focus on the good like you have been!
---
same
---
I’m happy Steve got his Christmas sweater from the show but sad that nancys is boring and ugly
---
Well Bill is short for William.
---
5'11 virgin vs 6 ft Chad
---
Let me rephrase that, since you obviously didn’t understand.
---
The killer used add-ons and made certain you died.
---
And here you are crying about it because how dare the killer uses add-ons and makes certain survivors die, right?
---
That clear enough for you?
---
One game I had 3 dcs so I let the last guy get his 5 gens and he got full bloodpoints. Felt wholesome. But yeah, high ranks are a toxic nightmare
---
Oni vs Billy is just
---
SSTAR PLATINUM vs, ZA WARULDU
---
Why does she sound identical to Meg?
---
If spirit's dad is into the game, that means she can get a beating like my dad does to me :).    (Possible spirit nerf?)
---
It changes colors!
---
You stilnmake no sense , you say that as if its a normal thing to do , he obviosuly didnt  try to win at all , he tunneled me  and camped  the box he de pipped from that alone. What you are saying is just defending an asshole way of playing
---
W R O N G  O P I N I O N 👺
---
I can get pretty good FPS if it's not 4K.
---
Hatchets are so bad with hit registration. I get that latency factors into it, but I have to think they can be better than what they are now. The amount of times I've been hit by a hatchet 5 feet to my left or not hit by a hatchet that goes right through my character model is pretty dumb.
---
That’s only for us console players since we only have the special edition, but in the vanilla game, Doctor and Hag have to be purchased with iridescent shards
---
Guess I’ll block everyone of you fuckers then.
---
Oni's chase music! Thought you all would enjoy! Would love to hear your thoughts on the new killer!
---
Survivors are entitled and expect killers to follow some rules that they made up. Just play however you wanna play and ignore the salty kids.
---
Beast of Prey exists as well. It's not just Nemesis. And again, old Legion was broken. Not strong, broken. That's the whole reason he was nerfed so badly. You can't say anything that will excuse bringing that back.
---
I HATE THE WRAITH’S HITBOXES!!! LIKE, HIS LUNGE MAKES ME WANT TO BALL UP IN THE SHOWER AND CRY
---
I respect (usually) Bubba a lot. He just doesn’t really shimmy and him and the Clown don’t have much to talk about, so they never really clicked. ):
---
Waaaaaaaaah as she climbs as well
---
They won't be in their power when they intially get stunned? You will stun them, they will activate their power, vault over the pallet, and then stab you.
---
Holy shit this is beautiful
---
about 100 cells im pretty sure, you can still buy them now they never went away from the store.
---
She currently doesn't have a voice actor, so meg is the default voice atm
---
I guess they want her to have a japanese accented scream
---
*Screams in japanese*
---
Hmmm thanks might pick him up now
---
I love Legion and wish he was better, but this is not the way to go. He just needs to be scrapped and reworked 'cause he's been a failure form the start.
---
every killer has issues if the survivor is good at looping tho
---
Truth pal. He’s no more bullshit than Freddy, I’d argue less.
---
Nah the one where he goes “AAAAHAAAHEEEEHAEHEEAAAAAAAAAA!”
---
You should have had the Watchmen pin in there.
---
i think otz was the one who tested it out on stream. it was kinda closer to the end of his stream. you could find it in the vod.
---
Don't get hooked in the first place
---
I actually just started watching JoJo and am in the middle of Season 2. The fact that that I just got JoJo spoiled for me in the DbD reddit gave me a good chuckle.
---
He's a very distant ancestor
---
oof ouch owie my blood
---
offering, not plural. Tell me how ebony moris are balanced
---
It's comparing no add-ons to logwood dye like 5% and the tar bottle just straight up making it black
---
Onis weak early game makes him a snowballing killer. At high ranks hell probably be C- tier while being really frightening at yellow ranks.
---
The thumbnail looks more like Joker’s smash render pose, but a jojo-like pose nonetheless
---
OniiIi ChAnnnNnnNNnn
---
Let me pose a hypothetical situation to you:
---
You head down to your local basketball court for a game. You’re playing against some random opponents that you don’t know. Your opponents tell you “Don’t make a shot at the hoop or we’ll be upset.” Do you purposely not shoot? 
---
You’re playing a competitive game. Not competitive as in “professional” but competitive as in “versus other players.”
---
So why would you let your opponents dictate how you play the game?
---
You’re here asking about special things a killer needs to do to play correctly, but have you ever heard about the special rules for survivors? No... because there are none.
---
Crybaby survivors will cry that you don’t follow their made-up rules. They’ll do this no matter what. You could play perkless, with no add-ons, never hooking the same person until everyone has been hooked equally, and they will still complain (Otz showed this).
---
Screw their rules. Your job is to win. Use any tactic needed that leads to that. And expect your opponent to do the same.
---
Survivor mains literally can't comprehend any killers getting positive changes. Legion has been awful since release. Let him be able to use his ability lmao
---
So loop them longer instead of throwing the pallet down immediately, without their power legion is at 115% movespeed which puts them on par with most of the other killers and if they use their power then go for a stun
---
Love doing this as the Pig. Sometimes it takes forever for them to notice and they freak out
---
Hey! That's the only reason we upgrade perks
---
4500 shards  (you can buy them even now) and yeah I also think that the licensed ones will cost cells, but theres not any number yet
---
Why not just give the hatch doe
---
‘Cause i want the 4K
---
YoU CAnt HaVe It AlL.
---
This isn't really an argument. So because there are aspects of this game's gameplay that are not interactive or engaging, we should have no problem making more aspects of it like that? The only thing I really see in this argument is a killer vs. survivor mentality.
---
Repairing gens is not an interactive gameplay element to begin with, the chase however is where two players literally interact with and play against each other, and so taking the gameplay out of that aspect of the game actually takes the playing out of the game. But of course, I would also be welcoming of the idea to make generators a more interactive or at least engaging aspect of the gameplay.
---
Spirit fury is a joke. Either its garbage alone, or average or less with enduring. 
---
Enduring is good, but it's also required for spirit fury to be above mediocre, sorry. It's a wasted perk, and any player, even top their streamers, that use it are just kidding themselves. Rather run brutal or STBFL.
---
I meannnnnn 😬 I'm sorry. Camping is just not, in any way, as toxic as a 4 man SWF with meta. It's just not.
---
Imagine if perk tiers just gave you BP bonuses for using them, so BBQ wasn't special.
---
huh?
---
This technically isn’t correct with the things actual lore, but maybe have it not kill them instantly, instantly killing a survivor from injured just seems a little op. Does the disguise as a survivor have a cool down at all?
---
This is my first time trying to make a meme soo no bully
---
HAS ANYONE NOTICED YUI BLINKS ONLY WITH HER LEFT EYE? I CANNOT UNSEE
---
Oh no, people being able to enjoy the game before sinking 1,000 hours. Yeah, that'd kill it. Not like people usually play games because they're fun.
---
brooooooo that's an idea if I ever heard one
---
You got 49 more days to earn some serum to get them but after they will stay but only available with auric cells .
---
BLOOD SO JUICY
---
Yeah, but gens don't go that fast without stacking one gen, especially with a ruin. So there's that.
---
My heart was racing just WATCHING.
---
Shizaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
---
She has shorter than usual shorts is what ya saying?
---
I'm not getting what you're trying to say... The legion does not need to be in their power for the perk to work. The point is that they will hold their power at 100%, wait to be stunned, and then use it to put you in DW? There is no opportunity to knock them out of their power, they are waiting for after the stun to use it?
---
*Boop*
---
Oh yeah, now I see the "The Survivor is not affected by any effects that are conditional to being inside of a terror radius" in the dev notes.
---
I'm so confused by the legion stuff. Dusclaimer: I am an average killer main on console.
---
I tried him he wasn't great, so I don't have a lot of experiance with him but the internet seems to be filled with Legion is trash memes and everyone DCs when I play legion memes. How/why are both true?
---
Got it second try:
---
First I tried the ghost Wraith which had me very close to a grab twice.
---
Then I switched to Freddy and got it easy.
---
Another good way is show leniency when you are winning, let them do a gen or open the door and when they trust you, grab them for the challenge then let them go
---
Seeing someone's character inventory on their yt lead me to believe they were much more common, as he had 20+ ultra rare keys. I don't have as much bp spent on survivors as I do on killers so I don't really know how it all balances out at p3.
---
Ooooo so will they be available to purchase the entire time? Say I'm on day 48 and don't have enough serum. Can I just buy them?
---
If i didn’t have STBFL he would’ve escaped.
---
The chase depends more on the player than perks. The Clown comparison isn’t accurate.
---
Never seen him before. I just started saying to memes that can literally apply to everyone lol.
---
I wish more than anything on the planet that it actually made that sound in game
---
I don't know how to break this to you. But if your concern is the game being broken, you might be playing the wrong game.
---
I didn't think Beast of Prey was considered super meta or good seeing as you can break bloodlust pretty easily. I'm confused as to why you keep bringing it up.
---
With so many killers to choose from, and the bloodpoint economy as it is. I don't see this becoming the huge problem that first release legion was, because the addons to really make it busted aren't easy to get. You could argue that it doesn't change the balance problem. But Mori's and many purple and pink addons aren't  balanced really either.
---
I don’t believe so. The ptb is a temporary snapshot of the game that has no carryover to live
---
Beast of prey gives undetectable, which means no terror raidius. That means the reason legion got decimated in the first place is back.
---
Dwight lookin more handsome than usual
---
Ahhh, Thanks.
---
OOOOOO
---
Yeah I want to make him original but it’s hard since there’s enough killers. What should the power be?
---
I think a big reason they don't do this is because the killers with interactive objects (Pig boxes, Plague fountains, Freddy clocks, etc.) all count as "chests". Meaning they spawn in places chests can spawn. So if every killer's power or special item was on every map it would really clutter it and take up a lot of space from where chests could spawn if you played a +chest offering.
---
Fun in low ranks* 
---
once u get to purple your gonna have trouble
---
But how focused is she though?
---
Yes but you're never going to be in a position where you can't find a place to use Sprint burst or dead hard. There's windows everywhere for lithe. There's like 2 hills to use BL on unless you get a good map.
---
tip toe
---
It’s cause with dedicated his hitbox was 5 feet behind him still trying to catch up with his character model.
---
This post makes me smile. It’s corny but I take a lot of pride (user flair checks out) in trying not to be toxic to other survivors or killers, because with a competitive game like this, it’s easy to forget the other players are real people. 
---
I play both roles and I follow some basic rules just for myself. 
---
As survivor, I don’t teabag or obnoxiously bait killers with flashlights. I (usually) try to make sure everyone escapes even if it costs me my own escape and if I get a particularly good killer that was fair, or maybe a newer player having a hard time, I’ll leave my item for them as a sign of respect.
---
As killer, I try not to use crazy add-ons or Moris. If I do get a Mori daily, I only Mori dead hook survivors. I don’t camp or tunnel. If someone is insta-saved in front of me, I will hit the unhooked assuming Borrowed Time but will leave them to mend or get picked up, and punish the rescuer, just to slow the game down and give the survivor a chance to rebound. 
---
Of course, players are gonna play how they want regardless and if you bought the game, hey, you’re entitled to. Just a thought though, to remember the other players are people too, and being an overall decent person to them doesn’t go unnoticed.
---
He comin to steal your girl
---
Yes, you can
---
Well it looks like he's on console (unless he's using a controller on PC) and I believe console still don't have dedicated servers, no?
---
&gt; I'm not even gonna bother with a response to that.
---
8 seconds of not being able to move isn't an exaggeration?
---
&gt;That's strike two
---
What's strike one?
---
&gt;I said you have to hit a fresh (healthy) survivor, which is harder than you'd think against survivors who know how to play the game.
---
You very easily get a lot of blood from injured survivors, so them not healing is just your benefit. They worked on a gen? That counts as action and drops extra orbs. If you walk by a gen you gain like 60% of your power.
---
&gt;Uh, yeah, I did.
---
If you noticed the point that he's gaining his power way too quickly for how strong it is, why didn't you address it? Just saying you gain it only from healthy survivors isn't a proper response, as he gains even more blood passively from injured guys.
---
&gt;and if he activates it in a genuinely cramped area, such as the game or a house, OR Hawkins
---
You are thinking of billy here. Those maps aren't bad for Oni because he doesn't care about smashing into walls and has absolute control on his charge direction. https://clips.twitch.tv/HyperMagnificentSkunkBuddhaBar
---
&gt;in an area where it's very hard to see survivors, such as any cornfield
---
Take monitor and abuse and bounce from gen to gen. The survivors don't get to react to you coz by the time they see you/hear your terror radius you are already on them.
---
&gt;Plus, unlike hillbilly, pallets still work against him
---
How are pallets not working against billy? Plus he breaks pallets even faster than billy, you charge the m1 and recover from breaking pallets way faster than billy does, he doesn't need to kick them. [Look.](https://clips.twitch.tv/ObeseSteamyAardvarkRickroll)
---
&gt;Once he does, he's able to pretty much piss on the survivor's day... IF he doesn't waste it
---
So your argument is that the survivor is supposed to not be able to do anything in chase vs him if he uses his power if he uses it in chase? How's that in any way fun or fair for the other side?
---
&gt;He still needs to vault windows as well.
---
Not in his power. You can run around the loop fast enough to get hits with no need to vault.
---
I’m December 20th. Nothing’s worse than a cold birthday and no one coming to see me because Christmas time.
---
Its basically when legion first cam eout he can just keep hittinv you into deep wound and your timer still goes down even when in chase.
---
I had to let the 4th survivor wriggle free twice to get this.
---
SORRY FORGOT CAPS!!
---
Before spirit, legion was the killer to dc against. They had two exploits that made them a nightmare to face. One which added actual minutes to mending time, where you could spend over 5 minutes alone just mending.

The other was the moonwalking exploit where they could follow behind you and just not look at you and you would be downed no matter what you did. Both of these were thankfully patched out with his rework. But the new oni perk is the moonwalking exploit but better on him.

Screenshot before you buy just in case, ptb shouldn't carry over but never trust bhvr

wheats he post?
---
Such a sick cosmetic, I can’t wait.
---
The game has been nothing but fun to me the day I started playing with the mindset "this is just a bad game. Next one will go better". Even if it doesn't, it's easier to accept the loss and get to the next one without being so angry. That's where all the rants/salt comes from in the end. Games far from perfect but for what it is. It's fun.
---
Tunneling is generally seen among the bird people as a dick move, but here's an interesting factoid. You actually get less points from doing it. The more injuring and hooking a multitude of survivors you do the more points you will get. As for the endgame stuff, you kind have to do what you gotta do.  You don't owe survivors a door or hatch, but if there's no hope of escape letting them open the door gives them 1000 points so delaying their doom would be polite.
---
You can only kill them instantly when you are disguised as a survivor and since disguising makes you the same speed as a normal survivor you will have a hard time catching him injured.
---
About the disguise. The disguise will probably have a animation that takes 2-4 sec. But you are right lore wise.
---
*Shock and brain torture
---
1: not giving hatch is ok, people just complain and live for the “overly entitled survivor main”
---
2:Moris are a dick move because they make the game overly one sided and break the base formula of the game and it’s not fun when you lose because you got caught half as many times as a normal game and die instantly. 
---
3: tunneling has lost its meaning. If they unhook in front of you and you down the unhooked person again, that’s not on you. If you are chasing somebody while they are hooked and as soon as you see the unhook you go straight back to the hook to down them again, you are preventing a player from doing anything and are tunneling. Early kills are fine but only if you aren’t ignoring every other player if that person isn’t on a hook. 
---
4: camping hook when the gates are open is kind of a dick move but is generally still justified because, as you said, one guaranteed kill is still better than just letting them get away. 
---
In essence, as a killer player I try to avoid doing these things, if someone unhooked right in front of me I’m going to kill the person who unhooked because they are farming the hooked survivor. I never use moris unless it is the cypress mori (yellow rarity mori) because it doesn’t make the game fair. I give hatch to people I felt had deserved to escape, my criteria varies per game. I don’t camp when exit gates are open because I feel it’s better just to take the L, no reason to sink a little in the salt. You don’t have to do any of these things, killers will be mean and others want to play for everyone. You do you for the most part and they can’t really stop you (camping does cause you to lose bloodpoints but that’s different)
---
I want this to be official now
---
Maybe not clones of "himself" but maybe randomized. Say you play as Frank, you spawn a Susie.
---
Makes it a little bit more believable.
---
They haven’t touched my girl Lithe yet so I don’t think this a prollum
---
Dang, 6k bloodpoints? You guys got shit on, besides that bill.
---
I don't play Mortal Kombat and don't even know what bestgore is but I agree that every mori in this game is extremely underwhelming. They just don't make sense. Like look at The Oni's, he rips their tongue out and bashes their head in which sounds nasty but in reality there isn't a drop of blood or any signs of injury whatsoever.
---
I know people say it's for the ratings board, and fine I guess, but that doesn't make it any less stupid to me. I wouldn't have even bothered making them in that case. It makes everything seem fake.
---
bhvr won’t put that much gore into the game
---
The only pallets you should leave are the unsafe ones.Which don't even matter because they are unsafe.Survivors never leave safe pallets if you dont break them anyways.
---
My game only runs a maximum of 4 Dweets per match.
---
Im new to the game, why is this perk good for legion?
---
I'm probably going to buy him for basically all those reasons.  The addons don't look great but his base power is decent enough without them, so I don't need to worry about running out of addons that I need (like ghostface and power recovery addons, you can play without them, but it's so much more difficult), plague and legion are 2 of the maybe 4 killers I consistently play, and he looks fun, personally.
---
NOED is for beginners, because you get run over when you fieat try killer.
---
After that initial noobiness, a decent player doesn't even give NOED a thought (other then for a meme build)
---
There are so many better perks to get a 4k before the gates are even powered.
---
Ruin though is inevitable, as a killer I feel the whole game is balanced around it.
---
Without NOED, half the killers in the game at least stand no chance of getting a 4k against decent survivorz
---
Wait... you're nice to the little shits?
---
On the flip side though, making them all clones of the killer makes it seem as if he's everywhere, allowing for some great mindplay and allowing psychological pressure to the survivors.
---
Wait hang on, on a serious note; do you guys things gens will get reworked/nerfed? Dont hate me okay. But it's a serious issue with SWF. It's like 2 minutes and 3 gens get done and I've not even seen a single survivor. It's really annoying.
---
No Asylum still has an infinite, coldwind too.
---
Now we finally meet the guy who works for the Houston Asterisks *errrr* Astros.
---
Awesome! Ty guys
---
It would require your teammates be altruistic and take the heat off of you, I would presume. I've had luck doing that with killers multiple times. If the killer is going to tunnel someone down either distract them or work gens as fast as possible. If you can essentially pass the killer around you have plenty of time to mend. Or you do it in burst when you have time.
---
If survivors unhook in front of you without BT, all bets are off. If they want to hook bomb like that they need to bring BT. It’s as simple as that and you should tell them that.
---
I think a compromise is a unique animation where he kinda throws them out to the floor so has the option of picking them up and loosing his power or downing them and slugging
---
Adrenalin for example, dead hard, but that's not really important since you didn't give an answer to my question, you justtried to make a counterquestion to prove a point you haven't made
---
I can prove to you that it doesn't. Would you like to go to a Kill your friends game and check it out?
---
I’m not the best at this game but my friend is really good and I’d just be working on a generator and see him off in the distance laughing as he loops a killer and you can just see the brief period where they stop moving and then the game shuts off lol.
---
LMAO
---
I think it’s more the inertia and memory of how killers used to be. Players have welcomed changes to Freddy that would be obscene on nearly any other killer out of sympathy for how the kit used to be. Conversely, players are scared of Legion buffs because it makes them think of how their kit used to be.
---
I got anxiety watching this
---
Ah damn, really? I’m rank 8 right now, what makes her have issues at lower rank?
---
Sort of but that shouldn't really happen, it only goes down from your rank by 6 ranks to choose survivors.
---
This maybe caused because of the PTB being a thing and everyone leaving live servers though.
---
When survivors are toxic in post game chat i’ve started just telling them that now im going to ebony mori the next set of survivors. Like idk man maybe i cant punish you personally but someones getting hurt and it aint gonna be me ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I literally had it happen to me and am watching a video where someone does it on coldwind even with fucking it up from sept.
---
I had no idea that was the case. Interesting stuff like that is fun to know.
---
Like, how some of the larger bosses in Destiny count as vehicles as opposed to enemies, so you can't complete some bounties by killing them.
---
Cool to know that killer items are coded in tandem with chests.
---
I'm on console :/
---
Ah damn really? I’m rank 8, what makes her have issues at a higher rank?
---
Nemesis + Beast of Prey w/ Stab Wounds Study.
---
Frenzy a survivor and chase them around a loop, disrespecting every pallet. If the run a strong loop, they'll bleed out when bloodlust goes off. If they stun me, they'll bleed out. If they try avoiding either of these scenarios I M1 them.
---
I think animations are honestly the least of my concern right now. After getting a taste of the sound design rehauls, I want new chase music, and ambience. Most maps are completely silent outside of the soft wind howl and footsteps. Give me unique chase music for each killer. Give me ambience on different maps.
---
Speaking of which how do I drop people on console.
---
Yeah but that perk can actually do something without every killer being able to hard counter it by just playing like they often would anyway
---
I see what you mean though, it might have some use and we will see when the DLC releases, but as it is right now, I'm gonna stand by the statement because I really do think it's going to be a meme perk at best
---
Shouldn’t have put this video out the way he did. Makes no mention of his test where he was already the obsession and it didn’t work and the fact that you can simply not stun a killer.
---
This is using two perks to make legion stronger rather than his mechanics being broken. I'm saying it's a lot more situational and I'm not saying I want old legion back, I don't think I said anything that gave the idea I want old legion back. 
---
Beasts of prey requires you to tunnel for tier 1 bloodlust and that only really happens if you refuse to kick pallets. Goes the same with Nemesis, most survivors go down if you tunnel them enough. But it's how much time you devote to getting a single survivor that could lose you the game. I don't know if this was intentional or they didn't think about how it would work Legion and the Obliviousness status effect.   
---
I'm saying it's nowhere near as broken as old legion because of the criteria needed to get the most out of it. It could be countered the same way spirit fury is countered by throwing pallets down early (Or stunning in power.)
---
Gen rushing stops you, you aren't thinking about this game the way I am, every time I play killer I see it as a timer, every second I spend doing an unnecessary action is time that survivors can get gens done, and I just don't have time to worry about getting to bloodlust to catch them especially when you are telling me I should waste a perk slot on something as situational as lightborn, when I could be running a perk to help me catch them faster or slow gen progress.
---
The RAM on my old PC were pretty battered and then gave out completely after 7 years.
---
I was experiencing the exact same problems: frame rate drops when action was heating up as killer
---
Same here. I only have 2 people tagged with it, but it’s saved me a lot of time
---
OR WITHOUT WELL MAKE IT. I HAD A MATCH WHERE I HAD NO HOOKS AND 1 GEN LEFT ALL ALIVE PLAYERS, LOOPED THE KILLER TWICE AWAY FROM THE UNFINISHED GENS AND DIED FIRST AND NO ONE ESCAPED. I SUCK BUT SOLO QUEUE IS IMPOSSIBLE.
---
I love spinechill as a survivor... I DESPISE spinechill as a killer. Good thing I'm a damn good moonwalking ghosty boy.
---
Beast of prey takes 15 seconds of uninterrupted chase to get undetectable, which then starts a 30 second deep wound timer. Thats 45 seconds minimum of having to do nothing but follow a survivor around without breaking pallets or chase. BoP legion is a meme at best
---
Maybe? I'm pretty sure you can still report voice messages but idk about party chat. If I didn't mess up the recording I'd send it off to Sony and see what happens.
---
Killers should not be forced to break chases with survivors bc survivors are abusing a window vault or multiple window vaults that are too strong. 
---
Even without BL. You can still waste the killers time a lot on Haddonfield.
---
I hate that that had to be changed for the noobs to understand that she is vaulting.
---
There was flavour and smart thinking before, now its just awkward and lazy.
---
&gt;The actual head of the survivor is at the end of his weapon for the rest of the match
---
Running around with a Steve head curled into a bloodcurdling scream would be Fucking terrifying for both survivors and the killer
---
It's just Billy with extra steps
---
I could *hear* this holy shit
---
THIS HAS POTENTIAL, THOUGH I’D PERSONALLY LIKE IT TO JUST BE SKMETHING LIKE “REPAIR TO X%, THEN YOU NEED X PART TO CONTINUE REPAIRING”. COULD EVEN MAKE IT SO THAT SPECIFIC “CHECKPOINTS”  IN GEN PROGRESS REQUIRE SPECIFIC PARTS TO INCREASE SEARCH TIME
---
Bruh that’s a awful statement how are you supposed to adapt when you can do anything against legion?
---
IF YOU’RE ON PTB YOU NEED TO DO CUSTOM MATCHES, OTHERWISE YOURE JUST WASTING YOUR LIFE
---
It's certainly a mediocre perk without Enduring, and pretty much needs to be run alongside the latter to be worth its slot, but then it's absolutely not a "joke" or "wasted". I really don't know where you are getting that skewed impression from. Many good players use Fury frequently. It essentially gives you free hits and downs. And even in the worst case scenario where every single survivor in your game predicts that you have Fury and does not ever get into a situation where they have to drop a pallet close to you (which is basically impossible not least because the killer can outplay survivors in ways that lead to them being in a position where they need to drop a pallet or die), Fury leads to them dropping every pallet at least 1 loop early, which is a tremendous time-saving.
---
But this argument was never about whether Fury is actually a top tier perk. I think it is, but even if it weren't, the point that survivors cannot simply avoid stunning the killer stands - and even if *that* weren't the case, the larger point still was of course that this inevitable bleedout interaction is undesirable in itself.
---
Its going to be fun see  how they nerf the weakest killer in the game again
---
I believe the devs are going to do something like:if legion hits the frenzy the Doors gets open and he dies
---
They will probably switch the mend timer to be based off of killer distance instead of terror radius.
---
They are just so much better than me and they keep looping me and the gens get do so fast
---
Just yesterday I played a killer match, &amp; found a survivor hiding in a locker (i knew where to find him bc he fast vaulted in the locker &amp; i got a notificatio ) &amp; when I grabbed him &amp; hooked him (dead on hook) i'm going to the last survivor &amp; I get a message from the locker survivor saying that "there was no way i could have known where he was" &amp; he accused me of hacking lol. He was so sure that the only way i could be notified bout him getting into a locker was if i was super close (i saved the clip) &amp; then when i said distance doesn't matter he continued to say "i've played plenty of killer matches to know" obviously he was dead set on me being a "hacker" &amp; i just told him to have a nice night &amp; went on with myself lol.
---
...you just enable the PTB in the beta tab in the games properties. It has nothing to the with Nvidia
---
Bubba has a cosmetic that lets him say the N word. That’s more than enough.
---
Have a marshmallow billy or some shit
---
Legion mains cry with me
---
What’s the second one?
---
sounds spicy
---
The guy on hook is what really saved the game lol
---
I said that during our little chat because he kept asking it over and over. At first I was like "so I saw you in the background while I kicked the gen then I walked outside and you were still sitting right there" he didn't much like that answer and asked the question again. So I told him "well, I have eyes. That's kind of a basic human ability"
---
I don't think they can make deep wound into a proximity based mechanic because of small maps like the game. If it was proximity based then when you were on those maps it wouldn't really affect you that much since it would almost never start ticking down. Couple that with the function that people can influence what maps they go on and all I can imagine is nobody playing legion because survivors keep bringing people to the game with borrowed time so that the killer is forced to tunnel them down off the hook of they pop the deep wound on them since it wouldn't tick down unless the killer was a fair distance away. I understand that it wouldn't happen every game but it would definitely impact the gameplay more than youd think
---
K-kisama wa... O N I
---
Why would they do that? I don't get it.
---
Why is this so funny
---
I DON'T HAVE FRIENDS THAT WANT ME TO KILL THEM
---
THAT COULD MAYBE WORK. MOSTLY I WANT SOMETHING THAT LETS A GOOD KILLER DELAY PEOPLE WHILE ALSO LETTING A GOOD SOLO SURVIVOR NOT GET COMPLETELY FUCKED BY A BAD TEAM. IT WOULD DEPEND ON HOW IT'S DONE.
---
It’s not for a challenge, it just gives more points
---
What does it do again?
---
I have been wondering the same thing.
---
lmao it’s all fine until you get to lower ranks because people put a lot more time into the game in those ranks and generally care a little too much. and just don’t go to the official dbd forums it’s nothing but a bunch of salty killer and survivor mains arguing with each other.
---
Or just do not stun legion with this perk.
---
Uhmmm. Moonrise Feng
---
People DC because he is boring to play against. You spend the whole game mending because that’s his power. A lot of people enjoy this game because of the killer/survivor interaction, so spending the entire time looking at a loading bar is not fun. 
---
He’s trash because there’s just other killers that are ten times better. Legion is only good with very specific builds, outside of that he won’t slow the game down as much as you’d like. I don’t think he’s god awful, but he’s definitely the least fun to go against. 
---
As far as the new reason to hate him, the new perk Nemesis removes your terror radius against the obsession. Your Deep Wound timer goes down outside the TR. Basically, no matter what, you will go down. He can keep a chase up to make sure you can’t stop to mend, but be far back enough so it doesn’t “count as a chase” (keeping you insight). So either you get hit again or you die from trying to mend since he wouldn’t let you. There’s very limited counterplay at the moment. But that’s why PTB exists :)
---
Remove Legion ;)
---
goddd I’ve gotten so much hate and for no good reason, at that. While playing survivor, i escaped through hatch against a trapper and he messaged me through xbox to tell me that he destroyed my entire team and that he “turned them into dust” and that he would’ve destroyed me too if I hadn’t been hiding the whole match. I told him to chill out and that it wasn’t that serious, and he told me that I had the IQ of a peanut and to finish it off, he told me to put a bullet through my skull. I called him out for being a bit salty, and he told me that he wasn’t being salty at all and that he was just joking. I’ve never read angrier messages in my life.
---
I don't know what a terror radio is, and frankly I don't want to.
---
I've used bloodhound consistently for years now. It's very helpful imo
---
Only because we're forced into it slowly everytime a 4 man SWF uses meta perks to bully the entire game... 40 games in a row.
---
Yeah some people just refuse to believe they got "outplayed" by a legit player. I'll admit when I was a newbie to this game I also messaged a killer asking how he knew I was in the locker. He explained the noise notification to me, I said thanks cause I didn't know that was a thing and went on my way.
---
It doesn't take long to get a single hit on even the best survivors if ur not a noob
---
So I think I love Legion even more now.
---
How is beast of prey balanced for legion then?
---
Dropping it early won't help if Legion has Beast of Prey or Brutal Strength though.
---
ITS NOT THAT, ITS SOMETHING ELSE.  HIS TERROR RADIUS IS VERY QUIET AND HARD TO PICK OUT OF THE OTHER BACKGROUND SOUNDS. ON TOP OF THAT, HIS BREATHING AND FOOTSTEPS ARE SO FUCKING LOUD I CAN SOMETIMES HEAR THEM OUTSIDE OF HIS TERROR RADIUS. HE SNEAKS UP ON MY MORE OFTEN THAT MYERS.
---
Only stupid if you don't understand how rank resets work
---
For honour
---
&gt;But you need to know maps in and out.
---
Basically be a good killer. If you don't know how to mindgame or run loops you wont have fun with pig.
---
Free hits and down, ok. 👌
---
That may be true, but nurse gives you that without giving up points and pips to the survivor.
---
I only see it on rank 8 Billy and maybe the odd wraith at rank reset. Red ranks always have the same 4 perks, and SF is not on that list.
---
Im sorry it is terror radius 😂😂😂
---
The idea is that people being add-ons that help reduce the deep wound timer on legion and this perk, they wait to get stunned or blinded then they activate their power and deep wound the person who stunned them. That person can't mend because if they do they'll get downed by the legions regular attack but the timer also won't stop ticking down since he has no terror radius so the legion can just follow them until they bleed out. The counterplay to that strategy is to not stun them at pallets and use them to extend loops or make the legion play like a regular legion by dropping pallets early or trying to catch them mid power with it. If you drop pallets early, yeah the pallets will be gone faster but that means the legion only has 3 perks and unless they are running a different perk to work with the deep wound strategy then they also have no add-ons either without playing normal
---
Maybe not that exact change. I’m not recommending changes, I’m saying I wouldn’t be surprised. The Legion so far has been a massive disappointing let down of a killer that so far has only been used as an excuse to buff borrowed time repeatedly.
---
People are freaking out because being able to apply Sloppy Butcher to multiple people is what made Legion even somewhat viable (through anti-heal builds). I believe that The Third Seal doesn't work on him anymore either, but I'm not sure.
---
Technically the ugliest oink too, theres only 1 oink.
---
i can see that having a disguised killer is flaw and you are total right. Playing with friends against disguised killers just ruins the gameplay but i just wanted to make this and see if anyone wants a disguise able kiler.
---
I love as a killer when a survivor takes the risk of sitting still hoping i wont see him and when I do, we just stare at each other for a second
---
30 Dweets per second because I'm a filthy switch Dweet.
---
Those ones are the best! When they insist they're not that mad it typically means they're sitting there in their living room absolutely fuming in front of their console.
---
Learn how to lunge? Get a PC?
---
Personally I think pig needs to know all her loops really well if you want to be able to use ambush mind games effectively. But it's still a fair statement. Every killer gets better with a good pilot

---

---
Never called you anything. I generalized.
---
lemme drop this unsafe pallet early. big brain
---
So camping a survivor, is not as toxic as playing against a good team?
---
Blood Echo is pretty legit on Windstorm Wraith since you can keep everyone injured and then constantly cut off the only thing saving them from being downed.
---
Crouching works? Didn't know that. I will keep that in mind.
---
Yeah this is one of those things that's going to be way better on some killers than others. Going against a Doc or Spirit or something, they're way more inclined to leave pallets down. Going against a Brutal Strength Clown, well his entire goal is to break every pallet and you probably won't ever get to use it. And I don't think you're ever going to get to use this on the shack pallet or a jungle gym one, except in certain lucky scenarios where you catch a Huntress reloading or something. They just get broken way too quick for that.
---
Where I'm worried this can become meta is with the 4man SWF teams. Imagine getting stunned, not breaking the pallet and keeping the chase going, and the survivor just has one of his friends sneak over and lift it back up. You get a coordinated enough team and they're going to be able to almost double the amount of pallets they get to use. And I know what you're thinking "just break the pallet", but that's the survivors' whole goal against some killers, force you to run around kicking pallets instead of hooking pple.
---
But wouldn't the buff to the broken status button compensate if not work better than sloppy? People are freaking out over literally nothing.
---
Yeah. Urban Evasion is very powerful against her.
---
WE GOT IN A MATCH WITH A FACECAMPER WHO WAS LIVE ON TWITCH. I PULLED UP HIS STREAM TO HAVE HIM SAY "MAKE MISTAKES AND GET PUNISHED". I KNOW HE PROBABLY DOESN'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF A DICK HE WAS BEING BUT IT WAS THE LEAST FUN GAME WE HAD EVER PLAYED....
---
Honestly I'd be fine with deep wound if legions did something extra like slow the survivors speed down the lower the timer got. It's weird that they took a perk that buffs the survivors and made it into a killer power with little changes to it to make it different enough. BT is really useful right now (except against Freddy but even that I'm okay with since there needs to be hard counters to mechanics in multiplayer games) but since they keep changing deep wound as a whole it just keeps nerfing legion since they just keep buffing BT. the oblivious aspect to it honestly doesn't seem that bad to me since the only other option is to completely ignore the person that got unhooked until that timer goes away and it's just weird to me that in the idea of this game the killer would just leave them alone until then
---
Ik what the perk does but i sadly dont know what the oblivious status means, can someone explain
---
There is also a big difference betwern DDR3 and DDR4, if he is running DDR3 with less than 8GB that would be his problem, no doubt.
---
Except clown’s gas doesn’t slow him, hag’s traps don’t trigger when she walks,
---
If you're at low-rank, the Killers usually won't be that great. If you're at high-rank, you should have somewhat competent teammates that will run distraction builds, especially since those builds are quite popular.
---
I die a little when I play Demo or Doctor and the fps drops to like 10 during a chase.
---
I kind of like that this power deactivates it. I feel its a nice counterplay and its nice to have a dedicated slugging killer.
---
His power is already a map pressure one shot that basically cannot be escaped from once found, unless you have a thicc rock to run around, and pray to god theres a pallet there because there is almost 0 recovery time from missing. If you chose to run after the rock he just m2's to you again and if he somehow misses and your not at a window/pallet he can just walk up to you and m1 with an instadown lunge that takes 1 second to charge. Forcing him to leave survivors on the ground or lose his power is perfect imo.
---
Speaking as someone who played him for the first time after watching how his power works and got a 4k by slugging instadown then rotating the map, then played survivor and got a 4k escape on him because every time he downed someone he chose to pick them up.
---
Matchmaking goes in waves of 6, so you can kill or be killed by anyone 6 up, or 6 down from you. And I can't confirm or deny this, but I have a feeling that it widens that reach the longer you search for a match.
---
You're thinking of the wrong perk, the one shown is nemesis. The icons for them look pretty similar so I get why that happened
---
I'd Suggest the Vommy Mommy or Ghostface.
---
I know!! he turned his console off after that conversation, he probably needed to cool down a bit lmao
---
It also happens on pc, nobody wants to play killer LMFAO..but yea, game is perfectly fine.
---
You can’t perceive the terror radius.
---
Go to desktop. Right cllick. Display settings. Under scale and lay out it has size of text and apps. I have that problem too sometimes. hope this helped
---
But the context here is that the killer was slugging everyone and refusing to hook them, so crawling away isn't a victory, since the killer was abusing the new DC rules and wasting more than 4 minutes of the survivors' time. (Matchmaking, lobby wait, loading, leaving match)
---
Im liking this and even if they say no to making it a natural thing i feel like they should at least be add-ons
---
Makes your obsession oblivious.

Idk it's what I'd do. If they wiggled off next to the hatch I'd just assume it's a sign from god that this guy needs the hatch
---
Nemesis gives the survivor who stuns The Legion the oblivious effect, which means they can't hear his terror radius. This affects the deep wound timer. Basically, if Nemesis activates and The Legion puts you into deep wounds he can follow you while your timer ticks down which removes any chance of surviving that chase as he'll either stab you again or let you bleed out.
---
I think he means that the loops that you will be able to use this perk on will be unsafe loops in general, and bringing the pallet back isn't that impactful because having the pallet still gives the killer an opportunity to hit you. Pallets that are strong get broken immediately. It's still a good play, and a weak pallet is better than no pallet, but 99/100 times you won't be able to bring a game changing loop, like a jungle gym, back into play.
---
Okay new to this sub, why do killers want the final survivor to get away??
---
I dont have a single issue with good survivors :) I love the stress of a good, hard team to play against! I'm talking about the 4 man who uses perks to bully, not play. Theres a massive difference.

Nemesis + Enduring = Stonks

Its more because as a pig player you literally never want to use ambush outside of the initial start of the game where they don't know its pig and aren't expecting it. 
---
The moment they know its pig they are rotating around 24/7 looking for grass movement and are running at the first sign of an oink.
---
Can someone fill me in?
---
Ah shoot, thx for telling me

The thing is they could just use the pallet early and force the legion to break it or vault over, if they vault over they don't get to use that perk and are down to 3 plus most people in this comment section are talking about taking the deep wound add-ons with it too and then it's either the legion has to wait until they get stunned to use their power which means they waste their add-ons and power until that happens, or they just play like a normal legion and occasionally get the combo to work well when someone doesn't counterplay it, but that's how it should be. If you don't try to play against it and then it gets used on you, why would you complain about it? Same applies to the killer logic of DS being broken, there's counter play to it since you just have to leave them on the ground, but then people get angry when it gets used on them when they don't respect it. Yeah sometimes the situation makes it unavoidable to counter but that happens regardless of how buffed or nerfed a perk is
---
Didn't he just move? 
---
I mean, we gave our dogs to our grandparents when we moved, but it's not like we fucking gave them *away*...
---
Np, I didn't realize which perk it was at first either until I saw people talking about it in the comments
---
Since my first video got a lot of traffic I decided to make a Killer Lore series!
---
Can someone explain why Nemesis is so good on Legion? I'm not seeing the function.
---
This is literally what “Legion Bad DC Good” was all about. Please don’t shine broken combos as a balanced thing.
---
Beast of Prey is not a balanced perk on Legion and I will not make an argument that it is.
---
Can't wait to get fucked on console by old legion.
---
Can we please just change how legions ability? And accept he is by far one of the worst on the roster?. Seriously who thought it was a good idea to give him an ability that can be self cleansed
---
#trueswine
---
Legion aspires to be half as strong and powerful as big bad Oni. For now, they will suckle from the teat of teachables until Behavior crushes the perks and has to rework Legion.
---
Do you have any idea how hard it is to play a game with 3 people body blocking me on my way to the hook, teabagging at every pallet, taking hits with BT just to show that I cant catch them, DSing out of a locker just to jump back in and use head on to get a good laugh... all to just GG EZ me at the end? It gets old. And I'm not complaining about people who use these perks and play the game properly. I'm also not making up rules about what  I think people should bring to the game (unlike the survivor rule book). I'm talking solely about the toxic shits who come to  b u l l y. Not play. Save your dislikes, children.
---
I wish I could give this gold
---
The most annoying one to me is Leatherface. He sticks the chainsaw through you and yanks it up like his MKX fatality, but you stay intact somehow
---
It was before his move. It was a few months back. She was chewing up his chords and stuff and he didn't have the time to burn away her kitten energy. His parents have a cat and luckily the cats got along when he brought her with on a trip (because he couldn't leave her alone) so he made the decision to give her to them
---
please mr bhvr let legion be good for just one patch
---
That would take more time than it's worth at that point. It goes from being a potential 15 second chase with the right circumstances to an extended chase to get bloodlust and hopefully not need to break any pallets or hit another survivor until you get the stack
---
I never said it was broken or op, I just explained how Nemesis combos well with Legion.
---
I'm not excusing it. I am telling you why for them it makes sense. I agree with you completely that they should just work on the maps instead, but sadly this is a really bad developer that doesn't know how to properly make a game so even just that is asking for too much.
---
I usually get chased and try to escape that way. I'm only rank 10 at survivor but, on this video, i had nowhere to run to without getting caught - sitting still felt like the safer option. I don't do that often and it usually doesn't really work
---
Spirit Fury is not as prevalent because it requires two perk slots which players often just do not want to invest into chase perks anymore, with the meta having shifted more toward Barbecue, Ruin and Weasel being lock-ins. But it still sees a lot of use, and is particularly common to be seen on Billy, Leatherface, Wraith, Pig, and Demogorgon.
---
His pecs are drool worthy.
---
Alright so heres the menu music from the new killer Oni! Thought I might as well post this one too! Enjoy!
---
What are gis abilities and perks?
---
K thanks
---
I completely forgot that Jane was Hispanic.
---
I'll come and see you. We can play Dead By Daylight. 
---
(งツ)ว
---
Oni can get absolutely bullied in the early game. He's a base killer with no power at the start, and good survivors can give base killers hell with the right builds or on the right map. Basically, if you have a bad start as Oni, you're toast. This is why Billy maintains superiority. His power is always ready, no buildup required.
---
Yikes
---
I'm not saying you said it was broken or op, I'm sorry if it came off that way. I'm just trying to explain to people the potential counterplay to it since there's a lot of people in the comments acting like there's absolutely none and that this breaks the game entirely. Plus I figured that in telling the person what the strategy is they should also know the potential way to counter that strategy in case they go against it
---
I’m sorry, but what’s up with legion now? I thought he was just nerfed a day ago, but now he’s “op”? I know it had to do with the nemesis perk, but could someone fill me in?
---
Pipping is also slightly easier on Oni than Billy.
---
New addition to the entitled survivor rulebook “Keller’s are not allowed to look for survivors with their eyes” lol
---
Don't you dare call my precious Oink the ugliest. &gt;:(
---
\*Intense  opera singing starts
---
You don't have enough iri shards for it?
---
Turn those parts into another survivor
---
Don’t jinx it. BHVR does what BHVR wants
---
U right
---
Killers don’t always look for a 4K and might give hatch to a particular survivor they liked, or because they had a good time.
---
You safe the best for last stack
---
Hand them over
---
I was thinking the exact same way, that’s why I think when a key opens the hatch, it should close right after the survivor jumps in, and maybe an add-on that allows other survivors to use it after. I’d be lying if I said I haven’t gotten sandbagged because some douche opened that hatch and the killer closed and a door camped.
---
Nah it’s cool dude. I agree with you tbh, good perk for Legion but there’s enough counter play yo make it balanced enough.
---
Ma boy is back! *screams*
---
It's a possibility - I have 8 GB and, just looked it up, it is in fact DDR3. Might be the reason here. It was fine running DBD in like 2017 (same RAM, another GPU though), but resource requirements then and now may no longer compare?
---
Ruin what, a disgusting mechanic? lol
---
It's literally only on stun. Beast of prey is much worse
---
Wow it's like everyone with a brain who read the legion changes and then saw the perk balance changes and the oni's perks and knew legion was back and not nerfed..
---
Only took you guys a quick dick sucking of Otz to realize it.
---
Bless this man for releasing a video though. I don't want old legion back lol
---
BONK! why does this sound like it's from the simpsons?
---
Aint gonna stop people killing themselves on hook, just gonna take longer. If someone wants to DC they're gonna
---
Oh man, I musta linked the wrong video
---
Actually found the sweet spot between 5-10 to be the least toxic. Less facecamping, less sweating from both sides. Little to no t-bagging (that I notice).
---
I've been playing for about the same amount of time (March 2017?) and loathe it when I dont play for a few months and have to deal with r14-20.
---
Then playing solo in r1-4 you deal with Killers who must at all costs get the 4K no matter how unenjoyable the game becomes and survivors who will screw you over at the slightest opportunity.
---
&gt; Lots of heterophobes are scared of downvotes lmao. Go to r/politics/ with lgbt SJW shit.
---
&gt; Stop with that homo propaganda.
---
Honestly, I'd take 1,000 Paper Plate Legion costumes over one more post of your worthless, homophobic horseshit.
---
you need to get the stun on unsafe pallets to make distance. you dont get the stun and you drop it, you die
---
Nah
---
Always when bloodlust kicks in
---
You’re right the post is about Nemesis. The fundamental problem is legion being able to chase while being undetectable. Both perks accomplish that. I think nemesis is getting more attention because it’s new.
---
How do you manage to play Killer? I exited the game in frustration in the end.
---
Unfortunately you can’t just block someone on psn and then you won’t get them in your games. No, you will. 
---
I’ve had countless of bad messages and fights and party chat fights. My 2 favorites are when this Michael face camped me and we fought to the absolute death and were so mean- he kept doing it until one day he said he saw my Instagram and that I am the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen??????? He told me to die. 
---
Or when I was relatively new, and I was being chased and ran passed a teammate. She got so mad (in game) she sent me a chat invite and cussed me out saying i brought the killer to her. They all grouped up and left me to die on hook. I really hate that bitch to this day lol
---
Learn from the experience
---
Yea the tracking is nice but the blood orbs are really annoying after not collecting them for a while. He's quite map dependant due to the charge being useless sometimes. The instadowns are pretty hard to get due to the sensitivity increase right before the hit easily fucking up your swing. He's definitely strong if you train. A good killer, amazing in the right hands
---
RIP whitewoods beachwalk
---
Explain what you mean, you worded that question in a weird way.
---
Both are still cool.
---
I wish more guys were like you
---
*Joseph later fights Wammu before taking the antidote and burns his bandanna in the kars fight*
---
"looping"
---
there
---
that's why
---
what’s the point of obsession?
---
What is this from?
---
Guys, come on, Hispanic is different from Spanish.
---
You know what would be really cool? A Spanish bullfighter as killer. I'd love to pallet the fuck out of that guy's face.
---
They figured if its a cool-down perk all of the effects should be on cool-down
---
They said a long while ago that they wouldnt animate the moris to do the damage on survivor models. So billys and wraiths idea is a no go, and yes theyve gone against their word before but til this day moris do nothing to the models so i dont think they will until they rework how moris work in general
---
YTers aren’t the norm, they’re the exception; the average player will probably only have like 5-7 keys (personally I have 4 in total).
---
Why is everyone saying that this shouldn't be patched? Legion was nerfed because of the moonwalking exploit and now players want to return to the same exploit? Excuse me wtf
---
I assume the reasoning is because it's the only exhaust perk that has benefits after exhausted so they made it work like the rest.
---
Just when I thought I could deal with some slight buffs to Legion everyone is going to DC against them again.
---
If he is stunned with Nemesis, the stunner is now Oblivious and hears no Terror Radius. Legion goes in to a chase with the stunner, procs Feral Frenzy, slashes the stunner, and continues chasing the stunner. While still in the chase, there is still no terror radius so the mend timer now goes down unlike in a normal chase.
---
Well looks like I'm changing to legion again
---
Ryūjin no ken wo kūrae!
---
That means enduring and spirit fury is a good combo on him then.
---
It's kind of a gamble, honestly. Like personally, it's been 50/50 to me. People say lower ranks are less toxic, but even at lower ranks you can run into pissy little babies after chat. XD
---
THIS IS THE LAST OF MY MEDKIT!
---
TAKE IT, DWIGHT!
---
Glad they nerfed prayer beads, and seems to be a decent way about it. Keeps it a purple add-on, but now you at least know bullshit is happening instead of having to guess.
---
the point is all the interactions with the perks
---
Yeah, she should float like nurse.
---
People dont like single player experiences in their multiplayer game. The only reason to play survivor is chase interaction with the killer. Nemesis/Beast of Prey “soft chase” Legion means there is no killer/survivor interaction. 
---
He keeps mentioning Beast of Prey because it has the undetectable status effect when you reach bloodlust one which means you will guarenteed go down when a Legion reaches bloodlust one on you. 
---
You dont need any add ons to do this...you simply get undetectable/oblivious status effect and wait out the timer. They literally cannot do anything about it. Its really not that hard to understand how stupid this is.
---
Survivor rulebook for killers #249: when there is one survivor left and the killer picks said survivor up. When he finds the hatch before he can hook said survivor, the killer needs to give that survivor the hatch.
---
&gt;I didn't think Beast of Prey was considered super meta or good seeing as you can break bloodlust pretty easily. I'm confused as to why you keep bringing it up.
---
He is bringing it up because in the new patch Beast of Prey gives undetectable status effect when activated, removing the killer terror radius.
---
You argued that Nemesis Legion has counterplay because survivors can avoid stunning the killer so it wont activate. However, Survivors cannot realistically prevent Legion from hitting them in frenzy and then just following them until their bloodlust activates. Beast of prey will activate, and then the survivor will automatically go down after the deep wound timer ticks down.
---
Legion is my favorite killer, but survivors are right to be pissed about this. There is not sufficient counterplay to Legion using Beast of Prey and just following you until you go down. That isnt fun or interesting gameplay for either side.
---
5 months later..identity V still kicking ass,honestly its a great game
---
This sounds like the best answer, kinda sad having to accept it though
---
bhvr powercreeped a killer with DLC lmfao
---
Was there a reason why they won't do gore?
---
They're really gunna launch an awesone killer I want to play the same day Halo MCC comes out for PC? I CAN'T POSSIBLY CHOOSE
---
I dont want bhvr to nerf my boy but I honestly dont understand how people are defending this lol, it was the reason that legion got the rework, from the posts I've seen im shocked that people want to keep this god-awful "mechanic" instead of getting some significant buffs
---
In haddonfield the perk allowed for infinite’s. Basically the fall reduction allowed anyone to just keep running into houses in haddonfield and create an actual infinite loop. They couldn’t fix the map right away so they nerfed the perk to prevent it from happening
---
Game's definitely not balanced around 4 stacks, if it was then several perks (bond, empathy, kindred, knockout, etc) wouldn't exist.
---
You throw down a pallet and now the Legion bloodlusts you around it and you still guarenteed go down. How hard is it to understand that this takes all the skill out of a chase? Theres no game to be played when a Legion exploits this.
---
FUCKING SPOILERS REE
---
Thanks, satan
---
It's actually best on Plague and Legion, because people tend to stay injured vs. them.
---
Oh, I get it now. You just bleed out in a chase. Only a great escape or good body blocking and distracting from teammates will help, and those can't really be counted on
---
They decided that they wanted to make harvester useless, and thought it would fix haddon and pantry. it doesnt.
---
it's the fastest they've announced it.
---
Well you could say shes both in first and last place
---
His power is just to fling insults at people
---
All this time i thought it made you a bit slower
---
Yeah idk, im all aboard for some legion buffs but this is not the fucking way to do it
---
He turns them into an idiot sandwich, yells at them then stabs them
---
Why would you listen to a opponent you are trying to beat? What other online game has a person tell you how you have to play them? I'll unpack this for you. There is a high number of very for the lack of a better word entitled players. Would a cat stop chasing a mouse because he doesn't like it? No! I bet if a mouse could talk it would try to convince a cat not to eat it Everytime. So my advice is do your best to play fair.  Hook camping and tunneling is looked down upon as both killer and survivor mains. However. No one is going to play how you wanted. If they send toxic shit your way just remember that is them trying to change how you play so they don't have to change how they play. I think we have Survivors who blow things way out of proportion. Seriously how many times do you die to a NOED a day? I think I get way way way more kills using nurses calling then fucking NOED. Think about how many people DC on you. Do they care about your fun? No. They don't even care about the people they ditched in that game. Best advice is play how you want. Don't benever read pomust post out in GG. No one is ever going
---
It made too many drop loops abusable. Some maps need reworks and still do but balanced landings passive effect made them all worse
---
You acknowledge you have a choice
---
booop
---
This also seems right, but you can still get huge loops without it in some places
---
Where is my David sweater :(
---
Ngl a legion running both Beast of Prey and Nemesis to have no terror radius in a chase and get a guaranteed down through deep wound sounds pretty bs to me. I wouldn't DC against it but it would definitely make me not want to play - like when MoM came out and there would be like 3 -4 in a match. I mained Wraith around this time and it didn't feel good at all to have any chance of winning shut down cause they were running one perk.
---
Sure! Deep wound ticks down when survivors are not within Legion's terror radius. Nemesis triggers when a survivor stuns or blinds Legion, and gives that survivor the Oblivious status effect for 40 seconds. This prevents them from hearing the terror radius heartbeat, which means that even if they are close to Legion their deep wound will tick down.
---
Basically, Legion can get a frenzy hit and then if you pallet stun or blind them, your deep wound timer will start ticking down and you will bleed out and fall down while they follow you.
---
The same thing will happen if Legion uses the new Beast of Prey which gives them the undetectable status when their bloodlust activates. They can hit with frenzy and then just follow until bloodlust activates and your deep wound starts ticking down.
---
I was able to go out and find this photo, make it into a meme, post it, and it’s still searching for a match
---
No that’s Hindered
---
Also your RAM may just be getting old and slower
---
Legion doesn’t chase while undetectable with Nemesis. They chase a survivor that is oblivious. There’s a difference. 
---
But more to your point, that’s not necessarily a problem. The oblivious effect doesn’t happen automatically after X amount of time without activating power, breaking pallet, or hitting survivor, as with undetectable on Beast of Prey. It happens when the survivor that is not the obsession activates the perk by stunning the killer with anything not a flashlight. These are differences that can’t just be ignored.
---
Dude I made a post about this broken combo and got downvoted into the ground. People apparently want old legion back. Idk why
---
Oblivious prevents you from hearing the heartbeat. So even if you are right next to Legion, if you are Oblivious and have deep wounds your deep wound will tick down until you fall down.
---
Bam bam from flintstones maybe ?
---
I WANNA HAVE FUN WITH THE GAME AND ENJOY MYSELF BUT IT GETS SO HARD WHEN OTHER PEOPLE ARE MEAN AND ANNOYING AND UNHOOK ME IN FROMT OF THE KILLER AND DON T HEAL ME ANS THEN I GET TUNNELED!!!! IT S DUMB BUT IT S THE LITTLE THINGS THAT ADD UP JUST PLAY TUE GAME IN A NICE FASHION I M TIRED AND WANNA HAVE FUN!!!!!
---
Well damn, start grinding lol.
---
You put like 0 effort in it why are you so pissed lol.
---
I have pretty much the same experience. When i need to get into a match fast, i just play survivor. in less than a minute i'm normally in a lobby. 
---
they really need to incentivize more people to play survivor so killers can get into lobbies faster.
---
You know that thing where white people think all asians look the same? Yeah. That's been happening alot here lately 🙄
---
The deep wound timer is legions power. BT also gives deep wound but it's useful to survivors, so it's weird that legions power is the same function as a perk designed to help the survivors
---
Dammit every time I try to break from nea BHVR releases a really cool fucking skin for her
---
Oh, I agree it'd be good for them to do it, but I can see why they won't.  Especially with how they're handling the Archives' challenges for the second level, the next two tomes are probably going to be super grindy.
---
yea, been using this since that new jake glowy skin came out, they look great together. I use the green pants from the Rift Jake outfit though.
---
I don't think you read the description right.
---
"The Legion Pin add-on: Hitting a Survivor highlighted by Killer Instinct applies the Broken status effect for 60 seconds."
---
The first person you stab doesn't get broken. These add ons are hardly better than they were before. Not to mention, being forced to run an add-on to achieve what you could before without one, is a straight nerf.
---
Ahh, remember when NOED was viable, back before the Emblems made it punish you to one shot a survivor. Good times
---
I love that the main complaint is misunderstanding "most killer share the same basic abilities..." as if it doesn't mean they are pretty much all just M1 and loopable for the most part. Lol
---
I love this as a survivor as much as I do a killer. I laugh *every* time they catch me and just stare.
---
One of my favorite subtle differences is that Billy can quickly turn at the start of his sprint. Oni can quickly turn at the end. Completely changes how each is used.
---
&gt;just don't use pallets unless you're dropping them super early
---
You don't need to do it when they're a full 32m away, just before they're in stun range
---
What's SSS?
---
This was posted a few days ago aswell lol
---
As a killer main, I really fucking hope this gets fixed. Asap. Its broken and ridiculous
---
More specifically I think they did it so that they could create the new map. Have you seen it? It has tons of drop off points from the looks of it. So without taking that affect away from BL they would have greatly limited themselves on making maps of that type in the future.
---
I Maine’s GF up until the most recent patch. Been playing a lot more survivor but if I do play killer I’ve been playing Billy. No need to hear them when his kit works wonders with whispers.
---
Oh nvm it was the kid facecamping not dcing my bad.
---
what are gonna be my perksim gonna be a new quentin?
---
32 meters is a bit far but radius would be the best solution
---
What's the MTTF for these usually? Might be around 4 years now, with easily a year of disuse in between, so it's not that old... or is it?
---
Reminds me of the time some 12 year old called me a pussy over a voice message because I had Franklin’s lol
---
No, he just felt bad Bc a player DCd and we still had all 5 gens an tier 3 ruin
---
I don’t think the issue is not enough survivors I think it’s more not enough people playing killer. I get matched with the same two killers every match and it really takes the spice out of the game
---
I’m a little sad the survivor head doesn’t get visibly bashed in
---
That would just make it easier for Legion to tell when a Survivor is nearby.  Basically free Whispers.
---
HOW IS THAT BEHEMOTH SNEAKING UP ON YOU THEN WITH IF YOU CAN HEAR HIS LOUD ASS FOOTSTEPS AND BREATHING???
---
Do we get saved progress in the archives from the ptb?
---
It's a bit of an unspoken rule that you heal the injured guy who saves you off the hook first. Like, not everyone does it, but its an expected part of survivor manners nonetheless, like opening a door for someone in the real world.
---
At least that's what I thought until you now pointed out there is an achievement involved. Now I think everyone is just selfish.
---
I’ll occasionally do Bubba’s basement for the memes. I really don’t care if people think it’s scummy.
---
I WANT MY 4 TRAP ACHIEVEMENT CAN U GUYS PLS NOT DISCONNECT
---
I wasn't aware of the beast of prey changes. My bad. 
---
I can potentially see how that could be an issue but given the legion is being nerfed seemingly to compensate...
---
Those are still 2 pretty big conditions, pallet stuns or bloodlust. I feel like there are ways to break legion out of those states, but if legion wins shoot up in testing I reckon Bhvr will change one of both of those perks.
---
Today I was a huntress going against an adept Adam.  He kept waiting at pallets and I would Hatchet him at everyone, at one point in the game he was unhooked I came to the area saw him in middle of my screen as he threw the pebble, ignored it and downed him again.  After the match he said “gg eazy” when he died and only got like 14k bo compared to my 28k bp.  
---
Also in a different match as huntress got lucky and found a survivor in locker while going for hatchets.  He/she dc’d and called me a hacker.  I love it.
---
You grouped my comments in with "spoiled survivor mains" which couldn't be further from the truth. You can't just say "it was a generalization bro" and take no ownership of your misleading remarks. You also (probably purposefully) failed to respond to any of the points I raised in return.
---
ruin is becoming nothing. you might as well not run it because it either gets popped instantly or they work through it. it's been run so much people are learning to work through it lol, I know i have
---
NOOOOOOOOO!! Not Dwight!! 😭
---
he seems fun to play so im definitly getting him, for fun and for the achievements. also i really like the potential of the nemesis perk since i have the most fun playing stealthy, for them jump scares and this can give a stealthy aproach to normally not so stealthy killers.
---
i would also really like to play a bit, with  'breakout'  and 'any means necessary' from the survivor.
---
I was playing Friday the 13th the other day and I had to punch a hole in a second person's chest just to take another screenshot of Jason's mask through the hole before he drops the body.
---
&gt;I honestly wouldn't classify this as a spoiler, since it's just a character animation. 
---
what
---
thst doesn't sound like a swf issue that sounds like you need to work on your tracking and locating abilities
---
interesting. on PC i can get into a survivor lobby in less than two minutes, but a killer match takes at least 5-10 minutes. What platform you on?
---
that's why we're *waiting* for them, yeah.
---
I liked their pre-emblem set up, it was based on how many hooks/sacrifices you got. 1 for each hook/stage, 2 for the sacrifice, (4 per survivor) and only got 1 point for a bleed out. 6-8 pips for safety.
---
I’m on PC. By the way I’m still searching for a match.
---
Of course people do. A survivor can choose to be a toxic prick, and so can a killer. It just depends on who it is.
---
Thats what i was getting at this entire time lol, thank you.
---
I can see both together being an issue because to break a killer out of bloodlust you would nromally go for a stun, or a juke. But this does add niche case on top of niche case.
---
I do think Bhvr might just be a little trigger happy with their new status effects.
---
Its been i want to say about 2 years since what im referencing but i think it had something to do with the engine?
---
Not hate for being good, but for being really bad.
---
I'm a survivor main but hopped into PTB to try out the Oni...had to sit in queue for around 20 minutes, so I eventually got up to make coffee, and came back a few minutes later to realize I had gotten a game which started.  I try catching up, but it was my first game as killer that day, and I'm really bad, so it did not go well.  During the end game collapse I downed 3 of the 4 survivors but left them alone so they could all escape.  I was met with shit talking in post game lobby about how trash I am at the game.  I was rank 16 vs two rank 5s, a green rank, and a yellow rank.  
---
It really just makes the whole game very unenjoyable.
---
I know more than one language to curse in.
---
That would be because its made by another developer, who have different rules then behaviour. Also i honestly didnt know that game was still a thing, didnt it get shut down because of copy right?
---
i could definitely be wrong, but if it isn't an issue or raw players (four survivors to one killer), then maybe it's a regional thing?
---
anyway, good luck! if you wait another three hours, maybe i'll see you when i get home and load up a match!
---
Aww that’s nice, thank you!
---
Demogorgon screaming YOU FUCKING DONKEY! *Proceeds to engulf head*
---
So then the poor people who you end up taking your frustration out on will simply get pissed themselves, and queue up with a full meta build and keys the next match. Toxicity only breeds more toxicity, and this shit never ends.
---
The feng mafia will not stand for this
---
Okay I agree with you there are differences in how the perk activates, but I think most people would argue it’s better to fix legion than the perk. They just need to replace the deep wound so the developers don’t have to worry about perks that apply the oblivious status effect.
---
In terms of specifically Nemesis, I agree with all your points. I just think there is a bigger problem overall with legion’s character design.
---
I’m gonna play a ton of PTB so I can game on Halo without feeling like I’m missing stuff  :p
---
I like the feature and would prefer to have it, but you just actually gave an incredibly good reason not to let people see other survivors ranks. If people start dodging lobbies then the feature is doing more harm than good. Imagine if the Killer had the same information. Why would ever take a match that has survivors three or more ranks above their own?
---
Go past hooks obviously so they know you are going to find the hatch.
---
I think he’s top 10 but definitely not top 5. His power is pretty good but if people don’t heal then he only has the demon dash at his disposal. This also has the effect of good tracking if they don’t heal because they will constantly leave blood orbs. There’s lots to like about him but he’s not the strongest killer, he’s very fun though.
---
Body blocking isn't even remotely close to effective against a legion with this build. He doesnt need to hit you aside from his initial feral frenzy hit, he just needs let you bleed out and simply follow you while you do so. If you have a teammate following along for the ride then you clearly aren't in high ranks because they don't know what they're doing. And a distraction build? What? If old legion wants you down, you're going down. Do you even know what old legion was?
---
Nope, just dead.
---
The trap was just double checking to make sure it wouldn’t come off.
---
[deleted]
---
What're you asking
---
It's true
---
I've never seen a survivor expect hatch
---
I know, I've been getting shit on for saying this mechanic is stupid. I think it's just people who don't know what old legion was.
---
YOU'RE FINDING PLANTS AROUND THE CAMPFIRE TO MAKE YOUR TINCTURE. NOT SURE WHY YOU WOULD THINK THAT MEANS IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE.
---
Agreed. Legion needs a reworked power to be fun to play as and against, not more annoying bullshit that got them nerfed into dust to begin with.
---
Or making choice equal by nerfing how strong one particular perk can be, especially compared to other perks.
---
4 years could go either way, it also depends some on how full your computer is, how old the motherboard is, and a few other factors. Regardless, upgrading should fix the problem I believe.
---
Demogorgon is so expressive with camera movement that I’m sure he knew you were sorry.
---
THERE’S MANY PEOPLE IN THIS COMMUNITY IN THE SAME SITUATION, YOU COULD MAKE A “LOOKING FOR” POST TO FIND SOME PEOPLE
---
Whether you liked it or not, it was dbd related and the mod removal was unnecessary. I'm only upset because I'm calling out the shitty moderating for picking and choosing what they deem fit.

It takes all the skill out of the chase and it's still the worst way to get someone if you have a full survivor team, bloodlusting wastes a lot of time. It's good for newbies, bad for experienced survivors. 
---
I'm not saying it isn't broken, I'm saying it's not as op as old legion. This only really works with nemesis and if you get stunned. Blood lusting in any situation takes the skill out of a chase no matter who you're playing against. Getting massive speed for not ending a chase quickly I'd the noed of chases. I'm saying there's more counterplay. You can lose a chase momentarily with a legion not using his power, that resets beast of prey.
---
But it's not as bad as old legion at all. There's still counterplay. This only sucks because it's going to turn legion into a tunnel killer, he'll benefit from tunneling where most other killers it's a trade-off.
---
It's like bubba insidious hook camping.

I cannot wait to use my 45+ Frank's Mixtapes and Stab Wound Studies.

What do you mean by ruin?
---
It will be fixed in the next patch, according to the notes in the stickied post.
---
Imagine thinking he's OP when he actually has to work for his power
---
Lookin at you, Billy
---
i dont get how u can down someone with feral frenzy, even if theyre oblivious. doesnt oblivious just mean they dont see your red stain or hear your noise/heartbeat?
---
I‘ve started playing killer again myself so I can understand the frustration, but bodyblocking, using a flashlight, or using perks like head on isn‘t toxic as much as is it survivors trying to survive and help their friends. Just ignore the gg ez and toxic remarks, drop a gg and they‘ll be mad cuz you didn‘t give into their trolling.
---
I mean someone over at BHVR has to have thought about this right? Like cmon? I think the Legion Nerfs were in anticipation of this perk. Sure the decreased timer doesnt matter to the person getting nemesised, but everyone else can heal while he downs them
---
Maybe most people would argue that. Maybe they wouldn’t. I don’t see how that’s relevant. 
---
Or the devs could design perks that incorporate the oblivious status effect and do so in a way that incorporates counterplay. Like Nemesis! They’ve got a lot on their plate.
---
Maybe there is a greater overall problem w feral frenzy. I don’t necessarily agree or disagree, but I do think it can be (and has been) improved without a total rework like Freddy received.
---
I dony get it. Nemesis doesnt take the terror radius off when getting stunned does it?
---
Traitor
---
Tbh that sums it up perfectly
---
So tru
---
I was expecting a Scout soundpack for him.
---
Hard to get kills with 4 dc's :)
---
He zaps more than just survivors  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Lad
---
It doesn’t take too long (in my opinion) but most Legions will run Sloppy Butcher  and Thanatophobia, as well as the purple add on that increases mend time. So if Legion is just constantly going back and forth between his power, it just gets annoying to deal with. 
---
As soon as he leaves you, it’s easy to just start mending on go back on a gen. And then the gen will be slower because of Thanat, and heals will take longer because of Sloppy. So really he slows down the game with very specific builds, outside of that, Legion is not as effective while simultaneously just being boring to play against.
---
Honestly, people bitch about all killers running ruin, but you kind of HAVE to if you don't want to get l lose gens in 6 minutes.
---
So they nerfed Legion, ruining him in general, to prepare for this.
---
This is still totally broken.
---
Pretty good job so far.
---
(And they could've just made Deep Wound respond to proximity or Killer-side terror radius.)
---
Can somebody remind me what does Nemesis do?
---
We just want our stabs to mean something. Either rework them or make them useful by yknow reworking them
---
You dont need to explain how spoiling works, my point is that it isnt a significant thing. It's a mori, something that you'll see whether it's in your game, in a youtube video, or in my stupid meme video.
---
If you cant handle the possibility of me "spoiling" a character animation, then don't go onto the reddit when something new releases.
---
Drag the dc’er into the street then brand and maim them
---
Nah, the current penalty seems fine. More people will just be killing themselves on the hook though, which still costs a pip.
---
His skill is yelling at Survivors so hard they lose their morale and don't bother with gens.
---
Entity displeased because there's no hope against him.
---
This used to be true for me but recently killer matches have taken a minute or so and survivor ones have taken slightly longer.  If I do SWF with my one friend it takes even longer.  Strange, I know.
---
Mangled makes healing slower
---
Happens to me sometimes too. I have 150mbs internet, so yeah, it’s definitely not the internet. 
---
I believe it has to do with the fact that PS4 doesn’t have dedicated servers? 
---
But regardless, it happens to all of us, so don’t feel too bad.
---
I’ve been requesting Ghostface Leatherface for months
---
Yeah, sadly the toxic SWF groups ruin it for groups of people who just want to have fun
---
Well  swf is op so some killers wanna dodge it’s the same as when survivors dc  against spirit there both bitch moves but its whatever I guess
---
Are we going to ignore the mega-whip necklace on Nea?
---
Counterplay? Impossible. Everyone knows literally the only way to play the game is looping, and if looping doesn't work, the Killer needs a nerf.
---
I HATE THAT EVERYTIME I TRY TO UNHOOK SOMEONE IN THE EGC I GET TUNNELED AND THEN FACECAMPED AFTERWARDS.
---
EVERY. SINGLE. FUCKING. TIME.
---
IT'S GETTING TO THE POINT WHERE I'M JUST GOING SO SAY FUCK IT AND JUST IGNORE AND LEAVE EVERYONE DURING EGC.
---
Holy shit, Bill’s actually getting a cosmetic...
---
Also, why would Bill wear a Vietnam Christmas sweater? That’s like a survivor of the Holocaust wearing a Christmas sweater with a sewn picture of Auschwitz on it.
---
Legion's power is supposed to reward and encourage rotating targets. That's why they made a perk that hands tunnels over on a silver platter instead of making speed ramp up per stab.
---
You can still play it but the developers can’t make any more updates because of a lawsuit so it’s “finished” in that nothing can be changed
---
I think we should agree to disagree, regardless I don't think the devs would change their mind and I don't really feel that strongly about it tbh. Enjoy the rest of your week mate! 👍
---
I HAD FOUR GAMES JUST LIKE THIS IN A ROW THE OTHER DAY AND I AM STILL KIND OF SALTY ABOUT IT
---
They’re  both beings of pure hatred that aren’t gonna die easy (if at all), so I imagine it’s the sort of thing the entity watches with popcorn when he gets tired of watching killers get teabagged at the exit gates
---
Wow this is a big FU to camping killers.
---
I like it, but I can't imagine survivors running without it now.
---
Kinda, the servers are still up and you can buy the game but there isnt any new content coming out.
---
Its once a game. It's not OP.

I guess you can say Yamaoka is the “Oni” one for me!

Is that the cheat where they combined pig and plague to make a plig... or pague? Not sure what it’s called b it I played against one before :(

I'd rather play longer games and get more BP then have an asshole DC because they got downed or something and screw the rest of the team

INB4 They just gonna make it so Deep Wound doesn't go down when in chase too.

It being alive is already a change of pace, but in all honesty, the RTS angle for the solo antagonist is something I haven't even heard of since Zombie Master, so I'm kind of excited for it.

Killer mains crying in the shower watching this
---
Rest In Peace TF2
---
It's not, if you played PTB or checked anyone who did you would have noticed it takes way to long. Playing Legion with both bleed addons and the bleed perk pack (nemesis, BoP etc.) is cheesy and maybe unfun to play against but Legion mains are having more succes so far with the standard "meta" Legion build which relies on pressure rather than waiting for people to bleed out. Basically against a decent survivor it will take way longer to get a down by waiting than just hitting them twice.
---
You get XP for being there, which becomes shards at an irregular exchange rate each level. Survival is mostly just escaping, and it being so binary instead of being awarded per gen completed is probably a huge source of the game's toxicity.
---
I’m on Xbox, dedicated servers aren’t a thing, at least I don’t think so. From what I’ve seen tho, dedicated servers are only worse.
---
Yeah just [don't get hit.](https://clips.twitch.tv/RespectfulHorribleWeaselNerfRedBlaster) Also popular counter to nurse.
---
Ok reddit analyst, it's been fun. Have a nice day.
---
Props to your creativity in using screenshots on the side panels though. Always cool when people make unique memes
---
Oh shit...
---
Being stunned doesn’t remove bloodlust, but any successful action bu the Killer does
---
I think marvel v capcom did this
---
Is it OK if that survivor has less internal organs than usual...?
---
Add Frank Horrigan instead, fuck the other Frank.
---
If I'm not wrong it's a timeout rather than a ban. Have to see how it works
---
That's...not what balance means...
---
They're both probably barely lucid. If they had enough humanity left to recognize each other as people not offending their sensibilities, they'd just move on, but if Spirit's sword made her look like a fake samurai and Oni gave off some "aura" like Rin's father, they'd fight like monsters.
---
Deep Wounds. It was designed as a buff one survivor gives to another with borrowed time.
---
You can wait for people to bleed out using Nemesis as it removes your terror radius it also starts peoples mend timers (even though ur still chasing them). Now if you test this on PTB it's not as stronger as this sub thinks it is but well this subs gonna complain anyway.
---
Just remove the speed boost and make it a separate perk
---
Wait, so this BOP is one of the new perks coming with Oni? I may have missed the new info on the new killer if it was indeed released. Also, I’m still not  💯familiar with every single perk in the game, so if it’s one that has been around for a while; I apologize. 😋
---
Is the gen going to phase out of existence when you are downed or something?
---
If so, it would be amazing to be in a swf and have each player take turns pallet stunning the killer and picking the pallet back up before he can get away
---
Play without looping at Rank 1. Good luck, meatbag.
---
I've always wanted wraith to grab the survivor, cloak with them, uncloak and the survivor is gone. Spoopy ;)
---
It was always like that for me bro, main reason I stopped playing that often and now I only play at nights
---
You dont need to mori people for any rift challenge
---
I am not sure if it will but it definitely should be able to. When someone purposefully disconnects, it makes a sound but if someone is disconnected by the server or something like that it does not. But this might lead to people just disconnecting from the internet to avoid bans and keep their items.
---
~gurgle~
---
If he has tier 3 but doesnt have perfumed hair you can get into a locker, or literally work on a gen in front of him to force him to grab you lol, you can LITERALLY sit there and pump a gen out in front and he has to choose to waste the add on and  grab you or waste the add on and not grab you.
---
Technically I’d say lobby dodging is less of a dick move since your not confirmed you accept the game like a survivor dodging cause two people are rank 17 is okay and a killer dodging cause it’s a SWF with flashlights toolboxes and such is okay but when you go into a game and quit cause it’s not a killer you wanna play against that’s when it’s not okay cause you already accepted whatever effects the match have
---
SHIIIIIIIT YOU RIGHT!
---
Or worse.
---
Congratulations, you don't understand the difference between being an option and being the only option.
---
*sniff* 
---
they grow up so fast :'(
---
Yep. Me too. Sorry Monto
---
I GUESS IT MAKES AS MUCH SENSE AS "BEING NEAR A DWIGHT INSPIRES YOU TO SOMEHOW FIX A GENERATOR FASTER."
---
I still don't understand why everyone is saying that Beast of Prey is good in this build. Hiding red stain can be useful but you can just moonwalk and replace it with something like Enduring looking on the fact that you want survivors to stun you. UNLESS people are talking about the bloodpoint bonus which is something too I guess
---
Gotta lvl fast.
---
There is the last one in the first part. Kill all survivors in one trial by any means.
---
The onion isnt her father though? I could be wrong tho
---
It can also just happen on its own, though. I thought we had dedicated servers now, so why would that still happen?
---
Favs are: the white icon with the clouds background (right of the right diamond)
---
and the black icons in front of the sunset city/palm tree background (bottom of the left diamond)
---
As a raum main, he isnt very unique.
---
A demon who absorbs life force isnt very unique.
---
Onis are ogres, melee bois. He needs some form of movement, and that's the most fitting for an oni.
---
She's OP at low ranks, and UP once you reach the level where people can loop her. In either case she has the strongest compatability with slowdown perks, though.
---
"Family" is pretty loose here fam, would you get along with someone 10+ generations ago as family
---
Do you seriously think BHVR looked at leaks from Paladins of all games and went “yup, we’re gonna make a killer based off of that”
---
Yeah sure will upload them in a sec :)
---
&lt;3 HAIL ~~SATAN~~ WRAITH! &lt;3
---
Nurse's is fine
---
It's because the corrupt purge makes her a more deadly huntress essentially. It's just easier to loop an M1 killer than it is to try to dodge the spraying of her puke. Black incense does grant insane information, but she is still an M1 killer at that point. (Dead hard also becomes a bit better since it's a good perk the whole match as well.)
---
The addon that grants corrupt after every gen tends to be one of the better ones because of this common strategy but I rarely see it.
---
&gt; So you're telling me, that there would be absolutely no difference between 4 rank 15 survivors vs 4 rank 1 survivors?
---
Waiting on this answer
---
Not really in case the guy who got hooked and u urself is injured prioritise the guy who has been hooked already provided that u havent been hooked
---
When did they update it ? I thought they already did awhile ago ? Source/ pic ?
---
Any means. Not mori. You can just sacrifice them. Even DC's count.
---
Yeah another game did this but i dont know which.
---
Yeah I have plat too. 
---
Stopped playing religiously around when clown  *coughwhenfortnitecameoutcough* was released so I have everything up to Pig, my main.
---
If it said “by your hand” you would be right. For the archive one, you just need to 4k: sacrifice, mori, dc, they all count.
---
Isn't this balanced though? The killer mains on r/deadbydaylight said so. It must be true.
---
Look, if they are going to carry a purple or pink into the game, I am going to be a monster. You cannot ask a man to show pity on those who are not deserving. I also fucked people over who needed to escape with an item, but I show no remorse in the tragedy of the commons.
---
No but we all escaped
---
Thats good.
---
Ok thank you :)
---
Are you kidding? This has to stay. I’m a poor solo survivor and don’t want to play with swf that bring their rank 18 friend along.
---
"Meta" in games is sort of like a crust that hardens on baked bread. At first, it gives structure and contrast, but after too long, it becomes bitter, stale, and unpleasant. Since it forms naturally, it's best to actively try to shuffle the meta of a game until there are enough meta options that it's not restrictive, which is not the case for DbD.
---
Glad to know there was a happy ending
---
That was the best feature they ever added. I lobby dodged so many rank 17 claudettes lol
---
I’d rather have survivors that work on gens rather than hide at the edge of the map
---
I'm convinced Dead By Daylight ripped off a Hero from For Honor. There's a Hero in For Honor that has been around for a long time that has very huge similarities to the Oni. Not even coincidences, blatantly the same thing. Both DBD and For Honor push out new people about every 3 months- and I agree they both probably worked on this consecutively (maybe) but For Honor had a lot of memes on their hero named Shugoki. The Oni has a dash. One shot. And blood absorbs. Shugoki, can demon sprint, he can one shot at low hp, and absorbs life when he does this, similar to the Oni. Both massive scary big dudes. I love both For Honor and Dead By Daylight. For Honor is broken, and is similar to I can't think of any game like it. Dead By Daylight has been a staple in my gaming experience. But I thought it was WEIRD as shit to see this. But come on DBD, really?
---
Since the oni is obsessed with destroying weaker bloodlines he would leave the spirit alone. Even perhaps murder for her. For him the Yama bloodline is the superior. Spirit is hell bent out of revenge on her father she would probably ignore him since he doesn't fit her father's description, perhaps the intact katana would provoke a short surge of rage and an attempt to murder. Which would be relatively short lived as the oni just laughs it off

What are the top perks for demogorgon?
---
survivors man
---
Damn, you took this really deep. Sorry
---
I was talking about the perk, but yes I agree. In my opinion, not bring able to hear terror radius shouldn't mean removing it.
---
Confusing, I know, but hope you get my point.
---
there is a new perk that makes him very strong on the ptb (public test build) he isnt good cause you dont have access to it yet
---
Sometimes I did. Not every swf is God tier skill guys. But usually when they are it's usually not the killer I'm playing but a skillgap because they are God tier and I'm not
---
Also sometimes God tier skill guys get too cocky and all die because of it too
---
Honestly it's not that bad it needs nerfed. Bbq and chili needs a nerf
---
tbh DCs getting punished will just get switched with dying on hook
---
Can't stop the shugoki memes. Let them flow.
---
It’s better then getting put back to rank 10
---
Its perfectly balanced just kill the survivors b4 the last gen 4head ez counter /s
---
Lolol the survivors join at different intervals so it's impossible to know if they are swf anymore.
---
Perhaps if you guys didn't name yourselves "I like his weiner" and "he likes my weiner" then it would be harder to know.
---
Mixed in with *very* slight buffs. Why, one of them was almost a full quarter second increase!
---
RUDE
---
It hasn't come out for console yet. Calm yourself already.

They probably will. Meanwhile bbq and chili remains game ruining

As a blendette this is probably the best map to sneak on right next to badham preschool's basement
---
Oh god she has Nemesis!
---
I find it funny that you're getting downvoted for making a joke about the alarming rate of disconnecting players because they don't like a killer.
---
Personally I don't think this will do anything. People will just hook suicide or alt f4. Maybe even download programs to disconnect without a ban.
---
I'm sure you'll still get quite a few but hopefully you can retire this collection peacefully. At least in an Ideal World
---
I just referenced the sing to be fair lol but the anime for that part finished  April 5, 2013 so not really a spoiler at this point  ┌( ಠ‿ಠ)┘
---
Ah another joke post
---
Putting a permanent mark on people would make people dodge matches though, which might create even more problems. It also doesn’t allow the person to “redeem themselves” from their DC ways. 
---
Also, especially on PS4, DC’s happen all the time due to the server, not the player, so BHVR needs a good way to differentiate the two. I believe I read that they don’t at the moment, but I could be wrong. 
---
Personally I think the temporary matchmaking ban is good. If it increases with how many times you DC, I mean, if people keep doing it, maybe they’d even be banned for days or weeks at a time. I think that’s a good punishment.
---
If they don't abuse infinites then why would you need the stagger reduction to proc more than once per exhaustion cycle?
---
Tier one Michael and Ghostface in general scare the shit out of me.

In my opinion his whole power needs a rework, its too hard to tweak

OMG YES

WHY CAN'T THE DEVS FIX THE FUCKING SOUNDS FOR KILLERS? IS IT REALLY THAT DIFFICULT? HOLY SHIT, I'M SO TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE TO HEAR AN INJURED SURVIVOR BREATHING WHEN I'M NEXT TO THEM.
---
“I know you’re 6 meters away and seconds from going into struggle but the gen is at 40%, give me one sec”
---
Let me clarify myself. The vaulting speed buffs and addon buffs were what I was at least excited for. They still didn’t do anything to Frank’s and Stab Wounds Study, but even with losing on hit for Frenzy I could still be okay. 
---
Then I saw the Beast of Prey changes and thought “this isn’t good. Maybe they’ll change it to something else since it’s just one perk” 
---
Then I saw Nemesis and went “never
---
I don’t BHVR is gonna break them again.
---
Oh legion needs a rework for sure. He does not need another broken mechanic
---
Ghostface just needs a point emote now to complete it.

Be **HEALED**, motherfuckers!

I know, but rank was already pointless. Now it literally means nothing. I wish i could just stay at rank 8 forever. I feel like it is the most fun rank. But alas, here I am, rank 4 and hating everyone.
---
How about no
---
BBQ tells you so much. You know that when you hook someone whoever's aura you don't see is either immediately nearby (within a 48 meter range of the hook) or they jumped in a locker.
---
r/dadbydaylight would appreciate it
---
I just think it's kinda useless how it is now. A perk that activates once is kinda pointless to use
---
It wasn't allowed to have development continue but a few hundred people still play. I'm quite aware they aren't made by the same people. I wasn't saying they were lying and would do it just not here. I was saying how enjoyable it was they had the balls to do it because if you punch through someone's chest there IS going to be a hole. It's a shame they won't put it in but it gets a little more of an audience. I think it is an antiquated thing with such censorship. The access children have to anything they want to search for is likely far more at risk for damaging their little minds than this game. Nipples aren't legal but they can ask you on tv to sign up to kill people.  Maybe it's just to manage the workload since they are a small team.
---
I only wanted to say that i enjoyed it
---
Oni his perk nemesis makes it so anyone who pallet stuns you becomes the obsession, suffers the oblivious statis effect (your terror radius is gone) and you see their aura for 5 seconds.
---
On Legion, that's an valuable perk for tracking and downing survivors. Legion is basically useless at high rank so people think this might revive his playability. But it'll probably get nerfed before oni releases honestly
---
Nerf David King. No Mither OP. lol

Okay, good to know, I misunderstood how Deep Wound works. Didn't know it stopped while in the Terror Radius.

That only applies to leaked content. This isn't leaked content.
---
I think I found a bl user
---
I couldn't put any text somehow so I just had to improvise with pictures
---
Even if an overwhelming population of ghost faces are assholes its not fair to generalize
---
It's stronger with an SWF team than a random team.
---
good point
---
Did it my first game too. Faced an iri huntress on that autohaven map thats easy to 3 gen yourself. Pretty intense.
---
I play on PC and PS4. 
---
Because two queues is killer.
---
Still takes forever.
---
Most the killers in this game are original, and the ones who are licensed can not be purchased with Iridescent Shards.
---
They just get more toxic and use some posts here to feel better about it.
---
because of high ground on maps. ormond, the game, red forest, etc.
---
Doesn't make a lick of sense
---
Shugo can’t one shot anymore, I miss the salt it brewed. I also secretly miss the D-tier memes and the “another patch another shugo nerf” memes
---
Just one.. more ... second ... ooops missed that ruin skill check ... just a few more seconds ..
---
wym rest in peace the game is still super alive lol
---
*Oh no*. *Oni*
---
Random crits are fair and balanced
---
Why does she have meg’s voice?
---
Spirit is still top tier but not number 2 anymore because of the changes imo, but it really depends on if they add more nerfs or not. If you can immediately see when she starts phasing then she will fall to a low high rank/high mid rank killer. Nurse will always be better than Oni I’ll give you that. Nurse doesn’t seem to be in need for a nerf at all.
---
While all the concerns around Legion are understandable, as someone who plays Legion a lot AND has used Beast of Prey in the past before it's buff, let me say this- there is a very easy way to make the killer lose their bloodlust.
---
Lose their line of sight.
---
I'm not joking, literally if you even duck behind a bunch of junk for even just a few seconds, or sprint into a building and make yourself unseen just for a *few* seconds, Beast of Prey becomes useless as bloodlust goes away. I know that looping is the meta, but you guys seriously need to learn how to do more than just loop the killer endlessly. Learn to break line of sight, and you've countered Beast of Prey.
---
It’s probably just set at maximum for the PTB so level 1 will be either lower or it will stay like that and the other levels will change it.
---
I mean, no.  
---
Bill loved being in Vietnam, and being in the military.
---
Man...this was one of the best things that's been added. Of course they're taking it away!!!!!!!!!!!
---
ok.. just read the polls and the fact that 70% of the community has been complaining about the game not being scary enough. they’re obviously listening by slowly implementing horror into the game. i’m just telling you how much it WOULD harm the game.
---
they might keep it if we complain loud enough. They actually listen to the community unlike most other game companies
---
Same. I just hope that it’s not killed by legal troubles like F13 or bad launch deals like last year
---
Really? I have the best game at red ranks.
---
I agree both are toxic but one takes the fun out of the game/doesn’t let you play or even have a chance
---
Yea turns out if you keep nerfing survivors and take the fun out of them, people will stop playing them. Survivors need to be balanced, sure, but they still need to be fun. Gotta remember you need 4/5 of people playing survivor if you want decent queues
---
I’m a Marine and I main killer (surprise). 
---
I’m tougher than any killer main in the Chair Force.
---
Your doing a pretty good job so far!
---
Surely you forgot the /s???
---
Puny launguige with just 8 minutes worth of curses.
---
I assume they'll just add a bit of invincibility to it for that... then again, bubbas chainsaw works similarly vs borrowed time.
---
No, i have a lot of fun playing the old legion the new legion is a piece of shit the meaning of unfun
---
There is literally Kate 2 on ptb right now, lol
---
Oni
---
Also I understand the reasoning behind it because 2 people dead and u have a key but I’m talking when nea or claud is urban evasioning toward u on hook while ur friend is being chased
---
Myers, cant break him out of stalk and you can one shot everyone, dont have to worry about percentage of stalks
---
NGL had my first DBD nightmare thanks to the Oni's demon dash.
---
True, I was thinking that the killer was not seeing
---
What have they done to the baby huntress its just soo wrong on like so many levels
---
Except us Legion players!
---
I hate slugging lmao. So much
---
I mean Bill is short for Billiam
---
Lol it’s always the toxic survivor who gets hooked and camped. 
---
I think most killers would rather walk off and keep playing but in my opinion if you get hook camped it’s the equivalent of a time out. 
---
Obviously the killer doesn’t wanna stand there and watch you bleed out on a hook but holy shit some people will leave you NO CHOICE.
---
I'll just hit you twice, go out of my power and wait those 15+ seconds watching you panic because you either run or emd on front of me because of beast of pray, yeah old Legion is definitely back baby
---
stay in a closet, preferably byan exit gate, until an exit gate is opened. when the crows on the closet get to 2, keep going in and out of the closet until the crows fade back to 0.
---
I hope so. This is such a useful feature and to hear that it’s a bug is quite funny :D
---
If they deleted him they would actually likely be obligated to give people their money back. Even if they didn’t, would you ever spend money on a character again if they just one decided they couldn’t actually balance someone and just dragged them to the recycling bin?
---
Yeah I heard all about it. I needed to come up with something, but yeah despite its awful state of balance I miss the old for honor.
---
I feel like Ghostface is way stronger than Myers:
---
- You get your stalk way faster
---
- You can stalk strategically
---
--&gt; have 99% on everybody and use it when it's the best time
---
- Using Night Shroud in a chase even messes with rank 1's due to red stain removal
---
Nooo wayyy, I find killer matches so fast, every time I play survivor it takes me 20 mins to find a game
---
Ghost face is essentially the secret fifth member of the legion. Prove me wrong
---
Jonathan dies. Haha get spoiled nerd

I PLAYED SPIRIT WITH PRAYER BEADS. GOT CALLED A HACKER BECAUSE THERE WAS NO SOUND DURING TELEPORTING. I ...

Good thing I never play survivor so I can completely disregard literally any issues with the meta!
---
Play killer. Soooooo much less hassle.
---
Doesn't mean the interaction he recorded is absolutely bull shit. Ghostie had 0 options in this situation other then just picking up bill which we dont know if there were hooks nearby , bill already has struggle etc. Just remember this when you guys cry about legions fun new perk.
---
Myers better and broken addons
---
Maybe Ghostface at base is stronger, by Myers’ add ons make him way more viable.
---
Dude is a baby. I would’ve never join his party and give him any satisfaction. Giving someone the chance to be toxic will only encourage it
---
Oh cool they fucked up the ranking system even more
---
Just fucking rework them honestly man, these changes aren't great, I expected a new power so a rework, but we got some buffs and nerfs and we still have this useless as fuck power
---
Base ghostface&gt;base myers, add ons ghostface&lt;add ons myers.
---
Instructions unclear, time to nerf the survivors once more and give obliterate to another killer
---
That seems needless. The sound effect might interfere with other noises you're trying to hear as well. If some people want less noise and some want more why switch them at all if some are gonna be level 1.
---
I had one game where I did 2 gens, was doing the third then was grabbed by Ghostface after trying to complete it in a futile effort (baited a hit then tried completing it). The gen was at 99.9%, I was in pain irl
---
I don’t think the patch is up yet. (Played today and didn’t get an update, Xbox if that matters). They are testing the patch with the PTB currently, I think.
---
When the patch goes live the feature will be removed. It should, without a doubt, stay.
---
You’re making it sound like it’s either door or key to open hatch every match.  Keys are barely used. But it’s okay to use eboni mori right?
---
This just... isn't funny. I think a /s would have gone a long way.
---
There should be less DC's with the matchmaking penalty. Thankfully.
---
Well you can’t open the gates during the EGC

Well, it's all subjective.

---
For the countries where that amount of gore would make the game inaccessible
---
Pre end game collapse yes, they can’t be opened by the killer during the collapse though. Can be a tactic to proc Blood Warden
---
Oni and spirit are about the same as in terms of tier now on my opinion which is how it should be considering their family
---
Trapper: shove survivor into 2 traps, locking both feet in place, then a kick to drive the survivor's head into a third trap
---
Wraith: go invisible, survivor stands up all confused, Wraith starts slashing the survivor's limbs out while remaining in stealth
---
Hillbilly: chainsaw run away, survivor stands up, billy zooms back, sawing the survivor in half
---
Huntress: throw a hatchet into the air, strike the axe into the survivor's sternum, Huntress lifts survivor over her head and smacks them on the ground, face up, hatchet falls to survivor's face, Huntress removes hatchet
---
Oni is so much better than Billy. He cant bump into objects, has not cooldown, more control, faster than Billy when addons are implemented, and has a lunge at the end of his charge.
---
Hmm... would a potentially faulty / worn-out module manifest itself in the utilization graphs in any notable way? I'll have to monitor this somehow. Again, not having seen any comparable issues with other games *yet*.
---
It's certainly something to consider, if config changes turn out to be unable to fully resolve it. I hate trial-and-error troubleshooting on hardware though, so I'm going to take some time to observe it before making a decision... (a very long, annoying and expensive story of mystery freezes with a broken PSU)
---
At least Ram prices are looking considerably less expensive than the last time I checked...
---
If there is no TR you just moonwalk yet again that's what I'm saying
---
Isn’t poor sportsmanship quite literally bad manners?
---
There is no change saying they will give indication when she phases as of yet which is good
---
BECAUSE YOU NEVER MANAGE TO GET IT UNLESS THRU SIT AT A PALLET.
---
#Zanshin Tactics
---
This is really cool!
---
I think his art design is impressive. He gives off a sense of scale and power that not a lot of other killers provide.
---
What other games do you play that would be comparable?  Are they online or offline?
---
I agree. That's why I wrote "tru3 mind games" with a smiley face, cause tru3talent says that spirit has such a huge mind game behind her, which is not true imo.
---
Beast of Prey is being buffed to give Undetectable instead of just removing red stain after bloodlust, and the Oni’s new perk makes a survivor Oblivious (like cleansing Demogorgon’s portals) when they stun the killer.
---
That the link was rude lol
---
Third subreddit that’s posting spoilers. 
---
The show is brand new and plenty of people haven’t seen it yet. But it’s painfully obvious where this comes from.

Thanks!

yea sorry guys english is not my first " or second language " sorry about that and for me freddy is a " magical" monster is powers come from magic " curse whatever "  for me the alien is a animal a " sci fi animal " so for me its different  but sure have xenomorph carry around survivors and not pounce on them in 3 seconds .. lol
---
Which one  ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
He would be a one shot m1 killer who also has no terror radius, practically invisible, and can fly temporarily. And his one shot ability is to make you feel like shit and curl up into a ball on the ground.
---
NO? I DON'T ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT GAME YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT.
---
I SUPPOSE YOU COULD SAY I STOLE THE IDEA FROM LEFT 4 DEAD THOUGH.
---
It's not the gore or anything. It's that they are to lazy or cheap to make new animations. If you read the ama you really get that vibe from some of the responses. Pair that with the fact they already reuse animations and it all points towards laziness or cheapness.
---
Only people who wanted th stagger reduction are toxic people abusing infinite loops
---
People actually tunnel you with it? When I see an OoO in my game I do everything in my power to ignore them as much as possible. They spend the entire match following me and clicking their flashlight so they don't get anything done. It's better than ruin.
---
Nope, just an ancestor

Wow it's actually the same sweaters that Nancy and Steve are wearing in the last episode of Season 1. They did it, the mad lads.

Can somebody link me the bio on the new killer, I couldnt find it it. Is he really the spirits father?

Just to be clear, we're talking about proper 2 handed Frost spec Obliterate like it used to be, and not the crappy double toothpick slap it is in BFA right?
---
Omg omg omg new Susie cosmetic AHHHHHHH😂💗💗💗💗
---
&gt;saying Ace is the best when Ash is in the game
---
Simple solution is just play with an swf. Even a 2 man is enough to make a difference. And if you have no friends then uh. Well you know what they say, if you cant beat em, join em. Run an immersed build and hide better than the boosted babies on ur team. Dont have to worry about pallets if the killer never chases you
---
Dont play to carry the team just play for yourself. To pip all you need is 12 points so you can get a silver in unbroken and then either an iri in 2 categories and a silver in the last or 1 iri and 2 golds. Just prioritize gens and if the opportunity for a save arises go for it. 2 full gens 2 safe unhooks and a short chase should be enough for a pip or at least youll never depip. Also bonds is super helpful for positioning yourself.
---
That's a survivor pudding
---
The irony is real.
---
Jeez i think you were a bit harsh on Quentin considering both his model and perks are getting a rework, even then wake up is good for EGC and pharmacy is very good after the medkit changes
---
The higher in rank you go, the less true this is. The problem is actually ranko g up in the first place.
---
Also once you hit rank 13 you start getting instant queues...into 4 man SWF lobbies.
---
Dont gain a health state when in the killers possession. Easy. Its so annoying having them get off the hook at full health and have a sprint burst
---
Oh okay i didnt know. Thanks!
---
I don’t even use balanced if ur talking about me, I just see the need for it to have an advantage over other exhaustion perks because of how situational it is.
---
Yea that’s why I put “start as a killer” it takes forever to just start out as a killer that it’s discouraging.
---
Okay, green items and below then I guess. Anyone who dares use anything greater *deserves* to lose it.
---
True Swine is Collection name
---
Yeah not being able to stun the killer isn’t broken at all
---
Ok as someone who neither has Legion or has access to the ptb what's all this about Legion and nemesis
---
They should have stats that show their dc numbers
---
Leadership still does it, but I think it specifies the actions it buffs and perks wouldn't be on the list.
---
best death ever
---
It might be a reference to his “death” in The Sacrifice, which lead him to being taken by the Entity. (Although canonically he is deceased.)
---
The helicopter has an explosion behind it, which happened in the beginning/comics for The Sacrifice, which lead to his death at the ending.

Why can I hear mortal combats "Fatality" at the end of this

He still has more cosmetics than Freddy

But it will still proc on all those maps though. It's just not infinite now.

I heard Civilization is a nice and relaxing game.

Its the multiple killers bug. She's stepped in a trap making her skeleton stretch to Trapper's proportions

ok but the majority of the time it wasn’t an infinite? it was just used normally?
---
Spoiler it
---
What countries would that be? I have to disagree with you and say it's the cost. New animations cost money.
---
Of course not
---
Well aren't you a budding comedian.
---
I don't care about realism I've suffered enough.

I‘m a solo survivor so purple ranks are super frustrating with randoms. Red ranks can be too but I usually have more fun in red ranks.

It's also a popular counter to every killer, but for SOME REASON, people don't do this.
---
Where can we get high resolution?
---
oh my bad, i'll delete it then! thanks for letting me know
---
It's not really for the ratings boards, more for other countries that would get DBD banned/censored for overly gory content. And yes, it's stupid, but for once we can actually not blame BHVR and blame other countries' sensitivity because any other game company would do the same to avoid missing out on a massive market share.
---
Why? This community is bad enough.
---
Builds can't be toxic.
---
Post the one where Myers is wearing stockings 😂😂
---
If it was mostly just used normally then the change shouldn't effect that many people so I'm not sure why you're upset about it.
---
Survivors will DC because they were found first by Ghostface. No penalty is going to force people to stay in the game. Either they DC immediately or just Off themselves on first hook and ruin everyone’s game.
---
Oh no, that is not normal. I didn’t realize it happened THAT much.
---
If you’re just using WiFi, you may want to plug an Ethernet into your PS4 and see if that helps. Even if you have 50mbs, your PS4 might not be actually picking that much up.

Y'all have me rolling with laughter.

I honestly have come to expect that from this community. No worries.

Nemesis makes the survivor oblivious, which removes the TR.

And now salty survivors can't dc without being punished hell yeah

Honestly, I hope this doesn’t get fixed. I used to be a Legion main, made the swap to Ghostface, but damn let these guys have something. People are acting like this is literally the old Legion being
---
put back in the game, and it isn’t. This requires actual setup to make happen(just don’t stun him), and requires not one, but two purple addons to be done effectively, and it takes up a perk slot on top of it. It’s good, don’t get me wrong, but old Legion it is not. We’ve got multiple killers with instant downs in the game, what’s wrong with Legion having one good build, which like I said, takes up a perk slot/requires two addons. Give them a break and throw them a bone.
---
because the perk literally has maps where it can’t activate. It needs something to keep it up. my suggestion is to make the passive cause high ground map tiles to spawn more often, as long as it gets something to make the risk worth the reward.
---
Imagine moonwalking them to hooks, that’s all I envision now, haha

Nah, Kate in the mountain climbing outfit is bae

No u
---
The Obsession gets Oblivious.  No terror radius = deep wound timer ticks down
---
We already have a moonwalking michael
---
I’ll get Dwight for chrismas for sure lol.
---
So you enjoy abusing broken mechanics to get free downs? Interesting.
---
Beast of Prey and Nemesis get the same result; original moonwalking legion but stronger because they don't need to moonwalk and they are 115% speed now. It's the game giving you the win in 30 seconds once it's started because there is literally nothing that can stop it. Original legion wasn't even strong as a whole; he was just broken and unfair as hell as far as single chases go. That's why he was changed.
---
Using oblivious or undetectable on legion to force an absolute end by an absolute time in a chase that can't be prevented is pure bullshit. The timer could be any time; it's just unfun as hell to go against on the other side because there is 0 skill involved for a guaranteed cap on the chase.
---
Welp we know Samarion gag.
---
Lol how does folklore change or affect how people perceive the figure visually?  It’s not scary, he just looks tough.  Big deal.
---
This is true, why are you downvoted. From the start the game wasn't designed for intense body disfigurement like F13 was. Yeah they could probably hack something together that would work, but it would be time inefficient. Sure if it snowed 50cm in Florida randomly they could get it cleaned up, but not as fast as most places in Canada for example.
---
Just throw on OOO.
---
What about maybe the most annoying perks to go up against?
---
You wont eventually bleed out....DW timer is paused in the terror radius
---
This is bad advise honestly. It'd be better to work on generators rather than waste so much time chasing the killer around when they're on a tunneling rampage. If being tunneled, it's optimal for a Survivor to try and loop a killer as long as possible so the rest of the team stands a chance.
---
She traveled from babylon to what is now known as russia when she exiled herself
---
Swf, one person with OoO another with BT
---
Rest run adrenaline, Dead hard, DS, (Last perk can be iron will/ borrowed/we'll make it whatever)
---
You could reverse this and have it be "legion with nemesis"
---
Diminishing returns. I'm not staying in a game 30 extra minutes for 3000 more points just become some killer whose time is worthless wants a 4 kill.
---
If you cant use it effectively just stare at the ground and stay to the outside gens. Look up and around when you see someone getting chased.
---
I think that'd be cool too
---
Bill getting his first ever cosmetic

All blendetts are shaking rn

Why do legion mains want to play as a killer that’s just going to be straight up unplayable against.

#RAW
---
Thanks. I just get tired of people complaining over things like this. I'm like, if you aren't impressed with the killer, don't play him. He has plenty of others who understand the lore that will play him in the end. And as big of a staple as an Oni is in mythological Japanese lore, especially how horrifying they are, I'd say he fits in a hell of a lot better than most think.

Yes. Unless you're going to suggest how they could have shut the hatch more nicely I don't care to discuss anymore. What people are attacking here is no different than calling a basketball player rude for going for the 3 point shot instead of the 2.
---
The real question is, who's better, pper or clo
---
Well, they could simply make it so that deep wound only decreases when away from the killer, regardless of TR.
---
That happened to Monto in the same place.
---
Wraith after the mori: becomes powerless again lol.
---
I don't understand. You say the majority didn't abuse it to help create near infinites, so this change shouldn't make it a 'literal dead perk'. It already was.
---
Hehe... Hehehe.... HAHAHA! Legion Mains prepare to take the game by storm 😈
---
All 4 Legion members on the map at once, 3 in Lockers, one under your control.
---
You can go into a Locker and TP to the other members and become them.
---
If a survivor tries to get into a Locker one of the Legion members is in treat it like a Hag trap clone and if you don't TP to it soon enough they disappear and respawn in a new Locker after like 60 seconds.
---
It would inspire creative gameplay AND push cosmetics since you would theoretically have 4 killers to customize each match.
---
I didn’t say the game was bad, if you look back at top tier horror games, the creatures are usually pretty grotesque and intimidating visually.
---
Because if you took the time to learn the lore, you'd see what Oni stand for, and the horrific things they do that earn them a place in this game.
---
The way you're going about it is the same as saying, "What's so scary about a group of teens with knives and paper masks?"

If you’re the first chased he won’t need to use his power on you and it won’t be charged yet anyway, you’ll feed it to full power giving him what he needs to chase others. That and being broken means you’ll be leaving blood orbs everywhere giving him a constant supply (depending on whether the orbs have a time limit or stick around until absorbed)

So your the punk who keeps needing me?
---
Not to mention, you get hooks through your shoulder on a regular basis and it doesn't even leave a drop of blood, much less rip your clothing
---
So if a killer bullies solo survivors and plays toxic to blow off steam, does that make it okay for SWF to play toxic to killers because they get scummy killers on solo? Just following the logic
---
what? all bhvr originals are free
---
Honestly, very few killers have proper spook factor anymore. Though it's still fun to go up against any of them if the player is good.
---
Dude, not cool...for the summer.
---
Thatll take it down to about 30ish seconds, but requires 2 purple addons. 2 purple addons is super strong on almost all killers. The real problem is those 2 addons on Nemesis. Then its just 15 seconds and thats nasty

SOMEBODY ONCE TOLD ME...
---
HURDUR Imma bot, geez man at least try to come up with some form of a counter-argument to WHY yiou think that would be stupid. Or you know just keep on being stupid I guess. Not like billy has access to faster movement without a cool-down and an insta-down. Nah infintie frenzy for map mobility would be tooo stronk.
---
And honestly imo I've been having a lot more fun as survivor, it isn't constantly getting flashlight spammed and t bagged lol. I try to be nice to the killer because I know how it feels
---
Whats the difference between demogorgans power n this killers power?
---
How is a group of teens with paper mache masks and dinky knives spooky?
---
Pharmacy is better than self care imo
---
"money"
---
lol okay
---
Before doing your taxes, make sure no minors are near by as that could result in you spoiling taxes for minors. Please shout "SPOILER WARNING" so minors don't find out about taxes.
---
No mither, self care, second wind, inner strength. With a brown medkit.
---
I find this humorous, take my upvote.
---
Billy also can't strafe during a chainsaw sprint
---
We really need Amandas head next.
---
Should’ve marked as spoiler
---
That's just the kind of bear I am.
---
Yeah I started running that and depending on the killer, corrupt intervention just to cut some of the gens off, that seems to help with the early game gen patrol!
---
I think it’ll be a good perk for baby killers who are new to the game. It’ll help them learn where those points are on various maps and how to use them.
---
The fact you had a key should’ve made you a target to die way before this even should’ve happened
---
Wow, why didn’t I think of that?
---
True but I didn't start watching jojo's until like a couple months ago lol
---
It doesn't utilize her power, so sadly, no.
---
Out of the four I listed it's still the best.
---
Whenever I play as killer I always let the last guy live to be nice but we are kinda forced to play survivor since it takes forever to start out as a new killer...
---
not related but the legion doesnt inhabit a single being, they are just all there in the entities realm lmao
---
There's no specific build that's toxic. It's the playstyle that's toxic.
---
That said, don't be a toxic little shit
---
There could be a smoldering figure around the survivor doing the slashing so it wouldn't be complete stealth.
---
rest assured that billy wont be nerfed, because only bad players see him and his base kit as problematic.
---
Exactly. Takes the fun right out
---
That's kinda dumb its a perfectly fine mori, it doesn't have to use their power. It's just gotta look cool. By your definition hags also needs to be changed.
---
Knowing the developers they probably didn't even consider legion when making these killer perks. They accidentally made a good legion perk 😆
---
Nah it has a time and place.  Hard counters a sabo squad.
---
This is a dangerous idea. Do you really want pay to win?
---
Still better than a baby dwit
---
That's a longpig if I've ever seen one
---
&gt; and she’s now in the bottom 3 of killers
---
did you even need to ask if this is what he said?
---
I actually like Furtive Chase for niche builds. The constantly switching obsession alongside other obsession perks (Rancor works well with this) can cause some fun chaos.
---
They arent affected by amy terror radius effects. Incliding deep wounds. So you chase them and they either go down by an m1 or the timer runs out
---
*Insert Fortuneate Son
---
is BL toxic?
---
When's the last time you've seen a sabo squad?
---
I don’t want to make assumptions if someone is actually mentally deficient or not unless they’re being a dick directly to me but I guess you have a point
---
That'd be really odd. Definitely cool though. But I don't think it'd work with legion. It'd more have to be a character with other bodies that are inactive without him in it. Legion would be weird considering they're all different sentient people.
---
The simple solution to this is to make the timer pause while the Survivor is Oblivious, but not while the Killer is Undetectable.
---
Welcome to the DBD sub 😒
---
Yup. DCing dipshits get me killed way more then any killer. I blame BHVR. People always complain about FUN but will DC for ANY reason. I love when I'm a killer and get DCed on find their name in post lobby then go on to Reddit  to find them crying about how NOED or Spirt is OP but it's okay if they DC because they got downed first. Of course they never post they DC. I like solo because i get more of a thrill. Sorry. You know who you are that DC and you are dog shit. You will tell everyone how to play you and will take your ball and go home anytime you fell like it then go on Reddit like your a valid member of the community. Try it sometime. Search the name in lobby and find their post. Tells you what kind of shit for brains that person is. Yes killer camping and tunneling can be lame if it happens in a row.  Sorry. DCing is so distasteful to me. Because that person only cares about their fun and could care less about the people that stayed. Then go online and tell everybody how you should play.

Ghost face is infinitely stronger than myers. Not to say that Myers is bad but Ghost face is just better. I'd recommend checking out some of tru3s most recent ghost face videos to understand just what I'm talking about and why i say it.
---
What rank are you?
---
Its absolutely abysmal at green ranks and not enjoyable not worth playing. However it can be good at red rank.
---
As you say you can’t carry a team. After rank reset I find I’m the only oen working through Ruin, the rest just spend 10 minutes looking for the totem or blow up my gen. They go down in 5 seconds, have no game sense. I’m often the only one that manages to get gens done in the game.
---
Basically I feel like I have to work so hard at green ranks and sweat my ass off....and for all that effort there’s only a 10% chance of escaping.
---
At red ranks you get some potatoes but many games where everybody pulls their weight, everyone contributes their fair share and the work load is spread out....and then there’s like a 70% chance of escaping.
---
Sure its a little easy for survivors at red ranks but everyone contributes to the team and you have a fair chance at escaping. Low rank survivor asks so much of you for very little reward.
---
I SWEAR!!!!!!
---
Yeah, I'm a person that likes to play both sides and it's like 30 seconds for a game with survivor versus half an hour for one with killer
---
Yesterday
---
yeah now show the rest of the video
---
or people who just enjoy running that specific exhaust perk, you do realize that the BL change fixes none of the huge infinite right
---
I swear the team who designs outfits must laugh so hard when they brainstorm Dwight’s outfits!
---
Doesn't make it OK but the idea is that it's a cycle of toxicity. The only person who you can control is yourself, so... break the cycle.
---
Well, then you must be pretty lucky...or unlucky
---
Compared to other killers his chase times are crap but very consistent because his skill ceiling is low. He also doesn't slow the game down as much as one would think.
---
From the survivor's perspective, that super consistent chase time and slowing the game down slightly feels like you can't do anything to escape and all you do is mend all game.
---
Basically, most people hated old Legion and with this new perk he's very similar to old Legion.
---
Balanced Landing still needed the nerf. Plus, they are reworking Haddonfield and other broken maps.
---
I mean its extremely hinted at in the intro but yeah I just started watching part 4
---
You could say there were no real winners
---
Harvestors on corn maps can be turned into infinites, haddon field is a classic example. The tractors on autohaven can be if you have another title close by (which you almost always do)
---
Leave it to survivors to complain about a perk that *they* have to trigger for it to even work
---
People watch the intro?!? 0;
---
When the ugliness turns out to be a curse this is why you don’t play quinton
---
I personally find the Hag a good enough playable version of this but I also think the Blair Witch worked much better when you never saw her &amp; she wasn't a lanky jumpscare monster. As much as this movie was better than its original "sequel" it was still pretty bad &amp; dependent on jumpscares that had no meaning than to just be there y'know. I really did like the idea that different people stuck in the woods can experience differing lengths of time &amp; the stick figure moment was really good imo.
---
Never skip the intro in jojo's
---
the problem is that there's no terror radius when Nemesis (new obsession can't hear terror radius) and Beast of Prey (killer has no terror radius) are activate, meaning the DW timer is not paused, even when the killer still follows you, meaning you can't stop running away to mend and therefor will eventually get downed by DW without Legion having to actually hit you
---
I'm a novice. I'll keep that in mind.
---
I think it's gonna be with shards. If you mean totally free, no. But the theme seems to be that if it's not licensed it's just shards.
---
I guess.   
---
It must be the "Curse of the Goblin".
---
Wraith is addon dependent but not every killer should be spirit levels. They’re getting an average of two kills or more or they would buff them, which they have plans to do with the doctor next.
---
Good is an understatement lol
---
I do. Now I need everyone else to as well.
---
Whenever someone stuns you, they become the Obsession.
---
Every time the Obsession changes, they become Oblivious for 40 seconds and can't hear the Terror Radius.
---
I mean if you can only survive if you're on comms then that seems like your own fault.
---
Honestly who could do such a thing. 1-4 are the greatest anime opening to man kind (there's 2 openings in part 3)
---
You and everyone else
---
Q.Q shit man! I'm sorry!!
---
Beast of Prey will also make things miserable
---
The best bear.
---
you're absolutely right haha, i'm at green ranks right now (about to go down to purple) and usually i'd be further along by now as i usually make it to red before the season ends but i've just been super burnt out about this game.  it's like everyone in green ranks was born yesterday, idk why the people in it are so bad :P
---
Adrenaline is equal to NOED, their endgame perks why not let em be strong
---
I saw the original post a while back. Anyone knows where it is?
---
I was disappointed at first but no other exhaustion perks have an extra utility like BL does. It would be like lithe allowing you to vault faster passively or sprint burst letting you walk faster regularly. It will also make map balancing in the future a little better.
---
When Laurie was released, they didn't find a VA for her in time and gave her Meg's sounds for the time being as well.
---
Honestly, this is a welcome change for legion, it shouldnt be that every single killer becomes to weak to do anything vs survivors which is where we are headed with recent patches

You wont lose though because they will DC after 1 minute of chase.
---
He's pretty tall. I want to see a side by side with trapper.
---
Yea her name needs to be Karen with nails that long.
---
No? Nobody gets any points if the killer closes the game. 
---
Killer doesn't screw himself, he has the game in his hands with that.
---
I hope it jingles when he runs.
---
Same here
---
You get points for struggling on second phase, if you got Moried you never got those. Maybe what's that what you saw.
---
Uh what
---
This would be a weird one, but coordinate it with a swf so as soon as you get hit to injured the last gen goes off and you get a speed bonus away
---
Hopefully the first of a few patches to reduce the prevalence of insane loops on certain maps. Sad to see it go, but it’s probably easier to start with that so a single window in some future map doesn’t accidentally become a real infinite.
---
a major point he tries to make is that because they removed the lunge tech, you don't need balanced landing to use the harvester well.
---
however in the patch notes on PTB they have fixed this:
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that prevented Killers from lunge attacking on the hay block of the combine harvester in the Coldwind Farm maps.
---
which kinda invalidates that point
---
HAD THE SAME PROBLEM WITH BEING UNABLE TO USE M1 AND M2. MY GAME CRASHED SHORTLY AFTER. HAPPENED TWICE.
---
If you stab two times with franks mixtape and stab wounds study, its 15 seconds then down
---
I meant during his power. He'll basically be plague against a 4 man no mither though.
---
[cries in quentin]
---
That... definitely means that the game was designed around survivors not having voice comms. Designing around it and then balancing for something entirely different is more than a little silly.
---
i agree imo, people who dc about EVERYTHING are babies and shouldn't play competitive games if it bothers them that much, at least the next update is giving it a penalty
---
This is just a meme template. I dont understand how it's a spoiler. Besides if you dont want to see this "spoiler" just dont look at memes. But I'm sorry that you feel as though this meme just ruined the show for you.
---
I use BL all the time when I play survivor but it’s definitely a change that needed to happen.
---
By this logic like 15 killers needs major buffs if they are supposed to aim for "fun to play" from a killer perspective...
---
While not useful its not useless. It allows you to know the exact layout of every loop on the map. Keep in mind that every tile is randomly generated so the perk has its uses and will find a lot of play time from new players
---
I never use the moonwalk exploit and no legion uses that againts my  play with or againts  was fucking fun now its fucking boring
---
S-s-shirtless myers
---
Not really sure how it gives me an advantage over other players beyond just eliminating grind. The perks are no more effective than if you get them out of the bloodweb and players like scottjund don't play a killer until their perks are ready anyways so it just removes the waiting period some people feel obligated into
---
What I meant was that the thing that causes me to play a mean killer build is getting bullied by killers as opposed to being bullied by survivors as a killer. 
---
Besides, that's hardly toxic. It's just a mean build. I'm not disrespecting them.

Someday, Someday..
---
&gt; Regardless if you think she is overpowered or not, her power has a cooldown. Imagine she could spam that power at will AND have 115% movement speed?
---
your argument goes out the door when you take into consideration the developers have quite legitimately activated their DC soft-ban system for next patch (because of insane amounts of DC vs spirit), on top of the devs nerfing spirit themselves. there is no discussion here on if spirit is busted or not, because the devs have already played their cards and agreed she is overtuned, which they have addressed in ways.
---
&gt; and theres legitimately no loops anywhere?
---
l2p issue - either position better, or use sprint burst.
---
&gt; there seems to be no downside for liberally using your power in bad situations.
---
lol compared to what? a doctor shocking someone who knew they should run to the next loop as soon as he goes treatment mode? or how about a huntress who pulls out a hatchet at an inopportune time? you make it sound like if a billy starts revving a chainsaw, it automatically means you are downed, regardless of the scenario.
---
&gt; For me, personally, i would prefer the chainsaw sprint to have a cooldown, or for billys base movement speed top be reduced from 115%. Again, this is my opinion, but i feel he has too much in his kit.
---
this is a great change to hillbilly if you would like him to be trash, and for people to just pick up spirit/nurse instead (which I personally dont - I like going against killers that have a fair amount of counterplay)
---
if you asked me if hillbilly needed changes, I wouldnt say no - his addons need to be changed, because thats where its a grey area - shit like instasaw is not balanced, and crackbilly is insane, and because of that, they should be modified, much like how the nurse addons were changed.
---
No, just complete the gen. You can hide the game and when ur swf calls you over finish it. You could be a gen jockey and do it like I did on accident tho
---
Unfortunately players only have "fun" when they win. Why not have fun in general! Losing is a part of games.
---
Ok, I’ll give you that. However that’s one of the reasons I like this game so much, they do something different.
---
Because the games encouragement is what view to be a negligible amount. You would compare it to a real world attack? Are you kidding me? You have no idea what you're talking about. 
---
There is not single thing you could do in this game that amounts to intentionally wearing dangerous footwear where it shouldn't be. Specifically to perform a play in a physical sport with the intention of inflicting physical harm, possibly permanent. To another living human being. Essentially an actual premeditated armed assault.
---
We see the entire end game from start to finish. Unless you're claiming to have actually been in the killers head at the time. You no more evidence against them than anyone else here.
---
Quit trying to harass me with nonsense.
---
Or they rework Legion so hes got a specific distance in which the timer procs. And/or altering how quickly it decays when you are oblivious (i dont know any oblivious perks so feel free to prove me wrong)
---
Absolutely gorgeous, nice job. Love how you tied the look of the DLC trailer into it.
---
Weird since Unnerving Presence seems to not be affected by Oblivious
---
Gotta mix gas, and hag losses a little time teleporting
---
Sometimes I forget that the killer can't see their own red stain, and fail at stealth like this because the stain highlights me when it passes over me I run, thinking that because I was so obvious in the stain, the killer SURELY must have seen me lol
---
Except it is, and you'd know that if you've been playing for more than a month.
---
(to the tune of All Star)
---
Somebody once told me I was a fucking oni
---
Itll give you access to all the perks before everyone else. You will have an advantage. Do you mean like all tier 3 perks or tier 1? Cause that would definately give you an advantage at the release.
---
The fact that you can't hear the killer's terror radius from the perk said above should not mean that it acts like the killer doesn't have one at all
---
Update: Saw myself on hot! Woo!
---
I’ll try to get more interesting clips, I think I still have a few saved
---
please god tell me the bells on that dwight outfit jingle
---
As others said, you just have to be on it when it pops, not do 300% gen progress.
---
Try running Bond and maybe Prove Thyself or Better Together so you can get some herd immunity and finish them quickly.
---
I read it in a scottish accent did I win?
---
The difference is his has the character bonking a dbd character over the head, yours is a single picture. Imagine how much shit would be on the sub if they let any image fly if it even barely reminded you of dbd
---
I´ve been playing for a long time bro. It really is not.
---
Thank you! I love how neons look so I was very excited to draw this ahah
---
so the killer spends 1+ minute to get 1 guaranteed down, thats 60-70 sec add another 10 to get them to a hook. with a solo gen speed of 80 sec  and 3 other survivors you now have 3 done gens, so 1 hook has now cost the killer 3 gens, wow this must be op. X D While you are guaranteed to get downed, the speed of the process is still so slow that in that time any decent team will be bordering ending the game....
---
im... actually really weirdly impressed you made it to red without any exhaustion or healing perk. good on you my dood. will take your advice tho, small game seems pretty useful : D
---
I FUCKING HATE DEDICATED SERVERS, IT COMPLETELY RUINED SOME OF MY KILLER'S GAMEPLAY.
---
FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE PLAGUE SOMETIMES THE PUKE HITS SURVIVORS, THEY DO THE "OH NO I GOT PUKED ON" ANIMATION AND SOUND BUT THEY STAY HEALTHY, INFECTION DOESN'T START LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN HIT IN THE FIRST PLACE.
---
OR WITH THE TRAPPER YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO HAVE A SECOND BETWEEN SETTING UP A TRAP AND WALKING PAST IT WITHOUT BEING TRAPPED, BUT NOW WITH DEDICATED SERVERS AND HIGH PING I 100% ALWAYS IMMEDIATELY GET TRAPPED BY MY OWN TRAP I JUST PLACED.
---
I HATE DEDICATED SERVERS SO MUCH.
---
ALSO WHY IS THERE NO DEDICATED SERVER IN THE MIDDLE OF RUSSIA, IT SUCKS THAT THE CLOSEST SERVER (FRANKFURT) IS 6000 KILOMETERS AWAY AND I ALWAYS HAVE HIGH PING.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and I make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Guess it’s more just the little to no skill required to get the down, and you know legions are just gonna abuse it( because it’s broken).

After 800 hours the only thing I find fun in the game is looping. I use to use BL and SB together before the exhaustion nerf just for the passive because I despised the stagger effect. Sorry but it's the uninstall route for me.
---
The OP definitely has the evidence. He said so in other chains that the killer carried the survivor around acting like he was giving hatch
---
This was a simile, like saying someone’s a bull in a china shop. They don’t actually go to a china shop and knock over all the fine china. You blew this point way out of proportion, focusing on a small thing making two paragraphs of why the danger of using cleats in a baskettball game is much worse than this. Yes I know that a small injury all the way to brain damage is worse than a game.

---
Is it literally the same thing? What a dumb fucking thing to do.
---
Ah yes because tbagging prevents the killer from playing the game..
---
Am I missing something? The release date according to r/leaksdydaylight is December 3rd why are you downvoting him?
---
Legion is trash, just the play style Legion promotes is one people rightfully don't enjoy having to deal with. Not because it's good, or strong, or anything like that. It's just absolutely infuriating and annoying. Nobody liked him more towards release because all you had to do was stab someone and follow them without looking at them and it would cause Deep Wound to go down and if they were to stop to mend, you just down them it's that easy. Paired with a glitch based around one of his add-ons which made it that mends could take LITERALLY minutes by the end of a match and nobody wanted to deal with it and would DC often.
---
He eventually got changed to the point he's at currently and while it's still annoying because every Legion plays to stall out the game super long, it's winnable and realistically not that hard to win though again, still not fun. 
---
NOW it is being made where overall I'd say Legion is stronger aside from the way Deep Wound works which is that it's faster to mend out of, but with specifically the Nemesis perk that The Oni is coming with as well as I believe it's Beast of Prey, you can now stab a survivor and get either perk to trigger then continue running after them and they are guaranteed to die because both of those perks remove your terror radius which is what pauses the Deep Wound timer. You stab a survivor with Feral Frenzy, bloodlust them on a pallet with Beast of Prey OR get stunned/blinded by them with Nemesis and they are then put onto a I believe 15 second timer before they go down guaranteed and realistically there isn't much they can actually do about it. I think the main issue people have with it, or at least I got with it, is that it's boring gameplay and it's not even like it's good. Realistically speaking if Legion's play like that they're PROBABLY going to end up with 1 or 2 kills against a team that just gen rushes them because the entire build is kinda designed to just tunnel 1 person until you get them on a hook, but the issue is that it's not fun for anybody involved because all you're doing is either gen rushing or getting tunneled and because of the disadvantage Legion will be in relying on that set up you're getting taken off the hook probably expecting to just be tunneled again.
---
I'm sorry.
---
Wat?
---
So in a game I was camping purely because every survivor was nearby when I hooked a David and they must’ve thought I didn’t know. So the David died first hook purely because nobody in that SWF thought to distract me while someone walks into the basement, wait until I’m busy again. The only reason David died in the first minutes was because someone ran into the basement and everyone tried to get mileage of the shack pallet. I ended up camping the Meg because everyone else was around. Then I chased the Bill, who must’ve gotten like 20K bloodpoints. I hit him once, respected pallets. Chase went on for a good 5 minutes. He ended up dc as soon as I hit him again. When the game ended, he said he didn’t want to lose to a camper. AKA he didn’t want to lose to a person trying to find survivors around the hook, so he lost a pip and all bp just so I could get a little less bp than I would’ve

Pfft you call those heels? My grandma literally does walk in those shoes.

Give me a girl who's heels are so tall, you can hear them a mile away when she's walking around in shack or indoors so you KNOW she is that bitch and the killer's the one who should be running. I want executive business woman power
---

---
Yeah but most of the whiney cunts on the sub are brown ranks who don't understand that at decent ranks the killers don't play cheesey bullshit because it doesn't work vs purple or red rank survivors.

Devs will fix that before patch drops...
---
For new players? Absolutely it would and that might be a barrier for tweaking, yes, but for the majority of players, were already facing full level 3 perks in every game anyways.
---
I just want to be able to play killers I own but don't have the time to grind at the rank I'm playing them at without feeling like I'm going in with an arm tied behind my back. How would you do something like this but not have it be detrimental to new players?
---
I think if Lithe had the effect of guaranteeing a fast vault when not running but not yet exhausted, it’d be comparable to old BL, but no way that’s happening. We just gotta get used to it, I guess.

Hence me saying that’s what the PTB is for.
---
Well, I’ll be sure not to waste points on it. 
---
[gets it twice in his first nine blood webs]
---
Ok thank you
---
i mean, its what the devs are left with, if they were to actually give survivors some proper nerfs and actually nerf all the super strong things that makes it so survivors sided you would have even more survivors crying than what we get now with this legion.
---
STOP BMING ME WHEN YOURE EIGHT RANKS ABOVE ME \[SCREAMINGCAT.JPG\]
---
i also dont get it lol
---
Yes since it removed your terror radius and killer instinct is based on your terror radius.
---
Hags mori has been my favorite mori until now.
---
It’s pretty hard to pass gory stuff in Australia iirc. But yea I think the laziness of the company and the price are also contributing issues.
---
bonk
---
I find killer matches in ten seconds, survivor matches? A year in the good days
---
I'm a survivor more than a killer and I don't get the  frustration. If you can't lose the killer before Bloodlust kicks in you're just dead anyway cause they beat you on most loops.
---
This will stop people from trying to aggressively rush the killer and then loop them for 5 minutes. The killer is supposed to be scary to face 1 on 1. Use team work, get chased, disappear and switch chasees
---
That's not exactly what Legion did before the re-work. Legion before would purposely get out of chase but stay in the area, such as walking backwards or looking down. This one involves a pallet stun, and the legion still chases the survivor. Either way, Legion is guaranteed a down. The previous one, not so much because you could still accidentally see them or run close enough to initiate the chase.
---
Love OnlyWaifu! Loved her dark souls shit and I couldn't be happier she's doing DBD.
---
Agreed. It is equally frustrating to love playing legion and have everyone DC when you start the match because they think you are going to cheese them with a bullshit mechanic. BHVR needs to make this killer a welcome enjoyable addition to the game instead of an annoying nuisance or a busted mess.
---
u/Low_Thing u/Dante8411 I did this for y'all
---
Oh damn.
---
But then they could run Beast of Prey so when they get bloodlust, Legion still gets undetectable. It may be a cheesy strat and will never get you a 4k (assuming survivors aren’t potatoes), but running Beast of Prey and Nemesis together will get you guaranteed downs with no counterplay
---
&gt; giving up points and pips to the survivor
---
Why does this matter? Being the Killer is about killing survivors, not denying them pips for...some reason? If I wanted to deny pips I'd just facecamp some fuckin' guy, that's a guaranteed depip for him, isn't it?
---
Well it depends really how you look at it. If you're a fan of Evil Dead or just anything else Bruce Campbell worked on then I can understand your bias. However otherwise Ace is still clearly superior.  
---
First of all Ace has way more cosmetics which include sweet ass jackets, meanwhile Ash only has one. Sure it's good but you can't flex with it as well as with Ace's which on top of style also have variety. Ash also has reskin of default pants which costs 5 bucks so yeah...  
---
Second of all Ace has been longer in the game so people are more attached with him. He's also from original chapter that came with killer who's cosmetic combination allow you to cosplay Lisa Simpson from hit TV show The Simpsons. On top of that we got a swamp map, an iconic location from Dreamwork's animated movie trilogy, Shrek which also appeared in Shrek 2, Shrek Forever After and a halloween special Scared Shrekless. Ash came alone with no map, nor a killer, some people debate Danny is somewhat his killer but he's not, that's just straight up cheating. Even so there is still map missing.
---
The only redeeming quality about Ash is flip-flop, a perk that allows you to look at his face every game. However you can just mod icons so every perk would use the one flip-flop has, even killer perks.
---
Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.
---
If you know how to use him, bps are ez
---
Feel free to tell me I'm a massive asshole
---
We’re reaching levels of crossover that shouldn’t even be possible
---
&gt;well this subs gonna complain anyway.
---
As is tradition
---
&gt; Wraith: go invisible, survivor stands up all confused, Wraith starts slashing the survivor's limbs off while remaining in stealth
---
That sounds remarkably similar to the Spirit. I don’t think the Wraith would be overtly violent in his mori. He’s like the Nurse; they’re not “angry” killers.
---
I wish that were truth
---
I bet you were hiding in a locker 🤣
---
0% asshole. Jake 100% asshole for hiding and not trying to escape by doing the last Gen.
---
You thought this comment was going to be constructive BUT IT WAS MEEEE, DIOOOOOO
---
I understand you man. Teammates be trash sometimes. The fact of the matter is if you have a solid team,escaping is easy af
---
Not hearing the TR doesn't remove it though, Unnerving Presence still triggers
---
Honestly, spoilers or not, JoJo is a fucking ride
---
The game starts quickly before doing it
---
Nothing for Nea. Fun.
---
You mean the charge addon stack
---
oh hell yeah.
---
I was spirit today and the group of four survivors and 3 toolboxes 3-gened themselves. in the end, only one escaped (via hatch). i was called every curse word, a gay camper, tunneler, and "gg ez no skill you were lucky".
---
when they said "i got owned", i replied with "you were killed".
---
So wait will it turn on and off several times in a chase? Initial chase no bloodlust so it's on, bloodlust activates so it's off, make a hit it's on again, chase longer it's off again? That's uh... something for sure lol.
---
Only with Otzcheats get it now at Otzcheats.com
---
I feel like you're splitting hairs about the ratings thing. They purposefully toned it down to avoid being labeled as problematic, it doesn't really change my point. Is it a smart business move? Sure, but they can still be held accountable for the shitty animations that came out as a result. I like the game, but every time I see a mori I have no choice but to laugh at how stupid it looks.
---
I'm a PC player but not interested in PTB; let's wait together!
---
Its not human possible be able to find and down a competent survivor in less than 80 seconds and stop three different people of work in a gen if they are in different places
---
Thank you for being by my side going trough this tough time
---
Except he did not gave Misty away.
---
Other Killers masks is such an interesting concept! Leatherface with a Hillbilly mask running speed add-ons/perks would be so funny to watch lol.
---
Nah, this is totally a winnable situation as survivors if both commit to doing gens and can do well in chases. He was the asshole for leaving you to die, you don´t owe him the hatch.
---
This is why I play killer.
---
OVERLY AUTRUISTIC SURVIVORS THAT KEEP UNSAFE UNHOOKING EACH OTHER AND THEY ALL BECOME DEAD ON HOOK. THEN THEIR REASON FOR NOT COMING FOR ME IS THEY'D BE DEAD IF THE TRIED EVEN THOUGH I WAS ONLY ON FIRST HOOK...
---
Dead Hard, Decisive Strike, Borrowed Time, and We're Gonna Live Forever
---
It doesn't even take a 3 man swf anymore, just two can somehow bully you. Albeit not without randoms as casualties.
---
So f13 isnt a game in Australia?
---
I was unaware anyone had actually seen Sucker Punch.
---
I run decisive strike, borrowed time, WGLF, and self care. I wonder if self dare is the problem. The developers said no mither doesn’t work with it but maybe other perks are a problem too. 
---
You’re on PS4?
---
A 4-Man no mither is going to be a blood orb orgy, he’ll basically be a crazy fast M1 Killer. Everyone is already a 1-hit down so he won’t need to charge up a Demon Strike and he’ll be able to sustain Demon Dash easy peasy. Patrol gens and there will be crazy amounts of orbs to consume
---
Chill bro third tome ain't even out yet
---
Activate octo camo
---
THEN PERISH
---
No. I only protect if the exit gates are open or my teammate just needs that extra distance to reach a pallet or window in a crucial moment.
---
Legion withthat park can maintain a chase and let the bleed out kill someone like how he could before
---
If you mean nemesis, it’s good because the deep wound timer that legion inflicts using their power decreases while out of terror radius. This new perk will make anyone who stuns the killer oblivious for 1 minute, meaning they won’t be affected by the killer’s terror radius allowing legion to chase while the timer depletes.
---
As a Myers main, my corn vision 100
---
I mean, I feel your pain and understand what you're saying, but I feel like that's mostly what the game revolves around, the grind. You take that away and it's not near as special.
---
Im loving these cross overs,  omg we need a knight killer!!!!!!
---
We're in this together.
---
His map control will be average at best.
---
For Honor, Team Fortress and Dead by Daylight. And they said that Infinity War was the most ambitious crossover event in history!
---
I hope no one posted this before I had to open instagram to edit this and I hate that application
---
I mean, it always has been since the rework. It's one of the best perk combinations for most M1 killers.
---
That's how more content works, as more content gets released some are stronger (Ghostface, Spirit, Huntress, Nurse) and some are weaker (Legion, Doctor, Leathercace, Clown). Due to this power creep is near inevitable unless the balance team is top notch, which this one sadly isnt.
---
The drawing is great for sure but she has that slutty look all around.
---
...noone told me about the beast of prey thing
---
ive been trying to follow other peoples advice instead of my own invention. I used to use Beast of Prey all the time, but everyone told me it sucked....
---
Oh shoot really? So a Borrowed Time receptor gets hit, and if I turn on Night Shroud, it goes down?
---
So it's only fixed in PTB, not live yet?
---
*Looks at Ash* This is Brilliant
---
*Looks at Ace* But I like THIS.
---
I think that snowball will make him slightly worse than Ghostface, but still high tier
---
I’m thinking the reason Legion got nerfs with the QoL changes is because the devs knew this would be a spicy combo and had to balance it out. I’ll miss STBFL god Legion, but I’m actually excited to play him now.
---
We just know that we’re not gonna *get* those buffs. It’s gonna be the major nerf coming our way, and probably even more to compensate for this PTB mess.
---
My thoughts exactly
---
Nemesis isn’t reliable activation though. It doesn’t work on a survivor who’s already your obsession and whether a survivor stuns you is largely out of your hands. If survivors don’t want to stun a killer, they don’t have to.
---
You don’t have many games where you don’t get stunned because there isn’t a perk that obliviates survivors when a non obsession stuns. Bet that would change if you ran Nemesis Legion. It’s called adaptation.
---
Nothing from the PTB carries over
---
Basically you do your initial feral frenzy hit and the heartbeat happens since if you already have bloodlust, you just landed a hit and will now lose it and regain your terror radius. There shouldn't be a scenario that you can't use killer instinct with beast of prey. 
---
If you use something like Dark Devotion and hit your obsession first then killer instinct is based around your obsession's terror radius while active so you might not see it highlight on a survivor further away from the obsession, but right next to you if you went opposite directions for example.
---
Well I mean in his bio it did say that he designed  covers for hard rock bands. So I feel like he would have that as his chase music. Plus if they devs were  lasy they can just use legion's theme and change it a bit.
---
😐
---
Literally on the last second. Nice one.
---
Yes.
---
He forgot to rip out the tounge
---
BBQ does not need a nerf. It grants extra BP, and it gives some helpful info. This info is HELPFUL, but it isn't game breaking.
---
Wouldn't suit his palate
---
for some reason everyone on console is playing either ghostface or the demogorgon. it’s pretty annoying so they probably left when they saw it was another ghostface
---
Its game breaking
---
This wasn’t your fault, Jake completely disengaged in actual gameplay that’s on him
---
Laughed more than I should of
---
That’s weird, I just wanted to be a toxic basement dweller for a match
---
Okay, how so?
---
Because nobody here is going to agree to that. If that is game breaking, so is Kindred.
---
this happens to me a lot too. the best advice i could give is to be immersed for the first 30 seconds or so to find out where he/she is. they’ll patrol the nearest generators and then just leave since they assume survivors are elsewhere. if you’re working on the gen solo you can usually get about halfway progress before they come back!
---
Because you were a killer &amp; you tried to kill them. You’re supposed to leave them alone &amp; let them do gens in peace.
---
God why did they remove this from Netflix
---
The only reason I play legion is farming bloodpoints and trying out fun builds
---
No it’s on the PC. Hopefully the cross platforms deal will rectify the issue but I’m not too hopeful
---
If you're running and get hit you might get out in time, but otherwise it's like a faster, thinner, cannibal tantrum
---
Feng Min ahegao?
---
I might still main her later. Dunno, undecided.
---
Oh yeah sorry I forgot rule #5542
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dzamjg/internet_issue/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
What a ride it was
---
Lmao I had that happen in a shitshow game. Got hooked and immediately started yoinking, somehow yoinked myself off. Killer was still nearby, died anyway
---
The Christmas jumper Susie is absolutely precious and my man Bill is finally getting a new cosmetic! Hope this could mean more in the future. :0
---
Thats why i dont want to run the damn perk. Its too cheesy and really annoying for the killer.
---
Kindred is find object sucks ass. And everyone's wrong it basically tells you where everyone is that's broken.
---
If every killer uses it because its that good. Its broken. And it's that good it's used every game
---
so for why isnt jackie chan the survivor?
---
Considering they were nerfing the 'mending' time, I see little reason to want them to remove this.
---
Keep it until we can get a proper buff/fix for Legion.
---
Pretty sure that one is broken right now.
---
A less gory wraith could also use his bell. Kickthe survivor so he's sitting down Place the bell over their head and clang it a couple times the survivor goes invisible, screams but is cut short, wraith clangs it a couple times and the survivor reappears dead. 
---
It uses his mystical bell that we don't know much, and what happens to others who try to use it,  and I like my horror to have a couple open ended questions. What happens when they
---
thanks for the advice!
---
The one time i tries full sfw was me and the boys running adept david.
---
I was up against infinite freddy.
---
Oh the huntress main in me is pleased also may start playing dwight for that eyesore of a outfit, definitely smart to wear considering itll stand out wonderfully for the killer.
---
That is the complete opposite of what villain means.
---
 (in a film, novel, or play) a character whose evil actions or motives are important to the plot.
---
Rule #5542 is very important. No but seriously. If it’s a killer some people don’t enjoy playing against, it was either because of that or simply because it didn’t go their way lol
---
Demogorgon has been out for less than 3 months. Bubba has been out for well over a year...
