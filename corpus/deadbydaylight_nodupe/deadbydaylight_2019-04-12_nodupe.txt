Deja Vu is a sleeper counter to 3 gen strats

Im trying to be sequitor in my logic here. A hitbox does exist. Im a programmer. On a base level i can theorize how the skill works. Whether i understand the semantics of the specific lines is irrelevant. I use the skill all the time so i also like to think im versed on how to use it correctly. So it becomes a matter of identifying why in your video it didnt work. I know its buggy and inconsistent. But the more i stop blaming the skill and the more i understand how to use it, the more consistent it is. I don’t exaggerate when i say i get it working 90% of the time. SO idk man. My best 2 cents was latency.  It is BHVR and they are known for having a buggy game sooooo ya

# ゴゴゴゴ
---
Yea but what did you say in the blurred part lol
---
I was thinking about the bug that made Legion selectable.
---
Petition for Jane to get her sweater
---
Tell that to all the crybabies who want hex perks nerfed because they're too dumb/lazy to find totems.
---
Okay, I'm going to explain exactly what happened for those of you who are unaware. One of the survivors, likely the one who rage quit and disconnected, changed his Steam username to the same thing that the Killer is using while everyone else was playing. 
---

---
Then, in the post game lobby, the Survivor, who is now essentially impersonating the killer, starts shouting obscenities. I imagine this was done in an attempt to draw in reports. And evidently, the other Survivors bought it- *for a time.* 
---
That's some next level obsessive salt.
---
On the off chance that's legit someone's grave I hope he pressed F first.
---
If u play swf with any items at all the killer almost always leaves in the lobby. Since the console queue times are brutal it's not even worth bringing items because I just want to play the game.
---
The green NOED can instadown you because that's not the part of the effect that scales based on which level it is
---
You both sound pathetic here.
---
This dude made this account just to post this deal, twitter itself has 24 followers, most of which are "follow for follow", made a [Second account](https://www.reddit.com/user/haschaka123) just to comment on one of their own posts.

Shady AF, stay away.

she looked me up somehow and found out my actual name, lmao. I just respond whenever she sends another angry rant.

I’m on Ps4, so I don’t think he was on sale for us
---
LOL. He ain't slick
---
Literally kinda feeling like it for getting myself involved with this dude
---
CODE
---
&gt;Also, why the fuck can even a green NOED insta down you? 
---
It's a part of the devs rebalancing perks to be more consistent across levels. 
---
Anyways, I disagree with Deliverance having anything other than its current stats. If you're concerned about going down immediately after self-unhooking, bring Decisive Strike. In its current state, its best synergy is with Deliverance.
---
Almost everyone hates their job, let's be real
---
I meant for the long term, starting off as an employee there makes for great job experience actually
---
And Stab Wounds Study, not Cold Dirt.
---
Hrrrrnggh Im trying to sneak around but im dummy thicc and the clap from my ass cheeks keep alerting the killer﻿
---
I work in a cinema. I like my job lol
---
They should be though. 600 bold points for like 15-20 seconds. Stops no ed and games too short without ruin anyways. I dont run small game because a ping in my direction is garbage. Just highlight them within like 10 meters. Also why does it go off when you’re already working on the totem. Shits annoying

yes definitely!

When the next match it's not a Nurse but it's a Legion

It was the one escaped. The one who dcd his name was in green (he used chat)   unless someone pretended to be the dcd guy
---
Nah. I prefer Lee or Kenny
---
It really do be like that.
---
Hehehe you know it! Gotta live up to my Dwight instincts! Definitely wasn't trying to be sneaky around traps or anything like that and was on my 3rd hook. XD
---
Freddy mains when Freddy gets buffed
---
Hey &gt;:( what did the hag ever do to you?
---
It really depends who your co workers are and where you're located. My best and worst experiences were at McDonald's with the exception of my eight months at Wal mart. That was just miserable.
---
Bqc WI the Doctor as his shock attack gets points easy
---
I hate that there are perks that require you to strike a survivor 3 fucking times. It's a disaster.
---
Cool. So we're all in agreement that anyone can do what they want
---
You do realize that you specifically disliking certain killers is massively different from groups using 3rd party tools to grant them an advantage that the game isn't balanced around, right?
---
It would have been quicker but I had to take a break to level Ash up a bit haha
---
i kinda doubt that.
---
Huh. Almost like standing at the gate just to tbag.
---
The Entity gave the shotgun back because Ashy was just that scary, I don’t think him being brought here was intentional. At this point the killers are there to protect the Entity from Ash but MoM lets him keep getting away
---
Seriously guys it’s getting out of hand someone has to stop him
---
No clue. It must be because I'm a basement dweller who does absolutely nothing with their life except playing dbd. ( 300 hours lol) Just had a game where the survs yelled at me for camping as a crutch, even though they were hooked next to a 90% gen, last two people. I don't know what goes through these guys' brains.
---
*his bald
---
Sometimes the Survivors are just complete degenerate potatoes and I'll give the last Survivor the hatch as a result.
---
Me in the basement with LF
---
Dead hard, Mettle of man, ds. You have options. Borrowed should not affect the person using it. 
---
Yes, I agree you were in a shitty situation. But making shit worse for killer is not the answer.
---
Tru3 was only DCING NOT DERANKING SO HE COULD STAY AT RANK 2 AND NOT RANK ONE SO HE COULD GET INTO QUES TO PLAY GAMES. HE DOESNT DERANK TO BULLY PEOPLE.
---
lmao you being mad at the way the game is designed. Killers jobs is not to create a pleasant gaming experience for you, get over yourself. The entitlement is insane
---
BHVR is screwing with the audio again, for both sides.
---
How am I being entitled? I just said tunneling is scummy. You could say genrushing is a survivors objective because it it.
---
That makes me sad because i almost have p3 billy and i still have not seen barbeque...good for you though, happy to see someone getting some good luck on the bloodweb.
---
When they fix the invisible hex totem bug then I'll agree with you. Also, they should just remove the speed buff from killers with it. It sucks enough being 1 shotted and feels like such a cheap perk to have already. Especially when it comes to 1 hit killers like myers, LF, billy and huntress if she's using iri heads. The part I hate most about the speed boost are the people that use noed are already using 115% killers already. The buff on those killers is obnoxious and even more so if they're using other perks like play with your food. They become ungodly fast and there's no counter to it. Just pray there's a pallet left nearby.
---
Would have been way more satisfying if you weren't the one T-bagging after the pallet stun, made it pretty hard to give it an upvote
---
Billy’s got a perk that causes his Terror Radius to be 0 for 8/10/12 seconds if a generator reaches 85% completion.  It can absolutely proc during a chase which is horrifically disorienting when you don’t know what’s going on.
---
Ah, yes.  [The Classic.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/atpdc4/a_tragedy/)
---
I wouldn't mind P3ing Jane myself.
---
At first I was referring legion as “he” then I noticed a lot of people saying “she” that and “she” this. When the legion screams, it sounds like a man which got me confused
---
Thank God for the financially irresponsible for fueling games for us tightwads.
---
No, dropped him a few feet away from the hatch then took him to the hook :).......... JK took this screenshot from a streamer he didn’t end up surviving unfortunately
---
Not to burst your bubble or anything, but Twitch bits ToS forbids selling items for bits, so be careful with that.
---
Ikr, made it hard to be satisfied since this kind of made me feel like claudette deserved the same fate
---
Last time I checked i wasn't mad at anyone.
---
That's what I said
---
I was wondering the exact same thing
---
I guess that explains billy, however I didn't get a terror radius for a lot more than 12 seconds.
---
I did the same thing 2 minutes later after  Ash released
---
When referring to Legion in general I use them, in game or about a specific member I use (s)he. I usually identify it as a Susie, Julie, Joey, or Frank. Franks usually tunnel with FF, Julies camp, Susies are boosted (me), and Joey’s are usually the assholes that moonwalk in my experience.
---
If I may, i'd like to recommend "Borrowed Time" for your build, nothing is more appreciated than the ability to safely unhook a survivor against a killer who is patrolling the hook or even hard face camping, and fuck me is it satisfying to do, especially when exit gates are open
---
Getting angry at your own team for trying 2 save you.
---
Are you suppose to be a big deal or something? Why would anyone just randomly want to add you.
---
Do tell, what show is this? Those subtitles are selling me, looks a bit like Archer.
---
I'd have to argue the scratched mirror, someone running Spine Chill (like I tend to do) can easily wreck you, plus with the reduced speed of tier 1 and the fact that it's only viable at Lery's memorial makes it that more niche. That being said, I feel his varying terror radii is a very good trait about him, with that new Infectious Fright perk giving him yet another potential build in his arsenal. One potential argument is that Infectious Fright is countered by Calm Spirit, but Calm Spirit isn't ran as much as Spine Chill from what I've experienced.
---
Nope just put this here cuz ive nade quite a few psn friends off this reddit and I'm always looking for more to play with.
---
With an attitude like yours, though? I dont think anyone would want to play with you.
---
It's like Where's Waldo on steroids.
---
Lose the ability to say anything about the state of the game when you call ruin op
---
Thanks man
---
This brought such a smile to my face. Actually laughed in glee when you framed him right in front of her. Absolutely made my day!
---
he was close to the exit gates and full heatlh also i was not close to him (about 60 meters away)
---
I don’t mind trying to save but if it’s clearly a bad risk I’d rather they escape and the killer gets a maximum of 1 (or 2 at a stretch) kill than a 3-4K bc of stupid hook dives the only reason camping is viable is people not playing the counters to it and trying to save or not doing gems camping would not be such a prevalent tactic if people actually played to its strengths instead of its weaknesses which is why when I have a swf (which isn’t often bc I like solo queuing ) if I’m being facecamped I tell them to just get gens as it punishes the camper and if there are room boxes out then they can easily get 4ish gens done by the time I die on hook.
---
Joey and Susie are the objectively cool ones, it’s why they cost extra
---
Dedicated servers are coming. That will help.
---
Live together, die alone.
---
and that's why people dc
---
I feel so personally attacked by this.
---
Just disappointing.
---
happy cake day
---
In other words, that wiggle bar never goes away.
---
Its just not just because they can troll. Its also that if there are 3 people in the basement then it is impossible for them to make it up the stairs without getting hit because the killer hits one then keeps body blocking the rest. Its just dumb, you should be able to run around by making it a foot or a few feet wider or however wider it would need to be to not fully block it just by standing in the middle
---
*GenDEr FluiDItY*
---
But why is it a reportable offense (taking game hostage) if that's intentionally part of the "danger"?
---
Lol dedicated servers aren’t going to fix everything. There will still be a lot of problems that need attention way before they decide to fix the way a character looks.
---
Okay that is hilarious.
---
Oh shit! I didn't even notice it was my cake day lol. Thank you!
---
And yep. It didn't matter if I was walking, running, crouching, or even on the hook. The wiggle prompt never went away and it caused me to spaz out when moving.
---
Delete this now
---
It’s a shitpost...
---
Greg, from tech support about to drop an update bomb.
---
Does the dc cancel the animation?
---
No, because you're so shit at killer that you cant play without a shit perk. Which btw is the very definition of a crutch.
---
Lol I'm sure you did
---
My first thought after seeing this, so cool!
---
This started happening to me after the "hot fix" patch lol.
---
You'd think that they'd have fixed how ridiculously invisible she can get by now....
---
ebony mori boy talking about toxic.
---
Yeah it did :( really sad cause moris are so rare, and getting he opportunity to use it is like the best part of being a killer....
---
Ew
---
Nope . It's does nothing for the survivor and punishes the killer in no way
---
What's so toxic? You still got your mori
---
WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS? CAPS LOCK MOTHER FUCKER! THIS MAKES ME RAGE
---
"attempt escape"
---
Ha, that percent chance is 0 with a black hole bruther
---
Looks like a lot of out of context comments....
---
Darn\*
---
Maybe if the devs actually listened and completely fixed the games design then that wouldn't be necessary, but we all know they will never do that. As long as the meta techniques are unfun I will promote both sides to do what they can to make the game funner for everyone. As killer I don't enjoy tunneling, camping, running BS perks, and I know survivors also don't enjoy that. Instead I play in a way that might handicap me, but makes the game funner for everyone else. The result is getting better at other aspects like headgames, pathing, etc. In the end, I'm just as likely to win since I improved my core skills rather than simply use the sauce of the day.
---
Seriously? I play killer and survivor, but this is just biased, unbalanced and needless.
---
Good thing you can have your chinese gamer princess with at least 1 Groovy perk ;)
---
Amazing :) props to ya

He has turned into a meme among french people because of how he reacted when he got arrested and with this gif at a tribunal like 2 weeks ago.
---
I'm using it now to get the 100 hooks destroyed achievement, but yeah, once that is complete I'll likely never use it again.
---
Why did you feel the need to provoke him by starting conversation
---
Yes lol
---
Literally shaking and crying
---
You fink-rats will be the mustard on the bread that is my hooks!
---
Omg yes please I will die happy when they will finally release it that or I'll Devour hope them &gt;:D
---
There should be a killer perk called "Racist". It allows you to see dark skinned characters white.
---
The funny part is that it would be A or S tier killer perk
---
Claudette is basically John Cena
---
He's just a norwood 3 smh he still got some hair
---
You must of been getting good teammates, the people I play with can’t dodge shit and get downed in the first 30 seconds.
---
YES!
---
I was gonna go on a section by section dissection (ha) of why OP is wrong, but yeah. It basically boils down to this. I had a discussion about a similar topic with someone else here, and we came to the conclusion that the reason why survivors aren't having fun anymore comes to this: it's a combination of tribal mentality and the game having been so unbalanced for so long, they've gotten used to being the power role (when, and especially in a horror game based on slasher movies, survivors should have never been the power role to begin with).
---
It's on the list. I am stuck between leveling up Bill for Borrowed Time (and then prestiging Dwight for better chances on skills I lack) or leveling up Plague for her Obsession Talent (and then prestiging Doctor for same reason) for maximum lulz.
---
I have certain builds that rely on it. But the only reason I don't like running it is mostly because I prefer to get all my kills before the exits are powered. Endgame builds are awesome and all, but I guess my playstyle is more preemptive and active.
---
Need to get NOED as well
---
Its been a problem on pc as well. Seen multiple footage of it. Also I’m using a lan cable not just wifi connection.
---
You need to bring certain add ons
---
Adding those emblems looks like your bragging, hence this hostility, good luck though.
---
what did tapp ever do to deserve such harassment
---
Yare yare
---
I once passed out while waiting to connect to a match, and when I woke up, I'd somehow scored ~460 points. It was like putting just my name on a test and nothing else lol
---
If someone literally spawns on it and it’s gone in the first 30 seconds I’m gone, if the games gonna screw me over with that RNG, I’m not staying.
---
I'm usually so horrified by the cutscene that I'm too stunned to do anything, let alone disconnect. The first time I saw a Hag mori I think I peed a little
---
It will only always apply to 7 gen patrols since it teaches you two things ;
---
1- To traverse and view the whole map in the least amount of time possible.
---
2- To understand how to properly patrol interest points. 
---
On some maps, you do not have to actually see a gen to know if it has been worked on or if it is being worked on. The other way around too is true, on some maps you do not have to get close to the gen to know if it is being worked on or has been worked on.
---
Shelter Woods and Lery's are both two complete opposite maps to greatly practice this. 
---
As for the main point, yes there are some free gens for the survivors like on Coal Tower, Fractured Cowshed and the rest like that, and the best decision will be to focus on 6 gens. But it is still not that way out of position for you to not know where the survivor's are. It's more about knowing their whereabout, rather than chasing them off the gen.
---
I had this happen once, and while I still managed to survive I had to message the killer and apologize cause it looked like I was teabagging him during chases
---
Some people are just toxic, &amp; some people think, “ hey i can hide which means I’m so much better at this game then the killer. “ this game in general is just toxic yet we all stay for it.
---
I sewer to god half of this sub needs Jesus, the other half need a psychiatrist, and you sir/madam, need both.
---
It was a Claudette wasn’t it
---
uh hope mclean never reads this but quentin's high pitched fall sound is adorable
---
Another problem I've seen is people disconnecting from the host. Sometimes random survs just DC because someones internet took a dump. 
---
Imo it's been happening a lot more recently since these past updates. My friend DCs at least every 4ish games.
---
However the pipping system and lack of consquences have made a terrible equation of survs not giving a shit anymore and doing what they want, even ass fucking everyone elses fun.
---
yeah while spine chill triumps all stealth perks EW tier 1 gives him immunity to all detection perks
---
Really? I can't read it fine, huh.
---
But yeah, one of the guys I deathhooked changed his steam name to be like mine while we finished the game, insulted the survivors like I was being a cocky killer and probably tried to get them to report me through that.
---
Ten bucks says yes.
---
It doesnt matter that the perk is op, just do the overly tedious/time consuming conterplay despite the fact there is no guarantee they will even have the perk in the first place.
---
A man of culture, I see.
---
Thrill of the hunt activates
---
For every 1 person that dies to blood warden 9 escape anyways. 
---
Solo players usually just leave right away and SWF will communicate so you'll catch maybe one person by surprise and the rest will wait it out.
---
Maybe next time this issue arises, in the post game screen, see if the killer is running any perks that reduces his/her terror radius in any situation?
---
My mains collide.
---
Exactly what I do.
---
MoM came in clutch for me last night against a face camper. Allowed me to take the extra hit and rescue my ally for both of us to escape.
---
tHaT'S bEiNg a bULlY bRUh !
---
Wait, where can I find this format?
---
The emblems are my profile banner
---
Yeah! 😂😂😂
---
Shit like this is why I quit the game.  Standing in the end area and being hit should be an automatic kill.  Its corny as fuck and destroys the theme of the game for survivors to do nothing but bm the entire game.
---
I agreed with you for a few minutes, now I agree with her, you tunneled her, then fucking face camped like a little bitch.
---
He’s too old for this shit.
---
Feng SQUEAKS when she cleanses totems I giggle every time
---
This is my build. Except for NOLB. That's just silly.
---
So not even Premonition or aura perks like Dark Sense?
---
Maybe they should give us one then since everyone's thinking the same thing. And before you say swf would ruin it idc about swf.

Rather be safe than sorry... plus its easy blood points..
---
It's why any addons that are focused on feral frenzy's movement and not the status effect it applies onto a survivor (deep wounds) on the list are more likely to be on the side of being fine no matter the buffs/nerfs that could be made directly to Legion instead of on the left.
---
Double CoolDown is only on the right because it uses one part of the killer's ability, but ignores another. And ignoring mechanics in the game hasn't ever lead to a killer that is enjoyable for both sides to play as or against.
---
That's not my experience with it. I've played for like 200 hours and have only seen it not get cleansed a handful of times. As a killer if I use it I promise you 100% it will be cleansed before I find anyone.

I dunno about that, some people are impossible to catch

I don't get it. His bald what?
---
That was me earlier today, I spawned in the corn (coldwind farm map) and I ran to the closest gen to me and I passed by a lit up totem but decided not to cleanse it right away until I was sure there was ruin. So I went to the gen to find out there is ruin and then went back to the lit up totem and sure enough it was ruin. 
---
*laughs in evil*
---
I don't see anything in regards to perks
---
Summoning the power of the entity.
---
OoO does work with Freddy. Only in the dream world though. It's like a longer premonition that reveals you when you're awake. Very awkward to use but working as intended.
---
If you lose a match, **no matter what**, always say "GG ty for daily."
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Even if you didn't accomplish your daily.
---
Even if you weren't doing a daily in the first place.
---
Always say, "GG ty for daily."
---
Then leave immediately.
---
*Works every time.*
---
How this guy plays any game is beyond me if he disconnects after every 15 second chase
---
Not saying he's a bad killer. I'd say he's midtier.
---
The only thing that sucks is when you random scream in T3 and they cuck you from jumping a window or throwing down a pallet at crucial moments. 
---
Other than that he is pretty good to me.
---
PM me your gamertag (:
---
Yeah its not a very good perk against like half the killers tbh.
---
I agree, killers get away with so much body blocking its ridiculous.  I've had the plague trap me in the bathroom on the game and just stand there and puke and puke until I'm broken then just smack me down... I hate that's theres no counter to being 
---
 trapped. The basement mechanic is broken and purely killer sided.  
---
Pig and wraiths are the worst!!
---
Survivor entitlement: the post
---
I'll also go ahead and say that I'm glad that you recognized that Stab Wounds Study is way more evil to combine with Frank's than Cold Dirt. 
---
Cold Dirt and Joey's is powerful, yes, but it requires more skill than Frank's/SWS.
---
Not when they can’t tell he’s coming, cause you’d only run it on Lery’s and the Game. He can get close enough to pull people off gens or at least get a hit in.
---
Spirit!
---
Execute order 666
---
Anything but Legion!
---
Wow I freaked out so hard, I laughed.
---
Why's he shit a ball?
---
It hurts more with Aftercare though, because it's like a special little connection after helping each other, only to be betrayed :'(
---
MoM is a fairly balanced perk. All it would really need is to apply exhaustion or broken to be completely balanced against the other half of the roster that can actually proc it. Its only really useful against less than half the killers. The others have ways to counter it via their power or just sheer speed, and/or addons that can instadown. Plus when the player heals the killer can always see them until the killer downs them again. Id say thats a fairly balanced perk.
---
I can't speak for console bugs, though of course it's still a bug so maybe it'll be fixed in the next decade (if you're lucky, Im fully aware behaviour is lazy as shit when it comes to bugs), though the way you describe the bug makes it seem like Small Game would be invaluable for finding those bugged totems. 
---
"Waste of a perk slot" is a weak argument for survivors IMHO, besides Borrowed Time, there's no perks that should be considered "mandatory", you can be able to survive in chases without the assistance of any perks, they can just help depending on your play style. If you don't have a perk you can look at and go "maybe I could swap x out for y" there is a genuine possibility that you're too reliant on your build.
---
If Im playing solo queue and I get tunneled, sucks for me I guess, if I get farmed and die because of survivors without BT, NOED isn't my problem. I clearly state the problem is survivors that complain about NOED yet don't take preventative measures, not "If you take small game but get tunneled, NOED is your fault"
---
Your scenario of "you decide to kite the killer" makes no sense. If you want to ensure noed gets prevented, you wouldn't go "Im going to make sure Im chased an entire game and prevent myself from doing totems". That's clearly counter productive, why in the world you'd ever RELY on randoms to cleanse totems is beyond me. 
---
The arguement of "The totem count can get fucked up in SWF" also makes little sense and sounds more like a problem of poor communication over anything else. If someone unironically forgets that they didn't complete a totem because a killer found them then they might want to see someone about their memory. The difference between "Im doing a totem" and "I've done x totems" is pretty obvious. "How many totems has everyone done" is an easy question to ask when you think 5 totems have been cleansed and you want to make sure.
---
"Realistically" there is no reason why preventing NOED isn't as simple as cleanse 5 totems outside of a **bug**, yes there are games where you get tunneled and the killer gets NOED because of that, but at that point it's out of your control, if other people die to it after that, your hands are clean because you gave them enough time to cleanse totems and they didn't. 
---
The difference between pre nerf DS and NOED is you can actually avoid NOED and getting hit by it is the fault of the survivors as a team, meanwhile DS had no way of avoiding it outside of dribbling (Which let's be honest was essentially an exploit turned "legit strategy" which wasn't fun to do) and the nerf has turned it into a perk which has a genuine use against a killer who tunnels you. The new DS punishes tunnelers, the old DS punished killers who downed people with the perk. Getting hit by DS is your fault as a killer, not something that happens because a survivor took a get out of jail free card.

As someone who plays both sides its important to state that NOED helps the balance of DBD simply by existing, you either do gens as fast as possible and risk noed, or you slow down slightly and cleanse totems while you play to prevent it. The fear of NOED creates a secondary objective which makes the games slightly longer and more fun for the killer and if the survivors decided to rush generators without doing totems, killer's that took NOED will have fun because you've gifted them one of the most powerful perks in the game through inaction.
---
no idea
---
I would go for Spirit! She’s probably the best out of those you listed, and she’s definitely the most fun for me. :) Also worth it for the pebble on the survivor side...
---
Clowns great for loops though. Not a lot of other killers have useful abilities anyways.
---
Well then people will keep d/cing. You can always bring whispers. Moris should be hard to achieve. It would still be the most powerful offering.
---
It could be a reference to their internet connection. The red ping = McDonald's wifi is a common joke. Though specifically referring to them working there might mean more what you're saying. I always tell people to enjoy their nuggets after the Michael Myers blinks around the map like a Nurse.
---
Be good at chases, do like 2 gens, rescue people with borrowed time, dont get salty.
---
Um, wasn’t her mom was killed by a deer? 
---
I don’t think good memories would come from that. 
---
But I still love the idea.
---
I’d still buy it. 🤷‍♀️
---
The game isn't fun at this point, and who cares about pips. Just disconnect until you get some killer you can bully, rinse, repeat.
---
Playing killer is 20x more fun, but fuck the queue times.
---
I had that, except the killer was Myers, pre-tier 1, and was a totem-camping puppy.
---
Im sorry to hear that love. Hope youre alright now!
---
Instead of loading yourself up with perks you think are the strongest, choose perks that counter the type of killer behavior you hate the most. Hate tunnelers? Take DS/MoM, for example.
---
Turns out it was only were gonna live forever
---
Pebble OP! Gather your pebbles my brethren. Its time to bamboozle killers into oblivion!!!
---
What are u looking for in terms of play style? Legion and Spirit are both movement based while Clown and Plague are projectile based.
---
The first year and a half of this game's life the developers catered exclusively to the survivors. Killing today wasn't nearly as bad as it was then. It still sucks ass for low tier killers, but a killer main can still have fun if they know where to find it.
---
Survivors are entitled af now because they keep getting their OP toys taken away. They're used to the way things were, with infinite loops, infinite window vaults, exhaustion perks that recovered while running, etc.
---
You could go all Meta with MoM, DS, Sprint Burst, and Dead Hard.
---
*PLOT TWIST*
---
They all dead anyway, so does his "sacrifice" really matter?
---
Not using ruin at rank 1 against a coordinated team and still pipping 
---
+500
---
you beat me to it. it's so funny.
---
lol then y are u still here
---
memes
---
What rank?
---
Hag is amazing and very fun, also her mori is the best to spam
---
I love how the origin of this meme got its name. Like tru democracy.
---
Most of those nerfs were kind of needed tbh. I mostly play survivor myself and the only that makes me not want to play is the hitboxes. Because hitboxes screw me over literally every match, even with green ping matches.
---
Yea, when i have time. I will have 2 Weeks of vacation soon.
---
Recommend spine chill, the perk will let you know when the killer is looking at you and has no cool down. Another plus is that it will never go to waste because of its versatility’s other killers.
---
when u gotta bring ur friend into this. Big oof
---
The pig is a 110% movespeed killer with no way to end chases, the way you counter the pig is getting good at looping.
---
I believe some perks are crutches like old Decisive strike but not all of them are. Perks are there to offer verity in game play and both sides can have 4 perks so It not like using any perks is using crutches. If we didn't have perks that made a big difference in game play then we would lack verity and spice and the game would be much less fun.
---
I would use spine chill over premonition. Spine chill doesn't have a cooldown and premonition is somewhat vague when it comes to killer direction. Spine chill let's you know when the killer is looking in your direct location within a specific range. Also not to nitpick, but the pig is female Haha good luck in future matches!
---
LUL you are the biggest hypocrite I know. Do I need to post screenshots of “your friend” /u/hazerkillz sent to Jimbles when they rushed to your defense? OmegaOof
---
LMAO BUT YOU GOT HAZERZKILLZ TO DO THAT TO ME FIRST THOUGH
---
I hated yesterday, as a R17 I got put against a R2 Plague.  Hope it's never That bad again.
---
Mods, this isn't a shitpost; it's adorable.
---
Hey again dude, remember how we fucking ended this bullshit over playstation? if you don't remember go ahead and recheck it. this shit is getting so annoying. if you want me to delete this shit I will. I'm so done with this shit. PLEASE LEAVE ME TF ALONE
---
Legion's weak if you play him correctly but strong and annoying if you play him the wrong way. Plag is the same way. If you're on PC, go for clown or spirit.
---
imagine losing your marbles when you get called out for doing the same thing you act like you have any right to get upset over 😂
---
He never said we're artists, just that we might use them as ideas for an actual tat. This person has amazing artistic skills. And Blitz is right. I love Humtress and Plague
---
Alternatively, when you open the gates and about to go back for the rescue but then the notification for NOED pops up
---
I mean they can be a crutch but usually they just assist me or extend time before a down. Maybe I want to bring sneaky perks or perks that help me run. It can help you so it depends.
---
I'm not losing my shit, I'm asking for you fucking assholes to leave me tf alone.
---
I play killer and survivor so I see both sides of the spectrum. I only play dirty if the other person does. I just want to have a good time. If the other person wants to play stand in place simulator that's their problem.
---
If you can why can’t we right? It’s only fair. Except when you get called on your lies and hypocrisy you want to run away now? Buh-bye Baby Survivor. And it’s BF (for Jimbles). BFF sounds too long term and I’m afraid of commitment.
---
Try it next time. Leave someone mid chase if its taking a while. Most of the time you'll catch another survivor off guard and that first one will overextend for a hook or another survivor will have to go for the hook so the longer chase doesnt hurt your game as much.
---
Has anyone ever noticed that with Windows of Opportunity, with proper positioning, you can see fellow survivor auras anywhere on the map?
---
There’s a dull ‘shadow’ blob in the highlighted yellow areas, and you can see that it’s a survivor. I’m not sure what all else this works for, like if it shows killers too, but it’s a really neat extra ability that it has. I’m sure it’s completely unintentional.
---
Alternatively, when the killer slugs everyone and picks me (Ash) up last and a gate is open. Flip flop-ed that ass and escaped lol
---
your so childish she's trying to end the whole thing so you idiots stop and you keep going for no reason. it's just sad at this point leave it alone
---
Congratulations!
---
Now you can never play again. Time for Civ 5.
---
I run BT just in case I have to go in for the save. Sometimes I forget I need to unhook in the Terror Radius, but sometimes they’re still nearby that I can do it and help take a hit after they get hit.
---
The only other thing I’ll say is that BT works really well when your other teammates are helping out by trying to distract the killer/taking a hit.
---
So you're going to commission someone for a tattoo that you're not even going to be able to get another artist to use?...
---
I need more Mike Monroe. He's badass
---
If you are that easily annoyed maybe leave the sub?
---
Well even he stated that he went down to 4-5 so at least get that part right if you’re going to go all caps...
---
Read again please. My issue was with kittychipz being called a hypocrite when that doesn’t make any sense.
---
this whole thing has been ended for hours. can you guys actually go find something better to do with your time? if this is the highlight of your day I'm deeply sorry, your parents must so proud
---
I haven't been playing too much recently, but I hope this fixes the absolutely stupid issue with how many emblems you need high ranks on for a double pip.
---
I'm at rank 20 or around it, I simply haven't been wanting to play the game since Legion came out due to a number of different issues but occasionally my friend and I will play anyways. The other day I got 2 Iridescent emblems, I believe 1 gold and a bronze. The bronze emblem was for Benevolent which requires me to unhook and heal teammates and such, however the killer just wasn't doing well enough and in turn I literally had I think 1 maybe 2 opportunities the entire time to heal a teammate and no unhook potential. It was borderline, if not LITERALLY impossible to double pip when I have to get both evader and lightbringer iridescent if the killer wasn't good enough to open up benevolent for me.
---
What about the hoodie is attached to the head and as for the body cosmetic, it's just the shirt. Then they wouldn't have to make every head cosmetic compatible with this one body cosmetic and players could wear whatever body cosmetic they wanted with the hoodie
---
Ok, explain how kittychipz is a hypocrite then. Dying to hear it. Let me guess, you are going to explain the difference in motivation between their derankings....which again just proves you don’t know what the word means.
---
We -just- got a picture of one and now you’re wanting to smash them together. This is why we can’t have nice ungodly-massive singularities.
---
Ignoring all of your nice comments about my train of thought let's think this through again cause it seems like you read my comment but didn't use your brain whilst doing that.
---
Slugging them was gonna be for the three minutes that hooks stay sabotaged and not forever. I didn't say waste your pips on swf. And I also didn't say that we should ignore problems. It's just that swf is a problem that (beginner) killers have which makes it not worth mentioning before problems like DS or Legion which affect more players. 
---
Why do you think making everyone search longer for a game is in any way useful?
---
If somebody would look at this game as a neutral person, they would likely mention balancing that needs to be done before highlighting swf and making the game more of a r/choosingbeggars.
---
Bro are you really using those blades that you know are bugged?
---
I agree with you man. There’s some really cool outfits I wanna buy like Dwight’s pizza outfit but I just can’t make myself pay $10 for it, it’s so overpriced.
---
too*
---
*too
---
She's actually the only killer I enjoy but it's not a serious post
---
I was also rank 12 at the time so that's also a part of it lol
---
necks and head tilts are my main weakness as you can see from huntress and pig. Thanks for the tips :D
---
i don't think any of those are toxic. they both are just annoying, i didn't imply anything. i also find Tinkerer on Billy annoying. well, i find Billy annoying and wish they'd remove him but that's my thing. 
---
i thought it's pretty obvious that my stand is that Beads paired with full hex build is toxic. no idea why people got touchy here.
---
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll get your kids back. I have faith in you. ❤
---
I WOULDVE LAUHGED IF THE DAY 3 SURVIVORS FORCE CLOSED DBD I USED SPLINTER OR SHROUD FFS
---
"He downs me in 1 hit" Thats literally impossible for the pig without special perks.
---
Is... is this Lost?
---
That’s what I though too for a bit. Haha
---
fair enough. but trust me, i did not face camp. i didn't even patrol. i didn't stay by hooks knowing damn well there's someone about to unhook. 
---
it's funny how when you really play casual and just interested in chase survivors assume you're a bitch with no skill.
---
Watch a few Tru3 videos and read his comments lol
---
there’s a HUGE difference to why one is a hypocrite and the other isn’t. kitty said she wouldn’t derank to bully yet she does. tru3 isn’t deranking TO BULLY he is or i should say was, deranking in order to get games. he wasn’t going to a completely different colored rank to bully people, he was staying at rank 2. kitty had purposely deranked to a different color in order to bully. you understand it now or do i need to use different vocabulary so you can fuckin understand?
---
Yes it was mentioned in one of the earlier comments. Still.
---
Ya
---
The issue is that theres a chance the killer has NOED, and to dedicate time that could  be used to progress the game it isnt the smart play, due to the fact you will never know if the killer has NOED, also take into consideration that that perk slot for small game can be used for better perks.   
---
So should I sacrifice a whole perk slot and 70 seconds on the off chance NOED is in play.   
---
Thats the issue, Even on killer side I just laugh that they are breaking totems because I generally play weaker killers, like wraith, freddy, etc. so they just waste time because generally people expect NOED on weak killers, and tbh it gives me so much extra time that I really dont deserve
---
Am I the only one who thinks Hex Totmes are a bit overrated?
---
It's really not,  then get a match against the plague just to get borderline camped then tunneled the whole match. Games starting to die,  if they don't fix the issues it has.
---
The totems spawn in the same places every single game. They're usually in plain sight. The only maps where they're decently hidden are the swamp, lerys, and the game. As for MoM not working against insta-downs, it still works if the person is injured when they're hit. Regardless of the type of hit. Sure if they get healed up while they have MoM then they'll go down from healthy in one hit. This does not mean MoM isn't broken. Make Your Choice is only good on killers that can be fast enough to actually make it back quick enough to track the unhooking survivor. Nurse/Billy/Spirit. It's pretty useless on anyone else. Rancor works on exactly one person, AFTER all five generators are done. So that's not even really a valid argument, is it? Mori's have absolutely nothing to do with MoM. And by "all the ridiculous add ons" do you mean the TWO add ons that exist to give killers an instadown? One of which requires a pretty hard skill shot (Redhead's Pinky Finger) and the other reduces the number of times you can use your power before reloading by 80%(Iridescent Heads)? If so, those aren't that ridiculous. Your reasoning is pretty bad for why MoM isn't OP, since you did absolutely nothing to defend the perk, you just tried to come up with things that aren't very well balanced on the killer side. That's like saying Trump is a good president because Hillary wasn't a good choice.
---
I think this could work fairly well. Whenever I'm playing killer I never fight over the hatch. It's just not worth the headache for me lol
---
Hate playing against leigon but will forever love the mori. Best mori imo
---
I remember when the game came out and the wait times were bugged so there were a million guides on steam that were literally just cooking recipes for things like cake and lasagna
---
Sorry sorry I'm half tired and baking at 2 am &gt;-&gt;
---
I understand that, it really sucks when survivors are dicks when killers are trying to have a good time, especially since killers seem to be the most chill.  I was just saying that if the Killer wants to be a dick I can be one too, but I only see a few killers like that.
---
play nurse. She earns the most and if you get good at her you wont need to level up any other killer anyways
---
Me too. I think it would be great for the devs to do something like this. They want to add more objectives and activities I matches, they don't need to add new items or anything yet. They can focus on what exists and make them more challenging and interesting, like the hatch or totems. They have so many opportunities to do some cool stuff
---
Lmao what you said doesn’t make her a hypocrite, please google the definition of the word. What you described, even if it were true, would just make her a liar. I’ll help you out with an example. A hypocrite would be someone stands on a pedestal and takes a side that’s against something, but later on ends up doing it themselves (sound at all familiar?) Kitty saying she deranks for so and so reason, and you find that reason being false....doesn’t make someone a hypocrite. Do you understand the word now?
---
Huzzah! A man of Quality!
---
He was healing
---
Agreed, Just all kinds of BM in general should just be frowned upon, like why cant we play the game and use what we know to better each other, and not have this toxic players thinking its cool to tbag, or constantly hit you on hook.   
---
Its just childish as fuck.
---
🤦🏻‍♀️ omg im not going to waste my night arguing with someone who can’t comprehend something so damn simple. if you want to believe she’s not a hypocrite go ahead. fuckin dumb. 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
---
Like if you’re with friends and you’re goofing around, that’s understandable (like the kill your friends)
---
Yeah. You get used to it . It's ass still but hopefully it gets fixed
---
I had this a couple of days ago and it was so annoying. You can only run straight to get away from the killer. For the whole match I ended up doing just gens and got a few saves. When it go to the end the killer got me and I died :(
---
I’m leveling up other killers to unlock the perks to get them on my mains
---
Not a lie though theres a bunch of toxic people in dbd
---
how did you get 32k if you let someone go?
---
if it’s so shitty then why do you play? so you can complain?
---
Had this Nea with us that did nothing the whole game besides urban evade, doesn't do gens, doesn't rescue hooks, we got all the gens running with 1 dead and 2(including me) on hook, I opened the exit before I got hooked btw so no thanks to Nea, and while we were hooked and Nea is the only one healthy I saw she wasn't coming back for us at all, just stood at the gate. I just let myself die and spectated, killer went to gate to look for her, she just teabagged for like 20 seconds then went out. Killer said gg, Nea said LOL GET GOOD EASY GAME. For fucks sake man, if you looped the killer for 5 gens, or did some of the gens, or rescued us and made it out, sure, but you did absolutely nothing the whole game besides wait for everyone else to do the work, teabag at exit and leave us to die. The least you could do is say gg or thank us for doing all the work lol
---
Toxic survivor scum smh 
---
/s
---
To sum up this response "play the killer we want you to play instead of the ones you paid for" - Noed and rancor only counter mettle if the survivor isnt injured. Thing is wraith mains, freddies (yes they exist), legions (yup them too), huntresses (huntressees? huntressi?) dont want to have to be told "welp you gotta play hillbilly" - even nurses are kinda hosed here
---
This happened to me too. At first I thought it was just a visual glitch but it actually messed with my movement too. I could still walk just not run.
---
Just about the same happened to me it’s a slap in the face
---
I meant as if I left him on the ground and chased someone else. I felt bad because it wasn’t fair on his end since the lag made him teleport into a wall. I eventually got him again.
---
I got yelled at earlier for letting someone die on their second hook upstairs
---
I couldn't find the stairs :(
---
Wasting time until WWZ comes out. Also, so I can talk shit to people like yourself
---
how is it talking shit? would you like to elaborate?
---
F
---
I prefer the Vanilla skins
---
so you slugged? many survivors see that as a bad thing.
---
As someone who also plays alot of SWF, and Someone who plays killers.   
---
Im not too bugged about it, some people dont wanna go against SWF due to how immensely difficult it becomes to play the game, especially if your just trying to relax and play a round of killer.   
---
I mean I understand that it sucks, but literally today I had four randoms risk them all dying for me, just because I was being tunneled by a legion and lasted long enough to give them time to complete 4 generators. So solo-queue is always ridiculously bad.
---
What is this? An image for ants?
---
LMAO ive been in that situation ALSO GIDEON MEAT PLANT AND LERY’S ARE AWFUL FOR FINDING MY WAY AROUND
---
Not invested enough to continue. Would have been better if you would stoop down to my level instead of the questions
---
SWF as a game mode is absolutely in the confines of the game. It's an option selected from the main menu.
---
By exploits I'm referring directly to using known bugs or third party hacks to gain an advantage.
---
Third party comms don't fall into that category imho.
---
Man it’s really awful. I thought something was wrong on my end but I can maintain connections with other games fine. Might  see about getting a refund on this tbh since I’ve only played a few hours
---
I mean he got healed up pretty quick and I was across the map chasing the Nea who was pretty good. I guess it’s seen as bad thing. Even if I got the Nea, I wouldn’t have gone back to the downed person.
---
💀
---
Ds is useless now with a killer with enduring, they hit ds then they get hit instantly as they are off the shoulder.
---
It's 4k boi idk what you mean
---
GREOOOOOVVYYY
---
It started happening when Legion came out in December.
---
How can mettle of man work against freddy then? Lol bad concept
---
I mean, I kinda just fuck around in legion games, cuz there is no in-chase counterplay.
---
I honestly don't get why they even have a PTB when they make risky matchmaking affecting changes without real testing.
---
I was used to be a pig in an other life, but i was killed by a gun, so in memory of it i am called the bloody pig, but now ima hen dud
---
Yeah they're usually pretty difficult to find so I've found it easier to just do gens and hope for the best lol
---
Is it wrong that I play killer with the mentality “if they don’t care about my fun, I won’t care about theirs”? I don’t camp or focus fire (unless someone is unhooked right in front of me) but if I can secure a kill, you better not hold out hope for any “kindness” from me. I’ve seen how rotten many survivors are...
---
Freddy needed a buff \( • 3 • )/
---
Lol y
---
Its not the best map but its great when you use the perks im using. My favorite thing to do is prove people wrong about how builds dont work on certain maps.
---
What Platform? PC always finds a match for me within 30 seconds in SWF. Consoles take much longer for me, but I never play console anymore. It seems like there is a sever lack of killers on console so that doesn't help.
---
Awh, seeing new players being confused about the game just always makes me giggle.  
---
Just be very mindful of your surroundings, identify windows or pallets near you, Listen out for the pig's breathing, and stay on the generator side that lets you see the most around u, also if she comes out of crouching theres an unsheathing sound she makes. Just be perceptive of whats around you, then when shes chasing you just do what you do normally
---
Nurses attack is M1 and a nurse would never hit you outside of after blinking. IMO it should give the token for all M1 attacks regardless and it should proc its use for all attacks (m1 or special ability)
---
I don't understand. MoM shouldn't be waking anyone up.
---
oh they surely do. i got called a tunneler when on Rotten Fields faced 3 identical Neas. i never even chased an injured person unless i just injured them but yeah imma tunneler cause apparently it's my job to tell difference in the corn between identical characters and memorize the name of who i already followed and literally lose all the time i have in game giving up the chase cause i hit a guy who got off the hook a minute ago and got fully healed.
---
I've never gotten a q longer than 5 minutes
---
UH WHAT
---
Yup, exactly. MoM is effectively garbage rn
---
Same same same
---
either way nurse is perfect for bp. I yield 30k steady every game
---
Any word on fix? If it’s as bad for me as everyone else I can’t imagine people aren’t complaining
---
Lowkey, I dont mind survivor DCs cuz its a free win for me. But it is an issue and should be addressed when dedicated servers come out, and when I get a DC i generally give hatch cuz its super killer favored when a survivor dcs
---
Not saying it doesn't work, it just isn't the best for it.
---
Glorious
---
Jake did nothing wrong.
---
Honestly IMO if you quite because of hexes you're a little punk. Not you specifically, just anyone who does that. Ruin you can work through or usually find relatively easily most of the time. Occasionally it is a huge PITA.
---
You don't even know whether NOED is active til the end of the game. If you D/C there you really have zero faith in your teammates. 
---
The first two are legit and annoying AF. Teams can work around campers by just popping gens. Tunneling is just low skill bullcrap. 
---
For me all that stuff is annoying as hell - even seems somewhat broken (hitboxes) but not reason for D/C.
---
Yep, completely agree. This guy is a hypocrite. Complains about an add on and two perks and then when you mention some survivor meta perks he acts like it's nothing similar lol
---
lmao you're going to trigger the fuck out this shit hole I love it
---
Think what. You are basically saying that if I run adrenaline and mettle of man then I deserve to be camped???
---
r/subsithoughtifellfor
---
weird flex but ok
---
So explain the problem you have with the perks...
---
I can’t get the Adept trophy for Hillbilly bc survivors keep DCing :(
---
Lol, that is just like a group of four flashlight swf. So if I don't have fun, I have the right to be toxic. Nice.
---
I love the horror bishoujo series of figs. I think the Michael Myers one comes out this month, too.
---
Maybe because its not similar at all?
---
First of all its not the perks alone I complain about, the perks on its own are no problem at all. The problem is the combination of these 2 perks with Legion and how they play with it.
---
There is NO counterplay against this.
---
Ok lets talk about Dead Hard, there is a counterplay for it, if you fall more than once for it, when you know the guy has Dead Hard, than its just your own fault.
---
Borrowed Time -  maybe just go for the guy who unhooked instead of tunneling anyways, there you have a counterplay.
---
Me last night. Long 12 hour shift, just wanted a few games before bed and the next shift, had 4 of the worst goddamn games.
---
"I hate this game" I uttered as I switched off.
---
I'll be on tonight.
---
It's happened to me too before
---
As a flip-flop + unbreakable user I agree, by all means, please slug me more!
---
Ooohhh, it’s a series? I’ll have to look’em up
---
wait why do you leave immediately
---
Can we get a Hag version of this?
---
I DC'd at Legion :B
---
You stay the fuck away from my totem
---
You really dont get it...
---
Its about the fact that there is no counterplay!
---
You can play around flashlights, you cant play around this perk combo against a Legion!
---
Is that so hard to understand?
---
Yeah. Going for the guy who is unhooked right in front of your face is tunneling. I have a feeling you are a survivor main.
---
I really don’t know honestly. All I know for sure is there’s no way a survivor is doing gens in a 1v1 with the killer patrolling. This was actually the very reason they didn’t go through with the PTB hatch closing a while back. It’s more than just a challenge, the survivor is in an unwinnable situation when the hatch is closed, it will just be another version of a waiting game only now the survivor is hiding instead of standing at the hatch with the killer.
---
League has worse toxicity. And if the killer was able to DM you, you have odd steam settings. 
---
If you want your friend to maybe like the game a bit, try kill your friends
---
I feel like that’d make things worse and you’d have people sending shit-talk messages/comments for turning down a rematch.
---
*Daddy juice*
---
Legion is a pain but he is pretty trash.
---
I can totally understand how people who watched it live became frustrated and were unfulfilled at the end.  All of the noise people made after the finale about how it was bad or whatever they felt actually made me want to check it out.  I ended up watching all 6 seasons over 2 1/2 weeks and it's my favorite TV series ever.
---
Going in with that line from one of the creators of the show who said after the finale that "it was about the people" really helps.  A lot of people who watched as it aired got sucked into the crazy theories about all the weird shit on the island and a decent amount of the weird shit on the island had kinda half-assed explanations so those people were understandably upset.
---
But if you go in and just focus on the characters and let all the other stuff kinda just be background noise it's such a powerful series.
---
I play PS4 that’s why he pm-ed me and I don’t know enough people to play for kill your friends but thanks
---
Yeah. They turned iconic horror legends into "pretty" girls. Pinhead, Freddy, Chucky, Jason, Ash, Michael, Edward Scissorhands, and Tiffany so far, i think.
---
They are still confusing tho.
---
Death is not an escape but I still want to die.
---
Happens
---
That actually sounds kind of creepy. Lmao.
---
LOL - howabout Don't release a character before it looks good.
---
r/itswoooooshwith4os
---
Nice job OP
---
you sound like one
---
Gotcha, at first I used 3 but that definitely wasn't right lol.
---
I'm The same but i'm a killer. I complain And shout at My screen, but i never write complains
---
This is why I’m a killer, and have no mercy, and play with my food.
---
No matter how you play, survivors are salty.
---
Yes but its done poorly. The Pig is much better example of slowing the game down
---
STOP FUCKING DC-ING AFTER BEING FOUND FIRST
---
It's really up to you, personally, i think they're cute and the idea of these non canon figs is fun.
---
When they’ve got thrill and you just keep tapping it and hiding to waste their time.
---
Oh this one looks awesome. I’m mainly talkin shit about anime figures.
---
....all you did was Flashlight save somebody. And you wanted that clipped why?
---
Yeah true, altough I was going more for the sorrowful/nostalgic memories from a happy past long gone it is true that she weaing the mask of such a similar animal would be weird, perhaps another Christmas related animal, or maybe Anna would be that crazy to actually wear it despite or even because of that, or she is such an expert hunter that for her reindeers and elks are completely different looking animals so it brings no memories of that.
---
Finding the Ruin totem on your way to the Generator, that Killer clearly has fallen out of favour with the entity.
---
They used to be more confusing not long ago. Completely flipped in direction.
---
*Gets stuck in a tree*
---
I see more posts complaining about people complaining about NOED
---
Adept is stupid now anyway since it's no longer just "get a 4k" it's literally "do everything 100% perfect"
---
Wraith is awesome. What do you mean?
---
Pretty dickish my dude using those addons
---
Some people are just salty and need to get over themselves
---
NOLB bad,botany knowledge good.
---
If you encounter these Hex Hunting SFWs really often, I would recommend using *Haunted Ground* or *Thrill of the Hunt* instead of *The Third Seal* to provide a some sort of punishment for Hex Hunting survivors.
---
Also, I know sometimes it's inevitable to run past your totems, but generally try to keep ***some*** distance to them while in a chase even though there is a risk of losing them.
---
Unless you're playing as the Hag, Billy, Spirit (or pretty much any other killer that can travel a considerably vast amount of distance in a short time), your totems are pretty much bound to get cleansed before the last gen pops if you're not running *Thrill of the Hunt*.
---
*Haunted Ground* gives you an opportunity to take vengeance for your totems. Not to mention how it spawns 2 trapped totems so the chance of cleansing an actual Hex Perk will drop drastically and can buy your totems more time.
---
The beads weren't for the key, they for a... more... personal use...
---
This game is so healthy rn
---
Oh i thought this was what hex:ruin did.
---
Yup. Those achievements are fucked now.
---
Idk what the chances are but every time I find a totem its always ruin or devour, but every time my tm8s find one its haunted grounds.
---
We did it once in kyf, took us about 20 minutes to do it, imagine getting chased by a hillbilly and a very fast wraith that blocks every pallet/window
---
Are we just going to ignore iridescent button and franks mixtape legion? Like let’s be honest here you’re not getting two “tremendously increased” evil within addons in the game. That’s really hard to do
---
&gt;Michael is toxic enough
---
How many hours do you have to think like this? Like have you never played against iridescent head Huntress or five blink nurse?
---
My ping jumps from green to red no matter what, gotta roll with the punches.
---
I'm just leaving this here so I can get immortalized once it's archived.
---
I await an edit that says: “I saw Legion for half a millisecond”
---
Think I'd just leave you be and start hunting the other survivors. Could probably eat twenty pallets and come back before you finish.
---
Well one dodging the huntress hatchets is ez and for the nurse no one plays nurse it's really rare for me to find a game for some one who plays nurse so i don't really worry about that
---
Um. Do you know what franks mixtape does? It just makes it so he has to hit twice instead of 3 or 4 times.
---
Don't play Legion, easy fix. 
---
His mechanic is boring to play against and the worst part is, that doesn't even make him strong.
---
Legion matches are dragged out because of how many times you must mend and very boring because you can't outplay him in a chase.
---
Survivors bitch about how the killer is running NOED, Ruin and is "tunneling" and "camping" gens and hooks.
---
The Killer is bitching how the survivors are toxic for using flashlights, bodyblocking, gen rushing and using perks like Dead Hard etc.
---
Both sides are *sinning* and bitching about it just as much as the other one is.
---
Extra Bloodpoints after the match for only killing Jake, Tapp, Feng Min, Claudette and Adam Francis... And letting the white survivors go
---
XD
---
&gt;dodging the Huntress hatchets is ez
---
You clearly haven’t faced a good Huntress.
---
&gt;no one plays nurse
---
You clearly don’t play red/purple ranks.
---
So... how many hours you got?
---
Alright you brainlet I was talking from the killer POV that I'd rather NOT have survivors DC, I know you get emblem points but those are worthless because nobody has issues ranking up
---
+625 in brutality is nothing, a single hook would be +700 in sacrifice just for the hooking action completely ignoring the other score events you'd get from smacking them around otherwise and I always use BBQ so I'm irked when survivors DC and it screws the rest of their team which leads an easy game for ME which I don't want
---
I know, and it’s stupid. It’s the epitome of tunneling. It just makes the game extremely unfun. Along with no counterplay to him.
---
Incoming call from prayer beads spirit .
---
Nah
---
I've done everything you wanted me to do, so WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME?  
---
Entity:   ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Hand and a hole would protect the key from being lost in a Trial, but the Weaved ring would do that too (In case it was used). Causes redundancy.
---
Yellow ring adds 15 seconds to the time hatch is open
---
This has me cracking up and it just gets better every time I watch it.
---
Tapp: Objection ! It's called a receding hairline
---
lmao, the same PainReliever that disconnects on every single game they get hooked?
---
Changed it for ya :3
---
Myers: WADDUP HOMEBOY !
---
Meh I’d rather it just be shards than ranked exclusives
---
I wanna spank Frank too...
---
I play on ps4 so I don't think I can check my hours but I've been playing for like a year now 
---
And also doesn't matter if I was in red or purple ranks cause most people play Michael which is fine but it's annoying most of the time cause most Michael players just do the same bs that use tombstone,I don't see how that's fun at all especially with infinite tier 3 not sure why they thought it was a good idea cause just makes it easier for them to camp survivors Michael is basically the reason why I took a break from survivors and played killer instead and yes I have tried him before with one of the offerings he's too easy no skill required like the nurse or any other killer.
---
Legion is 4 characters (represented by skins), 2 are male and 2 are female. I'd say you probably have seen more of the male ones
---
Small game helps a lot but on the Autohaven maps seems they all got slammed between the two tires at all the jungle gyms. I mean I guess they are more hidden than most places but yikes.
---
With all the false reporting, toxicity, an general BMing in general the killers are moving on to other games on consoles 
---
I used to be in a "killer main" group that had almost 160 active players 6-8 months ago. Now only me an like 2 others ever even get on anymore.
---
Surprise people, you need killers to play the game.
---
I find myself playing less an less lately as well.
---
We need a game changer, something to realistically shake up the meta an get people back into the game(for console at least I know y'all PC Bois an gals have no issues).
---
Rank 10 vs Rank 12 killer, obviously a bad one at that. Way to perpetuate the toxicity by BMing and being a generally rude streamer. I'm sure you'll go far...🙄
---
Survivors think that im just protecting my pride, But they will see that me doing a daily meant everyone got points, not just me, and that they basically let me farm them for easy blood points
---
You play on console, where it is hard to play a killer like nurse at those FPS rates.
---
Ranks do matter. To hold your rank at red (on PC), you have to play a top tier killer such as nurse, billy, or spirit. It’s not hard to counter a Michael. Loop him around until his tier 3 runs out then you can safely transition to a T-Wall. His ruin will be gone by then. You biggest mistake is being on either unsafe pallets, middle of the open, or lack of awareness. Sure, infinite tier 3 is absurd, but it’s ultra rare for a reason. And the fact you’re talking about camping, just reassured me you aren’t high on ranks.
---
I play freddy with overcharge equipped. And I get 4K’s nearly every match. Red/Purple ranks too.
---
I'm out of the loop, how are they bugged?
---
New huntress add-on:  Polished chrome hatchets  designed to blind survivors.
---
Why use Sabo when you can be a man and use Breakdown + Deliverance to destroy the hook just by Flexing your many manly man muscles?!
---
You know, that may be it. Two generators on that map had the same outcome. I managed to get out, but I had to let a teammate die because I couldn’t find them :(
---
* looks at my long list of toxic messages *
---
Eh, I don't think that makes much of a difference.
---
Actually yeah can you imagine? Getting healed by a friendo and suddenly... DEATH INSTEAD! Lol. I don’t play killer much but that does sound hilarious xD
---
Honestly same here.
---
I guess lucky. I'm not bad at the game but I'm not a pro. More casual.
---
Bricky if your feeling fancy.
---
against doctor mains? now that’s just discrimination babe
---
I wish I had space for this game on my ps4 rip. I have too many anime/waifu games on my ps4. I really need a ps4 pro.
---
You should have put the rulers somewhere. Combined with the no attack cooldown cheese they allow for much faster downs.
---
When i play survivor: everyone chilling in the corner of the map
---
When i play killer:
---
Still can’t fix Legion, Jesus fucking Christ, just disable him if you don’t know wtf to do with his broken add ons
---
So you want to go in as a perkless Dwight, in your first match, and get smashed by a full-meta 700-hour Hillbilly?
---
Or try out Freddy and get bullied by a hardcore-SWF group?
---
Pipping is meant to stop that, which is why they tried to make it harder to reach top ranks.
---
People leave the toxic stuff to the Plauge.  She spews that shit everywhere.
---
Dick move of the Huntress to still try to hit you even though Dwight was trolling. Also holy shit Rank 20 Huntress. Also seeing the other auras with Bond makes me cry.
---
I main her and I have all the hair and never noticed it until about an hour ago my friend pointed it out!
---
If you replaced the first Z in your name with a T it would suit the post better.
---
I hate people who are teabagging the killer. I think that Claudette deserves a camping leatherface with insidious
---
Just slug em 4head
---
WHERE ARE RANK REWARDS?!
---
A hidden hatch would make games last forever. I hope you enjoy players urban evading for 30 mins looking for a now hidden hatch
---
Just fuck off mate.
---
The system is pretty shitty now.
---
Playing as survivor is difficult now either you get a high ping lobby and have to search again and again or  in a match most people DC since 1 guy didnt get in.
---
I mean if you just avoid tunneling for 60 seconds ds is fine. If you aren't camping and they happen to just yank in front of you hook the healthy one.
---
idk I could be wrong heh
---
literally my strategy. i use brown bag and brown set up add-on. Brutal Strength, BBQ, Pop Goes the Weasel, Enduring. two gens pop and i usually have my traps set in most important places cause i ignore people i meet, just shoo them off the gens pretty much. and this is when the game begins. gen progression stops, people constantly heal after getting trapped, chaos, panic, fun.
---
90 is the cheap side lol. It's safe to say I don't collect figures.
---
StBFL can be good situationally, but it's far too inconsistent to be top tier. Punishing hitting the obsession often means the person you have to hit the MOST times before they'll go down, and actively trying to avoid one person to stack the perk usually wastes about as much time as it earns. Only really great when you just happen to luck out and not chase the obsession much.
---
Overcharge is again, situational. You go against survivors that have any clue what they're doing and it'll be a wasted perk slot.
---
Thana being high tier is a joke, 90% of matches it may as well be "colours the progress bar red without changing speed." Half this list feels like they've read how the perks work and never actually tried them.
---
Corrupt Intervention, again, sounds great on paper, but almost never causes 3 gens near each other to be blocked (which would benefit you as killer) and it usually just means "genrushing" can only complete 4/5 gens in the first 2 mins. It doesn't actually slow their progress during the first chase.
---
Huntress Lullaby is shit 99/100 games, gets broken before it does literally ANYTHING.
---
PWYF is only ever used on Tombstone Myers because it is literal trash in a real match.
---
Dark Devotion is awful, it will almost always go off on your first hit of a chase and be ended by the second, unless you want to abandon a chase for the sake of trying to find someone else, and even then they probably still know you're there cos the obsession will be right near you anyway. Also SWF obliterates the perk.
---
Tinkerer should probably go up to mid tier as it allows for some very strong plays, it's not as garbage as the perks in the low tier.
---
What do I look like a maid? I can't be burdened by doing secondary objectives.
---
That's what I'm doing ma boy, although I'm getting tunneled like hell
---
You should try that perk that stops gens from being able to get worked on for 80 seconds.
---
LoL that's my Bill
---
Giving that almost every Episode starts with a closeup of someone face and then zooming out, it isn't that much of a spoiler. :)
---
But I get why someone see it as a spoiler. Sorry for that. I'll mark the comment as a Spoiler.
---
I think all games are somewhat toxic on multiplayer. We just have to deal with it but damn why should we
---
The thing is, this was not KYF, this was a SWF invading a random killer's match as a killer. With other words, the trapper did not know there were 2 killers
---
&gt;I'm trash at anything that isn't Nurse
---
me_irl
---
there are arrows on the walls and stuff, but yeah, hate that place.
---
I see a ballsack in this picture
---
Are you sure? He absolutely doesn’t seem like a person to do that
---
Based on how I read it, the hatch would only be hidden so long as it's closed, and if specifically hidden by the killer. The survivor can unhide it for other survivors to find or stumble upon before it opens.
---
Thank you!
---
And that is why people get killed.
---
How do you like bloodhound on legion? Do you feel it needs sloppy to work? I was thinking about trying it out myself, but haven’t gotten it on my web yet.
---
yes message me ☺️
---
Stop trying to compare NOED to Adrenaline.  It's absurd.  I'm sick of pointing this out but Adrenaline is earned by survivors by completing their objectives.  NOED is "earned" by killers by failing to protect their objectives.  Adrenalines haste effect last 5 seconds then it's gone.  NOED's haste effect is permanent as long as the totem exists.  Adrenaline heals one health state the moment it procs for just that survivor whether they're hurt or not.  NOED removes two health states from ALL survivors as long as the totem exists.  In every measurable way NOED comes out the unbalanced winner.  Babykillers seriously need to stop beating that misinformed dead horse.  It's a shit comparison.  Compare it to old Decisive Strike if anything.  Survivors rewarded with a free escape for playing poorly and getting outplayed by the killer.
---
"Disconnect 3 times against Legion as Meg Thomas"
---
In my two years of playing this game on my ps4 i have never gotten hate as a survivor. But I've had countless messages telling me im trash and to game end myself, as the killer.
---
If surviors don't respect killers then killers wont respect surviors. And that's whats happening lately
---
Trapper's early game would improve so much if they would just let the brown bag addon be built in so he could carry 2 from the start. I also wish that we could reset traps without having to pick them up. Whenever I go up against a SWF group it always feels like one of them dedicates their time to following me around and disabling my traps.
---
I know. I'm joking.
---
Pretty annoying that everyone complains about "this perk is toxic" or "that add-on is toxic". Play whatever you like dude and if someone complains (90% chances) so be it. NOED is toxic, Mettle of man is toxic, heads on is toxic, hell even being on the map is toxic! Bming like Jake did encourages killers to play with stronger (or how many like to call it "toxic") perk combos because of frustration. Survivors will tea-bag at the exit gates because of it and it's a never ending circle.
---
How about all of us play without any items perks and add-ons? Ah no wait.. that'd be toxic too I guess
---
Thats just dumb.
---
To ensure victory
---
They will abduct you and turn you into another Nea
---
Adrenaline rewards the survivors for completing their main objective. NOED rewards the killer for failing their main objective. 
---
Its a dumb perk that rewards bad killers. If you need to run it fine but it absolutely is a shitty  no skill perk. Those other perks do not compare in the slightest and have counter play besides a huge timewaste that also helps the killer
---
DS is fine now and I didn't see that many people running it, nor using it. If you complain about it NOW, how did you see it BEFORE? Because then it was way more annoying.
---
I was like wtf why he used longer aura riding with waved ring and then i saw white word xD
---
*ward
---
Survivors that complain in these circumstances are beyond funny to me, if you arent camped and tunneled get over yourself lol.
---
There is nothing wrong with those perks as long as you don't do what he assumed you did which is intentionally cheese the chase mechanic to avoid being in a chase while you follow blood and wait for them to drop.  It was unfair of dude to assume you exploit Legion chases just because you run sloppy and Bloodhound.  At least I hope you don't do this lol.  I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt.  I can't remember the last time a Legion attempted to cheese me.  They've been playing it pretty straight against me lately.
---
I play survivor most of the time and if killer has NOED then he has NOED, that's it. It's not the end of the world. There's no reason to start attacking the killer for using it. Just move on to the next game.
---
I always cringe watching some rando immersed claudette who did nothing teabagging, bitch you did jack shit all game. Bonus points if they are leaving a teamate to die just to do it too.
---
You dribbled before. That is all.
---
I mean ebony mori its to be expected. Ill usually just let them kill me but some people cant be bothered waiting out a free killer win
---
Queues are also longer because dbd in the last 30 days or so has been only had 16.3k average players per day EVEN WITH a free weekend AND two DLCs . This is the lowest numbers it's had since May 2018 which is a big hit because after the summer BBQ even dbd had a huge and rather consistent boost in avg players only to now to basically that boost have never happened. Now to be fair to behaviour they have always seemed to get their lowest avg player number in March April and May but a lot of people seem to be leaving because of how broken the game is and not so much just life stuff.
---
Yeah, Ruin is the worst.
---
This bug is definitely a thing.  It happened against my teabagging, flashlight spamming Remember Me obsession 2 weeks ago lol.  He became invincible against me and he was not humble about it lol.  I was really loving playing Freddy again the past month but until they patch this shit out of the game, just take a hard pass on playing Freddy for the time being.
---
I mean alert is good ;)
---
Dropped it 'cause I can't justify the slot. I'd rather run Deerstalker.
---
Someone will buy this and jerk off on it
---
I've seen the videos of other figures being disrespected
---
Pls no
---
Yeh the 3vs1 are getting annoying but not only that... sometimes even finding surv. as killer can already be torture.  
---
Rank 6 EU and couldnt find Surv. in about 10 minutes... like WTF... they really have to do something about their matchmaking or otherwise I see the game dying really fucking fast.
---
Ridiculously easy, yes.
---
A lot of people cry about it. I for a turn like to not pip on accident now. It‘s a good change actually.
---
If I chose to not pip but still get 25k points, I can do that now.
---
I uninstalled this game twice and then reinstalled it in the next week, fck me
---
I mean you should always be doing this at the start of the game until you know which killer you're up against but, consistently rotate your camera often while repairing so you can see T1 Myers, Wraiths invisible approaching outline, or in this case the Pig crawling towards you.  Unless your on a gen blocked by a wall or something you'll see her creeping and have time to nope the fuck out of there before she can lunge attack you.  Her lunge has an audio cue as well, start running the moment you hear the blade charge up.  Speaking of audio cues you can hear her breathing too if she was say on the other side of your wall.  If you are trapped and unhooked and your trap isn't activated yet always take the full heal first.  Your timer hasn't started so there's no reason to hit up the  boxes while injured.  Lastly I don't think this should need to be said at this point but I actually came across a teamate the other weak that didn't know this.  You can escape through the hatch with the trap on, don't bother taking it off in that scenario.
---
[Ohhhh here we go again...](https://media.giphy.com/media/gl0mkIZOW6Nwc/giphy.gif)
---
First, I just wanna say I'm glad there's actual discussion going on here instead of someone running their mouth for no reason. 
---
You talk a lot about small game so let's get this out of the way first.
---
 It's really not that useful or a worthwhile perk to have for the same reason wasting time doing totems is. Not everyone that plays killer uses NOED. It's a waste of a slot to invest small game into just for the chance the current killer in a match is even using it. It's off "meta" I get it. It isn't needed though because realistically, as I've said before, unless that's your primary goal in the entire match to focus on before doing anything else, you're not much of an asset to your team. You're as useful as everyone running around looking for Ruin. You're not aiding in the progression of the match nor are you helping anyone. If you do them as you go along from gen to gen, you yourself might not have even gotten all of the totems. Which still leaves NOED allowed to activate. Not everyone uses small game. I've used it a few times as  level up a new character after prestiging because it for some reason decides to usually be one of the first few perks I'm forced to buy in my blood web.
---
In text, paper, carved in stone, wherever, the idea of "just use this perk then spend the whole match looking for totems and NOED can't ever activate" sounds nice but it isn't practical in real time use. Everything in this game is dictated by the actions of others and how much you put forth to the match to make up for the slack your team is providing. I can't tell you how frequently my score is higher than the rest of the team and even the killer because I participate in all areas of the scoring system. I don't spend my time urban evading around being scared of the grass twitching a different direction. Spending the majority of the game doing totems usually ends up getting the team fucked over. 
---
As for you mention of borrowed time, I don't find that to be mandatory either. Not unless I'm getting match after match after match after match of nothing but hook campers and face camping leather faces or in general any face camper. There isn't many that do it with bubba on ps4 surprisingly. I think I see maybe 2 per week out of 100 matches. Currently I'm running a pretty off meta build. I've been using ace in the hole (for those sweet sweet flashlights. mmmmm.) empathy, self care and streetwise (to make those flashlights last just "a little bit longer") on my Claudette and my Kate has pretty much the same build but except for empathy I use bond and instead of self care I have borrowed time so I can farm and keep going to piss the killer off and I get through the match just fine. I can manage to loop the killer the greater majority of the game and not use a single exhaustion perk to do it. My playstyle is a bit on the aggressive side. I **want** to get under the killers thin skin so everyone else can get the objective done.
---
&gt; The arguement of "The totem count can get fucked up in SWF" also makes little sense and sounds more like a problem of poor communication over anything else.  
---
This is both true. I know there have been plenty of times I'll be doing a dull totem and along comes the killer just to get me off of it. Like out of his way, is blatantly obvious he has NOED type of come after you. Be in the middle of a chase and stop you from doing a dull totem... If I lose him and I remember where it's at I'll go back for it. There have been more than plenty of times where I get tunneled the entire match after that and welp, guess what? NOED facecamp time because I don't remember where it's at, as far as I know 5 minutes ago I did it because I remember starting to work on it. I know my memory is bad. But it happens enough to my friends who don't have memory problems that it is a problem and can be one. We're all human here. Everyone makes mistakes and forgets things. 
---
&gt; The difference between pre nerf DS and NOED is you can actually avoid NOED and getting hit by it is the fault of the survivors as a team, meanwhile DS had no way of avoiding it outside of dribbling 
---
After the patch that made hooks closer together and pick up times faster, anyone that wasn't the obsession couldn't ever get DS to be used to begin with. You were never more than a few feet away from a hook when a survivor went down. Nothing has changed. Look how close hooks are to someone who goes down. The most I've ever had to drop someone and pick them back up again before they were on a hook was once. The current distance between hooks is absurdly low and can be made even lower with an offering. The only way today that you would have to dribble someone, who ***is*** the obsession, more than once is the new update to the oak offerings survivors have to extend the range. Which by the way. Wasn't really a thing until very recently. 
---
If you knowingly went after the obsession the whole match to bait DS out and you couldn't out play that person, you punish yourself for tunneling them. The new DS is useless now even for those that do tunnel off the hook. The shitty people that do that to begin with are the same shitty people that will still tunnel them. There's nothing you can do about it. 
---
I play both sides as well. Albeit I've been playing more survivor the past couple of months because playing killer has become so mind numbingly boring. I still play killer. I can tell you right now I've never once needed to use NOED. When I first started playing the game I started out as a killer. Doctor to be more specific. I either won or I lost. It was as simple as that and it still is. Now, as a meme type of thing I removed all my perks on my pig and equipped only NOED for the memes and killed the entire team before 1 gen was done. For some reason I was still called a "NOED needing crutch noob".... says the swf team that still had to finish 5 gens and were all dead by the time just 1 gen was around 25% or so..... You're never going to get better if you use NOED to begin with. I got good because I like winning. Not because a perk in the game is so brokenly OP made it happen.
---
Remove the speed buff, keep the exposed status. Quick and simple solution to the problem with NOED especially since now tier 1 NOED has all the same benefits as a tier 3 version of it. what is it? 2/3/4% hate status for a 115% killer? Throw in PWYF and how tf are you gonna outrun or out loop a killer with it?! You can't. It's the same as trying to outrun a cloaked wraith. The only difference is that 115% killers don't need to slow down to uncloak to hit you with it. It's busted.
---
About 90% of my games lately as killer have been farming games with 2-3 survivors because when I get first guy down he dc's and sometimes someone dc's right after that... I lose all interest to play seriously at that point.
---
Poor choice of wording but I believe he meant he let them go in that specific chase.
---
I think it could work out fine, if it were along the lines of... You start the game with no traps, and have to go to a locker to take one out, maxing at (however many traps she has idk really). Would possibly make plays with tenacity and unbreakable a little more relevant.
---
Ormund is a piece of shit map full of bugs. My least favorite map by far and the swamp literally spawns like 3 total pallets.
---
HOW I CAN WIN THE PLAGUE WHEN I PLAY ALONE?
---
Look at the ceiling of the room - if there are blinking lights hanging, then there is a generator in that quadrant that can be powered up. 
---
Normally I just sprint around looking at the ceiling to see if the room I just entered has a generator in it.
---
Ohhhh just you wait until you try out killer meme builds and one of them happens to include NOED...  
---
Just speaking NOED out loud... I can already hear the screams &amp; tears droping... :')
---
But he gets downed and killed because they only fear nea when she asserts her dominance.
---
I think you're lost.
---
Imagine a time where it was bad etiquette to **NOT** tbag someone. Where talking shit was the norm. Where people didn't let momma jokes get so far under their skin they take the time to DOX you for it. ah, the good old days when people didn't have dads that wore dresses and women that wore pants. (figuratively speaking) The days in which the word police was a meme instead of an actual thing.
---
Ah, liberalism. It truly is a disease.
---
I love the game and think it can still have a lot of longevity, but man is it a bummer to be unable to even play it.  That's a pretty quick way to lose a playerbase.

joking or whoosh?

I'm on a role-playing server whenever I play killer 👿
---
I had a doctor/hillbilly game today...absolute chaos lol
---
Way to light my shitpost on fire. I'm outta here prior to the inferno.
---
That's the only reason I hate the closed maps! Especially the game since it has 2 floors...
---
People honestly getting really pissed off in this thread lol
---
I think so
---
And you dont tunnel like a moron now. That is all.
---
Almost the entirety of your list is entitled bullshit.  A lot of the nerfs were needed as several of those mechanics were severely unhealthy.
---
That being said you have a singular legit complaint and that's the hits through windows and pallets.  Those have been pretty atrocious as of late.  The windows moreseo than the pallets.
---
Most are intentional when the cunts run to you and dc instantly when they get downed
---
I hope they fix it on the survivor side.  But this should be a low priority fix (unless its super easy to fix)
---
Because controlling what people can and can't say all started with the democratic cry baby bitches. They go hand in hand with each other because they don't believe in free speech or speech they disagree with. It's why an executive order had to be made to allow it on US soil, on school campuses of all places the USA. Liberals are the direct cause of the social break down around the world. They're the only ones on the planet that believe people should be silenced because they didn't like something that was said.

Aaaaand Ghoul Troopers will be Fortnite’s equivalent of P3 Clauds 😂

Touché
---
i think we have different play style, and i do enjoy the feeling of giving the rest a good game
---
i guess that's why survivor never shit talk me after the game is over
---
its called a clean game and it gives me the good feels, that's all that matters to me when i play :)
---
Ahhh the good feels
---
This game is the Bobby to our Whitney, the Ike to our Tina, the Chris to our Rihanna....
---
But yet we never leave them leave.

i love that creeper

I barely understood kappa references when I played fighting games, and for the life of me I don’t understood what you mean by it in this context, either
---
New tool, the flare! sticks to the ground for 3 minutes blinding killers and survivors alike! can put on the 2 pink addons one to increase it's range to 80 meters, the other to make it blind to walls and floors.
---
Followed by too quiet surrounding and pull from totem
---
Indubitably, good sir.
---
This reminds me of the other day when i was playing killer, I downed a bill at the start of the match and he gets insta farm by a Kate so I tunnelled her till she dc and farmed with the rest
---
nope none of them work
---
looks like galeem was added as a new killer, huh....
---
It means to exit the locker and move around so that you at not counted as inactive
---
he does not seem like a toxic dude so I give him props for that, but he definitely hasnt been playing the game very long.
---
It also works on chainsaws if you are injured btw. 
---
Imagine being healed 99%, take the MoM hit, heal up, take another hit, insta-heal medkit, another hit, Dead Hard. 
---
By the time you are finally downed, MoM is up again.
---
You're the reason why they still haven't fixed their game. Idiots like you don't care and will just buy more shitty cosmetics.
---
im pretty sure mom is a one time use perk
---
im also pretty sure that getting hit resets the heal progress bar
---

Bruh. I spent my childhood and adolescence playing Brood War and Lord of Destruction.

Nobody was this sensitive back then.

Even better the way they’re right by the exit, then being dragged back
---
What is it?
---
I want bloody coil being baseline, having an easier way to get traps and not having to pick up traps to reset them. That would improve trapper so much.

Why would anyone work 12h shifts?
---
Clown itself is unsettling and I don't even have a fear of clowns.
---
MoM isn't even an issue unless you're playing M1 killers and even then it doesn't matter match. Considering every killer runs NOED you should have no issues getting kills.
---
I'm unclear on who the OP is in this conversation. I never blame killers on tunneling/camping. Tunneling is only logical, and camping, well, they do whatever the fuck they want. Honestly who the fuck even cares about ranking up? I'm happy when I lose rank so I get to play less against P3 teabagging purple flashlight claudettes with MoM  and Adrenalin.
---
Evil has a way of always finding you.
---
After getting hit 3 times by a Killer's basic attack, Mettle Of Man activates.
---
Once activated, the next occasion that would put you into the Dying State  from the Injured State  is ignored.
---
The next time you heal back to full health, your Aura will be revealed to the Killer when you are farther than 12/14/16 metres from the Killer.
---
Mettle Of Man will deactivate the next time you are put into the Dying State.
---
Increases your chances of being the Obsession.
---
The Killer can only be obsessed with one Survivor at a time.

---
i'm Freddy main for over a year, kind of used that they nerf him every single update. just this bug is the worst i've seen so far and was curious if it was only in my game
---
If you hit the survivor on the hook right after you hooked them it overwrites their long scream into a short hit scream.
---
Because its probably true....
---
That's actually a fair gripe. I kinda wish for the same thing, but I learned to alleviate this to extent by keeping count.
---
Thanks for the laughs \^\^
---
But SWF already has this information.  The game needs to try to balance SWF vs solo otherwise killers are going to be so OP vs solo survivors at some point.  Honestly as high rank killer, you almost always get a 4k against 4 random solo's right now.  I think a totem helps killers and solo survivors.  It helps killers because it's a pseudo secondary objective.  Yea your NOED might not make it to end game as much, but more times than not..the time survivors are cleansing totems is the real reward of NOED.  And even if you're not using NOED, just the threat of it keeps survivors cleansing  dull totems.  I never run NOED, but as a killer I loved the Tier 1 and 2 buff because the threat I might have it, slows the game for me.  As solo survivor I hate it, because my team never cleanses totems.
---
I would just put the aura reveal on permanently, and see how that works out. Had someone use it in early game and I was pretty sad when I realized I can no longer see him.
---
Oh that's pretty dope

Now I really want a Lethal Weapon DLC

Tbh, humanity always was this sensitive to mere words.

As a nurse most of my 9 hour shifts get dragged out to 11/12 hour shifts because of how busy it is. No way of getting around it either. Overtime pays like crazy though so i ain’t complaining.
---
Fuck man, thanks, thats a lot of mending to do
---
Do you get points for the length of mend though or only the fact that you mended and you get fixed amount of points? Because that would simply let you get survival points to max in the first way and you wouldnt need to escape
---
I believe the mend point is a set amount I am not 100% sure though.

---
Shhhh! They can’t handle when you ask them to do a simple task other than gens!  &gt;.&gt;
---
Bc it is dbd and the community has chosen to explain to each side how to not play :D
---
here we go again...
---
Absolutely destroyed my man
---
Honestly for killers this map is dope but pure pain for survivors

---
But then Thrill of the hunt pops cause it was a trap xD

I  think we can all agree here when we say "that fucker deserved what was coming to him"
---
Only the truly good killers can hit rank one now, I like it, personally for me as well, I was rank one killer every season, but no way should I of been there I’m nothing special, I feel it’s accurate now, I’m rank 3-4 killer these days.
---
I've got loads of those and the spooky medkits. If you're interested PM me?
---
Well, this dude had 3/4 ISIS terrorist in his appartment back in 2015 in france and on tv this motherfucker said «  i was just helping them, didn’t knew they were terrorists » and he’s going to prison for that
---
He’s been a meme since 2015 but recently this vid of him is popping for some reason
---
I don’t care about rank either honestly, I just want blood points to upgrade, rank one is a wasteland.
---
Well sometimes you gotta take a shot or just always be safe about it
---
I like you.
---
"truly good killers can hit rank one now" I disagree, It's more like "truly good killers with amazing luck to get survivors who'll play well the entire match only to fuck up in the last second, giving the killer 3 or 4 kills" now, the ranks have never been more dependent on the survivors, Im willing to say that it's more up to the survivors rn whether or not the killer ranks up
---
It’s not protection for all of us. “Hit three survivors with a nurse blink” is a daily I hate seeing but the worse ones are “kill by your own hand”  and “sacrifice “ . The first one because most the time I get it on a killer I don’t have a Mori for, and the other because the MASS NUMBERS OF DC’ers! 
---
I’ve had bad games before and they were not for dailies but you can’t win every time, if you did getting that four man wouldn’t be so satisfying lol
---
Salve amiki!!!
---
This game shouldn’t coddle people. Even at rank 20, you barely have any perks. Mind you- good perks. 
---
Even at a decent rank, with good perks, you still could get beat by a solid SWF. Or that 700 hour Hillbilly with mega curve. 
---
Pipping is what stops people from finding games. Not just that alone causes it, but there’s ways to filter people into lobbys. Maybe dedicated servers will fix that as well.
---
I've never DC when losing a hex totem tho when I play hex spirit with beads and thrill of the hunt and the first totem they get and I am not even close to is thrill of the hunt I wanna DC bc the game is basically over sense all my perks are hex perks
---
Eh I get quitter bonuses anyways and don’t give a shit about rank so DC all ya like it just makes it easier for me.
---
If the survivors spend the time to cleanse every totem, then the perk already did it's job. It's the killer who should go out of his way to get use out of his perk, it shouldn't be uo to the survivors to go out of their way to prevent the perk
---
I'm dead a french meme in a dbd meme whoever made that thanks 😂
---
Eeh I'm guessing you're new but moris aren't fun for survivors bc you skip 2 hooks to kill a person and well if they DC they admit that it is over they can't win it sucks that they do it but I see why that's why I just use greens and yellows for added "ooooh is it a refy one"
---
Depends on what part of the animation or even before they animation they DC:d
---
Just a little bit.
---
My beautiful Freddy went from F tier to Z tier overnight
---
And no I don't agree that moris are the best part of being a killer for me it is when I can win a game before 1 gen is done that is the moments I savor a mori isn't hard to do nor is it that rare
---
It isn't a amazing perk I don't see any rank 1 survivors running it
---
Isnt the huntress like 7 foot tall
---
I run WGLF, We'll make it, Dead Hard and Botany.
---
I basically just save people an  take hits for em.
---
The walls that retract also signal that a gen is there
---
Ah I see you are a man of refined tastes.
---
Yeah true story
---
Exactly...
---
Huntress: *starts humming in a diferent way because i spent a long time without getting in a chase
---
Me: ._.
---
Yeahh there’s a problem when one outfit can be purchased with shards and then a near-exact same looking outfit is $4 *facepalm*
---
Yep. It would have been a great base game perk, but putting it behind paid DLC is stupid because none of the new survivors that actually need the perk will get it until they've played the game enough to commit to buying DLC, at which point they shouldn't need it anymore.
---
We are all addicted to a game we hate. Me and my friend dont even really have a good time most games lol, yet it's like the only game we play. 
---
You know what they say about insanity, right?
---
I agree with almost all points you made. I do think DS is in a decent spot right now. All I'd like to see changed is that they reduce the timer a little, but stop it from ticking down while in a chase or while downed.
---
As far as NOED goes: when I first got the game, I tought killer was super easy, I always used NOED. At first it was most likely easy because I was in the low ranks, but I got in the high ranks and kept getting easy 3k's or 4k's. After some time, I started to get involved with the community and that's when I learned how much NOED is hated and seen as a crutch.
---
I removed NOED and that's when I realised how much I relied on the perk. 3k's and 4k's became 1k's and 0k's my looping game was awful and my time of using NOED left me with no necassity to get better since I pretty much always won either way. As a killer main, seing the decisive strike get a rework was heart warming, but I was surprised that the worse offender didn't even get touched. It seems like BHVR is actually alright with the state NOED is in and this is shocking to me. It also shocks me how many people defend a perk that requires the survivors to extremely go out of their way to prevent the perk while the killer has to do nothing to earn it.
---
A tactic to improve one's early game as Trapper is going for chases right off the bat, and setting traps mid-chase instead. You are immediately applying pressure and simultaneously setting up the map.
---
The increased setting speed that came with the rework makes this viable even without setting speed add-ons, and you can even use this to mindgame, cancelling the setting action and potentially getting a free hit on a survivor that ran from the tile fearing it will be trapped - or, once they are aware of this tactic, getting a free hit due to them staying at the tile even if you do commit to trapping it, expecting you not to.
---
Obviously you need an add-on enabling you to carry more traps with this. Additionally, Iridescent Stone or Bloody Coil are valuable here, because the traps you set mid-chase tend to be obvious traps to deny the chased survivor play on the respective tiles, thus allowing other survivors to potentially see and disarm them. Plus, the chased survivor could be going around disarming those traps after you hook/lose them, if you don't tunnel them, and they could also be playing with other survivors, communicating those trap locations for them to disarm. In all of these cases, Iridescent Stone or Bloody Coil give you value out of those traps, still.
---
A 2 killer mode may actually make Freddy viable if being in the dream world makes the other killer invisible to the survivors in the dream world.
---
Never said it was an amazing perk, I said it was an amazing STARTER perk and that's exactly my point. It's inaccessible to starter players and pointless for rank 1 players.
---
Wraith is fun to play with good add ons, but a newer player with only browns and not much map awarness/memorization yet probably thinks wraith sucks.
---
You seem to want liberals to be silenced m8. Or does that hypocrisy go over your head?
---
Wonder what they are gonna do when dbd loses its dedicated servers.
---
I've had the same problem, only I played as killer and couldn't find any hooks
---
What do you mean legion is perfectly balanced
---
/a
---
Solos are not meant to be nearly as strong as SWF. Thats how it should be. Coms and such are part of the SWF deal. Solos are not meant to be equal and do not need to be buffed.
---
Squid kids get killed, we always make sure of that -Legion, maybe
---
Football term aha sorry, if a player's unplayable it means he's playing so well it would be stupid to drop him (weird I know). MoM is a ridiculously good perk.
---
So people shouldn't play the game for fun if they aren't going to focus on rank?
---
WOKE
---
Lol, killer run with three perks for most of the game with NOED. Some killers even ran enduring for old DS. Unless they had spirit fury, then thats basicly two perks down for the game. Ruin? Three perks down. And then survivors wining about how one of their perks doesnt help in a chase.
---
Oh k
---
Survivor main, and it’s a little on the OP side but not to the point where they should nerf it into the ground *(cough cough decisive)*.
---
Lol well there's no shame in finding the perfect synergy. It is the point of the game after all.
---
Plus Ash is a beloved character so it's likely the devs gave him a bit of an edge.
---
Yeah that would be nice if they paused the timer while you're slugged so you can get some use out of a perk I legit paid real money for. 😠
---
The most annoying trapper matches I have are the ones where someone (1 person is enough) is hiding nearby or just checks traps all over the place. It takes more or less nothing from the survivor part and you just wasted a lot of time for nothing.
---
how does this even happen though??
---
I'm still saying it is a meh perk but also if newbies are gonna use it then they are gonna relay on it too much that is why noed is a noob perk to many people
---
How do i do it
---
TBH the way I see it is unless you're using exploits or cheating then you aren't doing anything wrong, I try not to camp or tunnel when I play killer because I know how frustrating it is but there's nothing wrong with it either.
---
With your tactic of looking after a few gens, some survivors think it's scummy just because they don't want to admit that it's poor game management on their part.
---
*do you honestly think you're fu***** funny?*
---
Last game I played, Jeff and I spawned on Ruin. Didn't touch it at first because Nurse immediately came over. She didn't look around too hard, i went over and broke it as soon as she left. She DCed as soon as the boom went off
---
Same
---
And when you carry them upstairs towards it, turns out it's behind a closed gate. Better luck next time!
---
That seems like a teamate problem more than a NOED problem. All of your points. Especialy the SWF one. You described getting screwed because your team was too cordinated. Lol
---
I know this doesn’t really help you but the Pig is a girl. Amanda Young.
---
BT is only annoying when survivors use it to bum rush hooks instead of countering campers as intended. 
---
I’m sure the hooked guy wants you to give me a chance to turn around and go, and I don’t exactly want to lose my Devour Hope stacks, but hey if your points mean that much to you..
---
Forcing me to play Killer makes me a toxic killer especially if the dailie lends to it.  If I don’t want to be playing as Killer, as a Killer I want you to feel my pain.  Get ready to be facecamped, tunneled, Etc.
---
People were DCing versus legion even before that bug came out. Before that, it was Leatherface and Doctor who got the most DCs. Don't make up excuses for these garbage people.
---
no 'cause if you're not bad you don't need that excuse to  actually make your 2 sacrifice
---
Yeah, I get that. There's still 3 more targets to go with. It's okay if you still go for the one, it's a (however much questionable) way to play the game after all. Just don't complain about DS after consciously making the decision to do so while there's still other choices left is all I'm saying.
---
I’m a bit offended by this tbh, rarely play survivor so never encountered this myself. But I for one, doing dailys pretty regularly often say this whether I win or loose. 
---
Also I’m a fairly decent individual so I rarely throws a tantrum when things are not going my way. 
---
Maybe I’m just to positive for this game.
---
Developers need to urge some strange crash bugs though! Sucks loosing rare offerings multiple times per night...
---
'cause they are. And that's what you are supposed to do against Trapper.
---
Do you use headphones? You’re really missing out if you don’t have any kind of headphones, especially as a killer
---
The fact that no ed 1 gives an Insta down with no limitations is broken for sure. 
---
Lemme give you an example of something. Mikey is an instadown built in killer. I, rank 12 survivor, went against a Michael who could not get a single kill. He wasn't being lazy or intentionally bad, he sucked at tracking, couldn't figure out how to run loops, respected pallets, he was pretty much playing as a rank 20. Killer could hit a few of us but would lose us before getting a down. No hooks. We all finish the gens (adrenaline proc for me, which- like most of the time- only gives me a head start to the exit gate and isn't useful otherwise for me. Oh no, adrenaline, something only useful on specific situations) and suddenly noed procs. Suddenly he has three people slugged, hooks two of them, loses the third. I heal the third, unhook the two, Michael Insta downs the first guy I healed and hooks him. Hardcore facecamps. Like the salt level radiating off of that michael was that of the dead sea. 
---
If you need noed to secure a kill, I strongly suggest running without it and learning how to effectively play. Put your pride down and stop worrying about rank for a bit, if you can't complete your objectives without a major crutch perk you need to stop using that perk to improve. Theres a huge difference between end game builds and crutches to ensure you get  at LEAST one kill before the trial ends.
---
Well it is a bug, so not for long
---
Who gives a fuck about Rank 1? Your only reward is longer queue times. Just kill people.
---
I do this with hag and it's so fun.  The survivors always get cocky and think I'm a baby killer, but once all the jungle gyms, pallets, and remaining gens are trapped I usually get a 3 kill easily. Very enjoyable strategy for me
---
But all of them give you a bonus after all gens have been done, thus followibg the logic here, reward you for failing the objective.
---
The point wasn't to say they are equally as powerful as noed, the point was thinking of endgame as the killer has already failed is stupid.
---
In most cases you're going to have to pick one. I'd rather have fun. Hit Rank 1 a dozen times, don't need to do it again.
---
At least there's counterplay. What do you expect me to do against mettle of man?
---
Good idea but imo you're focusing a little too much on killers like LF, Billy and Nurse. They already have a way to avoid MoM (nurse is just fucking broken). We should focus on nerfing it against all the m1 killers because they are the only ones that are getting fucked right now
---
If Trapper could just open a closet to grab a trap (and if he hit the map limit, the first trap would despawn) I'd think he'd rise to mid-tier.
---
Seems like all the complaints you got are from the survivors. Survivors in this game are entitled, whiney brats. You're going to get messages all the time. I've had to just block messages from non-friends. We already have to play by their made up rules (no camping and no tunneling). If you want to enjoy the game a lot more, I HIGHLY recommend turning off your messages.
---
Yea they always say something about how I picked Nurse, NOED, or some bs about camping. 
---
Survivors expect you to walk away and let them off the hook for free.
---

Stupid
---
But thanks :p
---
Its just part of the game. If people are still alive to open the gates, then the killer probably isn’t as good as the survivors and NEEDS that shit.
---
when i saw that the killer made a black ward offering, i instantly knew the match was going to be more difficult for me and it was an infinite t3 Myers with Judith's. i'm so glad there were lockers nearby
---
Even though it is a survival horror game, it's a competitive game at heart and that competitive nature brings out a lot of toxicity. Especially with this game, there's a lot of unwritten community "rules" like camping or tunneling.
---
Algae
---
wtf is wrong with you? denying the killer points for doing their job, people like you is why the game is going to shit.
---
Yeah they mostly are, I don't get many off killers unless I somehow do something to really wind them up lol. I may have to disable messages soon if I get many more, like this isn't the reason I play games.
---
I’ve never seen someone look more toxic saying they aren’t toxic
---
Pretty much! Glad it's not just me though :)
---
I have hundreds of games against pain. I can only think of maybe 1 DC from them to be honest.

I hate survivors when I'm playing killer. 
---
I hate killers when I'm playing survivor. 
---
DBD is salt, love, yell, chat bitching...and I love every moment of it.
---
Bro I know right! 4head
---
how do you think killers feel when survivors tbag the exit gate or hatch? flashlight blind at pallets?  gen rush? just because you get killed and are salty doesnt mean its the killers fault for doing their job.
---
Yeah I agree, there's less in F13 because there's no way of scoring players, but some will still insist they are the 'best' at this, that or the other and instantly turn it as competitive as possible. Kills the spirit of F13 when they play it like that.
---
As stated above, turn off your messages. This community can be toxic and vile. It's rare you'll EVER get a "gg" message at the end. But on the rare occasion you do, holy crap, friend that player!
---
SWF can be really fun, just for God's sake don't bully the killer. there is literally no point. this is a game, not a dick swinging contest. I constantly have to remind survivors of that.
---
I'm sure their "intelligent" auto placement will end up being corners of the map with nothing by it.
---
Yeah, that made sense.
---
That was beautiful, he had like three chances to escape and screwed up each time
---
What if I am bad? What if I'm a survivor main who only plays killer to do daily's?
---
Truth: I'm a bad killer, none of my killers have perks unlocked, I only play killer to do a daily. 
---
&gt; you don't need that excuse to actually make your 2 sacrifice
---
Yes I do...because I'm bad. If I need to make 2 sacrifices with the Nurse....I can either play 10 games or play 1 game and secure kills.
---
Now do you get it?
---
When you hook someone but they have Deliverance and Adrenaline
---
It’s not really the same as adrenaline but it is the counter to adrenaline. Of course sometimes adrenaline gets you up from dying state but most of the time it’s just bringing you from injured to full, so noed counters that and makes it like you never healed a state pretty much. 
---
By itself adrenaline isn’t a big deal but when a whole team has it then it’s ggs because the end game is not good for killer unless they have end game perks or insta downs. Killers with noed shouldn’t get much more then one kill because you will have the gates open by the time they hook someone so you can either leave or go find the totem to make the save. Usually they get more if people start trying to make saves before cleansing the totem. 
---
Finally thought. Your objective is to escape so doing gens isn’t the only objective you have it’s just one part of the puzzle so you didn’t complete your objective until you leave
---
It would be cool. But seeing as the developers are against adding any new mode in two years, its probably not gona happen.
---
You would hope that would be what happens.
---
You know what we get instead? Snarky .gif chains on twitter and snide vague-posting with the occasional "yikes" thrown in for good measure.  And that's just what's in the easily accessed public eye. Their respective discords are much much worse. 
---
And you know what? Most of this wouldn't even be that bad except nearly all of them have  a two faced stance of "No one in my community or myself are toxic, we're all just perfect angels. Now excuse me while I rile up an internet mob to do the dirty work for us"
---
I have no idea why anyone would stick around long enough to do that.
---
Just disconnect and move on, people.
---
&gt;By the time you are finally downed, MoM is up again

and in an instant, you went from sounding like a pro to sounding completely ignorant
---
People of the Fog, 
---
As part of the 2.6.0 update, we made some changes to the emblem system to have a player's rank more accurately reflect their skill level. This was done by setting unique pipping thresholds for each rank range that gradually become more demanding as you climb up the ranks. 
---
While these changes did have the intended outcome, the new pipping thresholds proved to be too demanding on the Survivor side. As a result, not as many Survivors are reaching the higher ranks as we had originally anticipated, making it difficult for green-red ranked killers to find a match. 
---
 
---
WHAT IS CHANGING? 
---
In our next update, the number of points needed for Survivors to reach both the +1 and +2 pip thresholds is reduced by one. Killer pip thresholds remain unchanged for now. 
---
The new Survivor pipping thresholds are as follows: 
---
RANK 17-20 (BROWN) 
---
Unchanged 
---
RANK 13-16 (YELLOW) 
---
RANK 9-12 (GREEN) 
---
0-6 points = -1 pip; 
---
7-9 points = 0 pips; 
---
10-13 points = +1 pip; 
---
14-16 points = +2 pips. 
---
RANK 5-8 (PURPLE) 
---
0-7 points = -1 pip; 
---
8-10 points = 0 pips; 
---
11-13 points = +1 pip; 
---
RANK 1-4 (RED) 
---
0-8 points = -1 pip; 
---
9-11 points = 0 pips; 
---
12-14 points = +1 pip; 
---
15-16 points = +2 pips. 
---
ATTENTION: KILLER PIPPING THRESHOLDS REMAIN UNCHANGED. 
---
 According to the data collected over the past few weeks, these changes ensure a more even distribution of Survivors and Killers in the green-red rank range, which make it easier for high ranked players to find a match. We will continue to closely monitor the changes to the pipping system going forwards.  
---
See you in The Fog, 
---
The Dead by Daylight Team 
---
Not sure. They're trying to fix something they broke, but as their nature, it just breaks other stuff.
---
So I'd have to assume you'd support putting laws in place that ensure labor workers aren't overworked to the point of mental and physical damage, as well as ensuring people who do work physically taxing jobs get paid at the very least the cost of living in their respective area. If you don't agree with that you probably do agree they should have free healthcare, these people who built the infrastructure you enjoy, that you have no respect for, right?
---
Sad to know this :/
---
I was really hoping this would be a ‘soon to come’ feature
---
I feel that it depends on what hex perk you use in terms of how long it will last. Ruin or Hunteress Lullaby tends to go do exceptional faster in comparison to any other hex perk purely because of their impact on gen progression. After that it's a free game to guess when the others will fall.
---
Yeah, also solos cant see the killers perks and add ons untill after the trial no matter when they died, so getting beter at the game is not in the devs line of sight for new stuff.
---
Actually I don’t have clown
---
Interesting though.  In that order?
---
"Just hit them one more time" the survivor and high tier killer mains say as the survivor gets a speed burst out of the pallet deadzone over to the double window building. "Just chase someone else" they say as the next person I hit also has MoM.
---
Wow. Is everyone on this game really this petty?
---
Not on PC. 
---
On PC you start with: Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse and Huntress. 
---
I don't know why that is, but it is.
---
At first I was freaked out with all the messages. I really thought I was doing something wrong. But 99.9% of those messages are from salty people. I’ve been accused of hacking and cheating because the chainsaw downs you with one hit, because you’re dead on your first hook when there’s one survivor left and tons of other stuff that is completely normal and is just how the game works. 
---
Most people I encounter don’t get that you win some and you loose some. They expect everything to go perfectly for them in a match. So just ignore them.
---
Second account. Easily a thousand hours deep. Prior account was constant R1 with Krueger @ P3 — and I still don't understand how that shit works.
---
Just doesn't concern me.
---
Lol ikr. I even apologised at first because, let’s be real getting Mori’d sucks
---
The walls that slide. They will slide open when a gen is completed and you can tell which ones slide. It gives you a 50/50 shot of a gen being in your room or on the opposite side of the wall.
---
Dark grey walls retract into the walls anytime you complete a generator on Gideon Meat Plant.
---
Not really. It's a part of the game for a reason. Trying to hang 4 survivors 3 times each is 12 hangings at worst case scenario. Mori eliminates at least 3 hangings so it's quite practical. This is coming from someone who only plays survivor.
---
Can you get banned or reported even if it's in a private match
---
Mettle of man can be hard to get and if you get a nurse the perk is useless. Also, Killers lime hillbilly have a counter to mettle of man (chainsaw). Mettle of man is still balanced in my opinion.
---
This was an awesome position to mori in!
---
It's something a lot of hags neglect.  Take a free hit if you can get it but getting traps out is your top priority unless that injured someone is right near the basement.
---
I dont get a point of disconnecting - basicaly time wasted
---
Survivors are very entitled and the majority of the trolling and toxicity comes from them. Partly because the balance is still not there yet, especially when SWF comes into play, and partly because the community encourages and excuses it. If you bring this up they'll strawman argument that other game communities are worse as if that magically excuses it.
---
You just missed dealing with the cancer that was pre nerf decisive strike and the game is slowly getting better. Just turn off messaging and play how you want. Anyone who says you have to play by the survivors made up rules is a moron who should be ignored.
---
MoM is actually worse than old DS ever was. You could juggle or run Enduring, you can't do shit against MoM.
---
They definitely are a priority and they are actively being worked on. Not all bugs are equal and this one is a bit trickier to find, meanwhile there are others that have already been reproduced and could be fixed quickly. Changing the pipping thresholds, for example, doesn't require QA to do, a designer can figure out where the problem is and decide what needs to be done. Don't worry though, we haven't forgotten about it, we're still working on them.
---
I think my top 3 may be
---
Huntress, Myers and Plague 
---
Also spirit, wraith, legion and pig are in the running as well
---
So a perk that fucks over weak killers and is ignored by strong killers is balanced? K
---
NOT MY RAGE, BUT AMUSING ENOUGH TO SHARE. JUST GOT OUT OF A MATCH WITH A NURSE THAT WAS FURIOUSLY NODDING AND TELEPORT TEABAGGING AFTER EVERY DOWN. IT WAS SO OBVIOUS THEY WERE BULLIED LAST MATCH AND TAKING IT OUT ON US THAT IT WAS EMBARRASSING. IN THE END THEY TRY TO PRETEND THEY'RE NICE AND GIVING LAST GUY HATCH BUT WE ALL KNOW HOW THEY'RE ACTING SO THEY JUST KEEP SHAKING ON THE GROUND AND DEMANDING THEY JUST STOP FAKING AND GET THE HOOKING OVER WITH. THEY STILL SPENT A GOOD MINUTE SLAPPING THE HOOK BEFORE PUTTING THEM ON IT.
---
DON'T BE LIKE THIS NURSE, KIDS. SPREADING TOXICITY IS BAD ENOUGH, BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT AT LEAST DO IT WELL, INSTEAD OF MAKING THE WHOLE SURVIVOR TEAM PITY YOU
---
He used fatty as an insult, is this guy fucking 5? Lmao
---
this game needs a shardenfoyde taunt for moments like this
---
This is a known issue, we're looking into it.
---

I know?

From 4 days ago. Delete this
---
No they wasn’t...
---
Just thought it was pretty funny my friend showed me it sorry
---
Please reload pasta.
---
I like them
---
Of course it's legion
---
Well I am a killer and both my BP farming and rank scores have TANKED.
---
I see so many Myers on console that I wonder how often PC players see him.
---
no
---
I don't see why not.
---
Its weird that my normal 40-50k leatherface farming is down to 20k.
---
Hag mains are even rarer, which is sad because in the right hands shes so powerful.
---
This is correct. The issue that these changes will fix is the imbalance of Killers and Survivors in the higher ranks. Previously there were not enough Survivors pipping, meaning that high ranked Killers would have to wait a long time for a match because the game wasn't able to find them a good match. The new thresholds will bring the numbers much closer to where they need to be.
---
The emblem system is still going to be looked into, and Killer emblems may be changed in the future, but these changes are just to make sure that Survivors and Killers have an equal chance at pipping for now.
---
Cool clip, but why the hell do people use Rancor + NOED. The combo's useless
---
This is my friend in swf, it is hilarious and annoying at the same time.
---
That is odd. And kinda sucks given the grind of the game
---
Yup. The time window of quick lobbies during peak is slowly decreasing. Generally means a consistent decline in playerbase.
---
It's the first floor terrace. It has the same layout.
---
Ic i was wonder how she can switch her focus when her focus cant be switched but now she focus and can focus more than focus
---
Hatch standoff shouldn't exist, somthing needs to  change to prevent it from happening.
---
The ranking system changed in 2.6.0 to be more difficult, and was later tweaked slightly for the Survivor side in 2.6.4 (two days ago).
---
Bloodpoints were not changed, that bit is all in your head.
---
Witch hunting is non tolerated on this sub or anywhere else. The devs even said something about it in one of there dev blogs. Can’t remember which one though
---
People please stop using this meme WRONG, this is the part of spiderman where when he wears his glasses his sight is blurry, but if he doesnt have the glasses on he see's fine. therefore making this meme InCorRecT.
---
It does, because the DLC and cosmetics are the only thing making them money at this point.
---
This game can be *extremely* frustrating. We don't want to turn new players away.
---
Remember the first time you broke the rank 10 barrier? How you damn-near quit the game (don't lie, it happens to everyone)?
---
That would be the everyone's first experience.
---
Put up with the queue times, and quit being so selfish.
---
Ugh those types that teabag at the exit are just obnoxious. It's not enough to win, you have to be a dick first lol.
---
However, I did receive a pleasant message from a player by the name of 'Revive Me Then' on Xbox. I completed a game as killer with 4/4 and I got the 'message from...' notification immediately. I was thinking 'seriously, another hate mail?' but he actually said GG!
---
Revive Me Then, if you see this then you're a good gent.
---
I’ve been using my p3 Freddy to win games and get about 25-30k blood points then going back and leveling up the others, so I guess that’s my best bet so far other than doctor too
---
Happened to me like 5 times with Claudette.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
All good points, and it sounds like the pre-nerf DS made the community a rather crappy place to be :/
---
How about just target the unhooker? If they do it right in front of me the unhooker is guaranteed to go down. It's better to apply pressure to multiple survivors. There's also the possibility of Decisive Strike on the hooker. You're just wasting time if you're so worried about Borrowed Time.
---
lol wow
---
i wonder why every killer has an animation to step out of trappers beartrap
---
Am I the only one who thinks his callouts hurt the atmosphere of the game and should never have been added? The plague's mori was already more than I wanted, but I guess they're giving up on this silence in the realm of the entity thing.
---
Yeah supporting a dev with money they can use to bring dedicated servers and staff more people to fix the issues is the real problem lol...
---
Thanks for sharing :) I'm glad it's not just me, it seems like we can get hate mail for doing pretty much anything. Can't use certain perks, can't use certain strategies or tactics, can't chase 1 person because it's 'tunneling'. It does thankfully just seem to be a few pissed off players rather than anything specific :)
---
Nah man its has to be like a serial killer type character or higher fumctioning beast.
---
Probably! Or because I mentioned Friday the 13th xD
---
It's amazing that someone can do something as stupid as going for a hook when you're standing right there, after the gates are opened, and get mad about dying and call you the bad player. I play survivor pretty often and if the gate is open and I see a hooked survivor being camped, then I count them as done and get out while I still can. 
---
The really toxic people always have this weird idea of fairness and balance in the game, like it's the killer's responsibility to make sure everyone has a good time and that they aren't picked on too much. People acting like you owe them a free escape because you didn't get them all before the gens were done being a prime example. Weird how these same people don't offer to let the killer hook them if there were no other kills so the killer's experience is fair and balanced too.
---
Mr. X would make a fine character
---
"some characters". Try half the cast. MoM is cancer that actually punishes you for playing certain killers. The permanent aura reveal is such a laughable downside to a ridiculously strong perk. People are already sick of seeing nurse, billy, and huntress all the time, but then this perk comes out and actively punishes you for playing M1 killers. People hate going against NOED, but then this bullshit MoM/DS/Adrenaline/BT meta shows up. I dread the day when it inevitably shows up in the shrine and there's constant 3-4 MoM per lobby.
---
This is already the top post of this week
---
never, as a killer you can gut them gut :) kill them allllllllllllllll
---
Oh okay
---
Sorry but what’s the context? What did I miss?
---
Rank 13-11(fluctuate a lot) and my times are usually 1-3mins. If it ever goes beyond 3mins I just reset.
---
My man ! MVP material 🙌🏼

ZOMBIE TIEM
---
Hocus Focus
---
We’re Gonna Farm Forever you mean lol
---
Having to do an extra hit is literally zero counter play. I don’t know what you’re on about. It’s not as good as old DS, I wouldn’t make that comparison personally, but let’s not pretend its anything more or less than a second chance without the skill part of it.
---
it was to increase his speed
---
I didn't know about this, I'll have to check it out.
---
Not to link shame, but it looks like you're wofting his fart into your face.
---
Switch ruin for overcharge and discordance, run thanatophobia. Ruin is going to got popped most times and good survivors will skill check through it
---
They did though. How you think this clip happened.
---
BHVR says that they can't do anything against lagg-switching because they don't to risk banning people with actual laggs. On the other hand, one of the most famous streamers got banned because he tried to cheat himself a legacy skin, after his account got deleted through a bug, that wasn't uncommen about 2 years ago, because BHVR couldn't give him his legacy skin.
---
Actually, their decisions are quite understandable and i do think they are doing a good job, but still it is hilarous as fck
---
Amanda is a level 100 Traitor.
---
How do you feel about the plagues perk that blocks off three gens? I find it useful but I've only used it with the plague since I haven't unlocked it yet

Jeff needs to not be called Jesus, instead he should rightfully be called heavy metal jesus
---
Spine Chill is extremely underrated in general but it kicks ass in a build like this. You can tell right away if you're actually making a safe save or if the killer's coming back to the hook. Same deal for knowing if you can heal them safely after or not.
---
eW lEgIoN
---
Damn. TIL. Thanks.
---
XDDDDDD
---
No. You're not supporting jack shit with your cash. The game's been plagued by the infinite loading screens for 4 fucking months now and the devs knew about it too, but instead of delaying the Legion DLC they just released it anyway.
---
Stop posting these
---
Just a little Ebony Mori glare.
---
Thank you for well written context!! Greatly appreciated!
---
you can counter with perks such as object of obsession or spine tingle
---
Survivors trying to use MOM against Huntress :
---
Survivors: REEEE MOM don't count hatchets REEEE
---
Huntress: My power counter your crutch perk ? That's too bad ...
---
Yeah, *if* he were to hit. If he's smart, he won't, because then the survivor has to leave, meaning he can down the survivor more easily/safely.
---
Except... if he walks off legion can hit him and then go right back to guarding hatch if he tries to go back... what you're suggesting is pretty much to let the killer get a free kill
---
Can confirm, getting hit with MoM active while 99% healed will trigger MoM and you will still be 99% healed, able to self-care back to full health and take another 2 hits
---
That's not the point, the thing is that they are both unfun and unfair and need to be changed.
---
MYC, Whispers, Rancor. Don’t forget bullshit addons too.
---
Hey thanks! 
---
I come from dota2 and i'm used to toxicity. Is just i didn't tought that making a quest is gonna be an excuse to camp or something xD.
---
I'm having fun with this game and for sure i'm gonna play it more and more
---
Premonition doesn’t work either, t1 Myers is invisible to everything other than just seeing him
---
Who's Moris and why is he appetizing?
---
+100
---
Having $100 bucks is an indicator of success to you?
---
You sure 'accidentaly' dosent mean that you spawned on it
---
What is P3 by the way. Im new to the game sorry.
---
Disagree totems need more uses survs shouldn't be forced to focus totems every game on a chance killer has no ed not to mention not even finding all the totems
---
what u gonna do.... ban me?
---
One thing I hope they add when dedicated servers come back, is that survivors cannot queue for a match until the match they left is finished. If you escape or get sacrificed you can find another game, but leaving gives you a timer.
---
Hit the unhooker instead of trying to tunnel the other guy down. You apply pressure to two survivors this way because the other guy has to go heal/mend
---
/r/ihadastroke
---
Awww am now sad
---
We don't even know anything about the game. Maybe the killer camped and tunneled like a dick?
---
Well, there was this feature where the Killer could close the hatch if he got there first, but it never made it out of the Clown's update PTB.
---
It will if they don’t fix their broken game it will be.
---
As opposed to what? Playing a killer I don’t enjoy so SWF teams can bum rush generators and get out the door in minutes and then I get even less bp? 
---
Yeah that sounds like lots of fun.
---
It's special
---
I can't even begin to explain to you how much this reflects me. All my buddies say "it's easy" and "I finally get it." To this day I still run around aimlessly and hope that the heart beat is below me.....
---
MYC doesn’t even always work. There’s no shame in hiding if you know you’re exposed. Let the killer waste their time searching for you.
---
Whispers is only a general area. It doesn’t tell you where the surv actually is. I might have understood if you chose discordance instead. Whispers is overrated.
---
Rancor lets you see where the killer is when the last gen pops. You have ample time to plan out where to go and how to avoid them. 
---
There are a lot of bullshit addons for sure. I would love to see one shot hatchets get removed. But I don’t think that applies here at all.
---
My ideas for new perks are perks that skillfully help you extend a chase, this one does it unskillfully and I’m not a fan. Again, its not as strong as old DS. But it made my life as a pig/wraith player a whole lot harsher and those are already underpowered killers.
---
Lol whatever dude, keep being salty. 
---
God forbid I play the game I paid for how I like right?
---
Words cannot describe how much I despise getting this map
---
In my experience with trapper, people disarm the traps or get caught in them and immediately go out. Feels like a huge waste of time sometimes.
---
These add-ons without Ruin = gen rush, ez pz noob killer.
---
I'm going to assume you're quite young. Welcome to life.
---
The heal bug is the worse bug I have seen for a while. You can't heal other survivors but it is only sometimes. This has caused so much trouble in games for me and I presume many others.
---
Guess what, the killer also has to go out of their way to protect the totem, not to mention that most hex perks have another way to play around it:
---
Hex: The Third Seal:
---
You don't go blind if you don't get hit and unless the killer is slugging, it's pretty manegable to go on without cleansing the totem
---
Hex: Ruin:
---
Just power trough the generators, it might not have much counterplay, but it doesn't completely fuck over the survivors
---
Hex: Huntresses Lullaby and Hex: Devour Hope:
---
The killer also needs to spend extra time hooking the survivors, with Devour hope, he has to go out of his way to stay outside a radius of the hook and all survivors get a notification that Huntresses Lullaby is active from the moment they get a skillcheck
---
Hex: Thrill of the hunt:
---
This doesn't even need an expanation since the effect isn't really all that strong if the survivors only focus on their main objectives.
---
I might have missed a hex, but there are a few things they all have in common:
---
-They can all be destroyed at the start of the match by cleansing 1 totem
---
-They can all be easyly destroyed before they become a death sentence for survivors
---
And it's true that survivors need to go out of their way to destroy these totems, but the killer also has to go out of his way to protect them, not to mention that cleansing 1 totem that screams "here I am" is way easier and less time consuming than cleaning 5 totems that don't give themself away.
---
Just cleansing all 5 totems before all generators are done isn't worth it most of the time. Just finish the generators as soon as possible and cleanse the lit totem
---
Did I say occasionally? I feel like I said the word occasionally...
---
Unless you're playing hillbilly. I can never seem to find more than 1 or 2 decent straightaways on that map. Super easy to hit doorframes too
---
Spending it without thinking is also the hallmark of a financially irresponsible person. Just depends on the person.
---
Not sad because 80% of hag players are unfun. I like hag when she's played offensively, but sadly most Hags I come up against play defensively, which is no fun.

Oh... look... the entire plaza just DCed

It's not marked as a spoiler btw
---
It's easier to adjust someone else's work than to create your own.
---
Sorry but I don’t see what you are trying to prove here. You asked me to name meta perks with no counterplay, I named them. Instead of admitting that you were wrong you are now twisting it into “they don’t help in chases” and bringing maps etc into it? Why can you bring bs maps into it but I can’t bring in bs addons?
---
Same here. Im just saying it's likely they won't give away more shards than they already are because you can get payed items.
---
the number of players is fine. there isn't enough people willing to play killer on console because console population is very very largely only people who want to play swf
---
That whole 'toxic doesn't exist' bull makes me lean towards that...
---
the player base is perfectly large tho it's just that most of it doesn't want to play killer
---
Playing against clowns on PS4 is pretty fun, but yeah along with nurse and huntress I basically never see him
---
What changed?
---
I’m still trying to finish a few up. I got a 4K the other day with the right setup and nothing popped. I assumed it was just a glitch.
---
That's pretty sweet. Thanks for the response.
---
 Classic toxic survs
---
No one likes you Ontario boy.
---
Oh I know just giving a reason because of the edit.
---
Maybe get a new mouse
---
Keep being bad and getting shit bp every match.
---
NOED's toxic, MoM's toxic, Head On's toxic, I'M toxic! Is there anything else toxic I should know about?!
---
Aaaand now I wanna see an Ed, Edd, &amp; Eddy style show staring the killers...
---
You get the caps, emotes and linkage! Welcome to the Truemitty
---
I do play killer, before the update I always got to rank one now it's hard to get past rank 5 do to the pip system. I play killer during the day and survivor when my friend logs in at about 6pm. I don't mind not using ruin as well. Cause depending on the killer and/or other perks I use, they can slow down the game just as much. Sloppy Butcher for example would be a good perk instead of Ruin. As for killers Doctor, Billy, and any other killer that stalls or has big map pressure is great without ruin. I get some ppl need it or want it to combat those kinds of lobbies but TBH it's untelling how good the ppl actually are. U could take in ruin and wreck everyone before they even have a chance to find ruin. I'm not saying I hate the perk cause it is good and I understand ppl wanting to use it for that reason but I also think that the access use of it especially for killers under rank 10 (which idk why they use it more often than above 10, u would think they wouldn't need it as much) is very annoying. That's all I'm saying

'I'm a woodpecker, Susie'
---
*Slaps hooked survivor over and over*
---
'Cept with meat.'
---
okay so I'm not even wrong, thanks
---
If you don't like the way the Wiki does, you could rework the article instead of complaining.
---
I like this a lot. Not permanently closed, but so that the survivor can't just jump in but must go through a couple second animation of opening the hatch again before the jump prompt appears.
---
I think my biggest bit of advice is try to play survivor and killer 50/50 for at least the first 200 hours.  After that, if you decide to be a killer main, play survivor at least one day each week (or vice versa).  This will help you understand the issues each side has with the other.  Also, consider running perks that help with chase, NOT perks that slow the game down... This will make you a much better player faster, and you'll be more fun to play against.
---
Squid Kids would just kill them, they don't fuck around lemme tell you that.
---
You’ve been hounded by two idiots. I feel for ya, man.
---
here we go again
---
Fair enough. I’m not a trapper main, but I’ll take your word for it.
---
Yes, you are bad because you main Legion. Maining Legion literally means that you are getting dicked on with any other killer, so you have to main killer with no counterplay and no skill required to make your pp hard again.
---
Or you just get hung up on his hitbox which is bigger than that little teenage body and take another hit.

Same shit happens to me. Fuck i would fix the dumb shit connected with my 21:9 monitor (if you dont know, bhvr is very „fair” so that i cant see more than others as in most games, you simply get wider FOV) so in order to maintain the width, they cut out like 3-5cm from up and down of the screen so i see when looking straight with survivor up to their knees if not even higher, same goes to upper part so that i sometimes cant see over a pallet or trash on map where killer’s head is. Hell thats so unfair for me. And i wanted to fix it like it was in F13 for example where i was fine with that fairness but you could change something in game files in order to obtain a fisheye effect, worked perfectly fine as you saw exactly that much as you should, simply a little bit, not even noticable bulkyness. I wrote to bhvr if they can add something like this or if i can change shit in their game, they say no, and that may get be banned. Ffs this game doesnt even have brightness or resolution options...
---
Hag isn’t supposed to chase. You like playing against sub-optimal Hags then
---
well i makes him a threat against all players not just the obsession
---
Hill Billy doesn't suffer on these maps. He's still better than most killers. Big misconception. Just beside you can't use one of your boosts that put you above most killers doesn't make it a bad map for you.
---
I swear I can never find fucking gens on that map.
---
You brought an ebony AS LEGION, and nobody DCed?
---
Also since carburator is getting nerfed please do not nerf it for both, LF's Tuning Guide is fine
---
Hag looks so incredulously sassy in the first panel.
---
ignore whoever yelled at you, they're toxic lol
---
"Maybe you'll be left on the hook longer."
---
Offensive doesn't equate to chasing. Offensive Hags put traps all around the map in high traffic areas that mean they don't need to chase. Defensive Hags put traps around a hook and soft patrol (fancy term for camping). Offensive Hags have high map control, defensive Hags ruin the fun for survivors.
---
Or, since it has an already set way of doing things, I’ll do it how it benefits me the most, and just decide to share it in case others find it helpful. 
---
Sorry we can’t all be selfish people! Have a good day!
---
Depends... I can be full of horse shit of be the science guy
---
Because you deserve a pity escape?
---
oh i'm Freddy main. i just like playing Trapper sometimes cause he's fun to play as. big brain trapping potential :D
---
Dude you're absolutely right!
---
You do sound like an ass.
---
Freedom of speech is useless without reasonable discourse and a desire to understand each other, which you are less interested in than playground childishness.
---
3 kills too. On Haddonfield. As Freddy. Without good add-ons. Had to clutch it on 1 gen left.
---
IIRC the new threshold is 16 meters...isn't that a bit much for non-mobile killers?
---
That explains a lot
---
So u guys enjy playing with one shot huntress with mori?
---
same
---
that's why it's called being the better man - only those who are better do it because it's not easy
---
to answer your question no just bring franklins demise
---
It’s always spoopy time if you want it to be
---
Ones counterable and one is not and doesn’t need a perk slot.
---
Is a survivor horror Game, if you are at the survivor level where the killer has those perks/ offerings You are hopefully equipped with the same level of stuff..
---
Apart from that I'm aiming for a sacrifice trophy, a mori offering really doesn't help me in any way,shape or form.
---
Isnt there a window you can vault on the wall? Or is it sometime closed?
---
honestly you can report away all you want, but it is NOT a bannable offense. 
---
it sucks and i totally get it, but if they are legitimately face camping, you’re dying one way or another. i have no idea why all three survivors altruism boners pop in and they just delay the inevitable for you. 
---
again, i fully understand how horrible and shitty it is, but you either have to instantly kill yourself on hook, or tough it out while your team inches to victory due to you being a martyr.
---
Yeah, I will equip my purple addons in all my brow medkits... Oh...
---
I've been personally speculating that with dedicated servers, it would be easier to impliment such a mode, since it won't be dependent on the killer for the connection
---
And it only took em 2 weeks, now if they could just remove legion as well that'd be great.
---
I never said it was?
---
You are without a doubt the worst reposter I’ve ever heard of!
---
No because its not bannable.
---
It sucks, it's unfun, and they're hilariously bad players for doing it....that being said, camping is not reportable my dude.  Completely within the games rules.  Just something you got to deal with.
---
LoL tHaTs ThE tWo KiLlEr GlItCh YoU iDiOt

I don’t know how anyone thinks MOM is OP when it doesn’t work on half the cast and basically requires you to heal to get the benefit at a good time.
---
N E E D S    M O R E    J P E G
---
No you didn't; I'm calling NOED unfair and saying that using the perk isn't out-skilling someone. I feel like that is a case of where more skill doesn't result in a win.
---
"not good movement"
---
This hurts, because it's true.
---
Why did this take my 5 minutes to figure out
---
i agree people are stupid
---
It's an anti tunneling part, so it works exactly as intended.
---
Stop tunneling if you hate it so much.
---
Aww. I am amazed at you manliness. Keep it going.
---
You mean the add ons that instantly use up a medkit. I mean i do that as i dont see a point in having a yellow, green or purple medkit instantly used up. So to me that seems like my usual survivor strategy.
---
sounds like a really good idea
---
LEgIoN bAd gib 3 karma
---
That's because it doesn't solve the underlying problem.
---
What's the purpose of hatch? To end the game without the last survivor trying to stealth 1-3 gens and dragging the game out for goddamn ever. What happens if the killer closes the hatch? The survivor has to try and stealth 1-3 gens and drags the game out for goddamn ever.
---
So what's the problem with the current hatch? Killer can block it/camp it for the grab, forcing the survivor or either try and stealth 1-3 gens and drag the game out for goddamn ever or challenge the killer to a game of "who can AFK the longest."
---
My proposed hatch changes: 1) make the hatch prompt larger than the killer's model, 2) remove all the hatch spawns that can be bodyblocked at a chokepoint (like in OP), 3) killers can no longer grab you out of the hatch animation, and 4) killers can see the last survivor's aura 60 seconds after they're the last alive.
---
You've got a minute to find the hatch and GTFO. If you get to it, you're out, nothing killer can do. If you don't get to it in time, killer gets to see your aura and beeline for you. The game is ending one way or another, period.
---
This was so adorable. Playing with friends is the best time I have with this game not gonna lie. :)
---
You didn’t really lose your account when it happened, it just basically reset everything to lvl 1, 0 bp, etc.  I didn’t mind it much when it happened to me because the bp compensation I got gave me waaay more progress than I otherwise would have had.
---
And the last part you said is why players don't consider it to be an objective.  No totem counter means soloqueue has no reliable means of ensuring all 5 get taken out.  I take out every dull I see, I average at least 3 per game, sometimes even 4.  I still get rocked by NOED constantly lol.  Randoms don't cleanse totems and I almost exclusively soloqueue due to horrific swf queue times on PS4.  Even if you run Small Game you still have no way of knowing how many you're still looking for.  Having to randomly look for broken pieces of cleansed rubble in random spots isn't a reasonable system lol.  If they were to add a totem counter in the game I would never bitch about the crutch again.  That would be the smallest balance change they could possibly offer that would reasonably satisfy the player base I feel.
---
That's a-mori
---
First time I played on this map I was a survivor, hated it because I got lost a lot, then, I played on it as a killer, also hated it because the survivors knew the map and gen rushed the fuck out of me.
---
1 in 25
---
Platform: PS4
---
Type of Bug: In Game
---
Description: Playing as Killer, 3K in, 1 survivor left, jumped though same window 6 times while in chase. I eventually got the 4th kill, and the entity block animation was there, but the survivor just kept looping in at the Killer Shack. This was on the swamp map.
---
I have noticed it many times in the past week or so, but this time I actually took count and tried to force the survivor to keep looping before I posted here. It has happened on all maps played but only exploited by a few since most know that you only get 3 jumps per chase.
---
That’s a horrible way to go about things. The game isn’t  forcing it’s encouraging. YOU are making yourself toxic by playing like that, even if it’s your first killer game.
---
\*this message was brought to you by the Dead By Daylight DC Squad\*
---
The one problem with that is that I could've sworn that the developers said that the pallet vaulting was the one mechanic they weren't going to remove.
---
That meme is just as dull, somehow even less original.
---
The Pig becomes as big as the Trapper, and looks really weird. So it's actually the trapper animation
---
I think the game sees this:
---
Someone stepped into trap. Survivor?
---
A) Yes. Ok *Caught.* 
---
B)No? Ok *Trapper step out Animation triggers*
---
So it's either/or with no in-between? It's your way or the highway.
---
Brightness option would break game balance. It would be a huge nerf to Claudette and stealth in general.
---
This is why we need a first person survivor mode.
---
I go around rank 7-12 after the latest patch and mostly it's either Myers,Plague,Billy or Nurse.The rest are equally the same but these 4 show up most against me
---
The thing is you can’t loop a legion which is why most people get upset, she hits you 4-3 times without or with franks mixtape and then you go down. The only counter play is to keep distance on her.
---
Looks very similar to this  
---

---
and all their other works
---
I love the sound Dwight makes when he gets hit, it's so goofy
---
By the definition of BHVR, it is legit and "Fun and Interactive Gameplay", spawn in a cluster with your fellow survivors without a shroud and there just so happens to be a Leatherface around the corner, (I've literally spawned in direct line of sight of Leatherface on quite a few matches) and a good bulk of you scatter but some of you run in the same direction because you've been through this shit before and know what's about to happen to get chainsawed by Bubba within the first 6 seconds of the game and then get camped to death?  Why, that's just Fun and Interactive gameplay and if you have an issue with it, you should git gud GG EZ Scrub.
---
YES, PLEASE.
---
I think that window only appears on the top floor balcony.
---
and by “we” I mean, me
---
There is this weird sub community of people connecting Dead by Daylight with Splatoon and I'm suprised no one's talking about it
---
How's about when everyone is dead but the last survivor the hatch is still closed but gives off the audio indication. The survivor has then a series of skill checks in order to open the hatch and escape. The last remaining survivor also has a small speed buff to any remaining generators if the killer is camping/ patrolling the hatch area.
---
Wow, getting  caught cheating gets you banned. News at 11.
---
It's the new flashlight buff
---
Can you explain why it’s so good? I haven’y used it and haven’t been killer against anyone using it. Being able to be seen seems pretty bad.
---
It's not a copypasta. It's just pasta. Please update your comment on the cringe settings
---
LMAO, there are actually people in here legitimizing DCs because their feelings are hurt by killers bringing good items/offerings.
---
Ive been playing for 3 years. Thos build has never failed me
---
I just love it 😍
---
As a Survivor I like it. Give him less predictability, and the chainsaw hits continuing his Sprint with speed limiter just sounds really funny.
---
Literally thought the same thing at first and had to read the comments.
---
The best part is you're probably right.
---
Never felt the need to ever place a survivor in the basement unless I know they are on death hook and it's the nearest hook
---
Oooh right i just saw your other reply
---
Playing survivor, they said. It’d be fun, they said
---
what loser lmao
---
Fire Up is OP. You get a guaranteed 5 tokens with Freddy every match...wait
---
huntress should be 230% movement speed, and infinite hatchets, also her humming is around the map and she doesnt have terror radious, pure balance....
---
whys that funny?
---
About as dumb as reporting survivors for looping or "genrushing".
---
i cryied when i read that the first time, good old google translate;)
---
As clearly stated these are just opinions as I don't own the Truth.
---
You cannot contest the hard facts, but you can contest that the above lead to current players leakage.
---
But, then, which is your opinion?
---
That the above made the game BETTER for survivors?
---
Or that people is leaving for other reasons?
---
Just to understand better...
---
Heres the thing about NOED: the threat of it more important than the its actual power. If NOED wasnt strong, thered be no reason for survivors to cleanse dull totems other than the 600 BP. I think the devs need to introduce another Hex perk that activates mid/late game to further incentivize cleansing dulls. 
---
I hate the speed boost it gives. The Exposed is fine, its the 4% on top that tilts me. 
---
And as others have noted, its frustrating for a killer have a horrible game only to have a 1 kill turn into a 3 or 4k just because NOED. Ofc part of that blame lies on the surv's, but trying to save your team mates is a core aspect of this game. Its no fun to just GTFO and leave your team mates behind.
---
It can be very dangerous in solo, so i usually let my teammate do wtv gens they want and do the one i need to not fuck our team at the end.
---
I wanted to make this joke with a survivor on a gen and Myers stalking, but I couldn't find a good screenshot :(
---
lol the fucking squid kid perks
---
its not me, its google transale, i jut copy-paste what they write lmao
---
why not both?
---
I want the mend timer to go down when your outside of the killers terror radius, not after a chase is broken. I don't like the broken chase mechanics making it impossible for me to run away.
---
No multiple choices? :(
---
I think the best way to counteract Legion would be to remove the mending status, that way even though Legion can still run and vault things, they *have* to hit you four times in frenzy to down you. They also need to get rid of add-ons that allow for more frenzy time/hits in frenzy mode because Legion is way too powerful with such long frenzy times.
---
Its a real shame people have to think ahead and strategize on certain maps
---
I'd have been salty but not that salty since 2 survivors already died.
---
I misunderstood the title and purpose of this post greatly
---
why i play killer mainly
---
Nothing about legion is fun
---
He slurs it quickly so it sounds more like, “you get the capmotes and lickage, welcome to the tru3munity”
---
I would say only use thanatophobia if you run a slow heal time build.
---
Yeah, it's kinda 50/50 for things like these on reddit. Today you could get 100 upvotes and tomorrow you could post the same thing and get 50 downvotes  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Mendings boring as shit tbh
---
Yeah dude fuck the killers that are using the game mechanic as its supposed to be used
---
I did not see the EEnE ref until you happened to post this, I read it, relooked at the picture to notice that Frank looked like Ed somewhat, then reread this.
---
FFS. EEnE was my jam!
---
Ed, Edd, n' **Freddy**
---
10 Mio. Bloodpoints was it, am i right? Thats about 2 characters p3 lvl50 if i am calculating correctly. That's not too good for somebody that has 300+ hrs, and there are many people that have 1000+. And all of this is not important, the really important thing are the legacy skins. But i do understand why they couldn't tolerate it, because then everybody starts cheating a legacy skin and then they are worthless.
---
If its cold...ITS GONE
---
allowing people to "hack" skins opens the doors to other forms of hacking being "acceptable" to certain members of the community.
---
not to mention, if you can hack a legacy skin you can almost certainly hack a paid skin as well, which loses them revenue.
---
i'm just talking off the top of my head, since i don't know how these things are done, but that's my thoughts on why people seem to care.
---
Yes
---
I needed this referral today, bless you ChieSatonakaBestGirl.
---
Add in the post hook speed boost from devour hope.
---
"Killer main"
---
brutal strength is better than thanatophobia on most killers
---
Tv brightness / monitor doe. Not disagreeing at all but people will get around that.
---
Who cares if they lose revenue, they need to fix their shit and worry about skins later
---
Yeah i know but some people just play either in bright places or their monitors can be darker, thats why it should be in there
---
Yeah, it’s really not fun, at all.
---
I know that this sub rags on Legion a lot but he’s honestly the most annoying Killer.
---
On ps4 and I haven't played in quite sometime since my move but when I did get on I've gone against 2 of them. Was around rank 13 when I faced them.
---
You don’t put survivors in the basement? That’s on you then, not the game. If you don’t want to have survivors going for the unsafest hooks, that’s a dumb play. Bubba insta down survs on steps is probably the best experience you can get by playing bubba
---
&gt;&gt;I'm trash at anything ~~that isn't Nurse~~
---
just play killer
---
Some survivors don't farm because it's boring
---
After seeing how they designed the new Temple map, I realized something about the game map:
---
All the stairs are on one side of the downstairs portion.
---
Why? Both these maps have a downstairs section, and they both have all the stairs clumped together.
---
It's essential for those FAT STACKS OF POINTS.
---
Yeah, but I like to win so.....pass
---
But you can literally ignore 2/3rds of the map.  They can’t repair every gen on the other side without forcing themselves into a 3 gen trap, so gens won’t get done in a timely manner or they will and you will be able to completely roadblock the last gen.  Survivors will always have to enter your 3 gen trap through a bottleneck with no cover around the exit, so as long as you defend the neck you can hold the trap under your control indefinitely.  Unless you are a low mobility killer with no traversal or stealth abilities (Clown, Huntress, Plague) you can easily rotate between the three gens and seal up any breakthroughs, then force the survivors back to the bottleneck or force them to come into the bottleneck by hooking their comrades inside the trap and slaughtering them on the approach.
---
The 3 gen strat is true on nearly every map, but on most maps it requires a degree of effort to set up on the part of the killer.  On Azarov’s Resting Place the map does all the hard work for you, all you have to do is not get tricked into abandoning your pre-made 3 gen trap.
---
Yeah in fact I'd argue it's worse for killers.
---
Why?
---
To clarify, the entire reason for the change was to make sure that the amount of killers and survivors in a particular rank range are where they should be so everyone can get a lobby in a reasonable amount of time. Lowering the killer thresholds as well would be one step forward and two steps back since even more killers would be in the higher ranks with not enough survivors to split between them.
---
The matter of depipping or safety pipping when you did well is a separate issue that has to deal with emblem scoring, which is something that can be addressed in the future. It is an edge case, not something caused by the thresholds as a whole.
---
It's actually worse, the only counterplay is to play as certain killers
---
i mean, i do? them making money is how they can afford to continue putting out new content every three months. yeah, the bugs need fixing, but i'm not gonna deny them part of their paycheck while they do so.
---
Flashlights can be used for saving teammates and blinding the killer. If you take it as an insult when survivors try to survive, you should be playing a different game.
---
Its simple. Give them a 30 min ban, a 2 hour ban, a 24 hour ban, 3 days, 7 days,  2 weeks. People will stop DCing if it meant they cant just jump into another one
---
A legit objective that gives the survivor absolutely nothing if the killer does not have NOED. Totems are an absolute time waste unless they give some sort of reward for cleansing them.
---
Well thank you Captain obvious.
---
You don't get it. 
---
We are telling that people should stop justifying their bad games with the excuse of dailies, when the reason they played badly is that they are actually not good enough to do dailies by playing normally.
---
There's no way to get past and I think the killer is trying to bait him to run away.
---
The reason most of these exist is cause of the new content every couple months, they need the bugs fixed or dbd is gonna go into another dark age of unbalance and game breaking glitches
---
most white rank and yellow ranks dont own killer dlc imo. Theyre not super into the game yet, or dont take it more than a casual time killer and dont invest much money. Plague is paid DLC. Ive seen plague about 100 times now so its definitely not that she isnt played. Although in more recent days shes dropping off
---
Its not even a good nurse, its a good killer in general. If you have enough time to find and cleanse 5 totems the killer is dogshit. They have allowed the survivors time double the amount to power gens.
---
Against a good killer survivors need every second
---
I kinda hope they don't fix this.
---
black ward, black ward. watcha gonna do? watcha gonna do whe... \*survivor DCs immediately(with the DC sound)\*
---
No offense, but this isn't in the style of SovietWomble
---
Worst excuse possible. So easy to get around outside of the game.
---
It seems like you will fit in just nicely here. Welcome to the Fog.
---
Exactly, it is not essential; hence why people sound like a 'fucking idiot' when they say it is.
---
I'm talking to the angry ranters in the comments, not to you for your post.
---
I mean if I want to beat survivors into the ground with a boring playstyle I could but survivors need killers and killers need survivors so would hate to push someone away from the game
---
so pro oh my gosh how can i learn from such a master lol
---
Tunneling results in: ruining the match for the survivor, fewer points for the killer, reduced chance for a rank up for the killer, guaranteed de-pip for the survivor.
---
So I'm not sure if you're legitimately butthurt over a meme that is based on my personal experience or being a troll. Sure, it's a game mechanic. But there are also tax loopholes written into tax code, you'd say it's perfectly cool to use those "mechanics" then? Even though it just ends up negatively impacting everyone else?
---
Yeah, it's a game. But it's a game that I spent money on that these preteen killers are ruining.
---
I once had survivors screaming at me in end game chat for using "OP perks". They said Ruin, BBQ and Nurses were OP perks like they had no counter play
---
Oh look it's a filthy bug abuser being proud of himself. Wow.
---
the duality of ranks
---
She's really underwhelming and the fact that you can heal by going to a fountain really feels unrewarding for making a survivor sick. Where most killers like Doctor orTrapper or Haig feel like they get stronger throughout the game, Plague feels like a major uphill battle. I really wish the fountains didn't reset after every one was used, but instead randomly made one clean again. Idk, I feel like she doesn't need a straight buff, but a tweak to her ability
---
My sides are bursting this is the funniest thing ever!
---
Shouldnt take long for them to fix that, they confirmed its a bug
---
You guys are reading too much into this 😂😂😂😂😭
---
Post one up and we can compare
---
This is really well made!!!
---
Maybe your right, just being a low rank survivor I just got to see what a new player would come across and just feel like it needs refreshed otherwise new players would just drop it
---
I'm joking because it's a beaten horse
---
Yeah but if all gates are open it isn't camping
---
Also hackign in the cosmetics typically uses a similar method to hacking in more items and offerings and such. So while in this case the user in question might not have hacked in offerings as well, it's still a similar exploit, and exploits shouldn't be abused like that.
---
Very soon. We tried a different communication strategy with the past chapter and after hearing the feedback, we're going to be ramping up the communication again and doing some of the things we used to do (Q&amp;As, streams, etc).
---
The points stated were just the ones I identified as a cause for the increase in dcing. I'm not saying those people are necessarily always right in rage quitting. As far as the ones you disagree with It's more of a matter of opinion. I appreciate the constructive comment instead of all these hardcore killer mains immediately raging any time someone mentions their favorite crutches.  There will always be be people leaving the game just because they don't like the killer or they failed a juke but they were always a minority. There for I don't think just adding a punishment would fix the issue. Some problems need to be dealt with and hopefully everything else will feel normal in comparison.
---
oh i thought it was the one where he got the belt that could shrink people
---
You are just proving that you are braindead with every comment. Legion has no counterplay in chases, are you denying that? It takes him ages to down survivors without addons tho, that makes him not OP. Is that too hard for you to understand?
---
I also never said nurse is fine. Legion and nurse both ignore chase mechanics, but at least nurse takes skill to play as, and I can appreciate it. 
---
And yeah, DC against Legion just means I want to actually play the game, not providing Legion player with a false feeling that he is actually capable of doing something in this game.
---
What punishments? Sure they'll ban you if you hack, but you could quit 50 matches in a row and not have anything happen.
---
So it's like when they do special yearly events.

Okay Helen.
---
This is all true. It still feels like complete crap when you get camped though.
---
Double tunneling, you get double tapped instantly and cannot loop or use any basic survivor advanteges, and if you escape a killer grasp, the 2nd one will just *swing* at you so yeah it would be fun but also it would be hell
---
Yeah, but if you look at the following equation:
---
Fun &lt; Expand Epeen
---
You’ll see why many killers will still cheese Azarov’s Resting Place for easy, slow, and incredibly boring games.
---
There is already a game mode where you can kill your friends to get better at killer but its 1v4. Unless your saying you regularly have 5-8 friends playing dbd and 1 other friend who is playing a killer?
---
Wait. You're a dev? This makes me happy. A dev awnsered my post :)
---
May I ask anothe qustion to you?
---
As a pig main, this makes me laugh.
---
Well yeah, but it feels like crap to lose as a killer or not get saved by ur team, or have ur ruin popped within 3 seconds of the game starting,
---
Losing is gonna suck, but doesn’t mean the game needs to be designed so you can’t lose
---
3min ago I made a post asking when news would appear. A dev awnsered with very soon. This is quicker than I expecticed. Good job dev that awnsered my post!

Yeah I might just change the title so people stop hurting themselves

No joke, I sorted by new and was reading your thread when you replied.

He's the only killer who has a build that you literally can't outplay. If he sees you, you're dead.
---
welcome to Dead by Disconnect
---
Id say its worst now then ever before, but there is really not much of a penalty for it.  Sure you can get banned after a high amount 60%, i think the number was.  So if you play 10 matches a day, you can DC for 6 and still be ok.  That is assuming BVHR is still banning for high DC amounts
---
By "can't" i mean if you actually did dc that many times and got reported you would be banned. I 100% agree dcing is an epicdemic and should be stopped.
---
In the old PTB if the killer closed the hatch, then the exit gates powered up.
---
The rumored Freddy rework...
---
Sorry!
---
\*Saw theme song plays\*
---
Hello RyGuyTheGingerGuy, I want to play a game.
---
Nice, its great seeing they working on things the community been requesting.
---
 The best part is they communicating on the progress so we know our feedback is not falling on deaf ears
---
Cancelling game with less than 5 players is something they should’ve been doing since the beginning
---
When does it go live?
---
I play on PS4, green rank, and I face her pretty often. I honestly don’t find matches against her really fun. I prefer to go against killers like the hag, trapper, clown
---
No mention of the performance improvements which is a little worrying. I like developer updates in general though so this is a good idea.
---
Actually hyped for the first time in like few months.
---
Never instantly kill yourself on hook against a facecamper unless you're just an avid fan of facecampers and want to reward them for doing it to you.  The only counter to facecamping is buying every last second you can on the hook while your teamates rush the gens and hopefully wait at the open exit gate to teabag that babykillers ass.  You killing yourself is their best case scenario as they're now able to take that time and find and start the process again with a second kill now.  Struggle to your last breath.  Fuck camping trash, punish that shit.
---
Our time has come!!!!
---
Let's go BITCHES
---
You were only ever gonna play Nurse, Billy and Huntress, get outta here with this nonsense
---
Well why can’t you use arguments from that video to answer my questions then? Is that still too hard for Legion main?
---
Sounds like they’re just turning into a completely different killer gameplay wise. It makes sense that that would take a long time
---
legion change hype
---
Wow, epic. Enjoy your depression and alcoholism once you realized that your life's over.
---
same as the achievement description from legion
---
Absolutely the lowest effort post I’ve seen in a long time. Noed bad updoots to the left
---
"Greetings, hooded youth! May I pass?"  
---
"Nah fam"
---
You missed the purpose of this thread, I wasn't asking 'how do I block people' :) My Xbox profile is 12 years old atm so I've already dealt with my fair share of numpties over the years; I made this thread to ask if other people experienced similar toxicity from players.
---
Typical response.
---
YEEHAW CHUCKLEFUCKS, FREDDY’S BACK
---
End game change?
---
I’ll believe it when I see it
---
Didn’t they promise a Freddy reword a year ago, is there an official date when it finally releases??
---
it's not an update to the game. it's the developers telling us what they're currently working on and will work on throughout the next few months
---
Game Quentin reminds me of EverymanHybrid's Evan for some reason.
---
Couldve just shopped a mallet in trappers hand. 1/10.
---
There’s no official release date, but check the developer update they just posted on Twitter
---
Day 1 of Freddy rework : HE’S OP PLZ NERF 
---
Well there’s always next year
---
theres another red stain. theres a 3rd killer. looks to me like the clown. hes making VHS PORN AGAIN! RUN!
---
Played her about 6 times last night. Got a pretty wicked build on her. One of my favs to play.
---
Except that they do, and that dedicated servers will fix the issue anyway come this summer so it's a moot point.
---
Well let’s hope people can hold their tongue for a few weeks before spewing bullshit. That’s exactly what happened with Freddy when he was first released.
---
Im a freddy main and estatic but i dont want him to be so hars i cant control the guy. Tbh i felt all they needed was to shorten the time and if no one if fully in the dream world pallets dont work on him.
---
It's bottom floor
---
wait, how do i disconnect from reddit? /s
---
Oh trust me, they are reworking everything about him. Read the [developer update ](https://twitter.com/deadbybhvr/status/1116762134522806273?s=21)
---
I wasn't trying to disagree with anything you said, nor project anything onto what you said. Just my experience that people who think bbq is too strong don't have a proper understanding of the game.
---
you want the following:
---
self-care from claudette
---
urban evasion and balanced landing from nea
---
sprint burst and adrenaline and quick and quiet from meg
---
lithe from feng
---
ace in the hole from ace
---
WGLF and dead hard from david
---
thats just off the top of my head
---
Me gonna live forever then
---
Thats what worrys me fellow freddy main...
---
It's not much more fun as killer. Fight over a tight 3 and then get called a camper for not playing dumb and having gennies on both sides of the map.
---
Best thing to do as:
---
Killer: close chat and never reopen it
---
Survivor: get friends into the game. Solo queue is the worst.
---
theres a freddy rework in the works :O
---
Blessing BHVR up.
---

---
Only took 3 years to get it :)
---
Once you’ve hit rock bottom like Freddy has, there’s only one way to go.
---
Rift now it is at its worst it has ever been
---
Nah, NOED is in a good place right now.
---
Are you the official BHVR Defense Force or what?
---
Sure you can do whatever the fuck you want with your cash. Save it, spend it on expensive cars or just fucking send it to some Nigerian prince it's your money, but it still doesn't mean I can't make fun of you for throwing it out of the window. Buying auric cells in DbD is like buying stretched drugs from a dealer who secretly also throws rat poison in it.
---
But then he wouldn't be getting his mallet as he'd already have one in his hand...
---
He isnt rock bottom. People just dont know how to use him!
---
I knew my brain was giving me the wrong word
---
change to end game? no more 3v1s? ok BHVR, im listening..
---
Can’t tell if that’s a joke or not, but I’m gonna go with it’s a joke.
---
Thanks, good news they’re changing both Freddy and legion
---
I'm in a match with him currently XD
---
I got so many comments on my vid here on reddit accusing me for stealing his idea. Just wanted to clear the air around this! Heres the video reference: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?time\_continue=1&amp;v=CeASjhRovF8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&amp;v=CeASjhRovF8)
---
Put traps only around hooked survivor: boring game where you'll usually score one, maybe two kills. (Maybe more against survivors who don't learn).
---
Put traps to shut down chase areas/loops: more dynamic game with 4k potential.
---
I love hag and seeing people use traps to essentially camp from a distance makes me laugh. Small plays from basic people. Nothing is more satisfying than slapping, watching then run to another trap and getting the down.
---
Now we just wait for a leatherface buff/rework. After that who knows.
---
This is literally my brother whenever there’s Ruin
---
Well,....its kinda a mixed bag of joke and honest
---
This is the first of a series of news posts where we can share our progress on fixes and upcoming changes/features. It's not a *game* update, more of a *community* update.
---
I spent $550+ on TF2 in my first 6 months of playing the game. The difference is that those items held actual value and they were nice, while DbD's cosmetics are account bound and are exactly worth NADA, zero, nothing. Once you press that confirmation to buy auric cells your money is gone.
---
Yeah, killer variety at top ranks was *too* diverse, makes sense that they'd want to consolidate player's choices to Nurse/Billy/Huntress
---
&gt;Back in December 2018, we announced that we will be bringing Dedicated Servers to Dead By Daylight by Summer 2019. We are currently testing the Dedicated Servers internally!
---
&gt;Migrating to Dedicated Servers is a process that will roll out over time, first on the PTB, and then, to a segmented percentage of the population on the live environment. This gradual roll out will allow our team to gather data and feedback to ensure the smoothest transition. The first public tests should happen in the next few weeks. 
---
NUT.
---
wouldn't be a problem if you didn't camp hooks ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Killers really that petty? I find it most fun in the chases and the mind games, people really like to just ruin the game for others?
---
still miss my legacy 3 Nea - I miss her everyday
---
Ooooo looking forward to the End Game Collapse!
---
It has been in the works for years.    I'll believe it when I see it.
---
Fingers crossed legion change is good
---
I figured. There are a few people on here who think Freddy is really good and people just don’t know how to play him but that’s only partially true. I’d say I can play him really well and even then other killers are better. Plus most of the guys are probably just going against shit survivors, so that’s why they think Freddy is really good.
---
It was worse right before they started banning for repeated disconnects but right now is close
---
I wasn't asking a question, I was sharing my experience. When I bring flashlights, I end up getting facecamped a lot more compared to when I bring toolboxes, medkits, no item, etc.
---
Honestly, that's the point where I would just run away and start doing gens, nearly finish three that are close together, then finish them all one at a time. Especially if I know where the killer's waiting by the hatch but they don't know I know. The killer will either panic and head towards the exit gates to try and catch you, giving you a chance to grab the hatch, or stay there assuming you're trying to do that and you escape through an exit gate.
---
I would say the speed should be a maximum of 3% and the exposed around the gate should be changed based on tiers of the perk, but other than that a good tower idea.
---
Understood, but that's not a part of my argument haha.
---
Lag switch=dead this summer when Dedicated servers come in to play, just saying
---
they say they spent so long cuz his overhaul is probably gonna change his entire ability.
---
Noot Noot!
---
I don't know, man. I really enjoy how Freddy plays, and I'm worried they will completely change his strategy.
---
Well i waa using him at rank 4 so he isnt good but i would use him over certain killers.
---
in before Freddy gets reworked and comes out worse than he is now.
---
End Game Collapse?
---
Thanks for the suggestion!
---
Personally I’d like the Deep Wounds to be tied to Terror Radius rather than chase and also maybe sprinkle in a couple skill checks in there so that you can mend slightly faster if you can hit a great.
---
(This is probably an awful idea but It IS coming from a Legion/Survivor main with no real problems facing a Legion, I hate Spirit and Hag a whole lot more than I ever could hate Legion)
---
Well they did say they were changing his power completely, so it seems like people will have to learn him again. I’m fine with it tbh.
---
no, if you dc right now you get back your pips, you can only depip if you get hooked fast and die in the trial, not with dcing. (i think this is why people actually dc right now if the killer finds them first: they don't want to depip)
---
So basically Fire Up but way stronger
---
Naah bro
---
not really, at least those maps aren't a straight line
---
Id prefer the effect to drpend on remaining totems rather than tied to one totem. Cleansing 4 totems right now is worthless
---
I can't believe it's happening
---
straight line seems balanced
---
Yo how do u do this?
---
Tunneling gens results in: ruining the match for the killer, fewer points for the survivors, reduced chance to rank up for the survivors, guaranteed de-pip for the killer.
---
Why don't you go around and tap each gen to 99% instead of popping them ASAP if the match is going 'too quickly' for the killer?
---
Holy shit the game is going to back out if someone gets kicked during loading and you keep all of your stuff awesome!
---
I agree with you, the chase is arguably the most enjoyable part of the game.  But yea I’ve had multiple killers face camp me because I ran them around for 2 gens, let alone the ones I ran around for more.  Thats my biggest complaint though, if I get face camped I can’t work on gens so I typically get 4~6k points and depip.
---
And Leatherface doesnt have traps.
---
You can now until they fix the bug...
---
No one is telling him he can't be frustrated, just that it's dumb to be mad at your opponent for it. Survivors tunnel gens, killers tunnel survivors. It's not fun for anyone but hate the game, not the player.
---
I know I definitely am.
---
Fair enough. I think Freddy is more reliant on the survivors than the players skill. He’s just a M1 killer at the end of the day.
---
So glad they're reaching out to the community and actually communicating thanks Behavior!!!
---
Let's do it you and me. I call dips on Amanda
---
Well when you’re the worst killer in the game there’s only one way to go
---
&gt; The upcoming mid-chapter patch will include an update to The Legion. **This is something the community has been requesting since its release back in December 2018.** Stay tuned as we will reveal these changes in a blogpost next week.   
---
  
---
We did it, boys and girls! They're deleting Legion!
---
I do use headphones it just seems harder to hear them now for some reason
---
I have actually seen it and can confirm that it's real. Very real. Keep an eye out, we'll keep you posted.
---
I think if they kept the pallet vaulting mechanic but window vault be a normal killer vault and maybe get rid of deep wound timer
---
I thought you were talking to me, lol, but yeah that guy is saying to just camp the 3 gens, which isnt fun
---
NOED is fine.
---
It seems like such a good idea on paper but would turn into double Cannibal face camping. I’d like to see a team vs team game mode though. 
---
So you’re a team of 5, one being the killer. You have to beat out the other team of five. Gens are blank to start but once they reach 50% (repair times would be adjusted for this mode so 50% would be more like 75% of current gen repair time) they belong to a team. The other team can steal it by undoing their progress and getting to 50% for their team. They still go up to 100% though so you can fully do a gen to buy your team more time from getting stolen. Once the gates are open you’d still have to hold gen control though. So the team with 5 gens owned can escape while the other team has the blood warden wall at the exit. In this mode you can’t be killed. Getting hooked just permanently slows your repair time by 25% to a max of 50%. There would be 9 gens instead of 7. Totems/Hed totems could be repaired.
---
These are just some of the ideas I’ve had for a mode like this. I think it could be really cool as a team game. The killers are competing, the survivors are competing, and it’d add a whole new dimension to the game.
---
Just take it upon yourself to repair the correct gens.  Rush immediately for the 2 you yourself can take out to prevent that 3 gen
---
Yeah, I agree, the map too spread out for non nurse killers. It really is a pain for both sides (Mostly killer with good survivors)
---
As real as the console optimization ~~patch~~ **pass**?  Because that turned out so great.
---
O  i  n  k
---
I actually really like games with 2 or 1 survivors left because it feels scarier and more cozy. I'm gonna miss it, but it's for the greater good :c
---
The corrupted Veteran. Still lots to learn as a survivor main playing killer!
---
finally someone understands. i keep telling people in this sub to not instantly suicide on hook and all i get is the hurtful blue arrows and people yelling “ThEy JuSt WaNt To GeT iN ThEiR nExT gAmE”
---
you people like that are promoting the “strategy” and make people see it is viable. i basement bubba’d for a week and actually pipped up (under the old pip system of course). i would get 3k more often than not and it was sad.
---
it’s such an easy thing to combat!! just genrush!!
---
Survivors really just want a brainless experience sometimes.
---
It's because I'm always watching.  
---
*Always.*
---
\^ exactly.
---
Reworks take a long time, but isn't it also kind of difficult to come up with ideas for a new power? Like... the entire idea about Freddy Krueger is that he tortures you in your dreams. You have to be asleep to see him. I understand why it takes such a long time tbh
---
What was it about?
---
&gt;The first public tests of dedicated should happen in the next few weeks. 
---
FINALLY
---
** "END GAME COLLAPSE" **
---
"The upcoming mid-chapter will feature a major update to the end game. The objective of these changes is to make the end game more dynamic and exciting. We will reveal the new End Game Collapse in a video next week."
---
Uhh fuck yes thank you - new objectives for the endgame?
---
Lol first off I'll address you're second point, I don't even play Legion I don't enjoy him as a killer.  Try not to assume dumb shit.
---
Second I watched that video 4 times.  Where did he exploit?  He frenzied the chick, she ran to the building, he then mindgamed the fuck out of her by manipulating his glow around the building and catching her by surprise at the window she was chilling at.  He picks her up, walks towards the door and downs the insanity that was the mindnumbingly stupid BM she was doing when she easily could have made it out the exit gate.  He then moris them.  I mean where was the exploit?  I saw a killer outplay the first survivor and get a kill donated by a potato Claudette.  I don't think killers are naturally toxic for running an ebony.  They both made it to endgame so he obviously wasn't heart tunneling off hook which would have been toxic.  You just come across as an entitled saltlord man.
---
What update?
---
It's still funny though
---
You're paying some dude $6.00 + tip to deliver you a $7.00 burrito? Some one got paid today...
---
I mean, you are on the hook so its not like its exploitable. Makes sense to me.
---
As a new freddy main I'm both scared and frightened lets go babey!!!!
---
While a lot of the stuff here is nice, and I eagerly await Endgame changes and Legion changes, I must say:
---
I'm not looking forward to the future.  Freddy is the most fun killer in the game for me as a killer, and honestly still more fun than Hillbilly as a Survivor.  After spending so long to learn enough of Freddy's weird tech to make him useful, I'm not looking forward to having to completely unlearn him for whatever new power he ends up with.  At this point I suppose I should just pray that they don't turn him into a boring soulless killer who's power only works on potatoes like Clown.  I'm already expecting that his stall and tracking are dead so here's hoping for some sort of mobility tool if I continue playing him.
---
They said when he got his mini rework they would give him that buff if he seemed like he was under performing.
---
Personally I largely do fine in a lot of games with or without traps. Trapper has some great base stats and he has addons to fight against disarms, like the one to rearm them every 30 seconds or the one that injures them.
---
If you play without ruin at higher ranks you need insane map pressure. IMO Combo M&amp;B with the speed add ons while phasing. So you can catch the people as they creep away from the generators.
---
Firstly, welcome to the cult of Freddy. We have cookies and milk. 
---
Secondly, I wouldn’t be too scared. Since he’s already so bad and they’re completely redoing his power he can only get better.
---
Cannibal Perk: "No One Escapes Insidious" You've hooked everyone in the basement through your truly tactical and honorable method of soft patrolling the corners in the basement with Insidious and chainsawing them all. All except 1 who stayed out of your basement. Now when survivors attempt to escape via the hatch, there is a 50%/75%/100% chance that the entity grabs them and puts them on the basement hook. This triggers any perk you have relating to hooking survivors in the basement and activates your Insidious perk While the survivor is hooked/ up to 60 seconds after the survivor is sacrificed or unhooked/ permanently.
---
"I wasn't camping, I was afk while sitting infront of you with my chainsaw revved for 2 gens." - P3 Cannibal using Hex: Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, BBQ and Chili, and Insidious.
---
For some reason I thought you were talking about death garden hahaha
---
But it does nothing. Absolutley nothing. Killer still gets to oneshot everyone and youve wasted 5 plus minutes cleansing
---
Nah, let's just give her a Chainsaw Sprint (like Hillbilly's) to replace her M1. 
---
That's the only buff she needs.
---
I got a couple other things, too, actually! It's the only day off I've had in about a month and a half so I'm in pajamas all day treating myself
---
3rd prestige. You get a cosmetic when you prestige and you get the final cosmetic when you get to the third so it's considered the goal.
---
Oh wow, this pretty much covers all the bases.
---
no 2 killers and 8 survivors
---
No I promise you, when you cleanse the burning totem it completely removes the Exposed effect.
---
End Game Collapse sounds interesting. Almost makes me think they’re gonna do a thing where the Entity starts collapsing in on the map after the last generator pops, which would probably prevent folks from hanging around too long after the gates are open.
---
k.
---
Phasing is probably one of the most fun abilities to use. If you’re looking for mind games definitely spirit. Plague has a great late game against survivors that cleanse which is also equally as fun. 
---
Legion is trash. Unfun for killer and survivor.
---
Plague is fun
---
We're glad you like it. We'd like to make this a regular thing as well as bringing back some of the old favourites like Q&amp;As.
---
Well, we can only hope! Does seem like it can only go up from here. Even it goes worse, I'm still gonna main dream boi. 
---
*sips milk*
---
Isn't there a perk that hides bloodstains?
---
Very nice.
---
Cool!
---
&gt;Dedicated Server testing
---
Yes...
---
&gt;Legion fix
---
Yes!
---
&gt;Less boring end-game
---
**YES!**
---
&gt;Freddy Rework
---
#**YEEEEEEEES!**
---
Thought so.
---
stepping in traps isnt gay liking it is
---
The devs clarified many things on what they are planning for the mid-game update.
---
The biggest things being;
---
- Legion Rework coming
---
- Freddy being totally rebuilt
---
- End-game has been heavily changed. This could be amazing as having all gens doen could be mid-game which extends the game for killers.
---
- Fixes to match making &amp; infinite loading screens
---
- Making any game with less than 5 players instantly return survivors &amp; killers to loadout screen while returning all offerings &amp; items to prevent 3 man survivor games.
---
I think he’s not gonna be OP, but a helluva lot better. Maybe he’ll be in C tier. It still boggles my mind that Freddy might be in a tier other than F.
---
Nice
---
Spirit it's fun
---
fair enough
---
Personally I say plague.
---
You do it if it's so important to you.
---
this isn't impressive though... Like you mess up a lot
---
End Game Collapse almost makes it sound like the Entity will start collapsing in on the map at a certain point, which would make it harder for folks to draw games out or linger after the last generator gets popped.
---
At this point, the Freddy rework has been so long I wouldn't even be mad if Freddy was the next Nurse, or better than Nurse.
---
Beautiful
---
Nice about time they fix Freddy. He was the first killer I about because he sounded cool but I didn’t know he was trash
---
Spirit for sure, but Freddy is getting his rework next patch so maybe take a look at him. He’s fun as shit.
---
Isn’t that legion?
---
screw logic
---
Nah, I dont recycle memes like half this sub does.
---
Nightmare rework! Wowowowowkwowowkwk
---
ngl for me it sounds like a zombie apocalypse
---
Don't use M&amp;A, it's unnecessary and only makes it harder for you to mind game. You can actually use Distressing to give off a very distant faint terror radius, which will mask your ghost woosh for sneaky gen grabs.
---
Depends. Legion is bad, but he’s simultaneously good. People despise the shit out of them, but they tend to have a hard time getting kills. Only with Frank’s Mixtape are they godly.
---
Considering I've only started to learn how to run effectively, I'm impressed by myself. You don't have to be. I was uploading it because I was proud of the editing.
---
Legion if u want people to DC
---
*Freddy is fun though*   
---
If you wanna ruin people’s day play Legion      
---
If you wanna ruin my day play Plague     
---
If you wanna take a long time to learn a character while ruining people’s day, play Spirit
---
Legion's in a weird spot. I feel like they're not fun to play against at all, but also fairly weak. Feral Frenzy doesn't do much other than slow the game down a bit.
---
\&gt;Getting punished for being too good
---
# Very cool BHVR, very cool.
---
*laughs in corrupt intervention*
---
There is a 24/7 stream of Ed Edd n' Eddy on youtube btw.
---
I got that glitch too as survivor! I literally had to tap for healing and gens cuz there is no skillcheck meter. I got it once more before that but it was a KYF. We need to report this shit
---
I have the exact opposite issue where I'll unhook someone while using WMI and they'll run to god knows where leaving a nice little trail to two survivors, one of whom is injured
---
Yeah I don’t get it either and that makes me sad
---
"Prepare for the mighty THREE AXE BEATING!!"
---
This just makes it worse for the survivor, it's 100 times more reliable to get a kill by patroling the exit gates than it is to guard the hatch. There is no real choice.
---
Definetely, dedicated servers is a huge buff for survivors
---
Did you look at the addons?
---
Why would you play kill your self? /s
---
Tnx bb &lt;3
---
lmao my bad
---
I’m so ready to fall in love with Freddy again and I’m even double hyped to see a healthier Legion.
---
It usually just fires up my ass tho
---
It's not exactly "free", they played with 3 perks for 90% of the match. Besides, five generators getting powered doesn't necessarily mean the player is bad, there's entire builds you can run that rely on that happening. A killer running Blood Warden/Remember Me/Rancor isn't any worse than ones that use Ruin/Corrupt/Bitter Murmer just because they get their kills later in the match on average. 
---
Players have got to stop giving each other pats on the back for repairing five generators though, most of the resentment over NOED seems comes from the idea that many of them believe that they're entitled to cruise to victory just because five of them popped.
---
They stack the mend timer. 
---
Some say you could be mending for like five minutes.
---
Killer is going to be insanely fucking difficult when that happens given SWF comms is what you play against every match. You think there's a lack of people playing killer now on console? Just you wait. There's going to be no one doing it.
---
Legion's weak if you play him the right way, so don't go for him. Plag is annoying to play against unless if players don't stay  broken. I'd say go for spirit. She's the least annoying to play against
---
Experimentanting on communication as well huh? As long as if to improve, then anything should be valid I guess.
---
Congrats to you, since you're the person who actually bother reading a lot of the community stuff and care enough to reply here and on the forum. Keep up the good work and thanks for replying.

It's definitely gonna be a different expiriance for the killer. Imo it's gonna be really wierd. As killer you often know your lunge range. Now you gonna have to lunge a little early. Many people are afraid that playing killer will get way more difficult
---
chill out my man
---
Then you actually hear a bell instead of a big cat growl, and realise you’re probably getting Wraith tunnelled for knowing where Ruin is
---
Sure it’s a buff because now killers  can’t lag switch survivors to death. Look at my last post of you need an example.
---
NOED rewards bad players for doing nothing
---
...What? How is this a response to anything I said? I didn't write anything in all caps, didn't pack it with swears, etc. I'm just pointing out the reality.
---
holy shit. This is the best patch ive seen in a long time. Theyre literally addressing every issue i have with the game atm
---
The entire sub is a zap branigan quote. I'm sicked but curious.
---
End game collapse kinda scares me.
---
It's a little hard to tell what's going on from the screenshot. Just to make sure, the wall with the window is to your right?
---
Also, did anything unusual happen before that? If you've got any other details, I can pass this on to the QA team.
---
Though I have missed the developer streams over the past few months, I have to say that these written blogs are growing on me a lot. I'm one of those people who likes getting to the meat and potatoes, so a well written and informative blog does me just fine.
---
The PTB for the midseason chapter in a couple of weeks is gonna be insane from the looks of it. Seems like it'll easily be the largest in size and most important one released to date. An endgame change and a Legion rework is most welcomed and I'm curious if I was on to something in rework ideas for both that I posted in separate threads some weeks ago.
---
Just play with me as a teammate and it'll always feel like you're a man down.
---
what an idiot
---
Remember when they said they literally could not ban on console when people were doing the short lived prestige exploit on console they suddenly were threatening bans?
---
Thank you, NPC# 46181
---
Same goes for Decisive Strike
---
Possible stupid question:
---
Will the game still end if a killer rage quits nor will the killer still act as host just not on their own connection?
---
lmao, last match i got a Meg with WMI and every damn time she unhooked me, she was running into a corner of the map and then healed me. when survivors don't heal me at the hook then i'll just do gens or look for a medkit but it was a Spirit and i'm kind of scared by her, especially when i'm injured so she just wasted both of our time instead of gtfo already
---
I'm actually dead but thats amazing lol
---
Super happy to hear about the failsafe for partial matches so we don't lose our consumables. Thanks!
---
Yes, they ban hackers or exploiters that can easily be caught, but I think that one time was a scare tactic to show people "hey we can ban now, so behave." I'm not going to speak for console players as I play PC and only know PC, but I'm calling out being able to quit 50 killer matches in a weekend and having nothing done, not even a 1 day temp ban. 
---
They need to fix quitting penalties now, quitting is extremely frustrating on both sides. If there were punishments then killers wouldn't be so hasty to waste survivor offerings or throw a fit and end the match/fun early, and survivors wouldn't rage about being found first, or quitting to deny bbq/mori and screwing over the rest of the survivors.
---
Nice to see they're doing something for Legion, but I get the feeling it's just going to be a fix for the mixtape bug and not a fix for the more fundamental problems surrounding Legion which make them unfun to play as or against.
---
The random trap out in the open is always the most satisfying one to get a survivor caught in.
---
No, that’s bullshit lol
---
If you take an amazing killer and put him against amazing survivors, they can’t be everywhere at once, so if the survivors ignore totems all together and just hit gens constantly and spread apart hitting them constantly, maximizing hook times to do them and playing efficiently. They will get all the gens easy, especially if they are good loopers 
---
Now noed comes in to play. 
---
If those same survivors did the extra objective of cleansing totems, sure, it would a more difficult time, but more balanced for a fun game that can go anywhere. The killer may get some more hooks and the survivors could also escape anyway. It just gives the killer a slight better chance overall... it’s not as bad as you say
---
It’s so easy to do... you literally do a gen or 99% it. Look around for a second and if there’s a totem, do it. Then pop the gen or go away.
---
They are so easy to find and you will still be fine as long as everyone does their part.  
---
It’s a well known complaint from many many people, killers AND survivors, that gens go a little too quick sometimes.. especially with swf
---
“It’s a buff to survivors” it’s a buff to this game???  It’s actually going to be fair. And how about when survivors have bad big and they’re bugging all over the map it looks like they have speed hacks? 
---
This game is soon going to feel like a GAME. Killers, stop looking for the easy way out. It’s not going to be that bad.
---
I know you can't give any details out about the rework at this point, but from what you've seen, would you say it feels more like source character than the current implementation? Or about the same?
---
After dedicated servers and other changes presumably cutting down on disconnects. Do you guys have plans to attack the wave of survivors and killers who purposely DC from a match? Such as temporary bans like 1 week-2 weeks for repeat offenders
---
It's all good man, I just think you're a hypocrite for feeling like you as a survivor can rush your opponent out of the match because you want to tunnel the objective, but think it's bullshit for your opponent to do the exact same to you and your team. I get you're frustrated, I don't like being tunneled either, but I'm not entitled enough to think that the killer should give my teammates a turn on the hook before they eliminate me. 
---
So yeah man do your thing, vent if you want, just try and be a little more self-aware of your entitlement, these kinds of double standards are pretty problematic IMO.

&gt; This game is soon going to feel like a GAME. Killers, stop looking for the easy way out. It’s not going to be that bad.
---
hoo boy I hope you feel the same way about SWF
---
I love how it’s a buff to not be hit when u shouldn’t be.
---
Why are you looking to switch out ruin? If you are looking for a non-hex perk to slow gen progression, Pop Goes The Weasel is fantastic for keeping up map pressure, especially in mid to late game if you have multiple gens in close proximity. Since the ruin buff, I’ve gotten so good at nailing great skill checks. Survivors are adapting to the new ruin changes and with how easily totems break, Pop Goes the Weasel is viable alternative. 
---
So for M&amp;A, I’m not sure how useful it is for spirit. Pros: wider FOV, allows you to get closer to generator for a sneak attack, makes nurse’s calling range better. Cons: more survivors will hear your phasing sound, which can really hurt the spirit if you are trying to stealth. I personally wouldn’t ruin M&amp;A on her, unless you were running it with prayer beads and/or nurse’s calling. 
---
Also, one tip that might seem super obvious but I didn’t realize until someone pointed it out: when sneaking up to a gen in phase mode, try to avoid the grass as much as possible. The rustling grass gives you away so easily. I’ve noticed I’ve started to get way more hits on gen ambushing after being more mindful of avoiding grass. 
---
Hope this wall of text helps. I’m no spirit expert, but I’ve played around with different perks on her enough!
---
Unless they would be able to balance around it, but I don't feel like it really allows for that.  So, yeah, you right.
---
Rework or buff Monsterous Shrine pls
---
Sorry but he isnt pain killers. he just posts new vids pain killer makes so we can be.. notified i guess?
---
Not gonna lie the top perk is very phallic lol.
---
Me too, I only just got really good perks for him and am in love with the Jumpscare Freddy build. I hope it's still possible
---
It's funny because it's a schadenfreudic event - the killer thinks he managed to bag one last kill just before Claudette escapes, to which the tides suddenly turn.
---
It might just be what they referred to in streams before where if there's one survivor left, the hatch, killer, survivor auras are all revealed to each other and the gates open.
---
Hopefully it's something more interesting.
---
I see...
---
My time has come.
---
I don't need evidence that you think it's ok to rush gens dude. It's all good man, I just think you're a bit of an entitled hypocrite for feeling like survivors can rush their opponent out of the match, but think it's bullshit for your opponent to do the exact same to you and your team. I get you're frustrated, I don't like being tunneled either, but I'm not entitled enough to think that the killer should give my teammates a turn on the hook before they eliminate me.
---
So yeah man do your thing, vent if you want, just try and be a little more self-aware, these kinds of double standards are pretty problematic to the game IMO.
---
When the killer closed the hatch the survivor had to make a full gen to open it up again. 
---
It didn't go too well.
---
Maybe it should be like Apex where one of the killers get to choose first and the second HAS to choose another killer, so there is no double of the same killer
---
Sounds interesting. What perks ?
---
Corrupt Intervention is pretty decent honestly. It's 120 seconds at rank 3, too. It has a large impact on the early game. It's not only that it prevents the survivors from doing those gens, it's how that predictably affects the behavior of the survivors at the start of the game. They will approach the gens they spawn near, discover they are blocked, and then creep around the edges of the map in search of other generators. On certain maps the fact that the survivors can't work on the generators that are easily located is itself a big factor.   
---
If you combine it with Ruin it slows the game down a LOT. The survivors don't even know you have Ruin until they find another generator to get started on, so instead of the clock ticking on them finding your totem as soon as the game starts, you get an extra minute. You're also far less likely to have games where the survivors spawn near your totem and destroy it right away, because they aren't looking for it yet.
---
I don't advocate for gen rushing. I don't support it. I try to do secondary objectives for extra points. I don't see my view point as a double standard because while I understand that this is a competition, I think everyone should get the chance to have fun. When I go down and the killer comes straight back to my hook the instant I get saved, then ignores the other person/people so that they can just get an easy kill... that sucks. Hard.
---
 Especially because I'm usually playing with my girlfriend. So now one of us has to wait for the match to end because the killer decided to play like an ass. You won't convince me otherwise. It's nothing more than a bad killer employing cheap tactics to try to eek out a 4k. Which isn't even a guarantee for rank ups anymore.
---
😬
---
sounds kinda funny of you to say that
---
That's exactly it. If you can hear the heartbeat, you cannot hear the windy noise.
---
Yeah?  What about them?
---
Thought you had to crouch
---
I would of figured the spirit with prayer beads before pig
---
You do not
---
i would like to run into this glitch
---
Hey, maybe he wouldn't be garbage if he had that at base.
---
It happened to me once too. Couldn't heal myself or do any gens. All I could do was run or hide.
---
Oh.
---
Lmao! Hag as Eddy is amazing!
---
When is next mid chapter supposed to be?
---
and the TR is 24 meters, right?
---
Honestly excited to see the devs communicating like this with their playerbase. Might be a little overdue, but it's better than never. Thumbs up.
---
They did say its something thats been requested since his launch so its likely not just the mixtape
---
I don't think many people appreciate this kind of open talk enough. I don't really care if it takes long for you guys at bhvr to do these things, but it has always baffled me when you simply hint at future things without addressing them. 
---
As for what i would like to know next is the over-all killer balance. Especially low tier killers like pig, trapper and leatherface are well known to perform poorly against good survivors. Are there any individual buffs to these killers that we can expect?
---
Also what is up with meddle of man? Why did you add a perk that punishes bad killers, some of which have no counterplay to this perk? Can we expect a change to this perk in near future, as it is clearly design limiting and not exactly good for the game's health.
---
that's a deal
---
I'm so happy to see that end game update. Hopefully it's good though.
---
When the p3 Claudette lifestyle chooses you
---
Just got Spirit a few weeks ago and have her to about level 40 and really enjoying playing her.  As a killer she is lots of fun due to her phasing mechanic which lets you learn and play a different type of style compared to other killers.
---
btw what other killer is in the photo it looks like hag or pig
---
NOED rewards bad players
---
Funny you should mention the streams because we're actually looked to bring those back along with some others, like Q&amp;As.
---
No longer shall we cry DARN in the streets!
---
Deny or agree, I said I wasn’t going to argue about it.   People are so whiney about Balance it drives me absolutely crazy.    So I load into a game of Overwatch, we’re not a clan, but the other team is, are we still talking about balance?  Or apex, 3 people are God’s against the other teams,   Nerf please?

Nice, Pill Bottle is great in general.

I will never forgive Cartoon Network for not releasing the full Ed, Edd n Eddy series on DVD. :(

No? It’s the legion in first person

I like Freddy as he stands no cap
---
Precisely, and Distressing would bump it up to roughly 30 metres.
---
Multiple Doctors would be pretty fun actually if they stand still pretending to be illusions
---
Your opinion is wrong
---
They changed the formula awhile back. They had it up in one of their streams. Instead of doing 1 stream a week with everything they just put out content specific streams now
---
Are we....becoming a battle royale game?
---
**The Entity is collapsing inwards in 2 minutes!**
---
I think the only person selfish is you. Because most people have agreed with the rank being pointless, including big DbD streamers. You gain nothing from rank minus the fact that you can get self pride from hitting rank 1. 
---
Everyone has damn near quit the game. Not for just the matchmaking alone. For the constant bugs, whether it’s the hit box staying the same since release, or others. The devs push out new content whether licensed or not to keep people hanging on. 
---
And your mentality of the whole breaking rank 10 did not in fact make me want to quit the game. You know  makes me want to quit this game, with over 4K hours? The lack of focus and committed from the devs. 🙄
---
"End game collapse"
---
Sounds like the Entity might take matters into it's own hands when the pesky survivors refuse to leave.
---
O hey dat me lol
---
I see. Thank you.
---
hag
---
Appreciate it. 
---
I forgot they changed the TR a long time ago so I’ve been running whispers and wondering why I’m not grabbing anybody.
---
The previous matchmaking system is okay despite of the long time it takes to get a match. When I load a game, I just quit the lobby if the ping is red and does not improve. I prefer just waiting longer instead of clicking buttons to join lobby check ping quit lobby then join again and repeat.
---
Thank you again.
---
Cheating scum
---
You can run bitch but you can't hide!
---
Just make killer able to close hatch for 30 seconds, this will be enough for killer to down survivor and won't be enough for killer to permanently deny survivor's escape, if killer is just spamming close hatch then it's better to go for a gen and bait the killer out, or you can just open exit this way. It's all about skill that way.
---
Freddy is excellent until end game. I feel like they could go in a direction that would make him bad. I need the dream world tracking. It taught me how to be a good killer on all killers.
---
Several minute mends.  Literally you could repair a gen start to finish faster than you can complete a single mend due to a gamebreaking bug with these addons being combined due to a recent update.  Literally creating unwinnable games for the opponent.
---
For each character, at lvl 30,35 and 40 you get to unlock their respective perks. Once unlocked they can be unlocked in other characters bloodwebs. Then you can use them in game :)
---
I've been eagerly waiting on a post like this as the timing felt right. It did not disappoint! Very excited to see these next changes!!
---
Orange perks aren't the "best perks," they're the teachable perks. Each character (killer &amp; survivor) has 3 perks that are exclusive to them until they're unlocked at levels 30, 35 &amp; 40, then they can appear in the bloodweb of any other character.
---
Great to see the devs communicating like this. With DBD being so far into its life cycle, keeping the game a live and well for years yet to come as the devs say they plan to absolutely needs open engagement and communication between the devs and community.
---
Looking forward to the coming months (and years) of DBD!
---
2019, and you still don't know that banning based on IP address does not work
---
And I get your point, but MY point is that the devs shouldn't be supported when the game's been broken for so long and in addition most of the cosmetics are lazily made.
---
Naw man, this is Exodia myers the forbidden one. It's not about being optimal, it's about striking fear into the hearts of the survivors.
---
This also happened to me on Xbox One on the first hook and, in a different game, on the last hook. I was in a random match for the first one and survive with your friends mode in the second.
---
Spirit
---
I expect this from console as it’s surprisingly easy to 360 / juke

Just accept the fact that our boy Q doesn't seem to have as many fans as you would think

Mclean said that "You shouldnt invest in tuning guides" + that Billy's charge-speed add-ons will get nerfed at some point

BEhavior Interactive, the devs behind DBD,  shortened into BHVR.
---
Oh yeah I forgot the laundry sheets chase was the scariest for me :s
---
It’s more than 100 trials from rank 13 to 1 I guess.
---
I always play solo queue and it’s so painful since I usually get 3 man games, survivors or killer DC, and game froze. So most of time I depip because of that.
---
No
---
with the basement :o
---
No Play with your food? As a Myers player I must ask, because I feel so slow without it when I do tombstone.
---
DEAR QUENTIN,
---
THE DOCTOR IS RUNNING DIRECTLY AT US. STOP FUCKING BODYBLOCKING ME IN THIS FUCKING CORNER BECAUSE YOU WANT TO FUCKING HEAL ME AND LET ME RUN AWAY.
---
INSTEAD, I GOT HOOKED DIRECTLY BECAUSE OF YOU, AND YOU WERE TOO DAMN FUCKING SCARED TO MOVE FIVE FEET FORWARD TO UNHOOK ME SO I WENT SECOND STAGE UNTIL DAVID RAN ACROSS THE GODDAMN MAP TO UNHOOK ME HIMSELF... THEN I GOT TUNNELED AND DEAD.
---
I WASN'T KILLED BY THE DOCTOR, I WAS KILLED BY FUCKING QUENTIN.
---
Survivors: Run me around for the entire game and I only land two hatchets
---
Me: Lol gg at least I got my daily
---
Same happened to me on PS4 with Ash
---
You don't even do that, Survivors get to bully Myers when they use Tombstone, let alone with Tuft of Hair on top of that. I mean, you can already bully every Killer except Nurse, so you can really just bully him more.
---
Are you guys actually going to fix totem spawns? They'r still as bad as they ever were.
---
And what about problematic structures like the Ironworks and Disturbed Ward? As a specific example, I just had a match at the Ward where two safe pallets spawned in one loop at the building just on the bottom floor. That's an issue that shouldn't be happening.
---
We're glad you like it. The feedback seems to be pretty good (so far) and we'd love to keep doing these going forward.
---
So many "it's about damn time" changes, but also a lot of interesting changes too. I'm interested what the "end game collapse" is going to entale. Maybe no more 8 hour hatch standoffs?
---
Ahh thanks, I couldn't find it in their update stuff. Also thank god, super fast chainsaw Billy is terrifying. Hope this doesn't hurt Bubba boi though.
---
I doubt the DBD devs are going to fix this, this situation is more like an "only you can prevent forest fires" kinda thing. 
---
Problem with camping hooks is that you are effectively giving the other survivors a free pass to hook up as many gens as the survivor has time on the hook. Because of this it is generally ill advised to camp hooks since sure, you'll get that kill almost 100%, but it will basically cost you the game. Because of this it is useful to leave the hook ASAP and look in its general direction basically all the time, while doing patrol routes for the generators. Once you've covered about half of the generators, return to the hook and rinse and repeat until the person dies or they are freed. If you find a survivor on the generator patrol, you ~~Smack a bitch~~ down the survivor and put them on the hook, and "add" them to your patrol route, if you're good enough at the game you should be able to mind games the survivors hard enough to predict their movements, and taking them out should be easy pickings once the first 2 survivors are hooked or dead.
---
If, and absolutely, when, a survivor is unhooked, don't worry, the process takes a long time and they are almost always lurking around the area they were unhooked, when an unhook occurs you walk back, study the area, if you cannot find them resume the generator/hook patrols, rinse and repeat until victory or loss.
---
The only time I've found camping the hook to be remotely viable is if it is close to at least 2 generators, then at that point it is less camping and more planting your ass on a pair of generators to force them to come to you. 
---
Then again I play myers so I can use stalk to spot people from halfway across the map, so my perspective may be bias.
---
yeah, playing Legion  itself, while kinda yikes is still acceptable.
---
using those add-ons until  they get fixed is basically exploiting and makes you human trash.
---
Hard not to complain sometimes, to be completely honest. But speaking of Rank 1, yeah, it should be reserved for good players. No idea how to achieve that though, too many variables in my opinion and the emblem system currently has some big problems that need to be repaired
---
Bless your soul. 
---
Good job.
---
600 boldness points, but I guess that is pretty small.
---
"Someone has to work their ass off 12 hours a day for their 4 kids and wife.", I beg to differ. Only a fool would do that and quite honestly a fool's a fool and that will never change. There's almost no job in the world that REQUIRES 12 hour shifts and doing overtime once in a while is okay, but there's no reason to do it on a regular basis. Shelves don't need to be stocked for 12 hours, truck drivers don't need to and aren't allowed to drive for 12 hours and so on.
---
And no I am not trolling. If you work your ass off for someone else, 12 hours a day, you're dumb.
---
Doesnt he have a command that links to a clip where he says it slowly?
---
If you're focused, preventing repetition of this sort really should be a main focus, and it's the focus of using a focused thesaurus. Stay focused, and focus on the grammar. Such synonyms for the word focused can work great, but it'll take focus to choose the right word.
---
^^^focus
---
Only reason I called him out is because I see him running bloodhound which means he knows about that exploit. 
---
If you’re gonna exploit one way, might as well do it every single way WITH an ebony mori. 
---
That’s where I draw the line of acceptable.
---
So close, yet so far
---
Barely anyone plays killer (execpt for me it seems). Ive joined countless parties on ps4 that wanted to do KYF yet no one wanted to play killer
---
Ok thank you for the reply
---
yeah, Instasaw-Billy is aids but Bubba does not need a nerf.
---
Also btw Iri-Heads are also in the queue for the chopping block, so wouldnt invest in those either
---
I'm not sure. Killers not being able to grab the survivor would be different and a lot of killers may not like that, but at the same time I haven't seen a lot of killers successfully do that so idk if it would really make a difference. I'm not opposed to that idea
---
They should just change it to amount of gens completed, with 4 gens done capping out at 100%, it would heavily decreased the shit saves.
---
[ACTIVATE WINDOWS]
---
Would be so nice if they did special matchmaking for people who insta quit vs certain killers.
---
1quit = 2 next FULL matches vs that killer. DCing again will just add more games to the queue.
---
Not going to lie, was expecting a transition to Skyrim when you ran in and the whole screen was white.
---
I've seen the token suggestion alot on the subreddit and the forums, but as stressful as NOED is, there's no need for a rework. Don't get me wrong, but it was changed atleast 3 times and now it can be deactivated at any moment.
---
Cursed!
---
What makes lf need it? I haven't heard anything about him needing to be touched up
---
He’s just so bad in his current state.
---
Would have had a whole lot more likes if it was a meme, but that takes way more motivation than I have.
---
... I always just saw the hatch as a last, merciful chance for the last Survivor to escape, since it seems unlikely to me a Survivor will simply finish the last gens and open an exit gate on his own.
---
Honestly, I do not see the possibility of the game dragging out because the last Surv tries to stealth the last gens as that much of an issue. An elongated hide-and-seek game seems at the very least more interesting than just two dudes standing in front of a hole until one either lose patience or fucks up trying to mind the other.
---
1% of human to dog intercourse will result in a pregnancy, and that 1% explains you. I would love to call you a dog but it would be a great insult to dogs, so nah.
---
there are no Freddy mains, change my mind.
---
Anybody going for memes deserves to be ended
---
Which it totally fine :D that's what we're here for
---
Leatherface isn't from a swamp wtf :c
---
I think Peanits is just a community manager. So you won't get a response asap.
---
Interesting. I like when addons change the game, but Iri-heads were on a whole other level. The problem with these addons is that they make the really good players unstoppable. Stuff like triple blink Nurse isn't that bad against most nurses, but it makes the game practically unlosable for a god-level Nurse player. InB4 BHVR only nerfs killers, I remember them talking about changing insta-heals as well. I like powerful items and addons, but there has to be some balance aimed at the high level players.
---
Their stream when leatherface was released, they announced that map was coming along with him.
---
We can only assume that’s his map. Might be why the cages are down there.
---
As a Freddy main, please dont rework him. Two small buffs is all he needs.
---
Thank you for the update!!! LOVING most of what I'm seeing and the communication! 
---
I'm admittedly a little worried about the idea of an endgame rework, though. While current endgame is pretty dull (race to the door, maybe get someone down while they tbag, hope when you hook them it draws their teammates back in) I don't want a rework to make it super hard on survivors. There's already a decent amount of hardcore endgame killer perks out there and I don't want survivors to finish all those gens just for it to be impossible to leave. Can you say anything to that, or will it be more of a 'wait and see' kind of situation? I ask as an equal killer/survivor main.
---
Alexa, how to delete someones post? -Me, probably
---
3-blink and 2-blink are the exact same if the Nurse is good, 3-blink just makes bad Nurses harder to deal with, Omegablink is way better on good Nurses
---
I'm guessing it's something that makes the legion look more like or disguise themselves as a regular survivor, as a pretty big part of this sub was asking for that.
---
Okay well I play mostly killer and most hex spawns are openly facing generators. This is a fact.
---
Please please please dont rework Freddy BHVR. He honestly isn't as bad as the community would have you believe. Two small buffs is all he needs to be a good killer: No action progress during the transition and longer base range.
---
Lol i did this with billy, it didnt last too long
---
only way the cry baby is getting a kill
---
Fantastic to hear about all of this, even knowing that we aren't learning much about the Legion change or Freddy rework yet, it's nice to know that we have confirmed dates to at-least learn about them.
---
Looking forward to the end-game collapse, the end game has felt broken for a long time, and I look forward to seeing what you'll do to fix it.
---
And I'm glad to know that legion changes are coming. Even though I enjoy them how they are now, I always feel guilty about it because I know what it's like to face.
---
My boy is getting reworked. I’m almost sad to see his underpowered meme tier ass go. But really I’m not.
---

---
&gt; The population of killer players on console has more to do with framerate issues and community than anything else.
---
lol not it's because of how prevalent SWF is. I get told constantly that SWF CANNOT BE TOUCHED because it's the only way the game survivors so you;r whole comment is horseshit
---
Hex: Null 
---
As long as this hex persists all survivors have 1/2/3 of their perks disabled, perks chosen disabled are chosen at random 
---
*”rob them of their tools, and finish them when they are at their most vulnerable.”*
---
*-Unknown* 
---
This was the first thing that came to mind, before anyone gets mad that It’s OP, it’s literally no more than a concept
---
Technically, a mechanic like that was requested far *before* the release of Legion, so I doubt they'll be doing that.
---
Not on legion
---
Hmm well i never care about rank so i've never looked to see if i'm missing pips BUT i have lost BP from a few games before. Basically i would turn my ps4 off after i get to the menu after a game and everything from the last few games would be gone, even bp and bloodweb progress. I've heard this happening to a lot of other people. Only happened to me twice because i've \*kinda\* found a way around it. What i do, after a game, open up a few things and close them. For example after the game, click store, back out, click swf, back out, click surv, etc. I do this to ENSURE it saves my progress. literally do it every time i play. If you're stuff just isn't autosaving i recommend doing this
---
Can't forget the Freddy Rework, too!
---
Thank you so much. I always looked forward to the dev streams and Q&amp;As each week, even when I wasn't actively playing the game. It became such a letdown when the were progressively replaced with mash ups, and play-with-the-devs, and then nothing at all.
---
Leatherface would be similar to Autohaven Wreckers, that one terrible variation of the map that's basically 2 huge areas connected by a slim bridge- it's like a dogbone. One half of the map would be the Award Winning Chili factory- the other half would be the Sawyer Mansion. And in the middle, connecting them is a forest.
---
ppl deranking from 1 to 15? that's some tinfoil shit imo
---
I just start setting up around closest Gen cluster and shack, otherwise my traps end up being too far apart to ever land on anyone.
---
While I'm optimistic about the rework, I don't want the to change too much of what he currently is
---
This is the worse it's ever been but it's also the most unbalanced the game has been since the beta.
---
Thats my petty "you dont get to scream" thing. I like screaming as a surv when hooked cause its immersive.
---
May your killers never find you and may your survivors be potatoes, friend.
---
what did you name your crow?
---
If it's one of the weaker killers I'm usually going to cleanse some totems and prepare for NOED. If the Spirit or Nurse takes NOED I'm going to be just a little bit salty.
---
it always fun to go against Michael for me :D
---
They are completely redoing his power, but Bricky said on his stream that super fans of ANOES are gonna love his rework, so it’s gonna be super lore based I guess.
---
A for effort
---
I love how "an update to the Legion" apparently reads "a completely new killer power".
---
I see more plagues than clowns. People really don't seem to care for clown
---
Thanks fog friend! 👍
---
May you escape from every Legion you encounter.
---
You're a real loser vegan_anakin
---
Don't waste your time. This is camper central over here.
---
Teachable perks unlock at level 30,35, and 40. Once unlocked there is a chance that they'll appear in a killer/survivor's bloodwebs eventually. If you don't want to level each k/s individually there is a chance that their teachable perks will show up in the Shrine of Secret so you can just buy it for shards.
---
The best ones vary depending on the playstyle you're going for and what perks really enhances a killer's strengths.
---
Yeah and he is the scariest! I bet not even the entity fucks with him.
---
The dailys don't force you to do anything. They give a little bonus, something extra. And you get the extra by doing something you usually wouldn't do. Thats the whole purpose of the dailys: Encouragin people to try something new. So why should they split them? That would defeat the whole reason why they are there in the first place. You could also just hand out 30k BP per day instead, because that wouldn't make a difference when the dailys would be split.
---
I've been playing since August 2018 (with a small break in December) I have 260 hours and only had 2 in total.
---
Jigsaw map. Even though it's my favourite xD
---
I run NOED as death insurance for the Survivors. Most of the time, I 4k before 2 gens are completed. Guess I'm just extra sadistic.
---
Im guessing it'll be some kind of timer. Once the gates are powered you have X amount of time before the trial 'collapses' and you die. No more holding the game hostage. 
---
How it'll effect that hatch i donno exactly
---
Why are you always on so many posts bitching about swf lol
---
Hex: Fear
---
2/3/4 survivors gain a terror radius once final generator has been activated. Terror radius intensifies when two survivors come within 6/12/18 meters of each other.
---
I actually hope the Legion update allows me to play them without making people mass DC and Block me on MLGA.
---
The worst kind of people IMO
---
You're kidding, right? It's piss easy to wake up, which is a major problem for Freddy.
---
Literally the reason I hate playing trapper. 
---
This infuriates me more than anything else in this game.
---
Hopefully they don't completely scrap everything about him.
---
Ruin? Are you joking?
---
I have to agree with noed because that's just bullshit but ruin? It's literally one totem you have to break...
---
what about a punishment for the "optimal" gameplay that forces people to dc?
---
Not to sound too sour, but we're yet to find out if any of this actually will have the promised in-game applications they they claim. 
---
Talk is cheap and BHVR is known for spewing rhetoric that doesn't match with their actions. 
---
Be cautiously optimistic before you're excited, is my advice.
---
Luckily she can see both sides of the chest at the same time
---
I find that corrupt intervention screws me over as survivor a decent amount of the time. I don't know where the killer spawned, so I often run to a generator only to find it's blocked. Sometimes I have to run to a third or even fourth generator to find one that isn't blocked, wasting time that would have been spent working gens otherwise. At the very least it will waste some survivor time as they move across the map toward the unblocked gens.
---
What does that have to do with whether or not it's a balance issue? No one screeches about the people who screech about NOED constantly.
---
My buddy was in a chat channel with me but not playing the game, super lucky that I turned right and the killer turned left. Hilariously after sitting in the corner for about two minutes I realized I was safe. For the time being.
---
It's already hard enough to get stacks for WGLF, the last thing the perk needs is a nerf.
---
I really like this kind of transparency. Makes me enjoy the game that much morr
---
We'll see when it comes out.
---
I fell in love with Freddy's insane tracking and game stall potential.  I hope they don't butcher that im favour for some chase power
---
&gt;Go suk some toes boy
---
I’m going to use this a lot more often now
---
Bunny girl Feng min please
---
maybe i will too
---
It's the phrase they're using to describe upcoming new endgame content, so like 1-2 gens or when all gens are finished, something new will happen.
---
This honestly sounds like it could be a fun event.
---
The stun noise from this monstrosity sounds like 10 cars crashing together once.
---
I know part of it is burnout but I just can't bring myself to play DbD more than enough to get my daily done, and then one game on the other side to get the EXP bonus. Really hoping these changes spark some life back into the game for me.
---
I'm not saying it's a bad idea. Legion's an amazing concept with a lazy killer power. I like that they can fast-vault, but the rest is a bit lame.
---
Hey, if you dc enough you can become a fog whisperer
---
But sprinting up to someone knowing full well they will go down again because the killer is chasing you is okay?
---
Shorthand in case you ever decide to do it.  Down and hook each survivor twice.  They farm saves and heals.  Make sure to use a combination of your killer ability as well as melee hits so you max Deviousness and Brutaliry categories.  Other than that it's pretty much entering and breaking chases with them.  Damaging the gen until you max break points.  Giving them each a few pallets on you and picking them up and dropping them to wiggle free.  They open gates, 1 gets hatch game over.
---
Why can’t I ever get my girl Feng min dailies? :/
---
entity is a furry
---
Nerf in title, autocorrect on phone!
---
Hell even if you just have eggs appear in blood webs and act like Presents from the Winter event would be sufficient even!
---
Thanks yeah, just wasn't sure, couldn't find any usage of that phrase other than this developer update lol.
---
No it is a 2018 meme
---
Even as a killer I hate this idea. I don't want the survivors to have a time presdure to leave. I want them to save their friends and aalow me to get a few more hooks (not necessarily kills)
---
I try to lead killer's AWAY from stuff going on. But every now and then I run into like a Claudette hiding in a corner and usually killer's break the chase with me and start chasing the immersed survivor because they know it'll be a easier chase lol
---
nothing. they've never touched camping.
---
There are other perks that grant bonus bps to a specific category such as Distressing, Beast of Prey, Thrill of the Hunt etc... also during the events special objectives add bp's.
---
If it's a base game perk, HOW THE HELL am I not going to use it?
---
*Thunder* "oh no."
---
*Bing BONG* "oH NO"
---
Someone replied to me about that on the top comment of this post.
---
It's already not that great of a perk for bloodpoint farming vs using BBQ and Chili. BBQ gives a great ability and 100% more bloodpoints, whereas WGLF requires you to either hurt yourself or unhook someone which can lead to some toxic situations. Honestly, it just needs to have some sort of positive bonus to go along with it to make it a decent perk altogether.
---
It only affects the pip not bloodpoints. I don’t know the specifics but pipping is bad imo.
---
We need a Dwight popping out of the Locker saying "Life has many doors, Jake-boy!"
---
I'm not entirely sure but I think that the back/select/button in the middle with 2 squares instantly changes your inverted setting
---
If it's a hatch rework I'm all for it. I'm so tired of being one hook away from a 4k only to lose the last person who did nothing all match. Not to mention hatch standoffs are so fucking annoying, and if I had a dollar for every time I watched the other survivor wait for me to die while clearly standing over the hatch I'd be rich. I just don't want to add 10 hoops for survivors to jump through to get out of the match.
---
You're kidding even more, right? Freddy is the basic 115% killer movement speed. He isn't any faster than Trapper. And you do realize how Freddy's power works, right? He has his aura-reading.
---
Rank 11, tbf I just started playing survivor like a little less than 2 weeks ago after being killer-only for the longest time but have only played against 2 huntresses and 1 nurse in that time frame, and only 1 huntress out of those 3 was above rank 18
---
Yeah. They're too used to being able to bully Freddy. I can't wait for the "Freddy OP, plz nerf!!!!!!1!!!1!" posts after Freddy gets buffed. Either that, or people complaining that BHVR promised they'd completely rework him but they didn't.
---
No imo, I’d rather somthing new/different. Maybe a hidden switch/breaker to allow the power to the exit gates. Invisible to both killers  and survivors and only appears when the hatch spawns?
---
Gideon's is terrible for killers. It's insanely hard to patrol and it spawns a lot of safe pallets and the hook spawns are terrible. Trapper only has a couple decent trap spots if you play that killer. The only killers who can really do well there are Freddy and Doctor
---
Maybe... but I am scared it will take so long to get into an actual game now... I see me dodging the first 7 matches because of bad ping, then finally finding a good match, but 1 player doesn't load in and I need to repeat to process. I can see it taking up about 20 minutes to finally get into a game that goes trough
---
Hilariously enough trapper is my second most played killer behind Huntress. Some games I catch six people with one trap in one windowsill that nobody realizes is unsafe, other times I place my third trap and the second gen pops and I haven't even SEEN a survivor. XD
---
absolutely fucking not.
---
we waste a perk slot just to get points, we should get a stack regardless, it's not fucking ludicrously over powered like BBQ and chilli where there's literally no reason to not take it.
---
&gt;Infinite Loading Screen 
---
&gt;This bug prevents players from loading into a game.
---
It can also occur when trying to join a lobby, among other instances. I hope they are at least aware of that. I'm not sure why this is a complex issue, seeing as how it's not a thing in other multiplayer games that I'd know, but then again, I do not know much about the code at work for such things.
---
&gt;Less than 5 players games
---
&gt;Starting with the next mid-chapter update, if this situation is detected, players will be returned to the tally screen
---
Great stuff.
---
&gt;Matchmaking
---
Matchmaking had never really been an issue, with the old system - as its current state, using the old system, again demonstrates. Why are they messing around with it to begin with?
---
The only matchmaking change I would like to see is having a preferential pairing of players with similar playtime and/or survival/sacrifice rate, on a best-possible-match basis.
---
&gt;made some changes to the emblem system to have a player's rank more accurately reflect their skill level
---
I depipped for 5-gen chases. Enough said. If they want to have rank actually correlate with skill, the best possible way that I see is to tie it to survival/sacrifice rate, rating players based on the overall result of the matches they are in (number of escapes), and perhaps weighing those ratings in the context of an MMR system.
---
&gt;Legion Update
---
Excited, but cautiously so. They released Legion in the first place, apparently without seeing the fundamental flaws within their design, so my confidence that they will manage to adjust them in a way that actually yields interactive and engaging, actual gameplay, is limited.
---
&gt;Migrating to Dedicated Servers is a process that will roll out over time
---
Does that mean the dedicated server architecture will not necessarily be in place globally by summertime, and could take a lot longer to get there?
---
&gt;End Game Collapse
---
Intriguing...
---
Not holding my breath.
---
Nice that they've finally updated us on what is going on, yet it still would have been nice to also have some actual updates to the game (Mend-stacking fix, Mettle Of Man fixes, cosmetics - aren't these for example some small things they could have easily put into that pip hotpatch?).
---
I want a perk for the killer that makes a fake hatch door and If the survivor jumps in sends them straight to there death or a hook
---
plz share your tag just to be clear who not to rescue unless its clear..
---
I’ve had this problem, don’t worry! You are pressing the Select button. I did it a few times and about screamed in agony as I was gutted as I stared at the ground while running.
---
Where is this comming from, how am I being dishonest, please, tell me.
---
I’d say deliverance because DS is DS
---
What kind of weenie acts socially inept then plays victim.
---
Meme time moves faster than normal time. 2018 is ancient times as of now.
---
Quickly, we only have a few months!
---
Just a close shave that I found mildly amusing and felt like sharing.
---
Exactly, so you can't get away. he's faster than you, can easily get you in dream state, and he can pretty much see you all the time in dream state. I'm seeing no faults in this character yet. How exactly is he underpowered? In any other game he would be considered broken.
---
I don’t think the perk itself is overpowered, I think the perk on killers who can practically instantly close the gap is a little too strong. Quickest snowballs in the west. Well, you know what I mean.
---
I usually disconnect as killer if it loads 3v1.
---
Legion isn't OP, he's just a cancer. He is antifun. Hopefully he's gutted and I never have to see one again.
---
Isn't not\_queen the community manager?
---
Sadly, this is true.
---
Entity blocks parts of the map ... Dbd battleroyale
---
That’s why my sensitivity is highest, always funny to see people try to juke assuming I’ll try to autoaim lunge them and miss
---
10/10 ed edd n eddy refrence 😂
---
This is the first time I've not been forced into rank 1 as killer. I've never felt like I should actually hit rank 1, as there are some survivors that I know I'll never stand a chance against, yet I'm forced to face them because we're the same rank. The pipping changes have spread the player-base out better so that now the survivors above my skill level are actually above my rank too. As long as killers like Tru3talent are able to consistently hit rank 1, it's clearly not impossible, just rightfully more difficult.
---
I agree that the pipping seems counter-intuitive, how a game that's too easy results in a safety or even black-pip, and I don't think the system's perfect. But it seems to be definitely improving the results.
---
I bought one for my friend who streams. If anyone asks where she got it I’ll send them your way. 👍
---
Try both and see which one you like more
---
Really looking forward to this! I am assuming the End Game Collapse and Freddy's rework will tie in together somehow, since Freddy's endgame is his best quality.
---
I remember a few months ago I inadvertently had a small farming session with a Survivor who helped me out, whether they know it or not. I was trying to get my Ritual for 4 traps as Trapper, who I kind of suck as (I prefer my girl the Huntress) and I was on Lampkin Lane. This Claudette and Laurie were obviously a pair and they just kept waving and teabagging at me, not really playing the game, so after hooking each twice I would mostly just injure or down them so they could run/crawl away, right? Well eventually I get the idea to place down a bear trap, hoping one will get the point and step in it for me to get my last trap and those sweet BPs. They just keep trying to disarm it, so I smack them and eventually leave to chase the other two Survivors around. After Dwight's third hook, I see that one of them stepped in my trap, and I kept note of the name. It was the Laurie, so I was willing to just let her live and take as many of the others as I could. I got them all, and then the Laurie kept trying to get me to follow her. She was leading me to pallets she threw down so I could break them, and long story short we went through all the pallets, all the stuns, all the gens, and I let her take an item from a chest and get the hatch. I sent a friend request after with a grateful message, but they never accepted or answered :( But it was a fun time all around; I do wish there were more socially recognizable ways to communicate as Killer but at the same time I don't try to farm in the first place so it doesn't mean much to me other than to be a meme. I tried to help out a Huntress who was doing poorly against a really good team by leading her to gens in progress and dropped pallets, but she eventually just got sick of it and hooked me too many times. I felt bad; the other Survivors gen rushed her so hard that my cold Killer heart hurt at the sight of it.
---
He's faster than you, but not faster than the basic killer speed. Just loop him into oblivion and he literally can't do anything about it besides bloodlust you. Several meta perks wake you up, *being hooked* wakes you up, failing a single skillcheck besides sabo skillchecks wake you up, it takes several seconds to put you to sleep (which you can cancel before it even finishes just by failing a skillcheck), Freddy cannot stop doors, totems, heals (you can just run up to a just downed survivor and start healing them, and Freddy literally cannot stop you until the dream transition is over), gens, etc. being popped in his face during the dream transition, he has nothing for the chase outside of bloodlust and his dream transition flickering (and the game gives him absolutely 0 indication of exactly when he's flickering or not), you can hit people just as the dream transition ends and Freddy will go into the successful hit cooldown animation while the survivor runs off with no health state change), awake survivors can literally cheese the game by going near an asleep survivor and forcing the auto-aim to swipe into them for a 100% safe bodyblock…. I can go on and on. Freddy's weak as piss right now.
---
2 killers?
---
As you can see on the screenshot. 2 of them 3 of us.
---
I’m just gonna r/whoosh myself OP
---
Agreed
---
I got plenty more screenshots, after i close the game.
---
You can never stop people from doing things just to piss other people off. Its the nature of multiplayer games. There's already a reward for playing full games its Blood Points. Theyre working on whatever broke matchmaking to allow the disparity in ranks. D/Cing because of the pip system is pretty stupid its never going to gain you a pip. Staying could save a pip or get you one.
---
The DBD Discord got mad at me because I said Freddy is bad, :c
---
now a rework is comin'
---
Well the thing is OP there’s only one killer and 3 survivors and 1 is in the dying state the other one got caught in a locker and the other one is running free. I don’t see how there are “two killers”
---
Laying in the grass
---
I like legion (as survivor or killer)
---
... people just don’t seem to adapt and have the wrong mindset about them
---
This happened to me and I glitched out of a window when I finally could heal someone
---
Gassy boi is tired of your shit screw the pallets, that gut gives him full protection
---
The only reason no one likes legion is because Moris and franks mixtapes are annoying to go against. All you’re doing is complaining anyways :)
---

I'm sorry to break it to you dude, but freddy is the worst killer in the game. The rework will make him stronger because right now survivors can shit on him.
---
Maybe this is all high level stuff (which doesn't sound remotely plausible) but I don't understand what's stopping the Freddy from tunneling each survivor because he's so fast he can nab at least two before two gens are done. He is strong. Just because he doesn't rack up easy 4ks for you higher level people doesn't mean that nobody else should have a chance cause you're bored of him.
---
You can't be a real Freddy main. This must be a dream.
---
I have a few ideas. 
---
1) On the Bloodweb, have each node show how many of that item/offering/add-on you have in your inventory so you can stock on what you need without returning to the Loadout screen. 
---
2) I would also like to see more rituals. A killer and a survivor ritual is a great idea. I too would love tougher rituals with greater rewards, even if they’re given weekly. 
---
3) With so many perks now, I think the Shrine should offer 3 survivor and 3 killer perks now to help in the grind. 
---
4) I’m on PS4 so can’t speak for other platforms, but I’d love to be able to rotate the character model from the Customize menu, without needing to go to the Store page to see a 360 of how a particular cosmetic combo looks. 
---
5) With Ash and even Plague having voicelines, I’d love to see the other survivors get some as well. Killers are a bit more difficult and maybe should remain silent but I’m still curious about the idea.
---
Can you not see it literally in the top left of the screen...
---
Oof nope that’s why I r/whoosh myself. Thank you!
---
As a console player I entirely agree with this. It’s really disheartening to have to wait for 30 minutes to find a game that just plays out awfully or find a killer on McDonald’s internet. Matchmaking needs to be functional, or lots of console players just wont stick with it because of the wait times just to possibly play the game.
---
Doesnt that just make you hate the game more? Especially if you play any killer who has to M1 now but mettle of man exists.
---
I would love to have simple phrases for the survivors to say when hit and during waiting periods. Would be fun. Also love the idea of seeing how many of an offering you have.
---
Yes, servers will solve the problem, but this will still be months, and no they openly said they don't punish it because they fear they could ban people that have real laggs and don't want to risk it
---
Well these are all the things I want
---
There is no difference between the ability to open the lock. Both will open the hatch &amp; be consumed on use.
---
The only difference is that the skeleton key is much more effective when using the key add-ons. It can last 30 seconds at base when using an add-on whereas the dull key can only last 5 seconds.
---
Does this video sound like it was dropped into a plane between reality and fiction to anyone else or is my computer just fucked
---
that was so lame
---
Now this is good communication!
---
if they make him even more unfun to play again I'm dc'ing every game lmao
---
I mean this honestly just seems necessary. Haven't had it happen in a long time, but it's the worst when a survivor hijacks a game by hiding forever without attempting to leave.
---
But I bring borrowed time and it work 75% of the time
---
Its a nice theory but people have been saying rank doesn't matter for months and months. Before this change it was that it was easy to get to red ranks and now its too hard. People still DCed then and they do now.   
---
Fact is their has been a killer released who has been vastly hated, their have been multiple game breaking bugs that have taken the devs ages to fix and some they haven't fixed and on top of all this multiple times the queue system seems to break making it take 5-20 minutes for a game. I think people are just fed up and with no punishment for DCing they are leaving more games that they might of put up with.   
---
I agree a reward would be nice, especially for devotion level as it seems so pointless, and reaching red rank should mean something but it doesn't other than difficult games. I do think a punishment would help but the game is so dodgy it is not always a rage quit and that will annoy people more if they get bans for the game crashing on them.   
---
The end of the day it is a horror game where you have no clue who the other player is your playing against. That anonymity makes it easy for people to say horrible things, be an ass in game and DC from games without a care fro the affect it has on teammates or the opposing team. It is also barely balanced and the slightest thing like a 3-man survivor team, SWF or killer with best add-ons and an ebony can throw it totally out of wack. This all adds up to people having no empathy and feeling angry or fed up so they will just DC.
---
&gt; Matchmaking had never really been an issue, with the old system - as its current state, using the old system, again demonstrates
---
We have fundamentally different experiences with this games matchmaking then. The current state is atrocious for PS4 players.
---
Haddonfield is at least 1000% worse.
---
NOED, remember me, bloodwarden
---
Calling ppl cry babies only to be one urself makes u look ridiculous. Also I don't see the point in this post considering u don't even know what they are changing. Not only that but I'm sure u have complained about something in the past whether it be survivor or killer related.
---
A bunch of the Fred mains be scared that he's gonna be ruined, but look at it this way:

Us Fred players agree that his power is pretty cool. We have differing opinions on how strong it is, but we think it's pretty cool. They haven't made a power for Freddy that's not cool yet, so 100% of the powers they've given Freddy are cool. Statistically, it's almost guaranteed his rework is gonna be cool.
---
Checkmate atheists.
---
just imagine the chaos it would be so much fun
---
Just buy the knockoff version in the cosmetic store.
---
hell yeah THICC
---
(Heavy breathing **I N T E N S I F I E S**)
---
I changed my name and I didn’t lose any progress. So I think you’re good.
---
No clue anymore. We just know it's a full rework of his power. They've mentioned ideas on stream and in forums, but that was so long ago that we have no clue anymore. Guess we'll have to wait till next month to find out.
---
It isn't an all in one patch... these are things all coming short and midterm.
---
But yes all great things to come :)
---
On one hand I agree with this tierlist for like 80% of the most part but.
---
Spies from the Shadows and Dying Light on the same tier as Brutal Strength and Bloodwarden? Bloodwarden is situational yes and deserves mid-tier, same with Brutal Strength being a small boost constantly deserving mid-tier but.
---
Spies from the Shadows after it got nerfed into the ground to be in a terrible state and Dying Light is so supportive of a terrible strategy that these aren't even usable. I can use stuff from the low tier way more reliably than those two and they're higher? Huh?
---
I mean it’s one of the best if not the best tracking perk in the game... one of the most important things to do in a match is know where all survivors are at and it does a pretty darn good job
---
You know the only purple addon for medkit is the Insta heal? Right?
---
Is this a power that can be taught?
---
Before hitting the comments, as i read the comic i even mentally heard all the sound effects EEnE does lol.
---
Dude I've used this perk a lot and it's definitely harder than it should be to get stacks, especially since you have to share unhooks with your teammates. Pallet saves/flashlight saves are a rarity and usually trying to get flashlight save wastes a lot of time and doesn't always work since the killer can just face a wall. You have to be fairly lucky to even get a flashlight save nowadays. I know I can get stacks by bodyblocking a killer while they are carrying someone but that's basically just as bad as "farming" someone because then you either waste a ton of time having to heal up afterwards or you end up being chased by the killer while already injured. Taking hits like that which could turn out to be detrimental to escaping shouldn't be rewarded, unless of course the survivor wiggles off as a result of the body block.
---
I honestly would prefer if they added more options for getting stacks such as healing someone a healthstate, finishing a gen etc. Adding more options to gain stacks would also indirectly discourage survivors from "farming" each other on the hook or putting the team at a disadvantage by giving the killer free hits. It would also be nice if they added a secondary effect to the perk to actually make it useful outside of the extra bloodpoints. Like how BBQ &amp; Chili is both a bloodpoint perk and a really strong aura reading perk.
---
All the nurses I've faced are straight garbage. Most hill billys are strong, and the wraith is definitely too fast. I get what you're saying, but you have to see where I'm coming from. I've never seen a Freddy lose a match. If nurse is good at high rank and shit at low rank, but freddy is like almost the best at low rank and dog shit at high rank, then there is something wrong with the way killers are made that there is such a dynamic skill gap between ranks. He needs a rework, but definitely nothing that will make him stronger for low ranks or they'll be stuck there forever.
---
I mean just use your eyes and ears. It's really easy.
---
My point is it's not a make or break perk. Everyone thinks I'm calling OP, I'm not. I'm saying it's not essential.
---
It only effects the chaser emblem after every trial you can over it and it will give you a break down, “hook proximity” is what you’re looking for, but it’s really nothing to worry about, just play how you feel comfortable.
---
how are people doing this i really wanna troll some friends in a kyf
---
Looking forward to start playing freddy
---
Its not just streamers, anyone that gets bored of going against rank 1 billy and nurse can derank for easier matches with more variety and shorter queue times, and killers tired of constant swf and good looping can derank to get survivors without brains. It isn't just streamers, I just posted examples I found from searching "derank."
---
Then I must be getting put with smurfs because no one on console likes playing against Freddy. He's too strong and no one wins against him.
---
The optimal Legion build.
---
The most fun Legion build.
---
The most OP Legion build.
---
The only Legion build.
---
Yeah, I suppose some players are like that, but also BHVR ranking system is boosted, there's rank 1 players who suck but only got there through playing a lot, and then there's players who take break and go all the way back to rank 20, that happened to my killer rank, and yeah when survivors are bad and immature, they'll DC when playing against players with better skills.
---
But honestly, many players complain at some pretty big name streamers, cuz they good at the game and they're not and then they go to their chats and call them names and then get shook when the streamer calls them dumbasses, as if the streamer should be kissing the audience ass XD.
---
Heck even FunGoose has gotten shit thrown at him and he is the kindest and most interactive streamer in DBD community? This is why I can't take seriously ppl complaining about deranking.
---
you mean ranchor
---
And legion would get another hit in regardless of whether or not you have mettle of man.
---
Nah i mean ranch sauce

---
What? Survivor queues are literally instant since you join into killers lobby, the killer has to wait for survivors for ages... at least that's what happenes in red ranks. When tru3 out all people goes deranking so he can get games at all, then you know it's really bad.
---
&gt;just go for the escape you earned
---
What hurts is when they don't earn it and it's a survivor that just hid in a locker most of the game, yet has the audacity to tbag and say ggez at the end.
---
do us all a favour and skip it. legion is fucking boring.
---
i hope they are not just removing things from legion without buff because he sucks without mixtape and bleedout timer
---
How about no?
---
You don't lose all those points when the survivor disconnects you brainlet, it just adds on the 625 after.
---
if you disconnect at the beginning the killer gets an ez 3 v 1, even then it is usually after getting downed and hooked you brianlet. 
---
You are only hurting yourself and your fellow team when you disconnect. Get rekt salty boi.
---
Big faxxxx
---
They don't punish the people whiners who come to reddit and the forums and complain with no evidence.  Any personal ticket that is submitted with proper evidence will have action taken on it as needed as long as it's a blatant example of cheating and not something that could reasonably be a connection hiccup.
---
They just won't put heads on spikes and parade punishments to the public which people cry for.  
---
Just watch, the next ban wave they do will see a surge of people posting on the various locations about how it isn't fair they got punished. And this includes the rampant d/cers who cross the threshhold (which is a bit too generous I'll grant you that).
---
then shut the fuck up when people don’t want to play against it.
---
Ouch. I guess the only good thing is that atleast you have tracking for achievements?
---
I got this game when it first came out but started playing it last year summer time. I have been loving it ever since and have all of the DLC’s except for Freddy’s because I found out then that he is arguably the weakest killer. I originally, like alot of people, was super hyped when finding out he’d be in the game but here we are. Couldn’t wait until the rework, and still can’t.
---
As far as Legion, I didn’t even bother getting him as no one likes playing against him and is super annoying, and you guys know the rest. This would have to be a big update/rework for me to even consider getting him as I just have respect for the game and don’t want to deal with dc’s.
---
Appreciate it. Some people just need to troll lmao
---
Seeing that Claudette hiding behind a wall 50 meters away isn’t as easy as advertised. Bbq won’t completely solve that but it certainly helps
---
You know what, maybe I'll use double blades, franks mixtape, cold dirt, a mori, and noed. Will that make it more exciting?
---
I just wanna know why his lunge seems to go half the damn map
---
No one plays nurse on console and when they do they never get anything more than a 2k. Looping is difficult. Freddy is spectacular. This game is totally different from what people describe on this forum. Everyone on console thinks that most of the killers are too strong and need to be slowed down. I hate when devs dont do separate balancing. It's so lazy.
---
Survivor main. I played nurse for the daily, but this was not fun considering the odds lol all good tho got it done (chase for 3 minutes)
---
hope you reported him for communication abuse.
---
In the grass, just south of the gen aura?
---
At this point it's not even funny. Two days in a row my first survivor match was against this type of killer. I just switched to killer for the rest of the session both times.
---
Just as a side note it DOESN'T counter Nurse. Her blink lunges DO NOT give you MoM tokens.
---
Well boo hoo, it’s a video game. If it makes you that upset you shouldn’t be playing.
---
except it’s not the whole video game? lmao you seem like a legion player tbh
---
Yeeeeeeeeessssss! Freddy is my main killer now and he will better in this update
---
A Week ban will *never* happen. That's how you lose player base. Waiting 5 seconds before joining a new lobby is way too long when I have to continually leave 300+ ping lobbies. Rewards work.
---
Lets be honest there's not much difference between 18 and 12.
---
just a heads up you posted this 3 times
---
* Reposts within the last 60 days are not permitted.
---
Oops sorry
---
I do eat alot of pizza
---
Is it you can change it how ever many times you want or do you have to pay after the first time
---
i don't disagree with this, To be fair a lot of what you said is what i was getting at, but i do think the rise of D/cs in the last 2 months has more to do with ppl being unhappy with the game and less about deranking or why they d/cd before . i just think that making rank harder just made things worse. kinda like the straw that broke a lot of camels backs
---
no worries :)
---
Lmao the name. Yeah you are biased at all.
---
Thanks for the heads up :3
---
“Has Suzy — IS THAT THE SUPPORT BEAM FROM THE BASEMENT?!”
---
“What’s a support beam?”
---
“This has been quite a match.”
---
Pay after the first time.
---
I see it as the trial slowly fragmenting and falling apart, collapsing, if you will.

Mate, it's not possible to find this unintentionally. Shame that you don't share it, you are doing it just for the views on youtube or whatever.

Here is the full guide, it works well :) It's fun do it once, its gets boring later.

Pay after the first time sadly ;-;
---
 $5.00 if you have ps plus, if not $10.00.
---
Damn that sucks
---
Killers should get a KWF mode, I mean I want to play with my buddies too...
---
Spirit is by far the strongest killer of the group.  She's got good perks too but she takes work to learn to play.  As long as you're good with that I'd consider her.  Plague would be my second choice.  Her power is interesting and she's no worse than mid tier.  Legion is trash and will only rack up DC's and Clown has potential but isn't amazing with little map pressure.
---
Yeah, I think his forum is 90% PC players and it's fairly agreed upon that actually survivors are too strong and they dictate the pace of the match. Any killer buff is usually welcomed, since the game is very relaxing to play as Survivor but extremely frustrating as Killer.
---
Have you thought about buying a special mouse and keyboard set for console? I heard you can get adapters for that, which increases the range of motion and accuracy of gameplay (two aspects which make the Nurse the best killer by faaaaaaaaaar).
---
Ultimately, I don't know if the devs can do separate balancing - it took them several years to get to this stage, and even now the game (PC experience, which is the common experience) is survivor-sided. Idk if they have the manpower to do that yet. Maybe in the future.
---
$5 - $10 dollars that’s a bloody rip off
---
No mither does that.
---
I looked at the killer perks nothing that says anything about one survivor spawning in injured and not being able to heal. I think it's a bug, I was using David when I was going against the Plague and she puked on me three times which made me not able to heal. What I think happened is it carried on through to my other games. Mind you I played 2 other games (against different killers with different perks) and still had this..
---
More like Freddy mains go away.... This just makes me scared for the "rework". I don't want them to scrap every single thing about Freddy's power. He just needs some buffs and that's all.
---
Freddy isn't coming with the update, they literally said "we are focusing on more important things."
---
For real?
---
you've been really busy and helpful all throughout this thread and i just wanted to say we appreciate you!
---
They said they still have a lot of work to do on Freddy. They will share some details next month. The rework is still months away most likely. Wouldn't get your hopes up
---
I do dislike that part of Freddy, and no action progress on the transition is one of the buffs I want, however all of his strengths outweigh that for me.
---
Didn't say it wasn't
---
Rebuild your database first. If it doesn't work after that, you'll probably have to download the game again.
---
Lack of Polish? Indeed, this game is in English! /s
---
y'all are so fucking ungrateful lmfao
---
How do I do that?
---
Fair enough
---
I would suggest watching some console streamers/youtubers play the game. They will be able you give you much better advice than I.
---
You’re a brave soul for doing this here’s to smurf account time
---
Turn off your PS4. Hold down the power button until after you hear a second beep. A menu will pop up, select Rebuild Database. Follow the prompts. It's basically a defrag for your file system.
---
Sorry, I'm not very good with words since English isn't my native language, what I'm trying to say, let them derank, cuz I don't think ppl who do that are really skilled at all, I don't feel the game is suffering much with this, heck if a killer is sweaty against me, let them be, it's just a game and those players actions won't make me hate my time with this game since it's something I do enjoy.
---
No matter what, it is actually impossible to outrun freddy on console. As soon as his window to attack is open it's game over for you.
---
Wait... Banned him again recently? I just saw the two year old I got banned video on YouTube...
---
Hopefully they don't Freddy Legion. I don't want another reason to complain about him and I definitely don't want a repeat of waiting a whole year for a rework.
---
Hopefully they found a less obnoxious way to keep his fast pace game-play.
---
Well no, it shouldn't be allowed unless there's video or picture evidence. Like in my case, there's picture proof for the communication abuse.
---
Oh, I did.
---
Yeah, this sounds like the most fun/interesting possibility.
---
I don't trust it. I'm very uncomfortable with this recent revelation. They've lost my trust with how long it's taken to even get to this point and saying Freddy's going to be the next killer helped and then some other killer is helped first, and this isn't gaining them any brownie points with me.
---
I don't trust it. I'm afraid this is going to be a complete scrapping of his power, and I'm not for that.
---
Yeah... I get that. You want to be looping Freddy, not running away from him, since there is nothing he can do to stop loops, but if looping is hard on console then there is an issue. Maybe speak to a dev about separate balancing for platforms.
---
I’m even more excited for the Endgame. Like what could it be? A new obstacle or element? Which side will it favor? Either way hopefully it’s a breath of fresh air.
---
Freddy main here, I'm also nervous about them butchering freddy
---
Memes aren't enjoyable. Instead I find what discussions I can inside of the endless shitposts that plague this subreddit. I try to be the change I want to see
---
Michel ain’t putting up with your shit
---
I would argue against adrenaline and dead hard. Dead hard is something you actually need to time to make the killer miss or you can use it to get another loop out of something. But you actually have to do something. Adrenaline is again a reward for doing all the gens. Where NOED is a reward for letting them do all the gens. I do think adrenaline is a bit strong. Like either heal one health state or sprint not both. Metal of man is a bit bullshit ill give you that. Decisive strike is fine since the rework imo.  I just dont like NOED because it rewards killers for losing. It shouldn't get to that point because you shouldn't let them get 5 gens.
---
Game ment to be played solo, so wouldn't call them trash lol
---
Pick a good name and you won’t have a problem
---
You mean crutch?
---
Hate it when folk DC when I get a hit like that
---
When someone who has all the pressure on them saves the team or something like that. Like when one surviver is left and he opens the gates and comes back for everyone and saves them. That would be clutch.
---
I agree, and didn't take into account people taking long breaks. It is clearly not an easy task to implement a fair, balanced ranking system.
---
Nah, not crutch.
---
