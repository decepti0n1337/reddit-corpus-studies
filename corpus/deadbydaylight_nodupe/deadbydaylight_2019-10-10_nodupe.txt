that moment when everyone upvotes an insult lol... the one who got this reply is hated
---
---
---
Yes, but how often did people exactly run Terror Radius builds on Freddy compared to how often you see Borrowed Time being ran?
---
I don't advocate playing like this all the time, but when in Haddonfield, do as the survivors do. Nothing good comes from playing like this towards people that don't play like that first. It just needlessly brings everyone's fucking mood down. But it also is really fun every once in a while when the survivors make it clear that it's really okay to just sweat this match. Especially because the types of players confident enough to play like this never expect you to be able to answer it just as well in turn, so you can get a big momentum swing early and snowball them.
---
I see more toxic neas than Claudette‚Äôs, but maybe that‚Äôs just me.
---
I did amd im disappointed how easy itnis as survivor...run forever and not slow down? Might as well give me starman, it's kind of forgiving
---
But.....the whole purpose of the game is grind
---
Butt dance and flashlight spam
---
thanks, i've had this idea for a while now but only just managed to put it into a post now
---
sooo, just a Wraith without Cloak?
---
This battle pass will give me a reason to play. I don't buy cosmetics from the shop so this will give me the ability to earn them as I play and complete challenges. I plan on completing the rift every single time so this will only cost me the intial $10, an absolute steal.
---

---
I think the major draw is that this should ease up the toxicity a bit. Why be a sore loser if you don't escape/get a 4k when you have completed the challenge you were going for?
---
The cosmetic for Mike? It is real.
---
I see now
---
&gt; Tier progress between the two will remain consistent for all players, so if a tier is reached on the FREE track and The Rift Pass and is later unlocked, players will also earn every PREMIUM reward from previous tiers, retroactively as well.

---
Mmm, nah, her hair is the most redeeming quality
---
Thats what i meant, no objectives just survive and hide. And the survivors can have all the hiding spaces they want
---
I wasn't cherry picking anything. I simply pointed out how waking up isn't a counter to this. BT was great against all camping killers, but now it's literally a waste of a slot against Freddy, if he decides to camp. I get it, do gens and leave, but that one guy still gets his game ruined. Actually, its ruined for everyone. It's not very fun to just crank out gens then head out.
---
just stating a fact.
---
I would fuck him.
---
And shirtless Frank ;)
---
One time I played Leatherface on Grim Pantry and this Laurie decided to try and loop me around the barrels on the dock... right in front of a hooked teammate. Literally like two feet in front of her. Got called a camper by her teammate and I was just like ‚Äú????? Your anger is not placed on the right person here lol.‚Äù
---
It'd be toxic even if you were a killer saying "why is it toxic to be better". It's just a cringe thing to say bruh.
---
Sure buddy
---
Is it aysm? I can‚Äôt find anything on it?
---
So basically what Hide or Die was lol
---
I don't think you can sabotage gens in that way as wraith, that and the whole sabotage thing can be affected drastically by addons
---
Leave the match
---
Ehh  I guess I‚Äôm in the opposite boat as you. I enjoy the grind as it‚Äôs one of the reasons I keep playing. This is also one of the FEW games I‚Äôll buy micro transactions for. I love the game so ima buy the pass and the cosmetics (not all. Just the few I like. I haven‚Äôt bought many.) and obviously get the new chapter.
---
When I started my plan was to raise billy for enduring and nurse for nurses calling then buy hag with my first shards to get ruin, ruin showed up in the shrine so I got that and bought spirit for spirit fury long before I hit devotion 1. That means I could run ruin enduring spirit fury and sloppy butcher, which is good on virtually any killer. Minus the luck of getting ruin in the shrine, you can drop spirit fury for nurses calling and enduring for just about anything you like, or not bc enduring by itself is still pretty good. It was AFTER THAT that I ever got any dlc. Its even easier for survivor. Borrowed time, dead hard, wglf and self care are all free and more than strong enough to win games in green and purple ranks if you‚Äôve learned to loop properly and hit at least half of your ruin skill checks. In short, paying extra is an option. Bbq is good but not necessary and pretty god damn cheap to begin with. Five dollars, and sometimes on sale, to double the rate you level up? Sounds like a steal to me.
---
Looks Good üëç
---
She just requires practice
---
You probably only faced rank 20s dude I'm sure if you leveled up youd see plenty of people killing all 4

still aside from that its the same as Wraith without invisibility.
---
Also saboing hooks and gens would take time and really not be that useful, if thats all
---
Yeah its legit but a little disappointing
---
It is an online multiplayer game, of course they are going to monetize it, they are a business and this is how they make money, just like any other job or product.
---
But what happened with the swings?
---
Get that guy in a custom match with some random as Legion and run than a, dying light, sloppy, nurses on Legion lmao
---
#ByeAshy
---
Some situations you literally cannot win against a swf that can communicate through comms 
---
For example:
---
If You‚Äôre  a m1 killer, anytime You start a chase anywhere they let their team know, they all do separate gens (most of the time, at least 2 at once) 
---
If You break chase to go hit different gens, that person You chased immediately hops on another gen and the other guys hop on.  It‚Äôs a never ending cycle that the killer physically can‚Äôt keep up with.
---
Even if you end up with 3 gens super close together. Unless you have billy, nurse or maybe spirit, good luck dealing with those survivors... they will be spread out between the 3 or even 2 gens and the moment you barely leave one of the gens or breathe in the direction of a survivor the entire rest of the team hits more gens. 
---
So how exactly is that outplaying someone?  That‚Äôs just a broken mechanic because the killer literally has no chance to win against that level of coordination. (Mainly because the games not built around comms, but they commonly exist) 
---
I mean... I make some suggestions all the time, but nobody wants to hear it...
---
If they just added a system to swf that gave them slight debuffs per member of the team, it would be better for everyone 
---
Ex: 2 swf - stay normal .  3 swf- those 3 members get a % debuff to gen speeds  4 swf- bigger debuff to gen speeds
---
I wonder, if Claudette and Meg had their old designs, if people would hate Meg and Meg players?
---
Then get better at it.
---
PLOT TWIST
---
You should never *need* a perk to counter a specific killer.
---
But I guess you're right. I'll just switch my perks after I load in and realise it's the Spirit.
---
Bye Ashy!
---
i was thinking maybe addons would change instead of progression being slowed, it could insanely increase the amount of skill checks that pop up which could aid ruin or make the skill checks harder/remove the great skillcheck part for x seconds. thanks for the feedback, i'll start thinking of ways to make him a bit more unique
---
YOU ESCAPED
---
Its bc you have to buy it *and then* work for it. Im ok with that bc i play all the time but other just get cosmetics bc their cool and play every now and then
---
That's nice dear but doesn't change the fact that he objectively does have a large following compared to the average person
---
"Don't you remember? You already died on hook! Here, I'll make you remember!"
---
There is no add-on that makes survivors Oblivious, they're Oblivious at base. "Just have Rancor and don't chase to counter an obnoxious and broken perk." There is one brown add-on that makes survivors blind to auras for 60 seconds, so that could be a real, legit counter.

---
So we have two major problems. The first is that 1v4 is super unbalanced in favor of the 4. 1v1+1+1+1 is also super unbalanced in favor of the killer. More people seem to play in 4 man swf because it‚Äôs the only viable option at high ranks. But then we get into 1v2+2 or 1v2+1+1 and it‚Äôs still bad because of carrying. There‚Äôs no clear solution here. Either 1v4=killers are at the disadvantage or 1v1+1+1+1 survivors are at disadvantage.
---
Second issue is with money. Ok you can get all the perks by playing the games but it takes a lot of grinding and hoping the good perks show up in the shrine. Imo that‚Äôs fair. Outing cosmetics behind a paywall is also fair. Especially for licensed characters.
---
mr "pretty good job so far" mentioned they are thinking about rank rewards at NYCC
---
As of about six hours ago, you're wrong. At least for PC. They're doing another test.
---
As for OP's question, my games have been fine. No delays on M1s or M2s. 55-60 ping.
---
I agree, i'm not a fan of this battlepass type thing coming out. I understand it adds something to the game but now the game is starting to be all about cosmetics and i'm worried where this could take us
---
Nice
---
Ping is always green for me in dedicated severs and I notice when I hold down M1 to repair gens the mouse will stop holding down as if I let go even though I'm still holding it down.
---
"honestly they should just remove the entire gameplay loop and replace it with killer just winning"
---
Is there a big dbd switch community? Planning to get the game soon
---
Dedicated servers are live right now. They went live again for testing since 4 or 5 hours ago.
---
Otz is good, but nobody is anywhere close to as good as FunGoose is.
---
Foot fetish players will love it I guess
---
Another ptb test like last time? Or something new?
---
I kinda agree, I have  2k hours (total nerd ik) and I hate the battle pass and the Nurse changes. I‚Äôm really not liking the way DBD is becoming it just feels too different.
---
Yes.
---
Ew why do you see all the hatchets even if you're re loaded
---
I got BBQ&amp;C from the Shrine...
---
Tell that to BHVR. Maybe then they will actually impose a harsher penalty on camping. Because losing BP does nothing to them. Campers could care less about ranking up.
---
Its a blight skin i believe?? So i assume its for the upcoming event !!
---
Doctor. He‚Äôs just so much fun. Shocking people is very satisfying, and his add-ons allow you to just cause mayhem. My personal favorite is the illusionary pallets that vanish when a survivor gets close to one; it never gets old watching someone attempt to throw down a pallet, only for them to realize that it isn‚Äôt really there. And smacking people with the spiky punishment stick is also great.
---
Really depends on whether you play survivor or killer. If you play survivor, then lobbies take less than ten seconds to find. If you play killer, might as well give up on the idea of playing the game. As I'm typing this, I've been sitting here for about 15 minutes waiting to find a lobby as killer and I'm starting to give up hope.
---
It really depends how you use it. If you want to try to use it in chase to try to escape then quick and quiet is almost a must. However if you want to use it before a chase to get distance then you don't need quick and quiet cause you can slowly get in to the locker. Quick and quiet has other uses though so it still might be worth it to have in your build if it suits your play.
---
Farmer johns pants must if been drenched when he saw that lol
---
OoO is literally the strongest vs Trapper what are you on about? Having 4 people constantly know where you‚Äôre trapping is no good
---
I mean no the insult is still rooted in insulting women.
---
No, servers are enabled on the live version for another test, like they were about a week ago.
---
Shit, this actually a pretty good deal.  I'm finding few things to complain about with it.  Alright, consider me sold!
---
spine chill
---
lw is borderline useless, spine chill can actually save you sometimes, while lightweight is either in a spot where the killer wouldn't of noticed you anyway, or he is chasing you and as such the reduced duration barely matters.
---
Doc is a personal favorite: I took him all the way to rank 1 a few seasons back, and I retired him for longer than I should‚Äôve. He may not be top tier, but he‚Äôs definitely underrated imho.
---
Yeah true I think OoO will change they just need to find a balance to where it works and is useful over just nerfing it to the ground. One neeed was for stealth killers having the undetectable but I feel a nice change would have it be like a cooldown ability like you can use it once every 80/70/60 seconds to see the killer for 4/6/8 seconds that way when you spawn in a game you as the survivor and the killer don't immediately know where eachother are. Had that happen WAY to many times
---
Happened to me with a BIll on haddonfield as well. I was ghostface, he fell in front of me and didnt think to look behind him
---
*Heyy Vsauce, Michael here*
---
As someone who only plays solo I‚Äôm very close to dropping this game after 1k hours, rank 1 on both sides and owning all dlcs.
---
As killer I have to face SWFs almost every game. They immediately know where I am, where my totems are and have a dedicated pallet looper to waste my time all game making it an exercise in frustration.
---
As survivor I have to face killers who easily demolish solos (but still can‚Äôt really deal with SWFs). EGC and closing the hatch has dropped my escape rate from close to 70% to well under 50%. Now I probably escape one in four games at most.
---
Basically I‚Äôm screwed on both sides and its due to failure to properly balance the game with SWF.
---
dafuq
---
Legion skin kinda wack
---
Alright, not to be a dick but do you have a source? A quick google just shows old info and you‚Äôre responding pretty quickly.
---
Do /then the command
---
Spirit is seriously busted in ptb right now. Not just this bloodweb stuff but if you vs against her as survivor you either get constant heartbeat or none at all and it completely messes with your audio, it then carries over to the next games you play until you restart. My friends and I thought the audio bugs were random at first but then we realised that 8/8 times it happened it started in a Spirit match.
---
They got us in the first half, not gonna lie
---
I literally just used spine chill for this first game ever because I finally understand it and it was pretty damn amazing. Was able to fix three generators under ruin by myself just by watching spine chill. It's definitely worth it.
---
They generally post this stuff on their twitter, [here](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1181992594596929537).
---
Or, and hear me out, maybe, since you cry that it's always Spirit, why don't you *assume* that it might be Spirit and set up a perk build for her. Unless you mean to tell me you don't actually face Spirit every game.
---
Also, I'm going to need to take your statement on Hex: Ruin and generators. Since, well ya know, killers need a perk to counter survivors playing the game. But hey, if you don't really care, that's fine. It just shows how much you actually care about the game's balance and not at all about making sure your survivor games are as easy as possible.
---
They fed up code and instead of patching it on live they just put it on the PTB I think
---
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs up I‚Äôll give it a shot.  Is the 6% speed boost always active when the perk is equipped?
---
Then we'll have to wait a few years for Devotion Level Rewards :')
---
Last time I said this I was getting negative karma :/. Wish there was like polls BHVR could do to actually gather a consensus.
---
Haha sadly every gaming subreddit devolves into it sometimes. I just focus on the memes and weekly questions thread to help people out :)
---
Except that doesn't happen in the middle of nowhere, he just pulled that out of his ass, which is why I ignored the stupid argument and the fact that you're defending him means you're also dumb and therefor not worth my time.
---
I'm just gonna let you think you're high and mighty and think you know everything, meanwhile imma wait here for Billy and Spirits inevitable changes to make them more balanced. And if you're gonna go "if they do that then imma quit DbD" all I can say is: good riddance. One less killer main who thinks that if they don't 4k it means they lost. At least at that point people can actually enjoy the game.
---
This is officially the best combination of customizations in the game
---
There‚Äôs only a few times where DC‚Äôing is ok: really bad connection all of a sudden to the point where you can‚Äôt even play anymore, you and someone found the hatch and you DC so they can instantly get it, or you DC to counter BBQ.
---
So they should have waited longer before unhooking their friend.
---
Better than nothing I suppose. I‚Äôm pretty excited for his new weapons
---
They actually made the add-on where you see your blink location into a common, so practicing with Nurse may arguably be easier now actually. She‚Äôs just not brokenly good anymore.
---
Aces perks are worse than mediocre
---
üí¶the perfect storm
---
Yes you chose. I heard you may be able to get last years aswell but im not sure.
---
I know!! We just gent events that are basically the base game, but with aesthetics.
---
Same I've apparently missed so many things this week.
---
Once Servers officially roll out they can more accurately track actual DCs instead of if someone DC'd because they wanted to or something happened because being connected to the host isn't the most stable thing (also all the bugs and glitches with every update because spaghetti code)
---
So I wouldn't be surprised if there was some bans rolled out a little while after servers roll out because some players exceeded the DC %
---
2 weeks
---
Why does he have 2 gloves D:
---
Sure, and I agree with them being rooted and used once upon a time. Just not currently. I don't even think "sexist slurs" exist anymore. Sexist statements do, however.
---
If you ‚Äúknow‚Äù please give some examples of how people hack DBD on console vs PC, because on PC it‚Äôs extremely easy - though you‚Äôll likely get a swift ban if you don‚Äôt buy an EAC bypass. So do enlighten me on how people hack DBD on console ‚Äúeasier‚Äù than on PC. 
---
Also DBD is barely a competitive game, let‚Äôs be real.
---
Pig, Myers, ghostface, gorgon are all different on how they play though. Having a similar trait like dash or stealth doe'snt make them the same. Pig dash can be used for loops while gorgon is used for bottlenecks. Myers stalk is a charge up. While ghostface is per situation.
---
The grind of dbd is tasteful consider how others do it. And is one of the reason it keeps its playerbase
---
Meg is part of the chain gang
---
Nah just a rationale person that doesn't whine over not getting cosmetics handed to me for free.  It's a business dude.  They're going to sell some shit lol.  If the battlepass like passively added speed to your killer or survivor than sure bring out the pitchforks.  But it's literally just eye candy.  Cosmetics are tail bones.  We don't need them and to be fair many quite cool ones can be unlocked for free through playtime.  The entitlement on this sub sometimes is mindblowing to me.
---
For twice the slashy stabbies
---
Haha me too *highfives in poor*
---
What????????? You had me at the first one. Then 180‚Äôd into cheating 
---
Bypassing a game mechanic to get hatch and leave the opposing side 0 chance to defend is NOT ok
---
And I don‚Äôt know what you mean by ‚Äúdc to counter bbq‚Äù
---
How does it counter bbq?
---
&gt;or you DC to counter BBQ.
---
&gt;:(
---
(Seriously though give Killer a BBQ stack if the Survivor DCs)
---
Thank the entity
---
I really hope this is true lol
---
So do Nurses. And Huntresses.
---
What's my name?
---
Killer calls you trash in the Endgame chat.
---
Obviously not right away in the game, but like if it‚Äôs just you and one other guy left
---
I wish I had my rusty chain, yo
---
w8, what are you talking about? I missed that. How to get free cosmetics?
---
You know those are getting removed, right?  Kinda pointless to bitch about them now.
---
Oooo so their saying it‚Äôs ok to dc the first time you get downed...  
---
I just...  don‚Äôt get how that‚Äôs ok
---
That isn't how it is "supposed" to work. It is how it USED to work untill the developers realized the flaw in its design.
---
Maybe 7 survivors and 2 killers or something idk
---
Legion is a very weak killer
---
Billy is probably the best killer without really being a solid killer. He is normal base speed, has the chainsaw for map pressure and one shot downs. The build depends on what perks you have available for him. I found that my favorite build with him is discordance, pop goes the weasel, blood warden, and either enduring or spirit fury.
---
DBD content creators every time a new chapter killer comes out.
---
Well that was violent
---
Seems 1 comes with the (paid)battle pass, 
---
If they go off like last year filling up the serum you should be able to get 2 full cosmetics for free as long as you do the objectives 
---
Hopefully they also make it so the serum/tokens for killer and survivors are tallied together 
---
I remember everyone stayed as killer as it was the easiest to fill leading to 40+min lobby's
---
As for you always crying about always facing Spirit, that was a generalization on my part, since about 90% of this sub's whining comes from stupid shit like 
---
Retard 1: I cheer when I face Billy. 
---
Retard 2: Ha! I cheer when I face Nurse! 
---
So that's on me assuming you are among that collection of jackasses regurgitating overexaggerated stupid-ass opinions. You complained about Spirit, I assumed you were brainless. 
---
But as for me calling your opinions dogshit, I never once did that. I pointed out how wrong you were, but I never called you or your opinions dogshit. 
---
And Sprint Burst is heavily underrated since the (much needed) Exhaustion nerf. It promotes a very safe playstyle revolving around getting to safety and then doing a gen. This playstyle allows you to do unsafe gens with the plan to sprint to safety and discourage the killer from chasing you. Against Spirit, it has the very welcome side-effect of granting a free escape from her due to her having just used her phase to reach the area you were in. 
---
Dance With Me is an insanely good perk for disorienting killers, especially when paired with Lithe and/or Quick and Quiet. Against Spirit, of she's phasing, she can only rely on injury and scratch marks, the latter of which can be nullified by using Dance With Me. 
---
And as for your stance on gen times, I have to say, it caught me off guard because you're probably one of the most reasonable sounding people on the subject of gen times. And you're a Spirit hater, so that's really an accomplishment on your part. I don't agree completely with your heavy-handed approach to Ruin, via straight-up removal, but I'm relieved to see that you actually admit gens straight up suck as an objective for killers to safeguard.
---
Or since ruin is useless and swf are so common at high ranks maybe make the survivors do more gens
---
+1 steam notification after getting the 4k
---
Killer queen has already touched this bottle.
---
Susie is best girl.
---
 It after seeing the upcoming skins that got data mined, I'm Think Julie's going to have to be my main squeeze for awhile, those dia de los muertos skins look amazing
---
Weird flex but ok
---
I definitely wouldn‚Äôt get Ace. His perks are kind of just for messing around. If you wanna have a good build to help you win, I do not recommend his perks.
---
Legion
---
Can't forget about baby dweet
---
I've been complaining about the cosmetic prices
---
To be honest in green ranks play a killers you have fun playing with, but if you want to tryhard or just try a strong killer,you have nurse and spirit who are the strongest, followed by billy.
---
For builds you can check Fungoose guides for killers.
---

---
Unfortunately lol
---
Matchbook just means you don't play those games though. You walk at people.
---
It still feels like this years blight is much worse that the last. The last hollowed blight felt like the first real event with a new objective and a new array of actually good skins to work for. Now the reward isn't directly linked to the blight and the skins aren't even new. It might not seem like that big of a deal because we are still getting the same stuff, but I think the original blight was much more interesting.
---
Add on
---
Pussy killer!
---
*Hide behind a Gen
---
*Get in a locker
---
*Stay within the range
---
*Distortion is a Perk
---
*Run one direction for 4 seconds then turn around
---
If you need to DC to counter BBQ then something is seriously wrong with your playstyle
---
Solo I don't mind if idiots dc, just encourage me to do the obj faster, 
---
It's just when I go swf and get paired up with randos and they dc that I get irritated cuz I feel "if only we had 1 more guy" we could have made it out
---
You got that right! 
---
They weren‚Äôt gonna wait around and miss that cash grab! The damn event doesn‚Äôt drop for 2 more weeks and only last a week and 3 days and we can‚Äôt even get flashlights or lunchboxes yet when this time last year we could! 
---
But sure let‚Äôs drop the new cosmetics so we can get what money we can! ‚ÄúBhVR‚Äù
---
Soon I imagine, it might come out with the new event. 
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Do the gen meg.
---
Today I had two Claudette with flashlights but they didn't know how to use them.
---
Lol, I'm actively playing survivor *right now* but ok. Besides, you think that getting backrevved has zero counterplay, which it doesn't. Either you vault a window or you drop a pallet or you juke the saw. If there are no windows or pallets, chances are, you are in the middle of nowhere and deserve to go down.
---
And just because you say
---
&gt;Ree, you're stupid so I don't have to argue
---
doesn't make it true. Unless you have any support for that claim, it's just an excuse to run away from a lost argument.
---
Besides, I wouldn't quit DBD if Spirit and Billy got nerfed, I'd just play Nurse. The changes do nerf her, but it's by such a small amount that it wouldn't stop me if I put in the hours. Which I already have. Shows how lazy and small-minded you are thinking that just because something seems bad I'll want to quit. We don't all quit when things don't go our way. Just you buddy.
---
Huh. I thought it was vanity that made you slower. My bad
---
It's probably Pennywise without a map. Unlike Chapter 15, a new map is not noted for Chapter 14. I doubt they would release an original killer without or map (or without a Survivor). I could be wrong, though.
---
Freddy has shit add ons, but his base kit is great, so people basically just complain about add-ons. 
---
Complaints about Nurse are most likely going to be about how she's still super broken, but feels awful to play.
---
True, true.
---
And then it's just a Cypress Mori.
---
There aren't enough active players in rank 18-20.  Devs don't want new players sitting in que for 10 minutes.
---
Good riddance
---
No new Susie skin? Bah
---
I dont mean this in a mean way, but you're just going to have to get better as killer. I stopped using ruin and I have gotten way better. Try to run pop or dying light instead since you have those the entire game and dont rely on a hex totem
---
At the very least, we could get one of the gang as a paragraph survivor. I think we all know Shaggy is the best option, as he has the most meme clout. I still honest to god think a Scooby Doo chapter, while a bit silly, would be genuinely AMAZING.
---
I honestly want Pretty Lady. Like the version from MKX. It‚Äôd be badass for sure and would give some old killers some new cosmetics.
---
a good pair of headphones is her best IRL add-on.
---
but if you want to get BETTER at a Killer, don't use any add-ons at all. you should get used to their base kit first, then mess around with add-ons.
---
Just practice without add-ons, than you will get better with her.
---
Generally about 2 weeks, this one releases on I believe the 22nd
---
Me too
---
Way better than pustulas by all means regardless
---
Look at the pinned thing on the sub. I'm going to explain it shitty but the serum that you used to get from plants in the map will be earned through the battle pass instead for free and every 10 serum will give you one section of a cosmetic but idk if it's just a select few
---
Why wiggle?
---
I didn't mean to phrase it like that I'm already good with her but I want to have a better build what are the best addons
---
Apply directly to the forehead.
---
Balanced Landing, Adrenaline, DS, and Self Care
---
Needly-Dee, needly-doo, needly-DIE!
---
Lol for me the combo was SC and saboteur. Then they fixed saboteur soon after I got it because of course
---
This looks pretty fresh. The last time we got an RTS-style antagonist was an unknown HL2 mod called Zombie Master. Plus, X has meme power after the RE2 remake, so playing as him should get clout.
---
Plus, word's out. I didn't even know there were others.
---
If you want to have some fun, run thrill of the hunt, ruin, haunted grounds, devour hope, and prayer beads+ mother daughter ring.
---
It looks super cool, too. Project Resistance. It's coming to PS4, Xbox and Steam.
---
I'm new to the game, picked it up a few days ago. Lately I've been playing Claudette, is there a reason for the negativity towards her?
---
Yakuyoke amulet, wakizashi saya, and prayer beads are all good choices. If you use the amulet use wakizashi with it. If you use prayer beads idk, u choose.
---
Because servers are tricky and that everyone with different providers and network paths to the servers are going to have different experiences.
---
Well, I guess it's your word against mine. And a lot of Youtubers. And the fact that almost every Killer but Nurse and Spirit get crushed at high ranks, for some reason.
---
I main her as a killer so I‚Äôm stoked for this üòÇüò≠
---
rip
---
Really dont understand why you're crying so much about the microtransactions. It's a 20 dollar game with every 3 months a new chapter for 7 bucks. The microtransactions are completely optional and you can just ignore them, heck you can even buy a lot of cosmetics with earned currency ( and even non licensed characters! ). The similar killers you speak of they have done that since the beginning (and I think all killers are different enough from eachother). If you do not like the gameplay then that is the only valid point I've read in your post and is entirely your opinion
---
No one uses that term anymore or it's extremely rare, as I said. I've never seen whore be used towards a woman.
---
i mean its creative for sure, kind of like setting up defenses. unfortunately the fact that they're thrown down doesn't help in chase at all
---
I mean I bet those two are more competent than any teammates I play with. Looking at you DCers.
---
But I don‚Äôt use either one of those two things (but I‚Äôm the one tunneled when the Nea next to me was butt dancing up a storm)
---
I think my brother would piss his pants laughing if he saw shit that in game.
---
So I'm relatively new to the game and just got my first 2k radiant shards. Which is the best to take here? Are any of them worth it or should I wait till next week?  
---
I've got my eye in No Mither and Discordance.
---
it doesn‚Äôt show the killers aura to other survivors, it just shows survivors to survivors
---
Still better lmao
---
Legion is a decend Killer, Spirit is really strong but gets boring extremly fast after you learn how to win with her
---
So, who bringing dip?
---
The only thing I disagree with here is demonizing tryhards. It's a game, you play to win. Why be rude to someone trying to win?
---
The archive comes out 22th cause that‚Äôs when the event starts
---
Remove keys and ebony, or at least keep skeleton key's
---
Thanks, I do play wraith and plague bc I enjoy them but I‚Äôve been getting a fair amount of purple ranks who end up crapping on me
---
I‚Äôm crying that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing.
---
Kinda hope they do an original one since Demogorgon was just added, space out who they add from movies (please no penny wise)
---
Vommy Mommy‚Äôs church is always just around the corner ;)
---
Pop, Dying, and Sloppy are great together, all time burners. The one issue is you lack detection or something to help with chases. Tty replacing Thanatophobia with something like BBQ &amp; Chili or Nurses Calling!
---
Can move
---
...because they did a really good job on them, and wanted to release them a bit early for the Halloween month to push out some content meanwhile?
---
I swear, you players HATE and complain when BHVR tries to make any kind of money.

But at the same time if you buy survs just for meta perks you will probably rely on them way too much. Running other builds is fun (and don‚Äôt forget about the archives, where running new builds will be encouraged). I certainly wouldn‚Äôt take just meta perks into consideration. Plus, if you‚Äôve ever seen prepatch legion, he sucked to go against, and still does. My vote is on ace.

I'm a noob and came here specifically for this kind of breakdown. Thanks a bunch my man.

---
You toxic, trash, baby, tunneling, camping, lagswitching, crutch-using, salty Killer! Don't you know that you can't play the game?? /s
---
At some point I think a slender man or a killer themed off of the idea would be pretty sick have a super dark map cluttered with trees
---
About $7, and got the game for free on PS4 about a year ago.
---
It turns silver iirc and goes a lot slower.
---
&gt;Hiding behind a gen does nothing lol.
---
Mind explaining why?
---
&gt;Again, particular reason are ok.
---
Something that literally makes attempting normal gameplay impossible sure (Severe lag, glitches/bugs, etc.) because there's literally no way to counteract it.
---
DCing to screw the Killer out of BBQ Aura just because it's a 2v1 is not a valid reason.
---
&gt;At that point in the game, the killer already has his/her stacks and will get the blood points anyways.
---
Sacrifice Category would like a word with you.
---
Gens in general should probably have some secondary "scavenge" objective to pass half-progress, at least on a random 3-4 gens, but Ruin shouldn't become RNG. Even just having it do the 2s progress pause on Good checks without regressing would still leave it plenty strong if cleansed.
---
it‚Äôs different information, so one is not just objectively better than the other
---
Bubba. Because he's Bubba and I love him. he a good boy
---
Did they show up in demo's?
---
Actually a pretty cool concept.
---
I will trade your gen taping team mates for my team mates that don't touch a gen in 10 minutes, even without ruin.
---
Do u have a youtube you seem funny and I would love seein more
---
I forgot to read the manual
---
Well you are what you eat, so I suppose her diet must have included lots of Jane latley.
---
WaIt tHErEs a mObIlE vErsIoN?

I like this :)
---
society,,..  now yuo see
---
Wraith thought he got a kill that he rang his little bell prematurely (well bing bong bitch, now you got no kill and egg on your face) well done executed escape
---
Thana isn't really that useful. As mentioned, you should swap in something that helps you find Survivors to apply pressure.
---
Also, if you're playing Wraith or Clown or Doctor or something, you just can't expect to win. That's not how it works.
---
$10, game was free when I got it :)))
---
Shit, I'm jealous.
---
Why would you ever want to use that
---
Prayer beads are by far the best addon but 50% of the time (which is low balling it) people will immediately DC once they know you have them. Pairs best with Yamoakas and perks to let you gen grab
---
The one that lets you see blood is super underrated but you're going to have to get an honest first hit and then phase to them as opposed to phasing to them and then chasing for the second hit
---
Movement speed ones are good at lower ranks because people tend to hold W vs her and this just blows that up
---
Honestly tho, spirit is one of the few killers that isnt addon dependant at all. The addons are nice and help a little bit if you use them well but they arent really going to be game changing unless you do gen grabbing build with prayer beads.
---
hahahaha well let's see what they plan for us. I would be more than happy to illustrate their background stories!
---
Dream did come true :D
---
if you dont mind me asking, how did you make the joey mask?
---
Game was free when I bought it, easily poured maybe 150 into the game? I don't usually buy dlc for games, but I really love DBD.
---
Thank you! appreciate it, I usually go for the SovietWomble style of subtitles when I edit clips.
---
That was nice! That dude felt the karma for that shit right away.
---
Yes
---
What happens if we wake her up?
---
I don‚Äôt wanna fucking talk about it. I keep buying Meg skins and almost none of them are interesting, but I keep fucking doing it.

I like prayer beads and mother daughter ring personally.

I‚Äôm beginning to feel like I‚Äôm toxic

Lol I can imagine that happening

Just make it 2 protection hits, remove all the other effects it has and it will be pretty fun perk to run
---
Nice, actual healing Claudettes rise up!
---
idk, but not all perks have to be ‚Äúok so this is the best perk and here is the reason‚Äù
---
Dude never said they didn‚Äôt respect it, if anything a sign of respect towards an opponent is taking them seriously, so good survs frustrate me. Doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt respect them. It‚Äôs the exact opposite.
---
I just bought a 2 dollar mask (not plastic) and painted it black then I cut and glued a black bandanna I already had and painted the skull details on the mask
---
About 40ish
---
I cackled
---
I hated this game at launch so much I quit, came back for Huntress, got tilted off by the toxic community, came back again, am pretty disgusted by gameplay being paywalled but I'm too stubborn to give up on getting another character with shards.
---
So yeah, I don't have a good time with DbD. I think what keeps me shackled to it is that it COULD be a fun game, but the devs seem to absolutely refuse to let it be one for anyone but the sweatiest, most sadistic SWF teams or people playing against way lower-ranked opponents.
---
The base kit Nerf is absolutely needed she is absolutely oppressive as is
---
It really do feel like that, I'm really hoping that the Archives help reduce this grind meaningfully.
---
[removed]
---
wakizashi saya (purple) and the katana tsuba (green) are my favorite. absolutely love the reappearance lunge. i like it better than the pink add ons and prayer beads.
---
I dont really like directly comparing Ruin to Dying Light cause they dont give you slowdown at the same time of the game. It's like comparing Haunted vs Devour. Ruin/ Haunted give you good momentum and time to work at the beginning of the game. Dying/ Devour let you snowball early hooks into a killer-advantaged midgame but get no value right away.
---
A better comparison is Ruin vs Corrupt in which case Ruin is just objectively better. It makes the survivors move just as much as Corrupt does but Ruin also slows gens down.
---
What do you get, when you cross a solo queue player, with a community that does nothing but facecamp and tunnel you to death while being **sandbagged by his own team mates!?**
---
sick! might steal that idea!
---
I think he's on a legacy edition, like ps4
---
All perks should have a reason to pick them...
---
i mean yeah but if you want to play an m1 killer why not play any of the others? There's a bunch of them. People who normally play nurse play her so that they can avoid getting looped in general.
---
Mike Myers? Yea baby
---
Bruh, charms are something new. The battlepass is something new. Cosmetics take time to make and we already are getting so many in just this month alone. Quit complaining, this is like the first rift we are getting.

People who play her are generally either inexperienced (for good reason because she has really good perks for beginners) or are experienced players who play toxically

It's like Mei from Overwatch, which is supposed to be a kind, determined scientist that wants to help the world yet she is often called satan. Well... at they they have some reasons to call her satan (that laugh after a melee kill though...)
---
actually im pretty sure its 20k auric cells
---
It'll be the same day as the other platforms and if I'm correct, should be around the Blight starts which I think is the 27th
---
What were they tho ?
---
Kate‚Äôs for me
---
You can buy the Halloween skins now, but the event hasn‚Äôt started yet. Rift and Archives are live on the ptb, so technically they aren‚Äôt ‚Äúout‚Äù yet either.
---
but it does, which is to know if the killer is leaving a body or taking it to hook
---
No need to be rude. I know exactly what you mean and again, I disagree. Collision is part of her kit and it makes sense that she runs into walls AND survivors. 
---
Actually I think if they nerfed her activation time and gave survs a warning sooner when shes phasing towards them (the vacuum sound,) thatd help a lot. It's when shes activating that allows survs to get a head start in running or juking.
---
Overwatch's characters are all free. Most games that add characters either have them always available with in-game currency or just free. EA got a ton of backlash when they made a 40 hour grind to unlock characters in Battlefront 2. Yet somehow it's cool for DbD to sell cosmetics AND gameplay-affecting characters. And then, on the other side, NOT the battlepass.
---
Wow, such contribution, many discuss
---
Ok thank you!
---
But you can watch them pick up the survivor and I'm pretty sure Empathy/Bond/Aftercare works for that
---
No more insta heals sort of
---
Every time I win someone is calling me names, I‚Äôve gotten more messages from survivors in dbd than in almost any other game on box. Mikey just wants to slice and dice y‚Äôall.
---
It's not exactly a build you could've run on Freddy previously either.    It's not so much "loses the ability" so much as "it's about the same, but also now he can do this too."
---
You have to pay for Ace?! He‚Äôs free on PS4
---
Dedicated servers got activated again meaning it doesn't need a killer to have Survivors in the lobby(only PC currently)
---
joker survivor when
---
Hmmm.....i guess you should re think your comment or something
---
this idea excites and terrifies me, take my upvote
---
like i said, it doesn‚Äôt have to be the best perk, other perks might be able to do similar things better. but that doesn‚Äôt mean it just shouldn‚Äôt exist
---
thank you!! :)
---
They turned dedicated servers back on so they don‚Äôt need killers to host lobbies anymore.
---
the killer could have literally just hooked him to avoid that unbreakable LMFAO what
---
Losing feels bad and toxic people make losing feel way, way worse, even when they're the ones doing it, so people run away from losing.
---
Sometimes it actually is just not wanting to waste time. Everyone hates Doctor because he's just grindy to play against (allegedly; I never see the guy), and yeah I can see how you'd want to play a game instead of hold M1 for an hour, but it's still a dick move to put that burden on OTHER people.
---
They were working on a patch and he popularized the bug.  And since it was in a public match, he showed that was possible.  People found out how to do it and the whole game broke.  In KYF it‚Äôs not bannable, but in public matches bug abuse is bannable.
---
One time, I looped a Spirit around a pallet for ONE GEN.
---
Then 2 survivors suicided on hook in the basement, and I sacrificed myself on purpose to try to get this Nancy to find the hatch, but we all died.
---
Spirit said "You suck lmao"
---
I said, "Thanks, please call me a potato survivor next time :D"
---
I sometimes wonder what creative insults people can have in all situations.
---
Lmao, one of my favorite X-Files memes, but I wonder if Mulder/Scully would ever work as survivors
---
I don't have a problem with these microtransactions, almost doesn't affect the gameplay and are just cosmetic or licensed killers. But they have to shorten the gap between SWF and solo players. Nothing agaisn't people who want to play with their friends but the simple fact that they can comunicate it's a massive advantage over a solo player, or even 2 and 2 premades.
---
If they don't want to implement any form of chatting into the game, they could add some form of alert or ping system which could be binded to any button,or something like Counter Strike, and with sound cues and colors for different situations like, the killers is with me, or rescue me, etc, for not having to react to a whole message but to specific and recognizable patrons to comunicate. Also a form of cd for every command and muting would be necesary.
---
If they can shorten the gap with the form they choose from and balance the game having that in base, it would improve the player experience, and would be the same experience for SWF, and less frustrating for solo players &amp; killers, both at all ranks.
---
Yes it does, you're literally making a perk that other perks already do and your perk does it worse. There is no reason why it should exist
---
around 100 in two years or so
---
I mainly want to play survivor, but I do want to try out killer. Why is it like that at the moment? Lack of players? I hope to make some friends to play the game with too
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dfnedf/when_is_the_holloween_event/
---
The ironic part is I see more toxic Dwights on Xbox than anyone else
---
Yeah but it would to be not shitty reboot Freddy for that to happen I think.
---
Definitely not a lack of players, I guess they're all just playing killer lol
---
Wow you just described how to play the game... you think that‚Äôs not what solo survivors are doing in purple-red ranks? The problem isn‚Äôt SWF it‚Äôs the game mechanics, the objectives. All there is for us to do is gens, although if you want to pip in red ranks you‚Äôre gonna have to do a lot more than that (totems, chases, saves etc) &amp; I think these new challenges they are implementing will help people pursue different gaming styles so the people who usually sit on gens or crouch walk the corner will be pushed into playing differently giving the killer more opportunity to find them and hook them. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure how easy it would be for them to implement something that only effects half of the players in this game, not everyone is SWF. Sure you can nerf their gen speeds but experienced, competent teams will still beat you. If anything they need to nerf gen speeds for everyone to make games go a little longer, as for hex totems well, they aren‚Äôt as random as you‚Äôd think, it‚Äôs easier to remember where they spawn. You‚Äôre not going to win every game, some survivors are going to outplay you no matter what kind of nerfs you throw on them.
---
Its always a Claudette. Always. Even as survivor I get worried when I see a Claudette because when the game isn't going their way they tend to screw over the rest of the team.
---
Almost as good as Koichi pose WGLF
---
Meg cause she embodies my spirit of just runing around all the time and fucking shit up.
---
I heard a really cool idea a while back where when you break Ruin instead of going away it moves to the next totem. This way you have to find and break all 5 and it helps with gen rushing and prevents the games where Ruin gets broken instantly and it's pretty much gg.
---
The thing is that idea wouldve been great back when ruin was the only good slowdown in the game. Since then theyve added so many good ways to slow gen progress as well as reworking/ adding killers that can actually effectively pressure the map that it's just unecessary now. Ruin isn't even a must pick anymore and I don't think that's because it needs a buff.
---
Can't see auras if you can't hook.
---
This is the insight into these people's mind you wanted. At least, this guy's faction.
---
That's good.
---
I was worried because the website Dennis Reep has people thinking Spirit is better than Nurse, but then I saw people voting that Demogorgon, Freddy, and Myers are stronger killers than Hillbilly and Huntress.
---
Motherly love+ botany knowledge + medkit= virtual insta heal
---
Ace is the quietest survivor in the game and also an absolute god among men. But definitely get legion
---
Exactly my point. N00b3 made it his own style. 
---
Instead of constantly trying to copy that, why not try out your own style of video editing? Why try and copy somebody else?
---
I do not. It's a high risk high reward perk like all sexes. They are very strong, but are at the mercy of the survivors finding it.
---
Kiss it
---
If that basekit nerf didn't come out, this rework would be an insanely popular success on both sides. Some of the add-ons are about as useful as trappers padded jaws but at least you aren't forced to use them. 
---
But her base kit, as many. MANY people have said. Is fine. If you can't juke her base power, then the problem is you not her. I have played plenty as and against Nurse. I've played against Nurses that I've been able to juke for 4 gens and I've played against Nurses that down me in 2 blink cycles. Never once have I thought "this is complete bullshit" unless she was running multiple blinks/Omegablink. 
---
The problem that you and every Survivior main has with Nurse is that you don't get to force her to play your game like you can with any other killer. With Nurse, she forces you to play HER game. SHE is the power role in a Nurse fight, not the Surviviors. And for an asymmetrical 4v1 game, that 1 is the power role. If you are part of the team of 4, either be way better than that 1 or you play their game. Plain and simple. Nurse was the only killer that could do this against Surviviors playing optimally (instaheals, flashlights, dead hard, Decisive, Adrenaline, etc.) And even then, opting to take that fight without add-ons was still an uphill battle. She was the only killer that against optimal Surviviors stood a chance, and now with this nerf she is generously worse than Spirit. 
---
Nurse is designed to be a powerful killer at the cost of having no utility, no detection, and is helpless without good knowledge of her power. This rework was nothing more than a bunch of colorful poorly designed add-ons meant to cover up a shitty nerf that over 4 pages of players on the PTB feedback forums are saying make her feel miserable. 
---
And if this nerf wasn't crippling, Surviviors would be whining that it isn't enough. Considering they are dead silent on it, that speaks volumes.
---
Thank you :)

hahah I literally just did this.
---
Played survivor only and dropped all my BP into spirit to unlock all the perks.
---
Started playing spirit for the first time this week. 
---
You don't want to know how many beads I have.
---
The initial game, and then whenever the DLC go on sale I'll buy 1 or 2. By the time they go on sale again I've typically unlocked the perks from the survivors. 
---
All things considered I've spent about $35 so far. But I intent to eventually accumulate all of the DLC content.
---
Use the old jostar secret plan.... 
---
RUN THE HELL AWAY!!!!!!!!
---
Why bc he said this after I made this comment? 
---
Yeah Ardetha went back on what he said. I don't need to come out and say "my bad I was wrong" because he did it after my comment.
---
that joey needs to hmu pronto. really good work &lt;3
---
Interesting, thanks for the info
---

---
Pass is more reasonable than the price of one set of cosmetic
---
OIII you left the pants on! Take them off!
---
"What a wallop!"
---
It's surreal that this is the breaking point. Everything you said is true, but nobody complained. Somehow, every licensed Killer and their perks being real money only was FINE, but a (relatively) ultra-efficient $10 cosmetic pack tilts everyone. I saw a post here being sad that Pig's jacket was $12 and THEY STILL BOUGHT IT.
---
Nope, you unlock the premium and you dont have to buy tiers. As you earn rift shards you unlock both the free and premium tiers together. Meaning the 1 time payment of 1k auric cells is all that is required.
---
Here's the thing.
---
The devs can't do anything about toxic players because then they'd have no community left.
---
To be fair, the entity could probably whoop Pennywise‚Äôs ass
---
Amazing! makes me really want maskless Legion cosmetics.
---
I feel we can trust them now but I'd still be hesitant because it could always change so after 2 passes we should be able to fully trust them
---
Eat a dick and google it, you inbred fuck.
---
I'm just now buying last years skins because they're all on sale. &gt;w&gt;
---
Unless you are utterly awash in shards and hate Nurse so vehemently you never expect to play her, I can't see why you wouldn't just pump the BP into her.
---
\*Read this as if it was a barbershop quartet\* Eh Eh EH EH!!! DEAAAAADD!!!
---
Did someone really buy the pig jacket for $12? That's insane
---
Thank you BHVR!
---
Sex is high risk high reward I agree... STD's and all that.
---
Fungoose is always a good choice when it comes to learning the basics of the game, as well as a fair bit of the advanced stuff
---
It‚Äôs a good combo with the other ultra addon, it‚Äôs fine, 3 blinks is already powerful on its own.
---
Permission to use on my stream? Centre right will be easy enough to achieve üòÖ
---
In a word, "Mobility."
---
Nurse, Spirit, Billy, Freddy (arguably in that order) are the top 4. That's two teleports (independent of Survivor action, unlike Hag) and two dashes.
---
Killers have to chase 4 people simultaneously. That's hard to do if you can't move fast (and you also need to be a threat, Wraith.)
---
We live in an urban evasion
---
Those who play Claudette are either amazing Altruists or complete dicks, usually the latter
---
Didn't they buff vaulting speed so he's kind of in the dumpster?
---
When was I ever knocking the devs you dipshit, I literally said it was a good strategy
---
I had that happen a few times during the ST PTB. Killers never loaded in either.
---
where do you live
---
xD hahaha thanks :)
---
It's because whenever a killer is changed the maniacs who think the old version come out and start complaining.
---
Trapper. He's extremely satisfying to catch someone with, especially in contrast to how weak M1 Killers are in general.
---
YEAH! Wish the same, I just hope they would fix their very blank expressions :)
---
You can't blink around small loops fast enough. Three blinks are kinda useless against loops now.
---
Nurse is the worst killer until she becomes the best. I wouldnt reccomend that for starting out, especially because the new update will change all the muscle memory you built up for her.
---
I love this
---
Gg outplayed
---
You're very welcome, I wish we could actually get an option to play Legion without their mask on.
---
Oh hi mom.
---
I don't play to win. I play to play.
---
"The Entity has cleaned the floor of the Killer shack. Now Killers slide along it 5% faster."
---
Spirit best killer if you include add-ons, Nurse still best base power, imo
---
Oh no, now its Ricardo Milos AND Michael Myers!!
---
Im that meg that goes for the unhook but gets bitch slap before achiving it.
---
We are getting the battle pass too.
---
Either you'd have to make a whole other game (which could be good) or Survivors would be obliterated, as they're balanced around the power of 3rd person.
---
An paper bag on the head will do the trick sweetheart\~
---
Thats not what i meant. I meant for you to check your resources and say oh okay I guess I was incorrect and be updated. Not looking for a hard on apology lol
---
White claudette, ah wasn't that alpha Claudette? She was playable at one point. Really odd they even made that change.
---
Why DC when you can AFK instead?
---
Unless it's spite. You can hurt internet strangers more with a pure DC.
---
Happy marriage!
---
I mean you are free to your opinion but many long time players have said she needs to be toned down, and as far as the playing her game argument, her game includes all of survivors tools being worthless and not allowing them to play the game with little consequence to herself. You also brought up the argument of bringing extremely meta perks and items which isn't always the case. You also act as though spirit isn't incredibly strong or Billy there still are viable killers for sure.
---
Isn't that kind of Doctor's thing?
---
I will not say an exact amount but it's well into the hundreds. I have a problem lol
---
OOTL What's that perk?
---
I don't think either of them make you slower, it's just tier 1 is slower.  Judith's Tombstone DOES slow you down, though
---
But he always acknowledges the good plays by them :)
---
There are Spirit skins other than schoolgirl?
---
From what very little ive seen from videos etc (not from myself bc i play on ps4 so this could be wrong so take it with a grain of salt) it just seems like dailys that get u currency to progress in the battle pass so it doesn‚Äôt seem too terrible imo. they have been cutting down on the grind recently with the bloodweb changes etc so i have some faith in them. And at the end of the day it‚Äôs optional and if u think its too grindy dont buy it.
---
Its a good point mate, i see what youre saying. I didnt really copy him on purpose. But i noticed the similarities for sure haha.
---
Just have to discover my own ‚Äòstyle‚Äô whatever that might be.
---
I put -rep kills survivors on my own steam profile.
---
If you're REALLY feeling the contempt, get Agitation and Mad Grit and just go to town on the cocky pricks.
---
When I get slugged for more than 30 seconds, I'm m gone. I didn't wait in a lobby to do more waiting on the ground
---
Yes, Solos do it as well.  
---
Which even strengthens my argument... that‚Äôs silly that only 2-3 killers in the game can hope to win against a tactic of people all on different gens at the same time 
---
It‚Äôs even WORSE against swf though...  because they can do it flawlessly every time through comms 
---
Solos do it but it‚Äôs more risky and they have a better chance to screw up, or if I‚Äôm a stealthy killer, more chance to sneak attack them because nobody can notify them when I‚Äôm not chasing or at a certain gen.
---
And sure, side tasks are good, but it doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that some survivors can finish every gen on the map in under 4 minutes and there isn‚Äôt a thing most killers can do about it ...  that‚Äôs crazy 
---
And yes, if someone outplays me, fair to them. But i find it funny if I see something that a killer can‚Äôt actually do anything about. Even if they outplay the survivors at each gen, they don‚Äôt have the tools to guard all the gens at once (so it‚Äôs not really an outplay at that point, more of a... whelp, I guess I‚Äôll kill one of these last people or maybe 2 if someone gets greedy )
---
Huntress and maybe plague can do decent against it as well (possibly)
---
It's not even my post, found it on Otzdarva's discord :P
---
Well it depends, it‚Äôs really weak on some maps too, but hey, that‚Äôs what happens when you decide to take on 3 blinks, it‚Äôs good that there is some sort of counterplay.
---
This game is really only survivor sided when it's a full swf but besides that this game hasn't been survivor sided for months as they just keep getting nerfed and instaheals just got nerfed recently. This game is in the most balanced state it has ever been meaning it not killer sided heavily or survivor sided heavily
---
Thank you. You are EPIC.
---
Already posted it

Freddy puts people to sleep when he hits them. Waking up isn't gonna do anything if Freddy is facecamping.

It's more of a player stigma. Claudette has Empathy, Self-Care, and Botany Knowledge, all of which allow her to heal herself and her teammates faster. However, on top of having these great perks, she's also black, and not just black, but DARK black. This makes her a lot harder to see on realms like Macmillan Estate. This is compounded by her "P3", or prestiged 3, outfit. The blood and gore that coats her clothes make her almost impossible to see on some maps, especially back when there were offerings to change the darkness, and even now, where there are thick mist offerings. So, these all combine to form a very attractive vessel for sweaty tryhards and ultra-competitive gamers, the worst type, and they often feel a sense of entitlement to do better as Claudette but, because the days of ole have come to pass, with Self-Care users being seen as useless to the team, a severe lack of map darkening offerings, and in general a lot of balance changes, those that play P3 Claudette are often vying for glory days of power that no longer exist.
---
TL;DR Claudette players are toxic tryhards that ruin the game for killers or make it harder for other survivors.
---
You aren't doing anything wrong by playing Claudette. Just expect that some killers will treat you a little less kindly...
---
:O But the...the internet rules. Let me know if you find the source to credit &lt;3

Really, a lot of the nicest characters seem to attract the worst of people.

Bring a buddy with you then. He cant hit you both. Or just leave him on the hook and get 3-4 gens done and punish him for facecamping. Ya‚Äôll act like face camping is OD but it terrible for the killer
---
To be honest, they got better with time and each event and the BP seems reasonable to me. But, I believe we never should trust them completely, it's always good to be on guard. I don't they would try to pull an EA on us suddenly, but they could change things slowly, that's why it's good to be aware

Against optimally playing Surviviors even Spirit and Billy struggle, especially Billy. 
---
&gt;I mean you are free to your opinion but many long time players have said she needs to be toned down,
---
We all agree on that base fact idk why you keep acting like I'm saying she didn't need toned down. But her problem, which you also ignore, those long time players have agreed were focused on the ADDONS. On the ADDONS. ON. THE. ADD. ONS. Not the basekit. 
---
&gt;You also brought up the argument of bringing extremely meta perks and items which isn't always the case
---
What part of "Optimally" doesn't make sense. It's also not always the case that every Nurse player is a tryhard God that single handedly wrecks teams before they get to even touch a generator while jerking off and eating soup at the same time.

---
snap snap, clap clap
---
Reappearance lunge is so good. Absolutely worth the practice
---
Playing killer is easier and more relaxing imo.  Then right around rank 3-4 it becomes a sweat fest.  Survivors take ruin out in under a minute.  They ride gens and do not respect the killer.  They don't worry about healing and jump right on gens after being unhooked with no fear because of DS.  So either you tunnel them and get DS'd or chase someone else and give up a gen.  Most of them aren't great loopers, but they waste enough time for the others sitting on gens.  Throw in some high tier items, meta perks and actual teamwork and things can get out of control quickly.
---
It's not usually a major problem unless you get a bad map layout.  Oh and they burn the worst map offerings fairly frequently.
---
Personally I think the game is killer favored outside of the 1% loopers.  Then it's heavily survivor favored.
---
If I were you, I'd unlock BBQ and start ranking up your killers.
---
Thats when you're awake though
---
She is literally a withered corpse which is seething with the serum
---
another killers ego taken down good one keep it up gamer
---
He's aggressive and very entitled, I cannot watch a full video of his without cringing. Either when he screams and goes all cocky because he downed a survivor or starts cussing at a very normal event that happens in a game, if the survivors are good. Add insult to injury that he's ugly asf and very cringy irl, dunno where all this cockiness comes from. Noob3 is a sweetheart and he's actually entertaining, Monto just uploads whatever makes him look "good" but is still quite toxic by nature. It's a no for me.
---
It‚Äôs apart of the game though...  i get what you‚Äôre saying, but it‚Äôs not the end of the game
---
Just like survivors running around with bnps or flashlights ,  I didn‚Äôt wait in a lobby to have a white screen or see my gens done so quickly.  But I did, because when I hit that ready button I knew exactly what I signed up for.  A game where many different things could happen.
---
By your logic, if everyone just dced because of something they didn‚Äôt like very much. Nobody would ever finish a match, because there is and always will be SOMETHING someone doesn‚Äôt like...  some game this is becoming
---
i‚Äôm awful at playing killer despite my many many attempts and it usually doesn‚Äôt lead to me having much fun unfortunately, but that‚Äôs something i might have to try if the quests start getting too hard. thanks :)

Well it appears the serum applies at least 3 stacks of Cake.

I don‚Äôt judge a survivor by the skin. I judge by the action. If someone is teabagging and flashlight clicking, I focus them until they die. Everyone else gets to live. In lobby they laugh at me but I leave smiling. Mission accomplished.
---
If survivors are using comms then it‚Äôs survivor sided
---
Just look what happened to her belly. She is a skeleton with little flesh remaining which is already becoming something else.

The Battlepass cosmetics will be in the in-game store after the Rift closes (IE season ends) if you don't want to buy the Battlepass.
---
not entirely understanding your last paragraph, i think you're saying they wont put the rift (battlepass) items into the store eventually like most games. if thats the case id like to point you to the quote; " Most rewards will be¬†exclusively available via The Archives¬†for¬†a period of time¬†and¬†released into the Store at least 6 months after their Rift has ended. More information¬†will¬†be provided¬†at a later date." 
---
this comes from the devs *Welcome to the Archive* news that you can read [here.](https://deadbydaylight.com/en/news/welcome-to-the-archives)
---
hope this helps clear some stuff up &lt;3
---
The main character‚Äôs demon form.
---
This reminds me of the old Google Plus meme
---
Killers are more favored in ranks 20-10
---
Once you start going against purple survivors the scale noticably tips in the survivors favor. Survivors are not optimal at early ranks, they can hide but they aren't great at chases, don't unhook at the right time, and just have poor time management. When you hit high ranks players are rushing gens, looping you, and getting those unhooks the second it's safe. The devs have done a good job bringing the balance closer together, but there's still a ton of killers that are bad at red ranks and thats frustrating.
---
Wow, i literally have the same results as old nurse, soo idk
---
This seems right, I feel like the devs take into account a lot of information and constantly tweak things to balance the game and incentivize fun ways of playing.  The game is still going strong because they do a good job of it and keep things fair and engaging.
---
I mean....sure! Lol
---
Not for shack mindgames
---
I believe it‚Äôs faster if you hold it down until your character pulls back, then release and hit again. If the ping is good it‚Äôs like you were never off. If you‚Äôre just tapping and letting go right away of course it‚Äôs slower though.
---
I gotta ask: Did you actually saw any of the scream movies? Like at all?
---
There are dozens of us. Dozens!
---
The infinity chin
---
Honestly, probably just try and get as many bloodpoints as you can ahead of time so you can get all the event stuff easily. Other than that, not much until everything comes out
---
Nah, right now people play whoever they like the cosmetics of. I played Nea for a while because I was a No0b fanboy, now I play Dwight because I like his cosmetics.
---
i hope society is the killer in that dlc
---
Dude, this entire video is amazing
---
ive seen maybe two or three people complain. I think theyre still stuck on it being called a "battlepass" when its actually the rift. they usually say something about pay to win, which it isnt, or grind, which is an optional payment to grind the extra stuff. other than that youre absolutely right. the devs did a great job with this and the few negative comments are outweighing the many positive comments, just like freddy.
---
Yeah I leave the 22nd for Japan and come back on the second so I‚Äôm basically screwed.

Who thinks their lung is long enough to reach Claud, reach claud
---
For every nice Claudette mains like us, there are 10 more immersed P3 Claudettes plotting to be the most toxic molecules we will ever see.
---
I can see coms really helping.  I guess I do get frustrated when people say the game needs to be balanced for those situations with four people who know eachother forming a little DBD club and trying really hard.  I don't see why I should be punished for what must be a minority way of playing (I never use coms, don't even have a headset).  And the fact we still have rank 1 killers in the game shows it's not an insurmountable or ubiquitous problem.  I guess if we had the data we can see if there are far more red rank survivors than killers and if this can be at all explained by survivors using coms.  I assume Behaviour has some data to that effect, and we don't, but their logic is always second guessed anyway.
---
I feel like a lot of people who mainly play killer aren't happy unless they get a 4k every time.

---

---
I play Ace because he looks cool. Most people are like that with their characters.
---
The only exceptions is Claudette. If somebody is running around in as Claudette in earth tones or prestige, it's just because they're an asshole who wants to be invisible.
---
Mostly, and for a perk I‚Äôd say devour hope, when somebody triggers a trap at the hook you can wait for the devour token, then teleport and still not waste the opportunity
---
Maybe they thought it would've been too stereotypical if Claudette was your typical nerdy white girl, and the black character was the one who could run really fast. Then again, F13 did exactly that with Vanessa.
---
Bro this is amazing, but like, why does everyone make suzie huge looking, her hoodie is just massive, shes the smallest one out of em all
---
Next killer is prob The Puppet
---
I don't tunnel unless they're just toxic to keep the game interesting. Much more fun imo to chase everyone than to just keep downing the same dude over and over
---
I'm sure there's something to this, a lot of times as killer you benefit from survivor mistakes.  I can see how people who know exactly when to do gens and exactly when to rush a hooked teammate could make quick work of generators.  But there's still ruin and NOED and blood warden and...
---
I would recommend playing killer to get more BP lol
---
I feel today people are blowing things way outta proportion. This post made me laugh though.
---
WAZUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUP

Don't camp? Is it possible? I mean, still waiting for a not camping hag...

Wraith: DESTROYED

Bill: Alive

Yeah, I'm only running this build on Freddy to combine with his addons that slow them down more. I'm a rank 1 killer/survivor and I've got a lot of hours logged. I'm just trying to find some new builds to slow the game down. Lately it just seems like gens are getting done so damn fast, it's insane.
---
How do u mean blown out of proportion
---
That isn't all.  If Borrowed Time procs and the person unhooked is hit they will be sent into dream and be put into Borrowed Time.  Since survivors are oblivious asleep, there will be no heartbeat and borrowed time will tick down even if Freddy is chasing you.  Essentially, the best effect you can get with Borrowed Time is the 20 or so seconds of it ticking down.
---
You can buy the cosmetics after the rift closes for the regular price of a cosmetic.
---
Any perks that reward extra bloodpoints will speed things up. We're gonna live forever for example is a good one
---
I‚Äôm asexual
---
I like PGTW, it really clutches late game when there's only 1-2 gens left. I've just been trying some new stuff out to try to slow everything down.
---
Charms are looking great!
---
Of course.
---
Okay. That's you, I wouldn't call you a casual for it
---
[Medkit changes ](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93849/)
---
Yeah pretty much this. I feel like all the complaints are unwarranted since you get your $10 anyways.
---
Maybe extending the DS timer during the actual run of the game, and making borrowed time not based on terror radius.
---
   but disabling them when the gens are finished, so that endgame feels more tense and risky
---
AMAZING stuff
---
Human beings can be such sore losers.
---
Lmao this killer biased sub trying to justify why MoM needed to be neutered
---
Did the 3 other Jigsaw boxes. Then when I tried to do the last one this happened. I even tried starting it over before the video started and that's when I got hooked. 
---
This really seems like something Amanda would do...
---
Well it is survivor sided because the game is literally unwinnable when you play an M1 Killer except Spirit (After the Nurse nerf) against even a Purple Rank SWF. Even the best of the best Red Rank Solos really really really give you a run for your money and that is where it is Survivor Sided.
---
To make this simple for you, here's what the ranks are: A low rank is 10-20, an okay rank is 4-9 and actually good ranks/players are 1-3. People can argue they're good/good enough when they're ranks 4-9 but if you were good enough you'd do enough each game to rank up, which you clearly do not do so their opinion is invalid because it is wrong.
---
The main problem about this game is solos who don't optimise their time and are scared of the Killer when they play the game. Actually good survivors do not give a shit about the Killer's terror radius (Unless it's a Spirit) and here's why: They have already planned an escape route, they know how far they can go doing the generator or totem or anything else, they know how to use their perks and when they should use them etc etc etc. If you play against shitters, oh sorry, anyone rank 10 or lower, they probably are scared when they hear the terror radius and will attempt to hide, poorly, and the Killer will get a hit and the Killer has done 50% of the job he needs to get that survivor.
---
Killer and Survivor is heavily heavily skewed in the ranking system. The name "Survivor" is already a fuck up on the devs part because tons of low ranks/new players feel that what comes with survivor is not facing the killer (Like a chase) and that stealth is their best option (Which it typically isn't). Killers at lower ranks can literally use no perks and stomp these shitters, sorry, low ranks.
---
Ranks 4-9 is like a purgatory for both Killer and Survivor, both sides do need to use perks but some are more than likely considered OP by one of the sides. For example, Survivors at this rank probably think Ruin is OP as they simply can't work through the gens without finding it. High ranks (1-3) not only find Ruin almost instantly, but they can still power through it and complete generators. This rank (4-9) is also the location in which you can play M1 Killers and pretty wim every match if you play well enough. This doesn't exist in ranks 1-3 and it shouldn't but at these ranks it does. Less Killers in this bracket also run NoeD and effectively no one runs it at ranks 1-3. But I guarantee tons of lower killers use it and the main reason survivors meet it is because they refuse to do totems/they're so incapable they probably don't know what a totem is.
---
These are but a few examples of how different the game is at multiple rank brackets and my statement here is simple. The game should and needs to be balanced around the top meta of the game because they are people who know the ins and outs of the game and can use everything to their limits. Because people can't or refuse to do it is *precisely* why they are not ranks 1-3.
---
Take Rainbow Six Siege as one Prime Example. Jaeger and Bandit were absolute NIGHTMARES for a good portion of the game due to their ability to have ACOGs (The best sight in the game) on defense on two of the modt powerful weapons on defense. This was only realised after the game was out for like 1.5 years after everyone overall was getting better and better (Just like this game) for mid-low tier games. Not every game had BOTH Jaeger and Bandit but the top of the game did because they may as well have been classed as "OP". So they had their ACOGs removed for the true balance of the game. Granted people lower down wouldn't have felt it because they may as well have been playing with their feet, but the top of the game did. And right now, Siege is in it's most balanced form. Is it truly balanced? I'd say no due to how powerful one of the new OPs is.
---
This exact analogy can be applied to DBD too.
---
It really is unfortunate. Main reason I just started playing Nea.
---
I know the PS4 community is toxic. I just don‚Äôt experience it that often.
---
Yeah it was impressive until I realized he purposefully deranks to play against mid and low ranked killers. Hes a scumbag.
---
Did you?
---
Omg, shut up. They literally already changed the hatch in the killers favor. They get to stomp it, then camp the doors 90% of the time. Sorry (SOMETIMES) a survivior gets to escape.

I play on both PC and Console but I only play on PC once a week. Ive noticed that in almost every PC match Im in, the killer tunnels or camps hard. Its rarer on PS4 but still happens a lot
---
Do totems and 99% doors. Which is what rank 1s do.
---
Oh, so it does give points when you stun them with it. I assumed, but never noticed the pop-up since I was too busy not dying.
---
I've started pairing it with inner strength. If they find me before I can heal, at least I can stun them.
---
Yeah hhahhaha sadly lot of toxic twa**s played as him and using broken addons.. and everyone started to hate them because of that.. and everyone shared the toxic builds on youtube..so yeah, feelsbadman
---
Wasn't he the narrator in all 3 of the Movie games?
---
I dont think so? I wanna say they only banned the ones who were killer but im not sure
---
Amen

---
Hatch just because it‚Äôs not as bad as it used to be doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs perfect. Also it‚Äôs very hard to get a 4K when the hatch is a 50/50 on who is going to find it first
---
Wait, you thought Army of Darkess, Evil Dead, and Ash vs. Evil Dead were just entertainment?
---
Nah, that was pure documentary. Unedited film.
---
What happens if the survivor doesn't even try to open it and just hides instead? The killer won't be able to trigger EGC and you are in a hostage situation. 
---
Hatch spawning at 5 gens is just a way **for the killer** to end the game, not a free escape for the 4th survivor.
---
I understand trapping the hook and teleporting back to it, but why do all hags trap the hook in 8 different places and then face camp?
---
I guess don't criticize their products
---
Go to my profile ;P
---
I play almost every night now on the Xbox. I'd say 5.5 out of 10 games have some kind of intentional "toxicity" in them. Stuff like: the killer dropping you near the exit and picking you up every time you get close to crawling out or on the other end...playing with other people that won't ever unhook/work on gens and solely hide. That's more so annoying than toxic, though.
---
It‚Äôs a free escape for the survivor basically. Also I said it‚Äôs not perfect but I think it‚Äôs better than just saying hey maybe you‚Äôll find it maybe you won‚Äôt
---
Okay and? Killers don't need a 4k every single match just like surviviors don't need to survive every match. How is that going to make it any different tho? What a extra few seconds to slide it open is going to make it different? That's just not a good idea. The hatch is fine, everyone wanted to close it and they got it. Quit complaining because occasionally someone gets out alive.
---
Don't criticize it if it helps Surviviors. If it helps killers oh boy get ready for part 76 of my 12th edition of my 190 part miniseries on why killers are toxic crybaby bitches.
---
I think the hatch should never spawn with 5 to 4 gens left they shoulda left it at 3. Destroying a team so early just so that last one gets a free escape even tho no objectives were completed is pretty lame
---
i totally agree
---
I find the lack of bubbas disturbing
---
I don‚Äôt even mind that the event doesn‚Äôt deviate from standard gameplay, it‚Äôs the length that definitely disappoints me. So many other games already have their halloween events up and running, and I‚Äôm meeting up with a long-distance friend from the 28th to the 1st, so I‚Äôm really not getting a lot of time to participate.
---
Seriously, what‚Äôs the excuse for the short length?
---
I play both Spirit and Plague. The only ppl I have DC on me are the crybabies that dc the second they go down. Usually they'll try to see how long they can survive against her. Then again I'm a rank 10 killer so naturally the survivors are all red rank Squadettes
---
Just a guess, but are you a Nurse main?
---
I mean, insta-heals just took a fat nerf right along side the Nurse so...maybe the wrong patch to try and call out bias on. Both sides just got hit pretty hard
---
Dont you mean anal beads?
---
they‚Äôre going to slowly rule 34 her themselves
---
Yeah I was a killer...
---
I was playing Plague, and the game started with only 3 survivors, which was already pretty weird.
---
But then I spawned in, and a Micheal was right behind me.
---
so deep wound is the name of the status you have when a legion hits you with his power, or any killer hits you while you have endurance. 
---
endurance is the name of the status you have that puts you into deep wound instead of dying state while a killer hits you. you used to only receive endurance from borrowed time, but now the addon will give you endurance as well.
---
A soul for a soul
---
They haven‚Äôt really made any besides the one I have in the corner
---
If no one reported then you should be fine. Save a video just in case you get banned so you can prove you didnt do anything
---
I really like this battle pass the people in this game have a tradition of bitching for no reason
---
Calmly go home.
---
Instaheals were broken regardless of context. Nurse at base kit was not a balance issue. Anyone who claimed otherwise was trying to play against her like she's Wraith and not like she's Nurse. 
---
Besides both instaheals are still incredibly viable and you could argue Styptic even got buffed.
---
This is just a stupid argument. First of all it‚Äôs almost impossible to double pip without getting a 4K. Also if the killer played good enough to the point where the survivors couldn‚Äôt get al the gens done and there‚Äôs only left I think since you know it is a game and the objective is to win that they should have a better chance than just pure luck.
---
O ok
---
Fucking unrealize it now
---
Except for the slowed down survivor and the narrower scratch marks
---
Not even pretty lady? I have the same bubba as you but hes the only NECA i got
---
abondend your humanity join the darkside
---
God damn it you were too late
---
I killed one person at least
---
Yeah I see that.
---
You were too late lol
---
I never understood why Survivors always complain that NOED is just a crutch for when killers fuck up but say nothing to decisive strike, adrenaline, self-care, and literally every other perk in the game that give Survivors a second chance.
---
Sorry man I had just finished playing a hag game myself when I saw this
---
It would be pretty cool but, sadly no
---
Get bw beach
---
It annoys me bein robbed of a 4k cuz someone didnt touch a gen anf hid the whole game waitin for hatch to spawn
---
Still doesnt stop some people from tunneling.
---
Lol it's okay
---
I don‚Äôt.the people that do that r just bad
---
Thank you for your support.
---
I love when I see these players- less guys doin' gens!
---
Not exactly. In the books it really explains. A true pennywise would never work because it would conflict with the lore overall
---
Its funny that a trapper with 3 good trap placements, an avarege IQ and Save the best for last can destroy a team with them so easily
---
Either you play killer and always suck or play survivor and always suck.
---
Can't wait for Project Resistance or Hunt Showdown on PS4. Great games that will finally replace DBD
---
&gt;Ohh my bad. Didn‚Äôt opened the game. Ty
---
You didn't have to. It has been posted in here, on twitter, on forums, on discord. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Michael Monroe
---
I was gonna say legion bc legion gang but since you already played legion, go with my boi Trapper
---
I wonder how this skin would've looked if they made it for susie and joey, I dont get the same vibes from them as I do from frank and julie
---
Yea so you just gotta take steps to ensure that. It might be just tuning them out.
---
Okay, and HOW is adding ANOTHER thing to the hatch going to make it more than a 50/50 chance?!?! It's STILL the same odds just another step. Lolololol,  that's why this whole argument is stupid. Um, guess what? Surviviors like to escape as well, because the game is for US as well, so yes we deserve a chance. Get over it. OUR objective is to escape, so boo hoo about not getting a 4k every single fucking game.
---
As someone that played the PTB:
---
Let's say you get to tier 5 while not owning the pass. When you buy the pass, you'll be given all the rewards up to tier 5 as if you had the pass the entire time.
---
Additionally, you can pay 1$ to unlock a tier if you're behind. So if someone _really_ wanted, they could buy the pass for 10$ and then buy the rest of the tiers for 69$
---
That being said, if you get to tier 70 and then buy the pass for 1k cells... Well, it's pretty much as if you paid nothing, as you'll get the 1k cells back immediately.
---
Endurance isn't stronger than one health state in this sense. If you see them consume a medkit, you can either assume they are gonna heal in 8 seconds or they aren't going to go down for 15 seconds. Either way, if you're worried about the endurance status effect that much, you can always pull them off of vaults to completely negate the addon since they have to pause to pop it off anyway, giving you time to get close and stick to their ass. 
---
Either way, regardless of what you think about the changes, there's an obnoxious influx of Insta heals. 3 matches in a row, there were at least 2 Insta heals at play, one with 4 even.
---
ItS nOt A lOsE iF yOu DiDnT kIlL mE
---
The problem is either you always 4K or always lose
---
Get Nurse's Calling from Nurse and buy Discordance since it belongs to a paid DLC. 
---
Farming 1.000.000 bloodpoints to level a character from 1 to 40 takes less time than farming 2.000 Iridescent Shards.
---
Well I mean they beat up his weaker physical form not the entity that he is
---
Monika can manipulate the games files and literally remove characters but Issa jjock
---
Lore and small rewards you unlock by doing challenges
---
I'd honestly would be scared to go against that thing. Every time he lands a hit you just hear that laugh across the map like the demogorgon
---
Oh, well I‚Äôm sure the entities could still kick pennywises ass
---
&gt;Endurance is stronger than 1 health state.
---
That's debatable.
---
Good suggestion and also nice to see another legion main
---
you could always unlock nurses calling by getting her to level 35
---
Never use one. Please. For the love of all that is holy please don't.
---
Wait what system are you?
---
Cause as long as you aren't on PS4 then go for it
---
if your still low rank you probally didnt see anything im also on ps4 and i see pepole going out of there way to private message heck one of them even used that bug where a private message make your ps4 turn off on me
---
That's odd. I haven't heard anyone else mention bugs like that. I know there used to be a bug even on peer to peer connection where some people would be unable to M1 in certain situations, like right after a nurse blink, but to have it happen while you're just chasing someone is weird.
---
Do you have uncapped FPS by any chance? That's been causing weirdness for people.
---
Honestly, if Pinhead is a killer I think the devs will have a seizure.
---
Considering Ardetha turned against what appears to be a "save Nurse" campaign forming in the forums, I highly doubt they'll listen.
---
Ya I agree I‚Äôd like it better than what it is now but sadly that‚Äôs a thing of the past
---
I love fungoose's streams/videos but he will almost always play meta perks and change up to billy or another strong killer if it looks like a swf. He is pretty tryhard but it goes with his channel. He is trying to always teach how to play. You can watch people clown with dumb perks on any other stream. Fungoose is the best streamer hands down.
---
I used to be a freddy main before the most recent rework
---
It‚Äôs possible but as for power it‚Äôs arguable they‚Äôre on a level playing field when reading lore on both
---
And the ‚Äútrue form‚Äù of penny often is similar to that of the entity

But the most optimal way to help your team is to spread out and do gens individually.

maybe like two or three years ago üíÄ

Okay sick. Thank you
---
Im on PS4. I use it once in a while. But I prefer fast recovery and charge time. I like to use her power as often as possible. Feels good.
---
Exactly. Way more killer favored and they still bitch. Basically we should just die and give them 4ks every match because you know that's their objective even tho ours is to escape.
---
Well first of all it gives the killer more of a chance to find it and THATS THE POINT it‚Äôs a game so both sides should get a chance to escape instead of someone hiding the entire game doing nothing then getting lucky and finding the hatch. But I‚Äôm done arguing with you because you are way to ignorant
---
Imma be real witchu chief, no idea who Ardetha is. Why are they notable?
---
Better question is why don't all versions ü§§ü§§ü§§
---
Altruistic Claudette Mains Gang, assemble !
---
Lol you were calm as hell I guess saying bruh means you're salty haha
---
If BT is a problem then killers should stop camping and maybe people will stop using it
---
Because you‚Äôre in Freddy‚Äôs world bitch.
---
He's a top level player who plays Nurse a lot. He put out a video talking about why he doesn't like these changes then he tweeted that he changed his mind and likes them.
---
Immediate death
---
I'm honestly more scared when a killer brings a black ward. If they bring a Mori then I can at least control control how long I last in a chase, if I get moried I get moried. An iridescent head huntress on the other hand, try as I might but she catches me on one little slip up, the chase is over and I'm basically fucked
---
I agree, I think it was fine as is, it did it‚Äôs job and that was preventing facecamping and tunneling one survivor until they‚Äôre sacrificed but I‚Äôm just a filthy survivor main so who knows
---
i like how he like harasses and baits the OP into responding (who is an obvious kid who is just venting) and then doesnt respond to me because he has no argument. 
---
His comments getting upvoted prove the insane killer bias on this subreddit. He can name numerous survivor buffs...when survivors have been getting straight up nerfs since Clown. 
---
And no one ever has an answer when I lay out to them that MoM wasnt really that OP. It was just bad design and a blatant cash grab attempt but no where near OP.
---
Entity Displeased
---
No because you bet the bonus bloodpoints by using the event offerings
---
I felt this when I was going for the platinum.
---
"Now I don't have to play the killers I'm not a fan of, I can actually play the game!"
---
I mean it's more the moderators fault for the bans not developers as they just work on the game and tries to do what's right also you should wait until it fully comes out as it could change and make nurse less sucky in some aspects
---
if you are low rank killer go with distressing thrill of the hunt bbq and chili and go with either ruin or the one that give extra point with huntress and run memes build that give extra point but only ONLY IF YOU ARE LOW RANK its 10 of the month and 3 days away from rank reset so the one you are going to meet are new players by using these builds you will give them a chance and u will farm points easily use doctar
---
BHVR: Here‚Äôs a killer idea! The fucknugget! How‚Äôs that? 
---
The fans:*silence*
---
BHVR: great! Well let‚Äôs roll with it!
---
Can you paste exactly what you said here? I‚Äôm not calling you a liar or anything, I‚Äôm just skeptical that you got banned for only being a little critical. I‚Äôve run into a lot of people on this sub who say stuff like ‚Äústupid devs banned me for no reason‚Äù and it turns out they‚Äôve been hacking the game or being racist in chat
---
Well if he‚Äôs really a top level Nurse player, I‚Äôd say he probably has a pretty good idea of what he‚Äôs talking about
---
This is so fucking ridicules. Freddy got so fucking buffed it wasn't even funny. He's now the 3rd best killer in the game. Especially with all the damn abilities he has
---
TTTHHHRRRREEEEE FFFFRRRREEEEZZZZEEEE
---
I'm way to ignorant? Have you ever played survivior?! As someone already said, it takes forever for the last person to die so if you aren't camping them you can find the hatch and camp it. If it hasn't spawned yet, you've already destroyed that team enough and they deserve one person to get out. Killers take shit way to literal, like omg we are a killer we must kill, yeah and we are SURVIVIORS we want to survive. We get the hatch as a extra attempt and it rarely happens anymore because it gets closed, and doors are EASILY camped. If you're having issues, maybe it's because if YOUR playstyle.
---
Disconnect
---
&gt;Endurance isn't stronger than one health state in this sense. If you see them consume a medkit, you can either assume they are gonna heal in 8 seconds or they aren't going to go down for 15 seconds. 
---
The average killer doesn't even play around BT or DS, let alone the new Styptic. Even if you do wait, 15s is enough time to get closer to the exit gates or another loop. PTB was specifically made to test the new instaheals and people there still weren't playing around it. 
---
&gt;Either way, if you're worried about the endurance status effect that much, you can always pull them off of vaults to completely negate the addon
---
If people slow / medium vault with Endurance, they have no idea what they are doing. 
---
&gt; since they have to pause to pop it off anyway, giving you time to get close and stick to their ass.
---
You can always pop it after a pallet drop or vault. 
---
&gt;Either way, regardless of what you think about the changes, there's an obnoxious influx of Insta heals. 3 matches in a row, there were at least 2 Insta heals at play, one with 4 even.
---
Syringe has been considerably nerfed, people have been stocking them for years and now they are using it before it becomes useless, like the Brand New Parts.
---
Validating Joey‚Äôs superiority one artistic interpretation at a time
---
No
---
if people like to lose its fine. I like being tunneled I get to play more of the game, since im chased for the full duration, if i fuck up its a short duration else I get to tell the story of "I looped a killer for 5 gens!"
---
Play Mikey, for the most part people enjoy playing against him (according to some polls I‚Äôve seen anyways). He‚Äôs strong but by no means op and genuinely fun to play. Playing without perks for a bit as you level him will also help you learn to play his base kit. Or switch to survivor if killing people is making you feel bad. No shame in that my friend, find what‚Äôs fun for you
---
You don‚Äôt see obsession until ds hits now
---
Stop with this shit already, post it on r/dbdgonewild
---
The timer has to be less than halfway because the end game collapse slows when the person is on the hook but you‚Äôre correct otherwise, unless the survivor got insta unhooked
---
&gt;That's debatable.
---
If you healed 1 heal state, you could still get chainsawed or NOEDed. With Endurance you are protected no matter what.
---
Tfw everyone's complaining about the change to borrowed time but you can't even find what the change was
---
I can already here him saying ‚Äúnyeh heh heh!‚Äù
---
So is that when the update will come out or will it be later
---
Nice outfit! &lt;3
---
He is my boi
---
Yes i did It! I made It a reality!
---
You do see obsession if there is a DS in game.  Obsession changes to new survivors if they DS you.
---
You have no idea how common it is for the last hook to be someone's first hook
---
Neutral
---
Can we get an option in the settings menu to just turn off the flashlight click noise. 
---
Plz BVHR, it's really fucking annoying
---
Yeah! Fuck you *looks at paper* Dante8411, you're the worst!
---
imagine you get hit and you just hear ‚Äúzoinks!‚Äù
---
Yeah but considering a lot of it is trash garbage its not too bad
---
"This was a lazy collection of add-on reworks designed to cover up a hamfisted nerf aimed at appeasing Surviviors who didn't want to take the time to learn to counter her. It's blatant favoritism for Surviviors and I'm shocked any developer had the thought in his mind that this was a good change"
---
Eh I kinda like it better now as it allows people not to feel left out if they missed the event but I can see why you'd like it not being purchasable as it feels good to having something exclusive that won't come out again.
---
Thanks! Now I need a good outfit for my main girl Feng Min.
---
&gt; because it takes forever for the last survivor to die and for it to open plenty of time for the killer to find it and if the killer finds it after you they still get to slam it shut before you can jump in.
---
OP is talking about hatch at 5 gens. You can't find it before the 3rd survivor dies.
---
Good intentioned but kinda nooby lol
---
Probably acid
---
I'm just hoping they eventually give us cosmetics killer-side for more than just the killer that you never get to see.
---
Totem and gen skins would be great and simple to implement
---
Don't worry! They probably won't be able to mindgame :D that's what I see at rank 1 anyway :/
---
why dont you ask him on his stream instead of venting on reddit
---
Top level =\= top in knowledge.
---
My evidence? Junkrat in Overwatch. Was disgustingly overpowered for patch after patch and high level players kept brushing him aside until they started playing him and realized "oh shit yeah he actually is OP"
---
For insta downs, Endurance is better. For anything else it is a side/straight downgrade.
---
I don't get the download I was just saying the company doesn't like being criticized
---
Because I've been banned from the forums for being too critical of this change. More specifically my statements were "inflammatory and unconstructive"
---
Keep in mind whispers is only worth using at level 3. At level three it works at 32 meters which is most killers terror radius. At lower levels though the perk has such a huge radius that survivors in it might not be close to you at all
---
Just absolute noobs or players that just mess around. I don't got really anything negative to say about Jakes
---
Are you playing on PTB or Live? Which killer were you playing against?
---
Survivor: James
---
I'm not gonna wait for shit. We "waited" while Mettle of Man was on the PTB and look at how that broke the game.
---
Billy is probably one of the best killers, I‚Äôd say if you really want to switch, I would try out ghost face. He has a high skill ceiling and is also (IMO) pretty fun to play... as a spooky boi myself.
---
Really it did not seem like that by his post. If that‚Äôs the case I still don‚Äôt see the issue sure it sucks when the survivor manages to find the hatch before you but you both have a chance only reason why it is what it is now is because killers wanted to be able to kick it so I honestly find it a good trade off in my opinion anyway
---
I like to play as an iron will, calm spirit Jake with dead hard and unbreakable. I like to slow play the killer, avoiding without getting in chases.
---
Well maybe if they stop making shitty decisions I'll stop criticising them
---
I want to say thanks to all the huntress make them suffer for my
---
Derailing a bit but can we expect the Nebula pack to receive this update soon? Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main who plays killer a tad bit so I would say yes I have. So what if the survivor takes some time to die that means the killer could have walked past the spawn point of the hatch or gone the opposite way of the survivor. Also the game as a killer is to kill everyone not to kill 3/4 people. Do you want us to let everyone survive. If you say that then that means at least one of the survivors should let themselves die and give the killer at least one kill. But I doubt you ever go hey we might be taking this to literally here have a free kill. Also luck isn‚Äôt a problem to my play style or others it‚Äôs luck
---
How did u reach rank 1 as those killers if games are unwinnable with them? And the devs have released statistics that show a pretty small percent of games are actually 4 man swf.
---
I play ghostface and I just DC when I see OoO there fixed.
---
Overly altruistic, not very good at chases so avoids them, loves gems but doesn‚Äôt like to be seen working on them, tries to be stealthy but for some reason can‚Äôt
---
I think they're all about the shity decisions, personally I've slowed down my playing because playing on PS4 has become insufferable waiting at least 10 minutes for a freaking match
---
what's this creature called?
---
Well I mean better to wait and collect your emotions and see how everything turns out then make a rash opinion atleast that's what I think but hey you do you I won't judge just don't insult the devs or anything.
---
YOU FORGOT THE POWER GLOVE!
---
*"MOM! MOM! BATHROOM!"*
---
Also, nice dead meat reference
---
I'm taking a break. They need to learn how to balance their game the hard way clearly. 
---
Fuck Blizzard. Fuck BHVR. Get your shit together guys. 
---
Riot games, I'm coming home. If you disappoint me I will actually start crying.
---
idk if this belong to r/ShitPostCrusaders or here
---
But do we have shirtless Suzy? Or Rin?
---
Oh okay, I don‚Äôt think this has anything to do with you calling it survivor sided.  It‚Äôs more that you criticized the devs and they‚Äôre human people who take pride in their work, so they got a bit upset. I don‚Äôt think you should‚Äôve gotten banned though, that‚Äôs a step too far
---
I‚Äôll be honest, when you said he was top level I assumed you meant ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs one of the best Nurses‚Äù, not ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a Rank 1 who can play Nurse‚Äù. My mistake. Regardless, all we can really do is wait til the live patch before we grab the torches and pitchforks. I‚Äôve faith in BHVR, if they insist on this Nurse change, there must be a reason other than ‚ÄúSWF bitched too much‚Äù, and if the change is particularly unpopular and unneeded, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be reverted
---
It‚Äôs because they are noobs and don‚Äôt know any better once you get to better ranks you will see killers that won‚Äôt do that
---
Camping is a shit move.
---
No problem
---
It‚Äôs a new status effect called oblivious. Survivors affected with oblivious dont hear the terror radius and are unaffected by perks that involve the terror radius. Freddy got buffed so anyone asleep in his terror radius (the lullaby) is affected by oblivious
---
I was playing on PTB and against Spirit. The other games weren‚Äôt like that, though (no others against Spirit).
---
No it‚Äôs not, that‚Äôs just toxic people
---
If they make bad decisions they're gonna get insulted. You don't learn by getting spoon fed the right answers. We don't need to be nice and hold the devs hands. 
---
We as a community were told there would be barely any change to Nurses base power and BHVR went back on that statement with no forewarning. At best an error in judgement, at worst a fucking lie. Either one merits some ridicule.
---
FRED KREUG IS LOVE... FRED KREUG IS LIFE
---
Again another time I need to repeat myself. There are simply unwinnable games at these ranks for Killers not called Spirit and Old Nurse (New Nurse is a GGs but yeah).
---
This means my simple minded acquaintance, that people who play these killers (Including me), have to endure losses as soon as the game fucking starts. That's not what I would call fair.
---
Spirit and Nurse are the only ones who have a chance every game. Which is what it should be like for every Killer. Yet people like you won't allow it.
---
&gt;Really it did not seem like that by his post. If that‚Äôs the case I still don‚Äôt see the issue sure it sucks when the survivor manages to find the hatch before you but you both have a chance only reason why it is what it is now is because killers wanted to be able to kick it so I honestly find it a good trade off in my opinion anyway
---
You are right. My brain for some reason thought OP was talking about 5 gens hatch because. Probably because he said "50/50" chance which isn't true, like you said it yourself. 
---
The killer can just roam around and find the closed hatch, camp it or just b-line towards it after hooking the 3rd survivor.
---
I bet youre the type to teabag and click flashlights too? Its an OoO syndrome
---
There's like 4 pages of PTB feedback basically praying that BHVR reverts the change.
---
Spirit is a wonderful killer to play and go agianst. Provided she doesn't have those damned beads :(
---
Then we‚Äôll see what they do
---
Clownfaceagueilly
---
Well they can eat it. 
---
You make shitty decisions and people are critical of you for it. That's not me being a dick, that's life. They need to grow some thicker skin
---
r/cursed_dbd
---
Yup that‚Äôs why OP post confused me for a second starting it was 50/50 lol
---
Adept Bill
---
oh? go figure I stand correct if the leak is legit after all
---
I didn't say you called them any of those words more so saying if you feel angry at the devs then you shouldn't say them and be nice about. For the nurse changes all I gotta say is maybe they think it is minor to them idk.
---
The cosmetic are technically 8-9$ and you get 1100 auric cells , I‚Äôve always liked their pricing
---
It doubles the timer. 
---
So from 2 minutes to 4.

---
If everything goes on track the update will release with the event on the 22nd.
---
Did they keep shining the flashlight on you? 
---
Bc they can do that to extend the blind
---
Okay, as you said it goes both ways SOO guess what 50/50 odds is fucking fine. Quit ALWAYS finding something to bitch about. I play killer as well, and don't cry my eyes out if one person gets out because I know how it is playing survivior. You don't always deserve 4 kills because we wanna escape to. That's the point to balance.
---
Camping is a dick move but it's also an ineffective one
---
that is pretty cool
---
also if you od not have the blinks down I think the one offering that shows you the location you will go with the blink is now a brown offering
---
"About an hour a day" using match time only and not queue time
---
I know, right?! The one time they add a 10/10 trapper skin, it's a Nintendo Switch exclusive
---
Fun to play at times but probably one of the weakest killers in the game. If you‚Äôve ever went up against a legion you‚Äôll find yourself mending a lot which can be very boring. But honestly just have fun with him
---
Sadly, they probably dont have the licence for freddy. As for leatherface, well im just not sure.
---
Well fuck, didn't even pay attention to or know about that. That just makes it even better.
---
I feel like each side got nerfed p evenly, another one of survivors best items/addons got nerfed (not complaining, the changes are good and make the game healthier) and nurse got "Nerfed". The nurse didnt get her base kit changed much, it just keeps people from spamming blinks. The addon change is amazing bc she has addons like wraith now which make her practically a new killer
---
knowing our luck a glitch will happen and make us not get the cells back lol
---
I got that a couple times today, I was still able to play the game normally though
---
Alright, thanks for the info, see y‚Äôall in the fog!
---
It‚Äôs not even that much of a grind. An hour a day will guarantee completion.
---
Last time I got called a lagswitcher was the funniest thing because I simply replied something like "yes I want to win so bad I play Legion". Even while all pissed off he was like "you got me there."
---
Doc or Legion with BBQ and distressing. BP for dayyyyyyyzzzzz
---
*DC's
---
I guess it's too bad she's gonna rely on certain add-ons to be anywhere near how she is currently without them. 
---
Srsly she's just falling into the same add-on reliant trap that every other killer is in. We need less add-on reliant killers, not more of them..
---
[NEWS | WITHERING BLIGHT EVENT OVERVIEW](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/93854/news-withering-blight-event-overview#latest)
---
Did it at least give you the add-on?
---
Do you ever get annoyed when you get matched with green ranks?
---
Well, people wanna use em until there changed? what do you expect lmao? the changes are healthier for the game and there not as broken, oc people are gonna use em before there gone, bc they wont ever see them like the way they are rn.
---
It's called perfection
---
What is that abomination on the left
---
I made this same post and got shit on. Just wait for your downvotes because "ExClUsIvE cOsMeTiCs ArE bAd"
---
1) Nurse Nerf isn‚Äôt that bad
---
She‚Äôs been consistently an S-tier killer as long as I can remember although you have to be very mechanically skilled, under the right hands you are practically always guaranteed a 4K
---
2) Moderators/Developers 
---
Moderators and developers work on two different subjects and never have their jobs intersect.
---
Thanks
---
Definitely! I started playing Legion just to farm BP and pretty soon I found myself going against red ranks and the game got super challenging suddenly haha
---
I have just witnessed god itself.
---
the computer i game at IS the family computer.
---
Sloppy Butcher. I've never heard of anyone else running it, but I swear the Mangled effect has made entire trials in my favor
---
no, they cant extend the blind the whole game xD.
---
i first thought that was until i was blinded for more than 5 minutes
---
"Do YoU wAnT uS tO lEt EvErYoNe SuRvIvE" 
---
No, no I don't but this coming from the person CRYING they did not get to kill ALL four surviviors. Like. Shut. The. Fuck. Up.
---
Spirit has the Ghost face problem. The killer is fun to play AS. But against, its just a pain.
---
She will be nerfed, and thank god for that
---
Oh in that case yeah that's a glitch. I thought you meant like they blinded you for longer than normal but u still recovered.
---
It's okay to be wrong
---
They're adorable. And if they don't T bag or flashlight click they usually get to escape. 
---
Baby Jake's are also the most adorable thing on the planet. Srsly if you get a baby Jake, protect him at all costs.
---
What she lacks in stomach she makes up for with A S S
---
Yikes....
---
Ig its a little dumb, but like... Its a cosmetic for myers. 
---
This opens up so much in terms of future cosmetics
---
I T-Bag to draw attention away from others but yeah it often gets me more than I bargained for.
---
I know that this is probably NEVER EVER gonna happen but, a man can dream, right? 
---
I wanted a FNaF killer, because I love Scott Cawthon and his Creations and I dont see a reason of why one of the characters couldn't be in the game other than lore, where they would have to confirm stuff, which Scott doesnt like but idk
---
No mither is such a controversial perk lmao
---
I see you are also of the culture
---
Ah yes the I have no valid argument so I must use my emotions and try to mock him. Very clever!
---
Im pretty sure she is gonna still be top tier, or if not, high tier at worst
---
Yeah I never got ‚Äòtryhard‚Äô in any gaming context. No game would be fun with put challenge and I want to know my opponent is giving his best so I can feel accomplished when I win. I‚Äôve never understood hating on someone for doing all they can to win.
---
There are some ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô play styles in DBD, but ‚Äòtrying hard‚Äô isn‚Äôt one of them.
---
The boards are notoriously bad. For a game about murder, violence and sacrificing the boards are pretty much walk on eggshells or you'll get banned. It's nuts.
---
Many of the mods are also mod for various twitch streamers so they'll get their own private 'defense force' along with the Fog Whisperer discord where streamers can petition BHVR to ban people they don't like. So yea, the forums, the official discord, and the steam discussion boards are all fairly worthless in terms of actually being able to have a discussion. 
---
Reddit has its own problems, but they are least not directly connected to BHVR so they don't have to kowtow to them. You're allowed to have pretty much any opinion you want, as long as it doesn't violate the sidebar rules.
---
Ghostface has more counterplay in his kit than any other killer. How is he a pain to play against?
---
I tried not hitting any skill checks the first time but it regressed to like 10% and Piggy showed up. I just gave up and tried to at least hit one invisible one. :shrug:
---
I don‚Äôt get the mindset of toxic survivors that get mad about their made up rules on how killers should play the game to help them win.
---
Mysteries all around.
---
Wow, what made that possible?  Could killers not vault and were killers slower/no bloodlust or something?
---
Does anyone here remember Friday the 13th? Last Year? Soul At Stake? Evolve if you reach out to all asymmetrical games no matter the genre.
---
DbD is on top and one of the main reasons is due to a lack of competition. 
---
(I was so looking forward to last year but it ended up being a mess on arrival.)
---
Needs a proper rework, while legion can be incredibly dangerous in the right hands (granted that can be said for any killer) their ability is pretty much just a first hit tool with some tracking mixed in, it‚Äôs basically useless against injured survivors 
---
Still, if you like high speed theyre fun to play, legion just isn‚Äôt in a good spot right now
---
It's not even that, it's just that it's an absolute banger of a skin but I can only use it on the Switch
---
Oh yea i def agree, addons shouldnt make or break a killer, i think addons should change the base kit to be more wacky and fun instead of being something that is just an insta win.
---
I dont think addons should be one of the first things you equip, i wish they would be more of 2nd thoughts. 
---
I dont think she really needs addons since the recharge is good, i think a good change would be to make it so if she is in chase she re charges at the speed she does normally right now, but if she is out of chase she re charges quicker to give her more map control
---
It isn‚Äôt exactly like trapper mask but the design is based off it. Just look up feng min trapper mask and you‚Äôll find. Tried providing link but apparently against rules here
---
Yeah, he's not a stealth killer, but oblivious effects the survivors when they're asleep
---
I‚Äôve noticed sometimes if you button mash too fast it won‚Äôt register some of the taps (or at least I speculate this is what it is because I‚Äôve been tapping) 
---
It‚Äôs very rarely happens to me and when it does I know it‚Äôs not bc the clock ran out and it wasn‚Äôt bc of my button pressing. 
---
Maybe there are perks that give you less time??? Not sure.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm starting to regret buying him/her now lol
---
It‚Äôs been consistently happening to me and my friends and as you‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs annoying especially when trying to rank up
---
I‚Äôve said it before the killer is based off of what you want. I like Myers because he stalks to get benefits plus I am really good with him. But it‚Äôs up to you what you want to do
---
You still depip (stupidly) since there was no possible way you could touch gens or save/heal someone. And if you end up dying the highest Unbroken emblem you can get is silver.
---
A ding ding ding.
---
A ding.
---
When they inevitably release cross progression I‚Äôm sure you can use that skin on other platforms.
---
I LOVED Zombie Master and played it to death. Too bad L4D killed it because it was the superior game
---
I‚Äôm so tired of face camping
---
We can tell they won‚Äôt be getting anything in the foreseeable future since the license holders didn‚Äôt even negotiate for them to be on Switch. I knew something was going to happen when Myers and everyone else was available on Switch and mobile unlike them.
---
Don't, just because a killer is weak doesn't mean it can't be good, just enjoy playing it and try to overcome it's weaknesses with a bit of smart thinking. He's a power machine with meme builds
---
I agree with this statement Myers is the most balanced never updated killer. Spirit is absolutely horrible.
---
Killers were slower in vaulting, and there were more windows close to each other apparently. I didn't play the game back then so I have no idea. It seems pretty unfun though from the footage in the video.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm so tired of face camping
---
I never leave home without DS and BT specifically because of camping.
---
My second ever game with him I double piped, I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs terrible just not that good
---
They're pretty much Quentins but toxic more often Quentin mains are the least toxic and most chill players in the game, so the Quent-oxicity scale goes from 0pH as a low, and 10pH as a high. Jake mains range from 5pH to 40pH. The most common Jake mains are around 15pH. The most toxic survivor, Meg, ranges from 500pH to 800pH, with the most common being 750pH.
---
So, with all this information out of the way, Jakes are usually chill toward the Killer and a good teammate. Most are mid-upper tier on an Altrustic scale. 
---
Tl;dr, most are chill people, but not as chill as Quentins.
---
Imma suck them Myers toes
---
But he‚Äôs what? C‚Äômon don‚Äôt leave me hanging I have work in the morning I can‚Äôt keep waiting.
---
So is she a toxic, teabagging click click survivor or is she a blendette who crouch walks around the map and sits on hatch while her teammate dies? Or is is that she can be both and it doesn‚Äôt matter the character skin you use it‚Äôs truly just who‚Äôs behind the controller.

No not all video games are like this and no I don't think behaviour is anywhere near this insidious it's a very ubiquitous marketing tactic not only does it draw hype (which I think is the reason why they did this) but as as I said before it does cause people to impulse buy.
---
I gave you two stepping stones it's actually a very interesting topic if you delve into it. Some systems like loot boxes can also be used to affect this. However if you're the of type of person who just laughs off these problems there's really no point explaining it to you
---
Ah yes. One or two players beating survivors totally outbeats everyone else's opinion
---
Well the most simple and sensible option would be to learn Nurse so Pallets mean nothing.
---
Or run Enduring + Spirit Fury but that'd be crazy.
---
Doesn't that nullify his "stealth" by telling you whenever he's nearby with a perk icon
---
Oh cool another tunneling mori with only 1 gen done
---
As a survivor main I feel as if there should be an option to report killers for face camping and they should receive a reduction to blood points and wont be able to rank up for 24hs and in order to stop people just using it whenever they dont win a system should be in place to tell how long the killer stayed within a 10 meter radius of your hook and how frequently they are near your hook and based on these two factors the game will determine weather or not the penalty should be in affect and another system to make it so that if a survivor uses the report button too many times he will no longer be able to use it for 24hs
---
They'd probably be able to do it for Bubba (his Survivor masks being an indicator) but likely not Freddy.
---
Place down the phantasm traps in places you think the survivors will likely run thru like pallets when they go to loop or near generators maybe near hooks if you just hanged somebody but it's debatable if they will take the bait or not.
---
Spider-Man just stole Dwight‚Äôs pizzas!!
---
I can‚Äôt hit DS for shit so I never bring it. Luckily my team mates were so good they did the gens when i was looping the Legion and unhooked me for escape
---
This is amazing! Nice work !
---
Yea, generally Claudettes are just meta players who are using her because she gives the most infinitesimally small advantage with her build and color.
---
8 survivors*
---
I saw an interesting theory once, that rin's dad's company that he worked at developed parts for trains, and due to him being overworked, it led to poor design of a train part, which was the reason Adam's train derailed
---
edit this to say ‚ÄúBHVRs response‚Äù
---
I love these so much haha
---
Bites the dust
---
I‚Äôm well aware of tactics like this. And like you said, you don‚Äôt think BHVR is ‚Äòinsidious‚Äô enough to do crap like that.
---
So again, what is the serious problem?
---
Do stab wound chart and filthy blade
---
Smooth like a Ken doll I‚Äôm sure
---
I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one still haunted by his laugh
---
Speak for yourself. Imagine being so triggered by a meme üòè
---
Like a fucking badass? I don't think so
---
Heisenberg
---
I'm not going to see one if I'm playing bubba. I swear they avoid me.
---
right???? it‚Äôs way more fun watching the survivors get all scared when you practically jumped at them.
---
That is an experience that stays with you for the rest of your life.
---
100% of it is behind a paywall unless you got the game for free. So...
---
*calls your manager*
---
I see a lot of killers that make the argument that they get penalized bc everyone else works on gens. However I feel due to the nature of the game not allowing mic chat (I know some people use discord) this is an unfair generalization. People won‚Äôt always know if the killer is camping AND not everyone knows to gen rush a camper. 
---
I just don‚Äôt see as much of a negative side for killers face camping which is why they continue to do it. 
---
Imo if they can nerf pallets. Survivor perks. Other things. They can at least have some sort of blood point penalty for camping to discourage people from doing it but not unbalancing the game mechanics
---
Feng should be SS+ Tier
---
Remember, these are based on my experiences
---
$45ish for the base game, Ghost Face, Bubba, and Nightmare on Elm Street
---
Yeah, but their design was still kinda BS. Once they found someone there was NO escape
---
Yeah i was gonna put her in red but i missed
---
how pathetic lol.  
---
*hides his shit pan behind the desk*
---
From a solo players perspective and someone who can loop and mind game optimally, it‚Äôs quite sad my escape %. Maybe 1/5 or 2/6 games are escaped. But when I play killer at rank 1 it‚Äôs relaxing af and I haven‚Äôt lost a game  in forever... it‚Äôs cancer playing survivor, but it just isn‚Äôt satisfying playing killer.
---
Also, Laurie was supposed to be in "barely toxic", not " Not toxic at all"
---
Honestly I think people overreact to ‚Äúteabagging‚Äù and ‚Äúflashlight clicking‚Äù like if that‚Äôs toxic get over yourself. So many killers camp now so it‚Äôs warranted imo. 
---
I personally don‚Äôt do it bc I don‚Äôt feel the need but I see why it happens sometimes killers can be just as ‚Äútoxic‚Äù in order to promote this behavior
---
Served that invisible cunt right.
---
Exactly. I play both survivor and killer (\~60-40 split) and have a shit load of play time. But lately it seems like the gens are just getting ran through so damn quick. Even if I find survivors and have short chases with them, it's still like I don't even have enough time. It's wild.
---
On the other hand that Nurse, Billy and Spirit seems to give zero fucks about any of that. Map control and everything they have including perks and addons ruin the game for survivors (that solo queue most times).
---
I don‚Äôt think Pallets should be nerfed. Its the only defense survivors have and if you as a killer can‚Äôt mind game around pallets or break them, its your lack of skill and fault imo. When I say ‚Äòyou‚Äô i don‚Äôt mean you specifically; I mean all killers that complain about Pallets. DS I can get to a certain degree but tunneling is why DS is required.
---
Who thinks their lunge is long enough to reach Claudette, Claudette*
---
Didn‚Äôt somebody post a concept for slender man a while ago? I saw it and it looked alright
---
Mad grit is situational but fun as hell when it works, few things are as entertaining as 4K‚Äôing an SWF cause they‚Äôre all trying to body block you but
---
yeah il be the one who is doing the stalking
---
1. This was great
---
2. Should we focus on the test build battle pass or should we wait till it gets officially released
---
Well I mean the one petal things so you get more nectar and the unique items for survivors in the bloodwebs
---
Ditto
---
Bill: ight imma head out
---
Bill was an exclusive on PC for how long?
---
What people fail to understand is that BHVR needs money for licenses. Things like that cost money. We should support them, as long as they keep showing good intentions. This rift pass can only be good for us and for them. Besides, the $10 is more than worth it compared to a few other things in-game, like Amanda‚Äôs, dare I say, overpriced skins.
---
Jeff is related to the Legion 
---
The lore mentions thaf Jeff used to own a shop where he would take art comissions.
---
Someone from the Legion came one day into his shop and asked for a mural of their logo in Jeff's style (which can be found as a detail on the upper floor of the building on the Mt. Ormond map)
---
Have you ever seen (lol) a corner crouching P3 Claudette on Macmillian? She's practically impossible to see. The advantage is huge.
---
"Good and balanced design, amirite?"
---
The problem is it doesn't matter how insidious a company is.
---
People who fall under the umbrella of this problem that you think is so funny tend to be susceptible to it no matter what the actual company's intent is.
---
However you cannot protect the person from their own life decisions but you also can't prevent someone from questioning certain business practices. Just because I know they're actually good people and not insidious enough to use this doesn't mean I can't question it. 
---
They technically still have one collection on the back burner so releasing it two weeks early is something I find confusing. 
---
When it would have probably made more sense to release that collection and then released this collection with a week left. It would still fill out the gap, it would keep the hype more relevant it has less time to dissipate and it would somewhat reduced the knee-jerk impulse buying.
---
As for being mad about behaviour making business tactics I have defended them several times when it comes to people complaining about certain issues for example how the pigs cosmetics was slightly more expensive than anything else.
---
Hell if you want the link to that I can show you that as well.
---
Yall haven‚Äôt even brought up the Xbox that is a pretty toxic place.
---
About 2 years
---
It‚Äôs not like you can get the Deathgarden masks on console or switch.. so.. seems fair.
---
He‚Äôs not anymore so I don‚Äôt see what point you are making. Also this is after the devs said no more exclusives. Just my opinion anyway
---
My first match yesterday I was chased by a clown with a cool skin. I was excited to finally go against a clown. I ran him through a few loops and he missed his bottles. After slamming a pallet on his face for a second time he Dc'd :(
---
Off with his pants!!
---
The point was he WAS exclusive, they can always release the skin later. Besides. DG masks..
---
A lot üò≠
---
It should guarantee either green or purple medkit
---
Nice karma farming over a shitty dead meme from,2 months ago. I wish the sub wasn't full of complete,circle jerks
---
Guess that could one day happen who knows
---
Saving this so I can come back and see how it will turn out!
---
I‚Äôm glad I wasn‚Äôt the only one who seen it
---
If it makes you feel better I'm indifferent about spirit cause it mostly reminds me of wraith gameplay.
---
I had a scummy Rank 2 Trapper last night that tried 1 hooking me in the basement with several gens up.  Never left his Proxycamp  once.  I got saved and went right in the locker knowing he'd come right back which he did ignoring the people he hit that saved me coming out of the basement.  He knew I was in the locker and thought he'd be clever by waiting my D Strike out then setting a trap in front of it.  I Head On'd him mid set animation and was fucking outtie.  It really is godlike for escaping the basement against infants like that.
---
Oh no I agree 100% I‚Äôm a survivor player and if a killer gets looped it‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt know which way to go. The killer runs faster and could easily win if they were strategic to mind game. 
---
Some maps needs more pallets and also the indoor maps SUCK for survivors. It‚Äôs so hard to find the gens and it‚Äôs not open enough for chases and trying to evade the killer enough to actually have a chance to get stuff done
---
Yeah, but when you are a killer main and you play this game everyday, it kind of gets to Ya.
---
I don‚Äôt really waste that much time getting tokens tho. I can end a chase really quick with the bell.
---
Tokens would give Killers a watered down Night Shroud, which might be nice. Can you imagine a Tombstone Myers with Undetectable status?
---
Honestly, for me Legion is legitimately one of the least fun killers to go against.
---
I guess screw Steve &amp; Nancy.
---
Is it not in the game at all? I was under the impression it‚Äôd just be a general perk.
---
I mean I get it. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt do it. But I think the killer community has inflicted some of this upon them selves due to the high number of face campers and such (not saying you do this) and it‚Äôs unfortunately but the survivor vs killer community is just so divided and this is the result of those things happening for the most part
---
Yeah but it's on meg so it's all good
---
It beats the purpose of it then
---
Waking up
---
I don't think he really minded, he would've downed you again if he really wanted the kill
---
I mean, he IS insane, of course he runs Dead Hard.
---
Balanced
---
Meg AND Trapper
---
I'm gonna use the Secret Joestar technique.
---
Trapper has the potential to have extremely satisfying games, and he‚Äôs the OG killer.
---
You ganna delete this err
---
We crouch in a terror radius.
---
Awesome, thank you!
---
Could be shown as proof that you bought the game for the Switch, even if you're not playing it at that moment
---
Wanna hear another joke Nea?
---
What do you get when you cross 4 toxic survivors with flashlights who teabag at every pallet and body block
---
You get what you fucking deserve 
---
Noed* Mori* 4k*
---
Yeah but at that point I'd have to buy the game for a third time including a completely separate game as well so I'm all good
---
She was already pretty dead on consoles, this is probably the final nail in the coffin
---
Its because ive never seen P3 Nancy nor Steve and this list is based off my experiences sooo.
---
Nah if I prestige all the characters I dont have nothing to do and I will stop of play
---
How would he have done that? Haha
---
I pulled the pallet infront of him, ran away, he broke it and chased me in cloak and was uncloaking at the exit
---
Thanks for the advice
---
Switch the bottom two tiers and it‚Äôs spot on for me.
---
People dont bitch about insta heals almost at all tho, and no one has ever seriously used that as an argument...
---
Dweet is the same good boy in the lore as he is in the game.
---
Just call him the Cenobite. Easy.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Or Hell Priest, Or Hellraiser. Honestly Pinhead has a few easy picks for a "the" title.
---
they literally dont though, is the thing.
---
oh god
---
once I  got
---
‚ÄúIll kill u fr‚Äù
---
‚ÄúXbox isnt life‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIll takee yours and smile at your mom‚Äù
---
I feel kind of bad for that Huntress. There's probably so much going on through her head. If she goes to pick you up, maybe DS. Or your teammate might come over and pallet stun while she picks you up. Poor thing. Also, nice play!
---
I agree 1000%
---
I mean her traps (as I recall) were impossible to get out of.
---
Obviously all Killers are weak Vs even a rank 5 SWF except for Spirit and Nurse^TBD. There are points in which some of the best Solo Queue survivors in Red Ranks do give Spirits/Nurse's a run for their money. I mainly see that when I play Survivor, not as Killer as I barely play Spirit and I feel that everyone just potatos vs my Nurse. However when you watch people like Tru3, you see the *real* power of survivors, even when they're mostly solo (Like a 2 man SWF with 2 solos). Survivors up there are really that good. People who don't think they are, are either low rank or have a survivor god complex and went them to have easy escapes every game.
---
How about another joke?
---
Play asshole games, win asshole prizes.
---
Once you enter a locker (rushed or otherwise), wait 3 seconds (until you see the perk icon in the lower-right corner light up). To stun the Killer, do a rushed exit (hold shift and press space) when the Killer is close enough to the locker you are in.
---
Remember that you cannot use it once you have an idle crow (in a locker, this is shown as a crow perching on top of the locker you are in).
---
Here's the bottom line: How old is this game? How much has it evolved since launch?  
---
If you value the gameplay of the game and the time the devs have sunk into it, there's no problem with giving them a bone.  
---
From their standpoint, they have other examples like (sigh) FortNite, SMITE, and Apex: Legends to look at for ideas about how to make their microtransactions have less feel-bads. I genuinely think that they're doing a battlepass because they think it's what players want, and because it could stir more interest up for the game, (and that benefits us all with shorter queue times.)  
---
If you think this is the wrong direction to move in, that's fine, and you should put your money where your mouth is by purchasing the cosmetics the regular way. If you think this is a great move and want to see more, put your money where your mouth is and buy the pass. They're going to be doing market analysis along the whole route to see if this is successful, so you'll be quite literally voting with your dollar.  
---
I'm still fairly new to the game, so for me personally, I'm just thankful to the devs for pouring themselves into this game so that I ever had a chance to play it. (The Friday the 13th game is dead already, and it was a fully licensed and enfranchised IP, if that tells you anything.)
---
Does anyone do custom perk skins here? Cause I think you‚Äôre thinking what I‚Äôm thinking

Is that on a particular survivor? I havent come across it yet? I been running meg, feng, amd bill
---
Im excited for the pass btw
---
although thats the big if. you also get lightbringer, 33% of the gen other people work on while on chase. Its not a stupid depip, you got tunneled and werent able to live through it, as unlucky as it may be, thats the game. Losing is part of the game.  3 others would have more chance to pip up.
---
Personally, i think that if someone you rescued during EGC successfully escapes, you should get either a burst of Altruism or a burst of Survival points(or both)
---
Would encourage more people to try for endgame collapse rescues where the killer is most likely going to camp them.
---
Maybe he was on his last hook and wanted to bait the other survivor to heal. Probably not though or he would be invisible.
---
U don't like slightly nude Myers?
---
Thanks I‚Äôll try it out
---
Maybe you just can't see them... Cause they are blendettes
---
If you want something un-unique you could use one of the many other skins that are on all the consoles. It‚Äôs uniqueness gives it more value than being... just another skin. Things like that are usually done to incentivize activity on the system, I don‚Äôt play much Trapper but I love to on Switch purely because I have the cool skin. Same reason people went to PC for Bill before they opened him up to consoles.
---
I thought people hate her because she's literally invisible, immersed and does not contribute? Cuz I'm sure that the clicking bitch is Nea...
---
The Rabbit? (Springtrap would probably be the best killer to appear in DBD from FNaF but idk)
---
Laurie Strode has it, from the Halloween chapter. You have to buy the chapter with money or wait for the perk to show up on the shrine of secrets
---
Had a Laurie DC when I was playing killer... She was running object... Either be good at looping, or dont use object and dc when you fail
---
First time I heard it I thought it was dwight
---
Well, it IS supposed to be a sort of jokey insult. If that was said in a conversation it would absolutely be taken as a joke and not an insult unless the person recieving the "insult" is thin-skinned.
---
Yeah Burt
---
This was literally like 7 or 8 mins into the game lol
---
I-
---
Time has nothing to do with anything.
---
If it keeps Surviviors off gens for longer than .25 seconds I'm all for it. There needs to be a second objective
---
Just like every other edge lord
---
I'm pretty sure you can even finish the free track and then get the premium and it'll just give you everything
---
i'm sad to admit that this happen so often that it's sickening
---
When he talked to you were you uhh shitting in the tall grass?
---
I stay around rank 3-4, get the rank 1 killers and get the rank 8 killers. PS4 too and I get a lot of variety so I recommend those levels tbh
---
She's hibernating
---
I got all tier 3 perks on my P3 Dwight last week and I can say this is how I felt
---
*unzips*
---
Am I the only one who doesn't like this cosmetic?
---
That throat is disgusting, and not in a good way.
---
Please don't
---
Any chance the United States is Included
---
Please tell me how teabagging and crying helps survivors win. I‚Äôm super interested.
---
*Slurp slurp* say what?
---
**no**
---
Never seen that survivor before?
---
50 50 i think you dont keep it
---
so randoms aren't adding me or something? it's my psn name which also has a part of my real name in it lol
---
"The wise penny"
---
Ya know, no one ever complains about how some things will give you backer exclusive rewards.  That's really the same thing here.  You give some extra money and get a neat thing from it.  That's just like backer rewards.  It's really not that big an issue.
---
Ahh, so rare. But yeah OoO is too powerful. If survivor has a spirit nurse version. Its OoO
---
Nothing's changed
---
Honestly it sounds like you need to take a break and I mean that in a respectful way.  Dead by Daylight wasn't a $60 game so I didn't expect anything huge getting into it.  I understand that the developers want to expand it and I believe they are, but since it's not a full fledged extremely popular game, I don't expect a ton personally. 
---
I play this game in bursts with friends and then take long breaks to prevent myself from getting entirely worn out.  My only issues are community toxicity which unfortunately cannot be alleviated, and solo queuing as survivors due to incapable teammates.  But again, that also can't be alleviated really, as it entirely depends on the player base. 
---
I don't mind the microtransactions, as I've bought a few outfits myself personally.  It's just another method of supporting the game to me, although I would suggest they add more free, perhaps earned, basic cosmetics and then lock the fancy stuff behind paywalls.  Like how in Rainbow Six Siege, every cosmetic can be earned besides the super fancy Elite Skins that must be bought with real money.
---
Can't tell if this is serious or just a poorly executed joke.
---
Missed the 7 on my mobile keyboard
---
Always love seeing cosplays! Keep us updated!
---
How is the battle pass meaningful progression? It's literally just cosmetics, auric cells and charms. And there is a free track. It would be different if the archives were behind a paywall but they aren't. You don't gain anything that is beneficial to actual game play. Unless the charms actually do something other than being an accessory.
---
Plus, if all the chapters and characters were given out for free the company wouldn't make any money. They aren't all that expensive either. They are $12/13 where I live. They only reason I have all of them is cause I waited for them to go sale. Which seems to happen often, especially around the next chapter release.
---
This isn't like EA where you have to pay outrageous amounts of money on Sims expansions.
---
I thought Last year looked cool, just never got around to it because it was on discord and I don‚Äôt see a reason for it being exclusive there
---
okay, there is something more important I understand there was a set of swings also using a shovel would be a good idea since the wings made of wood !!
---
the clicky clicky will get sticky sticky
---
With the username "FILTHY CREATURE" or something like that. I'm glad I haven't been seeing any of those people lately though
---
she didnt earn it anyways. 2 AFK crows lol
---
Jesus what is ur camera movement what the fuck do u even own a mouse!??? This made me vomit
---
Get actually fucked though.
---
i think some killers have good enough builds for rank 1. Omega blink nurse, iridescent head huntress, turn add on or insta chainsaw billy, scream for me meyers. spirit every game gets old and im sure it does for the killer too
---
Since they added medium vaults
---
Adam is good for deliverance, Laurie for decisive
---
The fact that I‚Äôm seeing more no mither all of a sudden is not epic
---
Attuned hearing would be cool also if it activated when:
---
While in the killer's terror radius, reveal survivors' aura when they perform a rushed action.
---
Cooldown 30/20/15 seconds
---
They probably had to pay the license holders money to make skins for her and Tapp üòÇ but I agree. Imagine what it's gonna cost for the other characters like Myers and Laurie.
---
Great comment, but don't compare Friday the 13th to Dead by daylight. Ft13 died because they didn't care about the game and only made it cause they knew people would buy it. Their "attempts" at balancing were silly and made more of the playerbase leave in result. 
---
Dead by Daylight is 3 years strong and with them acquiring Ghost Face and Stranger Things licensed content, you know it won't die anytime soon. The dev's may faulter here and there, but they care about the game and they recognize that the fanbase is dedicated.
---
When I was playing them a ton, I was racking up a crap ton of bloodpoints even if I wasn't getting 4Ks.  On top of that, they're incredibly fun to play due to how fast-paced games become.  So while you may just be stabbing and injuring more than getting downs per say, and survivors escape, you're still at least getting BP and having a good time.
---
Plague and Legion are my favorite killers to play in the entire game, since Huntress is kinda stinky on console, at least in my hands.
---
Short answer, you suck.
---
Lol ok then man. Most unoriginal play you could've posted but you do you.
---
Not sure what you expected from posting a video like this here lmfao, are you drunk or something

---
This is how I feel as GhostFace when people bring Object or Obsession
---
those are baby hags that have no clue how to play her.
---
Nah man I don‚Äôt care about internet points lmao.
---
every now and then i think the game is actually fun, and then people like you demand on making it not so. have fun with your shitty build.
---
Some people say Camping makes you toxic, but I don't think thats the case, your job as killer is to kill. Camping is just securing a kill, literally your job.
---
However, it opens up the other survivors to just gen rush, and your ability to earn pips and rank up suffers if you camp, so its really just a bad way to play and you won't benefit from doing it except maybe securing 1 kill and losing the other 3 when they rush gens and walk out the gate
---
My P3 Dwight would like a word with you.
---
As far as I could tell, there was no mention or anything that provides extra Rift XP, only the Archive quests which provide more shards.
---
Y‚Äôall are such cry babies lol
---
Nah I rather see Kate nude...but stop with this thing here, you have places to post this kind of stuff...
---
Then why did you post anything at all
---
I don't think he said anything about t-bagging and crying...
---
Jake apparently is a magician. (I haven't seen a bug like that with the hook in awhile)
---
Damn I wished you‚Äôd miss it
---
Because I wanted to post a game clip that I enjoyed? Just because everyone else is a sensitive pansy doesn‚Äôt hurt me none.
---
Ardetha's a tool.
---
I'm ashamed to say that when I first started the game, I camped a lot in the low ranks for fear of losing so to speak. Its honestly just a noob thing that i think everyone has done when starting out. Once you make it into the high ranks, the only time you'll ever camp or get camped is when the survivor is playing toxic and just trying to purposefully piss off the killer (tea bagging every pallet followed by flashlighting you almost every chance they get)
---
Yes! I would love to have this skin just so I can emulate this https://youtu.be/TwHRBcmbbAE
---
I think they didn't add the decapitation part om demogorgon, was due how censor works in a few countries, so DbD would stop being available in a few countries just because of the decapitation.
---
And you assume I watch some weird anime? Okay lol
---
As weird as it is to say, there's a part of me that completely, passionately hates DBD...despite how much i regularly play it.
---
I'd be pretty happy if something similar but less...toxic...came along.  I use to play a lot of friday the 13th, for example, which actually never made me salty.  But it's dead now.
---
Every one i have encountered has been green rank
---
I did the same, but skillchecks are still hard even when I'm playing at 144fps. The skillcheck pointer just seems to lag along the rail taking "steps" instead of moving along it smoothly. Is it supposed to be like that?
---
I might be thinking of another perk but I was playing demo earlier and got 3 different MoM after they got off hook. Dunno if I‚Äôm confused but they were injured and had a white outline after I hit them.
---
My ass would have instahealed as soon as I dropped the pallet for a maximum fuck you
---
Yolo?
---
haha such crybabies how dare we want to have literally any fun. go ahead and laugh in the corner while everyone hates you. i seriously couldn‚Äôt care less.
---
Probably. More EZ money
---
best one so far
---
Fuck Shirtless Myers, ***I NEED THIS***
---
Soooo I‚Äôm not allowed to have my own version of fun? Gotcha! Sick hypocrite!
---
I always knew David was an incel! ‚òë
---
So this is why David is getting a clown face in his new skin
---
It will be dead... By daylight. üòé
---
Probably which option exactly?
---
She‚Äôs got a learning curve the higher you go since you‚Äôll have to adjust to how each individual group of players play. 
---
Good perks: STBFL, Corrupt Intervention, Franklin‚Äôs Demise, Dying Light, Hex: Ruin, Monitor and Abuse and Nurse‚Äôs Calling are some of my favorites to use on her (although i stopped using ruin a while ago).
---
I‚Äôd specifically stay away from perks like BBQ, Discordance, and general M1 killer perks like Spirit Fury and Enduring, as she can‚Äôt really make great use out of these like other killers.
---
I hope I get a game with you I would have left you on the hook and teabagged you
---
is Spirit fury + enduring still a thing? just asking
---
I've tried her on PTB. Nothing was changed, lol.
---
It's a meme format from the show not an unexpected reference
---
Okay? I have 2 people I play with as obviously I‚Äôm talking to someone. You‚Äôre refusal to unhook me would hurt me soo very much
---
You literally proved my point lmao, green ranks are still babies that don‚Äôt know how to play their killers to their full potential. Any hag that uses more than 1 trap at a hook doesn‚Äôt know how to play her.
---
Uhhh well, you are welcome ? XD yep he is
---
Its not 50/50 though, not only is the killer faster than the survivors therefor can look for it quicker, but you also have the entire game to look for it as you're already walking around the map to look for survivors, whereas survivors have to focus on gens, you're also taller than them. Its like 80/20 in the killers favor
---
It's a gamble.
---
Oh darn, look at me spending money to unlock cosmetics and getting my money back if I just play the game I am spending the money on in the first place. Such a problem. I feel like having an extra incentive to play the game and be rewarded for it is a good thing. It's not required to pay for it, so don't if you don't want to.
---
I don‚Äôt know man. Entity displeased doesn‚Äôt really equate to a win..
---
The ghost would have been better
---
I agree that rank 1 survivors are pretty good most of the time and that Tru3 is a good example. The nurse's nerfs seem fair tho they nerfed instaheals hard as well. I personally would have been fine if they just removed 3-5 blinks because it takes no skill to play and do well with but nerfing her base kit a little helps too I guess. It punishes mistakes more now which is good because fatigue doesn't really do shit. It's still in PTB tho and nothings final so we will see I guess.
---
Also there was this cancelled game that was meant to be asym with the 4 goodies going through a dungeon or maze that the 1 baddie filled with traps and monsters. I was following the game's progress and thought that's perfect for me but nothing came of it. I think it was something medieval fantasy themed. Fable Legends, was it? I think so.
---
Do you know why sometimes the timer will jump down? Is that just the way the timer works or is something going on?
---
Pantless myers.
---
I usually bring this when I have a daily to kill a survivor by a certain killer's hands. The other Moris feel too easy and not that enjoyable to play with.
---
well if your Fun consists of robbing others of their Fun....thats usually looked down upon
---
Not really fair that Huntresses loses a pip from all survivors DCing, but eh, its still a victory for her. She was to much for them.
---
Both them dummy thicc can i have them both please
---
Did we just discover the lore of how nea becomes a killer?

Nurse is still great anybody that's actually half decent with her will feel the same. Less oppressive, but still has a ridiculously strong chase game *if the nurse is good*. Also, her addons are actually fun to use now, and almost every single one is at least somewhat usable, which wasn't true for a lot of them before.
---
Yeah you could call it a 'nerf' but that's missing the point of the changes entirely. It really is all about the addons with this patch and I love it. Still a top 3 killer free.
---
You sit the fuck down! "EHhHhh"
---
Meh, don't feel bad. They came here to die anyways :)
---
And considering I have, what?
---
This aloofness will get you nowhere.

I agree there, it's just -- for his *very first* cosmetic they picked something so...dumb

I am still hoping for 2007 michael and laurie though
---
Just dont use Prayer Beads
---
You have just figured out what running is? Lol
---
That makes you the fuck boy
---
The thing about prayer beads is that you it's kinda not as easy to tell how much they impact the game when you're new to playing as her...
---
But the survivors can't tell when you're phasing, and that's actually a huge deal.
---
In the words of my boy on discord rn shut the fuck up
---
LMFAO
---
&gt;That makes you the fuck boy

I say 'meaningful progression' because I can't think of a word to gather all of what I mean. You know how games used to be where you played the game enough or you did certain things to earn cool items to keep the game fresh and make you want to keep playing to unlock more things? That's what I mean. The progression as it is rn as a console player is you get perks and items and add ons. I already unlocked the perks I want on the characters I play, I don't bring items into trials as survivor so those are virtual paperweights to me, so really the only thing I get out of playing is blood points to put into add ons for killers when the abundant of add ons I have atm start to run low. There are the shards that you get from levelling but between how long it takes to level vs getting rewarded after every match and the fact that depending on the level just how much you actually get, it's pretty tiring to rack them up and it's purposefully designed that way to make buying with premium currency the more appealing option, not because it makes it more fun to earn things. Basically rn I just play dead by daylight if my friends want to play or I feel like playing killer for like 3 games at most before I get tired of the gameplay loop or I run into players that are less than pleasant to play with. There's nothing really to keep you engaged in that scenario. Actually unlocking things would make it feel more 'meaningful' to keep playing for more than a few matches or to keep going when my friends leave, but alas that's behind a paywall, and the free track has very sparse rewards that aren't as good or include parts of outfits you can't complete without buying the full thing which for me personally is frustrating that I can't unlock things meant to be unlocked because I have to spend more money to earn the ability to unlock things on a game I already spent $40 on to play in the first place. This practice makes sense in games that are free to play, which is why they are implemented in such games, not in games with a priced entry point.
---
Onto your second point. The non-licensed killers are practically free if you earn the points for them which is totally cool! It's a grind sure but that's cause they want you to see buying them as a better option. I don't have too much of a problem with this because it's cool they give you the option when they could totally just sell it to you outright. There are a bunch of games that give you new characters for free but I understand those are more populated and have generated more revenue. I completely understand licensed characters being paid for whole heartedly as I said in my previous comment, and they do have to put resources into making original characters and they aren't a billion dollar company so I sliiightly retract my previous statement only to add on just new characters in general but that's it really. The cosmetics should be earnable imo but lately they have not and that's pretty lame.
---
Any game where you have to pay an initial price just to pay to unlock more things is not fun, they should just make it free to play at this point because you have to agree that most of the things you can unlock now are behind paywalls and the rest are a chore to earn and aren't even that great to begin with, which is purposefully designed that way. I like the battlepass being implemented but if it's a game that you have to purchase in order to play in the first place then there shouldn't be a premium track, and if there is a premium track make it free to play and give the people who paid an initial price the equivalent premium currency they paid upfront. I don't think thats too ridiculous of a concept
---

I did 3 gens all by myself through ruin against a Wraith, all between running him a collective ~3 minutes (using like 2 pallets) and not going down. 3 teammates were literally doing nothing- just looking for Ruin on The Game.
---
We made it to 1 gen left, I died on first hook after Wraith kept ditching me to chase other people who all went down in 10 seconds each.
---
Shit is infuriating. Do gens.

---
overpowered does not equate to ‚Äúslightly too powerful‚Äù OP implies that it‚Äôs impossible to win against them which was the case two or three years ago but is no longer the case
---
Ruin gets its value if you down the first guy.
---
When you start the match, 3 guys have nothing to do except open chests and M1 gens. Literally nothing else besides totems. Unhindered gen rush as you're chasing your first guy.
---
The moment you down the first guy, or start switching targets, they are put on their toes and have to make decisions. But until then, 3 people are pushing gens out.
---
Once you get the ball rolling with the first hook, and you get into the next chase quickly enough/ with an edge and lay pressure on, you have something to work with and stall gen progress.
---
You don't really *need* ruin at that point.
---
I wanted to stay true to the flavor text found in the beginning of the current predator: " Your acute tracking ability allows you to hone in on disturbances left by running Survivors."   
---
There is some interesting design space in the scratch mark mechanic and I think updating a nearly forgotten perk would be a great way to explore that space. (plus I'd love a good teachable from wraith to warrant leveling him lol)
---
Hello me old chum

I have honestly seen it so many times and when I bring up the old DS and enduring thing they never say anything back lol

Or spirit. Imma sacrifice the beads just leave rin the fuck alone.
---
Oh yeah it punishes hard those unfamiliar with it, but ruin still poses a significant problem at high ranks, if im playing and i see lullaby icon on the hud (which is stupid btw it worked better when it didnt tell you it was there, people just had to notice something was fishy with their skillchecks), anyway yeah when i see lullaby active when im playing survivor i simply say to myself "oh wow, lullaby, well good on the killer thats really brave" just because theyre trying to stray from the meta, then we kick their ass and escape.
---
I'm willing to bet the joke would be lost on a good majority of people there.
---
Thats some bullshit. Should atleast get a brutal or a rutheless from all players dc'ing
---
Yeah. They need to add built in protections against tunneling (like make it so you get a status for 30s after being unhooked, and you don't progress down a hook health phase until that status expires).  Not make it even easier for people to tunnel/camp...
---
Correct.
---
In the French translation, The Ghost translates to The Wraith.  Though I'm not sure why they couldnt just name him The Specter or something for the French translation.  Or anything else ghostly for that matter.

I've encountered literally only one fantastic nurse on console, otherwise it's new players who don't understand how lame she is on console.  Huntress players I always commend for trying, but I've never encountered one that was a big issue.

I think (hope) crosssave will be a thing Sony endorses so as to make the transition to their newest console consumer friendly.
---
There are more online persistent games than ever, that millions play for years, and Sony will not neglect this as it will be worsr for them than the xbox one reveal was for MS.
---
Sony will (I hope) announce this well before the new console, to allow developers to implement it in their game. Sony is the only roadblock towards cross save and cross play, but they must accept it for next gen, or they will lose consumers.

Like 95$ including the initial purchase?

If anything, it should just be a built in mechanic to the game instead of a perk. Same with DS. Discouraging camping and tunneling is healthy for the game.

I too would like an original killer,we just got the demo boi
---
Nah not really I just think that if you‚Äôre gonna try to shit talk someone, you should be smart enough to use the correct grammar lol.
---
It is what it is I guess. If people dont like it that's fine. They dont have to agree. It is just a rant.
---
Thing is, that truly is part of the fun of an event. A few extra blood points, a change in pace, and earning a neat cosmetic that's related. 
---
They put out new cosmetics fairly often, so doing it like this just makes it another option among the many cosmetics already available for purchase. So what's the point? It becomes a what--glorified bloodhunt with maybe some decorations in game? I mean thank you, I enjoy a bloodhunt but...its not the same as having an event.
---
Groovy
---
Nice one
---
Compared to PC, Doc Hag Clown and Spirit came free. Only killer they don‚Äôt have access too is Bubba, the rest are purchasable though.
---
Leave me and my science girl alone, I just chill in a bush lmao
---
It sucks too. That charm is super cute, but I can't enjoy it when the burning eye of death is beamed at my face by that teabagging demon.
---
Face camping is trash because it takes all the fun out of the game

1. It's a battlepass no matter how you call it. Compare it to those existing in other games and they will look almost identical. 2. Battlepasses are rarely (if ever) P2W, it was never the complain in the first play.
---
The hate boners for battlepasses in general are coming from other games implementing the system poorly and I hate seeing them being downplayed and mocked. Battlepasses CAN be predatory towards the players' wallets so we can only hope BHVR doesn't follow this slippery path any further.
---
Please tell me that you‚Äôre pulling a /s, because I literally just stated I missed the seven on the keyboard
---
Could be a bug with dedicated servers. They just put them back up for another test on PC. I haven‚Äôt had anything quite that bad, but a few matches definitely have input lag or something. Keep missing easy hits because I gotta spam M1 to do a short attack.
---
Yah, it is boring fam. I never said otherwise. And I am right, you should punish a killer for facecamping by gen rushing.
---
I have no idea what that means but I‚Äôm assuming you‚Äôre too lazy to edit
---
I know your ass didn't just say Dwight isn't cute
---
Wait, so you asked how to counter backrevv when not in the open? Dude, just vault windows or drop a pallet; if you can't do so then you seriously misjudged how much you can run the loop if Billy can backrevv you on it for free. 
---
You probably wouldn't wait with dropping the pallet for so long against EW3 Myers, so don't wait that much against Billy or he'll backrevv when the pallet is on the opposite side of the loop.
---
I‚Äôm sure he wasn‚Äôt saying that. But I mean I just did it out of the kindness of my heart I‚Äôm not sure why everyone is flaming me so hard. I‚Äôm just a sensitive little boy.
---
If you like twinks or bottoms yeah but he but he ain‚Äôt all that
---
I honestly just play her for her unique fashion choices as she has a lot of above average choices (a lot of bad ones too though, rip in pieces skater girl hats)
---
maybe, you should try slapping kids instead. People seem to apparently have no problem with that ;)
---
Truly sad.
---
no. It's not the same fucking thing. With backer rewards you know you are taking the risk and getting rewarded for it, while with battle passes you are basically paying for in-game missions, it's nothing like the backer rewards.
---
To be fair I don't think the effeciency was even working. I did some testing a few weeks ago to find efficient medkit setups. The efficiency was barely there or not at all, couldn't really tell.
---
That‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt white knight a child abused lol
---
I missed the seven key on the keyboard? You know, the thing you tap to input 7 into a textbox?
---
What's the upvote to bloodpoint ratio that would make this worth it

They even joked about it on stream but still didnt change it
---
Bill is SSS tier! HOW DARE YOU!
---
I've been calling it Battlepass because I haven't seen the official name yet (I don't play Public "Use your Ebony Moris" Build) and because people already understand that Battlepass = Fortnite
---
And Fortnite = Bad henceforth Battlepass = Bad :^)
---
That wouldnt work, it would make it impossible to lose a killer effectively
---
probably :D

This worries me since I'm sure spirit will be on the chopping block next... I rue the day rank 1 is ALL billys because nurse and spirit get nerfed.
---
I hate jake, he is my least fav survivor just bc of the people that play him.
---
With around 3k hours in the game i dont remember running into a single good jake, Everytime i see a legacy jake as survivor i dodge, and when i see it as killer i always 4k bc they are garbage.
---
Jake players are the worst bc they are garbo
---
I managed to do it on xbox so it works on console
---
Half agree. Some of the prices for stuff are bullshit but I do agree that licenses cost a **ton** of money.
---
TBH this discussion is more directed towards the people who complain when a licensed character is added and it's not one they personally wanted. I remember when Demogorgon was added there were a lot of people going "REEEE WHY NO CHUCKIE?!" "REEE WHY NO DEMOGORGON?"

Uhhh that's not a joke bro calm down.
---
It's amazing. People can be quite stupid. 
---
For me I've had nothing but positive things to report from my experiences with dedicated servers. There's always a green ping, movements as killer and survivor are more snappy, and I'm not getting hit through properly finished vaults. It's been nice.

Cost around 7000 auric cells to buy your way to the end? 
---
How much grinding do you have to do to get that far? 
---
Pay to grind? No thanks. Don't grind it out in 2 months and you miss the good stuff at the end.  Don't play this game often enough to make any of that worth it.
---
I hate battle pass shit. Fuck that noise. The free pathway is almost empty and weak like every other game that runs this nonsense. 
---
Cosmetic prices are crazy to begin with.
---
Survivors are slightly overpowered when played competently.
---
Killers have a chance, but they can't afford to make any mistakes and 1-2 survivors are likely to escape regardless if they don't make any mistakes.
---
That's with 4 solo survivors with no items or broken perks going up against a strong killer on a balanced map.
---
Mess with any of those things and the game balance breaks down.
---
It's a 4-man SWF? They coordinate their builds and plays to make things a lot more difficult.
---
Throw meta perks on that SWF? Every survivor now has Exhaustion perks, none of which are balanced. Dead Hard means you *always* make it to the pallet, even when you shouldn't and is flat out unfair against the Trapper.
---
Throw toolboxes on that SWF? You *already* don't have enough time, this just seals the deal. *At least* two gens will be completed by the time you finish your first chase.
---
Medkits? If you're in red ranks, those are almost guaranteed to be instaheals. Sure they're getting nerfed, but the nerfs *don't do shit*.
---
Keys? You'll get 1-2 kills before the other two cheat their way out of the game. As if the objective wasn't easy enough to complete, if they're the kind of mouthbreathers who bring in keys they don't even *need* to complete the objective.
---
Playing somebody other than Nurse, Spirit, Billy, or Huntress (or you played Huntress on an indoor map)? No time to win.
---
Playing somebody who isn't Nurse on Haddonfield? May as well leave.
---
Funny thing is I was really thinking about putting her in S rank but i felt she was perfect in A. The ‚ÄúBaby Dwight‚Äù meme is funny but that still doesn‚Äôt change my mind.
---
Distressing only helps you to get to 8k BP Deviousness in game faster, it‚Äôs not a post game bonus. Therefore its not really that useful for farming BP unless you struggle to reach 8k Deviousness. I would recommend running BBQ and overall meta perks to track survivors and end chases quickly. Just play fair as a killer and try to hook everyone 3 times.
---
She should be in S with Jeff.
---
Claudette should be in D cause you can't even see her 90% of the time, so how do you even know she's cute?
---
I see toxic nobody‚Äôs on ps4 legit everybody is like level 50 but have no prestige

---
this is a good meme
---
Dude I just got back into the game and forgot how doing generators gives you piss.  I played against a baby Bubba and was the gen jockey of the match, and got no hook saves.
---
I ended up with 16K BP after escape.
---
Bubba got 13K BP with only a few hooks and no successful sacrifices.
---
...excuse me?
---
I can relate to the SWF part. I feel like the SWF changes really screwed over solo queue red ranked players. Bringing in brown ranked players into a red rank game really sucks. I pretty much also yolo queue because I don't have any friends that play this game. Feel free to hit me up if you want people to play with. I hover around rank 2-4 for both killer and survivor.

Two of my favorite things

---
IF the unhooker is oblivious. Don't get hit before hook diving. Freddy's  Power counters your perk? Re-strategize. Several killers have their power nearly nullified by several perks, anyway. Spine Chill still screws even undetectable killers for example.
---
Pretty sure it's fake, I heard she got serum injections.
---
she lost her because she wanted her to die from end-game timer. it is so many things in her head indeed i think the best move was to body block the pallet from one side while picking the nea up
---
This should have the 6ix 9ine snitch meme

That‚Äôs sick your are very talented keep up the great work

I think "The Shadow" would have sounded better.

Always behind you, unnoticed until it's too late.
---
Hey, that‚Äôs me
---
He‚Äôs in a better place than Dwight and Jake
---
That's how it is.
---
There's a *reason* you only see Nurse, Spirit, and Billy at red ranks.
---
Sure, you'll get a good number of shitters at red ranks. Against them, you can win with any killer. Hell, an AI programmed to just hold W would probably beat them.
---
If those shitters are running broken perks/items, those can elevate them to the point where they're good.
---
If they aren't shitters, and actually know what they're doing... you just lose if you aren't playing a high tier killer, and if they're running broken shit *on top* of knowing how to play, you're basically limited to Nurse.
---
*Cries in all the pallets I need to eat tomorrow*
---
Yeah i got it when it was free last year on ps4. And metal gear solid 5 was just before that too. Was a good couple of months
---
Think about it, we‚Äôre talking about a killer whose main ability is to be invisible so they can sneak up on people. Nothing more toxic than that, and then they have a freaking bell.
---
I want to know why the downed survivor chilled in a dead end? If u see a killer is camping move ur sorry ass body away from him so u can get healed.
---
Hmm, maybe?

Could have been waiting for Blood Warden. The timer was just shy of 50% when he finally went for the puckup.

wow what a great teammate you are..
---
I love it!
---
yeah it's quite a shame that claudette is seen as a demon instead of a nice girl
---
i guess it depends on how they dress and act
---
No they arent, they heal you over time or give borrowed time once per match. They are nowhere near as bad as they used to be while still being somewhat viable if used correctly.
---
Before particulalry insta meds would basically restart a chase with a downed guy. 
---
Im glad they havnt made them BNP level useless

I was confused at first as it looked like you shape shifted from Nea to Tapp and back.

Then I saw what happened after...
---
Heh, my thoughts on spirit deserve their own post. Though suffice to say, I think I'd want to see play testing to see if crouch jukes would still be enough, or if she should only be able to see normal default scratch marks and not any added by perks.   
---
Currently I'm not sure my opinion on which way it should go. But, if spirit was slightly less powerful in other parts of her kit, I'd be happy to give her this perk working with her power.

Maybe, I dont like posing big essential mechanic changes to games, but if a dev wanted to go that route I wouldn't be offended. Adding too many big baseline mechanic changes risks changing the core game, which I don't like the idea of since I like dbd as it is, warts and all.

That's really good!

---
I'm sorry, I gotta take the role of the survivor main. Are you serious? These were the last good add-ons survivors had left, they been considerably nerfed and you still think they are broken? Do you want them to be useless? They are rare and ultra rare, they are supossed to be powerful. They should pack some punch especially compared to some seriously broken killer add ons of the same rarity.
---
I rarely see BNPs anymore, they are not that strong, they have long since passed their glory days.
---
Where it be at? New post or same post? 
---
If you think I'm trying at all, then you playing the fool, my dude.
---
IMO I think it's good for the games health, I won't be getting it because I don't like any of the skins, there good skins but I main steve.

Plus I don't play enough.

The bushes in Lery's actually make her invisible.

---
You're correct. This was confirmed in the post.
---
Once the gates are opened, the survivors have 2 minutes to leave, or the Entity will kill them. The Clown was running a perk called Blood Warden, which blocks the exit gates for a period of time if they hook someone during the endgame. In this case, the killer hooked someone close enough to the end of the timer that the gates remained blocked and the survivors could not escape.
---
And no one listened to me when I was saying BW would be op with the endgame collapse.
---
This is some really good shit!
---
Keep it up!
---
Should be buffed to 18 charges so running Botany Knowledge gives 2 self heals.
---
Atleast this was decent play, last post was just you being a bitch XD
---
It‚Äôs literally the same exact thing
---
The Claudette's I meet never reveal themselves with stuff like toxicity. Too busy trying to urban evasion out of view.
---
The real trapper has cleaver in the right hand and traps in the left, but very good drawing my dude!
---
Mori's? Sure.
---
* Cypress is unchanged.
---
* Ivory lets you mori people once they're dead on hook.
---
* Ebony lets you mori anybody, but only during after the gates are powered.
---
Instadowns? Literally the only thing that needs changing is Iridescent Head.
---
* No longer instadowns, no longer reduces hatchets. Hatchets now pass through survivors, damaging anything in their path.
---
Nope, last post you unnecessarily waited at the gate to hit your Decisive, just to be a dick. 
---
This was solid play and using the perk for it's intended purpose.
---
ngl that‚Äôs hot I‚Äôd smash
---
How do you run the game at 144?
---
It kinda sounds like *you* don't know what you're talking about here, bud. The Fortnite S2 BP had multiple cosmetics that are *still* used today in it, and it even applied the basic "you get it all back" rule as well. DbD on the other hand only gives you what you paid back, and the entire battle pass is a joke, considering every single thing save for 2 outfits (1 that was scrapped from the event, and 1 that is generally very lazy) is a recolour. ü§∑
---
How do you turn of vsynch?
---
That's so they can sell it in certain countries
---
Alright whatever. I‚Äôll take the compliment.  Thank you
---
true but at least they can't pop a insta heal in front of me making the chase go even longer
---
Hey hey, hold up! I am new in this but how Self Care is not that good? Please don't hate me.
---
...and then lose the game because you lost all map pressure.
---
No prob, do you play GoW? I could use a good shit talker to squad with.
---
Nerf the walking scratches down to 3 seconds of tracking time and we are solid, no need to absolutely negate stealth for just walking.
---
Gears? Nah I haven‚Äôt played gears since 3. I wouldn‚Äôt mind giving it a try but I don‚Äôt have much free time anymore. I get like 2 nights a week to game and dbd is most of it if rainbow six siege isn‚Äôt happening.
---
Then why do I get so many toxic Dwight's, neas, and claudettes?
---
...Are people seriously mad about $10 Cosmetics?
---
Other than that one Pig Skin being purposefully priced higher, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an unfair price. They‚Äôre cosmetic, and the whole purpose is to buy them in hopes to support the game for further updates/chapters/bug fixes
---
Quentin mains are holy.
---
No problem. Self-care is what made Claudette so appealing when I first started playing, but I wasted more time healing than I did doing gens or helping teammates. It's a good beginner's perk, but it's one that should be retired from your toolkit.
---
Ok, cool.
---
Guess you wouldn't see any problem if the devs gave back first down Mori's, gave Nurse an ultra rare that gave her 115% speed with 3 blinks, release BNP, or let Frank's mixtape Legion do what it used to do?
---
After all, they *are* pretty rare, so they should be strong!
---
BNP's aren't useless.
---
They just aren't gamebreaking.
---
If you think they're useless, you're using them wrong.
---
Tbf Bubba's perks are all pretty good. I run Franklin's quite often for example.
---
The problem with him is not with the Perks but with his pressure on the map mostly.
---
well for one you can make a simple lag switch for 5 dollars literally using a light switch and wiring it to a router your console is playing on. Simply by using the wireless signal and turning it on and off your lagging the game to hell but also staying connected.
---
PC you actually have to hack game files which can be tracked and banned and why we have less cheaters than console on dbdl. Good enough?

Is it just me or does her smile/mouth and cheeks seem stretched out? More than usual that is

The Legion's younger brother: *th e leggen*
---
How are you still complaining about insta heals after this rework goes through?  They literally won't exist anymore.  Insta heal isn't even going to be a thing period.  They were very cheesy before and this rework rebalances them completely.  Killers have some ridiculous broken things still with no announced plans of a rework like Prayer Beads and Moris but you want to nuke these into the ground further than what they are about to become?  When will it ever be enough for you?  Let them have something.  They won't even be that good anymore.
---
I wonder how he would work though, because Slenderman doesn't "chase" people. He stalks them from a distance and catch them off-guard. His ability would probably ignore many rules of the game like Nurse. Not that I'd mind that though.
---
Okay we get it, you made a Legion mask. Stop spamming this.
---
It's the same argument.
---
"It's rare, so it should be strong".
---
Instaheals are on the same level as all of those things.
---
I can already hear survivor mains calling for a nerf as it is op.
---
New instaheals are still strong and will be annoying at times but they are fine and way better than they used to be balance wise. An ultra rare item destroying a medkit to heal you passively over time is fine.
---
Bnp's are honestly trash since the change, they are more like a green add on at this point given that they destroy a toolbox to give 25%.
---
Honestly the reason the game took off is because nobody really knew about infinites for the most part, they weren't common but if you found someone who knew it was cancer. The controls were different from other games and nobody had any idea how to loop a killer. It was just run through the area and try to break LOS, maybe use a pallet if it was nearby but it wasn't the first thing in peoples heads to run around pallets.
---
Though it could be cool, it doesn't fit the lore. The entity feeds on emotions from the killer too and animatronics dont have feelings
---
They can.
---
Nea drops a pallet and pops an AHR.
---
If you break the pallet, she runs straight away. This buys her 20 seconds, so she heals to full before you've even closed half the gap.
---
I was thinking something related to La Llorona from Latin folklore. Her name would most likely be The Weeping Woman. Her terror radius could be her sobbing just like Huntress‚Äô humming is.
---
If you cant tell by the end of the clip, I don't have a need for blood points.
---
Apparently there can be syncing problems with the visual representation and the actual timer. Not sure if that's what's happening here.
---
Trash idea, becomes meta almost immediately. Imagine never being able to disengage from a killer walking up on your gen because you did the correct thing of stealthing away. May as well just stand still and gen the extra gen % and start the chase with the speed boost.
---
Hopefully this can stop people from complaining too. $10 for everything that's included (including your Cells back) is honestly the best way BHVR could have handled a Battlepass.
---
I really like it! It really drives in the feeling that a stalker is near. And when the beat drops? MAGNIFICENT! You did an excellent job!
---
Not that good?? Pffft stop it, you‚Äôre almost if not already there. Keep it up!
---
Having Needles, something that literally popped you off the ground in a second to full health turn into a single state 8 second passive heal that now has to be used as an old Styptic midchase is not changing shit?  This is absurd man.  It's clearly not as strong anymore.  There is no denying that.  Again killers have crazy powerful addons available some that have literally zero counterplay like Prayer Beads and you can't even let survivors have a low budget version with less than half the effectiveness of what it once was?  How easy do you need your games to be man?  I face sweaty swf's with instaheals regularly and am appreciative and looking forward to the changes.  What I'm not going is whining about something that won't even be that strong anymore out of a sense of entitlement.  This is sad man.
---
Lol you talking about Nea?
---
Why the downvotes? This is true. Map offerings are not contradictory because it's 50/50. Old moonlight offerings were and I think shroud of binding and separation are also contradictory (higher rarity will always be used).
---
How long do you have to try to pull it of? The last one was 2-4 hours I think
---
I love to plaz her and she is one of my mains becsuse i think she is cute and this is making it really hard.
---
and also rework his perks
---
After the first few days I started patrolling cancers instead to kill the farmers and give the real players some more time.
---
Given how shit their deathgarden game was I'm sure they are planning a dbd 2 for 2021 maybe
---
&gt; Its not exactly a GOOD perk anyways.
---
It is good. When used correctly. Even stronger if you're with a team with comms.
---
there‚Äôs a reason you only see certain killers at red ranks just like there‚Äôs a reason you only see certain perks at red ranks. you use what‚Äôs good and that‚Äôs that. if a survivor is really that bad then even crutch perks won‚Äôt save them
---
My 2 mains always getting shit here I am just playing them because I like them with no bad intentions :(
---
Ok
---
Since most people run ruin, I'd say you wouldn't want people constantly looking for totems.
---
It‚Äôs the literal definition of the word
---
Sorry guys popcorn line was a mile long. What did I miss?
---
AHR went from being what it currently is (a completely over-powered item that has no place in a PVP game) to effectively doing what the current Styptic does (another completely over-powered item that has no place in a PVP game).
---
Styptic went from doing what it currently does (being a completely over-powered item that has no place in a PVP game) to doing the same thing in a slightly different way.
---
BNP went from instantly completing a generator to completing a generator over 20 seconds.
---
Is the changed version worse than the old one? Yes.
---
Does that make the changed version acceptable? **Hell the fuck no**
---
If you go back to the spirit at a loop you‚Äôre an idiot.
---
Kinda hard to add something for Freddy who only wore one outfit in the only movie he appears. Unless you want to add his human form ones that make 2.
---
Sorry guys popcorn line was a mile long. What did I miss
---
Even if it kinda breaks the norm of Killers, I could see Hunk as one terrifying entity to be up against.
---
But for these perks, I really like the concepts around killer detection/negation, but they seem kinda wonky in the numbers department.
---
**On Guard**
---
* While *Repairing*, you and Survivors within **4 meters** will receive an auditory warning whenever the Killer is within **12/16/20 meters**.
---
 * This effect has a cooldown of **60 seconds** between uses.
---
(Increased range/shared effect so it isnt totally outclassed by Premonition.)
---
**Going Dark**
---
* Safe Unhooks and Protection score events grant a Token to **Going Dark**, up to a maximum of **1/2/3**.
---
* Whenever your *Aura* would be revealed to the Killer, gain *Undetectable* for **3 seconds** in exchange for a Token.
---
 * This effect will not activate while in the *Dying* state or affected by Traps.
---
* Failed Skillchecks will not alert the Killer in exchange for a Token.
---
* **Going Dark** has a cooldown of **15 seconds** between uses.
---
**Night Vision**
---
* *Blindness* effect durations are reduced by **30/40/50%**, and are limited to **60 seconds**.
---
* **Slightly/Moderately/Considerably** reduces the thickness of the Dark Mist for you.
---
I hope these seem like decent tweaks from the base material.
---
Nuh he needed you what a fucking great gamer he is!
---
Well if you're not even going to pay attention to someone's points why are you even discussing it? It's obvious you just want to go on about how you're right. Tschau.
---
Battlepass is bad not because "fortnite bad"
---
it's bad because it's artificially making you play more to get your money's worth.
---
It also encourages lazy workflow on BHVR's end. Some cosmetics are amazing, but they would be sold normally if pass wasn't a thing and many of them are simple recolors of existing skins, made only to make it seem like you get more.
---
It's also built around the fear of missing out, psychologically forcing people who can't afford it to buy it anyway.
---
We currently have to buy the base game, and then there are 3 different ways to spend money at the game (Chapters, Cosmetic Store, Rifts) For an average user (as most of us buy everything), the game just turned from a \~3$ per month subscription into \~3-13$ per month depending on how much you play.
---
The Battlepass challenges also encourage doing dumb shit. What if you wanted to play the game, but 3 survivors have challenges like "open 3 chests"? Well fuck you, that's what. This match will be ruined for both you and the killer, cuz survivors won't care about anything other than the chests and (as it currently happens when they can't get what they want) will DC if they got none.
---
Oh god. That would be literal hell if a swf used this perk. Even people who often dc could run this and give the team a free win.
---
Nah dude, it's all about personality, anxious boy is best survivor
---
Imagine getting dragged into a weird hell dimension with horrific monsters and supernatural murderers chasing you down. 
---
Then all of a sudden the local punk band you made a poster for starts running at you with a fucking knife.
---
Yup. If you don't have any idea how the game actually works, no point talking balance.
---
Peace, good luck looping Bubba around a tile with no pallets.
---
Yeah sprinting scratch marks last for a total of 9 seconds, so there wouldn't be much of a reason to walk if the Killer had this perk that only made walking give off 22% less scratch marks.
---
As a huntress main, running iridescent head and the other add on that gives you +2 hatchets lets off a lot of steam because it has a 100% win rate for me
---
It actually works on both versions
---
I actually just rewatched the Tru3Ta1ent video. The entire Jake skin is a recolour...just with an added beard? Amazing quality. The Nea, Meg, David, Dwight, Huntress, Hag and Hillbilly pieces throughout the BP are all reskins, or just repurposed and *very slightly* changed. The Trapper reuses a lot of assets from his semi-new metallic skin...lazy. The Wraith skin reuses a lot of textures from his recent Scarecrow skin, but still has it's own uniqueness; genuinely the most freshing skin in the BP...kinda unfortunate that it's still pretty ugly. The Claudette skin is another refreshing outfit; the bottom looks great, the jacket is okay, the hair is...terrible. Still far better than the rest of the BP, but containing the running theme here, it reeks of lazy altogether. The Charms...don't even get me started on the charms. They're barely noticeable for starters, I'd genuinely not notice them if I wasn't looking for them.  Most of them are just reused assets once again; reusing multiple perk icons. There are even a few that are literally recoloured...like the Trapper face one. 
---
Overall, like I've been saying this entire time, at best, it's lazy, at worst, it's complete and utter trash.
---
Something thanos something balanced landing
---
Also now we have inner strength which is so much better
---
You ever just buy and level up a killer just to have the 1 perk you wanted show up in the shrine next week?
---
I did the same thing and thought I was a genius...
---
Putting Ash anywhere but SS tier? What kind of monster are you? That is Bruce Campbell and his jaw shall not be denied!
---
This is DBD. There will be a pallet.
---
Luckily ghostface will have undetectable status during nightshroud in the 3.3.0 update
---
That's a nurse perk.
---
So far nothing is in the files. We are getting new Ghostface Myers and Laurie cosmetics though. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they‚Äôre holding out for cosmetics and that‚Äôs why freddy and Quentin aren‚Äôt available for switch yet.
---
This is great
---
Anytime the offering doesn‚Äôt my friend let‚Äôs out a screech
---
You're locked into whatever body you choose.
---
Tbh I honestly doubt demo's mouth could tear of a head. The teeth are just needles and its mouth doesn't look like it has very strong muscles
---
make this a custom perk right now
---
He's not really a physical threat and others do the dirty work for him
---
Bloodwebs been drunk the past few days.
---
The The.
---
Yes please
---
I only farm when daily rituals are with killers i dont play as.
---
Again heavily depending on the killer and map and the other survivors. You can't truthfully say you've never had a game where u have zoned out survivors
---
You miss the point. They offered NO counter play before. Now they do. Will you ALWAYS be able to counter it? No. But at least that option is there.
---
My body is upse....... my friend is upset
---
both the Legion skins are good tho
---
in conclusion, my pp hard
---
Yes as in BNP's were broken so they got reworked and now they aren't.  They're just decent now.  
---
Yes as in Insta Heals were broken so they are getting reworked and now they will be downgraded from broken cheese to just good.  
---
Take a long hard look at the strength and quantity of killer addons and moris of the Purple and Pink rarity and then come back with a straight face and tell me "instaheals" god we can't even call them that anymore pretty soon we need to think of another name need further nuking.  This is a good change man and you should be appreciative of that.  Our killer games are about to become so much less painful with these reworks.  But for some players like you it will never be enough.  There won't be a point where you can leave well enough alone.  You'll continue attempting to take everything from the opponent.  After a year of straight survivor nerfs playing killer has never been easier than it is right now and it's about to become moreso with the extinction of the insta heal mechanic.  I don't get it man.  I just don't.  And I won't lol.  It's clear you aren't changing your mind regardless.  
---
But again food for thought.  Franklin's run it.  It was decent against insta heals before but post rework they literally won't ever be able to use these against you.  100% will hard counter reworked "instaheals".  Seriously someone come up with a new name so I can drop the air quotes.
---
I‚Äôd risk the ban to get this as my dead hard icon
---
I'm not sure what's funnier, the clown just standing there repeatedly smashing his bottle or the synchronized screams and crackles of the appendages.
---
AHaha my Tenacity +unbreakable+omither+Flipflop build will make me invinceble!
---
They both are also not available on Switch
---
I think they are having issues with license holders
---
I got rank 1 by playing trapper on pc, every killer is viable.
---
But if you wanna tryhard buy the Spirit pack
---
It is better than what we germans got, believe me. We have
---
Der Fallensteller
---
Der Geist
---
Der Hinterw√§ldler
---
Der Wandler
---
Die Krankenschwester
---
Die J√§gerin
---
[...]
---
Die Seuche
---
**gHoSt fAcE**
---
Der Demogorgon
---
It literally ruins EVERYTHING. They didn't even try.
---
BNPs change Generator times from 80 seconds to 72 seconds. They fucking suck. Leave this sub and stop playing this game
---
It is a game mechanic, developers made hatches and disconnects work that way.
---
Legion exists. At least Clown can shut down loops lol.
---
This is cute ^~^
---
Did it happen, though?
---
Absolutely awful. It‚Äôs just you, one gen and one killer and it looks fucking hilarious when he chases you and I say *when* lightly because you‚Äôre hardly ever being chased.
---
Poor Claudette, she deserves better than this
---
Getting 4K on Freddy still isn‚Äôt easy, he‚Äôs just good at stalling the game and patrolling an area
---
If you want stuff that's top tier, buy Shattered Bloodlines. You get Spirit, who is S tier and comes with brilliant perks, and Adam, who comes with Deliverance, which is great.
---
If you're a horror movie buff, buy whatever film you want most.
---
Our? 
---
Yes comrade
---
Spirit doesn't need any perks
---
Experimenting and inventing builds is a part of the game, its fun.
---
She has always had nips
---
Imagine thinking that being able to do 20 seconds of work in 5 seconds is bad, lul.
---
Newsflash for ya buddy; something doesn't need to be gamebreaking to be good.
---
I feel like Blood Warden should pause the timer tbh. The whole point is to pause escaping.
---
It says Horror *Scarry* Game because you‚Äôll be scarred for life if you play.
---
Can someone ban this guy from the sub? And make all his systems explode
---
I recently started using Stake Out on my stealthy build and its great, I seem to get a lot less skill checks since I equipped it weirdly enough
---
I really don't know what other games the average DBD Player plays but I am starting to think none. I have never seen a Dev Team more open with its community than this team and I can see how the battlepass is not pure greed but there to stableize income because projects like dedicated servers and license come at a cost we probably have a small idea about. Yet all of the Prices regarding their game are super fair and you really don't have to buy anything if you don't want to. All this stupid hate the dev team recently gets is really boring and annoying.
---
Bold of you to assume you have to make a new account to play at low ranks.
---
Don't tell that to me. I'm just reporting on what was happening
---
this is how I feel about my head on builds
---
The last thing I want is for Insidious to get buffed... go ahead for the others though.
---
Nea is to powerful to have any sort of relations with humans lol
---
Oh if they do Killer pops...Im prob gonna have to whip out my wallet Dx.
---
Universal cosmetics are charms, they go on survivors' belts.
---
Wtf are you TALKING about? There's no fucking 20 seconds here at all. Its a 7/8 second reduction. Fucking pointless.
---
Literally the LAST good Ultra Rare they have is getting gutted and we STILL have Prayer Beads, both of Michaels add ons, Iridescent hatchets, ect.
---
What next, do you want all pallets gone? Killer speeds doubled? Survivors dying on 1 hook? Just stfu and stop playing DBD. We don't want or need you. No one does
---
I like all of it, seriously good job but I LOVE the ending! (Like the higher part at the end not when it‚Äôs over, hope it didn‚Äôt sound like that)
---
You're forgetting that the BNP is attached to a toolbox, and that the toolbox isn't consumed when you pop the BNP.
---
BNP's aren't bad,  you're just too bad at the game to use them.
---
what did it taste like fried i've only ever had it grilled
---
Some people get triggeres by getting looped for ages and just decide to ruin that persons game i guess.
---
It was listed as a known issue in the patchnotes.
---
So, you want survivor play and gen peed to be balanced around 4-man pro tier SWF genrush, but killer balance should be based around "just someone trying to have fun" with suboptimal or no perks? Sounds legit
---
 [https://twitter.com/EIRRI/status/1179690365663662080](https://twitter.com/EIRRI/status/1179690365663662080)  &lt;----- The artist deserves a lot more attention. This is the source, but check out everything else! They do a great job. :)
---
New dbd player, what exactly is going on?
---
Wait, I can wait to see if I get everything on the free track, and then unlock the premium and get all the rewards from that?
---
Holy shit.  That's actually kinda rad.
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
You sadly can't
---
You choose Body, Mask and Knife
---
While this is true, there is no actual time wasted by using self care compared to healing with someone else (unless sloppy butcher, and even then its 4 seconds added). Its really reliant on the situation. Using it against a Legion or Plag is a wasted slot, against a Nurse or Spirit and it could help a ton
---
Depends. Is the Killer camping you during the entire match? He is probably just bad, and he will realize that later on when he has trouble getting Bloodpoints. Camping the entire match is literally the worst thing you can do. 
---
Is he camping at the end when the exit gates are open? That's just securing the kill, he has really no reason to leave the hook. 
---
Run Laurie with Decisive Strike or Bill with Borrowed Time if you are tired of getting camped.
---
We live in terror radius,   
---
Survivors rise up!
---
The worse thing that happened is I deserved to get bing bonged for looping a Wraith for long but instead the nice Dwight received the bing bong 'till death by the hook.. I deserved that not him.
---
Don't give up yet!
---
You have to get those pips back!
---
\*This comment is sponsored by EA's ~~gambling~~ **surprise mechanics**"
---
Yeh, same'ish result for me.  Only decent game was against an item,heavy group, had Franklin's and one Survivor DC'd pretty fast after like 3 of em kept swarming a single Gen with me,batting em,away....downed em all and said dude dc'd after realizing the situation and lost item.
---
The rest of my games felt pretty awful with some SWFs as I was trying to learn the Shred ability...which was kinda awful to land on console, xP. I may revisit but jus didn't feel too fun, needs a fair bit of practice I guess
---
Demogrillgon
---
How dare you put the Handsome Ace in C and BEST GIRL DWIGHT in D?
---
You monster
---
Just don't get hit when he's camping the hook LOOOOOOL
---
This normaly happens in low ranks since killers are too weak and want to save atleast one kill. Once you go in higher ranks this will rarely happen.
---
Yeah I watched it the other day on Trues YouTube and was in absolute shock.  I've been playing since before the Wraith Cube and thought I had seen some broken shit during my time but nothing compares to what is shown in this video.  How the fuck did survivors ever get downed back then lol?
---
Im at rank 8 :) used to be 1
---
Nah nurse and spirit still number 1 and 2. I would argue he is better than billy now putting him at 3rd. His map pressure is nasty. Really fun.
---
got pictures?
---
The only one which I agree with is Tinkerer.
---
Unless you're a bloodpoint slut and want that coop bonus.
---
In all honesty once I‚Äôve lost the actual objective, my new objective is revenge. If I see a toxic survivor farm a hook off some newbie, I make *sure* that guy dies and i try to save the guy who got farmed. I am guilty of killing good survivors simply for being good (but only the ones who stun me like 7 times and flashlight blind me and adrenaline, yadda yadda.)
---
The icon is constantly active while in the dream world even if you aren't near him
---
This game is at least partially owned by the chinese. No fucking shit its overly monetized. It will only get worse.
---
Can‚Äôt wait to have my waifu spirit as a pop
---
so when its myers, it doesn't belong here but if its kate, you wanna see that? typical.. reddit isn't centered around you sweetie, others are loving this slightly nude myers the same way you love spirit's ass
---
It‚Äôs the smile shape, like V
---
The Magician or The Illusionist.
---
Weird, I usually play at red ranks but this never happens. Maybe other teammates make him angry? This could make him face camp you.
---
My favorite killers are doctor and myers. Got to rank 1 just using them 2 multiple times. That being said, doctor is pretty low teir so if you are anywhere above rank 10 I'd say wait for a reset to try him. He is arguably the best killer to use for farming blood points and is super rewarding learning how to use his shock.
---
On Guard can be replaced with Spine Chill, works better.
---
Not really. Each match there are about 6 unhooks available for you and they aren't guaranteed to be yours. I guess a SWF group could coordinate so that MoM would go off. It would become really strong but not broken like before.
---
Insta heals are nerfed so you have to wait 8s instead of being insta while EVERYTHING ELSE ABOUT MEDKITS ARE BEING BUFFED.. don't be so entitled, thanks.
---
I personally find almost all Kate's I find are mega toxic. Probably just me though. I don't really have a problem with Nea's or Claudette's.
---
new killer: The Break Time
---
How?
---
Legion is weak, but fun and a real blood points machine.
---
People often run Thanatophobia oh them because of their ability to easily injure and keep multiple people injured
---
Save The Best For Last is also a good perk on them, as you can get more stacks than an usual killer. You can use your power to stab a survivor twice. Even tho the second hit doesn't do anything to them, it gives you a free stack. You can also chain hits easily. You can take one of the Pin add-ons to give an additional status effect while doing that. Once fully stacked, Legion turns into a beast
---
If you have it, BBQ is always a good choice, even for the points alone. Legion generates a lot of points even when they lose. Doubling that is always welcome. Aura reading might also be useful. if you see two survivors nearby, you can go there and injure both of them, applying additional pressure
---
Ruin is always good, but for Legion Corrupt Intervention is a bit better. Legion excels when survivors are close together. Corrupt shrinks the map at the start of the game, making survivors more likely to be close to each other.
---
You can always slap NOED on if you have no other options
---
I fuckin love Claudette and Nea, dont be fooled &lt;3
---
Thank you for this explanation. I tried to save someone near an open exit gate against a Freddy recently and it didn't work, and I was scouring information to find out whether BT only works once in a match (as I'd already saved another person with it). Now I understand what happened (as he hit me as I was going for the save).
---
Adorable! But I hate wraith so I‚Äôm glad he dropped his ice cream.
---
If killers couldn't grab survivor would just avoid hits by jumping in lockers all game.
---
there's actually no bloodpoints in the rift like there were in the original leaks, which I'm thankful for.
---
even if it's a small amount and harmless on its own, I don't like the precedent it would set; that you could essentially pay for bonus bloodpoints
---
It should be f2p at this point. It has already a f2p system and now the battle pass..
---
But they keep the base game behind pay wall. That's very greedy. I've seen more f2p that gives you more stuff just by playing than DbD
---
I love this game but where is going is an awful road.. it feels like they wanna milk this game till it die and that's sad
---
So the pig?
---
This. People forget that the overwhelming majority is just casuals. They could, however, scale skill check difficulty with rank, or something like this.
---
F2p system in a game that you have to pay. Now is just being more evident.. I'm so sad this game is going just to get sucked dry out of greed..
---
but... what if we DON'T wake her up
---
im still disappointed its not bedsheet ghost myers
---
Nurse is free just lev her up, i don't recommend spirit fury, its good of course but without it you will learn more(whats your killer main btw?) Discordance its amazing on a lot of killers and build definately recommend it because legion other 2 perks are bad
---
Su rvivors can comunicate and thats broke the game, plus if they escape they keep their item and thats another game with a op item, if the killers go all in with the best add ons perks problaby will lose agaist a full swf with the best items, the game its mostly balanced i have 5 games in a row with a merciless and then 5 games of entity displesed depend on of the killer/survivor wants to use op things
---
Susie lookin kinda swole
---
Wish we had more add-ons like Michael Myers and Hag, where they add a new way to play the Killer, changing things up (Scratch Mirror, Body Blocker, Tombstone) but can actually be fun and at times, competent. Add-ons lately have been "Ok these 2-3 are pretty much the only ones I can see myself actually using...rest will collect dust"
---
Yes, he is a good killer but i very rarely see him play against a good survivor and i've been following him since he has like 50 viewers..this sub really overstimates streamers, the australian server is kind of a joke compared to the others
---
A 2k because the killer lost is one thing. 
---
A 2k because keys allowed survivors to bypass the objective is another thing entirely.
---
You joke, I had a lot of sessions yesterday with nothing but Claudettes DC'ing after the first phase hit. No one else though, just them.
---
I don't think this works for all chapters though. I'm pretty sure Jane isn't related to the plague
---
I get where you're coming from but if a decision ever made everyone happy we'd have world peace. I hate grinding but it's more content. Gameplay isn't any different just more rewards.
---
You have to turn it off in the settings files, just Google "how to turn off vsync in dbd" and there are heaps of helpful guides
---
I read specifically that The Nightmare and Cannibal's perks are in the base perk pool for killers on the switch soooo
---
I have the hardest time surviving against Mr TumTums, not gonna lie.
---
Plague and Spirit
---
Ash could kill the killer, so they renoved him of his weapons. They could do the same here.
---
They look nothing alike
---
Feels too much like InFamous characters and not enough like 80‚Äôs-90‚Äôs delinquents.  Good art but doesn‚Äôt feel right.
---
I need Joker as a survivor and society as the killer
---
I agree for the most part. Hag is a fantastic example for an add on kit. Her add ons effect and improve her ability, and then a few change her play style drastically.
---
Its fun to use and feels natural.
---
I also like having 3 tiers of add ons. Slightly moderately and considerably. It makes me feel like I don't get stuck using the same one add on every single game to get the boost I want.
---
I‚Äôm convinced he‚Äôs not weak per se, just not used *correctly* (people putting traps in too obvious locations, for example), cuz the few good trappers I‚Äôve gone against have been absolute NIGHTMARES to face.
---
Could you imagine if they nerfed Myers add ons?? Some of the most fun builds in the game gone?
---
I think I would have to retire at that point lol. 
---
But yeah I agree, let‚Äôs get more drastic addons that alter how you can play killers. It‚Äôs fun
---
What did this Huntress even try to accomplish..
---
Probably because being made a fool of and having your time wasted isn‚Äôt fun.
---
Going Dark already exists in Jeff's Distortion perk.
---
Unfortunately she's been eaten good
---
Unless youre hyper unlucky and not good enough to ever land 1 great skill check tapping might be faster 1 out of 50 times, in general though its slower and shows lack of character
---
Joey and Susie are tied at 2 each. Frank and Julie have a TON.
---
Also killer: James
---
James is terrifying
---
Plague is my current favorite: if survivors cleanse, I now have a ranged attack for 60 seconds; if they don‚Äôt, I can down them easily. Either way it‚Äôs a win-win in my book.
---
No kidding, it's not fun for the survivors left behind and it's definitely not fun for the killer and that whole "I DC to counter BBQ or so my teammate can escape" argument is such BS since I'm pretty sure most people would rather have someone to actually do something
---
If people still complain about nurse being broken after this fucking sledge, they are delutional
---
Nurse doesn‚Äôt need add ons to be strong or are there some base kit changes I‚Äôm not aware of?
---
I have played on Australian servers for a year, and now on European. There's no difference, honestly. It's just that he makes survivors appear average, he doesn't give them time to do gens and also abandons chases rather quickly if he gets looped, so it's hard to judge the skill level of the survivors.
---
Nah pigs too strong. She needs her 1000th nerf
---
Battlepass bad cuz fortnite bad
---
Been seeing A LOT of DC‚Äôs recently... I really wish BHVR would ban perpetual rage quitters already.
---
Have you lived under a rock this past week? She got a rework
---
Adrenaline is an earned second chance. There‚Äôs literally no argument against it.
---
Decisive was nerfed, now it‚Äôs an anti tunnel perk
---
Self care is shit, literal garbage
---
Preach on mate, I always will, because I don‚Äôt care about downvotes but it‚Äôs just alarming that so many people actually approve of it
---
There is a slight misconception, Self-Care was always a pretty strong perk choice, it was nerfed a bit in some recent patches where they basically made the heal take some 4-5s longer or so, and buffed the Item Heals. That's why people now view Self Care as not that good now (because Medkit is better basically). There is also an option to run Bond over Self-Care and just let *other survivors* heal you (because Bond aura reveals nearby survivors to you).
---
However, when you just start the game and you are at the bottom of Rank 20, Self-Care is still pretty strong. You won't have a large supply of medkits to always take with you, because you are new to the game you'll die constantly and so taking Self-Care is still a strong choice.
---
Bond is not as effective in low ranks because, as said, you are new, and other people are also new, so you won't always get to find somebody to heal you, or if you do, they are not even aware you are running after them and you want them to heal you.
---
TL;DR: Self-Care, although nerfed a small bit, still pretty strong, Medkits are stronger.
---
you said you'd rather see kate nude but you also said this doesn't belong here... does that not sound stupid?... myers is slightly nude and you're saying he doesn't belong here but a nude kate which is worse because she isn't slightly nude is something you'd rather see?
---
This whole thing about being ‚Äúentitled‚Äù is literally the most annoying thing on this sub reddit. Killers are entitled because anytime a survivor uses ANY good Pink/Purple add on they whine about it until it gets nerfed. Did you know killers actually got so upset about not getting points for people DCing because it was ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to their game (points) that they went on a ‚Äústrike‚Äù and BHVR had to update and give them 600 BP for a DC? Yet survivors got nothing until this newest PTB even though it was much more detrimental to a survivors game then killers. 
---
Medkits are being ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù to help you heal others not yourself, the buff is probably because they nerfed the instaheal to a passive that only heals you one health state instead of 2 which is going to make it so much easier for you super *entitled* killers to down them again! (Or not because I‚Äôve already seen killers complaining about them)
---
Would buy bc I love junk but lore wise he's not really fit. He'd try to kill the killer. All three of his perks would have to be asshole killer stun perks that would break the game lol
---
Sorry to say but Neas are viewed as the second most shitheads after Claudette, mainly because of n00b3 and his little fanboys
---
Yeah sheeet happens  and Im not a pro
---
Not true at all. It's just a meme.
---
Spirit beads bai bai
---
Have you seen Jake's bearded head since St patch? Look how they've massacred my boy.  ;_;
---
Omegablink is gone and multiblink is gone, but Nurse never needed those. 
---
She still ignores pallets, windows, and elevation. 
---
She's still easily the best in the game, and is still borderline unfair when played perfectly.
---
Yeah I get it shouldnt have even done the pic! Thanks the advice
---
No its fine, I love it ‚ù§
---
I am definitely still the first one.
---
Do you have Feng Min? Is not get her, she is &lt;3 
---
Leatherface if you play killer (bbq and chilli is a must have if you want to gain a lot of bloodpoints )
---
Plague is fun
---
Spirit is great
---
Stranger things is cool and comes with a lot 
---
Ash because... he‚Äôs groovy
---
Which I‚Äôm not good enough to land one everytime. Idk how it would show lack of character or why that even matters? ü§î
---
I summon Dark Magician!
---
It's all fun and games until the killer brings Franklin's demise, in all honesty, I've had so many situations where I was injured in a 2v1, and somebody ws either downed or on the hook , and self care gives me the opportunity to make sure I can tank a hit to save said person, no matter which phase they're in. If I just run up to a hooked person while I'm injured in a 1v2 I'm dooming myself, and seeing as how it's close to the end of the match, I'm sure I wouldn't have a medkit anymore, or one with enough charges for a full heal. That's kind of why I personally still use it, but in all honesty I'd rather swap it out for borrowed time to help with the immense amount of campers in the lower ranks. (which my friends are cause they're pretty new.)
---
Either way just remember, as long as somebody is getting healed, no matter in what way, something is going right.
---
Yup. That's why I only use beads when I wanna meme around and play a game of grab only. (Only grab from gens, pallets, windows, exit gates etc.)
---
The beads are broken so I'd feel bad using them while playing seriously.
---
Was just talking to my wife about this exact concept yesterday. I'd unironically love to have Shaggy as a survivor in this game.
---
Yeah bro I‚Äôm at uni at the moment but will reply with the template when I get back
---
One person powers, rest taps is the best way. 
---
If no one misses any great skillchecks, all power through.
---
Don‚Äôt be that guy. You get your money back. If you don‚Äôt have to pay another 10 dollars the next time around for the pass because of this, you got your money back. No one expects to get real money back
---
The white circles indicate a survivors looking at you from that direction and that is what will take you out of your ability other than getting stunned or hitting an attack. A good way to get better with any killer is to watch vids idk enough to give good advice on playing him but just keep playing and learn what makes him strong and what he isn‚Äôt so good at.
---
I have 150-ish but I don't use them unless I just wanna meme around by grabbing only.
---
The reason they won't add this, is because every survivor seeing this absolute unit would start furiously masturbating, thus allowing the killer to locate their moans of lust and killing them without any trouble.
---
You gotta give BHVR credit for not releasing something, the world just is not ready for yet...
---
It was a nerf, it‚Äôs just not as ‚Äúgame-ruining‚Äù as people think.
---
They don't realize it, but they ARE one of the toxic players, and I hate toxic people... Ignore when I play toxic piggy, that doesn't count
---
"When played perfectly" by that logic 80% of killers are gonna have 0 kills every game if both killer and survivors "plays perfectly"
---
Yep.
---
Did you have prayer beads?
---
I 100% agree
---
This is why i always prefered Bond over Self-care. You easily can find someone to heal you and work on a gen with, or know if they are going for a save, are being chased by the killer. Self-Care used to be good but no one use it anymore.
---
I have now, not during these matches though.
---
Time wasted not healing at hook: +12 seconds :/ 
---
I would've given up chasing after the unhook survivor and go do a gen, they obviously don't want heals.
---
I think it's good. Addons should have your playstyle slightly to add more variety, Having them as direct upgrades and "iwin" buttons is fucking boring. *cough*prayerbeads*cough*
---
All those lifts and yet still so skinny
---
Real-Time-StrategyyyYyy
---
Why are we waiting so long to do so? I mean it will die by this time.
---
Well, I didn‚Äôt make the meme, let alone make the date.
---
No its not on all killers you see somebody's aura across the whole map but, you're playing as trapper what are you going to do catch them instead of placing traps near the hook?
---
Slim chance, same goes with ghostface, hag, doc Myers, pig or even huntress sometimes because she is slow, it only really works well on hillbilly and nurse maybe freddy and maybe demogorgon but only when you place your portals smartly which most people don't do, all I'm saying is that you can surely find a better perk than bbq.

---
I'm 100% for this but I feel us console plebs will be at a disadvantage lmao.
---
Ultra rare add-ons should make the match unique. Like Mirror Myers or Prayer Beads Spirit (i know it's not ultra rare, but it should imo). 
---
Just make ultra rare a special occasion, like being able to teleport from one side of the map to the other, give extra speed for some seconds... idk, something useful and somehow special.
---
Then be more specific, saying you'd rather have one thing instead of the other thing means you want to replace the other thing with what you want. Also please stop trying to act condescending when you don't know how to spell comment :/
---
Ofc its will be console vs console lmao
---
Yall accidentally tunnel after slugging everyone?
---
The "the"
---
You forgot selfish
---
Console vs console would be fun.
---
To each their own, but increasing map awareness in regards to survivor's whereabouts is far from a wasted perk slot.
---
That was sexy
---
Yeah, but at the end of the day, noOb3 is a good boi.
---
Ah yes yes yes, you're completely totally right. How did I not see that. Also hiding with a character because she's harder to spot totally equals tbagging, flashlight spam and general toxicity. No trying to hide is the real toxicity now. Thank you for opening my eyes.
---
If its with pc im uninstalling
---
I have to disagree. Meg looks innocent. Claudette and Nea both equally look like gremlins ready to cause mischief.
---
Im going to get hit when i am safely over a vault because the servers are registering im further back and the killer is hitting that
---
It jumps down when a Survivor dies
---
I honestly wish self healing was a passive ability, but, maybe at like 30% or 35% or something. 
---
I substance abused self care for years and can‚Äôt live without it. I want my 4th perk slot back :(
---
Console vs console for solo 
---
But I still hope pc can cross play as well, so if a friend wants to join they can, but we get matched with pc players
---
Hide the broken status until they've been hit for the first time at least
---
Imo if pc player want to join console friend they need to connect controller to the pc first
---
When i play survivor i play kate and im not toxic at all, but this list is just your opinion. Well... be happy that a non toxic kate is out there waiting to survive with you :)
---
But what you were saying is that you get hit when survivor, AND can't hit as killer.
---
If you have trouble in both situations, it most likely isn't the dedicated server that is the issue. If other palyer managed to evade your hit when you are a killer, or hit you when you are a survivor.
---
I was thinking a custom slot, but yeah, the variety of skin models will probably make it impossible
---
I've complained about it
---
There's so much BS in here it's not even funny
---
Highley reccomend btw
---
TUMPUMP*high pitched screeching
---
yall mf jokin but this would be the incognito killer you all would have asked for
---
well....that sucks for you
---
It's a pretty simple fucking connection dude. Hiding =&gt; bad survivors thinking they're good =&gt; being cocky =&gt; toxicity. Plus Claudette is the most, or at least one of the most, popular survivor and that means she's likely to have the most toxic players. Idk why you're so erect for defending her unless you're a toxic Claudette player yourself.
---
What? 
---
No, a console player would connect to a pc friend.. not the other way
---
If you want to play with a friend who owns the game on pc, you would be matched in a pc game. It makes sense so randoms on console wouldn‚Äôt get matched to pc players
---
Idk what the fuzz is I've had a great time on dedicated servers usually get a ping of 30-50ms and so far everything seems fair
---
Hey OP, if you don't want to buy the pass, which is just cosmetics. .  . . . Don't
---
Seriously what a childish statement to expect more content for free
---
Freddie giving insta heal
---
Very actually and useless if anything last time I used the marker it cucked me bc I was too focused to look at the marker
---
Honestly people just do it now and not even for that reason. It‚Äôs a cheap strategy that killers should not be rewarded for. I‚Äôm okay with camping in terms of hiding nearby but don‚Äôt face camp to where nothing can be done. I know people make the argument it hurts the killer bc more gens can get done but no that‚Äôs not enough.
---
People who uses the clapping emoji don‚Äôt have an opinion
---
ive played pc since beta and eventually started using a controller to get prepared for playing on console. its not as hard as you think especially 360'ing killers.
---
No actually it makes sense. She is buying time for EGC to kill the downed OP. If she managed to hit the other survivor by throwing an hatchet, she would have 2 injured survs in front of an exit already opened which means 1 kill unless dead hard. She didn‚Äôt assume unbreakable was in play. 
---
Picking up the Nea would have meant stun by pallet. Chasing the other one was pointless since Nea could have just crawled out. Huntress didn‚Äôt do anything wrong except missing with her throw.
---
It's a brown add-on now plus after a few games with it u should be used to the ranges
---
I liked Freddy 1000 times more before the rework
---
How is using perks to your advantage to survive toxic??? Just go with what you‚Äôve admitted‚Äî you just kill good survivors. Nothing about what you described is toxic if they are saving someone from a hook LOL
---
You say "you have to pay for the battle pass". No you don't. Pretend it doesn't exist and your life literally won t be any different. Nobody is forcing you into this dude.
---
This actually happens A LOT more in higher ranks in my experience.
---
Incase you were looking, I've made it a custom perk appearance.

Rank does not seem to matter then, tunneling is easly counterd, though camping isnt. As I understand it may be caused because they are looped too long. This can get some killers angry. I think the camping you are reffering as is Proxy-Camping, this is the hardest one to counter.  The best way to avoid being camped is to not die. I know it sounds obvious, but then why complain. Behaviour isnt going to do anything.
---
Decisive is fine and fair, only thing a little tilting about it is if youre not tunneling somebody and just happen to find them at like the tail end of their decisive and down them without thinking and get hit with it. Its withing the time limit so its fine, but its a bit annoying.
---
Old Decisive was the only version worth complaining about
---
You can blame the first one. 
---
Anyways Iridescent Head +2 extra Hatches Huntress ist just not fun to play against.
---
The rank affects unitentional Camping (Trying to save a kill), being toxic in higher ranks will cause this.
---
Nurse add-ons where just direct upgrades they did nothing interesting her base kit is enough without the old broken add-ons her new ones introduce something fun. Spirit is probably next or billy. 
---
But my point is as Hag her add-ons can change her playstyle completely and that should be how add-ons work imo
---
you know by control, he meant that the killer literally controls the game? as a host? As in it's reliant on the killer... Not that the killer has control over the map or anything
---
Not really fair that survivors lose a pip all there add ons and items and all the blood points they earned in a match when a killer dcs, it‚Äôs fucking retarted
---
No like they said torsos and pants would also get universal versions for the battle pass
---
Oh fuck yea I've missed the noed discuss posts
---
Its just a baby dweet how could you
---
Haha whys that?
---
Addendum: We still need that face rework and cosmetics for Quentin
---
and thats your fair right
---
In my experience it's how it usually is.
---
&gt; if you aren‚Äôt the obsession you have to wiggle to use it
---
This is how it used to work but not with current DS. Every survivor has the chance to use it during the pick up animation, Obsession or not.
---
Aww those are cute furries in the background
---
Jane
---
I think "The Scream" would be good, just to stay on theme with the movie
---
the idea is that it's supposed to be "hard mode" for survivor, but there's no reward for playing the hard mode other than clout so why do it?
---
Apart from Legion - who has it as part of their gimmick - skins don't tend to be "other people" though. Like, the killer would surely be Pinhead/Elliot Spencer.
---
The good ol days
---
Dc
---
Yes but they could change things to reduce killer's toxicity. That's what worries me. I mean there are several ways to punish each toxic behaviour from the killer's side for once, such as camping the hook, tunneling and facecamping.
---
I think this is how it works with latest CoD, correct me if I‚Äôm wrong - console plays against console unless they opt in to playing vs PC or play with a friend on PC. Seems like the fairest way to do it.
---
I'm on a semester abroad and my laptop can run DbD on about 15-20 fps. I will probably die a lot this event but as long as I get it, I don't care.
---
She was waiting for hatch...
---
Complaining because you don't get hits you didn't deserve anymore?
---
Great skill checks are really not that hard. Just keep powering through ruin until you are good enough to hit them every time, Run DS, Do SOMETHING that will teach you how to hit a skill check.
---
Exactly, thank you lol
---
Could be worse, they could all be still sitting on gens.
---
Why should change the add-on, so additional hatchets can't use with it. Also maybe slow the locker opening time as penalty
---
The Girl With A Cleaver
---
NOED solution; just do totems, there's only 5, it doesn't take long and half of them usually spawn next to gens
---
Kind of defeats the purpose of the perk.  They run it because they aren't particularly good and usually don't get their hooks until it activates anyways.  It was designed for newer players still learning the game and wanting that feeling of taking the anxiety off of having to prevent the gens from popping that they don't really have the game knowledge to stop at that point.  Basically a Yellow and Green rank perk though you do see some unfortunate souls never outgrow it and run it through reds though the likelihood of seeing it diminishes greatly the higher you rank up.  With the generous changes the devs made to cleansing points, emblem progress and the addition of perks that encourage cleansing totems beginning with Inner Strength I don't really think it needs a rework.  I'm hoping more survivors catch on and just start popping totems more consistently 1000 points for a dull is incredibly generous.  I used to get annoyed at that perk but then started running Small Game.  They don't get their NOED to spawn usually at all against me and bonus I pretty much always find their Hex totems in under a minute.  Pop on Small Game if you're facing it constantly at your rank and you'll punish them so hard for wasting a perk slot.
---
I‚Äôd rather that sometimes, tbh.
---
They dont get rewarded for it. They lose points for being close to hook and will most likely not get the hook actions bonus either
---
I know i always do them but me playing solo having to do them all when gens also need to be prioritzed wastes time as you don‚Äôt know if the other solos have done them. We do them all as swf.
---
I mean if you can ruin my game with bringing that build I have every right to ruin yours too
---
Yeah. In reality, in over 900 hours of actively playing killer and survivor since the game's release I can count on one hand how many games have had toxic survivors like that.
---
I believe those are only emblem points, which count towards your *rank*, but are different from BP, since you can't use them to *level* up characters.
---
Though the animatronics are possed by child souls who have emotions
---
Hmmm if IT was only a way to design the head seperately for this mori and maybe some cosmetics... 
---
One could dream
---
Low chance... But Ive seen Killers just straight up go AFK and not play. And a 4queue can easily say, fuck it lets all go afk and collect those unlimited points till he comes back?
---
Run the new detective's hunch that will activate after any gen, easy
---
Ay, he's doing my strat!
---
PS5 can play PS4 games, but would be sad if Dead by Daylight doesn't improve the game for Xbox &amp; PS next generation. But if they do something like a remaster, I don't want to loose my progress for switching to a "newer" version.
---
You have to pay for the rift but they provide 2k lauric cells for you to try it out
---
U sure? I have never lost any of the things u have just said when a killer dcs. All I ever lose is an offering which is still better than when all survivors dc
---
I‚Äôm rank 4 and we always do them as swf but solo u just can‚Äôt trust the others as hardly anyone does them still. If team is struggling and the games going quickly, gens are more of a priority
---
Man, Der Krankenschwester will have downed you before you've even finished saying her name to your teammates.
---
I sometimes run around with a map instead of small game and you can find them all easyyyy
---
It‚Äôs what you deserve
---
It's capped at 32k
---
I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs only on ps4 but it‚Äôs a HUGE problem if the killer is about to lose they just dc so that everyone loses and wastes there time
---

Lauries I go against are skillful and serious about objectives.

Remember when For Honor had Peer 2 Peer servers and lost most its player base for awhile because of it, with Peer 2 Peer it would be an absolute lag fest

Or just start healthy and the perk only triggers from when you're put in the injured state.
---
for 2 minutes lol
---
We get the serum, it's up to you as to what you spend it on.
---
I don‚Äôt mind if they don‚Äôt change it all, and when it happens in game it is what it is. Just thought of weather it could be an idea
---
Yeah
---
The serum is just for this year, although the last year sets are on sale right now
---
I mean that Trapper skin is in the PC game files so hopefully it comes one day.
---
Devs already said they‚Äôre not gonna touch NOED. No point in trying to change it. Players have been complaining about it since day 1.
---
Just do totems. It‚Äôs not that bad
---
I do, i‚Äôm not complaining just a suggestion
---
Then you die on your first hook üôÇ
---
I hope they get married
---
thats not cool. thats an entire hook/bleed out Timer
---
play survivor
---
Honestly the best way in my experience is to just play a lot of killer, every game gets easier. I also play ghost face so if 4 people escape atleast I can teabag with them at the exit gate.
---
I love this!
---
Would make this game so much better and a little less repetitive (although I really enjoy DBD)
---
Get something that calms your anxiety. Maybe that‚Äòs going to help
---
Can't relate I've had great games it doesn't feel very different from the usual games but I never had to deal with a lobby of 150ms
---
***\*sad rank 10 claudette noises\****
---
I meant that people in general complain about it. The good thing is that it‚Äôs seen less often in the higher ranks
---
I want his Evil within me :3
---
kinda hot. B/
---
Fuck your win. I want to know more about these swings.
---
Isn‚Äôt his bame Ghost afce in the franchise? I just watched the first Scream movie, they never had any name to him except one time one of the casualties called him ghost face before dying
---
Have you been playing killer? There's some major bugs on the killer side too but mostly you won't notice as killer how bad they are.
---
Agreed I am a primarily solo queue player and got annoyed at going down to NOED to killers that I ran all game so I put on Small Game.  Run it soloqueue and watch how much you alone can do to prevent it from spawning.  It's so much free bp's for you too.
---
I always see it, just got to rank 4, still see it. It‚Äôs satisfying when noed doesnt pop and u see killers perks and he had it
---
Killer and survivor and besides 1 game where the other killer had a ping of 500ms and couldn't catch anyone it was fine
---
i dont get anxiety over playing killer but its not as tilting of an experience to me if im in a party chat with a couple of people, maybe that would help
---
With a $30 game, average $7 chapters, several cosmetic sets pre store, $10.80 premium cosmetics, now a $10 battle pass (you can earn back if you play enough, hope nothing in life sidetracks that goal). It keeps adding up, and if people say "why complain now?" I've been complaining about the store's prices.
---
Yeah my friend does because he‚Äôs sick of it and sick of ruin lol will try it.
---
As someone who only ever played no addon nurse, im now burning thro my 800+ omegablink combos before they kill it.
---
He still doesn‚Äôt really cut off the fingers. The finger just rotates inside the hand so it looks like it‚Äôs not there. Swapping a whole mesh wouldn‚Äôt be that smooth at all, especially in a networked game.
---
Oh absolutely man, maps are crazy against totems.  If I'm playing killer and I see a map in my lobby I change my loadout and remove any hex perk I was running.  It's pointless to keep it on.  It'll just be gone in a minute.  That's when Ruin turns into Corrupt Intervention typically.
---
Even if you play alot to justify the pass, sometimes life says no and you won't have the time
---
Really? I honestly only see it during rank reset. It‚Äôs rare when I see NOED in the red ranks.  
---
Guess I‚Äôm lucky
---
It might be a visual glitch as from what I know it may appear that u lost ur items, bp and rank but will usually fix itself after some time. But it could just be the game being a buggy mess as per usual or as u said it could be a PS4 issue as I‚Äôm on Xbox and this doesn‚Äôt usually happen.
---
You would think for a guy with an otter body type he would be drawn more like that to match his icons but no Dwight is always constantly drawn petit, skinny and with a baby face like a ‚Äútwink‚Äù so i call him as such.
---
I love imagining killers being able to perhaps cut cables so if you lay the cable before the gen gets done you run the risk of having to repair said cable if a killer cuts it. In my head it sounds like a fun little idea that in reality would probably come with a lot of downsides but I agree. After 700+ hours I still have fun, but it truly gets repetitive.
---
Did you just complain about DS?
---
It'll change your life lol.  I started running it consistently like 2 months ago and I can't even tell you the amount of times I'm on their Ruin in 30 seconds flat.  Feelsbadman, sorry killers.
---
yep looks good
---
I rather pay for the skins than pay and grind for them.
---
What a pussy approach
---
She's definitely an ideal starter because of SC. Before players learn the nuance of surviving and cooperating/coordinating with teammates and maximising efficiency. I see experienced teammates suck at this, let alone rookies.
---
It'll be strong enough to tear the flesh clean off her skull leaving it in a mangled mess, which would be an improvement for David, let's be honest. But looking at it from a purely biological point of view, you're right, those venus fly trap lips are designed to trap, the teeth are designed to trap and tear. He doesn't actually have a jaw or teeth to accompany a jaw that might help it crush bones and the likes.
---
I don't know how true that is at red ranks since I've never played there, but even in purple ranks I was able to make pre-rework Freddy work without needing to use perks that were considered meta. If anything I'd argue certain killers like Freddy benefited more from specialized builds.
---
If you just tap the gen for 1-2 seconds then get off, then repeat, the skill checks will proc but not appear, so you skip doing them entirely.
---
Slower than hitting the checks but better than dealing with Ruin.
---
Most likely they will be next and if we are lucky they might finally rework Insidious to something less campy, while doing so.
---
To be honest, Claudettes were toxic pieces of shit waaaaay before Ochido because people would intentionally play Claudette for Blendette advantages, especially with New Moon Offerings. Christ, it was impossible to find those people and they would always have insta heals.
---
Just because they were more op in the past, does not for sure say its all balanced now
---
That's because you can't actually see the Blendettes without Thermal and active sonar.
---
My NOED rarely works because they just cleanse all the totems, like out of the past 10 matches NOED has only worked twice
---
Ugh im jealous i was gonna go but couldnt
---
Yeah, the ring is pretty fine
---
I'd love to travel back in time just to kick some booty in this game, even without the infinites survivors were ridiculously powerful
---
&gt;but I think very few people care about the new survivors.
---
Eh, About as many who care about the demogorgan.
---
Least survs have some useful perks.
---
You said you had 65 ping. If the player you were facing started lagging really hard, he would acuse you
---
I sometimes bring detectives hunch and power through a gen, most of the time one of the totems that highlight is ruin
---
&gt; *You know how games used to be where you played the game enough or you did certain things to earn cool items to keep the game fresh and make you want to keep playing to unlock more things?*
---
What kind of games are we talking about here?
---
I remember Street Fighter II being around $80 when it first appeared, and then about half a year later Turbo arrived for the same price, with bugfixes and a little new content, and no one wanted to touch the original anymore. Neither game had unlocks.
---
Are we perhaps talking about the Resident Evil series?  I had to run half a dozen scenarios back to back in Resident Evil 2 to get my hands on Tofu, it didn't feel fresh in the slightest. I eventually burned myself out replaying Code Veronica X to get the same unlocks that I had in the Dreamcast version (darn spiders ruining my A rank).
---
As u/MichaelExile points out, this is an *old* game. We are paying for *new* content. It's not like BHVR have been sitting on these cosmetics for three years, or saying the title is "complete" and we should be waiting on the sequel. This new system is like the Starcraft Warchests - you like the game, you play the game, you want to look pretty, you get the bundle and it saves you money in the long run, as well as letting you get the content earlier than other players. You get your unlocks just for playing the game, an activity that players should normally enjoy, and at the same time you're also ensuring that the game keeps running and keeps getting updated - rather than taken out back for the Old Yeller special.
---
Maybe I'm just odd, but I will gladly take this system over "how games used to be", where we'd now be playing "Dead by Daylight: Dead Harder" and complaining about all the content that wasn't ported from the previous versions.
---
Don't get me wrong, though - if the Rift starts handing out challenges like "Meet the requirements for Evil Incarnate achievement twenty times" or "All four survivors must escape without add-ons, without perks, and without crouching" then I'll certainly be at the front of the line with my pitchfork and torch. From what I've seen the requirements can be met by "normal gameplay". Maybe not as easy as Starcraft's "just play the game and have fun" approach, but certainly not deliberately arranged to force you to buy your way through them.
---
I understand people feel differently, and that's everyone's right, but to me it feels like some people have false memories regarding the nature of "how games used to be".
---
Thank you to the people who‚Äôve commented, I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm not good at replies but I‚Äôll try your suggestions and see if it helps
---
Those two ppl look autistic compared to bruce. Hes just too groovy!
---
You don't need BBQ and you can swap Ruin for Pop on most killers now.
---
Hell, Spirit and Nurse straight up don't need any meta perks to body survivors at red ranks.
---
I would prefer not
---
Only problem with that idea is that if one team dies the other team is screwed. It'd need to be something that both groups can do somehow.
---
Plagues new cosmetic should also spit that orange serum instead of normal green puke
---
I hear people saying this but don‚Äôt really understand. How do you get your $10 worth of cells back?
---
Thanks a lot ! Also I was wondering when is the best time to activate night shroud? When I'm near a generator?
---
I gotchu bro it's Machikado Mazoku.
---
Shows kinda shit though even by trashy seasonal anime standards so Id skip it if I were you
---
The same way demogorgon can see where his portal would be
---
If you think that 3 different point add ons is fun and a good idea then we are so different there is no point in debating.
---
Glad i'm not the only one who thinks this. I like DLC killers from franchises, but if they release another one, that'll make it a year since an original killer was added into the game, and not someone from a popular franchise.
---
Getting someone to actually heal you, though.  That's something bond can't do.
---
Yes dead hard is a picture of a guy running AND the joker runs in his movie? Wow, mind blown, /r/conspiracytheories will have a field day with this one. 
---
Seriously this proves this sub is filled with kids.
---
pennywise really outdid himself this time
---
This is why there should be temp ban system implemented!
---
same goes for michael pig and wraith (michael doesn't need monitor and abuse to have 0 terror radius in tier 1 anymore)
---
amazing changessss
---
Playing against noobs as spirit. Those poor survivors.
---
Yea that's literally the entire thing I'm complaining about. They're all meme and gimmick add ons
---
Wait is update out??
---
Sarcasm?
---
Is that a halloween design on Spirit?
---
Yes I seen monto‚Äôs video on it and I was like I gotta have it !
---
Probably $40
---
sally's already taken
---
Isn't she a widow though?
---
What use would iri head be then? No survivor is stupid enough to stand exactly behind another survivor (unless they‚Äôre going for a protection hit) then what would it do? Too situational I say. Anyway, you can still dodge iri head.
---
Lol yeah I never had it happen tho
---
Hollyshit I'm definitely copying you
---
I‚Äôm confused are the skins already out?
---
The Slasher, The Stalker, The Serial Killer, The Chaser, The Cloaked and The Cloak-and-Dagger sound good imo
---
When the match starts, use it immediately. You‚Äôll be able to catch your first survivor off guard more easily because you have no terror radius and no red stain. Survivors shouldn‚Äôt spawn near you so there‚Äôs no reason not to use it at the start. 
---
Otherwise, you want to use it often but not when you‚Äôre in the open or when a survivor is nearby. Just be aware of your surroundings. Activating it when you‚Äôre approaching a gen can be good if you suspect someone is there. 
---
Some things to bear in mind:
---
* Survivors have a third person camera so they can sometimes reveal you when you can‚Äôt see them. 
---
* Survivors that are on the ground in the dying state, on your shoulder being carried, and on the hook can all reveal you. 
---
* You can be revealed within 32 metres by default.
---
If I had more prayer beads and mother daughter rings I would of let them go but I only had 1 of each left and no black wards either.  :(
---
Not only that.
---
If you are unsure weither you will complete the pass or not, you can just decide to play the free track and if you reach the point at which you gain your Cells back you can just spend them and it will unlock every premium content you would have unlocked if you paid at the beginning. So you can make sure to only pay if you get your Cells back.
---
I wasn't expecting them to be clear, I was expecting them to be coloured. Man looks like he popped the lenses out of a pair 3d glasses
---
I don‚Äôt believe licensed content would ever be in the rift at any time
---
I also want to have the game but my Laptop is to bad for it but I hope my Computer can handle the game.
---
Noed and bloodwarden aren't viable perks at red rank you almost never see good killers running them. And ruin does nothing against good survivors, they just hit the hex skill check. If you do get a game where ruin does work it can still be cleansed 30 seconds into the game. Survivors have busted add-ons and perks too, adrenaline, borrowed time, insta heals(for now)
---
ONE HOUR of work? Uhh, triple thumbs up my guy. Sounds great.
---
The Priest or The Demon would make the most sense.
---
They actually seem interesting, not sure about balance. Sympathy seems a little strong, would remove the "Can't heal other survivors" at least.
---
I like the idea of electrician. Having exhaustion perks be more than just "Extend chase via X" is nice, should create some variety. 
---
Selfish seems cool - I was actually thinking about a buff to WGLF which is similar to this. Ontop of the bloodpoint gains it would heal the person you unhook to full health and give you the broken status for 60/50/40.
---
That sucks man I play on PS4 it‚Äôs all right.
---
I‚Äôm doing the same thing. I love it but just being put under the toxic player makes me sad
---
[I wasn't talking about him](https://i.imgur.com/ilFdmTL.png)

so would you rather have addons made for fun / change up how the nurse plays / give her a challenge or would you want the old addons that was just direct upgrades

I know you're trying to shit on pig players.. but the title is just talking about pig mains.
---
I don't think anyone has a problem with the archives, it's just the rift that's a bit divisive.
---
My concerns with it are addressed though, since cosmetics will be available later.
---
I'd bang
---
It‚Äôs in some twitch stream from last year (could be roughly 2 years now)  that they did to clear the air on why they don‚Äôt always change things when the ‚Äúpublic‚Äù wants things. Aka looking out for the common player rather the community player. It was purely states on things like the most played survivor, who survivors the most, the killer who kills the most, etc. I do remember that majority of the player base is solo, if not plays with a single friend. No one played with a whole group and I don‚Äôt recall them saying what ranks played with groups more/less.
---
The Naughty Kill-y Stabby Man
---
I asked where it‚Äôs better and most people say computer because the fanbase there is larger.
---
I like a good mix of both. Hag and Wraith are fantastic examples. 80% are direct upgrades and a handful of interesting and unique add ons
---
Tbh I love facing Spirt, keeps me on my toes
---
yeah, and the worst part is that everytime new perks get introduced, not only is the grind longer but theres less chances at getting the perks you want. Double BP is a start but i think they need to change the way the system works but thats never going to happen as long as it keeps being profitable.
---
It definitely is worth it if you can afford a PC but PS4 isn‚Äôt a bad option either.
---
Even at rank 20 people dc against spirit, that's kinda amusing lol
---
I hate to say it but this is pretty much par for the course on reddit. This is essentially a front page post for r/showerthoughts
---
Out of 3 women and Steve still has the most feminine voice lol
---
I haven‚Äôt had a single match today where a survivor hasn‚Äôt dc‚Äôd. Mostly on the hook but have had a couple dc the moment I pick them up. That aside, why do you survivors t-bag a killer that you aren‚Äôt doing well against? Like yes its toxic but I seriously don‚Äôt get doing it, all it does it mean I‚Äôm gunna make sure you die first. Had a couple today drop pallets then proceed to t-bag me, one also did so when they kept vaulting through the same window and I wasn‚Äôt getting my timing right, very quickly caught and hooked them though. Very satisfying.
---
You can imagine them being like ''WTF JUST HAPPENED''
---
Still haven't seen either of those two's perks in the general pool. Level 40 Hag now. Maybe it would be further in.
---
Ironworks is still just as bad
---
And there was me hiding in the building while your getting penetrated üòÇü§£
---
Thank you ^-^
---
"I was... the nicest one"

[I gave it my best shot, here you go](https://imgur.com/a/mrDqmBW)
---
queue times are just an easy excuse. beating up purples is nothing to brag about and 2-3 weeks after rank reset even most at red ranks arent that great. Only way to really judge is to see him face rank 1 survivors within 1 week after rank reset because those are the top tier survivors.
---
While I liked to watch his stream for a long time once I realized that he intentionally only kills low ranks survivors and how toxic that is for the community I just couldnt watch him anymore.
---
Theres nothing wrong with any of that stuff. Insta medkits maybe but still. I hardly see how using broken shit is fair against anything. No perks in the game are that broken.
---
Congrats! Hope you all the best for you and your partner.
---
Gunna be real, stalk is not very good on him. The strength of GhostFace is that he has on call 0 terror radius and no red stain WITHOUT any drawbacks. You can use his night shroud to get right up on a survivor and either start a chase with initiative or get a grab, it can also be used mid chase to help confuse the survivor. Stalking while leaning is pretty good if you want to use it, along with crouching, just be mindful that stalking in this game can be really finicky when it comes to shrubbery.
---
In my experience P3 Quentins tend to be the most toxic
---
Fuck Ochido he made us spooky Claudettes look toxic and scary. Something I will never do in a post-game chat is say "gG eZ dUd" because that's aids. That is literal fucking aids.
---
The nurse isn‚Äôt gone at all lol. Her perks have been buffed and she cannot follow up double blinks 100% of the time anymore. Still viable to play
---
nah I only argue from the fact I think people are overreacting to the changes
---
Yess I have some friends that use PC would be awesome
---
A Spirit with prayer beads, MDR and all gen perks. I‚Äôm not surprised people dced.
---
Literally nurse was a fraction of what I'm talking about. Stop hijacking the post :)
---
This is amazing, I love everything about it! Excellent work, friend!
---
double the legion,
---
Power couple time
---
Good thing survivors can‚Äôt take the game hostage now. (Sarcasm)
---
I want 2vs8!
---
Also Nancy's perk being extremely useful makes her viable too.
---
They do like 90% of the time unless you farmed them
---
r/dbdgonewild and r/dbdgonegay
---
I just want an original killer, we haven‚Äôt gotten any original content since plague
---
That‚Äôs the hidden passive. When you‚Äôre on a gen, you‚Äôll do half of it without even getting a skill check. You may not even know they have Ruin till it‚Äôs exploded. 
---
But if you try to heal someone, you‚Äôll get maybe 5 skillcheck sin the span of 7 seconds.
---
Honestly all I think they need to do to prayer beads is make it an ultra rare and MAYBE make her footsteps louder if she is using them.
---
no just the new event cosmetics :)
---
Tbf I'm actually a survivor main but if I get tunneled I just run meta perks including DS ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Uhm... 32 seconds spent healing instead of 16 isnt time wasted? Plus sloppy adds way more than 4 seconds. I dont get your thought process.
---
They‚Äôre back online. yes.
---
hey buddy I made 1 comment about 1 part and you decided to follow up on it
---
The patch notes from the Stranger Things chapter.
---
A lot of people also switched from Self Care to Inner Strength. And if you don't feel comfortable walking around injured for a long time you can always use a perk that helps you find other survivors easier so that they can heal you (Empathy, Bond, Better Together et) :)
---
How do you do custom backgrounds?
---
Oddly enough, in my language translates into ‚Äúthe‚Äù everything except Ghostface which is just Ghostface.
---
Imagine thinking self care is anything but a time waster.
---
One survivor healing for 32 seconds = to two survivors busy for 16. Sloppy makes it so it takes 20 seconds if being healed or 40 with SC, effectively adding 4 seconds
---
What are you looking for? To have fun, to win, just some good perks? Kinda depends, there are a few pretty good dlcs
---
I've always thought a battle pass goes very well with dbd
---
Welcom to mah world, betch.
---
Borrowed Time.
---
Why were you such a thundercunt in your original message then
---
Ok, this is epic.
---
I think one of the reasons is the demo is trying to kill you by breaking your neck, not eat your head
---
Why u so baad doood
---
Tbh I hate deliverance more since there's pretty much nothing you can do about it
---
I'm not a gnelf
---
Clown has learned the powers of positive vibes on an astral level  and will literally kill you with it
---
This is honestly fucking amazing
---
For a sec I actually though this was archives material
---
Great work!
---
Myers can literally ignore the entity's commands. That's why he's able to kill without a mori.
---
1000 auric cells are 10 dollars right? Cause that‚Äôs not too bad
---
probably the best killer in the game
---
I hate deliverance as a survivor, since I sometimes get farmed just so they can have their proc.
---
So right self care is super slow , ever since I got Nancy tho that locker healing perk came in pretty clutch from time to time. Id still use self care just if I'm using the right setups for it or not.
---
I feel like electrician makes it worse because skill checks aren‚Äôt hard and can give you more progress if done right
---
&gt;This whole thing about being ‚Äúentitled‚Äù is literally the most annoying thing on this sub reddit. Killers are entitled then because anytime a survivor uses ANY good Pink/Purple add on they whine about it until it gets nerfed
---
Should I bring up freddy? Or maybe some killer perk. nurse? How it's rumored they are gonna nerf huntress iri and they will for how often ppl disconnects just for it. I can go on for very long time
---
Like for DS that needed 2y to be fixed. Infinities that stayed for so long and for survivors they were fine and so on
---
&gt;Did you know killers actually got so upset about not getting points for people DCing because it was ‚Äúdetrimental‚Äù to their game (points) that they went on a ‚Äústrike‚Äù and stopped playing the game so BHVR had to update and give them 600 BP for a DC? Yet survivors got nothing until this newest PTB even though it was much more detrimental to a survivors game then killers. 
---
Welp, I would too since it's bs to get nothing because a whiny kid ragequit. The fact you're defending that is hilarious
---
Yes it is more detrimental for survivors but, how often killers DC and how often survivors dc? I can count in a hand how many times killers dced on me, I lost count long ago how many survivors I've seen DC. But it's their way to say "nerf this" and it's working. Worked on Freddy worked on nurse, soon I predict spirit and iri heads from huntress because of these DC
---
&gt;Medkits are being ‚Äúbuffed‚Äù to help you heal others not yourself, the buff is probably because they nerfed the instaheal to a passive that only heals you one health state instead of 2 which is going to make it so much easier for you super *entitled* killers to down them again! (Or not because I‚Äôve already seen killers complaining about them)
---
Unironically defending insta heals.. which still very useful still plus a buff to heal others in matter of seconds. What else do you want? You can still use insta heals in chases if you're good, 8s not getting hit isn't a big deal! 
---
It was bs that you hit someone they run faster than the killer while he's stuck in the place. Go to a safe loop, insta heal, start over.
---
I've seen the speed of the medkits and they are very strong now, especially now that people prefer not run self-care and let others heal them. Seriously, what's your point?
---
PS: it's nice you say calling people entitled is cancer then you proceed to call me entitled killer. I said entitled in general and you proceeded to accuse me I'm so low to play 50% of the game, that's so sad..
---
its the clown from killing floor 2
---
Depends on the definition of benefit. Sometimes it‚Äôs not about points.
---
Same can be said about leaving the match mid game
---
Thanks, I have Save the best for last as a teachable, I also have bbq which is a good perk, I have nurse to level 20 so I just have to keep leveling her up. But I have a question, when someone is mending can you see them with nurses calling?
---
I doubt they will do that. Since you earn the cells back, they would know tier buying wouldn‚Äôt work, and a waste of effort.
---
Hmm I wonder what they need to optimize the game... also why would it matter, it‚Äôs purely cosmetic items, they offer no extra power or strength. Let BHVR rack up that money.
---
I was in a game with a friend of a friend who has played maybe a total of 5 games and in our first game he died very early because he decided to go against our advice and attempt escape and then he got killed after we unhooked him and he instantly threw down a pallet when the killer wasn‚Äôt nearby and then quick vaulted a window. And then in the next game it took him till we were loading in to decide he didn‚Äôt want to play anymore. I obviously want to be nice to new player but...
---
Ahh I see... 8k for each...
---
Perhaps these sorts of killers should consider uninstalling the game then.
---
To be honest, it would take an actually spectacular skin to make me change the outfit I'm using on Susie now
---
Bhvr litteraly smurfs your account for you every month
---
Just get good. Or take a death to let your team escape
---
Only problem is that most killers using bloodwarden this way know it slows down the timer. The only time they down someone is when they actively decide to accept the sacrifice of the 1 survivor and let everyone else go
---
I used to think DBD was a horror game but now I realize it's a comedy
---
First of all, let me remind you that this post is flaired *Shitpost*. If you don't like shitposts you always have the option to filter by different tags. 
---
Second, you're about the seventh person to make this point. No, I didn't compare two running men, I compared a meme of a very unnaturally running Joker which was a meme a while back with dead hard, an equally unnatural looking running man. All I did was point out that their libms allign rather well, which is slightly comical. The fact that you're reading this much into a shitpost is more childish than anything else here.
---
Sadly they won‚Äôt care, same as survivors who depip to go against new players. I‚Äôve run into both before and I doubt they‚Äôll stop.
---
It would be better if protection hits were consistent.
---
Haha serves him right lol
---
Now your not going to spawn together
---
Inner Strength is a better Self Care 8)
---
Haha I did the exact same thing! It sucks that it‚Äôs a little blurry.
---
The way you punish camping killers is by working on generators. Yes, the person on the hook will most likely die, but at least you make the killer lose the game.
---
Nothing worse than being hooked, camped, and seeing the auras of 3 Claudettes crouching near the hook instead of working on gens lol.
---
I mean it wouldn't change anything. People would just hit the skill check
---
on your ps4 go settings &gt; themes &gt; select theme &gt; scroll down and select custom &gt; select image &gt; system storage 
---
and then select what ever screenshot or custom photo you want :))
---
Doctor and huntress 
---
Doctor scares survivors into moving while huntress snipes them
---
They already do this
---
The thing is, people who hard camp probably don‚Äôt care about that stuff.  They usually just want to troll and make someone mad
---
Did she say something at the end?
---
Are the rest of the PTB outfits finished rendering?  There are others but they all have no lighting effects and look like garbage.
---
Well it completely stops people gen tapping it also stops people ending regression my breathing on the gen, feel like you didnt read my reasoning
---
I think spirit beads are faster
---
That‚Äôs like giving huntress crosshairs lmao. It would also be extremely distracting.
---
e x a c t l y
---
? It is a thing
---
It‚Äôs already confirmed, it‚Äôs like 100 auric cells per tier if you want to buy your way through it
---
Getting better at looping is usually the best way to survive longer in a game.
---
What perks are you using?
---
maybe you just... don't enjoy the game anymore?
---
How do I get that Theme? :o
---
its whale bait. A lot of people wont, but those who can, will. Its not that honorable but at the same time its the same concept as taxing the rich
---
I honestly don't like gimmicky add ons too much, especially since killers have enough trouble with base kits as is, they couldn't be too heavy of downsides. I get where you're coming from and the banzai and purple flower kinda for your idea but they just don't really do enough, I would love to see those get buffed since they could actually be really fun
---
Smoke a fat doobie before you play, gg EZ
---
bold of you to assume i'm fine with the other things
---
Highly reccomend bond out of all the survivor aura perks.
---
Lauries are toxic af and Kates
---
They literally downvoted everyone, I don't even think they read any of it. Just hivemind.
---
I like it but then good survivors are going to be endlessly spamming great skill checks every second?
---
Wait, that new skin is JANE? I thought it was Huntress. :O
---
Is Der Krankenschwester the doctor? that's beautiful lol
---
How would it stop gen tapping? They would just hit the skill check. If they are tapping for ruin, well idk why you wouldn't want them to tap as it takes around double the time to tap then power through the ruin.
---
I mean if the majority can't get good connection then ofc the servers need some more fixing but I am getting pretty tired of dodging lobbies as survivor bc it is 150ms to the point I dodge 25+ lobbies I just have to accept shit ping or play a different game
---
Not letting the survivors win is camping and tunneling, duh.
---
That being said, even if they all escape, you'll still be accused of camping and tunneling, so...
---
Survivors already waste time on generators by gen tapping, so you still get the slow down that's intended by Ruin. 
---
And if they take the time to touch it while in a chase, then that should be a net positive for the killer because you gain distance.
---
All you know about the Claud before the game is her skin and item, you cant possibly judge a person in the pregame lobby, you just run busted add ons as a rank 14 because youre a nonce
---
Did you report that?
---
The glowing skeleton in a space suit constantly laughing at max volume is an incognito killer?
---
When someone drops a pallet on me when I don't see them I jump every time ... XD
---
Cool art, but i wish girls were a little more feminine
---
Dcing is bad no matter who does it
---
However, in my experience, it happens a lot more with survivors.  Almost half my matches daily have a dc whether I‚Äôm playing survivor or killer ... where as I‚Äôve only had a handful of killer dcs in the past couple months 
---
But yeah, killer or survivors dcing is an issue
---
His laugh was one of the few things from the show that genuinely scared me as a kid.
---
I literally just started playing again, haven‚Äôt played in about a month that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm love rank.
---
That's originally why I wanted to farm in the first place
---
Yep, that edit is right ;)
---
Doctor is Doktor
---
Krankenschwester directly translated means kinda like "sick sister" or "sister of the sick"
---
How come?
---
Waiting to find a match and then waiting for it to fill would be unbearable
---
If the survs are gen tapping, ruin is still doing its job. Trust me.
---
If you want a better and more reliable perk go pop goes the weasel
---
And we all know what happened to F13... sigh
---
Yep, 1 goes down 3 goes up. If you think about others you wont feel that bad with camping, and a good team can even get you out to a 4 man escape. But if you DC, you're just encouraging campers
---
Youre a bit of a genius honestly i didnt think about people abusing it in that way, welp its time to pack it up boys
---
1. Well, it realy sucks if you joined the game at a later date. 
---
For example; I joined the game half a year ago. This means I would never be able to get those awesome Halloween skins from 2018. I might concider wraith to be my main killer. But I would never be to get his aweasome Halloween skin due to it only be available in 2018.
---
I sort of can agree that the event related skins should only be available during that event. But if the event returns at least give people the chance to get something cool they missed out on. Especially if they are willing to pay for it.
---
2. I think I read that the upcomming rifts would provide cosmetics or trinkets that would only be obtainable during that rift. If you miss those you don‚Äôt be able to get them at a later date.
---
Call Die Krankenschwester... Im dying (in a thick german accent)
---
Same.
---
Whispers is definitely a good perk! It's useful on all killers, but I've found that it's extremely effective on Pig and Ghostface in particular because they can ambush survivors after whisper procs.
---
Clearly your not a killer mainüò≠
---
gunning for that Phantasm Clap üò©
---
Because unless its something I can opt into, I would rather not play with people using controllers on a regular basis. The mechanical gap between a mouse and keyboard and controller is super high, even high enough to make the strongest killers mid to low tier on consoles.
---
Since dedicated servers a now a thing, 2v8 would be fucking awesome.
---
o no
---
If anything its to stop my annoying ass team mates tapping the gen beside me basically not helping me at all then pointing at me when i hit a good skillcheck like bruh
---
They could just make it a looser version of overcharge.
---
A bigger skillcheck that‚Äôs hard to miss but doesn‚Äôt progress the gen in any way

Day late, but wasn't this during that wierd ass cult of thorn shit?  Like, that whole "to live forever , kill your family" shit?

Because if so, then shame on you .  We only address at most the 1st film and, depending on how you like your conclusions, either the 2nd film, h20, 2019 Halloween or the one with Xzibit.

Just watched this episode yesterday aufter a very long hiatus. So this made me smile. üòä
---
Probably thought he had DS and was waiting it out, seeing as to how he's in the basement
---
Your teammates are doing it because they know they can‚Äôt consistently hit good skill checks and would rather gen tap and let you not get interrupted! It‚Äôs a courtesy more than anything.
---
Lol reminds me of a game I got into, got hooked nobody even attempted to come get me and I died. I messaged everyone who played asking why. Randoms didnt say anything but the killer said, they dont have to save you, thats there choice. I was like ok, I'll remember that if I play with any of you again. I also would like to mention the killer was not camping or anywhere near me. They just sat on gens, then one got chased and yeah. My friend was hooked with me in basement with me and killer got a 4k shortly after be both died.

No what you said was childish and very 1 dimensional solution to a very big issue

In the certain tiers of the Battlepass you earn Auric Cells. If you reach max tier and don‚Äôt spend any Cells you will have a total of 1000 Auric Cells just from the Battlepass
---
I was being ironic when I called you entitled......lol 
---
Freddy? What happened to Freddy because he‚Äôs like 1000x better now especially with his new buff against BT.  
---
Nurse needed a rework and guess what? Shes still the BEST killer in this game just a little easier to counter. 
---
I‚Äôm not really complaining about new nerf to medkit, I called it a nerf because that‚Äôs what it is?  I don‚Äôt want anything except for killers to stop being so fucking one sided. 
---
You‚Äôre complaining about the buffs to the new medkits which is not really that bad either. It‚Äôs not game breaking. You can heal that fast using perks already and now you don‚Äôt have to waste a perk slot on Botany to do it. 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but what am I defending? I‚Äôm showing you that killers can be ‚Äúentitled‚Äù too. Honestly it took them 3 years to give survivors points for their team mate DCing, why? Survivors lost potential points for reuniting, being altruistic and co-op points for working on a gen w/ that survivor so I don‚Äôt get your logic on that one. I simply came here to say it‚Äôs annoying when Killers want to come on here and call survivors entitled because they are upset something of theirs got nerfed. (cancer is very annoying but that‚Äôs not the word I used) I don‚Äôt think it really matters who‚Äôs DCing more, if you want this to be a balanced game you should be giving everyone points for the DC. There‚Äôs no reason to punish survivors who didn‚Äôt DC because their (random solo) teammate decided to be a rage quitter. 
---
Iri heads are trash and literally so many killers have the said the same thing. I don‚Äôt DC over it but they aren‚Äôt very fun to go against either even if you only get 1 (3 max) &amp; neither were insta heals, right? So why nerf instas but not her iri heads although I‚Äôm not sure how that was apart of this convo but I understand. I didn‚Äôt say you were a killer *main* either, I said you‚Äôre an entitled killer. (using your choice of words to be ironic)
---
They‚Äôve nerfed DS like 3 times...they just finally got it balanced enough for killers to be ok. I liked the wiggle one I thought it was pretty cool and you actually had to work for it if you weren‚Äôt obsession. (Idc about the time limit before you assume I do. I don‚Äôt even use DS though)
---
The Devs have said that they won't change it since it's meant to be hard mode rather than a good perk
---
Kill Your Friends (custom games) has been out since the game has. I get that you're "trolling" though.
---
Wdym this looks exactly the same
---
Don't be chased for 5 gens. Have you been the first one to be found? Pay attention to your chase score. Have you maximized that? Let the killer get you. He probably will not feel like camping you if there is gens to be patrolled. And once somebody unhooks you, you will be able to do gens and save others :)
---
Screw 'em. Camping isn't a viable strategy as your teammates were able to compete the gennys.  Stay frosty. X
---
no postgame chat, i'm disappointed :-(
---
Jake?
---
Oh I love this! Perhaps even having to ensure they all stay fueled until all 5 are repaired? Or heck, you could even have survivors gathering tools to repair the gens first. Take away our toolboxes and make us scavenge the environment for toolboxes and fuel etc
---
Hunk main ftw
---
In my matches they always try to dry hump my victims the moment I hook them so for me it has never failed and is the result of learning it‚Äôs he best strategy through only encountering idiot survivors.
---
Other than teabagging, the other things are just simple game mechanics.  Is it pity party week again?
---
Thanks!!
---
I thought I was amazing at the game because I started at a ‚Äúhigher rank‚Äù of 20 compared to everyone starting at 1.

I decided to try and use some Otz tricks last night and try out Trapper. The first group I got was all SWF with "Totem" in their name. The only kills that happened that game was all my traps, even the one I put down in the far corner of the map for laughs.

---
&gt; It honestly just feels like another step towards officially becoming a F2P game at this point with all the microtransactions we have so far.
---
Tbh I wouldn't mind.
---
The only way they can actually ruin the game if you can actively spend money per round to use the equivalent of busted add-ons or items.
---
It's already pretty egregious that we pay DLC on a paid game to unlock *meta* perks. I don't see the downside to opening up to a free to play market; higher playerbase never hurt round based games like DBD. As soon as it gets more polish (dedicated servers for instance) and addressed a lot of the main issues with a good business model that doesn't upset players and a strong foot going forward, this game can transition perfectly into ftp.
---
It‚Äôs been 3years I doubt it
---
OK ty ;)
---
I do have a little idea that may be worth it:
---
Tapping to stop regression I think should stay in the game because it is a fair way for survivors to stop the gen from regressing while in a chase cause that time is precious time that may waste a health state on a survivor. I know that it's happened to me where survivors do it and sorta fuck up so I think it's fine.
---
I think what you're more asking towards is something that can maybe help Huntress Lullaby but more so, Ruin. Ruin is meant to slow the game down there is no doubt about that and if it stays up it DOES slow the game down. However, a large portion of the playerbase does infact just gen tap to get around it, which in all honestly makes Ruin almost non-existent with **no potential fuck ups on hitting Ruin Skill checks, which is the main reason for the perk, those sweet normal Skill Checks that regresses generators.** 
---
Maybe on Ruin and Huntress Lullaby you do have those instant Skill Checks to stop gen tapping because it's like a normal skill check, if you let go of it you will make the generator explode. This will wholly discourage gen tapping while Ruin is up because you'd get so many skill checks it'd be honestly worth just to stay on the generator to try and complete it. This would be even stronger with Huntress Lullaby if people do want to avoid it but it takes so long to get the stacks that the totem would probably be destroyed by then.
---
In bold I have simply what the main purpose of Ruin is, to give you inherently difficult skill checks that may cause you to regress the generator. That bit is completely gone if you gen tap, so this change forces you to have to deal with Ruin. Gens are fast enough as it is without Ruin. With Ruin they're only slightly slower due to the majority of people gen tapping. This makes you actually endure and face Ruin for what it actually should be, and Huntress Lullaby to a point if it ever got the stacks.
---
I think that's the change you're more wanting over anything as skill checks when you start a gen would be just OP for the survivors if they didn't have Ruin or Lullaby.
---
Feng min
---
60s is loads of time to get healed, get chased fairly, get downed fairly then picked up fairly, in which case getting stabbed in the neck wouldn't be quite as fair.
---
Totally. If I wasn't a BP whore, I wouldn't run BBQ since I already run Whispers (and don't give it up). Whispers on a Billy is soooo OP...
---
Well I remember loads o fab times if gotten away from the killer and used self care and it was pretty good but very situational
---
I'm not talkin about survivors here
---
why is brofresco on the left and why is he chunky ???
---
Legion, Leatherface, Michael Myers, Steve, Quentin
---
So basically make ruin more of a deal in lower ranks. In red ranks they just don't give a shit about skillchecks and they just hit it most of the time. Also gen tapping will always be slower than normal repair. I know that it counters ruin (which for some instances does not) but i don't think it would work. They could make it so when you leave the gen you gotta wait _x_ second/s before you can repair again.
---
If you could have two of the same killer, Leatherface. As long as they don‚Äôt bump into each other, the double chainsaw boys would melt any chase. 
---
Oddly enough the best duo combo imo is Doctor and Legion. People in Deep Wounds can‚Äôt Mend until they Snap Out Of It. Big TR Doctor with Obedience and Calm against Double Blade Legion or Franks/Stab Wound Study means anyone in T3 is forced to find someone else to mend them or they go down because the Snap and Mend combo takes too long.

Dbd's team is actually one of the closests to it's community that i've ever seen

Yes the game has problems like some hitboxes and some bugs but it's not like they don't know this, they know and are trying to correct it

It became annoying to see the devs adding new things just for the community to complain about a minor thing

Is there a switch dbd reddit?

Also, just don‚Äôt buy the tiers then

Back at it again, I see.

New matchmaking gives you players up to 6 ranks above or below yours.
---
I appreciate the tips, the only problem is that I‚Äôve been a survivor main for the past 2 years and just recently started leveling up killers, the only killer perks I have as teachables is all of the Myers perks, BBQ, surveillance, and nurses calling. So I don‚Äôt really have the perks you listed, but I know BBQ is a really good killer perk (one of the best) and I‚Äôve heard it‚Äôs really easy to get stacks with save the best for last. I just have one question, do you know if you can see with nurses when a survivor is mending?
---
Nah I'm just memeing, I actually don't think it's so bad but I hear this elsentiment a lot from killer mains.
---
  
---
I'd rather have everyone be cool to each other post game and get flashlighted the whole game.

Oh okay never knew that.

Bruh you ever fight a 3+ man swf thats actually good?

I resent anyone who uses SC past green ranks. By that level you should know better than to rely on it.

---
Do you not need money to fix issues in a game? 
---
That $30 you used to buy this game more than likely already went back into the game. The $10 people will spend to buy Auric Cells is going into the game. This game would not exist if the people behind it didn‚Äôt and they kind of need to get paid too. They try their best to balance this game out and make it fun for all by adding new killers, reworking old ones and just working on the game in general and people want to complain because they charge money for things that aren‚Äôt even detrimental to your game play. If you don‚Äôt like it, don‚Äôt buy it but don‚Äôt try to take away other peoples choice of what they want to spend their money on. I love BHVR and this game so I‚Äôm more than willing to give them $10 because for me it‚Äôs money well spent.
---
That's nice to hear!
---
Maybe one with just no "The"?
---
I got one:
---
Moltenface.
---
High quality cosmetics? Your joking right? Lol
---
I really dislike Claudettes, as a killer I always want to kill them and never give them hatch. They're either clickety-click toxic OchiDO wannabes or immersed players hiding in the bush (which is fine I guess but super boring for the killer).
---
Ok fair, idk it just feels to me like both sides do need powerful things, bc they are fun once in a while. Insta heals are fun the same way a huntress has fun with insta hatchets. Does either side like playing against them? No, but we all just deal with it.
---
The battlepass has certain "tiers" you can increase the battlepass' tier by completing challenges. If you don't spend any money, you'll get a few low- to middle quality cosmetics. If you pay for the battlepass, you get all the free rewards and extra premium rewards. Premium cosmetics are usually mid- to high quality. The battlepass costs 1000 auric cells and if you complete all tiers, you get 1000 cells back. If you reached tier 15 and then decide to pay for the premium rewards, you'll keep your tier (so you can first grind to get all the tiers and then decide to buy the premium pass to get all the rewards)
---
I may do this when the poster for the og ghostface robes is released
---
Noob3 apologies to killers and survivors and feels bad for being toxic unless they were toxic too. OchiDo is just a complete prick with no respect at all towards people. He‚Äôll say gg ez baby killer. Noob3 is toxic in a fun way. Ochido is toxic in a sad way. He intentionally bullies people for his own amusement which is just sad.
---
I don't know if it is or not, really. I just saw this as a good area to share that info instead of some post.
---
Oh I assure you some people were shitting up and down when they announced the Cosmetic store. 
---
I also guarantee that the number of people who are upset about the battlepass are barely a drop in the bucket of the playerbase.
---
You should
---
And by ban I mean like any other game. 1dc? 5min, 2 DC 10min and so on till at a Max of 30min per match for 2/3 matches.
---
Yes I'm saying 30min wait before joining the que after like 5/6 DC . Every other online PVP game do this, why DbD shouldn't?
---
If u took forever to find and hook a survivor nothing is viable strategy
---
this guy in the video if he didnt camped he would got 0 kills
---
I was waiting on a scream
---
I'd really recommend bond instead - you can use it to find teammates to heal you, but it has so much more use. You can see when someone goes for the save, you can see if someone is bringing the killer over, you can see where your team are when you're being chased, or do a gen with other people - it's super useful
---
They nerfed the base healing speed, and indirect nerf by buffing Sloppy Butcher
---
No I agree it's difficult to balance around that part of the game and I don't personally have a good answer on how to do it, I'm just offering up a partial solution to make the game less stressful later in rank.
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the post game message after the rank 4 dies.
---
‚ÄúYou have stolen my dreams and my childhood.  HOW DARE YOU.‚Äù  üò°
---
8k for each category, but having a killer be afk makes it impossible to max out the survival and altruism categories, since you get those points by escaping and self healing (among other things) and helping/unhooking team mates. So it's actually impossible to get the max 32k points when a killer is afk.
---
The ultimate Hooker.
---
Instadown killers will just m1 you
---
I mean who wouldn't dc against a prayer beads spirit.
---
Most people who use it know the exploit was fixed, they just like to spam the attack because it‚Äôs fun. If people really wanted that speed boost they would just use agitation.
---
Have you checked out the PTB performances? If this is what more macro-transaction monetization brings, then they definitely need to REDUCE it.
---
Sure you get your money back if you spend like 2-3 hours a day playing games, or play 8 matches a day (some guy here did the math). That's a fuckton of games.
---
Your so edgy and cool bc u dress up as a hoodies masked edge lord killer wow do you want my finger as an thank you for being so brave to post this amazing never seen before edgy cosplay on this sub?

Was very fast ques for both sides when the ranking system wasn't working, you were looking at 5-10 mins max.
---
At the moment with it fixed i'm sat at rank 7 survivor and waiting 15-20 mins a que, not fun at all, hoping it's just lack of players in mid rank. 
---
At the same time though I've been giving up and playing other games myself so it may even be a case of more players doing this... Had times where I've played the same killer 3 times in a row too...
---
Would love to know the actual number of players, I don't see it being that large considering I've played with the same people several times already.

One Hillbilly with BBQ. One Doctor with Iron Maiden.
---
It happens on xbox too, killers have messaged me after and said they did it on purpose.  Instead of quitting in game they pull the plug on there system and it crashes all players and wipes blood points and everything else.
---
Red ranks is full of self care even in SWFs sometimes, I'm convinced there are a ton of people who picked up the game playing it and can't bring themselves to replace it
---
Yeah, lag switching is also easy on PC. You said hacking. So that implies things like speed hacks/ wall hacks etc, which frankly I've not heard of on console. So let's be real, hacking isn't "easier" on console. You're just talking about lag switching.   
---
And most scumbags who hack seriously on PC buy the EAC bypass to hack to avoid detection for at least a while, or just get a new account. I've ran into killers who have teleported me and my friends at will inside the exit gate and have full control over the positioning of survivors. I'm pretty sure you can't hack like that on console.

I‚Äôm not exactly sure what you mean by PTB performances? Elaborate.

How dare BHVR not give everyone every strong perk in the game!!???  I personally dislike BUBBA, SO WHY DO I NOT JUST GET BBQ FOR FREE!!

Audio is fucking broken again. Mist is fucked up. Apparently, having high FPS causes rubber-banding and lag..

That‚Äôs one ultra rare add on, I personally wouldn‚Äôt take those into account when talking about tier lists.

Cant get the unlockable perk unless you have that character and grind it out at levels 35 40 and 45 i believe or shrine.
---
Bill, because licensed characters are getting more skins now.
---
you're acting like 16 seconds is nothing when in an unhooking situation against a camping killer.
---
22th?
---
The Killer had the perk called ‚ÄúBlood Warden,‚Äù the perk makes it so when you hook a survivor after at least one exit gate has been opened, it blocks both gates for 1 minute, making it so the survivors are unable to leave. In this video, The Killer had activated Blood Warden when there was less than a minute left on the end-game collapse timer, so Blood Warden stayed active for the rest of the collapse timer. Blood Warden kept the survivors locked in the game, and the end-game collapse sacrificed all 4 survivors.
---
Killers have a bigger problem, since it takes 20 minutes to find a match, so that the survs, who find matches in less than 2 minutes, DC and you have to go through everything again...
---
You realise pure stress, anxiety, fear and mental instability could turn the most kindest people into sociopaths?
---
No the robe is different in the movie because you don‚Äôt use a $30 off-the-rack Halloween costume in a movie that costs millions of dollars. The actual Halloween costume would probably be translucent under the film‚Äôs lighting so they used much heavier material. Making it heavier also makes material move more slowly and dramatically. A material with shiny/sparkly light threads among the black was used to photograph better too. They did the similar things with the masks. 
---
That said: it‚Äôs meant to be the Fun World costume. The characters in the movie didn‚Äôt spend tens of thousands of dollars on a hero Hollywood costume designer Fun World costume, they all bought theirs off the rack.
---
Yea but here is the problem. Insta down hatchets still takes skill to aim insta heals take 0 skill to use and just requires a button press. Also insta down hatchets are only something ofc huntress can use while insta heals can used by anyone on the survivor side.
---
The games where survivors already are optimal af make it hard and I think that is fun as a killer not to have a chase go on for too long and I finally will be able to do a play but nah insta heal and now I have to give up and give up that play that could have bought me a ticket back into the game. Just generally speaking insta heals hurts everyone
---
Wow I didn‚Äôt know you couldn‚Äôt get them because you weren‚Äôt here at the time.
---
Also about the rift they said that they‚Äôll release the rift skins at least 6 months of the rift closing.
---
Hearing the Halloween theme over the top while ghostfaces exposed stalks chime off would be like some surreal dbd MLG parody video
---
I know. It's why I started running DS after getting tunneled 5 games in a row.
---
Then again, it takes one of your teammates to get tunneled.
---
Nurse is joining Huntress's harem. Billy's gonna play the ding dong with his chainsaw.
---
They could add a Mario party style minigame mode and there would still be salty comments in chat after the game
---
Bond is for sure the better perk. Also, IRON WILL. 
---
A lot of people don‚Äôt realize you can actually do gens, unhook people, get chased while injured. YOU DON‚ÄôT NEED TO BE HEALED ALL THE TIME
---
But playing 2v8 with a rando killer teammate and it's a baby nurse.
---
it's not difficult to have survivors asleep as Freddy. It literally isn't even equated to hook diving, just literally any form of proxy camping can be done by Freddy and it can't be countered outside of "just don't get hit" which anyone with a brain knows is impossible when said killer is anywhere near the hook.
---
Fair enough.

Glad you agree! We need more of this sentiment which is why I always try to remain chill and just thank everyone after games.

I have the same problem but without the nat type thing. Have you checked what nat type you have?

What do you mean? Why would a teammate not heal you unless you should finish the gen first

Maybe something like an April fools event, with special gamemode, for gathering cosmetics

---
yes, you can. If you joined the game, it's because you want to play it, not because you want to play only the way you want, and DC because the game is not working out for you...
---
Since you haven't seen anyone complain yet, I'll be your first: battlepass is psychological manipulation and I think thats a little disgusting.
---
I hope this experience extended your view as you now have prove that there are indeed battlepass haters out there
---
I hate prayer beads, I think they are very op because there is virtually no way to counter it (ok spine chill but that really doesn‚Äôt tell you where she is only that she is within 40m) and as much as I would LUV to dc I don‚Äôt because it‚Äôs just as shitty. You can play however you want but people will be salty about it. I don‚Äôt blame you for using what‚Äôs available to you though, you had to spend your BP on it so just use it while you can. (But it‚Äôs cheap)

Speaking of cheap and I just have to tell someone this because I had never seen it before, if someone opens the hatch with a key while gens still need to be completed and you close it before everyone can jump in the fucking exit gates become powered regardless of how many are left.
---
I love the new costume but I really hate that there's glowing yellow shit on it like the Claudette one. I don't want the killer seeing me from across the map like I'm carrying around a bunch of fireflies
---
He can do everything that doesn‚Äôt involve attacking survivors or using his weapon
---
With my commute, I am away from home working 11.30-12.30 hours every workday.
---
At least Apex is f2p, DbD it's not.
---
In the premium battlepass, you not only get better and more cosmetics, but you also get awarded auric cells, 1000 in total, which is the cost for the battlepass
---
I don‚Äôt disagree. You got my upvotes.
---
dont let the killer see that you are broken they might actually slug you that way
---
And that is why I hate this community...
---
Oh God please no, I don't want console peasants in my Master Race Realm.
---
Joking aside, console VS console is totally ok but I think it's better to leave PC alone for the totally different controls they have.
---
Bbq was in the shrine 2 times past year but still agree... why do we have to pay for a battle pass when we already paid for the game...
---
Enjoy these moments while you can.  You won‚Äôt be able to do that next patch

I mean he does have 8k hours in the game so he is bound to be good.

It increases in chase, which is good.  It‚Äôs scares the other survivors you‚Äôre not chasing.
---
If you use it with the distressing perk (and doctor add-ons) your terror radius can be huge.

It's always national "killers are the real victims" day

the trap place is important and its hard to learn

---
There‚Äôs many games that have more violent scenes for countries then Asian countries they‚Äôll have it so it‚Äôs not as violent

Okay I fucking love the idea of HUNK but holy shit he'd kill every single killer in the fog and then probably the Entity itself

"Toxic in a fun way"
---
Alright I'm gonna need you to define what you mean by toxic becuase by my definition that statement is a contradiction.
---
If you act like a dick, and then say "sorry I was a dick lolz gg tho dude" you were still a dick. The apology means nothing. If you really feel bad about being a dick, then you would make an effort to not be a dick. Rather than just continuing said dickery but just 'apologize' every time and it's all cool then right?
---
But tunneling also not quite complicated game mechanic.
---

---
Imagine 2 vs 8 with old Legion. You could chain together frenzy attacks on the same person and down them so quickly.
---
Controls barely matter. If Fortnite can do it, I'm sure DbD will be fine. If people want to play with their friends on PC servers, let em.
---
*laughs in identityV*
---
Wow, you are bizarre.
---
***give this fucker more ice cream or so help me god you will all cease to exsist***
---
If the charms are shit and the skins bad, then this literally doesn't affect you in any way whatsoever. Just don't buy the fucking thing. Genius.
---
Also I recommend checking out this streamer 'Mulder'. He streams mainly dead by daylight and you can ask him nicely in chat to explain which perks are the best. He is very experienced killer. He is Russian but his English is mediocre
---
Because 90% of this sub is survivors complaining about losing and saying that it‚Äôs the killers responsibility to let them have fun.
---
Maybe it should show every killer offering (except blood party) as an secret, that way it would be always scary
---

Huntress Lullaby, which is in the Shrine Now even on PS4 and Xbox when Huntress is a PC exclusive.
---
You'd be surprised. I've almost been Game Overed from a RBT a few times. But I'm pretty sure it does. I know blindness doesn't affect jigsaw box auras, though.
---
where did you people find these photos
---
It is funny! as a meme its spot on.
---
And I agree, it feels like killers get more shit a bit more (it is 4 against 1 in the end).
---
how many things do you need to stop tunnelers? You have decisive strike already
---
SPIRIT MAINS RISE!
---
With friends, sure but in case I hope it will be a KYF feature only...
---
Well, if you still have any of Bill's perks before he was added to console, you keep them.
---
And so far no problem for me! actually better games as both
---
Bloody Hair Brooch and Mother-Daughter Ring, by far.
---
Beads are spooky, Ring is lethal.
---
had a true brainfart moment a few days ago where I crouched in but *ran away*. Not my proudest moment, especially since the poor guy I unhooked was caught again....didn't even stay for post-game lobby out of shame lmao.
---
That‚Äôs reasonable.  You potentially have 2-3 hours of free time everyday.  M-F?
---
With commute I‚Äôm away from home 13.5-14.5 hours a day, 6 days a week.
---
You're actually quieter when you have no mither, believe it or not.
---
I'm a low-rank Killer (rank 18 gang) and main Huntress.
---
If I'm still only a couple metres away from a hook, plodding my slow-ass Roger Rabbit legs away to a gen, and you ALREADY go for the hook save right in my face you're damn right I'm whipping right back around and taking the free hit on an already-injured survivor. I'm sorry man, but your teammates seem to want to farm you and I feel obligated as Killer to make use of that for free map pressure.
---
It could work. Dont know how the community would feel about a mechanical killer though
---
I recommend playing with no mither, why?
---
Because if you have in mind that you can get downed in 1 hit, you learn how to loop better and how to escape better, i use it because i have 600 hours at the game and i like challenges, and people say that no mither is a bad perk but i think that its pretty underrated
---
Iri heads shouldn‚Äôt be in the game and they will be removed in the near future already confirmed by McLean. Also you deranking for that means you didn‚Äôt win at all.
---
I get accused if one person lags.
---
If a killer has the balls to run Iron Maiden, then a joke i'll happily accept
---
Appreciate it!
---
I'd rather be laughing about the situation than complain about it.
---
Very likely so, but it does seem most streamers play Killer and their chat even has more sentiment for them so I think it totally depends on the frame of reference.
---
Man that‚Äôs the best part lol
---
***Oh lord help me for what imma bout to do...***
---
Wait is that custom or actually available on the ps store because I would love that them
---
So one killer can counter one add on? Oh god guys it needs to be reworked!
---
*^^pyro ^^will ^^tear ^^you ^^to ^^toast*
---
Self-care is a self-imposed time out. Bond is superior to self-care. If you get injured you can easily find a team mate to heal you in a fraction of the time self-care would take. 99% of survivors will heal you immediately because they want altruism points. You gain information on where the killer is and what your team is working on. If you are solo surviving Bond out performs self-care any day.
---
Stick your bloody P3 knife deep into me
---
This would be awesome. I love it.
---
Hehe, I've run it as a joke before, but I definitely agree
---
Yep! It's 100% safe to change these files specifically. EAC (their anti-hack/cheat system doesn't care about or look at these image files so there is no danger here :)  
---
As additional anecdotal evidence, think about it this way -- making this theme I spend about 11 hours replacing image files \~450 times per hour without a ban haha
---
Probably similar to Michael, which if done I hope it wouldn‚Äôt be to identical where you have a feeling of bubba and hillbilly, should still be unique enough where they‚Äôre their own killer
---
Kowabunga it is!
---
Demogorange
---
No stealth killer in general pigs stealth, ghostface stealth. Other stealth killets
---
Uh oh. An opinion that disagrees with the majority of the public! Prepare for downvotes
---
its not a perk, its the oblivious status icon
---
I feel like the only reason people hate the battlepass is "fortnite bad lol". I get people don't like the idea of paying to grind, but there's a free variant too yaknow. On top of that even with the premium one you can earn your auric cells back if you go through the thing, so i see pretty much no reason to dislike it.
---
And of course Dwight would die first
---
It‚Äôs so NSFW that it‚Äôs worse than standing on an office chair
---
Ask your friend to a custom game and then face camp him.
---
For me that's killer dependent somewhat. If I'm against plague or legion yeah I'll stay injured all game. Even basic M1 killers like wraith or doctor, I'm not worried. But if you put me against a stealth killer, or a spirit/nurse (huntress if shes a beast) and my first priority is gonna be heal. Those killers are great at using their ability to get a free first hit and If you're injured, that's the only hit. That's why I usually bring bond. Even if I am not using it for healing it gives me good info literally 100% of the match.
---
You're no help to your team if you go down instantly with no chase.
---
Apparently his picture isn‚Äôt on the Tier website
---
I mean, I wouldn‚Äôt run it unless it gets a slight buff (like not starting injured). But I sometimes run it in some fun builds and it isn‚Äôt bad. Normally I just run Iron Will + Dead Hard + Adrenaline so I‚Äôm safe in most cases. If I find a teamlate I‚Äôll let them heal me, but that depends on the killer as well + how many gens are left
---
That doesn't mean that's not what he was thinking.
---
I know i'm gonna get downvotes, noobs in this sub still can't deal with tunnelers
---
I usually let survivors go, but this one russian dick started spamming "EZ" after I clearly let them go and it makes me question if I wanna be merciful
---
Why? It's literally optional, Why are you so against having console players play on PC servers?
---
Plenty of people already play with controllers on PC.
---
This is the sad part and why monetization likes this is not honorable. But this practice is widespread, being one of the leeways between monetization and content. Among those who practice it BHVR is far from the worst
---
You‚Äôre doing it right imo.
---
Get that BBQ ASAP.  You earn BP twice as fast.
---
I think the list is accurate except for some, even though I'm a not toxic Nea main.
---
Haha yeah! I like that^^
---
Oh hm, didnt think of that! Interesting thought aswell!
---
How and why would a pig crouch and follow you around until you go down instead of just hitting you?
---
From what I've read your build already seems to be pretty good but I'm no expert
---
As long as if they decide to alphabetize their killer order they don't put "The Ghost Face" and others under the Ts, like blizzard did with HOTS and "The Butcher"
---
Just know that i upvoted you. Rest In Peace amigo
---
I personally like save the best for last but it‚Äôs up too you
---
Seriously! Even EA doesn't do this kind of crap! I can imagine them going "I thought we were bad! This is immoral even by our standards!" You know what? I'm gonna go apologize to them.
---
No it‚Äôs definitely a nerf. You actually have to earn the benefits you get from it, unlike before and unlike NOED. Also, ultra rare items are meant to be way stronger than normal perks.
---
bbq before ruin?
---
You guys really should read before downvoting or replying. I said you would get accused, not you actually were lagswitching
---
There‚Äôs no evidence for this though and I highly doubt the next chapter will be licensed it will be original content
---
pop instead of nurse, people barely heal against legion and if your nurse works they'll run away cause your terror radius. Pop has so much value
---
Of course, I agree. Some killers just require healing but staying injured isn‚Äôt as bad as it seems. If you‚Äôre constantly doing gens and so is you‚Äôre team, 1 fast down shouldn‚Äôt even be a problem. That being said, I know how to position myself to get a chase going safely so I won‚Äôt go down instantly.
---
I am honestly very excited for the archives. They are lacking in the lore department and I'm glad they're deciding to address it. 
---
Huntress in your style would look incredible. I'm looking forward to it!
---
Looks like he couldn‚Äôt handle the Neutron style
---
Why?
---
I once accidentally hit the crouch button while panicking during a chase and this killer made it their life mission to tunnel and camp me
---
Give or take, yeah. 
---
Well, that sucks.
---
Is that a motherfucking JoJo reference???
---
Or if you want to be mean, increase feral frenzy duration, then bring the add on that increases your terror radius to the entire map. Then bring colrophpbia, sloppy butcher, thanataphobia, nurse calling
---
[deleted]
---
What about the Fortnite dance?
---
So once Ruin is gone, you are basically perkless? People often don't heal against Legion. You have 2 perks that affect healing and thanatophobia doesn't really do anything. 
---
My Legion build is BBQ + Discordance + Enduring + Spirit Fury. 
---
Discordance helps me finding multiple survivors so I can get multiple people injured while Enduring + SF helps with ending chases ASAP. 
---
BBQ for points and occasional information when they don't hide in lockers.
---
yes
---
Interesting!
---
I‚Äôm not too big on it (more of a fan of her chinese gown or the blue hair/mask style outfits) but I‚Äôll probably buy and use it anyway lol
---
Can't say I always succeed but atleast during streams or after games I try to stay positive because the community sure as hell can use it (‚Ä¢‚Äø‚Ä¢)
---
It's not optional anymore if you force it in public matches. Consoles and PC controls are mechanically different, very different and as a solo player I would rather not have console SWF groups with me in my matches. Controllers are clumsy and not as effective as a mouse/keyboard setting in a match like DBD.
---
Its faster to wait out the timer, waste time at loops.
---
Someone gift me the new skin .... :(
---
It‚Äôs not on store it‚Äôs a custom :)
---
So they mend at a loop
---
Even the YOU TRULY ANGERED ME meme was aight here
---
Oh, how did you do it then?
---
all it takes is 1 insta heal to make a killer lose all pressure. Just like how missing 1 swing gives a survivor another time to loop around a loop. ofc this all depends on what killer is playing and how that killer deals with the situation. Like most games you have to balance it around the rly good players and a rly good player knows when to make a killer lose momentum and pop that insta heal.
---
Even though it's new, I feel like Demogorgon should have more. I'd like to see some kind of blighted version next year maybe
---
Can you read?
---
I'm sorry I confused you there little girl.
---
What happened before this?
---
Or you can equip Decisive strike like 90% of the people do
---
soooo you want me to have a stroke at the gate?
---
And his father was killed by Legion, and that is why he returned back to Ormond
---
They should‚Äôve made them steampunk goggles
---
Take it with a grain of salt, though. The effort in man-seconds spent with 1 person healing themself at 50% speed is the same as 2 people healing at regular speed.
---
That time someone is spending healing you is time they are not spending on a gen.
---
But while they mend you attack = a down. 
---
You don't have to wait the timer completely just enough to force the survivor to stop and mend to hit them.
---
Myers save the best for last and play with your food are both amazing perks and I highly recommend using one of them.  PWYF speedboost will let you more aggressively stalk, combos well with tombstone's and in Evil Within 3 downs a healthy survivor for only 1 stack. STBFL is a bit more iffy on him as faster hit recovery is less important in Evil3,  but its a solid choice if you tend to struggle with stalking.
---
Monitor and abuse (doctor perk) or dead rabbit is a big helps as well.  Myers has a 6/16/32 meter terror radius in evil within 1/2/3.  M&amp;A makes this 0/8/24 for easier sneaking in all tiers while dead rabbit does the same except in tier 3, which has a 48m terror range and has more synergy with perks like infectious fright.
---
Hex Ruin (hag perk) and/or pop goes the weasel (clown perk) are pretty much musts unless you want gens to fly.
---
As for play styles, you need to get used to his lunge ranges, as EW1 has almost none, EW2 is normal, and EW3 lets you make many pallets non-safe ones.  Getting Evil Within 2 to 99% and later in a chase popping it right before the hit is an important skill as well.  And you need to decide if you want to EW3 down a survivor quickly to hook and hunt another survivor (with something like bbq or Infectious fright), or down a survivor with EW2 then hook and patrol so you can EW3 on the rescuers when they rush in.
---
The most important thing to know is myers sucks at pipping if you use Evil Within 3.  Skillful use of it can limit you to bronze malicious, and you will need to 'play' with the survivors more for a good chaser score.  Its just something you have to get used to.  And using tombstones will ruin your sacrifice score too.
---
ENK! Huntress isn't PC only, Console people get it too.
---
I think I just realized a big reason I suck so much as Wraith
---
I honestly don't understand why people DC against this? Or any killer tbh. You never know how the game is going to go. I play both survivor and killer and have been able to escape against a one hit huntress. They are just hatchets. Like normal. Dodge them like normal and loop like normal. Eventually you will lose just like normal. And someone will save you from the hook. Like normal. Even if the game is short and you all die, at least do what you can to get bloodpoints?
---
On the other hand. Same with killers. Don't DC if you think you are about to "lose" Just do what you can to get bloodpoints. 
---
Killer or survivor. You won't become a better player by DCing all the time.
---
Just watch noob3 and ochido and you‚Äôll get where I‚Äôm coming from. Don‚Äôt try arguing with me. It gets you nowhere. I stand still on my statement.
---
Isnt getting downed part of them game?
---
exactly
---
Next chapter is to have no map according to the roadmap. So it doesn't make sense for it to be a original killer more likely a licensed killer like ghostface.
---
So they mend a pallet. This is very simple
---
The nurse has been broken in the hands of anyone with a normal IQ since day 1. Anyone complaining about her "nerf" are delusional.
---
&gt;Or you can equip Decisive strike like 90% of the people do
---
I already do. But DS is easy to counter and so is Endurance. Now, survivors don't really have much tools to counter camping and tunneling.
---
If it glows, it goes
---
Nurses and sloppy aren‚Äôt as good on Legion in my opinion. Most survivors don‚Äôt heal too much against Legion so an anti heal build loses it‚Äôs merits. I‚Äôd use bbq and maybe save the best for last instead.
---
It would make jake look more like a marauder
---
They want you to tunnel them, act like they don't exist and only smack them if they getting in ur way but if they are clicking their flashlight at you just act like ur deaf. Just remember to look at a wall when picking survivors up
---
The night *he* came
---
To be fair
---
I like thana as you can injure people easily with legion, but yeah I may take off sloppy and and a nurses calling
---
Noice cuphead style
---
It has not come out yet and if you are able to play for 45 minutes to an hour every day you should be good
---
Ashy slashy hill(y)billy
---
Some other tips for you:
---
Standing still makes you completely invisible (no shimmer)
---
Bodyblocking pallets or pinning survivors in walls while invisible is massively helpful.
---
That would be three licenced DLC in a row though. Not a bad thing, just seems off to me.
---
DBD when they introduce a subscription business model for their paid game****
---
It is a cash grab, if you can't see that you are massively naive. And if you say 'but it has free stuff' 'you don't have to get it', this just proves your naivety. It isn't about the cost, it is about making regular players pay a subscription to get everything out of the game.
---
Fucking gullible idiots..
---
For whatever reason, Laurie tends to be the most toxic survivor for me.
---
play with your food is quite the advance perk i dont recommend it get survilance its better for newer player or get discordance its in the shrine right now for 2000 irdcent shards
---
It‚Äôs up to you.
---
There is not gamepass, at least in ps4
---
It‚Äôs kinda does.  It feels like I‚Äôm serving a sentence lol.  I was hitting 80-82 hours last December...But I payed off the last 25k of school debt last year and will be paying off my new Camry SE this year...hopefully it lasts a long time (and 38-40 MPG on my drive home!).

&gt; Consoles and PC controls are mechanically different, very different and as a solo player I would rather not have console SWF groups with me in my matches. 
---
You know the PC version of this game already supports controllers right?
---
You know many PC players, also use controllers right?
---
You're being over dramatic, this game isn't some top tier esport, If people want to have fun and play with friends, let them.
---
&gt;How is the battle pass meaningful progression?
---
Wtf are you talking about. it is the only meaningful progression put in the game apart from bloodwebs and rituals. Fucking casuals, everywhere.
---
You got hit by that pallet so hard your leg must have gotten stuck in the floorboards
---
I'm a simple man, I see 1.5k points I cleanse.
---
It comes down to people don't like other people being complete cunts to them. Camping them is dumb but you can't blame someone for not liking being taunted
---
You are right dude. Battle pass subscriptions are a game killing poison.
---
Idk if you would be that bad with swf, you literally have to die which decreases team efficiency by 25%. The only times I can really think about this being annoying is if you slug all 4 at less then 2 gens.
---
ok sure game mechanics but when you get DSed AND Head on for a EIGHT SECOND STUN and then try to get one hook just to fucking get body blocked into oblivion and feel like mad grit is the only way out its kinda annoying when the survivors come back and say "lol git gud" or "camper" (even though you hung around the hook for 3 seconds to make sure there wasn't an immediate rescue).
---
Well I saw that it's legion in the pic and I've been contemplating on buying him so I thought I'd ask.
---
it fits him perfectly, a screaming bitch who isnt scxary at all and play dirty because i fuckign hateb dbyavn bubab sucks and he is the worst killer in the game and in the  o ie he duskc too, so thats why he fits perceclt, no like the huntress whos thicc af and she is hot and thic and she is good with stuff but bubba is so fat and slow and is 1155% and wtf if he is fat af, im faster than him in real life what the fuck are this devs aid
---
Ok chad
---
Your not a making a decision I asked if the battlepass if our yet on PS4 and with around 6 to 10 hours of playtime a week is enough.
---
Throw it, throw it hard
---
Probably would've just been two nurses
---
I always feel bad when I get matched with red ranks
---
You can already family share your library to a smurf on steam for free and get a fresh account in 1m. PS4 and XBOX games are shared between accounts so you can do the same there, too. Literally nothing would change.
---
And didn't I just read that the Shaggy voice actor was salty for being excluded from the latest Scooby stuff coming out? He would probably be on board for doing the VA stuff I bet.
---
UwU indeed
---
Survivors don't have much tools at all now pal. Meanwhile killers get super powerful addons, moris. Seemingly million ways to 1 hit down you. Hell the game even gives them a free kill if they tunnel you for the duration of the end game timer and can't catch you.
---
I expected welder's style blackout goggles and big black leather gloves that go up to the elbow! What I got was lenseless hipster glasses!
---
It's funny, reading this thread you see a lot of sentiment going either way. And I agree with both and would just hope people would come together and just be nicer to each other.
---
Well I guess what I‚Äôm trying to say is that as you get higher up in rank (I‚Äôm rank 1 every reset dispite activity trying not to), you‚Äôre games will get a whole lot more sweaty, and it‚Äôll be harder to have fun doing anything casual.
---
Whispers 2 on Pig is great. It activated and then you crouch, it saves time and you always know what gens they will be on
---
Yep as a killer im fine with survivors being safe. But damn its obnoxious how they abuse it. I had a steve and David  with ds and they were running to my face blocking hits cause they know i cant pick them up. They all died with how stupid they were using it but damn was it sad to see.
---
I play ghostface to give the spooks and feel so sad when i see them just taunting when i pop up.

Then let those language have the stupidity of "The Ghost Face" and let us who actually have two different words for something get "The Ghost"

Like I am not saying insta down hatchets are fairer they aren't it takes semi-good aim to hit hatchets but if you look away from the fact you can just slap on the belt addon and get 3 hatchets trading 3 hatchets for 1 insta down is a massive trade depending on the map and what does the survivor trade? less effective medkit. 
---
but yes bc u can just slap on the belt the insta down hatchets barely gets a trade-off they are in the same ballpark of unfairness and there are many addons like this but as BVHR proved with nurse they are willing to change stuff so who knows what is to come in the future.
---
 insta heals especially the red one will still be good. It will just require a survivor to think about their options more and it provides some counterplay for killers.
---
yeah i know what you mean, the main focus for me is to become better, because i know i enjoy using myers and for me now all i wanna do is keep progressing my skill on him
---
&gt; Also if pc players are playing with controllers they are just handicapping themselves
---
I mean no, someone whos played on a console for 10 years trying to use WASD would certainly be a huge handicap for them.
---
Console players competed in fortnite with controllers at the highest level, not sure why you think DbD is harder...
---
Switzerland likes this.

But kind of fucking hates the fact the fact that the Demogorgon is going to be nerfed into oblivion because the entire population of P3 Claudette mains is going to complain like theres no tomorrow.

I love the new Laurie skin. The only thing that i want more than that is a Quientin skin. I can then die happy
---
Eh, u think teabagging is not the worst of it.
---
Most killers get frustrated when they get double stunned (DS + head-on) and then finally get maybe 1 kill if even.
---
After the game they then get the typical: gg ez nice tunnel
---
I get it, but I also think both sides are at fault and we should all just be nicer to each other.
---
It's a status effect called oblivious. Survivors affected by it won't hear the terror radius, and won't be considered to be in it for perk effects. So while infectious fright won't do anything against an oblivious survivor, for example, stake out (better than it sounds, as it semi-counters ruin), Diversion, and Borrowed time won't proc, since the unhooker has to be in the terror radius, and because they're oblivious, they're not, even if technically, they are. You know what I mean?

As much as I agree, I find iridescent head boring, it just makes the match hollow (same with prayer beads, and instadown clown (idk name, I don't play clown much))

I like how they gasp of her raising her Hatchet in this context is more like a "WTF NO" gasp.

Legit just things in the game and most arent even that annoying, but okay
---
Is that never coming at all? It looked like it would have been a popular cosmetic
---
If I rescue the dumbass in the hook he sprints away.
---
If I get rescued, the dumbass either comes running full speed at the hook and gets grabbed before he can unhook or EVEN stupider, he croutches to me to unhook then walks without crouching bringging the damn hag back to sack us both.
---
EVERY. FUCKING. TIME.
---
Is like she is a new killer, dont you MF know how to play her?
---
I supa loopa double loop ya, you assumin im a human
---
What i gotta say to get it through to you im super human
---
Im more than ever always stating, killers are op and complaining
---
Takes two to tunnel. Namely the teammate that unhooked you when the killer was near.
---
But I agree it's not that hard to go for the other one instead.
---
this isnt my point tho ik not all killers are red rank material, im a red rank killer. I‚Äôm more so saying why ONLY spirit? even if theres only 3 killers who are red rank material id take a mix of those 3 rather then spirit every single game.
---
Run whispers 3 and M&amp;A, its so much more precise and you still sneak up on survivors. Also, with the new undetectable buff to Pig, we may no longer have to run M&amp;A which im super pumped for.
---
*Cries in Quentin main*

Well instead of 100 cells it's better to see it as 1$.

I don't let claudattes get hatch since I never know if the claudatte was an undercover toxic claudatte and I'm helping one live
---
Give me young Army of Darkness Ash from the beginning and I‚Äôll actually buy the character
---
Ok. Thank you.
---
Self-care takes 1person 32 seconds of manpower. Being healed by someone else takes you both 16 seconds = 32 seconds of manpower.
---
what an amazing cutle little drawing
---
I hate DC's as much as the next person but can you really blame a someone for dcing against certained builds? If the killer isn't braindead then it almost guarantees an early 4k and I get that some people would rather just surrender.
---
Everything ok at home man? Parents treating you right?
---
The only problem of whisper 3 without M&amp;A is the radius of whisper and her terror radius are equal, so they will still hear a heartbeat for a second.
---
Dammmn now Im thinking how would she look like in a snowy enviroment in her winter clothes looking for something to hunt without her mask.. *sigh
---
I am hoping they will not dissapoint us with all the archive lore hype xD
---
Such a well made meme! The "Survivors" all look so good lmao.
---
Yeah, I agree. I'm making a joke and am hoping to spark some debate on being nicer to each other.
---
A lot of killers feel that tunneling is also just a legit strategy to quickly kill the survivors and "win".
---
Stage 5 Clinger.
---
Trapper looks so over it.  At the end he just wanted to get rid of Tapp.
---
That's the funniest thing i've read today
---
can i get some more please
---
&gt;I never understand why people will DC against this. Yeah, it's not fun to play against. But you still may as well try. You don't know how the rest of the game will play out.
---
This is always my philosophy. Personally, I never DC unless there's a bug in the game that makes it unplayable (i.e. someone gets stuck in a wall). And you know what? Sometimes, sticking around has its perks. I've gotten extremely lucky and escaped on my own, or had the killer give me the hatch a few times. DCing would mean losing all of my bloodpoints, and 4-5k is better than nothing.
---
Sure, sometimes the opposing side isn't fun to play against, or is being really toxic, but DCing ruins the game for the other players. I'd rather make an effort than fuck everyone else over, but that's just me.
---
Im stupid for saying you can't know? Wow, im so stupid for saying a perfectly correct information about the way the game works
---
double map size
---
This looks really good! It's also a nice change from the constant neon/retro/sci-fi icon packs flooding out.
---
what the swf didnt mention in their story is that they had 2 purple odd bulb flashlights and 2 engineer tool boxes ready to make the killer wish they never played this game.
---
A small price to pay for salvation
---
When I started playing I had a wooden PC that couldn't even hold 15 frames for long and that's when I learned how to land greats 90% of the time.
---
The needle is just a visualisation. Estimate the speed, adjust for input delay and you'll be fine
---
... so let's ignore the benefits and just focus on the downsides..
---
I know it's hard to be stuck at rank 15 but do bones. It's a perk, an hex, which means can be DENIED entirely, something that never happens to survivors
---
Plus, it's a tweak not a Nerf if it's just second wind with extra steps and you heal allies faster.. I guess you're just pissed you can't do bones and can't use heals in front of the killer and he can t do anything about it huh
---
God damn it the entitlement..
---
Actual toxic SWF in video: flashlights him twice and plays semi-coordinated.
---
You deserve to be decisive striked if you tunnel.
---
Some of them will partially decloak him, however. Destroying pallets and damaging generators are two of those things, and if wraith finds a survivor in a locker while cloaked, he'll decloak automatically.
---
You have to make the conscious decision to die! I like it
---
He's definitely not unplayable
---
lol i still kill for the juicy 4k.
---
That being said, don't let the survivor hit you with the pallet, or you'll be stunned for a longer period, and be forcibly decloaked. Lightburn also exists too, and is separate from a blind, (so lightborn won't help there) so be very careful with flashlight users.
---
That‚Äôs a major yikes
---
Not when the gens are done or in a situation where 1 is slugged by the hatch and the other who had the perk got downed by the killer and activates it.
---
What will undetectable do exactly?
---
Well I'd hate to be teamed with them.
---
Ok so sandbagging and trolling and being a dick? Yeah that is toxic you are right. I thought maybe you were using the word wrong but you're right, that is definitely toxic lol
---
So then I must inform you there is no such thing as being respectful AND toxic.
---
"Oh hurr durr I sandbagged you and got you killed Sorry I'm a total dick! I totally feel bad for intentionally ruin the match for everyone! Lolz gg."
---
That's respectful to you? 
---
Like if you're a dick you're a dick. Take your apology and shove it up your ass.
---
You are part of the problem.
---
I honestly cannot fathom how someone can think it's ok to be toxic and all you gotta do is say sorry and it's like you were never a dick lol
---
That was so nice of you.. (‚Äò:
---
Could you imagine!? You're trying to get a trap off your head and Myers is stalking you.
---
The biggest reason why they haven't done this yet probably has to do with killers. On survivor side they can just add a few objectives and be done with it while nothing crazy happens, but for killers on the other hand there will probably be a lot of combinations that break the game or are insanely strong. 
---
What immediatly comes to mind are Doctor and legion : T3 madness overrides everything, so you can't mend and might bleed out before you snap out of it.
---
Also doctor and nurse: you scream once and nurse will be on top of you. 
---
Also doctor and pig: RBT and T3 madness would give the same issue as with legion.
---
Now I'm typing this out it would probably just be doctor who breaks this mode. So disable him I guess ? There will probably be more "broken" combinations I can't think of though, so they have to think of a way to fix those

It ShOuLd Be JaCk
---
I assumed the scenario in both case was that they aren't coming to get you off the hook.
---
I'd rather they let me for because they're trying to finish a gen than let me for because they're too busy fucking around and doing nothing helpful to anyone.
---
Since when is a mori a tunnel
---
Take a guess
---
You are a fucking hero
---
Can you legit hear the demogorgon screech from that far?
---
She felt like a R63 Frank to me.
---
It would be a really shitty situation if a guy on death hook gets downed and while everyone else is injured and he just activates the perk. I could be okay with the perk if it cant be activated when you've reached second stage.
---
Legion and any killer would combo really well. After finding and hitting the first survivor with his special, he becomes a bloodhound, leading the other killer to the rest of the survivors and letting that killer do clean up duty after legion.
---
Buy a 144Hz monitor and disable v-sync in the game's config.
---
&gt; **HOW TO ENSURE YOU NEVER LOSE YOUR CELLS**: If you wait until level 68 and then use 1000 cells to purchase the battlepass, **you will gain all the cells spent back, immediately**. This means that there's no risk of you losing your cells and being unable to purchase the next pass. 
---
This feels like something that Behavior would definitely change. Gotta make all the money, afterall.
---
Can you imagine running out of killer shack while dodging bubbas chainsaw just to get sniped by a billy or huntress.....

or you get to the exit of a room being chased by any killer and just as you get to the door BAM mother fucking body blocker hag and you just cornered yourself

I would love for a 2v8 mode but imagine how obscenely op it would when we started having swf killer groups..... thats 8 coordinated survivors vs 8 coordinated killer perks

Most points or last survivor wins. The sandbagging will be unreal.
---
Lag switching lately is the worst. I guess because of the anticipation of Dedicated servers and upcoming rank reset? Face-camping is still major in reds.
---
I agree, just be nice and thats it. I moved from Rocket League to dbd because of less toxicity. Got to red ranks, can't wait to drop back to green/purple and purposely stay there.
---
It's not the killers or survivors. It's a combination of Killers being toxic and lagging, and your team being selfish and DC'ing "to move on".
---
P.S. over 2day period went from rank 2, to rank 5. Just like that. Coincidence?
---
No that the closing code for bold they just missed out 1 character.
---
You spelled them wrong hun. 'Inner Strength' and 'Quick and Quiet'
---
30 meters is across the map. Also you get less bloodpoints if you camp
---
You have a point.
---
You forgot that it's a hatchet that also didn't miss.
---
Iri is a fine add-on, but only when it's alone. I think it should limit max. hatchet count, and not a relative amount (i.e. set max. hatchet count to 1 and tramp other add-ons, not offset it by - 4).
---
This is the coolest set I‚Äôve seen. Too bad I play on Xbox.. :(

Peace was never an option

I mean I main survivor but I do play killer too. Ik both sides have shit to deal with and we are all just trying to have fun. Theres to many people that just think they are right. I can be like that sometimes, but I try not to. You helped change my perception on it all a bit
---
Really Look into the 4 categories.  Keep note of your category scores as the game progresses.
---
Legion. There's something so satisfying about having everyone be scared of you cause they're injured the whole time. I also feel like you can be creative with your perk build. I love the Legion playstyle so Plague is my second favourite :)
---
Without this comment I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed lol.
---
Turns the basement into a food processor.
---
Punishes anybody who is trying to bodyblock hits, since this is so situational they likely won't realize you have it.
---
A lot worse than live Iri heads, but fun in the right situations.
---
Overall a lot of people do not think of it as a good perk because you could be doing generators and trusting your teammates to heal you which will most likely happen and I personally just don‚Äôt run it because of adrenaline I‚Äôd rather finish the gens and get my free heal
---
Blender
---
28 accidental crouches in a row.
---
well you are rank 14...
---
I agree that this would definitely make it less annoying, just make it trump all other addons like those hag addons, but still, but hatchets like that aren‚Äôt that hard to hit.
---
We all can be like that. But I'm glad I could help you change your view a bit :)
---
Beautiful. Love seeing killers get wrecked.

Ermmm a map for IT would be difficult anyway.

**You guys are getting not immersed claudettes?**
---
This is the first icon pack I have seen that I would actually consider using. I appreciate the simplicity!
---
Yeah i get that.
---
Earned?
---
I can make the same argument for adrenaline and noed
---
Both activates when gates are powered. No matter if you did well or not they activate. If you did 0 gen and just went to lockers all game it will activate regardless when gens are popped. Same for noed
---
I don't see this "earned" part at all. Both activates on the same conditions, one give health state and Sprint burst the other give extra dmg but can be denied by survivors. Adrenaline can't be denied
---
So.. where's the "earned part"?
---
Oh to be stuck at rank 14, that would be so nice.
---
Yes I will blame them lol I have put almost 200 hours into the game over the last 2.5 months and I have not a SINGLE time d/c. You want to know the secret? It's just a game and I don't get mad at people for literally playing it
---
I've seen mostly the opposite, TBH.
---
Because she‚Äôs the easiest to play as.
---
That's cool, but the main drawback with console nurse is the fps and the sensitivity cap. You can't even turn 180¬∞ while blinking, and due to the fps you can't scout while blinking either.

A bunch of people noted that he picked him up once 50% was left on the collapse timer, he probably wanted to use bloodwarden for two guaranteed kills.

Ignoring the fact that mend is paused while in terror radius and also paused once you start mending sure.

I don't blame them, especially in baby games that add-on is just dumb.

As a Jake main, I am super happy he got one of the new skins

Dude people arent lagswitching.. the dedicated servers are just lagging bruh

‚ÄúBruh‚Äù im Xbox.

OP said the image on the right was made months ago. Probably before the DS nerf/rework. Old DS was definitely considered toxic. New DS is considered toxic as well by some people, but it isn't nearly as bad as it was before.
---
Dont sweat it my man
---
He's in a weird spot, he definitely pales in comparison to the top tier killers, yeah, you can waste a lot of time with your frenzy if you find survivors packed together but thats pretty much it, he doesnt have a lot going for him.
---
Once you're injured you basically dont have to worry about his power, you just have to loop him normally, of course thats easier said than done but if you compare him to spirit or nurse or a killer with instadown looping legion is a piece of cake.
---
So yeah, he's definitely in a weak spot right now, but its not unplayable, I reached rank 3-5 consistently.
---
TL;DR  He's pretty weak, but its not impossible to play with him, you'll just have a harder time ending chases than if you were playing spirit for example.
---
[Explained.](https://steamcommunity.com/groups/OCHIDO/discussions/0/1694922980043512808/)
---
Matchbox still allows you to blink after hitting a survivor, you just don't have 2.
---
As a killer, I prefer that over clutch adrenaline play in the same situation with one guy on the hook. It's a kill non the less.
---
i just camp and tunnel
---
Proves my point
---
He's this guy who's a jerk, I dont really know anything else
---
there is no typo boi
---
The Spooky Photo Man
---
I hope you realize if they proxy chase, without having a terror radius, then they can get close to you while having the timer go down, you either get downed to the bleed out or die to the killers m1
---
Lagswitching on xbox ok
---
What don't you agree withhhhhhhhh? 
---
Killers do get powerful addons. They do get a free kill if they are unable to kill the last survivor. They do get moris. They do get a lot of options to one hit down survivors.
---
He never said anything about tunneling my man
---
Our will equal to yours
---
I said it before, I said it again: the -4 hatchets from iri hrads should trump ALL other add-ons. As in, anything that would give huntress more hatchets shouldn't work with them.
---
Ebony mori is one of the most BS things in the game. Green mori ist really strong but alright, yellow is for the memes.
---
Yep. Someone is awful insecure over a joke aren‚Äôt they?
---
So you don‚Äôt want a sewer map?
---
To each there own lol, I honestly don't want to rank up too fast and I'm not in dire need of bloodpoints since I haven't bought the dlc yet
---
On guard is coo but situational i feel, if the killer has a standard 32 meter radius and no way of hiding it its kinda either wasted or maybe in a super rare case it helps if its Hawkens or something.
---
&gt;They dont really play it no, when they did they got trounced and tbagged and just went "mmmeh whatever" continued doing what they were doing rather than womderwhy they got fucked so hard in their own game.
---
One of the lead developers does play his game and a lot. Many of the community moderators who have direct contact to BHVR also play the game.
---
i don't even think it's that bad, sounds fine to me
---
Been saying this for years..

NEEDS TO HAPPEN!

---
Isn't that just a safe pallet? What makes it more special that the pallets near the basement in The Game?
---
If you play toxic and end up getting killed you shouldn't be mad, looping and bullying a killer should be enough for them to be happy. nothing is wrong with you for hating toxic survs.
---
Or they could just chase them. If you get hit you should have the speed boost, which will be enough for you to reach a pallet or vault. Then just start mending because you are safe their. The wraith either watches you mend, or tries to hit you, but you have a pallet, so you are safe. This is really simple.
---
Those are also god pallets bud
---
I love this forecast
---
PC crossplay would actually work. Controller is an advantage as survivor, a little weaker for killer but they have to deal with 360ing survivors all the time anyway so PC really can't be much worse if worse period.
---
That's an obvious one
---
I don't hate them haha I was just really confused because I was making the most sensible play
---
Once? Hahaha.
---
Other than head on, I don't see anything that killers don't have simple counterplay for (and head on is still basically "don't walk next to a locker when carrying someone"). Further, none of those things can effectively prevent the killer from being able to play the game at all like tunneling can.
---
God im so happy im not the only one

For it to be fair I think it should be used only on first hook lol

Good survivors power through it anyways, them not being on gens would be great
---
Nice! Pop is a pretty solid choice on Legion since you usually have to choose between popping the gen or going for the potential survivor. Feral Frenzy allows you to do both a lot of the time :)
---
Good luck in your Legion matches!
---
It‚Äôs honestly just another grind on the game for cosmetics. But you can pay for more stuff to grind for.

&gt;Dude, you tripped the trap, what am I supposed to do, ignore the free hit?

Well, duh.

Tiered once and now level 40 ish Claudette main... I am still the Claudette from lore. Nothing like getting 3 or 4 unhooks and heals in a game and sacrificing yourself so everyone else gets out.
---
Basically. But she‚Äôs got a point is why she‚Äôs so famous. The world is fucked.
---
How many gens will they have to do?
---
They're the most memorable area, but they're not iconic.  Nobody could describe them other than as "sewers and caves" if you asked, and there were no special standout features aside from Pennywise.
---
Compare the sewers from IT with something like the Nostromo from Alien - it's instantly recognizable, classic, and has been influential on other set designs since.  Iconic.
---
Just the different comments in getting on this meme tells me the community is really split
---
All I wanted to do is make a bit of a joke and have people be nice to each other.

It also makes them scream (if they don't have calm spirit), revealing their location, even if they slowly exit.

Doctor and Legion: Slow the game down, **_just a little bit_**.

Doctor and Nurse: Slug time

Doctor and Pig: Might as well giveup /s

Doctor and Spirit: Hex: Get siked, boi!
---
I'm definitely going to, it just is ass I can't use better add-ons because I'm afraid it won't be worth it. That's such a bad mentality to have, being afraid of using addons lol. They are definitely entitled.. I think next time 2 people dc I'll just end the match, I dont like being forced into farming every match because of dc's.
---
depends on ranks, many might not know that no obsession means no ds
---
No screwdriver for mikey? I like it tho :)
---
It‚Äôs such a situational perk. Unless you‚Äôre running or a team mate is running bond, empathy, or aftercare it can be hard to find those randoms without wasting just as much time as self care does.
---
Yeah sorry. I just felt like venting. I love this game so much, it just sucks not being able to play a match where someone doesnt teabag
---
YES
---
On the bright side, with no addons he's terrible and can barely down anyone lol. Trying to get adept back when it was just a 4k took me like 3 days and 30 character levels üíÄ And I didn't even get it legit, an immediate double DC ended up counting üòÇ
---
Nice!
---
The only thing about red ranks is you get the occasional "gg ez baby killer" team that sweats super hard and ruins your day
---
Man i wish they brought in the Rob zombie Micheal instead. the one when he's using a paper machete mask and has the long dread locks.
---
I highly doubt it since he is kinda camping him on the ground which no survivor with a braincell would try to heal without a plan. I'm assuming he thinks the bill has DS since it seems like he was just unhooked from the basement (I'm assuming here tho)
---
You did the objective. Simple as that. Survivors did the objective.
---
And to respond to your hypothetical case. Very rarely someone stays in lockers all game and makes it to the endgame (probably because they didn‚Äôt help the team and the team couldn‚Äôt make it). But for the sake of the argument, let‚Äôs say they in fact get to the endgame. What benefit do they get from adrenaline? Healing? They were hiding in lockers all game, they weren‚Äôt injured. Speed boost? Outside of a chase it really isn‚Äôt that much of an advantage.
---
NOED on the other hand ALWAYS rewards the killer for performing poorly. If all gens get done, you‚Äôve failed your objective, like it or not.
---
I got it as soon as he came out due to a horribly stupid SWF
---
If I see an Adam Francis farm his teammate just to get the proc, I usually let the unhooked person go and then camp the Adam to Phase II. Then I tell him not to farm his teammates in post chat lol.
---
Does prework legion still exist?
---
They should the house on Nebolt street
---
that poor pig
---
Great image! Love the colors
---
I would agree with but the one exception would be Trapper. At tier 2 it still let's you know if you can safely place his traps. Granted a very niche use of the perk.
---
The barrens with access to the sewers under the map would be amazing
---
What?

---
Which cheeks
---
Thank you! Enjoyed working on it :)
---
I hope so too, that's all I want.
---
I want to be able to have close fun games with every Killer, but that's simply not possible as there are simply unwinnable games that start in the fucking lobby, let alone if you make a miss-play in game.
---
Every Killer except those two are just play things to most survivors so they do be pieces of shit like you've experienced, when that happens, I will rejoice.
---
yea all in all balanced landing is best. i think depending on ur build the exhaustion perk differentiates. so like for lithe builds i run dance with me, for dead hard i run iron will etc.
---
Killer had a mori and wanted a better spot because he wanted to see the mori. 
---
The killer deserved a stun because he wanted to use his offering, okay
---
Killers like this actually deserved Tbag, honestly.
---
There are situations where the killer isn‚Äôt tunneling, but waiting 60 seconds to hook a survivor to wait out DS can really screw you over. I definitely have had times where I really need one death hook to even have a chance at coming back. The 60 second wait can be a really long time in certain situations for sure especially against a good SWF team.
---
Nah she getting the bing bong
---
 **Who you gonna call?**
---
Definitely. I was a little confused at first because they lowered the charges to 16 which is the same amount as Camping medkits but they buffed the healing speed so I guess it evens out.
---
Yeah, literally what you described has been affecting me too.
---
Found the survivor main
---
It's all additive. 100% (base) - 100% (iron will) + 50% (stridor) =50% noise.
---
Same with no mither. It takes out 50% and then stridor will add that 50% back so itll counter and be at 100% sound. It doesn't take it down to 50% then add back 50% of that 50% to get 75%
---
Thats fine for me.
---
Yh bc we all remember the sewers layout and think of the same sewer when someone mentions IT. They aren‚Äôt iconic at all
---
I actually dropped a survivor the other day because they were the obsession and the last gen popped, went to mori them and realized the survivor had adrenaline and they just ran off!
---
What would the harm be in blackpipping, even if they are doing something like that?
---
Odd bulb is trash
---
Just call him The Ghostface. Fuck this fucking GH0$T F3CE  @BHVR
---
just type "the + one fucking word". please.
---
Never seen a Huntress do this. Usually they stay at the top of the stairs for the free hit. #feelsbadman.
---
You could say the same about any killer though, downing injured people isn't limited to Ghostface ;)
---
Yeah I agree this works pretty well
---
Looks like the devs aren't paying that add-on any attention either.
---
the part you explained that‚Äôs fun I don‚Äôt see how the skin being in the shop again ruins the fun. You still get extra blood points and unlock a neat event themed cosmetic.
---
*DIDN'T WANT TO GIVE HIM A CHANCE HUH?*
---
Im I am ok thank you for asking about my metal health didn't know ppl on the web cared lol
---
&gt;She‚Äôs been consistently an S-tier killer as long as I can remember although you have to be very mechanically skilled, under the right hands you are practically always guaranteed a 4K
---
Untrue. And she was the only killer that didn't need add-ons to be consistently good. And now she's become the same add-on reliant dumpster fire that Wraith, Plague, Legion, Bubba, Pig, Trapper, and Ghostface exist in. She's nothing compared to Spirit now. 
---
We needed less add-on reliant killers, not more. If Surviviors get to be viable without items killers should be viable without add-ons. Period. 
---
And for your "she's constantly been S tier" comment. Any and all informed opinions about Nurse never mention her base kit because her base kit was jukable and counterable. It's the fact that the counterplay wasn't the same as it is for other killers, that made her a heretic in the eyes of Surviviors. You can't loop her? Suddenly she has no counterplay. Her power came with drawbacks. She's slower than every other killer and Survivior in the game, meaning she NEEDS her blinks to move around, apply pressure, and chase. 
---
What this nerf did was kick down her map pressure and make it possible to infinitely juke her without much effort. So no. This nerf WAS that bad. 
---
&gt;Moderators and developers work on two different subjects and never have their jobs intersect.
---
My bad.
---
Hahaha yeah I always get spooked when I see an Adam enter the lobby :)
---
Just mend at a pallet, it‚Äôs very simple. If you don‚Äôt like the add or you don‚Äôt understand it, just stop using it. It was broken before and now it‚Äôs fine, deal with it.
---
this laurie is much much cuter then the one ingame.
---
They can use "–ü—Ä–∏–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ" instead of "–ü—Ä–∏–∑—Ä–∞–∫", esli chto
---
I feel you man!
---
We should all just be excellent to each other :)
---
Just imagine getting tunneled by 2 killers at the same time
---
Why are you laughing?! 
---
Because he/she/it is trying to kill me
---
If I see them get unhooked and I down them most of the time I will pick them up to get rid of DS and then chase the other person I still get points either way
---
A whole new mechanic is never ever regarded as slight. Any competent game development team knows that
---
tall freddy must be the most epic bruh moment in dbd so far
---
Can‚Äôt you use mouse and keyboard on ps4?
---
When I play I always want everyone in the match to have fun even if I‚Äôm in a bad mood and I keep thinking the survivors are judging me or I‚Äôm not intimidating enough
---
The more you stare at it the weirder it gets
---
Eh I mean if gens were doubled and even secondary objectives were thrown in, I don't think it'd be too bad.
---
I also like balancing, since it also give you that resistance against falling, that isn't so much but it's better than nothing
---
Depends on a role. Supports usually stay the same. But if you give nice character a gun and say that this character supposed to be an assassin... Well, nice character that's also good at killing can't be quite right in the head.
---
Cause she‚Äôs pretty un fun to play against, most people want a more fun experience.  Instead of wasting 15-20 minutes in a game and no punishment for DCing you can back out with ease
---
More points for you right! I usually just go for the one doing the unhook
---
How long did you stand there with her?
---
I feel this is accurate about any kind of nerf/buff ever. Any change is a HOW DARE THEY. .
---
You have to spend roughly 70\~ hours, by Dev estimates to "Get your money back."  You are paying for the ability to grind and potentially the ability to get your money back, neither are guaranteed and I call the tactic predatory for that reason.
---
Moreover there has never been a free tree in ANY game with a battle pass that is worth doing for free. None.  Not a single one.  DBD won't be the first nor last that is true.
---
Babay wraith after a flashlight save :3
---
or 4 v 4, legion vs survivors
---
There‚Äôs a few ways you can do it:) 
---
(If you have the PS4 Messages app) you can save a cosmetic banner or whatever custom banner you want on your phone and send it to someone on your friends list. You can then go into your messages on your PS4 and click on the image so it‚Äôs full screen. You can then press the share button on your ps4 and press triangle and it screenshots it for you. You can then go into themes on PS4 and select the screenshot and make it your new theme:) 
---
Or you can go into your internet browser on PS4 and google what photo you want and screenshot it in the same way :)
---
If this sounds complicated I‚Äôll leave a tutorial link below on one of the ways you can do it. They probably explain it better :) 
---
[Tutorial link ](https://youtu.be/5W5A68Py67E)
---
Myers + Trapper. You cannot escape the stalk
---
Freddy and huntress would have some synergy, since his traps slow survivors. Other than that I‚Äôd go with doctor and pretty much any other killer
---
[^^](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/493/192/91d.png)
---
Unless your into having killers up your ass I agree this is not very nice X)
---
I'm talking about games like Dead or Alive 3. You would play the same character's story mode multiple times to get a new outfit for them each time. My favourite character probably had 20 different outfits and everytime I would replay what was essentially the same thing but with a couple variations each time I didn't feel the repetition fatigue because I was working towards something cool you know? Even a recent example would be PS4 Spider-Man, you keep playing the game you unlock new suits that you like. I'm just trying to get at that I'd rather earn cosmetics rather than pay for them. And battle passes are for free to play games. I don't think the battle pass concept in itself is bad I just feel like they should either do a premium track in a free to play game or they should just have a battle pass with no premium because the game does have a price of entry point and I don't think you should be paying to unlock things that are meant to be unlocked when you've already purchased a game
---
You can mindgame a Spirit, and there‚Äôs clear counterplay to her. Unless she‚Äôs using prayer beads
---
I got to red ranks playing Nurse without add-ons. 
---
This nerf makes 1 juke able to end her career for 2/3/4 gens (and this is an issue people have with M1 killers so why TF people are happy this is possible is beyond me). And it kicks down her map pressure in the most unnecessary way.
---
Doctor has way better tracking than Legion, and he can fuck up small loops with shock if he‚Äôs good. Bubba has an instadown. 
---
Legion barely stalls and has shitty tracking. He is trash.
---
Not sure why the killer didn't just fake a pickup to bait the pallet drop.
---
That's fair. Ive just learned to play dbd on a timer. When I get too high rank the timers up and I gotta wait.
---
Yes they are, i find the one on the right cutiest tho
---
Downvoted for harassment of eggs benedict
---
Thank you! :D
---
But...they're clearly glasses in the drawn painting? You can see the little leg hinges and everything.
---
I'm just glad they're not VIOLET on the lenses like the 4K renders were showing.
---
Bill was the first guy I P3'd. Now I know why I get tunnelled and camped playing him. TY, chart
---
Huntress figure when?!
---
Trapper is a member of r/hydrohomies
---
Yeah she... she does that. Mei is a bit sadistic.
---
Look at Ash. Hunk would be fine.
---
Are people dumb it‚Äôs in their guidelines to not abuse exploits, HELL THEY EVEN SAID IT ON STREAM ONCE FFS.
---
THEY SHOULD BE FLOGGED
---
And I'm just over here being happy this game keeps me so entertained and trying to be nice it others
---
Have fun when dedicated servers come out and they punish entitled survivors who think they have a right to DICTATE what a killer plays.  Get outta here with that shit.
---
Ok thank you
---
Nah, my mans trapper is a /r/waternigga
---
This is assuming you constantly grind out the 70\~ hours the Dev says it will take, ballpark to complete the thing.  So then at that point yes it can pay for itself but it's not guaranteed that you will always complete it unless you commit a lot of time to DBD primarily.
---
I'm sorry. I just do not like this skin. Especially the flabby neck that gives her a triple chin
---
See survivors plead 
---
‚Äúpathetic‚Äù proceeds to mori survivor‚Äù
---
Probably, I have only went against it twice (it's called pinky finger right?) so in a year and a half I have been playing but I see survivors complain on discord every once in a while
---
Usually a thank you tbag is two slow crouches while a fuck you teabag is turning around and rapidly crouching.
---
You wouldn't have to worry about DS if you weren't going straight back to the hook the very second they get off it like a desperate noob. That's literally the purpose behind DS now. You might be new and might not know about the DS nerf but before the nerf you could use DS any time you wanted. Now it can only be used if you were recently taken off the hook.
---
Sure, people can bait you into it by jumping into lockers or staying on a gen and letting you grab them off of it but they're not going to go out of their way to bait a DS hit knowing the killer has a mori unless they're braindead idiots or they have no other option at that point. Your meme that you made on the other hand basically just says you're a desperate noob and you deserve every second of that stun you just got.
---
I wonder if you can overlap Freddy pallets and doctor pallets...
---
What BLOWS my mind are killers using the term "gen rush" its the literal objective of the survivors. Its their only hope of escaping oh and it happens to be the entire point of their gameplay.
---
Should they slowly do gens for you? "Gen RUSH" lol I can't
---
"I can't believe survivors try and accomplish their only purpose as fast as they can, thats a gen rush!"
---
I talk in very stupid manners where if I don't see it happen yet to me it's just a blind promise.  So they say they will, they likely will, BHVR doesn't lie but I have the trust issues of a Koala Bear who had to hang out with Saturn Bears for it's infancy.
---
It's true. A lot of red ranks do seem to be mentally unstable children.
---
Nope, only Xbox I think.
---
But seriously, who the fuck use m&amp;k on console anyway?
---
Tru3Ta1ent
---
I drew this before being aware that the screwdriver was for him. I'm so hyped for the pipe though!!
---
Anyway, thank you! :D
---
Ghost Face is the name of the mask, and they use that name (with permission of the creator) in the movie. When BHVR bought the rights to "ghost face", they bought the right to the mask, not the movie.
---
Only survivor, which is odd.
---
Given Dwight and Claudette got the Hallowed Blight outfits, I would've thought Meg would have also got a Hallowed Catalyst outfit.
---
She's the only one of the O4 without one, now.
---
That‚Äôs pretty hypocritical. I got it during the event so why should someone else be able to get it if they didn‚Äôt participate in the event? It‚Äôs not entitlement, it‚Äôs common sense.
---
Nah, I main Huntress and I find iri.head super annoying. I get it.
---
This post actually got marked as NSFW I'm dying rn
---
I play games for fun.  I understand others do that too, so if they aren‚Äôt having fun, they‚Äôll leave.  She‚Äôs the most boring killer to play against IMO so it‚Äôs easier to just DC than waste 20 minutes.
---
I played her just for the lore lol
---
He can 4k with any killer using no addons almost every game. He also got from rank 20 to 1 in 10hrs with no perks or addons ever being used.
---
All that matters to Survivors (most of them at least), is that you try your best and never give up while not playing too scummy. There will always be the occasional dickhead but you got to learn to ignore those. 
---
Sometimes the way the game goes isn‚Äôt even in your hands. You can always get a bad map or bad luck with say totem placement etc. just don‚Äôt get discouraged cause this happens to the best.
---
Yea the nicer tactic doesn't work. I try as hard as I can do avoid doing stuff that would be seen as toxic. I get tunneled into the ground in 80-90% of my games. I'm really close to just becoming toxic and being a dick because no matter how nice I am I always get treated like shit.
---
I was waiting for the wraith stun elephant noise but it never came :(
---
I finished this series last week and the VA is so good but I wanted more monster fighting castle delving
---
Wow way to ruin everyone's fun. Just deal with the mori, chances are they are using a meme build, only a very small percentage actually use it with toxic intent
---
The dude with a 30 rack driving a Buick

You can bring a med-kit which allows you to heal yourself.
---
Doctor
---
Huntress
---
Demogorgon
---
Nightmare
---
i had the same theme on the ps4 for the last 20 years
---
The Goth Daddy.
---
lol you can play whatever you want, just not against me or anyone else that dislike spirit üòÇ we aren't dictating anything 
---
I am not worried about servers, I'll just die on hook.
---
A coordinated team is devastating
---
Otzdarva is super knowledgeable and skilled as killer &amp; Puppers is one of the best survivors. (imo)
---
&gt;Does that mean nurse is getting the ~~ding dong~~
---
No, she's getting the Bing Bong.
---
Fungoose handsdown
---
Legion and Pig.
---
Legion puts everybody into Deep Wound.
---
Ghostface chases them with no terror radius so they can't mend.
---
She is a fun killer
---
And from someone like me who plays both killer and survivor I think she is fun to play against as well
---
She keeps you on your toes and makes you think.  You need to play a sneakier game vs her.  Problem is all people want to do is play ring around the pallets all day while their friends do 2-3 gens at a time
---
She can handle the pressure...  so that immediately makes her ‚Äúunfun‚Äù...
---
I'm going to be honest, I don't always remember who I hooked. So if I come back to an unhook and see 2 injured survivors, it's a 50/50 chance someone is getting "tunneled".
---
This is an excellent idea, but I doubt the devs could pull it off smoothly.
---
Not to mention how long the matchmaking would be 0_0
---
I feel bad for killing the new players but I never know if they‚Äôre new or not.
---
All this will do is punish killers who staying back and watching out for idiots who rush unhooks survivors rarely think about how other survivors play a lot of survivors will sprint towards the hook and run around it and crouch walk around it imagine being punished for trying to stop a cocky dumbass from instantly unhooking a survivor
---
I did. I got one heal off myself. But get this: Im at rank 1. You'd think solo queue wouldn't be suicide, but it still is most of the time. At least on console.
---
&gt; I've been calling it Battlepass because I haven't seen the official name yet
---
Given he literally just called it 'the Rift', you really have no excuse now.
---
Wtf is the other guy even saying. Bills been on PS4 for a while.
---
What a legend.
---
To be honest, although he isn't in a great spot he is quite fun to play. I main Legion and I never have a bad time. Also
---
28 STAB WOUNDS
---
Nothing is cuter than implied murder, you are right.
---
Definitely Zubatlel
---
Funny thing is if we all started treating the other side like human beings we wouldn't need to fight
---
I haven‚Äôt got the skin yet, but I hope they leave this bug just a little bit longer...
---
Thank you
---
How come this only ever happens to Nancy ü§î
---
Personally I like spies from the Shadows better. Might not work great in higher ranks where survivors know to crouch past Birds but if you're just starting out it should be very useful. Whispers probably better at higher ranks.
---
Exactly survivors seem to forgot how other survivors play all the suggestions they give would also punish killers who try defending from people who instantly unhook or crouch/loop around the hook what are killers supposed to be punished for trying to chase a survivor
---
Bring a med-kit, or Bond. Bond is very helpful for when you need a quick heal.
---
It's so beautiful.
---
This community as a whole needs to stop being such babies about who they go up against. Literally any killer can use whatever and people will still dc.. The real problem here is the dev's are continuously allowing this behavior. If you dc or suicide you screw over teammates too, that's a shitty way to play this game. There needs to be harsher punishments for this. I'll continue playing my favorite killer no matter what people do, screw this community.
---
ITS MY FREEDOM OF SPEECH AAAAAA
---
His playstyle is making everyone just heal, which is dull for survivors. 
---
His power isn‚Äôt useful to get downs. 
---
Coming out of FF is a 4 sec stun, longest in the game. 
---
His vaults even when FF are slow. 
---
Boring as skins. 
---
Those two perks. You know the ones.
---
The issue is most people pick a side and die by them
---
Everyone (whether you like it or not) should play both sides at some point... you really understand what goes on with both ends instead of having tunnel vision
---
And I don‚Äôt mean ‚ÄúI played 50 killer games and I played over 1000 games as survivor so I know about both just fine‚Äù I mean dive in on both sides and really see what goes on
---
Right! Big difference between skill and being toxic. I play mostly killer and I come across survivors who have legitimate good skill and you can respect it. I've gone against some good surviors and the impress me and even if I end up getting them as a sign of respect I'll let them go.
---
Then you come across those who may or may not have skill and have to do everything they can to make you mad, teabagging, flashlight spam and so on... it's these people that make people not return or stick with the game and then bitch about queue times and playerbase... 
---
Then as you said those who do stick with it will often turn to the meta and nothing else or become toxic themselves and then people bitch its boring I've faced nothing but billy, nurse spirit all day!
---
Sometimes its fun just picking a killer and perks just because and not caring if you get 0 kills but a lot survivors make it not fun...
---
Why can't people just enjoy the chase and the thrill of the match and move on to the next.
---
People who take it too serious likely have nothing worth anything in their day to day lives is my guess... got to feel good by picking on others I guess..
---
Not really, I never even had ruin for any of my killers up until recently, and even when I did the survivors always managed to cleanse it within the first few minutes.
---
I'll never get why people are butt hurt by being teabagged. Every teabag is time you could have spent putting distance between me and you.
---
me and me
---
I might strech things a  bit, I will get the head and body but not the weapon so I can get 3 killer sets.
---
I really want that last year doc, he looks sick AF.
---
"EVERYONES FUN" lol
---
One who doesn't stream most probably.
---
Exactly! She can handle pallet loops so survivors cry. I like going up against Spirit as survivor because it makes me a better player in the end, it's too bad others don't see it that way. Its infuriating playing killer lately.. I blame the dev's for feeding into this mentality. :/
---
In my opinion, probably Otzdarva. Great player, and great dude.
---
Just go into the Xbox or PS4 store and you'll be able to download it for free.
---
People complain about it? Lucky me, I've gone against it twice tonight and it makes the game a bit harder, you have to be careful and have tricky movement so he cant land a direct hit but its not OP in any shape.
---
So the fucking Leprechaun from Leprechaun like 6 or wtf ever where he literally pops out of a dudes dick after impregnating said dick with his ashes that swam UP his uretha like that one fish we aren't allowed to talk about ?

*The 90s were weird.*
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
i swapped dead hard with lithe like last month and oh boy, best decision ever. never gonna use dead hard again.
---
More like: "I can't believe the community is so toxic and hostile towards me. You need to grow up and learn how to be nice to people"
---
The guy in the background is so f'n annoying
---
Im  a killer main. Should i buy lullaby? I already have discordance.
---
It‚Äôs specifically a licensing issue.
---
The other night me and my boys figured we get some points... 
---
I played a gruesome, 2 of my boys played bps and the other home had an cake. 
---
We loaded into the game map random no offering. We found out it was a spirit with beads... 
---
We all gave her 1 hit and then dced... This is at rank one... We bring all that shit for points just to go up against a spirt with beads and ring + bbq,surveillance,discordance,sloppy. We all agreed when we found out she had beads that we would dc after she got a hit... We care about having fun and getting points. It was better to dc, we dont care about rank and damn sure dont think some spirit should be thinking they are good because we wern't rocking iron will... After the game she was all GG ez blah blah blah... i guess she thought she was good and not getting carried by perks add ons and character. We want a challenge when playing but having no chance is no fun honestly.
---
Doctor's tracking isn't all game, especially if you pop all their madness early. Survivors don't scream that often otherwise and his antiloop isn't great without range addons and only in small loops really.
---
Good luck using that insta down with Bubba on anyone other than rank 20s.
---
Childish? Hold up. This game is super cheap as is. You bought the game like you would have any other, you even spent less money. 
---
With most other games this exchange is done. For BHVR to make new content they can't just do it for free. Should they just continue to make years of content and expect no return?
---
It's not that I don't want to support the game I'm just thinking about how this trend is happening in other games that aren't free to play. Full $70 dollars games that only have 1 game mode or like 2 or 3 more if you're lucky, with gameplay that you'll get fatigued from very easily because it's repetitive. I'm saying that if I say "oh it's only ok if this one does it because it's a game I like" then why should I be mad when those $70 games do the same thing? I've spent money for continued support of the game, I've bought most of the dlc characters except for a few I just wasn't interested in and I've even bought a $13 skin so don't even say I just don't want to support the game lol. My problem is they've gone and done a battlepass so you can unlock cool things while you play which is cool in itself, but with a premium currency in a game we've already paid an entry price for. Battle passes with premium currency make sense in free to play games because they're saying ok you can go through the gameplay loop but you won't get the full experience and feel accomplished after playing unless you win or you pay to still get an award after which makes sense for that. In games with a paid entry point this isn't the case though. I'm not complaining about something cause I don't want to pay for it I'm complaining about the practice and the fact that it's becoming a trend to not give the full experience in a game you already paid upfront for.
---
Holy shit this is so good. (ÔΩ°‚Ä¢ÃÄ·¥ó-)
---
Yeah, this is why I carry them to a hook, shake no,  and then head to the gate. There are still people who will claim ez, but it shows them I could have ended it and decided not to
---
"gg ez"
---
It's hilarious really ^^
---
Art my me. Can we get the goth cosmetics collection for the all killers?
---
Huntress yes please the doctor no no oh god no nooooooo
---
These would be great if they released them with a Pinhead chapter
---
Yea but it's a lot easier for him. Plus people will be more likely to cleanse because they'll be scared
---
YES DOCTOR YES! YES YES YES!!!üò§
---
More like we just don't use them so the killer don't get triggered and exit the lobby immediately just because they see prestige outfit.  You may think I'm kidding but sadly I'm not.
---
Yeah, I play mostly survivor, and I've seen both, which honestly makes me kinda disappointed. 
---
Also, let everyone choose what perks they wanna use! Let's not call it toxic just because we dislike it!
---
Noed is fine! Ds is fine! EVEN if it's annoying, everyone has a right to choose the perks and not get insulted for it
---
I‚Äôm waiting for the Pinhead, he should join DBD
---
I just slug/waste BT.
---
Huntress looks like venom
---
Lies. He has been on ps4 for quite a while
---
Oh, damn! This is great!!!!!!
---
üò≠ I was so hyped today because leaks said it would happen today and I'm really sad now bruh
---
Lmao wasn't going for that but fair criticismüëèüëèüëè
---
Sexy venom.
---
Maybe it has a better response time or somethin. TVs usually have a bunch of processing they do unless you turn it off whereas monitors usually don't.
---
Bill is on ps4 now tho. And you have to level him to get his perks.
---
It‚Äôs totally understandable esp if you have multiples of the same survivor.
---
Problem is 90% survivors are not human beings
---
I wasn't even talking about the battle pass, I was just talking about skins in general.  Besides, this one's pretty lenient since you can complete the free track THEN get the premium to unlock everything and then get the next rift free.
---
To be fair clowns are so rare these days (for me that is)
---
Getting carried by perks and addons? Pretty sure that goes for survivor too huh? Not every Spirit uses beads, and honestly it shouldn't matter. Stop thinking whatever is toxic and just play. I'm main killer now but I still play survivor when I used to be a survivor main. There are ways to counter prayer beads, listen for footsteps or maybe use Spine Chill. Survivors want to use the meta perks, so killer will do the same. I will never understand this mentality and its cancer to this game.
---
Do it for Jake_Theviking
---
Or Small Game
---
Listen here firebreakog, I pulled an all nighter and I‚Äôm tired but I just pulled an almost direct quote from what someone said on a forum talking about this situation lol
---
Ok ‚ÄúBDSM GOTH‚Äù
---
I like to rotate out killers but I enjoy Spirit most because I'm a huge fan of Japanese demons and Japanese horror. It's sad that I'm just wanting to enjoy the game on my shitty PS4 that doesn't even get good frame rates half the time. #feelsbad :'(
---
Sprint Burst. Running once you see the DW timer. Running in a straight line.
---
I remember old Legion, they had counterplay. Scattering was easy and made Legion's ability useless repeatedly.
---
I'd rather that hook be replaced with a spatula so we can get The Hash-Slinging Slasher
---
I don‚Äôt mean to cause an argument just stating a fact
---
Hehehe agreed
---
"Ironical"
---
I think if you actually report any of those you should reset to rank 20, lose all BP amd have a 24 hr game ban.
---
Any game is winnable, no matter what you think. There are counters to everything, your just too pussy to try. If survivers would actually try to comeback and win, they might be suprised by the results. And you might get dodged **once**, but killers get dodged **every time**, which is the shitty part.
---
Bubba and nurse, nurse to down and hook and bubba to camp out all of the hooks.

Doctor Sleep is coming out soon, Danny Torrence could be the survivor, and the Overlook Hotel with hedgemaze as the map. Danny's Shining ability could be represented in his perks with some sort of aura reading abilities.

Once I ran into two shirtless survivors as trapper
---
**i made sure they escaped while the filthy non meme shirt wearers were slain**
---
Nah I‚Äôm not arguing. Sorry if it came off that way!
---
Well you said it yourself 
---
&gt;I don't see anything that killers don't have simple counterplay for
---
The counterplay for teabagging is tunneling the teabagger, so I guess we know why some people always seem to be complaining about getting tunneled...
---
Yeah I just found his videos and like... one out of 10 of his ‚Äútoxic survivor‚Äù videos are actually toxic. It‚Äôs kinda off putting.
---
tldr
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 also, i usually maim Myers at rank 1 but yesterday used spirit and was instantly t-bagged at the start of the game. After sacrificing the last survivor, i was called a no life and a try hard because i played as spirit. I didn‚Äôt camp or tunnel but made sure the t-bagger didn‚Äôt get hatch.
---
This looks really nice! I have a P3 Legion and I play them when I want to farm... but it is typically painful. ;-;
---
I have a question... why do they all have headphones?
---
Ah :(
---
I hate people that do that, I have 700 hours and I have never dced on purpose, because how else are you going to get better if you fear one/two particular killers or prepare your whole set just to face a few particular killers.
---
Wow you got the look so perfect, I honestly couldn‚Äôt tell if this was a picture or an in-game screenshot!
---

Honestly, a good description of nurse is, what if there was a killer that could just look at you and hit you. What if we made pallets and windows non existent for them. What if, they could go through WALLS. 
---
Nurse has always been the top of the top. The changes to her baskit aren't really that noticeable unless youve memorized her timings to the millisecond and if thats the case, then you really just aren't open to any change. Brining her down is just making the game better because almost no one wants to go against a killer they have almost no say in when they be downed. The nerf actually brought the game up by taking her down. Shes still visible and top teir too.
---
Why u bringing purole items, lags witching won't be a thing anymore with dedicated servers, getting farmed is your teammates fault, there's one killer who can teabag, face camped oh well the killer will loose points so meh
---
Nice dude
---
Yeah sometimes you can't help it when they all look the same

It's the same picture.
---
Oh god can we get a request for 2v8?
---
I don‚Äôt think you need to expect everyone to equally split their time, while it‚Äôd probably help it‚Äôd be better if both sides just recognized the scummy things they do to each other and realized there‚Äôs an actual person behind each character
---
Sleep now sweet prince, as Dweet will protect you in your dreams.
---
&gt; besides the bonus points
---
I feel like the bonus points alone are enough to earn it a perk slot for every killer that has it unlocked regardless of anything else. Gotta have them BP.
---
Yeah this is a valid way of dealing with DS
---
I think what it is is that the glasses look like they don't have lenses. That's the case for basically every survivor with glasses except Ace and his sunglasses. However, since they can get that right, why not make this cosmetic have it too?
---
I feel like the Undetectable one is REALLY good and adds a bit of a spook factor. You now have a silent floating ghost stalking after you. Or the one that makes you go the speed of Trapper, so now Bloodlust actually matters. Or the one that resets your position. Holy shit that one could lead to fun mind games. You have some standard stuff like fatigue and charge modifiers, but a lot of them actually could change your strategy and make her more fun to pick up and learn for new players.
---
I think you have to be a little "memey" with some of them to keep them interesting
---
I am rank 1 Legion main ;) legion's a good killer if you know what you are doing. Sure compares to Nurse or spirit he's lacking power, but he's definitely the most fun killer to play, and being able to put multiple survivors in Deep wound in less than a minute is something that no other killer can do. Also look at the cosmetics, they are wonderful. Have a good day
---
Fungoose.
---
He couldn't even read the hashtag LMAO.
---
damn this change would make it top tier but it's not that bad at the moment it does it's job
---
"Better play the characters i want or I'll treat you like garbage."
---
Not equally
---
But more than a little, ya know?
---
So many people don‚Äôt realize what it takes to be a killer and so many don‚Äôt realize what it takes to be a survivor 
---
A first hand experience would really open their eyes
---
Yeah, the lurex thing might be explained by cost, same for the gloves attached to the sleeves, but things like the Sash, and the drapes under the arms?  but the most important part is if they are supposed to be the same costume, why didn't they used the movie one? after all it is a videogame, even if the costume was made of silk and gold it would not make much of a difference
---
Facts
---
This is adorable, love it!

[Link to wallpaper](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/472/7S4MYRLAXOOZ.jpg)
---
I think that one is the high res link, the other ones I found were all blurry.
---
Killers should be have friendly fire on
---
Because they were cocky enough to taunt me instead of run away
---
**now if it‚Äôs to keep my Agro off their friends and to save their team as much time as possible to heal and do gens despite clearly being a team of randoms, I will have respect for them.**
---
Lol, teabagging doesn't actually do anything, there is nothing to counter.
---
I'd be cool to also have a killer competitive mode where killers compete for most points on top of everything
---
What about [this](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/472/7S4MYRLAXOOZ.jpg) one?
---
I run no mither, self care, inner strength, and second wind like a true güòéaüòémüòéeüòér
---
it's a bit frustrating when the killer goes for you when you got farmed right in front of them though
---
That‚Äôs why I like Puppers, he‚Äôs super fun to watch and I‚Äôve learned a few things about looping because of him. Otz very well may not be the best killer but to the best of my knowledge he is. Who would you say is the best killer? I want to expand my options!
---
where is this from? it sounds familiar
---
I've recently leveled nancy and have been running inner strength. I'd say at least 75% of the games I play have ruin. So I've typically got a charge of inner strength about a minute into the game. 
---
Between that and my teammates occasionally throwing me a heal, I've been able to ditch self-care for the most part. 
---
I still occasionally use self-care if my team is looking super unreliable.
---
I'm a rank 1 too and it's been since Legion that i don't use Self Care. As long as you're decent, you're better doing gens than healing yourself.
---
Wow.. I'm sorry.  I've had my messages blocked on PS4 for awhile because of the direct salt. People have their own made up rules on what killers they'll go against, Spirit is hated because she can't be countered and prayer beads. I dont camp or tunnel either, it's just sad the amount of abuse certain killers get if you even play them.
---
I need her name, Michael. Or i will turn on my flasglight, u want it ?
---
It does go for Survivor too. But we were playing for fun. I had Wglf, Bt, dh, Hope. None of my team was rocking meta shit that night because we were on a stacks spree... I never called her toxic, We just all know coming from rank 1 killers and survivors. That there is no chance against that build on that map with those perks. So we decided to jump into the next game... Instead of deal with shit there is no chance. 
---
Like i said we enjoy a challenge and have beaten Beads many times before... But they fact we are running shit perks just playing for fun. It was more satisfying to leave than to waste time getting hit and then being tracked down because we are injured and she just has to listen to us as she moves 2x faster than us... LOL dude cut the bs if you are a killer main and play spirit you know that shit is easy... Beads and a ring just pretty much makes sure the survivors have zero chance to get away lol. Like i said we show respect to Spirits that use activation of duration... but if you using all that other shit, beads + ring, Glasses + beads+sloppy. You just want to be a scumbag... 
---
I get 4ks all the time with ghostface and myers and i feel like i have to work for that shit... When i play spirit easiest games ever. I stand still and get free hits... LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
---
You could have picked a cloaked Wraith to stand there but *NOOO*
---
Yet you dont even try, you see it, you leave. You just have it in your head its OP and cannot be countered so you leave without giving it any effort whatsoever. You know what i find funny? Survivers can run whatever they want withput being looked down upon. Keys, gen rush boxes, you name it. But god forbid a killer run something remotely powerful, and if they do they can fuck right off correct? You dont see killers DCing cause a surviver opened the hatch or is gen rushing nearly as often.
---
Unfun appears to equal hard to play against. I hear the same argument every time I play hag with any range upgrade. I‚Äôll also point out the entitlement I see from survivors in this thread saying that they dc because spirit is ‚Äúunfun‚Äù, which obviously makes the game unfun for those that stay and the killer.  You don‚Äôt have to win every game, and when you do beat her it feels all the more satisfying knowing how hard fought your victory was.
---
If they‚Äôre new then they don‚Äôt know what the fuck prayer beads even do or that they can read descriptions on results screen.
---
Your sacrifice will be remembered, Nea. A hero has fallen.
---
Anyone got the link to the image? Asking for a friend.
---
There are definitely some I like. The undetectable one would be better if it removed her scream as well.
---
She has 2 add ons that are literally just her perks stridor and nurses calling which sucks because there's no thought to it. Plus they're on timers. Like why does 60 seconds matter while I'm chasing them or if they're o na hook. Absolute garbage.
---
The debuffing point add ons are cool but why have more than 1? Trash lol
---
Like they removed 3 add ons that increased her blink movement speed. What happened to those? Why can't 1 add on be like the old knit comb.
---
I just don't get the thought process.
---
Oh ok thanks for the clarification apology excepted
---
Detroit become human
---
People who are new to the game and thus don‚Äôt know what they do. aka these rank 20s who prolly just had bad connection
---
It isn't really necessarily gender specific in German though. There are no logical reasons behind it sometimes. I don't know how to explain this as a German myself tbh. 
---
Other examples are maybe "Der Hund" (the dog), "Die Katze" (the cat) or even "Das Kind" (the child). No specific gender attatched and it could be both, yet there are all different articles.
---
true I guess
---
Yeah i‚Äôve noticed a lot of players that play DBD have their messages turned off. i‚Äôm probably gonna do the same also. I see more toxic survivors than killers and i rotate between each side every day. Too many small minded, entitled survivors.
---
Has the event started?
---
Right???
---
Agreed! Its hard enough playing killer because PS4 barely gets 30 frames but it sucks even more when you just want to play your favorite killer and you get harassed and bullied. Lots of kids playing this game I guess.. I'm a 34 year old woman playing this game so I wouldn't be surprised.
---
I dont think it would matter those add ons dominate low rank player and it's not fun for them so they D/C that all
---
The Writer - Jack Torrance. Make it happen BHVR.
---
Thanks. I like to know the killer understands my good meaning.
---
Its a despicable thing to do, it annoys the killer and makes you look like an asshole.
---
But it is kinda funny tho.
---
What, how was the survivor being toxic? And there is no rule here? What kind of mentality is that
---
Bad grammar sorry. I was asking if it was out on PS4 yet and if I will have enough time to complete it without about 8 hours per week.
---
FUCK YEAH FINALLY NO MITHER
---
David, in c teir, 
---
BISH WHAT
---
exactly, people ranting makes me wanna use anal beads more often
---
you can just slowly move your joystick in a circle, no need to harm the thing
---
I'd say it's a bit different though, the grind in this game is mostly meaningless after the first few dozen hours, and doesn't really help you that much afterwards, you just need to get several good perks and experiment with builds as you play, while most f2p games lock content behind stats, meaning you have to grind to advance and unlock content.
---
It's everything I wanted. ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
You‚Äôd probably be disappointed to know how many bubba 4ks I get in rank 9+
---
We also tried it with The Demogorgon, his hands and feet both shrink
---
Sounds great! More diverse killers on console is always a plus in my book. I very rarely see Nurse on PS4 red ranks so I hope to see more soon!
---
I just don't think it would be fair or fun for a lot of people especially console players having to face killers that excel with a mouse and keyboard. I'll admit it would be fun if you could do it with swf or something though or an opt in feature so everyone knows what they're getting into!
---
Agreed :)
---
People act like glitches and exploits are something that the devs know about beforehand but still release because they don't care enough to fix them, the point of reporting when you find a glitch or exploit that can be repeated is so that they know what's happening and how to fix it
---
I went full tryhard in a game, cause i had a huntress quest. After 4k 0repaired gens. A guy told me, you should play more toxic, instead of tryharding. That was kind of weird, but i took it in and began slugging people
---
Its all about timing and patience something alot of the survivors now these days need to learn course they may know how to do it but just act the way they are because this damn pip system makes it so you have to get rescues
---
I decided to show you... as a parting gift. Since this is the end, I'll fill you in. What you just witnessed and felt was you in the future. You from a few seconds in the past witnessed yourself in the future. This is my King Crimson's ability. I erased time and lept past it. I don't care who it is. I will not allow anyone to threaten my throne, no matter what. And now, you're going to have to disappear. Bucciarati, your mission to act as Trish's bodyguard has now come to an end.
---
‚ÄúSurvivors would say it‚Äôs balanced yeh‚Äù why I stopped watching him despite being a fan for three years summed up. 
---
He and his chat always rile each other up and start such divisive dialogues about dbd. Just when he was looking at the nurse he was going on for an entire video about something he didn‚Äôt think to confirm. And no- he didn‚Äôt correct himself to his audience later about it. So there are fans that would watch that video and make reactionary comments about how survivor biased the devs are, nurse is dumpstered, etc. No he isn‚Äôt inherently toxic through his gameplay, but I do think the discussions he starts often start divisive and toxic conversations. Thanks to behavior like this, most discussion on say, the forums is often name throwing and complains about how toxic and bad the other side that I don‚Äôt play is. Anyone who has anything to say about him is a reddit drone, too. Then ‚ÄúIgnorance is bliss as they say, *clears throat*‚Äù yuck.
---
They could just make two versions of the mori? Put a censored version and an uncensored version where countries allow it.
---
The hate between the mains is so real on this sub
---
*trapper panics as he tries to find more ice cream for Wraith to please the Entity.*
---
oof, my poor 135 lb frame :(
---
JuSt MeNd At A pAlLeT, you realize how dumb you sound right? Wraith can force it down using his speedboost or block you from dropping it and uncloak forcing you to use dead hard or try and run away. Your points are invalid, sure insta heals were annoying but were generally used wrong, and I didn‚Äôt have any problem with them when I was killer
---
The event itself will last the 11 days but you can get the vials for as long as the rift is alive and that‚Äôs 2 months. So it‚Äôs pretty much only the decorations and the extra points will go away after the 11 days
---
This Doctor can shock me anytime ;)
---
Should of tweeted it during the art contest or wait for the next one
---
Even with all those followers, his voice means nothing because he holds zero importance in this world.

Ah, yeah, I thought so too but I wasn't sure
---
Thanks for explaining!
---
Moonwalking guaranteed downs and was easy a 3 second speed boost isn't a counter. Legion was king of tunneling, forget spreading out the damage
---
Let the killer down you, or lead them to another survivor who may be more easily caught.
---
Terrible advice, but at the same time you're kind of asking for a solution to being good at the game.
---
Be bad.
---
We‚Äôre upset you‚Äôre glad he dropped his ice cream, not that ya hate him... well at least I don‚Äôt care if you hate him and only hate you for being glad he dropped his ice cream.
---
Im sorry do I hear the hottest two killers in the game? Thicc boi Clown and Slim thicc boi Legion? Im sorry but if I see those two I will gladly get caught and mori'd
---
sorry but no
---
Without being looked down upon? Are you serious? If I could post the hundreds of steam messages I‚Äôve gotten for using DS, Adrenaline, BT, and Unbreakable, etc... dude this whole sub would be filled with them. Hell I‚Äôve been mocked for using a full blown locker build! 
---
And another thing. Iri heads against a decent Huntress can‚Äôt be countered. Especially with the hitboxes being as shit as they are. So yes. Iri head Huntress can fuck right off. You‚Äôre correct
---
can we stop using the word "mains"?
---
I‚Äôm referring to how people are always saying killers should let the survivors run away so they get points. I see it all the time here, idk why everyone‚Äôs acting like it doesn‚Äôt happen.
---
r/lostredditors
---
If you ask me, the game should be darker wholly
---
Toxic players dont do gens buddy
---
For you my friend, I'll run it on prayer bead spirit, or Omega blink nurse.
---
Give medals in other categories while running from the killer. Kind of like what they did for lightbringer. Just with the other two.
---
You know how you move your camera to look around? Move the camera up and down will make you nod! :D
---
guys I‚Äôm surprised no one asked this, how will the terror radius work?
---
This is wrong. You get light ringer points for gens completed while being chased. Also the benevolent category has a starting value you you‚Äôll always have some points in there if you‚Äôre run for that[Emblem system for reference ](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Emblems)

[Holy shit you fucking killed ~~her~~ yourself dude!](https://youtu.be/9GSMdgoWPY8)

Use Self care with Botaly knowledge, you'll heal yourself in 21 seconds instead of 32 and others in about 10 instead of 16 seconds i think
---
Can it teabag tho?
---
What should we call them?
---
Lovely Icon Change, going to be swapping my galaxy perks for these!
---
I would assume your best chances were using trapper to shut down loops.
---
Ursula was terrifying!
---
Self care is fine. The two worst opinions I see parroted on this sub are self care is garbage tier and Ruin is overrated.
---
*laughs in DS*
---
If I see a survivor do that to me they get insta face camped.
---
I‚Äôm thinking either next anniversary(sucks I know) or just randomly throughout a mid chapter
---
David‚Äôs kinda hot tbh but all he really has is the shirtless outfit besides that he doesn‚Äôt have much. Lol you can prove me wrong if you want. üòÖ
---
I only let some people who I deem worthy go. Unless I'm hungry for bp or have another reason then I'll spare them if they did good.
---
I've been seeing a trend of pictures that just include Myers and that's it. Big props for actually at least trying to make it game-relevant with the title. This is how we got smol Billy guys
---
He deserves it for face camping me while spamming his bell :,(
---
God imagine being tied up topless on the bed with her straddling you
---
You should have specified that this was meant for the survivors
---
Skirt Legion (I don‚Äôt know any of the legion‚Äôs names) is the daddies daddy confirmed
---
You probs will safety pip and have no progression/regression on rank. It‚Äôs def a fun way to play the game and if the killer doesn‚Äôt bounce off of you then they‚Äôre just bad/mad...
---
Someone said to run to other teammates and have them get chased... this is called ‚Äúsandbagging‚Äù and it toxic, don‚Äôt do this ever.
---
What‚Äôs your rank and what system do you play on?
---
"OK now you save me."
---
\*running away\* "There's no time!"
---
Worth it
---
Damn why you gotta call him out. I‚Äôm also asking for a friend who wants to know
---
Staying alive for a long time is for the emblem at the end and it caps out at around 10 mins (I think) you don't get blood points for just staying alive in a match, and the only way a game would be endless is if every person decided to make it endless, if one person decides they don't want to sit there for as long as possible then they'll end it for everyone in the game eventually
---
Regardless of what I want - and to be honest I don't mind anything really - the last two chapters have been licensed so even if Pennywise is coming at some point I highly highly doubt he'll be next.
---
Wow, that easy? I did not realize this also translated to moving the head. Thanks!
---
Nobody, you can't really tell..there is many like me that get both killer and survivor at rank 1 in a  week or two without even trying too hard
---
If you mean streamers, imo Zubatlel is the best
---
Those two I my favorites as well. Ghost Face certainly has a more relaxed gameplay than Legion, but Legion's got a fun feel to him/her. Same with Doctor, he just feels fun to play. If you're thinking in terms of sheer efficiency though, Legion &lt; Ghost Face.
---
And, whichever killer you end up playing, don't be discouraged by p3 survivors and such. Survivors also make mistakes and it can really cost them. Just capitalize on those mistakes, and learn at your own pace.
---
I getting an error for all files.
---
You‚Äôre actually trash bro you are just a bad person stop playing we as a community don‚Äôt want you here
---
&gt; But there is a fictitious currency put in between them which is designed to detach the consumer from the direct dollar sign. This is a form of manipulation mobile apps use which has been proven to reduce reservations about spending large amounts of money on a virtual item that most sane people would feel is overpriced (eg $5 for a virtual sweater).
---
Except you still have to buy the currency in the first place, and you can see the price of the cosmetic and then buy the required currency and are fully aware of said price.
---
I can't wait for spirit 2 be nerfed
---
Thanks! ‚ô•
---
Win or lose every match ends with gg love ya
---
Do you think dead hard is useful?
---
Cute you just make assumptions about me to make yourself sound better. I play both sides since play 50% of the game sounds stupid and I'm sorry but only low rank killers use noed. I explained previously why and if you want I can show you the data from BHVR that shows nobody uses noed in red ranks and everybody use adrenaline. Welp, most of them at least
---
Balance wise I have a very solid idea but I guess when you're too bias and still think noed is a problem, you can't help it..
---
&gt;- a 50/50 survivor and killer that never used insta heals.
---
Again, like attacking me saying I play only one side and I'm low rank who use noed, it's just a way to make your ""points"" sound better. It doesn't, sorry. You still sound stupid whining about noed
---
It‚Äôs like the survivor version of what a P3 spirit said to me once, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt bring more than 1 toolbox or else..‚Äù LOL
---
Kinda true that they said they wont make a clown.   
---
We have a clown, but he doesn't really follow the traditional image of a clown. I mean he's just a fat dude with face paint what's there to be scared of... Now pennywise would count as a real clown, so I really wouldn't see him coming to Dead by Daylight.
---
Of course it is, it allows you to extend a loop a little more if used right, but to avoid getting hit you‚Äôd either 1. have to use dh, or 2. Run away and hope to make it to another loop
---
i don't blame him for taking an easy down lol
---
It's not that gen rushing is bad. That's what you are supposed to do. It's how fast gens are done.
---
I love it when they drop a pallet on you and start t bagging and then dc when they‚Äôre on their first hook
---
It would solve people DC‚Äôing to de-pip.  
---
Spend all your BP and report someone when you know you can‚Äôt play the next day.  Rank 20.
---
In red ranks you have to get at least 2 saves, do 2 generators, and be chased to get a pip. 
---
I only got chased, therefore didn‚Äôt get any other medals which de pipped me.
---
Do you think borrowed time is useful?
---
*laughs in being so unpredictable when dealing with nurse that I don‚Äôt even know what the fuck I‚Äôm doing myself*
---
***unzips***
---
Because you waste a hook, and you don‚Äôt get the points for the kill
---
$10 for a cosmetic is bullshit when compared to $7 for 2 characters (or $10 for 3 now that Stranger Things has come out.) But with that being said compared to other games like League of Legends where you can pay upwards of $30 for a single character skin that you can't even mix and match pieces of?
---
Yeah I buy the $10 skins too. Not all of them (some of them are pretty lazy ~~cough $5 for slightly taller hair for Adam cough~~) but most of them are genuinely high quality. I've bought a few skins for characters I don't even play just because I thought they were really good. I have the jean jacket for Adam, Kate's leather jacket, and the schoolgirl outfit for Spirit because I like all of them. I don't play Adam or Kate much and I pretty much never play Spirit, but still.
---
Is jason the survivor that has accepted that he won't be able to save the dude or did they do the custom match 2 killer glitch
---
I just threw up in my mouth a little
---
Does anyone know where I can find a picture of the entire cosmetic?
---
It really sucks dude. You also don‚Äôt get a lot of points from it too.
---
***the cover of my bible and starts praying***
---
you made assumptions about me first so you‚Äôre kinda dumb aren‚Äôt you lmao
---
The Mechanic one looks good and the black tank top i‚Äôll give you that but the others one are kinda underwhelming to me.
---
True, but if the killer drops you, you're in the dying state. That's the logic behind it: getting grabbed by the shoulder means you are only 4-5 minutes from death, whereas getting slashed in the back by a huge meat cleaver means that you can, concievably, bleed out infinitely (unless you get slashed again).
---
That's a very good way of putting it.
---
Hope it tasted good. &lt;3
---
Love a good Myers in Wawa
---
The only game ik where troll mindgames at this level exist. Lol
---
Both
---
Seems like you‚Äôre just a baby DBD player
---
Jake is a little out of the loop he just discovered planking and wanted to be a part of the meme
---
Incredible.
---
Most of the Rift challenges aren't that bad from what I've seen. They're no worse than Daily challenges. If anything most of them *are* directly lifted from daily challenges. (Be chased for [X] seconds, Do [X] amount of gens, Hook [X] amount of Survivors, damage [X] number of gens...)

EVERYTHING IS TOXIC

YOU BOOTED UP THE GAME YOU
---
TOXIC PIECE OF SHIT ILL MAKE YOU PAY
---
No real reason in particular just it works with being injured.
---
bUt We AlL rEaDy HaVe A cLoWn??!?!?
---
True.
---
Then again, to buy the premium pass, plus all 70 tiers, is 8000 Auric Cells. 
---
Given most outfits cost 1080 AC each, you can get 7 full outfits and have 440 cells left over.
---
For that, you get 6(?) outfits from the premium path and another 3(?) from the free path, plus a bunch of charms.
---
Oh, and you get 1000 AC back, so it's actually decent value.
---
That is absolutely what tunneling is - you have four people you could chase but you are intentionally focusing on the same injured person to get a faster kill.

Commenting for later hearing
---
So why put it in then if it serves no purpose?  
---
Because it does serve a purpose, firstly because of what I said above (that's not conjecture btw it's a proven strategy). Additionally it's a way to make people buy a little extra than what they need - 400 cells required, 500 minimum buy.  
---
Which leaves a little left in the account which is designed to make consumers both want to spend that little bit they have left or they feel like it's being wasted, requiring another purchase. Or seeing a new cosmetic and thinking 'I have 100 towards it already! it'll only cost 200 more and I have enough!' \*insert additional purchase\*  
---
You miss out on this manipulation if you do a direct dollar to purchase style store.
---
Now i just wanna be cuffed to my bed :(
---
I'm on ps so I can't even change them but this is the first icon pack I've seen that's really nice and I'd use, really well done!
---
1 minute can be a decent amount of time in this gm u know, I understand countering tunneling but I‚Äôll down 2 different people and then down the unhooked guy and get d-striked, I feel it could be better if they lowered the time but didn‚Äôt add obsession to it so killers always had to worry about it even if there‚Äôs no obssion so they would stop tunneling
---
oh hey nice picture that I totally didn't make and allowed you to use lmao (I am his friend btw)
---
10/10 protecting my dude
---
Well they're either mad and not thinking about it.
---
or they just don't care about bloodpoints and since they're dead anyway it's quicker to leave - This is especially true when the killer wants to slug the last guy to deny hatch.
---
Bubba and the nurse go on a date, and Bubba orders the chicky tendys. 8 of them.
---
Except the killer main wouldn't say sorry, more like "Shut up you toxic bitch"
---
Hold on that last one i feel is calling me out a bit
---
You're acting like they weren't planning that. There was no luck involved.
---
Obviously
---
A long time ago I had a guy point at a locker with a survivor in it. I facecamped him and let the other 3 go. Turns out they were SWF and just messing around.
---
Someone sells out teammates they get death.
---
Legend.
---
I usually see teabagging at the exit gate and if teabagging the killer has some kind of positive connotation, no one has ever told me. If I had a good game as survivor and I'm waiting at the exit gate, it's to let the killer get a free hit before leaving.
---
You're totally right.
---
That's how the ban system works in DbD. If you dc 40%~ of matches after x time (3 months I think) there's a wave of bans. Of any kind, cheating, DC and so on. So that's why they abuse this so much, because before be eligible for a ban you have to dc A LOT
---
Any other game ban you for like 5min? Some for 10 or 15 min for the first time and isn't a big deal. If you keep dcing the time grows till you get few days bans. But, survivors (they are the people who DC more) Everytime you bring up this argument they whine
---
Some are even proud to dc against something they don't like or if the game doesn't go their way. That's very sad because they are able to and have no repercussion, this make the spoiled and entitled. Idk why BHVR never did anything against this but I guess money &gt; good experience. Banning them, even for 5min, would make them upset and they won't do that would they?
---
Really love the attention to detail here! I hope you do more in the future!
---
Bruh, Doc lookin' like a whole meal. Funny how he's thicker than huntress, nice touch
---
No. tunneling is toxic. going for the obvious choice is not. not going for the injured survivor when the rest aren't is the logical choice. you'd be shooting yourself in the foot if you did anything else. after all, the sounds healthy survivors aren't much. quite easy to hear, and thus chase, injured survivors though.
---
You‚Äôre right I agree, but he goes on like a child. He perpetuates that victim complex that so many people in this community love to cling onto. It‚Äôs seriously weird. He‚Äôs a grown man, stop acting the victim at literally any opportunity.
---
This is if you grind the tiers, not buy them?
---
I have to assume it's because streaming is his job. I rarely play killer anymore and I get frustrated playing as a rank 10 killer.
---
Pretty woman leatherface or we riot
---
Commenting for later viewing due to slow ass school internet
---
When you get tunneled you are the only survivor who is playing.
---
r/foundthesurvivormain
---
Love it :)
---
Dead by Daylight community unironically complains about literally nothing. Like it's actually comedic how, given a big list of issues with the game (let's be honest this game is far from perfect) they choose the smallest most insignificant non-problem to whine incessantly about.
---
So let me get this straight. 
---
Borrowed time: after being unhooked in the terror radius of the killer, you can ignore your next hit. You think is useful
---
Dead hard: you can ignore a hit at any time. You think is useful
---
Reworked add on: you can ignore a hit at any time. 
---
But you think the add ok is useless? Btw I‚Äôve been here sense Leatherface, I‚Äôve played prework legion you twat.
---
Start off in the dying state and can‚Äôt be healed
---
HA! this guy is funny, like I'm ever gonna look at that nea over there with her purple flashlight, DS, Teabagging ass, and Head on and see a Human Being! Give this man an award
---
&gt; Evita Lima
---
I mean sure as a survivor only player... If you want to play more than 1 killer though...
---
Also this isn't a F2P game x)
---
crafting an iron pickaxe irl wasn't easy since i had to travel over 8000 miles to find an iron deposit but you know i had to do it üò§
---
I play spirit but to be honest the real entitlement comes from playing an auto win killer. I don't use ruin so I dont get dcs too often but it happens. Cant really blame them. It's annoying to put up with spirits, especially when they're good at phasing.
---
There's a free track that still offers a good amount of rewards. The premium track exists for those who want more and play the game more.
---
Funny thing, if it wasn't russian, you wouldn't mention his nationality, just call him toxic.
---
Ds, Flashlights, Head on and bodyblocking are not toxic.
---
Hah! From a 34 year old to another, lets show them little shits how its done!
---
True, ive been mainly playing survivor recently so been in that mindset
---
A quick look through the comments on this thread proves otherwise.
---
I'd like to see Pennywise in dbd, for sure. Also, Candyman. Because that bastard scared the shit outta me as a kid. Popping out of mirrors and walls, the bees, the hook and the pimp coat? Frightening.
---
I play 50/50 ( uneven but same ammount of hours aproxemetly)
---
And Both ain't good.
---
CAN WHITE WARD PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THAT IS HOLY WORK AGAINST FRANKLINS SO I DONT KEEP LOSING ALL MY PURPLE FLASHLIGHT TO CUNTS LIKE THAT?
---
Either way complete bullshit. Nothing sucks more ass than going through 30 bloodwebs spending BP for real-life days and FINALLY getting a Lery's offering because you want to do Mirror Myers, and some 4-SWF balanced landing flashlight squad burns a Strode key and you go to haddonfield instead. (IT'S ALWAYS FUCKING HADDONFIELD OR COLDWIND)
---
And bam. Offering cucked, potentially hundreds of thousands of BP down the drain. Pretty good job so far! 
---
It really needs to be changed so the killer offering trumps the survivors, or at least you get your offering refunded.
---
This is one of those vids that it doesn't matter how many times I see it, I still love it.

Haha sounds good! I might play Demogorgon later, at least people don't DC when they see me coming.. its still crap though.

Had the same thing happen once, killed three of them the first five minutes and clearly let the last one go and they sent me a part invite and started yelling ez, i said ‚Äúbut you all died‚Äù and they responded with something like ‚Äúhaha you wish‚Äù. I still don‚Äôt know what that was meant to mean.
---
Please
---
XD
---
As someone who has played both sides relatively evenly over the couple years since I first started playing, I feel like a lot of peoples complaints about toxicity stem from not knowing what it's like to play the other side, at least beyond like the first few ranks.
---
They should do as last years skins stayed in the store all year round and are still about :)
---
Neet. I want that Jake skin but not rn
---
Turn 360 and walk away
---
When they hear Spirit they D/C
---
When they hear Billy they say Oh Jeez
---
But when they hear Legion they say Reeeee!
---
Isn't that the whole point of these skins? I'm not trying to be a smart ass but these skins are for people who want to look cool, not really for people who want to be sneaky.
---
They could share a default terror radius and music.
---
Absolute horrid taste.
---
Survivors: funny j O k e
---
It‚Äôd be pretty cool but it‚Äôs already a game so I feel like that‚Äôd be difficult. But I would love to have Pyramid Head as a killer.
---
Mexican Shape
---
You are going to get Mori-do
---
That actually makes sense when you realize hook rescue parties exist with 3 survivors, imagine 5... I need a bucket... that concept sickens me... hurrp.!.!.
---
Then again if both killers run Save the best for last... oho... glorious!
---
Ah
---
Lmao. There's no need to be like that. Like, I get it spirit/toolboxes can be frustrating to play against, but they're not outright unwinnable. Especially not if you're a p3 spirit lol.
---
People are forced to play stealthy with Spirit which they don't like, I'm pretty good at phasing but in certain instances I'll stop phasing and just chase normally. But survivors arent always expected to win, just like how killer wont always get 4k. I guess people's opinions of winning are different, but just disconnecting upon seeing a certain killer is shitty.
---
I loved it‚ù§‚ù§,  the huntress head piece is a total YESüòç! And also, look at Doctor bottom, i would tap that (#NoHomo of course). If this comes to the game i will definitely buy it.
---
Good thing our survivors don't have her asthma problems.
---
You really making this about nationality? fuck off. I mentioned it because it was the only thing I could gather from their user, that and in the little time I've played killer it's been russians who are toxic
---

^ This. They'll be available in the in-game store after the Rift closes.
---
I swear every complaint I see for the Battlepass is rendered mute:
---
* "B-But muh premium content in a $20 game!" - There's a free path on the Battlepass.
---
* "B-But muh $10 to unlock content!" - It's the same price as a premium skin and you get like 5 premium skins. You also get your Auric Cells back so...
---
* "B-But muh gated content!" - The cosmetics will be available in the store after the fact.
---
* "B-But muh grind!" - This game doesn't already have a grind? Also you can choose to buy the pass whenever you want and henceforth only choose to get it when you get all the premium rewards. Also again: all the cosmetics will be available in the store if you don't want to grind.
---
The only complaint that's really "valid" is the "b-but muh psychological manipulation! I watched Jim Sterling once and he said video game bad!" Yes I do agree that there is evidence of the Skinner-box carrot-on-a-stick tactics with a Battlepass, but it's not like Behaviour chose this business model with the sole intent to psychologically manipulate its playerbase. This much should be evident by all the ways they've implemented to circumvent the Battlepass. At the end of the day Behaviour needs to make money, and no the cost of game sales and DLC sales isn't enough when you're trying to fund dedicated servers. This is an option to support the game and it's entirely your choice to take it. No one has a gun to your head forcing you to buy the Battlepass.
---
Me dud, check out yt.

i support hong kong but this ain't the right place for that

Yeah I like Tru3, but he's overly dramatic and definitely needs to take a step back sometimes. I can see why people wouldn't like him, but he doesn't need to be vilified. He hasn't done anything objectively bad as far as I know.

is this really the place to spam anti-china posts?
---
Spirit isnt always autowin, I've lost before. But if people just rage quit that just screams entitled to me, regardless of what killer it is.
---
I think in team fortress they worked around that by shrinking the missing bodyparts. all you need to do later is to add something to cover the weird looking neck.
---
Second wind really annoys me when the killer decides to slug me.
---
I wish it would carry over to when you get up or if it works differently.
---
Yea but he isn‚Äôt a cosmic being which is what Pennywise is, it‚Äôs stated as well that his real enemy is the turtle or creator of our known universe, who he sees as an equal, while we are all just toys
---
Well the thing is that you shouldn't have to sacrifice playing the game to wear the outfits. They're very well designed but unless you're the kind of survivor who runs loops like a god and doesn't care about being chased then you're just not going to be able to use them.
---
Ok, but how is this dbd related?
---
I mean, i get it, but really, just why?
---
Grab a quick hoagie, get stalked, get honked at in the parking lot, then go hit up Rita's for some water ice. 
---
I know how it goes.
---
That's not what a subscription is. You only pay once to play the game. You pay again if you want extra DLC. That's all there really is to it.

i had that experience recently, it was only towards the end anything actually got done

They are, and they‚Äôre fine to use, but they are all frustrating and unfun to be on the receiving end of.  Also, killers have to deal with them X4, whereas there‚Äôs just the one killer dividing their attention so for every tunneled or facecamped survivor there are three getting off Scott-free.  The frustration builds up more quickly on the killer‚Äôs end.  It‚Äôs a simple numbers game.

The french name of the Wraith is "Le Spectre", so Ghostface could absolutely be "The Ghost" (aka "Le Fant√¥me") since it doesn't overlap with The Spirit too

Clown aside, Pennywise is essentially the entity even down to how we see his true form (spider like being) it‚Äôs even likely Pennywise would be on a higher playing field since his only rival is the creator of our known universe of which he deems an equal (they live in a universe that surrounds ours and I believe were the only inhabitants)

#THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK!

Ye a lot of killers also feel that about facecamping.
---
A lot of survs also feel like flashlight clicking and tbagging at pallet makes you focus them and thus is a good strat.
---
You can spin anything to be a strat if you really want to, doesn't mean it's not considered toxic.
---
Same happens all the time lmao
---
Apologies, I misread your first comment where you said they scatter.  I thought you meant they were all right in front of you while you were at the hook.

Nah you just say you post it to reddit and then they get really defensive
---
I mean, the killer just lets them slide off their shoulder. If the survivor breaks out, the killer is forced to drop them, and they land on their feet in the injured state.
---
And yet it exists to be used
---
# deal with it, it‚Äôs in the game and the devs ain‚Äôt got a problem with it.

I wonder if she would step in the trap while she is phasing

Ah so that‚Äôs why i play Quentin, I‚Äôm *Tired*

Devs intended for us to use that addon so we allowed to use it
---
**also I don‚Äôt play huntress**
---
Huh. Maybe I should make a Huntress Minecraft skin next...
---
I love it
---
Please don't bring politics into DBD. We play DBD to have a good time and forget about stuff like this temporarily.
---
Nah I use Stridor on spirit. Its protection against iron will, the strongest perk against her. Why would I not bring it? Spirit is overpowered, period. Her mind games are heavily spirit sided.
---
I wish they‚Äôd make some official themes, I don‚Äôt use custom ones because I hate the default background music and silence
---
Mhm, that‚Äôs right.
---
I love this.
---
We tested that, she can phase right over them. When she exits phase on top of a trap, she gets trapped
---
Eh, it‚Äôs not really any different than Jason, Freddy, Leatherface etc. Just comes down to licensing.
---
2007/Rob Zombie Michael is my dream cosmetic - if not him in his hospital attire, then at least his mask and coveralls. It would be such a small but satisfying difference.
---
Ik this is a meme but, From what I have seen most people just complained about her addons
---
I just find it pretty common to see people blaming players from the other side with words like "Russian? Must be/obviously cheating/exploiting" and so on, while no one ever says - "Oh you are toxic? Typical American." or "You play like an asshole? Ha, typical whatever-not-russian."
---
One was dead on hook so I couldn't do much for her and the Dwight was sitting on the hatch so he got out.
---
Yeah I know he was only added 2 or 3 months ago, doesn‚Äôt really justify folks saying he‚Äôs not there though.  As a side note I‚Äôm really happy to see him added.  Dude looks dope af
---
It's hilarious, especially when the killers DC
---
For using an addon the developers intend for you to use? Great logic there! When the game isn‚Äôt how you want it, just ragequit!
---
# pansy, stay in the match and don‚Äôt bait the hatchet. That‚Äôs what I do.
---
You can out maneuver/loop/pallet me as much as you like, I‚Äôm going to get upset but, I‚Äôm not going to facecamp. However... if you teabag while doing so, best believe you have my full, undivided attention from now until your lifeless corpse is carried off into the sky.
---
Their argument is they don‚Äôt want to split the player base, my counter argument is just make it a special game mode that comes back every 3 or 4 months
---
Interesting. If a trap was placed on a demogorgan portal would that trap demogorgan?
---
Yes obviously
---
Love you bro
---
Well that sums it up nicely.
---
Research what? You subscribe to something in order to keep using its services, usually on a monthly basis. You don't have to pay bhvr anything to keep playing, you just buy the game once.
---
The "bigger picture" I see, is that old players finally have something to grind for now other than getting to rank 1 every reset. It's a good thing. And if you disagree? Speak with your wallet.
---
Yes fortnite popularized it. But that's not the reason why it is terrible. Same as loot boxes, that essentially encourage gambling in young children. Nothing to do with overwatch it is just shitty business practice that prioritises money over all else. Please try to see the big picture, and research into forcing committed playerbases into paying a subscription if they want to get everything out of the game.
---
I‚Äôve thought a 2v8 sounds awesome for a while, my only concern with it is wouldn‚Äôt it split the matchmaking up between traditional 1v4 and 2v8, making wait times for games even longer? I guess there‚Äôs the possibility of a playlist that allows you to hop in either game mode, but it just seems like this would have a somewhat negative effect on matchmaking; maybe I‚Äôm wrong.
---
Idk I'm relatively new both dbd and this subreddit
---
And yet the developers kept it in the game the way it is, so that means we can use it much as we want.
---
Alright thanks, sorry for the dumb questions. Never invested in a battle pass before.

Someday the dbd team will make all moris affect people's bodies (a reverse bear trap doesn't change a survivors head at all and it just looks weird when it goes off)

Honestly solidarity is better than second wind
---
They‚Äôre in the pass so people who tend to not spend a lot of money pay 1000 Cells for the pass. Complete it and collect 1000 Cells and purchase the next Pass with them Cells
---
The Devs are getting rid of insta down hatchets you moron, anyone who tries to justify this addon is a filthy tryhard who cant win with their own skill and just want easy wins, any competent killer will say that this addon is fucking busted
---
Good thing, that would be a nightmare lol
---
We didn‚Äôt put down Demogorgon‚Äôs portals because we thought they would just crash the game. I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be able to put a trap on a portal because they all count as killer items, and they can‚Äôt be placed close to each other. We did trap a demogorgon however, its hands and feet shrunk
---
You know I really dont understand the crying about tunneling and face camping I play both killer and survivor mostly killer only camp when gens are done for obvious reasons honestly what else can I do at that point but when playing survivor if I see a killer camping early on I run to the gens close to his area and just pop them off if you are being face camped do the sign raise your arms up and down on hook and by the time one survivor dies almost all gens will be done fair trade imo I have been the survivor on the hook to just try to help by not dcing killer still gets ahit on and most escape
---
Imagine being chased by tier 3 Myers while stealth mode ghostface is around the corner waiting to cut you off

Yea sure that‚Äôd be cool but your forgetting their making a dlc to make money and with pennywise they will make the most money.

Interesting,  that makes sense. What happens to nurse? Can she step in traps
---
See this is what makes me special, I play both killer and survivor and I hate playing against both.

Do whatever you want
---
Starts on the 25th
---
Tell me about it. I complained about the fact that Feng has like 2 skins since the release of the store and BOTH OF THEM (the ballerina and the new one) are on auric cells. Got downvoted.
---
That makes you no better than the toxic survivor tho so it‚Äôs just an endless cycle.
---
Yeah sometimes you lose. Like 1 game every 15? And that's probably bc I play nice with her. Shes overpowered. It's easy to play an overpowered killer and tell others to suck it up.
---
Peanits comments are valuable like dog's shit.

BHVR, if you‚Äôre not gonna make ‚ÄòHellraiser‚Äô DBD chapter, then at least give the Doctor goth BDSM cosmetic.

Her and the Hag can both step in traps. When this happens, they just freeze in place looking down, and they can‚Äôt free themselves. They just stand there, or in the Nurse‚Äôs case, she just floats there
---
Got a source for me to read?
---
I disagree with the first sentence but agree with everything else. I dont think you realize just how many bright and vibrant cosmetics there already are that basically say LOOK AT HOW BRIGHT. 
---
Not all cosmetics or cosmetic pieces are meant for super sneaky plays. Also the jake skin isn't even that bright in game, just look up a video and you'll see it'll probably never really increase a killer's awareness of you ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I agree, I think the community would basically demand that they don‚Äôt lose all the hundreds and hundreds of hours the poured into the game just to upgrade to a better version. I think if they were to do it they‚Äôd definitely need some kind of way to transfer your save. Knowing BHVR it‚Äôd probably be imperfect and have its share of flaws, but hopefully it wouldn‚Äôt be anything too noticeable.
---
I was playing with a friend who was new to the game, and he was uncomfortable being inexperience because he didn't want to let his team down. He's like, "all I can really do is complete generators." I'm like ... "you're already better than most rank 1 players."
---
Why are you calling me a twat? I‚Äôm having a discussion with you, that was the other guy you fool. And yeah, for the addon, you can ignore a hit for fifteen seconds. But then you have a timer
---
It's a HUGE advantage what are you talking about? Blendettes are so hard to track and, since I'm a Hillbilly main, they're nearly impossible to chainsaw in fields of grass/bushes.
---
I don't even use Ds and i don't main anything, i play both. That's the perk the majority of the players use to counter tunneling, not sure why you are calling me a survivor main?
---
It's not like you get that many chances to use it to begin with, I'd want to take the chance while I got it
---
Hey! As an ex Claudette main I must say I didn't do this and I still suck at flashlights
---
Okay so if you teabag after every pallet stun, you obviously have some complex to work out with your therapist but if you dip your chips once after a funky play or after a long awkward moment of eyecontact between you and the killer, that should be fine.
---
How is this unpopular? Isn;t like everyone hyped for the archives?
---
What‚Äôs P3? This is both a meme question and genuine question.
---
I want this!
---
That huntress looks so good. Good job man
---
&gt;i only camp hook if a survivor is **what I consider toxic**
---
The problem starts here. Each player has a different opinion on what is toxic. People think "gen rushing" is toxic so they camp. Pallet looping is toxic so they camp. Hiding is toxic so they camp. 
---
Ultimately, do whatever you want just don't try to find arbitrary excuses to justify it and make it less obnoxious.
---
I have to down-vote and report something I support and I hate it. This is not the place for that my friend
---
You don't have to break all pallets. You really only need to break safe pallets where trying to catch the survivor looping it would take way too long.
---
Oh shit, he's OG.
---
Dwights are super toxic, same with bloody Tapps
---
Thank you!
---
Ds isnt used by 90% of people nowdays, dude.

The second one I guess,

Damn I thought dota2 battle pass is the most mainstream one since it was the first one to implement the battle pass system onto its multi million dollars tournament. Just searched "battle pass" on google and dota2 is nowhere to be seen lmao
---
I don;t get it, if you don;t wanna pay, don;t pay, it's not like you need those cosmetics...
---
Hit detection is still run entirely on the killer's end, so if from their perspective they land a hit, it counts, and the server does no validity-checking or lag-compensating on those hits. This coupled with the fact that servers necessarily introduce more latency between any two players, the killer latency advantage has only gotten worse.
---
Here's a little drawing to demonstrate how servers add latency between clients: https://u.cubeupload.com/f0rlorn/server.png
---
In any case where the server is not located exactly in the middle between any two clients (very rare, and in a lot of cases impossible), the latency will be more than client-to-client latency. In the example of my drawing, for the P2P network, the survivor's inputs arrive on the host server (the killer's machine) 50 milliseconds after their creation, so the survivor on the killer's screen will be 50ms behind their actual state and location - the killer has a 50ms advantage. On the dedicated server network, the survivor's inputs need to first travel 50ms to the server, and then from there another 50ms to the killer - the survivor on the killer's screen will be 100ms in the past, and since the killer is still the authority on registering hits, the killer now has a 100ms advantage against the same player. Vaulted a window and ran two steps? Doesn't matter, 100ms ago you had just vaulted. Activated Dead Hard? Doesn't matter, 100ms ago you hadn't.
---
In regions where there is no data center, the latency introduced by the dedicated server network is actually severe: if for instance two Russian players connect to each other, their latency might be 40-50ms. But now they cannot connect directly to each other anymore, but have to communicate through a third-party server, located in Frankfurt. This can regularly take each player's data upwards of 80ms to arrive there. So they go from a 40-50ms connection to one that is often at least 160ms.
---
The servers need to be the authority on hit registration. If not running hit detection on the servers themselves, at least implementing lag-compensated hit validation. Then it would actually be a more fair environment, where both sides are affected by latency and the "advantage" either side has is only determined by their respective difference in latency to the server (so if both players have roughly the same latency to the server like in my examples, there will also be almost no lag advantage for either side).
---
But with how many troubles BHVR are having implementing dedicated servers to function acceptably at all, I highly doubt they will go and touch servers in such a fundamental fashion again, once they do manage to get them to function "well enough". Yet having the server be the authority on hits was *THE* reason why most people wanted dedicated servers to begin with, to improve hit reg, make it more fair...
---
You have crushed me
---
My personal experience, killer queue time is way too long. Instead of camping and looking at a hooked survivor, ending a game quick and then waiting 5 to 10 min for next game is way too boring. I will rather chase survivors endless trying different ways to get them. The point of the game should be enjoyment, killing and surviving both are fun. But camping is just way too boring and annoying for survivors as the one who is hooked cant do shit let alone enjoy. I am not saying killers should let survivor go, yes there main objective is to kill but not just one survivor or ruining a single survivir game. If they are having a hard game then camping just dont make any sense, 1 kill get you less bp. If you want to end game then fast then all 4 on gen can end faster than 3 on gen. Its like you are enjoying not at killing but making other mad and ruining there game which also increase toxic behaviour. A survivor dying after 3rd hook from a killer who got always got them without camping/tunneling and a survior who died at first hook because of camping makes a big difference in the enjoyment of a player. Well toxic survivors will remain toxic survivors and it does not matter if they die from camping/tunneling/fairly, they will always blame the killer for camping.
---
It's not over until you get every killer to P3 with all perks.
---
~~And just for the duration of the current chapter.~~
---
careful she is a hero
---
Wait what happens if a Killer DCs
---
I don‚Äôt think most people know that toxic players are usually just 13 year olds who think they‚Äôre funny, they have no power
---
Thats wrong. Higher medals are required at lower ranks.
---
No problem :)
---
I've never seen anyone pointing to OW when lootboxes are mentioned. Before Star wars, it was CS:GO, or rarely Tf2
---
It is used by everyone at red ranks, by every swf team, perhaps you are green rank idk
---
Also that doesn't take off the fact that it's amazing to counter tunneling
---
Haha, suck it up? Right.. Well I'm sure she'll get nerfed so everyone will stop crying, but I doubt it. You can't fix this community by saying something is OP and to nerf it. The dev's will eventually kill the game that way. Right now there's only a few killers that can handle red ranks, that's why you see so many Spirits. Seems to me like people just need to get over it, they'll nerf prayer beads w/e. But the change I want to see is people getting punished for DCing just because they aren't getting low tier killers. That's a whole lot of killers that'd need to get buffed, and yet people will still bitch OMG ITS TOO OP NERF IT. See a pattern? Nothing is ever good enough for people. I honestly don't care. I'll play who I want, when I want.. Just like anyone else will. ;)
---
They don't just get rid of a killers powers against survivors though. Nurse gets rid of 90% of what survivors use against killers.
---
hAtE?? 
---
hE wAs BlEeDiNg, BeGgInG yOu FoR mErCy
---
Because it was impossible to survive against a Nurse player unless they were baby
---
Now get matched against a plague and you're fucked
---
double the mixtape legion
---
If a killer starts tunnelling me for no reason, then t bag time hits HARD. I mean they‚Äôre being toxic, so I‚Äôll be it too :) Ran then for five gens then got camped :,)
---
Survivor? Anyone good enough, same level. The skill cap isn't high tbh
---
Killer? Ehhh depends, for example I think Zubat is really good, with huntress but with other killers is average. Depends on who they main
---
Something interesting about dbd is that both the killer and one player can get bullied in the same game while 3 remaining survivors win.
---
Actually lol'd
---
i want both of these sooo bad ugh. i love leather and latex. also the designs are cool as fuck. doc reminds me of pinhead in a way. and huntresss yaaas. üòç
---
Oh my god. I know this subreddit is totally killer sided, but this is like the most biased thing i've seen in a while. Imagine getting triggered by ITEMS and PERKS and FREE HITS. t-bag is not even doing anything. Sure, it's a disrespecting behaviour, but IT DOESNT DO ANYTHING.
---
And let me tell you something about (solo) surviving these days: Dealing with stacked slow-down-perks, so everything takes FOREVER. It's basically skill-check-simulator ADVANCED. Dealing with Prayer Beads, insta-saw and range-blink add ons over and over again. Teammates, that DC just because they got found first or don't like the killer they go against. Ha, tunneling and camping aren't the real problems at the moments, for sure.
---
And if you really thing killer have it so much worse- you are just a really bad killer. sorry. that's the truth.
---
ohhh, never knew that lol! Thanks!
---
Both are toxic and not good. Ever think about that?
---
Sounds like something the killer would say
---
Adam desperately needs some new ones. The shit he has now are either ugly (wtf is that fro with sunglasses), barely noticeable (lookin' a you head with an inch more of hair), or recolors of his original outfit.
---
As a legion main, I always get excited when i see a fellow edgy teen. Then I always get reminded that it is absolutely true that most of us are just shitters.
---
I agree with you about just getting stacks... When i play killer thats normally my main goal. lol Im on ps4 as well... So i get what you are talking about... At rank 1 most of the time you need those perks but its fun to do other shit sometimes.
---
It's 1 killer and i rarely see her lol
---
True
---
YES PLEASE. Myers look so bad in first person
---
"Fun and interesting" are both opinions. I find Legion very fun and interesting.
---
&gt;My joysticks are much more prone to breaking and becoming loose due to wiggling/turning them constantly.
---
Slowly move your sticks forming circles. Won't damage the pad at all, you don't need to move them left and right, just move it in circle slowly but steady
---
Im getting an archive corrupt error :(
---
Dude, if you keep your ds until endgame then you're invincible and can afford to take hits for your teammates, resulting in everyone getting out.
---
Don't worry too much and just play. If a videogame is giving you anxiety issues you might need a break.
---
Remove perk tiers BHVR pls
---
Aaaaalright buddy xD
---
Ok imagine something like this
---
‚Ä¢2v8
---
‚Ä¢U play killer with friend
---
‚Ä¢U pick a high presure killer, ur friend picks a low tier one
---
‚Ä¢one of their surv at least is a god at looping
---
‚Ä¢game starts, map a twice the size swamp (i gave killer mains a nightmare right now, and both of u start at diferent sides of the map
---
‚Ä¢ur friend finds the god loop dude
---
‚Ä¢he tunnels him the rest of the game
---
This is a simple scenario and one of the worst ends of the spectrum but if this happened, and its bound to happen a lot in 2v8 if u queu solo...
---
U ARE NOW IN A 1V7 IN A MAP TWICE AS BIG AS THE NORMAL SWAMP
---
GOOD FCKING LUCK
---
bruh i just play to win. the killer sets the game rules
---
That‚Äôs how all newcomers start! Welcome to the fog, and have fun.
---
If you get anxiety about playing a game i wouldnt play it. I have no idea why youd get anxious about not levelling up in a game
---
I can't pinpoint why people hate it so much. My guess is cause other games did it in a more predatory way. 
---
Even if it wasn't a fair price, 6 free cosmetics and $10 for 26 cosmetics + a bunch of charms and you get back all 1k cells, look at the $10 for a single skin they've done, or the paywall killers like leatherface where BBQ essentially has to be bought unless you want to wait another 7 weeks till it's back on the shrine.
---
People want to say this isn't worth, but neither are the $10 skins then üòÇ
---
I'm fucking crying how accurate this is. Dude has a lot of anger in him
---
Yeah probably gonna find something else to play in my free time until the bloodhunt
---
That's a stone pickaxe, just dig down smh
---
lets just end this here, this got really weird
---
Err yes the Killer has to spend 10 mins queueing to get a lobby then the survivors want to play the game and you just dc. Ruins everyone's fun
---
Yeah it's pretty ridiculous how hard it is to get what you want
---
I play the game for 5 days now and i dont know what the fuck teabagging is can someone explain?
---
Nice, I don't see many PS4 players! I'm stuck on rank 4 on survivor, too many matches with teammates throwing the match lol. I'd get frustrated and go play killer and it's still the same even on the killer end, people throwing the match.. Its getting to be really unfun altogether, seems neither side is fun for me anymore lol.
---
And at the end theres 8 dudes (if u are lucky and arent 9) being toxic to u
---
It's hard not to identify toxic Claudettes from people who just enjoy playing the character. If you bring a p3 Claudette with a flashlight, I'm bringing an Ivory Mori. Dont take it personally, it's just insurance.
---
When survivors are toxic, they teabag and click flashlights, which doesn‚Äôt really stop the game. Toxic killers that camp and tunnel do stop the game for at least one person. That‚Äôs why being camped sucks so much, because you‚Äôre basically done playing once you get camped. Don‚Äôt do it.
---
This post is toxic
---
*Avengers Theme Instensifies*
---
Game commercialisation strategies.
---
BP model is manipulation. We'll deny you content unless you pay over a period of time. And it won't be good value and will miss out on rewards unless you actually spend all your time on the game.
---
Any true player will have to buy it if the game goes in that direction, because they want to keep up. Its not as linear as 'just dont buy it'. Sorry I dont want to be locked out of new content behind a paywall.
---
The bigger picture behind the method of implementation. Obviously i'm not saying they should not give us content or something to work towards... it doesnt 'have' to be this way. It is though because it is the biggest money maker. As I said, research.
---
its soo sad how entitled people are in this sub, i totally agree with you. people should just fucking play the game. ffs i dont like going against stealth killers bc the jumpscares make me a nervous wreck but i just stick through it and practice playing.
---
Thank you for the reminder
---
Doc and a lot of killers, really. Doc and Nurse/Spirit/Huntress/Plague/Billy for the reason you mentioned. Doc and Pig for a super cancerous skillcheck build. Doc and Freddy for pallets. Doc and Legion so Madness can force a bleedout.
---
Walter
---
When you have a good unserstanding of how survivors move and behave whispers is very good, it loses power if you are against very skilled stealth players and if you are just looking sround when it goes off
---
Gen rushing is the correct strategy for survivors, but when I complain about it it's more that the max speed for survivors is allowed to be so high.
---
You should for sure keep doing it though.
---
Devs allow me to ‚ÄòLeave Match‚Äô so it‚Äôs allowed!!!!
---
Mind feeling me in on what this post was as OP deleted it before I got here
---
You just lie to win the argument, that's fine, wish you good luck ranking up lol
---
&gt; Honestly, a good description of nurse is, what if there was a killer that could just look at you and hit you.
---
If your description of her is accurate then why weren't there as many high tier Nurses as there are high tier players of other killers? If Nurse is so easy to win with, well damn near all high rank killers would be using her since players love to win more than anything. 
---
The answer is an obvious one - there isn't as many high tier Nurses as other killers because she is difficult to play, much less to master, and isn't easy to win with. A great nurse will wipe the floor with you, but there are few great Nurses. That more than evens out whether her base needed a neft. Most Nurses are either merely good enough to average 2 killers, or mostly poor due to lack of skill and/or controllers.
---
That BHVR has her listed in her description as "easy" says it all about how much SUCK at not just decision making, but SUCK at playing their own game, but also SUCK at understanding their own killers. I doubt there is even one good Nurse player on their entire staff. They haven't a fucking clue about how easy it is to play Nurse.
---
&gt; Nurse has always been the top of the top.
---
Because she has the highest reward for the highest skill cap. Not because she is easy to play and easy to master. The Nurse is not the prior Mettle of Man. She works her ass off, nothing is given to her.
---
&gt; The changes to her baskit aren't really that noticeable unless youve memorized her timings to the millisecond
---
3 seconds to restore each blink is not a milisecond. Having the restoration of another blink cancelled when you charge up one blink is not a milisecond. You're constantly waiting and letting a survivor gain distance away from you now, unless you use addons to speed the blink charging up.
---
&gt; and if thats the case, then you really just aren't open to any change.
---
Bullshit sir, no one would have been opposed to the addon changes we got. No one ever said Nurse should stay the same, and omega blinks and extra blinks were always said to be a problem. We just didn't want her base touched. And you KNOW that was the complaint about her.
---
&gt; Bringing her down is just making the game better 
---
For SWFs and the lower skilled of survivor mains. Not the game in general. The game in general has many issues, and SWFs have the biggest advantage of anything in the game bar none - not the Nurse. 
---
Wanna make the game better, bring down SWFs closer to the solo survivors to improve balance. But nah, that won't happen. So instead of focusing on what would better balance the game overall, focus on the lower hanging fruit - a killer who can deal with SWFs, who has the highest skill cap to boot. Lower her to appease SWFs and lower skilled survivor mains. Because it's been just so tough on them - the poor babies.
---
Meanwhile, at least 6 killers can't compete constantly in the red ranks. Let's not take care of them first.. nah.. let's nerf the best killer first. That's some sound decision making there. 
---
"The House is unstable, what do we do now?" 
---
"Let's lower the roof."
---
"Shouldn't we improve the foundation first?"
---
"Trust us, we're professionals."
---
"You're fired."
---
&gt; Shes still visible and top teir too.
---
It hasn't hit live yet. My guess is a previously great Nurse will still be at least a good Nurse. And a previously good Nurse will still be at least a good Nurse. And a previously average to bad Nurse will become a Spirit main.
---
*sad bing bong noises*
---
A killer was once merciful to me when I was playing Ace and the killer wanted me to escape but I refused to leave and they watched me die to the endgame collapse and they said why didn't you escape I replied with "you need the BP I don't"
---
We need more people like that killer that isn't a toxic bitch but was merciful when my teammates were trying to get me killed for playing Ace
---
yeah
---
Never seen a toxic Dwight. Seen really REALLY good looping Dwight's but almost never a single tbag from them
---
just because you can‚Äôt remember something detail for detail doesn‚Äôt make in not iconic.
---
I wanted to use Pharmacy in my Plunderer's build... Nore more(
---
It's not good for Plunderer's anyway. I could get Ranger Medkit, Key, Rainbow map (i love it). And with pharmacy i will get a one use medkit now.
---
Wish they made it so if you are to take yellow or lower rarity item, you would get Emergency medkit instead (1 time).
---
Explain to me how is hitting a skillcheck easy to counter, i'd really like to know lol. They can't hook you for a minute and you can use Unbreakable if they leave you on the ground
---
if pixels make you this mad I don‚Äôt know what to tell you my guy
---
You have to relearn your perks through the bloodweb...
---
RIGHT?! That's a huge reason why I love Spirit, I'm a big nerd on Japanese horror lmao. I love the stealth killers the most, Love Pig but man.. I like to play to spook people and have fun but I guess people want to yeet out of the game. Main reason why I am main killer is to get those BBQ stacks, the grind is hardcore:(
---
Looks awesome üëç
---
Fast crouching to taunt killer
---
He's getting a rework soon so I'd definitely wait until that happens. He only has one solid perk but his others need to be on a specific build or killer otherwise they're not gonna help you
---
That's not how it works. At all.
---
Prestiging gives you bloody clothing and a small chance at rarer items in the bloodweb. Levels 30, 35, &amp; 40 give you "teachables". So let's say you're playing Claudette but you want Self Care available to everyone. You get her to the respective level to unlock it (or use the shrine alternatively) and it becomes available to use across all Survivors ***when found in the bloodweb***.
---
This is definitely an instabuy for me
---
Ikr it feels like its almost been an hour, i was starting to worry.
---
Thank you!!
---
It was about the Hong Kong protest
---
I upvoted his reply too.
---
Dwight in the locker
---
She stood there the entire game but I left soon to go get gens and free points
---
Ah I see thanks for letting me know
---
Freddy and Demogorgan
---
Two teleporting killers, so much map control and while you‚Äôre running from one killer another can pop up right in front of you if near a portal or gen
---
Same here!
---
Thank you! Oh I love leather and latex design too, so sexy and dangerousüñ§üî•
---
Because I want to get grinding out of the way so I can finally chill out and have fun playing the game
---
Uber Jason never
---
YES!!!
---
That's just how entitled survivors are now. If they are up against a killer that they cant easily loop and bully they will DC.
---
People who weren't potatoes just wanted omegablink removed. But as usual, BVHR overdoes it.
---
They really need to sit down and chat with the cosmetic teams. Like wtf were they thinking with the Jake, Nea and Meg outfits?
---
&gt; no clown 
---
&gt; no non-human killer
---
I don't think we need to take these as solid rules.
---
People just told you, that playing against spirit is not fun. You want fun, survivors want it too. And they don't care what you want :D
---
Depends on the rank you are playing, in low ranks its a useless perk, on high ranks you get slugged pretty much every game.
---
bro, you've missed over a decade of gamer culture, what rock have you been hiding under?
---
Yeah, that's definitely true. I'm decent with Spirit but not all that good,  so it makes me aggravated when 2 people yeet out just from seeing me. I guess I should just stick with playing Freddy or Hag, the two killers I can play really well.. but I'll get dc's on them too.. You cant win :(
---
Honestly one of the most stupid comments I've seen in a while.
---
Simply for the fact that you generalized it to pixels
---
Well said mate
---
I totally agree, it‚Äôs a damn shame
---
You‚Äôre not wrong
---
Do whatever I don‚Äôt do it cause well it‚Äôs a waste of my time
---
Fucking ‚Äúthe sickness sister‚Äù
---
Bond is useful if you're playing solo. SWF kind of makes it a waste of a perk slot since you can vocally communicate with each other what is going on.
---
I was actually just at a Ford factory and the first thing I thought of was a 2v8. The Ford facility I was at is 600,000 acres!
---
Exactly.  I agree
---
I know right :(
---
Ha! You guessed it right. For the most part anyhow.
---
I think if you get upset over someone tea bagging to the point where you're weiting a paragraph over it, you might be the one with an issue
---
Do people actually do that? I just use crouching to hide in tall grass
---
I think we found the winner of the award ‚Äúbest fucking teammate ever‚Äù
---
I'm a rank 1 Spirit. I think when you get higher ranks people DC less. I haven't had someone DC on me for a while, even with prayer beads. But you should keep playing the killer you want to play. Dont let the survivors dictate who you play.
---
yeah the grind is a lot easier playing killer. spirit is fun to play, i just played against one and we had a great game (me and 3 randos not even swf). people who say she has no counter play dont use good perks like spine chill. she has counters lol they just need to git gud but you know how people are in these kind of games. make them have to learn a different way to play and they freak out. i think its cool having to change my strategies depending on the killer.
---
Some people just enjoy being assholes
---
I have the word tea bagging in my name even though I never do it. It‚Äôs gotten me tunneled and face camped every now and then :(
---
Not even a toxic survivor. I just like having my name as tea bagging t-pain@the tea party.
---
Original comment. Stop encouraging terrible business practices.
---
You don't like content locked behind a paywall? That's 70% of this game. Plus, DLC has been a thing since forever. You've always been charged for extra content in paid games. Sometimes it locks you out of shit that is more than cosmetic, but actual gameplay. But this is purely cosmetic. And quite a reasonable cost for it, all things considered.
---
If you're a business, it does have to be this way. We're not entitled to free shit because we've played the game for awhile. We've had to pay for content for the entirety of this games life. A game 3 and a half years old and still popular needs a way to make money to stay afloat.
---
He a little confused but he's got the spirit
---
Of course they don't care what I want lol, even when I'm spinning in circles and smacking random objects because that's funny to me when I whiff. I get DC's against any killer I can play really well, so meh. Am I supposed to play like a sausage all game? I just want my stacks lol.
---
Struggling on Xbox for me is the A button. Wiggling first me I just turn my analog stick in a clockwise circle. Really not that big of a deal lol
---
Spending a minute a half ensuring one person dies and never checking any gens is not the best way to slow down gens.
---
Killer who complain about gen rush either facecamp or don't know when to leave a chase.
---
Nice try wraith &gt;.&gt;
---
Probably just getting a good look at the HD skins that have been coming out for survivors, its 95% of the reason killers camp, theres no other way to fully appreciate red glasses beard dwights high ress model
---
What‚Äôs with so many people defending or at the very least okay with people dc‚Äôing?  This community is really weird sometimes.  Sure it‚Äôs tough to play against, but man up and tough it out.  You‚Äôll come out better by just playing than you would by just dc‚Äôing.  This is coming from someone who plays both, but plays survivor at least 5 times as much as killer.
---
Amen üôèüôèüôèüôè
---
Playing survivor mainly taught me that they even act like morons toward each other.
---
I always use Second Wind with We'll Make It. Doesn't work all the time because for some reason if you start healing someone and a person comes in to help you heal that person, it doesn't count as a full heal.
---
thanks for proving my point
---
What's wrong with Iron Maiden?
---
That true...  some matches I‚Äôve had it felt like I was battling both the killer and some teammates
---
Congrats, welcome to the fog. You will suck for a while. Roll with it.
---
New cosmetics leaked
---
Buy leatherface for bbq, it will never be in the shrine again its already been in it twice
---
ive been playing a couple weeks now and still get scared a lot üòÇ welcome to dbd, enjoy your endless stay at the campfire and good luck in the fog! üéÉ
---
I actually wanted to play it for a long time but im just 13 and i was saving money for over a year to buy a gaming pc and the first game i bought was dead by daylight and i fucking love it
---
Uh huh. What, specifically, was your point?
---
Thank you! I got so frustrated earlier I stopped playing for a bit. I got the Spirit Halloween skin and wanted to show it off, I'm not using her body piece though.. Just the head, weapon and the red robe.. It looks scary XD Maybe I scared people with the cosmetic and they DC'd out of fear. lol
---
Why are you booing him? He‚Äôs right!

thanks, but i dindt lie though ;-;

Lmao ayeee I got the skin too.
---
You are literally showing entitlement for a pair of pixels. Why is it that you should be the only one deserving of that skin? because you were online some days others couldn‚Äôt be? because you had more free time than someone else? if it‚Äôs just a skin and you had nothing to do with the creation of it why should you feel entitled to be the only one with it.
---
Devs allow you to slap me so it‚Äôs allowed.
---
*wInK wInK*
---
if you cant play and have fun without maxed out perks youre playing wrong imo. maybe practice with no perks at all?
---
With the permanent sabo'd traps during the height of the Sabo Meta with the also permanently sabo'd hooks lol.  I know back then you could set traps directly underneath hooks to prevent saves so I think they probably just did that to anyone they managed to down.
---
In more ways than one
---
The game Does have a lot of grind but they are adding more ways to get BP and more scoring events. 
---
That said, take a break.
---
I like that too, I try to rotate out killers. I've really been enjoying Demogorgon! Hes a good boi haha.

Okay, we get it. He complains and cries too much, but why are you guys so obsessed with bringing him up everywhere? I 100% agree he complains too much, but I just ignore it and watch the gameplay, and a lot of his complaints are completely valid just repeated waaaaaay too much. His clickbait is annoying as hell too, but who doesn't do it? You guys seem to have a wet dream bringing him up in every thread.
---
Yeah. Goth. Sure.
---
Unlock token? This isn't CoD that's not a thing idk where you got the idea...
---
To be fair, If you look at Clowns Cosmetics, then he very Much is a Clown.. And Santa Claus as well..
---
This right here. Nothing but a bunch of dipshits parroting dumbass opinions. You can tell someone gets all their opinions from Reddit when they spew that *^self ^care ^in ^2019 ^LOL* meme.
---
Self Care is plenty useful. Completing partial heals, restoring yourself to full (and pulling off rescues) in the event of dead/escaped teammates, escaping the Dream World, baiting Nurse's Calling, goddamn.
---
Nice!! I love how she looks like a demon. Such a nice cosmetic.
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
It's worth noting that it's useless against Myers at tier 1, not the entire time. If you don't know where he is but he's stalking you from outside terror radius to get to 3 it'll light up still
---
Because BHVR doesn't take the game that seriously. Legion is just some person saying, "Hey know what we don't have? A killer that uses a thousand cuts!" And nobody knew that idea is not compatible with how the game works for like a dozen reasons until PTB.
---
Bug maybe?
---
Stop tunneling and you won‚Äôt ever get hit with DS
---
"The Sentient Cent"
---
Yeah man. Why do you think this game has so many people lusting after Myers? They relate to that icon of evil.
---
You're gonna get a Twitter post made about you now.
---
As a huge fan of the first two movies I can tell you that you captured the essence perfectly
---
Thank you sooo much! You‚Äôre too kind :,)
---
And statements like this are contributing to the problem
---
My heart rate raises with the killers heartbeat
---
you get rewards for playing, what‚Äôs wrong with that? it‚Äôs better than lootboxes, and if you really just like one thing u can direct purchase it after.
---
wow, someone with a spirit flair is being a condescending cunt, imagine my shock
---
Yup

I like how you're getting downvoted for being positive, and not toxic.

Leaked entity footage

I have played spirit at rank one. My first time playing the killer since she came out I would 4k almost every game. Just bc you can't see the survivor doesn't mean you don't know where they are, you have so much info given to you when the survivors don't even get to know if you are using you're power or not.
---
I hate Spirit. I‚Äôll DC against them every time. Don‚Äôt even care about the hate I‚Äôm about to get. Me and my friend will just DC together. OP, two of those were probably me and my friend LMAO.
---
Okay, in the meantime, I made this mori music a while ago. It‚Äôs not much but may interest you!

I'm sorry if it wasn't obvious, I'm not a fanboy. I am mocking him.

Last time I saw a tweet, it was something like this. And it was a response to something as minor as a meme about him. This is how he reacted, saying he's being attacked and laughed at.

Lmao dude I hate survivor mains like that, they just can‚Äôt adapt and it‚Äôs fun cuz they whine about it in every single post of this community I‚Äôm tired as well

Oh does he also shoot fucking overpower brimstone beams everywhere with his fucking eye balls what the fuck theu never fucking add the bloat I fuckin swear i will kms
---
thank you, I plan on it :)
---
I don't think that was a defense of him.
---
If its a high rank player willing to DC, odds are they don't care about the points since they probably have most things that they want already unlocked. They're most likely just trying to have fun, and Spirit is not fun, hence the DCs. Sucks but I get it, I hate playing Spirit as a solo player.
---
So low its not worth it is the answer.
---
I see, then you‚Äôre the better player. I‚Äôm sorry for wasting your time
---
I mean if stranger things offers you a license you will go and screw your rules.
---
The clown one however...yes
---
You know its pretty funny tho... My team did a spirit build when fixated came out...  and spirits were dcing against us. We were rocking Fixated, Spine chill, Iron will, and Urban. Never seen so many killers pissed... The truth is it sucks for both sides when you have a really shitty chance at winning. When your power is useless, thats why when im Ghostface i dc when there is OOO. Its no fun to just be watched all game and be broken out of your power From the top of the Disturbed ward when you are trying to stalk at shack... When we could see our scratch marks and make no noise spirit has no fun because Unless you are a really good spirit you dont have the indicators to lead you to people. I used to main spirit it was the first killer i got to 50 and i was very proud... Until I played other killers and realized how much of a challenge it was to get Wins with killers like myers. It made all the shit i did with Ren feel cheap.
---
The psychology of it is a nightmare. So gross.
---
I see all of your points. The add ons she perviously had need to be changed, thats what every one wanted. Her base kit changes were not quite as warented. 
---
But saying that because shes not in most games and isnt dominating doesnt mean she didn't need to be brought down from when she can absolutly dominate. 
---
Take Bayoneta from smash 4, differnt game, I know but look at what happened with that game. 
---
Bayonetta want winning smash tournaments, but that wasn't because she was bad, it was because no one at the top level wanted to play her. At the lower stages of the tournaments, she dominated. People stopped playing competitively in smash 4 because unless you were a very good you couldn't beat her. Bayonetta never got the nerfs she deserved, and it killed the game. 
---
 Point is, even though she didn't win many tournaments, she still killed the game for many people.
---
In all honesty nurse is the same, the best are great and make people not want to play the game. Mabey nurses power needs a ful redesign. Maybe not freddy level, striping away everything that makes the character who they are, but enough to bring more players to play nurse so we can truly see how op she is. 
---
Also, you can't pull that whole
---
 &gt;It hasent even hit live yet
---
(The PTB to ful servers) because you wrote an entire ARTICLE about how bad Behavior is doing her before it
---
&gt;Even hit live yet
---
Lol, well I guess.. But why be particular on certain killers? If you came across any other killer that's really good no matter the tier are you going to DC? That's the biggest problem. And its why I won't play survivor anymore.
---
That most people who complain about getting tunneled are probably toxic teabaggers who deserved it.
---
You're refusing to acknowledge the points I made or just playing dumb. I'm going to buy it regardless, that doesn't mean that I cant say it is a scummy business model. 
---
The dbd one is more reasonable but it is still bad and a cash grab. BPs actually have demotivational effects on playerbases.
---
No it definitely doesn't have to be this way. But from a business perspective, they are laughing. The rest of your points kind of contradict eachother.
---
Either way. Im not saying this because im not going to get it or that im especially angry about it. It is just facts. You can either choose to see it or not. But these memes acting like a BP is gods gift are childish and generally piss me off.
---
It's almost as if the killer is the power role or something. Nah, that couldn't be it...
---
The Candy
---
The Man
---
The Hooker
---
The Token
---
Yes, it's definitely their fault, they deserve it. The survivor didn't get hook dived at all, or ran into a locker, or jumped on a gen. 
---
Meanwhile, people who join in and are playing the same survivor obviously means they're swf, so they deserve an Ebony Mori.
---
&gt; just a fat dude with face paint

If they did imagine the killer que 
---
I can‚Äôt spell.
---
Many survivors do this. They think there is a rule, that you have to chase him if he want it. And if you do, and you get him, then he will be mad (9 times from 10). Just laugh on him hard.
---
I still don‚Äôt own pig but I want in on yalls wholesomeness

SMH, not even using insidious üò§
---
320 games is nothing for a neckbeard like me üòé
---
I would hope so, spirit mains don't even play the game, they let the game play itself
---
I never expect much for reddit. I'm never disappointed. It's some sort of optimistic pessimism (it makes sense...I think)
---
"The Animals"
---
"The Hound" or "The Rabid"
---
Honestly "The Count" isnt that bad
---
Only 2 of those are the killers fault. Lagswitching isnt even a game mechanic. You also have several get out jail meta perks to counter it.
---
Freddy I agree 100% on like seriously he has a fucking purple add on that gives hemorrhage for 60 seconds LIKE WTF BHVR
---
and you think the psychology of lootboxes is much better? trust me, I‚Äôm a firsthand example of that bs in csgo. It goes from case opening to straight up gambling real quick. and besides, there‚Äôs not even an exclusive ‚Äúget it now or u can‚Äôt later‚Äù aspect because they literally will be available later. It‚Äôs just playing to earn rewards, and objectively I think it‚Äôs a step up from the shit we‚Äôve seen in the past few years.
---
head on isn‚Äôt either lmao
---
DUDE SHUT UP MATHIEU IS GONNA BAN YOU FOR LEAKING THE MORI
---
Well I mean you shouldn't buy it if you ain't gonna finish it or don't play alot, for people like myself that plays the game every single day it adds something to do and makes playing more then just oh do gens or get kills now we have very unique challenges to do to progress through the pass also I mean even if you don't pay you still get free stuff so it's a win win in my eyes.
---
Holy s--t this could be the Entity's worst nightmare
---
Because like other people said, Spirit is absolutely the most atrocious thing besides Ghostface and Legion. People will come at me and say ‚Äúgit gud‚Äù and ‚Äúlearn to mindgame.‚Äù I can mindgame some killers and not others, but Spirit...there‚Äôs just something about Spirits that aren‚Äôt fun. And I won‚Äôt play against them. I‚Äôll take new Freddy and stealthy killers all DAY compared to Spirit.
---
Ohhh, okay; Thanks- I'll go look
---
^big ^tiddie ^huntress ^gf
---
Nobody is acting like its God's gift. This post we're on is just suggesting it's not as bad as people like you wanna make it out to be.
---
And nice man, that's a good way to stand against something you don't like. Buy it anyways, and complain about it in Reddit anyways. Cheers.
---
Oink
---
Theres a lot of spirits bc nobody is willing to actually learn how to run the tiles. Nobody even plays Billy anymore and hes been viable since way before all the surv nerfs. Why play a 2king killer when you can 4k easily every game and get a ton of points? You play how you want, just dont come to reddit and beg survivors to stop dcing or suiciding against you then lol. 
---
Sincerely, a Myers, Hag and Spirit Main.
---
They basically want to be able to control when and how they get downed by hitting a skill check. Maybe if decisive was base kit, and happened on every down, they'd finally be happy. Bring the downvotes.
---
Really would like to know the steps. 4 months is to quick
---
You do you bro... killer kills survivors survive... if standing still for 3 minutes gets you off have at er
---
Have you tried Demogorgon? He's really fun, I like how he yells when he downs someone lol. Honestly I'd really like going up against that build, I play Spirit the most because I like facing challenging people. I get a shit ton of DC's on Hag too. Ghostface with someone using OoO is ugh... But hes becoming undetectable soon along with Pig and Myers! I hope OoO won't work against him anymore.
---
i didnt think that was something he said lmao. It looked like some passive aggressive snarky redditor defense of him. wow thats hilarious.

We're either 100% professionals or Pure Shit‚Ñ¢.

Dude I legit made this outfit yesterday XD
---
What about captain hook first?
---
So wholesome.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
When I realize I'm up against someone playing a really OP killer I just admit defeat and focus on trying to farm shards, that's the only way I've stayed sane playing this game lol.
---
lmao yeah
---
Identity V already have this mode, and in their 8v2 mode, survivors have to do 7 ciphers
---
Kinda hard since all I play against Tryhard killers and swf when I play killer
---
Also the last 2 steam sales allowed you to earn credit to earn the dlcs free. I got half of my dlc free.
---
Weird. I just heard HybridPanda say exactly this in yesterday's Shrinewatch video.
---
My heart races when seeing Daddy Myers
---
Actually most of the killers are viable, you just have to learn them. Of course some maps will make you loose, but other then that if you loose, then they just propably know better the game, not the killer is the problem.
---
Wearing headphones helps alot. I dont because I play casually if you want to rank you need good headphones
---
You are given a lot of time to do them. It gives you more items than buying some that aren‚Äôt in the shop. More cells(I‚Äôll be it at a small amount which you can use to further your tier or save for items. The quests are challenging and if we give them proper feed back there can be some unique and interesting ones.
---
 While I don't DC myself, I do understand the frustration on both sides. As a killer, it's frustrating to feel a sense of sympathy for the rest of the survivors who don't DC, but also a sense of genuine irritation that you can't play a real match against 4 survivors trying their best.
---
On the other hand, you have survivors playing against arguably the most frustrating killer, with a general sense of powerlessness. I understand that in an asymmetrical game the killer needs the power curve, but she plays different than any other killer for the most part. As a survivor, you don't really feel like you outplay a spirit, you just manage to outguess her. If you don't happen to be running iron will, you feel even worse off, because she has directional sound tracking, and you can't even be sure *if she's phasing* or not.
---
tldr; I don't condone disconnecting, but I can see the frustration behind it.
---
As far as I know the biggest complaint on Spirit is the prayer beads, which is probably getting nerfed.
---
double kill(dedicated servers btw)
---
I love this haha
---
removed for vote manipulation remove the downvote = agree or it will stay removed
---
I assume you are playing with a headset or headphones. It's all about practice, you will get better at hearing with the time.
---
Tip for the Spirit: Injure them first then phasewalk, during phasewalk you can't see them but you can "feel" their character models that's how you can pinpoint down the exact location of the survivor.
---
I‚Äôm happy about this change because before it was a hard counter to all stealth killers
---
probably yeah.
---
:(
---
Oh boy... just do ya thing nobody cares.
---
They really are. People are so naive to underhand tactics. Are you saying i'm not allowed to voice my opinion on bad business practice, but at the same time not able to support my favourite game and want the best for its playerbase? And correct many people...
---
I'm not going to 'make a stand' not sure where you got that from. But thanks for confirming you are in fact a kid, which explains it.
---
BPs are poison. So are lootboxes. Fremium games. P2W. And releasing incomplete games then charging for continuous dlc and updates. 
---
But this is the way of the world now. It just keeps getting worse.
---
I have 17K saved up and haven‚Äôt spent a dime on cosmetics. The only characters I play are licensed ones, so I have no use for shards. I have all the perks I want. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm not the only one who is like this.
---
Now, it‚Äôs been a very long time since I‚Äôve seen some DC right off the bat. Usually they don‚Äôt quit until second hook, and I don‚Äôt even get mad. As a fellow survivor, I get it. She‚Äôs just not fun whatsoever to go against. I don‚Äôt quit, but I pretty much except the game is going nowhere.
---
They don‚Äôt need to be nerfed, they need to be deleted completely. It‚Äôs absolute bullshit that they give something to a killer to where you can‚Äôt hear/see them coming AT ALL. That‚Äôs definitely a complaint of mine. But my other complaint is literally Spirit just is NOT fun to go against. My friend even said it, cause I showed her the thread. She said ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather go against a bumper Billy/insta saw Billy than a Spirit EVER. She just isn‚Äôt fun.‚Äù But, it‚Äôs preference.
---
So 5 blink nurse isn't game mechanics? Because you kinds of survivors complain about that a lot. If something is made over powered through add ons you can get in the game
---
Then... Does that mean... Flashlights can also be broken? No. That can't be. Haha, that's crazy, because that would make the majority of you hypocrites, and we all know that survivors are the most wholesome parts of the fan base.
---
I really really like this image
---
Ouch... that hurt my memory feels.
---
they also found sewer assets in game files
---
Dweet's cute. All I see is Ironworks of Misery. Let's trade.
---
Christ Almighty I forgot how fucking vicious survivors are any killer ever has a problem and the wrath of the survivor mains comes down upon you like look at all those salty survivors insulting you and crying like brats over you having a problem with on the go MoM/Borrowed time
---
People suicide or DC no matter who you play, it's just more common with people who don't understand to adjust their playstyle. And it wasn't begging. It's an actual concern that plagues this game. I just finally decided to post something for myself giving an example. People throw the match regardless if they make too many mistakes, no matter the killer. I don't care if they have fun, but as someone who used to mainly play survivor it's sad how things have gotten.
---
so did i XD
---
Im somewhat new, whats a Hex Haunted ground do?
---
Rank 1 survivor here, I don't DC but I really REALLY want to. 
---
Sometimes I even open up the menu and hover over the leave match button... but only in my fantasy do I allow myself to push it.
---
Thats simply bullcrap. Anticheats not scan only exe-s. They scan at least dll-s too, also many times modells, etc. Cause imagine if you can replace walls and such with glass modell, so you can see whatever you want...
---
But you're buying them. You speak with your wallet as a consumer. Don't be the idiot that buys something they don't agree with. It makes 0 sense. Calling me a kid doesn't justify your dumb ass logic.
---
As a killer I‚Äôll camp and tunnel all I want it‚Äôs not my job to make sure you had a fun game I just have to get four kills and do it however I can
---
As a doctor player, this hurts deep
---
Gen progress doesnt slow when you tunnel because the other 3 people stay on gens the entire time because they have no fear the killer is ever going to interact with them.
---
we had clown spirit legion and plague in a row as well
---
What does SWF actually mean?
---
for me just the beating of the terror radius makes my heart sync up with it which really puts me into my survivors shoes
---
"THAT'S IT! I'M BRINGING ME INSIDIOUS!"
---
Oh.
---
Its definitely frustrating, Spirit is for sure OP as hell. That's why I try to play fair and hardly phase unless I'm moving around the map. Idk what else to do to make it "fun" for people..
---
What about Pumpkin head from the 1988 movie?

---
Yea I really hope they don't buff it to not work with aura reading. Its fucking hilarious watching an insidious bubba with kindred.
---
yes!
---
I play both equally so I understand.
---
And its such a poor comparison. He compared survivorsbcrouching up and down and using perks and game mechanics thate are intended to a killer hard focusing one person and making the other survivors just stay on gens the entire game.
---
Its literally a borrowed time you can use at any time. How could it possibly be not be useful if you think borrowed time IS.
---
You have to remember that these are the same people who thought things like the OG Ironworks window, pallet vacuum, and old DS were balanced.
---
You just learn to take what they say with a grain of salt.
---
Poised needs a nerf, it is to op
---
If that were true red rank Nurses would 4k every game and yet they don't
---
8 seconds is stupidly small any survivor with a brain can get it off it should at least take like a couple more seconds or shouldn‚Äôt be able to be used while literally in the middle of chase 
---
The mend timer is a joke I all honesty it won‚Äôt effect anything and still makes that insta heal increase a chase by the same amount which is its biggest problem because chasing a survivor will make the timer not go down I suggest a slight nerf to it instead of 15 make it like 10 or 8 in return make oblivious not counter it (I don‚Äôt know how you‚Äôll do this)
---
I like the challenge on survivor, but lots of other killers get bullied so hard. I think I'm going to try new Nurse when the update comes out on console, with her marker addon. That's my way of having fun. But I hate how the community tries to shame people out of playing certain killers, I've never seen that before.
---
They do on Xbox
---
Tapp in the trap
---
I still think the best were the Halloween and winter music from 2017.  They need to bring those back, especially the halloween one
---
Well arent you fun at parties
---
Lol. Yeah I'm Red Rank Survivor as well. I feel like since I play spirit a lot I know how to counter her well. So I find it fun to play against spirits.
---
I definitely understand that as a former nurse main haha (which is the main reason I can see the frustration on both sides). I don't think she's super overpowered, she just seems... bloated? I guess? Like, she has a lot of advantages in minor ways that a lot of people don't seem to recogize. I think some QOL tweaks would make her fun to vs and fun to play, she's a really cool killer in all honesty.
---
You can use them but they are really inconsistent. Like i had one for hook struggling and it bugs out 50% of the time. Pretty unreliable
---
theres not much you can do but adapt and learn different strategies or just get really good without using any crutch perks, that way whenever you do youll be even better. i get a lot of sweaty killers too and i play mostly solo so i just practice loops and shit with no exhaustion perks. its seemed to help me a lot
---
Is console DBD still thriving?
---
I cant lie, those are pretty good too
---
Lol I didn't play back then either the video was SUPER early on but I have played for several years starting a few months before they reworked Wraith so I did get to play towards the tail end of some of the broken shit including Trappers permanently sabo'd traps.  I'm not proud of this but I used to sabo the fuck outta them against the man.  I remember a Lery's game where I broke every single one myself and turned the man into a Wraith that couldn't cloak.  I'm so sorry to all the Trappers I used to vs. back then.  The fact I could do that was pure cancer.
---
How did they change her?
---
This meme is hilarious and always gets me
---
Its literally his job to play dbd at this point and often encounters toxic neca‚Äôs and claudettes and stream snipers. Yet every thread in dbd makes fun of him for being annoyed about it.
---
Yea I guess you're right
---
No, from Nightmare before Christmas
---
Happened to me once as a survivor, my friend dropped a firecracker in front of me as a meme and permablinded me
---
Not sure what causes it though
---
Reading comprehension must not be your strong suit. From the beginning, I was saying it's not a subscription. You can play the game without buying the pass. 
---
There's nothing more hypocritical than telling me something is bad, but buying it anyways. You're that dude who tells people not to smoke, but smokes a pack a day. 
---
I'm not the one wearing blinders here. It's actually hilarious that I'm being called out for hypocrisy, but you're telling people not to support something that you're supporting.
---
Theres other ways to support bhvr. If you don't agree with a BP system, don't fucking buy it. Like I said, you're speaking with your wallet. If people stop buying passes, they die out. Buying it anyways then telling people its poison is the most backwards thing I've seen all day.
---
Nurse gets nerfed, med kits get buffed, survivors get an ass ton of new scoring events, 
---
 
---
Survivors ‚ÄúI sleep‚Äù
---
insta heals are slightly nerfed 
---
Survivors ‚Äú real shit REEEEEEEHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH‚Äù
---
Oh, so it's different than just quitting the match. I don't think I've come across that yet. Thanks for the info
---
*Freddy's hand turns to needles*
---
YOU WONT STAND A CHANCE AGAINST MY INJECTORS, BITCH!
---
I'm complete ass against an Instasaw Billy or Bubba lol. I first started playing Hag awhile ago before her buff... dear god that was bad XD I know theres no way to keep people in the game but it sucks alot lol. If there's one thing I might DC over its being slugged and being left on the ground to bleed out. I don't run Mori's, but one time on survivor I was tunneled by a Freddy and as soon as I was off the hook I was Mori'd. That was one toxic Freddy :/
---
Is there enough time to wait, how long do you have to teleport after trap is trigger?
---
Yeah he's shit right now they've talked about it
---
Played on Rotten Fields today. Against a demogorgon. I saved all 3 of the other survivors. I opened the gate prior to getting them. Pulled all 3 off and pallet stunned the killer carrying on after being pulled off. I finally get caught. And everyone dips. Big sad.
---
Ok, I'm not usually into aliens but the Xenomorph is fucking awesome and someone I genuinely wouldn't mind in dbd.
---
Tea baggers and killers camping are the same to me....both are lame
---
Hex thrill of the hunt is a perk that alerts you when someone is cleansing your hex totems
---
I didnt even use it. I was just trying to do my achievment adept bill without selfcare :P
---
I probably laughed waaaay to hard at this one than I shouldve.
---
"I'll give you... The last of my ripple, JoJo!"
---
SHHIIIIIZAAAAAAAAAAA
---
There is a hex perk in the game called Thrill of the Hunt that makes breaking hex totems longer AND notifies the killer if you work on it. But I'm guessing that he went to check on the totem without that perk, most killers do that.
---
That's over powered as all fuck
---
Thanks to you and everyone else that replied to me.You guys sealed the deal with Legion for me.Can't wait for the weekend to dive into Legion and Ghostface!
---
It‚Äôs a perk called Hex: Thrill of the Hunt, it gives the killer a notification whenever a survivor starts working on a hex totem and slows progress towards destroying hex totems. That‚Äôs what perk he was using so he could tell when you were working on it.
---
he's using the "thrill of the hunt" perk, it alerts the killer when a survivor is working on a hex totem.
---
We'll see üòâ
---
Broken as fuck. Fuck lather face
---
These are the best moments &lt;3
---
"I die for YOOOOUUUUUUUU!!!" is one of my DBD friend group's regular callouts :P
---
Luck. Once you hit those ranks, you have to hope they make lots of mistakes you can capitalize on
---
Nice guys finish last
---
I've prestiged multiple times and I can sure you there is nothing of the like
---
22nd I thought?
---
Good.  I wanna use that new day of the dead skin and unless it's around rank reset I cant so much with him
---
Did an alert for Hex: Thrill of the Hunt pop up? That gives notifications to the killer that you are cleansing totems
---
Serious Pumpkin has a Serious Message
---
You forgot to cut out the asscheeks, gotta get them cheeks.
---
I'm just gonna go with Serious Pumpkin and hope it shows up everywhere...
---
I did mean boldness and if the effect happened when not near survivors then it would be really op
---
I‚Äôm a pretty average survivor, but I can‚Äôt resist the teabag. Stun the killer with a pallet drop? Gotta teabag on the other side then run for my life haha I don‚Äôt get salty if he hunts me all match, it brings out the competition in all of us and I think it makes the round more fun. I‚Äôll take the 2 minute sacrifice for a laugh lol
---
We need some kind of silent hill character in the game
---
Enitity touched tokens?
---
ooo yum yum!
---
Because its on a timer of fifteen seconds, a smart killer can tell if you used an insta, if its a syptic you‚Äôll try to bait a hit while with a anti hemorrhagic syringe you‚Äôll try and make distance. The endurance effect isn‚Äôt permanent
---
Good representation, ive met far to many bills that are like that. Although to their credit alot of bill players i feel are new and choose bill cause hes L4D character and thats neat to see. (At least it was for me when i started playing)
---
No i did, i just farmed  and let nea do gens, once  she opened  the gate i let them out i just wanted  to do daily
---
Perfect
---
1. He has a perk called "Hex: Thrill of the Hunt". It takes up a totem and gives the killer a notification on when they work on it. However, this is risky as you're dedicating 25% of your loadout to protect another 25%.
---
2. Bubba is anything but OP. Once you learn how to run the killer around, his power becomes ineffective. Not trying to put you down, but Bubba becomes easier the more you know the game.
---
That's not a thing
---
id love to use it, however it is not working :(
---
Not for me it didn't. Actually my cleansing was increased but he still knew
---
I just wanna grill for God's sake
---
When i find out the killer is using that perk, I usually wait til the killer is in a chase and then pop the totem.
---
... ~*cackles in Hag*~
---
Hmm, he could have just been checking on it frequently. I have seen some killers do this
---
It deffo said summit about a token when I clicked prestige
---
Its such a small percentage increase. It's small but there.
---
Yeah, I don't think anything drastic is in order. Both of those sound infinitely easier to work with
---
He probably was it doesn't help it was in the middle of the map in the street next to 2 hooks
---
Well there isn't a token
---
True, I usually don't get spared when I drop my item. Maybe it's not common knowledge?  
---
I guess I would be more likely to let people go as killer if they literally begged on their knees. It's hard to abuse this too, since the teabagging kind of survivor would probably find it too humiliating to use as a mind game. As for killers abusing it... well, I already get the types that carry you to the open hatch only to close it on your face. Can't do much worse than that, right?
---
Wouldn't work. He would stop chancing and come right back like a little cunt.
---
Nuke this subreddit from orbit. Just shows you how immature the vocal community really is. Even the shitty "memeless" mode doesn't do anything, you got 1-2 threads a day were people "discuss" something. I will avoid this sub like a plague from now on. Nothing of value here anyway.
---
*please* fuck it up
---
Oh, trust me I know. I had a nasty Freddy over the weekend running his meta build to literally just stall the game. Every perk debuff for survivors possibly, and then add-ons to make it worse. All survivors DC‚Äôd that match one after the other cause it‚Äôs just not gonna be fun. And I‚Äôll be the first to admit, if I get to frustrated, I‚Äôll just go have a sweaty Killer match (I‚Äôm SUPERRRRRRR LOW rank on Killer cause I don‚Äôt usually play often enough to sit and rank up, so I‚Äôm sitting around 14-15 rn) and just let the steam out and then go back to survivor with my friend. Or I‚Äôll just stop playing. If I‚Äôm getting too toxic over it, I‚Äôll just stop. It‚Äôs a video game that I play for fun, so I really don‚Äôt want to have high blood pressure. So I know when to turn the game off and switch to something else, too. Because it‚Äôs not fun being a toxic (I mean toxic in the WORST sense‚Äîflaming people in comms if we‚Äôre a full team, or I‚Äôm sitting there screaming in frustration lol) survivor. üòÇ
---
I like it too
---
I know it's crazy?
---
I honestly dont get it. I'm rank 3 killer and yesterday I got 32000 BP in 2 games, didnt even pip, then got 20k in a game and got a tic above 1 pip. Not sure exactly how it works out on the killer side.
---
Well I'm bad at escaping and never will be good. Fuck leather face I'm just going to leave any game where he's the killer like I do the doctor
---
Of course: headsets are a must! Also, with sipirt, as was already said, if you do not have enough experience, you should injured first and then chase them. 
---
Well, the spirit is all about skill. Cant be teached. You dont trust only in sound. You must look at the whole enviroment (grass movement, scratchmarks, sound, colision) and a BIG intuition. Probably the streamers you see have many hours in the game and just knows survivors behavior under certain situations/tiles and take their guess. Sometimes they win sometimes they dont. Thats something you get only with time. Use and abuse the phase walking.
---
You had DS, you would scape anyway
---
No, there's plenty of things they could have done explained in this thread. Not everything needs to get nerfed.
---
Where did you get 70% speed from? Fixated is 12% ish and hope is 6% ish or something?
---
Honestly, these memes are dumb.  I've had games where all 3 survivors were red ranks, then when we get into game, all 3 get downed before I finished the first Gen with no Ruin.  Red Ranks means nothing for Survivors
---
Lol last night I played a match as survivor where we had the gate open and all four of us were in the exit and I'm healing one of my teammates for extra blood points. The nurse comes to the entrance and stares for a second and then blinked on this claudette that was t-bagging her. She had no-ed. Claudette died.
---
You just got the game a week or two ago of course you suck still you're supposed to.  You don't know how to play yet.  Bubba is one of the easiest killers in the game to face and Doctor is just annoying but overall weak.  You will be trash forever if you toddler rage out of games instead of learning how to play against these killers.  And you'd be toxic trash at that since you are fucking over your teamates everytime you pull that 6 year old flip the Monopoly Board ever because fuck Landing on Park Place mentality.  Grow up, play your games and learn from them.
---
Apart from the order being odd what's up here
---
I've been playing a lot of survivor and I pretty much run off meta builds commonly. I have fun too. I usually run bond borrowed time balanced and a filler perk like kindred 
---
I think the meta like adrenaline dead hard ds and self care /bond isn't fun.
---
Because when you win you feel good about yourself, you did good without following the meta. DBD is fun but when you get the bad people you play with or against it ruins the fun, so I always have tried my best not to be toxic I always say ggwp and it works usually but some people can't be argued with :l
---
Toxic as a concept is dumb. Lets me just crouch once or just use my flashlight. Then getting a shitstorm from the killer when the game actually ends.
---
Good plan I'll try it
---
I can't imagine that happening as this game fosters a "us vs them" mentality pretty strongly. Not everyone finds it easy to disconnect yourself and not everyone is mentally balanced enough to admit their own mistakes and not blame the "other side" (teammates, killer, survivors).
---
I don't care. I play to have fun and they are not fun.
---
I can't counter them so I will not deal with them
---
German doesn't work like that.
---
It's even "das M√§dchen" for "the girl" - she gets a neutral article, not a female one. It's like "either you learn it one by one for every noun in this universe or you are screwed". :D
---
doesnt work that way. the splinter isn't universal; it sticks to one character, which, when burned, makes you be that killer for that round w/o perks. It doesnt stay on other killers, only the one you bought it, and it's a trial demo, not an unlockable
---
Don‚Äôt think about it that way think of it as bright minds think alike :)
---
When Jason is there it's basically when they add 2v8
---
Okay.. so because I feel the Rift isn't meaningful progression because it's just cosmetics, I'm a casual? 
---
The only meaningful progression I see is the archives because that's lore. That gives us more information about the characters. That's meaningful to me.
---
Ooooh, new cosmetics I could get for only $10 are sooooo meaningful. Sure, I'm the casual.
---
Bruh
---
I play to have fun too but I have the common decency not to ruin an entire game just because it's a killer I don't like.
---
Definitely the most terrifying so far, and tbh probably always will be
---
Tunelling is toxic to me when I just get unhooked and the guy who saved me is right in plain view but they immediately smack me down again. I get it, I'm injured but still lol
---
And then not do gens?
---
No I'm asking cos there's a bug with splinters rn that causes you to not play as said killer for the game but the one you burnt it on but after you have the killer that is tied to the splinter selected as if you own them
---
Girl I don‚Äôt even run purples, I‚Äôll just yellow and green with double batteries so I can get maybe a save or two more. I‚Äôm still pretty trash but I‚Äôm practicing in matches and getting better with help from my friend lol
---
This clip doesn't include the entire loop I ran but generally, you want to see if a billy is an M1 or M2 billy as early as possible so that you know which loops you can run and how to run them.
---
*Happy pig noises*
---
yeah but I wouldn't teabag the killer at the gate before running straight out without letting them get a hit
---
Do you mind if i ask what rank you are?
---
To me toxic behavior is to go out of your way to ruin someone else's fun, everything else is ok to me; if I get frustrated I just curse at the monitor and go on with my life without the need to tell how scummy my opponent was. It must be noted though that people who do act toxicly on pourpose they deserve to receive what they did back to them.
---
Hell yeah I did a thing
---
The wise pumpkin has spoken.
---
Oh damn they destroyed her
---
Working towards something is progression in my eyes. If they are rewards they are meaningful.
---
Just because a game isn't pay to win doesn't mean you should pat them on the back. P2w is truly disgusting and should never be an option in the first place. But here we are.. (thanks EA!).
---
I use selfcare, breakdown, spine chill, and DS. I want to remove one for head on or kindred or WGLF or even Dead Hard, but i need some help picking and with supporting facts. Im not getting rid of self and spine, because these are just helpful, especially when there is a camping killer (e.g., a killer was camping me, a neon nea selfcared and rescued me)
---
I once "thank you "teabagged a teamate for healing me, and the killer tunneled me because they assumed I teabagged them lol
---
Why did you take them out of the box?
---
There's nothing reasonable about what you've told me. "I hate supporting this thing and people shouldn't do it, but I'm going to support this thing". You are telling them it is a good thing. They don't see your Reddit complaints, they see the $10 you just put in their wallets. Which makes perfect sense. Why would they change something you complain about if you're going to buy it anyways?
---
Like I said before, you can still support bhvr in other ways without having to buy the pass. Keep buying new killers, keep buying new cosmetics. Saying you want to continue supporting them so you just have to buy the pass is a weak argument. All I really get out of you is that you're a compulsive buyer but you really wanna take some sort of high ground for some reason.
---
No the smartass with DS loses. 
---
Ill clean up his team w noed later.
---
16. Honestly I think ranks shouldn't exist in this game  they clearly don't work conciderong I just played a match with a rank 8 and the killer was rank 6 while all 3 of us other survivors were rank 18-14
---
He's actually not that bad as people make him out to be. He has very good first hit potential and very good against SWF. The hard part about playing him is the part after you injure them, downing them (Which every killer expect top 4 have to do). And out of all killers he probably has the best build potential out there. You can go Nurses+Sloppy, Save the Best For Last/Remember Me, Iridescent Button+Enduring+Spirit Fury, Bamboozle/I'm all Ears, it all works amazing on him. Probably just a small handfuls of perks are pretty bad (Play with your food, Bloodhound, Predator to name a few)
---
Just know what you're doing, I consistently 3k/4k with him at Red ranks. If you miss Feral Frenzy, use your power willy-nilly, use it at the wrong time, it's gonna suck and you're gonna get punished heavily. Most people are bad at playing him so there's this Stigma around him thinking he's bad. People who actually play him and give him a chance know he's pretty good and definitely decent.
---
The Entity takes creatures from the realm of the living and puts them in the realm of the Entity. Therefore, the Entity could have taken it from Russia and it just seems to have dissapeared in the eyes of the humans.
---
Wooooosh
---
Get a 4K for sure
---
And hook multiple times 
---
Everything follows into these goals
---
The other 4
---
While clown is weak killer, he is still better then bubba, wraith, trapper, legion, doctor, pig. He does ok in purple ranks
---
Try not to do it at all till you're a little older, you're in a period of your life where it's really important that you're fully present
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/dg1y8i/spirit_and_plague_lovechild/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
I think that would be hitting them on-hook, which is very much just as toxic.
---
Unless you're demogorgon, that's just cause the successful hit animation is awesome.
---
Have you tried Legion?
---
It's a censorship thing, but also a licensing thing. Before a licensed DLC can be produced, they license holders greenlight every little thing then characters do and have done to them, in case they see something that they don't want affiliated with their brand. For example, now that The Plague has been implemented, there's a number of vomit-based interactions that have to be accepted before a licensed survivor can be greenlit. The Demogorgon's mori being bastardised therefore makes things easier for them in the sense of not complicating license negotiations further, since if they wanted a DLC for, I don't know, Psycho, but the license holders didn't want Marion Crane's head bitten off, that would be an issue that's been preemptively resolved.
---
r/beetlejuicing
---
what do you mean?
---
Thank you for the tips everyone I really appreciate it :) I do play with earphones but i'll try with my headphones instead and try to focus on all the things you all said for Spirit
---
For me, as soon as you throw down a pallet, either run or hide. Not in a locker, might I add. I was in the swamp, and against a myers (i did most gens), and i learned that the myers took me getting away 3 times before looking carefully. Blendette is your best friend if you hide **but do the gens**. For me, it's extremely easy if it's spine chill so get spine chill and hide if both terror and spine is up. as for RUNNING, get speed perks such as dead hard or sprint burst
---
I'm glad man. We need more non-shitty Legion players. Maybe one day we won't be hated and we can all come together and get them buffed in a way that is fun and fair for everyone, as well as being more viable.
---
I think of it like this. I pay $12 - 13 (in my country), and I get to earn things for the next 70 days for my characters. I spend that much on cosmetics for my characters anyways. On top of that, if I play the game enough, I'll earn the next 70 days for free.
---
I spend $14 a month on Netflix, $60 on a cell phone plan. Depending on the month, I may not use Netflix at all, and I never call anyone with my phone. I'll probably get less usage time out of those services than I will out of the Rift.
---
Yes, I understand that some people take issue with a gaming company offering a battle pass, but I don't see how DBD's Rift is predatory in any way. It's cosmetics and a few auric cells. I'm not going to be any better at the game because I have the pass. If I find it's not worth it after I try it, or if I can't play as often, then I just choose not to buy the next one.
---
lol says the guys who's putting words in my mouth.
---
Stop typing for a sec and read.
---
My Legion build is Monitor&amp;abuse, Save the best for last, Ruin and Bbq..it's kind of a fun build but it works for me
---
With Monitor it's easier to find survivors at the start and when you hit them with your power, your terror radius gets bigger and you can see where everyone is most of the times. I use power duration addons
---
Would love to see Myers and Freddy, Myers chasing you in real world while Freddy hunt you down while asleep
---
Well it‚Äôs good you have fun doing your own thing, there are definitely builds on both sides that aren‚Äôt meta and can still be pretty enjoyable. Probably less so at the high ranks, lol. Why do you feel running a meta build would be toxic though?
---
I'm trying to level up enough to get a self cate urban and unbroken set up. But it's going to take forever.
---
Which begs the question. Do you lose all perks if you prestige a character? And how would teachable work that way? Most importantly if you don't prestige can you continue getting g blood webs past 50?
---
One of the things I like about playing ghostface is that I can teabag toxic players who teabag me when they‚Äôre hooked
---
I try and farm when I get to the end but the survivors hate me :-(
---
That's not a problem at all. They can just apply invisible texture to the head. Also, there is another mori that decapitates a finger.
---
Fuck now I need doordash
---
A good build is to sabotage every hook to 99, stay away from the basement and bodyblock every hit, only good with SWF though
---
There are very few people who only main one side of the game who have opinions worth listening to about balance. Even the people who play both side in a decent capacity can‚Äôt really be listened to unless they‚Äôre actually an important figure in the dev‚Äôs ear. Sadly all of our Fog Whisperers are.....questionable.
---
Mine says i cant view the community
---
Couldn‚Äôt you test this with Borrowed Time against Doctor?
---
wow, what a brilliant argument from the guy complaining about a system where you have to *shock* play the game to unlock stuff in it.
---
I love playing against ghostfaces! It's so much fun and it's so funny to watch them teabag, I can't even be mad! 
---
I can see how it would be useful, especially in red ranks!
---
Yes!
---
.... idk I dont think in a 2v8 there will be a unbeatable combo... since the map.size would be insane... but I can tell you now that trapper would combo really well with all the stealth killers, gameplay spirit and the like.
---
They would also need to kinda rebalance some killers for this mode like trapper would need some more traps because it's a bigger map, pig would need more traps because theres more survivors...
---
And they would need to make it so the killers could see each others belongings, like a spirit can see her allies traps, and the likes.
---
Oh YES
---
Could be, at first I thought it was the 10th
---
It's not that it's toxic it's just that I would've been burnt out if I didn't play like this, I've been playing since before nurse in 2016 and Ive only taken a few short breaks.
---
Link to the confirmation?
---
Amazing! I will be getting these right away!
---
Negan from the beginning of Season 7 as killer and Rick as a survivor. Perfect mori and chapter
---
I‚Äôm asking why is it toxic, though? In a scenario like you just laid out, the killer would probably be doing the surviving team a favor by letting you go off the hook and chasing someone else. Why is it toxic for them to do their objective? 
---
I‚Äôm genuinely asking, don‚Äôt want to come off snide.
---
Happened to me multiple times.
---
Also, I‚Äôve been getting hit from extremely  far distance hits, like worse than usual.
---
Like every killer is running the the stretch arm strong perk.
---
Agreed
---
100%
---
I jusy recently got tunneled by a clown, but it was because he knew that i had seen his ruin.
---
What he didn't realize was that i brought a med-kit with a styptic, dead hard, and decisive strike.  
---
Many pallets were dropped on his head.
---
You do lose all perks for that character when you prestige but the unlockables stay unlocked. You will constantly regenerate blood webs at level 50. Honestly I would not prestige unless you just really want the bloody base cosmetics. As it sits, at rank 50 each bloodweb will have 4 perks in it and you can get 2. Ive been leveling all my survivors up to level 50 and not prestiging just so I can get tier 3 of all perks. Sadly Dead Hard refuses to drop for my Meg
---
That's not true for tunneling at all, face camping sure, but you can only tunnel someone if a teammate comes to rescue them in the first place. So you've got 2 people off gens at least, if you're playing a killer like hag or demo who can easily return to a hook before the survivors can make distance then it makes more sense to down the injured person in 1 hit and then chase the other person. If they do get some distance before you get back then you just chase the first person you find. If you're getting tunneled after a safe unhook it means you made a mistake and got found. There may be some rare occasions where the killer wants you dead specifically for some reason, but I only tunnel specific people if they're clicking flashlights or teabagging, at which point they dont care about my fun so why should I have to care about theirs? either way theres not really any reason to blame the killer for it. The only people you can blame for tunneling are your teammates who farmed you with an unsafe hook or yourself for getting found again.
---
Definitely not ruined, but also not healthy for your brain that is still developing.

Thank you :3
---
And you think sex with animals is cool? That's crazy dude. Don't do that.
---
That‚Äôs fair. Hell of a long time it‚Äôs been...
---
Okay thanks for telling me that. I might prestige one character maybe Nea for the cosmetics then that's it. Shes who I play the most anyway mostly because I wanted Teachable Urban but now that I have it, it hasn't popped on any of my webs yet and I'm focusing on bill to get Unbreakable
---
Idk I think trapper wouldn't be too hot with survivors unless they give him more traps in this game mode.
---
I mean I don't recall him being upset about the meme, more about everything that was being said in the comments section. Which if you saw, the comments were pretty nasty. I don't really enjoy his content anymore but the shit being said was kinda ridiculous.
---
If you think teabagging is okay then you probably do it, which is why you get tunneled? Follow along here it isnt rocket surgery.
---
I feel you, it's not the end of the world it's just not ideal
---
Double batteries is good! I have a bad problem with hoarding my items on survivor.. I'm an ingame hoarder xD
---
The Objective of the killer is to down survivors and hook them. Playing the game is not "Toxic".
---
You arent coming off as snide but you are asking for an explanation when it isnt really needed. You dont need to explain yourself if thats what you do, to each their own.
---
I just updated the pack and I made a lot of changes on the perks and status effect :  [https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/dg21bf/nebula\_complete\_colored\_perks\_with\_happy\_clown/](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/dg21bf/nebula_complete_colored_perks_with_happy_clown/)
---
Ok now for all the marbles.
---
Quote where I said teabagging is ok.
---
Baby Dwights are cute... But if they're left in the wrong environment they grow up to become Dwight Supremacists.
---
How do you get haste status affect them? I don't rember it anywhere else but Hope. I'm probably just not remembering.
---
these are bugged yeah
---
Same. My friend is a flashlight hoarder. Lol. I only P3‚Äôd my Claudette for the trophies, so now all I do is collect items on everyone I‚Äôm currently leveling (cause this isn‚Äôt my full time game lol)
---
Having muscles in its body and thick skin doesn't make up for the biological flaw of not being able to bite through things because it doesn't have a jaw.
---
Bullshit this isnt a cosplay you just took a screenshot in game and posted it
---
Everywhere I go Doppio follows
---
That's what I'm thinking, I'm sure it does but there's a lot of wierd interactions in the game with 2 killers.
---
We know the killers objective. I thought this was a discussion thread? Not here to argue. Its objectively what an indivdual themselves see as toxic. I dont really care what you guys do, its just a game. I was participating in OP's discussion.
---
yes. especially if ur wearing scoops.
---
hell yea
---
Really nice how you handled the situation. I like that it was kind of an mexican standoff between the killer and you guys.
---
you right
---
Not true at all. Queue time on ps4 is extremely long but on pc it‚Äôs less than a minute
---
Meg has two good perks so I can recommend her
---
Karma LULW
---
Quintin smith hands down
---
Damn! Even got the nerve to steal Bill's hat and to take his cigarettes! [ In all seriousness, this is the most amazingly well done art I've seen all day! Kudos to you! ]
---
So every survivor has 3 specialty perks you can unlock to use on other characters once you get them to level 40-50. It helps to look at those perks and see what appeals to you. I'd recommend Claudette. You can learn to heal yourself without a med kit with her Self Care (which is super helpful when you're new to the game) and her Empathy is really helpful to show where your teammates are. Also the female characters are usually smaller and quieter, so it's easier to hide from killers. Claudette is especially good because she blends into the shadows/tall grass/cat tails when crouching.
---
Claudette/Meg are probably your best 2 survivors for new players, both of their perks makes starting out a bit easier. Plus they‚Äôre both female so there‚Äôs an added bonus for you :)
---
You are a *G*ood *G*uy
---
Yeah teabagging definitely corresponds to not being able to play the game OMEGALUL

Forgive me, I just feel as if killer mains are trying to justify every single personal opinion a survivor makes and I'm not comfortable with being berrated by killer mains defending their honour. It is seen as toxic, by me, because I would like to have a chance to get back in control of my character and play the game for more than 2 minutes after waiting in a lobby for 15+ minutes after work. And when the reason I'm out of the game so quickly is because I was chosen to die as fast as possible even though someone else is right in front of you, its a bit annoying. Again, play how you feel, no hate. But thats my reasoning.
---
It all depends. Each set of survivors has 3 specific perks to them.  I‚Äôd suggest seeing which set you like first and try leveling them up. You can eventually unlock certain perks on the characters you like playing! Hope this makes sense and helps!
---
Pig mains: haha sorry
---
Scratch that question. I just found a lengthier video showing the ST and Halloween cosmetics. Laurie‚Äôs new look looks like a scene from the original movie. I‚Äôm looking forward to her changes.
---
Haste is given with all exhaustion perks besides Head On and Dead Hard. So Sprint Burst, Balanced Landing, Lithe, and Adrenaline along with Hope all provide it for survivors. 
---
Three killer perks grant haste for the killer in NOED, Play With Your Food, and Devour Hope at two stacks (the most forgettable haste in the game).
---
In all seriousness though, even though 90% of the time it just results in you getting re-hooked, I‚Äôve seen it work out before if things go right. Definitely requires luck and some finesse. Only viable if you‚Äôre on your second hook already and time is almost up, otherwise yeah, I‚Äôm with you. Dick move, lol.
---
get's fucken stuck.
---
They're just walking around
---
thank
---
There are also alternative builds to use with legion which are: Enduring/spirit fury and Thanatophobia/Sloppy butcher instead of the 2 perks i recommended to you
---
Is there anything that you can only acquire by paying money?  Or, can all be earnt through play?
---
Ran into this yesterday, survivors got pissed and decided to just hide it out and try force me to quit. I managed to find one of them after like 10 minutes and killed them so I was able to close the hatch and force the last one out, but it was so dumb that they could just post up in a locker and stall the game to try force a DC.
---
You're completely correct. It still resulted in me disliking proxy camping and tunnelling, since I discovered that you can still win consistently without those "toxic" strats. On the other hand, if you can't, you're probably just bad :) Fuck Mori NOED Spirits and Flashlight DS Neas tho
---
I‚Äôd say Ace is hard for beginners though, everyone else is good! 
---
A lot of people say Claudette because self care, but Meg and Feng are good because they help you escape the killer (sprint burst; lithe), Claudette‚Äôs perk don‚Äôt do that. I went with Claudette first because she‚Äôs my favorite tho :3 Nea is good too but most of the time you don‚Äôt get a lot maps that‚Äôs utilize balanced landing the best. Jake is decent because of iron will, Dwight is good because of prove thyself. 
---
It‚Äôs basically whoever you want! I think it‚Äôs good to try out everyone since you don‚Äôt have teachables, so experiment around!
---
Im surprised you didnt go for the wombo combo of a toxic survivor main
---
1) t-bag at pallet
---
2) insta heal
---
3) jump of cliff and spin 180 into a moonwalk
---
4) tbag at exit gate and escape
---
Link the png
---
Start with feng. She was lithe as a great exhaustion perk. Alert is pretty decent way of knowing where the killer is and technician helps beginner survivors since they tend to miss skill checks.  Spine chill is a great alternative for alert and it‚Äôs not a survivor teachable so you might get it randomly on the web. After you get fengs teachables it depends on your play style. Do you like to just avoid confrontation? Then get meg‚Äôs teachable ‚Äúquick and quiet‚Äù to pair it up with lithe and lightweight so you can fast vault a window and get away from the killer.  Or if you‚Äôre more altruistic. I suggest leveling up David, Bill and Claudette for We‚Äôre going to live for ever, borrowed time and empathy. Although some people might argue we‚Äôre going to live forever is not necessary but I like it to get those extra blood points
---
HHVR, read this person‚Äôs comment and make sexy cosmetics for the all killers!!! WE WILL PAY A LOT!
---
The killer was within 2 feet of him which I feel like anyone should know "maybe I shouldn't unhook him?"
---
It's just irritating getting punished for something you have no control over, y'know?
---
The PTB is, if I remember.
---
This is especially true for people who complain about certain killers or certain survivor perks/items. If you play the other side then you'll understand why they do or use certain things and more importantly, you'll learn how to play against them. Learn, adapt, overcome. 
---
Just play the game people, let's all be nice and understanding to each other.
---
I play scoops Steve and didn‚Äôt even think about it being a special thing to tunnel him but now that I think about it, I feel it
---
Change your perk loadout? Any of the alert ones (spine chill/premonition) that give you a heads up when the killer is coming will help you avoid getting into a chase in the first place. Lightweight is helpful. Lithe/Balanced Landing or any perk that gives you a speed boost to zoom away. Also! Play some matches as a killer so you can see their view point so you can tell how to hide/evade easier.
---
Self care will be important for a new player.  Claudette is many people‚Äôs first.  After that I‚Äôd get Megs teachables.  Finally pick the survivor that you like most cosmetically and main them.
---
I don't mind that Pennywise would be in the game at all. I'm not sure how he would play but that's not really my job to figure it out either. My main gripe doesn't even come from Pennywise himself... I just... Want an original killer again please.
---
You would go into struggle phase since you didnt enter the struggle phase
---
Pharmacy is garbage now, since you can't heal 2 states with it. And its only 1 Medkit out of chest. Inner Strenght is better now.
---
No reason to take it that way, like I said, keeping things civil. 
---
Aren‚Äôt you essentially saying that tunneling is toxic to you because, in that bit you just mentioned, you die too quickly? That doesn‚Äôt really seem fair when their objective is to kill the survivors. And in case you think I‚Äôm just defending the killers, I‚Äôd say the same thing about any killer who says gen rushing is toxic (they could actually use the exact same reasoning, because they feel they have no control and the game goes too quickly). Gen rushing is just a result of the survivors doing their objectives, wouldn‚Äôt be fair to say they‚Äôre toxic for that.
---
With addons, the cooldown is nearly nonexistent. Omegablink may be gone, but addons are still very strong and base kit is still very powerful, imo.
---
Fun fact overcharge is cancelled by gen tapping, what it's a counter for, survivor did it right before my eyes.
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how many of them are 18+. There are a lot of people who lack their own personality so they act pretty basic about everything they do in life. It comes don‚Äôt to a monkey see monkey do type of mentality.
---
Don't play console the end
---
As long as you didn't struggle, then you will go that phase next.
---
That is what I'm saying, yes.

---
Yeah the finally stayed still for 2 long and the crows came after like 15 min of me running around the map opening lockers .. what a huge waste of time
---
this is why iron maiden is top tier
---
They havent said anything on iri heads amigo, they arent going anywhere any time fast
---
They will try to force you to quit. Don't do that. They are just being salty. Keep going until you find them. Check the basement and all the lockers.
---
This is so sad, can we nerf Pig?
---
I'm kidding, God does she need help.
---
I'm sure it is, but I've been spending all my points on survivors so I'm running 1 perk killers lol
---
I tunnel him because I like him, not hate him. Big difference.
---
JK, if I get too into a chase and end up tunneling you, I'll usually let you go after. Some survivors are just fun to run around with, but I end up feeling bad about it after. Steves, Kates and Neas get the brunt of it from me.
---
The game would be 100% more playable to me if killers didn‚Äôt hit and face camp while on hook, and if survivors didn‚Äôt teabag all the time
---
Negan would be dope. Give him the whistle from the TV show but make him look more like the comic version. He‚Äôs already got a murder weapon with Lucile.
---
I‚Äôm with you, it‚Äôs a Hail Mary and really only ought to be tried if you‚Äôre seconds from dying. Otherwise...
---
Although, I do resent ‚Äúpunished‚Äù. I‚Äôm an annoying semantics guy, lol.
---
Oh goodie more sexualization
---
Yea I found them and thankfully I was using ghost face so they can bleed out to me doing a butt dance
---
Ended up getting the 4k too, such a sweet victory!
---
No idea man they are all pretty trash compared to the other cosmetics
---
He is seriously creepy when he smiles... go back to being serious faced!
---
Maybe they should add some penalty if no gen is touched in 5 minutes or if no gen is complete after the last one was complete.
---
Only people that sucked complained about base kit nurse, it was the addons that was the issue, but BHVR going the classic "lets overnerf xd, oh hey pre 2nd rework freddy" decided that just sledging her was better
---
I never compared the two.
---
How did you get footage of me playing killer?
---
We salute you hero
---
Well, i suppose I'm more just trying to find out if clown is decent. I want to play a balanced killer but one that isn't horrible. And I've seen good things done with the tonic, it seems useful most of the time
---
I love the huntresses messaging me about being a toxic t-bagger, while i'm just trying to dodge those hatchets :v
---
Today I played 3 games as killer, got t-bagged by at least 6 survivors, admittedly 4 of them were SWF and trolled the whole game but it seems to be getting worse than it already was.
---
I agree with you too except the caveat is that what you mentioned are items and addons, whereas slugging is a playstyle choice. I dont expect anybody to agree with me, but let me just say that people such as me that have every perk unlocked on both sides, have rank 1 achievements on both sides,  and dont care about pipping or bloodpoints...we have ZERO incentive to stay in a game when slugged (lengthy slug, not a strategic short slug to down the survivor that unhooked me in front of the killer's face). Also, when solo survivors such as myself are slugged, the incentive you give us is to group up in a 4 man swf. Maybe a little more kindness towards solo survivors would go a long way? Just a thought...
---
Eh, I've done better with clown than I have with pig, maybe it's just my luck
---
Survivors that hard bm lose their right to a fair game.  At that point I'd understand why you'd consider camping them but I'd still encourage against it as that means you're typically throwing the game just to take out the 1 guy.  I'd rather continue playing to beat them all but that's just me.  Earlier on in my playing days I'd camp these types of douchebags too but at this point I'd rather continue playing to outplay the entire group.  But again completely understandable imo if you decide you're willing to lose the game to take out the toxic trash.
---
I think there are some instances where t-bagging is not toxic to the killer.
---
1. When the survivor knows they‚Äôre in danger and t-bags as a sign of defeat. Usually 2 times up and down signifies this.
---
2. T-bags when you let them go. However, it is important to count how many times they t-bag. Again, usually 2 times up and down means ‚Äúthanks!‚Äù, and spamming it is them being a tad bit toxic
---
3. Like you said, giving the killer free hits for more blood points
---
4. Photobomb a Ghostface mori (or really any mori)
---
5. T-bag a toxic teammate
---
Thank you! I‚Äôve recently equipped spine chill which I love however I seem to always run away into the direction of the killer so I need to get used to it still haha! I did have sprint burst equipped but was told it wasn‚Äôt the best, is lithe and balanced landing generally better than sprint burst? Thanks for your help :)
---
We don‚Äôt blame you guys, which is why I find the term gen rush a little misleading.
---
It isn‚Äôt your fault for doing gens quickly or using ridiculous loops like ironworks or BL on haddonfield. Its the devs fault for letting it exist, just like it was with machine gun builds or lack of entity block on windows or vacuum pallets or anything else blatantly overpowered that‚Äôs existed before and has since been removed. Obviously to a much much lesser extent, but you get the idea.
---
Alright, thanks for explaining that. I do disagree and think that it‚Äôs really unfair to say that the other team doing their objectives too quickly is toxic behavior (like gen rushing), but thank you for the discussion.
---
When this happens I‚Äôm run along the edges of the map without my terror radiance and stay observant it works everytime
---
Puts two hex totems on the map, of you cleanse one all survivors are ‚Äúexposed‚Äù which allows the killer to down you in one hit
---
Something bc that strat almost worked I did almost just quit but I didn‚Äôt want to deal with the msgs afterwards
---
I like to hunt him, but I try not to tunnel him or something. But if he is one of the last, I'm prefer to get him the escape than other survivors.
---
I actually would disagree with the statement that clown is better than bubba and doctor outright, just from experience. I agree that he's better than legion and I'm not sure about pig and trapper yet but I'm leaning towards "he isn't"
---
Yep
---
David king because he will get you a lot of blood points and help you level up other survivors faster
---
Thank you! I tried Kate‚Äôs perk for a little while, I can‚Äôt remember what it‚Äôs called but it shows pallets and vaults within a certain radius, I could equip that again to give me some better practice using the surroundings to escape, thanks for the help :)
---
Imagine if it wasn‚Äôt even that box
---
Very nice!
---
It was on coldwin so only thing you‚Äôd see from the edge of the map is corn üòí
---
haha nice pig sad oink oink
---
Survive While Farming
---
Keming
---
You look like a ghost haunting him
---
Struggle, but there is currently a glitch where sometimes you die. So i guess the answer is both atm
---
Sorry to burst your bubble, but they all started following Stephen king on Twitter, just like they did with stranger things. There are ¬´¬†sewer¬†¬ª models in the game files, and McCote uploaded a picture on Instagram heavily referencing It
---
Well I mean... It's the reflection of the fire/light around him that makes it that way on the banner. I thought it was pretty obvious lol?
---
Still you should try that.
---
Gotta say, I'm only an asshole to assholes. I've had my shares of bad experiences in this game. It's so frustrating when you obviously want to farm when there's an event, you send friend requests, you keep hitting ready, you put up a Blood Party Streamers offering, you hit pallets and gens, but they still wanna tryhard and rush gens to make 11k bloodpoints at the end of the match. Dumb as hell. But one time the fours survivors didn't want to farm, so I salughtered them all and "farmed" anyway by making 30k from the actual match + 30k from the event + 30k from the stacks of Barbecue &amp; Chilli + 30k from the Bloody Party Streamers offering + 30k from the daily = a total of 150k. And there's the toxic survivors that instead of looping you and getting away from you to end the chase, decide to t-bag you only to complain later about being camped and tunneled. What about a Bill that obviously has Borrowed Time, but instead of coming to help you, run to the gates and leave? What about a Bill that unhook you but do not have Borrowed Time? I swear, Bill players are among the worst. There was a Dwight once that made it out alive, complained for no reason and called me names after the match (I died in the basement). Right after this match I found him, he was hooked by the killer, I pretended I was gonna save him but as I was pulling him off the hook, I kept canceling the animation, until I stopped and begin t-bagging in front of the hook. He was so pissed he swore he was "gonna fuck me up". Vengeance is sweet and karma is real, folks. I have other stories to tell but we would be here all day.
---
If you're playing to intentionally disrespect and annoy the killer though you really don't have a leg to stand on when it comes to expecting a fair game.  You're kind of going out of your way to ask for it.  Though I agree he shouldn't do it but for the exact opposite reason of you.  I just wouldn't want to throw the entire game to get a 1K.  On his end the camp doesn't make sense.  It has nothing to do with showing consideration for toxic babytrash that hard bm.
---
I made a post a while back discussing this glitch when a buddy and I accidentally made a 2killer custom match.
---
&gt;  If I had a good game as survivor and I'm waiting at the exit gate, it's to let the killer get a free hit before leaving.
---
Please don't do that, either.
---
 So, some things to take into consideration. They're *extremely good* for ranking up. Irridescent in chase almost every time. Bringing things like sloppy butcher and thanataphobia can help in slowing the game down (just a little bit). After using their ability though, they're what's considered an "M1 Killer". Bringing Save The Best For Last can really help end chases quicker since you should be stacking up that perk pretty much from the get go. From there, other perks that help end chases faster could really put you in a great position. Personally, I'm All Ears is super underrated (from what I've seen, other people may love it) and can really be a godsend if you're not great at predicting and mindgaming.
---
Oh yeah! Thanks for the reminder.
---
I used to scream whenever a killer found me. Legitimately scared the hell out of me. You get past it.
---
Different goals for different people, the main goal for survivors is to survive and sometimes the best way to do so is to completely escape, if you‚Äôve already been hooked twice for example it could be more beneficial to just try and get away rather than waste time being chased, although it helps others get gens done it isn‚Äôt beneficial for me when I‚Äôm getting downed and hooked often because of being rubbish at escaping
---
That's one of the biggest issues with Spirit.  It's very easy to rank up beyond what you'd be at with other killers due to the sheer strength of her kit and the fact that the skillcap involved in playing her is very low.
---
This is my go-to tactic. Especially in the Swamp cat tails, the Farm cornfields or the trees in the Estate.
---
Can you try clown and see what his model does?
---
The guys I watch regularly alternate between survivor and killer....
---
Thanks for your help! I recently equipped spinechill and and I enjoy using it Just need a little more practice with it I‚Äôll look for a good speed perk to equip too
---
I would put money down that some of the people complaining about the grindy nature of the rift are the same people who have prestige 3 on most (if not all) survivors/killers in the game. What do they think they have been doing all that time?
---
1hr a day is completely fair and I'd imagine that 95% of the community will be able to complete the rift in 70 days.
---
7hrs a week, people, it's much less grindy than the base game.
---
This is amazing(: great job
---
You mean the ones that do gens because they're bad at getting chased? Easy peasy.
---
What a cute art style!
---
idk why i havent suscribe to him yet, his videos are so interesting.
---
I agree with you on that. Unless you save a million bloodpoints to prestige the character, you're going to be playing one with low-level perks to get the good offerings. Eventually, the bloodwebs get so big that it takes forever to get new ones
---
Id rather someone do that than let me hit struggle, so many dumb survivors lately who just dont unhook you to avoid "farming you"
---
I love it too, Legion was annoying for me, but Clown was very nice.
---
This is why I said that most GF mains are trash.
---
Wait you guys are earning something from your 500+ games weekly?
---
Same happened to me. They held the match hostage 45 minutes past the first to deaths, then when I got finally caught them, why didn't you let me have hatch? Get real
---
Love your content
---
I agree with you, I love this game and wanna see it grow but feels like they just wanna milk it dry instead of taking care of it
---
I'd rather see devs working to make it great. Make it compete to other major games and it has the potential to. Hope they will but with the battle pass and recent changes, I'm not sure anymore that's gonna happen..
---
Bruh the rank resets every month, you'll never get to the top and just stay there. Find a different goal to focus on that isn't rankings. I'm working on getting every character up to level 50 to get the teachables unlocked. I also aim to play aggressively altruistic every game and help as much as I can, not to survive myself.
---
Oh shit that's right.
---
Does this mean that if I haven't gotten to those perks in other survivors' bloodweb, they won't appear?
---
I have a level 40 Feng, but she didn't have any of those perks by the time I got through all her unteachables, are they still in her bloodweb or are they locked for her (and possibly other survs) until I get them from Bill?
---
Honestly there are so many ways to gain and lose points that cause the emblem system to be extremely unreliable and inconsistent, hopefully they find a better way to deal with ranking soon
---
Itd still play ps4 games. But I'm sure theyll remaster it somehow
---
I remember I crouched one time at a pallet stun cause I wasnt used to the keyboard, and the killer proceeded to face camp me on hook rest of the game
---
Kill rushing is just doing the objective, please don't take it personally it's just about efficiency. Like how you don't go running around and 99% each gen instead of popping them because the match is going too fast for the killer, it's silly to expect the same from your opponent.
---
P3 Neas are pretty cool. They're quite frightening to go against when playing killer
---
Survive with friends
---
I bought it a long time ago but i got a good discount for buying both at once.
---
But the Clown LITERALLY was a clown, and Pennywise is an interdimensional being.
---
The token is just the bloody clothing
---
Id rather just wait a little bit longer for someone not using me as bait to come grab me. If I was on the last few seconds of struggle before death, then I get it, but ya boii was fresh on the second hook. I was even fresh on the first hook when he did it to me the first time.
---
See....that right there.... Is an AMAZING argument, as IF you grind for the month of 2 each rift is available you SAVE Auric Cells overall maybe he meant to put his Post under Shitpost/meme instead of Rant.
---
honestly ds istnt an issue if you don't tunnel and as for body blocks iron grasp and mad grit usually work
---
A lot of things can be seen as unfair to either party in this game, it depends on the individual. As long as people aren't rude or trying to sway others to think the same way they do we could have more discussions, unfortunately its usually seen as one against the other. I appreciate the conversation, I hope you have a good day.
---
Its been around since at least Halo on Xbox...
---
If you‚Äôre getting 32k or close in bp a match, that means you need that 4K
---
Just enjoy the game.  There's little in this game more satisfying on Survivors end than running a killer for every gen.  I'll gladly eat a safety or depip anytime I manage to pull that off.
---
No, the issue is gen times. As well as additional objectives... not huge maps.  
---
"Every map has bad loops" True. But some maps have quite a few of said bad loops than others (The Game, for starters).  
---
Hawkins is especially guilty in this regard. The 2nd floor of Hawkins is one of the worst areas to loop a Killer in the entirety of Dead by Daylight. Hawkins has the Balanced Landing rooms, but those only get you so far.  
---
This game does not have enough ways to break chase. There are lots of aura perks and tracking perks that have been introduced over time. Which make it hard to sneak around. Hence why most Survivors resort to looping when detected.  
---
Killers need buffs in general (especially to counter loopers or apply gen pressure, most killers need at least one proficiency in these two) while Survivors need very specific generator-related nerfs, as the current meta is genrushing and they get their objectives done far too quickly if they are playing optimally. There also needs to be a counter to "4 Survivors running all over and doing gens while Killer is drowning in every single action Survivors do". Killers don't even get a chance to play the game because Survivors know too much. Your only chance to win this is a 3 gen checkmate and even then that can prove impossible.  
---
A mori can help stop a elite Survivor team if you can manage to get one of them moried. The game should become a LOT more controllable if it's 3 Survivors instead of 4.  
---
Also... elementary school insults? Really? Respond when you have some better material, Einstein.
---
You are wrong
---
pig just got buffed wtf
---
Head On? Head on????? 
---
jesus are people seriously bitching about head on now?
---
Stfu
---
Look for crows landing in a place you haven't walked through yet. They return like 30 seconds after being disturbed. 
---
Spys from the shadows give alerts from disturbed crows.
---
My suggestion to punish the hostage taker is to slug them and let them bleed out on the ground instead of hooking them, so that they have time wasted or DC and lose points
---
Even Anna?
---
I personally like Ruin, Thana, Dying Light, Thrilling tremors or sloppy butcher
---
His model doesn‚Äôt change at all. I thought his belly might shrink, but no. It is quite funny to see him sadly laugh after freeing himself from a trap though. I think I‚Äôll make a large post showing all the killers stepping into traps
---
Those types of people should have their accounts deleted, fuck
---
Not enough competition in The game without the teabag? You weren't already going to run for your life?
---
It happened to me once today, yeah.
---
What a well timed escape. The panache!
---
Yes! Happened to me six times yesterday on Xbox.
---
i was making a joke of my own,
---
/r/woooosh
---
I‚Äôm not sure why they haven‚Äôt cashed in on mori animations yet.
---
I‚Äôm not complaining. In fact I literally said nothing about camping so don‚Äôt try to twist my words to fit your narrative. I‚Äôm just saying it‚Äôs silly to complain about the other sides objective.
---
As far as camping I‚Äôve never seen a decent killer go out of their way to face camp. It‚Äôs always the new ones. But they don‚Äôt know any better I guess? It‚Äôs like the bad survivors that are too afraid to work on gens after one hook.
---
Yeah i myself am a survivor main. Im pretty new to the game still but anytime i play killer for a daily ritual or something i always get people who t-bag me. It always feels good when you have someone who t-bags you after stunning you with a pallet or something and thrn they end up dying.
---
I mean it sucks but thats why you run DS. I have no idea why you wouldnt run it solo.
---
*teabag survivor next to me at start of match, they don't teabag in return*
---
Guess I won't sacrifice myself for you.
---
I honestly don‚Äôt understand how shit talking helps one‚Äôs ego. If anything that ruins the ego. I guess it‚Äôs the feeling of ‚ÄúI said that and you can‚Äôt say nothin because I beat you‚Äù? I don‚Äôt understand tbh.
---
Thanks! Yeah, she‚Äôs definitely got balls to go steal Bills things
---
Not unless it's optional. Controller and mouse are way too different in DBD to make it an even playing field, but PS4 and Xbox cross play would be a good way to increase the player pool.
---
I was running a 3man. The troll was just always the closest to me when i was hooked üôÉ
---
Additionally, I don't own the Michael Myers pack
---
Aw I wish he changed a little but I can't wait to see that post.
---
Oh HELL yes
---
Well... you can't exactly say everyone should do this or that, but you're not entirely wrong. It helps a lot, that's why i watch mostly people playing killer, since i play only survivor. Why? I'm too soft. I can't sacrifice a single survivor, not even the toxic ones :c when i have to do a daily i just play normally, but always remember who's dead on next hook so i wouldn't accidentally kill them. I feel so bad when nobody rescues, and the person dies. So, yeah... no. I'm not playing killer :D
---
Perhaps we can wooooosh together
---
I don't like watching survivor gameplay since its usually either boring or toxic but to each their own
---
What a dumbass
---
Tunnel, Camp, NoEd, Ruin, Haunted Grounds, BBQ
---
thanks!!
---
I appreciate it, free points.
---
Where do you go to check how many hours played
---
Edit: Or is that pc?
---
Yeah that's the idea, no problem, good luck with your games :)
---
Is this the beginning clip from Desinc or did you just make your own? Either way, funny meme.
---
I think lithe can be really helpful. Just make a point of looking for your vault escape route whenever you start a gen.
---
Yeah it sucks!

Trying to hit some who's 360ing with a mouse while you're using a controller would be basically impossible if they're at all good at it.
---
Doc looks like a bottom and I‚Äôm okay with that
---
well its like technically her skill cap is high but the problem is that its not hard to learn and you don't need the highest part of the cap to be effective
---
I was playing with my friend who‚Äôs a killer main and he was yelling ‚Äúcome on killer I‚Äôm teabagging and right here why won‚Äôt you go after me?!‚Äù And without hesitation I said ‚Äúbro you ARE a killer main. Quit acting like an entitled baity survivor.‚Äù

\&gt;In the process, we‚Äôve also made¬†a few adjustments made to her base power.¬†Previously, the¬†Nurse could double blink, go through fatigue, then immediately double blink again.¬†This did not leave the Survivors with much of an opportunity to break line of sight. A recharge mechanic for blink charges has been added to limit how quickly she can perform multiple blinks. Rather than immediately receiving all her blink charges following fatigue, she will instead¬†regain charges one at a time. Each charge takes three seconds¬†starting from the beginning of her fatigue. This time can be reduced through add-ons

The Doc cosmetic makes sense.  His entire design was basically straight ripped from one of Pinheads Cenobites from a later Hellraiser sequel.  If anyone isn't familiar Google Image "Surgeon Cenobite".  The face is 100% from him.
---
Yeah, it happened to me a few times earlier.

He could be a bratty bottom :)

*Sips tea vigorously* Aight.. kid imma need you to take out the Dead by Daylight Disc and insert the Call of Duty One(of your choice) play that for a bit and bam, the entity will give you a token in THAT game! Amazing right? Now go buy yourself a perk with that token. :D
---
I like the idea of there being a fourth section of customization in the shop for each killer to have mori's. Even if they don't get that many, it's another great way to individualize the player.
---
I only hate Legion from a design standpoint.
---
YES THAT‚ÄôS WHY WE NEED BDSM GOTH COSMETIC FOR THE DOCTOR
---
I really don‚Äôt understand the survivors who teabag before they even know the killer‚Äôs skill. Kind of tells me they want to teabag more than play the game. Lol
---
There isn't even a map in the next chapter. Unless it's a teleport. I'm still pretty skeptical.
---
Same here. I want more Stealth killers.
---
JESUS 6 posts in a row?! Much Respect for the activity man!

Wouldn't be outside the realm of DBDs general buggy air, but damn that's not an ideal clipping issue to have live.

Sorta why I love DBD so much though.

No i dont know why but now i own the pig and i didnt bought it
---
You‚Äôll have to hit lvl 30/35/40 to get his perks
---
I'm a survivor main and I VERY rarely DC. It's a game based on a classic horror slasher vibe. I'm okay going into a game and just getting absolutely ruined sometimes. People don't have to win every game. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I rocked Than/Sloppy/Ruin/Pop on the game and I was pretty successful, though I have to wonder if I'm being a little too nice. I keep two hooking everyone and then people start escaping, and I'm wondering if I should just one hook and then focus someone down more often. Or if maybe I'm not slugging in general enough? 
---
Most matches I'm sure there's room for improvement, but I don't miss many swings, if any, so I guess my mind games are bad? I'm at a point where in the old system the good matches would make up for it, but since I'm not getting double pips the way I used to, I just can't get out of what I'd call rank 4.5. I really try to pinpoint where I'm fucking up in a match, and as of late I'm just scratching my head.
---
I mean, we got OG Ghostface without there seeming to be any breakthrough in the license, so it's possible they're able to, but they're just waiting or something. They might think it'd be too jarring to have a character that can have multiple ages, which could be why we don't have a mature Laurie cosmetic either.
---
That extra key usage is godlike
---
Yeah pretty much. Time to grind even more bp
---
But you can choose to buy the pass once you have completed the rift, meaning you'll automatically unlock all the content on the premium track. This allows people to judge whether or not they can continue to finish the rift in the time they normally play. There is literally zero risk for those who are smart. The devs are not trying to pull any bullshit tactics like EA or Activision.
---
I think it really works on both sides.  Without a doubt, there are *a lot of survivors* who are just toxic assholes.  
---
But damn man, there are so many killers who are on the same level.  I mean, there's a reason why decisive strike is one of the most common meta perks.  I've been in so many matches in which the killer does one or all of the following:
---
1.  Slashes me while I'm already on the hook for no reason
---
2.  Tunnels me for no reason
---
3.  Camps me through all phases, effectively taking me out of the game and denying me points/pips for no reason.
---
Every time I've ever talked to these killers they're super proud of themselves, and they actually hope that I'm upset.
---
So when a killer does any of those things I switch to full toxic mode.  Also, if I find out they used NOED I'll teabag at the exit gate.
---
Yeah honestly all it requires is a headset with her.  Even if you aren't good enough to successfully hit them clean directly out of the phase you'll be so close to them you'll still get the hit a few seconds later regardless since without Iron Will it's impossible to lose a Spirit with a headset once they have a hit on you.  Full health she has counterplay but once she can hear your grunts of pain it's over.
---
I dunno.. paying 70 euros worth of virtual make-belief stuff for a bunch of characters that I'll never play (Default Dwight for liiiife).. I'll never see the value of it.

I really like how well Ghostface's fits him, but I'm also biased towards him.
---
This happens too often. If a chase is coming to an end and I have nowhere to loop or whatever, I'll usually stop running and turn around to nod at the killer because it's fun if they just nod back and look for other survivors lol 
---
Last night, I was in a game where this happened so I turned around and the killer and I both stopped and looked at each other. I dropped my toolbox as a peace offering, but they thought it was a crouch and they mori'd me, called me toxic, and said I was just going to DS and run for the hatch. I just wanted to go out on friendly terms D':
---
Pc
---
Edit: spelling
---
Had a Jake once trying to get me to chase him around but I knew he had an instaheal so I was waiting for my Make Your Choice to hit him so I didn't have to deal with him and just patrol gens. MYC finally gets him, and as I'm wiping my drill (cause Pig), he gets instahealed with a syringe and tbags at me. So of course, you tbag for something you didn't even do yourself, you're gonna get chased. I IMMEDIATELY hit him, he runs off, waits for me to get close then uses his own instaheal and tbags AGAIN. Did I mention they only did 2 gens? Needless to say, I used my Cypress on him, after giving him a taste of his own medicine. Don't tbag a killer that can tbag back, kiddos
---
I did on ps4 for Final Fantasy XIV. But I don‚Äôt think it works for dbd, and also, you‚Äôre right.
---
That‚Äôs not true, I don‚Äôt know why he said that.
---
You get 2 blinks base, and they‚Äôre on a charge system now. 
---
You recharge 1 blink at a time and they recharge at a rate of 3 seconds per blink. The recharge starts when fatigue starts, so by the time fatigue is over with you already have 1 blink back. 
---
Instead of being able to double blink right out of fatigue - you have to wait about 3.5 seconds to double blink again. 
---
That‚Äôs what they did to her base, at least. It‚Äôs different with addons obviously.
---
It can be funny at times but I feel like too many people try to oversell the hype at times. They want their moment to be golden but it‚Äôs just like maybe a silver. Maybe even a bronze moment.
---
Pretty sure it's Odin..... with the crows and all....
---
They didn't even bother to change his profession lol!  They could have at least made him a Florist or something.
---
Why not just have fun and use the time you spend playing as a grinding method? It is ok to drop down a rank or 2 if you don't use any overly broken perks, the new guys need a chance too, just my opinion on it, ik at purple and red ranks it's just not as fun half to time as either everyone is a potato or a Celestial Power which came From Tru3Talent to shred every ounce of strength which keeps you playing DbD.. I feel it on a personal level, so I drop down a level and a half occasionally and use Wheel Decide to decide my perks and playstyle while I'm re-ranking up and I have a blast.  
---
Edit: See...the anxiety part changes how I look at this, this method may help but playing a different game for a bit may be more consistent, as Mathieu says, "Go play some Civilization 5 or something"
---
Oh that explains a lot. So you have to cleanse both in order for it to be the normal 2 hits?
---
That actually is a valid statement
---
Really?
---
So pretty much P2P was better for me than dedicated servers, if i had 50 ping on P2P connection then those stuff would never happen.. lol BHVR is at it again with screwing up the game x)
---
Or you're so busy looking back at Ghostface to try and reveal him that you don't see Michael walking towards you with his hand open.
---
why not? it‚Äôs free bp
---
Oink!

How does that work
---
Thank you Mr. Pumpkin.
---
No0b3 begs to differ.
---
I‚Äôve played 3 game since I got Steve to lvl 50 and I do have the scoops ahoy skin bc im not a scrub...
---
First game was normal, second game I got tunneled and third game the killer let me get hatch...
---
It‚Äôs kinda all over the place and as a rank 8/9 killer I‚Äôll let them escape if they aren‚Äôt emoting and are altruistic during the game but aren‚Äôt complete ass.
---
Again, DBD logic is wack. A survivor suddenly recovers from being mortally wounded and crippled, because they were grabbed by the shoulder, because they wiggled hard enough. It doesn't make sense and never will, but if it did, it would be a very unfun game (see: Friday the 13th)
---
Ah, thank you!

I feel to fix the teabagging problem devs need to put a 5-9s cool down on crouching. Then survivors will value crouching instead of teabagging.
---
Agreed.
---
&gt;lol, teabagging doesn't actually do anything
---
If it doesn't do anything then theres nothing wrong with it, no?
---
Pennywise would love to be in the entinity's realm.  It would be like an ever lasting Thanksgiving for him

When I was first looking into the game before buying it, (This past July-ish) the first Youtube channels that I could find were always toxic gameplay stuff, so when I started playing, that was just what I assumed the game's 'culture' was like, so I did it too. Glad I figured out that nobody likes that real quick.
---
I have a friend who plays both but he‚Äôs pretty entitled to winning every game. Some people are just blindly entitled tbh. A lot of people have misused the word toxic so much they think it‚Äôs just toxic if they lose.
---
Totally agree wit you! The Doctor is really good at torture people in his lore, and EVEN in the game lol
---
YES GOTH HUNTRESS!!!!!
---
Good way to look at it, I guess in the lore they could make it where it‚Äôs a proposal from the entity to penny either way though, if they do it right then awesome but for now let‚Äôs have a couple original killers
---
The only part I'm upset about on this post is the,"He Fits" cause he just don't, it CAN work, but he don't fit properly, so many people already brought up the fact him and the entity are of similar power so to have an immortal being controlling an immortal being makes little to no sense.
---
I pay ten dollars to get my ten dollars back *and* an assload of cool cosmetics? Holy shit, man! BHVR is basically EA!
---
Shit 100 is generous
---
Not anymore lol.  But Pre Pallet Vacuum removal shhhhhhiiiiiiiiiiiit.  I was the Coldwind King lol!  God damn it was so mindless to loop back then.  At this point to run a killer that long they have to have played horribly and committed mistake after mistake.
---
I'd like to see some original killers too
---
Then don't buy it.
---
Always love when this vid makes a go around again.
---
Upvoted.
---
Just treat every game like they run it, it's a very commonly used perk.
---
I dont know about you guys but this seems like prime  /r/Gamingcirclejerk material to me.
---
If any of you consider this to be made seriously, maybe the OP could replace the image with Jesus Christ crucified and a big sign that says "Killers only play for your fun", you know, in case this needs to be more subtle.
---
Lol I remember when I got my first red rank and I figured out that everyone in red rank thinks they‚Äôre the best at this game. Couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth though.
---
And they followed Tony Hawk. And they followed TWD. And they followed a lot of other famous people/works of art. Doesn‚Äôt mean everyone is going into DBD. Sorry to burst your bubble but it‚Äôs not happening
---
I think the nurse rework is pretty solid and at least she wasn't nerfed to the point of being unplayable
---
Mad grit and Iron Maiden
---
Ohhhh
---
"Just break the pallet."
---
Yep.  I've had matches with teammates who were beyond all doubt trying to get me killed.  
---
I've even had teammates spam flashlights and teabag me as another survivor.
---
Congrats!

The big ass open area in the sewer with all the bodies and shit floating around was a pretty memorable scene if you ask me

I don't mean this in a offensive manner, but Greta is autistic and a child. It is known that she has real issues, mentally. Info about her parents has come out, as well as Greta. She doesn't even know what she's saying... literally: [https://bubbascal.tumblr.com/post/188199955645](https://bubbascal.tumblr.com/post/188199955645)
---
I'm somewhat worried about Greta, and angry with her parents for letting her be used for fame.  
---
USADave is also a high karma Redditor so they probably have leftist values. My ":&gt;" was aimed at them for supporting the puppetmasters behind Greta, who are using her as a tool for their agendas.
---
I'm gonna get hate for this, but their is something euphoric about being able to make someone throw a game through a simple gesture.
---
the rifts have 2 tracks, a free track and a paid track, the paid track costs 1000 auric cells, and also includes 1000 auric cells, paying for itself.
---
*sigh* I used to be more optimal, I've played too much survivor lately and I think it's caused me to overtax myself. I gotta unmix my salad XD
---
Thanks! I finaly started trapping pallets and windows and it just came to me.
---
No thanks.
---
Congratulations! May you get many merciless victories in the future!
---
Memorable ‚â† iconic
---
Yes, before each tier gave shorter aura distance, now all tiers are the same distance of detection (40 meters)
---
It doesn't do anything in game. It doesn't prevent the killer from playing. That doesn't mean it's not a mean thing to do.
---
They dont and they also wont. BBQ would literally never see play if it werent for the bloodpoint boost.
---
All you're really saying is you guys are stupid, and then got butthurt when he pointed out how stupid y'all are. Just saying, don't be so butthurt off a comment with no context next time.
---
It‚Äôs just like how Nancy and Steve are in the game but in the show at the same time.  I don‚Äôt think any of it is cannon they just took people from a show people liked and put it in the game
---
Honestly I haven't bought any survivors they all are characters I don't really like from the franchise. But if you bring in my Boy Scoobs I'mma pre order a freaking chapter
---
I feel like BHVR went full panic-mode once they realized you could just moonwalk exploit his whole power at launch, and just very hastily threw together the Legion we have today to try and save face.
---
His power sucks. ‚ÄòMend‚Äô not draining inside the Terror Radius is the most underwhelming status effect ever. The speed reduction to Feral Frenzy/Vaults makes you just BARELY faster than a running Survivor. The whole ‚Äúchain together a bunch of stabs and go after the weak ones‚Äù doesn‚Äôt work on most matches, and constantly holding M1 to heal as a Survivor isn‚Äôt fun.
---
I assume Legion is now the new Freddy, and that we‚Äôll hopefully get a rework down the line. The only real viable use for Legion is to be paired with Thanataphobia/Sloppy/Dying Light, and even then it barely effects the game.
---
Thanks man now excuse me I need to get by so I can walk through that tall grass over there
---
Butt dancing yall. You cant tea bag in dbd unless the killer murders you and stand over your corpse. Unless you‚Äôre just tea bagging air like a virgin.

I thought he was gonna go pick up his teammate. I got a Baby Dwight Mind Set I guess.
---
I am a solo survivor main, so most people on this sub do in fact just overlook my "pain" since I don't matter compared to the mighty SWF teams that steamroll and bully killers, who then proceed to continue the cycle by bringing moris, omega blinks, prayer beads and iri hatchets the next match to bully me as a solo player because someone else was an asshole :c
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned if it‚Äôs a tactic or perk that helps you win that‚Äôs fine. Shit like tea bagging, cockiness, and showing off just pisses me off.
---
I had a Micheal Myers who chased me on the Asylum map, Clown‚Äôs version. The chase went on till last gen until he lost me. He eventually got someone down and hooked them.
---
Pretty roundabout way of saying "no u"
---
I had an idea for a doctor mori thats basically similar to the original but instead its like he lifts the survivors head up an impales them with "the stick" through the mouth and electrocutes the weapon causing the entire body to get fried.
---
Fungoose or Otz? Cuz Fungoose "mained" clown until plague came out
---
So I try to avoid running unless I know FOR SURE that the killer is on me, or if I know he's far away. When I use Spinechill and it lights up, I will quickly walk away from the gen, crouch and hide nearby and rotate the camera until I can spot them. Running shows tracks and makes noise. The speed perks are honestly up to your play style. Balanced Landing can be good for maps like The Game, Haddonfield Lane, anything where you can drop down easily. Lithe works pretty well if you're looking for your exit strategy before you start a gen. Sprint Burst is good if you can quickly get out of view and hide, but I'd you just zoom straight ahead in an open area, the killer can still see you and catch up no problem
---
This is why AFK Crows need an update
---
5+ minutes without making any reasonable progress on anything? Permanent AFK Crow for the rest of the match.
---
If the Killer seriously has to entirely drop their job and comb through the map to find one of the two Survivors playing Immersive Simulator so they can force the match to an end with the hatch then the Survivors clearly gave up and the match doesn't need to go on any longer.

Oh wow I didn‚Äôt know. And how‚Äôs that work if you already have some perks unlocked? I.e. have one level of left behind, can you still get the last 2 through the web or have to do it the normal way now?
---
Go in a locker, hide behind a gen, or fake direction for a few seconds. Unless they‚Äôre using Billy or Spirit, even if you do none of those, you should have plenty of time to change positions. 
---
BHVR put in a fair perk to help reduce camping, BBQ is fine.
---
Congratulations, my first 4k was against a bunch of high ranks before they fixed that issue.

---
It‚Äôs all random. Sometimes you‚Äôll get it early, sometimes you‚Äôll get it late.
---
Or I just couldn‚Äôt be arsed to care about how someone I‚Äôll never meet feels over the internet. If crouching rapidly at the exit gate hurts your feelings, then I think you‚Äôre the one who needs help.
---
What for?
---
I agree in principal but streamers can be legit hilarious so its complicated
---
Sauce pls
---
First of all,grammar. Second of all, it‚Äôs completely up to chance for what you get in your bloodweb.
---
Was up "to late" im 13 and they plan on giving it back when im 18 :/
---
It depends on your preference really. If you never intend to use the teachable perks you can ignore them so you're more likely to get the perks you want. Personally I'll never use some perks but I get the teachables anyway just so I have them. As of an update a few weeks ago, more perks spawn in the bloodweb as you level the killer (up to 4 at level 50) so it's not as much of a grind getting the perks you want any more.
---
The only time I say "gg ez" is if I hardcore get dumpstered on and usually follow it up with "jk, good shit" or other bizarre situations where we did not win. I am just trying to laugh it off and meme a little x)
---
Time zones probably throw this off, but it‚Äôs a good idea if they can figure something out.
---
You keep what you have, cannot progress it without getting the teachable from bill. That's my understanding anyway
---
Using Iron + Mad grip combo
---
oh shit you're right
---
okay okay I did and it was really great water but listen now there's this ancient babylonian lady walking around (and she's SMELLY) and every time she sees me she throws up black bile on me and I have no idea what she's been eating but it hits like a ROCK :(
---
I'll tell you how I handle this.  After it becomes clear they definitely aren't interested in so much as touching a gen after like 10 mins of patrolling I just start combing the outskirts of the map and eventually I run into one of these fucks doing nothing.  I down them and slug them while standing there to show them that I can be disrespectful and waste their time too.  I like to pick them up, last possible second walk them over to the hook and drop them to bleedout in front of it.  After this I hope to find and close the hatch against the last one and I'll do the same exact thing to them.  I don't typically encourage BM ever but absolutely fuck anybody that intentionally is playing to hold a game hostage.
---
Damn dude that sucks. I'm 13 too and between sports pressure and school pressure games are my only escape.
---
Anyone got an idea on how to do this on Xbox?
---
That‚Äôs exactly what I did
---
Alright, well there's 12 "generic" killer perks, and each killer has their own 3, so you've a 1/15 chance of seeing the one you want. In your case there's another 11 teachables, so that's a 1/26 chance you'll get what you want - or put another way, 25/26 chance you *don't* get the one you want.
---
* 25/26 \* 24/25 \* 23/24 \* 22/23 = 303600/358800 
---
* = 84.6% chance your perk **won't** appear
---
* = **15.4%** chance your perk **will** appear.
---
Now let's see what happens if you let the teachable sit there, doing nothing:
---
* 25/26 \* 24/25 \* 23/24 = 13800/15600 
---
* = 88.5% chance your perk **won't** appear 
---
* =  **11.5%** chance your perk **will** appear.
---
Alright, so there's better odds when rolling 4 perks - a 3.9% difference in your favour. Let's say you give in and buy the teachable. **The numbers don't change for the killer you bought it on - they already have the perk appearing in their Bloodweb**. They still have a 15.4% chance of getting a perk you want if they're rolling 4 perks per Bloodweb. It'll only affect *other* killers, and it'll do so like this -
---
* 26/**27** \* 25/26 \* 24/25 \* 23/24 = 358800/421200
---
* = 85.2% chance your perk **won't** appear
---
* = **14.8%** chance your perk **will** appear.
---
In your case your other killers go from a 15.4% chance to a 14.8% chance of getting a perk you want. 0.6% difference, I don't believe you'll notice that.
---
**TL;DR - Buying the teachable improves your chances of getting a nice perk on the killer you're currently grinding, sliiiightly reduces your chances on any other killer.**
---
you were probably camped for that weren't you?
---
Same
---
Meg, Claduette or Jake
---
Y'all are delusionals, next killer is The Nemesis for sure, will be the first killer with a fire weapon (Rocket launcher), survivor is going to be Jill Valentine from Resident evil and she will be able to mori the killer though.

I just joined the game and I know the game has more of a psycho/horror killer vibe, but I think it'd be pretty neat for them to release some classic monsters like Dracula, The Werewolf, etc.

You don't get your 10 dollars back, you get your 1000 auric cells back. I'm also not saying anything about BHVR being a bad company or hating on thw pattlepass, I'm just saying that it's a system that psychologically manipulates you into buying the pass. 
---
I know that I wouldn't get any of these cosmetics if they just showed up in the store, however, I'm sure I'll buy the battlepass because I'm susceptible to psychological manipularion. It's only 10 dollars, doesn't matter all that much and the cosmetics do look cool, but that still doesn't change that it's designed to be psychologically manipulaying

I didn't even get an "end game" screen.... :(
---
was sarcasm
---
Only if you complete everything. We don't  even know if that's  doable
---
Soon I hope
---
That's true with so many players it's bound to happen, the Killers will never find us
---
We already have a nurse, and she is being crippled as we speak! We dont need the whole ward!
---
^(.A flock of nurses is called a ward, the more you know.)
---
This. Legion isn‚Äôt TERRIBLE, because I mean, as long as you have good Chase skills or use Spirit Fury+Enduring, you have a much better chance to win. 
---
His whole Power is basically ‚Äúinjure as many Survivors in an area as possible, make them seperate to mend, and chase after the slower ones.‚Äù Which is actually pretty good. 
---
The problem is just that higher Rank Survivors don‚Äôt give a shit. They won‚Äôt heal, they‚Äôll loop you forever while injured and bleeding, and they won‚Äôt even panic while in Deep Wounds because they‚Äôll just follow inside your Terror Radius.
---
That‚Äôs what heroes do.
---
That's too young my homie. Your brain is still developing. Best to leave that stuff till after 18-ish.
---
You will thank yourself a billion times over for waiting it out.
---
If you can heal 6 times in a match without dying and being a useful part of the team the go ahead and have MoM twice
---
Flashlights are the only thing that will make me tunnel someone as a killer.
---
So you decided to blind me after dropping that pallet, huh?
---
I GUESS YOU ARE MY MAIN OBJECTIVE NOW
---
Me watching my mom buying halo when I was a kid
---
Did you escape?
---
I'd love having double BP for first 30 minutes like CTR or like first 2 games. Wouldn't fuck with weekend queue times as much
---
Lol you should be happy if survivors are wasting their time trying to flashlight you.
---
Pig is Undetectable while crouching now, making perks like Object of Obsession not work against her while stealthed.
---
Yeah, the straw man arguments are out in force already.
---
What? Clowns perks are amazing! Id leave out the Plague
---
I just read the other comments and if you are picking one to leave out I definietly suggest Plague or Clown as you will likely have enough shards for them once you level everyone else.
---
Plague probably has the lower value perks but that's debatable depending on how you play killer.
---
I putting money on The Walking Dead DLC.
---
she is her own society if u really think about it
---
Daytime like 5 mins and night its instant but depends on Region
---
Depends on the connection of your opponent to the server, but yes, in the vast majority of cases the latency in a dedicated server environment is higher than in a peer-to-peer environment, often considerably so.
---
Again, with server-sided hit detection or at least lag-compensated hit validation, dedicated servers would be more fair than P2P where the host has a flat advantage, but unfortunately we still appear to have killer-sided (literally and figuratively) hit registration.
---
2-3 minutes of switch version but after reaching purple ranks it has started taking around 3-5
---
or right, actually forgot PGtW was his, was thinking he just had bamboozle which is similar in power to corrupt intervention IMO, yeah clown isn't a good choice for being left out
---
Mettle of Man don't work, Jon.
---
body blocking "ruin"

---
Unbreakable is pretty good, and last week had alert, which is also pretty good.
---
same with 90% of killers
---
This is the best answer I've ever seen on this thread. Hats off to you.
---
There is no chat on console so I don‚Äôt have to worry about this
---
Or another way to phrase what you said: "People who dissagreed with what I wanted are potatoes."
---
Niche perks. Not that great.
---
It‚Äôs saves automatically no need to worry bud
---
saves automatically, not sure what the issue is but probably just the system saving the data incorrectly
---
Ooh yeah, first 2 games sounds perfect
---
It's great on switch.
---
The frame rate is consistent on handheld and only has minor hiccups when docked.
---
The graphics are the only issue but they look fine when unlocked because of the smaller screen.
---
The only major glitch is that after the game ends you might have to wait an extra 20 seconds if the killer Insta leaves.
---
Survivors are all basically just different skins. While they have unique base perks though you can make it so they are available for all  survivors. If you want a good starting survivor I would recommend Feng Min. She has some of the best starting survivor perks in the game. Alert is great for tracking the killer through the match and learning how safe an area is and if pallets are being burnt through. Technician is a bit shit on in this sub but it helps to learn the timing of the skill checks. Also most killers rely on sound for the first part of the game to try and find survivors on gens so the sound reduction can make it so a killer ignores you in the early game. Then there is Lithe which is one of my favorite exhaustion perks in the game. It is useful on almost every map in the game and is almost impossible to accidentally trigger. 
---
As you learn more perks pick who you like the most and focus on getting the perks you want on them. Currently my two most common builds are: 
---
Inner Strength (Nancy) ; Iron Will (Jake), Spine Chill, and  Lithe (Feng)
---
Second Wind (Steve) ;  Bond (Dwight); Prove Thyself (Dwight); Distortion (Jeff)
---
Good question! It‚Äôs the second option. NOED only activates if there is a dull totem available, and Hex perks can only be attached to one totem
---
NOED requires a dull totem specifically so if there is just hex totems remaining it will not activate
---
I so hope you FRIGGIN burn... you're a FRIGGIN heathen that needs to be absolved for your online bullying of the mental incapable (me) I'm soooooo friggin heated like a menstrual cycle right now, u don't even FRIGGIN no..I hope you Friggin evaporate yourself like the jizz from your scrotum...HOW DARE YOU!!!!!!!
---
The last totem becomes noed only if it‚Äôs dull, otherwise it doesn‚Äôt activate
---
Back when this game was extremely unbalanced (all they need to do is fix Mori's and spirit and then the games pretty good) People seemed toxic because they had all this power over the killer. Killers seem toxic now because they have alot more power over the survivors. It's pretty intriguing honestly.
---
It won‚Äôt activate I think. Since it‚Äôs a hex totem a hex has already been placed on it so it won‚Äôt make room for another. It must be a blank totem for noed to work
---
If all dull totems are done except one hex than NOED will not activate.
---
Every hex perk is assigned to their own totem.
---
üôä
---
I want an original killer as the next standalone, and then a full pennywise chapter as the next. This probably won‚Äôt happen, but it would be cool.
---
Most perks are niche, just because a perk is more situationally useful than Spine Chill or Ruin don't make them bad perks by any means.
---
My progress for the past 6 hours is gone. I play on Xbox
---
Same thing with my friend
---
Most survivor perks are niche*
---
Yes, it is. Pig is mid/high tier. Clown is mid/low tier, that's the difference between them. That doesn't mean you can't do well with trapper or wraith also low tier. I'm rank 1, yesterday I played 2 games with trapper with 4 red ranks and got 4k and 3k. That doesn't mean that trapper is top tier. I'm just a good player and those survivors made mistakes that allowed me to win. The mindset is: which killer is less dependent of survivor mistakes? You can think its clown over pig but it isn't. Pig has many more resources that require your skill to outsmart survivor. Plus she has a built in game slow down. The tonic instead is easily counterable in red ranks unless the survivor make a mistake and even if, you must make a perfect game to profit all survivors mistakes.
---
Most perks in general are pretty niche, killer perks included. I'd argue that killer perks are more niche because most are only good on certain killers.
---
I don't think that's how it works but you do you, bud
---
Oh I know it's the treatment. It's just weird to see it    :0
---
Probably next year in time for Halloween Kills.
---
Now that‚Äôs more concrete evidence.
---
I could see a meta of one killer being the tracker and the other being the main chaser. You have Killer A run BBQ, Whispers, Spies and any 4th perk like Stridor. Second killer runs STBFL and any chasing or regression perks. They could run a full slowdown build too. Chases end blindingly fast when you can wombo combo any survivor or run into multiple and get fast downs. Killer combos like Doctor + Anyone or Huntress and anyone who gets an easy first hit. I wouldn‚Äôt underestimate 8 killer perks.
---
Sometimes, you can even do things FASTER!
---
Nega-Dwight
---
I know.
---
I think if any killer would 'regain humanity' it would be Legion after growing out of their edgy teen years.
---
Wraith is great, find the obsession, uncloak, start chase, cloak again, repeat until max stacks and in invis you're super fast and outside of it you're still pretty fast. Otzdarva has some really good videos on the perk actually
---
Infectious Fright is amazing on Myers. Tier 3 and everyone gonna be screaming
---
Is this a leaked huntress cosmetic?
---
Just played against one that was running Ruin, Pop, Discordance, Haunted Ground, all tier 3. No fun allowed. Downed the entire non-SWF group before even a single gen got done.
---
Acting like mad grit isnt the best perk in the game
---
Isn't that just 4-6 games a day?
---
Also don't the challanges slightly boost the progress?
---
Also you get reimbursed.
---
Where is the downside?!?!?
---
I still think hes better than bubba and wraith
---
Isnt vigo estimated to be a killer?
---
It really helps lol. If you want to be nice, run behind the unhooked person until you guys are safe and you can heal them. If you want to be mean, you can run behind them til you get the safe unhook thing and then urban evasion your ass away so the killer only has their scratch marks to follow
---
For me when i try to extract it, it just says the files empty?
---
Probably
---
Agitation buff
---
You actually got a good angle for that mori!
---
Lmao no one would go for saves
---
yeah and forgot to mention wraith,but speed isnt really wraiths problem to  begin  with
---
Pop goes the weasel instead of noed and that's my build for every killer if I can't get a killer specific build like totems for spirit or basement for bubba
---
Mettle of Man changes is one of those things that looks so appealing on paper but it just doesn't actually translate to meaning anything realistically in game.  It's  meme enough trying to get it to proc once with how janky protection hits are.  They should have removed the aura penalty from it as well.  It's weak enough as a perk post rework that it really doesn't still deserve to have any negative effect.
---
Imagine a custom game lab where you can make perk builds for the entire survivor team or public kill your friends or make it where you can ban any type of perk, add ons, or item you want?
---
M&amp;A is never useless unless you are permanently tire 3 but the general build I use is bbq, corrupt intervention, enduring, M&amp;A if I was going to swap M&amp;A it would be spirit fury
---
It‚Äôs not a phase mom!
---
~~Or it can be a new Demogorgan skin~~
---
My window vaults actually work now. They used to teleport me back a step, which screwed me countless times. Loving it.
---
Way ahead of you. I usually do one of those based on how close I think the killer is.
---
 Like if they are already chasing someone or if they are running off the opposite direction already and I know they are I will run after the person but if they are close by I will sneak
---
Should have gone for the person who ran away instead of hooking him
---
"I am no racist, no sexist - as i hate everyone equally." Heard this line from Helsing abridged, if anyone saw it.
---
You are talking about the pig aka amanda
---
you can vary a lot on myers my personal favorite but is map specific is mirrors myers on lerys:  
---
that does run monitor though.
---
My normal build is nothing fancy just for farming/ranking:  
---
Enduring, spirit fury, Ruin and BBQ
---
See I'm not a killer main, usually play survivor if swf, started paying killer just to change it up when my friends aren't online, so I'm rank 20. That might be a reason why it takes a while just cause I've gotta find survivors at similar rank
---
The anination is cool? I prefer the escaped one, thanks
---
Baby billy
---
I know. Everyone's freaking out over the "Multiple Mettle" strat when it's probs going to be useless imo. I just made this as Satire on the community's reaction lmao
---
nah we all know that shit would say ‚ÄúThe Pin Head‚Äù LMAO
---
It takes about 70 hours, so a little under 3 "full" days of gameplay or about an hour a day over its 3 month duration.
---
Considering that I personally play this game for about 2 - 4 hours a day that's a pretty good investment in my book. :)
---
Oh yeah, its big brain time
---
I remember seeing a rank 20 demogorgan, so I ran next to them and crouched up and down to show friendship. 
---
I got face camped right as we opened the gate and they grabbed me out of a locker
---
I try to take losses well, but I admit there are some nights where the first sign of a teabag or a reflection hitting my eyes in a flashlight manner means someone's getting a little company at the hook for the rest of the match.
---
Before endgame was introduced I killed three at five gens the last was a blendatte in the swamp map that hid for 15min
---
Haha! I would have bet anything that it would be The Cenobyte but damn, you are probably right
---
Speediest girl in the west
---
Not the best but certainly they have more knowledge of the game than everyone else
---
Good on you
---
Mind you these are the same assholes that will throw a bitch fit if tunnel them or do similar toxic behavior.
---
No love for young JLC?
---
Since you already have well make it and you cant heal faster than +100% speed that we'll make it gives Id take Botany Knowledge out of that build and replace it with borrowed time. You better be good at looping to go without dead hard...
---
No...
---
Can't you see that she downed me and she didn't even have to move? Literally two mouse clicks and I'm dead from full health. Can they nerf this ducking crutch killer please?
---
2 minutes of ruin would be a godsend.
---
Would you look at that i met that guy too, runnin with a nea pink hair neon clothing that the one?
---
Insta lobby on PS4 24/7!!! 
---
Unless there is a event or bloodhunt then Q times go way up and insta lobby‚Äôs for survivors!!!
---
I‚Äôm just upset about the lying, if they‚Äôd been upfront it would have been received better. They said they weren‚Äôt touching the base power, it was just going to be an add on rework to get rid of the crazy stuff cough5blinkomegacough she could do. Her at base was never an issue but they went back on what they laid out anyway.
---
If you take a hit for someone then it benefits both of you but yeah I see what you're saying.
---
... Except they wouldn't reach out to Netflix about Stranger Things if they weren't okay with making a creature killer...
---
Should I get unbreakable or no mither or just save on for the next few perks
---
No doubt it is an annoyance, especially for the person hooked who essentially depips with little to no bloodpoints. I‚Äôm not saying that facecamping is good, or effective. But, people need to understand the fact that it happens, and when it happens what to do instead of constantly complaining about it while they are stuck farming the survivor, or killing themselves in the situation on the hook thereby hurting their team. Another annoyance, on the killer side, is gen rushing, and there is not really alot the killer can do about that, especially in the higher ranks. At the end of the day we have to realize that this game is a party game, and never will it be esports/whatever you want to call it, viable. These things are going to happen and you gotta take it for what it is and work around it to the best of your ability, have fun if you can. If you get a shit game where you are getting tunneled and facecamped, theres a killer out there thats getting prove thyself, toolbox, and insta heal games where the survivors teabag and bully. There is nothing we can do about that, dats the dbd life.
---
We'll make it and Borrowed Time is the only thing that pops into my head. I guess you can even throw in Botany Knowledge to increase the healing.
---
You know they'd make it like 3 am
---
Damn sorry to hear that but don't fret you'll get better matches sometimes.
---
Ahahahahahahahah I love this ahahah
---
None of those things are really anoying personally I always run franklins and ruin which solves most things a survivor can do and ds has never really struck me at that great
---
Tell that to the mountains of hate messages I get for teabagging and flashlight clicking lol.
---
Once you put a survivor into the dying state(which is easy cuz of tier 3) survivors near the recently downed player reveal their positions by screaming. So, once you down one you can find another instantly. If you play ur cards rights you can get a 4 man down situation
---
That's really cute!
---
They‚Äôre not
---
I‚Äôll dip dip dip dip dive and dodge you fuckers
---
This would make more sense if it was Rancor instead of Devour Hope.
---
Don't you get tired of running the same perks every time? I sure do.
---
its not a bad perk on myers but there are perks which benefit myers alot more ,depending on your play style ofc
---
Oh my god that is amazing, what a chorus of screams!!! I love it.
---
What about Demo?
---
Or you know, exploits, as abusing a glitch is, is a bannable offense and you could not tell people to put their account at risk and play the game as it's meant to be
---
Don't think so, I haven't run into a toxic nea yet
---
yes do what he says.
---
why would DH make you tunnel you have to be pretty far from the hook for the tokens to stack.
---
Thats a matter of opinion if you play in purple/green ranks lol I play red ranks and like to be there all the season. Matter of opinion is which one is more fun to play. Which one is more effective in high red ranks as I am, no, its not a matter of opinion. And I have clown p3 level 50. I like A LOT play with him, just cannot play him 10 games in a row at high ranks.
---
Yeah, that happened to me a couple times as well, and I agree with you on that one! 
---
We should be able to accept when another player has outplayed us whether we are on the killer or on the survivor side
---
Where the fuck is this skin?
---
True, but if you use it you probably want Monitor too for that extra 8m terror radius
---
You and the entity can tag team me, please Daddy
---
WAOW good job, friend!
---
Can I get a desktop background as this? It‚Äôs amazing
---
Alright, I was just making sure.
---
Ghost face ==pig Meyers.
---
Wraith is superior Bing bong boi
---
Preach it!
---
2 minutes? That's a whole game right there! In my last match it was less than 20 seconds and it was gone.
---
That's justified due to stress.
---
Bond/Empathy
---
Borrowed Time
---
Botany Knowledge/We'll Make It
---
Pharmacy
---
lol, playing killer and I was down to 2 survivors.  One was hiding the whole time while the other was actually taking a beating from me.  I started to get pissed and meat shield helped me find scaredy cat.  I tunelled him until he was dead and then led meat shield to the hatch. Fuck that guy
---
I've had good luck healing incredibly quickly with We'll Make It and Botany Knowledge together, but it leaves you as the most vulnerable survivor since the others will likely have better chase perks. I think Bond could be pretty helpful because one of the most helpful things you can do is keep tabs on what the others are doing and maneuver accordingly
---
Poor bean
---
Can someone explain the meme about being Nea is the entity?
---
I wouldn't even sweat double pipping anymore.  I like to take the scenic route to red ranks every reset and give away tons of hatches to prevent the second pip.  I don't know about your experiences but red ranks on PS4 no exaggeration this is roughly the percentages I'm facing keys and instaheals in my lobbies.  
---
Keys - 35%
---
Instaheals - 60%
---
Fucking gross no thank you.  I play the same way you do fair but competitively.  I still get up there but just do my best to slow the climb a bit so I can enjoy a few more games on my way to sweat fest city.
---
Solo players make up [more than 50% of the survivor population](https://us.v-cdn.net/6030815/uploads/719/CPIDC1XE8JBT.jpg)
---
There's a lot of killers I've faced on mobile that has NOED, so I run around looking for totems
---
Burns the flashlight at an absurd rate for no real benefit as it was nerfed a while ago. Flashlight add on meta is double battery/battery with filament :)
---
That's what I would hope for. It allows people who have something come up IRL to not be affected (problem with your pet/kid/spouse/phone call/etc? Leave game and 5-10 minutes later come back and not worry about it without ever seeing a timer)
---
Whereas genuine rage quits will be forced to sit and stew watching it count down.
---
Oh thanks for using my meme
---
Right in the buttock!
---
After playing a Bit of Nurse on PTS, I have no issues with her, still the same overwhelming pressure when in a chase, just less room for error.
---
So I am unsure why people are overreacting so much.
---
No that's from TNG thats shitty get Ladyface from TCM1
---
Oh, that sucks
---
I didn't know it burns it out faster but I don't have enough batteries so I was just putting battery + something and all the other add-ons basically do nothing, this should at least blind longer?
---
Says it slightly increases consumption for tremendous blind duration, unless those are super misleading that doesn't seem bad at least.
---
I'm happy to test the differences with you if you want.
---
Yeah, also who the fuck uses those add ons together on the doctor?!?!?
---
I think Dart was a Demodog, a different species than our killer.
---
Wraith mains? Do people like that exist?
---
That‚Äôs so Dope! Wish we had a option on PS4 for that!
---
Sometimes when I hear that sound is a bonfire or a Hex Totem nearby
---
He shouldn't be able to trap hooks again, but he SHOULD start the game with all his traps and after placing all of them, keep it where he can only carry 1 at a time without addons.
---
Yep ;)
---
I gave you my explination on this topic, i won t say you are wrong, and i won t say you are right. I think pig is more fun to play, but i will remain loyal to maining clown. But If we are talking about red ranks, they both suck. And it also depends on a lot of factors like maps rng. Sometimes you will get 0 or 1 kills in red ranks as pig, but If you played clown you would get 4k, or the other way.
---
Not OP, but someone who as tried to get to this point - Adepts for Killers are the hardest in my experience, especially for some of the weaker killers like Legion or Leatherface. Even for the easier killers, and the ones with more synergistic teachables, get gold or better across the board is very hard on just the three perks.
---
The only reason I have as many as I do is from gaming the system a bit by going for them shortly after monthly reset so that I'm among weaker survivors.
---
A lot of the other achievements are tedious liking having to open X number of chests in the basement or healing a bunch.
---
Glad to see the doc still thicc
---
If ur rank 16 running that ur basically smurfing.
---
I plan on making a video showing all killers stepping into bear traps at some point soon!
---
Noed is just a good perk, why would you teabag? It's the very season I'm using NOED sometimes, because people teabagged me, so you're just creating more hate
---
Dead hard on David. As a rank 1 killer it‚Äôs helped people slip right out of my grasp
---
The nerfs were fine imo, but the addons just feel...strange. At least they're more unique though :)
---
I just do my Job and kill survivors. I don't even camp or anything, I just do my thing. When I need to kick a gen or pallet near a hooked I do that. Than I patrol. When they unhook the one and I'm not chasing someone I'll head over there, no matter how far it is and if the unhooked survivor is the first I see I'll chase him, I have to kill him and I don't give freepasses. But when I see someone else before him or being an easier target I'll chase that survivor. Still I get called toxic for just being a killer and using perks. So many in this community don't understand what toxicity means
---
I know- Michael‚Äôs mere presence is pretty damn sexual.
---
Does slashing people on the hook do anything?
---
Congrats, man! Here's to many more!
---
Damn them, charging Austin Power‚Äôs Mojo
---
By camping you just make it worse for yourself. You could be getting more points, But now you are just waisting time. 
---
Be the better man, don‚Äôt become toxic yourself because someone did it to you. Break the circle!
---
Like Titanfall 2?
---
Titanfall 2 did it, why can‚Äôt DBD
---
The two and their complaints are not equivalent. Survivors are louder and more vocal, and complain about more trivial things (not that there aren't some valid complaints to be made).
---
Source: survivor main
---
Yeah the pig memes are pretty meta apparently
---
Of course there are disadvantages, but everyone's experience is different.
---
It is questionable because it has no actual factual backing.
---
The post was just using factual context that was already there, you made in political by bringing in an opinion.
---
konami is pretty douchy remeber what happend to hideo kojima?
---
Me waving my poop goodbye as it swirls down the toilet.
---
Not bad. I had something else in mind.
---
* You become obsessed with one Survivor. For every 10 seconds that your obsession is in the dying state you receive a token up to a maximum of 4 tokens. Each token grants a movement speed of 3/4/5/6%.
---
Each time your Obsession is healed one state, you lose one token. If your Obsession dies to bleed out or disconnects you lose no tokens.
---
Turns it into a slugger's paradise. Slug, patrol until you see someone then wreck shop with chase after chase. Even if the Obsession is picked up and healed to full, you only lose two tokens. You'll always have a minimum of 3% movement speed all trial, and are not be punished for hitting anybody, obsession or not. You can always be aggressive.
---
If you happen upon the Obsession again, slug, and get your two tokens back then go out and patrol some more. If they don't pick up the Obsession before bleeding out, the last remaining survivors are fucked.
---
Pairs well with Knockout and Infectious Fright.
---
Wait what dbd on mobile?
---
I run BBQ on Legion and Wraith and lemme tell you, it works wonders. Even if they're not in the exact same place as they were when BBQ activated, I still have a general idea of where they are and sometimes that's all I need.
---
The best is when you have Pop or overcharge.
---
Thank you for understanding!
---
It's a Wawa Icee Machines are NEVER down.
---
Ghostfaces: absolute toxic shitlords that'll camp you for no reason and Will teabag you if you make a minor mistake, Bills: noobs that try their hardest honestly nothing bad to say. Demogorgons: poor innocent baby killers that try their best but suck at killer, Aces: either noobs or absolute gods at the game but are insanely toxic or greedy for saves. (Those are just the main stereotypes I see for the killers and survivors that are uncommon not gonna do the common ones as they're known)
---
I was playing doctor and it suddenly became super obvious. More than any other killer. That's what made me make the post
---
I feel a 1 second cool down would be great because then they‚Äôd try and wait the second and give you an advantage in chase lol
---
BHVR doesn't need to buff anyone if they just nerf all the good killers so everyone is terrible.
---
Demodogs are young Demogorgons
---
You got any proof he is?
---
Exactly what I was thinking
---
once you close the game you lose it just letting you know
---
It seems like they didn't unnecessarily care for their rework lmao...

Stonks
---
Doctor and feng main
---
Yeah I agree with most of this. I just wish we'd all stop complaining, and play the game for fun and be nice to each other.
---
Shame that pig memes are meta, everbody loves pig and makes memes about pig, but nobody play pig.
---
Sounds like you go to some bland parties, lol
---
In a way I suppose, but the constant noise of the alarm and not knowing where the killer is (sans OoO) could supply pressure onto the survivor to move away, atleast less experienced survivors. 
---
Perhaps a red or purple add-on which allowed the killer to move faster when someone is within the alarm radius may help to dissuade knowledgeable survivors.
---
I also feel just the granting of game knowledge / survivors current objectives could be powerful, but most likely it's a C tier but fun power.
---
It was all in good jest, sadly this blew up a bit.
---
Ikr, this is how I feel, a month or two ago I heard about them nerfing nurse, heard it was only addons and mentally prepared myself for that, then they come in with a whole basekit nerf aswell
---
Depends which kind of altruism you want to go for. Just general, healing, dehooking ect. My Dwight has a team support build that helps others near him. He's got kindred, leader, streetwise and vigil
---
How do you make it a ps4 background?
---
Punishing survivors for breaking totems just cuz. Since their hex totems you get a notification when  they are cleansed
---
6. T-bag any killer who uses hex ruin.
---
yes all 15 seconds
---
No idea why its been the opposite for me then.
---
Bill will get you unbreakable and borrowed time- both very nice
---
Jake - Iron will is kinda needed in spirit meta
---
I think most downvotes are on my ironic posts and where I stare an opinion that goes against the grain.
---
Overall I do try to be / stay positive. I play this game for fun and try to make it fun for others too, by being nice in and after the game (on or off stream cause god knows that affects people's moods too)
---
Happy cake day bro
---
A worse version of hag?
---
unless they are saying things in end game chat, then it is your fault if you get mad at things like t bagging and flashlighting
---
i really hate that Freddy just ignores BT for free. At least ghostface or wraith have to use their power
---
Petition to make Vault-Tec rep have that skin in game
---
Pink haired Neas are like cockroaches. If you see one, their are definitely more nearby
---
Hardest for me personally was the Nurse 500 blink attack one because I really had to force myself to play her and I hated it (hence why it's one of my last few ones even though she's been out the entire time I've played this game). Hardest in terms skill and everything aligning the right way was probably Left for Dead (pre EGC). You have the activate the 5th gen after everyone else is dead AND open an exit gate. I never got lucky with killers taking pity on me and letting me go, so it was one of my last few survivor ones.
---
I'll be honest, I've never had a hard time with Adepts or that Michael tombstone one everyone hates. I mainly play survivor so when I do play killer my rank is usually yellow or green. I'm not an amazing killer, but I do have the game sense of someone who's played the game alot, so I'm usually better than yellow/green rank survivors making adepts and trickier achievements easier.
---
That ace stereotype is so accurate though
---
CHARATERS
---
You failed still, 20k is a depip if im correct.
---
Waaaaaah!
---
What's a depip?
---
I always wondered what this kid is actually freaking out about...
---
I'm actually a survivor main, and made this in jest. I totally get your annoyance, but I was posting this to also start a dialogue.
---
To try and get people to realise everyone is getting hurt by the toxicity and to try and find a middle ground.
---
Most comments in this thread start out very one sided but I'm seeing a lot of positive as well.
---
Who knows if this was a net positive or not, either way have an excellent day!
---
Now can you do this with The Legion? XD
---
Yeah that's fine, don't worry about it.
---
Hello, yes, I‚Äôll take ‚Äòem both please, where‚Äôs the auric cell receptacle? I‚Äôll pay double if I damn well have to!
---
TAKE ALL MY MONEY!!!!!
---
Yeah, funny how that works right.
---
Either way, both sides help contribute to the overal fun of this game and I hope we can work to a more positive future.
---
No he is a person that died(supposedly he is as he isn't updating his logs), but he made the Survivor guides and figured everything out that he could if the Entitys world, tbf he probably lost his sanity, but he is said to have no intention of giving up as he knows that is what the entity wants to consume him fully, now the main part, he can't be a killer if he doesn't surcumb to the Entitys "Temptations" as although the Entity has supposedly unlimited power it does need to either get an agreement out of them or convince them THEY want to help him, This is the case for almost all the killers, e.g. Amanda was corrupted by Jigsaw(sorry forgot his name) and wanted to carry on his work so the Entity presumably offered her that option in her dying moments and the Spirit was fueled by hatred of her father and wanted revenge, the Entity granted her the power to do that, under the condition she work under it and feed it sacrifices regularly and so got sucked in the Realm after.. that is how I recall the Basic confirmed backstory of the Entity working, they never went REALLY DEEP as the devs want YOU to decide what the Entity is as it is meant to be your worst fears come to fruition. Sorry for the rambling and Congrats to all who read this far. P.S. dont quote me on this, if you are really interested in the backstory I believe it is there somewhere online and if I find it I'll edit this with a link as I haven't read up on DbD lore in MONTHS... 
---
Edit:This is what is known on the Entity so far, sorry for what I got wrong. https://deadbydaylight.fandom.com/wiki/The_Entity 
---

---
&gt; Remember: BHVR wasn‚Äôt founded on DBD, they were already making games before this. 
---
What does this have to do with anything I said?? The team behind DBD is still responsible for the games profit. If the game doesn‚Äôt meet the quota that BHVR set for them then the game can potentially be shut down.
---
**Silence, *Weab***
---
Oh they would cause it‚Äôs massively popular. 
---
They would easily break what they said for that
---
Absolutely! I plan on doing a video with every killer very soon
---
hi. wanted to point out that the free pathway is currently "almost empty" due to the upcoming event. there will be 6 more spaces filled with the event item; Putrid Serum (confirmed).  within reason, to keep player interest, those 6 space most likely will be filled or at least a couple more (unconfirmed though). The PTB was a partial Rift, as the event item was not added yet.
---
also i 100% understand the grind is not for everyone. absolutely valid to not appreciate a system like this. But, if you do find its less grindy than you first though just note that the rift keeps track of the premium side as you unlock the free side. You can see how much you would get at the end of the rift season, and then purchase it if it seems worth it at the end and still get everything from the premium side.
---
The 7000 cells to buy your way to the end is outrageous, but thats not how the rift is meant to be played. it is a grind, and say theres still 3 levels left but the season is ending, you can purchase them if you would like.
---
Just like to side note and say Im not trying to start an argument just offer a countering view. All of this info is taken from the same page you cited too. and yes, cosmetic prices are crazy, nothing to disagree with here, lmao $10 for a 3 piece skin is a little over the top, but i also understand skins are their biggest income and they have a decent sized staff to pay.
---
   Both look amazing good job ! And have fun everyone ‚ù§
---
Never said he was, just asked if you had any proof. After all you seem pretty confident he isn‚Äôt.
---
With the survivor meta, it‚Äôs a lot less than 32 different perks. It‚Äôs more like 8-9 perks across multiple survivors. Even with multiple survivors, it‚Äôs still DS, Exhaustion Perk (6 separate perks), BT and Mettle of Man maybe and Possibly Prove Thyself. Every other survivor perk is more luxury and not really meta. The survivors would have much more to worry about because there are more killer play styles than survivor ones. 
---
Plus they‚Äôd obviously have a secondary objective that‚Äôs non-gen related. Something like laying cables to power the gates specifically, fueling gens to keep them running, or any other specific secondary action that is required to keep the survivors occupied. Hell you could double the totem count and make totems being cleans a mandatory objective and that‚Äôs a lot right there. 
---
I think the chaotic factor would be more appealing than concerning a full meta anyway. 
---
Hell, you could even make it a true 2 v 8 where the survivors goal is to wait out a timer while doing a side objective (many totems) or be the last one alive and the killers objective is scoring more hook events than the other killer. Make it so the time a survivor is on a hook contributes to an End Game Collapse meter so the survivors are incentivized to save each other. There are tons of gameplay options to explore.
---
People disagreed about hatch standoffs, they gave us the collapse. People disagreed about hit box registration, they set up servers. They do listen but some people‚Äôs request are outlandish and don‚Äôt work
---
He died in the fog but "death is not an escape"?
---
Take it! TAKE IT!!
---
I totally agree.
---
I wasn't saying that it wasn't toxic, I was just pointing out sentiment that I hear.
---
Either way, I just hope we as a community can pull together and be more positive Overal.
---
Have a nice day!
---
Neas: CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK CLICK
---
You must not have played on release. Everyone knew about infinites. Juat by watching one person do it 3 people would then know about that infinite. Then more and more. 
---
The whole reason Nurse was made was becuase of infinites.
---
If they weren't common then the Devs wouldnt have fixed it. Just like how Spies was broken for patches. No one used it so Devs didn't know. Devs knew about infinites and how much "skill" they required to do them.
---
Lmfao
---
I didn‚Äôt say it was exclusive to Demo, if I had played as any killer and got bullied/failed to hook anyone then it leaves a bad taste and would discourage me from trying again.  Just my personal experience with Demo
---
I'm gonna put some dirt in your Eye.
---
&gt; Sure, you can sit on a hook while a bubba insidious camps you in the basement and wait to die so others can get out
---
I tried explaining this to friends a while back on the free weekend... Yeah they didn't stick around. I think their words were "So I just sit here and do nothing while he looks at me, what a fun game!"
---
I wasnt stating it wasnt a battlepass, i was saying people are caught up on calling it that and many people give it a negative connotation for the name because of games like Fortnight that popularized the battlepass format. From there other games took it and, as you said, became money hungry and gave 'battlepass' a negative connotation. Many people ive seen shit talking the Rift have said things like; "Just another battlepass" followed up with no reason to hate it.
---
My one friend saw the *charm* that looked like a brand new part and thought that the devs were going to put rare items on the path to make it interesting, he called it a P2W and ive seen others complain that the extra bloodpoints from the archive could be pay to win. (note this was before the full outline of the archives was complete and now we know the blood point reward comes from the free challenges in the tome, not the payment side of things)
---
so far i think BHVR has done a fine job of implementing a battlepass along with the auric cell rebate that you get for unlocking the entire premium side. That being siad you are right again. BHVR can absolutely become predatory, but so far the devs have been very incontact with their playerbase and honestly, were such a passionate bunch about this game that if anything like that happened BHVR would never hear the end of it.
---
blue hair susie is better
---
I‚Äôm thinking on going for Jake but I main Dwight and I use Claudette for my ‚Äúperk builds‚Äù. So I might do Jake then bill.
---
***Julie staring in the background repeatedly whispering ‚Äúi hate this place‚Äù***
---
Slugging is part of the game for both sides, and is viable sometimes. Besides, no one should care about a DCer since they are just a step above hackers as far as I'm concerned and deserve no pity. The day they are all banned is a day that will be great for the game overall.
---
Further.. I specifically mentioned that if someone disconnects that tokens aren't lost. That should be standard for all killer perks which rely on tokens. None should ever be lost to a dc'er.
---
Yet people say she‚Äôs now addon dependent
---
Wraith is best stealth boi don‚Äôt hurt my baby

kramer would let the protector go or both if they cooperated after

If they can't grab you when you go to save it's not camping

---
1. This would be a brilliant April Fools update
---
2. However, once the entity takes someone they no longer exist in our world so it can't take the same person twice
---
They probably won't though knowing how this community acts
---
Actually brain damaged downvotting this obvious joke
---
The sheer irony of Adiris running a laundry shop...
---
on the wiki, it says that if you escape the hook on an escape attempt that would put you into struggle phase if it failed, then your next hook is insta death
---
Whenever I accidentally crouch in my panic to escape, I know its over for me.
---
To be fair, if you hop on DBD expecting a nice time, you're gonna be disappointed.
---
It's 11 days though. I mean, that seems like a fairly standard event length, but that's just me.
---
As a person who spent 1000+ hours in mastering Nurse, the "nerf" doesn't really affect me THAT much, it is harder but if you know how to play her you won't see much difference.
---
I play both sides evenly you entitled, presumptuous piece of shit. I literally just finished a match and got the 4k and max points without going back to the hook once. That's how you apply pressure on survivors and how to actually play the game, sir dumbfuck
---
There's nothing "tactical" about leaving a chase you're already in just to go back for the hook. As for MYC being a perk, it's core design is to entice you to not tunnel the unhook like some desperate virgin chasing pussy. It makes you the bitch. The game is meant to be fun for everyone. That's why you depip and are penalized for playing like a piece of shit and ending matches to fast. That's why you're stuck in green coming on reddit and Facebook talking about how hard it is to play the game. It isn't hard at all. You just suck at it.
---
holy shit this is so good
---
Oof only got as far as Xbox 1
---
It depends on the killer; almost never do it after a chase or if you're about to escape unless it was a farming match, but an easier way to thank the killer is to squat and then look up and down.  That way they know you're nodding rather than tea-bagging
---
If I'm playing with a full group, I'll do it because I know them, I can at least still talk with them while I'm doing nothing. I'll never hold it against another player for leaving or DCing though. Especially solo players.
---
Who tf is excited about the mettle of man change
---
what is this buffoon saying? I only understand jake, can a jake please translate for me
---
The serums look like they are on the early tiers of the rift, so. I imagine at worst you'll have to get to lvl 20 to get all the serum, so. The rift is meant to take 70 days (?) to complete fully, so, 20 to complete the event seems more than doable (assuming your standard 100 level pass).
---
After how dreadful that second movie was I‚Äôd rather not have an It chapter.
---
Let's hope they removed that stupid hatch closing nonsense.
---
I heard it from a friend a while ago so i could be wrong
---
The proof is they got caught with Stranger Things by using Twitter. Obviously they are gonna follow a bunch of random things to throw us off course of the next chapter. TWD, Tony Hawk and Stephen King are all bread crumbs to lead us down the wrong path. They already know of Paulie Ester and his predictions and research so why not throw fake signs out way?
---
Damn you are one triggered and toxic motherfucker lol. Not dealing with you shit
---
You said if ‚Äúyou down or hook the survivor you won‚Äôt get a token so you have to let them get away‚Äù and you have to do this 3 times just to get 6% AND you can‚Äôt get bloodlust, that is literally just worse then what it is now, if you let them go once right now you will gain a token which is 5% just for ending a chase with them once. Sure you lose it on hit, but it‚Äôs not bad at all. If you made it so you keep the movement speed even when the obsession is dead, then I think it will be good. 
---
Then again I‚Äôm no expert, so what I‚Äôm saying could sound so stupid.
---
Well to be frank I don't care left or right, children should not be used in politics. Politics are very convoluted and some adults don't even understand politics. Children can and should have opinions of their own, but to use them in politics is equivalent to child abuse in my eyes.
---
That's fucking terrifying
---
But you can also exhaust yourself by breaking your knees.
---
You‚Äôd keep all of your progress I believe
---
You do, devotion sets you to level one and thus the level one experience, which nets you iridescent shards faster
---
i agree. i feel like they always die though. it could just be my experiences :p
---
The reward is iridescent shards isn't it? Every level you get some for the shrine of secrets or to buy a skin instead of auric cells
---
just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks. i'm rank 17 (maybe 15 at most) and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ them, i just hunt and hit them ONLY if they're not injured. don't down them after u already hooked them. that just slows down the match. for perks use BBQ, Distressing, Nurse vision, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i'd never play any other way.
---
The actual community ended up getting banned anyway
---
Ghostface feels too accurate
---
*butt dance* *butt dance* *butt dance*
---
Is it just me or does anyone else never see the Spirit on PS4? I get her probably 1/20 matches.
---
If you get yourself off the hook and get hooked again youre supposed to go straight to the struggle phase, it might be glitchy right now but if you got killed instead of struggling then deliverance would be a horrible perk
---
You will now main pig for the rest of your life good luck
---
I'm not a fan of the changes, but I can understand why they did it. Having red ranked survivors with a baby killer is not cool. It also sucks for yolo red ranked survivors who get matched with baby survivors in a SWF. Most of those games end up in a loss. They should honestly just add a quick play feature like most other games have. That way people can just play and do whatever without your rank being put on the line.
---
edit spelling. NICE!
---
k
---
I saw her 4 times today, no lie.
---
Ok, I get your opinion. I just don't agree with it. Also, I play on PS4, and I can get solid games with Pig more than with Clown. Maybe the player base on PS is different from PC. Pig just can give so many more resources than the useless clown bottles. No TR, the game slow down, the ambush (kinda useless too tbf). 
---
Tru3 has the same opinion. He says clown is low tier and is highly loopable. And he is. Which is strange because he is like every other m1 killer so apparently there's no reason for him to be more loopable than the others. According to one of his fans, which is kinda interesting, the fact that he is so big, the turning around the tiles takes more time than a smaller killer.
---
Again you're not explaining why the survivor should have to depip and lose bp. Why is the killer's rank and bp more important?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen it yet, except for this mask. Pm me it pls *sob*
---
Then killers will be able to grab survivors mid jump, and hatch standoffs.
---
Nea and Nancy: annoying
---
Claudettes: some are good, most aren‚Äôt
---
We‚Äôre not just bad bitches we‚Äôre dumb bitches too on periodT
---
Sorry about your small peen and lack of ability to play a simple game.
---
Ruin, Nurses, Thana, Sloppy. Use your stealth to injure people and catch them out when healing.
---
What's this vid even called? It's so good
---
speak for yourself, i never run into those kind of spirits which might seem like a good thing but i don't know how it is like from the survivor's point of view to go up against this kind of spirit and i am CURIOUS
---
There is little real chance of this actually happening.
---
She actually wasn‚Äôt that far off on the clowns back story
---
As a rank 1 killer I use, bbq and chili for bloodpoints, ruin to stall the game a lil bit, nurse calling to see them healing, and sloppy butcher that forces them to heal. 
---
Unfortunately, the best way to use ghost face at rank 1 is to not stalk and use ur stealth as a way to attack survivors. That‚Äôs why nurse calling is op cuz they won‚Äôt see u coming as long as u behind a wall,  you have no terror radius and no red stain so you can sneak up, and sloppy butcher makes them heal so you will always know where they are.
---
Yeah I wasn't suggesting you did I was just making fun of the logic behind abandoning an entire character because some jackasses bm'd you one game.  You should get back on the horse.  He's a pretty solid killer.
---
The only addon I can see her being semi dependant on is the ones that reduce recharge time
---
You need to remove his GT from the pic.
---
I'd love to but I'm on xbox
---
Sounds good, but if this gets a ton of traction it will turn happy hour into waiting hour.
---
So hag but bad?
---
No, hatch closing is for the best.
---
It's also been said multiple times today on this sub that you can just grind out the free battlepass and then if you decide when/if you hit the 70 mark that you want the premium, it'll give you all of it then which immediately gives you the cells you paid on it back

I like to run Sloppy, Thana, Pop, and Ruin/Corrupt Intervention. I just run around stabbing people and making sure everyone is injured. I see a lot of success with those perks at purple/red ranks.
---
Submitted For Maximum Toxicity: Plague and Spirit. 
---
Plague runs Thana/Dying Light/Monitor and Abuse/Bitter Murmur with Iridicent Seal and Ashen Apple. 
---
Spirit runs Surveillance, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors and Huntress‚Äôs Lullaby with Mother Daughter Ring and Prayer Beads. 
---
Gen grabber Spirit runs around and does her Yoink thing. But she doesn‚Äôt hook them. She slugs them for Plague to hook and get Dying Light Tokens. With 7 non obsessions, you could have up to 21-24 tokens for a disgusting 63-72% gen speed reduction. Plague in the meantime will run around and puke on everyone as she does, but doesn‚Äôt specifically stop gens from being done because when they do, she gets Corrupt Purge from Iri Seal and Bitter Murmur shows their aura after finishing the gen. 
---
Do the gen, I dare you. These ladies will punish you for doing it and punish you for finishing it.
---
Ghostface is better fuck your 4k show me tits
---
Ok, well you can still ask me whatever and ill be able to answer it. I doubt there's one question about this game that you could ask me that I wouldn't know.
---
Again, the killer had no way of stopping it, the survivor would be forcing the killer to DC just to escape the match, thus holding the game hostage.
---
Plss next time post your cosplay not a actual ingame photo /s
---
Yeah, unfortunately someone is going to get the short end of the stick when you have a SWF group with varying ranks. We had it the old way, now we have it this way, I wonder if/how we can achieve a happy medium.
---
Ok, I just played my first match with legion and I frenzied 2 guys and stabbed on after but once I hooked him he got all pissy with me. Did I do anything wrong?
---
The survivor has no way of stopping it either. The killer would be forcing the survivor to DC just to get the 4k, thus holding the game hostage.
---
My friend Henry made this!

I have, and will continue to use teabagging as a diversion tactic.
---
Your killer main friend is right, the social stigma and alleged "infuriating toxicity" of a survivor pressing ctrl a bunch of times is excellent killer bait. The more this community circlejerks how toxic and rude crouching is, the more effective it'll be at getting the Killer to chase me on full hp over my team mate whos proven themselves less effective at looping who is also injured.
---
Or Xbox. It's the console that has to ban I believe and most of the time, 'unsportsmanlike behavior' will put you in a 'bad sport' lobby, if the game has one, yet to someone actually get banned from this. I have gotten people coms banned for cussing on Xbox live
---
This got me thinking of an achievement suggestion
---
Behaviour should let out a public event on all platforms to test how people would like a 2v8. 
---
(Obvisouly with some added tweaks to the game.)
---
What kind?
---
Aces always think they‚Äôre slick.  They might make a nice play but inevitably make a bonehead mistake in their escape.
---
I wish her perks were just as thicc
---
Absolutely, but give killers a hex that grants 1 minute of noclip when cleansed
---
I did the survey and got to the second question asking which platform I play on? I clicked PS4, it then says thank you for completing the survey! 
---
Did I do something wrong? That was a quick survey on the new dedicated servers! I hope BhVR gets that info I sent them and it helps!!
---
Can‚Äôt wait till Next year for dedicated Servers!!
---
It‚Äôs likely something with bubba or hillbilly riding up on your ass then fully revving chainsaw to down.
---
They could have a really high dpi and low in game sens or low dpi with high in game sens
---
Make every killer have a blink on secondary action button.
---
Off topic but I've started playing Piggy again so can we please buff her too? She's been butchered too many times :(
---
thats awesome
---
no please no im so sorry please don't
---
I think in Titanfall 2 there was something like that
---
I remember I finished a gen when bubba was bodyblocking me
---
People like this deserve no protection
---
That‚Äôs not proof, that‚Äôs just a theory.
---
I was gonna respond, but I gave it another once over, and decided not to. 
---
Wait a min...
---
SPIRIT! I‚Äôm a huge spirit main and she‚Äôs the most fun killer you‚Äôll ever play. Her and nurse are the two best killers if played right. You‚Äôll have a lot more fun with spirit, plus she has better perks and I think cooler cosmetics. But honestly it‚Äôs up to you. Spirit is a great chaser and gen protector, while legion is good at slowing the game down and injuring survivors. Spirit is super good dude. You should get her
---
Why wouldn't you be toxic as a survivor. Technically speaking your only option is to die eventually from the perspective of the player. It's not like the Jason game where counselors can fight back. 
---
The design of DBD encourages toxic behavior by essentially saying survivors have no tools and will always lose eventually, and most likely, often. Killers may not get many blood points for poor performance but they aren't even physically removed from any game. They get to enjoy the whole match. It's a very toxic feeling. 
---
Granted, I think it's all stupid. One idea I had is game should probably be balanced so that 4Ks are very difficult and lots of blood points are awarded for 1-2 kills because it's more likely any given survivor will make it without feeling oppressed. There would be very little toxicity if the killer was CPU controlled for example.
---
it‚Äôs more like hah i got you loser i‚Äôm so good ur bad haha xDD it‚Äôs sad
---
Trust me bud legion is useless, get spirit
---
honestly if you let someone ds you as the last guy alive you are a trash killer lmao just wait
---
What about people that stop struggling on 1% of the meter?
---
someone call a ghostbuster
---
Im sorry but susie will ALWAYS be Best Girl
---
Legion is lots of fun, but Spirit is largely the better killer on paper. Not that Legion can‚Äôt be competitive or Spirit isn‚Äôt fun, but that‚Äôs probably the consensus between the two. If you want to terrorize people I‚Äôd say go Spirit, but Legion can be pretty entertaining to use. No wrong choice, good luck!
---
Ok so legion is good for catching up to people (I hit them and then catch up with their speed boost, disable then hit them). Spirit is good with mind games, but gets hated on a lot
---
legion is a pile of garbage compared to every other killer in the game
---
Nice, may you slaughter your foes with your blade well
---
Dude, I was joking.
---
Actually I saw an earlier post here on Reddit that showed a Ghostface player with the Splint to play The Pig. When he went into the match he was still ghostface, but when he went back to the main menu, The Pig was selected as if he owned the pig. So I assume that it has it mixed up and you just have to play another match and you will be given the right to play that certain killer.
---
The survivor let the game drag on until AFTER the E.G.C. and made the game extend far longer than it would've if they had just left right away.
---
That's the point people get banned on PC.
---
And by simply uploading a administrator software for game files you can find one easily, to a USB and then plugging it into your console it will find the game and give you control over certain coding that restrain speeds, positioning and the likes.
---
Ik, I clarified at the end, I just really like the Legion lore :D
---
Use I‚Äôm all ears and then the one that isn‚Äôt furtive chase, and then ruin and nurses
---
It gives some sort of bonus if I remember right, extra level progression?
---
Pinhead?
---
Legion:  Yeah, laugh it up!  (Backs up his wheelchair and rolls away, bumps into a dropped pallet and gets stuck) Uh, a little help?  (David approaches and shoves him over, laughing.  Legion makes no attempt to get up, and spends the next hour crying inconsolably as his catheter bag leaks all over him)
---
Yep, definitely wanted to do something more minimalistic / **not** neon haha
---
You have a good point. As a live service game I understand that they need to make some sort of way to get more money as they're continually supporting the game. But I still think that if you're implementing a battle pass shouldn't the game just be free to play now? The battle pass concept was designed for free to play games and now it's being put into every game free or not and I just have an issue with  a premium track being in games that you pay for up front. If I say it's fine if this game does it because I like it and I know it's going it's towards more content and I want to support the game then I really can't have a problem when other games with a $70 entry point that are made just to get microtransaction money and not with the intent to just make a fun game do it, that's just how I'm seeing it. Honestly at the end of the day I think the battle pass in general is a good addition to the game in order to keep people engaged for longer I just can't really agree with the game still having to be paid for upfront if they are putting premium tracks which is essentially a free to play game mechanic. You were saying it didn't come with the game before but it is now and you still have to pay around $40 to get the game still. I also apologize I don't really follow your restaurant example either because going to a resturaunt isn't the same type of purchase as a game, you don't have to keep paying the retail price whenever you boot up the game you already bought again.
---
Death is not an escape, Jon.
---
I‚Äôm wondering what happens to frank after he goes to the basement
---
Yep, camping/tunneling at the sacrifice of generators is dumb. Real spite stuff.
---
Yea, 300 bonus exp for each one
---
Sounds like your forming a coherent argument, and we all know toxic people can't understand that shit.
---
Fair enough man.
---
Poor Frank will get camped
---
How can I treat a killer player like a human when their own objective is to remove me from the game ending my fun. No matter what they get to continue playing. I don't play in a toxic way but I empathize. The game is designed to be toxic. First, I have to rely on 3 other people of unknown skill and cooperation + toxic killer perks + no matter what I'm going to die eventually and that feels personal. 
---
If you're a bad killer you still get to play the whole match. You don't die, violently, in the end.
---
Yeah also, everyone calling them goggles when they look like glasses with a reflection on the lenses. 
---
Goggles tend to cover your eyes from all angles and leave little peep holes at the front to look through, but even the illustration doesn‚Äôt have eyewear like that.
---
ü§£
---
I try to be as positive as possible in chat. It's really sad when I play killer and complicate a nice flashlight save or basement save, people are always surprised. I've been thanked for being a good sport before. 
---
I also try to delicately confront people when they're putting down things that don't matter. Like those people who feel the need to insult or make rude comments on my ability as a killer. Like yeah, obviously I did bad? I got no kills. That's what happens. I play bad, I do bad. I play to play, everybody survived, so why are you being mean. I'm not mad you all played better than I did.
---
It's just... What's the point of even playing if you can't be happy losing OR winning? What fun is really being had when you win and you're still upset?
---
The 2017 Halloween menu theme says hi
---
Thank you, I appreciate the good response, with these examples I very much agree, it was just a fun in the moment idea I had
---
After reading some comment I wanna say games should be fun. First and foremost! Sure a challenge is another big part of it. But what keeps people playing a game even if it's not challenging is a really good fun factor. Look at Skyrim, not the most challenging game in the world, but you could have so much damn fun with that fucking game. Now look at ForHonor it's a very challenging game, but their are a lot of aspects of the game that aren't fun, especially with the current meta Wich I don't think your interested in considering that this is a different sub reddit. Basically bullying isn't fun, i know Earth shattering statement, so who the fuck wants to play a game that isn't fun.
---
I know this is a long post, but if y'all have never worked on a video game team or a engineering team I think it's worth your time to read it.
---
/u/SpaceC0c0nut I love your content and I agree with nearly every point you've made in your other videos. I love how you covered the End Game Mechanic in this video.
---
But as someone that works in engineering and closely with development/product (And spent 5 years at a big game company) this video is about 5 minutes of random dates, events and player counts without any kind of chart I could take into a meeting and say "This is why we need to adjust core mechanics" and "Here's evidence that our fanbase wants this" (such as searching how many times a topic a certain frustration has been put on the forums)
---
A business wants money, so they want new things that will bring them new money (Battlepass/Cosmetics/Big name DLC) what doesn't tend to make money are tweaks and balances (What was the player count between Legion being OP or nerfed? How many players came back for the Freddy rework and stayed?) This is also hard to handle because the designers making a DLC cosmetic are not the ones that would work on balance, those are definitely different teams.
---
I know those are hard things to answer, but if the developers and engineers are anything like the engineering teams I've worked with,  they hear us loud and clear. We need to help them convince their bosses which is extra difficult to do when our forums/subreddit is full of such toxic behavior and vastly contradictory request from people that only play Survivor or only play Killer.
---
The business has their goals, it is product's job to guide a team to meet those goals. The devs build what product needs. We need to convince 'the business' that it should prioritize balance/quality of life changes when they choose what their devs work on. This game has a LOT of bad coding. The about of tech debt they have has got to be insane, that's why every patch the sound goes upside down. We gotta convince the business that it's worth investing their engineering resources into the things we are requesting.
---
EVERYONE was united on needing the end game collapse. Highlighting that was so well done here. We need more of it and to scream about it as unified as we can be.
---
Get out of Spirit
---
Thanks Satan.
---
Both addons are useless on their own, together they're not any better.
---
No, there are alot of survivors who hate losing and will go off on you. They will claim that you can't do X, just play however you like.
---
 Legion is a weak killer btw.
---
The biggest thing that makes him suck is that his power doesn‚Äôt do anything in a chase. If the survivor is injured there‚Äôs no point to constantly stab unless you‚Äôre doing the 28 stab wounds build. It‚Äôs not great to catch up because of stun and there are about 10 billion counters to getting hit against him.
---
‚ÄúI killed a man with this thumb‚Äù
---
It's the killer's teabag
---
Yea ok. My biggest question was if the hex totems made an ambiance.
---
Ok, so why not have a debate, ask for evidence, and state your evidence, such as what we are doing right now
---
No problem. Maybe add something more and this could turn into a good killer idea :))
---
Man, you worry too much. I already survived several trials with that outfit. Even saved another survivor during endgame with it.
---
Mmmmm......Myers
---
His ability to eat is what is mainly affected, his only rival is considered our universes creator so taking that in mind they wouldn‚Äôt be rivals if he wasn‚Äôt also all powerful. It‚Äôs been a long time since I‚Äôve kept up with king‚Äôs universe in regards to it especially but from what I remember he‚Äôs a cosmic being created alongside the turtle by an even higher omnipotent being they reside in a space that surrounds our universe and he regards mortals as toys.
---
Tbh with how powerful killers can be together, I would say 2v10.
---
Bruh moment
---
Can they just fuck me up instead?
---
Reading the rules will answer that question.
---
Well there ya go I answered that
---
I'm sure they know about it, whether or not they're doing something about it is TBA, either way, the survivor should leave because the killer cannot do anything except give up their BP that they earned from playing well with the other un-glitched survivors, or wait for the survivor to leave since they're the one holding the game hostage and by proxy, keeping the killer from getting the BP they earned from actually playing.
---
I crouch to avoid Huntress' axes. I hope they know that.
---
‚ÄúNo matter what you think‚Äù Dude you serious?
---
Freddy and Michael. Freddy teleports around and disorients people while Michael exposes everyone.
---
When its the only reliable build to consistently beat good survivors, why would he?
---
I feel like this quite the exaggeration since a couple extra seconds can allow the survivor to get to/spend more time out of the nurses LoS which is quite significant and can potentially extend the chase for a much longer time than a few seconds.
---
You shut up.
---
It's really up to you, but dressing up helps get people in the spooky mood, I imagine some people see the word legion and just downvote, do what you want and have fun with it.
---
That was hilarious üòÇ
---
I mean like why do they punish you for something that is out of your control and being punished for being cooperative in a game about cooperative survival?
---
Imagine being against both of the Chainsaw killers in the same round
---
I would love some DbD books or comics. That would be awesome!
---
Yeah I noticed
---
Is...that..party city?
---
Wost
---
I don't know. It's almost as annoying as having the person you unhook run 5 feet away to a pallet and self care for .839012873409 seconds while you catch up so now you don't get second wind :)
---
They got caught and glitched, they should leave since the did lose, technically speaking.
---
.4 is 0.4 seconds/400miliseconds
---
No I know exactly what you said. Just find it kind of ignorant how you think getting DSed always means either we tunnel, or we're stupid. Set in stone ignorance can go both ways. If getting DSed means 100% it's poor playing on our part, then it's just as reasonable to assume everyone who plays the same character in a lobby is a swf who therefore deserve a Mori.
---
Yes I am aware of that... I don‚Äôt see what you are trying to say here.
---
I like the blight spirit but no, a spirit with horns minus the pus
---
head one and self care is not try Harding
---
It is a shitty week at work. Yall gonna get some hook. Maybe next week soft fluffy killer will be back.
---
Ooo who‚Äôs next
---
I understood your comment, have an updoot. Sorry the tards got here first lol.
---
Yeah, the other new Jake outfit is unlockable in the paid stream of the rift along with Blight Nurse so I guess I have to get the rift pass to get them.
---
R.i.p Garfield
---
Hag and pig. Hag puts down traps next to all jigsaw boxes. Survivors wont ever be able to get the reverse bear traps off.
---
 x2 Myers to use EW III in turns. No strategy involved just OP
---
Spirit with devour hope. Wraith camps the totem. Spirit moris the 8 survivors one by one.
---
So it isnt a couple extra seconds, the changes tobbase power really didn't effect her at all
---
I‚Äôll go through the free pass and do the lore crap first then after I finish I‚Äôll buy it and reap the rewards immediately
---
Not a fan, im sorry but the other system was more fair. Yes, some party is gonna get the short end of the stick, but right now the drawbacks are too many. I've seen red rank survivors depip constantly so they can play with friends, so in the end its WORSE for new killers. New people coming to the game absolutely can't play with friends or they get stomped hard, and like you said, survivors dodge lobbies when they see low rank survivors in their games cuz of the new matchmaking system.
---
I get that it was completely unfair to have low rank killers against experienced survivors just because they had 1 or 2 newbie survivors in a party with a rank 1 one. But, controversial opinion here, wasn't that more fair than what we have now? Before, the matchmaker TRIED to even out the ranks, a green rank killer could ignore the good survivors and go after the weak links and have a decent game, might even win it. Now they just get free wins, they can deal with the good survivor in the party and smash the rest of the group easily.
---
My friends don't even wanna play with me anymore, as they are low ranks. I honestly would preffer the old system with some adjustments.
---
Surge

Yes I did, ghostface had the mask and a black robe in all 4 movies, which one did you watch?

Enemies? Wtf are you talking about? You haven't outsmarted anyone; you sound like a smug teenager trying to figure out how socialization works lol
---
Just use haunted ground
---
I got myself killed trying to take a hit with BT, it ran out right as I got hit
---
my favorite killer in dead before sunrise is the bad dream
---
Even before making this post I had to give up caring about a lot of things (especially rank itself), it feels good to hear other people have been going through a similar experience. It makes it less frustrating knowing I'm not alone.
---
No.
---
I agree with the first part and disagree with the second part, as I said in my original response.
---
Ehhh idk yet
---
Toxic=funny dont  @ me
---
Eyeless Jack?
---
Only works once and for 60 seconds and it only makes 2 so its possible to narrow down before anyone tries to clense
---
this makes sense if i see a green rank in my red rank lobby i just dip 
---
as it ends up they both end up quitting if they get downed early  with 5 fucking gens left
---
at least make it so you cant join a friends lobby if your rank 2-4 different from each other
---
i do get that ranks mean nothing skill based before this change i remember getting matched up with red ranks as a green rank killer and still getting the 4k
---
i would wish they implemented a system that pairs you with people who dont dc
---
If it's like other battlepasses in other games, it'll be like far more difficult to finish it without buying it early on.
---
Original - Trapper, Billy, Wraith, Nurse, Hag, Clown, Plague, Legion, Spirit, Huntress, Doctor
---
Total - 11
---
3rd Party - Myers, Leatherface, Freddy, Pig, Ghostface, Demogorgon

Total - 6

Original killers outnumber 3rd party killers.  Quit crying.

There's no dedicated servers on xbox, so of course you can't answer the survey.

can this be made into a show?
---
I‚Äôm a cosmetics slut so I‚Äôll be buying it
---
I will 100% be buying it.
---
Unless they reactived them and didn't announce it, im pretty sure we are not on dedicated servers right now, what we had last week was just a short test friend.
---
Oooh soo satisfying, great hit(:
---
Happy cake day!
---
Somewhere in the world it has to be 3 am lol
---
You show their perks, but you don't show your own, nor do you show what you actually did during the game. Killers can act like tryhards, it's not out of the realm of possibility.
---
In short, your post is a huge waste of time and carries the typical 'survivors are toxic' message that this sub loves, without showing us the whole story.
---
Facing Ruin and NoEd
---
I plan on buying it because the cosmetics in it look pretty damn cool plus the changes will match some of my survivors perfectly (also I play alot so it's worth it)
---
ohhh why does this exist
---
have they said how long till the next pass? 
---
seasonal or monthly
---
I don't know but I was waiting for him to nod.
---
Morimorimorimorimorimorimori
---
Believe it's 70 days long or just at the start of when the new chapter comes out.
---
It seems like you should blame your teammate who unhooked you right next to the killer and not the killer
---
The fact that the rift expires after you've paid for it is quite terrible.
---
Skin prices needs to come way down too.  It's all so easy to fix.
---
the videos I have watched about the PTB online all say about 2 months each tier, (like 56 days or so)
---
Face camping is the dumbest, by far. Unless you have super altruistic group and the gates are open, it makes no sense. At least there‚Äôs something to gain from a tunnel (as long as it doesn‚Äôt result in a long chase) - can‚Äôt really say the same with face camping...
---
What is more annoying than a killer using their power is an m1gion.
---
Yes, I‚Äôve stopped using ruin for a while now, also Stridor I‚Äôve found myself to reappear way too soon.
---
Happened 5 times to me so far, each time feeling worse than the last.
---
always use kindred
---
I mean, DBD can do whatever it wants. Liberties have already been taken with some of the killers we have, and this game actually happens to have a good excuse for any changes made. Theyve already stated that they would be interested in getting the rights sooner or later, so, it can and will happen if a deal is ever, or has already been struck.
---
Well he has to use m1 to down people he can‚Äôt only use his power, and if he knows no one is around, sometimes m1 is the better play
---
Not really related to the post, but saying you prefer the former, means you prefer the first of the options, which in this case are the potato survivors.
---
In this case, you want to say you prefer the latter
---
Only the really cash grabby ones do that. This one looks more like the mtga one, where paying does not even remotely influence the speed.
---
" The Entity would never be able to persuade Pennywise into joining, as Pennywise would have literally no reason to. " but like, eternal hunting grounds, sounds like something he'd like.
---
Just type gg and push continue.
---
It‚Äôs available in some countries
---
Oh my mistake, I thought former was the 2nd option.
---
I think this would be epically dumb. I do not like that they have 2 chainsaw wielding killers.... One with a clear advantage. 
---
Another clown, probably with an advantage over our current one, would just be insulting to the people who actually like playing Clown.
---
yes, he basically gets +1 perk slot since he doesn't need M&amp;M anymore and he never starts a chase even if he's running right behind you, only when he hits some1 it starts a chase
---
edit: also counters borrowed time because he never has a terror radius so hook dives don't work against him
---
Swap monitor for Whispers.
---
You act like survivors never post salty videos/screenshots
---
Shhhh... They might nerf it
---
Kono Dio da!
---
Translates  roughly to;
---
It was I, Dio!
---
He would like that yes... But he needs to feed off of the persons life force. And besides, he rests for 27 years each awakening because he does not need constant feeding. It would be ideal conditions for him if he was allowed to kill them without the whole sacrificial hook thing. Also again, he would have no real reason to agree as he pretty much already has this
---
I‚Äôve tried swapping discordance for whispers, it‚Äôs good, but the range feels so long, especially when I just hook someone it feels underwhelming.
---
No, a m1gion is a Legion who NEVER uses the power. The most boring Legion to ever play against in existence.
---
They've been active again on PC for a day &amp; a half

Edit: On both live &amp; PTB

There will always be a lot of people that miss out because of work or life, and that's not fair to them.

I don‚Äôt think BHVR really cares, lol. Also not hostile, but I think if they thought Pennywise would be a good character for them and they were able to attain his rights, they wouldn‚Äôt stop and be like ‚Äúwait guys we can‚Äôt, Pennywise wouldn‚Äôt do this‚Äù.

november 2nd
---
I love getting hate messages from the survivor that's running around with a flashlight teabagging me the entire game. Did you not think the camp was coming bro? Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
---
League of Legends, Smite, Paladins, Realm Royale, PUBG and Apex Legends are my experiences with the concept. 
---
I've never played Fortnite but I believe it also has a "quest" system for players who own the premium.
---
You tryna...
---
Bait me.
---
.
---
Fam?
---
And yes, my good sir, you have gotten hate.
---
Eh, I mean this is a fair complaint, but Pennywise could go either way. I personally think he's more likely to be the new Freddy tier meme, but you could be right.
---
r/rareinsults
---
Kinda contradicts what you said ü§£
---
as much as I love him this is true
---
Hmm?
---
 Ok
---
Again, Stephen King would not agree to it. It would interfere with Dark Tower lore, something he worked on for decades. Even if they took the liberty of Pennywise agreeing with the Entity using an avatar of himself just for fun, he needs the lifeforce. It could possibly be a big stretch and have just his avatar in literally just for fun because he is so above the Entity that he doesn't care and is capable of sustaining himself even with his avatar there so that's good point
---
pennywise is a cosmic entity like the entity itself and probably an inspiration for the one in dbd
---
Just faced both today can confirm they do exist
---
Michael please I just want to get a Big Gulp
---
Plague is very common
---
Yep. Idk about inspiration for DBD the Entity is pretty unique. Technically he is above cosmic, being at the same level or above the Turtle

I hadn‚Äôt seen anyone playing the Plague in over a month and then yesterday I got murdered by 2 in a row.
---
I mean killers run crutch perks too... it seems like every match I play against killers with bbq+chili, ruin, the perk where you can see people healing, and the perk where you see people on the ground. It's like a 50/50 chance that I'll end up with a killer who is slugging because they have all the perks for maximum visibility. I understand why they'd pick that, but it makes it pretty not fun sometimes.
---
Maybe PS4 is not popular in Russia but I have problems with French and Germans mostly

Headaches, fever and a chill

I came here to help restore your pluck

Because I‚Äôm the nurse who like to
---
And you have every right to. It‚Äôs a game, play how you want. Why the hell do I or anybody for that matter have to follow some bullshit rule book.
---
Well, we don't really know how powerful the entity is, and it's possible it's more powerful than the Headlights, and could force it to play it's game. Also, since the Headlights feed off fear, wouldn't it be possible for it to join the Entity, as the entity has created a purgatory of endless fear for it to snack on?
---
Final note, Stephen King probably doesn't hold the rights to the 2018/2019 versions of it, and would probably have no say in the sale of that particular version of the character, just like in the case of Freddy
---
Hag does, she‚Äôs my least favorite killer to survive against lol.

Haven't lost a game in a long time with Whispers, Ruin, PGTW, and BBQ. Sometimes Nurse's in place of whispers. And I typically only play Spirit when I know I'm going against a particularly strong team and don't want to deal with their nonsense. It's a really braindead build for her.
---
Once you get used to combing areas with Whispers, you start to regret not having it whenever you try a different build. It's very valuable for saving time and pressuring the areas you need to pressure.
---
Also I prefer activation speed add-ons over post-phase add-ons like Wakizashi.
---
Yeah I play plague :)
---
Well, i found some new survivor portraits :D
---
Yh plus you get 1000 auric cells through premium pass
---
Depends on your rank. I barely see both of them...
---
Red rank players just hide in corners or do gens, never get chased and can barely keep a chase for more than a few seconds except for the once in a blue moon 1000+ hour survivor, killers all rely on spirit/nurse except for the once in a blue moon you get an actually good killer and have fun. Greens survivors can hold chase and killers can also kill with things other than nurse/spirit and imo 90% of the time are better than killers I play at red ranks. The big problem with this game is the very dedicated players who have thousands of hours have been pushed away from annoying changes for both sides constantly and poor decision making on bhvr's side so all you have left are newer players who started playing 3-6 months ago and are ok enough to make it to red ranks
---
They'll likely add events and such that give double xp anyway.
---
Just have faith in the devs.
---
This can't be real. No way there can be 5 girls within a 10 mile radius that play DBD!
---
I‚Äôm sorry is trying your hardest to win not allowed now?
---
Mad Grit and Agitation is top banter
---
Yeah you get op meg
---
You had no business doing my man Jake like this
---
So basically, regression won't exist.
---
Somebody who has money give this guy some rewards seriously this is gold
---
Yeah, Freddy and Michael wouldn't be up for the whole 'must hook no kill' thing either and yet here they are.
---
I have a LOT of bloody hair combs, it‚Äôs good. The lunge range on wakasashi gives me so much more room if I make a mistake.
---
Yakuyoke buffs almost everything about her skill as well.
---
I‚Äôll try yakuyoke and hair comb, see how it goes.
---
As far as whispers go, how do you know where to go when it pops up?
---
"The headlights" I'm assuming you mean the Deadlights, are an ability of Pennywise. They are not him. Pennywise the being is a being that killed what is technically a sort of god in the Dark Tower universe indirectly because of shock. It's a good point that they could join up, but that would be ignoring the fact that Pennywise existed before time and before the Turtle in the Dark Tower universe.  Maybe he could be there as an avatar of himself yes just for fun because he is so powerful it wouldn't make a difference, but that's a big stretch. Pennywise is an instinctual and primordial creature. He only exists to survive, he would probably see it as a waste of time. This is based off the book btw, movie Pennywise is not the same
---
The problem is even if people get punished for DCing they can just kill themselves on the hook and not get banned or timed out. I wonder how they are going to work around that.
---
They literally flick their mouse like anyone does
---
As long as the Premium Tiers already ‚Äúcompleted‚Äù remain that way if I choose to purchase mid-Rift (insta-rewards style), I certainly will. PTB shows it appears to work that way. 
---
Sadly, I‚Äôm out of the country for 2.5 weeks when it rolls out so it doesn‚Äôt make much sense for me to buy it right away. Otherwise, I definitely would.
---
How so? I asked if you had a problem with people talking it out like adults. That didn‚Äôt contradict anything I said.
---
For some builds:
---
Nurses calling, stridor, thanataphobia, sloppy butcher. Easy to use and easy to get build, it's all 3 nurse teachables and a base game perk. Easy to get early on, and the only difference in playstyle from normal is try and keep everyone injured. 
---
BBQ &amp; Chili, dying light, pop goes the weasel, perk of your choice. I like my fourth to be surveillance so I can find gens to pgtw easier, but Save the best for last, ruin, corrupt intervention, and nurses calling could all work. This is my general I want to just play and get some blood points build. Simple to use, just remember to not kill your obsession too early and dont forget about pgtw. 
---
For addons, spirit doesnt have many bad ones, but the dried cherry blossom and juniper bonsai both are pretty bad. Activation time addons arent that great either imo. Father's glasses are really only good if you cant track really well, but can be helpful if you have problems with that. 
---
THE FINAL BUILD: Thrill of the hunt, third seal, ruin, and devour hope. Use prayer beads and mother daughter ring. Ruin slows the game, devour gives a great snowball effect, third seal destroys any non swf and even wastes the time of a swf, and thrill keeps it all safe. Unless they all get on totems at the same time, they will have a bloody hard time winning. This build is pretty easily countered, but without good communication it will destroy most teams. Also easy to get the perks as it's all 3 hag perks and a base game perk.
---
This is so cute and i love it
---
Yeah dont know why we get level exp instead of BP
---
Was playing plague earlier to do some dailies so she does exist however I haven‚Äôt seen hag in a while apart from like 2 days ago when I did a daily for her aswell
---
I only play with my homies cause idk what randoms be smoking but I‚Äôve actually never met anyone be more random or trolly than in a lobby full of randoms.... usually one guy/girl actually trying to win like you, and than you have the troll getting hung or leading the killer to you, while the fourth is just running around farming bloodpoints.... so when I‚Äôm with my homies and the killer is being a dick for no reason, you bet your ass I‚Äôm teabagging the fuck out of that killer!!! Sometimes I even get a message at the end with the killer just being straight toxic! It brings me great joy to make a incompetent idiot feel even more insecure about themselves hahahaha
---
You mean the one on the ptb right now?
---
At the very least, in Bubba‚Äôs case, its usually the survivors fault to some degree that they got chainsawed.
---
Or like have a day where the bloodweb is half priced. Would be the same effect kinda?
---
That is very wrong. I max boldness in all my games, and dead hard and decisive being the most used perks at rank 1 is enough to prove that red ranks arent immersed right?
---
You have to earn them gradually by unlocking the levels, but yes, you can earn the cost of the pass back in auric cells.
---
It's not that he wouldn't like it, it's that he specifically needs to be the one to absorb the life force/fear in order to survive. It is true that Pennywise could possibly agree to just have an avatar of himself there just for fun but that's a big stretch as he is a primordial creature that really only cares about sustaining himself as demonstrated by going dormant every 27 years. I mean yeah of course they could always just add him but it would be bending/breaking both universes lore
---
Bloody Hour?
---
Doesn't he like to make people afraid before he kills them? Fear is like seasoning on chicken to him.
---
Don't worry about the lore that much. If Pennywise gets added or not, it won't be because "Well, the barfing turtle in comparison..." blah blah blah. Nobody will care. They'll just be happy Pennywise was added. Don't worry about the "lore" that much, let Stephen King worry about it.
---
Copy and pasting my other comment cause it answers the same thing: It's not that he wouldn't like it, it's that he specifically needs to be the one to absorb the life force/fear in order to survive. It is true that Pennywise could possibly agree to just have an avatar of himself there just for fun but that's a big stretch as he is a primordial creature that really only cares about sustaining himself as demonstrated by going dormant every 27 years. I mean yeah of course they could always just add him but it would be bending/breaking both universes lore
---
How do you feel about dying light now? It seems like a worse thanatophobia considering you can‚Äôt touch your obsession.
---
action by hate ( they will call it strategy , well its not wrong )  vs item, perks, strategy team without tea bagging ( useless action )
---
Duhhhh state the obvious
---
what does the lil thing underneath survivors names around the campfire mean?
---
It's better than thana imo as you dont lose stacks unless you kill obsession. It is amazing late game slowdown if you can get 6+ stacks.
---
I think people should start doing the 'pullups' on hook to let the others know they're being camped. Then just hangout and let the others do gens.
---
Sorry, my mistake.  
---
Me over here arguing a side to a debate that doesn't exist üòÖ
---
im in the same trouble! i'll wait to see if something like bbq appears bc i don't really get gen rushed all that often
---
Thank you. Yes surge
---
He does need the fear that's true, but he does need to kill. Otherwise he wouldn't go through the effort. I care a good deal about lore because DBD has really cool lore as does the Dark Tower verse. Again it could work out if it were explained as Pennywise let's an avatar of himself just chill there for fun, but that's something I just considered because of the first reply on this comment thread so I gotta think a bit more about it
---
I main Plague lmao
---
A man of culture
---
SB and UE are some of the most used perks at red ranks it's just not nearly as noticable as someone stabbing the killer in the shoulder. Also you don't need to run the killer for that long anymore to get max boldness anymore with the points being added for it the last few updates. Also trust me run bond sometime players are VERY immersed
---
I‚Äôm also in progress of the ghostface outfit right now. Your cosplay looks great!
---
I teabag at other survivors to say multiple things, like hello, or thanks for the heal, I also do it to killers who let me live, it‚Äôs only a toxic teabag if you make it one. 
---
And honestly, although it may be ‚Äútoxic‚Äù on this sub teabagging to make a killer chase you to save another survivor is sometimes a good play. Some survivors are not strong runners where as others are, the others should take the heat to help the ones who can‚Äôt.
---
I haven't beat a Wraith in ages. I just do not know how to eat them
---
Finding people with Whispers is just about mentally picturing where the survivors could be. Once you get a feel for how far 32 meters is, it'll come naturally.
---
The information that someone's in the area or not is still immensely valuable if capitalized on. No need to walk right up to gens to see if they're actively being worked on, no need to search around areas that it's not proccing around. Pretty good stuff. Just gotta make sure you don't waste too much time searching for someone who's committed to stealth if you can't afford it. Sometimes it's better to just leave the area and come back later (or even immediately after, survivors love working on gens as soon as you leave in my experience).
---
Can‚Äôt wait for the sequel where the survivors go trick-or-treating and this is the first house they approach.
---
See you‚Äôre using a good counter argument saying that they followed other people. But then you‚Äôre flat out denying the possibility of penny wise being in the game so it really makes people ignore your argument cause you act like you‚Äôre 100% right
---
That's a really good point. Freddy was just dropped in and was kind of pissed about it if I remember correctly. Michael can be explained by just liking to kill things, and I don't know enough about Legion to defend that so that's true. It could make sense if Pennywise just sent an avatar of himself literally just for fun though
---
Drop the sauce.

The battle pass concept was designed to generate revenue, and it looks like it's going to replace lootboxes since it does the same thing but in a "more acceptable" way. Both F2P and non-F2P titles use lootboxes, because revenue generation isn't exclusive to either.
---
I'll not confuse you with further analogies, especially since we seem to have moved to a different point of contention.
---
Definitely planning on it, maybe after rank reset just to be safe lol
---
Blasphemy, how is ash not on top in a tier of his own

Oh right. I didn't realize that Stephen King didn't really care all that much about his works, and if you're more informed about it then I guess that's what would happen if you say so

Looks w e I r d
---
It's borderline betrayal.
---
Yeah, you teabagged me twelve times after wasting your teammates pallets.
---
I still dropped you on hatch, cause I felt sympathetic. Then you said GG EZ.
---
There's days like this were time travel really needs to exist.
---
I‚Äôve noticed it‚Äôs started to get better, less killers that view survs as bullies and less survs that treat killers like babies. There‚Äôs always gonna be camping killers and toxic survs though
---
You can't do it fron your profile as far as I'm aware, when you enter the notification for this comment, scroll up and on the top right there should be a symbol you can tap which shows the delete option

Maybe mention that in the post instead of his perks haha, the fact that he was upset that you didn‚Äôt hand him a free escape says more than his perks

Well at least I know what you play.

no, when our toys 'r us closed some weird cursed halloween store opened in its place within a week last year. then ofc it closed within 2 weeks lmao.
---
A friend told me that the whole October should have been double bloodpoints as a treat for us. Some people would probably think it‚Äôs stupid, but it‚Äôs honestly a lot better than having Bloodhunt last only 3 days. 
---
And considering the last one was like unplayable half the time, and wasn‚Äôt even extending too..  Idk but I think that would‚Äôve been awesome, it gives everybody a chance and more time to play as well.
---
Been running into some poo head killers recently.
---
Would help swf find it faster tbh
---
Yeah most of the time that's true but if you're having a lot of trouble at things like shack it completely shuts it down, (although there's easy ways to shut down shack without it), so it isn't completely useless just very redundant.

It's DBD. They'd find a way. Besides, in Pennywise's world, he only awakes every 27 years. And even then he's not guaranteed to have all the fear he needs to sustain himself. In the realm of the entity, he could constantly be on the hunt, and be guaranteed a literally endless stream of fear to keep him fed.
---
I don't mind considering shards are the more valuable currency to me, but I see why BP would make more sense from a gameplay accessibility perspective.
---
I just wish the bonus was better, perhaps shards on their own rather than level progress

I was a little worried for a second there when I saw chucky in freddy's house given his history with little kids

Shrug, I‚Äôd rather just have better spawn points for whatever hex you‚Äôre running. They‚Äôre left right in the open sometimes, ffs.
---
Much better
---
Please bear in mind I wrote my comment *before* the news post was edited to specify that the serum would be available in the Rift for the entirety of the Rift's duration, and wouldn't just vanish with the Blight event.
---
Damn that‚Äôs a good one, saving that for later
---
Could not agree with this system more.
---
why do people call leatherface bubba?
---
Or you can either learn to play without the totem instead of trying to handicap survivors. Its a gambleto take totems. There are plenty other perks you can pick instead of Hex. This is just pointless.
---
still  way waiting for buying aurelic cell in playstore and how to instal heal
---
How is Quentin not lower than that?
---
I doubt they'd release 4 original killers in a row
---
Oh, wait, never mind. 
---
Imo there is an even chance of it being an original killer VS a licensed killer.
---
Today, my friend's button was sticking so she was occasionally squatting while running away. She fixed it shortly after it started, but I think the killer thought she was being an ass intentionally and went after her.
---
Steve and Nancy?
---
Have you not played Clown or something?
---
I didnt say he doesnt care. I said he slaps them together with no real regard or planning, which is why his books are usually FULL of plot holes and abandoned ideas. He then sells the rights to people for movies, for excessive amounts of money, and then goes out of his way to condemn them for really random reasons, usually related to the directors stripping out reaaaaaaaally controversial shit, such as child orgies.
---
I play against whoever fills the lobby, but I get the complaints.  Some people don‚Äôt want to or don‚Äôt have the meta perks,  or maybe they don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs good.  SWF communication literally counters perks and strategies.  That‚Äôs not fair.  It‚Äôs not going anywhere though so instead I would als the devs balance and add features and mechanics with that in mind rather than making stuff for solo play.  
---
Example is like knock out.  Can be a huge time waster if your up against solo players but against SWF your lucky if it buys you time to get into another chase or kick a gen.
---
Oh was it edited? Nice! :) Glad to hear they wont vanish then.
---
Nah don't own him
---
Jeffü•¥
---
ahhh...sheiza
---
I wish the devs did more to make an in game community. They‚Äôre getting started, but it feels late to the party. Can‚Äôt wait for it to feel like the game wants me to keep playing. It‚Äôs been the opposite for years.
---
Survivors will just rush a gen before looking for the totem. Early game will pretty much be ‚Äútry and find the 2-3 survivors stacking on a gen so you can get use out of your totem before they accomplish 20% of their objective.‚Äù If it appears broken they can just wait to break totems until a gen pops; the broken totem is then just an incognito lit totem that can be called out and returned to later.
---
Not a bad idea by any means, will probably hinder the killer more than it helps though.
---
I know right. Frankie looking better than ever
---
Ah I see. Thank you!
---
Hey Kevin Green, you didn't cover up your name in the bottom right corner.
---
Good guy Ghostface bringing the gauc instead of being a party pooper
---
I‚Äôll finish a gen if there‚Äôs time but if I see someone else get injured I‚Äôll go ahead and go for the save. But to just stand there...that‚Äôs the worst.
---
I will upvote any fallout (or elder scrolls) post tbh
---
Im using a 4k monitor and am having this problem. When you say "changing resolution to 100% from desktop settings' are you referring to the in-game or the system display
---
Not a bad strat.  I have often dipped my toes into the water on a new killer toon rank reset myself.  I think you'll like him though.  He's a pretty well designed character with nice map pressure and an ability that turns the safest pallets in the game into some of the most dangerous with his Shred.  Long loops become death traps you have to rely on juking his shred.
---
I hate that this is true, and I‚Äôd be the one to suffer for the toxic survivors from the killer‚Äôs previous games when I just want to plunder and try moonwalking :(
---
Itd probably tank their servers lmao.  Youd get 1 game at best
---
Bloodpoints don‚Äôt affect pips buddy.
---
I do pullups when it's clear to signal im ready to get off this bitch.
---
some other guy was spamming it with the huntress next to them and I got downed cus I thot it was clear lol
---
When was I bitching about DS? You‚Äôve got a terrible attitude. So eager to tell people what‚Äôs up you‚Äôre not even following the conversation properly.
---
wow thats really funny Kevin Green
---
Nah, I honestly think it should be a bit harder for both sides. It should be a challenge to get to rank 1, not something that passively happens while just messing around.
---
finding it isn't the point the point is that survivors spawn on them and they go down too fast
---
weird ass fan art
---
Oopsie
---
Make it your first three games
---
Or remove the notification. Like for Huntress Lullaby
---
oh god the meme has escaped r/shitpostcrusaders
---
I agree that it is easier to pip as killer, since you have game changing addons, overpowered characters, and pretty decent perks to carry you to pips. Survivors only have decent perks, but no game changing items/addons besides flashlights, which honestly are pretty easy to counter as a mindful killer. I still believe that pipping should be harder on both ends.
---
I just want to know why and how he got Cheeto dust on his dick
---
My favourite one I‚Äôve had is ‚Äúu r $hithouse‚Äù
---
Okay but seriously these meme combination formats are becoming out of control
---
thats the point
---
it slows the game by at least 15 seconds
---
Not sure how that‚Äôs possible then lol
---
&gt;deviousness, not your Brutal, and at his rank that‚Äôs an ez pip even with hardly any sacrifice points. Learn the system nub
---
Your only proving my point, each emblem caps at 8000 BP, therefore the max BP you cab get is 32K per game. 21, thousand now that I did calculations it's a pip. This is due to Gatekeeper being lost or lack of generator pressure therefore that's why he got a low BP of 21, if he did any worse in any emblem he would have depiped.
---
 Various things make these emblems go down, considering he's a trapper with low BP it's clear he performed well enough to pip but may of had trouble.

As someone who used to play alot of fighting games, I know what you mean. I'm not toxic in dbd, but I understand the feeling from playing so much mk11 üòÇ

You are not Ghost Face, you cant stalk that well

I love how the plauge just runs a laundry shop for no reason.

This one has been used so many times in this subreddit and it‚Äôs still so goddamn funny

DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?

I mean, Myers tho too haha

How long did you loop him? Lol.

Awful idea. Just fix totem spots
---
But just as items create strategy, slugging is a strategy 
---
Can be an effective one at that if done right
---
Huntress has iridescent head.
---
Cant think of any other addons quite as good.
---
I mean i do it, i just dont complain about the gens getting done. 80% of the time they all come for saves regardless
---
Honestly I‚Äôm not gonna argue with someone who doesn‚Äôt even play the game, the BP cap is 32k per game. I honestly cba with these braindeads
---
Time to slug
---
If that‚Äôs so true, why are you tied in intellectual knots right now?
---
Ash is S Tier sir. Fight me.
---
not a good perk as in it is poorly designed, it is broken to all hell and very OP
---
That‚Äôs not the most reliable build to consistently beat the best and good survivors. To me, no perk build allows for this. In order to beat good survivors, you need to be good at the game (unless you play spirit) Try running that build on ghost face, Michael, or Bubba at rank 12+. It doesn‚Äôt work. Not for me anyways. I play on pc and it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to play killer for me. If I tunnel and play super toxic with OP add ons or something I might do well, but perks rarely help me to the point of winning the game against truly good survivors.
---
My opinion is that perks never make a player good. Add ons may. NOED is the only exception in that it rewards a killer for doing nothing and essentially playing poorly. I hope I don‚Äôt come across as abrasive, and I‚Äôm open to opposing viewpoints. I play both survivor and killer an equal amount btw. Feel free to debate/change my mind.
---
Edit: I failed to notice the ebony Mori part of the meme. I think ebony moris are a stupid part of the game. In the same way that I think insta heals are stupid. This changes the meaning of my point a little I suppose
---
Well... yeah lol, those people are lost causes though XD
---
Spirit is Top tier and very good, except survivors will DC a lot and hate you, but as I said she‚Äôs good and her perks are super fun.  Legion is alright stabbing people but his power is pretty useless, but has decent perks.  Plague is really fun puking on survivors and has good perks, and if survivors cleanse against you you‚Äôre gonna have a blast destroying them.
---
They re-activated dedicated servers
---
He's not the worst killer in the game.
---
hatchet hurtbox*  
---
Also survivor hitboxes are generally bigger than the survivor.   
---
Also also its probably just ping
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre forgetting that mori‚Äôs are a thing.. not everyone dies on a hook.
---
the broken totem isnt the main idea because if they find the broken totem they would have found it if it was lit this just gives the killer more breathing room around the totem and say let trapper set up and such
---
Lol you wish Jeff is the gentle giant we needed
---
And you think serverside is bad *now*
---
Using insta kill sort of addons makes piping much harder.
---
To be honest, slow down legion builds are more fun to play against than spirits. It‚Äôs not really being an asshole, it‚Äôs just a build that makes the most of the killer‚Äôs power.
---
This is the best thing
---
Right... Shit lol my bad
---
They just didnt care anymore bc of the DC
---
I was gonna say that nea was the entity but now that i think about it recently ive been getting nea, laurie and janes getting flashlight saves, ive seen davids, and jakes looping the killer pretty often and claudette mains that still try to camouflage but are stupid and wear bright blue shirts or hollowed blight cosmetics that think, you know what i may stick out like a soar thumb, but he wont see me
---
For perk to work in the first place, the killer has to be good(cept noed), and this is one of the few meta builds in the game, so why would he use other perks if he‚Äôs good and is going against high ranks?(which i assume he would if he has that loadout)
---
I'm noticing that.
---
oh
---
NOED EYES!!!
---
What is this clip from?
---
It does feed off of hope. Your idea works. Dunno what everyone else is saying.
---
I wouldn't use monitor and abuse on spirit because they can't hear your haunting sound if they are in your terror radius.
---
this doesn't only go for ruin maby you get the chance to slap a survivor or three with third seal before the gen is done so now you dont get the totem killed at spawn and the survivors are blind so good killers can add more pressure
---
I got to rank 7 after like 1 week playing survivor. I was still a potato. The ranking system is so bad, everyone eventually gets to higher ranks even if they are potatoes.
---
Legion has been a pretty low tier killer for a while and it would be nice to play him other than ‚Äúyou get to hit people AND vault pallets and windows SLIGHTLY faster‚Äù most of his add ons are useless now cause if they give longer feral frenzy it will only be about 0.12 seconds longer it would be nice to play them without getting destroyed at high ranks
---
Otz had a video where he basically got bullied as Clown, and he said something about normal vault having been buffed and really weakening Clown. This was recent, too.
---
Well the idea is to ambush with it and save my power for the extra 8m terror radius while I‚Äôm chasing them.
---
Okay but Devour hope and shit like that, not seeing totems is dumb. Not a good rework
---
Probably because of her screen getting frozen every time she places a trap.
---
I feel ya. Especially with Nancy's inner strength, totems are just GONE.

Exactly! What better way to get hope then giving the survivors a way to defeat the killer l.

Extra auras too OP pls nerf dev's literally unplayable üôÑüôÑüôÑ

Myers never stuck someone on a hook, he always outright killed.
---
Amanda never put people in traps they had to ability to escape, it was her exact downfall that she deliberately put people in traps that would kill them.
---
The Demogorgon never stuck people on hooks either, pretty sure he was just a hungry boy.
---
Freddy targeted children and those related to those who wronged him. He certainly tortured creatively, but never stuck people on hooks.

Licensed killers don't have to live up to their lore, as the only one that does is Leatherface. Pennywise would be fine, because what exists in any person's lore isn't related to the game.

That's what happens when your default power is teleporting through shit

Doctor has some heavy Marilyn Manson vibes to me.

As a new player, what‚Äôs so good about No Mither?

But you can get the lootboxes for free with gameplay, and those are at least just cosmetics. If they said I had to pay $5 to play as Doomfist, I'd have uninstalled then and there.

try playing killer. it's fun too.

Nice job dude! That Rank 12 must‚Äôve been pissed. Pretty good on 3rd day too. It was way too long ago since I played my first killer game. I‚Äôm sure I failed miserably. But anyway congrats!
---
yes this would work and i know it would but since im pretty sure we asked a good 300+ times and totems are still in the open
---
this is just an alternative idea to a solution we should of had done since Freddy came out
---
Yup forgot that non hook deaths were a thing my bad

-_-

Bless you, pumpkin of wisdom.
