For the record, Ash started t-bagging a millisecond after I started. Bet you he would’ve t bagged me even if I didn’t, so he deserved it.

Oh god you know there's other things to read aside from Naruto right

I wouldn't be surprised if it was just a bug

Lol me neither

Oh cool you camped the basement cloaked... impressive

Nope XD

What the hell... Is that like a Killer perk or a game mechanic now?

Just played vs it again haha, its usually nbd: [https://i.imgur.com/tt1no0x.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/tt1no0x.jpg)

Thanks

I’d assume it would keep your progress, I don’t use playstation if that’s what your on so I can’t speak for that but if it didn’t there’s really no way to get back leveled characters aside from grinding
---
Unrelenting does not affect the Pig's ambush attack, since it is part of her ambush dash ability, rather than a regular M1 attack.
---

---
So this combo unfortunately doesn't work out. Unrelenting can be reasonably fun on Spirit however, spamming post-Phase lunges recklessly.
---
Cool. I have hope that the devs will see this as that one time in G4m3r104’s (Probably Dumb) Perk and Add-on Reworks Pt.4, my proposed Lithe change partially got accepted; which was about removing the chase condition. I now hope the devs will continue to see these, but also other people, to look at what I believe since I like to go over the details a lot and see what it lacks in order to make it better.
---
Also I forgot to mention to say change values TO, not BY as it makes it look like you’re adding that much to the current values. And Father’s Glasses, where it states that you can see Auras while phasing. This is not what I said. I said you can see Survivor’s Auras while phasing as in, if their Auras are being revealed by BBQ &amp; Chili, Father’s Glasses will still allow you to see them. This may be me and my way of saying things, but I’m asking you to change it please to not confuse anyone else.

I had brought a shroud of separation once when the SWF team brought 4 gâteaux ... They DCd so fast. 
---
Jokes on them, they would have schooled me with their instaheals and their purple flashlights.
---
ps4's fans are just loud in general even when idling on dashboard
---
Well, coming from an Ace main, gambling has been what kept me alive
---
Playing Dead by Daylight is not fun because everyone is broken as shit. Audio bug makes it really easy for me to play Killer, almost feels like cheating, especially when I slap on Stridor.
---
Playing Survivor is impossible, however. Playing VS Huntress is literally impossible because you never know what direction she's coming from or how close she is due to her song being so loud all the damn time. No chase music either.
---
They gotta fix this ASAP.
---
I've encountered a few, easily tracked through the enormous packets they suddenly get.
---
&gt; When survivors rush gens, they technically only do 2 objectives. 
---
Wrong. When you're on a gen, you're technically avoiding the killer, increasing the time you survive which increases your survival emblem.
---
&gt; It'd be better if everyone got their hooks, their pallet stuns, and their chases. 
---
What are you saying? Survivors need to give killers hooks? Killers need to give survivors stuns? Why should a survivor *not* do the objective when not being chased?
---
&gt; Thats why I wish survivors wouldnt be such coochie smokers and stop Urban-ing around popping gens like a teen with acne problems popping pimples. 
---
You're acting as if these survivors who run urban are good. They're not. If you were a se
---
mi-decent killer, those types of \*\*\*stealthy\*\*\* survivors will die quickly; combating gen rush.
---
&gt; Just loop the killer, get downed, have a friend save you, and do it all again. 
---
How is this related to gen rushing?
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I do agree that weaker killers (such as Freddy, Wraith, etc...) struggle with map control, but does that mean survivors need to *not* do gens because they're popping too fast?
---
rainbow six siege does it in game and on Home
---
"quiet as a dead hooker" that's a, that's a little specific there don't you think?
---
Yeah, and that requires people to give up a perk slot to have that power. And in that second scenario, you're more at risk for being found by the killer.
---
The real question is, where did Dwight get the slice of pizza ?
---
Answer?
---
He's Dwight, just accept it.
---
If you played on steam, i'm nearly sure you keep your save data
---
No, not necessarily. There are several open, flat maps that you can see the killer at a hook from a huge distance, like some of the auto haven maps, some of the coldwind maps, etc. The only ones I see a lot of use out of kindred would be Lerys or the game, and some of the maps with a big building or lots of jungle gyms.
---
Blendette tum tums is best tum tums.

gotcha
---
I do this every game when someone lends me a hand. A strong sense of camaraderie happens.

Self Care is the worst perk in the game, change my mind
---
I Didn’t see anyone post this image. I came across it on my own on a different site. There’s no need to be shitty towards people for No reason. Nonetheless, I still hope you have a good day.
---
Funny enough I just had a quick game as Billy.
---
Match starts I saw my way to a gen and 2 survivors are working on it.
---
I instantly down the first one as soon as I reach them on my first saw use then I saw the other survivor who was also working on a gen.
---
Then after I hook one I see the aura of another survivor via BBQ.
---
I saw my way to him and instantly down him as well.
---
At that point I've down 3 survivors then one of them DC.
---
It was the one who wasn't downed so they basically doomed the whole team.
---
I hook the third guy and before I hook the second one who I slugged the first one I hooked managed to free himself and I instantly down him and hook him again and then I see the aura of the second survivor who i slugged then I went to them and hooked them.
---
The match couldn't have been longer than 3 minutes that was possibly the fastest match i ever had as Billy.
---
I used steam, thanks for the info
---
ive been playing since release and im devotion 1 with 1016 hours

I thought my ps4 was just old 🤣🤣🤣

Wastes a lot of time with the slow ass healing but I hate having to bring in a medkit

This looks like it’s on PlayStation, requires more effort to talk shit with a controller.

the doctor can literally just stand there like on the game map and you can just do nothing

if he’s running restraint??? lmao he knows what box you’re at good luck

only if we can get amanda in a bikini too
---
Aggressive. While it might not be king like it used to, it’s still very strong, especially in solo play.  If you have  ever played this game (or any other), you’d know how awful it is relying on others for even basic tasks.
---
They are just in an SWF with possibly only one other survivor.
---
Like?
---
If he said that on the stream report it to twitch. If he said it in post game chat I believe there’s a way to report things after the game has ended(no clue how sorry) but I’d go to the video on twitch and grab a few screenshots of what he typed to send with the report. Sorry that this happened, it sucks.
---
They were just scared they were gonna have their recent $5 purchase freddified like fredward was.
---
Learn to pallet loop (and not be toxic if you do that, IK it increases chances of being camped).  Also you might want to just play a stealthy gen-rusher until you rank up a few times.
---
  
---
Otherwise you could swf and have teammate with borrowed time.
---
Myers takes time and consistency, roastface could just have it for free.
---
I mean spirit is a pretty good killer plus you get haunted grounds and spirit fury
---
Just to slow the game down just a lil bit for both sides
---
You forgot Wake Up after it got fixed
---
I think it's interesting to note that people would rather use a perk that directly cripples you over a perk that does practically nothing like Left Behind.
---
I already have the spirit.
---
So... what was the point of this?
---
Playing survivor has felt weak and unfair since the event has started and idk why but it feels super weak. Before it felt more fair
---
It is a game mechanic now.

I can’t loop the killer the whole game. Especially with low rank survivors, and SWF isn’t an option for me right now. I’ll try to stealth gen rush one pip at a time and see how well that works. Thanks!
---
Thanks, I hate regular show now.
---
You should also get credit for generators done when on the hook with the killer in a certain range. 
---
Devs want to address "I ran the killer for 5 gens but depipped" but "I was facecamped and depipped" should be addressed too.
---
This comment pretty much sums it up. But honestly, if you really want to get out of those ranks, play alone. Because it takes YEARS to find a game.
---
I'll also argue that Ace has worse perks than Quentin, Ace in the Hole doesn't help out too much, Up the Ante is useless, and Open Handed is only useful with perks like Bond.
---
Yall mother fuckers better keep these guys comments in the right order
---
Don't go for saves, only heal if they come to you, otherwise keep your head down and focus on gens, if you happen to be tunneled, well the only thing you can do is "git gud" in that situation but for the most part remaining unseen helps a lot. I'd recommend tracking perks, alert from Feng min is great, to start, also use dark sense to help you avoid the killer. (I'm sure you already knew this but you should definitely have one of these perks at all times)
---
I got the horses in the back
---
Hey, stealth gen rush is what ranked me up a ton.  Meg main and Im proud haha.  Good luck mate
---
&gt;Pig is arguably better than Clown.
---
Could be for some, not the majority. My comment is based on common knowledge and also personal opinion. If someone out there manages to play Pig better than Nurse or whatever, that's an exception.
---
Both killers are fairly weak but Clown can shut down loops way faster and more reliably than Pig. She can try to use her Dash but not all loops are "dashable" and you also need the survivor to make a mistake or stay in that loop rather than running to the next one.
---
Her RBTs need activation and often times you won't be able to down a survivor before the next generator is completed. Once activated, you still need RNG to help you out and prevent that survivor from removing it first try.
---
Pig is actually really nice, most people don't use she at 100%
---
116 cakes and 23 ebony moris...... I'm not saying I'm jealous, but I'm HELLA jealous
---
who is the last one? i cannot for the life of me remember all the killers.
---
Or they coulda just yeeted the fuck outta there, which is what I like to do.
---
And I dont want to chase people around for 30minutes to be teabagged at the gate.
---
We all want to win but for some reason if killers actually try they're bad people
---
Old Tinkerer was best with Myers and Huntress, the main reason it was changed was because of "machine gun Hatchets"
---
I still use premonition
---
LMFAO WHAT how are long speedos turned into boxers. we shall just call them long speedos.
---
Same here man I play on console as well, she’s got a lot of skill to master and you can become really lethal if you get her ability down pat. I love how I can just grab people so easily and scare the shit out of them.
---
You can get a 4k without running purple and pink addons with an ebony mori
---
is it a banana hammock we’re thinking of?
---
Hill Billy?
---
Because it's still used frequently
---
Well at the start check the farthest generators since they should be on generators in the start and when you hook someone if your BBQ doesn't show any survivor auras that means they are very close to the hooked person or in a locker. About finding the last person is just luck at that point as they will most likely being looking for hatch or camping near the exit gates if you closed it
---
Interesting. I’m glad you told me before I tried refunding a copy.
---
ah yes, i zoomed in an saw the weird stretched skin.
---
It's been going on for 20 minutes
---
Damn that's too bad. The addons do stack for 50% cdr tho, so it's still possible to meme but not that well. Thanks for the answer.
---
Yeah it’s one of the most satisfying things in the game. Alongside long chainsaws with billy

gens are easier than looping

---
Nope, we use the male one for mixed gender plural, for the rest we use latina or latino. The x or e are incorrect.
---
Anything that helps you feel less bad, mate.
---
My ps4 only does it when I play killer. That framerate drop is crazy.
---
oh well idk ive seen latinx used more recently
---
I get that too I just don’t see a basement build itself being inherently toxic. Depends on how the killer plays it
---
I looked and i just got pictures of either bananas in hammocks or people dressed as bananas in hammocks, but there was a single Borat picture that led me to the answer.
---
It's a Mankini.
---
hey, you know what would help a lot in this situation? Left Behind :\^)
---
🤣🤣 &amp; yes!!! finally, we have the answer!
---
I play pig so I can oink at survs and make them crouch around with me
---
End game chat on console lol.
---
How does NOED help stop gen rushing or survivors using keys? If anything you're encouraging the survivors to gen rush just so you can get to NOED
---
Yeah, it's some stuff from feminists, they also use words like latine, but the RAE has stated it is incorrect.
---
Never leave a baby Dwight or Meg behind. Even if it costs you your own life
---
If they survive, but I end up dying that's still a win in my book.
---
It does, 1st 4 released survivors had a white male and woman where the woman was in a more dominant profile, then a black  woman and an ethnic/asian guy, they definitely werent boring with their characters.
---
Am I the only o ethat wants Mettle of man and we are fin a live forever to be the same perk? It would give the extra hit and the bonus BP i think it would make both good and it could be nerfed to only be for protection it and not unhooks if it's to strong
---
I also have franklins to make people drop there stuff lol
---
I would have more but I’m putting all my blood points into Freddy atm
---
Wow, that looks just like her.
---
Yes
---
Truly this was the most enlightening conversation i've ever had!
---
The one that hides the jigsaw boxes if not activated should be built in, and it should come back as that add-on I think. I have a lot of opinions about pig, such as her 12-meter notes add-on being increased since she's not invisible like Wraith. But they didnt change legions wraith add-on copy, fuming mixtape, I doubt they'll change Pigs rip off add-on
---
I dont know for sure if it contributes here but i know european languages have masculine and feminine terms for words and generally words ending in "o" are masculine.
---
Feel less bad about what? Lmao
---
latine just sounds dumb. people need to stop getting representation for races that arent their own
---
They could have left. You aren't entitled to a four escape. 
---
Unless you're advocating buffing Remember Me, then I agree.
---
What did they do to premonition?  I love being sneaky with Prem III.
---
honestly same!
---
Deadhard is very counterable if you know they have it. Decisive? Just don't tunnel. Adrenaline? Useless up until endgame and grants finite help. Toolboxes? Really? You complain about an item? They won't be game-changing if you apply map pressure. Comparing those things to pink and purple addons and offerings is like comparing a dog to a gorilla in terms of strength.
---
Noed has helped me so many times lol especially when a survivor is the last alive and I close hatch..they get the door open but then I get them or when my ruin gets destroyed I have noed lol it takes away 50% of the stress from ruin being destroyed because I know I have that
---
I’m relatively new to this and have no idea how to post it properly
---
There is not enough time to go through multiple jigsaw boxes and escape EGC. 
---
Just stop.
---
Don't sleep on tenacity
---
How did he not earn it? Survivors had already opened the gate. The three of them could have left the other guy to die and escaped. They stayed behind to try and bodyblock and secure their four escape, and died because of it. He's well within his rights to taunt the entitled survivors IMO
---
I don’t think anyone believes this guy drew this
---
It was a ptb where you had to play 15 matches as survivor o killer without using anything (items, offerings,etc)
---
That isn’t the point. The point is so that the artist gets their credit and they are sourced for their work.
---
That came across way more hostile then I meant it too! Sorry. If you're on Xbox you can do a recording of the action if you hit the middle button and then press X. If your on playstation its basically the same, press the button and then square and it will record the last five minutes and you can edit it in the files later!
---
Im not complaining about items. I'm saying theres a really dumb double standard which I like to gladly ignore.
---
I don’t main Claudette but I needed self care so yea
---
Is tunneling toxic?
---
It’s not that serious
---
It was a pleasure, but now I once again lurk upon this subreddit and dissapear into anonymity.
---
Unless someone starts talking shit about Legion.
---
Childhood Trauma
---
He would be fast, one hit you, but he would also have low hp just for balance, and if you dodged him, and he ran into the wall, you would be able to hit him! For an easter egg, if he missed you 5 times, he would start using a hammer instead of his chainsaw
---
as do i. 
---
unless someone talks shit about noob3 and tru3.
---
The scars run deep...
---
I dont play any game with the intention of making other people feel bad, not because im overly empathetic, not because i have a cause to see through, not because i think i should, but because i dont derive pleasure from dishing out negative energy to someone else, anyone who BM's has no excuse, they are simply a hurtful person no matter how minor the action is, theyre still doing something on the premise of putting them down while propping themselves up.
---
Sure there is! After all 50% of the time it's in the first goddamn box they check. 
---
Endgame collapse is 2 minutes which is more than enough time to check a few boxes. RBT timer is 2 minutes 30 seconds.
---
If it's a big deal what if the EGC timer acted as if a survivor is downed/hooked when a trap is on someone's head?
---
In terms of "The Addon is overpowered" I doubt it's anywhere near as bad as Iri Heads or 5 blink nurse, etc.
---
I’m not screaming, am I? I am asking the artist gets their credit. Don’t see why you are involving yourself if you do not care. Move along if it isn’t a big deal.

Bruh you forgot situation 4 where you don’t heal yourself and you actually make progress on a gen. If you are good at looping, you don’t have to rely on taking a hit to escape a chase. Self care often wastes way too much time. You also presented extreme bias in your argument by using the word “immediate” while describing self care, as if it doesn’t take a long time to heal.
---
You are forgetting all the running around the map while using some stealth to make sure you go past Pig undetected plus the time it takes to search a box.
---
Even if you manage to remove it, there won't be enough time to reach the exit gates before EGC kills you. At this point, I rather just run through the exit gates to force RBT instead of wasting time since it is a lose-lose situation.
---
Sure thing, if they make a simple change. 
---
If the Pig is in a chase with you, or you're on the ground, you can run through the exit gate
---
Finding a good patrol rhythm for your map/situation. Don’t let them get the middle gens, since if they do the last few gens could be across from each other.
---
Involving myself in what? I just replied to your comment lol
---
claudette’s face looks awesome on him
---
i was thinking that maybe after they make Rule Set No.2 in her base kit, the new Rule Set No.2 should activate the RTB when the survivor leaves dying state? however i know things and everybody is gonna say that would be OP sooooo whatever
---
The survivors can’t tell me to harm myself if they can’t talk to me in the first place **taps head**
---
That’s exactly what getting involved means. If you don’t care for the topic of sourcing artists, then don’t worry about my comments.
---
At the lower ranks (20 to 15) you won't have much luck finding survivors because they more often than not, they are more busy hiding than actually playing. As a killer you look for survivors actively working on generators and the general area of them. 
---
If a survivor is only focused on hiding, you pretty much can't find him without Whispers.
---
Is it over yet?
---
Would make sense since he would probably figure trying to saw you isnt working so he goes with a good old fashioned hammer
---
I agree! He makes her look so easy :P I'd say she's more fun than most killers, but I haven't given her a fair shot myself
---
The best one I saw this week!
---
This is not the case anymore. Ever since the framerate has improved on ps4, I get pretty godlike Nurses regulary at high ranks.
---
Yeah but you dont actually see the after affects of you know being cut its just blood squirting thats all
---
If you do really well, you can also gain two pips.
---
let the gods in Behaviour hear you!

Anything related to licensed killers will only be buyable with just money, since a part goes to the license holders.

Just reading this fucking triggers me

&gt;”saves your ass” “gets hooked” 
---
Pick one
---
Why did we need to know this
---
I think they should add Leatherface masks for the new survivors. Give him something to do again. The Nea face would be scarier than any killer cosmetic. 
---
Also I think it should come with their hair. Could you imagine Bubba with Meg's hair or Nea's beanie.
---
Honestly, I think the RBTs should start on.  As soon as you're out of dying state or off the hook it should be on.  
---
I'm also tired of people leaving with RBTs on their head and not dying.  
---
She's a low tier killer.  How could buffing her possibly hurt?
---
Forgot to hit the reply button bud
---
I tried it out and still felt that the cool-down is completely unnecessary. Knowing where pallets are is nice but I don't need a perk to do that.
---
Likewise I tried Streetwise and items last a *looooooong* time when you have it equipped but the thing is that the items end up lasting *too* long.
---
Guess I'm sticking with Self Care, Balanced Landing, Spine Chill, and Borrowed Time again. Sigh.

Who is Venomoth supposed to be?
---
Amazing work! I can’t pick a favorite.
---
That’s my bad lol. In any case, you understand my point so I see no reason to keep going.
---
I'm a P3 Leather main who also still doesn't have his Jake mask yet. They truly are a rare breed.
---
The real question is, why did Dwight come out of his locker?
---
I didn’t say no one could reply to my comment. I said that if he didn’t care for my topic, then he was free to move past it. He saw it as no big deal, so I don’t see why he kept pushing it.
---
Same. Whenever I'm in a game, its just silent, but on the start screen...

#THE SOUNDS OF BEING RIGHT NEXT TO A JET ENGINE
---
Actually there's been a lot of talk, especially from the young latin-americans to change it to latinx because not everyone fits the latino/latina idea.  It's not super widely used but it's gaining traction
---
Yee and I can’t say it with enough meaning, Haw
---
Well I mean, I wouldn’t know about killer DCs since I only play killed and don’t DC. My only experience with it is watching survivors throw a hissy fit if they get downed at all or I play a build that they deem is too strong or some garbage like that.
---
sure
---
whats the psn
---
Rin (spirit) is Japanese
---
Was Rank 5. Went up against a Rank 1 Nurse.
---
Allies were Rank 7 and below.
---
Okay then. :)
---
I’ve been playing fairly obsessively over the last year and although I am certainly not the greatest, I’d be happy to play sometime if I can at all help. My sister (green ranks) and I (red-purple ranks) play together often so as long as you’re cool with fun games that are sometimes disasters, maybe we can try sometime! (: 
---
PSN: Wicked-Hardcorg
---
Spirit doesnt have alot of clothing ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I did it.  I conquered my friends.  Most of my friends that were playing R6S earlier in the week have now purchased and voiced their enjoyment of DBD.  I will never be without an SWF group again, never again will I stare into the deep, soulless eyes of solo queue.
---
If you look closely, you'll notice that you're both attempting to make identical points in opposite directions. You're telling him "You shouldn't reply if you don't think it's a big deal" and he's telling you "It's not a big deal, and therefore not worth mentioning in the first place"
---
I've had games as killer where they just ditch the last survivor, even when its their first hook. I feel bad for the hooked Survivor because they just got ditched for no reason.
---
Sounds really cool but the hatred perk on killer being able to always see the obsession would be reeeeealllly tough to counter. Maybe it should be that you could see the aura of the obsession when they're crouched, or running, or something like that. Not all the time though :p
---
Pretty sure she's from pennsylvania lol
---
Idk where the southern archetype came from
---
Tonight, you will be visited by three plagues, each worse than the last...
---
-The Basementface
---
-The camping Iri Huntress
---
-The ebony five blink P3 Nurse that slugs and BMs
---
Kektop
---
Jokes aside Jake is really underrated. He's got good perk~~s (hey at least he has Iron Will)~~ and generally good cosmetics that help him stealth well.
---
Do gens and leave used to be the best way to punish the killer for this, now thanks to the improved scoring... (fucking thanks BHVR) you punish yourself for leaving. It's like BHVR wants you to play a certain way only....You now have to actively give the killer points if you wanna pip...(yes rank means nothing)
---
It just strikes me so much that you put her at the power level of freddy and legion
---
Jake has a yee haw cosmetic, we need Kate to have a yee haw cosmetic
---
~And we need Dutch Cosmetic for Ace~
---
Whispers, Spies From The Shadows, Stridor (Tier 3 only).
---
I did not know Time's Up gave so many points, I think Ive only had one.  Time to break out the slug build :^)
---
omg I just got the connection of ghostface (Scream) and the painting Scream by Edvard Munch
---
I only use Nurse for a trophy, and trust me, getting 100 blink hits is not fun. Better than 500 Doctor Shocks though.
---
How do I get this perk
---
The goal is to kill people lol if that means playing dirty I will haha...btw i this community downvotes for everything
---
Dont forget Blood Warden!
---
What do you mean?
---
have you tried Until Dawn ? i love that game but i got worried for a while it really is loud
---
the pig would most likely be looking for the person with the trap so you would have to get stupid lucky
---
Maybe combine the two? Have a top down killer that orders around 4 AIs?
---
I did this. 2 died at 2 gens left. One DC'd the give the other Claudette the hatch lmao
---
what is wrong with it?
---
spirit for once you reach the red ranks,for the rest legion can be fun to play in tiers between 8-20,you can still play legion until there but I would say use that time to learn the spirit between the purple and red ranks,
---
spirit is far better but if you want to play legion do it this game can't be taken seriously so why bother,
---
if I was at your place though I would pick spirit.
---
but yeah you shouldn't care to much you will pick every DLC anyway.
---
Yeah I'll delete it
---
Can’t wait for the real servers and DC penalty. Today alone I’ve had someone DC as soon as they saw me, one DC when they found out I had ruin, and one DC when they tried to killer shack me when I pulled their bitch ass out the window.

The rage messages make being a killer main a lot more fun lol.
---
You wait till you get to Rank 1, it's a right salt fest 😂
---
I’m a survivor main and I always get hate mail from my teammates 😂 And they get even more pissed when I respond with “love you too &lt;3”
---
I hate ghostface's new aura perk though, it counters that entire setup
---
Holy shit this was my friend. I was spectating after I died and on my screen he just slammed into the door as it was opening and slid with it
---
I tried saving this last guy because the other 2 died &amp; DC’d but ya know-
---
You used your power far too much according to BHVR. *get rekt*
---
I'll be sure to check em out, thanks for the links

-PS4 overheating-
---
They really should have more rewards than just shards for leveling up. Like maybe throw in some auric cells, or even exclusive cosmetics, like legacy cosmetics before the bloodweb got reworked.
---
*curse noises*
---
Or just three matches of Plague haha
---
The only bundles are the Halloween Bundle and the Saw bundle, each comes with only 1 DLC on top of the base game. A fair amount of DLC can be grinded for using an in-game currency earnt by playing, but anything licensed (Halloween, Saw, Nightmare on Elm Street, Ghostface, Leatherface, Ash vs Evil Dead) will always require spending money. That said all the DLC goes on sale pretty often.
---
Each DLC (except Leatherface, Ghostface, and Ace) comes with both a survivor and a killer. Survivors are essentially skins, but each comes with 3 unique perks that can be unlocked for other survivors by levelling the character up. Killers each have a different power, so each is like a significantly different mode to killer. They also have perks that work the same way. Perks can be obtained by grinding without owning DLC, but it's only 4 per week and random which are available, it's not a reliable system to wait on.
---
Most of the strong killers (Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress) are free, and others (Hag, Spirit) are able to be grinded for. The only top meta survivor perk locked behind paid DLC is in the Halloween pack. The only top meta killer perk locked behind paid DLC is in the Leatherface pack.
---
There are several new player resources but the in game tutorials cover most of the basics. Beyond that experience, and looking at what other players do is as good as most resources early on, and most tutorials are better for advanced tactics/builds that will take a long time to practice or put together anyway.
---
Overall, I'd recommend:
---
* Buy the Dead by Daylight: Halloween Edition through steam. (Base game + Halloween = 6 killers and 8 survivors)
---
* Buy the paid in game currency "auric cells" and purchase Leatherface through the in game store. Leatherface is CHEAPER through the in game store than through the steam store.
---
* From there, grind what free characters you can, by the time you have enough to grab one, you'll probably have a good idea of what you want. Probably Spirit or Hag.
---
burse is better unless you suck at nurse

---
And white doesn’t mean their the same race btw but I know that’s probably a little hard to understand.
---
im new to the game but is it possible to break all the hooks?
---
I dont think being able to travel through everything and see everyone during that travel is any similar and comparable to be faster and invisible during a short period of time
---
i dig this. 10/10 would main.
---
TBH I love this map and the indoor ones even though they’re not the best for killers, it’s a change comparing to all the outdoors ones with 87 variant each.
---
I think you meant to respond to /u/Monckey100.
---
Spirit is definitely top tier, but most definitely not better than a God Nurse.
---
It’s pretty crazy , one of us was already on the gen , and i folowed the second to work on the same gen , the moment we entered the room , the spirit ended her phase and.... you see the screenshot.. it’s just bad luck.
---
I just hit people cuz I like the sound and animation
---
Stealth/insta down killers get fisted in the chaser category. BHVR really needs to tweak the emblem system for killers. It’s nuts that using a killer’s power can work against them in pipping.
---
The nurse had her ups and down then also thou, she has gone from the best to worse back to best and blah. At one time she couldn't blink horizontally, at one time she couldn't control the length of the blink so survivors could just run at her. She once had reduced speed even while carrying a survivor making it kinda easy for survivors to wiggle out. She has been bugged for half the releases of maps so she had blink deadzones... She hasn't always been the monster we know today ;)
---
BREAKING NEWS: Claudette not as immersive as she thinks!
---
People need to remember it's supposed to be you scared that you could die any moment and your teamwork is all that can save you
---
I'd rather have pop than noed.. relying on noed is some rank 20 shit.
---
Basement hooks can not be broken, and every map has a basement
---
That may  be my fault.   
---
TBH though, when I do play survivor I see a lot of trappers and huntress's, but almost never see ghostie.   
---
Shame, he is really fun to play against
---
You know noed is used a lot in the lower ranks as well right? I could say the same about adrenaline lol
---
you can't stop the meme
---
the ghostface one is really clever
---
I do once a month, my PS4 is also in a well ventilated area with cool a/c air blowing on it, go to load up the game and this is the only time the auxiliary cooling fan turns on and sounds like a jet engine firing up. I can play any other game and my PS4 is whisper quiet! BhVR interactive has shit coding!
---
Killer main*
---
Huntress has always been directional. I will definitely say that it screwed with me today because I played against a P3 huntress, and could not tell where she was at all. Freddy on the other hand was never directional, with the lullaby. Just gotta watch for the grass moving on its own
---
All we can really assume is that it was a stealth buff to the huntress... ooooooooor BHVR bugged out another part of their game like usual
---
Ooh so it is common. My husband's ps4 pro goes crazy during the loading screen while my ps slim just cruises on like no biggie.
---
every killer main*
---
Shit if I could even get a game like that while playing killer, I’m gonna overlook that Mori I burned
---
Nurse can literally go through walls.
---
This + something for Devotion like a multiplier for your Shards or add BP Gain, like 10% for Devotion 1 20% Devotion 2 etc.. Or just specific amounts like 1000 Extra Shards, 100k BP for Devotion 1, then double the amount etc. Cosmetics would be nice too. 
---
If only they gave us anything in general for the hundreds of hours!
---
I remember I thought I was pre nerf legion cause I got all dc' s in a game. But I guess they think Freddy is god (which he is).
---
I'm in a similar position. Honestly, the game is just too hard right now. The only thing we can do is ask BHVR to buff survivors.
---
All the fucking time with red rank idiots and also purple braindead ranks! Any skill check they will miss didn’t matter what they are doing!
---
Nice editing and cute video. I find it adorable that huntress gasps a quick second when it happens
---
I don’t know if the survivors were bad or what but I managed to get a 4k at rank 10 with nurse on console was a pretty proud of myself
---
Yeah i get that part. At least double the Objective Point Cap with this perk or something.
---
The "traps set after all gens are done start active" mechanic should simply be reinstated. All they need to do is change how it interacts with the EDC instead of just removing it entirely because they couldn't be asked.
---
I’d make my friends main her. Perks that encourage your teammates to leave you hooked and let you die seem like a mistake
---
It’s a damn incredible name, isn’t it?
---
Perfectly balanced...
---
Shit the loading screen lagged again
---
I don’t get the point of these posts anymore. Like yeah we get it, this community is toxic and salty as fuck, no need to showcase it.
---
I like that suggestion as well! I just think it could be turned, that's all.
---
The biggest reason I don't use it is because the mangled debuff is so common at red ranks. Sitting and healing somewhere for like 40 seconds is an immense waste of time. Honestly though even without mangled it still takes too long for my liking, but I can understand why some solo survivors like it. I have had times where the ability to heal myself could've possibly saved my life but I just don't think it's worth the perk slot overall. Maybe if it was changed so you heal at 25%-30% reduced speed instead.
---
tell me that flair was there before this post
---
Wym?
---
500 doctor shocks was incredibly annoying but still easier than 100 blink hits (which im trying to do rn). i dont even want to think about the three blink yoink trophy or ill cry
---
Might have been that Franklin's demise
---
Have that clipped? Typical Claudette.
---
Eh. More shards, at least.
---
I meant to do that
---
Was this on xbox cause if it was it was me lol
---
The other week I replaced thermal paste and cleaned the inside of the PS4 now it is silent. I did the process myself too.
---
I’m 100% with this. If you helped me out of a sticky situation I will fucking sacrifice myself if it means you get out alive
---
That’d be a lamer reason than DCing cause I was Freddy
---
how is autodidact good pls gimme some fax
---
Noed on billy, weird pick
---
Sorry that it upsets you that there are more white People in this video game than any other but get over it. I couldn’t care less if this game had all black people or all Asian people and I certainly wouldn’t make an appreciation post if they added a white character. But that people nowadays always feeling entitled to having exactly what they want.
---
upon seeing this message ive gone to their social media listed in their descriptions and dm’ed them just to tell them they arent the best ...
---
they just casul level get the gem from sale.
---
cri when they ded,   
---
I am new in this game, ded a lot too but  I am learning and GG the killed..
---
too much salt can cause cancer too.
---
Oh, the Three Blink one? That's easy, I'll tell you how to get it.
---
1. Be nice to one of the survivors and tell them to do a Gen.
---
2. Triple blink to them and pull them off
---
Doing it without being friendly is impossible, as most non-potatos will run off if they see you
---
You’ve obviously never had a majority of video games never represent you and it shows. I’m not upset by any means. I simply wanted to show gratitude that this game I love represented me. Good bye.
---
Am I seeing double or were there 2 Quentins? That's the most Quentins I've seen in ages.
---
They got away and the killer downed someone else?
---
"A woods map" like the seven we have?
---
Look into replacing thermal paste it helped my PS4, now it sounds like when I first bought it.
---
Say it.... you know you want to.
---
i don't think that's the issue since it was like this when i first got it
---
It would be bad if he had NOED.
---
I believe it was pain killers who once said:
---
“you can easily beat bad nurse, you can beat an okay nurse, you can beat a good nurse, but you can’t beat a god nurse.”
---
its a common bug
---
The teachable perk is different from the perk itself. Each survivor just starts with the level 1 of each of their own unique perks unlocked, and the second and third levels are automatically put into the perk pool the bloodweb pulls from. Once you reach the level at which a teachable becomes available, a version of the perk that appears red will spawn in place of one the perks that you would ordinarily be able to unlock. Unlocking the teachable version will then allow that perk to spawn in other character's bloodwebs.
---
my boy wants me to block the killer from hitting him while he does the exit gate so i tried and was wondering if it was bad blocking
---
The Entity doesn't truly understand our world and how things work in our world, so it recreates it in it's approximation of the real thing.
---
Is this real?
---
imo prove thyself is stupidly powerful at Gen rushing especially when a killer doesn't have ruin or when ruin gets popped 5 seconds into the match. I think it should just be a blood point perk like, earn a 33.33% stackable bonus towards the object category up to 100%. but without the speed bonus
---
My brother is working on transitioning from a bubba main to a nurse main on our ps4. The games I’ve seen him endure... the games I’ve seen him snowball at purple ranks. It’s terrifying
---
Well, you cant block the gate completly, so I have no idea why he whines....Im glad I never Go on Voice with randoms
---
Self care. Yikes.
---
Some perks are simply considered better than others, and should be prioritized over other perks. I'd suggest reading around on what the best survivor perks so you know which ones you should focus on.
---
He's honestly just so bad. I like the character from Scream, but it's like Freddy, I'm just not so masochistic as to put myself through that.
---
There's also no bathrooms. You need to go outside and squat.
---
Truer words have never been spoken
---

Fun Fact the Ghostface we got is not from the movies but has many references to them like in his cosmetics saying all other Ghostfacea should've worn this
---
You’re just bad at nurse
---
Thats nice!
---
I forgot which but there’s a survivor perk that lets you sprint for a couple seconds when you’re being chased. Afterwards you get the exhausted effect. Not sure how long the cool down is but that could be it.
---
Lmao like people wanted to play with No Mither solo.
---
And David king doesn’t have a rugby outfit! These devs are missing out on the obvious good ideas I tell you
---
Oh yeah, definitely look up a video on YouTube. My PlayStation would sound like a jet engine taking off when I’d start up games, cleaned it out good and it stopped.
---
It did just get buffed to increase its viability at higher ranks, so I can definitely see it becoming stronger for gen protecting builds
---
This, Nurse is really about practicing her and staying calm when hunting down survivors. Chases end in a few seconds flat. I love console Nurse, red ranks are a breeze once you learn her
---
Pops always been good but it’s significantly better with the buff.
---
Yea kinda. Since they upped the timer for it it has become very strong and can regress generators to basically nothing.
---
is it Honestly this is it or this is it honestly
---
Isn't David English?
---
You should probably specify if your on console or not
---
It seems like you are Farley new to the game so just so you know blendettes are looked down upon, there’s nothing wrong with Claudette but it’s the blendettes that are hated
---
Ha goteemm
---
Make sure you do the survivor and killer tutorials. You get 25,000 blood points for completing each.

Nurse main here: I know how you feel. 
---
I was a scrublord Nurse main for hours after starting to play as her. She takes quite the time to master. It's just something you have to put time and effort into. 
---
Learning Nurse will start off with a lot of "Entity Displeased" and will end with a relentless amount of "Merciless killer"
---
Shit you're smarter than me
---
Yeah, this is a really good killer tip.
---
As always don’t forget to downvote the OP! Love seeing those 0 downvotes next to all of my new posts.
---
Can someone explain me why I keep getting downvoted for this comment while everyone is upvoting the main one? It always happen to be downvoted for the same idea and it's like "is this sub bipolar?"
---
Revealing him is weird because I've ran up to a Ghostface and didn't spot him but when I'm playing as Killer everyone can spot me even with the detection range reduction.
---
Hate the TV series mask. I only really like the original tbh.
---
It's not necessarily to increase speed. But it psychologically feels faster when you go from slow to not as slow vs just consistently not being as slow.

3k hrs here. Please kill rank reset! Who asked for it?!
---
Gay
---
sometimes you need to take a hit to continue a chase, this logic is flawed
---
Only if they shrink the tall killers. That would be hilarious.  Imagine a baby Bubba working on a gen right next to a Baby Doc.
---
It and traps going off of the Survivor tries to escape should be returned to her base kit and modified to work with the collapse (like maybe slowing down the EGC timer when someone has a trap on). It’s really annoying to have part of your power become completely useless. It’d also make the end game scarier against Pig and make Survivors think twice about opening an exit gate.
---
What the hell is latinx?

That only happens to me when i play Doom 2016.

Claud &gt; prayer bead spirit
---
Ummm he has his Rugby Training Jackets?
---
Doctor. He’s decent, very fun to play, has a contagious laugh and power, and has a low skill floor (how hard it is to pick something up). He does have a high skill ceiling (how hard it is to master something).
---
Ngl this is kinda Hilarious even tho I play survivor
---
And what was the point of that little story? Slow the game down joke was funny for the first 2 minutes.
---
His name would be "The Juice"
---
Having the doors pre-trapped as trapper when you close the hatch a d adrenaline pops on the last survivor is such a great feeling
---
One one hand, I’m like, relax buddy. On the other, I know it’s a salt post and you do say some genuinely objective and heartfelt niceties.  Kudos for getting the rage off your chest while still not being narrow minded.
---
What's yer offering?
---
I just thought of Nea using the Hag's mori. Not a pleasant thought
---
Apparently nobody reads comments before shouting their opinion out anymore lol
---
Watched a mate play her on console - it seems like measuring blink distance and getting the lunge right seems to be pretty hard. I feel for anyone who uses a controller, that would kill me
---
Its weak bc good players are matched with bad players. I gave up solo and swfd with my better surv friends and we started winning more consistently and having overall way better/fun matches. Not bc of voice but bc we were all decent survs.
---
Gl getting all 4 good survs together with a rank reset, terrible matchmaking and a ranking system that doesn't work.
---
I really don't understand the point of it to be honest. I personally just wish it wouldn't set you back as far if you weren't actively playing much during that period. Like maybe I'm a bit rusty now that I haven't been playing as much, but not rusty enough to warrant being in rank 16. Even if it sets you back maybe half as much as people who play the game a lot, that would be fine with me
---
Dear Stalker, Nurses, Sloppy Butcher, and Stridor if you have good directional ears.
---
your neice is a fucking noed cunt
---
Isnt this the normal game mode already? Cant differentiate because survivors are so OP
---
I think its a bug for doctor only, it happened to me i was doing a gen and a claudette got hit and i thought the doctor was camping her for ds or something and then i just find her in the ground and the doctor stuck in the pallet , i heal her and then i tried to debug him but i can't even with hits or vaulting the pallet so i decided to just give him some bloodpoints and then we all escape, poor doctor he was playing nice
---
Imagine worrying about DS in 2019.
---
\*axe throwing noises\*
---
You're objective is to have fun playing the game. Tunneling is douchy
---
yeah had the flair for a few weeks now
---
Nope that's a new bug xd

fix noed and ruin first, then haddonfield

do you even know what an infinite is?

Sounds like my job is to go easy on survivors because they're playing like idiots.

Don’t be that guy.

Getting unhooked in your face isn't that person's fault. You want to go after the idiot? Go after the farmer.
---
Whats wrong with ruin?
---
Ok dude we get it.  
---
Just like compressed air on your fan we know how to cool a PS4.
---
They're just salty they ran into a Freddy who knew what he was doing.
---
same on xbox s
---
You’re a big big dummy friend
---
Yes. Haddonfield is full of them, unless you’re going up against really stupid Survivors who don’t know how to do gens while you’re being looped at the 493rd window.
---
That is just Freddy recreating his scene from the first movie
---
No, it's definitely not the hooked person's fault but I'm not going to get the harder target out of some sense of morality. If you guys want to out a farmer I'll happily string them up but just playing like chumps I'm going to follow the target with the highest likelihood of a positive outcome. For example, if I'm running iridescent heads or the farmer is wounded too they may be the easier choice but when the hooked person is the smart choice to maximize sacrifices/mori's you can't blame the killer for killing.
---
This made me really sad
---
69,420 pls
---
Why are they disconnecting against a console nurse?
---
I would love that
---
Me @ the "Pretty Woman" Leatherface that we'll never get.
---
OP is running tinkerer and iron grasp, probably doesn’t have any better perks
---
You are now marked by the entity, you are the next survivor.
---
Yes but noed on billy lmao is like running noed on myers or ghostface
---
He gave it to Jake. (Giggity)
---
"This is why we don't invite Adiris to parties."
---
This is soooo cute
---
Get new friends

Sounds like you have the typical immersed gamer build, minus self care (good for you for not running that garbage perk). Forgive me if you don't play this way, and for assuming you do, but trying to hide all game is a terrible idea, and will frustrate a lot of your teammates. You'll get less practice at running the killer around, because you'll get found less. By hiding all game, the killer isn't going to spend a lot of time looking for you, so instead, the killer will just go after your other teammates instead, who aren't hiding. This will cause them to feel like they're getting tunneled more, since the odds of the killer finding them are significantly higher. You even referenced this yourself in your explanation:
---
&gt; because now they’re forced to find another survivor
---
 Now I understand console has a lot more spirits, so I'm completely fine, and almost encourage your use of iron will. But, I think you could get better mileage out of other perks besides sprint burst and urban though. Sprint burst basically forces you to walk around all game if you want to save your sprint burst. Balanced landing is a much better idea if you don't like dead hard, especially since it has an effect that works even if you are exhausted. Adrenaline can be used at the end of the game to basically save yourself from needing to heal, unbreakable can counter slugs (idk if console gets as many sluggers as PC does), and borrowed time is a great option too, as it can punish killers who try and tunnel the guy just on hook, and can be a life saver in end game situations. Those are my thoughts on your build, but then again, a lot of the logic here I'm applying is based on my experience on PC, and I have no idea what the game is like with a controller.
---
I don't understand why the devs made DS be an obsession perk that can start with someone randomly being obsession and they don't even have the perk (though someone else does). It should only be proc-ed on the person who had it.
---
If you just ingnore it and don’t get offended it has nothing to do with the game
---
Xdd
---
I like it - creative
---
Actually, no you don't. A lot of killers dodge like little bitches then come to reddit and complain about it. You're a perfect example.
---
Just level up clauddete and then meg (self care adrenaline)
---
Nurse's Calling is the best perk for nurse
---
Plague NOW would be considered Middle Eastern. So......
---
Trapper Hag
---
Spirit has perks that hard counter her though. Nurse has bullshit. Iron will can make tracking a hurt survivor hell. Spine chill can let you know when a spirit is bullshitting her power, or when she is actually phasing. It even counters prayer beads for fucks sake. If you're playing on console however, I agree that spirit is better than nurse. PC however? It's not even close.
---
Yes, toolboxes are toxic cancer... Dead hard too... And don't forget flashlights, big cancer.. and looping oh looping is even worse...
---
Decisive and mom wasn't fine as you can see, both have been changed.
---
What else do killer mains will complain about?
---
That they didn't get that 20 4k streak in a row, because they played against coordinate swf and "lost". 
---
And I like how this post is about how broken this build is, and easy to get 4k, but people still complain, because game is such a survivor favorived, even tho with spirit I wouldn't be surprised if you get at least 3k 90% of your games.
---
This isn’t always the case. My friend runs Decisive,
---
I do not. He has started the match as the obsession almost every game we’ve played this weekend. He has no other obsession perks equipped.
---
I personally think they could integrate Ruin into base mechanics. In an effort to reduce the necessity of a single perk, why dont they instead make something like the totem corresponds to the nearest gen and destroying the totem would remove the effect on the gen. Something like that.
---
I'm sorry, but like, some of those perks are actually good and very useful in certain builds.
---
Not complaining about those things, just the double standard that survivors can use anything in their arsenal to win but if you do it as a killer you're a piece of shit
---
Please ace in speedos
---
That's honestly the creepiest shit this game has going for it right now. Fuck.
---
Yea the obsession at start of the match doesn't mean too much, I've had games where killer and survivors don't have obsession perks and someone is still marked as obsession. It's definitely safe to go for obsession though, since the only time apart from the start of the game that someone is obsession is when they've already used DS and taken the role of obsession.
---
Depends on the team I suppose. I can loop just fine but I’ve grown tired of looping the killer only for teammates to be wasting time. The majority of the games my team escapes  because I’ve been on gens. Most of the time it’s just me doing 2-3+ gens by myself so we can all escape. Most survivors on console love their altruism and running around with flashlights without even being able to properly use them.
---
Question: Why not Wraith? Since it's cannon?
---
oof
---
I've seen killers so worried about being genrushed they run Ruin + Thanatophobia + Pop Goes the Weasel. It's annoyingly slow for everyone but we still pushed through anyway.
---
Huntress would be VERY Lady Maria.
---
Meg's ultimate sprint burst by becoming *the nurse*
---
It boils down to a few things:
---
- What rank are you? If you're playing at a rank below 15, there are not a lot of killers here, so you may run into the same ones. Same could occur at red ranks (although not as much)
---
- Where are you from? If you're from an area where not a lot of people play, you could be getting the same killer due to their game ending at the same time as yours, and you queuing at the same time. 
---
- What time are you playing? Similar to if you're in a location with less people, if you're playing during off hours this could definitely impact that.
---
If none of these apply, say you're rank 10, playing at peak hours, in a popular location, it may just be based on the fact the killer is readying up when you are, and that you have good qualifications to be matched up (nearby = low ping, same rank etc).
---
You’re just bad if you think that. 99% of good killers will get at least 2 kills no problem
---
Use that you want, devs put it in the game, you can use. And fuck that everyone thinks, and their made up how to play survivor/killer rules. Tbagging is toxic, camping is toxic, play how ever the fuck you want.
---
I learned the lunge attack in a hard way in my early matches after butt dancers and flashlight clicks
---
People literally do that all the time
---
Vommy mommy make food better
---
Sry for bad english
---
I don't recommend playing nurse if it's the first time playing killer, i highly recommend playing billy (he's so easy, even if you suck with chainsaw you could use it to move faster and be an m1 killer) and then nurse with these addons:
---
Pocket watch ( decreases fatigue time) and ataxic respiration or if you are poor catatonic boy's treasure (range of blink)
---
Perks that i use
---
NURSE'S CALLING 
---
BBQ
---
RUIN (idk why cuz they only can do 1 or 2 gens)
---
Sloppy butcher or tanatophobia (i recommend sloppybutcher because survivors will heal too many and nurses calling will be more usefull or you can change ruin with tanatophobia to be more usefull)
---
Rank 1 main nurse btw
---
God, I just cut myself on that edge
---
on xbox one the fans don't make really any sound it's weird why ps4 makes so much

No hooks are attached

Billy’s very high mobility and map control makes it useable, also unexpected on him. It’s okay, but I agree, enduring might be better.

No I hate pussies who hide all game. Dumbass.

This has counterplay too. It's called leaving before Blood Warden activates

Nice format lol
---
No no the first time i did good with her haha
---
Honestly, there's no rule that says you can't hurt their feelings
---
Lol. I love seeing the neas doing the window trick and failing or pointing at the other side of pallets and failing to throw them down.
---
The snorlax one is great!
---
I guess my 'fast' game wasn't so bad then. It was a few days ago so i might misremember some details but you'll get the gist. My chainsaw sprint at the start immediately hit 1 of 2 that came out of a corner. The 2nd one got so surprised i managed to hit her then down in less than 30s. The 3rd one popped out as i was carrying the 2nd so i dropped her and downed him in a chainsaw sprint. Then i saw the 1st being healed and lunged over. 1st got healed in time to get downed again. Then the 4th only managed to run for about 1 min. I hooked him then 2nd dced...
---
I pitied them so much i let the 1st struggle in front of the 4th so she can unhook...but she just ran away. I awkwardly stared back and forth then just resumed the game as 4th died on hook. I shook my head as i saw her later on multiple times.
---
What you have is a solid build, I'd personally change spine chill for sprint burst
---
If this game took place in a 1 inch box you'd be right, but it doesnt... you have to find team mates to heal which takes time (usually more than 20 seconds mind you).
---
I personally don't get why people get so upset about NOED and other Add-ons that killers and survivors use. As a previous killer main(kinda survivor main now) I use to bitch about genrushing and stuff but when I played survivor I realized it's just the damn objective what else are they going to do, and if a killer is using a OP add-on or offering they worked for the bloodpoints to use it and I'm not going to judge them for using it. Honestly hate this community sometimes.
---
I just recently started playing about two weeks ago and started off spending most of my time as a killer and this is exactly what happened to me. Constant comments about running No One Escapes Death and I had fucking no clue why. I picked it because it seemed to help me when the gates are open and starting off the survivors ALWAYS got the gates open on me so in my mind it seemed like the logical perk to take. But holy shit did it awaken some evil in the people I played. I might as well have called their children ugly or something.
---
Look it up, even on this subreddit. It happens. It's happened to me once before. Idiots in post game chat tell me "gg you're not playing anymore" and then my net drops.
---
Is ghost face busted right now? I played one game earlier where the ghost face had killed us all in like 6 minutes (I'm new to this game). It was crazy .
---
I have that exact same hat.
---
Rugby is English sport...
---
Only time I'll be working on a gen injured is if my bois getting chased so I know I'm safe, or if its nearly done.
---
i think your line up is ok. self care at that tier feels like crap. if it were me, i would switch it up with sprint burst or kindred depending on your rank.
---
That’s not what you do, you actually have to replace the thermal paste. Takes about an hour
---
I love Dance with Me and run it on most of my survivors. Pair it with Lithe and it becomes insanely easy to lose the killer in a chase. I throw Quick &amp; Quiet into my DWM build on occasion too, never fails to bamboozle killers.
---
Agreed, these guys just dont understand every factor for time and think of the game as taking place in a 3 foot square box.
---
I feel like an escape should ALWAYS net you atleast 1 pip and a 4k should ALWAYS net you atleast 1 pip.
---
I mean, in both cases you did everything you had to. IE you either escaped (Survivor objective) or you killed them all (Killer objective).
---
Those 2 should always give you a pip, no matter your performance in other categories. If, for example, 3 survivors are on 1 gen and I down them all 3 with one chainsaw as LF, taking all of them down to the basement and the see the last guy with bbq, go up to him and down him too and hook him wherever. Why should that be a safety pip? Because I did't let them heal back up / unhook each other so I can get more chaser points? Ridiculous. Same as Survivor, I escaped. What more do you want me to do game? Risk my life again to get some more chase-escape points and throw some pallets on the killers face even if I could just walk out the exit? I'm out, I've proven that I'm able to survive. That should be the only requirement for a pip.
---
Doing your objective (Kill everyone / Escape) should always net you one pip, double pip should be for outstanding performance (i.e. all iridescent). Although I think it should even be reversed. Like why did a Killer do a better job when he had to hook all survivors 3 times and the exit gates were powered than a killer who hooked all 4 survivors at the same time like 2 minutes into the match. One is a close game, the other is a complete stomp. Why should a complete stomp reward less in terms of rank than a close game? The first stomps his current rank, why should BHVR artifically keep him there? The latter is of equal skill, hence the close game, why give him twice the rank-up?
---
Bruh
---
Almost sounds like a balance issue
---
Tan, long, and handsome
---
As a new player, it's hard to learn what "the right thing to do is" when you can't talk to your teammates. I had one guy after a game have an aneurism in the text box because he was the black chick and I tried to heal him. "REEEEEEE"
---
Wish I could have bought this game and been instantly good.
---
This was me yesterday. She managed to down one after another and no gens got done at all.
---
Omg that’s why I had the obsession status. I never knew that you could have it if someone else ran DS, I was so confused when I was the obsession and neither the killer or I had obsession perks.
---
Controller wasnt the problem it was frames i switched to pc a long time ago and play pretty much nothing but nurse on controller.
---
whenever i use DS or MoM  i am always the obsession, but thats just my luck i guess lol. 
---
either way besides dying light whats the point in tunneling the obsession? this isnt a big concern for most players i feel
---
I swear that every Clown I have ever seen who used a mori would just spam it because of how he laughs and stomps on your head at the start. I personally find it to be hilarious when I encounter it.
---
New player here. What do the totems do? I get like 600 points when I bust them, but does it give the killer any benefit? Thanks.

---
Adrenaline maybe?
---
Spirit is probably the best gameplay-wise, but Leatherface brings the best perk, BBQ and Chilli, for all killers.
---
You won me over with the “David = Myers” reasoning.
---
Oh yes that reminds me, you said you’re trying to learn Nurse and I’d recommend a YouTuber named Ardetha. He’s an amazing Nurse main and has a guide on her which also has great tips on how to play Killer in general.
---
Lmao claud
---
It depends on what tier it is and honestly how frustrated I get with it. If I hit the right skill checks I'll power through it.
---
Haha
---
I run bond.
---
If I see my teammates urban evading around the map doing fuckall, I know this is probably going to be the only gen worked on even if it's slower.
---
If I see people pushing through gens, or god forbid, gen tapping, I know I have some time to track down the totem.
---
That's what I've ran into a lot while trying to find things myself. The very basics are still mostly viable but a lot of stuff has been through nerf-buff cycles and it's hard to find a lot of concise information that's still current. The bulk of most recent info is unfortunately mid-2018.
---
Pain Reliever and Ulissys (Hope I spelt that right) do YouTube videos for how to play Killer and Survivor

Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame
---
Description: I used an offering to play as the cannibal and his chainsaw was bugged the whole match. The meter for revving the chainsaw was darkened and when it got to a full charge I didn't sprint. If I let go of the button early the chainsaw would be put down. Letting the chainsaw charge to full then releasing the button would do the normal attack when you let go. Map was Lery's Memorial Institute.
---
Screenshot: N/A
---
Steps to Reproduce, Results, Reproduction rate: I don't own Cannibal and would need to find another offering to attempt.
---
Literally. I asked something abt a killer, and people just said “lmao don’t tell them, they’re not a real fan if they don’t check the wiki” I thought they were joking. Nope!
---
It's the true counter to enduring+spirit fury
---
He was like "ah shit, here we go again.."
---
To put it simply, Claudette is just darker than other characters and it helps her blend into the environment a lot better.
---
Please no. They’d break the whole game. Lol
---
It depends on if I’m swf or not. My group of 4 has a designated totem hunter in cases of ruin so the other three do gens, but otherwise if I’m solo I’ll stay on a gen until someone else finds the totem.
---
No
---
Am I getting wooshed or am I the only one who saw the gen progress boost all the way up for a split second there?
---
*equiped

Therapist: slenderman Dwight isn't real, he can't hurt you...

Slenderman Dwight:
---
I reveal GF all day, even when I don’t want too like when looking for the hatch or hiding when trying to rescue someone from a hook, he glides into my view and then BAM. He’s exposed and my location is revealed.
---
No. It varies. It depends on rank, the killer, and how coordinated the survivors are.
---
I had the same problem for a long time, started watching streams, using discord groups, playing killer to understand their gameplay and thinking, and It helped out Immensely! I’ve improved my gameplay but also just having a team that you can communicate with does Wonders.
---
When you throw the pallet down when you’re stood right in the middle of it and you throw it down on the killers side
---
Thank u
---
He did a Pick Up Hard lol
---
As you rank up, you'll find more than capable survivors. You'll also be running into groups of 4 on comms who will be a nuisance. 
---
'Win condition' is a bit foggy in this game as to how determine it. 
---
I am a rank 3 killer and if I can kill two, I consider that a win for myself.
---
I will definitely check that out! For now i'm playing Billy and probably Huntress next, saving Nurse for last out of the three
---
Nurse?
---
You must have missed a shit ton of hatchets then
---
I power through Ruin because I don't want to waste time running around aimlessly. I'm not good at looking for hex totems.
---
I’m lovin’ that icon for the pig
---
As I tell every new Nurse main: 
---
WATCH. ARDETHA’S. VIDEOS.
---
More specifically, watch his Nurse guide. Not only is it a great guide for the Nurse but it also has tips on playing Killer in general.
---
Oh and, don’t use add-ons until you’ve learned how to control blinks. Then use ultra-blinks all you want, but if you use them while learning it’ll fuck up your muscle memory.
---
Just work through it.  Teamates that can't work through Ruin are worthless as you rank up and face it every game.
---
You’re telling me I cOuld finally hunt the evil as ash? Groovy

Haha they really haven't- I did get helpful answers to my questions on the sub but I still got the automatic downvotes. It sucked
---
Nea is the entity, this person is a genius!
---
Im pretty sure purple
---
I try to use stealth and be unpredictable in my patterns. One pallet, you try to loop, the next you ditch for somewhere else.
---
Nea should just come down and grab the sacrificed survivor when they die.
---
Gotta get this one in order. Help me out folks.
---
He's basically an m1 killer that has to wait a few seconds to hurt someone
---
Killer isn't fun neither when you chill too much imo.
---
I think they should revert the change they made to the survivor pip system. The last version was hard but at rank 10-8 you already had strong solo teams. People who weren't able to loop couldn't reach that point. And only the best were able to climb to red.
---
Yeah, I think they're all purple quality, with green being the lowest possible.
---
In the words of BrickyOrchid
---
&gt;Remember: play the game how *you* want to play. No made up honor code or fake ethics; do whatever it takes to win.
---
Look at my karma jusuf, you have no effect on me😎
---
First 4, and he has to sacrifice 25 of them
---
Not to mention killer obsession perks are somewhat rare, and changing the obsession around doesn't mean shit unless the killer is running one.
---
It's fancy and all but it's needlessly confusing for little to no benefit at all. Hell in most cases where it has an effect at all, it just means tunnel the shit out of the person who just DSed you because they're the one you need to kill for Dying Light or Remember Me. Or they're marked for Rancor. Or PWYF gains stacks from them. Only StBfL suddenly means avoid them and even then it's not really the most gamechanging perk these days.
---
Hey entity me please
---
It's a denial of service. Its hosted by the killer so they can easily get my ip address and do it lol
---
When nea can finnaly be in her true form for once
---
Pulling people of gens with ghost face, and or stalking them then instantly drowning early in the game
---
What in tarnation?
---
&gt;Do we know yet?
---
Nope. 
---
We won't know until they are released.
---
Speculations suggest they won't be here before 17th of July.
---
This made me literally lol. Oh man. I'd pay.
---
She's all about mind games. It's hard but you can put up a good fight. Manipulate whay she can use in her spirit walk. Scratch marks and noises. But she is really strong.
---
The last one is understandable, just find the hatch. When you close that thing, he needs to open the exit gates and you know where those are so :)
---
God I had a Rank 20 Dwight get me killed in the first minute of the game because we spawned together and he failed 5 skillchecks. Hillbilly came flying in outta left field sawed me down and nobody unhooked me. Most depressing match of my life.
---
I saw a clip on Instagram of someone doing this and not even trying to loop the shack a while ago and called them out on it
---
Their response? “As you can see from my other videos, I don’t need to depend on safe loops to run the killer around ;)”
---
biTCH
---
Claudette is the best killer after all
---
I think McLean said they are aware of the audio bugs. For all the shit devs get, at least they're good with looking at community stuff like Reddit and and social media
---
No one saw that, I have the whole end saved, I will upload the pic when Im at home ( If i wont forget it)
---
Dang it, I'd love to show you my ways, but my mic is pretty broken right now lol I need a new one. But I love answering questions while in game
---
Dwight when the killer pulls him out the locker.
---
Chainsawguyofamillionswings is much more left in my version, “Oh, You dodged my swing have you? Have another...And another! Look at that i’m even keeping pace! Have some more!”
---
Bitch, you are high if you think that the Hag is that low. The Hag is around the same strength as the Huntress and far less map reliant.
---
Oh geez that's me
---
Even if you killed 3 people you could say you won. But what killer do you play?
---
Use whatever perks you want. Thanks OP for stating this. There's nothing wrong with using NOED, it's the survivors fault they didn't destroy totems.
---
bug
---
Post some clips, because my (and clearly other commentors) experience has been that Ghostface can be revealed pretty stable and consistently. 
---
With some clips we can actually see what you're talking about and perhaps it's a user error and help you out
---
Downvoting is generally for marking content you feel does not belong on Reddit. It isn't really used to signal your displeasure of someone's particular strategy in a video game.
---
much funnier: swap one survivor's model with the killer's at random, and attach the red light and terror radius to that survivor
---
I can imagine that “hey guys !!!” While in that portal” and go “mehhhhhhhhhh” when she eats the survivors 😂😂😂
---
Perfection, especially when it's GF.
---
Were you the last one he killed?
---
Kobe off means you've put yourself into stage two of hook animation. So next hook is death hook. You sacrifice a "life" by unhooking yourself. Thus making the choice to do so more risky.
---
No there were still 2 other people left.

Depends on who you ask, like if you ask a survivor main like myself we'll say the killer should never win and every survivor should win every single time and if you kill me you're a toxic face camper who has no skill and needs to tunnel who plays broken characters that need to be nerfed and the map was broken also the devs should bow down to us denerf mettal of man and decisive stike... sorry what was the question again?
---
I stay on it, I can effectively hit great skill checks and odds are my teammates are looking for it. In the chance i screw up i bring the Killer towards me which allows them to get the totem which usually causes the killer to retreat and so I continue
---
Right under the hook is Meg’s hair
---
Thanks for this video I will watch and for the advice

I can tell you worked hard on this. I really like his backstory and the theme of it all. Very nice concept Good work!
---
Yeah I slapped it on and it helps in a surprising amount of ways. If I haven't scouted for tiles, I can tell exactly how a jungle gym is orientated and if there are any other things to use around it to make the most use of it, how the layout of buildings are before I run into a dead end, so many things
---
I will kindly ask where you got this information from and please send a link. If what you say is true then.....wow devs....just wow.
---
Cant anymore with end game collapse
---
Damn an actual explanation, respect
---
Oh
---
😭
---
When i play killer, noed activates 99/100 times
---
The counter is boring and time wasting and the points are shit too.
---
My favourite is when their team is bumrushing the hook like fools and i still get chewed out in chat for not ignoring my whole objective.
---
Cute idea, sadly they’ve completely broken the game trying to do less. lol
---
They suck balls I’ve done a all-nighter and I’m still up at 9:30 so my brain is on automatic
---
Basement build?
---
I really don't get how people put GF higher than Michael.
---
Huntress basement. Monto needs to do it
---
*Wack*
---
Nurse's, Deerstalker, Bitter Murmur, Stridor for me
---
I completely agree. If a killer or survivor use a perk I don't like because it's very powerful then I don't blame them. Instead I say gg well played and move on because you can't blame people for using powerful perks to win. Look at it this way, would you rather use a perk that's not very useful or one that is very useful. My point is let people use whatever perks and powers they want. If it's to powerful and op then blame the game and hope it gets nerfed. Players just want to win and/or have fun. It's a great game and we shouldn't bring it down with toxicity
---
What?
---
I swear. Whenever I play KYF with worse friends I switch out my enduring spirit fury cause it's useless
---
Damn, if you’re gonna repost the *least* you could do is come up with a witty title

Oink

---
&gt; Self-care is barely even meta at red ranks these days
---
It's very very not.
---
It's the strongest Killer perk.
---
no one:
---
newbie survivors: *drops pallet*
---
Just imagine seeing Ace's grin when he pulls you into the dream world
---
Wack wack wack he goes
---
I honestly just had to look up what Solidarity was because I didn’t remember that being a perk that existed
---
As a result of this a few killers have decided to just stand on the hatch till they can get some kind of confirmation where the survivor is (either seeing them or by forcing them to work on gens) then kicking once they know they aren't right by a gate/where they are exactly
---
In my opinion Self Care is not helping you, I used it for a while but I realized that I focused too much on healing myself (which takes a lot of time) instead of acting.
---
I think Spine chill is a cool perk too but not necessary.
---
So my advice is to replace Self Care and Spine Chill by Dead Hard, a bit difficult to avoid walls by looking back but it saves you life a lot of times while looping if used correctly, and Decisive Strike.
---
Instead of raising his hand he uses fingerguns to shoot his power at you.
---
There is this golden lunchbox and a golden envelope as well.. and you can't get them. This is easily more important to that fact 50% of the time you can't break a GF out of stalk when he's in plain view....
---
&gt; It's really sad that there are people in the comments who feel the need to shame the Killer for using NOED when they likely didn't have anything better to use. (Judging by the use of Iron Grasp, Tinkerer, and Spirit Fury which was probably unlocked from a Shrine of Secrets.)
---
When 3 out of 4 perks are tier 3 it's hard to believe they don't have anything "better". Not to say it's a good thing to perk shame people, but using NOED is a choice, not an accident. It's a playstyle in the first place.
---
Just go to discord or Playstation also have the community of people where you can find swf team.
---
But the yee haw girl needs a Yee haw hat
---
I knew it. As soon as I put pig I knew one of you would show up😆
---
People calling for nerfs don't know how to play against him.
---
People calling for buffs don't know how to play as him.
---
Yes, there are.  You only get given two (Frank and Julie) when you buy Legion or the Darkness Amoung Us DLC.  You have to buy Suzie and Joey with Auric Cells or Iridescant Shards on top of the DLC which sucks
---
Exactly, you play scared. At red ranks players aren't afraid of a chase initiating when they're injured, so they do gens and progress the game. 
---
Not only that, self care is all or nothing. If you get 95% of the way thru a SC and you get found, then you've just wasted 30 seconds. It's a crutch perk for those who aren't confident in chases and need the extra health state.
---
Lol you’d be surprised how many of us pig mains are
---
out there
---
So by that logic then the whole unhook mechanic is really just a tease and a middle finger to survivors. They're damned if they do and damned if they don't. That's extremely unfair and honestly a waste of time and space in the game if that's the logic the devs have. 
---
"Survivors shouldn't be attempting to unhook themselves. That's what the team is for"
---
So what happens if you have an apathetic team or a team of cowards and you get on your first hook? Are you just supposed to sit there and accept dying on 1st hook? That completely ruins the game for the person who just died. 
---
I don't believe they should be punished for succeeding at doing something that's almost impossible to begin with.
---
I don’t have these perks sadly :( 
---
I have only been playing for 3 weeks so I only have teachable perks for meg and claudette
---
Ah I see, yeah he can be a little annoying
---
Did you waste your time?
---
I don’t think you know what it means
---
I know if any dbd post even hints at the pig there are so many oinks
---
Yes im sorry i dident know who made the gif so i couldent give credit
---
Not to be rude, no clue what your talking about here
---
It was fine, they could have just ran off of the gate sooner if they cared enough about getting hit there.
---
*mother he hath stabbed me*
---
You don't have to have the Cannibal because you can get it in the Shrine of Secrets, however, I think it's been there like 1 time so even though you can get it without him, it's completely ridiculous to think you're gonna get it in the Shrine.
---
You need to buy him and level to 35, this will make it then able to appear on the bloodwebs of all other killers you own.
---
Bear in mind you could have dog shit luck when leveling your other killers and not get BBQ for a while, unless you've got all Killer perks on them.
---
Or get it from the Shrine but it's only ever been on there twice, not bound to happen again for ages.
---
I know if any DBD post even hints at the pig its just filled with oinks
---
Very nice and good effort! But isn’t regressing a gen from 99 to 75% with no effort a little OP?
---
Right when I hook a survivor, I ask myself, “Are his friends gonna be smart or be heroic?” One or two try to be heroic…and die cause I cloak up as Wraith and patrol. Lots of salty messages
---
Just hold out on the dedicated servers. That's what I'm \[trying\] to do.
---
For more power main nurse if you looking for fun main clown so you can dance or billy to zoom around like a bike
---
It's hard sometimes :(
---
What does SWF stand for
---
Nobody likes him lol
---
Fair point. 
---
My original idea was that survivors could ignore marked generators and work on others, but I see how a killer could instantly shut down an entire side of the map that way... I will think of a replacement. One similar in spirit and function, but more fair for both sides! 
---
(thanks for the input, so far people liked it and it means the world to me)
---
I think its hilarious watching survivors do a dance pleasing for the exit gates
---
Yes, absolutely. Use whatever build you want, just don't expect people to not let you know their opinions about that build. If you make a post here, be prepared to read a lot of different comments. If I feel like using NOED and/or Ruin on stronger killers hinders your progress as a player, I will say that. Doesn't mean you have to listen to anyone.
---
Welcome in Dead by daylight :D
---
I’m sorry, Doctor is low tier?
---
Thank you! I made joke and memes on this page, but people saying they like my own idea is so much more gratifying, it means the world to me!
---
On the rare occasion you actually trigger it.
---
&gt; Self care is S tier on every tierlist and usually the top
---
It's like solid C tier at best- it's okay if you're still bad at the game and don't expect to exit the gates, but at high ranks it's a soft throw in many instances. Its only use case is giving an opportunity to make a safe save when the whole team is injured.
---
&gt;Windows is useless if you know the map or have eyes in your head.
---
Well the map literally randomly generates what tiles show up, and from a lot of angles you can't tell what you're dealing with until you're there. Helps you spot find useful windows/ pallets you legitimately couldn't see (Coldwind has a surprising amount amongst trees, and Swamp has shitloads of vaults)
---
It's not useless- not optimal, but it allows dipshits like me to use tiles totally optimally.
---
&gt;Pharmacy is literally a meme of how bad it is
---
I mean, it's flat out better than selfcare but okay
---
&gt;Resilience is just bad
---
B tier, EXTREMELY useful if you're with teammates who play well and don't run self care. Helps with genrush and helps with vault/ heal speed, and with a medkit you can 99% it and choose whenever you need that health state back
---
&gt;Self care-allows for use of a better item like a flashlight or toolboxes for more game save potential
---
True, but Iron Will fulfills the purpose for flashlight saves though
---
&gt;Urban evasion allows for better maneuvering without being seen and is a hard counter to hag
---
Hard counter to bad hags, unless you're literally going to be crawling around the ENTIRE match. Hag has the luxury of not needing to trap pallets/ windows, otherwise they're just going to get bullied by survivors repeatedly setting them off on purpose so she has zero domino potential. If anything it helps find Trapper's traps a lot quicker in tall grass.
---
Urban Evasion is a "yikes" tier perk- WONDERFUL if you're new to the game, but past rank 10 please stop running it.
---
&gt;Adrenaline single handedly wins games and opens so much save potential from tight games.
---
True. But it confuses me how you say self care is good but also acknowledge Adrenaline- playing optimally you can spend the time healing on gens instead and get the 0 time health state that way, for multiple people.
---
&gt;Borrowed time also single handedly saved lives and can mean the difference between a tunneled ally being killed and having the utility of all the survivors alive in the late game.
---
True- also a zero time health state
---
&gt;Dead hard is a reliable game changer for the first time its used... it can mean the difference between looping the killer for 2 or 3 gens early on or getting hooked early game.
---
You don't use it to repeatedly trick killer though. Most high tier players I've seen simply use it for distance to counteract bloodlust or bandaid fuckups. Works enough that it's a very high tier perk. Not to mention it's like a pseudo healthstate, and it also enables stuff like Resilience or Iron Will to be useful. You can even use it for hook saves.
---
&gt;Balanced landing opens vast new looping potentials and can save you from a loop counter and increase your chase time 10 fold.
---
True but it's so use-case. It's inconsistent enough to make the downfalls of Dead Hard negligable for how overall useful it is. If I had the option to not trigger balanced landing's exhaustion, I'd run it, but the fact that it cockblocks dead hard is kind of a deal breaker.
---
&gt;Lithe same as balanced landing this can save you from a bad corner of the map and help you escape to better loop territory big game changer.
---
Ehhh... Lithe is arguably only a little better than Sprint Burst, and SB is already like really dogshit.
---
&gt;Iron will this is the hardest counter to stealth killers in the game behind object, being able to silently traverse while injured aswell as heal can mean the difference between being found and being bypassed.
---
Good killers usually find and track people through grass noises, so it's not that big of a deal changer late game. It makes certain tiles way easier to mindgame against killers while you're injured, and it cucks Spirit/ Nurse a bit too.
---
But stealth doesn't really play a part in the meta- it's handy to lose the killer if EVERYONE on the team is good at chases, but when I ran Iron Will I wanted the killer to chase me instead of teammates because they were so bad at using pallets/ tiles well and wasted a lot of potential on too many maps. Every time I lost the killer the rest of the team got downed too quick.
---
&gt;We're gunna live forever is a game changer and means the difference between a loose tunnel being successful and you healing your ally.... this when used in groups can make a heal instantaneous.
---
I think you mean We'll make it- I rarely ever see instances where healing off the hook is a good idea- it can be okay but with more and more people understanding genrush and running perks like dead hard/ resilience you can risk quite a bit to pull off a heal when you could've fucked off and worked on a gen.
---
&gt;Deliverance is a situational but extremely good perk that opens up new windows for allies and allows you to save yourself from the hook without putting an ally at risk... this counters all forms of aggressive killers and is the safest hook rescue tool in the game.
---
It and Unbreakable can turn a "gg 4k" into a 4 escape- an unreal amount of pressure taken off the killer, and if other players are slugged it usually dominoes into everyone getting picked up.
---
DS is still also pretty handy, not just for tunnel killers but you combine it with deliverance or unbreakable and you got a free escape if a door is open or a hail mary needs to be made
---
No problem, if you don't plan to buy Laurie Stroke's DLC take a look sometimes to the shop if Decisive Strike is available (you can buy it with free shards that you earn by leveling up). You can get Dead Hard with David King. Also your perk set is quite good to start. Have fun ;)
---
If they add it lots of problems would be solved
---
Depends. If there is another person on the gen with me, it's kinda of a 'who goes first?' game. One usually stays and keeps it going \[cause why not\] while the other searches. If you have Prove Thyself with someone else, and/or a Toolbox though, sometimes it can be powered through. SWF is very good for countering totems, especially hexes too.
---
BHvr has failed us yet again
---
No, just fix the damn achievement so it requires a 4K again like it used to.
---
Currently a survivor can hop in a locker, go watch pornhub with their thumb up their ass while everyone else dies, then yeet into the hatch and get the adept achievement, while a killer can work their fucking ass off, but not get adept because they didn't get all Iri emblems or survivors died too fast, or they used insta-downs too much and didn't get enough hits, or survivors DC'd, etc.
---
ENTITY DISPLEASED
---
Not legion, that's for sure, the other 2 are ok
---
Dude 80% of all map spots require you to take a hit if your not prepared for the killers approach... sounds pretty shitty if your one shot cause you didnt bring self care.
---
And dont you fucking high road red ranks have killers hitting your dumb ass all the fucking time, survivors arent OP...
---
And if you had yourself some self care action you could have your toolbox to repair gens faster in the off time...while also saving yourself searching time and your allies healing time... it's a lovely little perk that aids every hard purple flashlight looper like myself who forces the killer to chase me until he gives up...  in which I immediately am able to heal cause THANK YOU SELF CARE!
---
My 3 toolbox team mates can easily complete 3 gens every time I'm in a chase and I saved myself time from needing to walk around moaning my ass off getting to them so they can heal me... and I allowed them extra gen time.
---
Unluckily for me killers at red ranks are good and most times in most situations I'm going to need to tank a hit to get to the looping location if good potential rather than some stupid fuckin barrel pallet...
---
So if I was injured all the time cause I dont have self care and 'I'm mr. White rank reddit badass who needs to pretend to feel good'... no of I'm wondering around injured ima be heard, found, and 1 hit cause I'm not gunna be at the killer shack all game...
---
So I heal, complete objectives until I'm chased in which j process to loop with whatever area I'm able to reach in-time...  if it's not a good loop than  I'll take a hit and move to one I know I can maintain safely.
---
That sir is some real red ranks dbdl, pull your head out of your ass and use logic to add time value numbers to actual in-game probabilities
---
Why limit yourself, play as many as possible.
---
Out of the loop, what happened?
---
If u want to be an asshole, get the mori Out and slug them
---
Now that’s asshole material but I don’t have nurses calling :_(
---
Took a fair bit of practice on console. So much harder to adjust quickly after a blink
---
No and no perks
---
Footage coming later
---
The same match where I went full on Thief stealth mode right next to the fucking Nurse in one match (this happened 8 times, and when I say Thief I mean the Thief game with the “rookie thief fucks up and now you gotta rescue her” story)
---
I wish I was kidding when I say she passed a rock, and if she looked a mere PIXEL to her left, not an inch, a PIXEL. I would have been seen essentially face first in her... family jewels let’s say and caught.
---
BRUTAL KILLER
---
The t-bag before realizing he fucked up is the best part. Lmao.
---
I don’t know that making it rare matters. Rolling the dice on the blood-web to see how many guaranteed wins you get isn’t really fun for either side as cool as Moris are. Also I think the mori after you hook a survivor isn’t a waste, that’s one less loop or chase you have to deal with, possibly more if they have good flashlight users.
---
I know the feeling. The game itself is really fun and I love playing Killer so I normally just give the survivors a "gg" in the post chat and then leave the lobby. I'm not interested in sticking around just to get shit on for no reason any more, and I'm not lettng other people make me feel like I threw my money away.
---
That was me get rekt
---
No im joking 😂
---
I still think the requirements for Killer (Absolute peak performance in regards with the emblem system which is often down to luck and is harder the higher rank you are) vs survivor (Literally escape, even if you didn't touch a single gen, heal anyone, cleansed a single totem, and sandbagged everyone else so you could get hatch) should be more similar. 
---
Before you always needed a 4K. Now a 4K isn't enough and getting Merciless isn't easy.
---
You (and a Leatherdaddy daily) reignited my spark to collect faces.
---
First match and a little bitch Jake DCs.

Prob 1100 for all parts.
---
There is no ingame chat on consoles.
---
Anti gen rushing build? Lmao 
---
Once your Ruin is gone you’ve got nothing. Franklins is pointless if they don’t bring in items and if they are actually “gen rushing” they won’t be searching chests for items. Plus Noed doesn’t come into play until all the gens are done anyway so you’ve failed to stop them by that point.
---
Actually , a survivor's job is escaping. He can help others , if it increases his likelihood of escaping, but
---
It was a long time before I realised this, after I brought Leatherface and an ebony to every match with a Squadette.
---
Though, at least I got "Blood on Your Face" for it.
---
I always love to stick around and have some post-game banter and congratulate one or two survivors for absolutely whooping me, but honestly just skipping it might be a good idea. I like to be friendly and have some fun after the game but if most people just want to berate, report and shout insults at you, there's no point in sticking around ig.
---
Ain't that already the same thing though? XD
---
All killers need good perks though, you could probably get by with the most garbage survivor perks by just playing smart and having map knowledge however this isn’t true with the killer.
---
Good strategy get surviver on the hook than hide and wait when surviver get saved down him again and mori him easy way to win
---
If you think 80% of map spots require you to get hit once, then I can't help you lmao

Survivors haven't been "OP" for awhile bud.
---
Honestly that’s why I barely ever go on reddit anymore, and if I do, I never comment. Like ever. Almost every time it’s a a shitty experience but what can you expect when your on an app where people have no consequences to their actions :/
---
Bro I hooked the fourth guy and took a screenie don’t be salty fam
---
Your brave posting NOED survivor mains are going to downvote you to oblivion, whilst they adrenaline away.
---
They already have lol
---
At least Michael is consistent. I know what he is capable of and I know how to counter him. I also find him fun to play as. Michael is one of my favorite colors in the game. Probably top five. Right after nurse spirit and Huntress. I enjoy playing against the more difficult top-tier Killers because they are more complex than Killers like Leatherface or The Wraith.
---
My issue with Ghostface is I can stare him down and he still exposes me. He is incredibly inconsistent and I'm fun to play as. He can get all four players to 99% and it won't Decay despite escaping him or staring him down in revealing him. If you reveal him it should reset his stalking progress on you. Or at least have it decrease gradually like the doctor.
---
 He is basically an M1 killer that is frustrating to play against because of inconsistency and bugs. I mainly play killer and don't enjoy playing as him because a lot of the time when I expose survivors its total bullshit and shouldn't have happened. He's also garbage at higher ranks and an inconsistent mess. I think the legion was originally supposed to be Ghostface but they couldn't get the license and decided the legion would be perfect for making money off of cosmetics.
---
Ghostface isn't weak. He isn't strong. He's frustrating. I think his power should be completely overhauled like Freddy. He shouldn't be nerfed.
---
I am not, i put my name before knowing there is an youtuber with that name
---
Yeeg GF to the right by wraith hes such a good boi even if hes a sadistic serial killer.
---
No, you can't change graphics or sound effects. And you can't opt out from playing against certain killers.
---
Thanks for spawning a good meme. 
---
I really hope that you and others who see it take the lesson forward - people can use whatever perks they want. Either side. That doesn’t justify being an ass to them. 
---
If you really have an issue with a perk (which honestly, there is no single ridiculously OP perk that requires this since the fix of ‘Wake Up’) then make a post about it on the forum and try and draw attention to the Devs with it.
---
Tbh I find ghostface pretty easy to escape from, only problem is the stalking meter doesn’t go down
---
*When Myers is stalking you but instead of the usual tier 3 sound effect it plays bfg division*
---
I assume huntress is wearing just pants, long, fancy man pants to go with her manly upper-clothing, which also has nothing under it.
---
Spirit is just wearing tight wraps that can’t be removed without her noticing the sudden pushing of flesh like a meat hook against her pale ghostly skin pulling apart the cloth (not intended to sound sexual, just slightly tense since if you were to attempt to remove tightly wrapped cloth on a ghost woman with a Katana, she would definitely notice).
---
Nurse is wearing I believe a specific type of clothing given to nurses to avoid the bad stuff in their work getting in their sensitive parts (diseases and infections I mean).
---
Plague is just... don’t even need to explain.
---
Damn now that you say it like that... 😂
---
Ah rip. I don't find him as annoying as others, but this is based on community's general opinions, and a bit of mine.
---
killer is hard to play \* i get bullied \* you just need to be smart LMAO
---
Usually not a grammar nazi but plz survivor not surviver it hurts my brain
---
Bubba is an M1 killer outside of camped hooks situations and being caught out in the middle of nothing. All you need to do is hug a rock and he's countered. Should be much lower.
---
I want a game where I don't have to be frustrated every 2 games because a janitor wrote the spaghetti code
---
That’s because there isn’t a FPS cap on the start screen so it tries to get better FPS and makes your ps4 sound like its about to take off to another country
---
After you get down the basics of the killers, watch monto for some good/crazy builds. He has a LOT of builds as hes been pumping out 1 a day for as long as I have played the game.
---
They don’t provide a reason because there is none. Other than they’ll claim you only got them because of the perk, and that’s ‘cheap’. 
---
I always clarify that i’m not using a particularly great Killer (I run it on Trapper, Wraith and Freddy) and i’ve been playing the game with 3 perks. They also had ample time to deactivate the perk before the gens were completed, or even afterwards. 
---
Still expect the salt and abuse though, players like that can’t ever recognise their  own mistakes and learn from them.
---
Why is it so funny to see dwight like that
---
Tick Tock Dwighty TICK TOCK!!!
---
Awesome!
---
Nice
---
join us, join us in oink
---
I would say that they are much less annoying after the changes. Could really get a little bit more to the right now.
---
In my first game I just dropped pallets without the killer in sight, I thought it would save time for an actual chase. Bit later I realised what an idiot I was lol
---
BART! I don’t want to alarm you but
---
*kaching*
---
**WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMP**
---
I'd put Hillbilly all the way left. Most annoying killer if that's all you face 8 matches in a row with 3 of the same perks.
---
Everyone gucci until Nea starts blinking
---
This is one of the best formats I've seen.
---
&gt; It's not hard to pip as survivor?
---
But not everyone is supposed to be able to pip 'til rank 1.
---
It's not a reward to play a lot, it's to help the matchmaking building balanced teams.
---
Hey gotta check your phone while doing gens.
---
Holy hell you put some effort in yet not alot of upvotes feelsbadman
---
I find everybody leaves the gen to go find Ruin. Like when a match starts, and 4 of us start a gen, we all realize Ruin exists, literally EVERYBODY runs off to find it, meanwhile I'm left actually doing the gen.
---
Bad as in they suck. If I can hook all 4 survivors with 5 gens done THAT should totally pop my Adept Achievements. However all that means is that I was too good and I didn't give any survivors play time. Thus I get a Ruthless and not a Merciless.
---
I’m on ps4 and it activates as soon as I hit my sprint button might be just a big for you
---
I stay on the gen after I quickly scout the area around the gen for totems spawns if I don't find Ruin. I only get off the gen if the killer forces me off or a finish it. When I finish it I go to another gen. 
---
I only keep an eye out finding it, but I do not actively search for it. 9/10 I waste too much time and my teammates find it or suicide themselves failing for it, making us lose.
---
*All I needed, Wraith getting a beat down from Dwight*
---
I think I have decided on the pig I find playing her pretty fun. And the pig cult on here is hilarious at least i think so.
---
Why is no one talking about the hag?
---
Spirit is very high tier and has a high skill cap. Spirit isn't add-on reliant and can do great without anything also has fantastic perks. Pig has alot of variety and builds she can do also has a pretty decent skill cap but she isn't the best she also has nice perks. I would recommend spirit more but pig is a great choice also.
---
So Trapper is perfectly balanced, as all killers should be (Looking at you, Nurse)
---
How tf the nurse be eating food with her thing on?
---
Did you end up reporting him for working with a survivor ?
---
Shut the fuck up you butthurt cock monkey bitch. He just made a joke bitch now calm your pepperoni nipples.
---
No, there’s not really a point on console.
---
You noticed the work I did, and that's enough for me
---
:)
---
Hmm they don’t really care about console players it’s stupid
---
no
---
And just a few days ago mcLean was on stream saying he doesn’t think the community is toxic...
---
Jake gets hit: HEX TOTEM EXPLOSION
---
But why nazi lmfao do you like nazi and hitler 😂
---
Im a retard translator. He said, “I THINK WE DID A PRETTY GOOD JOB WITH THE GATE”
---
r/dadbydaylight even?
---
Maybe they should change requirements for achievement. But they definitely shouldn't change emblems so that 4k at 5 gens will be Merciless no matter what.
---
All from the comfort of his Delta.
---
Yeah ngl, we already have a dude who did that.   
---
His name's Ghostface
---
Ace is god
---
Possibly because killers can pretty effectively get blood points WITHOUT working with a survivor?  Killers getting a lot of blood points is a pretty shitty indicator of collusion/cheating.
---
No it's not just you, many people feel that way. This is based on the community's opinion, and a little bit of mine. 😀
---
Wouldn't Billy be better for her.
---
Just being able to run.
---
OLD HUNTRESS HATCHET SOUND IS BACK BBYYY
---
That's actually how every nurse got that achievement
---
Iron will will do about 80% of the work for you.  Burning her mind games is the rest.
---
"Play how you want to play", and then right in the next sentence - "do whatever it takes to win". Yeah, no pressure.
---
Too bad you handled it so poorly
---
I was actually so happy at this I was bursting with joy to see this fucking bitch get mowed
---
If you hold sprint while crouched then let go of crouch then you will not use sprint burst. Even if it’s fro a second that’s just how the bug is rn so that’s probably why it didn’t work
---
Laurie should be Myers.
---
Just so she can finally haunt Myers and perform his mori on him.
---
New players - killer has an advantage, seasoned players, Survivors have the advantage.  Simple as that. And by seasoned I mean semi-competant with experience.  There are a *few* Survivors with lots of hours who don't actually understand the game.
---
Great.. I'm not the only one
---
When the banter backfires lol
---
Thats fair.
---
I still hate 500 shocks, it's unreasonable. A lot of trophies are unreasonable, the 3 blink yoink, 100 hatchet downs from 24 meters away, Adept David (No Mither) 4 Man Hatch Escape, and other trophies
---
Mad cus bad
---
Out of curiosity, do you self care against legion? Also, do you cleanse against plague?
---
Yeah great, dedicated servers when Australian players HAVE to play on Singapore servers and this becomes every match, rather than an exception when one person has poor ping.
---
Claudette is the better ghost face
---

---
Can somebody please recreate this?
---
Why did we need this to be presented in 90s xfiles quality?  The right hand picture, I can get, the lefthand looks like a bowl of potato soup.
---
Trapper: "OMG Nea is coming! Get out and save yourselves!"
---
XD
---
Of course they have to. How else are they going to fit in lockers?
---
Nope, nurse is still best, unless you're on a console.
---
Add ons that are good are things like quicker uncloak faster movement speed while cloaked or quicker cloak for normal builds at least 
---
Good perks are spirit fury, enduring combo 
---
Hex ruin because it’s the only perk in the game that can slow the game down enough 
---
If you run movement speed add ons then bbq and chilli is a good choice if not then nurses calling is good because he has no terror radius when cloaked. 
---
As for meme builds you have complete silent build which is the silent bell ultra rare and “the ghost” soot. With probably the same perks 
---
Or you could run silent bell and all seeing to sneak up on survivors when you can see them then you wouldn’t need nurses calling so you could put on brutal strength or even NOED if you aren’t confident
---
OP ignore him. You did well and deserve those points.
---
What if you’re on a gen and it’s a dead zone? The killer doesn’t have anyone on hook and is patrolling
---
Sometimes as a killer, you have to respect the self sacrifice.
---
Go on any DBD stream and ask the streamer about self care and why they don't alwas run it.
---
They will **always** say "Why heal when you can just do gens"
---
Health states aren't NECESSARY to loop the killer for a long time- hell I can't count the amount of times I've opened a gate, saved someone from hook, took killer aggro and made it out, all while injured.
---
Because these health states aren't necessary in almost all cases, why bother healing. Run dead hard if you need that little *extra* to get you to the safe tiles/ exits. Run DS/ Deliverance/ Unbreakable if you find yourself getting downed and shit out of luck
---
Survivor used Game offering. I'm like "Ok, not a bad map for Amanda". We load in, 3 seconds later a DC. Oh well, another dull game. Found survivor, second DC on a down. Turn around, there's another one... and DC. I hear a hatch right below me, close it right as the gen is done. See the Ace who doesn't run away... Guided him to the gate. 
---
Extremely fun 3 minutes. With long queues that's exactly the gameplay I'm looking for.
---
If they run into them they disappear. If they turn yellow on your screen it means they are close to them.
---
Doesn’t stop people from sending you messages directly
---
I thought you still could but i failed. Thats lame
---
Psyduck for doc is the best decision ever made by man.
---
The builds fine but can I ask are you playing as Claudette
---
I got adept David first try
---
*when you’ve had enough of hearing that fucking bell*
---
Killer: looks at survivor from across the map
---
Rank 20 survivor: throws down pallet
---
You can absolutely report them for "kill yourself" and hate speech.  You should do so with the endgame report option.  You can also report them on the support website if you have pics.
---
I mean, I didn't report it
---
The message literally says auto-moderator, I'm welcome to hear you out but understand that if I seem condescending towards you it's because by proxxy I'm pissed at all the people I get in my game urban evading and self caring in the corners of maps, after having experienced the luxury of god tier teammates several times
---
That already happens if you play killer
---
You could (I think it's fixed now?) lose all your progress (like every character is back to level 1), and devs would give you a lot of BPs (based on hours played and some other stats), so you could have way more than 1m.
---
fix noed? Cleanse totems / just remember all the dull totem spawns  
---
fix ruin? don't even look for it, git gud and hit the great skillchecks
---
Dead by Buglight
---
Previous to these messages he spammed 4 or 5 party invites, to which I message him that I don’t have a mic, and the rest is in the photo.
---
Either that or HybridPanda was playing before the bloodpoint cap was added.
---
According to them, the cap makes it easier to flag people who cheat massive amounts of bloodpoints into their accounts. 
---
They either go through the trouble of cheating 1m in, spending and cheating in again or cheat all at once and get easily flagged.
---
Yeah , why ?
---
Using perks to kill quicker vs using perks to not die so quick. Very different leagues. Genius observation.
---
Just wanted to know if I guessed right from the perks
---
«When you dead hard, but get downed through it», IT DOESNT ACTUALLY GIVE ENDURANCE TO TAKE A HIT DURING IT REEE
---
Imagine running NOED on Ghostface with a mori and being this toxic...
---
&gt;Ok. I saw a video from a while ago where HybridPanda had 13M.
---
It isn't so uncommon to see players with over 10m. They usually lost progress at some point and BHVR reimburses them like that.
---
Pretty dandy! I like it a lot, coming from someone who enjoys drawing as well.
---
Then it was pretty weak banter, not going to lie.
---
When was that? I started playing in September 2017 and cap was already there... Must be a very old video
---
But there should never be a time when you're in that situation. If you notice you're in a dead zone or that resources around you are used, move to somewhere safe. Wasting time self caring so you can sit somewhere you know is unsafe and immediately burn that health state when you're found is just giving the killer so much free reign.
---
I mean, I only ever see people healing (without medkits) in games that are deemed lost (low gen progress, people dead, unlikely gates will open)
---
It's not *that* crucial. Dead hard kind of acts as that chase extender if you need just that *tiny* bit. Like I'd rather give a gen 75% progress and be downed than have an extra health state in 90% of chases.
---
Ashy Slashy, hatchet and saw, takes your head and skins you raw. 
---
Ashy Slashy, Heaven or Hell, cuts out your tongue so you can’t yell.
---
Memes aside, pig is probably the strongest option out of those.
---
Her crouch gives her mind game potential and the traps put up a good amount of pressure. She also has fun addons like her letter, which are strong but not completly breaking the game.
---
I consider huntress my main, but her iridescent heads just break the game and either end the game super fast or make people DC on the spot :(
---
He was died, so yes, it was a corpse
---
Generator gets completed: Myers pallet stun noise
---
There's still the advice on loading screen: "The Entity is amused by hatch catches."
---
GOOD JOB SO FAR
---
**TTTTTHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH**icc
---
Imagine not understanding that I'm trying to be as toxic as possible.
---
The secret to dealing with trolls is not getting triggered and answering with insults or arguing. You're just giving them what they want with those answers. It sucks that people like that exist but it's not worth getting agitated over it.
---
*click* yep that's going in the cringe compilation.
---
I absolutely agree. 
---
If I get ‘gen rushed’ it’s because I went against a group of good survivors and didn’t apply an ample amount of pressure to stop them from doing so. It’s something I take forward into the next game in order to improve. 
---
Sometimes I’m playing a ‘meh’ Killer against an organised team/SWF. I’m not expecting to win as you can’t win every game. Just as sometimes i’m playing solo survivor with a bunch of donuts. Sometimes the deck is stacked against you and you just need to suck it up and move on. 
---
But players from both sides cause this inane toxic rift, and it really can dampen a fun match when they slam their head into they keyboard after the match ends.
---
You can say Ghostface is still bugged all you want but I dont got issues revealing him anymore since his changes and hes a delight to go against.
---
Yeah i know what you mean
---
Excuse me? How is Hag that low?
---
Yes, because the perks sucks compared to the addons and offering
---
Hag needs to be higher, Bubba and Trapper lower and playing against 20 Instasaw Billies in a row is far from wholesome.
---
You’re not allowed to blow up when the killer is teaming with someone?
---
Not really though?
---
So trapper is both high and low tier? xD nice draw.
---
Of course Hypno is Freddy.
---
I've never said that.
---
On pc tho she can be average and win by just building 3 blinks or Long range blinks
---
Because they removed it
---
Kinda
---
That’s the point of the post
---
Gotta get BBQ stacks
---
Dwight: I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF YOUR SHIT
---
Wraith: NO NO, PLEASE IT'S JUST A PRANK BRO, IT'S JUST A PRANK
---
It's really funny to me how all of the survivors who complain about NOED are running adrenaline...
---
I hear a lot of "Play how you want, run NOED." Then bitch on the forums how DS, Dead Hard and Insta Heals are ruining the fun for killers. \*laughs in Syringe\*
---
Pretty much just like Hag’s traps, they’re meant to be jump scares to make survivors panic, they don’t move
---
I mean I’d consider the birthday/anniversary decorations going on now pretty humorous given confetti comes out when you hook someone
---
You can get killer games?
---
7 minute queue here to get one game. 
---
I tHiNk wE DiD a PrEtTy GoOd JoB
---
So killers get barbecue which shows auras and gives bonus bloodpoints, but survivors shouldn't have a perk that does something and give bonus points? I get what youre saying about gen rushing though but i think they need to fix that issue some other way.
---
I often feel unstoppable as Pig ( wich is my main forever ) but oh boy. That dude. A swf spawned and i didn't imagined that fucking pizza delivering Dwight would loop me the fuck around the killer shack while all gens are being pop by these damn Feng min, then all gather to the exit gates and start teabagging so i have to go hit each one of theme until they crawl past it... Fucking damn, even tho i know what awaits me at rank 1... Damn these toxic plebs
---
Broken, unfair, overpowered. :)
---
Probably a 3. Spies is not really that good, those birds make a hell of sound without it as well. Iron grasp i don't see the point unless you wanna carry them to the basement.
---
Thanatophobia as well. People heal against the nurse more than anything, and even if all 4 are injured it's still weak.
---
I'd go with BBQ and whispers. For the last perk you gotta know if you need more tracking (then maybe stridor since people like to stealth around against nurses, or iron maiden to counter lockers woth BBQ)
---
Or you don't need tracking than you can't go wrong with devour hope, or mayve haunted grounds
---
This is genius
---
Yeah,what the hell, my past 7 games, either I spawned,or some survivor spawned within a 10m radius of ruin
---
Maybe for : "Badaxe = Badass" Idk
---
I think its that
---
People who say spirit is better than nurse usually main nurse and can't accept that they are playing an unfair killer.
---
Spirit doesn't just casually blink through the entire map in 3 seconds, and doesn't ignore every mechanic in the game, while nurse does.
---
there are hex totems and dull totems -- if it has an orange aura around it, it's a hex totem and it is attached to some kind of perk to the killer. cleansing that hex totem will disable the perk. dull totems aren't linked to any active perks -- but it can be the case that when the exit gates open one of the dull totems turns into NOED if it hasn't been cleansed and if that is one of the killer's perks, so there is still benefit to cleansing it.
---
I agree, it just sucks to have a game completely turn around because of NOED. I didn't mind NOED before, but it got a buff it really didn't need. Same with ruin. They are the strongest perks in game and they got a buff. That is just really annoying because it's used it more games than not and just becomes boring. Survivor perks that are strong always get nerfs. I understand how annoying it is to get D-striked every match and outrun by SB so those nerfs were needed. I just don't understand why strong perks on one side get nerfed and on the other side they get buffed. Still no need to flame the other side for the devs decision.
---
Iron grasp is not useful 'cause there is a lot of hook on the maps.
---
Except if you absolutely want to basement your survivors you could replace this by BBQ
---
6/10
---
Oh god, that Dwight betting the crap out of Wraith.
---
It seems BHVR in PS4 doesn’t care about report, and not punish cheaters.
---
That's probably because if you lose progress, the devs will compensate you with bloodpoints that exceeds the cap
---
You are not alone

OP as fuck.
---
Hm, okay. I get that. I Hate playing as or against Freddy. The only thing I dislike when playing against Legion is his dirty stank breath heavily breathing behind me while he chases me, it creeps me out. Otherwise he’s been really fun to play as, I just hit people once during FF and then I   Gotta Blast the fuck out of there and hit another survivor. I also really enjoying being able to vault over pallets/windows.
---
Juicy
---
how do you even record your video like that? Sorry for not watching that, I won't break my neck for the cause
---
or change the sound effects
---
Not by far, the time it takes to learn equal to the rewards,are by far not balanced
---
you haven't faced good survivors yet. rank up
---
As a survivor, it's usually exciting since I suck and get scared easily. And since I struggle with survivor dailies, it stays interesting, in a horrible, brutal sort of way.
---
Now as killer, I'm a killer main. 
---
Sometimes I play with my food. For example, Huntress still has the mind of a child, so I imagine her wanting some doll or something. So I find a survivor, catch em, pick em up, and just keep it that way lol, no hooking. If they wiggle, I beat the survivor into submission. If they don't struggle, I just walk around with the survivor on my shoulder, chilling with the other survivors. Then there's the body block in a small room and once you have the survivor trapped, you can do that Dodge-The-Hatchet minigame. If they make it out, you let them go. And that's just one killer.
---
"You dare challenge my sprint?"
---
swear you see them urban evading around the entire map every game
---
when you're *iron grasp* you **better** not have any other perks.
---
Yes P3 rank 5 Micheal With almost every teachable expect legion and ghostface, what's your point?
---
You can report players, but the chances of it doing anything are slim to none.
---
I'd say freddy
---
Eugh
---
Fair enough that sucks
---
Are you European? If you are we are in the same timezone, and then I can show you how I play :D
---
Why don't  we as a community promote a positive gamer instead of a toxic one. If we want it then it will happen.
---
Benny wait, I thought we had something special :( cant believe I had to catch you on reddit.
---
Okay apparently I'm not allowed to make a joke about matching with a rank 4 without people having a go at me for it being "not that bad." I know it's not that bad, it's a shitpost.
---
Nada, I'm American, Pacific Standard Time
---
To add to the locker point, if you slowly enter a locker and the killer was close enough to hear the soft grunt they make when opening the locker, they'll likely check lockers in the area.
---
The message Im getting from these comments is that you shouldn't flame players who use NOED (etc) *because they have nothing else*. Wrong. You shouldn't flame. ever. ESPECIALLY if they use something that is a large aspect of the game, like a mori or perk. why would someone play at a disadvantage? NOED is a great perk, and loads of fun to use. There is nothing wrong with using it at all.
---
I don't mind survivors are just as toxic
---
Ah. Well in five hours I might stream some lol
---
You probably be asleep by then
---
He doesn’t feel weak when I play as him but I also never got to play as him pre-rework so I don’t really know what it was like. Mending is definitely annoying as a survivor but most Legions ditch you after landing a hit anyways. I personally enjoy chasing survivors and I feel like with Legion I can do that more efficiently, don’t get me wrong though I still get bamboozled by survivors. Last game I played those hoes pallet stunned me like 4 times :/
---
Yeah that's a bruh moment from me chief
---
It's a personal preference, but I'm 100% sure that if I'd see what perks he has on Billy, my build would be different.
---
Finally someone gets it. I only did this once too. But still people are getting upset saying I'm an asshole for doing what survivors do all the time to me. Yet I don't complain to them about it because I'm not a bitch XD
---
Hag is way higher than this on the tier list since her buff, id even argue she is better than huntress since she is way less map dependent
---
Micheal tires?
---
By buff you mean OHKO on level one perk?
---
Or do you mean buff by making it hex?
---
Because making it a hex was a rebalancing - 'gen rush' means zero totems cleaned and NOED secures the last kill(-s)
---
If survivors focus totems, No NOED and you, as a killer, have more time for a pressure.
---
Either way I can't see a buff but a rebalancing.
---
True words
---
Top image: Average rank 8. Killer rank = 10
---
Bottom image: Average rank 17.5. Killer rank = 16
---
Pretty good matchmaking for killer/survivor. 
---
I don't think I've been matched (in recent memory) with people with a wildly different rank as survivor (like in the first image) unless you're queuing with a low rank survivor by choice. Matchmaking used to be FUBAR. It's pretty good now.
---
probably feels bad
---
Amen to that.
---
Yes. Please. I want david
---
check out my next post gonna post a ghostdace game no commentary if you want to check it out
---
Pls Daddy...
---
Sibling revenge at its finest
---
Because your main comment was a meme. The comment that was downvoted wasn't and you were dead serious about it. You said bullshit so people downvoted your bullshit.
---
Sure thing!
---
haha all g, something stuffed up my editing when i cut the video, my bad
---
Well they just happen to not really be able to put it into words. Imagine this: You and your friend play really well, have some close escapes, you are chased by the Killer and get downed right before the gates open up. You ran the killer for 3 gens because he does not realize that you should not give up gen pressure too much for tunneling one person. 
---
Your friend comes to save you with Borrowed Time, while the Killer literally facecamps you for playing well. You have decisive strike to escape together with your friend and adrenaline to get the win you fought for. Your friend goes for the save: gets seen last moment and instadowned: NOED. Now he camps you and your friend with Noed until you die on hook. All your good play goes for nothing because Noed is there to reward a killer for not playing well. Situation like these make the game really unenjoyable, especially if the Killer feels like he accomplished something doing this. Oh and the other 2 randoms? Don’t bother and just leave because no one comes to save you when Noed is active.
---
&gt; ...hair stands up...
---
Even if that were true (it's not, btw.  You're gonna get OP killed.), there are cosmetics that make her hair behave normally, rendering this pointless.
---
&gt; ...power has to be fully charged...done a really long phase
---
This is true but beware some Spirits (like myself) stack +recharge addons.  I've caught many a survivor with their pants down at pallets because they "know how spirit works".
---
Yeah and he puts GF almost as high as spirit
---
But I have over 2k hours and still run NOED on Billy. The salt when I get kills because of it is well worth being down a perk the entire match.
---
Ah, not you then. I was playing Billy, went for the shack gen, found Claudette there. She proceeded to jump right into the basement, which had me freeze for a few seconds, she realised her mistake, got out of the basement and then jumped right back in for whatever reason. Then I chainsawed her and hooked her in the basement
---
Trapper without add-ons, Ruin and NOED is by far. Maybe not against rank 20s, but against even green ranks, it's almost impossible to win with him in that way.
---
right now for me its "HONESTLY THIS IS IT"
---
Good I wish that were me
---
you mean down?
---
I mean you don't *need* a 4k to earn a ton of points, but slug the second last survivor and hunt down/bait the last one is how i typically go about getting 4ks. Just be wary of people who can self-heal and don't ignore generators.
---
I have had a similar experience. I used to post and reply a lot but I found their are people who seem to just look for something to disagree on or be an A hole about. I got fed up of having defend myself and the cherry on the cake was someone wishing my family would die in a car accident, the mods did take care of him thankfully. Now I only occasionally reply and usually only to people who are new with questions. I won't go near balance debates lol.
---
How is Hag low tier?
---
Is that bill behind those fists?
---
OK, that annoys the piss out of me.
---
The fuck is "latinx"?  It's LatinO or LatinA.  I'll bet that Latinx is something the SJWs made up.  Actual Spanish speakers would probably have difficulty pronouncing that.
---
That's what I want to know.
---
Freddy is there too
---
I've seen people with spine chill time and time again panic and end up running towards the killer because they don't know the direction, prem with lightweight makes you near impossible to catch.
---
Why not finished a sabo hook sound?
---
Downvoted for speaking what we all are thinking.  Your sacrifice will not be in vain!
---
Here are a few tipps.
---
Try to when going in a regular loop without a high wall or window  walk backwards and change the loop direction. Most of the time this short moment can break the loop earlier cause the survivors isnt able to use the loop for more then 1 time if they didnt react fast enough. Also never respect pallets. Sometimes survivor just wont drop the pallet or they do it to late. Trust me you will always gain more hits when not respecting pallets. Try always to lounge attack for a better range. (If not chainsaw on billy) try to remember wat exhaustion perk the survivors use. Most of the survivors are going for dead hard. When you know they got deadhard its pretty much useless for them. Just dont hit to early. Also dont use your chainsaw instandly when you can. Most of the People on higher ranks will make some sharp left or right moves to avoid it. Take 1 or 2 more sec to make yoir hit secure. On loops with walls you should hide your red stain. Moonwalk along walls to fake the direction you going. Remember where you broke pallets and where the windows at. You always should try to lead a survivor in a direction where you broke all pallets or they got only bad loops. When a survivor is standing by a pallet always go in for a lounge attack. Act like you would go around for a short mom. And go in for a hit. Many survivors miss their timing here and get hit. On highwalls you can also hide your red stain to use this moment. You prob should watch some regular loopingtipps on youtube to learn. Some tipps are basic but every killer works differnt. With billy you can just eat every pallet, with the nurse you just teleport . With spirit u can use dropped pallets for mindgames. And with the hag you dont even actually chase. Try to figure out the best way on your own.
---
Played the game just fine an hour ago, now I'm getting errors
---
3/10. Sorry man, but A Nurse's Calling is the only useful perk you have. Spies From The Shadows was nerfed after was buffed and now it's very situational. You have much better tracking perks, like Barbecue and Chilli, Infectious Fright, even I'm All Ears. Thanatophobia is just useless on anything that isn't Legion or Plague and even on them it isn't too great. There are much better stall perks like Ruin, Sloppy Butcher or Pop Goes the Weasel. Iron Grasp is just useless. It's completely outclassed by Agitation. 
---
And I don't like your add-ons. If you use constantly add-ons for 3 blinks, then you are probably not a good Nurse.
---
Blood Warden OP, pliz nerf ASAP
---
But then the survivor needs to be bigger, getting chased by a giant claudette sounds terrifying!
---
r/wooosh
---
Perks need to work with every killer, so Cursed Prayer has to be redesigned.
---
"Healing Ruin" with 2 totems? Why? Also, how will it work with 4 hex perks builds where 2 of them are double totems ones?
---
Power won't work in a multiplayer PvP game. No one will have fun losing control over their character.
---
Oh, now i see wow
---
Lol so true. Those survivor mains get triggered. 😂
---
Well how about this. I hate both Survivor Mains and Killer Mains.
---
Because they don’t have an equally good opinion most the time and usually it’s to benefit them more then actually help the game out. 
---
So I’m on both sides of the spectrum.
---
A ghostface with city cloak and default mask making him look similar to OG ghostface..
---
OP is a man of culture
---
The level of groupthink in this sub is scary tbh
---
Why not just cleanse the totems. Its even easier if your playing SWF as you can keep count of how many are destroyed.   
---
Also in your scenario its endgame so the killer camping the person they downed when the other 3 are still alive makes sense. I never get people being mad at a killer camping their last hook when if they left it would be a 4k escape and a total loss.   
---
IMO in your scenario the only people to be mad at are the 2 who just bounced instead of looking for NOED at least. However I remember the first few months of playing NOED scared the crap out of me so I can sympathise at least.
---
Amen! Been thinking about this for a while. I love the "I main survivor but..." or "I main killer but..."
---
Gg no reeee
---
I had a survivor go through the trouble of messaging me through PS4 chat after a game just to tell me that was camping and try to explain why I shouldn’t do that as if I had just bought the game or something.
---
I asked him how the view from the hook was lmao
---
The thing about totems is that doing any totems you find will inadvertedly dick you, cause the NOED totem will be hidden on that 4th or 5th totem you could never spot. Might work if you're coordinating with SWF, but you can't tell when a teammate cleansed a totem.
---
The "just cleanse totems" advice doesn't function in a game design sense anyway- people who know what they're doing will simply keep track of them, but that doesn't stop solo queue teammates from dicking everyone over by doing the thing that was meant to slow gen rush.
---
Then add to the fact that people at X rank should finish matches before 5 gens pop, at minimum 50% of the time. Hatch escape or 4k is what average killers should be seeing, cause an odd number like 2 or 3 escaping typically means something newbie was involved. (NOED, tunnelling, camping)
---
So when you play killer, why would you run a perk that has a chance at proc'ing &lt;50% of the time, in a total failstate, with the potential of being cleansed? "For kills" seems like it'd be the answer, but it's kind of a cheap out. Hook the survivor next to your totem, you earned yourself a free kill for being bad, more if the survivors decide to try and engage you in any interesting interactions and squeeze a bit of fun out of the match.
---
You could consider it strong based on the sense killers get *kills* with it, but killcount doesn't *really* matter. As killer you should be finding survivors, winning chases, having map control, know where to apply pressure. You can fail all of those, NOED throws you a bone and goes "here's a freebie for your trouble"
---
You never actually earned it. I don't say that as a salty survivor main- I say that as someone who mains killer and has been constantly trying to improve at the game and its mechanics. Still failing dramatically now and again when I mindgame myself or lose survivors to corn, but I find that being able to win chases faster than the rate survivors can recover at is more "fun" than simply getting the kill. Cause I can facecamp 1 survivor during the match, then facecamp another next to my NOED totem, and "Wrack up them kills"- especially if their teammates try to be altruistic. But I don't find it fun, and the survivors DEFINITELY don't either. No one earns any points, no one engages in anything interest. Snore.
---
"You've yee'd your last haw." -Asshole Jake
---
Well its another perspective though if you have played Killer yourself and know you can play without NOED for way better results as if you used a perk slot for it. Then mind that cleansing all dull totems without a map is extremely Time consuming in fact. So much that you are likely to lose the game in the time you cleanse totems for a noed you do not even know is there. In that time you could do 2 gens and escape early with everyone alive instead of being the last guy standing because you used the valuable time chasing dull totems. And you cannot hand it to the randoms for dipping. If noed lights up in a very hidden corner or right next to the hook he is camping its suicide. You are unable to do anything. Also the speed increase of Noed makes luring him suicide too.
---
LOL THIS. gens are so boring anyway sometimes I'll miss a skill check just to try and get some action.
---
Nah, Claudette is for the noob players, really skilled players mostly playing : Dwight, Nea or Kate tbh.
---
Noobs are playing Claudette cause u can’t see her so easy to make it possible for this players to play a game and she can instantly self heal, which u need to unlock first for the other ;).

---
Had that happen a ton before 2.5.
---
Sometimes if you come back and then leave again it'll fix itself. Otherwise yeah you die now :c
---
In my experience, it depends on how many survivor rules you follow. Like not playing nurse, not bringing any add ons over uncommon quality, not using perks they don't like... etc.
---
See I don't think that cleansing means its an L. I play mainly solo survivor and I often cleanse a totem and often we get out. Maybe I might have more games where it isn't a 4k escape but I also have less games getting mad at killers for NOED. Also even if we do smash gens that normally doesn't stop someone at least dying because they made a bad play. 
---
If the killer is camping why would you just escape. You can run the whole map and the killer won't know so you can look for NOED. I often stay in and find NOED to go make a save. Part of NOED's power is that people fear it when it pops but its pretty easy to get rid of and their are very very few totem spawns that are actually really hidden.
---
IDGAF as long as you chase the person who comes. Playing against killers who literally chase for 5 seconds and then be like 'uuuuh I can't go more than 20 metres away from the hook' are the worst.
---
We should just leave he hooked person to die and then everyone else gets out easy but FOOK THAT, it's soo boring, who wants to win like that anyway? 
---
Personally I am anti-toxic, nothing beats giving the surv's every opp to get out and still destroying them. But I guess most people don't like a challenge. Or are just bad? Like killer is hard xD
---
I disagree (Prestige 3 Claudette btw). You should not always hit through pallets unless you have spirit fury, enduring and/or brutal strength. Missing the hit and still getting stunned wasted more time than predicting the survivor will throw it down and having to break it. While in chases see if the survivor loops the same jungle gym a ton, if they do they are most likely going for the stun. If they run between jungle gyms, mostly likely they will throw the pallet down early.
---
That’s probably why, Tunneling is one thing but being able to win most chases or close a gap is just annoying to play against
---
I love Psydoc so much
---
&gt; they worked for the bloodpoints to use it
---
That is one really weird argument to use
---
For gods sake, just enjoy the content and move on.
---
Entity: helps survivors by creating pallets
---
Killers: you weren't suposed to do that
---
As long as you're having fun playing screw um, salty kids are always gonna be salty, it's in their angst. Just try to have fun.
---
I cant get over this ❤
---
Also if you are close to a pallet, you should never lunge. Sometimes a quick slash will register before the pallet drop. Lunging only guarantees you a pallet stun. If you're running enduring, great. Quick slashes also are better against good 360 survivors.
---
For all these people saying Freddy are bandwagoning. Freddy is viable from rank 20-16 because no one knows how to counter him. For all the other ranks I’d say cannibal.
---
That Nea looks pretty weird
---
Thanks for the tip. I just feel like I miss too often and get salty lol.
---
Not exactly top tier stuff. His power reveals auras and adds blindness. Blindness is an incredibly weak debuff and revealing auras is nowhere near strong enough to be a power. He has nothing that assists him in a chase, nothing to prevent his power being consumed survivors looking at each other on the opposite end of the map, and nothing that makes survivors do anything except sit on gens if they aren't in a chase.
---
First perk, again, uses blindness which is weak. Second perk uses his power, perks are universal and go on any killer so can't be based on his power. "Despair" is incredibly convoluted in what adds and removes it, and it is a debuff from a perk, it shouldn't be something which affects the entire match until people escape. It also would build to max just by being chased once from fast vaults and pallets.
---
This is true. I just got salty after a game where I couldn't hit the survivors to save my life lol.
---
No problem. This tip works with any killer, just wait for them to 360 or dead hard and then you get an easy free hit.
---
Holy shit that would be great lmao
---
Of course it’s not the best but it’s one of the better options for hillbilly
---
&gt; killers arent supposed to slug
---
Says who? Show me where the devs, ingame tutorial, or manual says killers are not supposed to slug please.
---
The best dlc character gameplay-wise is probably spirit, but if you want good perks like bbq or ruin go with leather face or hag
---
Congratulations? You can be whatever you like but it doesn't make your logic any less flawed.
---
&gt; noed is just that good
---
Noed is dogshit- it procs when you lose

Why is 2 people wasting 10 seconds healing better than 1 taking 20?

Ghost face : i‘m joke to you

---
Additionally Notes/ Changes- “Despair” Will now be applied to the Character whose token you’ve consumed.
---
True, couldn't have said better myself.
---
On a side note - how good is Spirit Fury? Unfortunately, I had to leave the game before trying it out.
---
My old M1 killer build was: BBQ, enduring, BS (before the nerf(?) of it) and PWYF/Unrelenting (mind you it was Wraith and it was absolutely destroying SWF at R1 back in the days, near the machine-gun meta).
---
noed lmao
---
Man , it depends because evryone is diffrent so they play better some killers and gets TB on others. But you shouldn't buy Freddy ,Ghostface , Clown nor Plag but your choice . Hope I helped .
---
noed is for shit tier killer and noobs
---
How is pharmacy better than self care?
---
What's also a little bit missing is that they are highly american-culture focused with representation. Especially with killers. And the few exceptions seem to be "exotic" choices. Even characters like Nea for example who is Scandinavian emigrated/grew up in the US e.g.
---
Dealing with SWF can be a challenge, the problem is when you start facing bad players than the buff makes survivors have an even worse time.
---
What have you done to my bing bong boi?!

---

---
If you don't have coxcombed, bone Clapper works almost just as well
---
My main upset with the new scoring system is I loop the killer, stack 8k boldness, die on first or second hook and depip. :\
---
I'm fine with not gaining any rank/ points for being a gen monkey and leaving tbh. I just hate how they emphasize altruism, because so often you get killers who don't give you an opportunity for altruism.
---
Scary good killers on the other hand, like legit down hook, down hook, down hook- with no tunnelling or anything, even on a 4k everyone leaves with like 20k points.
---
I know it sounds bad and everything but I am just a surv main who tries to help \_(××)_/
---
You realize it takes almost no skill to get to rank 1 right? You just have to know how basic mindgames and how to loop decently well
---
This reddit is still just as toxic, just saying.
---
Happened to me one time only it got closed on me as clown clown has so many glitches like the one that when you finish a bloodweb rank you have to switch characters to progress
---
First game I played with her :D
---
Bless, I try to do right by the artists.
---
You literally have to do all gens and survive till the end of the god damn game for it to activate. It rewards you for doing the objective. How is it toxic?
---
I'd switch self care for kindred or
---
Wait, like 100k just for the SWF? They would never implement that
---
Sony don't really do refunds for that sort of stuff.
---
You don't understand! This game is about having *fun*, if the survivors are not having *fun* then you're being a mean bad toxic trash killer, the survivors *fun* is the only thing that matters baby killer ggez.
---
&gt; That's why the focus is on SWF 
---
SWF doesn't automatically means better players. What about 4 friends that bought DbD on summer sale to play together? They are all rank 20 with a single perk each... And you get buff vs them. Sounds fair?
---
people are still angry about noed? my god, a perk that is only useful at the end of the game and can be completely stopped, what a heinous creation devised by evil creatures!
---
1. Survivors got flamed plenty for DS 
---
2. Implying those 2 perks are anywhere near as game changing as NOED
---
Nurse on console
---
Exactly what you should be doing. 
---
Maybe improve on not running into tractors???  Just kidding ^_^
---
Wait so where did the flashlight blind come from though? That jane didn't appear to be facing you, and I didn't notice anyone else there.
---
For sure. Thats the problem with this type of game where a player is the host. But with the server this problem will be fixed.
---
3/10
---
What’d you ask?
---
Yea watchin this video
---
Made me think about the many-faced god from GOT, would love to see the killer disguise in some way as a survivor. I don't know enough about the game in its current state to comment on balance, I imagine it being very complicated. 
---
\- Once a survivor has been hooked, you get a "token" allowing "use" of their body for a certain period of time.
---
\- OR *while* a survivor is hooked, you have free reign as that survivor.
---
thanks :)
---
I t-bag sometimes and I'm honestly not trying to show off or anything I'm just trying to keep the killers attention on me instead of an injured teammate or a gen jockey.
---
Let's be honest here, water is wet, the pope is catholic, bears shit in the woods, and redditors downvote things they don't like regardless of what the voting system is meant for.
---
New player or not, NOED is a legitimate counter for Adrenaline. And that is precisely why Survivor Mains hate it. Despite the fact, NOED unlike Adrenaline (unless you are playing Plague) isn't countrable at all.
---
So no matter how many hours you have in your DBD game, you wanna use NOED? Use it. If that suits your game style, no one is or should stop you.
---
Ghostface is my new main, he is pretty much a hybrid of two of my favourite killers and i love Scream.
---
headass
---
A few people had that kind of concept (The human killer) lol I did as well but this isn’t my take on him/her, Though i put more thought into “that character”, “no face” is something entirely different
---
You cant compare the two. Ones for actually completing your objective.
---
The other is to help because you failed your objective... 
---
Rank 20s use selfcare not adrenaline... they ain't getting making it to end game very often.
---
A buff to killers being SWF wouldn’t necessarily be balanced because a lot of SWF aren’t good together, and imagine the newbies who just want to play with their friends?  Would make them never touch the game again. 
---
Voice coms in game would be great but would have to press a secondary button to speak so we don’t listen to kids screaming in your ear or music- and be able to mute. 
---
Though that still wouldn’t make it balanced now would it? Unless killers can hear you in a certain meter range like F13
---
Quentin too scary
---
Fair enough, but the definition of tunnelling is wittling down a survivor, *specifically*, to knock them out of the match.
---
Focusing hard on one survivor lets the other 3 do gens in peace, and know the progress on gens they're working on. Even if all 3 go up to try and hook save, unhook the survivor, and you chase after the injured one, they all go back and finish whatever gen they got a bunch of progress on.
---
By spreading attention you get more people spending time healing/ looking for gens to work on/ being temporarily useless.
---
If I get a hit in, I’ll chase you, but if you’re just trying to bait me out of a hit, I’ll stay.
---
Speed has to be at least even with survivor to start otherwise there’s no way you’d even get close to one. 60% would be so slow....other than that I like the idea
---
So a killer who is slower than a survivor walking until he hits people, which based on your numbers, he would have to hit survivors around 14 times before his speed would be 100% (not including hooks because, lets face it, he wouldn't get any).
---
What is his power? Why is he called death? What does he attack with?
---
New players would be playing new/not very good killers, as well. If a group of bad survivors that are in rank 18, they wont face tank 8+ killers. They'd face rank 20-16 killers. Killers at that level wouldn't even have the knowledge to use those buffs. Usually all they do is camp and miss almost every swing. You'd be surprised how strong communication is in DBD even if they're by bad players.
---
I hate playing in red ranks. I only got there twice as killer: once to get the achievement for reaching rank 1 and a second time after a break I took just to prove I could still do it
---
If op actually did it because of that mad props for the thought process
---
Seems like it to me. It’s so hard and iffy to counter him and his stalking seems legit broken, I’ve had him dead center of my screen more times than I can count and it still didn’t break him out of it. 
---
I’ve had pretty much nothing but a bad time facing him this weekend, I got super lucky and crawled out once but every other time we’re lucky if we finish more then 2-3 gens. Any other killer it felt like there was a fighting chance against but not him.
---
TBH, I'm not even sure why I bothered posting in this thread. It's the same damn them vs us discussion over and over. 
---
I play both survivor and killer, both sides have advantages. NOED is a perk that's available and players can use it if they want. No one should be flamed for using it. No one should be flamed for using DS or whatever other meta perk you want to insert here. That's it.
---
&gt; Unless killers can hear you in a certain meter range like F13
---
I would uninstall the game.
---
Ebony mori... insta karma
---
It would be even better if the killer could talk back like in Friday the 13th

The thing about people when they use Legion, is that they aren't a chaser, their power is reliant on slowing the game down. One less person on a gen. It's more about slowing the game down, than anything.

Maybe increase the terror radius so extremely that you can't tell where he his.

No  I did not do the math, should've done it, sorry.

Maybe start with the speed from the nurse.

That’s actually a normal feature of the game. It blinds your teammates as well
---
wait are you serious?
---
Even if the dude has every single perk in the game, it's totally fine to run NOED. I mostly run NOED|Blood Warden|Remember me|Ruin when I'm tryharding. Yes, it might be aids to play against as a survivor, but it's just as aids to play against 4 p3 claudettes with lithe or balanced landing which teabag you at every chance.
---
Yes , one survivor will make the hatch open no mater how many engine left.
---
take my upvote

I just started playing this game about a month ago and when i saw jane at first i thought she was a police detective. i don’t know why just my first thought
---
Oh. I havent been on dbd in over a year so I’m still trying to figure out whats been nerfed or not. thanks
---
Dwight doing legion mori
---
They should've done this a long time ago because of how the game actually plays lmao
---
why post unsourced artwork mannnnn
---
yeah ds is crap now, no problem
---
Been playing a few weeks, but I'd like them to add a camp timer near the hooked survivors for the killer. Maybe a circle around a hooked survivor that has a timer where you can't be in that area for too long before having to leave for a few seconds. This is to help cut down on intentionally camping a hooked survivor, which isn't a fun way to play for anyone.
---
Ya one makes it open but when does it spawn in the match
---
I'm not talking about making it a hex. I'm talking about tier 1 NOED exposing everyone and tier 1 Ruin affecting everyone. I only cleanse very hidden dull totems in case NOED pops up the totem is easier to find, but not everyone plays like that. That was a big buff that makes the tiers of those perks pretty much useless.
---
Same or when all gennies get popped and he only hooked 1 person
---
Yay. You want a pat on the back for being a toxic cunt?
---
Hey the ten minute power hour and yes she should have one
---
Yeah but here is the thing. You can take off NOED, use literally any build, but if you win consistently this will never change, you will always be getting hate and they will always find something to blame their mistakes on. If it's not NOED, they'll find something else. They'll even invent things. So don't worry about it, use whatever you want.
---
Thanks for the response, not the answer I was expecting or hoping for if i'm honest but glad to save the blood points to work a bit more on my survivor trainables rather than wasting them.

Yeah I really don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. It’s basic Reddit. If people don’t agree with you, you get downvoted. It’s annoying as fuck like people who disconnect really don’t give a shit in the first place
---
When a survivor creates an alt account to play against babies
---
Nice to see my original work getting reposted.
---
So there’s no toxic behavior, just people not ignoring gameplay, got it.
---
That’s some grade school troll logic.
---
It has to do with the game because I’m actually playing the game.
---
“Just don’t react to people acting like dicks”
---
  - People who act like dicks.
---
I don’t caps lock anger over this but it’s like working in customer service and having someone yell in your face. Yea i can ignore but i still don’t like it.
---
Of course, it's one of the best perks in a game if you reach endgame.
---
Myers' mori is too bugged to be called solid imo
---
That’s a weird way to spell killer main /s
---
Yea exactly, imagine "I found the hex totem" and the killer, "touch it and I tunnel you"
---
Because she's nerfed she shouldn't have bad hitboxes. That's the dumbest thing I've ever seen on reddit
---
I’m just waiting for all the comments saying “nIcE TeABagGiNg”
---
it isn't a must have, but there are many killers that don't know how to pressure without it
---
At least it would be consistent :)

If she didn’t, she’d actually be a useless Killer. This is the one time where I think justifying crap game mechanics is justified
---
Imagine blaming a player for using a perk and not the dev team who made it and implemented it.
---
Nah, the silly bitch has monstrous shrine ;)
---
Usually I work through, I can hit skillchecks. Sometimes I have those game when I can't hit even one ruin skillcheck and they appear every 3 seconds, that's when I give up and search for ruin.
---
Reminds me of when I played my first Mint Rag Hag game with MYC and Devour Hope. I set almost no traps except by my totem and by the hooked person. 
---
At the end I got off two Mori’s and one died on hook while the last person failed to get hatch. I was quoted as “Camping From A distance”
---
Dwight got sick and tired of killers running iron maiden
---
It looks really great :) is this drawn in pen?
---
You got a fair point there :)
---
When the Number of gens completed = number of dead survivors + 1
---
4 survivors alive, hatch spawns after 5 gens
---
3 survivors alive, hatch spawns after 4 gens
---
2 survivors alive, hatch spawns after 3 gens
---
1 survivor alive, hatch spawns no matter what
---
It all depends, sometimes I will. If it makes sense in the moment
---
Against experienced bubbas trees = nothing to you. Except autohaven. Fuck autohaven.
---
when there are 4 survivors alive, you have to do 5 gens 
---
1 less survivor, 1 less gen to do
---
4 survivors - 0 gens left to do
---
3 survivors - 1 gen left to do
---
2 survivors - 2 gens left to do
---
1 survivor - used to be "3 gens left to do", now it's "always"
---
Why are you letting an 8 year old play Dead By Daylight
---
1. Facing four instances of old DS was irritating. It happened. A lot. 
---
2. The killer is the power role. Acting like they shouldn't have game changing perks is ridiculous.
---
Firecracker probably
---
Was this corresponding to my post?
---
Why did you let him hit you?

I never blamed the movie of anything. I only said it dissapointed me and though the DBD version was scarier.   
---
&gt; Also Halloween is one of the most iconic and popular horror icons of all time. Just saying👍 
---
I feel like this is just nostalgia; movies don't tend to age well imo. Don't get me wrong, I value nostalgia but movies is one of the things I feel like it isn't too applicable to.

Adrenaline is fine. Old MoM (since it’s practically useless now) wasn’t
---

How did you not hear Myers breathing
---
I'd much rather go up against Legion than GF.  I like the kids more than I do that sneaky Olsen bastard, I guess.  That and at least with Legion I know the basics.  I can't counter Ghostface worth shit.  (That's probably on me, but I have no idea how to reliably kick him out of stalk.)
---
Besides, I have yet to meet a Susie who isn't nice.  (Not that she doesn't try to kill you, mind, but most Legion players I've met so far were really chill in post-game chat.)
---
Dwights leader perk is kinda in the same formation as the picture, just realized that
---
What is devotion
---
That feels mostly non-canonical, I don’t know why but I feel like April fools would have a more canonical effect. If it celebrates its own birthday or anniversary or something it suggests it itself doesn’t know time enough to figure out when it existed... or that it’s every egotistical.
---
*then again im the kind of guy who wants more about a survivor the entity actively hates or doesn’t have enough control over to stop them from causing problems outside of just making gens escape hatches and gates a thing*
---
Lol wow. Okay buddy.
---
Or how about instead of killers getting and relying on game changing perks they “git gud” like they repeatedly tell survivors?
---
If they fixed hitboxes for her people would just have to git gud because their character is fair now

Thanks for the tips. I was playing against The Legion when he pulled me out of the locker. I don't think I've seen a "hex" totem yet. All the totems I've seen look the same (skulls on a stick). 
---
I forgot that the killer sees scratch marks when survivors run; makes it harder for the survivor to shake the killer. I need to play a few games as the killer so I can see how the other side works.
---
careful, he’s a hero
---
Honestly, I like using noed on Myers, and everyone constantly makes fun of that on here. I don't get why. By the end of the match I'm likely out of stalk points and I can use the tier 2 insta down to catch overly confident survivors off guard. Like, everyone often has their reasons for picking their perks. To try to shame people for their choices is just an attempt at some weird kind of gatekeeping.
---
I think Adrenaline is fine as is. I'd rather see every other underused perk being boosted to make it useful, rather than nerf Adrenaline to be just as bad or not worth it.
---
aDrEnAlInE iS bAlAnCeD cAuSe It CoUnTeRs NoEd
---
&gt;So then NOED is balanced too right? Since it has counters and every Survivor runs its counter?
---
&gt;[**NOOOOOOOO NOED OP FAGGOT BABY KILLER UNINSTALL**](/intensifies)

Imagine reporting someone for using a perk.
---
Hate to say it but you can't be banned for using an in-game mechanic lol. This is like a soccer player demanding the opposing team get a penalty because they scored a goal lmao.

So, this was modified off of (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2828079) this model, with some pins added to help ease assembly. Printed at a 0.2mm resolution and some changes to reduce the layer look on the ears, printed in white PLA. Gaps were filled with drywall mud and some scratches left in it to give a bit more of a used feel. Painted with standard acrylics and airbrushing for the eyes.

You would be surprised how well Blendettes can blend in. Sometimes they literally look like just the normal environment. Here's an [example](https://youtu.be/uilaJx1Z-p4?t=247) clip on how good Blendettes blend in sometimes. If David wasn't there, She never would have been noticed.

ive had this game since it launced on ps4, but im not a hardcore player.  so if i get a chance to play 2 or 3 games a week, thats good.  i'll go weeks without playing.  
---
the last 2 months is probably the most ive ever played.   ive been dumping all my bp into hag to get to the ruin.  
---
just hit lvl 30 with her.  i also like to use other killers (obv)  so outside of billy and nurse, all my other killers are at least a lvl 5.  i got ghost to 10, pig to 15, michael to 12, etc etc
---
so yea the only teachable i have is bbq &amp; chili (that i got from the shrine) and now i have thta first teachable from hag.  so i'm going to use what i have available.  of course i want to run bbq &amp; chili and ruin and monitor and abuse on 70% of my killers.  or nurse's calling and franklins demise.  I just cant.  so im gonna use what i actually have available.
---
Opinion: we feel Survivors complain more than Killers because there are 4 Survivors to 1 Killer.
---
On NOED topic: I run NOED on my Hag because I'm trash as Hag and also don't have anything better on her. (Am I supposed to run Tinkerer, Monsterous Shrine, or Third Seal instead lol?) What I find funny is that whenever I get a good amount of kills from NOED no one seems to complain much, but whenever my NOED gets destroyed early on I get a ton of flame for it. And the people flaming me are usually the ones with Deadaline Timecare.
---
You’re playing ghost face wrong if you’re getting looped while survivors are exposed. You stalk them prior to the chase and peek a corner mid chase to top them off before grabbing the one shot. Very effective.
---
Hag should be the same as Huntress and Myers in my opinion
---
It's not unusual for me to get Bronze Devout with Gold/Iri Malicious. Different playstyles, I guess.
---
The way I see it in regards to that is that if you see an injured Survivor and a healthy one and the healthy one provides no reason for you to chase them then you should go after the injured one. It's simple math, honestly.
---
I just always find it funny when someone unhooks someone else 3 feet away from me, Sprint Bursts away when I turn around, and then I get "noob tunneling toxic" in the post game chat.
---
Kate gets hit: she sounnd like she did in the PTB
---
Yeah this glitch is common at this point I've died from it twice now it's a kick in the dick
---
So if this was to happen would that make Nea The Pig?
---
I mean it's the same argument for instaheals. Survivors should be able to cancel out several minutes of the Killer's work by spending 6000 Bloodpoints and pressing Spacebar :^)
---
But here's the thing. When you play with friends, you get an advantage, yourself. You got coms and the game finds games based on who the lowest rank is. By your logic, why hould survivors have an advantage playing with friends? Your opinion is a bit bias, my guy.
---
I assume it was your first time being stuck like this? I know it sucks and it should be patched a long time ago, but shit happens... just don't get emotional over it and move on. I'm sure there will a lot more opportunities to get 3-4 kills, chin up!
---
The amount of times I got stuck on a tree just by walking around it, oh man...
---
They fixed the cracking in the latest update, didn't they?
---
Absolutely small-brain dogshit post right here, my guy.
---
Also: Try a map with a Yellow Wire. Does wonders.
---
Damn I didn’t realize how much of an issue it was of killers helping survivors and vice versa. As a killer main, this makes me hate survivors with friends a lot less.
---
I disagree, starting with 3 people sucks. It's a waste of time for everyone involved.
---
I ran noed on my cannilbal because it was either noed or something like monsterous shrine
---
This is a great idea on paper but it will just end up being another low-mid tier killer that just gets looked over for the killers like Nurse, Billy, and Huntress
---
would your opinion be that ghostface is infact better than myers then? or just that he isnt as bad as was made out to be?
---
If Huntress ain't winning this one...
---
If you think the game is over when all the gens pop, you're a fool.
---
fair enough
---
You use an even more pro gamer move by using phasing but not moving at all and hope they jump over
---
Myers has fucking murderous snowball potential and he can't be taken OUT of his exposing mode. He takes a bit to get there, but he can make a game go from "fine" to "***AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA***" really fast.
---
Yes.
---
Truth be told it's not very common, this is like my second time that this has happened but God it's frustrating. I brought a key and burned a gateau and they were wasted
---
Yeah lol I main bubba and I get lots of people off guard when I mind game with chainsaw at windows and stuff and I get plenty of salt too. It’s fun tho.
---
&gt;  or the one that shows me their aura when they're on the ground (SO USEFUL)
---
I totally get the point you're making, but don't sleep on Deerstalker. It was even meta back when slug meta was around.
---
For grinding though, I get you. I would argue that the "boost" you get from running it will put you into lobbies you'll get dicked on, and the points you get running it aren't that great.
---
But even perkless Billy can *farm*. Bubba with BBQ is great early on too.
---
That would eliminate most of the reason to even run the perk.
---
Maybe they sucked ass and just kept running back and fourth into the basement?
---
The point should be to punish unnecessary/excessive tunnelling.
---
Once the doors are open, all should be fair.
---
That story was a rollercoaster. Loved how it turned out though. We have all been there with some survivors
---
if we're being serious though claudette would probably be nurse
---
Love The Spirit’s lore, I’ve always had a thing for japanese myths and all that.
---
B-b-b-but I'm a *solo player*! How do you expect me to count to *five*!?
---
And it does. If someone is hitting their DS when the gate is open it obviously means you tunneled them
---
But mUh geNrUsH
---
no yeah i agree with this. the perk has risk for its reward. perks i don't agree with are things like bbq and chili which doesn't force the killer to take any risk at all. no tradeoff or downside from running that perk. needs to be cut in half in terms of benefit imo.
---
I run small game with borrowed time, decisive strike, and deliverance. They'll focus me like a dickhead, and it'll take so many tries to get me to stick to that hook.
---
You can, bring adrenaline! How many extra chances do survivors need?
---
Survivors within the terrorradius of the husk cant hear phasing sound. So you only hear her when she follow you a longer distance away from the husk or she came randomly from any position.
---
Dunno if that's a killer tho
---
I have seen a few stories like this recently. It’s super unfortunate and ruins the fun of the game.
---
They expose themselves for one minute. Unstoppable counter.
---
I’m going to take everyone’s advice and
---
switch the build for sure.
---
I’ve not been playing the game that long so I’m not sure what builds are best I appreciate the perk advice !
---
He used a 2B pencil! And I’ll be sure to keep in touch if he draws more!
---
I don’t see it that way.
---
DS and NOED both exist. Alright fine, each side has a “OP” perk the other side complains about. DS gets changed/nerfed. Well, that sucks for survivors. NOED stays the same. Killers tell survivors to git gud when survivors call out their crutch perk. Which is ironic. 
---
That’s what I have a problem with. If DS never got changed, I wouldn’t care about NOED.
---
Lol imagine still complaining about Decisive Strike. Killer mains have become what survivor mains used to be, entitled.
---
I think your opinion is a little bias. If swf is such a problem than BHVR would have took it out by now. I can’t tell you how many swf I’ve fucked up and same with any other killer that is good at the game.
---
Only works once. And it doesn’t matter if killer is waiting to down you again. At least my suggestion gives you more chances.
---
It pretty much is. You can only finish up your chase, and if the survivors want they can leave immediately.
---
You can argue different for specific endgame builds, like Blood Warden
---
But by all means, killer *should* end game before 5 gens 90% of the time, and not doing so means you fucked up big time somewhere

A shorter way of saying both latino AND latina. Normally I've seen latino used in a way to include women, similar to how saying men/guys/dude doesn't always mean exclusively men, but I guess that's been a changing thing for some years now.

Yeah it was one of the firecrackers, this game was also my first experience getting blinded by a fire cracker ! Which is why after the down I just kinda stood there confused about how I was blinded !

Have to agree with you on clown. A truly unsettling individual that was never pushed towards evil, just naturally gravitated towards it.
---
I am so fucking confused.
---
No shit gens are a priority to get everyone out. You can't do a fucking gen with the killer right behind you for the entire fucking match you fool. If the killer is chasing you you're just gonna stop mid chase to work on a gen or you gonna try to survive being tunneled all game? You only have 2 options in that situation. Die or run and loop the killer because we all know you're not going to make doing gens a priority in thr middle of a chase.
---
I don’t mind losing. I do however mind when the killer is wasting time instead of just hooking me or Mori-ing me.
---
Adren is not on the same level as noed buddy. At least you have toe work and survive for adrenaline to work. It's rewarding you. Unlike noed. So don't even try to put them on the same pedestal. They are not two sides of the same coin.

---
Yeah I didnt think about them being more counterable. Cleansing all totems on solo queue is really hard without running small game because you dont know how many totems were cleansed by your team. I try to only cleanse very hidden dulls so it's easier to find the NOED totem, but not everyone does that leaving the hardest totem to find becoming NOED. RUIN seems to either be found within the first minute or not at all in the ranks I'm in.  So yeah, they can be countered, but to make it easier, you really need small game or survive with friends. I'm not hating on people who use it since I mostly run a meta build. I'm sure killers hate going against BL, DS, SB and mostly adrenaline. Completely agree with you are buffing other perks to change the meta. That would be great. Another thought, there is different meta builds for different killers. Survivors are pretty much skins so the meta for us doesnt change. I wish there were a way to make it so different survivors had different metas, but making perks teachable pretty much killed that.
---
Honestly, I'd still run BBQ if it were just a points perk, that is still waaay better than anything.
---
NOED is part of this game like camping close to their face and tunnel. It is part of this game and more killers should do so because survivors are toxic. They have to many pallets and run to them all the time.
---
Maybe other killers should be buffed so we have variety but instead people cry out for nerfs whenever a new killer is released or the new killer is somewhat decent.
---
That is not the type of gameplay the devs are trying to promote. Otherwise unhooking wouldn't be a mechanic. Stop trying to defend killers who use a stupid perk that gives them free kills for doing jack all game.
---
Meh, just browse reddit or something. It's not like they can keep you indefinitely. Sometimes killers are trying to avoid DS. Sometimes they don't think they can get you to a hook but don't want to have to chase you again. Some of them probably just want to see the endgame sacrifice, it is still relatively new after all.
---
Um I was making a Joke about this video. But yall are like 12 years old and dense af to comprehend anything.
---
He’s a great noob stomper just so you know
---
For sure lol
---
Detective's Hunch is good for finding multiple totems at once!
---
Or maybe Frank is wearing Susie's clothes. (?)
---
i'd change something with the end game collapse. currently, it's really hard for a killer to sacrifice all four survivors since once the third one goes, the hatch appears regardless of how many gens have been repaired.  then it's just a race to the hatch, which the survivor seems to find about 50% of the time in my experience. it's annoying to be steamrolling the survivors only to have the last guy find the hatch. 
---
i'm not sure how you could solve it, but maybe the hatch spawn is delayed for the survivors based on how many gens are remaining. if you're the last survivor but there are still 4 gens remaining, then it's a minute until the hatch spawns. not sure.
---
Boxcutter so I can get those big booty Janes up on the hook.
---
I'd just stay in party chat to void all of that.
---
I fully agree, although I personally feel NOED needs some kind of action-based stacking to activate. Like kicking a certain number of gens or something like that.
---
What about Merged maps? Get rid of a part of the wall from 2 different maps and bash them together
---
I think they’re similar in concept but require different play styles. I wouldn’t say one is better than the other, in the right hands they are both viable at red ranks. I think Ghostface in his current form is extremely underrated. Lots of people are attempting to play him as a m1 killer that has a charge up insta-down, which is what he may appear to be at face value. However his skill set is much more focused towards mind games and area denial. His ability to lock down a portion of the map is on par with The Doctor. With constant repositioning and shroud up its very difficult for survivors to keep a bead on your location. Stalk should never be used when the survivor has the potential to knock you out of it, only use it when you see them but they don’t know your location. When played correctly you’ll spend the game snatching one survivor after another off of objectives.
---
Hitting someone twice, with the doors open, is next-to impossible. The distance they get from the post-hit sprint can carry them half way across the map.
---
Why do I wanna believe that Trapper also thinks that camping is a LeGIt sTrAtEgY
---
You're not thinking clearly. You say the devs didn't intend for that type of gameplay, yet who do you think designed and implemented that perk? The devs did. 
---
Don't be emotional, you need to understand what's happening, why it's happening, and what you can do to counter it. When you see noed pop up, leave. It's that simple, just leave. You can also do totems, which is another thing people seem to be adverse to doing while also complaining about noed. 
---
When noed is active and you continue running around trying to make saves it's entirely your fault if the killer downs you. You knew noed was active and you chose not to leave despite it. You **empowered** them to get those easy kills, you and only you with your decision to stay. If you don't like the perk then stop empowering the killer by letting them use it on you.
---
We have plenty of variety it’s just the god awful map design and rng of getting infinites and windows. Killers really don’t need buffing except Freddy. If the maps were better designed I think killers like Bubba, Freddy and wraith can do better instead of having to tunnel one person to get a kill. If we buffed every killer to nurse/spirit/billy level playing against killer would feel unfun and unbalanced.
---
Imagine getting emotionally triggered over a casual game. People are so weak man, I swear. If you can't stand PvP environment, play with barbie dolls, atleast they will do what you want them to.
---
No, I'm just looking for a little counter-play.
---
How do you play around it?
---
How'd you get up there to begin with?
---
I dont get upset at people for running any perk, it's their decision. I sit in green ranks since I dont get as much time to play as I used to so I encounter NOED a lot. I dont usually die to it, I just hate that I more times than not have to leave someone to die to it. I'll never say anything rude to someone running a perk. It's not a big deal, just gets boring dealing with it all the time because my team try to save against it then they all go down and I feel like an asshole for leaving if it's suicide and then I get hate messages for not being a team player.
---
&gt; I know you can just leave, but I'm super altruistic. I hate leaving someone behind to the point where I will die if someone can get out.
---
EXACTLY. Same here.
---
Consider that matches NOED shows up in also usually mean the killer struggles enough with gen pressure to choose to run NOED. Which means in those matches, you're either being chased all match by the killer, or you're working on gens all game.
---
So you either take one smack to the face as punishment for playing well and running the killer all game, or you spent 5 minutes holding M1 with nothing interesting happen.
---
But now the killer has noed. You're so fucking desperate for points or something interesting to happen you say "I'll stick around and try for the save"
---
Flip a coin, and it's random whether or not your teammates follow up and if you end up dying on the hook (or even everyone ends up dying) just cause they wanted to try some stuff against a killer running the "im bad" perk. And guess what- the killer gets credit for that as though they did a good job, get a pip, and get put into another lobby they can't lay pressure on.
---
People say "don't feel bad for funning NOED!" but it's just SO god damn boring and unfun. It's not STRONG unfun, it's just fucking *shitty*.
---
Ebuni mury
---
You can bring blood!
---
I remember my first firecracker... "The fuck was that? A snake?" then I was blind lol.
---
Same
---
A BB Gun?
---
I like Mikey. Always loved the Hallowen movies. But, game original, the huntress, her mom humming that song really impacted her lol.
---
I love how everybody but the Jane who got downed DC’d immediately
---
You can't bring that
---
Same here. It brings me back to my first days on the game
---
Dont tunnel or slug them...
---
You can't unless it's a Fancy Bikini
---
Escalation: quickly
---
Nice teabagging
---
what about my shit.
---
Keep them slugged for 60 seconds.  If they're gonna crawl out, so be it.  Take your points and move to the next match.
---
Yeah if you play her you notice her right hand is larger than her left, she uses it to hurt survivors.
---
Pretty much this. I dont hate on anyone using it, it's just so unfun.
---
Her Traps no longer trigger once all the gens are done, that’s it. Maybe try using them all during the match and killing everyone before the last gen gets done instead.
---
Tell him I said welcome to the game!
---
Like Devour Hope?
---
I'd probably make a change like making dull totems faintly glow with fireflies appearing slightly around them, making them indicate "something is coming" and an actual chance at finding all the totems to cleanse.
---
And it only does that when you're on the last 1 or 2 gens.
---
That way, the "stalling" cleansing totems is meant to do ACTUALLY happens.
---
Can do!
---
They all sprinted to the other exit like it was gonna do something
---
Thanks, but now I'm torn as what youve described ghostface as is pretty much how I was hoping he would be played, and everyone else who has replied seems to be more describing the extended/permanent tier 3 version of myers as opposed to the monitor and dead rabbit version I prefer. 
---
Out of interest what perks/addons do you run for him?
---
Yes it is
---
Eating spicy goodness
---
Crazy deep, great work
---
Nicely done!
---
It activates in the TR, that would be within 20M of the Huntress.
---
Meg is Clown confirmed
---
But the Shape is already in shape!
---
Getting outplayed at its highest level
---
Still the same. Thse support hasn't said anything useful too
---
Freddy. His perks are good if you know how to use him.
---
Ya, pretty much like Devour, though i also wouldnt mind what you said instead. Really just anything so that it isn't an automatic easy kill just for being bad. I understand the idea of throwing the killer a bone if they just had a bad match, but i feel they should at least have to work some for it or survs should get to know its coming when theres like 1 gen left.
---
Nice P3 Claudette!
---
I just wanted to chime in with a funny story of how I got my three blink trophy, I was mid chase with a guy in Yamoaka by shack and blinked through a set of rocks where a totem was when I heard him hide behind there and begin to break it, I didn’t hold blink long enough so I blinked again to go through the rock (twice because I failed again, bad nurse ere) and when I got through on my third blink I got to yoink him off, never been happier thank getting that trophy by pure accident
---
just out of curiosity, what have they said?
---
Had a daily to open an exit gate with a specific survivor, and no joke, it took me close to an hour to complete thanks to teammates like these. 
---
Most games we never even came close to finishing all 5 generators and being able to open a gate.
---
I can already imagine the AF joke code somehow slipping into the main live version.
---
It just WILL happen. Game breaking sounds everywhere haha.
---
M16
---
UT, probably. 00:00
---
I'm sure you have lots of fun playing against Prayer Beads spirit with either amulet or ring. I know I really enjoy it when things have 0 counterplay.
---
i’m just saying, your gen jockeys who can hide from danger and do gens within less than 80 seconds alone are just as valuable as the person keeping them safe.

---
&gt;Once the doors are open, all should be fair
---
except if you’re the survivor
---
Can someone explain what happens?
---
ok ms BiG bRaIn. she deserved it
---
True it happened to my friend who was playing claudette
---
Why not? All the other Killers got to bring their weapons.
---
Double engraving add ons, chainsawed to the car from a hill.
---
As if this game doesn't generate enough salt already
---
Oh God no.
---
yeah I agree with this,they nerfed legion to the ground,it was badly designed so this was inevitable.....
---
but we need a legion Complete rework.
---
You can literally just run out. If you can't manage that, that's on you.
---
But go ahead, take you free escape that the Killer can't counter.
---
ALT + Enter switches between windowed and (windowed) fullscreen mode; maybe try whether this combination remedies the issue.
---
one of them just sent me this [link](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/153/master-fixed-and-general-guidelines) and just change the status of my ticket as solved. YEAH big help
---
Spiderbilly, spiderbilly, does whatever a chainsaw can
---
There was a hill next to the truck and billy had bounced off of my head to get there.
---
So you just full-on admit there's no counter.
---
That a Survivor is entitled to escape because they are running a certain perk.
---
If the Killer downs you WITH THE DOORS OPEN, you don't deserve to escape.
---
When I complained about it they changed it to open again lol
---
1. Good luck hitting another Survivor twice before they run out the door.
---
2. Slugged Survivors can still crawl out the door.
---
I have 100/10 Mbit down/up, wired. Sometimes survivors still say they had laggy game. Ban me from playing killer?
---
Oh I know what survive with friends is. Just not the abbreviation
---
OH MY GOD and the killer stun noises would play if they get pulled off from windows, pallets, and generators.
---
I need this now.
---
I thought the huntress had a weenier there for a second
---
Yes thats exactly what i said  i said i want it to be a survivor survey that permanetly bans you from playing killer if you dont pass
---
Lmao I play billy so I could just rev my chainsaw
---
This. If I had a nickel for everytime a killer mindgamed me with this, I'd only have two nickels. But each time I just nodded repeatedly in submission.
---
That Dwight is fucking **T E R R Y F Y I N G.**
---
You can’t “literally just run out” if the killer is camping you because the exit gates are open. That’s not a free escape. That’s using a perk that has a single use in order to escape
---
That right foot though
---
Welcome to DbD, where no one is allowed to play killer
---
Not just killers but survivors too.
---
Amen
---
I wish Dwight would choke me like that.
---
Yes, once u sacrifice 25 of each survivor character (Claudette, Jake, Dwight and Meg)  u get their faces as cosmetics.
---
Don't egg me on.
---
Oh ya fair enough.
---
Not within the terror radius
---
I never said they aren't. Quit assuming shit and putting words in my mouth. I said I'll do gens until I'm found and then kite the killer for the remainder of the match once I am found. If I'm found first then I've got no choice but to do it for the whole entire match. I'm not going to make a gen my priority over surviving in the middle of being chased.
---
I'm also not gonna farm someone off the hook and give the killer more than 1 kill when I don't use selfish care and no one wants to heal me. I'm leaving out that gate. 
---
Abuse the vote system all you want but it doesn't change the fact I'm right I'm my decisions which dynamically change given certain situations in the game.
---
Well now you're claiming entitlement to something.  Where in the DbD "rules" does it say a survivor should never escape because they got downed after the doors are opened?  I main killer and I still find this argument absurd.
---
Chances are, unless you hook them near the door, they aren't crawling out anyway, so you're talking about a very niche scenario that you want to gimp a perk over that has already been reworked from a much more obnoxious state.
---
In myth salt/chalk circles keep demons out, so sometimes as a killer it's funny to respect those rules.
---
3 games in a row consisted of 3 people who refused to heal being Killed super early and then me finding the hatch.
---
Shoutout to the Nea with Self Care who didn't have Adrenaline who refused to heal herself or let herself get healed against a Nurse when there were 3 gens left to be done. Girl we're not going to finish 3 gens and open the gates before the Killer finds you again.
---
Also shoutout to the Legacy 3 Meg who suicided on first hook against Nurse because it was Nurse.  
---
Perkless Nurse might I add. Lol.
---
Just imagine the bugs lmao
---
You don’t lose items or add ons in kyf, in swf you do.
---
Wraith goes out of cloak: Bills falling sound.
---
chainsaw revcing: Clown laughter
---
Fair, laggy killers fucks up the game in a more major way IMO
---
and if you were hooked before they were opened and you were being camped?
---
You know its possible to down somebody else that wasnt just on the hook?
---
&gt; Noed is my own fault for not doing the totems.
---
Literally not doing any totems all match is a greater counter to NOED.
---
If you do the dull totems you can spot out in the open, NOED is more likely to pop up on a totem no one can find.
---
Can't bring an M16
---
I still run Noed, and I have 1000 hours in the game. It’s a great perk too counter gen rushing. They made it too where you gain emblem points for cleansing totems, so Noed should be non existent now.
---
Oh yeah I agree massively but have you ever gone against a survivor who is hopping across the map? Haha. It's the same that way too. 
---
Sometimes people have good internet but the matchmaking puts them against people in different regions and the lag is actually from the high ping.
---
songbird dont need no stereo types
---
You can bring a yellow submarine
---
If one particular survivor is trying to play but was queued with crappy teammates, I'll let them live if they're the last one alive because I feel sorry for them. It's also a game for everyone, which means it should be fun for EVERYONE. Killers playing toxic ways remove any fun from the game for survivors.
---
yeah, I’d love to have a teammate like you, or anyone who doesn’t get caught at the exit gates after trying to heal, but at the same time I’d rather die going back for a save for a teammate who is the only reason I can escape rather than escape and leave them to die
---
if the killer ended the game before 5 gens 90% of the time, we wouldn't have the developers saying they're aiming for a 50% winrate. A win for killer being defined as 2 or more dying (at least thats what i thought they defined a win as).
---
When you're married for 50 years and never cheat.
---
Shape does have very good snowball potential but Ghostface has incredible sustainability, for survivors the pressure never really snowballs it sort of hovers at a constant level of hopelessly screwed. One jump scare after another they slowly realize everywhere they go you go and everything they do you see and they have no idea where you’re going to be lurking or where you’ll come from next. Eventually objectives are abandoned as they’re restricted to an ever decreasing area of play.
---
I use detectives hunch with a map (gotta use them for something) when a new map comes out. Don't always live those games but helps a bunch in later games.
---
I always use Spine Chill because even if she phasing towards me it will light up. As soon as it does I move away from the area and try to hide before she phases back in. If she’s already chasing me I try to change directions and avoid running if possible to make her lose me. Doesn’t always work but sometimes it saves me.
---
Dance with me is always on my load out as well.
---
You can bring "my shit" or a medkit, or medicine, you can also bring milk, or a mouse!
---
What happens though when all survivors are around the hook and the timer goes off? You just let them all escape?
---
I find it funny that experienced people flex on/bitch at new players in games. 
---
Like, how sad is your life?
---
Does it have torpedoes?

A moderately difficult skillcheck to kill a survivor. Instantly 😂😂😂😂😂
---
You can’t be serious
---
It is
---
Black wards are fine. I use them too. 
---
I definitely do not think everything I do not like is toxic. However, playing PB spirit enough to have to use black wards to keep using them is some serious sociopathic shit. Imagine going into every game knowing you are actively making people miserable for the next 10 minutes. Every single game. If you've leveled spirit to 50, you know what the spawn rates on that addon are like. The only way to run out is to use them every game. 
---
So no, I don't feel any sympathy for OP getting stuck in a pallet one time. Getting blinded on spirit? What a joke! She's virtually immune to pallet blinds because of her animation. This dude is playing the absolute most braindead easymode loadout possible every single game, yet he has the temerity to complain because he was denied his deserved "4k" by a bug. 
---
I've never teabagged. I've been hit by dstrike exactly 1 time in the past week of playing killer daily. I gg every game and I don't complain about noed in postgame. I'm as wholesome as they come. This right here is me calling a spade a spade.
---
I like how my main is right on the line of wholesome and annoying
---
Someone please make this real
---
Everyone forgets the horrifying size and shape of the Hags hand. She wins, no doubts. It’s all about technique and she would just wrap that giant, wet, back slapper around peoples hands and crush them. 
---
Myers and Clown are the strongest, but wouldn’t stand a chance.
---
Huntress's directional lullaby is messed up I believe, but they did actually remove Ghostface's 8 meter noise. You've only got his sexy leather to alert you now.
---
Every time haha
---
Yeah that’ll be sick
---
Yellow submarine with torpedoes? Sure :) it also has a yellow lab and a Ying Yang pin in it ;)
---
i like to take an opposing viewpoint than someone, because either i'm wrong and i learn something. Or they're wrong, their mother is a hamster and their father smells of elderberries.
---
Yes glad I saw ur post I was beginning to think my game was corrupt!
---
Developers have already said the average of 2 deaths is already exceeded a bit more than they anticipated/ want.
---
And it's incredibly easy to rank up as killer, so you get dogshit players getting bodied a lot. Either the 1 or 2k from tunnelling/ camping, or the 0k from being outplayed.
---
How r killers still not able to get out from situations like this? Just wait until a survivor comes at u and press m1 to grab...ur aim is not to hit but GRAB! that will instantly push u away from the pallet.
---
Pretty wild that killers running a perk to get them a down in the end game is considered bad. Considering most games for killer the match is half over by the time he downs one and the second it is over. Adrenaline popped and everyone's back to full health. So now if he isn't running noed he has to hit one person two more times before he finds an exit. And that's a situation where a killer is playing pretty decently. I dont run noed. Never have. But I'm tired of seeing people say its bullshit to fight. Its bullshit that I have to find four people and hit them twice to down them. Bullshit that I have to chase them. Bullshit that I have to hook them and the only job survivors have is to do gens. Running noed and making people believe there's a chance that there could be one slows the game down and makes them do something other than a gen which gives me more time. Its completely fucking fair. Its bullshit after all my hard work they get adrenaline and heal without even pressing a button. Its bullshit that if I hook someone in the end and then they get unhooked and have decisive they can stun me for 5 seconds because I downed him twice.
---
Except all these things have counters right? So they aren't bullshit. Noed isn't cheap. Noed is completely fair. That a perk can instill fear in you to make you think you have to do more than mindlessly repair gens or deal with noed because you want to do that. You suffer the consequences and its completely fair to both sides because of it. You even get points for lb if you cleanse totems while killers are in chases now. It's not even a punishment anymore. Stop whining about fucking noed. There are so many more killer perks that are so much better
---
Personally I love that on ghostface, they made their own person behind the mask rather than using billy, stu, mickey, mrs loomis, roman, jill or charlie
---
&gt;the cherry on the cake was someone wishing my family would die in a car accident
---
The knuckle dragger who said that to you cooks his hot pockets in a dirty microwave. The beard is thick on the neck. Probably breaths in and out through his mouth.
---
Hey! I’m not the only one!
---
I agree with half of your first idea. I don't think getting rid of the ranking system will help generate new players, I think that will just drive them away because of the toxicity of some people. But I would love ranking rewards, especially if you accumulated more rewards or maybe even extra bp as you stayed around that rank. Like, let's say you are rank 1 survivor this season. You will get a cosmetic reward, maybe a head or body or bottom or etc, and then if you stayed at that rank or stayed at rank 1/2 for a while into the season then you would get 10k bp. Now, if that was implemented, there would have to be a timer for players to have play matches in red ranks, otherwise you could just stay there as surv or killer and get extra stuff for free. I think the timer should be that you have to play 1 or 2 in the span of 3 days, otherwise it kicks back to rank 3, 4, or 5.
---
As for "b" I wouldn't like to see that honestly. Especially near the end of the battle pass. This doesn't speak for me so much on my survivor side as it does killer, but you can't expect everyone to get to a certain rank, especially if they just joined the game and have put some hours in just to get to an item in the battle pass that required you to be rank 6. I don't think that would be fair for people that are new or for people that play only one side or etc.
---
I haven't played PC DBD, because I am a PS4 player, so that's on you. 
---
They are gonna punish people for disconnecting when dedicated servers come out, so you have one wish that will be coming true.
---
Doing totems is a boring process that doesn't reward you past maybe disabling a perk the killer has. You can end up losing a game because, rather than doing gens, all oyu did was do totems because "wHaT iF nOeD". 
---
In the game you are supposed to be altruistic. I am not being emotional, I just understand game design and how much of a bad perk noed is. It punishes survivors for doing their objective and not concentrating on secondary objectives, while also surviving to the end. It basically rewards the killer for doing poorly and survivors doing good. You don't have to do anything to get it to work, just plop it and you can get your kills. You didn't have to do a tedious task as killer to get it to activate, it just does.
---
That is bad perk design. As I said before, at least adrenaline rewards you for doing what you are supposed to do AND survive to the end.
---
A survivor is not empowering the killer, they are doing their job. If you leave without even trying to find noed and save, then you are a dick and that's the truth.
---
I don't want to see more incentives for survivors doing totems, I want to see killers have to work (and I mean work WORK) to get that type of effect at the end.
---
Not only that, but it's a cheap shot, because you don't know they have noed until someone gets hit. Thus survivors feel robbed, despite doing what they supposed to all game. Not only that, but the simple fact that 5k BP are gated behind escaping makes things even worse.
---
Simply put, NOED is a badly designed perk or at least poorly designed for the current state of DbD. It might have had its use back in the day of millions of pallets and infinites when killers actually struggled to get anybody killed, but now? Now this perk is unnecessary. Killers are in the best state they've ever been.
---
that’s unlucky:(
---
i can't consider myself a Plague main but i've played her a lot recently and she's enjoyable. my current build is Corrupt Intervention, PGTW, BBQ and Surveillance (sometimes i swap it for Discordance)
---
Why should gens go significantly faster when everyone is playing BBQ &amp; HEX: Ruin?
---
you really have to be that negative? what a joke
---
This is very inaccurate. 1: Ghostface is not A tier. He’s not bad but he can’t do anything against gen rushers so he’s easy too counter. 2; Hag is a top tier killer, no way is Leatherface stronger then her in any form. 3: Freddy may be bad, but he is a lot better then Bubba tbh. This is probably from your experience but I must ask what rank are you since this can massively change opinions.
---
Carl the Cashier, Buffy and her Scooby gang, maybe random anime characters like Araragi
---
we have Dwight already
---
PGTW?
---
Does anyone know if Ghostface’s detailed victim routine and purple drivers license addons stack?
---
There wouldn't be a point in using it then, and people would ONLY use it for trolling.
---
they do
---
Never heard of golden envelopes on maps...have seen the boxes tho
---
Yea I have ended entire games by cleansing haunted grounds, but those 1000 bloodpoints were so tempting.
---
that was the menu music when I (and pretty much everyone else who came in from the PSPlus deal) started playing and for a while I didn't even realize it wasn't always the default menu music.
---
New map?
---
&gt; "wHaT iF nOeD"
---
is plenty enough reason. Either complain about noed, or complain that cleansing totems is pointless, you cannot complain about both though.
---
&gt;In the game you are supposed to be altruistic.
---
you are categorically not supposed to be suicidally altruistic. Do you really not understand the difference between altruism and suicide? 
---
&gt;If you leave without even trying to find noed and save, then you are a dick and that's the truth.
---
more imaginary rules. My rule is that if you try to make a save when noed is active and you get downed for it, you forfeit your right to cry about noed, and that's the truth.
---
Fact of the matter is noed has drawbacks, counters, and mitigations. But instead of recognizing that people just whine. I guess I just play survivor differently than you all, I choose not to squirt tears when I see noed, instead I play the game.
---
I fully agree.
---
Shush
---
It is rewarding you but it is rewarding you too much. Just like noed rewards way too much "buddy". If you think that adren and noed are ok then theres something wrong with you. Adren has no counter, killers do not control their gen protection emblem and if it triggers, it gives a free 5 seconds sprint + 4 insta heals. Noed can be countered easily, its just players like you who are entitled to only one opinion, yours. Yes you cant compare adren with noed its true. That is because its was more powerful than noed, if someone gets downed by noed, its your fault. You had all the possibilities to cleanse those totems. Its boring to cleanse them, true, thats why noed needs to get reworked or nerfed. Just make it only give you 10% more movement speed and remove the insta down. 
---
Adrenaline is not ok since the survivors have the power role. That is a fact. You think otherwise, you are wrong and you should put 500 hours into playing killers at red ranks to see how helpless you feel. And no, fuck off with nurse. 
---
If they are reworking or nerfing noed, they will nerf or rework adren too. If you think that one of them is ok and the other is op, wake up and use your brain a little and maybe play both sides.
---
&gt; Do 5 totems, no NOED is possible
---
Play solo queue. Cleanse 5 totems.
---
Go on. Try it.
---
Because no one fucking ever cleanses all 5 totems. Ever since they buffed totem hiding spots, they are legit unpredictable to find.
---
You might get a god team with someone running Small Game and in SWF you can communicate where totems are. But even then you're better off keeping track of them till you confirmed you've found 5 different totems, THEN cleansing them.
---
&gt;It's pretty easy to do a once over of the map and get all 5.
---
It's **actually** not. To boot, it's not fun. I'd rather get the match over with and exit the gates and let my teammate die on that noed hook than run around searching for dull totems and holding M1 some more. And not even for any guarantee that it'll pay off.
---
The TRUE counter to NOED is cleansing "Whoah that's one hidden totem" dull totems, and keeping dull totems next to unrepaired gens/ exit gates up, so you can bring noed to those easy locations. That's what I and everyone TRIES to do but you get drooling morons who cleanse every totem in the god damn match except the one that's impossible to find.
---
GENERATORS!
---
Without addons it has to be Wraith/Freddy
---
Sithface*
---
survivors running that ip block program would just block you though
---
y the fuk did u get downdooted
---
Ripply from alien. That girl can put up a fight. Also would love to see alien in the game
---
How's myer with a broken arm? lol He's one of the strongest killers.
---
I mean under the unsportsmenlike option, it says disconnecting. I doubt anything will be done about it though
---
Clutch.
---
If we get Ripley we need a xeno
---
As a main Billy, I'm proud &lt;3
---
So less people would use the perk, and that would be a good thing.
---
Oh yes
---
&gt; There are so many more killer perks that are so much better
---
That's not the crux of the issue. If anything, that's the point from survivor's side; RUN better perks so you don't have to depend on a boring one like NOED.
---
i just tab out and watch a 20 min video so half my wait is done
---
One time, I’m putting my faith in this sub not to be perverted.

Please.
---
oh my god... cubone huntress is so cute
---
Yes you can watch Myers video as well he had done a grt animation.
---
JRPG subs are hands down the worst! I asked a question on the Xenoblade sub (100 hours into the game) and was mocked in every reply.
---
youtubers making a thumbnail for a video
---
Uhm is there like a story behind david that I don‘t know?
---
Premonition is the best perk in the game. I have no idea why survivors don't use it?  All you have to do is circle the camera until it warns you of the killer's approach.  Calmly walk away before the killer arrives.   He or she won't find you.  They break the generator and go somewhere else, target someone else.  This the Goth's guy invisibility perk  and borrowed time are the top three perks! If every team member  should equip these.   Last perk is freebee.
---
I joined the game listening to the Freddy Halloween theme. The twangy notes at the beginning matched my shit graphics

I like The Spirit’s theme the best because that’s when I got the game. I thought it was the real theme for a while
---
*perhaps*
---
4/10. These perks are just ok tbh. I would run Im All Ears, Ruin or PGTW, Monitor and Abuse, and nurses. Unfortunately your perks just don’t have any synergy with each other which is the big problem.
---
A rusty spoon.
---
Trust this subreddit? You're gonna have a baddd time.
---
Sidney Prescott,
---
Wait..people here flame killer for using noed. Tell them this game is suitable for 18 and above and not for whiny kids.
---
Need to try this with Jane
---
Truetalent is pretty vocal and tends to go into the strategy of what he's doing/the survivors are doing.
---
Preeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaach
---
I watched Tru3 and Monto for both killer and survivor experiences, but tbh you just gotta learn from playing. Watching is very different then playing.
---
This is awesome, what other gamemodes are there you can do with your friends?
---
Or maybe let killers play with what they want? ever heard of a fun factor?
---
agreed, after all an escape is JUST 5k BP. a safe unhook at end game alone is like 2500 along with an additional 700 if you heal them, + any boldness you get from the killer who is most likely around. Throw in a WGLF stack and it's much better than just leaving.
---
It's not tunneling if it's been 30 seconds and he happened to find you. Then it's just funding you.
---
I started doing this, because just standing there seems to work for everyone but me. 
---
I thought maybe I had it wrong and "maybe i was supposed to actually phase but stand there". So I started doing that and survivors fall for it every time.   
---
I have no idea why faking it doesn't work for me, maybe there is some kind of animation or sound that gives it away (my camera is 100% still) and I just happen to get all the smart survivors because that's my luck.
---
The same applies to survivors. 
---
Borrowed time is boring, Adrenaline is boring. DS is boring. 
---
They take no skill to use and reward bad play. 
---
People still run them because they’re strong and they feel they need to. 
---
Killers who feel they need NoeD should be treated no differently, they’re using it because they feel they need to. 
---
The complaints I feel are more directed at the players of both sides who are good enough to not need to rely on the more ‘crutch’ type perks, but use them because they are so strong in a skilled players hands.
---
Yeah I never understood why people raged over perk usage, in game or out. If something actually feels unbalanced, that’s the devs responsibility to fix, not the players’ responsibility to somehow know to avoid. Just about every perk has its counter and/or limitations. People need to worry less about what other players are doing and more about their own gameplay (with the normal caveats of trolls or cheaters, that’s a different bag of issues)
---
Altogether? When? Last I heard they just lowered the distance from 16 metres to 8 metres, and it worked fine up until the latest patch which caused several audio issues, including but not limited to the ones I mentioned in my previous comment.
---
Nope! I'd say its a good perk on ANY killer.
---
I'm still of the mind that a simple daily discussion thread where mostly anything goes would be ideal (like the Apex sub), but meh. I just feel like those threads would see more traction, and people with genuine bug report concerns and LFG wouldn't have to wait until that specific day to get their business done.
---
Besides, you should probably post bug reports and technical issues on the official forum anyway :\
---
Naw, Billy is great but the Nurse is the most toxic killer main around. Plus if used properly, is much faster than the Billy. It's what Meg deserves
---
The perk can become completely useless within 30 seconds. Lol. Definitely not the best
---
Nah, it’s gone. Only his clothes make noise now. And his footsteps.
---
-42 points. lol
---
In general add on stack unless they say other wise in the description
---
Very spoky
---
Baby killers that use noed on billy xd
---
It doesn't work for mending (idk why). It only works for healing
---
Same can be said about survivors who think they're God's gift but be entitled and DC against a killer, dicking over their entire team.
---
Sound familiar?
---
-15 points lol
---
Downvoted because you're a dick
---
Unfortunately not as mending and healing are different
---
I understand that. I'm just hoping to learn good habits early and hopefully not develop sloppy ones. The less mistakes the better. The best way to do that outside of doing it myself is to watch someone whose rather adept.
---
Probably. They could have reworked it like they did with DS or litereally anything other than having that perk higher than tier one is useless.
---
oh shit... a generatA AFDSGFASDGCGSCZ
---
It’s probably because she’s so different and nobody uses her on console, but I love nurse chases. It’s just straight up jukes
---
Mmhm
---
I figure he’s not a hard one to balance
---
Getting WB on board would be tricky but if you got the rights
---
Dude
---
Add one or the old mansions as a realm
---
And add maybe the Black Knight the chain rattling ghost or the phantom cosmonaut as a killer
---
I’d shell out 20 bucks
---
She does
---
And brutal strength becomes amazing
---
Thanks! I've had my share of games where people with more play time than me spend half of the game hiding in tool sheds and not bothering with anything objective-wise
---
Or, when you don't like a perk, try explaining why you think it's unbalanced and maybe it will gain traction and get balanced.
---

---
In the temporary ban section right under Griefing: Intentional Gameplay Abuse: "Working with the opposite team to gain an advantage or grief teammates"
---
Does Fire Up stack with things like Brutal Strength and Bamboozle?
---
As a killer main, I support this perk. Seriously though. No.
---
At loops, exploit Carters Spark as it disables most actions for 2.5 seconds, this is includes vaulting and throwing pallets. Also, the 3 gen strat is boring and lasts so long.
---
Why is nobody working on these generators?
---
You use the power to stop chases early. If you zap them at the right time you'll be able to wack them before they can jump a window/pallet as it momentarily hinders them from vaulting. The timing is hard at first though. I suggest watching some streamers playing him.
---
Wut
---
this meme format is literally perfect for this sub. Good meme!
---
Yes, give the trolls the attention they want by insulting them, which only adds fuel too the fire. You can’t go in guns blazing and expect anything good from it. OP should of just reported him, blocked him, and move on.
---
This.
---
Your friend being that mean to you over a video game? Get new friends.
---
This is 100% how I feel. I want to play Killer but I end up playing survivor way more
---
ah this happened to me as spirit one time but nea’s head was staring at me through the chest lid
---
Shock shock shock hit repeat and a few laughs inbetween
---
Spirit is underage.
---
Survivors should have to pass an intelligence test before playing. Downvotes incoming.
---
You have too contact BHVR support with evidence for action too be taken. Reporting people in game “allegedly” tells then too look into it but going through support makes it go faster.
---
Weird Al survivor when?
---
2017 halloween, Clown, and Legion are the best. So much love put into those themes.
---
I’m not to into the fact that you can only play the Riders for a month and they get swapped. You could spend so much effort and BP learning them only to get a fresh new start every time. Also, sorry to be that guy but *survivor
---
Don’t rely on black wards. They don’t work half the time.
---
Honestly the only killer I can play without feeling so stressed is nurse, but even then I sometimes prefer playing survivor even if i'm in a killer playing mood
---
Car.
---
After rewatching the series again, I really wish we could get the tv show costume as a cosmetic
---
Because rank 20s don’t know how too look at him, so they have too complain and nerf him too be on par with them.
---
Wolf in Sheep's would only work on killers with low terror Radius maybe
---
Don't "lose" (lol) Your Pray is really killer specific as you said, maybe a bamboozle nurse would benefit from it XDD. but i think changing that teachable wouldn't be a bad ideia, i'll try thinking of something for it
---
Also thanks for the evaluation &lt;3, i was more worried about his power, but since it's fine (beeing countered by gen rush just the way i wanted) i'm happy about it
---
Nice thing about fiber optic is I'm only down for 5 seconds max and can just re queue
---
You can. Just not the best way to handle it because then they know you're really tilted, which is exactly what the killer wanted. Gotta deny them that feeling of accomplishment by not responding or having a casual "oh well don't care" attitude
---
as a killer main i welcome hate messages it tells you "you did good"
---
I think it would be cool for the horsemen to be cosmetics for different killers
---
Well after reading that wall of dumb text. Shadowborn and monitor are gonna help allot get those. Keep running sloppy because its good. Haunted needs another hex totem or high ranks will leave it alone so run ruin or lullaby. I would say some other perks but....half of mastering nurse is knowimg what perks you work best with.
---
Play them all. I main Freddy but I always rotate through all my killers. It gives you great insite when fighting them as survivor. Out of them all, Ghostface is your best bet since he’s pretty viable at red ranks.
---
I hate swamp on both sides, it’s such an ugly map.
---
How many training wheels do survivors need? ffs.
---
Oink oink
---
Honestly I'm ok with messages such as 'git gud' or 'ez' but some survivors start getting personal sometimes and it gets uncomfortable
---
He smashes survivors' heads with his feet, cuts off their fingers and sucks them... I'm horrified what is brutal for you
---
"You're hacking! There's no way you saw me go in there. -rep for hacking"

Hex ruin dafaq
---
It says that it’s the mid chapter skins on the reveal on the forums, so that’s probably when they will be released.
---
BBQ, nurse's, deerstalker, bitter murmur
---
It actually implies it eould kill the game by punishing a vast majority of players for something which could be out of their control, and would dissuade new players from coming in. It's a bad idea and has never worked for any game that has ever tried it. There is a ping indicator in the lobby, if you don't like the ping you can leave.
---
And suck a lime. Together our saliva will make a new sprite flavor.
---
They will be purple quality. They change too much too be green. And expect them too cost auric cells.
---
Low level is using him to find survivors and farm points. Tier 3 isn't consistently useful.
---
High level is to counter loops with the shock, but even if you did that perfectly he would still be mid-tier.
---
Oh yeah because it's the survivors fault the killer got stuck in a pallet...
---
The Wraith, innocent man trying to find a better life tricked into assisting with murders. Forced to kill by The Entity.   I like lores of those forced to kill rather than  those who already had the killer instinct.
---
He wanted me to tell you he said “Thank you!”
---
Then you weren't ment to kill them..
---
You should safety pip, it's just a bug
---
Not leaving the gen when Spine Chill activates to confuse your teammates
---
Same goes for the shitty survivors I run into that DC
---
I want to play Ghostface so bad but I always overthink and get stressed out
---
Shit on the game, don't shit on players. I fuckin' hate playing against adrenaline and shit but like ... it's such a good skill I'm not gonna blame the survivors for using it.
---
It's written on his abs
---
It’s best to play the week after rank reset am I right boys
---
With hitboxes how they currently are, I'm surprised both that swing and chainsaw missed you. Both times clearly looked like they connected. I'm not trying to say you didnt do a good job, I just think that was a lot of luck.
---
I really wanna have fun with ghostface but it's just another M1 killer that gets easily looped : / (though getting rid of the red stain with the stealth does help a little bit I guess)
---
That's just reddit for ya

I mean if we are going crazy with license costs then...
---
McClane from die hard
---
Yippie-Ki-Yay, Motherfucker!
---
I'm a terrible survivor (kind of) but I can look and 360 (again kind of) I just don't play survivor enough to get out of yellow
---
Smashing a head with just your feet seems really brutal for me, but that may be subjective :D Imagine feeling a skull crashing under your feet
---
What if you wanted to cleanse Hex:ruin but jah said Hex:haunted ground
---
As survivor main your 100% correct. Its not like survivor is super easy, but Killer has been on his game to win. A survivor can sit in a locker most match and escape.
---
Not really horror but why not
---
Nah survivors find totem in like a minute
---
Another luck based perk
---
This issue barely stretches both ways. If one Survivior DCs you can still at least black pip. If a killer DCs then all 4 Surviviors can depip
---
This reply is lame and wrong
---
Farthest I’ve been was purple in survivor but I’m boosted lmfao. I’m a purple killer aswell but I earned that shit.
---
Like its been stated many time before.. There are unfun perks and addons on both sides. And there is no doubt in my mind that we have all used unfun mechanics in the past.. Because what might feel fun to you, might not be to the others. And I may be wrong, but I doubt you'd call out survivors, if they were using unfun addons too. 
---
Now, saying that you roasting people is your moral imperative, is just completely silly, and egotistical. No "well-adjusted person" would use this reasoning in a situation like this. It's a game.. Not real life. Its not you "trying to throw them a bone." It's you trying to get others to conform to your idea of fun. People need to realise that their way is not the only way. Once we all get past that, we'll all have a less stressful time playing. (You know.. Unless both sides agree to never use unfun mechanics. Which we all know, that won't happen.)
---
Regardless of our obvious disagreement on the subject, I hope you have fun in your future games.
---
How?
---
Ok but what perk do I swap shadow born with?
---
Thx fella
---
Probably thanta
---
Ok nice I have 15 on ghost face and was scared I would lose them
---
This reply is weak and shows you can't fault the logic of it, because you know it's true but you have a complex and cling fervently to being right all the time. 
---
You're wrong, it's a bad idea and never will be added. \*sips Sprite*
---
Just cause people rage doesn't mean you shouldn't use it. Never let the opposing side dictate what perks you can use. Just turn off end game chat or just leave as soon as you hit the end game tally screen
---
"Nice" play
---
I don’t know, I was honestly trying to help by providing a solution. I literally fixed my PS4 the other week by applying this method.
---
I know it's just a bug. but is a bug that should be fixed as soon as possible. but devs are too busy at making new skins and releasing new dlcs.
---
From a doc main, I walk around in treatment mode you'll find people pretty quickly that way.  Then zap 3 or 4 times to get them in tier 3.  Other than that your just a m1 killer with, unless you know how to time your zaps at loops.  One of my favorite addons are the electrodes, but they're kind of a detriment when it comes to looping, but zapping someone from across the map... mmm
---
spirit with the addon that makes her ability not make sound + the addon that makes her see the bloodtrails, makes her the stronger killer in the game no cap.
---
 Yea in my opinion survivor can be hard if you're up against a good killer , but I've had matches where I didn't get into any chases (and I dont play immersed , but I don't get into chases if I dont have to)
---
 A killer doesn't have the luxury of having matches where he isn't almost 100% focused
---
 I think it's also why there aren't so many killer streamers/youtubers , as it's hard to talk and play killer at the same time (and by talk I mean read chat , answer questions, etc , not just say exactly what you're thinking about a chase)
---
Ooooh, you cant bring that
---
Yes omg when we all came in at the end of the summer BBQ event and bopped to clown music
---
Well the matching making is a fucking joke first of all. Don't worry about it just get better. A few tips to help is break every pallet that the survivors drop no matter what. They can't loop you at that pallet and you set up for late game the more you break.
---
If you feel like your getting looped for too long move on and keep checking the gens it's not worth it. Sometimes it's better to justdown a survivor and try and get a second one if you know where he is. That's two down not doing gens and if it's safe you can hook them. The best perks for killer are BBQ and hex ruin. Those two alone will help you tremendously as a killer
---
That is very true. People just mend, it takes about 10 seconds and then they're back. Idk what they could do to it though.
---
No problem! *tea bags in distance*
---
You can't bring that, unless it's a diesel car, or a damaged car, or a Dare Devil's car
---
They aren't a AAA team, I'm sure you know but try reporting it to the forums it should be seen there.  If enough people report it they'll start fixing it sooner
---
I use Bbq, Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel and Thanatophobia.
---
Where the hell in this spot did OP mention using prayer beads? Do you assume that every spirit ever uses Prayer beads?
---
Thank you! I try and do all that and I’m still learning how to mind game. I just got bbq as a teachable today so hopefully once I level my killers I can actually enjoy it a little more. Thank you for the advice I really appreciate it
---
Hey dude, you did a bodyblock in a chase. That's good shit.
---
No I agree, Tbh most streamers that are survivor mains seem to only play SWF or just play very weak killer ranks, IMO.
---
Dear stalker
---
Its only toxic if you are trying to be toxic.
---
Hmm, from purple flashlight borrowed time sprintburst decisive strike nea to a 0, I’ll give you an 8.

yes it does

Just checked and I'm at 11 and a half hours. I made a post asking for tips like a week and a half ago and got a ton of good info from the community here and that's helped me get a jump start into the game
---
that's what I'm talking about
---
One DC as a Survivior and they lose one.
---
Like I had kinda said, this issue disproportionately affects Surviviors more :/ any kind of DC is bad for Surviviors, that's not always true for killers

I... I guess I'd bring a big book of scary campfire stories.

Put whispers instead of nurse
---
I want to be a survivor I a mode where I just watch the killers try to get each other
---
For killer I would say Ds is my main annoyance. Not that it’s a bad perk by any means it’s just like. ... oh darn.
---
For survivor I hate going against iron grasp or nurses calling
---
That's not what objective means.
---
Dying Light has been the center of controversy whenever it's brought up. Yes it's a toxic perk. It encourages tunnelling and to me, it's the reason D strike should be available more than once.
---
Dont care
---
Teach her of Bunny Feng
---
Elementary, my dear Digger.
---
Rin in her backstory had a shit ton of glass in her body from either being yeeted by her dad or from her jumping through it, idk.  The snake Pokemon you see is a spirit colored Ekans, or Snake spelled backward.  Inside the Ekans of this drawing are glass shards.  Glass has a special reflective property where say you were to hold a message to a mirror, the message would appear backwards.  I deduced the Ekans was Spirit by both color and the oddly placed glass and by the fact that Huntress is a Cubone, who as you know, wears his mothers skull on his head, similar to how hundreds never recovered from losing her mom at a young age, thus is also fucked in the head.  So if Huntrezs is the mentally dysfunctional cubone, then obviously OP put some thought into which Pokemon she wanted each killer to represent.
---
I had a point, but I lost it.
---
Basically, I have no idea and should probably stop smoking so much lol
---
Venomoth is Bug/Poison, not flying you cretin!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Some people are just rude like that. If you ever have questions, ask me or anyone else here! &lt;3
---
Slugging is downing someone, then leaving them there for a bit without hooking them while you go after other survivors. I’m not sure why anyone thought that was toxic, though. It’s a valid strategy that a lot of people use.
---
Ok so, when a match first starts, you should NEVER just start working on that lit totem the moment you see it if you spawned near it. 80% of the time, killers will beeline right for their totem(s) to check them as soon as the game starts. I always crouch off and wait for about 30 or 40 seconds, and once I see the killer patrol away, I start working on it.
---
I actually very often find totems right at the start of the match by FOLLOWING killers to the first area they run to.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
My pals and I are killer mains. We play SWF and just bully killers. Then we go into KYF and are reminded why we Nurse mains are the scum of the earth
---
If you want Merciless as GF you can't use your ability because you're not gonna get more than silver in the chaser emblem when instadowning everyone. Plague can't get better chaser if survivors don't cleanse, Billy and LF can't if they use their chainsaws etc. Have fun!
---
I'm clefraith
---
Machoke is perfect for Myers.
---
Then why did you try to use the word?
---
Remember that you will have to hold that for eternity
---
I meant this all as a separate mode forget that to mention, sorry. I think they all should get unlocked with challenges that come up every week after the event is over you can still unlock them but with aura cells or shards. One week it's against War the next is against Pestilence... And after that there public like the Survivors.
---
Dude we don't need buffs.  I've destroyed countless sweat squad swf groups.  Just rise to the challenge and play harder.  For every good swf group you face you'll get like 4 potato squads anyways.
---
Amazing
---
Replace dying light with lullaby and you got insta dc's
---
Good perk if you can kill the obsession before 3 gens are done. I don't like how you need to proc it though.
---
Don't worry, everyone here only wants to fuck Myers, Trapper, and Huntress.

Good to see a post about youth enjoying this game without people flocking to it and bombarding you with “is she old enough” questions. I hope she enjoys the game as much as I have for three years.

Wanted  to

Sure, have fun.

Think what you want it's not the killer
---
Hag, cause I never crouch
---
It is only the Kanto pokemon though. I would also like to see someone do this with the other pokemon generations.
---
Upvoted because jojo
---
*Sad Huntress noises*
---
As someone that used to be a heavy F13 player those voice comms while humorous in that game would be maddening in dbd lol.  Killer dc rates would skyrocket.  No killer wants to listen to me as I loop them for 3 gens lol.
---
Hey hey hey shhhsssh ssssh shhh.

It was on purpose. *Right?*

---
On high volume and listening hard, I could only barely hear his breathing. Pretty difficult to hear it behind Nea's breathing and the ambient music.
---
For Survivors : 
---
Adrenaline : I think the huge movement speed buff is a bit much. 
---
Dead Hard : I play a good deal of Trapper so this one is pretty self explanatory. Gotta respect it when someone pulls off a clutch DH play though. 
---
(I cant really think of a third perk for survivors.)
---
For Killers :
---
NOED : Not denying its effectiveness or viability. I just think its kinda scummy. To each their own though.
---
Insidious : My first time ever playing this game I went for a basement unhook. As soon as I started the animation there was a chainsaw up my ass. I've held a special grudge ever since.
---
Make Your Choice : Again, not denying effectiveness of viability, but damn does it make my altruism hard.
---
Not saying any of these perks are bad. Just ones that I don't like facing.
---
They broke sounds a bit ago, I think around back in December, and part of the Ghostface patch was finally fixing that. You might just need to re-adjust to the new sounds? I don't know if they messed with killer breathing so much as they just fixed a lot of the other sounds.
---
killer main so ds is every killer death and borrowed time
---
I mean I want more then just new moris, but it'd be a nice thing to add to the list of stuff BHVR will probably never fix
---
There's no real counterplay in the current meta since being immersed isn't consistent. 
---
And yeah, if killers get to bully soloq Surviviors with Facecamping, Noed, Tunnelling, etc. Then it's fair game to bully back. I see no issue. 
---
Good killers don't get genrushed, change my mind.
---
If I see a 4 man swf all with toolboxes and I don't have Franklin's you bet your butt I'm running NOED no regrets, no surrender, no crying
---
im surprised you didnt say noed
---
The only useless survivor perk is Up the Ante because Luck only works for Kobe Unhooks and Trapper Bear Trap escapes. Even with Slippery Meat and 4 Jars Of Salty Lips, Deliverance is still better in every aspect.
---
NYYEEEH *STAB*
---
A fun one to do is Hide and Shank. 1 person is Ghostface while the others are Survivors trying to hide from him. The person playing Ghostface can only down someone if they're exposed or yanked from a locker. Last man standing wins.
---
Normally it's best to not cleanse any totems at the start of the match unless you know what the totem is. Just go do a nearby gen and if no ruin, don't touch the totem. Simple. If you believe it to be devour hope, you're able to wait a hook or 2
---
That Ghost Face is hot af
---
Spend the BP on an Ebony? Use it. Not like you get to use it every match anyway.
---
It’s good. Useful vs most killers and in some cases the difference between getting gen grabbed by Spirit or not.
---
Yeah I really do, i get too into the chase and just start swinging. I was getting good at avoiding jukes, but then I didnt play legion for a bit because I prestidged her, and now I'm out of practice and salty lol. I just gotta calm down and think during chases. Thanks for the helpful response :)
---
You’re a nurse main so obviously you can’t relate
---
F
---
Well Tapp would die first...
---
The not worth it part I understand but never "feel dirty" for using a perk like noed. That's just asshole survivors making you feel guilty cause they're too lazy to cleanse all the totems
---
Ayyy.
---
Certain maps you really can’t do much against a good nurse. Your logic still doesn’t make sense. Just because some killers play scummy doesn’t mean all killers deserve to be bullied. Does that make sense?

There’s no such thing as a “good” leatherface for example. Sure, one can mindgame and have a solid perk build but that only does so much against good survivors. Mind games won’t work against the best. Gens still can get done in mere min and some teams don’t even care about ruin; they work right through it. A killer like LF has no way to stop loops and he has average mobility around the map. Get it?
---
Survivors will call almost anything toxic because that’s the popular buzzword of this game. It’s best to just ignore that. 
---
Just don’t BM or hold a game hostage and you’re fine.
---
Nope. I can't. Sorry is "genrushing" some kind of peasant joke that I don't understand? Bc in my stint as a Wraith main getting to rank 4 I never noticed genrushing.

I mean yes, but I honestly don’t see it as much in the higher ranks. I see ruin/nurses/bbq more. It just depends
---
Running away when spine chill activates just to realize the killer never ended up coming your way
---
i was the first he found, hooked me, camped me when i got unhooked chased me even though people body blocked and he’d hit them but continue to chase me, hooked and camped again then unhooked waited for me to get off the hook to hit me but didn’t know i had adrenaline then chased me again
---
I’d also recommend watching streamers playing this game, like - Zubatlel, ScottJund, Fungoose and (Monto on youtube)
---
Stay away from tru3ta1ent, a lot of people worship him like a god but fail to see that he promotes A LOT of toxicity in this game, he constantly complains and whines and is just not that good. A lot of new players start watching him and then go into a downward spiral and start taking this game too seriously. Rant over lol
---
I just see normal gameplay here.
---
I swap to Plague to listen to her talk while I wait.
---
We need to pick a day a famous horror movie came out that has one of these circles and in that day killers shouldn't be aloud to cross the salt or they could pretend to for the laughs
---
Run corrupt intervention, Ruin, BBQ, and another anti gen perk then. Jeez if you guys suffer so much from genrushing Surviviors just build against it lol. You can slow down the game a decent amount with the anti gen perks we have today. 
---
I agree gens need slowed down, but the proposals I've seen are on par with the idea that Surviviors should all spawn in on death hook with no mither.
---
I dont think that many players have genuinely awful internet. Its just enough that a string of bad luck with who you get matched with makes for a shitty time

Ruin can be broken. Bbq is not an anti gen perk. The only other one that’s truly good is pop but even then you have to get downs fast which is tough with a mid to low tier killer..

Lol had one yesterday.  Had 2 Clown dailies which sucked because I despise playing Clown.  I don't like his kit, I don't enjoy playing him and I'm simply not good with him.
---
I got a 4 man SWF playing a Coldwind offering lol.  I had all 4 in injured state with 1 gen left.  One of them managed to pop it into a 4 man Adrenaline lol!  I started laughing.  I managed to get one of them hooked end game.  The obsession ate a sacrifice down to free his friend.  I hooked him and the other 3 bounced.  I walked away waiting for game to end, and the motherfucker kobed lol.  All good I saw him heading towards exit.  Swing he dead hards, all good get him down in the exit gate.  Picked him up, decisive lol!  He's out.  
---
Honestly the key to enjoying killer is finding the humor in situations like that.  I wasn't salty thought it was funny.  I redeemed myself with the following 3 games all 4ks with Freddy and Legion with the final being a 32000 perfect game.
---
Maybe he already is?
---
Lol, nice.  Wish I had fios here.  I was shocked that we have 500mb cable though.  And it actually hits that.  Couple years ago, all I could get was 3mbps dsl, so even normal cable would've been a huge upgrade.  And yeah, a petty dos attack won't work very well if the attack has shittier internet than the victim :)
---
Why is NOED regarded as Free kills when many other instadown perks/builds exist.
---
Laurie maybe
---
Thats definetly not a haiku.
---
An episode of breaking bad if you’re searching as killer
---
Just leave the lobby. Immediately. If I had a bad game as killer and the survivors were being assholes about it in-game, I have no interest in seeing what they have to say.
---
Video proff is easy on console, there is a recording feature , sure I will try it the next time it happens. Thank you
---
I never said any of the perks were OP, just annoying and I really don't see why the tier 1 perks should have basically the same affect as tier 2 and 3. What is the point of even having tiers then? I didn't forget about NOED not being a hex perk. That nerf I believe was necessary. The DS rework was necessary. It makes sense that survivors shouldn't recover from exhaustion while running. Leave killers alone? Ok, can we leave survivors alone then? I don't see why one side should get a buff while the other gets a nerf in the same update. It's literally every update. Do you only play killer? It sounds like you don't see the other side pov whatsoever.
---
WIll the event cakes stay after july the 2nd?
---
You laugh, but it works.
---
It always works
---
Will you still be able to use the event cakes you have after they are no longer obtainable July 2nd?
---
If level 3 perks are inevitable, why make the level 1 version of it basically the same? It just doesn't make sense.
---
Is this even common knowledge, or often posted? I check this subreddit at least once a week, and this is the first I've seen this.
---
I've actually been watching a decent amount of Monto and Noob3!
---
You couldn’t blink out?
---
&gt;  hit/downed or unhooking in front of the killer giving free second chances for bad play
---
Killers camp so often though
---
Legit out of the many killer games I've played over the last few weeks, I've been hit with DS once and borrowed time like 2 times.
---
&gt;They all provide a free escape when unhooking and the exit is open and the killer can’t do anything about it
---
Well they absolutely can
---
&gt;A bad killer with NoeD still has to find and hit up to 4 people
---
They don't usually, they hover around hook, totem, exit gates, and just down the guy going for the save and see if they can smack the person who was rescued.
---
&gt;All I’m saying is these perks all have their uses and newer players who feel they need these powerful effects shouldn’t be put down for it.
---
You do understand why it cultivates massive amounts of disdain in the community though
---
If only they could this without breaking the game
---
and the worst of all is that they surely use dead hard, adrenaline, self care and ds
---
If he used a locker to mori him it would be so much better
---
Yeah I’m gonna have to agree

nothing scares me more than a prayer beads Spirit or a triggered phantasm trap

Pretty sure it's rank decay, like Overwatch then, i've never been that high though. Or maybe it's just the bad servers.

I second Haggie. I do try to crouch but then here comes a teammate running past me at the speed of light and *I'm* the one that gets the cheeks clapped. Ugh.
---
As much as I love this idea, I feel like they wouldn’t be able to put it back to normal after the fact
---
This is close to the doctor build I use; Lullaby, Distressing, Overcharge, Unnerving. I don't use noed for this build because 8/10 times survivors either give up on playing entirely or just d/c.
---
Still probably my favorite thing I've ever done in the game is because of Deliverance + New Decisive + Balanced Landing + Borrowed Time:    
---
* Killer is Billy
---
* GF is hooked nearby and struggling on other side of hill
---
* Billy hooks me right by open exit gate
---
* Billy starts zooming around, celebrating early
---
* Deliverance off hook
---
* Billy sprints over to exit gate to try and prevent me from leaving
---
* I run the opposite way, over the hill, Balanced Landing to GF
---
* Billy sees I'm not there and rushes back to the hook
---
* Unhook the GF just inside Borrowed Time range
---
* Follow her and am body blocking her exit
---
* Billy goes to hit her instead of Broken me
---
* BT sends her flying towards the open gate, she escapes
---
* Billy catches me just inside the exit gates, maybe 2 meters from freedom
---
* Billy picks me up
---
* Hit the sweetest DS I've ever hit
---
* Killer leaves endgame chat faster than anyone in the history of DBD    
---
    
---
I kinda felt bad for him but I've never had another situation where I needed all 4 perks in quick succession to save the game like that since or before.  You never want to win the game *just* because perks, but I'd be lying if I said I didn't feel insanely proud of this play, especially since he was a Ruin/BBQ/Enduring/Spirit Fury Billy.  BTW, before I get crucified, this is most of my tryhard build that I break out only once I've been getting bodied all day.
---
Shhhhh she will never know
---
Swinging his weapon already cancels his stealth.
---
&gt; They're staples for eliminating pressure. 2 of those can be solved by not tunnelling 
---
Are you trolling?   
---
"You counter DS/BT by just not killing the person and leaving them to be to fully recover."  
---
...And even then DS will still be active on their next unhook. Same with BT.  
---
You don't solve the issue as killer. You just pick the lesser of two evils.  
---
Also if the game is allready in the end-game phase, this isn't a viable option either.  
---
&gt; and the last can be solved by simply being gud 
---
&gt; BT, DS, and Adrenaline at least take work and conditions to utilize 
---
Oh I see. You are trolling. GG, you got me.
---
Adrenaline: Last gen pops. \*BOOP\* Adrenaline!
---
DS: You got downed. Hit the easy skill check. \*BOOP\* 5 second Stun!  
---
BT: Unhook while the killer is near. \*BOOP\* +1 life!
---
\---  
---
NOED: IF there is atleast one dull totem remaining, it will become a hex totem.
---
It might give you a bonus, but even now people can cleanse the hex and deactive the perk after activating.  
---
Then you still have to find, chase, hit/down and carry the guy to the hook. (Who probably still can be unhooked after that).
---
All of this has to happen while the survivors have the possibility to escape, since NOED doesnt activate before the last gen is done.  
---
&gt;  
---
 NOED facilitates bad performance 
---
Bad perfomance? Only because the perk is late game oriented?  
---
What about Blood Warden? 
---
Remember Me?  
---
What about perks that reward you as killer whenever a gen is getting done like Bitter Murmer?   
---
What about 3-Gen strats and builds involving Overcharge?
---
Same with the survivor side. Perks like Hope also affect the late-game.  
---
And it's completely fine.
---
The killer hasn't lost yet. So the perk isn't "rewarding you while losing".
---
&gt; a boring game for everyone involved   
---
Not for the killer that runs the perk?
---
Killer is more stressful in general, and survivor is more annoying in general. A lot of things are out of your control as a survivor, and losing to things that are out of your control can be annoying. As a killer, you have more control than any single survivor, but obviously also more things to keep in mind.
---
I find playing killer more relaxing than playing survivor a lot of the time, precisely because I can constantly be engaged in and concentrated on playing, get into a cognitive state of "flow", whereas as survivor I have more downtime to think about things that are not related to the game and take me out of the game, as well as observe all the stuff my "team" does wrong, rounds falling apart due to it, gowing ever-more mildly irritated.
---
The thing I enjoy most about this game however is the chase gameplay, and I find that to be equally enjoyable, engaging as well as relaxing on both sides. And as long as I have good chases, I don't really mind much of whatever else happens in the rounds, regardless of the side I'm playing.
---
Killer queue times kind of kill my enjoyment of playing killer though. If you are invested into rounds with 10+ minutes of waiting (and potential - though now admittedly rare - bugged lobbies, as well as people crashing during load), stuff that is not enjoable in those rounds is extra demotivating. Then again, the long killer queue times must also be caused by not enough people playing survivor, proportionately, so people in general must be enjoying killer quite a bit, too.
---
What is the best way to learn how to win chases as a survivor? Also what are some good perks for doing so?
---
But it is?
---
Spirit's all in the tracking, don't put too much thought into the mindgame aspect of her, that'll come with time.
---
Yellow and rarer activation time add-ons are good, as are movement speed (combining the yellow one with green movement speed is my favorite combo). Duration add-ons are good as well. Post-phase movement add-ons are useful if you know how to get the most out of them. Amulet and Prayer Beads = GG.
---
As for builds, I run Ruin, Nurse's, Pop Goes the Weasel, and BBQ. Sometimes I swap Nurse's for Whispers and Pop for Save the Best for Last. And sometimes I go with no Ruin if I want more of a challenge. You could also do the Russian roulette build (all totems: Ruin, Devour, Thrill, Haunted). Really a lot of perks are viable on her, just gotta find what works for you.
---
Oh my god that ending! You more than redeemed yourself though with a 4K with Freddy. That’s an accomplishment.
---
Well said friend
---
you did 210*(1+ 0.45), I did 210/(1 - 0.45). I did that this way, because it doesn't seem like efficiency increases the amount of charges, it makes one charge last for longer
---
Why are the perk icons so weird?
---
Yea, that happens if the survivor is an idiot.
---
that is why i ignore them. usually i never see a survivor near when i do check, so i just gave up since usually afterwards they get the totem. Now it seems my devour hope lasts the whoooollllle game alot more often now lmao
---
first time ive seen this as well, so yeah... dont be such a dick
---
Nothing really, you did pretty well here
---
What are iridescent shards good for? Is it best to use them on perks? If you buy a perk with iridescent shards, is it usable for all characters?
---
It didn’t specify they all had to be Kanto, they just so happen to be kanto
---
relatable
---
Honestly man he's my favorite killer to play these days.  I've got a playstyle that is very effective with him and he's just a lot of fun to play as for me.  I'm actually a little worried about his upcoming rework because it will completely destroy how I play him and it'll be back to square one figuring him out
---
Brings back memories of being a rank 20 with my friends after the ps plus deal
---
Don't worry, I too have faith in this sub and I doubt anyone will be weird over such a wholesome post. :)
---
They look terrible, right? Unfortunately, loads of people think the coloured perk icon pack is the best thing to be invented since sliced bread.
---
Can you see auras while haunting?
---
Please let this become the new respect the 4%, just without the salt when the killer decides to forego formalities
---
Its custom icons.
---
&gt; Are you trolling?
---
I'm dead serious. Everyone at high ranks knows the counters and plays around them no problem.
---
&gt;Also if the game is allready in the end-game phase, this isn't a viable option either.
---
Then don't let it get to endgame as killer- a very simple solution.
---
&gt;Adrenaline: Last gen pops. *BOOP* Adrenaline!
---
Yup. You let survivors do gens, or they risked not getting healed/ doing risky unsafe gens for a collective 8+ minutes hitting skillchecks, and once they finally reach their basic win condition they get the boost.
---
Pre-nerf MoM is closer to an equivalent crutch perk if you want to grasp at straws.
---
&gt;DS: You got downed. Hit the easy skill check. *BOOP* 5 second Stun!
---
People also hop in lockers for killers to bait into opening, then have DS proc. Simple solution is to slug people with DS proc'd or ignore the ones which hop in lockers- or third option: eat the damn DS.
---
&gt;Unhook while the killer is near. *BOOP* +1 life!
---
Hit the unhooker. More efficient to play that way to begin with.
---
&gt;NOED: IF there is atleast one dull totem remaining, it will become a hex totem.
---
&gt;It might give you a bonus, but even now people can cleanse the hex and deactive the perk after activating.
---
&gt;All of this has to happen while the survivors have the possibility to escape, since NOED doesnt activate before the last gen is done.
---
This explains why it isn't a strong perk. I never said it's a strong perk. I said it's a shitty perk that enables and facilitates lame gameplay and interaction.
---
With survivor perks you at least have to call out their bluffs or respect it. Not to mention killer is pretty god damn strong in these latest versions, so it's not like survivors have too much to work with besides map rng and their perks.
---
&gt;Bad perfomance? Only because the perk is late game oriented?
---
Blood warden is late game orientated. But it still only becomes a viable perk when gens are done. I've watched several non killer mains try out "toxic endgame builds" but for 5 matches in a row "accidentally" end up 4k'ing everone. At rank 1. On killers like Hag, Pig, or Wraith.
---
&gt;Remember Me?
---
&gt;What about perks that reward you as killer whenever a gen is getting done like Bitter Murmer?
---
&gt;What about 3-Gen strats and builds involving Overcharge?
---
You're literally just naming perks and strategies that involve some level of set up/ condition to meet and a playstyle that adapts to it. You can't say the same about NOED, unless you're literally sitting back and going "Go on survivor. Finish that last gen. Let's see what happens."
---
&gt;Not for the killer that runs the perk?
---
If you're a killer who gets traction out of NOED, you're probably having boring matches. 5 gens being popped means you fucking struggled or fucked up HARD during the match, depending on map.
---
Typical Bond gamer
---
I understand why new players run NOED, but if you are a rank 20 killer you're probably going against new survivors as well who will get killed to NOED because they haven't learned the game yet. There's no problem with running any perk. The issue I have is when i'm in green or purple ranks and I see NOED pop up it's just like ugh. You clearly have enough experience in the game and you really need NOED? Especially when it's used on a killer that can already one hit down you. You are fine, learn the game and ignore the salt.
---
That is totally understandable. I think you will be able to figure it out though if you are already that good with him now.
---
Don't quit your day job
---
He was carrying someone
---

---
discord
---
Huh, had no idea something like that exists. Guess it was worthy a downvote though
---
now, not even an ebony mori will guarantee the 4k...(actually pretty weird thing, i guess the moris are now counterable)
---
That's my point though. Is that if adrenaline isn't bullshit than noed isn't bullshit because its built to counter that. That's why you might see a lot of killers running noed. Because almost every survivor is running adrenaline.
---
In terms of not liking killer I'm just making a point when I say chasing someone and hitting them twice isn't fun. If noed is bullshit then x, y, and z is bullshit too.
---
&gt; and I really don't see why the tier 1 perks should have basically the same affect as tier 2 and 3. 
---
It's so these perks aren't useless on tier 1 and 2.  
---
Technically speaking it is a buff, but since the perk is basically untouched on tier 3 it's pretty weird referring to it as one.  
---
&gt; What is the point of even having tiers then? 
---
They are still worse on tier 1 and 2.
---
&gt; I didn't forget about NOED not being a hex perk. That nerf I believe was necessary. 
---
Yes it was. Even killers agree with it. I mentioned it because you were talking about "Survivor perks getting nerfed while killer perks doesn't." ... which is just false. Because Noed was nerfed into a hex perk.  
---
&gt;Do you only play killer? It sounds like you don't see the other side pov whatsoever. 
---
I play both sides. Arround 60% killer 40% survivor. So yes, I would call myself a killer main.  
---
But no, I don't only play killer.  
---
&gt; Leave killers alone? Ok, can we leave survivors alone then? I don't see why one side should get a buff while the other gets a nerf in the same update.  
---
"Do you only play survivor? Because it sounds like you dont see the other pov whatsover."
---
Killers NEED the buff. If you try to play anything besides Nurse, Spirit or Billy on higher ranks this game becomes a stressfull bullyfest for killers.  
---
People with 3k hours in this game usually share this opinion.  
---
A survivor is able to make way more mistakes and win. It's generally a calm and chill experience playing survivor.  
---
Killer? You have to play optimally and even then you might only get a few kills.  
---
&gt; It's literally every update. 
---
Yes, after being completely survivor sides for years, infinite loops, overpowered survivor perks, fat-shaming spots, no killer being viable at all, every killer animation like vaulting/picking someone up taking ages, 30+ pallets per map, vacuums and a lot more ... they are finally fixing the game.  
---
After them starting to nerf survivors for the last ... few months? The game is as balanced as it was never before.  
---
Survivors are still the power role but playing killer and winning isn't impossible like it was in the "dark times".
---
Ohhh my b
---
I dont see any joke... this always happen in the endgame chat and in pallet loop
---
OHMYGOD IS THAT BILL JUST SITTING THERE IN FRONT JUST LIKE "WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ON HERE???" ??????
---
I had a survivor shit on me when I hit him after a kobe, and the only reason he gave me a "free pass" for hitting him (his words) was because I was new at the game.
---
Necronomicon Ex Mortis
---
Granted if all you do is stand there then yes, that's camping.
---
Chasing someone near the hook though. Well it's on them to not be a moron and do loops around the hook.
---
Bad day?
---
I guess that means it never happens!
---
A lot of killers may find it to be a necessity because almost all survivors run adrenaline. And it's the only thing that essentially counters it.
---
YEAH FUCK NEWBIES HOW DARE THEY BE NEW
---
What in that whole comment made him sound like a salty survivor main? He was actually the complete opposite.
---
No, great day actually :)
---
Yeah it's like what's the point of staring at him if he's still going to be able to expose you.
---
Refering to NOED as an overpowered noob crutch perk is usually a response coming from survivors who get emotional about NOED.
---
PLEASE DEVS MAKE THIS HAPPEN AND MAKE EVERY KILLER HAVE UNIQE SONG

Truly a pants-shitting moment. I recently started playing again and hadn't faced the Pig.

Fellow Feng main! My preferred solo que loadout is Urban, self-care, Spinechill and an exhaustion perk. Good luck to her
---
No, I'm tier III with all the perks and was NOED.  Its ok to boo me.
---
And wore an upside down sombrero.
---
And as a surv I would have no problem with killers running it for just the points. Problem is it also has the aura wall hacks part of it which is total bullshit lol
---
&gt; Then don't let it get to endgame as killer- a very simple solution.   
---
&gt; Yup. You let survivors do gens 
---
Your argument to counter the strong survivor perks is literally:  
---
"Just ged gud and kill them before the game finishes, so you don't have to care about their perks."
---
If you aren't trolling this just baffles me.
---
I don't see any reason to continue this discussion if that's your pov.  
---
Have a nice evening.
---
LPT: stop caring about pips.
---
Honestly loved the christmas theme the most. Makes me wish so bad krampus was a character...
---
My keyboard smells like Corona for the same reason.
---
In my personal opinion it's better to buy the characters rather then buy individual perks but it is completely up to you how you want to spend them, they can be used on cosmetics, some characters, and the perk shop, any perk bought from the shrine will be a teachable
---
Image Legion working on a gen when all the sudden rock and roll Jesus comes charging at him with a knife.
---
I hid in this place when going against Spirit as well. Seems to be a Spirit counter.
---
Can you hit her up there? I fear you might just fall, because the path is pretty fatshaming.
---
I was actually very anxious about playing killer for a long while cause it just seemed way more stressful than playing survivor. I've gotten past it but I still only play 2-3 killer matches vs 8-10 survivor matches
---
Wait there are cookies?
---
For about 2 months now as survivor every 2 or 3 matches I can't self heal or use dead hard or even a med kit and when all this is happening in the same match, I can't escape the match thru the gates cause the game let's me run outside the map instead of escaping. The killer watches me run in and out, downs me after I am supposed to win and then hooks me instead of giving me my rightful win they the hatch.
---
They fixed wake up with the quickness, if they ignore survivors again when this glitch happens literally every 2 or 3 matches and cater to killer again, they may see some riots.
---
At least fix both issues so the game isn't even more unfair to one side. And so you know if a survivor slides over the pallet with you stuck it will free you. I tried freeing a Doc yesterday but he slugged me so I crawled out the exit instead of freeing him.

---
That's messed up. I get more salty fucked up messages from my fellow survivors than I do from killers. I think killers tend to be more sweaty and can of course be douchy, but some survivors get really pissed when the game doesn't turn out their way and will blame everyone except themselves for the outcome. Even my survive with friends can act that way. It's not my fault you died when I told you to not go for the save because I'm already over here and he is face camping. I have borrowed time, you are injured, how is that my fault?
---
Can we bring back Thoughtful Thursday please?
---
&gt; Yes, so are there ways to deal with NOED
---
Yes, there are. But solo queue survivor is a different beast than killer, that's why so many players find killer way more relaxing to play than survivor.
---
&gt;I disagree. I think killers are having fun if they can make use of the perk they chose and it rewards them with 1+ kill(s).

I don't think you understand, but the point of playing killer isn't to *just* get kills. You're going to get railed in the ass nonstop and get shittalked constantly if you play the game *just* for kills. They're not a reward. You get like 500-1000 bp per kill.
---
It's like playing survivor to JUST survive. There is so much to it in the realm of the game. It's why ranking doesn't STRICTLY go off if you survived/ if you got kills. (Or why it even shouldn't)
---
In battle royales the biggest tip everyone gives to winning is to "Not go for #1 spot"- cause going for it conditions you to hide, avoid fights, and see progress TO that goal, but not *really* hitting it. And by a fluke you might win a match, but you never actually grasped the essence of the game.
---
Same for DBD. You can award a survivor who literally never touches a gen, dresses immersed, and crouch walks along the corners of the map all game/ jumps into lockers when a survivor gets hooked. They find hatch and SURVIVE.
---
A killer can squeeze 1 kill out by tunnelling/ camping a single survivor, and repeating that when they get NOED proc'd, and getting 2-3 kills that way. So close to killing them ALL! Sometimes they get the 4k too! But did they really win when so many of the fundamentals of playing the role went unexplored and neglected?
---
You can argue "they had fun getting that win condition", but I actually **believe** that's a genuinely bad attitude to have. If mastery is not important, and any means necessary is fine, why don't we just *sell* these win screens to people? A feature in your favourite battle royale to pay to play in a lobby of bots or paid actors to "hand you the win"- the person can have fun, right?
---
But it lacks any of the *point* in playing games, the learning process or mastery. The "true" fun when you can get these results consistently by grasping more.
---
Not to mention, even though it's am asymmetrical game, both roles can have equal GREAT fun by playing as close to their max potential as possible, sans cheesy stuff like omega blink nurse.
---
I know I'm getting off topic but this is kind of the heart of the issue.
---
If bullying in his definition = flashlights, pallet saves, and doing gens, then what is the problem? These are things that are part of normal gameplay. I don't see where the "bullying" is.
---
How it feels after trying out nurse for the first time in 2 years and managed to just clutch out a 4k with minimal perks and no add ons, then it proceed to them calling me a range of racial and homophobic slurs but not anything about my gameplay. in the post game chat
---
I don't care about lore at all.
---
Designwise I really like Ghostface, Hag, and Plague.
---
1) at 30 35 and 40 you'll unlock teachables on each character which means that their perks become learnable in other characters blood webs 
---
2) at 50 you can prestige which will reset that characters blood web and give you a bloody cosmetic you can do this 3 times
---
3) unless the killer is camping you always want to get the survivor off the hook before they enter struggle but don't unhook when the killer is super close by as the hooked person will most likely just be downed again
---
4) and yes without any add ons killers are always faster then survivors, you need to be tricky and agile to survive
---
You gotta get that checked on or something, mine doesn't do that.
---
It's ridiculous. Is this what goes on behund the scenes:
---
"Lets fix our killers but not fix the actual game breaking/annoying bugs. You know, the stuff that can affect our players enjoyment."
---
"Sure Dave, sounds good. Let's do that."
---
"Oh and let's make our players wait months for us to fix gamebreaking shit"
---
"DAVE... PROMOTION"
---
I mean, what the even fuck?
---
1. That means those perks will appear on other survivor's bloodwebs going forward. Bloodwebs are a big RNG game and you have no guarantee when they will appear. For example I have had characters get all the perks I want for them in the first 10-15 levels while I have had other characters not get a perk I want for them till 30+
---
2. You can either keep the character at that level or you can prestige them. Prestiging them basically resets them and you lose all your perks and add ons. The advantage is that you get better perks and add ons earlier in you web going forward 
---
3. Depends on the situation. It is not a case of doing this or that in textbook situations . Learn to read the situation and figure what is best for you and your team. Doing a gen can have more of impact on a team then a rescue early in the game. Assuming early game that means they are on their first hook so you have a minute to make a save in the first phases and two minutes until they are sacrificed. Killers sometimes panic if gens are done quick. So in some cases if your team pops a gen or two before saving it can break a camping killer from camping.  I wish I could give you a better clearer answer but unfortunately there isn't one
---
4. Yes, besides nurse (I think), killers are faster than survivors. Watch some videos of streamers to learn better juking patterns and techniques. Note that killers have bloodlust and they get faster the longer the chase goes. My best tip is that sometimes running is not the best option. in a chase. For example if you have some distance with a pallet stun, vault, etc.. stop running and walk crouch you way to cover/locker. Now this is no guarantee it will work  but once you stop running you stop leaving scratch marks. Killers can get a bit tunnel vision for those in a chase especially if you cut line of sight on them. Stopping running at a window or pallets can confuse a killer and give you some time to sneak away. Killers might assume you have Dance with me and leave the area.
---
Never gonna forgive any of them for April Fool’s 2018.
---
If that happens I’ll be making a Kate Denson Gameplay Montage with Cotton Eye Joe Playing in the background.
---
I'm not implying:)
---
Yeah that happened to me recently, I had to dc in order to leave. I was not about to die to egc, due to some stupid bug
---
The same can be said about the old DS. DS can give a second chance, NOED can give a free kill, possibly more.
---
I do that all the time
---
Replace your thermal paste
---
I would care less if it wasn't super common. But I see that damn glitch at least 1 out of every 4 games that I play.
---
I really should. I just got a new PlayStation a couple days ago and I haven’t downloaded DBD yet so maybe it was because my old PlayStation was shit.
---
"NOED enables killers to get a 4k even if they didnt manage to get a single hook all game!" entire team proceeds to kamikaze rush the hook one milisecond after the killer is done hanging the survivor on it while noed is active.
---
If people wanna use NOED let them they can use whatever they want it’s just a game. If survivors were good like most claim it shouldn’t be a prob
---
I'm new to the game (about 3.5 - 4 hrs.) and loop like a 3-legged dog.
---
I guess I need to unlock a speed boost perk to have any kind of chance.
---
Woah hey there buddy, let’s calm down a bit.
---
I can't even count the number of times that has happened to me, it was incredibly annoying.
---
I love the Halloween one and Saw ones. The later being what pulled me into wanting to get the game. Personally I have not been a fan of the Plague DLC.
---
Thoughtful Thursday coming back maybe? I would actually consider posting something if it had a chance vs the meme generator images that have nothing to do with dead by Daylight but the mods let it stay for some reason
---
-24 lol
---
3.  That depends.  It's almost always better IMHO to finish a gen early in the game. If the person is far away, always fix the gen. If gens don't get fixed, no one escapes.  If you're really close to a person on the hook unhook them once the killer is gone.  Keep in mind they usually have 3 chances on the hook.
---
4. Yes killers move faster than survivors (unless they're using a perk).  Killers view is FPP and yours is TPP.  You're also more agile than the killers, so you have to use those 2 things to your advantage.  You'll never straight out run a killer.
---
I just imagine it as being 1 charge lasts 145% longer so it should be the same as if it just had 145% more charges.
---
The devs once tested a flying Killer, but deemed it too strong unfortunately, it's an interesting concept
---
Same, I don’t mind if you kill me but maybe not be a sweaty dickhead and have a bit of fun before you do so
---
&gt; No matter how I perform, I usually get flamed every second game by the survivors.
---
Just to note, I *literally never* get this issue, except the usual camping accusation from a survivor that scored 4k points in a 12 minute game they were alive for 10 minutes of.
---
My playstyle revolves around the down -&gt; hook -&gt; chase next survivor and down -&gt; hook, repeat on cycle till everyone is hooked 3 times and judge my performance by how many gens are left and how confident I felt I did in chases/ knowing what I fucked up on.
---
SWF bullies &amp; nurse mains  
---
Color me surprised
---
Yes, that's exactly what I was saying. You absolute melt.
---
When people give me shit, I just laugh because its hilarious that people get so bent out of shape playing vidya. I usually screenshot what they say, MS Paint clip it, and drop it in our discord chat. That way we all get a laugh at some mad neckbeard's expense.
---
People call The Plague "plag" as a joke because No0b3 mistakenly pronounced it that way after her release.
---
thanks
---
What if I told you, it is the music that Jeff is listening to?
---
I know, that's why I'm making a joke about it.
---
And it means the killer is probably coming.
---
I have an idea. How about we stop shaming people on shit that’s intentionally part of the game?
---
&gt; but why do survivors have to set nerfs to their perks and killers get a buff in the same update? 
---
I don't know why this is so difficult to understand.  
---
I am not trying to be rude, sorry.  
---
Killers need buffs. Survivors don't.
---
So if they are updating something ... they will (or atleast should) nerf survivors and buff killers?
---
&gt; If they remove pallet vacuums, why not hook vacuums too? 
---
Because pallet vacuums were a way bigger issue? They allready nerfed hooks couple of times. (For example when they made it impossible for a facecamping killer to bodyblock the saving process).
---
Could you link me a few example posts that it was posted the "other day". You didn't answer my question, and I'm actually curious if this gets reposted often, or if you're just trolling.
---
Nea
---
Nope
---
I had 1 guy on the hook and they all came to unhook him as it was endgame, I downed em all and let the endgame timer run out. They all died there for 1 guy
---
Agreed.
---
Thanks for being willing.  I don't play console, so I only saw the stuff from outside, and early on it was "we can't issue bans on consoles", and then they said "well, now we CAN", but it seemed like a lot of folks just glossed over it.  Maybe it was just marketing, or wishful thinking, but if it's been a while, it couldn't hurt to try again now.  Too many folks just settle in to "well, they're not gonna do it, so why bother", but hell, if everyone thinks that, noone reports, and so nothing happens anyway.  It's nice to see someone willing to at least give it another shot. Hopefully, it works out.  If not, then I apologize for encouraging you to waste your time.  Sadly, with most games I've ever played, it's hard to tell how much effect it has, since most companies never share details on whether someone was banned or not.  I've always hated that.
---
This billy looks like he’d chain me and say “Yare Yare Daze.”
---
Leatherface. His face, gait, and noises really get to me.
---
Gameplay-wise, probably Hag. The jumpscares are plentiful.
---
His base power is already slightly annoying with an easy run-and-stab that is hard to counter. Add the fact that your aura will be revealed if your teammate is stabbed, it can quickly become really unfun to go against especially for people like myself who like to be more stealthy (I suck at looping).
---
Add that some of his add-ons are very strong and make him even harder to counter. Not as bad as it used to be but still not an enjoyable time for survivors for the most part.
---
spirit to hear how she changes from 'hello survivors lets farm' to 'i will murder you all'
---
&gt;use the powers to vault a window
---
They're not using their power, that's just how spirit looks when vaulting. From her perspective she's climbing through the window like any other killer does, but from the survivors perspective she stands there and then suddenly appears on the other side.
---
So YOU didn't actually kill anyone, the entity did. Also they did the gens really fast and you didn't do much chasing/hooking. You got the emblems you deserved.
---
He's burnt out, like someone else said, he should just go play something else, like he is. It happens roo much to streamers and YouTubers. They over play a game because they feel obligated and if you mix work and play, your hobby becomes a job and it's no fun. Honestly I unsubbed from him a week ago. Nothing against him, but it's just not for me anymore :)
---
Excellent art 10/10
---
Why do you say that?
---
Either his internet shit the bed temporarily or he lagswitched.
---
Okay but what makes this ghostface? He's missing the most iconic parts. No mask, no knife. Just a hooded robe.
---
I'll try my best to hang in there. Hopefully I improve.
---
Omg right. I always see those videos of people losing killers in the corn. Nuh uh. Not here. No matter how much I 360 or 180 or run around like a manic, I just never shake them off. They always find me.
---
Imagine not running WGLF. I play surv with 3 perk slots basically, can't stand the BP generation rate without it.
---
It’s actually apart of her kit. From survivor pov she just phases through a window, to help w the mind games. It can be confusing because if you play as Spirit, she actually has a vaulting animation, but survivors don’t see it.
---
So, passive phasing activates 100% of the times when they vault
---
I enjoy the Saw DLC. Creeping around as the Pig and ambushing survivors is fun.
---
&gt; Killer is more relaxing than survivor?
---
You have way more control over the game, the areas everyone plays in, you get to capitalize on all the mistakes survivor teams make. You play a more observant role than anything, and only really need to "turn on" when you get a slug domino rolling and are at those "make or break" moments where winning a chase with a survivor will determine if the game ends in the next minute or goes for another 10.
---
&gt;If I play survivor on red ranks I can still talk with my buddys and listen to music (which i don't blast but still).
---
Maybe it's because I much prefer chases, but my play sessions always start with trying to queue killer, giving up cause queue is too long, playing several rounds of survivor and usually getting so pissed with teammates or a toxic killer I swap to killer myself. Then when I get bored I swap back to survivor for more interesting matches and it's a die roll whether I end upset or smug.
---
&gt;Depends on the person. I would say that people care way more about kills than pipping for example.
---
&gt;1K and I pipped? Feels like losing.
---
&gt;4K and black pip? Yea, I owned them!
---
I mean some of my best games were like sub 10 minutes and I left with like 28k points, 0k, and each survivor almost hit 30k. To me good matches are where back and forth happens with where pressure is placed, and more exchanges = more point events.
---
It beats using Whispers to find 4 immersed claudettes, hooking them 1 by 1, and finishing the match with like 5 total hooks and 5 gens left. Those are the matches that swap me back into survivor, cause on survivor I can at least *guarantee* a fucking **CHASE** will finally happen.
---
&gt;You get shittalked no matter what you do.
---
False but I get that anecdotes aren't convincing
---
&gt;But there are a lot of people in lower ranks who just enjoy the game and are fine with their own playstyle.
---
To be honest low rank DBD is in its own genre of game honestly lol
---
I'm mainly focusing around DBD's culture of like past rank 10, where most players will get what perks do what. The type to complain about a killer running NOED in a different way than the Rank 17 "OMG ITS SO OP" type of player.
---
Ngl I always hoped that you could knock a killer out of a mori and leave the survivor at the injured / dying state depending on how long the mori has been going on for.
---
Or maybe after the point of no return the survivor would just be dead regardless. But if you are quick enough to stun em, then the survivor may be saved
---
Is the hag from plants vs zombies?
---
*insert obvious Nea joke here*
---
Meme's are magic, ain't gotta explain shit.
---
Then passive phasing activates 100% of the times when they vault
---
Everyone hates on my boys/girls, I love Legion's lore, and how they actually met Jeff before  they were taken.
---
Fire Up doesn't increase your movement speed like NOED does. Fire Up only increases the speed at which you vault, break pallets, and pick up survivors. Also one shots for Ghostface are still useful because you don't need to bother stalking them, and can hit them right out of stealth.
---
Did this in about 20 minutes, so I think I’ll be fine.
---
As an old Killer main, that's pretty crazy to add. I guess it prevents those games where the Survivor fucks with the Killer, but it really puts pressure on the other Survs who havn't found the gate. Neat.
---
which just happens to be the best thing i've ever seen.
---
I'm reminded of the time on the Dead by Daylight Discord someone complained about constantly getting found early and I recommended to him that he practice playing stealthily and try out perks like Urban Evasaion and Spine Chill. Then this one big brain gamer harassed me for like a week straight by typing "JUST LEARN STEALTH 4HEAD" in the chat over and over again until like 5 people finally told the mods to tell him to stop because he was derailing the chat.
---
And people wonder why the DBD Discord is a meme.
---
You forgot Jeff. Heart of gold, troubled past, really altruistic
---
[deleted]
---
I used to be so shit with her, but now I'm getting better
---
Go to the pillars and back
---
I've found that too.  The flashlight people must be doing dailies ... is there a flashlight daily?  Because they're never interested in anything other than blinding me.  It's usually just free hits.
---
I stick with Spirit, Hag, Ghostface and Wrath.  
---
I suck with Billy. :(  
---
Regarding getting insulted it just doesn't feel like anything I do is right.  
---
Couple games ago I gifted the hatch to someone on The Game.  
---
He proceeded to flame me that I only got him because of scummy tactics, lag (there wasn't any) and more.  
---
Another game. It starts with a claudette flickering her flashlight at me aswell as using her "come with me" emote.  
---
She runs to a safe loop but doesn't read my moonwalking/mindgame correctly and ends up getting hit.  
---
After getting hit the speed bonus + her looking over the shoulder at me resulted in her sprinting in a corner.  
---
I downed her, she dc'd and she flamed me on my steam profile.  
---
Another game. Two people dc'd right of the bat when I grabbed one as Ghostface and insta-downed the second shortly after.  
---
I went for the other 2 dudes and just hooked/killed them. Didn't want to waste any time in this unfair setup.  
---
They flamed me for not going easy on them/farming with them (because of the dc's).  
---
Don't get me wrong. I love toxicness. I love the flame. I love to flame back. It's just additional entertainment for me.  
---
But I still ... well ... get flamed pretty often. No matter what I do. That's the point I was trying to make.
---
Basically this community is entitled as shit. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I walked back I the map and then back into the exit gate but it still didn’t work. Hopefully they fix it because I lost my flashlight and blood points due to a bug.
---
As a fellow huntress main, why run iridescent with a mori?
---
For me that takes all the fun out of the game and you'll end up with what, 8k points?
---
The heads are strong enough on their own, to the point people simply DC when they see them.
---
I did that since before Demise of the Faithful went live.
---
Your in better hands now child
---
I have had  games where I downed 3 survivors with bubba very early and got the last one. Ended that game early as hell cause they were stupid and I got no pip. He's right it makes no sense
---
The survivors are making the exact same face I make when I realize I was just exposed.
---
How about switching it up and having 4 killers and 1 survivor? The rounds would probably end up being pretty short though...
---
Omfg ... OMFG!
---
NO ... NOOOOOO!
---
I'm gonna go sit in the corner now.
---
Michael huntress
---
I am indeed
---
Im sure this is a hot take, but he isnt very good at the game, so his complaints to me fall on deaf ears. I used to watch him til i noticed he camps every hook and tunnels even when its not optimal at the time, his survivor is cringey cause he complains about the same stuff he does. Also i took Scotts side in their twitter beef, so Im bias on that
---
It's just like my zelda randomizer. Where my hoverboots is the Zora king Mweeping and Navi is the Woman screeching
---
Yea unfortunately that's not enough. You need to earn points by breaking pallets, ending chases quickly, you loose points for camping when no survivor is around the hook, you need to use your killers ability on survivors and you need to hook everyone at least twice for a good score. You also didn't prevent them from doing gens so you lose points for that
---
Haddonfield + balanced landing is sooo good!
---
Yeah I agree makes no sense you should get a bonus for getting them all super early in the game
---
Yeah I loved this show
---
Me neither. I’m just saying nurses definitely aren’t ever concerned with how quickly gens get done
---
Same. My old PS4 was a Day 1 version and only recently swapped to one of the newer versions. I haven’t played DBD on it yet so idk if it’s fixed.
---
This show was actually really good
---
Well If you buy the halloween pack you also get strode. And d strike is amazing so I do recommend getting the pack
---
prayer beads spirit hands down
---
That's me with hundreds of hours :/ don't worry, it doesn't get better :'(
---
I've been trying to get in to Plague, but I usually just go back to Legion.
---
Yee I was kind of surprised people hate it so much but I never let myself judge too hard because after all I don't play DBD and things could be very different in terms of small yet significant things that make NOED a much bigger threat than it is in IDV. I dunno haha, but still in my eyes it's not that horribly terrible disgusting of a perk 😂 in fact survivors very much respect it over in IDV cause it's one of the only things that give a chance for the hunter to maintain a steady chance of killing survivors after the gates have been opened XD idk again I don't have enough experience to speak from a DBD player's POV
---
Ok.
---
I get your point but it's not reaaaally the point to just kill. Cos then camping and tunnelling would be the strat in most cases.
---
Because the point of a survivor is not to just *survive*. They are encouraged (by the ranking system) to be altruistic and risky with the killer. To actively seek unhooks and to get into chases and win them.
---
So with this knowledge, securing a kill first time on all survivors would just be to camp and tunnel. I don't know how you played that game but I'm just responding to your comment.
---
Get the spirit and run train on survivors with hex ruin and BBQ chili
---
I watched everyone load in with bright clothes and 4 flashlights (they bodyblocked hooks despite the game just started). Simply felt **fair.** I don't like running them but toxicity begets toxicity
---
With ambiguous titles such as "crate too op, pls nerf", how do you expect me to provide a list of posts like these?
---
Ghostface generally generates a ton of frustration due to just how fucking buggy the detection system is. You'll be staring dead at him coming down a road and get exposed. Then while you're chasing him inside a building and he's nowhere on your screen you apparently detect him and pull him out of stealth.
---
Spirit is more of a soft nurse pick. Very unfun to play against, but fun to play as. She could definitely have like 1 or 2 things changed to make mindgames an actual thing from both sides.
---
You do often get dipshits in games but if they're running shit like urban evasion or sprint burst you can just ignore anything they say.
---
So true
---
Okay.
---
Yeah it was fire
---
This happened to a killer I played against this morning......they DC'd right after. Poor killer. :(
---
What about sweater boi and legion?
---
I'd be down, my steam name is Skyfios.
---
DC’s will never go anywhere because there’s no punishment for it,  
---
Even when dedicated servers come out people will just kill themselves on hook instead.
---
It might just be your rank, or something bugs the people out of the game, not sure. 🤷‍♂️
---
Make it an Until Dawn based DLC so I can get my sweet Josh(Rami Malek) some closure :(
---
Welcome to dbd where the it's all for fun and the  matchmaking system is nonexistent
---
Endgame is now "super early"?
---
I main killer but I enjoy the game. 
---
What are gonna do now eh
---
Glad to see that the devs made this really good ranking system that definitely works and isn’t even slightly broken, keep up the good work devs!
---
?
---
im with ya! everyone has to start somewhere though, you've got this :)
---
Halloween and nightmare on elm street dlc. Halloween because of Myers and elm street because of Quentin
---
Had a killer game vs swf where I got farmed all game. They got every hook to 99%, bodyblocked, flashlight blinded, broke every totem, 99%-ed every gen, then escaped. It took 30 minutes, and it made me quit the game for about a month
---
I mean, if it was downvoted so much, people mustn't have thought it was *clearly a piss take*. It just comes across a bit too serious and a bit cynical.
---
The brunette looks so much like Nicole Da Silva.
---
Buy the leatherface one for BBQ and Chili + Franklins. BBQ is the best killer perk in the whole game. Hands down.
---
I passed the torch to my 8 year old son recently so we could SWF together. Instead he got a taste for killer. He’s now a Huntress main and absolutely demolishes everyone when we play KYF.
---
If you're planning to play killer, then Leatherface DLC is the single most useful one. His teachable perk BBQ &amp; Chili is a HUGE help in levelling killers. On top of that, it has quite good ingame effect, too
---
Other than that - watch some videos and streams and decide which killer you like the most. With different playstyles it's impossible to say what's the best killer for you.
---
i thought i got sooo much better recently
---
then i played a match last night agains ta very obvious swf.   im a lvl 16 killer now.  they had a lvl 6 a lvl 8 and 2 lvl 19s or something.   those 2 (the 6 and the 8) ran me around, juked me did whatever they wanted to.  
---
i never felt so violated in my entire life.
---
I make that face as Wraith when I’m about to get that Mori off.
---
I thought about the incompatibility with other killers with the perk Cursed Prayer so I will make some modifications. Hex: Healing Ruin was based off the Hag's hex but I'll change it to 1 totem. Of course no one will have fun losing control of their character. Is any killer power truly fun for the survivor? I have had many players DC just because I was using my power properly as a killer.
---
Lisa is 'The Hag.' Her full name is Lisa Sherwood.
---
Hold B
---
Yet here you are
---
Honestly if there was one point you could improve on is the running into the tractor part.
---
I played 3 matches on XB1 before work this morning, and there were a total of 4 DC's. Pathetic. It's like, just finish the fucking match already! LOL!
---
"Gameplay"
---
Ok so killers need buffs and survivors dont. So just buff the killers and let the survivors alone. I'm not talking about changing the map and game mechanics that favor survivors. I'm talking about nerfing perks so hard they literally become useless. Just because pallet vacuums were a bigger issue does not dispute the fact that hook vacuums are an issue.
---
Actually, just checked and it only has one downvote, which I'm assuming is yours, so you've achieved your goal I suppose.
---
You’re right!  Dead hippie.
---
Did this to a ghostface once, he never got out and me (because he hit me through the pallet) and the only other living survivor were in the dying state with nothing to pick us up, it was a very boring 5219461 hours
---
Quentin is king
---
I think that's Hag
---
 This is really great. *I love this art* &lt;3
---
What’s wrong with NOED anyway?
---
I modeled her off the Plague, Hillbilly/Leatherface, Michael Myers/Ghostface, Spirit/Nurse, ect. The Nun could be a Plague counterpart. Or not, this is just how I had her invisioned.
---
Certain killers easier/better for beginners. I started with trapper and hillbilly no I play nurse ghostface and wraith
---
Who is "scream"
---
Though i may be wrong, i partially blame the 2x bloodhunt, and event.
---
With the massive amount of farming that happened, isn't it likely that a bunch of R15-20, managed to get to R1-8, by abusing the farming that was going on?
---
The bespin duel version preferably
---
LIKE A BOSS

Small Game, Rainbow Map, normal map with Red Twine, Detective's Hunch, learning spawn areas, just starting the round next to one.

Try to work to work through it because hex skill checks are pretty easy hit. Also, ruin is effective simply because survivors waste time trying to cleanse it rather than working gens
---
Yeah just use headphones to make it more noticeable. But the terror radius is definitely quieter now which is annoying and a lot of sound effects just changed in volume since the update like Myers tier up jingle is really hard to hear while a pallet being broken (both as killer and survivor) destroys my eardrums.
---
A happy meal
---
preach
---
Compared to Anna or The Trappr, I think Mike is powerful in short bursts, but they can sustain... then again, he did carry his sister’s tombstone several blocks without anyone noticing, so...
---
you seem like a really toxic person, just sayin'
---
Every. Time.
---
You can't bring a scythe thou, but you could bring a blade! I agree thou, cool fake-ush weapon :)
---
Holy hell.
---
You make it? lol
---
Imagine playing killers when pallet vacuum wasn't removed. OOF, playing killer always stressful since you're against a team with 4 people with all the clutch perks. (Exhaustion,Adrenaline,DS,BT,SC,)
---
You can literally listen to some chill music while juking,so I rather play survivor for now. (the queue time is shorter too)
---
No you ain't
---
Usually hang around in the 11-13 area
---
Rest In Peace Phillip. At least you’re trying your best out there killer!
---
I dunno, now that I think about it, in terms of raw strength, Anna fights bears and stags, Michael carry’s tombstones and flips cars, the two could be pretty evenly matched...

Depends on the time of day. Played a bit today and they were about 5 minute queues, but last night they were only a minute or so.
---
I mean it’s so rare that i get that map that if a survivor was in it I’d probably go with it... unless they’re a cunt
---
Surprised he didn't just commit and finish the switch. It's just Vommy-Mommy, after all.
---
Uhhh ok... You literally made a comment about *not* commenting idk what else to say
---
Hags arm would just snap lol.
---
Nope, I was running around looking for the gate but the endgame bar jumped ahead about 1/3 in length and I died lol.
---
Try to pallet loop billy now
---
I did, but I decided I wanted to have the last comment, hence the replies.
---
Lmao i love u i'm nurse main too
---
No... really?
---
No, but you can hear them. Spirit relys mostly on sound. Of they're healing just go to where you think they're and listen.
---
1. Wiggling is definitely not toxic. It is a game mechanic and I've never been called a bad name for wiggling.
---
2. Claudette is great for her self-heal perk, but Nea has urban evasion which is very useful for sneaking around. Play the way you want to play. There are so many killer perks to reveal survivors that it won't be an issue.
---
Damn, man. Tbh, that connection he had sealed your fate anyway lmao.
---
Hey, if her age aint on the clock, she cannot have my cock.
---
I'd deffo take Self Care (over Spine Chill) at that rank. Survivors below red ranks simply can't be trusted. And do you really need Spine Chill when you can, you know, turn your camera?
---
Doc is off to the side resetting the bones in Freddy’s arm after he tried Anna for kicks.
---
I'm sure they didnt kno he would get stuck.. they were just hoping for an easy pallet stun..
---
This post has personally attacked me
---
Yeah I’m averaging about 4-5 minutes right now.
---
watching this genuinely made me jump
---
Where are your perks??
---
You mean rank 1 huntress with iridescent head?
---
Lmao... you'll get good and stomp us all in the end
---
DS is still incredibly good; especially for late game when the killer has no choice but to go for you twice in most situations. Add in the fact that Enduring no longer reduces the stun for DS; it's a free 5 second window to get away.
---
I sent u a friend request
---
Talking about Jeff? I'm always up for that
---
Do I have to ask? They have it every time.
---
DS is kinda trash since it's rare to find yourself tunneled out at red ranks... and if he slugs than your not gunna get to use it.
---
Unbreakable again kinda trash except for late game slugs but 90% of knock downs your gunna get hooked sooo whatever I guess.
---
Deliverance again is a niche perk that works with swf but in solo the killers just gunna turn around and slap your ass again.
---
Dead hard is a 1 time use perk, a joke.
---
It's so incredibly narrow in its use since everyone knows when you have it and they wont fall for it...
---
Other than the 1 or 2 times you'll find yourself barely able to reach a pallet isnt enough for this perk that's exhaustion for some reason... to be used over balanced, lithe, or even sprint burst most of the time.
---
I imagine Amanda trying this on Evan first only to realize he’s a man who doesn’t feel pain, and then getting flipped over the table.
---
Same on Xbox. Console players are just bad at games in general. It’s a trend in every pvp game I’ve ever played. Coming across a random that is reliable in any game is so rare
---
1. No, in no way is wiggling toxic. Survivors wiggle to get off the killers shoulder.
---
2. People joke about Claudette being stealthy because of her p3 skin being dark and hard to see on a lot of maps. Her perks are not that stealthy by nature, Jake or Nea are more stealthy based on their base perks Really with the right perks and/or skins any survivor could stealth. For example a Jeff with urban evasion, distortion, calm spirit, and bond can be just as stealthy as any Claudette. 
---
I wouldn't worry about being seen as "Toxic" trust me there are players out there who will find an excuse to call anything you do toxic. I got called toxic for playing Hag and putting down traps near hooked survivors and pallets. Just as long as you are not trying to being intentionally irritating to another player, on either side, you are not toxic. Find a play style that works for you and play it.
---
Am I stupid or is there a benefit to only using 1-2 perks?
---
Excuse me, sir, I didn't ask to be called out like this
---
Go to the Deathgarden Reddit page, it’s the same exact thing lol. Whenever you have game with two sides competing against one another of course the community is going to split and choose sides. Killers and survivors are like crips and bloods 😂😂😂
---
Speak for yourself, i’m tryna skull fuck the Hex Totem
---
It’s better to help a baby nurse get better than to have a p3 Billy or Spirit be the only thing to stomp on console.
---
Lol
---
This is toxic dude, you should be reported
---
I think the problem with totems is that you can't see how many are left
---
Ohh and a ghille suit maybe a claymore
---
how do i delete someone else's comment?
---
You idiot, toxic killers are fueled by toxic survivors. You are stuck and create even more loops. Stop it and get your ass out of rank 20 where killers think that camping is a legit strat and you won't get bullied anymore.
---
ah, that blows. thanks a bunch
---
&gt; The Nun takes control of the survivor for 10 seconds while the Possesed survivor is in the 5 meter radius of a generator or exit gate.
---
This part is what will never fly with survivors. Even when Doc puts me in Madness 3, I still can run, hide and do other things. It's me controlling my character, not other player. 
---
What will happen when my survivor is possessed by Nun, and I press "run forward" or "repair a gen"? What can I do in those 10 seconds? If answer is "you can only wait", then it's a such unfun power, that it has zero chance to end up in a multiplayer game.
---
butt.. dancers?
---
Guys should I tell him I'm like...rank 6?
---
Hasn't happened so far, but I bet ghostface will be the scariest

Omg that would be soo good

Hillbilly could have some banjo song

Wraith could have some Bell song

Trapper would be defult

Didnt even want to add a tag. But seriously. The character pisses me off.
---
Reason for dc: trapped by survivor
---
can you not see the outfit is literally the exact same its just the mask and knife lol
---
I've been having some performance issues with killer lately - low frames, especially when trying to hit people, or when something like gen popping or perk activating happens. Doesn't help that I'm often trying to play nurse, and I can't see anything that's going on because my screen keeps shaking. 
---
My system is far above the min requirements for the game, and survivor usually runs better (tho there's also always this lag when someone gets hit with an effect, but that's just the perfect programing i guess). I already run on low quality, any other tips on what I could do to make the game run more smoothly? Rn playing killer just makes me get a headache.
---
Too bad I am not new and have every teachable and still run it.  
---
FLAME ME! LETS GO!
---
*this takes place during exit gates being active*
---
Meg that teabags all match and fell for my pallet bear trap: N-No... I’m not slowing down... I-I cannot move. I-Impossible! M-My B-Body won’t move at all!
---
Me: Meg. (Breaks pallet) it’s been 4 seconds. I guess that’s your limit now. 
---
Meg: **Nani the fuck?!**
---
Me: I placed a trap there at the start of the match. I knew it’d prevent your escape. **Yare yare daze**. Now... it won’t take even a second to finish you off!
---
Meg:T-Trapper!
---
*To be continued*
---
I like the Clown's ST. it reminds me of the good ol' days with the pals when we started playing the game! now I play alone :(
---
O K O B A
---
I need to re-watch the show. Not sure how I'm feeling about the upcoming third season.
---
**o0f**, for what? hiding? lmao
---
1. You will be able to unlock Claudette's perks in other survivor's bloodwebs. Just start leveling up other survivor's and you'll see them.
---
2. You can either prestige your character which resets all of your perks, items, add-ons, and offerings or continue to spend points on their bloodweb to unlock every perk.
---
3. It depends on the skill level of your group. At low levels, unhooks can quickly turn into a slug fest with 0 generators getting done. Also, if someone appears to be very altruistic on your team, just stick to gems.
---
4. Yes. They will eventually catch up to you. The goal is to keep the occupied for as long as possible.
---
Legion? If I know it is a legion no one time I ever bring my purple medkits.
---
I dont really get to heal against the plauge cause jesus I dont wanna deal with that corrupt purge which is why I tore iron will when il feeling spicy.
---
These are 2 killers who pretty much force injured survivors on the map 24/7
---
As it's impossible to know if these are gunna be used...
---
I'll take the odds with my 40 second self care after escaping a chase or getting forgotten about... over a 1.5 minutes map search for a team mate that can heal me... see how I calculate the fact it's a map that isnt a 3 foot square cube?
---
Map travel is huge time in this game and since I'm rank 1 and usually trying to win... I dont chase the killer Tonmy team mates so often I find myself at least a 1-2 minute travel to any of their locations... and that's if I'm sprinting.. even more when I'm trying to lessen the risk of getting my moaning ass caught away from a safe run around location.
---
Big... Murtha fuckin.... thonk
---
I just got com banned so thats me now lol
---
But the sweetest is the huntress :3
---
As a beginner play a killer with a very straight forward and simple power like trapper, wraith or Piggy. After you're somewhat decent at killing then get to the more advanced like huntress spirit and hillbilly. Nurse deserves her own spot here because she's completely different from all the other killers and takes a lot of practice to master but is unbeatable if played correctly. Wouldn't go for that until you have learned how to generally play killer
---
Why is huntress here
---
I think he got his buddies to upvote his comments so he doesn't feel so much in the wrong, imagine being a decent survivor and not being able to hit the overcharge skill check
---
com banned? why? you been a naughty boi?
---
that theme is forever printed in my mind because it played the time i started playing this game
---
Dang that auto correct
---
**IT THIS A MOTHER F\*ING JOJO REFERENCE?!!!**
---
Sweater boi is strong against uncoordinated groups, sure, but he isn't ridiculous. Legion is a bit strong imo but they aren't unbearable.
---
When playing as survivor you must learn and adapt, getting caught by killer is supposed to be punishing so really killer balance isn't high on list of things that I'd want.
---
I said I'll fly kick someones nan after they put me my the hatch then moried me
---
So you are telling me that rank 6 killer camp? Nice joke. If you dont know camping takes away your bps
---
you're not alone
---
Hmm I could see your point, maybe I will modify the effects of being in a possession status. Just throwing out an idea, does a speed reduction and possibly inverted controls sound fun? I'm trying to think of something. Also I made changes to Unholy Prayer and the Hex just now.
---
David Kings map- British High street
---
“Aliens”
---
lmao
---
I would disagree that spine chill becomes useless because no matter what rank GhostFace, Pig, Wraith, Spirit w/ Prayer Beads still exist and it trumps any form of Stealth so you can get those first few steps in to start the chase or hide depending on your playstyle. I've been running Lithe, UE, Iron Will and Spine Chill. It's gotten me to red ranks every single time. But you do you my man.
---
I love the flashlight 'save'  xd
---
"Don't mind me. That's it, keep going. Perfect. That's the image I'll keep of you."
---
Ah, Legion. You probably don't know about this but when Legion is using their ability, as soon as they hit anyone and you're within their terror radius, your location will be revealed to them. If you happen to be hiding in a locker and Legion just hit someone with Frenzy nearby, exit the locker immediately. 
---
Ghost Face can also see location of the survivor who breaks him out of stealth mode for seconds, so you wouldn't want to look at him when you're in a locker. I once grabbed a survivor bc he did that. They probably didn't know about it. It's quite hard for players who play only one side to understand all game mechanics, so yah it's better to play both sides. Plus it's fun playing killer too.
---
Very nice.
---
Run to pallets and windows, not the middle of a field with nothing except for a tractor (which is really unsafe)
---
If he removed that “burnt out” part of the sentence, you would have nothing to say
---
Read my comment history and expand replies, a whole new world awaits you.
---
You did something to really piss off the Entity
---
Yeah I stopped using it because I was downing them too fast
---
Rank 11?! Good times
---
Go watch his video on camping from a few years ago, he’s a prick and I’ve watched his videos and he is just bad at the game, and yes he does camp and tunnel allot. Plus if I’m not mistaken he is a fog whisper too. But after seeing his videos I unsubscribed from his channel, my wife is better at the game as killer than he is and she is a rank 18 killer lol she mostly plays survivor but plays killer every now and then...
---
How did that not hit u lmao
---
Not fuck 'em.
---
But there are a lot of new players coming in lately and they are very vocal, even when knowing nothing. I can only hope the Devs tune them out. 
---
Yes it's hard at first. But then, you can **learn** over time and handle things much easier. The answer isn't to nerf everything to balance the game for rank 20s.
---
You killed the shit outta that pallet though.
---
He has to be in the center of your screen. I know that can be dumb but the mechanic would be really hard to use if survivors could break him out just by having him literally anywhere on our screen.
---
Damn straight
---
So basically you're bitching for the sake of bitching.
---
I enjoy this Polnareff format much more than the scroll of truth
---
Your right. The way I worded it was wrong at the end.
---
He has definitely improved drastically from his release prior as the only way back then to effectively win a high-rank game was to use exploits.
---
However, the current Legion in comparison to other killers is lacking in strength.
---
Because of the nerfs to his vault speeds &amp; fatigue time, he has a hard time with teams of survivors who do not stay together as his power has a hard time reaching survivors. Even relatively close survivors that are within base killer instinct range can outrun his Frenzy, especially if they find a window to vault.
---
Survivors generally feel safe when the Legion uses Frenzy because its not lethal and the stun from exiting Frenzy leaves survivors enough time to cover a large distance before the fatigue ends. 
---
It's not that the re-work was bad it's just that I do believe the devs were a bit zealous with the nerfs he received.
---
I wouldn't smash her
---
I mean spirit is more annoying that a nurse
---
electro swing for doctor
---
That's some quality shitpost
---
tru3 facts.
---
Press r and then blink
---
YYyyyeeeep.
---
This is gold I'm going to do the same as killer from now on!
---
A lot of us went through this, you can do it mate. It's just a matter of time for you to become a master at looping
---
Even at :12 when he is literally in line with my head!? Should he be off center or even higher up on my screen? 
---
I wish he was more sneaky and plays like this weren’t rewarded. When he pops out and scares me I love it, that’s the intended mechanic.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Honestly looks like the most generic fan made with ever.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Never played Death Garden so I know nothing about it or its community. I just know this is the only multiplayer game I follow that has this much if a hypocritical community
---
Title screen causes overheating on all platforms and systems. 
---
You wanted the reason, this is why. Getting past that screen ASAP is the best you can do.
---
My favorite perks are social ineptitude, increased calory capacity, and delayed high school completion into adulthood.
---
I've played this game since it came out and I'm still bad at killer. :'(
---
&gt;I feel like this is just nostalgia
---
It isn't.
---
I understand that this is annoying. It is a bug and "hopfully" they will fix it as fast as possible. And dont try too make a nerf becuse when they fix the killer I thinke he is fun to play agianst.
---
I mean I'm counting using vaults and baiting swings at pallets
---
Haha I totally spaced the 3rd hook sacrifice thing. Alright time to make some more changes.
---
they're the same picture.
---
This has been posted dozens and dozens of times. It's even outdated, MoM sucks now.
---
Also I still like the idea of losing control while possessed because that's what real possessions are like. However 10 seconds seems way to long, so maybe I will just shorten the duration.
---
Personally I prefer the Hag, she was my first killer and after trying out a few different killers I always came back to her. 
---
Don't get too focused on trying to get the meta at this point.  The Hag has a lot of perks that work for her and are unlocked with her.  Focus more on having fun with her and learning how to properly set up her traps.
---
Overall though the basic lessons are knowing when to chase vs. When to check on gens.  Patrolling gens vs. Checking every noise you hear, not running directly to a completed gen, looking down when trying to hook someone to avoid the hook body block, don't be afraid of pallets, slugging means putting someone into the dying state and leaving them that way in order to do something else - it can be a useful strategy but some might see it as toxic if abused.
---
The most important thing?
---
Don't let the teabagging get to you.   Ignore it and play.
---
Xbox as well here.  FYI the killer meta you see around here is typically specific to PC.  Console doesn't play the same way.  
---
Console top killers are probably Billy, Hag and let everyone else fill in the rest.
---
I really recommend watching some streamers who put more than like 3k hours into the game
---
He’s in line with the center of your camera horizontally but not vertically. Also, when GF does plays like this, I find that higher ranks run up to him to guarantee the break-out and force the M1. Still ends up with you one-shot, but you get to use dead hard and you get that saucy sprint burst from being hit, which could get you to a pallet. Might be something worth trying.
---
&gt; But most of the time being injured on a gen gets you hooked
---
Wrong? Just run to a tile when killer approaches
---
Noob3 and Monty are a couple of run that self care? Yup
---
A long ass time
---
*survivor gets saved with Borrowed Time*
---
Leatherface: it was rigga morris gurl, it was rigga morris gurl!
---
Agree 100%
---
I don't see how you can have such opinion just because I can't meticulously check every post out of the hundreds this sub gets daily but ok
---
and then they DC
---
Feels bad
---
I’m going to assume you use bond because you solo queue. Spine Chill, although not *entirely* useless, could easily be replaced. I would take another exhaustion perk, seeing as Adrenaline is one-time use (not even guaranteed, if you don’t make it to late game), and it still activates even if you’re already exhausted. Dead Hard or Balanced Landing are my preference, but Lithe is pretty good too. We’ll Make It is pretty useful. Hell, I’d take Kindred over Spine Chill.
---
Unless your going for a basement build, the only times I would actually say iron grasp is useful is body-blocking
---
She probably doesn’t play an ounce of killer. 
---
But still, we all got 20k+  all game, she got about 8k. Still not sure how that even happened. 
---
All I’m trying to do is see the killers perks. She kept fast vaulting pallets and tbagged at the gate til the very last second. I was ANNOYED. Maybe if the killer tunneled you all game and you escaped?? Even that’s a stretch.  When I tell you she was useless, you know, THAT Claudette- I’m not exaggerating.    
---
I feel bad for killers who have to deal with that. No wonder why people have a bad time??  Killers, I’m on your side and I got you ♡
---
He is, but that is not the centre of your screen. For example at 12 seconds when you are stood still, the white hood of your jacket is basically the centre of the screen. You needed to move your camera upwards to position him in that spot to start revealing him. I agree it is still a bit hit or miss but that’s the general area you need to aim for.
---
Have you got corrupt intervention? Is great for that style.
---
And I get your style but you surely get a few hooks before end game. The way you've been phrasing it, it sounds like you meant you only got the singular hook after late game.
---
The point is hooking each survivor multiple times and unfortunately slowing down gen progress *is* a criteria for ranking. So if your hooks don't make up for the lack of gen prevention then that's the reason you aren't ranking up
---
I wonder if people suggesting these ridiculous changes towards killers ever play survivor.
---
One that's stupid because oblivious survivors would get murdered.  Also the stress it enduces is a plus, it freaks survivors out.
---
I still don't understand why you would run it when if you have a little more situational awareness, you negate the need for it all together. It's *really* not hard to spot a GF or Pig, and for Spirit, just pay attention to the ground foliage (if any). And yeah, Spine Chill does counter prayer beads, but Small Game counters Trapper. Does that mean I should run that too.
---
The game is more than just killing all survivors or escaping as a survivor. It's about doing as much as possible. Survivors complain about this too because they gen jockey the entire game and escape, leading to either -1 pip or 0 pip. The game is about saving others, doing gens, running away from the killer, etc... and the game is structured to value some playstyles more than others. Think about it; if you could easily pip by just gen jockeying the entire game, what would be the point of rescuing? None. Just do gens, pip, and onto the next game.
---
Same thing goes with being a killer. Your points at the end of the game don't mean jack compared to the points needed to pip. People complain about this as survivors when they open chests. Opening chests does nothing to help you pip, it gives you 1) an item and 2) BP's
---
I like watching Puppers. He seems like a good fella and he's always upbeat
---
To be fair, that Plague played stupid.

LMFAO! This is great!

Same, except it was Myers
---
So lemme get this straight.. she is playerlevel 18? (hard to see) and already has 2 teachabled from 2 different characters on her 3rd Character she is playing now?!?! How the fuck!?
---
You even bothering to message them is pretty cringe too. Why bother? Just move onto the next match.
---
That looks so cute.. and creepy at the same time lol
---
"Ohhhhh....come onnnn."
---
&gt; but some survivors start getting personal sometimes
---
Which is exactly why you don't put anything personal on any kind of internet profile that can be seen by the public.
---
At that point, you know that anyone trying to get to you is just throwing out random shit because he can't know any better. 
---
Or, alternatively, just learn to honestly not give a shit about some random internet stranger's opinion, if he already proves to be an asshole with the very first thing he is able to communicate. Life's too short to waste time thinking about that :D
---
Note that you can even train it into your muscle memory. At this point, in any game, when somebody starts throwing out insults or general toxicity, I usually mute/report (depending on the availability of these features in a given game) them before I even realize what exactly they said. It's an auto-pilot thing.
---
Occasionally gets me killed when I suddenly stop mid-push in Siege and suddenly find myself muting someone before being shot by the enemy. Still worth it.
---
If it's literally every other day, then surely you'd be able to remember at least one title or one username to link me at least one post. From my 5 mins of going theough previous top posts, and from all the people disagreeing with you, I guess I'll assume you're full of it. Unless of course all of these were sorted in new, which I wouldn't know since I only casually view this subreddit by hot
---
Prime example of why Spine Chill is a staple for me.
---
same dlc?
---
I hate it. As killer you either don’t get to use it to its full effect or you feel like an asshole for booting someone out of the match with 2k bp and a depip. As survivor you either get tunnelled to death or have to play super immersed. It’s not much fun for either side.
---
I’ll bring my love to share with the killer so that it will leave me just like everyone else does
---
:(
---
You're right! Man, that reminds me, I need to catch up on some Wentworth.
---
thank you so much
---
Don’t you mean “should”? Seriously, killers with Wal Mart connection hit through windows and pallets, make you moonwalk/moonrun, cause disconnects resulting in fewer survivors on a team, actions such as unhooking take several seconds longer... being a laggy killer in this game is stronger than having every perk equipped.
---
It's a good build. It's not 100% Meta, but that's honestly not too bad. Running Addy, Dead Hard, DS, and BT every single game is extremely boring. It's always nice to have some variety in perks, I run Bond myself because it gives a really good amount of map knowledge. Know which gens you can get done faster if you see someone on them already, See if someone is close enough to a hook to grab them without getting to the hook and wasting that time, finding people to heal you, etc.
---
The cringe goes both ways.
---
There's really no point to the chat box in the game tbh
---
I totally understand the need for music as a queue, but I needed to capture this as NOT breaking him out. It’s so awful to play against.
---
Why even message them about it? It just makes you look stupid
---
Sprint burst sucks lmao
---
I gotcha, still awful if that’s the case. Thanks!
---
Tyde isn’t a Fog Whisperer, he got declined. I’d assume that’s probably added a lot to his negativity towards the game.
---
*exasperated sigh*
---
This is cute, Also a decent all around perk build.
---
There's shine of secrets and she's playing on his account too...
---
He just doesn’t enjoy the game.  From the way he speaks of DBD to the content he uploads(3 weeks of deathgarden)you can tell he’s not as invested anymore. 
---
I don’t wanna go the “mad cuz bad” route because that’s too easy of an excuse. He’s been playing for too long and he’s not the only person who complains about this game
---
Comparing this bug to wake up is inaccurate. Wake ups cause was known, no one knows exactly what’s causing the survivor issues. This will simply take longer to solve, don’t act like fixing wake up is “catering to killers”
---
She’s level 10, Dead Hard came from the Shrine of Secrets, and kindred/borrowed time are universal perks.
---
Almost like bragging rights, almost the same as getting prestige on a character.
---
Remember when it was specifically for taking trappers power away? Lmao fun times
---
The issue is that a significant amount of the community;
---
1) Only play one side, so have a narrow perspective
---
2) Believe in made up rules that benefit them, and are vindicated by other similar individuals
---
 
---
And on top of that;
---
3) As an asymmetrical horror, some facets of the game are inherently unbalanced, but rather than see the bigger picture and see that both sides have powerful game features, they'd rather gripe about it.
---
Gather these together, and place them in an online forum that is infamous for bandwaggoning in some subreddits, and hey presto, you have a melting pot of entitled little shitwheels who refuse to understand perspectives that don't come out of their hollow heads.
---
This is why I think people who only play survivor tend to be toxic more of then people who only play killer. When someone D/C's or survivors just don't do well, killers can be nice and avoid people who just got saved or give the last person hatch. Survivors have absolutely no pity for any killer and will rush gens and teabag in the gate. I absolutely hate when I play survivor and no one gets hooked because a lot of the time I won't even pip. When that happens, I like to find the killer and try to let them chase me so they can practice their chases, and I don't really care if I die because I wouldn't pip either way anyway.
---
Oh ok but what’s the max?
---
I don’t understand this, legion just keeps people injured all game, other than that he’s literally just an m1 killer, idk what you mean by instadowns, because legion is no where near that, and legion is one of the worst killers in the game rn
---
That's what we used...usually we wouldn't be getting out on the first try but for whatever reason, we all did. No luck offerings were tossed, and no up the ante or slippery meat was used
---
I couldnt r it didnt work
---
You could find a 4 man gen (rare sometimes but still) and have a freddy wake up Roulette minigame,
---
Yes and I always view body blocking as free hits.  I've slugged more than a few people thanks to body blocking so I feel it's already countered.  Iron Grasp just takes up a perk slot for something else.
---
I see devotion as a way to see how much you play DBD. Like some people have devotion 6 and some people have devotion 0 but level 65.
---
&gt; It counters all invis killers such as Spirit and Wraith. 
---
You mean **both** invis killers. And you're saying that you struggle to detect Wraith? He's literally a walking blob. Small Game counters both Trapper and Hag, does that mean I should run it?
---
&gt; It gives you a head start to run. 
---
So does paying attention.
---
&gt; It lets you know the killer is walking your direction, 
---
So does paying attention and noticing the terror radius is getting louder.
---
&gt; And it also lets you know if the killer is chasing someone.   
---
&gt; Think about it, if SC is going on and off, what do you think is happening? The killer is chasing someone 
---
That's a bit of a stretch, it could just as easily be a killer looking for a survivor.
---
Yeah just recently started playing Ghostface and never played against him. I was genuinely shocked that it tells me the direction of who's looking at me then gives a big "THIS GUY FREAKEN SAW YOU" indicator when he/she breaks ur stealth. Its the one way to defend yourself against Ghostface, why must you be punished for it?
---
Did the survivor wiggle off? Pls tell me how it ended
---
Fly kick someone's nan. That's amazing
---
Nah, sorry. Doesn't.
---
Survivors do all the gens so often though. 
---
A killer can only be in one place at a time so you can get the totem, unhook or exit if they are hovering around one of them. 
---
I don’t understand why anyone would have disdain for less skilled or newer players on both sides using things the game offers to try and win if they feel they need the help in a particular area. 
---
I can understand disdain for skilled players abusing powerful tools because they make winning easy. 
---
You can’t treat everyone that uses a perk the same because there’s always a massive variety in the rank, skill, playtime and available perks/items/addons of the people using it.
---
Well, that all depends on what kind of horror you're talking about. If we're talking 70s/80s horror;
---
Dwight - Friendly nerd, will die, but quite a ways into the film
---
Meg - Pretty decent at staying alive, fair shot at Final Girl
---
Claudette - Nerdy, black AND sweet? Don't expect her to live.
---
Jake - Decent survival techniques, expect him to show off his survival skills and be swiftly killed to show that the killer is a force to be reckoned with.
---
Nea - Not exactly slasher fodder, but not quite right for Final Girl
---
Laurie - Pretty obvious. Expect her to only be attacked after her friends are dead or otherwise incapacitated, and to narrowly escape death.
---
Ace - Comic relief characters tend to die about halfway through classic slasher flicks, expect him to meet a gristly end.
---
Bill - You'd think a grizzled veteran would survive for a while right? Wrong. 
---
Feng - Hard to say, but I don't see her as Final Girl
---
David - Are you kidding me? This asshole will, at most, get a brief scene alluding to hidden depths beyond being a bully, before he meets his end.
---
Quentin - Fuck knows, this gremlin boy barely survived his own slasher film.
---
Tapp - A cop? In a slasher film? A BLACK cop? You get three guesses what happens to this guy, and two of 'em don't count.
---
Kate - Blonde, pure and beautiful, pretty fair chance of being Final Girl. Oh, and expect her to witness some fucked up shit, i.e Sally Hardesty, Texas Chainsaw Massacre
---
Adam - Intelligent guy, pretty decent chance of steering away from most of the slashing.
---
Jeff - Friendly guy. Expect him to either bite the dust in a tearjerking death, or survive with the Final Girl.
---
Jane - Honestly, no clue.
---
Ash - This asshole will survive, seemingly through sheer luck. Expect him to have sixty shades of shit kicked out of him though.
---
If we're talking 90s and 00's horror, disregard all of the previous rules, almost anyone except the final girl is fair game, and in more recent years, not even she's safe.
---
You a bitch
---
This is some Supernova tier burn. Someone's gonna need to sweep up the ashes.
---
I'm a PC player but I think Borrowed Time isn't a Bill perk and is just a regular one
---
[Detection zone](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c30b34/roughly_the_range_needed_to_reveal_ghost_face/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app)  this post makes it seem the the detection area is way bigger then it is but in reality it's about a 1/4 inch around your character models head  and then once it starts the detection area increases to what that post says it is. It's definitely a little better now after the 3.01 patch but they're definitely gonna make it bigger.
---
Ghostface you sick fuck
---
I completely disagree but thats ok
---
That sounds fun
---
I play on Xbone so the Halloween chapter didn't make it on until 2017
---
I'm treating it with optimistic caution. I'm more fine with it being bad since its a new cast. I hope it's good though
---
when your dad is working on the car and your shining the light at the car and he keeps getting angry because you cant hold it still
---
&gt;What I mean is you either spend hours healing and mending, or you just mend and stay injured to cut out the monotony of holding M1 all game to heal, at which point you're 1-hit-down all game.
---
This is why you don't heal against Legion... He will easily put you back in injured state.
---
Nurse is the same on console as she is on pc. Change my mind
---
What
---
I suck as Plague, but I main her, spirit, and pig
---
Bit in shit taste, this.
---
[This is what I am talking about](https://streamable.com/tseg4) and SADLY it's extremely COMMON
---
This would be sick for like a halloween night thing.
---
hitboxes aren't broken. being hit through pallets and windows is by desing. The killer can still hit you one step after a fast vault. sometimes latency makes it seem like you'll get hit after 2 steps, but it's still by design. getting hit through a pallet is predictable. most killers time their attacks to they down you and get the pallet down at the same time. learn to play and to not throw the pallet when the killer is too close.
---
I wish they would change it so when you’re actually cleansing a totem, it doesn’t keep activating every few seconds! :’)
---
I always look away because the noise gets annoying but I’ve been caught off guard a few times because I’m not looking :)
---
please don't
---
That's literally what he is saying. By doing that, you are essentially granting the Legion 1 hit downs.
---
It would be gamebreaking though. The tradeoff of being unable to see well is that you're stealthy. 
---
If killers could be in 3rd person, it would break the game because at that point, survivors would have a near impossible time hiding effectively
---
Oh god, you're one of those 'downvote because I disagree with you' people. Jesus... I'll respond once and move on, because there's zero chance I'll get anything worthwhile out of debating this with you.
---
&gt; You mean both invis killers.
---
You're forgetting about Freddy as well. There are other killers SC soft-counters, such as Myers and Billy. Billy is more mad specific such as Haddonfield. However, SC does not counter Nurse. But, then again, not many perks counter her as is.
---
&gt; So does paying attention.
---
This doesn't work in the beginning of the match when killers run Monitor and Abuse. They get far too close at times and can result in a quick down. This is detrimental as survivors and gives the killer a huge starting advantage. Avoiding that or extending the chase is well worth it.
---
&gt; So does paying attention and noticing the terror radius is getting louder.
---
See above.
---
&gt; That's a bit of a stretch, it could just as easily be a killer looking for a survivor.
---
It isn't a bit of a stretch and it doesn't matter. The point stands, it lets you know what's happening by acting as mini bond. If it's going on and off, then you know the killer is either on someone or trying to find them. Either way, this lets you know that you're safe [for now] and can continue doing what you're doing. If it lights up and stays that way, that's your queue to run.
---
I was 100% right in the type of person you are. Your response was 'just pay attention'. Gee, thanks. I'm sure that'll help new players that try DbD for the first time. Hey, guys, just pay attention! It's that easy! You can respond all you like and downvote all you like, but make sure to keep in mind you are that person that brings down the community. Those toxic people that give this game a bad rep? You're part of it. Congrats, you've wasted your parents time and money, and grew up to become something not worth talking to.
---
Ok! Screenshot is very helpful actually. Thanks! 
---
Not many of these guys at red and purple ranks, but I get sparked by them if I do something like this trying to figure the counterplay.
---
same here
---
I am not throwing the pallet when he is too close because it is waste of pallet. But I guess we are Bethesda now...
---
That’s a latency issue. If you where there on his screen he wouldn’t have been able to it you. But due to horrible net coding on his screen and probably server side too, you where still in the window.
---
Horrible
---
Yeah you're right, it just sucks bugs like this still haven't been fixed yet
---
Also don’t go into lockers after the person has been hooked. If killer has BBQ&amp;chili they just saw you go into it and just have to come yank you out by the ponytail
---
I mean, devs must know that by now, right? Why wouldn't they do ANYTHING against toxicity? It would be so easy. Do they profit from it somehow?
---
I thought it just removed your hitbox so it should be impossible to get hit during it. Though I do know sometimes it glitches out, though I think that be caused by getting hit on the same frame you dead hard causing both events to happen, but your hitbox hasn't yet been removed.
---
I tried Nurse a few times ... my goodness was I terrible!
---
dude, this is a medium vault. he could even hit you there if you fastvaulted, you didn't even make a step, this is totally normal
---
What's does the white circle do?
---
Even though they can sometimes be toxic, I learned a lot from watching Monto and Noob playing as survivor. They do a good job of kiting and juking. Also playing killer and losing people in chases helps give you a perspective of what the killer sees.
---
no it was an example they are all there :3
---
Again, I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just commenting about the design of the new Legion, be it worse or not. Also, you don't have to quote my entire comment every time you want to reply.
---
To be fair NOED is no more toxic than the crutch perks survivors run. Get over it, it’s just a perk not the end of the world.
---
Go [here](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/65822/year-3-anniversary-activity-schedule#latest) and scroll all the way down for a cosplay guide by the Devs.
---
I think it was about deranking. Scott's girlfriend, Jendenise, would DC sometimes. She happens to be a fog whisperer. Tydetyme argued that as a fog whisperer, she should be acting as a role model or something. I could be wrong.
---
There's a clip of one of the devs saying that EAC does not detect it and that you will never get banned for it unless EAC starts checking anything other than the ENCRYPTED PAK files, and it has no reason to change. They are 100% safe and anyone who says they were banned purely for custom icons is lying, intentionally or unintentionally.
---
Congrats!
---
Yeah, I got him cause I thought he would be fun to play as and I watched all the movies, not disappointed.
---
You get use to it
---
This was posted already
---
Someone’s got to educate them. 
---
Not to be rude, but you replied back to me here with a negative reaction, are you any better?
---
Oh no sad kitty ):
---
I'm honestly fine with increased fov when crouched as the pig and a higher camera angle.( Spirts map HAS SOME TALL ASS GRASS AND I'M SICK OF IT)
---
You're*
---
That's all I would have said
---
Your not the scum of the earth tho. Survivor main shit on the nurse because she's the only one and maybe the spirit that they can't be toxic with and they actually have to use Thier brains to win.
---
Thank's for down-voting me on a genuine question and being passive aggressive towards me for asking it. I don't care enough about the game to watch anything the devs say either, so i couldn't possibly know that.
---
I don't really play killer at all but if I were to guess which one's I'd hate it would probably be Decisive, or Dead Hard. 
---
As a survivor I don't like BBQ at all, or nurses calling. BBQ doesn't bother me if the person hooked has Kindred because I can kind of see what direction they're heading in. So nurses calling would probably be the worst for me.
---
I hope they do like fortnite. U can use the same account on console/Pc but its hard cause the Pc version its different of console version.. then idk
---
What is wrong with NOED. I dont get why people cry over the perk. If you dont cleanse totems then you deserve to get smacked. Totems are objectives/mechanics that are utilized so why is that such a big problem.
---
I literally have the word “honey” in my bio and I wanted to die reading that lol.
---
V cool :) I'm at 1/2 mill rn
---
Its not me, its these surv mains who say Hexes are hard to find, i have played at every level and rank and I know how to find theme as well as how to protect them.
---
That Nea(?) has the same haircut I'm going for. Only down to my chin so far :(
---
True. No matter how much I love BHVR and the effort they're putting into the game, they arent very good at balancing. I get it's a difficult thing to do with two entirely different playstyles, but there are some things that are very underpowered or very overpowered
---
Stealth ace blends into things pretty nicely. And he used to have a built in iron will
---
Yeah, but I would recommend not touching him until his rework so you don’t get used to his power now
---
This game would hugely benefit from Xbox/PS4 gameplay - although I’m not sure I’d want crossplay with switch and PC (too casual/too tryhard :p)
---
Bond, Spine Chill, and Sprint Burst are all good, but okay.
---
What have you brought into this cursed land?
---
"This is Ghostface, you have to look at him."  
---
"Okay."  
---
"BUT DON'T LOOK AT HIM!"  
---
"..."
---
Ahhh, I'll have to try to put him down then. For a bit.
---
Their theme slaps and Susie has the biggest dick
---
Exactly. Wiggling... toxic???? It’s a key game mechanic
---
The thing I hate about noed is the fact that the killer will have no skill whatsoever, and get 1 hook because they're bad, and then they'll kill everyone endgame just because of a crutch perk. Noed basically teaches newer players that it's okay to be bad because you can just use a crutch perk to get kills instead.
---
I didn't downvote you, I wasn't passive aggressive, and I didn't imply that you had to have seen the clip of the dev talking about it. I only saw it myself when someone sent it me the other week. Stop acting so defensive, pal. It looks pathetic.
---
You can't bring that, but you can bring a killer that already loves You, or a king crab or a kinky lady ;)
---
Just did, see you didn't bring one
---
So... you he never said what was wrong with your "a dick"
---
Reasons I never directly say anything negative to them unless they throw the first punch (and even then I hold back on my responding fists)
---
Maybe make an addon that"Tremendously reduces the audio and visual cue of being marked". If it was a part of his base power it would be too strong. With it being addon there could be a downside to using it as well. If not it'd probably be stronger than spirits prayer beads.
---
I don't have to believe you  
---
You were, and are now  
---
I never said you did. I'm just confirming I haven't  
---
Now your definitely being passive aggressive.
---
And you are the child in the picture :)
---
I liked the concept of playing as a stealth killer like Ghostface but in his current buggy state it wouldn’t feel right playing as him
---
I just did, see, you didn't bring one! And I'm not a libtard :p I've run over cars in the middle East with an Amphibious Assault vehicle just because I could :p
---
Does Open handed pair up with Boiled over? I was thinking of using them both but I dont know if the work together
---
I honestly don't need you to believe me, so if you want to make yourself a victim, go ahead and be one. It really doesn't affect me. 
---
you're*
---
Yeah but I would recommend still leveling up jis bloodwebs for bloodwarden which If is activated anywhere after the 1 minute mark in the endgame is an immediate 4k
---
Do you know how he extracted the animations? Id love to be able to have them and use as reference. Im literally doing a legion one right now
---
Nope. But they prob also do it for points though you get a decent amount and if you know how to save someone by flashlight ez stacks in wglf
---
I'm pretty sure I have blood warden, like rank 2 I think.
---
I agree on that!
---
I think one game that does it well that I also play is Paladins. It's crossplay with Xbox/Switch, but if you want to opt in to PC players as well, the console players have that ability to turn it on/off. 
---
So ideally, not sure how hard it'd be, Xbox/PS4 would crossplay (with Switch), but if any of the console wants to crossplay with PC, they could turn it on in the menu.
---
Duuuuuude barely made it omg I just witnessed a legend
---
All I know is he used blender, I know you can extract the files by using umodel to unpack the dbd pak file which has all the models and stuff in there.
---
Removed for salty after game chat

Jesus, do I have to type the webpage address from an image on my phone or some good fellow will actually link it? I'd like to read how to  do that 😊

*jojo phose at killer as meggy with explosive thingy
---
Crossplay and Crossprogression would be nice, but I think Crossprogression tends to be on the platform side for decisions.
---
So if I was on Xbox and wanted to add my stuff to PC, there would have to be some agreement between Steam and Microsoft (I think). Sony tends to be pretty strict on allowing that based on history of games, and Fortnite is the odd one out since it's such a behemoth of a game.
---
Nah, it’s for taking big poo poos.
---
Don’t worry about it
---
Oh yeah, true. I started on Xbone in early October of 2017, so that explains why I forgot about that, lol.
---
Great escape
---
change green range to yellow, much better
---
Report them
---
No way that would be way to damn strong
---
I am a decimatory spirit :/

lol remember killers losing their goddamn mind over d strike good times
---
In case you don't get it, here's a fun fact: When Michael is in Tier 3 Evil Within, his left hand is normally closed, forming a fist. However, if he's running a tombstone add-on, his left hand will be open.

---
This happened to me the other day (without the message though.) I was doing a generator, and off in the distance I see that little bitch Nea Karlsson pointing in my direction. Didn't really think anything of it, and next thing I know Ghostface comes raining hell on me. Downs me after a pretty short chase, and the nea comes and teabags until I die. Jokes on her though. I just ran out of my adult drink and that gave me time to go make another one lol
---
The top one is how it's supposed to work and the bottom one is how it actually works. I'm saying BHVR should have it work how it says, or change the perk description.
---
We did
---
I did. Won’t do a thing.
---
When you become exposed from Ghost Face, do you know you’re exposed?
---
Imagine weird Al hair glitching and freaking out and the killer seeing it half a map away
---
How is the description you said different in any way? I’m not seeing it.

I must learn about the magic tuck.
---
as a 4 man swf my friends and i always have someone running spine chill and someone running small game. it makes life so much easier when at red ranks the constant ruin and sneak killers become tedious. and at this point we dont really need self care or an exhaustion perk even when solo playing.
---
Thank you for your kind words, but I still have so much to learn, especially looping killers. Just gotta practice more.
---
you might get "safe unhook", but if they are being chased, it wasn't so safe, was it?
---
&lt;3
---
I will bring Amanda then
---
Does sloppy affect snapping out? I was playing against a doctor and the snap out action was slowed down even though there were no addons for it.
---
Good video, man! Keep on making them.
---
Dude what its still not gonna work
---
Trust me if she whipped it out the dedicated servers would come to life
---
Video doesn't show much. Myers moonwalking after getting 2 sacrifices.
---
Sometimes survivors are pretty toxic...Not saying you are OP, but I wouldn't be surprised  if you brought this on yourselves.
---
Oh shit guys we got a rank 6 badass over here watch out
---
that's actually not true. it's based on his movement speed. if he's playing Play With Your Food and it's stacked, he'll have his hand closed.
---
also, if on console, he might not be running at his full speed
---
I'll stay in killer parties with my friends while we're playing and we'll be talking and our spirit main will load into a game and immediately leave lol
---
Ever seen Billy sprinting? That's what he's running after.
---
This isn't a bug. GF wasn't nearly in the center of their screen, unfortunately. I understand people want to angle the camera down for better situational awareness, but that's not how he works.
---
well not anymore
---
Sure and I want chainsaws to make no noise, a silent Wailing Bell on Wraith, no ambush roar on Pig, no tier up sound on Myers, no lullaby on Freddy, no windup sound on Huntress, no vomit sound on Plague, no haunting sound on Spirit and Rusty Shackles default on Hag.
---
Not a Killer main, btw.
---
I’m bringing one right now
---
He just cries a lot honestly and for what I seen he’s sorta a asshole in my opinion
---
Thought that the notification meant killer didn’t find them?
---
I have other clips but could only show one. How exactly would I have brought this on myself?
---
Actually, from what I've looked on the wiki, it seems to be both.
---
"Each Token increases how much he clenches his left hand into a fist if he's in a stance that features a relaxed left hand."
---
"The angle at which he holds his knife on Evil Within III changes and the relaxed hand shows his readiness to grab Survivors"
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
*censored due to killer main being triggered that NOED is considered a Noob perk.*
---
Your talking in context of a SWF where you can communicate, thus only needing one person running a specific perk.
---
What's wrong with Bond and Spine Chill? 
---
Spine Chill hard counters every stealth Killer besides Tier 1 Michael and Bond prevents you from sandbagging your teammates while in a chase.
---
There even was the sacrificing sound at the end
---
Amazing play, I'd be lost and frankly angry as killer lmao
---
True although I love watching his videos and twitch I sometimes find him sorta hypercritcle on some stuff but like I said still enjoy his content
---
He didn't even see it, with how they timed the BM. He was too busy looking at his trap.
---
Nah, the entity will get mad for not getting that thicc booty
---
Exactly
---
It gets better, I found that practicing with a friend who knows a few different mechanics can help, especially with faking and how to do loops, everyone has their playstyle and you just have to find yours :)
---
I'm starting to achieve multiple 4k games in a row, and last night was my crowning achievement. I'm only at lvl 13, I was up against a 3-man swf team who were roughly around lvl 10, and hilariously, one AFK Claudette.
---
The swf team body blocked the whole game. I have no problem seeing someone take hits for teammates, but blocking hooks drives me insane. Then, I see one of them in a tight corner, healing. I run in, whack them as they finish, they run through me, and I try to turn and run after them, but I can't move forward. I realize after 3 seconds, one of them was body blocking me into that corner, crouched.
---
So I'm annoyed by their buffoonery, but I still manage to kill two of the swf team and the AFK for points. I stomp the hatch closed, find the last player, and proceed to chase him, zapping his ass as the Doctor. Endgame collapse takes him, and I got four super salty messages from him.
---
Your skill will get better, trust me. You just have to accept the salt from pissy survivors at those ranks.
---
And you're just a cunt.
---
It's not this subreddit, the picture is now on the internet as a whole. This post/image won't just be here anymore.
---
That’s the meg tbagging me lol
---
Even killers want dedicated servers
---
I did get a survey after completing the PTB though.
---
I will always attempt to complete 1 before looking for the totem. It's honestly helped me get better at my greats. If I finish that generator, I'll run around a bit to look for it, but if I can't find it right away I might attempt to do another. Ruin used to bug me, but because my greats got better I don't mind as much.
---
Wiki isn't always correct. the actual reason is his movement speed and the fact that tombstone makes his movement speed lower.
---
I just used 5 gateau and got half a million, then got bored and wanted to prestige immediately.
---
that means they didn't get downed in I think it's 10 seconds after the unhook
---
Literally could've grabbed him off the switch lol
---
I play e. G. the new Tomb Raiders, new AC titles and Deathgarden, all on at least medium settings, and they all run just fine

It just means they were not hit within that period.  Even if they’re moments away from being hit, you’ll still get “safe unhook”.  That said, there are plenty of instances where it can be worth getting a relatively unsafe rescue that aren’t just farming.  Like, if you save someone being camped moments before they hit the struggle phase, even if they do end up going down quickly they’ll just be at the struggle phase, so you cost them nothing.  Especially if you run Borrowed Time, less safe rescues can still be totally worth it.
---
Safe unhook notification only means that they went that big of time without being hit. Not that they aren’t being tunneled. Wait until the killers heartbeat is gone, then rescue. Generally farming off the hook is when you are in the middle of a chase and you unhook someone.
---
i use noed on hag because it's a really fun perk and does a better job than ruin pls dont kill me :(
---
Notification means they didnt take damage for 10 seconds after you unhook. If they get downed within 10 seconds of that you prob caused it by doing an unsafe unhook unless they ran straight in the direction the killer went away from the hook cause that happens low rank and aint your fault.
---
sometimes survivors on my team look at my profile and call me a "baby survivor" but then i wonder why im in the same game as them on their team if they're so good
---
No, unlocked in other killers bloodwebs
---
That shack has some trouble if you touch that window. It seems like people get desynced a lot and end up in that corner. You're usually supposed to teleport to your actual location after the hit, but sometimes if just lines you up with what the killer sees.
---
No lag switching or internet issues here, unfortunately. Just the game bugging out.
---
Or even smack him normally. Literally anything would have been smarter than vomitting on a non infected survivor.
---
I know, right! I was like, “NOOOO WAY.”
---
There’s one thing I’ve learned: You do not rush EGC as killers expect you to rush and make rash decisions. Rushing EGC has always cost me my life so far. So I try to be calmer now and predict their next move, try to guess where they’re at, which is why I was waiting in the locker until he started revving up his chainsaw. I had to make sure he was not near the school.
---
True but it's obvious the irrogant devs don't care about NOED as of right now, or else it would have been changed already. Salty survivors need an outlet for their anger and unfortunately the people using NOED are the closest thing.
---
it's supposed to be a salt circle, and salt circles are "known" to keep demons, ghosts and evil out
---
Don't say anything about a good old fashioned maniac with a knife, though.
---
You see the imbalance of that?
---
If a surv makes a mistake, let him go. Lose the game, its cool
---
But survs dont bring flashlights.
---
But keep bringing toolboxes, insta heals, pallet stun save survs, tea bag, 
---
Jk lol big meme. Cmon guy.
---
Same.  That was my game of the year when it came out and still in my top 5
---
I just forgot about that lemme edit it
---
What's wrong with Flashlights? If you manage to perform a flashlight save, that takes skill and good timing.
---
I don't really get why everyones chat is so bad. I know 20% of the messages are from some 12 year old kid that apparently fucked your dead mother, but at least 80% of all messages I get are positive.
---
Yeah that post was basically: "its ok to flame and harass NOED players if they are veterans"
---
Like how about dont harass anyone for their perk choice?
---
Me trying to learn nurse 😅
---
And it’s scummy tho
---
Clapped and tapped
---
I’ve seen a lot of people say he’s broken and needs a rework but how? Is this just salty survivor mains? I *very* rarely get less then three kills, especially when I roll with a black box/class photo + paint brush. I get trolled way more on him than I do the pig, but still, he’s fun as hell and I also don’t get why his difficulty is hard... lol
---
I dont agree with that but dude if it works for you then rock that NOED

Why is repeating the content of the video funny?
---
Boi, you think that's bad? Imagine going to level 50+ and not get self care, not even level 1. That's what happend to my P3 Nea, still I have no self care.
---
I wouldn't normally run Self Care, but, relying on teammates is a bigger RNG factor than Trappy Boi. (I have 0 friends playing this game, one of them hates the game to bits, and the other, thinks it's 2 scary or some shit.) And since I am only leveling up killers right now (mostly God... Ghostface and Bubba for BBQ, Ghostface because he just became my main, he's a blast to play as) I can't really get med kits for those few times I get a survivor daily that I want to complete.
---
I have mixed feelings about it. On one side I like the potential power it has in permanently slowing down the game for the rest of the match. But on the other I hate how it encourages tunnelling/camping in order to utilize it.
---
What changed from v1?
---
Absolutely loved that. "This exit's broken? Maybe the other one will work!"
---
Relatively new to the game. Just been playing a month. Ghost Face is ridiculous. Are they going to nerf him? Only character I've never beaten. Can't hear him coming, super fast, and a one hit KO. Wtf? What drawback does that character have?
---
Does it really? Why is that?
---
Survivors making mistakes is literally the only way you can catch them. If you let people go for making mistakes you'd lose every game, doesn't matter what items they have.
---
Unclear whether you're talking about the totem, the gen, the tile, or what.
---
Girls can be part of the boys
---
I want it balanced on both sides cause I play both. I am devotion 6, I play this game. Go ahead and tell me how unfair I am being asking the bugs to be fixed on both sides. You just want to argue for the sake of arguing and to that I say piss off.
---
Ghostface, I had an experience when I was running from him and I lost him. I kept checking behind me and I look ahead at the long hallway in front of me (lerys) and almost as soon as I did I saw his head pop around the corner and he charged at me... To this day I get paranoid starting up a game on Lerys
---
~1400 total hours checking in.
---
Games I say that are the games I usually end up getting cocky and die :)
---
Don’t beat yourself up and just keep playing as you would
---
Honestly I have nothing but respect for console Nurses. Getting those precise blinks down is hard on MnK. I can't imagine trying to do it on a controller.
---
You Can't, but you can bring King, David or Kate!
---
I’m down with this, pig wasn’t amazing before end game collapse and now she even weaker than before, any buffs to her would be appreciated
---
Never said I wasn’t fine with it, I was just notifying him. I really don’t care
---
It affects every surv you hit until they are fully healed
---
How are flashlights toxic?
---
Dude I played against a noob killer and it was so fun, in the end I let them kill me because they were trying their best and deserved it
---
Lmfao so true
---
What’s wrong with this loadout?
---
I know I seriously love hearing the music when he’s near, because Halloween is one of my favorite horror films and it’s just so cool to have Michael and Laurie in Dead by Daylight.
---
Wiggling isn't toxic but some killers will decide if they are gonna hook you or give you hatch based on if you wiggle or not. Also 99% of the time you wont be wiggling out unless someone body blocks for you. When in doubt wiggle but end game or as the last survivor just dont bother.
---
I’ve just gotten 80 grand bp and safety pip for being nice you can always try being nice :)
---
Lol im the 1,100 upvoter
---
Even though I agree that the detection is kind of buggy I find it hilarious that you just kind of stood there. 
---
Especially considering that ghostface probably wasn't even aware that you are around until you just walked up in front of him
---
Nah I’m just tired of sweating
---
Your dumb and you should have run
---
I mean if it did that would be broken.
---
That's a report.
---
But it literally says that good skill checks will get a regression penalty...
---
This post is making fun of people like you
---
The only thing bubba has over billy is the ability to multihit, which can be quite useful sometimes.
---
Other than that survivors are just more careless against bubba, since they don't see him as a threat i guess.
---
Lastly bubba is easier to control than billy, you don't have to focus as much as when you are trying to snipe around corners.
---
only skill cap &amp; LF is better for camp
---
Apparently they want you to not slug so as to give other survivors a chance. This is what I have been told when I was incredulous(?) over someone claiming slugging was toxic.
---
You just proved how common these posts are (not very)
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbvYeLxMKN8
---
Just loop him into Adrenaline, like you do with every other M1 killer.
---
And he can't injure the entire team if you are spread out.
---
It makes it slower for others to heal you because it is a "deeper wound" so all that blood makes for good lubrication so harder to get under control.
---
Same. Literally just bought the game. 
---
But that's why the first thing I do with any new online multiplayer...is turn off the chat.
---
Make the game sooo much better.
---
Now if only i could get better lobby wait times
---
I've begun to main him. I used to use Wraith or Myers for stealth play, but I feel with Ghostface, he has so many mechanics to use on survivors, no matter the situation.
---
He has Myers stealth and damage and Pigs crouch, but both abilities are slightly different, for my preferred play.
---
Let me guess, you just got moried?
---
Dude that's not even bad at all lmfao. I was rank 12 killer and I got que'd with rank 1-5 survivors literally happens all the time
---
My moneys on the russian woman who killed germans as they entered her forest.
---
The whole tile is just stupid; gen in the corner, totem in a really bad spot
---
You really opened my eyes
---
You're a cunt to.
---
It's true lol
---
He can still expose you while you are staring at him. Also the hit box for it is wonky as fuck. You shouldn't be standing still trying to get him out of stealth. Run away and force him to chase so you can knock him out easier. If you knock him out but hes been running right at you the whole time you'll just get stabbed for your trouble lol.
---
Legion is the best one imo
---
How do you nurse ? Am confuzzled on which walls are actually walls
---
You can try asking on the discord server of competitive teams like Legacy, Quantum, Prisma etc. , "DbD League", "DbD Comp" or "Heavy Rock Tournaments" discord servers. Quite sure they are willing to participate if the tournament is well made.
---
That must really suck lmao
---
About 12 to rank 4or 5 is say is good to average
---
You know it's not always the killer right? It's the servers 99 percent of the time
---
You legit just reworded it, it's all the same, kid.
---
can someone tell me what those perks do, i don't play nurse.
---
NGL, that was a good pun.
---
It would be
---
Imma be honest and say that I’ve done that before to try to counter bloodwarden lmfaoo
---
So then what does that make the people who can't counter it? lmao
---
Hey don't let these bitch survivor mains drag you down once you get nurse down you will crush them
---
Open Handed only increases your aura reading ability,it has no effect on the killers aura reading ability.
---
I'll play nice if they leave my ruin alone and fail every skillcheck on every gen.
---
Lithe, spine chill, resilience and decisive strike
---
Use literally whatever it takes to 3-4k honestly the survivors have some insanely busted perks too so don't listen to them talk shit
---
&gt;I do and I think that's fine. Makes me think you don't play killer
---
Not only I play a lot of killer but I also spend an even bigger amount of time watching killer streams (zubat, ryan, scorpionz, umbra, fudge).
---
Only by playing survivor you get to understand how annoying most of the stuff suggested here is and only by playing killer you know that it isn't as hard as some people claim.
---
Exactly, that's what I said
---
If you use perks you're trash.
---
My God how many times have I been looped at the hook and then had the injured guy run into me while I was chasing someone else. Most of the time I ignore them assuming they have borrowed time but God knows if I didnt I would get the camper message. More than I already do of course.
---
Yeah it slows the game down a little and ruins them if they don't
---
Why does it take so long to find a match as a killer? Is everyone just playing killer now? Is it the same in all ranks?
---
Agreed
---
That's a meme build and a half :D
---
^^i ^^hope
---
I've seen it all by how much I've played. Not saying this was you, but an example:
---
You and another buddy try farming your teammates, sandbag them, etc. Killer notices and fucks you guys over instead. Let's other player free. You report killer at match end. 
---
Again, you didn't provide any relevant video so no one has any idea what happened. Could be a survivor who fucked you all over. Who knows.
---
... With Prayer Beads you can't hear her
---
Head on apply directly to the forehead
---
If someone self heals to completion in front of me I will leave them to die on hook every time.
---
Wait, theirs a calk circle, where is it?
---
If you play DBD you’re trash
---
Your build looks like fun :)
---
Depends entirely on multiple variables. I'm generally nice. But if you flashlight spam me or teabag at me you are gonna go on the hook and if I see you directly after you git unhooked I'm hitting you. Now if a teammate is just being a cock and farming you then I'll let you leave. But buddy I cannot tell you how many times I'll chase someone. Down them. Hook them. Wander back to the hook someone else got pulled down from and they are less than 28 meters away self caring. Yeah you are going back on the hook. I've been gone for a good 20 seconds since you got unhooked this is what happens.
---
Mad Grit is an awful perk until it suddenly becomes the best perk in the game. It's really weird.
---
I’ve always thought about a Wendigo killer in this game, it would fit perfectly
---
Just had a game earlier today as killer.  1 survivor was dead, 2 were hooked right beside each other and the exit was open...so I stayed with the two hooked people.  
---
I got a series of messages telling me how I'm the type of person who runs the game for everyone.  
---
I get that it sucks being camped, but in the late game it's like I can either get the two kills guaranteed or risk losing them both for a guy who is standing right beside the exit for all I know.
---
Meg after being unhooked.
---

Balanced landing, do I have to say anymore

Are you on mobile? If you are then look at reddit not in the app and you will see on the left of the DbD page an option to add a icon and a phrase or nickname for this sub that won't appear in other subs.
---
I personally like how Bubba's chainsaw feels more than Billy's, but Billy is far and away the better killer. Billy is in the top three killer, Bubba is in the bottom three.
---
It really is. :) I’m not confident in looping or 360/180ing killers yet, so this is a decent method to throw killers off and waste their time.
---
He isn't fun 1.because he is terrible his power literally makes the game harder than just a standard m1 killer. 
---
2.because being asleep is an eye sore and makes it extremely hard too see for both killer and survivor
---
3.he always gets hate from low rank survivor as he seems very strong until you learn his counter than he is a useless killer he is in far a way the worst killer in the game if
---
If you are somehow being really successful with him fair play but he needs a rework too buff him and make him less annoying not nerf him!
---
At what date do the annual events starts
---
Welcome :) doesnt get easier :)
---
Thx :)
---
I get called so many things it’s unbelievable. I wish they would just remove it honestly. If I hide it and leave, they start to send me friend requests asking why I’m too pussy to explain myself for playing like this or that. It’s disgusting. I hate the toxic chat at the end.
---
Most welcome. See you in the fog
---
I suppose.
---
They aren't really a measure of actual skill realistically, you can reach rank 1 without being some kind of god.
---
If you're getting 2K in your matches you're doing the average (survivor escape rate is at or above 50%). More than that is above average. The more important part is if you're having fun, really.
---
Quick question: when and why does gf sprint sometimes?
---
Can confirm we didn't farm our teammates
---
Am I the only person who calls it a chest cause I'm almost certain the game calls it chests too
---
Yeah it’s like every single surviver acts like they have so much more entitlement than the killer. Would u not do the same that late in the game? It’s one thing if all the gens weren’t done or the gate wasn’t open yet, but like it’s not worth risking all those np and tanks just cuz some survivors an entitled bitch
---
Quick follow up because, obvi, I didn't know this either: if I go online and do it, will it appear in Mobile by my name? I assume but, ya know what they say about assuming.....don't do it, that's what they say
---
This, can not stress it any more than this.
---
This is hilarious. Then of course they abuse the killer for camping you when they're *literally standing right there near the hook.* Like what do you expect the killer to do, just AFK while you unhook them, heal and leave? lmao.
---
I feel bad for survivors i hook who end up with teams who do this.
---
Myers without a doubt, I mean, you are working on a gen, you do a skill check, look around you and out of the corner of you eye, you see a tall dude, just looking at you, doing nothing. He was not there before, but now he is observing, and it's just out right terrifying
---
That escalated quickly. LOL!
---
I’m actually alright at survivor apart from dodging killers.
---
Only if Nea was half as pretty as this girl, lol
---
I feel it. I don't fucking care if you have Adrenaline, this will take a total of 6 seconds, there's still 3 gens left and its a fucking Spirit, we need to be smart with our health.
---
Feels bad man :(
---
Ass twitching 100%
---
Fuck I want swimsuit myers
---
Thank you
---
New killer leak: The Shadow.
---
I don’t see what is wrong with the game other than queue times and hit detection.
---
Yeah but still it hard to learn against a rank 3
---
Happened to me today, had to go out by the endgame collapse
---
The Entity letting you know he's always watching.
---
It is easy to understand, but It’s hard to practice against rank 10s and 3s
---
I have 500h and I still respect noobs
---
Got to love toxic players
---
Ok thank you for telling me where to go to find some more people
---
Because the two are totally comparable. 
---
Wheres my free health state for doing absolutely nothing but getting hooked twice? Oh right I actually have to do my objective to earn my adrenaline.
---
I’m a survivor main and either the survivor talks about how campy the killer was and toxicity ensues or the killer says things like “gg ez” after a 3k or he Mori’s a couple of us. I’m normally leaving immediately, but my issue is I like seeing everyone’s build, and that chat box is RIGHT THERE
---
&gt;When it's plague and everyone throws the game by cleansing every time they get sick
---
How does this "throw the game?" Asking for a friend.
---
Same, I never try to be toxic. It is kind of hard when the killer camps you though
---
It’s a niche perk, that’s what makes it great
---
Because you have eyes, a 360 degree camera, and a terror radius. It's a waste of an entire perk slot as having even an inkling of situation awareness would benefit you far more.
---
Haha I can’t loop as survivor, and I can’t counter it as killer
---
You also forgot praising any killer is fine so long as that killer is the Hag.
---
It’s most likely because of deranking, which is really annoying
---
Like the OP said you answered with a whole crap ton of opinion. You also assumed so much from the O comment.
---
Also I don't want to be that girl.. but it's "To".. not "Too" in the way you are using it. Please know the difference. If you don't, please Google it.
---
*The real question is..*
---
What would be their Pokemon? 
---
You know Nea got that Toxicroak.
---
"cosplayers"
---
Yeah I feel bad when I go up against killers that have little to no experience
---
You know I really thought this was gonna be a good debate then you have to whine about some damn arrows. I downvoted you because your reply was completely opinionated.
---
1 is opinion. 2 is aesthetic and therefore not a good reason to call him bad for either side. If it’s that big of a deal, fix your video settings. 3 what’s the counter?
---
Thank you for the “fair play” comment though :)
---
Thanks for the motivation
---
Treatment theatre and the game
---
Same. But than again the game is super broken
---
What does it dooo?
---
Good man
---
I mean your wrong about that I play both survivor and killer there just because they have DS keep in mind that means you've hooked them within 60 seconds of the door being opened and them being unhooked so really if they can use it to get out they do deserve it quit being an entitled killer thinking just because you down someone doesn't mean you deserve the kills
---
Available at wallgreens
---
Combo of potato matchmaking and everyone playing killer. Lots of Ghostfaces still running about.
---
i had this happen when I went back to look at the spot where a survivor got downed and they had been healed up
---
My friends are all survivor mains so I try to queue into them
---
My problem with this is that there is 0 chance of not triggering the trap when she places it next to a hook.
---
You approach crouched but then 1 of us is forced to stand for a second which triggers it
---
As much as I would want to that would break the game
---
That’s how he does in the movie... he does sprint during his chase.
---
That’s one of those “That’s a good one to end on” games.
---
As I said, GF is not strong anough to need a so badly nerf as you propose, but each of us have the right to complain, so I guess it's ok we have different point of views

Walking/crouching when the killer is on the opposite side of the map
---
Help me understand
---
&gt; Spine chill literally negates every stealth killer in the game 
---
Oh so 3 killers, great.
---
&gt; counters M&amp;A 
---
There's absolutely no guarantee killer will run this, so this point is invalid. It's like running Small Game just because you *may* get a Trapper.
---
&gt;and allows you to pretty much play the entire match without worry of getting caught off guard 
---
Yeah, so does being situationally aware.
---
Ding dong, your opinion is wrong.
---
Oh no not the almighty safety pip and the bloodpoints that rely entirely on offerings
---
Tgey didn't rework it. They changed how it worked between tiers but otherwise It is the same at Tier 3 as before.
---
And it isn't the same.
---
I've heard of having an ace up your sleeve but having a flashlight up your Ace?
---
Welcome to reddit
---
Yeah because running a perk that counters Wraith, Pig, Ghostface, Myers, Hag, Spirit, and Doctor to some extent is a bad idea. Tufffffff.
---
This was my experience up to about rank 16. I don't know why low ELO survivors with 1000 hours are so toxic to newbies but god damn.
---
Well played!
---
I had a similar experience once and I had to take a break because I could literally hear my heart bumping.
---
Its the add on combo called "omegablink" and its fairly overpowered
---
Thank you! Someone who understands what I'm saying!
---
True
---
But did you escape?
---
Self care doesn’t hinder anything. If one plays like how I described, you’ll know the general area where they will be after waking up. 
---
**awareness is key**. I also apologize for sounding like a broken message but I think tier lists are opinion. 
---
I would only admit I’m wrong if someone brought me undeniable evidence that he is a garbage killer by design (rather than people not being able to play him efficiently) **OR** if I consistently get two or less kills against purples and reds, which I do not.
---
the fucking trapper is perfect lmao
---
Gotta have ruin to atleast gimme a chance
---
Matchmaking is ahhhhhhs
---
If you ever see a small child who says he's lost, always ignore him. It could be a trick.
---
Well I guess I can't change your mind this ends here for me
---
I think a smart killer would have checked the locker.
---
I mean I personally don’t think either are BAD perks. Certainly not the worst. I had to run Spine Chill recently because I had nothing else on Kate and with all the Spirits at red ranks it was a lot easier seeing if they were phasing or not. It’s good for other killers too, and the action speed boost can come in clutch. 
---
Small game is also good for new players. Like literally of all the perks I’d pick “better” ones to mock.
---
Hell if I know lol
---
As the only Killer main in my party of 12, I wish I had other killers to complain with.
---
Be like that sometimes
---
just posted it check my profile on here :)
---
I wanted to DC from a game today.
---
There was one guy on a gen, one guy hooked, one guy being chased by the huntress near the hook.
---
I wanted to save, but they were too close, so I simply took the aggro and lured the huntress away. after quite a while I got downed and I noticed the guy I took the aggro off selfcaring in the opposite corner of the map. the hooked guy died.
---
Later that game, the self-carer got hooked in the basement. Call me a dick, but I stood at the stairs, preventing the remaining guy to save this piece of shit of a person.
---
The top one says that. That's the description that's in-game.
---
The bottom one is an accurate description of how works Ruin.
---
I'm saying they should either adopt an accurate description for Ruin or just change the perk to work like it's description. I don't care which they choose, but as of right now, the description is wrong.
---
When I had no experience as a killer, I was able to destroy survivors. Probably since I was a survivor main and I knew what they would do
---
yes when he is in chase
---
Bro I just got legion (saved up shards) it took me a while but I think it’s going to be worth it
---
Lol loved that movie
---
i believe in u &lt;3
---
But the description is accurate....
---
I dont hate NOED, I hate my dogshit teammates that dont cleanse totems
---
Wraith is literally a big walking blob, your blind if you can't see him.
---
The pig breathes louder than a fucking generator, so you're obviously deaf.
---
You can hear Ghostface's leather rustle when he's near you.
---
Myers? He's not a stealth killer. Sure he has a lower TR, but in no way does that affect your ability to **see** him.
---
Hag? What?
---
Pay attention to the ground foliage on the ground for the Spirit, or, you know, listen to the rustling of her phasing.
---
Doctor? Again, what?
---
That’s a repost, at least give a shoutout
---
And that’s how Ebony Mori-Nurse mains are made 😊
---
Killer is raging. Love it
---
It’s a lot harder now that the game has been out for like 3 years
---
The fucker with long fingers
---
The Huntress is a very good killer but is probably the weakest out of all the 110% movement speed killers.
---
Her hatchets allow her to take advantage of short wall loops and with skill can allow her to apply serious map pressure to survivors. All of the add-ons are pretty decent which all help with different situations for Huntress. 
---
She takes alot of practice but when you invest time into her she becomes one of if not the strongest slugging killer in the game as her hatchets allow her to take control of large areas of land, especially with high ground. 
---
- At base you will start with 5 hatchets. 
---
- When charging a hatchet she slows down drastically, running at 78.5% base movement speed. Charging a hatchet will make the hatchet go further and travel faster. 
---
- You hear a noise when you reach full hatchet charge. The sound can be heard by survivors from a moderate distance.
---
- You can put hatchets you are charging away with the attack button. 
---
- You make an audible humming sound that can be heard from a minimum of 40 meters. It gets louder for survivors the closer you are though it's difficult to judge the distance. A recent update has made the humming non-directional so survivors will not be able to discern the direction you are coming from. 
---
- Hitting a survivor anywhere with the hatchet will deal one state of damage. 
---
- There is an Ultra rare add-on called iridescent head. That add-on makes all hatchet hits instantly down survivors. It reduces the capacity of hatchets you can hold by 4 leaving you with the ability to only hold 1 hatchet at a time. You can circumvent this with a very rare add-on called the infantry belt. It allows you to hold 2 more hatchets.

Here is a guide to play Huntress made by a very skilled dbd player.

---
Wait until you actually start killing them and see how much more toxic they get
---
I do that, and it's because I'll hit the queue button then go off to do something such as grabbing a snack, some water, etc... I didn't really think of it as an issue seeing as not everyone is instantly ready the moment they join because they might be changing perks, ad-ons, etc...
---
That will be the day
---
I'm not mad, I'm more annoyed. And that's not what I'm talking about.
---
The top perk description is Ruins accurate in-game description.
---
The bottom on is what Ruins perk description would be if it actually described what Ruin does.
---
I'm saying BHVR should either adopt the bottom description, since it would be accurate. Or keep their current description, the top one, and change how Ruin acts In-game to match it.
---
I'd just like to point out he might have stacked add-ons! Which is why you didn't break his power.
---
Literally all my friends are killer mains. We all suck hot shit at survivor so we all complain together
---
Looks like a bird box leatherface to me.
---
Ya I get that, hell I’ve been guilty of it. But ever since the ghost face update it’s been a consistent thing. I haven’t played one game the past few days where everyone readied up
---
I agree with you there spirit is amazing
---
Especially when you cleansed all but or 2🤦‍♀️
---
Thank you! Someone who understands!
---
Gameplay wise, I believe survivor is much more stressful (that's just cause I'm a puss tho). Aftergame, however, I agree with wholeheartedly. In no other game have I ever been worried about be mass reported because I stayed in one spot for a second to long. I've literally been comm banned on xbox because I played legion before his nerf.
---
No survivor I’ve played against has tried this on me, which is sad because I want to pretend it won’t let me past.
---
Lol I get shit for using NOED but nothing gets me as much grief as running self-care.
---
He's definitely not "fun". Not remotely scary either. Glad you think he is but no. And they need to change his irritating music.
---
It isn't. When you hit a Good Skill Check against Ruin in-game, what happens?
---
Oh gees... I run this build but I never get salty messages. I do have a little bit of mercy and will give survivors hatch and/or let them get more bp just so they don't feel like it's a waste of time.
---
I wish the devs would make certain parts of the game less fun to play against like Noed. Searching for all the totems can absolutely screw your team if the killer doesn't have Noed, and Noed is a perk that is currently too strong for the amount of effort required to get it. At least survivors have to survive to get Adrenaline.
---
Preach! The going down and seeing everyone around the map crouched behind something/crates/etc. doing nothing -.- I'm like gens need to get done for us to get out lol
---
Well there a few perks out there, of which I'm sure you and I have never ran but someone out there thinks it's absolutely impossible to play without haha. So we'll just agree to disagree.
---
Dude, the Hag and Nurse are ridiculously adorable.
---
What perks do you run?
---
As I’ve said in previous posts there is no FPS cap on the starting screen so your ps4 keeps trying to get better FPS meanwhile making your ps4 sound like its about to take off nothing wrong with your ps4 mine does it too and it’s the only game I have that does it
---
Could you not hear him breathing lmao
---
I once got downed behind that, and the killer could NOT pick me up lol. They fell off the roof like 6 times trying to get to me.
---
Bad job by the killer.
---
Noed is fine, but noed on a one shot killer is tad bit sad and funny.
---
Personally I want him to have a completely different Power. His current one is boring useless and feels lazy. How long has it been since we've had a High Mobility killer? Or a killer with a high skill cap? Or even a killer that has instadown capabilities? Or an M2 attack that actually does something different?
---
The inconsistency of his attacks make him incredibly unfun to play against. He's like a shity version of Myers and the pig. When he doesn't do what either of them do nearly half as good as the originals.
---
He's not as I'm fun to play against as the Legion or doctor but those killers are supposed to be annoying
---
A good pig is terrifying. You never see them coming until it's too late and the panic when you just can't find the key is real.
---
Repost tho. From like 2 weeks ago at that.
---
I see what you mean now I guess but you should make the cleansing function differently just like all the other examples you listed do.
---
She's the 4th/5th strongest killer in competition between hag. A strong Huntress is scary some of her addons are ridiculous. I mean she is really powerful if you play her right. I recommend watching Umbra bug if you want to see how strong Huntress is.
---
Personally I think ghost face should have Locker teleportation, allowing him to fast travel through lockers. I also think that his main power should be somewhat tied to what he does in the movies. Which is just chase people with a knife or call them and get in their heads. Which unfortunately seems very hard to translate to the game but what we have right now is just worthless disappointing and Incredibly lame.
---
AFAIK it doesn't change how fast you heal others. 
---
On a side note it also only affects "speed" of healing. I.E. you don't actually need more medkit juice to heal someone who is mangled, just the juice flows in at a slower rate. I sort of wish it did require more healing although it'd make brown medkits useless if the killer had sloppy butcher because that wouldn't be enough for a single self-heal.
---
Why would they need to change the music of a licensed killer when it’s literally his “terror music” in the movie(s).
---

---
On topic you're a fucking degenerate if you derank as Survivor. Like I hate the high rank Survivor experience as well but I don't derank because I'd rather have mildly unfun games then ruin the game for others.
---
Long shall be your suffering.  Joyous be your pain.
---
A SHADOW OF A MAN!
---
That's the thing they could have hit a good one and got the regression ruin notifies you if you fail the skill check i know because I use ruin
---
Your mom is..
---
Meg mains be like *Meg noises*
---
This is kind of funny but I can see why you’re mad 😂
---
oh for some reason i couldn't see aura of hooked survivors or dying survivors after it was destroyed so i was wondering.
---
thank you.
---
Farm me then blame the killer for tunneling. Like dude, your the bad one that rescued me in front of the killer without BT. I guess it annoys me because it’s ignorant like the rest of the shit people do on a daily basis.
---
Next would be going to phase 2 while I watch urban evasion Claudette hide her way towards me on hook.
---
Current bug with survivors getting sacrificed. They go all translucent black like that, and sometimes their models can be seen t-posing randomly in the vicinity of where they were put on death-hook.
---
head on and sprint burst
---
1000 iq
---
Hell, I might have to use Myers more
---
So no you cant.
---
God this reminds me of this one Nea who refused to heal or be healed against a Nurse when we were at 3 gens.
---
The best part? She didn't even fucking have Adrenaline. Bitch you're not going to do 3 gens and open the gates while injured without running into the Killer again. You don't even have Iron Will or Resilience are you suffering from a mental illness?
---
Killer perk
---
It’s a perk for her. It makes it so that when she downs someone, everyone in her terror radius screams.
---
he played it horribly
---
Noed on Nurse is just sweaty
---
No...it's not
---
If he was any good he would have tried to saw you all at the gate.
---
DI MOLTO
---
Killers want survivors to feel bad running Adrenaline so....
---
The killer you played against was The Plague. You kept screaming because of a perk she has called Infectious Fright. If you’re in her terror radius when she downs a survivor, you scream giving away your location.
---
Heyy. I love Plague! My build with her is Monitor and Abuse, Barbecue and Chilli, Surveillance, and Ruin.
---
it's called infectious fright and it only activates if youre in her terror radius
---
nothing
---
Ooh that would explain a lot. Thanks for responding so quickly!
---
DbD is just a pile of bugs that resembles a game.
---
hi thank you for my life i didnt know i needed pokemon meg but god damn i needed pokemon meg
---
Totally makes sense now, cause it would never happen against other killers
---
Literally me, I haven't been able to play a single game on double BP, now I can train my nurse on PS4 since all survivors are potatoes.
---
it couldve been some other blindness effect, some killers have add ons that cause it
---
Perks like what? Im legitimately asking.
---
Head On immediately gives you exhaustion, so you can't just go into stuff like Sprint Burst. That'd be broken, anyway.
---
Yay I love taking jabs at people who want to play the game their own way. So much fun and will definitely change how they play in the future when they see it.
---
Is there a way to know how big her radius is? Or do you just gotta high tail it when she's about to down someone?
---
I don’t think any veteran player believes in “respectable ranks”. I actually think most killers whose played this game prefers being anything besides red rank TBH. Ranking up is just time based. If you play a lot of killer or survivor, you’ll reach red ranks.
---
Exactly what I’m doing, I decided to do my daily’s and got 3 4k’s in a row because everyone is like 4/5 ranks above where I’d usually be
---
I'm sorry, what?
---
You are misunderstanding me.
---
If a Survivors missing or fails a Skill Check while Ruin is active. It acts just as if you normally miss it.
---
If a Survivors hits a Good Skill Check while affected by Ruin, it is counted as a failed Skill Check, minus the Generator explosion and Loud Noise Indicator.
---
That's why a Survivor need a to wait after hitting a Good Skill Check and why they receive no Bloodpoints for it.
---
You escaped death my friend, and no one escapes death
---
ah i see, thank you.
---
all you need to do is edit the Benny Hill song over that clip and you will have gold lmao
---
I just clickety clack with it to greet fellow survivors
---
That’s the other variant the huntard
---
But then again, theres no suspense like there is with Myers of when hes going to hit his tier 3, no hatchets to dodge, no vomit to avoid, no traps to disarm, no cloaking ability to watch out for.....hes just a guy that leaves you injured or healing all game.
---
What a dull power.
---
Do you mean by in a chase or in general?
---
I had 0 idea that Heaf On was an exhaustion perk, ngl
---
I can understand why you can feel anxiety about performing poorly in a game like this. I was very much the same when I started playing survivor because I felt I would be terrible to the team if I didnt perform well.
---
For starting off in the game you will want to go through the game's tutorial and learn the basic aspects of the game, namely scratch marks and hooking survivors. 
---
Going through the survivor tutorial will give you an idea of the survivor perspective and allow you to understand the red stain and terror radius. 
---
Once you have finished with the tutorials, dont worry to much on what you spend your bp on. Even if you perform poorly in a match then you will still gain some bp if you break gens or some pallets along the way. 
---
Starting off as the plague is a good way to gain an understanding of the maps and how pallets function. 
---
the majority of the 115% movement speed killers will have to deal with pallets and looping from the survivors. Getting a basic understanding of how to chase survivors properly will do you well for playing any other killer in the game and let you gain an understanding of how survivors think.
---
The Hag is one of the stronger killers in the game but requires a significantly different playstyle than most other killers. As such you might want to spend some time with the easier to understand killer then move onto the Hag.
---
Custom icons. You can download packs icon packs. The devs have said they are ok with it, but if EAC randomly decides to change their mind on it and ban you. They won't help getting you unbanned. But to date I don't think a single person has been banned for it. Even twitch streamers have their own icon packs.
---
Just use STBFL. The survivors will cut that shit out real quick once they realize they're handing you free tokens.
---
People who don’t know how to cleanse totems
---
**"Yeah, this is big brain time"**
---
Yes exactly. I wanna be like was this dude running such and such perk he had to have it and then it’s just like “way to camp”
---
Personally I prestige all of my characters once I've exhausted their good items, add-ons, and offerings. It keeps a sense of accomplishment and pushes me forward when the game starts to wear a little on me. Once you reach PIII, you're all done and can live up the perk benefits
---
I looked a lot for that and normally there is no problem and me personally I play with the mod
---
I don’t agree with you at all. Legion is garbage tier. However, one thing I will agree with is because he’s a garbage tier killer, he needs a rework. Like a real rework, not some few tweaks like last “rework”.
---
Nice work, Doctor
---
Spirit and the Pig
---
Real talk, I have no clue why, but people seem to consistently miss that totem for some reason, even when the gen is directly on top of it. It's pretty great when I'm playing a full-hex hag build, and DH or Ruin end up in that corner.
---
The meta perk issue is much worse.
---
For survivors, most of the meta stuff is on the base characters. (Self Care, Sprint Burst, Dead Hard, Borrowed Time, etc.) Meaning you'll need to BP grind at the worst.
---
For killers, a bunch of the meta perks are for DLC killers. (Spirit Fury, Pop goes the weasel, Ruin, BBQ, etc.) Meaning if you're a broke motherfucker like me you have to pray to the shrine every week only to get spat in the face with fucking enduring for the millionth time. (I know spirit fury was on it not too long ago, I missed it like a dumbass.)
---
You can get out of it if an injured survivor slow-vaults the pallet and you grab them. I did it once to help out a killer that was getting run around by a SWF 3 group, and I was rewarded by being basement camped :^)
---
Thanks, I'm starting to assume a 4k will net a message.
---
Yes, it's definitely in the top 15 survivor perks, considering most of them are hot garbage. Again, just increase your situational awareness and **you don't need the perk**. I don't know how else to say it.
---
I feel like it's a little too niche to be useful, but honestly is pretty harmless
---
stay strong my brother, our iridescent pins will block out the sun,
---
Quote; literally nobody ever
---
dude, just wtf.
---
this thread was about me juking a killer with a frickin' crate...
---
Usually it will. I play on console and get invited to so many parties. I was running double engravings on Billy (it practically doubles his speed on the saw) and got accused of speed hacking like bitch. We're on console lmao
---
Ummm that's not how ruin is to work tho it doesn't count it as a fail it just gives you no bloodpoints a failed skill check refuses like 7 % of a gen this just puts it back by 3%
---
Actually the other way around, nothing beats heavy metal.
---
I swear, no game in the history of the world has had so many people who complain about it non-stop but still play it all the time lol
---
Unless they're running black incense. Then that strategy is crap.
---
Though to be fair a strategy that relies on leaving yourself crippled isn't a super great one.
---
"Increase your situational awareness", We've been through this, being aware of your surroundings works some of the time, but there's a decent percentage of the time where you're gonna get chased because Wraith bing bongs around a corner outta nowhere and it all could've been avoided with Spine Chill.
---
Depends.
---
For bloodpoint efficiency, defo keep adding to a level 50 and don't prestige. You'll end up finding the missing perks and eventually you'll get a better chance of finding newer perks there.
---
For game enjoyment, I chose to prestige. Who doesn't like a bloody cosmetic? (P.S. If you don't then seriously don't prestige) Plus it's nice to feel a sense of leveling up bc in a way doing it at level 50 lowkey feels like a waste because you see no visual progression.
---
What I did was save up 1,000,000 and then poured them into my (now P1) David which got him to about level 44 and then a couple levels after that he was usable and had loads of gateaus so now I have all the perks I wanted. 
---
Just note: depends how many teachable perks you have in total. I have a decent amount but notbing crazy so it only took a few extra bloodeebs are P1 50 to finish the main good perks. I intend on prestiging him again when I use all his items and I save up 1,000,000. But the more perks the less likely you are to find specific ones.
---
I don't get stressed as either role, but I do find killer more relaxing. I get more bloodpoints, nothing can end my game. I just stroll around and kill until the match ends. As a survivor, you can get found and your game can end immediately.
---
Don't read the post-game chat? Also, you can set your profile to public, but also disable comments to anyone but friends. So people can see your steam profile info, but can't spam your wall.
---
Saw you getting ready to hop that fence at the end, lucky you noticed Q&amp;Q was still cooling off. Nice escape!
---
Yeah.. I remember one game in particular. Failed 2 skill checks, I leave the gen and get a 3rd i miss while moving away. The rest of the game I had a bloody Meg stalking me with her spam clicking flashlight..
---
Congrats
---
Have you noticed more rare items in your bloodwebs after your prestige?
---
Only way to one shot is to use an ultra rare addon. Headshots are the same as body shots. 
---
Huntress basically has a rock paper scissors mindgame at every pallet when she catches up to a survivor. Basically, she can swing through the pallet like any normal killer. The survivor can read this and place the pallet down for a stun. Huntress can read this and instead of swinging, wind up a hatchet and if the survivor puts it down it's a guaranteed easy hatchet hit. If the survivor reads this, they can stop briefly but then just keep running through the pallet and they get to keep looping. BUT if Huntress reads this she just swings through the pallet and the cycle repeats. 
---
It's extremely important to mix up your choices in this mindgame wisely. If you simply think "okay hes gonna throw this down and ill hatchet him" a survivor can stay on a single pallet for an insane amount of time. You need to call the bluff and just run through M1 them sometimes. Also, it's a bit of a funky build but if you run Enduring+Spirit Fury on huntress it basically makes every 3rd pallet unmindgameable for the survivors because you can just run through and if they think youre going to throw a hatchet they keep running and die. And if they think you are going to run through they break the pallet on you and they still die. And if they make the pallet before you can get stunned you can just react to the spacing and hatchet instead.
---
Yeh fair, just popped into my head for no reason haha. At first I thought about it with deliverance and instantly regretted fathoming such a toxic meta so yeh
---
No idea how this bug even surfaced. Anyone know of any occurrences before the "Escape" change?
---
Oh lawd, you are ON IT! I will definitely take all of this into consideration! Thanks for the help!
---
The shit people say is insane. Humorous though.
---
the skill gap between yellow ranks and even green ranks in dead by daylight is massive. once you "unlock" looping around like rank 12 the game becomes so different, and if you are playing against people who know how to loop when you don't you're just going to get decimated. it kinda sucks
---
