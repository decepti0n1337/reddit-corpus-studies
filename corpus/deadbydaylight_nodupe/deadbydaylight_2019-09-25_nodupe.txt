I've found that most Red Ranks tend towards the upper level of assholery.

Lery's is unique, so is haddonfield

Fuck double bp anyway, all it does is fill the lobby with casuals who are only playing for the double bp, resulting in less games over time and less fun in those games in general
---
YES DS
---
Happened another 4 or 5 times this evening. Shit is so fucking annoying.
---
I like how the cat matches the all-black Ghost Face aesthetic.
---
haha, fuck you. Really though, play out the game at least somewhat, like DCing just fucks over the whole rest of your group.
---
Yeeeah boi gimme that DS
---
That's a scene right out of lotr
---
Except with how DBD is built, it pretty much is.
---
You gotya be kidding me, i just leveled up laurie yesterday, fuck everything
---
All i heard is that those killers perks will just be in the bloodweb. No word if they will ever come
---
Beautiful

&gt; red rank killers get more but much easier lobbies, which is probably also boring.
---
Not red rank yet, but I am getting more and more matches where one or two players are *significantly* less skilled than the rest. I feel bad for solo survivors who climbed out of low ranks just to get stuck with newbies anyways because of SWF.
---
Happened to me with BBQ, and was about to lvl up Laurie a few days ago.
---
Lets fucking go bro. 500 hours in game without ds till now (I dont wanna spend IRL money feelsbad)
---
Dude... With the chainsaw? Now that's an image to imagine.
---
Yep. It was totally bugged I guess. I can imagine it's going to be great with thanatophobia now though on the plague
---
Its your prerogative to leave the lobby if you want. But its been shown through data that survival rate barely increases and is still under 50% for 4 man SWFs across all ranks. Its really not as big of a deal as its made out to be.
---
Wha-
---
I started doing this as soon dying light was changed and quickly realized that it was the culprit crashing my game. My build consist of: Dying light, Thanathobia, Nurses, Butcher
---
YESSSS I DONT HAVE TO BUY THE HALLOWEEN DLC
---
My man lmao
---
I could. I can never kill a Jake Park though. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Not because I won't, but because they're sneaky as all Hell, and rare to see.
---
Yeah, every major player agreeing that it's definitely buggy doesn't matter, it's totally just me not figuring it out.
---
&gt;viable
---
You should do fine with all killers, and be more than fine with so-called “viable” ones.
---
Free 150k bp tho
---
Spongebob if i remember correctly
---
Annnd no Discordance yet again, but four perks that I already own instead. Great.
---
lol
---
No change in rank. Didn't gain or lose a pip.
---
I hope to see Freddy at the very least. Thank you for your response
---
FINALLY DS. This is truly EPIC
---
Sweet now I don't have to level up Laurie
---
Except they're both in the same game, so yes, it's double standards and I hate it fiercely.
---
Get outta here with all this logical thinking. Lol but seriously though, I totally agree.
---
Someone just posted a fix to remove this change 7 threads before yours. You could've done a quick look through the sub before making this post.
---
They added this change to fix (or mask) the problem regarding how hairs looked on low settings.
---
Press x to doubt
---
"Fair" is relative. Some perks in game also might not be "fair" yet they exist. 
---
SWF is a feature that developers created and put it in the game with that intention. If they didn´t want people to play like this, they would simply not create group play and only have solo queue. 
---
But by all means, continue being petty and quit against SWFs.
---
You’re not a dick the survivors are being unnecessarily toxic, however dodging lobbies is for noobs m8.
---
Yeah I have sh*t internet =(
---
I hate when this happens, like for real, I spend money on the character, and spent like 10  hours leveling her up, should've just waited, and tbh DS feels lame to me now.
---
*googles emitophilia”
---
Do you know when or just that they’re gonna do it?
---
This is a troll I assume?
---
it's a pretty decent port, not as pretty as I expected but it runs relatively well. takes no time to load in as a survivor but for a killer, it can take like 2-5 minutes. I'm not disappointed in my purchase but they really should've thrown in plague and legion because of the $40 price point. it's just a visually lesser port of dbd nothing really out of the ordinary or broken about it.
---
Say sike right now
---
Checked the box, they aren't even there, what can I do?
---
I've been stomped by Killers and survivors who have taken a year off the game or even months. You don't lose all of your skill or forget how to Loop and if skill checks.
---
All of that is invalid as well because someone who has been a rank 1 Survivor consistently taking a couple months off ... Shouldn't be matched against a rank 20 killer. They're going to destroy them.
---
Also no one forces you to play survive with friends. Especially with rank differences. What you're saying is the dream scenario but most of the time unfortunately one person in the group intentionally Deranks and then the rest join him so they can bully baby killers.
---
There is absolutely no reason at all a purple rank or red rank should go against a yellow or gray rank killer. Especially with the inherent advantage of voice communication and coordination with teammates.
---
One red rank can run a killer who doesn't know any better around the map for five generators. Especially if the team knows that that is happening and can focus on them without worrying.
---
Besides. I hear all the time that people are just playing with friends to have fun. Who cares if you win or lose? It's not a competitive game. Just a multiplayer horror game. There should be a consequence for having massive rank gaps in a survive with friends group. Instead of destroying all fun for that killer and making that killer probably waste add-ons or offerings and put them off of the game for a while. Especially when they get trash talked by somebody of a much higher rank
---
If u wanna play Killer, the perk Barbeque and Chili is great for blinding bloodpoints to level up quicker, and also an all around great perk. Whilst on PC and Console it’s a DLC exclusive, it seems that on the Switch it’s available to be unlocked from the beginning.
---
Well, it finally happened. RIP killers
---
Quick and simple.Thanks
---
I've actually really been wanting Coulrophorbia, its the last thing I needed to create my anti heal Doc build. 
---
Distressing + Coulrophorbia + Sloppy + Nurses = Profit
---
Lmao wtf
---
Still not getting survival points when I survive!D:
---
But maybe it helps some people play better.
---
There have been a higher number of crashes lately
---
The way she shakes her head in disappointment at the end hahah!
---
Is coulrophobiaa good perk?
---
Final smash is a Ginyu Force type group attack.
---
this is first im hearing of that, and i play trapper all the time, huh
---
oh dear neptune
---
I'm sorry it's nothing against the shape I promise ;,,(
---
I mean, they aren't necessarily gaining an advantage since they're only getting around 5000 points, so idk about it being an exploit. It does kinda suck for the killer, and other survivors playing but not worse than a DC. I'm torn as to whether or not this is reportable or not, maybe just so BHVR is informed on the existence of this glitch if they somehow don't know already.
---
There’s no way around it, more ppl are swf than what you think. If you’re that thin skinned, you’re gonna have a bad time with DBD
---
Same. Also the matchmaking isn’t better. And someone crashed today in a lobby. So. This hotfix made me crash less but spend 100% of time played in lobby
---
You're acting like survive with friends groups are forced to play together. I had to learn the game playing solo and honestly it makes you better. You'll never improve at the game with red and purple ranks doing all of the heavy lifting while demolishing much lower rank killers.
---
You also seem to ignore the fact that people would have used the hell out of this and you're talking about an idealistic dream scenario. Most of the time it was one person who would be ranked intentionally and 3 High ranks. They would absolutely waste that Killers add-ons offerings and time. And ended up being the most toxic groups of bullies imaginable.
---
Besides. Rank reset should help with helping your low rank friends.
---
You do if you didn’t get that high in the first place, what if they only got to rank 15-10 the haven’t played in a year, I’m not saying they should join their rank one friends and the entire group plays a rank 20 killer but it’s also not fair for them to have to play a rank 1 killer either.
---
No no one does force people to play swf but for a lot of people it’s where the fun is in the game, no one forces anyone to play killer either but it’s what some people enjoy more. This new matchmaking encourages people to derank so they can play with their lower ranked friends without their friends getting destroyed.
---
I agree with you that they shouldn’t automatically play a rank 20 just because one of them is rank 20 and the rest are rank 1, that’s a stupid way of doing it and as I’ve said this new way is possibly better but it’s also not a good fix it just moves the unfairness somewhere else.
---
don't wanna deal with DS? just slug ez 
---
/s
---
Steve is clearly best girl 😐
---
Camping doesn't do anything but waste your time. While you're watching that one person on the hook, the others are completing generators. Know what situations to leave a chase. You're getting gen rushed because you're getting distracted by one person while the rest finish all the gens. Patrol the map around the gens and keep the pressure going. Force everyone off the generators.
---
Probably be on sale again for Halloween. October 31st.   They do sales like 4 times aa year. At least for steam.
---
So long as I get the shop keeper theme from Majoras mask, ill do it.
---
The shrine's cool and all but what's the name of that perk pack?
---
You realize it must suck for The Killers who can't see your rank and are trying to learn the game but get ran around for 5 generators by a rank 1.
---
Especially because when I was new at the game I would always have my items or offerings and add-ons Wasted by survive with friends groups that abused this mechanic. You'll never learn the game if you're being carried by a much higher rank. You learn the game by gradually moving up through the ranks instead of staying stagnant and getting carried
---
I leveled up Laurie ages ago though 😂
---
Hey welcome to the dbd community I have 2 tips for you
---
1. There are a lot of toxic people here killers and survivors that will do anything so the opposing side cant have fun.. Try to ignore them and dont let them ruin your experience
---
2. I higly suggest you get 2 perks
---
Bbq and chili for killer (it is a cannibal perk but you can get it for everyone when you level him up at lvl 35 or wait  for it to show up in shrine of secrets)
---
We are gonna live forever for survivor (david king perk same drill)
---
What these perks do? They essentially double up your bloodpoints per game.. So you need to farm for bloodpoints less
---
For the same reason try to play as m7ch as possible this weekend because it is a bloodhunt event (your bloodpoints get doubled)
---
I hope i helped.. If you need anything more ill be more than glad to help you. I am not the best but i know my way around the mechanics
---
*Exhaustion

"What if he's...a robot???"

---
That’s so shitty
---
&gt;In what world does losing a pip because a killer quits make sense? How is this still a thing? Behavior please get your shit together. Its little things like this that add up to people quitting the game.
---
Often times you don't lose a pip but people are too blind to notice it. You only lose it when the killer crashes or pulls the cable.
---
With a player base of this size, you can’t reasonably expect short queue times along with balanced matchmaking.
---
Awesome, thanks!
---
Shire... Baggins
---
I said usually. Lol.
---
I love you.
---
flair your post as meme, i cant even use memeless mode without this junk flying through.
---
Oh no. Your friends don't get carried by you anymore. And these poor Killers won't have the fear of losing items or offerings against survivors that might be a much higher rank and absolutely demolish them the whole match.
---
Toxic how
---
LOL
---
Newbie here... What is swf?
---
2 as survivor, 1 as killer so far; no problems
---
Yes they do. Its how the game gets balanced
---
Just because an X killer takes 5 minutes longer to learn should not justify their balance if they are OP or UP. Nurse straight up breaks the game and all of its mechanics. A good Spirit is nearly impossible to escape from too. Her power is just straight-up free hit every time her power regenerates. Combine her ability with gen stopping perks and you'll have games where either she gets completely obliterated or vice versa.
---
Well its either this or totally one-sided matches vs. noob killers, I'd rather this than what was going on before since this means people can't just bully noob killers to sate their ego.
---
Wanna play with friends without being at red ranks? Play KYF.
---
You only lose it when internet connection is interrupted. It's a visual glitch at the end of the match. Like not seeing your rank up when you actually did rank up.
---
You are guaranteed a safety whenever the killer disconnects
---
I've been getting this a lot too. Not sure what it is, but I'm constantly getting dc'd from games and lobbies.
---
The bus driver's name?
---
I wouldnt recommend playing nurse as a new killer. Have fun while your in newer ranks. She is one of the few dominate killers at high ranks. But if you do keep playing her. Nurses, Ruin, Barbecue and for the last perk you could use franklins, Make Your Choice, Infectious Fright(I personally recommend), NOED, or Pop.
---
Thanks man!! This really help. One question. Would it be possible to pull bbq from my blood web for nurse or do I need to grind on cannibal
---
Survive with friends
---
Survive With Friends.
---
Ffs right after I buy and level up laurie
---
Ypu think its that easy?
---
Go to a working gen, break it, look for survivor bam no one there, moves a bit, and they quixkly tapped it
---
Its too frustating
---
Nurse, basically run tracking perks. Since she blinks she doesn’t need anything to help her in a chase.
---
My favorite hag build is ruin, monitor and abuse, nurses calling, and save the best for last. Make your choice is also really good on her. To play her well, build a web of traps in one area of the map and make it yours. Let generators go on the other side and push them into your web. Don’t just put a million traps by a hook and gens, place them at choke points where you think survivors will run and be unpredictable. When chasing them towards a trap, span the teleport button.
---
As a survivor, I wish I would have gotten this advice when I started: don’t be afraid of getting caught and chased. This doesn’t mean throw yourself at the killer but don’t crouch away behind a tree every time you hear a heartbeat. Learn to make chases last as long as possible. You will suck at first but things will click after a while. Really good survivors will stay on generators until they get chased, then make the chase last.
---
Hope this helps!
---
Im the exact opposite. Im a killer main but am probably a rank 18 survivor that gets bmed for sucking
---
 Feels bad man, pretty much all gone
---
Joe
---
Illegal ain’t it? Gotta check the usage codes
---
I would definitely recommend checking out a lot of the prominent streamers or YouTubers that aren't too toxic. They really help you learn the more complex mechanics of the game as well as the basics and definitely made me as decent as I am currently
---
Otzdarva, Tru3Ta1ent, Puppers, Monto for example are all very helpful when learning the game.
---
And my best advice I can give for hag is that trap survivors in complicated webs. Do not Chase anyone for more than 30 seconds if you haven't landed a hit. She is a slow killer and has low Mobility. Meaning she's not good in chases.
---
Nurses the best killer in the game. Learn her without her add-ons and you won't even need them. Although her skill cap is extremely high and be prepared to have some miserable matches against really good survivors
---
&gt;Feature - Emblem System: The Emblem System has been developed as a way to evaluate your performance in a trial (affect your overall online rank) and to replace the previous victory conditions of the match. There are 4 different categories in which your performance is evaluated for both, Survivor and Killer
---
This is from the 1.9.4 patch notes. When they introduced emblems.
---
Pay attention to this specific quote.
---
&gt;to replace the previous victory conditions
---
&gt; EDIT: tutorial runs much better than the actual game :'''(
---
It's like that on all platforms, the tutorial is the only place on console you get 60fps
---
This is the most unlike me yet natural thing I’ve said
---
Im actually torn because kate is best girl, but steve and nancy are new best girls, i dont know who my heart belongs to now.
---
I run nurses with thrill of the hunt and noed. But I also am really bad with anyone that doesn't have a movement ability except from hag.
---
I think so I thought this would be the best place to make them aware of it maybe?
---
No you don’t understand the mechanic because you don’t look at patch notes
---
I just saw this comment when I made my own. Honestly Leatherface is very good in the low ranks and he has some cool Secrets. Like the fact that you can get a Survivor Skin Mask after killing that certain Survivor 25 times. Barbecue is very rarely in the shrine and I would recommend putting points into Bubba as soon as possible. It's legitimately double points every match
---
the BP from shrine perks is based off the perk price, 150k BP from 2k shards and 250k BP from 2.7k shards
---
Just email em under customer support directly
---
I play a ton of plague, her biggest weakness are the slow down when she charges, the fact after someone is broken she has nothing to help in chase, and probably the time it takes to infect someone.
---
Black pip... How did you know ?
---
I have the same issue with a friend that I just convinced to buy the game. I don't know about PC but we're on PS4 and I'm just going to create a new profile so that I can start from scratch to play with him.
---
A sample size of ~5000 sounds perfect
---
&gt;retty much all gone
---
ikr
---
I disagree wholeheartedly, just because you can do something doesn't make it fair in the slightest. In competitive games, especially ones with asymmetric multiplayer, it's everyone's responsibility to play both fairly and in non toxic manner.
---
Nah solo queuing. It's just really strange. The games are weird too because I'm trying to loop a killer who is as good as me whilst the others just run around learning the game, which is fair enough for them to do, but they should surely be together against a killer of their own.
---
Im not complaining about it, im just saying we dont need even more killers with no terror radius. We have quite a few now
---
You can’t expect people to play against a 4 man swf honestly, 
---
But yeah the matchmaking isn’t great at the moment.
---
Why does the game have to be balanced for survivors?  They should be afraid of the killer.
---
Thanks for your thoughtful reply
---
It's like a mega when they here just a little heartbeat sound
---
*Hey idiot? You just blow in from stupid town?*
---
Seriously though I would rather die with 20,000 points and a pip then escape with 10,000 points and no pip.
---
At rank one keeping your rank is all that matters. Doesn't matter if you escape.
---
Why not mention the fact that Adept killer is ridiculously difficult to get on some Killers for the average player while adepts Survivor takes literally no skill and you can hide the whole match.
---
What were they waiting for?
---
Great art style, love the locker Dwight.
---
Every Tuesday I think, decisive strikes on there
---
Tuesdays are reset days, i’m pretty sure
---
&gt; I'm 367 devotion
---
HOW
---
I thought I played this game too much and I'm only about to hit Devotion 2 lmao
---
He’s waiting for his Head On to get off cooldown
---
I would make the pallets map themed. For example push a hospital bed to block the way on Lery's or throw down a box on the game. I would also completely redesign hex totems and make them harder to find and destroy
---
I prefer the 2017 version of Pennywise honestly as his base outfit, but I would be fine with his old outfit as well.
---
Was your ass clenched too
---
I am waiting for 20, and looking at the same two survivors waiting for two more.
---
Maybe they sold it to them to use...
---
&gt;  takes 5 minutes longer to learn
---
Do I really need to explain myself? If you need broken killers to do well then maybe you're not as good as you think you are.
---
My problem as killer is being a rank 17 going against a purple rank 4 man swf
---
Well you get banned if you quit too many matches so I would probably recommend suiciding on hook.
---
The way you are reacting to this is just proof that you're someone who explains this and doesn't just want to have fun with friends. I'm sorry you lost your easy win and have to depip to get it.
---
  Also what about the killer who doesn't get to see ranks? Who gets put against for survivors on voice comes with each other. Three of which are much higher ranks and skill levels. That can't be fun? Especially when they get bullied the whole match and absolutely trashed
---
Sweet sweet plagiarism.
---
I’m definitely happy to be seeing killers with more mobility. I have so much fun with Spirit! 
---
As a survivor, it can be a pain sometimes if it is over and over again, but I do like the extra feeling of pressure and anxiety when I load into a game and 1-2 minutes in, I still haven’t heard a heartbeat. I always run Bond as well so seeing teammates crouching around and acting like a stealth killer is around always makes me extra hesitant. I’ve been playing a long time and Wraith still spooks me the most (other than Scratched Mirror Myers)
---
They weren't waiting. They had escaped technically but they passed through the gates and it didn't trigger the escape sequence. Common glitch currently
---
How often do you actually run into a 4man swf? The percentage is so low. And a bonus for playing against them bp wise? Sure that makes sense. But forcing people to have only tier 1 perks makes no sense. Having to cripple swf just so you can get a 4K means that you are either entitled for kills or you are allowing yourself to be run around enough for them to gen rush you.
---
Tim Currys Pennywise should be an cosmetic but this cosmetic should also change the Mori a bit imo. With 2017 Pennywise biting the survivors with his many many teethed mouth and the 1990 Pennywise having only the pointy teeth like he had them in the 1990 movie
---
Best anime ever
---
Oh yeah. He used to be a villain in this community but he's definitely turned around for the most part. He makes good shit
---
This is the place I least expected to be hit with feels
---
Yeh I couldn't remember if it was Tuesday or Wednesday. I quit for awhile and now I'm getting back into it.

---
Well. It doesn't hurt people wanting to just play the game together. Remember this was never fun for Killers going against high rank survivors most of their games and ruining all of the fun for them constantly.
---
I would argue that new players will never get better if they're carried by high ranks every match and never have to go through the solo experience.
---
150k bp will take me from level 1 to maybe 15. By that math the perk is way over priced/under rewarded considering 2100 auric cells is equal to roughly ~49 games if you get 600 Experience a game for devotion when any devotion level above 50 (50,150,250,350...) requires 4200 experience to level up.. 
---
49 games for 2100 auric cells =150k bp
---
If you played 49 games and averaged only 5k points a game you would still have 95k more than the rewarded amount.

That is what you call broken (status effect)

This. I wish I had taken the time to keep track of how many BP it takes to get a killer/survivor to every perk. I leveled 2 survivors and 1 killer with everything pre-rework and I’m pretty sure most of my playtime has gone toward just that.
---
&gt;If the killers terror radius never leaves the hook, guess what? Sounds like he is camping or 'proxy' camping. Time to run away and do a gen
---
Terrible advice, especially if your down to 1 gen remaining since there's a high chance you're in the terror radius just from patrolling.
---
I'm giving up on this game during day time. I can only play the killer during the night and we're talking when there are 33k players online on PC. I can maybe pull 3 killer games a day if I really feel motivated to wait 5-10 minutes to get a lobby. Just give survivors the blood points so that both roles are used for farming.
---
I mostly like to play with my friends on splatoon and just to start up id have to get everyone on discord chat with small headphones on top of the bigger headphones that cover your ears. Then I’d have trouble connecting to friends due to nat type problems. Usually took a couple try’s to get it right. Super fun though it became a chore. So glad overwatch will have dedicated servers with voice support through the game!
---
Wow wtf straight through that window lol
---
You do. But he's half the price of a normal DLC and has two solid perks and one of the best perks in the game. He's also very fun to play as despite not being top-tier.
---
Tombstone Meyers
---
i wish this was edited but i promise it's not
---
He was a villian?
---
yep, hitboxes are fine. They just look nasty on laggy games
---
Nurse and Spirit are largely regarded as the best 2 killers in the game.  We need more killers with equal ability to balance out the roster of killers and increase variety.  There is a reason why there are so few Leatherface and Trapper players.  They lack these effective attributes and are basically useless.
---
Does everyone have an open NAT ?
---
How many times have you used it?
---
So glad I don't have to level Laurie for DS now
---
And the only good perk is one I have, god damnit
---
They could have gotten it from Netflix. Stranger things doesnt belong to Dead By Daylight, but who knows...im not a lawyer.
---
What rank are you?
---
He's de-pipping.
---
Quentin ain’t that bad and we must stay strong if there’s gonna be any hope of fixing his face
---
Sadly not :( Just dressed in black for it
---
Meh, that’s what you get for not leaving lol
---
6 and my friend is 8
---
His name is Raven and he's 6 (and chonky as hell &lt;3)
---
The Doctor disagrees with taking a pallet hit.
---
Test if it happens when you try to play solo, otherwise there’s an issue with swf.
---
Man, that's what you get for trying to be toxic and taunt the killer.
---
Frequently live in red ranks as survivor for the last year and still have no idea how to loop. Send help
---
i was basically facecamped by the hag after she didn't down anyone all game, i was justified staying behind for a little bm
---
It belongs to Steve, only Steve collects hearts
---
Hmm yeh typically it gets worse the higher your rank, but 30 minutes is just wild.
---
Sure feels like it when he is chasing me lol
---
Nice
---
That’s definitely a bug then
---
I quoted myself already. Can you please read carefully before you start spewing shit around?
---
Oh wow ok. Also speaking of rank, how does the rank system work for this game?
---
Just saying you won’t even make it to green ranks or purple and definitely not red like this. When you stay near hook you lose points on chaser due to “close proximity” and not getting enough sacrifices e.g 1 hooking or 2 hooking them won’t give you many sacrifice points. Plus your chases are like seconds so your don’t get many brutality points. Letting gens go quick will also loses you points. Getting kills by camping won’t help you at all it’s better changing person although it may feel like a defeat but it will help you to get better
---
The same could be said right back at you. There's clearly no helping you
---
there were 3 other survivor in the game, how was i stalling the game from the other side of the map?  jesus you people make zero sense
---
Getting hit my Franklin and Lose your key Is probably the worst way to Lose a key unless you manage to Find it
---
My friend just had that happen to him for the survivor it said he DC'd but he didn't I've been experiencing this as well so I think it's just a visual glitch cause I keep all my points at the end

***OH REALLY***

Self care takes up a lot of valuable time.
---
Was "hair optimisation" really that worth it to make the game look like fucking ass BHVR.

It was my first time and I jumped off for fun!
---
The survivors could have been waiting on you to leave or something similar. Point is you are starting toxic habits.
---
Absolutely!  It should be a miracle to actually escape a game.  This would provide a greater sense of accomplishment.  Simply running to a jungle gym or pallet loop isn't all that skillful.  I would prefer they remove these massive loops from the game.  Getting a 4k with a killer should be fairly common.
---
Pretty good job so far.

I actually love discordance. Sadly I run it on everyone and now basically depend on it to find people. I'm a pretty disappointing killer tbh
---
Your not people can counter hag traps by simply crouching they are just being toxic
---
In my experience if you can loop them for more than 10 seconds, that's a facecampin'
---
I play a ton and I just got Devotion 5. 
---
Something’s fishy here. :P
---
Didn't there used to be infinites in this game? Like it used to literally be impossible to catch a surv who ran a certain route...
---
Think that's fair game?
---
You ever play friday the 13th the game? Everyone said was op n shit so he was nerfed hella hard. After the nerf playing jason was a fuckin joke cuz you just get bullied the whole time.
---
That's a proxy camp. It's a valid "strategy" shitty.... but still
---
every update it gets harder and harder to run on higher settings
---
Yeah I agree that that’s where the main balancing issues stem from. Unless they somehow found a way to give solo players more information and then balanced around that but even then swf would still have an advantage.
---
I’m sorry your getting insulted, it really is a shame there’s so much toxicity, although I’ve said that in my opinion it encourages deranking I won’t be doing it because it’s toxic and I consider it cheating.
---
You were more proxy camping than face camping.
---
Basically it's a completely valid strategy that everyone hates to be the victim of and is often obsolete in the higher ranks due to everyone just choosing to do the gens at that point.
---
Probably yeah sewing machines are easy you could learn in a day.
---
Seriously, of all the killers named “The ___” , one called “The Machine” seems like an ez choice, especially for how many years the game has been out.
---
It could be a creepy automaton, a cyborg, a steampunk thing, or a living clock. It could even be a licensed killer like The Terminator.
---
Okay I’ll go let them know
---
Original.
---
Level up, saved the share for new character. Also double bloodpoints on Thursday till like Monday. So it’ll be easy to get the teachable
---
Why does anyone actually buy content from these guys? I bought the game because my friends play it, and it's pretty fun, but the quality control and care towards the community is basically zero. Like a couple patches ago I had some sensitivity bug at the start of every game. Wasn't present the last patch..and now it's back again. How the fucks that happen? I'm a software dev so I'm not talkin completely out of my ass, the shit this company does is insane. The bugs that arise from seemingly unrelated parts of the game...how does this shit happen? I just don't understand.
---
So if you don't enjoy playing against nurse you should quit?
---
What? I don't think most people enjoy playing against nurse.
---
Sorry man, BBQ came pretty recently, it won't be back for a long time
---
You’ll soon discover that survivors have a book of made up rules that they’ll want you to follow, break these rules and they’ll let you know about it.
---
I mean, judging by your friend's points, they did fairly well. Still not a fun feeling though
---
I'd love to use it on Freddy, get that first jump on the survivors early. If I HAD it.
---
There are four scoring categories for Survivor and killer.
---
Killer:
---
1: Brutality, basically scary stuff. Breaking pallets or kicking generators and doing damage.
---
2: Chaser, how quickly you can end chases against survivors. The longer you go without a hit the more points you lose. But hitting a survivor gives you a lot of progress.
---
3: Deviousness, using the killers power or ability. For example hitting a Survivor with a hatchet or chainsaw. Attacking them right after uncloaking or catching them in a trap .
---
4: Sacrifice, this one is self-explanatory. The more you hook survivors. The more points you get for it. Hook them three times for the maximum points each. Killing all four survivors in one hook will give you less points than killing two survivors with three hooks each.
---
All four of those things add towards the killer rank along with gatekeeping which is a purely ranked stat. After the match it calculates how efficient you were at slowing down generators and stopping them from being done. If they get all the generators done in a couple of minutes you will lose progress but if you hold them to 7 or so minutes without doing the generators you will gain progress. Killing them all before they can do generators is ideal.
---
Survivor:
---
1: Evader/Unbroken. How good you are at avoiding the killer or avoiding taking hits. It's basically the stealth points and chase points equivalent for the Survivor. The rank system also takes into account how many survivors escaped or how often people got hooked and downed.
---
2: Boldness, this one is also self-explanatory. Getting chased by the killer. Hitting the killer with pallets or flashlight blinding them. It's basically just being bold and taking the attention.
---
3: Altruism, unhooking other survivors safely and healing them. It also counts taking protection hits or going back to save someone. You lose points for unsafely unhooking someone which means them getting down by the killer or unhooking them right in front of the Killer. It's basically rewarding you for how much you value your teammates.
---
4: Survival. This one is tricky because you get most of the points for it at the end of the match. It counts healing yourself and I'm pretty sure doing totems. For example break all 5 totems so the killer can't use no one escapes death at the end of the match. Or escaping through the trapdoor or exit gate. Using self care or a medkit on yourself also counts.
---
Those are the four main scoring categories for both sides. You can also see the emblems at the end of the match. Their color will vary based on how you performed. You can hover the cursor over the emblem and it will tell you what you did right and wrong or show areas where you can improve.
---
I hope this helped out and helps you work your way up in the ranks. I'm sure someone could have done better than I did but this is what I could think of off the top of my head
---
When you run babysitter
---
Should have been bbq in there with the double bloodpoints coming in 2 days
---
But please fix borrowed time. Its anti camp but without a terror radius it's useless
---
Do you hear yourself? Sure, let's make this game fun for 5 minutes before there are no more survivors to play against. Who wants to learn and improve at the game when immersed yahoos have such brilliant ideas like yourself. Let's make all people that started this game have easy 4k each game against people with xxxxxxxxx amount of decades in-game, they're suppose to be scared of the killer! Escaping should be like EA's lootboxes, less than 1% in 1000 games, that would be make the game sooo fun and scary.
---
This was a roller coaster of emotions.
---
Level up then spend it in the shrine for 150k blood points
---
Yeah. Unfortunately not much can be done about it because of genuine disconnections from matches or people quitting because their teammates had quit. I think both sides should just be awarded a safety upon one player disconnecting from the match. That's all you really can do without being too harsh on people who didn't do anything maliciously
---
there was someone on the hook, you're really reaching.  but you're new to the game clearly judging by your comments so i get it.
---
Played for 220 hours and failed every flashlight save lmao. good job!
---
The dark days were when there was no queue. You had to ready up, and of a killer wasn't waiting for a lobby to fill up, it said "failed" and you had to all ready up and count down from 5.
---
True dispair was being the only one with a single monitor and you need to remind 3 friends to keep readying up.

Trying to figure out if this is just me. Have you noticed either of these 2 issues?
---
-A response lag with the analog sticks? 
---
-lagging skill checks
---
Makes it so hard to hit the skill checks, and I have a good internet connection.
---
Lol sure kid. Someone was on the hook, but you didn't have enough time to go and save him anyhow. There was no reason for you to be in the game other than being toxic.
---
I ran into 5 4-man's in a row a few weeks ago. The percentage isn't that low. It's supposedly like 5% but you have to wonder if the numbers are being cherry picked (Many killers will dodge a 4-SWF, is it only percentage of games actually played out? [Devs have fudged or weirdly calculated percentages before](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7t3xtf/the_actual_amount_of_survs_running_meta_perks/?st=k0yl029i&amp;sh=3e60d8c6))
---
Whenever I hear Meg breathing I think it is Myers or the pig. For someone who is supposed to be a track athlete. She has the loudest breathing in the game and certainly sucks at being quiet
---
i swear it happens every other game
---
Spot on man. Good luck!

That means it's balanced.  Why should a survivor get a free run after the hook.  If a teammate was dumb enough to unhook someone while the killer is their, that's not the Killer's fault.  No freebies!
---
What DLCs are available for this? Everything but Leatherface and Freddy? Might get it for some fun on the go.

Ye. Honestly feels like I only run 2 perks for most games as WGLF is nice for BP but does nothing. 3 perks I can deal with currently not being punished at rank 9, but with sc i rarely use it and feel its made a good impact. Dead Hard buys me a loop or two, and although borrowed time isn't used often, as I go for saves when the killer isn't nearby, it is very nice and I don't feel like I'm running a dead perk
---
At the beginning?
---
Yeah that’s fair, I’ve seen a lot of disconnects where you can tell that they haven’t done it on purpose because they’re mid run or something like that, but it then also screws the rest of the team up being a man down. A safety pip for everyone seems fair.
---
Will sure is dreamy
---
For my ruin, it's /always/ under the school next to the mattress on the floor. The hatch as well.
---
Oh no
---
Quentin was my first P3, I really liked pharmacy.
---
The tunnel vision when a killer sees a Quentin though
---
The eyes are so creepy. Wish we had this as a cosmetic.
---
It's happened twice to me and I've never responded near the hatch. You actually spawn at your original spawn location.
---
At least if you're going to disconnect do it in the pre-match loading screen so players can keep their stuff.
---
The only time I disconnect personally is when it is the Grim pantry. Or when I'm playing killer and the survivors refuse to open the gates. Just sitting there with it at 99% waiting to teabag for minutes on end
---
This was simply too hilarious to not share. I’m still laughing over it. I had fun that match and I can’t even be mad about this message. It’s a gem.

Best killer for beginners, leatherface or the cannibal
---
High tier killer for beginners, hillbilly
---
Highest tier killer that requires practice and has the highest skill ceiling, nurse is first and then spirit
---
That should help, if you want to spend money by leather face.  BBQ and chili, one of the best killer perks in the game, is from leatherface and nurse hillbilly and spirit benefit from it unbelievably well (although all killers can use BBQ).  
---
If you don't plan on spending money you get two of the best killers for free (nurse and hillbilly), and hillbilly is another good begginner killer.  And if your on console you get doctor and hag for free.  Hag gets you hex: ruin (another of the best killer perks) and hex: devour hope (which can be really fun).  Doctor gets you monitor and abuse, which is just overall useful (except on doctor ironically) and overcharge which is a good alternative to ruin.
---
This is my advice, if you spend money then buy leather face and level him first, then get the other killers you want to buy.  If you don't spend money however, start with hillbilly or trapper for getting to learn, then once you have a grasp on the game level hang for ruin and devour hope, doctor for M&amp;A and overcharge (doctor is also possibly the single best killer to farm bloodpoints on), then go back to hillbilly (a good killer plus you get enduring) or trapper (for agitation and brutal strength).  After that experiment with new killers and builds.
---
* Cookie cutter meme (memes which are reposts that only change the title or caption).
---
I just kinda think that it’s something to fixed by the BHVR team.  Which they’ve tried with the window blocks of abused.  I just don’t get mad if someone figured it out and executed it.  Good for them. I don’t have to chase them. I can move on.  Idk I just don’t take it that seriously
---
Don't get me wrong most of these stealth killers are fun as hell, but Wraith's simplicity is just...probably one of the best ways to unwind in this game as a killer.  There's nothing overly complex about going ''Bing Bong." and disappearing with your tiny feet into the night. So simple. So fun. Just refreshing. 
---
Put some respect on Wraith's name basically.
---
A good tip is knowing that when somebody leaves the match through the leave button it will make the sound. If they actually disconnect it won't make the sound.
---
If you were from where I was from, you’d be f*ckin dead.
---
He's such a good and happy boi I love him :')
---
"guys it's toxic for survivors to be present in the game!!!!!!"
---
REST IN PIECES, DOWN FOR THE COUNT
---
I 100% believe it was intentional. That’s one of the best parts of playing hag is seeing the disorientation caused by the forced camera movement.
---
I honestly didn’t know that, been playing this game for over 2 years and still learning stuff haha.
---
Just buy them all.

Is leader worth it? Or should I just buy decisive strike again and collect the blood points
---
haha I hate players on this sub. They think everything is toxic. It's kind of sad. Srry you're getting downvoted for being "toxic"
---
Most killer mains that stream this game complain about the massive loops in the game.  DS can literally screw you over at the end of a game, unless you stall for a full minute.  That simply isn't fun.  It's not really skillful to run clockwise through a jungle gym, yet you can gain so much distance as a survivor.  This is especially true for M1 killers.  That is why there should be more invisible and teleporting killers in the game.  Find ways to limit the number of OP advantages that survivors have.
---
Oh god I hate grim pantry, I don’t disconnect on it personally but can see why you do, yeah I hate when survivors do stuff like that but on the odd occasion they get too cocky it can be soooo satisfying.
---
The thing that makes me want this the most is the Overlook Hotel, which would definitely be the most iconic map to date. Jack Torrence could definitely be made cool, too, but I can't even imagine the Overlook in DBD. It would be so amazing.
---
&gt; Wanna play with friends without being at red ranks? Play KYF.
---
This is not a solution for obvious reasons... 
---
5 people - Sure.
---
Less than 5? Doesn't work.
---
Better off just deranking.
---
So your okay with camping Pigs/Wraiths/Insidious anyone, etc? No, borrowed time should always activate if the killer is close, that’s its sole purpose.
---
Nah, just the way you presented to me. But you have proven my point, so you have a nice night and learn to be nice! Ciao
---
I’ve just never taken gaming that seriously. If there’s a survivor looping the fuck out of me, I’ll move on.  Good for them.  I’m not that good so I tip my cap   I don’t see them as toxic. They’re playing to win just like I am.  Different strokes I guess. I agree people should be kind to each other but as long as I’m not getting messaged I don’t care.  If they wanna do the teabag thing I don’t care.  If they’re having fun cool.  
---
Idk. To each their own.
---
The Grim pantry is the worst map in the game. People complain about it being too big but the dry dock literally has two generators on it sometimes and there are generators in the corners of the map. All of the hooks are in the corners of the mats and impossible to get survivors to without them wiggling free.
---
If you don't do the two generators in the middle of the map and the one on the pantry at your team is fucked and you will be 3 genned.
---
And like yamaoka estate it is just covered in tall grass and brush so you can't see or find anyone and your totem perks are practically gone instantly.
---
It's terrible for both sides and should be removed from the game.
---
I didn't know it until a couple months ago. I'm pretty sure puppers or tru3 pointed it out and that's when I caught on
---
Using SFM for something other than porn? Impressive, most impressive.
---
Official Instructions is aight.  
---
 Chocolate helicopter is pretty op and almost guarantees last survivor gets away. Maybe like +30%/40%/50% opening speed. Otherwise it basically makes for 3 hatches.   
---
Sugar Rush just seems like a personally chosen Borrowed time.
---
If you can get away with a clean bamboozle, then it sounds like they just ALL know where to look for you after the chase. Don't go back to where they found you (picking up a medkit or trying again for an unhook or a gen) and don't just run to the nearest objective (gen or hooked survivor.)   
---
I don't play much survivor but there are some out-of-chase mind games that can help you /stay/ out of a chase, like going to rescue the guy from hook that has more time left since killer won't likely expect that. Iron Will does help a lot but it's learning what to expect that will help you more.
---
I’m gonna screenshot this to send to my friends who say they don’t believe in lost souls, thanks. 
---
I’m fine with camping, but BT is literally made to counter it, just like DS. And you’re right, it isn’t the killers job to entertain survivors, much like it isn’t the survivors job to waste time and not do gens quickly. I like your logic.
---
I stand in the corner most of the time until gate is ready then I open it for them
---
I’d recommend adrenaline, decisive, bond or inner strength
---
Dis cannot be! I’m calling the police and you will go to jail
---
&gt;Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average). The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
I love the salt already from toxic survivor mains. "b-b-but now the poor rank 18 that groups with me and my other red ranked buddies will get beaten" Excuse me if I have a hard time caring that you can now no long bully poor lower ranked killers. If you wanna team with lower ranked survivors then YOU should pay the price in having to carry them. The low ranked killer probably still learning the game shouldn't have to suffer.
---
I dont get it. Why is everyone talking about hatch?
---
&gt; Good for them. I don’t have to chase them. I can move on.
---
What about when everyone is doing it?
---
My favorite killer is Doctor and my favorite survivor is Feng.
---
ya ppl can be assholes sometimes
---
150k bp isn't worth it at all...
---
I know, it's still too easy to get to rank 1, rank 3 up should essentially be the best of the best, the absolutely top of the barrel players, but being rank 3+ basically just requires you're decent at the game, and play enough to brute force through poor luck, in terms of teammates and bad matchups
---
Honestly he should just start with all of his traps and then need add-ons that allowed him to carry more getting reworked like instead of carrying more traps... Those add-ons give him more traps. He just doesn't have enough for the larger Maps. Especially since there in each Corner away from any generators to pressure
---
I don’t own the game yet, but from what I can tell my favorite character is Doctor. He has some really cool cosmetics seems pretty fun.
---
That's just dbd in general. I've lost my save 3 times in the asthma 6 days.
---
DS is on the shrine now,could replace self care with ds
---
Could you imagine chases through the Overlook maze?
---
Depends how much you play...
---
Pig because I love survs having to race against time or having their heads explode.
---
My favorite survivor is feng for the looks but I'm a killer main and my favorite is Wraith for the ding dong, he is just fun to play...
---
Yeah that’s his problem, not only does he have to set up, he then has to walk forever to get the next one.
---
Tiny feet? Like mr. Bing Bong doesn't tromp louder then a heard of elephants!

I agree dude lol, just saying I've seen people hate for using self care instead of waiting around for them to heal.
---
IMO, it goes best with Myers, Trapper, and Legion
---
How is he being toxic? There’s 2 other people alive and he’s by himself. Holy shit people think everything is toxic these days
---
I remember once me and a friend were playing against a pig and I swear he was a second away from receiving a decapitation. He varely manageg to get the trap off.
---
Im not a big teabagger. But there are some times where you want to force a killer to break a pallet to move to the next loop or if youre looping them well a little butt dance can get them angry enough to tunnel you and not your injured teammate. Same with flashlight clicks.
---
Its definitely a competitive advantage to get your opponent to play with emotions instead of their brain.
---
Adrenaline gives heals you up 1 health state which is fine but let’s say you’re not injured and get into a chase and you could use your exhaustion perk to benefit you, you have to wait the 40 seconds or whatever. I just feel like it’s more irritating and a waste of a perk slot.
---
Haven't had any issues so far and I've been playing for about 4 hours.
---
Survivor main: 
---
Kate for aesthetics 
---
Huntress to play against and billy to play as I guess. Don’t play killer too often tho
---
No it doesn't... 150k you can get in 2-3 matches easily as a killer and in about the same time as survivor. To farm those IS it takes ages. The only situation buying BP in the shrine makes sense is when you already have everything but then you want to buy the 250k one because it gives more per IS
---
Took me 150 levels to get BBQ on billy. You’re not alone
---
I know what ya mean man
---
Favourite killer is ghost face as he’s fun af to play at times, favourite survivor is Steve Dwight Claud feng . Couldn’t pick 1 sorry 😐
---
Does anyone else have access to the stranger things dlc when they didn’t buy it? For whatever reason I can play both survivors and the demogorgon and I didn’t buy the dlc. If I go to the psn store it says it $11.99 not purchased.
---
I'm fine with survivors "Gen-Rushing".  That's the only thing they can do.  I would rather see a survivor at a gen then at some stupid jungle gym next to the kill shack with god pallet still up.  That is a huge waste of time.  As long as they are on gens, they are at predictable places.  This allows me to sneak up or teleport on top of them.  If you go down, don't hate on me when I slug you and your friends.  If everyone dies on the first hook, sad for them.  It might kill rank or provide no BP, but you can't take away from the efficient and effective game of the Killer.
---
Because..it's a perk? And you only get four slots.
---
Let's do a NOED addition!
---
Why should a killer get a free down after the gens are done. If the killer was dumb enough to let the survivors finish all the generators, that's not the survivor's fault. No freebies!
---
Its fine. I never set a limit.
---
Bbq is great on billy + bloodpoints! 
---
I personally would take thrilling tremors or a nurses calling instead of bamboozle but other then that your build looks good mate! 
---
Enduring keeps u being super aggressive. 
---
Pop helps keep the gens from being done and you dont really need ruin on billy anyways.
---
Yes it does... If I have 5000+ shards saved up, why the fuck wouldn’t spend 2k to get 150k... and if I don’t want a single perk in the shrine and it’ll take me 2-3 days to get those 2k back... common sense to me my guy.
---
I think I've seen n00b3 in the top 25 before, maybe even in the past month. He's pretty popular.
---
Well when put with distressing it would work on anybody wouldn't it? Also does trappers traps set off IF or no?
---
every update it gets harder and harder to ~~run on higher settings~~ *keep playing the game*
---
If youre still at the hook by the time I get back there Im going for the injured one.
---
You'd be stupid not to. Theyre injured so faster down. You've caught them before so you can do again. If you change targets there's a chance you get an incredible looper and lose all pressure. The more people running around trying to grab my attention the less doing gens.  Ill take my swing if they get too close but im not going to change target because they clicked a flashlight at me.
---
I love you mate
---
I used to have a favorite killer but I don’t really anymore but the pig &amp; Freddy are my mains. Feng Min is my favorite survivor &amp; I consistently use Spine Chill.
---
Well death is not an escape so...
---
That means he had to have survived?
---
To play as: Billy. Sniping/map pressure for days. 
---
To play against: A good Nurse. Rare on console, though.
---
\*SCREECHES LIKE A HAPPY SPIRIT\*
---
Wow that's some truly daft logic.
---
Perks counter enemy's play styles or support your own, that's the purpose of perks, buddy
---
Let's do a Ruin addition!
---
You can't stop players from gen rushing. If they enjoy that play style, it shouldn't be limited. As long as the survivors are having fun, what difference does it make. The survivors job isn't to provide entertainment for survivors. If you're upset about getting gen rushed, you shouldn't let them complete gens. Ruin is only there to make up for your mistakes
---
Ghost face interacting with spine chill.
---
Imagine dying but not even Hell wants you so come back as a dream monster. This post was made by everyone except Freddy.
---
PCMR circlejerking in 2019 lel
---
NOED is completely fair.  The killer has to sacrifice another perk that applies game pressure, plus all the survivors have to do is cleanse totems.  Then, the perk is wasted.  It's super easy to counter and that is why it's balanced.
---
Freddy can't teleport at the beginning of the match until his cooldown finally ends.
---
Hey why
---
I mean hes not wrong. If some teabagging in a game causes you to rage that hard that you have to quit youre mental fortitude is practically nonexistent.
---
If your mouse can freescroll, bind struggle to Mouse Wheel Up/Down. Much easier imo
---
For people like me who hasn’t spent much money on DLC
---
Finally some good fucking food.
---
I didn’t know that. Interesting. Approx how long do you know?
---
For just messing around Legion or Ghost Face. Legion's stabbing sprees are fun as hell, especially when you stab the first person and hear all three heartbeats at once cause you know you're about to just go to town and get a whole bunch of points. Ghost Face can teabag back, and I know I've jumpscared people by leaning around corners while they're on a gen. When I actually want to get kills I play Freddy, the dream pallets are just mean and the gen teleports are so nice to have.
---
I had this exact same cleaning tool at my work and used it in the exact same way for 10 minutes
---
 yeah. For example Leatherface you have to be on the survivors back and they have to be completely out in the open. And you also have to help you don't release the chainsaw at 99% which will completely cancel it and slow you down to half your speed.
---
The Trapper has this lovely issue we're by the time you've gotten all your traps what you can't hold at the same time... You only have one or two areas on the map covered up and half the generators are done. If you could have add-ons that gave him more traps and started with all of them... The bonus traps being scattered and locations around the map... I think he would be a much more balanced killer and not have as many struggles. And people wouldn't complain about playing against him either
---
BT is completely fair. The survivor has to sacrifice another peek that applies game pressure, plus all the killer has to do is not camp the hook. Then, the perk is wasted. Its super easy to counter and that's why it's balanced.
---
Can survivors outside a SWF group see other survivor ranks/prestige again? Haven't played survivor since the patch.
---
Im not going to be crazy and say youre the only one. But there's plenty of people that play games to win. Not to ensure everyone has a good time.
---
*Music from Us starts playing*
---
I understand not being able to play against unwilling participants. And I'm not really disputing having been banned. Still there is no reason to ban me from playing with those who would choose to do so. And based on the wording of what developers are allowed to do with bans, I think there's a strong argument that they should not be allowed to do so.
---
I don't know and I'm shit at judging times.
---
Favorite killer to play is trapper. Its so god damned satisfying... sometimes. Favorite to play against is the demogorgon. Like what an awesomely designed killer.
---
Deranking is bannable.  
---
And you deserve the ban if you derank.
---
No
---
They're allowed to ban "online play," which of course it is, but I guess I'm considering the spirit of the law, rather than the letter.
---
TOXIC. /s

It's...literally the clip from Dead by Daylight's chapter announcement.

---
I’ve never understood why billys and leather faces chainsaws work differently, like Billy’s goes as soon as the bar is full but leather faces you have to fill the bar then release it, makes no sense.
---
I probably shouldn’t be wanting a trapper buff because I’m pretty successful at playing him but when I’m against him I have a special talent of stepping in every damn trap.
---
Hag is always the one to jumpscare me
---
One should think about it - especially, if like he said, what isn't fun is playing against strong killer builds and not nurse in particular.
---
Without strong killer builds forcing survivors to change up their tactics, every game would be the same boring thing.
---
Happened to me twice while working on my daily before I found out why.
---
The mettle of man crisis lmao im now gonna refer to that period with that name lol
---
Ive yet to play against the demogorgon.
---
I've seen this pop up on my feed multiple times today and only just now realised that old mate Gorgon is munching on a fucking head...
---
What a savage.
---
Because that's how grocery carts are these days.
---
The issue isn't following survivors. The problem is that those survivors always have the safe place to run to.  If the game for survivor is just to run from pallet to pallet and window to window, don't get mad when the devs balance and break those routes apart.
---
good choice
---
I don’t think it hurts most groups of friends, it hurts groups with new players. If I were to play with a friend at rank 1 and match a rank 1 killer, I’d probably get my ass kicked , but I wouldn’t feel it’s unfair and could use it as a learning experience. But I’m only able to use it as a learning experience because I understand core gameplay and realize the difference between us was skill. People brand new to the game don’t have that understanding of core gameplay, and the tutorial doesn’t explain a large portion of game mechanics. Until they understand what’s happening in the game and why, they won’t be able to improve much by getting their ass kicked by a player at a much better rank. Unfortunately, they have to face those people at a better rank if I want to play with them and help teach them the game.
---
Again, I think the change is a good thing in most situations. It just screws over groups of new players who are trying to have a better player teach them what’s happening
---
"Map control is for pussies" is probably the best way to describe leatherface
---
Different ways to extend chases, such as areas where only survivors can slide under a section or killer areas where walls are fragile and can be m1 to break for killers
---
That's good practice. I often let one go, sometimes two if they are in an especially unfair position. This was my 3rd game as Plague I think and I had gotten stomped already so my unhealthy aggression was high.
---
It's true though. You don't need map control when you can down multiple survivors at once 😎
---
Wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-wh-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-at-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now-now?
---
That's the issue with swf. All you really need is one survivor to be decent at looping, and you are looking at 1-3 gens done. The rest of the team can be potatoes - all they need to do is hold m1 and  bang their head on the space bar when they hear a noise. 
---
I've only gotten a handful of games since the patch, but the change is already really noticeable.
---
I was at it for five, wasting time instead of washing dishes lmao
---
*flashbacks to disapproving papa entity*
---
*epic camper gameplay inbound*
---
Plus, why complain about camping when you can just do the gens lol
---
Saying lel in 2019 lol
---
I was having fun while washing some hot drink dispensers
---
Losing and not having a good time are strongly correlated
---
Allergic reaction! Quick get Claudette!
---
You said it wasnt Interesting
---
It doesn’t make movement impossible and it’s intentional.
---
so the best way to counter looping is to walk away from it and hope for a more advantageous situation?
---
alright then...
---
I agree. If you’re playing with your yellow rank friends you probably arent all taking the game super seriously so it isnt a big deal. The opposite is much worse.
---
I can think of many maps where your statement is false. Break the pallets early and late game all chases will end quickly. Some windows are better but without pallet nearby you have extra speed boost and you will catch up.
---
That does work
---
I watched something similar with a Claudette the other night; killer (Legion) played pretty well and fairly, but they were running NOED and I got hit and hooked at the gates - Nea was hit but escaped. (And in fairness, they didn't just smack us all and leave us to bleed out) Claudette was teabagging at the gates, got hit, crawled out and then suffered that glitch where they can't exit the map so EGC collapse got them.
---
I was spectating and not gonna lie, I had a pretty good laugh at it.
---
r/instantkarma
---
Is Ash on switch?
---
Hopefully they get inspired by Smite. Only problem is that even after they announced it it took like a year to fully roll out.
---
Is there a story behind the Dwight, Claudette, Feng, and Nea in these specific cosmetics that keep returning? Do your friends play with them or are they just your favorite?
---
hook everyone 3 times? 
---
so just fuck you if the guy on the hook struggles or his teammates don't get there till struggle phase
---
This is beautiful.
---
It’s an older meme, sir, but it checks out.  I was about to upvote it.
---
I thank campers. One Survivor dies but we finish all the generators and do all of their totems so they can't rely on no one escapes death to get someone else at the end.
---
I see them the most and I think these are the most toxic skins. Also, the story is that they’re a SWF group
---
It’s working as intended. It’s meant to disorientate you. Crouch over traps if you don’t want to trigger them or use a flashlight to get rid of them.
---
It's pretty basic, it's restricted to small piece of map. Repair gen, unhook etc.
---
At higher ranks it's difficult to get a quick game, want to know? Because of balanced matchmaking. If you're in red ranks, the game searches for people around your rank, and only around your rank, it doesnt immediately pair you up with rank 20s because they want you to be with people of the same skill level, and it will search for a LONG time. When this fails, it then looks for "who's available" . this is when you slowly get paired with rank 20s and the like, because they are the most common. It is also their solution for you not having to wait forever, despite it being "unfair". There arent many red ranks, so the chances are, you'll have a harder time finding quick games than someone who's rank 20. In fact most of the complaints are from red ranks regarding matchmaking. But what can you do? Code a better solution? The majority of players are purple and above. If you rather never play with lower ranks and only red ranks, not only are you limiting yourself to only ONE playerbase, you'll experience WAY longer queue times. it's either you get a game or you don't, and I'm sure you'd choose the former.
---
Otz a cutie
---
Right?! 😂😂
---
It increases the duration of undetectable after teleporting.
---
Rn I main Demo, he is also really fun to play against as a good Demo can use his wormholes to get around the map easely, I also spooked tons of survivors with it by pooping up and dashing when they least expected it, also best Mori
---
But you still need object of obsession to ruin the day of your local ghostface/wraith/pig/Myers
---
I've gotten disconnected and told I don't have a network connection twice since this update
---
Yes dude , I am using Windows 8 only for DbD other tasks I am doing on Linux. If DbD can be playable on Linux, windows os for me  will be gone. But I think they wouldn't do something because we Linux users only ~5% of all players... I hope developers of anti-cheat make this workable on Linux, it's my hope)
---
I fully support that lol.
---
Right so instead of going against a purple rank killer when I'm playing with a green rank friend put me against a red rank so that the green rank gets shit on. This will be a fun experience for all involved I'm sure.
---
Only DLC bought with REAL MONEY is shared between all profiles. Auric cell and Shard purchases only unlock on the profile that bought it.
---
Wow a day before BBQ is on shrine I unlock it, a day before DS is on shrine I unlock it.
---
Guys just ask me what I'm about to unlock if you want to wait to make sure it's not about to be on the shrine
---
Loops? How fucking DARE they not stand in an open area and let you down them without trying to survive. Toxic pieces of shit.
---
?
---
I think so
---
That's not my issue with matchmaking at the moment. If you have more than one person matchmaking is showing everyone as ready up and when the game finally does load in, only two out of four or three out of four people actually get through to the game while the other few get left up at the lobby prior to the game lobby... if that makes sense. So then we have to back out to get back to our friends and then restart the que which then sometimes just freezes up and searches forever.... so we have to restart the game completely. That's the issue with matchmaking right now. I dont mind waiting a little longer
---
I’m thinking Legion with sloppy, coulrophobia, thanatophobia, dying light, faster recovery and mapwide TR. would be stupid but fun. Also RIP no mither squads (for thanatophobia)
---
It could be a bug on the Switch since it just launched. Submitting the ticket makes them aware of it.
---
Limited to one player I presume
---
I don’t.
---
My waiting time was about 3 mins
---
Color of house?
---
"I am THE MACHINE!!" and the killer is shirtless Bert Kreischer
---
Thanks, that's what seemed most plausible to me but I wanted to dream.
---
Ruin is completely fair.  If the survivors spawn on it, oh well.  That's the risk of running the perk.  There is a counter to it.  
---
However, we need more invisible killers that can teleport with no terror radius.  Reread the original post.
---
Dedicated servers aren't live yet. The best thing to do is back out and try again.
---
No for the traps, but you can whack them when they're stuck and they'll go down. Then you'll see if there was someone on the way to rescue.
---
Not face camping. And even if you were, you don’t have to play by their rules nor answer to them when you don’t do what they want. As long as you aren’t rage-DCing, holding games hostage, or being a cock in chat (amongst a few other things) - you’re good. 
---
People are just salty. Unsportsmanlike, cheap, or pro-survivor/killer tactics do not automatically = toxic or reportable offenses.
---
Well after reading all the comments I decided to list my own favorites. For Killer I the main ones I play are doctor and clown. I do like the trappers "Sea Side Physco" outfit I think its called. For survivor, for a while I used Ace but bow its been Bill and Jeff. On Jeff  i got a set of perks, so when Im on the hook I can see  the killers aura, When someone heals me or I heal them we see each other's aura when Im unhooked I break the hook. Thats all I remember off the top of my head.
---
Since it was recently released on switch the que times will be a bit long
---
u/uwutranslator
---
Let me keep my progress on PC and I'll buy it, I've grinded way too hard and too long to start over, if not fuck off.
---
He. Only perks I dont have yet are demogorgon's. And I'll get those soon after I finish leveling up the other two new characters.
---
Shards are just a source of BP for me, honestly.
---
Hell give lower tier killers buffs instead of already high tier killers. The pig just went through 3 nerds that were unneeded, while stronger killers just get stronger.
---
Just run OoO, if you are asleep, he can't mindgame you and has to run through the loops.
---
I remember once a friend narrowly escaped the trap, another second and it would have went off.
---
I take self care because I don’t trust other survivors. 
---
I’ve had someone who preferred to self care himself then to heal me and I then him (or the other way around) and then he just ran away doing a quick vault so the killer knew where I was. 
---
NEVER trusting another survivor again.
---
t? The head doctor is really 89?
---
Getting into the game with your friends isn't matchmaking. Matchmaking is finding players to literally "make the match" with. That's just a connection issue which has plagued this game since it's birth, which stems from not having dedicated servers. It's the worst problem right now since you have to be dependent on how good your killer's connection is, which is absurd. 4 people connecting to some random persons host connection is lazy developing. I understand what you mean.
---
Hiders be like
---
And purchases of in game currency won't get shared either as an fyi... unfortunately that was thought of ahead of time.
---
Yeah common sense to take 75BP per IS instead of 92.6 because less is more right? You're on a diet? Taking less BP?
---
Common sense to me my guy. I don't care how many shards you have saved up.
---
Looks too much like Legion.
---
Well the title makes it seem like i’m having a stroke.. ok.
---
I agree that he didn't need it, but most players simply weren't able to use him and they needed to rework it. He was a hard killer for some. 
---
Also, since he's one of the most popular icons in horror they needed to have a balance for players to be able to play as him and more importantly sell the DLC. 
---
I mained him for a while and tried out his new build and didn't mind the changes.
---
Masochists. Lots and lots of masochists. Top that with Old DS, no healing nerf, Borrowed Time protecting both the unhooked and unhooker, the Swamp used to be even bigger, Badham had even more pallets, a lot of QOL buffs missing from weaker killers like Wraith and Trapper, it was crazy skewed toward survivor. Let's not forget the infamous "Go play Civ 5 or survivor", but the game and the devs themselves have improved a lot since then and devs have become a lot more active in listening to the community.
---
So basically, I solo queued. I said "bill mains rise up!" and both players became bills and 1 stayed as no mither david. We gen rushed and memed the entire game, and wasn't toxic and played fair by unhooking and doing gens. Spirit got so toxic that her ruined died like 1 min into game she started camping. She got one of us and, well. ***Here we are haha!***
---
Otz is best dbd youtuber imo
---
It's still matchmaking if you have to find a killer. Hence the searching...
---
Its probably licensing issues so no one knows, if they sort it out and can get it on the switch sure but I wouldn't hold my expectations high if they didn't get it on the launch its unlikely...
---
Ahh that makes sense thank you
---
Oh and they have dedicated servers now man. They just made the switch. Do you have any idea what you are talking about or are you just trying to find something wrong with what I'm saying?
---
the original design would be a good cosmetic
---
Ok if you’re going to censor your name, at least have the common curtesy to censor theirs too. Any photos like this need to be to have player names censored out of respect and to prevent witch hunting.
---
Never run into that. I’m at pretty low level.  Not a ton of great loopers. Sorry I can’t relate.  I’m sure that’s frustrating.
---
I don't understand if this is supposed to be funny or what? 
---
The perk only works once a game,  and you should want team mates clensing totems. Plenty of other things to do to get bloodpoints in a match. Also, why shouldn't they be able to get them as well plus it does them a solid which also does you a solid if noed doesn't activate. 
---
So yeah,  this meme is weird and not funny to me at all. Makes no sense really.
---
Oh God oh fuck
---
It's hard reading through your post when you are not even listening to what my issues are right now. Try playing a couple games on xbox or ps4 right now with a friend or two and you would understand. It's obvious you havent played in a little while..
---
Big dick dude a classic but this image was something I drew an hour ago lol.
---
Doesn't work on them anymore. They get the undetectable status now.
---
That wasnt my name LOL
---
That was the killer and the toxic spirits name
---
The only other option is smurfing
---
for a hot second I thought you were kidding but then thought "hold on what if they are customer support"
---
I think it’s the only house on the map. If not it has a green/tan tent to it
---
The counter to BT is not camping

I do miss old Badham (right before the massive rework). It was my favorite map. Now I'm confused everytime I go in. I know it had its problems but I do miss it...as a survivor main.
---
I posted this first, why is this one being upvoted more?
---
when you're a baby killer, the existence of survivors is toxic
---
By usage codes I mean common grounds usage
---
Welcome to dead by daylight. The game is bugged as hell and imo, should do with a rewrite.
---
Not working for me either. I think they gave up on it. But it's still in game so idk
---
I've contacted EAC in the passed and they said it's a game-by-game thing. like they natively support 7 Days To Die, Albion Online, Hide &amp; Hold Out, Hurtworld, Miscreated, Robocraft, The Culling, Arc, Aema 3, Day of Infamy, Insurgency, and some others have support through Wine.  
---
I've heard DBD on it's own runs with Wine and the only stopper is EAC.
---
“Bugged lobbies” have been a thing for at least two years, it’s not new.  Best course of action is to leave.
---
It was a mistype I’m on shitty mobile. Doesn’t matter anyways. The mods remove posts displaying player names. Just don’t do it. It’s rude.
---
I like running Ruin, Pop, Discordance, and Thrilling Tremors on him, try it out I promise you wont be disappointed!
---
Ruin to slow gens down.
---
Pop to really help in end game final few gens and after ruin gets cleansed.
---
Discordance for map awareness and it might give you a free expose on someone. 
---
Thrilling Tremors so you know what gens are being worked on (so u can pop it).
---
Well then don't get to rank one if you don't want to face those people. And don't play with a rank one if you don't want to face rank ones. No one is forcing you to play survive with friends. And it's better than the alternative of having an entire match ruined by one person carrying the team and artificially ranking them up. A low-ranked player will never get better if they are being carried by a high rank through the ranks.
---
Besides. Most players say they're just playing to have fun with their friends. Which I personally I have my doubts. I think a lot of people do it for the advantage or to win. Playing with a high rank should only be chill if the high rank is carrying you. According to most sane people though playing with a high rank would mean facing more difficult opponents.
---
As I have said many times. You will never get better at the game if a high rank is doing all the heavy lifting for you. Play solo Survivor perkless from rank 20 to rank one and then rank will ever matter again. There's a reason the Survivor Escape rate is around 80% at rank one According to some statistics.
---
If he has dream snares, you won’t be able to use loops though.
---
I had the same issue and My reasoning is that it’s still pretty new.
---
Pretty sure they added anti aliasing with this update. Can turn it off if you go through files unless you’re on console, but it basically smooths out sharp edges for performance and graphic appearance
---
I'm not putting any negative tone to my teammates. They were nice. So how would that be considered shaming? You got your head twisted upside down.
---
Just like nancy if you know what I mean, BUDUMSH
---
"I mean, the only way this could get worse is if Mye-
---
Hey Myers!"
---
Entire army.... of darkness?
---
Lagging skill checks yes, but not every single one, just some of them. That on top of the tiny screen (undocked) means I probably won't get many great skill checks on this version.
---
Is nobody tired of this game being KILLERBASED couldn’t even play with my friend cause they want to put me in a match with a rank 2 killer smh SO DISAPPOINTED IN THIS UPDATE!! Stop patching survivors there was no reason to take out the sprint burst from the head on that was once again making killers OP ! make are hit box smaller cause I’m getting hit by a killer that is  clearly hitting the air I can show you guys VIDEOS AND SCREEN SHOTS IM PUSHING TO MAKE THIS GAME BALANCED I LOVE THE GAME BUT NOW AFTER THIS UPDATE ME AND A FEW PEOPLE I ALWAYS PLAY WITH DONT EVEN WANNA PLAY! I’m happy about the patches on the killers but for someone like me that doesn’t really play killer as often this update dose not feel right as a survivor
---
Does the icon appear when you activate their abilities? Because if not, that isn’t true
---
If they were able to get the license, Sidney would have been the survivor.
---
“Ima just squeeze by ya sorry”
---
Oh I thought you were customer support lol
---
Been saying forever, this game needs a mechanical killer of some sort. A crazed cyborg experiment would be creepy as hell.
---
Maybe with a design aesthetic borrowing from the film Virus (1999)
---
Loud heavy metal stomping while stalking around. Mechanical whirs and drill sounds in the distance as he attacks. Yeah, that's some good shit right there.
---
Trapper is my least favorite killer in the game. Sure I despise Legion but at least I have good luck at beating them. Form a Trapper is blatantly unfun to play against. Mainly because the matches end up lasting like 20 minutes and I'm a trap magnet.
---
In my honest opinion. Leatherface chainsaw should be able to be released like Billy's. Releasing an early should make him sling it less times meaning you would down less survivors or the chainsaw would end quicker
---
I think the Tantrum should also be reduced a bit and he should not lose speed while charging it. And he should gain speed up on releasing it. Not as much as Billy but make him about as fast as Legion in feral frenzy post Nerf
---
Imagine being a perk that slows the game down and is boring for both sides to use when you can just steamroll and get moris on top of it. This post was made by Hex: Devour Hope Gang.
---
I honestly don’t understand. People complaining about Freddy because he’s strong but spirit and nurse they’re perfectly fine. Any killer that is somewhat strong or in a good position people start complaining.
---
i wanted Gale survivor so bad &amp; a map based on the movie set from the third movie,  so it could incorporate a little bit of each movie while still being a new &amp; interesting design
---
As much as I don't want to have to rebuy everything again. 
---
I'm still excited that our community will expand, so I welcome our switch killers/survivors
---
Carpal tunnel is scary, but I don't consider it fun.
---
It did and it was
---
Yeah not getting camped by every leatherface would be nice. Can’t really blame them though considering that’s all he’s good for really.
---
I’d simultaneously love and hate a trapper buff, atm I like the fact I don’t play him often but if he got buffed he’d be more popular and it’d also make playing him a damn site better. Think I’d have to start running small game.
---
Seen what?
---
Okay well I hope they change it
---
Yeah, have fun paying three times for games you buy.
---
I think we need another killer that uses madness tbh rather than another stealthy one :/
---
Did you get out?
---
Lmao exactly
---
Yeah that could be it
---
Im not subtracting from his... but for a tall skinny dude... that dude is louder than the stampede in the lion king
---
I get that. I really appreciate the mention of BBQ and using lockers. Happens so much now with newer players.
---
I didn’t downvote you actually? Why are you so sure I did? 
---
And it is common knowledge...
---
Simply telling OP to follow sub’s rules. Period. 
---
Think you’re reading too much into it.
---
But Wraith is the most op killer because he can make asmr with his bing bongs
---
So you trolled a killer, talked trash in the game chat, went to the streamer's channel, and then laughed at the viewers' reactions of you trolling.
---
Shlorp
---
Ten days ago, it was announced that dedicated servers were pushed back. Link me to where dedicated servers was released, if it was, I missed it. But to my knowledge as of right now, it's been delayed and didn't come with the stranger things update
---
Cha cha real smooth
---
..And they do? Given, you know, they don't have a dagger and the killer does
---
Hey mate! Wouldnt agitation work better instead of iron grasp? 
---
What rank do you play him at? Im curious hehe
---
We didn’t trash talk lmao. We never trolled that would be negative to the killer but only would negatively impact ourselves, since we didn’t even do anything negative. And I laughed at myself. Period.
---
Considering that nobody has ever liked the current system, no matter how thematically appropriate it may be, I feel like the dev in charge of that department just hates the playerbase.
---
So it's Peanits.
---
The only definitive best killer is nurse but don't play her unless you want to get curbstomped 
---
For free killers hillbilly is super fun and high tier and wraith is also really fun but don't expect to win every game with him. 
---
For killers that you buy, Michael is super fun when you get to one shot killers and once you get really good at the game spirit is top tier 
---
Also if you're a stranger things fanboi demo is super fun and has a fairly simple but good power
---
Hag, nurse, pig, and legion i would definitely stay away from. Hag and nurse are good but hard to play well and legion and pig are low-bottom tier
---
Perfectly balanced
---
Cuz both survivor perks in the bloodweb are 250k... use your fucking head
---
He honestly deserves more followers. He’s entertaining and actually good at the game. But since he’s “toxic” and openly critical of the game and it’s issues he’s bashed and ignored. 🙄
---
Inner strength works more than once? As long as you have some totems left?
---
Well it’s common sense to think the guy who took my joke way to seriously who originally downvoted (or so I presume) that they’d do it again.
---
Wait time for survivor is almost instant. I get a match within seconds everytime. Killer takes longer though. Round 2 mins for me. As for DC's... I somehow haven't had to deal with a single one yet and I've played probably 20ish matches. It's not all sunshine and rainbows though. The frame rates on both portable and docked modes are pretty bad especially on outdoor maps. Overall though it's totally worth it to have DBD on the go.
---
When I get matched with people my rank it’s a lot better haha! Earlier today I got a 4k with myers but I got cucked twice with my mori (not the ebony one). If I had hex ruin I think I’d get 4k’s more often since gens are always getting done really quickly
---
lol its like a scene in a horror movie where they run to a cop but theyre covered in blood so he's about to arrest them but gets murdered
---
only problem with that might be the way the game runs on each platform but it would definitely help with lobby times
---
[removed]
---
Not when 3/4 leave lol
---
Dartanion (RIP)
---
Bro inner strength works multiple times a game. Source: me, a bloody Nancy
---
Stonks?
---
That happens in every multiplayer game. Shitty teammates often end in a loss. Point is its not the killers fault but the other survivor.
---
my bad, didnt realize u were the dwight
---
Gonna be honest with you, I don't even have Agitation yet. If you want to use that instead, be my guest, Iron Grasp is the least essential to the build anyway. In fact, I recently discovered how much it sucks to be carried by someone using it, so I've started looking for alternatives. 
---
As for the rank, the lowest I've gotten is 6, but that was right before a reset, I haven't played in a while, and I was in WAAAY over my head from rank 9 until that point.
---
You:*We didn't talk trash*
---
Also you and your friends:Camping pee poo poo, LOL, Salty
---
You and 2 others picked Bill, gen-rushed, and had a No mither David. After winning the matching, one of you proceeded to talk trash. Definitely trolling.
---
But I said please and thank you....
---
The killer gets more points when a survivor DC’s so you did her a favor also you could’ve wasted her time and let your team get some gens done while she was busy camping you but because you quit she left and your team had less free time to work, DCing only helps the killer more and you get nothing from it, other than that good meme :)
---
Good post!
---
I downvoted your post. Not your comments. And I downvoted because of the reason I specified previously.
---
Just censor player names dude. That’s all. Wasn’t even reading into any jokes to begin with. Barely even paid attention to the meme. Like I said I think you’re reading into me simply telling you to remove names too much. Like I get why you only did the one. But it’s just viewed as respectful to remove them all, not even just because it’s a mod rule. 
---
But ok
---
Ghostface, he's just a better killer
---
This is revenge for glitching out 4 Killers vs. 1 Survivor
---
Onions!
---
* Screenshots highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
r/thatsthejoke
---
He'll never learn if he blames the killer. He should learn to be more cautious about going near places he's been seen once, especially with Freddie.
---
I've been playing it on switch most of the day and it's definitely not hitting 30fps range. More around 20ish especially on outdoor maps. I'm sure overtime it'll get more optimized. Even with the fps issues it's still worth finally having DBD on the go with the Switch.
---
I think you missed that part of the post that indicated there may be quite a bit of sarcasm.  Wish you the best my man.
---
So there's proxy camping and face camping
---
Face camping is sitting in front of the hook after hooking a survivor
---
Proxy camping is staying nearby so that you can run over when someone saves the survivor or catch them out before they make it
---
Neither of these are really viable for Two reasons
---
1. You want to stop the other survivors from doing gens. If you camp the hook one survivor can try to save the hooked survivor while the others finish gens or No one will come and they'll get 2 or 3 done by the time the hooked survivor dies
---
2. An ideal match is one where you kill all four survivors but they all get off the hook twice. That way you get the most bloodpoints and rank up faster.
---
When you camp the hook you reduce your chances of getting 4 kills because you only try to kill 1 survivor and ignore everyone else because you're camping while they do gens
---
So that they won’t do this again in the future? Also deters other people if they realize people do actually get banned for it
---
1: legion is s-tier.
---
2: yeah no. solid pass.
---
I spent $9 like three days ago to buy Laurie just for DS. I feel like BHVR is attacking me personally. Why must you hurt me in this way, DbD. Have mercy on my (literally) poor soul
---
Yeah, at this point there’s about 4 or 5 different versions to play on, there should be some sort of bhvr account system or way of transferring your data from one platform to another
---
Yeah of course I understand the newbie thing, 99% of people camp when they first start the game
---
I crutch like that pretty hard on surveillance
---
Once I stopped running spine chill and urban evasion, I gotta say I never went back to using them ever again
---
R/salvia lololol
---
Bing Bong go stomp stomp
---
wat?
---
This isn't really a good idea.
---
More like every time I play swf lol We focus more are being asshats instead doing the objectives.
---
I was complementing your quality killer choice.
---
What the fuck did you just say?
---
&gt; The low ranked survivors are always too scared to go for unhooks.
---
Jesus, you can say that again.
---
[Easy Example](https://youtu.be/vhhpvy04ng8)
---
Getting cross map snipes is easy if you know the tricks. 
---
Every killer has little tricks and stuff you can use. 
---
Hillbilly chainsaw is heard across the map, it sounds about the same until your within his terror radius. 
---
You can rev the chainsaw 24/7 and really messes with people.
---
Unless they are SWF most people will start to panic you’ll be walking around and see someone sprinting because they thought you were charging them.
---
Bring two items but no add-ons would be the only way to balance. Also no items above rare.
---
Ah, nothing wrong with some stabbing
---
flair checks out
---
Legion is s tier. Best boy/girl.
---
At least optional crossplay then. But really I wouldn’t see that as an issue since there’s even pc players who play at 30fps or have their low ends.
---
gotta stay true to yourself
---
[Then you see them in the next lobby](https://imgur.com/gallery/PBG5gZE)
---
I think you should be able too but you can’t use decisive strike
---
The low ranked survivors are always too scared to go for unhooks
---
The only shit I hate is genuine face camper. That’s just annoying. Tunneling and soft / proxy camping are completely fine. They make sense to do in situations. Face camping is just plain disrespectful and makes the game boring for everyone.
---
Everything you did signified this match as a giant troll on a TTV Killer for no reason other than your amusement.
---
*Is salty toxic when it's reactive?*
---
Yeah. It being reactive doesn't make it any better. Just shows that you say it so much to the point that it's become a reaction which only further proves that you're toxic.
---
*You would see nothing wrong*
---
Survey has determined that that's a lie.
---
It's part of the new update. At a certain level you get three perks and I think at level 50 you get 4 and can choose 2
---
“Waste” lol keep spending them on trash cosmetics then my dude
---
It would also play that specific theme music when inside the T/R also, not only in a chase.
---
Dude rip to those few Jeff mains out there. I love you guys
---
I appreciate this idea
---
I love how the Myers just says indirectly “you’re free to go”
---
This guy gets it.
---
It'll reappear
---
I had unlimited speed glitch on this map lmao
---
Ruin is the epitome of a noob perk. Completely reliant on luck of placement and on survivors not being good enough to hit skill checks.
---
check the Patch Notes ;)
---
Actually a really neat idea, allows for more choice and customization for all parties, and I imagine they would be rather cheap shard-wise
---
r/expectedthanos
---
still, just being able to carry a medkit and a Toolbox at the same time would be stupid
---
Again already explained to you dumbass that even if you want BP which no one smart does, its stupid to use it on that one.
---
Anyone else getting 0xp every match as survivor and the killer showing 0 bloodpoints as if they disconnected?
---
Thank god 
---
I only really wanted it for one character so I got worried that I screwed my chance
---
I hate that I agree with this. Strode is my favourite godawful map. Take my upvote and stop shitting on my map
---
The anti-aliasing looks the same on all settings. It looks like blurry trash lol.
---
Yea
---
She basically ruined the game for everyone. One throwing survivor can make the killer win easy if they don't care.
---
Pretty sure in that order but who knows, they always switch up their priorities so I wouldn't hold your breath.
---
Unacceptable !!! I hope everyone stops playing spirit until this gets fixed (and maybe even for a little while after that to protest that it was broken in the first place...) !!!
---
Ikr they're all cool concepts but op af
---
This is the only thing I miss. The 1 out of 100 GGs. But damn, you can't even try a wonky build that might work without being berated after the match.
---
The art style looks really good!
---
And that's what you get for the dumb move of making an achievement gen a solo one
---
Mental fortitude lol it’s a fucking game who cares
---
To answer the first question, no. You can no longer grab a survivor who is jumping into hatch. Not sure on second question though.
---
I mean at that point I just let the last guy farm point because the DCing cunts didn't even want to put up a good game. Like I get it if there are things you don't like playing against, it happens in every game. so why in DBD where rounds are maybe 8-10 minutes max, do I see the most DCs.
---
very pro!
---
Do you know that periods exist, or are you uncertain of your own statement?
---
I've not once seen it there. I've mostly found it in the street or in another corner in the basement
---
1. No more hatch grabbing. If there were you'd still have the hatch standoff.
---
2. In my experience it closes at the start of the animation. There's been times I've seen the survivor's animation cancel as the hatch closed on them. As survivor I've never really been able to spam it. Doesn't seem to work. Best bet for either side is to stand in the very center of the hatch.
---
Me too. Got a 4k first time I played him in green ranks
---
Thank you! What helped me get better besides playing a lot was just watching noob3 play and kinda study his movements
---
That guy was choking so hard lmao
---
yep doctor has the easiest devious points to get. if you add distressing perk it gets you points fast
---
The thing that always gets me with these types of posts is when we look at the type of grief both sides can face.
---
When you are the killer, pretty much everything the survivors can do has counterplay and you have the option to have made better decisions. Really the only exception is swf on comms.
---
For survivor though, you keep talking about "the killer is punishing a mistake," but it's not *your* mistake. You have no control over when you get hooked, and so if the killer decides to screw you over more after your teammate screwed you over, there isn't anything you can do about that.
---
Further, the biggest problems that survivors face are effectively being unable to play the game at all. If you are camped or tunneled first, that's it, your game is over. This when the game is designed around all the survivors having multiple chances to actually play the game.
---
Quick and Quiet, so that it is unlocked foryour other survivors bloodwebs
---
lol so cute. feed it!
---
Pig got nerfed to the point her ambush is hardly useful.
---
To be fair, a game with random strangers means a lot less to most people then interacting with them in person (idk why that's just how it is)
---
My favorite killer is either Hag or Demogorgon, and my favorite survivor is probably Steve, he looks cool and second wind is fun.
---
Yes, but I personally recommend not using your shock power right away. Save it for when you're looking for a survivor (say, after Haunted Grounds get activated) to make them scream right away, or if you're good enough to use it to cancel a vault in the middle of a chase
---
It is not necessarily that it is just they probably never leveled up laurie.
---
It’s. A. Game. Not a test of character. Get off y’all a weird judge mental high horse.
---
Scoop
---
Not to mention iron will! Don't sleep to hard on that perk.
---
The game is survivor favored. The reason you're losing isn't because it's survivor favored, it's because you're not very good.
---
Demogorgon get's a couple of seconds (or more with addons) of the undetectable status effect when he comes out of a portal which makes him one stealthy mofo if used right.
---
Whats even worse is that its common af, I am missing 3 dlcs(the most recent 3) and I get it often af with the Myers one, I almost never get any freddy ones(not complaining tho his recent nerf rendered him cancerous and sucked the fun out of his gameplay). The daily quests need a fix

---
d strike in its current state has already been nerfed. the old one didnt require you to be hooked prior. as it is now you just have to make a mental state to either leave them on ground for 60 sec or force them to use it early.  this game is majorly killer sided.
---
Bro don't tell people
---
But now you get to play as prime stalky boi.
---
Yeah, I got that as well. Jake and Laurie are the only two survivors that I don't have "meta" perks from, so the shrines have been really nice!
---
Merge errors dude. I guarantee most of their issues are bad merges.
---
Same boat! I guess now I will go Nancy for her locker heals.
---
This keeps happening to me but it turns from a ritual I don't want to do into one that I do, so I'm not mad.
---
Yeah the end game collapse really did add so much more to dead by daylight. I LOVE the fat bonus everyone gets for actions after EDC
---
Alright I’ve definitely heard that before. So can I ask you, are you a survivor main?
---
Yeah i think youre right. Its shit.
---
Thanks. Ill use that advice for the others too
---
I think the maze would make for a bad ass map.
---
But I want to be Dwight :(
---
Can you play that song that goes beep boop beep boop?
---
I mean i get dc'ing is pretty lame, but i know a lot of people hate going against more than 3 blink nurses. Sure you can counter play it, but you gotta put a TON of effort in to do so, and if its a a solid nurse, they're more than likely gonna get you anyways. Kinda like prayer beads spirit. Not a ton of counter play.
---
People with Decisive tend to get cocky and make stupid decisions. If I see someone playing like that fresh off the hook, especially if they're the obsession, I just slug them and leave them downed for a minute to avoid decisive entirely and go after the person that saved them if they're still around.
---
Decisive is healthy where it is now.  If you don't tunnel you should only get ds'd very rarely.  It's a perk you as a killer have to play into.  You're still a newer player learning the role still so it seems worse than it really is.  The game isn't nearly as survivor sided as you think.  Again you'll feel more confident as time goes on and you learn the mechanics of what goes into playing killer well.
---
I meant in the capacity that everyone died by completing the sacrifice phase. So either being hooked three times, or hooked twice after having reached struggle phase.
---
Pretty much anything that makes it so a Killer can’t just slug for a 4k or use an Ebony Mori to kill everyone after one hook.
---
Had a pretty friendly farming Bubba the other day so we gave him some points. And then he 4k'd us.
---
He apologized in the post game chat and was still pretty friendly, but his reasoning was that he already let too many people go and wanted to play a proper game, but like ???? Why not just play normally then instead of pretending to farm?
---
Decisive strike. Quick and quiet will show up in the next level
---
Ive had an upsurge in mercy recently because i have been stomping thanks to matchmaking, i gifted an escape to 2 in 1 trial today because 1 played very well and didnt deserve to die and one was clearly very very new.
---
Cause he sucks at killer chances are lol.
---
My game won't properly fullscreen any more, I can still see the task bar at the bottom. Not sure if anyone else is having this issue.
---
Which they do lol
---
I’m howling that there’s even the security camera
---
Don’t plan on stopping, I’m hoping it was become a career one day!
---
I could kill the rock climber Kate all day though. They are always the worst.
---
Nah if they get *Dexter*, surely Dexter would have to be the killer.
---
Lol that was smooth
---
I play both, but primarily killer. I guarantee you're not doing as much as you could to win games. The game being survivor favored at a high level doesn't change that.
---
I totally get that it’s an anti tunnel perk but in the cases where I get dsd im not tunneling them. For instance I down Nancy and go after jake park cause he has an insta med kit. Claudette finishes the generator and I hook jake. Then I go for Nancy to hook her but jake gets unhooked. So I go there knowing that claudette is in that area. I run into jake first and then see Claudette and go for her but she had 99d the exit gate so she was already out of there. So I go and pick up jake and I get dsd. I was quite sure it was more than a minute but oh well. Then as soon as he’s out Nancy gets hatch. Like what. And I can’t get all the perks I need to slow down the game enough. Playing as a trapper with not ideal perks. But yeah I’m hoping to get to the point where I can just power through ds
---
Get good. You need to start getting better teachables like Make Your choice, Ruin, Pop goes the Weasel, Surveilance. Without ruin or other anti-gen perks you will get genrushed to shit.
---
Also, if you are getting DS'd a lot then you must be tunnelling or falling for survivor plays... Such as them running infront of the killer so they can distract you from who you're chasing and DS you, them jumping in lockers so you HAVE to auto pick them up.
---
If people you unhook are suddenly running at you, just down their ass and leave them. It will stop other survivors doing gens to go heal them and you won't get DS'd. You gotta play smarter.
---
Some survivors can trick killers well, by acting like they actually wanna get away. I do this as survivor. I heal close to the killer in hope that they see/hear me. Then I run off and try to juke them until my DS timer is 3/4 depleted. 
---
DS has already heen nerfed to shit. It helps people combat campers and tunnelers after getting unhooked, and only does so ONCE per match. It does NOT need to be nerfed any more.
---
\o/
---
If you are really good still then you should be able to reach the rank 15 lockout which preserves your rank from dropping. Also, your behavior is on you as to how you play against new players.
---
😄
---
Poor argument.
---
Dexter only kills serial killers though, but I guess the entity could force him to hunt survivors.
---
It's my only tool to stop you tunellers/campers.  
---
Touch it and die !
---
Will keep that in mind, thanks.
---
 Happy cake day!
---
Pigs M1 is the most useful part of her kit.
---
Most original design too.
---
So glad I don’t have to buy Laurie lol
---
Dwight looks a lot manlier than usual.
---
Note that rank 1 should have a slightly higher escape rate compared to rank 2, as it was using ranks *after* the match, not *before*.
---
It’s just ridiculous that you’re only blaming meg when Dwight was body blocking you too. He obviously made zero attempt to run or try to get away. 
---
And to be frank if you hadn’t had blown up the gen he more than likely wouldn’t have gone straight there.
---
Depends on who the survivor was though. They could make the Survivor a killer from the show. Idk it would just be kinda weird being hunted as Dexter by someone else😁. I mean it'll never happen anyway.
---
How do you usually use diversion? That perk confuses me
---
Some of the ruin spawns in this game really make me sad, how is this supposed to be even considered a good spot for ruin?
---
Yeah, unlike trapper and billy, he wasn’t based on anything really.
---
DBD is not killer sided and definitely not majorly killer sided
---
Yeah this is awesome, but I'm struggling to think how I'd attempt this on console.
---
Inosuke is a good boy.
---
Start switching immediately instead of waiting to see if shock hits. Takes some practice to be confident you’ll get the shock but after awhile it’s second nature.
---
Yep it’ll reappear in the future but *when* is up to the RNG gods.
---
Sorry but 1 red rank in a group doesn’t mean they should be paired with 1 red rank killer. It’s basically the opposite issue of what happened before (getting the worst rank killer).
---
Yeah i thought I couldn’t drop below 15 either, but I did, so :/
---
And yeah, I don’t bully really. I will often mess around in low ranked games because thats kinda fun too
---
Welcome to the big kods playground ST fans
---
Damn never?
---
Yes, but it may help you escape a camper/tunneller at the end of the match. Especially if the person unhooking you doesn't have BT and you don't have Adrenaline.
---
It's still a good perk. Just a little more situational.
---
Best rapper of all time
---
If you've watched the movie, you can hear this picture.
---
DS Works for me 99% of the time
---
I’m died when i looked at Steve’s cheeks
---
Thanks, I thought there was an innate delay or something, or maybe you switch faster if you hit the shock, but apparently not.
---
You'll float too.
---
You must find the actual game exhilarating lol
---
It's pretty mandatory for me until I get to 10-ish.  
---
Otherwise you get hooked and you just see 3 other people slowly crouch walking towards you, no gens getting done. Then one of them will get spotted and hit prompting the other 2 to bolt it as far away from you as possible.
---
There's multiple reasons someone may still be rank 16 with 100s of hours such as -
---
1. Inactivity combined with rank resets, with enough time you can go all the way back to rank 20 from 1
---
2. Intentionally remaining at high rank by not pipping or de-ranking in some way
---
3. They rarely play survivor, it's not like the game ever actually forces you to play the survivor role
---
4. They've left DBD running whilst AFK for many hours, Steam only tracks how long a game runs for not how long it's actively played
---
5. They are indeed simply bad and cannot learn
---
In the higher ranks it’s usually survivor favored. That’s what I mean is specifically higher ranks, like 10 to 1. The only time I tunnel are when it’s only 5 or 6 minutes into the game and they’ve already finished 4 generators. So really ds is salt upon wounds. And of course every game that I have to resort to that, afterwards the survivors complain to me saying I’m a tunneler/camper/etc, and I’ll say it’s because they already gen rushed me and I had to try to secure at least one kill, but yet I’m the toxic one. Like I don’t want to camp or tunnel
---
That's awesome! I'm glad to hear that. Don't let anyone (or yourself) tell you that you can't reach that goal. I used to think so much of our lot in life just boil down to the cards we've been dealt and that just isn't true. Be your own biggest cheerleader. If you aren't in your own corner, it doesn't matter how many of your friends and family are. Positivity and determination are your greatest tools. Good luck to you. You can do it!
---
You bitch, i love you lol &lt;3
---
I was confused at first as well when I started playing doc, you’ll get there with practice.
---
I wish Calm Spirit would prevent your camera from jerking since you're supposed to be calm and all but at base it's part of her power so I'd rather not mess with her since without them she'd fall off the grid real fast.
---
Goodness, i never had that when i give them the hatch
---
today i gave a cutie kate the hatch, bless her sweet noob soul
---
Indeed
---
I appreciate the web changes,it does help....but it's still a shitty rng grind.
---
I really wish there was an option to just purchase the perk you want outright. Even if it's some exorbitant price, say 500k or something, at least you could have a goal to reach instead of this rng slot machine nonsense.
---
I mean if anything yeah a rework would be great. It’s just the state it’s in is so broken, even if it’s already been nerfed before
---
Game still looks great on low if your gpu has a couple gigabytes of vram, but in my opinion the game looks terrible on anything higher because it forces a terrible anti-aliasing filter.
---
Nope, I miss it when going against Spirits, but stealth killers a hell of a lot more fun and scary to go against. Without it, I learn to be more brave on generators. If I have spine chill equipped, it makes me wanna stop working on the gens when it goes off, when I would be just fine if I were to work on it. 
---
I learned that spine chill tells you ‘DANGER’, but you learn to know that there isn’t a lot of danger most of the time.
---
Right, Nurse with 3+blinks is really REALLY good, however, I don't think its a reason to DC. Maybe if they are just mopping the floor with your group then sure, but if you DC at the very start you have no idea if that nurse even knew what they were doing. I'm for sure bias since I have played mostly nurse, I do think that the ability to blink so much is quite crazy, although 3 blinks for a 3-second stun seems p fair to me, beyond 3 it gets stupid.
---
Rank reset can still bring your rank below 15
---
That’s what has your attention about this picture?

---
On my Jake 50+ he only had iron will lvl 1
---
Half the time I find Ruin at the start is just by watching where the killer is going to or leaving at the very start.
---
Are you telling me there’s no counter against a sound whore Spirit that knows your pinpoint location because of surround sound headset and loud breathing?
---
He did that?
---
A killer can control the pace of a match? Better call for nerfs.
---
Clutch maneuvers!
---
That’s too smart of an idea. They already did an ‘okay job’. I think this is far beyond their abilities 
---
(This comment is sarcasm for the idiots that don’t get it)
---
Yea boi
---
Oh okay, sounds pretty cool. I have the perk but wasn't sure how I should use it
---
I like ur username
---
Start all the petitions you want, it will die with the hundreds and thousands of other petitions asking the same thing.
---
BHVR wont do it.
---
Check out this horseshit.

https://youtu.be/v4EQZ01oaFE
---
If you’re looking at Tier rankings, Hillbilly and Nurse are top. IMO, main the killer(s) that you think are most fun. Spirit is pretty high tier and also pretty fun. She’s my main. Along with Myers.
---
Lmao I’ve had people friend request me just to attach a message to the friend request to get salt through to me.
---
This is highly accurate for me
---
What's the Demogorgon got there?
---
If you’ve got the app it’s no time at all. I’ve sent people long messages (always positive!) that took as long to type as this comment,
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8y47g/can_we_address_the_bullying_problem/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
All work and no play is just a hookless version of pop with overcharge added on, would stack with pop and would regress gens 45% after a hook
---
You forgot to add a cooldown to here's Johnny so as it stands right now someone could just slap every locker instead of checking them
---
Temper tantrum could be a cool idea but would be really annoying on killers that can get massive terror radius like doc
---
Mother's instinct is good if the killer had ruin but otherwise it would potentially slow down generators against most killers since great skill checks speed up progress
---
Empathy is basically redrum but you'd see them before they got hit the first time
---
How could you would be really glitchy in how it would work since a killer could potentially moonwalk to a hook and it wouldn't be able to be used, plus what would happen if they swung before you got in front of them, it would be like a pallet stun that you got hit from, it's also only useful in a very small amount of situations since they have to have been hooked twice before
---
The killer power is a cool idea since it would take away a need for ruin, an idea for an add-on for it could be that the parts aren't accessible until one of the sabotaged gens is at 99% and then becomes stuck there, that way survivors couldn't just go find the parts immediately and just ignore the power completely
---
Jack would still need something else for his power or it would be incredibly underpowered, maybe to fit the theme of Jack as you chase someone you fill a meter of determination that once full would allow you to break a pallet with your basic attack instead of kicking it
---
That happened to me as survivor and the skill check didn’t show up, and the killer had ruin, so I was basically forced/ limited to run the killer around the whole match
---
I totally agree with the first part
---
As a Legion main, I can honestly say that it would be a great rework
---
Killer must not have headphones lolol
---
Opposite -- rank 1 should have a lower escape rate than is shown for that reason. The data still does show that survivors escape more often than not at a high level, which is even more poignant considering that SWF allows survivors to be literally boosted.
---
Looks like the Dead By Daylight “Hardcore Mode” Beta
---
Wraith too? Are you sure?
---
Happened in the clip I posted.
---
But we all know that wglf stack is just worth too much too resist
---
Wow nice job
---
Did you watch Bricky's video?
---
They mostly play pig
---
Do the "We'll be Right Back" Eric Andre meme for maximum funnies
---
They probably play a lot of pig
---
Theyre more to dbd into a game thats not every game nurse with 4 megs
---
I’m probably not even that high tbh. I’m not sure what ranks are what yet, I’ve been playing for a week and my rank number is 15 or 14 now. I do pretty decent against other killers with decent team mates but this one is just too much.
---
Probably had the beads because I heard absolutely nothing. And I have surround sound speakers.
---
James needs to be in this game.
---
The only nerf it needs is that it needs to not be able to be used after getting grabbed out of a locker. It's the cheesiest fucking bullshit when a DS+Head On survivor sprints into a locker in plain view and they know that they are literally **invincible** in there and the killer has zero winning situation. You can't slug them, you can't grab them out, you can't approach the locker after DS expires due to head on. You just lose.
---
Otherwise the perk is fine. 
---
I personally hate being forced to slug literally every survivor I see for up to a full minute after they come off a hook (I feel like its BM and boring gameplay, especially since they MIGHT not even have the perk) but that is the meta forced upon us. Slugging isn't even my playstyle.
---
It's complete garbage they pushed this patch through with such a major known issue.
---
I thought the dev's didn't ban people
---
Spine Chill is still super good for just the speed boost to vaulting.
---
Thanks
---
I've actually had an idea for Jack Torrance, part of his power being he could break window vaults with his fireaxe.
---
STBFL, Unrelenting, Spirit fury, Enduring. You just absolutely run people down.
---
But he looked so cute haha
---
He vaults faster, and has a longer lunge but other than that it's still the same as tier two, he might get a bigger terror radius too but I can't confirm that
---
For me, as a level 19 killer who just started playing two weeks ago I actually decided to try this tonight and it worked out well for me. I can't chase for shit and somebody can literally Loop me around a barrel. Against my better judgement more times than not after one or two loops I stopped and immediately went to the closest gen. Three out of four times sure enough there was somebody on it that I was able to scare away and then damage it. So at least for new low ranked killers this sounds like good advice.
---
Wait... you abandoned Wraith for shocky boy? Brave men venture further down the tier list
---
I had the same thing happen to me on PS4.
---
I like trapper because being successful as him has a lot to do with stratigic trap placements making him very satisfying. For survivor its my boy david not for any particular reason I just started with him I dont play survivor much.
---
All I'm seeing is the medic from the team fortress 2 comics
---
His footsteps? Forget those.
---
He breathes louder than Nurse, Shape, and Clown combined
---
I just wanted someone get some points but I guess being nice to killers gets under your skin. I don't know if they get their points or not, but you being you.
---
Bond is better
---
L
---
you said 5 minutes longer, basically saying she takes the same amount of time to master, which is saying that she is as easy to master as the other killers, which is straight wrong.
---
Point is, the is no quiet or tiny to this dude.
---
Necer look at steam discussions, i swear anyone who comments in them is 8 or younger
---
Hmm yeah, you’re right about that. I do secretly hope they don’t nerf prayer beads. What’s more satisfying than snatching a player of a totem or gen?
---
You should have put John Wayne Gayce as the Netflix adaptation.
---
I don’t even think the game is Survivor Favored. I think it’s heavily Killer Favored
---
Not true, anyone can camp and get 4k all the way through green ranks.
---
Can just minimize the chat on PC.
---
F
---
39.99$
---
WAH
---
he shoots, he scores!
---
No I think it goes bee boo boo bop, boo boo bop
---
Some may think that this isn't a very spectacular play since using an instaheal is a rather simple process.
---
Then again, you did throw in a nice 360 to go with it.
---
Damn I really bought Laurie for DS and here we are 🤦🏼‍♀️
---
Sad because of nerfs
---
Happens on PS4 too. I just immediately go ahead and close the app the moment I see the unreachable message. It happens way too frequently.
---
eh, imo survivors that are too far apart in rank shouldn't even be able to play together at all. The survivors are the ones choosing to play with much lower ranked people, they should be the ones to burden the unbalanced nature of that decision, not the killer.
---
Same here, just hoping I can earn enough more in the next 7 days.
---
Breathing is almost inaudible for me but I can hear everything else just fine
---
Idc about healing. It's a waste of time. That's what adrenaline is for. Do gens and leave.
---
You do you though.
---
Arcimedes! Get out of there, it’s filthy.
---
Its good on doctor builds. Absolute garbage on pretty much everyone else
---
Yeah, I’m figuring out my perks and that’s helping a lot. I use Meg with her sprint perk. I’m working on getting the self heal perk from Claudette or whatever her name is as well.
---
Doesn't mean it didn't happen.
---
Who would've thought people would hold negative opinions of a person that's intentionally annoying to other people?
---
u r a god, thanks!
---
Haven't tried any if the instant heal stuff. Still too trash. Eager to try it after seeing this. Looks fun in a pinch.
---
Lol. Nice troll comment.
---
Funny that I'm here to procrastinate doing an essay
---
It’s really fun, just make sure u know how to do it first, once I took an insta-heal and I had no idea how to use it, maybe go in custom to learn
---
git gud*. Its because the game is entirely PvP. That is the nature of a PvP game... behaviour tries to make sure both sides can win but in the end one is competing with another.
---
FYI Distressing is useless for BP gain, ESPECIALLY on Demo. It only makes you hit the cap for Deviousness faster, which is largely useless since Demo gets such a massive amount of BP for everything he does. The only real use for Distressing is for Doctor to increase his Static Field
---
I'm a dirty dirty vulture and I LOVE it.
---
It was nerfed but it's still one of the best perks to have. I dont use it because I'm bad at hitting skill checks lol
---
Worth it lol
---
Lol. I noticed that in the patch notes. It's like, yeah they should normalize the movement speed to ensure a consistent experience, but poor pig has been hit with so many small nerfs. Maybe throw her a bone once in a while.
---
Sure, that's why I'm upvoted. Feel free to shoot me a PM, I'd gladly give you a link to my Steam profile, this way you'll see I'm no newbie :)
---
Adorable.
---
They tend to camp and tunnel for me
---
You don’t need to get a 4K to double pip.
---
Without ruin or luck. 2 gens minimum pop at first hook. Maybe you get 2 hooks by the time 1 gen is left in red ranks.
---
BHVR kind of did their own Jason like character and their license is tied to F13. Its likely that their deal mentioned exclusivity.
---
Sprint burst is probably among the worst exhaustion perks. Go for balanced landing or dead hard. Adrenaline is insane and it's on meg so you already have it. Self care is a great perk too if you dont want to rely on others.
---
Just go in a locker if the chase is getting close then x)
---
Just started playing recently and I've been wondering, how do you know when you've gotten a hit with the flashlight? Is there some sort of visual cue or something that tells you it was successful?
---
It's not fully PvP, survivors should still have to work together for the most part. I've been in quite a few games where my teammates only cared about themselves making it.
---
It is killer favored since the devs want 2 people to escape and 2 people to die each match on average, last time they showed the stats it was less than 50% escape rate.
---
A zero perk build works against bad survivors..lol.
---
An 'average' in a game like DBD where there's such a HUGE difference in skill between red ranked and the rest absolutely makes it more one sided. Sorry you won't be able to bully newbie killers anymore I guess.
---
My humble apologies developer-san. I didn't realize I was talking someone with such a deep understanding and totally unbiased view of game balance.
---
It's the sad truth, this game has so much potential honestly. The amount of dlc such as the pig Michael and Demogorgon is pretty damn cool. But the game is just so unfair, toxic community, so many bugs, no cross platform, basically the lack of balancing and fixing a lot of stuff in the game. I honestly feel bad for people who buy the game because I feel like people are just buying the game because of the cool Demogorgon dlc and realising just seeing how actually shit the game is and they never touch the game again.
---
That's because you're playing with ranks 18 and 1.
---
They can't get another licence? That dude that took the rights back is an A hole.
---
Really wish you could populate custome with bots . Would help immensely practicing this.
---
Yehea boi
---
It doesn't do that
---
Yeah, no more easy wins for you. Good riddance.
---
Any killer who does not run it. You know they dont play red ranks lol.
---
Or all three would be awesome
---
The game is dead now. Why not give the licence to another or have multiple licences?
---
Like I said, you and BHVR think in extremes which is extremely silly. 3 yellow ranks and 1 red rank doesn’t mean the killer needs to be red ranked. It makes it not fun for both the killer and survivors.
---
So is this that Fnaf game everyone been talking about?
---
(You can downvote me now.)
---
Same, although I don’t think bots could prepare u for knowledge like mind games, but they’ll be helpful for warmups if they are ever added
---
Fair. It can be frustrating but thats just multiplayer. At least these games are short and at least on PC youre in the next one in like 5 min. I play some games that take 30-45 min and having a teammate play poorly then really feels bad lol.
---
This would be nice but at the same time I dont want it because my pc overheats and shuts down a lot on this game.
---
 What do you mean? I don't have any friends to play with so will never get a chance to test it and Custom.
---
The flashlight beam begins to shrink and then pulse out. That’s when you know you’ve blinded the killer.
---
Some killers (mainly the doctor) like having a big terror radius.
---
Other can get rid of their terror radius, so it can help with BP farming.
---
Then look at ur keybinds and maybe try to figure it out, in console u hold down R2 and press L1, idk about PC
---
Not really, that is a really old quote and its irrelevant since you can pretty much tell whatever the fuck you want with statistics (and if you pick certain rank spots its way higher than 50% or other combinations of statistics). Also they put out a warning that they were using very basic statistics and people shouldn't draw conclusions out of them. Guess thats why we never got any of those again, people don't know how to properly understand statistics.
---
The game has always been survivor favored except for a little brief moment way back in the days. Its simply that way because there are 4 survivors for every killer, it makes sense to please a player base 4x bigger.
---
I played the PC version before console, wouldn't mind switching back but id lose all my progress. Wish you could link accounts.
---
It takes a few min. Thankfully games are decent length
---
I do and I sometimes dont run it if it's all solo queues and I want to mess around
---
I just ended up disabling the chat because i couldn’t take the constant bitching about me being bad or whatever. i just play how i want now.
---
Its a daily my dude :)
---
Lot of people like the mediocre or bad Killers because they seem cool and mysterious due to a lack of people playing them. I've only ever played the hillbilly like three times just because I'm sick of seeing him practically every match
---
Disclaimer: I was walking because this was the second time he came out of nowhere and downed me so I was very scared and became immersed for the first time in a while lol
---
Its full PvP... its not because in league/dota/cs you play with 4 other players that you care about them, you only care about them as far as it helps you.
---
It is fully PvP as there are no adversaries in the game that are not other human players.
---
I remember devs saying in some kind of an interview that cross-save is coming, but not on the launch
---
Pig might as well be a survivor with object of obsession and BHVR is just tunneling her
---
Thanks, that's what I was wondering. On PS4.
---
Really good jukes but at that point you probably could have ran for the other door &amp; made it cause he obviously couldn’t touch you lol.
---
It boosts EVERYTHING
---
The idea of balance is to put players of equal skill against each other. When a player with 5 hours plays in a team with a player with 2000 hours, the idea of balance doesn't exist.
---
Anyways, we're repeating ourselves over and over again. Time to stop. Have a nice day
---
*il vento d’oro intensifies*
---
It’s a competitive game, no one wants to play at a disadvantage because their teammates don’t know how to play
---
Ah, thank you very much.
---
Switch?
---
I'm on PC
---
I was literally so lost, I was actually waiting for the other guy to escape since I had found hatch, for all I know he was probably teabagging on the exit gate
---
oinksters all of them
---
Because money. If they want the license they have to pay BIG. BHVR won’t do that. Also it’s likely that the F13 devs just simply won’t sell anyways because then it removes literally the last of their minuscule traffic away to their direct competition.
---
LMAO you can see how you panicked when chase music started, ran into him, spazzed out, then came to your senses and tried to expose him, 10/10 clip
---
They're filthy pigs.
---
Is demogorgon a stealth killer? I know part of his power is, but it's only a few seconds
---
I’ve always had a pipe dream of them somehow collaborating with Scooby-Doo to do the Robot at the amusement park, with the robot being the killer and the park being the map.
---
If you become immersed its a win in my book
---
Spine Chill is a must for me, helps me with all killers except early game Myers or Scratched Mirror Myers. It tells me so much information as a solo player and helps me both in stealth and chase plays equally.
---
From what I'm reading everywhere it doesn't
---
Mind if I use this as my xbox profile picture? I’ll add credit in my bio
---
I had this happen as Spirit before except I kept disappearing and reappearing.
---
What a dickhead, he wasn’t gonna let you out even if you made it, just wanted to taunt before the mori
---
How so? :v
---
u/Flashthehedgehog
---
Its good at all tiers. Just better at t1
---
Absolutely wonderful post. Some people allow the anger to get to their head and fail to see the other side of the coin while doing it.
---
But...how could any professional allow that?
---
i have this issue with Pc aswell so it can’t be just a console thing
---
I don't think it's the quite you were talking about but
---
"There are 3 types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics"
---
Lovely expression, wonderful drawing!
---
I get that. I’m not feeling the same pressure you were in game so to me it just seems like “oh just run for the other door” 
---
He also could’ve been waiting in case you needed a save but more than likely he was waiting to teabag.
---
Nah, he was pretty chill. He only showed mercy on me for a second  because I dropped my item for him, I sure didn't expect a gurgly lad with an ebony mori to let me live
---
Wow, that is one driven individual. I haven't gotten losers that are willing to go \*THAT\* far, yet.
---
Or the killer eats your DS, and tunnels you anyway then complain about it still being too strong when they “lose the game because DS”
---
And then after the chase my blind as is looking through the grass with tears in my eyes lookinf for the item
---
I use Adrenaline and Sprint Burst but Adrenaline only comes in handy when the exit gates are powered up. Sprint burst has helped me escape the killer many many times and as of now, it’s the best one I have. I suppose that is subject to change though.
---
Yeah, cause he knew I was on my last hook, and he just stayed there
---
It just sucks man. It just sucks. I really liked F13 it just needed balance updates and more active players. I just want Jason.
---
It's true. I also just use my KB to type messages, but I admit I have a unique set up with mine at my desk (I game on monitors).
---
Those few seconds is all the demogorgon needs to get the jump on a survivor, like pig.
---
*sad oink*
---
Ahhh true. Well again really good job. I can only dream of juking a killer that hard especially a billy.
---
Tnks &lt;3
---
Thanks, u’ll get there at some point
---
Ah yes a children's classic, I remember these books.
---
If it's an old quote then there must be a new quote right? Link please.
---
Very angular face combined with sfm lighting.
---
Yes it does
---
If only.
---
Im a masochist, so i really like hard games. Playing survivor of course.
---
When I’m fried I like to play either wraith or ghostface just because they are simple. It’s fun haha
---
Smarmy bastard
---
Definitely DS unless you like being tunnelled.
---
No shit, no one side should control the pace of the match - that should come entirely down to the players.
---
I mean if we get dexter he HAS to be the killer, the survivor can be James Doakes or Debra.
---
Entity was like "ya being toxic? Fuck you."
---
I feel that. When the skill check lands on the edge and fails is frustrating. Are you on console?
---
A couple is being very generous.
---
so if I’m rank 1 and want to play with yellow or green rank friends they’re just gonna get shit on by a red rank killer? yeah this is big brain time
---
Adrenaline is top tier one of the best perks on survivor. Sprint burst is helpful as a noob but there are other exhaustion perks that are far superior.
---
RideWithTheMob
---
Pretty sure a lot of killers dont know what 9 or more hook actions mean
---
Nope I'm on PC just genuinely not good at consistently hitting great skillchecks. And theres also the laggy skillcheck countdown bs that doesn't help.
---
I mean, look at it this way, if the desync'd timer wasn't a bug,  you still would have died. You weren't living in that match regardless.
---
Thats.... Disturbingly accurate

I had a similar story involving a Meg. Baby Meg absolutely panicked each time I saw her, which was often since her panicking made her even more obvious, and would often run into me during chases. She basically jumped into my arms multiple times. I let her find the hatch, and in the lobby, she told me it was her first game, which made her actions make a lot more sense.
---
Great didn't we already have this bug before and now it is back. Fix one thing and the same thing comes back.
---
I was refering to his friend that was mentioned.
---
&gt; But the game is just so unfair, toxic community, so many bugs, no cross platform, basically the lack of balancing and fixing a lot of stuff in the game. 
---
dbd summed up pretty well in a single sentence.
---
because of this i bought ghostface, i would be prone to doing shit like this thank you
---
2 best in the game are nurse and spirit. Nurse is difficult but very rewarding once you're good. Spirit is a lot easier to pickup and as long as you have ear and game sense you'll do well with her.
---
Everyone is entitled to an opinion but I regret to inform that, your opinion, is incorrect
---
You are a great at drawing. Keep it up
---
Can you read?
---
&gt;Guess thats why we never got any of those again, people don't know how to properly understand statistics.
---
Nope we probably will never have a new quote because people can't understand statistics.
---
Well thats not my point. My point is why should i have to go easy on survivers which are my opponites in the match just do they can get their BP? The survivers wouldnt give a shit whether i got my points, why should i care about theres?
---
Inosuke? How did he get to the dbd subreddit?

Bond is great for selling out your immersed teammates who hide for 5 minutes after spine chill lights up once.
---
Wait what?
---
Finally some easy to remember practical advice! 
---
ill make sure to try this later, I always have trouble remembering how to run loops, but this seems simple enough to work for a dumbass like me
---
The creators of F13 are in a lawsuit and nobody can use jason since it’s settled, that’s why f13 the game is dead, devs can’t put more content in the game legally
---
Haha yeah matchmaking is all sorts of wonky! 
---
Oh thats great to hear! What build did you decide to go with? 
---
Yeah you need something to slow the game down with myers especially for early game, i would recommend dying light as it would help slow the game down but it wont help where u need it most which is early game getting out of tier 1.
---
Yeah ps4
---
I love bing bong and will always play him for fun. I love his skinny little leggies and the way his feet squish when he walks. He's just so freaking adorable!
---
So basicly, this change would make some matches that are already done a minute longer for no reason at all. Neat.
---
It's annoying as killer because you have to wait awhile to get a game only to have it end in like 2 minutes because you're playing rank 20s.
---
Baby dweet
---
https://youtu.be/t8u0jRxN2kQ this video helped me a lot when I first learned killer. Obviously everything is situational, but I think he does a very good job at breaking down a lot of scenarios and once you get better you'll be able to predict survivor movements and do your own "mindgames".
---
I'd guess they gen rushed cause they saw that secret offering, I wouldn't blame them
---
People who wait at the exit gate and don’t do shit for the last guy trying to escape are so fucking dumb man. And then it’s always the dudes who didn’t do shit the entire game
---
Alright thank you, just didn’t want to use without asking since you put so much effort into it!
---
Ahhhh shit I’m about to get D Strike
---
Then again, there was Myers not being in the game for a month on Xbox
---
Every action is X% faster
---
Oh Shit it the robot
---
There shouldn't be a punishment to people who do gens too quickly, they should just slow down gen repair speed
---
PicsArt, seems like it wouldn’t let me apply the text without subscribing to a gold membership so I just screenshotted it. Maybe find something else though?

Did you really 360 no scope hook?
---
Honestly same. So many people tunnel for the Mori, it’s just not fun. If you’re going to take me out of the game early then I’m just gonna end the game early by being a gen jockey.
---
Or quadruple streamers on the survivor side and the killer runs an ebony mori with iridescent hatchet huntress.
---
And then proceeds to still go full on murder mode.
---
The problem is that no survivors know how to counter camping. It’s really the easiest way to win, unless you want to maximize points.
---
I see.
---
What shitty phrasing.
---
Do you not see the hatch he was about to jump into? Low iq
---
To be completely honest, I cheated with a piece of tape on the screen.
---
What would hell me escape the killer during the match?
---
Cool idea and concept!
---
A true child

*Also Laughs in killer main*

Actually quick and quiet might've saved you since good ol' Ace might've distracted him. RIP your potential big brain play.
---
and i appreciate that, wish all people were like you when it comes to art! Thank you again &lt;3
---
fucking adorable
---
Agreed, rather they’d just keep him shit so we never have to see him again
---
I really want this for my Edgy Bois [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONVJnkbAm0I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ONVJnkbAm0I)
---
A lot of new survivors think killers are op, and a lot of new killers think survivors are op.
---
While "git gud" is a stupid saying that solves nothing, it is relevant to new players who think the game is against them.
---
no
---
Lol. I can imagine some employee was like "hey, I animate a little bit, lemme show you what I got!"
---
I actually agree, it's honestly better to use the perk slot for a more useful perk
---
Are the laggy skillchecks due to frames or just in general. The skillchecks sometimes skips a few frames on console (btw I have to wait ten minutes to reply, idk why, but I do)
---
Ok the reason I say Agitation is its like a rich mans iron grasp, as you move faster while carrying a survivor and you should get them to further hooks or hook them faster and with experience you can counter their wiggling easily.
---
I was thinking ruin because of course lol
---
Thrilling Tremors to block gens and find which ones are being worked on. 
---
Pop goes the weasel to kick the gen they are working on to slow them down
---
And discordance to find out which gen they are working on and maybe getting a survivor exposed
---
Is im all ears really that good?
---
Legion needs to go to the back of the line honestly. He’s miserable to play/play against, but if he’s in the game so be it, there are ways to beat him. Doctor and Bubba are definitely first, as both are underwhelming and have stronger counter parts (Billy for Leatherface, Legion and Pig for Doc [slow down]). After them I think Pig herself needs to be buffed slightly, just to have her on the same level as Ghost face.
---
His down side is his cool down he loses it the minute he attacks so he can’t use his power for a while
---
I am having this issue as well with SWF. Then when we do finally get into a lobby, either not everyone in the party made it to the lobby or we get kicked immediately. Very frustrating..
---
Im more concerned about the lower left corner.
---
I agree. I actually started on F13. The first trailers for DBD did not make the game look good to me. And when I heard how horribly buggy it was when it first got posted to PS4 (and also how it was on PC) I chose F13. DBD looked boring and confusing, the trailers were bad, and it just looked like: 
---
- Do a Gen.
---
- Hide from Killer.
---
- Die. 
---
F13 had more you could do, there were more players, and it honestly seemed like the better game. Problem is BHVR adapted. They started actively fixing issues, and they continued to add to the game. They were the underdogs from the beginnings F13’s advantage was the license. With F13 all they could do was add skins. BHVR kept fixing issues, added skins, and characters. And then they realized they key was Licensed characters. That changed the whole game for them. F13 Devs got too confident and lazy. And then there was the fiasco with the lawsuit putting the final nail in the coffin. 
---
BHVR just needed better marketing, and devs (And they still do need better devs because honestly there are only a few who are even remotely respectable at this point.).
---
If you’re bad, sure. But it’s not
---
Roblox memes 101 guide.
---
You only use it when you actually want a big terror radius
---
The Bloodpoints gain is terrible, because it’s in-game increase, not post-game
---
It makes you get to the cap easier, so it will give you at most 4000 points and if the match gets long that number quickly drops to 0
---
Drunk billy whiskey 🐷
---
Honestly, every time I uses OoO I get ignored cus the killer thinks I'm a god or something
---
Exactly
---
Just so you know : www.steamcommunity.com/id/laborgnesse I'm putting your username in my bio.
---
It's not balanced, the average was balanced. If everyone in my group was around the same rank, it wouldn't be a problem. If we have two rank 1 and two rank 20, logically we should get someone around 10, not 20.
---
To be honest, I am currently like.. 17-18 as killer because I've not touched that role in 2-3 months.. DbD doesn't quite have the same appeal anymore.
---
TIL I’m a moron
---
just gotta get them blendettes to drop every pallet while they do 2 gens and boom EZ game
---
Game Devs said that the killers are meant to win and the Killers are host. Any killer can lag switch and down you at any given time
---
Bond has a completely different functionality
---
That basketball head tho
---
You don’t really get much further down than Wraith
---
Many disconnects and laggy killers after the patch.  
---
Is there a hotfix incoming?
---
Ok, this may sound stupid, but has happened to some freinds of mine. Were you in a lobby together? Or did you forget?
---
Sometimes my game just dies ok
---
Happened to me and muh girl too
---
If ur unable to not tunnel for a minute that's on you
---
60 survivor sacrifices damn
---
Because it’s been designed as a game where two sides try to outgun themselves. You not only have mind-games, perks that can be countered and counters that have counters, but you also have the “power moments” on both sides like Moris/Instaheals.
---
That’s why a “Casual Mode” won’t work. Killers have to “sweat” to apply pressure and not get “genrushed” and that also forces the other side to tryhard
---
It would be stupid to use it on that one idk man, if you didn’t get blood point at all you dumb piece of shit. Cosmetics are trash and you should already have the characters you want. Most effective way to level? Get more bloodpoints. Dumb ass bruh. Stay in your yellow ranks where your puny brain belongs
---
What kind of brush you are using to make it look like that, I’ve been look for it everywhere. You using photoshop?
---
I have a fan concept for a robot killer, so yeah, I would love a robot killer, instead of the heartbeat he could have a turbine like sound or some engine.
---
"The mechanism"
---
That goes for Resilience. Spine Chill’s only non-sped up action is Recovering from Dying. No problem, I just recently learned as well after coming back from a break.
---
The only change DS needs is "deactivates after another survivor was hooked" so it won't be fucking abused and actually be antitunnel.
---
I didn't tunnel I went after someone else hooked them and then went to a gen that got finished. If you call that tunneling then sure ig I cant avoid it
---
Gargantuan TR DR builds when it gets down to three gens.. but there are other options
---
or this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qORYO0atB6g
---
Pretty sure the full chapter is missing
---
well yeah i just said unplayable to mean he was undisputibly (i think)⁰ the worst in the game for a while, in a lot of ways i prefer the idea of old freddy, like the dream transition soul screaming was a really cool animation and i wish he still had it, and seeing survivors auras was cool
---
He never even blew the gen...
---
i liked him because he was the most different, but on the other hand that kinda made him worse because of that
---
Wraith is not the worst killer, I wish people would stop saying this. His addons aren’t the worst and neither is his power. Clown and Doctor are below Wraith. I’d say even with yellow addons Wraith is high-mid tier.
---
I'd rather have Jeepers Creepers..... Seeing him in his coat and hat in the distance coming after you would be dope af !!!.... I feel like the license wouldn't be expensive tbh.
---
you are also entitled to an opinion and by the power vested in me i pronounce yours as more incorrect
---
Not always their fault, though.
---
Doesn’t matter, actions speak louder than words. I main both sides easily, if so many survivors weren’t dogshit at this game (people can’t loop), all 4 survivors would escape so much more often. Since people are bad it evens out but only in solo q. SwF makes the game survivor sided. And killers can lagswitch, but they aren’t supposed to and it’s not common lol. It’s also why dedicated servers are coming. The game is only killer sided at the newbie ranks, anything else and it’s just you and your teammates are bad lol
---
Yup. Happened to me all day yesterday
---
😂😂😂 funny
---
It really wasn’t balanced. Most of the time, the matchmaking wasn’t actually the average, it was based on the host of the party. And having even one survivor who is simply impossible to catch can really screw over a killer. A rank 10 killer really isn’t in a position to deal with a rank 2 survivor if that survivor plays sweaty. Survivors have teammates that can make up for mistakes and inexperience, the killer just has themselves. Besides, they’ve been trying to close the gap between swf and solos for a long time, and I think this is a step towards that. You already get such an advantage by being in a party, being put against tougher killers seems pretty fair
---
More like broke Jake
---
Sorry bruh.... I use my T Mobile S10 hotspot. Don't report me
---
Wraith stealth ? My *BING BING BONG* would like to disagree
---
1 teammate can fuck up the whole game. I’m sticking with it’s heavily Killer favored lol but you are right. It’s easier with SWF than going solo. Although when I’m solo i only have myself to worry about
---
How about we add Jeepers Creepers and focus on him
---
I thought they were leakbait
---
Didn't really think of that...sorry. just a little frustrated.  Also happy cake day
---
His addons are amazing. I wouldn’t even argue that he’s better than clown. It’s that he’s so dependent on strong addons that make people adverse to playing him.
---
I feel like there's a huge divide between Noob's viewers, and most of the other DBD youtubers' viewers for some reason. Also why do they have an Ohmwrecker wraith skin?
---
That is beautiful!! Good job, I’m amazed
---
That shouldn't happen and it mostly didn't happen before the 3.2 update.  With 3.2, for whatever reason, matchmaking was being skewed for survivors towards rank 20 killers even with survivors being ranked as high as 12/13.  That was broken and it needed fixed.  But instead of just fixing it or reverting it back to how it was before 3.2 they've gone from one bad extreme to another.
---
its a modified brush pen in paint tool sai
---
*happy Demogorgan noises*
---
Hag and Susie/Legion
---
Hag, games are calming and even with common add-ons I can easily apply pressure to multiple places.
---
Legion is just crazy fun, stab stab stab let me have you drop all these pallets, oh you gave me a 3 gen in a pallet-less area? GG survivors you are mine to hook and scream at.
---
I was thinking of making a concept for him as well so dont worry
---
Leatherface needs to not lose speed while charging and Clown needs to start with more bottles or raise his recharge speed.
---
He's a good player alright, I just can't deal with the unnecessary potty mouth, vulgar AF.
---
Yo did you guys know that there is a score event called 'killer burn'? You get it by shining your flashlight on an cloaked wraith and if you do so he gets stunned for 3 seconds and becomes visible again
---
Do you not understand what the current issue with the EGC collapse timer is? Low IQ back 'atcha.
---
The timer is desync'd. It will show differently for the survivors than what it actually is. On the killer's end it will show up correctly. 
---
He had just as much time as if there was no bug. He would never make the hatch.
---
*title comes up*
---
*fiddle your diddle til daylight*
---
"I think something's different about this trailer"
---
But those perks all have counter play. Break totems for noed, slugs for ds, go after unhooked for borrowed time.
---
If the game itself punishes people for doing their job with no way to avoid it except playing worse, then that's no fun for anybody.
---
THICC!!!
---
Wraith was where I started out. The bing bing boi holds a special place in my heart
---
They literally bought out a survivor who helps keep people in the game. If you want to help your friends, run a combination of Bill and Steve perks. No one is going to get better by sitting on a gen while their high rank buddy runs circles around the killer.
---
The problem is not the money, the Problem is Victor Salva, if you don't know him go to wikipedia and see why the devs have stated they don't want to do bussiness with him.
---
Delete spirit
---
Oh my god that is bullshit wtf
---
People asked me if I was going to main Wraith first, I don't think I was but turn out he was my first main to get to P3 level 50
---
I like this a lot - so BHVR won't do it. That's how these things work.
---
So far I’ve been using pwyf, best for last, rancor, and bitter murmur! I’m going off your first suggestion but have been switching out noed with rancor from time to time. I definitely need to time my tier 3 better but otherwise it’s been going pretty decent! I’d like to get better at getting those 4k’s tho
---
I actually wanted that happen to me, for trophy.
---
Are you sure you weren't the killer
---
I like the chase music and how some have certain music like The Demogorgon and Myers. Menu music though, I literally can’t listen to music from the 3 year anniversary in game. That I am all for
---
Yes, obviously. Fix your internet.
---
you could say that about all of the tiny ones and then you would end up with the wraith being the og
---
There are 2 mindgames that work for me at the shack. 
---
The first is the windowfake. You pretend to follow the survivor in the shack but last second turn and run along the wall to the window. This can lead to a slow vault back into the shack that you can hit through, or closes enough distance so that they have to drop the pallet next.
---
The other is quickly double or tripple vault the window. Works more often than you think and either closes distance or pushes them away from the shack.
---
Oh yea I remember reading about the Creator of JP did some pedo shit I think. I almost forgot....
---
But to be fair... They don't need to call him JP. But idk if likeness would play a role
---
4/5 players agree that killers should all go kill themselves! /s  
---
  
---
People need to accept that there needs to be a first person out of the game. and most of the time, it's much more efficient for the killer to tunnel and get rid of 25% of the enemy than to hook multiple survivors to no advantage.  
---
Imagine if a chess player started trash talking his opponent because they made a smart move instead of a dumb one...  
---
I mean, they COULD modify the game to make it less efficient to tunnel, like by reducing repair/healing/whatever speed for each hook, but increase it a bit to match the overall speed when someone gets sacrificed. That way it would be a bit disadvantageous to tunnel, would slightly 'punish' survivors for being hooked, even if they don't die, and at he same time it would increase the chance of survival when survivors are in a 1-2 VS 1 situation.  
---
But no, they don't do that, so stop blaming killers for playing efficiently, otherwise, you will have to berate survivors for doing any pallet looping or any effective strategy.  
---
As a good rule of life, what's good for the goose is good for the gander. I'm not sure what that is, but it means that you shouldn't be a fucking hypocrite Chris!*1  
---
*1 May or may not apply to a person named Chris*
---
How so? I have no problems when I play survivor or any other game for that matter. I play alot of League and I never have internet hiccups
---
Was it a Wraith?
---
Could level her up and save your shards for cosmetics!
---
Plus it helps when you get a laurie daily for her to have *some* perks
---
Was it ever useful outside of certain loops anyway? The uncrouch m1 is way better for stealth attacks
---
When did BBQ and Ruin come out for killer?Did it just pass?
---
I taste a survivor only main.
---
Question. If you have a perk unlocked already and buy it from the Shrine during Double Bloodpoints weekend, does the Shrine give you double the bloodpoints?
---
Which old matchmaking was miserable? Where it took the average of an SWF group or where it was actually broken and putting whoever against rank 20 killers?
---
I think taking the average of an SWF group is the most balanced approach. Having a lobby of rank 3, 13, and 17 should get you a killer around rank 11, not around rank 3.
---
A killer around rank 11 should have little problem with the rank 13 and no problem with the rank 17 survivor. A killer at rank 3 would absolutely destroy that group to the point that the low ranks would have zero fun and question why they bought the game.
---
Saying "just don't play with your friends" isn't a solution and if this is how MM is going to be for SWF groups then I can see deranking becoming a bigger problem with the high ranking players dropping so their friends can actually stand a chance.
---
Yeah I really hate how the counter play is to go jerk off for a minute and bam, fuck your perk. There seriously needs to be better countermeasures against tunneling, I'm really sick of losing rank because there's no penalties or consequences for it.
---
That’s almost at half way as it killed you, holy shit. I hope they fix this soon.
---
Smurfs are gross. You should jump into a hot oil pot.
---
Now seriously, you should be ashamed. If you want to learn a new killer, use your real account, don't do things that could get your ass banned.
---
Haha I’m pretty sure I wasn’t
---
odd bulb LULW that's arguably the worst flashlight addon
---
agreed 😂 happy cake day btw!
---
Wraith is my main. I don't play killer much, nor am I that good... But damn have I learned how to use his invisibility to my advantage
---
Idk the "survivors" are pretty scary
---
SOME BODY
---
Shadowborn? Trash
---
Lightborn is where it's at, that perk makes you literally unstoppable
---
He’s just role playing Michael or ghostface REALLY well
---
It's okay, Thanatophobia is pretty terrible. Although, when paired with with the new Dying Light, it isn't as awful.
---
Lmao you can get banned for this
---
It’s not mandatory for the killer to let you live, but a lot of killers are nice and will typically let the last survivor leave through the hatch or exit gates.
---
As a killer, the only survivors I’ll give hatch to are the ones I respect, so yeah, I think it’s also a respect thing
---
It might of been a troll comment, but he did have a point. He wasn't utilizing his skills, his build wasn't the greatest, and he made bad choices.
---
He gets his first hook and kicks the first gen he sees at &lt;25%.  He gets his second hook and goes to check which of two gens most need it the most.  He skips one and then the other gen is already regressing from his earlier kick.    After he gets a down, he leaves the person down because he believes they have DS.  He wastes his time and picks the guy up anyway to, low and behold, get DSed.  His Pop Goes the Weasel runs out.  He should have left the guy on the ground and just kicked another gen or looked for a survivor.
---
He didn't utilize two of his perks at all, all game and spent a good chunk of time squandering a Pop Goes the Weasel plus picked up a survivor he knew had DS when leaving him down added pressure.
---
He wasn't a horrible killer, I don't mean to say that at all, but I do not see this video as a good argument in favor of ruin.  Based on the way he was playing, Tinkerer instead of Insidious would have been a much better choice.
---
As someone who has already gotten nancy to p2, I'd say locker heals are...ok.  great when they work, but also highly unreliable.
---
I honestly like fixated the most.  being able to see your own scratch marks is kinda cool, but that 20% walking speed bonus is where it's at.
---
Any killer who has the effort/patience to give a wiggling survivor hatch is actually insane.
---
This. I will NEVER play him unless I have The Ghost and either Clapper for him. 
---
With those, I never need to worry about BT, incase I have to resort to light camping, and I can easily catch people off guard, ESPECIALLY with the Ultra Rare Clapper who's name eludes me right now.
---
They were on a gen. Lunge.
---
Wha- 
---
r/UnexpectedJoJo
---
It’s the worst also playing Trapper at rank reset. You set the best traps at all the loops (I only play him for dailies) and the survivors constantly run into open space.
---
Are we supposed to just read your mind?
---
Eh she's ok so long as you don't go against 4 try hards. Of course the same applies to every killer but Nurse. And MAYBE a good Billy/Spirit
---
Not fun to go against Prayer Beads
---
It’s happening for me too. Survivors keep getting kicked from my team in a lot of games. I’m glad I checked Reddit to see if it was happening to anyone else
---
Get a clapper my friend. And a Ghost
---
Love it. I love hopping back through the window after the killer vaults it or turning a corner, crouching and then going back the other way when they walk right past you. Can’t beat classics.
---
My dumbass got gen grabbed by a Demo the other day. My soul nearly left my body
---
Freddy isn't OP cause a perk doesn't work against him
---
I realize it's just a meme but that's kind of scummy. Even if you're just trying to learn a new killer, you aren't gonna learn much by stomping rank 20s.
---
I don't want BHVR to leave her alone, I want them to buff her but I fear that if I even say the word pig in BHVR's general direction they will remove her dash and replace her beartraps with funny macaroni hats
---
Eh, jake is free
---
Pretty sure you missed the point of his comment. He’s saying that around those ranks(rank 14) killers tend to camp and play very poorly. It’s just  something you have to deal with every now and again when you’re at those ranks.
---
Shadowborn is like a requirement for high level nurses imo
---
Strongheim from jojo
---
The game has never looked great. I'll take playable frames over slightly better looking muddy textures anyday.
---
Pretty much. I do killer sometimes, and I use Ghost Face as he’s one of my favorite killers from movies.
---
I think it's smart to run atleast one anti slug perk honestly
---
Fun to go with Prayer Beads
---
Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. You're an entitled survivor main. If you tried playing killer on the old system, you wouldn't be complaining right now. Took BHVR long enough to enact sensible changes to the Matchmaking system.
---
If you think a rank 15-20 killer going up against 3 red rank survivors and their rank 20 buddy is okay. You need to seriously consider getting professional help.
---
I don’t know tbh
---
I think it’s definitely a respect thing. If you put up a good fight in a chase without being a douchebag and you had potato teammates, chances are a lot of killers will let you live. I don’t wiggle if I get downed as the last alive and accept whatever fate the killer chooses.
---
it was probably a wraith that stood still or a insidious bubba lurking in the basement
---
Im more of a hillbilly but damn does wraith bodyblocking feel satisfying.
---
*cough* spirit *cough*
---
Just don’t wiggle. You’re not going to make a difference when a hook is near. At that point just accept defeat and hope they give you hatch. I always give hatch to survivors who don’t wiggle and I’ve been given hatch by killers when I don’t wiggle either.
---
Coxcombed Clapper.
---
You’re partially right, a rank 11 killer is fine against a rank 13, or a rank 11. But those people aren’t independent. They’re in a group, probably with comms, and wayyyy more coordinated than normal. Plus they have a much more experienced player helping them. The difference between solos and swf is insane, and this nerf to swf groups feels pretty ok. I say all this as a survivor main. Playing with my high ranked brother against easier killers made our 2 person swf feel wayyyy stronger than what the killer was prepared to handle. Our escape rate was insane. 
---
And my first solution was to play with people your rank. That’s a completely fair solution. You can still play with your lower rank friends, but you gotta be prepared to face a greater challenge. If you don’t want that challenge, play solo for a bit. Get better. My main point I was making is that survivors actually have the option of solo queuing or playing with friends while killers don’t. Playing with friends before had barely any downside. Now it potentially does. Killers never have the option of swf or solo, they are always solo.
---
Ok dud gotta say if thats raw doodle youre pretty much amazing at your job, keep it up :D
---
Im out of the loop, what is it with those 69 memes the past couple of days? Did 69 really snitch on somebody in court?
---
I don't think so. I think it's like T-bagging but I could be wrong.
---
Run a speed test and check your down/up speed. You might not have enough bandwidth to deal with hosting a lobby.
---
&gt;Wait for official instructions... HEH wait my ass!
---
What is the point of a PVP game, if one side has no control and no counterplay and just has to hope the spirit doesn't play well (listen well)? You can have a "power role" without also creating a "no power role." Nurse is an example of this even though she is very strong, there is at least some level of counterplay because you can see what she is doing and, better yet, what she is doing wrong.
---
oh yeah i fucking love James!!!
---
It's not op now tho, yes it's still strong but not something you cant deal with
---
Just played my first game as Myers and could’ve had an easy 4K, trapped the last survivor in the corner who put up a good fight all game. She looks at me for about 5 second then teabags, then I escorted her to the gate
---
Was watching streams of the Switch version earlier, framerate was very choppy on Survivor side. Was definitely sub-30. Dunno about Killer.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d8zgjq/are_flashlight_saves_bugged/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
D strike shouldnt work when you already chased down and hooked someone else after the obsession got unhooked. It should really only protect from tunneling and not be a punishment for a fair playing killer.
---
Most of the time survivors would love to farm with you. Communicate to them the best that you can that you want to farm. Sometimes I’ll down a survivor, take them to a gen, drop them, and hit the gen a few times. Then I’ll dribble them to get them back up. Usually they’ll get it, but some just don’t... typically the new and very inexperienced players. Try to send a quick message before the game in lobby and let them know that you want to farm if they agree to it. I’ve made huge huge piles of bloodpoints doing this with survivors.
---
Just slug. Wastes time and pisses them off. Hopefully making mistakes.
---
You're rank 14 dude.  Most of the killers tunnel at that rank anyway regardless of killer selection.
---
Something to do with licensing idk
---
Doing gens =/= gen rushing, fyi
---
Memes aside how fast was she even going like 2% more than intended? I never saw any pigs so it couldn't have been that big of a deal |
---
Or faking the window fake for survs that don't get caught by the window fake
---
The wailing bell was also very nice, when released he didnt have the bell.
---
Rip
---
Welcome to dbd. Wish I can say it gets better, but id be lying.
---
Freddy isn't on switch either
---
People like you are what make the game better!
---
Spirit is one pube hair away from being on the exact same tier as nurse.
---
Idk they could easily get the rights but hey
---
Idk why the mori isn't just activated. Holding a button is so 2010.
---
Eh I can see that
---
If a hook is right next to me I don’t wiggle. (they still hook) if there is no hook in sight I’m going to wiggle. I’m not going to just give up in hopes that a killer will give me hatch. If you’re giving me hatch, make it clear otherwise yeah I’m going to fight until the end.
---
Lol the Steve
---
I wasnt trolling, im serious, in that clip he didnt play well.  
---
Ruin is still necessary because gen times arent perfect, but that doesnt distract from the fact that he handed 3 gens to those people.
---
&gt; Gotta love the hivemind mentality
---
I see big downvote. I must downvote too!
---
Then bring a Mori. No DS.
---
My point exactly, you just said it better, i have a feeling this streamer is idolized by people here? and im going against the grain by saying they didnt play well?
---
Can't close the hatch and then a gate. Js.
---
Usually crouch camp and tunnel like no other.
---
I definitely agree. I want to have some fun with my friends. I'm not saying we should get rank 18 killers, but red rank killers against rank 18 survivors isn't fair either. Its a 4v1 for a reason.
---
I never mori David since picking him up is my only real chance for a hookup with an english hunk.
---
"Hello, lag? Oh, yes I'll hold..." 😂
---
Thanks, all about fun. Still kinda newish (only level 11). After seeing how sweaty and toxic some of the top tier gameplay is I don’t think I ever want to be rank 1.
---
Thank you :))
---
Thanks m8 :D
---
Greaaat another platform for Ochido. 
---
*DUUUUUUUUUUDDD*
---
Agreed
---
Oh god, I cringed so hard to that.
---
What killer was it? Could've been a wraith just chillen.
---
I feel like the Devs once played against a decent Pig and got super unlucky with the RBTs so now they all hate her
---
You won, if you are not going for a save, just leave and be the bigger man, don't be a dick.
---
Cus someone's gonna have an ebony for every game
---
I agree. Now the only killer I fear is T1 Myers. But Spine Chill has great information value if you use it right. Most people move on from it but I find it to be helpful and it's allowed me to finetune my false-positive/false-negative detection.
---
Why do I always face insta heals? Guess its just how the beast is played.
---
Hilarious lol.
---
Did you know you sound like a pedantic asshat?
---
I mean me personally I do give a shit. If I see a killer has a bonus to Hunter offering on and the whole team gen rush, I'll try to play chase with the killer to help them get their points. 
---
Certainly if a killer puts on BPS you'll be damn sure I'm going to engage that killer. It's bonus points for both of us and they brought it to the table. I'm happy to oblige. 
---
I actually spend almost the entire EGC in a game this morning helping a nurse farm her blink-hits. She clearly wasn't a nurse main (presumably doing a daily as it was 30 minutes or so after the reset) and they hadn't hit anyone all game, so I stuck around the gate and let her hit me, then healed, then repeat. It's only because EGC started I didn't stick around and play longer. 
---
I like helping killers. Most things you can do (activate traps, get chased, get hooked) are recoverable from, and we both get points for stuff. 
---
Going back to your earlier point, it basically boils down to you being selfish. You should care because someone has used a rare offering that everyone can benefit from, and you are shutting that down for not only all the survivors, but yourself, for no reason other than to think you did well (even though a 4k rush is a depip for a reason). 
---
The game is about engaging each other, not rushing anything.
---
Obligatory shrine thread comment.
---
Well...there is a law suit
---
The whole problem is that people like you play with your high rank friend and you end up against dog shit killers ruining the experience for new players/low rank players and they come on here swarming this subreddit whining. The killer having a fun experience will be going against survivors that are reasonable for their rank, not mixed ranks with one high rank that can loop tiles optimally without dropping pallets as the killer can’t walk in a circle optimally. Yet your rank 20 friends or whatever can just solo queue to have a fun time or play against harder killers in solo queue. Can’t believe you have the audacity to complain about this. Killer ranks shouldn’t be average they should be equal, so 4 rank 1’s should go against a rank 1 killer. If you wanna handicap yourself by giving yourself communication and having a worse team. Then do it.
---
I'd disagree. I think the single most broken thing survivors have EVER had, was when you could blind or pallet stun a killer at any point of the pick up animation and get the guaranteed save. Literally removed any and all skill with the flashlight because of how massive the window for it was to save people. Pair that with the fact that the flashlight FoV thing I believe was still like 360 degrees and yikes, good luck getting any pick ups.
---
actual instant insta-blinds were a super close 2nd though.
---
A rank 1 against a rank 10 isn’t fair, what don’t you understand. Go against a rank 1 killer and don’t cry that your baby survivors can’t live even though you have communication the biggest advantage
---
Burns your flashlight quickly
---
Happening to me too. Survivors commenting on my profile that i rage quit when i was dominating lol
---
Some of them are cool, others not. 
---
There are camping/tunneling ones, there are dashing/yoinking ones. 
---
Some of them allow you to boop their snoot, some don't.
---
Some of them make Pig looks like F-tier killer, some of them are on A-tier level without tryharding.
---
But again I go on my previous point. Of course there are groups out there that do what you are saying and purposely go out of their way to bully and it's precisely those types that will just derank. If people want to bully, they'll find ways to bully sadly. The only people this change is guaranteed to affect is the genuine low rank survivors maybe just starting out with more experienced friends showing them the ropes. That's how I started. So it's punishing the wrong people. Rank 1 sweaty nurse against a fresh survivor just because they want to play with friends is gonna put a lot of new players off, or even put red rank survivors off playing with new people because they know will 1 new potato on their team they have no chance. 
---
Now I know people will say but what about the killer with the rank 1 swf etc but like I said people that want to bully will derank or smurf account to stay at that rank then. This is one of those solutions that might look good on paper but in practice it's just not. 
---
This change will only be worth it if they punish deranking along side it and I really don't see BHVR doing that because they rarely do anything with reports especially with this scenario because it'll be too hard to prove who is deranking. Hell even some of the biggest Dbd streamers play on smurf accounts or derank to stay are green ranks. They do that shit live and nothing gets done. 
---
I just don't think this is the magic fix people expect and it's going to have a more negative effect because, like I said, the only people guaranteed to definitely be affected are the genuine survivors just wanting to learn the game or the more casual players.
---
No it just gave me the list of players who were in the lobby but nothing else. I just started playing like about 2 weeks ago so maybe I didn’t know where to look? But I did record the last few minutes of the match after we fixed the generators
---
I don’t know if rank really matters but if it does, matchmaking sucks right now..I’m thrown around with so many different ranks..feel bad for the higher ranks I get thrown with lol
---
Power: Long division.
---
This community would be boned.
---
That's your counter right there!! Spine Chill!! :D
---
Clown, doc, LF, legion
---
Well it’s a good thing I didn’t go to the basement then
---
Is there as many dc’s and dying on hook with red ranks as there is lower ranks?
---
Yes because you are the host, your internet gets bad so it disconnects everyone from you, but for them it’s your disconnecting. So it’s definitely your internet, only reason you were “dominating” is probably due to all the lag
---
That's actually a strat if you won't make it to a window of pallet by the time they can hit you, so you just waste as much time as possible running around a truck on auto haven then run to a pallet. It's surprisingly easy to make a chase last longer even if you have nothing nearby to vault or throw.
---
You even spelled it wrong. I am proud of yoy.
---
Not to mention trapper
---
Ehhh I assume not, the odd salty survivor that dc’s or people that just kill themselves straight away.
---
I dont get DC on second hook. Just wait out the 60 secs or stop struggling and collect some BP
---
To be continued....
---
what do you usually run?
---
If it is you'll need to do an in game report AND a support ticket on their support website usually with video proof etc
---
Reposti
---
For me I think that the person I'm doing it for may appreciate it, if not then oh well they'll take my kindness willingly or not
---
Okay so imagine this, you get saved of hook,I hit the saver he goes down, get you in 7 seconds as you can’t get anywhere. Go hook the other guy then you’ve got no DS I’ll just hook you. That’s what a bad design is
---
It's the only perk that has a permanent place at the end of each of my Survivors perk slots. It's just a must, the best heads-up in the game.
---
Release Wraith not withstanding and arguably Depth did a better job than DBD.
---
L4D1 was the closest to balanced in Asymm history IMO. L4D2 was survivor sided due to a mix of the new weapons/ammos for survivors + nerfs to raw damage for killers (Kill charges were rare/limited in availability, Boomer was weaker due to range reduction, Smoker range was nerfed, invis walls and reduced ceilings hurt Hunter DPS, tank was a joke in 2, etc.)
---
Are you kidding?
---
Getting unhooked and promptly hit afterwards, having the killer walk around the surrounding area to take a weak swing at any teammates who swing by for the duration of your D strike, approximately 40 seconds if you ran any distance from the hook, is still fucking tunneling. They put you back on the hook, your team is punished if they attempted to be altruistic, a gen might be partially done if some of them stayed on it.
---
I never called the perk weak, I said the counter play to it is too f-cking easy when they can just stand around for a minute and pretend like it doesn't exist. No other perk lets a killer fully ignore the effects by waiting a few seconds.
---
That they're human beings
---
Self care is never of use. Its a huge amount of time you deal with doing absolutely nothing, and often enough you get hit a few seconds later, and it goes on and on, and no gens pop @all. It happens so often that I play with survivors using self care, healing themselves, and no one gets out because the last gen was nearly done, but not done cause of someone healing instead of doing gens
---
just uploaded a screenshot of my internet speed
---
The only thing I'd change is that it can't activate during the Endgame Collapse.
---
If the doors are open, it's basically a free escape. If you're the last Survivor, you're dead anyway.
---
Done, check it out I edited the post
---
What do you mean?
---
The dehmuhrguhrguhn😋
---
Probably the worst killer in the game and he’s not fun to play against imo but I feel bad for them
---
How is it holding the game hostage? Technically the bleedout bar still goes down during the spamming so it's no different than slugging someone and watching them bleed out.
---
Still a very dick move though.
---
What does it mean when people say that pallets are “unsafe”?
---
I wish my dailies were always killer. Hate playing survivor.
---
I think maybe there should be 4 dailies total, with always having 2 killer and 2 survivor.
---
In game report and submit a ticket on their website. I was banned for this very thing about a year ago on PS4. Learned my lesson and have never mori spammed again lol
---
Endless Descent will be meta on 3-gen doc.
---
Legions are cool, people want to classify him as “low tier” it just depends on who’s behind the controller.
---
It's weird because on my end everything looks the same as pre patch. No graphics changes. (high graphics).
---
I use spine chill cause im not great in a chase so it either lets me hide or gives a me a heads up so I can think about my route
---
Kill all sunsabitches
---
The best legion wont ever reach the tier of billy or nurse. Its high effort decent reward, while nurses be like high effort flawless reward
---
Yeah unbreakable is amazing but very situational.
---
It helped me escape one game.
---
One Thing I hate is:when I’m not running my All-Rounder build I get slugged....
---
Yeah. I'm overly confident with sprint burst.
---
Long queue times. Dbd is niche, and there aren't all that many Switches out there.
---
Same boat, but I realized how much it was holding me back.
---
you right my b
---
Can't we settle on aftercare?
---
Never used it
---
I Play pig a lot, but I never noticed anything.
---
The first game I didn't use spine chill I felt so naked. 
---
Crutch perk for us Blendettes.
---
He is the one
---
I like that, adds some risk to it other than it being broken for survivors, Or make it so the perk makes you obsession and you gain two token.  The chase has to last 15 seconds before the perk activates and when it activates a token is used and all survivors in a certain radius gain increased speed to all actions for like 20 seconds. If the chase ends while the boost is active the boost is lost.
---
He's so hot
---
I had a glitch last night where I could escape and when I ran outside the boundary it made me fall, into the killer shack.
---
Love this. I’d love an aquatic themed killer.
---
I don’t have an opinion. People should play what they enjoy, as long as they’re not cheating or trying to bully people it’s none of my business.
---
1,800 hours doesn’t mean shit. I’m at 3k with over 10k kills.
---
Not really. Being on the hook, last gen gets done it‘s basicly a „get away for free“ card.
---
Trapper Bag just needs to be baseline tbh so players can use different add ons more often
---
I heard that
---
Because it pisses people off, but noone can stop you. I know that when i get tunneled i get angry as fuck but thats mainly because im a bad survivor and cant really run the killer around
---
I’m a simple man. I see tuxedo wraith, I upvote
---
Iron will is a must for me. I need to stay productive no matter what. I don't rely on self care. (Always)
---
 Sprint burst to help me avoid getting tunneled off the hook or to be able to finish gens, and run off at the last second buying me some distance to find a loop. (Always)
---
Urban evasion- if I don't want to run lightweight. I'm not immersive though. I like to rush. 
---
(Normally)
---
Empathy- if I feel I need a spine chill effect. This tells me where the killer is across the whole map. Just by looking at survivors strange behaviors - they appear as if they're looping. 
---
Lightweight- I love this perk, cause I like to run a lot. (Sometimes)
---
He is boring.
---
It's just salt. Tunneling is no bug abuse, cheating or anything. I get why people get mad, you just got off the hook and the killer is on your heels already. If you're playing with friends, you're forced to watch and wait, which can be pretty lame if the game takes long. But trust me, tunneling is just a normal and smart move, since it's your job to take everyone out. There is no rule in game that says you need to at least hit everyone once or something like that, so no worries! Just play the game as you like amd enjoy the salt (means you outsmarted them).
---
I get that, it annoys me too when I play survivor but it just seems like a solid tactical choice but people treat it like cheating
---
Aight its salty survivor time
---
Spine chill is mostly used for stealth killers, on normal killers it is \*kind\* of a waste, but you still get a heads up before you enter terror radius, and if they're looking at you for more than a couple of seconds they're 100% going to your gen. I don't think Spine Chill is to blame for being bad at chases, it's good to have a vision/tracking perk of some kind as survivor because unless you're looking at the killer constantly you won't know where they are sometimes, especially stealthy ones.
---
That's good. Experiment. Spinechill is unnecessary when you can loop. It's nice having extra space.
---
No.
---
Spine Chill is not a perk to avoid chases. It's a perk to scout some handy looping points if you haven't had a chance to do so before starting the gen. Then you need to rely on your own looping skill in case the killer find you, and they usually will.
---
Why do so many people want the work of a real life child rapist represented in game?
---
In my opinion it comes down to earning BPs; survivors don't earn as much as the killer does 9/10 times and by you constantly chasing them, you're severely limiting how much they can earn.
---
As much as I enjoy a good chase with the killer, it's not very fun if they spend all their effort trying to remove somebody from the match because they got hooked first, basically treating it as an old Dying Light
---
I think it was right after the stranger things dlc got announced, aka the time when I had no access to dbd.
---
Yup. I'm having to dashboard 4-5 times before I can even get into a game. Will probably just stop playing until this gets fixed.
---
Really?
---
What ayayayaya bullshit is this
---
Haddonfield is cool just unbalanced af
---
As long as you have good awareness, it's not necessary for stealth killers. Positioning on gens is key. I can spot out stealthy killers by being aware of my surroundings. I run sprint burst, so I always get that distance before they creep on me.
---
1. Get used to the lunge, it is the difference between getting a hit or not once you know the distance, specifically when survivors are about to vault windows.
---
2. If you get looped by a survivor, try to be as close to the “loop” as possible and cut corners, the small distance gap can be a lot on certain loops to get a hit in
---
3. Play as a survivor from time to time. Playing it will let you understand the mindset a survivor, which can make you predict what they will do.
---
Cause a survivor can run up and Insta-heal the downed person before the bar fills and it will cancel the Mori.
---
It’s rare, but it works.
---
Instead of going straight back to the hook the minute someone is unhooked, try pressuring gen instead. Then no DS will proc.
---
Demo
---
How did you get my friends gameplay?!
---
When you're dropping the survivor they were locked in place, meaning that while you were falling, the survivor was floating mid-air until your dropping animation is done
---
Yeah it is a solid choice but if you do it you gotta be prepared for some salty survivors
---
Exactly Trapper addons have so much potential
---
Exhaustion and anti-tunnel perk: BAD
---
Sounds pretty dumb and non sensicle.
---
Same. It's helped me stealth away from killers so many times and it's also a good way to figure out if a killer has barbeque &amp; chili. It's a little suspicious if my spine chill immediately activates after the killer hooks another survivor, lmao.
---
As a Dwight main i approve
---
unbreakable is one of those perks where most of the time it just takes up a perk slot but oh boy when it comes the time where it’s perfect and you escape because of it damn it feels good
---
Do the same meme but instead of "ruin" and "high ranks" say NOED. What a trash perk.
---
I know nOeD gAmErZ will disagree.
---
Technically the opposite, hehe. The numbering for levels in this game is really weird. My husband played the game for the first time recently and said, “I’m already rank 20!” Bless.
---
It’s suicidal, but if you pull it off you’re a champ IMO.
---
60 seconds are not enough time to do much. First you have to get away from the area then either heal yourself or do something.
---
Most killers these days can easily down the rescuer. How is it fair that they also get to down the unhooked survivor immediately?
---
Otz bad? You must be trolling, right, friend? :D
---
If you can't wait for a minute before chasing someone who just got hooked then that's on you for being impatient.
---
All those tips are really helpful but mean fuck all if you've literally just started playing today.
---
It's gonna sound basic but practice and time you will get better. It. Might be worth playing a bit of survivor it'll teach you valuable skills either side.
---
It's a poor strategy that works effectively against potato survivors but loses you games as you rank up.  If you're playing to kill one survivor out of the game you're creating zero pressure on the other 3 who are free to work on gens during.  Also you mentioned there are no in game mechanics to discourage it.  Both Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time would like to have words with you.  Your playstyle has you prepped to constantly walk into both of them routinely.  On top of all of this it is just a very unskillful approach to the game in general.  Basically do it if you feel you can't play any other way but know you'll start losing games playing this way once you get high enough and your opponents know how to loop you long enough to punish tunneling as a strategy.
---
It absolutely is, it's straight up a horror movie and it's a blast.
---
Im not saying whoever the streamer is is bad, im saying *in this clip hes bad.*
---
If you notice, in the pinned comment he lists all his mistakes.
---
typical mindset is that they just want to get into another game faster
---
Fix one thing to only break at least two others.
---
Spaghetti code at it's finest
---
Sex With Freddy
---
I wholeheartedly agree with this.
---
Yea honestly, at this point I don't even care to see of the killer is terrible. It's not worth my time to play against that shit. Same with prayer beads, same with ebonys. Same with haddonfield offerings. Stop playing easy mode, it's not fun for anyone else.
---
Correction: It slows the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT.
---
Also, I take ruin to slow the game down JUST A LITTLE BIT.
---
He was the first killer I ever played ♥️
---
That Freddy needs to fucking chill with his DPI... no wonder he needs NOED, he probably whiffs every other swing.
---
A good claudette is a dead claudette. But props for not being a disgusting blendette.
---
Saves me leveling up horse face now neat thanks!
---
When I played Pig once I chased the unhooker of the previously hooked Dwight with a trap on his head. I proceeded to follow this "code of honor" and go for the unhooker instead of the Dwight. He's busy dealing with the trap anyway. Off he goes. 
---
But this Dwight obviously took this for granted and proceeded to go to the nearest Jigsaw Box which was right next to the pallet where I chased the unhooker. Unhealed. Like I wouldn't dare to touch him. Well, I did. He could have run away and checked the other boxes. Fine by me, but not in my face. 
---
He spammed my Steam profile that I'm a fucking noob and that I needed to delete the game, amongst various more insults in up to 5 entries. It was quite hilarious. Some survivors are so entitled.
---
Yeah, I guess
---
As a rank 20 killers that kept getting high rank survivors, I really like this change to the matchmaking!
---
But I can't really swf with my two low ranking friends anymore since it'll be brutal for them :(
---
I think what people are complaining about is that they are literally unable to kill that one toxic player that keeps teabagging them because of perks like ds. I doubt most people would care about ds if these people wouldn't be toxic
---
But you can use it for so much more. The early warning is nice but you shouldn't run away everytime. You need to know when to commit even if the perk is lighted up. Something you can do is keep on tier 1 so it only alerts you when the killer is really close to you.
---
Aside from the stealth applications you can use it chases even with non stealth killers to know where the killer is looking or if they are stilll after you. You can also know if they have BBQ, Bitter Murmur, Nurse's,etc if they look at you every time the condition to see your aura is met. You can use it to know if the killer is camping or hasn't completely given up on searching a zone, or too know if going for a save or heal is safe.
---
The speed boost can also be nice, i've been saved by it a few times. Probably more than i even realize.
---
So because there are worse people, that makes it okay to be so too so long as you aren't as bad as others?
---
Yeah, that's pretty 'adult' alright.

Your argument is about seeing the game like a match of chess. You are eliminating pieces of your opponent. You have to think logically how you can take out the most valuable or vulnerable one. If you do: Congrats, you're a great logical thinker!  
---
But the thing is, you are not playing with chess pieces in dbd, but with human beings (albeit you can't see their emotions through the screen). Imagine, you're playing catch with some of your friends. You will all get some candy afterwards, but only if you were performing "good" (this is quite an unspecific term, I know). So you decide to go after one of your friends. You got 'em. They are already tired, since you ran after them for a while. But you keep on chasing them. The others are just chilling around, maybe sniffing some flowers. But the one you are chasing is getting caught again and again.  
---
Match is over: You are getting candy, the others are getting candy. And who gets left out? Poor buddy, who only wanted to have fun (and a bit of candy, since candy is tasty af).  
---
There is little to no empathy on either side of this game. This saddens me. Still, I won't complain to killers or survivors. It's not forbidden, how you play. But why play with other people, if you don't see them as such?
---
Just avoid camping the hook and using the perk No one escapes death.
---
Keep playing, and take the L from time to time.

---
This is dumb and you’re obviously a killer main. 
---
But correct me if I’m wrong on that lol. 
---
It’s the same on the reverse side, if I’m a rank 4 playing with my friends (rank 4,8, and 18) my friend gets shit on and doesn’t enjoy the match if we go against killers solely based on my rank, even tho we just like to play together and I’ve played for years, he is new. 
---
It’s the same thing if we go against a rank 20 and I shit on him by looping, he won’t enjoy playing that round.
---
Doing matches by average IS the best way to do it, our average at that point would be green ranks to purple(cause that’s how it used to be most of the time).
---
Making it based on the higher ranks only pleases the killers, it makes it Unfun for the survivor who is low rank.
---
Before you start ranting, telling me my friend should “get good” or “play by themselves” is gonna go in one ear and straight out the other, we just like to play games together and he isn’t invested enough to play by himself, he enjoys playing games with his friends that live all the way across the country now (he’s in military) and only gets on to play together.
---
I would love to give you advice but watching YouTube videos will be much easier to understand because they will give you a visual too. Good luck, and don’t give up eventually you’ll be juking &amp; looping like a pro.
---
or just make a makeupless sid haig in the devil's rejects attire
---
Happy cake day!
---
This game is most fun for me the worse I am ranked. I've had fun with legion. Can really be fun if you can get your deep wound on everyone
---
Holy shit it happened. Decisive strike! It's basically the only top perk I don't yet have! YES
---
Legion ftw
---
Holy shit I didn't even think about doing that. It definitely makes me not get a headache before the first generator pops at least - thank you!
---
Is coulrophobia good?
---
Anyone else get scared of Wraith when you play as Survivor and all you hear are his loud foot steps running over to you when he's invisible?
---
Replace "me" with "boosted ape" and you have a real meme here, sir.
---
Well you didn't write that in the description so I assumed it works until all dull totems are destroyed. Still giving a hex totem a 2nd chance is a bit op especially if another totem is well hidden.
---
The reason it is set as a minute is so that people can actually still play the game instead of hook simulator. 
---
The game has to service 5 players and for 4 players, the time to play can be very short if they keep going back to the hook. No one is going to want to queue as survivors if they to wait up to 5 min or more in the lobby, only to get hooked repeatedly.
---
It's not always about you.
---
Trapper it's such an easy fix allow to carry a minimum amount of traps of at least 6 or even 10 at most.
---
Such a waste of time trying to set loops up.
---
I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong, but the Blood Hunt event bonus won't increase the points you get from BBQ, just the points you earn from the game. BBQ bonus is applied post-game like Blood Hunt is, so you aren't really missing out - but the sooner you get BBQ the better. I run it on all the killers I've leveled up for those delicious blood points!
---
It's not fixed, so dont worry about it. I'm rank 12 killer, all of my matches tonight consisted of red, purple and yellow ranks. I had 2 people total out of like 10 matches where I had another green rank.
---
*Woman, but thank you! :D
---
What a garbage update, fucks the graphics and ranking for matches is still fucked.
---
I don’t think most people understand why people dc when you get face camped. Personally, if I’m getting camped I just wanna move on to the next game instead of wasting my time. So I’ll one hook myself or dc. Simple as that.  It’s not about being toxic or trying to upset the killer. It’s legit just me wanting to actually be able to play the game.
---
*moonwalks on your corpse*
---
Just the unhooked person gets the effect of bt.
---
i played for several hours tonight and matchmaking is definitely still broken😅
---
Selfcare is reliable, but slow.
---
Inner Strength is unreliable, but fast
---
Second Wind is unreliable AND slow.
---
I wouldn't recommend second wind. If you know the totem spots, go Inner Strength to maximize speed. If you don't know them, use selfcare until you do.
---
Spirits not fun to play against, a lot of people play her because she's "fun" and by fun they mean easy add anal beads to it and it's insta 4k.
---
At least nurse takes actual skill to play.
---
there are now 2 separate achievement lists since the stranger things update. not sure why it wasn't consolidated but it is what it is
---
I had no idea Prestige increased your chances of getting rarer items.... Hmm is it worth it? Does the increase feel big? I've just finally got 1 survivor to a point where he has access to decent perks so I would hate to start again.
---
Going to piggyback on some of the comments and mention that in farming games, you can hook everyone twice (usually in rotation) so that you get your BBQ stacks (if you have it) and the survivors get their altruism points. Killing them at the end of the match is optional, but most don't. Some will sacrifice themselves/refuse to leave as a thank you.
---
If people teabag/don't want to farm, just play the game how you would normally if people don't understand or want to be toxic. I wouldn't waste rare/ultra rare addons for events just in case you do end up farming, but that's up to you.
---
Typically the killer sets whether it's a farming game, but sometimes you'll get survivors clearly running to find you/fast vaulting for attention, or sitting there nodding to get their idea across. Lots of survivors also tend to change their name to something with "farm" in it if they're a swf team looking for BP.
---
I just wanted to know if anyone else had this happen.
---
I use self heal coz nobody is there to heal so i hide in corner and do it myself,
---
Teammates: you're a selfish asshole!!
---
I use inner strength to heal by myself  as fast as usual heal and also destroying potential NoEd
---
Teammates: Just Use self heal damn!!
---
I swear there sis no winning with surv mains.
---
I’d say ps4 is way more painful to play on
---
Find your killer first. Device who you Luke and try them out. Understand some killers require perks and add ons and some don't. 
---
Once you have your killer then play, just keep playing. Ignore what survivors tell you to do and do what you feel is the right thing in that match. Use whatever perks and tactics you want, survivors won't give you anything so don't give them anything. 
---
But the best thing you can ever do is ignore survivors that seem to goad you into the chase, this is what they want and they are probably built to keep it going for a long time.
---
Diavolo be like
---
Bond
---
They fuck my trophy list
---
Man they doing greed with keeping survithots as powerroles!
---
Jake be like: bruh
---
Oh great I dont need to upgrade Laurie (again)
---
Survivors do not care if you have fun, so tunnel away, if it helps you to win. 
---
Remember that most survivors expect you to adapt and yet refuse to do so themselves. I get tunneled and.it annoys me, but only because teammates aren't doing their job whilst I'm distracting the killer.
---
Why does everyone think that the concept of a etched smile is reflective of Jeff the Killer.
---
That type of smile mask was ubiquitous even before Jeff the Killer was a concept
---
The same thing with a teenage gang becomes murderers it said to ubiquitous theme that saying it was based from Jeff the Killer is completely ridiculous
---
That's like saying the Hidden Blade was created by Assassin's Creed and anything that uses it is is a wannabe
---
Let us know how it goes
---
[mori denial](https://youtu.be/uWtfB_j3hv8)
---
As I edited with my comment the same thing applies to a killer you cannot interact with a survivor who is on the ground if they are being healed.
---
You cannot interact with a survivor who is on the ground if they are currently being mori
---
If you're going to put down information it's probably more advisable for you to actually test it at yourself rather than going off hearsay
---
The Omen 🤤
---
Wraith is dog shit bro.  Third to last at best.
---
Or in Michigan: "Ope, just gonna sneak right past ya here"
---
Do you mind time clipping that because I am not watching through that entire 19 minutes
---
i might just start taking your advice now when it comes to dealing with toxicity  
---
as far as playing killer goes, i'm not *that* new, i'm like rank 12-14 or so and thanks to rank reset i've been getting a bunch of games where the survivors are just obviously much much better at the game than me. After running them around for a bit and getting teabagged at every loop, flashlight spammed etc i just stop to let them bang out the gens and leave.  
---
Instead they just get in my face, spam emotes and generally just act like dickheads. There's always at least one person in a game who desperately wants you to chase them, and ignoring them makes them absolutely *seethe*
---
the pig:  
---
power: funny macaroni hat
---
* funny macaroni hats are put on *hungry* survivors.
---
* funny macaroni hats automatically feed the survivor mac and cheese when they trigger.
---
* active funny macaroni hats trigger automatically beyond the exit gates, so they get a snack to go.
---
* funny macaroni hats trigger once the "oven" timer dings.
---
* funny macaroni hats' timers start whenever the survivor has run for too long. they have to be hungry by now.
---
* survivors can free themselves from the funny macaroni hat by searching kraft boxes found around the map to find the correct mac to cheese ratio.
---
Sounds like wraith
---
So you’ve tried it yourself? Cause you are also putting information you haven’t tested because you don’t know for sure either. Lol. 
---
Or are you also going off hearsay?
---
I would totally do that but I’m not sure how. If this works sweet but if not it’s a 6 minutes. 
---
[6:06](https://youtu.be/uWtfB_j3hv8)
---
I’m the exact same, barely ever touch him, never play nurse or spirit and rarely play huntress.
---
I've had people run into my face desperately trying to get me to chase them because they're obviously very good, have a flashlight, and chase perks.  
---
When you ignore them to go for the easier targets (who are also doing gens) it makes them unbelievably mad and they'll call you a camping, tunneling whatever after game every single time. It's kinda hilarious.
---
Lol
---
People that are willing to play a weak killer because he's fun
---
Yeah without watching it from the perspective of the save I have no clue what happened.
---
As I said the huntress could have very easily just stopped the mori animation midway
---
As I've said before I have experienced it from both sides
---
Not counting damaging hits or interruptions
---
If one party is in interacting with a player you cannot stop that until that interaction has been prevented.
---
A killer cannot pick up or mori a survivor who is being healed.
---
A survivor heal a survivor who is being moried or pick up ( healing is required to insta)
---
More examples of this would be
---
A killer kick generator if a survivor is working on it
---
A survivor not work on a whilst a killer is kicking it
---
As I said I can test out this later today in kyf and post the results
---
Leader, Prove Thyself, Vigil, Streetwise - walking buff.
---
Try not to tunnel.. In my opinion tunneling is a waste of bloodpoints for every one. It is more usefull for bloodpoints to chase after other survivor. And I think every one wins when every body got decent amount of bloodpoints. I dont care about killing all survivor. I only want my blood points. If I got looped and 0 kills but made 25 to 30k in this round I see this as a win for me (and other survivor when they got much blood points too)
---
Well, seeing as the Internet is living in meme culture right now, it's a fun pastime to pick memes apart.  
---
&gt;"People just make memes for fun and should be allowed to put as much effort in as they want."  
---
True. However, that doesn't mean people aren't allowed to critique memes. The less effort and care put into a meme, the more susceptible it is to criticism. Naturally.
---
DS only makes the killer even more determined to get you. If you play with a group of friends then you have an easier time to counter tunneling. If your friends know how to assist you in situations like that.
---
Interesting idea.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
No idea. I even used Mad Grit + Agi on Pig in the week before this patch and it didn't seem especially fast for me. Although it'd been a while since I used that combo and it worked oddly well that time.
---
&gt;The survivor that wants you to chase them is the survivor you ignore.
---
That's just procrastinating, really. I'm not just playing to win, I also want to improve. I'm not gonna learn anything from the immersed Claudette that's Urban-Evading behind a bunch of rocks.  Once you get to higher ranks there won't be any easy-to-kill friends anyway.
---
It wasn't when I made that comment. Check the time stamps.
---
No one is actively seeking to offend you, 90 percent of the time when someone is tilted and feel the need to dc, it's simply because the other side is playing well
---
I already found the fix on the dbd forums before making this post. calling this a fix is subjective.
---
When the killer carries me to the hook but he walks pasts a locker with head on dwight in it
---
IGHT IMMA HEAD ON
---
I see, makes sense then! Whenever I play killer it’s usually less than 5 minutes but rarely it’s a bit more. Hopefully they fix all queues cause since yesterday it’s horrible
---
&gt;gurgly lad
---
That is the best description ever
---
So the survivors get to dictate who the killer targets by throwing themselves in front of him? How ridiculous lol, that's like the killer being able to pick which gens survivors do
---
Not that I advocate them, but smurfs won't get you banned. Plenty of killer streamers have used them after patches that caused insane killer queues.
---
See this exactly what I’m thinking. When all players are babies it’s killer favored, even if it’s swf. But when it’s swf and higher ranks it is so hard to play killer. And then you put the shitload of survivor perks like borrowed time, dead hard, self care, decisive strike, and many other, and it’s just basically a cake walk for the survivors unless they make mistakes. And that’s not even taking the map/killer/items that are in effect
---
That’s not how ranking works. Idk if you can read but a rank 1 going against a rank 10 is not fair.  That’s what you’re not understanding. I play both sides killer and survivor and I’m sure you do too. So you’ll know that average ranks aren’t fair if it worked that way as 1 survivor could carry a team no problem. If you don’t like it de rank to get worse killers, why are you so entitled that you think you should ruin the fun for new killers just because your friend  can’t be asked to play.
---
I was unaware that characters were missing on the Switch version. With that being the case it's probably a matter of BHVR needing to renegotiate those contracts in order to have those licensed characters on the Switch version. I'd imagine that they will come to the Switch version eventually, but as DLCs you will need to purchase. As for their perks I would hope they'd make them universal like they did with Bill's perks, but I honestly couldn't tell you if they are or not.
---
If they have no intent of doing it straight away it’s trolling if they spam it. Why are you even arguing we’ve been over it already.
---
It was about a month ago, a week after Ruin.
---
same dude that said "aint nobody at age 18 done what i did" or some shit right? yeah, wannabe gangster, how many bullets the kid taken?
---
He was my first too. Also the first I got to level 50 with how much I played him. I love my Bing Bong Boy
---
Every other killer moves at 3.68 (Or 92% move speed). Pig was on 3.85 (Or 96.25%), which makes her carrying speed the same as Nurse's regular walking speed.
---
It basically guaranteed she could get to a hook no matter what (and even opt to go for a further hook if it's in a better place) and made it considerably harder to bodyblock.
---
If you throw in agitation, a regular killer is at 4.34 (Or 108.5%), whereas agitation on Pig gave her 4.54 (113.5%), which makes her faster than Huntress, Hag, and Spirit (And Nurse, of course), and almost regular killer movement speed.
---
Thats me
---
You might have a point there. But you can easily get 5 tokens with 3 gens left which can make a real diference.
---
Wraith is still the best change my mind
---
Maybe bone clapper + “the ghost” - soot add-ons is what they mean
---
I love how you're getting down voted for a simple, straightforward three word comment that speaks the truth. This sub is hilarious.
---
De ranking isn’t bannable, what are you smoking?
---
I’m rank 3 and I’ve been shit on by rank 13 so idgaf what you say about them “not being able to win”. 
---
And that solution you just said, that is the most idiotic thing I’ve ever heard “just derank to get worse killers”  (insert spongebob meme) 
---
If I derank to 17 and play with my friend I still play like a rank 3 so I’d still shit on any killer I face. 
---
SO DERANKING MAKES NO FUCKING DIFFERENCE ITS A DUMB SOLUTION. 
---
It’s no different than just making the ranking system go by average instead of pleasing the cry baby killers.
---
You sir, are a moron.
---
I can’t really tell you what the point is really. Just for fun I guess. It’s not like I put a lot of thought in it or anything, just sometimes feel like doing it so I do is all.
---
 It’s not fair through going against a weak killer, stops new players from playing the game
---
Tunnelling and camping at high ranks = easy gen rush.
---
Survivors that complain about it are just noobs.
---
I like discordance because it gives me a lot of Gen grabs lol
---
Closer to 1 = better
---
yeah I know that’s why I said I get it, just sucks that’s my friends don’t want to play swf with me anymore
---
Well, then she would deserve it. Thing is, she doesn’t
---
How did you do this? I wanna practice maps in a custom game like yours, can I do that?
---
That guy is just a troll, de-ranking isn’t the solution.
---
If you de-rank you are just being a dick to the lower rank killers, and it’s no different than being matched with them as a red rank in the first place.
---
Well iam good with legion on low ranks. 4-7 They slow down the game j u s t   a  l i  t t l e  b i t. And stops healing
---
Well sorry, I have a life and a solid workload, can't spend as much time as I would want to on my computer. I don't deny your playtime. But don't talk to me like I'm a newbie when I'm not.
---
Only if Shaggy can be the new survivor, I'd pay good money for that.
---
How is demogorgon a stealth killer? The thing I love about him is how loud he is. The stomping on the ground and the beastly screams in the distance as he is hunting other survivors.
---
Not a problem, just hit they guy who unhooks.
---
Im the sam rank in killer and sutvivor rank, then why does it takes 5 seconds to find 5 people of my rank when playing as survivor, but 5-8 minutes while playing as a killer
---
&gt; In future games you should avoid playing against your friends, even if you have good intent and are playing fair
---
It's not playing fair. Playing fair would be trying your best to get 4 sacrifices.
---
In my opinion, that’s just shitty, but yeah that is teaming. It is bannable, and I would definitely report you for it honestly.
---
Cause spine chill actually used to be pretty great. Now it's just kinda trash unless you're an immersed survivor
---
There isn’t a way around it and I doubt they’ll change it back at all so I guess I’ll just have to suck it up and find some new people to play with tbh
---
Your friend needs to dodge lobbies until you see him/her in yours.
---
What are you asking for, what specs to run it well or how to get dbd
---
It's definitely intentional, but if people hate it so much I'd trade it for full movement speed and lunge after teleport.
---
OP said that they did try their hardest and told their friends to not go easy on them.
---
&gt;~~He breathes~~ snarls like a pug louder than Nurse, Shape, and Clown combined
---
Before matchmaking I was waiting 20 minutes for killer not it’s 30 seconds
---
Please tell me you're not suggesting that 1 second of no terror radius Demo gets after teleporting makes him a stealth killer.
---
We squaded up then waiting, threw me in a game while he was still in the menu
---
*Angry oink*
---
BHVR should definitely listen to enlightened individuals such as yourself on how to best balance the game. SWF is inherently unbalanced to begin with, you wanna choose to play with people at a much lower rank? Then you burden the unbalance, not the killer.
---
I for one am just greatful that baby killers will no longer be bullied by Smurfing SWF.
---
&gt; I play respectably and once all the people I don’t know are dead I’ll let 1 or 2 friends live 
---
That's what OP said.
---
Because there is a surplus of killers you instantly find a lobby and it tries to fill up a lobby so once one survivor join your more likely to get the rest but there is not enough survivors so let's say originally for every 8 survivors there was 1 killer now it's more like for every 2 survivors there is 1 killer
---
[deleted]
---
You can check the specs here: https://www.systemrequirementslab.com/cyri/requirements/dead-by-daylight/13375
---
Wait so vaulting is faster?
---
I personally let the last one live if he had bad luck (Bad teammates, ragequitting teammates) or if he is not toxic in anyway.
---
This is why I stopped playing multiplayer games as often as I used to do,I'm bored of people poking your main and look like they're trying to annoy you as much as they can instead of winning (players)/trying to update the game (devs)
---
Wait...
---
...
---
DEMOGORGON IS A STEALTH KILLER?
---
Yes!! It can restore you to full healty at the end of a match, meaning you can focus on the final gen instead of healing... Unless you NEED to heal.
---
Or it can just pick you off the ground if a killer slugged you.
---
Also, if you are on a hook or being carried by a killer it will activate once you are back on the ground. Which is SO useful for getting a getaway from a camper/tunneler.
---
Adrenaline has saved my ass more times than I can count.
---
Low ranks? You'd most likely get hard camped. But tunnelling is usually an extension of camping or proxy camping. So if you get camped and a brave survivor save you with BT, you'd likely still get tunnelled by the killer.
---
Youre saying that like youre playing against a spirit every game.. You guys gotta die at some point you know
---
You really sound like an angry person. Holy shit maybe learn some conversation skills if you want to prove a point.
---
You're implying BHVR actually plays the game?
---
Reminds of life.
---
You mean rip tunnellers. DS is easy to counter now man.
---
The only complaints I've seen are the usual killers whining about SWF :/
---
Loving it myself but our expectations were probably different. I've played it on pc with a 1080 gtx (so it didn't lag etc) and I prefer it on the switch. I expected the switch launch to be buggy and poor FPS. It's turned out much better than I was expecting. Sell it if you want or wait. It will improve over time but I guess depends if you want to wait.
---
I'm, by the way, absolutely digging the new models. They look so weird when standing next to the other survivors though because the style and quality is vastly different
---
So why did you get downvoted? Do people like camping now or what
---
What did he say?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that's how Destiny was "balanced".
---
You are basically letting your friends rank up for free. gg plz get banned
---
I'll start running both, hopefully It'll keep me off  hook long enough to get something done
---
Yay, I was waiting for Decisive strike, now I need deliverance to show up
---
You forgot freddy (sad freddy main noises)
---
4man can only escape after all 5 gens finished. So you pretty much lost already, since you rarely can get 4 kills after all gens were powered.
---
Cries in pig
---
They can kill themselves on the hook at least
---
If you got to a characters page and hit “more info” it will show
---
&gt;I have a pretty bog standard mid-range computer and I get 120fps
---
XDDDD WOW! The kiddie is playing on low settings to feed his 144hz monitor, epic. Lemme tell you bud, the game runs like ass on every setting. Low might get rid of the horrible lag around certain areas and just run the game better overall, but it's gonna look like dog shit. It's not even the graphics itself, the graphics itself barely change to be honest, but texture detail and shadows are fucking horrible on low. I couldn't give less of a fuck about the ambient occlusion on high/ultra, but I value half decent shadows. That wouldn't be a problem if we had an actual graphics menu or could still mix and match settings in the cfg file, but we can't. If you get 120fps on your "midrange" PC you're either on a 1080+ lmao and still play on high/ultra or you're on something worse but you have everything on low. If you play games on low don't comment on whether they run good or not, because DbD doesn't run well.
---
Feel free to show me gameplay of the Prenn Asylum on ultra though, lol. Wanna see how you can keep 120fps on ultra with your voodoo fx2.
---
At one point low was using around 25-30%, nowadays lows runs with around 40% usage. After the Legion update last December performance for even that setting got worse by like 40%. Game always ran like shit, always will. Look up benchmarks from 2016 to 2019.
---
All you have to do is pick up a trap and if you see some loop spots with grass around it then place it in that or right outside the pallet so even when they throw it down it'll still be useful
---
My hero, thanks for this.
---
Np
---
Awesome! Thanks for the reply.
---
I thought the power was “detention”
---
So you think it'd be better for you to basically bully lower rank killers by being so good at loops/jukes etc?
---
While sure I also get your point, there are people who go in with 2-3 red ranks and like 1-2 rank 20s to bully lower rank killers. Which forces less people to play Killer. While you won't be able to say with your friends, they can easily just play the game, get better and rank up themselves.
---
You do not need them to play.
---
They do not need you to play.
---
Run both, use self heal outside the locker, then jump in the locker to heal
---
I actually most times LOVE playing Wraith, just for old fun, I don't have any real good perks for him so I enjoy playing hard and when I get a 4k with Wraith I happy
---
It is a team game though, and by leaving the game early, you're screwing them over.
---
I guess it depends where you wanna draw the line between enjoyment and teamwork.
---
I once had all four in the basement because of that.
---
One of them yeeted themselves off the hook and managed to unhook two, one of whom got stuck in a trap on the stairs, the second vaulted the window and hit a trap and the third one ran out the door and hugged the wall which had a trap in the grass.
---
Oh I already have t3 decisive for dk that's great then

I was going to say that this reply is clearly underrated but its only been up for 20 mins as of me writing this. So i decided instead to reply, letting you know that i like your comment. (Is it still “instead” if i actually mentioned that i thought it was underrated or would it be “also”. Im thinking about this way too hard. Nice reply man!)
---
Thanks to rankreset happening every month a lot of the low rank players have been a red /purple rank previously. A bad killer will get looped somewhat at every rank.
---
That awareness this like literally none.
---
What I hate is when you come back to the hook after they have been unhooked, and you go for the injured one instead of the fully healed one. People must realize that’s not tunneling. Why would I want to go for someone healed when your already injured? I also hate when a killer vamps and everyone is just sitting around me not doing a single gen. I just want them to let the killer waist his time.
---
Spring, then summer, now end of year?
---
Agitation?
---
those hatchets were me yesterday.
---
missing the broad side of a barn like a fucking jackass.
---
Thing is it's the only way to baggage the game against set end of. You go in as a team of four you gain the effects of most perks that give vision on the killer. 
---
Sorry but not sorry, they people I play with are higher rank than me and yet you won't find me complaining, it is what it is. 
---
If you played killer and have gone up against an swf you'll know how much harder it is and how unbalanced it is. 
---
How about you teach your friends how do play and let them either reach your team or just deal with it.
---
He defo used his big dick energy.
---
Less than 1 sec to open hatch and jump in makes sense...
---
Oh. I was thinking Happy Death Day for some reason cause it looked like a baby face.
---
Oof
---
I think there is a Claudette hiding
---
Check out the unlimited speed glitch I had (Uploaded on here) it was nuts
---
I feel the same but with Trapper, something about his bear traps is just very relaxing.
---
I really, really love your style! Do you have an art blog or something?
---
Think about all the new players that won’t play killer or will quit due to the face that they are getting bull shit match ups.  You’re just entitled like you think it’s okay for the killer to go up against rank 1 survivor who has god knows how many hours, makes them want to quit. But soon as you’re swf buddies have to go against a good killer with knowledge and hours on their side it’s not okay. The other survivors who are low can solo queue whereas the killer has no choice but to put up with the previous bull shit of unfair matchmaking
---
Exactly what I meant to say, wasn't sure how to put it
---
“Excuse me miss, what’s something you have never done?”
---
“I have never **put aside my frustrations with toxic survivors and just enjoyed the game.**”
---
“... nice try, but I fear you never will.”
---
This video is great, also recommend literally any video by PainReliever who does similar content
---
NoED should be used early on in your career if only to allow you to get BP from extra sacrifices and such.
---
If NoED is still activating in a Post-Nancy DBD, you guys aren't even trying to prevent it at all.
---
Depends on who's camping. The chainsaw brothers? It'd likely end with you being on the hook instead.
---
Other killers? If you have borrowed time, you can try, especially if other survivors can bait the killer to hit them so you can then unhook the person. See, once the killer hit someone, there's a brief period where they can't do anything. With the right team, you can mindgame them to hit first so you'll have few seconds to unhook the guy.
---
But in general, unless you have the right perks, just try to complete the gen ASAP. Some killers panic if they hear gen pops and may leave the camped target. But don't be too callous either. Use your judgement and look at the situation at hand.
---
To have original music from licensed killers like Myers Halloween sound track would be amazing but licensing reasons. As the movie owners or whatever can’t use the rights to the music used.
---
I think Ghostface's power is more interactive, on LF all you really do is get up close and chainsaw. Ghostface also has a lot of troll potential with the stealth aspect, which you should be familiar with on Myers.
---
They shouldn't have changed to this system, but the other one was horrendous too. It's not fair to a rank 18 killer get 3 red ranks just because one of the 4 survivors are a rank 18 survivor. They should just do the average of the 4 survivor ranks and then find a killer who is equal to the average (for example 2 Rank 1 and 2 rank 15 will get a killer in purple ranks). 
---
And don't dare to say nobody complained because that's one of the main factors for people not wanting to be a killer main.
---
I literally forgot to mention the best part about my rework idea and that was the idea that feral rage should be earned like tier 3 michael
---
I’ve found green ranks to be a sweet spot for killers/survivors. Not too bad, not too good.
---
If you have a mix of friends + randoms in your lobby you need to try and kill them all, let them all live, or dodge. Otherwise yeah it could probably get you in trouble.

Added status effect :FUCK YOUU!!,

FUCK YOUU!! grants the ability to fuck one survivor over and lead them to impending doom.
---
Which rank would you say it becomes more effective to pressure generators? Have gotten to rank 8 and am yet to experience this, but will keep this in mind.
---
Yeah I forgot to mention at the time (Cuz I was tired) that I want feral rage to be earned. Basically once Legion gets a certain number of hits (12 or so hits) he can go into Feral Rage. Without that it is undeniably overpowered lmao.
---
Doctor is an amazing killer, it's just that his skill floor is a lot higher than other Killers.
---
By the time you become a good Doctor, you could have become an amazing Nurse or Spirit.
---
That's the only bug I have experienced so far.
---
I jave read that somebody lost his progress due to putting their switch into sleep mode without closing the game.
---
Read my reply above to another thread, there was a detail I forgot to mention while I was tired :P
---
Ok ill try that
---
When spine chill has been active for more than 2 seconds
---
Me: ight imma head out
---
Not saying it should be removed, but SWF does break the game. Some killers literally have their power denied because of 4man swf who know what they are doing (Trapper/GhostFace/Hag). And the problem with the older system is that a rank 18 simply has no chance of winning against a team of 3 red ranks and 1 grey rank. This new system is trash too.
---
Nope, I believe that a portion of people read it I just automatically assume that I just need to get better at the game. Which yeah I do have to get better at killer, but that doesn’t mean anything cause there’s still the same limits for killer as everyone else
---
back when you had to do gens to get the door so ya had to do what ya had to do to stay alive eeeekkkk
---
Better than the opposite, which is new/inexperienced killers playing against red ranks.
---
Better to saddle experienced players with easy games than to scare off new players with unfair ones.
---
This should actually improve queue times at rank 1, since the all the Red ranks trying to get a match against Yellow ranks will be forced to deal with other Red rank players.
---
As for the second issue, I'm not sure Red rank killers are going to be so keen on fast matches - why rush a game and risk not even getting a safety pip?
---
Ikr, every time
---
Naw that's African, my boy.
---
Also I noticed that if you change the controls to your preference, when you re-enter the game it returns to the original controls.
---
I didn’t say “no one complained” I asked if they had and said I hadn’t seen anyone complaining, I play killer and survivor and it seemed fine before and I’m quite bad at killer I’m currently a rank 17 killer and I used to always kill 3-4 survivors every time.
---
Fucker
---
*cries in Nea*
---
my OCD is going wild!   sort that guy out by the wall!
---
&gt; then that’s no different than letting random people win
---
But there is a difference. If everyone is on death hook, OP's friends are safe, others are being essentially tunneled.
---
She made the traps unescapable. They should make that an add on.
---
Go Laurie yesterday to 40 .. two weeks the same with head on, two weeks before that it was ruin and also new..  that's crazy bullshit.. the game is ..
---
I like to put No Mither with these to complete the, "Help, I've fallen, but I can get up." Set.
---
Also thanks for being respectable, a lot of people come on here being salty and trying to troll so I appreciate it.
---
Where's your power?
---
Its not that big a deal. Cmon.
---
Yes, but you have to understand that playing with friends is optional. If they play by themself the game works just fine. Swf has always had the edge over killers and this change evens it out a bit. I am playing both at high rank so this is comming from my experience at least.
---
NEAO
---
\*laughter\*
---
ABOUT DAMN TIME!
---
Tunneling is a myth that only rarely exists. If you are the only one getting chased, then you are being tunneled. Any other case, nah.
---
&gt; I don't know what is so hard to do the average of the ranks and boom there you go
---
2 ranks 20 + 2 rank 1 in swf means they'll face rank 10 killer (average of ranks)
---
Tip: OoO survivors want you to tunnel them.
---
Thanks, in case anyone's wondering this shouldn't be bannable. The .ini's store your settings stuff like resolution and graphics options. You're just toggling options that are invisible in the game itself.
---
It sounds like much (5$ for one character), but that's like 2/3 beers in a pub. Gaming is a really cheap hobby really.
---
I was wondering why I felt like I wasn't progressing in ranks, even on matches where I would double pip.
---
They’re supposed to be on regular bloodwebs. I’m 30 bloodwebs deep and haven’t seen any of them yet, just keep getting level 3 of basic perks lol.
---
I'm just over react, don't worry haha
---
If you have medkits, i would bring one but Inner Strength(if you know totems), self care(if you don’t) and Second Wind(in an altruism build).
---
Yes
---
I tried. Not very fun though.
---
Hope the Switch version is better as I don't have to put my hand on the screen.
---
It could be like how borrowed time was on console before bill was added. It might just show up in bloodwebs as a basic perk
---
*This man is Mythical he is truly one to be feared*
---
I'd say inner strength.
---
Unlike self care it heals you at a normal rate and incentivies and rewards the cleansing of totems.
---
Also just bring a toolbox and resilience.
---
&gt;!This is a message from the gen jockey gang!&lt;
---
I realise this is a poor turn of events as far as your personal group is concerned, but:
---
&gt; They're going to get really frustrated and turned off from the game if they're constantly matched with purple ranks that they realistically shouldn't be going against.
---
There's no way that you don't realise that this is *exactly* the problem that low rank killers have been having.
---
Wow I totally read over that part, thats 100% bannable.
---
Well its more fair than the old and the new system. Don't forget that the 2 rank 20 are people too who want to have fun.
---
"Tunneling is when the killer focuses one survivor. After unhooks, after hitting someone." That said, you saying he was tunneling is a Lie cause you said ANYONE he downs. Now that we got that out the way, whats your deffinition on camping?
---
It gives you 15% faster speed for everything including vaults so if you run that with resilience you will never get hit through a window when injured :)
---
What does p3 means?
---
so instead of fixing the matchmaking, they make it shitty to play with friends?
---
Unfortunately "The way it was" meant low rank killers getting matched against high rank survivors, so long as the high rank survivors had a token lowbie - it wasn't "in the middle".
---
As you probably know, killers are not rewarded for short games. When they start losing pips they'll either slide back into Purple (and outside of your matchmaking pool), or they'll learn to judge the pace of a game (like any good Dungeonmaster) so that they're at least getting a safety pip.
---
Lobbies are so Fing laggy. I close app and reopen 10 times a day. Fix please!
---
I just think the stealth killers need to be immune to it under certaincircumstances.
---
Ehh, usually better than nothing, and they get BP for opening the gates
---
Matchmaking as killer is very long because it needs 4 survivors for 1 killer to find a match.
---
At the moment there are probably even as many killers as survivors in matchmaking which results in very fast matchmaking times for survivors and terribly long ones for killers.
---
It was bad before update but with the new matchmaking change it's way worse as many survivors stopped to play swf and just don't play at all or now search as killer as well making it worse. 
---
For real, it's one of the worst matchmaking changes ever and I say that as a killer main, I just don't know how other killers can be happy with it, now we just never got to play and when we find a match it will always be a tryhard toxic match.
---
I just wish they go back to old matchmaking.
---
New killer: Robot mr krabs 
---
New survivor: David Hasselhoff
---
Yes it only seemed to happen on a couple of the maps I think, but wow it doesn't half get annoying.
---
Doesn't increase vaulting speed anymore, neither does resilience
---
Prestige 3
---
They definitely do lol u
---
You have to be injured and in a chase ggs bro
---
Not on anyone's side here. But a D/C is a direct fuck you statement to the killer. Not in terms of effect - but it is a statement to say, "you are the reason I am leaving".
---
On the other hand - a survivor who just tries 3 times and kills themselves looks like an impatient nooblet who is pissed off that his team hasn't  come to save him already.
---
Not that this has any bearing on anything other than perception...
---
Anyone know if motion controls are enabled for this? Could see that being a right amazing thing for Huntress...
---
This \^  
---
Always go for the healthy person because normally if they've just unhooked they're in an unsafe position so you get 1 free hit on them and can easily down them after that. Also having another survivor injured either just forces less gen progress because they're healing or makes them WAY easier to track. I would even say that 2 injured survivors might be better than 1 hooked 1 healthy survivor unless you're playing Billy/LF but if you're playing Billy them being injured means nothing to you in terms of whos the better option to chase anyways so might as well go for the healthy one
---
Either be a team player or don’t play
---
[Had to be done quick](https://imgur.com/a/2gEXbuc)

Would you not consider that your friend's experience is a near mirror for what a low ranked killer had to deal with when they tried to chase a red rank survivor without the perks, add-ons, or experience to either secure the hook or to realise that they would never catch them?
---
Your friend at least has the benefit of you looking out for them, both ingame and in terms of moral support - but a low ranked killer has no such "safety net". All they would know is that they got rolled without understanding why.
---
XDDDDDDDDDDDDD 144fps at 1440p AND ultra
---
Okay bud, feel free to install MSI Afterburner and show me how you're running it. I know how the game runs on a midrange build, oh also just FYI a PC that runs games at 1440p and 144hz is NOT a midrange build lol nor can you get that for $700. Unless you exclusively play eshits games like CS:GO or LoL you won't see even 100fps at 1440p high/ultra on most current games.
---
Again feel free to list actual specs and show some gameplay at ultra lol.
---
DS and Unbreakable. Congrats you get unhooked and you’re immune to death, go do a gen or walk out the gates.
---
Same as Technoblade
---
It was on the shrine fairly recently.
---
That sounds really cool if it works, but I feel like the totem is gonna get destroyed before it works most of the time

Yeah, but her son is still a pedophile and a snitch.
---
GOD
---
locker heals with head-on can be great.. if you dont have the time to heal.. stun and run :)
---
There are like 4 anti slugging perks, two of them are good and one is Unbreakable. If you are getting slugged just run Unbreakable and if the killer is hovering around you while slugged, they’re actually wasting time and your team should be getting gens. Try running DS and tenacity and see how much the killer slugs you after unhooking when you’re on the other side of the map.
---
Idk, I came back to dbd like 2 weeks ago
---
They changed these back some time in February
---
The new system isn't perfect but still more fair than the old one. RIP to the swf teams with three red ranks + one smurf account
---
all the camping stuff could be easily fixed: kindred should be on all the time. An SWF don't get more information out of it, but a solo player would and could punish the stupid campers. Even then, pressing m1 is just boring, if i have 2-3 games in a row when i only do gens i just close dbd and play another game. The have to do something about camping, but they never will.
---
If you look at tier 3 resilience it says 9% faster vault speed and spine chill doesnt say it but definitely affects it but you do you
---
Paired with the other locker perks.. it's actually not that bad
---
Inner Strength + Quick &amp; Quiet + Head On + Decisive
---
If you manage to locker juke a killer, you can get your stun. Best case scenario, you get a full heal AND stun.
---
Also, the DS + Head On combo is the best thing ever
---
NOOO
---
i know. but how cant you see how thats fucked up? without me they wouldnt have bought the game and thus i secured money for BHVR they otherwise wouldnt have gotten. so if i indirectly give BHVR more money, why are they ruining my ability to play with friends?
---
&gt; No other perk lets a killer fully ignore the effects by waiting a few seconds. 
---
Dead hard, Borrowed time.
---
I forgot the /s
---
adrenaline
---
&gt; Regardless of what the killer should be doing different, they need to learn against their own rank and then rank up or derank themselves, you accelerating or decelerating the process is not good for all parties involved.
---
i agree. but why shouldnt this be the same for survivors?
---
Best perk next to Self Care
---
I actually would totally see a doll-robot-droid killer in the game.
---
Turns out they did take it out but patched it back in
---
Pretty sure it counts if anyone completes the required gen
---
its like billies. situationally better to break with shred
---
Ahahahah how cute
---
Never heard such a good comparison before.
---
You know just to prove a point, here:
---
https://youtu.be/JZlg6r-trdE
---
That was a year ago, when the game in fact ran better and while yeah.. a 1080 ti isn't QUITE mid range, but you could get it for around $450 nowadays and fit inside a $700 machine (who'd do that). Aside from him barely getting 110 fps at max settings, that was a year ago. A year ago the game ran like 20% or so better. I remember sitting at like 85% usage on my 1060, got slightly worse around Halloween and then with the Legion update that also brought us UE 4.20 and shitty vol. lighting performance got even fucking worse. Since then they've adjusted it SLIGHTLY again, but it's still a train wreck for the most part and can't compare to the video in question. So unless you're delusional or don't know how to read a frame rate counter, you're wrong.
---
Makes sense since in the movies her games were literally unbeatable and all her victims had 0% chance of survival
---
I don’t get when people say this, as I’m probably not as “good” at the game, but being healed is more then needing 2 hits to get downed. 
---
You make less noise and you leave less of a trail behind, both things I use to my advantage to sneak past a killer to save another survivor, while when I’m hurt they can hear you. 
---
And I also think when people talk about self care they talk about it for those kind of players who use it wrong. I don’t run of the the farthest corner of the map to self heal, I go to a gen, hoping someone is there so they can heal me (or use bond if I have it to go to a close by survivor), and if no one is there hid around the corner self healing so I can do a gen asap as I’m 2 seconds away from a gen.
---
Flipflop gets me every fucking time
---
Not a pedophile, and who cares? His entire gang wanted him dead and strung him along in their RICO case. Anybody else would do the same thing
---
I would most likely go cry in the corner after this.
---
Its apparently something to do with fps and/or vsync. I'll check for some solutions later I just didnt care enough because most of the time I loop anyway. The 10 minute thing is usually because new to reddit, new to sub, or not enough karma, idk if any of those apply to you.
---
still feels dirty tunneling someone just because another survivor unhooked them when I was two feet away. If I catch up to them almost immediately I slug them just to at least give them a chance.
---
The smug face on the perk icon is so good
---
I imagine that it'd be good on Legion with Sloppy Butcher, Distressing, and Nurse's Calling since it'd slow their healing to a crawl and you can find them when they try to, but otherwise it's kinda meh.
---
Force the god pallet out ASAP, then use red-stain mindgames to bait a window vault.
---
Overall, it's the strongest spot on any map, and has needed a change for ages.
---
Once you buy a teachable, they start to show up on other character's blood web
---
now I cant ruin a new killers experience. instead I have to ruin the experience of 3 new players. how is this fair?
---
That happened to me too
---
Does it slow the bleedout bar down? In footage I've seen of people doing it the bleedout bar still seems to deplete during the mori. It doesn't seem to freeze mid animation and I once saw someone bleedout mid-mori. If it's not slowing or stopping bleedout it takes the same exact amount of time as if the killer stood above the slugged survivor and watched. The game state still progresses as the survivor bleeds out. He's not forced to pull the plug.
---
you're missing my entire point. i have never once said the previous system was good. this entire post is about how matchmaking was bad and now they have worsened it. im complaing about how they refuse to fix matchmaking; im not complaining about previous matchmaking being better.
---
https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCDO__Z-tZD4bfG9m4AkK_uA
---
Not Otzdarva is a good trapper main and kinda teaches him to you as he plays.
---
Under your argument does slugging someone during endgame collapse so they wait out the timer count as holding the game hostage? Game state is still progressing.
---
Why? It might take 2m BP or more to get it.
---
Wraith is to OP IMO. Doing gens 2 feet from hooks and then he bing bongs beside you.. plus infinite invisibility? I think there should be a cool down or recharge for invisibility plus his terror radius should be 10-15 meters more while invisible. Anyone else agree or am I a noob😂
---
Oh and before someone says something, These points work for both sides and vice versa.
---
It shouldve said i dont use NOED but lets face it if a killer doeant have noed theyre most likely gonna have at least 1 escape
---
Next stop teabaggin just leave before the killer dc
---
No but there is a difference between slugging someone and spamming a mori, mori spam you can’t move or recover, and it lengthens the game out. Plus you have the intent to troll the survivor and waste time.
---
The thing is this new swf match making doenst work. Yesterday I played with my two newer friends who were both rank 11 and we got placed with rank &lt;16s only.  Im rank 4

He deserved it, camped hooks all game and still didnt kill any of us.

Does aggressively making tea make it taste better?
---
Teachable perks become available at levels 30, 35 &amp; 40. Once you unlock them in the bloodweb they become available for all your survivors/killers.
---
When you purchase in the shrine it’s just an easy way to unlock it without having to push out a ton of BP for a survivor/killer that you either A) don’t have or B) don’t use. But you end up spending Iridescent shards which is something you get when leveling up and can be used to buy killers/survivors.
---
That’s your internet, when a killer dc’s it goes to post game lobby. Unless it’s different on console.
---
She probably had the add-on where you can't see the jigsaw boxes through walls
---
Thats acutally perfect
---
How is demogorgon a stealth killer?
---
People don’t mori though, they use BO builds to grind and get sacrifices instead having a low bp game
---
As I've stated several times now, you don't HAVE to. Just don't play with them and YOU won't ruin their experience. You have the choice, a newbie killer doesn't.

Well, there's your first problem. Use a headset. Not every spirit is gonna play with ultra rare addons.
---
Eh, red ranks joining their yellow rank friends and trying to bully and be toxic to the killer deserve to have their BS trampled.
---
I always thought of them as a bootleg "Strangers" killer.
---
Look up Strangers prey at night if you want a reference.
---
Ghostface. The teabagging is so funny it renders all complaints null and void.
---
Clearly they are having fun, so all the power to them.
---
I once had a Ghostface teabag at me from the second floor window of Lery's, while I was hanging on hook downstairs. I believe I cancelled his power, so he retaliated.
---
If I recall correctly the killer gets I think 625 bp for a quitter bonus as opposed to high bp for the actual sacrifice unless that changed last update to which I wouldnt know because I havent played killer since then.
---
Dweet here
---
Usually survivors will use a bloody party streamer to single that they are okay with farming.
---
If they don't use one be wary as they might not want to farm.
---
I disagree. It is an indirect fuck you to the survivors.
---
You don't understand what I'm saying. It is the message -  not the effect. The effect is obviously always in favour of the killer and hinders the survivors.. But they way in which they leave the game is basically who they are pointing the finger at. This doesn't have any implications other than a killer realising they play like a twat because they get lots of DC's. Or at least - this is the message the DCer wants them to recieve.
---
Open a new steam account and enable family share with it. You will have to start over in that account but you get to play with them.
---
Nope. Using your power (Stalking) counts as an action.

Oh nvm then

They're funny, I love her vault animation.

BHVR said they have no plans for fixing gates because you failed your objective twice by not powering gens and not getting hatch...as if the matchmaking isn’t total shit and you can’t get brand new survivors that die/suicide in a couple minutes then your game is fucked. Lazy ass excuse
---
Fuck.
---
Can you verify the wiki is accurate?
---
Spine chill is literally amazing when you're opening the exit gates. You can tell if they're coming or not because no killer is going to moonwalk to the gates -- they look dead-ass right at it.

You keep saying "just fix matchmaking", but how do you intend they "fix" matchmaking?  
---
Either you have a low rank baby killer facing off against survivors they have no business being pitted against,or you have a group with 1 or 2 survivors that know what they are doing and some low ranks that get bullied. At least the survs have comms and can help the low rank player. The killer has nothing but themselves.   
---
low rank killer vs a couple red rank survs is far more unbalanced than the red rank killer vs a couple red rank survs and some lowbie survs. red rank survs will absolutely shit on a baby killer, where as a red rank killer still has to contend with at least 1 or 2 appropriate rank survs.
---
Being matched with the highest rank in the party is the best option bhvr has in this scenario, in my opinion.
---
I assume he meant meg and accidentally added an "a" on the end

Yeah they do but it's not right for this game .-.

His, Freddy's, and Quentin's perks are all universal but they seem to only appear at the later survivor/killer levels.

I love this format for memes!

I’ve been completing a ritual that I got that day, but then later that night I get a second ritual. It’s weird cause it wasn’t even 24 hours.

Leatherface had a reboot in 2003 and I'm pretty sure something else too after, and Ghostface had a recent remake with a series called Scream IIRC
---
I hope so other wise damn that's so fucked
---
It would be. As said I added the /s afterwards cause its reddits way of showing sarcasm. And i forgot it.
---
The devs said they don't ban for macros just make sure it's a keyboard macro just pressing buttons and nothing else.
---
Wait what's her vault animation
---
I play her and she's not a very common killer in matches so I've never seen it
---
I think you meant somebodies cause he snitchin on errybody
---
Real shit I used to leave the room and watch in horror from a distance whenever this part came on. I don't like getting chased and get super anxious when others get chased. ☹
---
Come together is like vigil lol
---
She jumps and lands on the ledge of the window then jumps off lmao

it's also for the Nurse, if you didn't know you can interrupt her chain blinks and stop her from blinking. 99% of the time against a good Nurse though it won't help you and still probably get you hit.
---
Some like to tunnel but most are pretty chill.
---
I'm also pretty sure they enjoy getting pallet slammed.

It’s deliverance basically and a worse botany knowledge. Botany increases healing by 30% and efficiency of healing items by 30%.
---
Too op.
---
Wraith with stacked speed add ons is A tier I’d say, so much map pressure and often get free stealth hits, combine it with nurses calling and it matter too much if you give up on a chase as you can just stealth and find them. Sadly you can’t use those add ons all the time though.
---
Well Rancor would work perfectly. They DS you and become obsession and then just die when the gens get done
---
Damn, that’s my dream right here.
---
I AIN'T THE SHARPEST TOOL IN THE SHED
---
Problem is that it relies on you getting slugged
---
You could just... Look away
---
Until the killer swoops back around and snatches you up... then you'll say, "Oh snap!"
---
the threat of DS is good enough lol. If you play laurie and theres an obession in the match the killer probably assumes you have DS and will leave you slugged even if you dont
---
Slug them?
---
I mean its not a waste. Just overkill
---
They’re the absolute best. I’m definitely not biased or anything by being one.
---
Can't use noed if the gens never get finished *taps head*
---
I’ve only been to rank 13 but it seems like every time I play against him I never get away. Plus there’s almost no teamwork when I play. That’s why I play SWF.
---
Console has inbuilt recoding, uses phone.
---
Well, thats a win for you if they do that. You can also try slow vaulting or medium vaulting a pallet or window when they are right by you, forcing the grab
---
👏😂
---
Say sike right now.
---
Actually I main only the thiccest of bois, the clown.
---
'tis but a meme, sir
---
He is one of my mains and i agree he is bad, however he is highly overlooked tbh. I have been able in red ranks with him, pig and plague to get 4ks fairly consistently without the need of scumbag tactics. And it very much is dependent on who the player is, there is Scorpionz on twitch who is a god tier pig main. A ton of people like playing the Wraith in higher ranks and do very well with him. And Plague is actually gaining in popularity a little but which is exciting and i am so glad i get to see more Plags when im survivor.
---
Just sayin I don’t think he should have infinite invisibility.
---
Seems perfectly fine I mean your totem is totally hidden and not next to an objective
---
Thank you.
---
That is literally teaming, and even subconsciously, if you saw a random next to your friend, you know you would chase the random.
---
It’s so dumb. Literally no point in SWF unless you’re all the same ability now... why would you take in a mixed SWF to verse a red rank killer, such a waste of time.
---
That's a good idea,thanks :D I guess make your choice could be pretty nasty on Demogorgon or Hag
---
God is it so painful having to watch the old hag trap animations again. It’s like everything was set to half speed.
---
Thank you, that's good to know cause they seem uncommon!
---
That’s a twist

Very cool and original post have my upvote

“Here cums the Trapper”
---
Some good advice here generally but come on now... 
---
The only thing killers complain about on this sub is 'toxicity'. Teabagging and using flashlights is not being toxic. Attempting to distract the killer is not being toxic. Hitting the killer with a pallet or blinding the killer is not being toxic. Looping or running from the killer is not being toxic. If you have a problem with any of these things speak to the devs, not the players.
---
-And your advice for this is to... Ragequit? How about just don't let it get to you? How about, up your game, don't get distracted so easily, remember you are playing for fun, don't be a sore loser.
---
The only thing toxic is being abusive (through comms), or abusing game mechanics. That is where the line is drawn.
---
they’re groovin
---
Probably
---
OP literally gave killers advice to DC... shame.
---
Thanks anyways! Ya true I bet they're the same items, I just didnt play yet last October lol
---
Lmao, I didnt know how cancerous flashlight was before. How the fuck did they let that shit slide for so long...
---
A god amongst the mortal
---
When u spawn u wanna go to the other side of the map cuz thats where the survivors mostly spawn,
---
If u can get barbeque and chili,
---
Dont be doctor cuz hes a super bad killer so try wraith and trapper i would not suggest nurse if your just starting to play killer,
---
Just experiment with diffrent kilker see wich one your best with,
---
Don't camp or tunnel cuz A. Youll lose bloodpoints and thatll prevent you from piping up B youll have survivors forever hate you (and a ton of hate messages
---
But thats all the tips i got hope this helped:)
---
This is a very solid survivor concept in my opinion, j really wanna see how some kit for Chelsea would look like/work
---
It can’t be posted enough, it needs fixing.
---
I've never seen this comment before... you shall be awarded the greatest of all awards
---
This was temple of Purgation
---
It is that easy. As the killer, you have the advantage of knowing the location of each and every generator. This makes it very easy to patrol and find survivors because their main objective is to complete 5 of them. If you think this basic strategy I'm telling you isn't easy to understand then fine, stick to camping but you're not going to win any games and I can tell you that as a survivor main.
---
"Screw PiG!!" - Fottage from a hidden camera inside a Behavior meeting.
---
I think as he comes out of a portal
---
I mean death garden was actually pretty fun.
---
all the killer gets is 625 BP in Brutality. The killer loses out on tons of Sacrifice, Deviousness, and Hunter that they could've potentially have gotten off the survivor if said survivor didn't DC.
---
While I don't condone DCing, and you are technically better off toughening it out on the hook for the better of your teammates, if the survivor doesn't care about their -2 pip they really aren't losing much themselves on a DC while getting facecamped so I don't blame survivors who give up in matches like this since they are usually the least engaging sort of matches that don't offer any sort of reward or incentive in trying to even win with a shitty campy killer.
---
I swear that makes no sense? For the exit gates to be powered, you have to complete all gens, hence making them spawn next to each other
---
Try play with your food and rancor :)
---
take that OP deliverance out
---
I only flashlight a wraith if he's camping. Since his weakness to lightburn helps make saves.
---
I'm at a point where I don't have any survivors that manage to loop me for long, and I believe it's thanks to me not avoiding a good chase when I was still learning
---
They hated him for speaking the truth
---
Hahah nice try but never going to happen, not in DbD.

Ehhh no point for ruin, normally that gives 2 minutes for them to find it as you patrol the other gens

I love this!

This is why I hate rank reset. With working fulltime and going to school in the evenings I can only get to green ranks which is where I like to sit or low rank purple. I like how the players play on both sides. I get why rank reset is necessary, but if I can only manage to get to rank 10 I hate being put back to yellow or grey ranks. I know all the tips because I've been playing for 2 1/2 years. Putting me with teammates since I main survivors makes it hard for me to get out of yellow ranks because you do have to rely on your teammates to an extent to escape and/or pip. Once I get into green ranks I do great. I think on rank reset you should get reset to the lowest rank of the color you are in. I can play every other weekend so ate rank reset I'm playing with a bunch of people on both sides that do not know how to play the game effectively. That makes it harder for me. I dont expect to always escape, but other players with less experience can make it impossible for me to pip when I clearly should have been able to. I hope the devs reevaluate the rank reset system.
---
Dont use corrupt, if you have ruin and corrupt theu will just search for ruin and corrupt is renigged.
---
I've been playing for 7 months. I've only gotten 1 character and 4 perks
---
*Laughs in Hawkins National Labaratory*
---
His name is Phillip Ojomo. Ojomo is an African last name
---
Haddonfield is generally a really bad map for most killers, but I agree with you on everything else. As long as I get 2 hooked before I get Mori’d I don’t mind
---
Fixing? Why
---
Ok dude lol you're right I'm a complete idiot noob who has never played the game and goes off of "my favorite streamer" /s or maybe I play killer and survivor at purple/red ranks consistently and I know what I'm talking about lol 
---
Self care loses games. Pure and simple. If you are worried about being injured its better to run adrenaline, iron will, Bond. Empathy, a halfway decent med kit even.
---
I play purple/red rank survivor (solo que) with bond and I cannot tell you how many games I have lost becuase every time someone is injured they just sit there and self care. I am literally watching them do it with bond while I am injured worked on the central gen becuase I know the killer is chasing a teammate and we need this pressure. 
---
So to put it in your words, I am sorry to inform you that Self-care is a crutch perk for noobs who are too scared of being injured to just play the game. It is not even in the top 10 survivor perks. B or C tier at best, should never ever be used over bond, plain and simple.
---
Do you get double from rituals?
---
Ah, I did not know that
---
I’m torn. I’d like for better hex totem spawns, but if they did that people would just memorize the spawns and that would defeat the purpose. I think survivors should have to destroy all totems in order to destroy Ruin, or maybe two at least.
---
Passive toxicity.. way to go community
---
Wraith doesn't have a purple clapper. 
---
The Ghost is an extremely powerful add-on, regardless of rarity it's power is not to be underrated. If Wraith was a higher tier killer I would definitely put more time back into him bc when I was first learning killer I was having a TON of fun playing him.
---
His teleport begins on cooldown at the beginning of the match.
---
Well when you’re lvl 50+ on any devotion you get 300 per level. I average 2-3 levels a day so 9k in roughly 2 weeks. You can’t really do it matched base as you get a daily match exp,emblem exp and time exp. many different things come into it
---
Every 100 levels is 25.3k shards
---
Face camping huntress who can't throw hatchets for shit also means NOED
---
A fucking colossal shitload, impossible basically. Its a crawl, you cant sprint through a crawl.
---
I am not happy
---
#*Angry oink*
---
Dome
---
9000 shards every 2 weeks is 643 shards per day. How many shards you get per level depends on your current level, you get between 50 and 300 shards. Assuming you get 300 per level, you need 2,5 levels per day. How many xp you get per game depends on the length of the time you spend in game. Let's say on average you need 6 games perk rank. So the answer is about 15 games per day.
---
no terrior radius or red stain out of a portal for a few seconds
---
I agree, but putting it right next to an objective is just dumb
---
srsly tho I don't get why you would use inner strength when the max amount of times you  would use it a game is 5 and some survivors just cleanse them for BP anyway.
---
Noticed your survivor. OoO
---
No it is not the strongest loop on any map lol. It's not THAT good if the killer knows what he's doing. Almost every map has a main building that is way worse than shack.
---
The best way to be toxic with survivors is to bing bong the entire game. This will make you lose your sanity but they will be in a trance of nothing but bing bongs.
---
Ok I'll do that and another thing do you think I should learn advanced killer mechanics in brown ranks or is that too much for them?
---
They are not dcing it’s a bug
---
Flair doesn't check out
---
imagine thinking wraith needs a nerf
---
You just hope they think it’s haunted grounds because you’re spirit ..
---
I'm playing 50/50 just in case. I just don't like it as a survivor and rarely have issues with it as a killer because of what I have written above.
---
Just wait 60 seconds it ain’t that hard
---
Throw in some Spirit-like spasms as mechanical malfunctioning to go with scary blade noises and you got a monster
---
On mobile???
---
Maybe it’s just timing.
---
What do you mean by advanced
---
Then corrupted intervention or whatever its called is much better.
---
If a killer spends 60 seconds standing around doing nothing, then they give up any and all pressure on three survivors and basically forfeit their chances of winning then and there. Neither you nor Your team are punished for a killer chasing somebody with ds, if anything it makes the killer's time useless and gives you 60 seconds of free repairs.
---
this patch fixed my killer queues
---
Yeah, the No Self Healing bug on PS4 is killing me, can we PLEASE get that fixed?
---
69 looks like he should be a killer
---
Yes there is.
---
Go to your quick menu -&gt; dead by daylight -&gt; currently playing with -&gt; killers name
---
This does not work when the killer is showing as offline!
---
It's also really hard without a range addon tbh (except for green, it's hard with green electrode too because it slows down your shock too much. It's easiest with the interview tape, but pretty easy with brown and yellow electrodes too.)
---
There was noed discussions on the subreddit? I thought only the forums did that
---
Play nurse
---
Yes, dashboard and go to "players met". It will show the 3 survivors as well as the killers Gamertag. So the most recent name that isn't a fellow survivor is the killer you've been matched up with.
---

---
Are you serious?
---
I’m not that great of a killer, but I somehow managed to get nurse’s “lethal blink 500 times” in the week and a half that I tried to get good at her. They were never really that hard, just took longer. But yeah, I got one earlier this week that was kill the obsession in a public match 15 times, I don’t know if that’s new, but it sure was easy
---
More useful then some of the perks were getting lately as survivors
---
And I'm sure you have plenty of games where it's literally never found, it evens out
---
If you're good enough that pressure just makes them fear for their life and hide the whole game lol
---
Nerf pig?
---
While visually it would make sense, contextually she's the good one here
---
You should know how to do that since there might be green rank survivors because of rank reset
---
I was thinking about back when it buffed vault speed- turns out they returned that feature
---
not only does it make the flashlight burn quicker it also makes it blind quicker which throws off your timing drastically which is why people that are really good with a flashlight take only batteriest and fillaments (the yellow one)
---
Wrong post I think
---
Thank you very much for your answers!
---
You were spectating so maybe it's a bug and you couldn't see the outlines? Maybe she gave up because the rest jigsaw pieces were too far. Unless this Nancy confirms she went to all of them which would be the biggest F.
---
In the scoreboard it seems like they DC. And everytime it happened it was really a game where the killer got destroyed. In two of the them I got a flashlight save at the end to help a fella escape
---
does his shock prevent  you from vaulting if he hits you with it right before the vault?  I swear that happened to me one time but wasn't sure.
---
I didn’t want my hyena laughs to be heard
---
I rarely tried brown and yellow ones, thanks for advice
---
I like this *EXCEPT* for chase music. I enjoy the chase music being of whoever the killer is. But for menu music? Yes, sign me up.
---
Corrupt intervention is great, but it’s limited by its timer and the fact that it only affects three generators. It’s great for zoning survivors but it’s limits hold it back, unlike Ruin. Ruin can be destroyed earlier but it affects every generator. It also has the potential to last much longer than Corrupt intervention
---
I disagree. I don't think anybody expects this to fix *everything*, just to fix the matchmaking with SWF so that it stay balanced in terms of skill level. In my opinion it's not punishing anybody, because you don't need to pair up with a low rank friend in public matches to learn the game. It's better off for you to play on your own around your own skill level anyway so that you can learn as you go, or do a custom match with your friends so you can learn privately. With that being said I have high rank friends who just want to play rounds with me, and they do so knowing that they may end up matched with a sweaty try hard killer and that is okay. They join knowing this possibility and just want to enjoy the round with a friend, they don't care about winning. This is just the mindset others will have to adopt until the system is changed again.
---
It'll help lower the amount of SWFs bullying high rank survivors. It won't fix deranking but that doesn't seem to be the purpose of this change anyway, and like you said it's hard to prove who is doing it.
---
Grouping with your high ranked friends is also easier than purposely deranking or creating an entirely new account. This is the most common way to make sure you're paired with easy killers since it requires little effort. Yes, there will be try hards who go the more difficult path (deranking, new accounts) to fuel their god complex but I think alot of people will just deal with the change because they're too lazy to abuse the system.
---
If it turns out this change has more negative consequences than positive, I'm sure BHVR will change it. However the change just happened so it's too soon to tell.
---
Combat Straps by far.
---
What "advanced mechanics" are we talking about?
---
Anyway, just learn at your own pace. It's not like you can't face experienced players at brown ranks.
---
&gt;discussions
---
nah dog, we don't do that here
---
Yeah, in Deathgarden it's just a skin tho
---
Favourite killer to play against: The Shape, because I feel proud when I spot him at the start of the game and make a run for it in time.
---
Favourite killer to play as: Legion, because stabbity stab stab. Especially hilarious against locker-Dwights when killer instinct finds them.
---
Favourite survivior: Laurie. I can never hook a Laurie when it's her third hook, since I main her as survivor.
---
If you’re the obsessiin, good killers often wait out the DS rather than pick you up.
---
Not a visual bug for me, definently dropped a rank due to an early DC and next game I was 100 percent one rank lower than I was the previous game.
---
Yeah doesn't bother me either. Although  now alot of people go for totems because of Nancy's perk so it's never an issue anymore!
---
I wasted mine to prepare for the demogorgon because I may or may not have impulsively Prestiged Ash. I really regret using the 24 or so cakes
---
7 people didn’t like your laugh
---
How does it feel to have found a legit leak!?
---
It was a middle ground, it didn’t work, hence this new system
---
I’ve had games where I’ll do good, not get hooked, save people, do gens al ya normal stuff. Then get downed by NOED and no one will come save you.
---
r/emojipolice There’s no escaping death. Hands on your head and don’t fuckin move
---
I would like if the chase music wasn’t eat rape, I could just be out having a stroll with big boy bubba and I walk towards someone in the grass that I didn’t see that start to run and I go deaf and they can fast vault windows and I don’t hear it.
---
I feel your pain, I regret buying ash
---
Exactly. For me though the survivors still don't cleanse totems meaning I still get to use my noed
---
No she's my friend in real life we we're on call and we couldn't stop saying 'wtf' lol

Bond.
---
I will not tolerate Tenacity slander in this household. The only thing tenacity needs to be a top tier perk is to play the NFL theme song while you’re on the ground. 
---
Non-shocking any perk from Ash is non-existent.
---
Eh I don't regret buying ash more so dumping the 1 million or so bloodpoints into him I had saved for the demogorgon forcing me to use my gruesome gateus as there was only 3 days left till release
---
Because it's not bannable if they just do it a couple times trolling or not.
---
Huuuuuge F.
---
That's the point? You're not supposed to get downed. Perks that help when downed only give you a chance to escape.
---
Its based on mythos and movies like Legion, where a group of kids start doing shit like they did. Its a popular folktale is mountainous areas.
---
I like his character, but his teachable’s are awful, I wish I never got them.
---
Don't let it bother you, sometimes people are just salty assholes without any provocation.
---
Agitation, maybe?
---
the devs need too revamp the three original killer moris there kinda meh
---
Same thing happened to me but in for honour it’s so annoying.
---
Yea those teachables are pretty bad but I do like using MOM as its satisfying to get it to activate considering the conditions you need now
---
Huntress' mori is my second favourite wtf
---
No one likes come back perks,
---
Bond and in a SWF botany.
---
It's demogorgon
---
lmnop
---
Who cares
---
Fortunately his teachables are Left Behind bad so EVENTUALLY we'll see some sort of rework I imagine.
---
I would remove the demogorgon for the spirit
---
Scared yet also slightly aroused Dweet
---
Ok I get it. But it needs to get fixed. My flashlights...
---
You can get them in the bloodweb. It's the ultra rare Key
---
Anytime I've used noed all the totems get cleansed because I use ruin!
---
Seen a lot of people just running around trees haha
---
Nope, they want you to chase them the whole match.
---
It was pretty funny when my friends and I realized
---
"Bro, did that totem give 1000 points?"
---
"I think it did"
---
"Holy shit"
---
“You right my bro” or “you right my bad”?
---
Yeah it’s so annoying my player level has not been moving as long as it says it’s a dc i’m owed alot lol
---
Weekly steam maintenance sucks, but it does have a consistent time, just remember it and don’t play when it occurs.
---
Would it be too much of a buff to make him completely invisible when he cloaks? His outline is so obvious in game
---
That cat's a h*cking C H O N K E R right there.
---
Yeah even though I got downvoted for it
---
I wasn't trying to insult you personally, I was talking about the hivemind mentality where a large portion of users on this sub swing one way or another because it's just "how it is" because a streamer says so and it fits their narrative.
---
I explain how it's a viable perk here https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d5ybq3/self_care_is_shit_tho_but_i_definitely_thought_of/f0pcgt4/?context=3
---
Legion is the only killer in the game that has a different way of being looped(except the nurse) and that’s why I love playing against him. You have to use your head.
---
I used an emoji, reddit has an aversion to them, post an emoji in any sub i dare you, even the quiet ones lol
---
I'm behind you on fueling the gens because it's fucking boring just hitting skill checks and annoying at best with Ruin. Also I'm down for the Ruin rework but it still seems like it would be in every loadout and I would like all perks Surv and Killer to be reworked so there isn't an obvious 4 you're looking to get. Personally, I'm still behind an EGC that starts at the last gen and to move the gate switches to poles on random parts of the map (and include a 3rd gate)
---
If you get a toxic survivors just basement camp their asses. 
---
Unless you get a full team of decisive strike/borrowed time all with flashlights. In which case have fun
---
Regardless it's funny.
---
As of right now killers do get punished by having points taken away from them for camping.
---
Only problem is a lot of campers at lower ranks are new players who don’t know this or people who don’t care. 
---
I wouldn’t mind something else to prevent outright face camping though
---
Yes I know. But what I suggested is that there is a mechanism that’s not a perk. Similar to AFK survivors get crows on their head.
---
1. You have to be good as her imo
---
2. Prestige 3
---
3. No clue
---
4. Just toxic people or the killer is a camper
---
5. No clue
---
6. Might be because of their perks
---
Wraiths legs always freaked me out when he first came out, idk why but there's just something about them.
---
Holy shit there’s prestiging?
---
Actually had someone get slugged with Tenacity + Unbreakable in my last game. I picked them up anyways. :)
---
It keeps you from being affected by it. You also won't scream as long as you're in a locker. You also won't scream if you have calm spirit, as that keeps you from screaming at all. So infectious fright won't do anything to you.
---
You misunderstood the point on OoO. Against Wraith, Meyers, or Ghostface, it makes it very hard to sneak around. It’s especially bad for Ghostface who will lose his power any time the OoO user is around (assuming they are decently aware).
---
If you need a smurf account to “learn” a new killer you aren’t a good killer to begin with
---
Oh god im blind it’s early

Excuse me where is my god pallet sir

---
Despite where totem spawns are, survivors after time will memorize them. It's the risk you take running a hex totem. I agree they shouldnt be put in direct sight of an objective, but an experienced survivor will find it regardless.
---
You are missing the whole point because a huge portion of the player base play video games to play with their friends... This update discourages playing with your friends straight up... Even if you're all lvl 20, eventually someone will rank up faster and force harder and harder killers on their friends. This will ultimately discourage a large portion of the player base to stop playing. Killers already complain about waiting 20 minutes for a game... I hope they are ready for hour long wait times because anyone that liked playing with friends has moved on...
---
Fun = will be nerfed ASAP.
---
"Community complaints" = was fine until some streamer complained, now everyone hates it.
---
Na they pretty much only disconnect when they feel the killer is being unfair towards them (something personally I don't believe is a thing in this game) or if they start the game and get caught first.
---
The message definitely isn't lost unless the killer is an idiot or just ignorant. I am talking about the specific difference between D/Cing and killing yourself. One of them sends a message, the other doesn't. Do with that what you will.
---
I don't understand why people are hitting back at me so hard on this. It is just a fact. That is why they chose to DC rather than kill themselves.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d93rdv/matchmaking_bug_on_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
when you get to bloodweb level 50 on a character u can lose all ur perks and shit to get a cosmetic that makes ur character bloody. u can do it 3 times for each character, each prestige giving u another part of the cosmetic (on killers, I think it’s weapon, body, then head, and survivor I think it’s shirt then head then pants, could be pants then head but I don’t remember cus it’s been awhile)
---
Tuxedo Wraith is so dashing 😍
---
I have started to love these flashlight wielding “heroes”. It’s so easy to just know that at least one person isn’t doing anything as I hear the insistent *click click click* as I patrol the generators
---
Even told the killer I had DS so he juggled me and then slugged me the second time he tunneled me off of hook
---
Literally makes no sense. Exit gates spawn at the start of the game, they’re not triggered by something that happens during the game.
---
1. People like nurse because shes really good. I agree with the low skill ceiling, but she has a decent skill floor
---
2. P3 means prestige 3. It doesnt do much for you, but you get a cool outfit for the character.
---
3. When you play well, you pip. When you get enough pips, you rank up. You can get two per match.
---
4. People suck
---
5. People dont like strong perks used against them.
---
6. Claudette is seen as tryhard because she blends in to the map. Everyone has stigma against certain survivors. I personally hate kate.
---
Wow. That’s awesome. Thanks!
---
They can never completely abolish camping from the game. It will always be there. What they can do and have been somewhat, is incentivize non camping strats for killers. By adding perks that hurt the killer when they camp and tunnel they are trying to make people not do it. I think a perk that increases other survs gen speed by 10% if you are within the killers terror radius would be awesome or if the killer is within X meters of the hook.
---
Not Correct, he should be getting some BloodLust action (Bloodlust Gamers!)
---
Memes are memes.  Could find a meme about pong and 50% of the world will still find it funny XD
---
Didn't spawn :D *gets noed'd*
---
I can honestly imagine Steve doing this if Darts ever grew up with Dustin
---
I hear a lot of hate for Kate an Nea haha, I don’t even know their base perks. The one I do know is Bill and his unbreakable.
---
Sums it up pretty well
---
That would be the best killer for perks so far. Decent ideas but perks are a bit much, especially healing a health state after unhooked
---
1) she is deceptively hard. She looks easy, but is anything but.
---
2) Prestige 3. Once you level up to 50 in a  blood web, you can prestige, reset the character and gain a new cosmetic piece  P3 claudette or whoever just use the new bloody outfit
---
3) progress to the next rank. You need 4 pips to rank up. You can lose 1, gain none, or gain up to 2 per match
---
4)wish I knew
---
5) survivors like to win and dont like things that will mess that up
---
6) reputation from players in the community. Many people who like to be sneaky for example use P3 Claudette because she is almost impossible to see in many maps
---
Yes.
---
i'd rather survivors take all the totems than have 3 gens be done when i've chased someone for like 30 seconds
---
Lmao. Have they finally fixed the rank reset error that’s been an issue for me for like 6 months??
---
all names censored. 
---
A little analysis of the clip: after hook, I quickly spinned and realized with BBQ that I could not make it in time to hook the downed guy because the TTV is near him already. I then decided to get hatchet to continue the chase, but surprisely TTV player didn't heal the downed player. I returned and saw him running straight towards me, so I faked that I didn't see him so he would hesitate with dodging the following hatchet, which I landed. I am assuming that hatchet tilted him. He claims that I have walls and I am running straight to him, even thought there were only 2 players including the downed guy left in the game. 
---
TTV guy is Rank 8 btw. I didn't get any chance to play after rank reset.
---
These now happen in the post game lobby whenever I play the killer and bring NOED.
---
This game is a reflection on real life belief systems.  You are a killer. You are playing the game, you are thus hated by survivors.  It's like saying you are pro choice or are a civil rights activist because you support the second amendment - you take a side and become an enemy.
---
Pretty much
---
New Nea cosmetic looking good
---
We already have the clown tho?
---
tbh I mostly play survivor and I think this would be good for him. he’s in a weird place.
---
Haha, I do that.
---
I can already tell it would be too much, hence why I suggested a rework. It would be a living hell for low rank survivors and might even be too much, pushing them away.
---
I enjoyed reading the post and liked a lot about it, but at the same time I strongly dislike the idea of survivors being the reason for being tunneled and that the killer shouldn't really care about "tunneling is bad" stuff. And I don't exactly think killers really have to care about "tunneling is bad" stuff either. It's complicated.
---
What the bad that I see about it:
---
1. The unhooked person who reaps the grief of tunneling wasn't the reason for it in most cases. Sure, if you got unhooked and just stumbled into the killer who was doing other things - it's your blame. But it isn't the thing that is called by the word "tunneling". And if the killer is really persistent or you had farmer teammates or more complicated reasons (more about that below) - you're essentially guaranteed to have a bad match, losing your item and getting less points that you could have got otherwise *IF* there isn't a huge skillgap between your skills at looping and killer's skills in general *AND* you aren't in the open/pallets are still intact/your team is actually committing to gens.
---
2. Some killer's abilities/perks allow them to trick players thinking it's safe to unhook and then proceed to tunnel (Demogorgon/Nurse/Mint rag Hag etc., stealthy killers). Again, the tunneled survivor is skrewed because of the reasons that aren't dependent on the actions of that survivor.
---
I understand that it's the nature of a victim role - a lot of things are going out of your control. But still being tunneled sucks, especially if you just wanna play the game normally, you aren't toxic, but killer is really stuck on the idea of sacrificing you specifically and ignores everything else. Here on Reddit I've even heard about some screwed "honor code" that dictates some killer to basically tunnel you to death if you just can loop efficiently and aren't toxic, nothing.
---
I don't really like post game salt and would advise people against writing stuff like "trash killer" etc. I also think tunneling as a phenomenon should be put as a blame on developers rather than killer's role. But I also think everybody would have more fun (even killer, I'm saying it as a killer player who slugs people who were tunneled by me and did it even before DS rework) without tunneling. Can't and won't force my opinion on anybody tho.
---
yeah, im thankful it wasn’t.
---
first of all, demogorgon is a monster and legion is just kids with knives and second, i'd rather the devs revert legion's FF movement speed and vault speed changes which should be the little boost that will make them a teeny tiny bit better
---
The real bastards are the ones who run out and don't let you get a hit first. If you're gonna be a bitch, at least gimme some points.
---
Lullaby stops.
---
If you kill rando, but spare friend, that's exactly what "biased" means.
---
They then enter a mode where other survivors can hit him to gain an instant 2000 point bonus to the altruism category
---
It’s pointless, why would you want a perk when you plan to lose and have all 5 gens done. Getting those petty kills at the end won’t help you pip. Just annoying as it’s no skill because it gives you a speed boost. The exposed effect is fine but the speed makes it op as you can’t hold a chase for too long
---
I dig it
---
I try to be a good killer, I usually leave survs once I hook them and if they're unhooked, I let the minute pass so I don't get DS'd, but yeah, if their teammates have a brain of a squid and they unhook their teammates right in front of me, it's on them.
---
Can someone explain the “obsession “?  As a survivor is it good to be that, bad?  Does it make the killer more likely to find you?
---
Haha. You deserved that. Just leave the game.
---
I really just went OOHHH when you made it in.
---
If you didn't get any kills prior to gens being done, you probably played poorly. You can afk for a bit and come back at the end and still get a few kills with NOED. A player might play really bad and accomplish nothing all game. Then, he'll 4k with NOED and think that they played really well. It's a crutch perk that rewards bad play.
---
I'm not even a wraith main and I dislike this. Leave Bing Bong alone.
---
WGLF, Borrowed Time, Adrenaline and Mettle of Man
---
Maybe?
---
It needs to do something awesome, even if it's just once like Unbreakabill. But not sure what.
---
my kind of discussions
---
I bought him as a fan of the show, and because he's modeled after and voiced by Bruce Campbell. Anything else was a bonus to me (but thank goodness we're not locked to his perks because Flip-Flop and Buckle Up are just bad).
---
Damn that dove thing is a very fun idea.
---
Only if they’re being toxic. I’ve had people body block me through most of a game and so I make sure I tunnel them. Sorry not sorry.
---
Yup. Sometimes if someone runs me around all game, especially as wraith with noed, when I finally catch them I sit in front of them cloaked so borrowed time doesn’t go off, and insta down in case of adr
---
I unwind with Trapper specifically because I don't bother trapping until one's hooked and another is slugged. Consistent M1ing is relaxing versus bothering with counterplay and more complex skill.
---
He claimed to be 17, but his birth date that the court had on record states 18. At 18, that’s pedophilia.
---
Actually I take that back. I think once per match the MoM user can jump on the killer's back and ride them like a bull with skill checks for up to 7 seconds. During that time the killer's movement is slowed by 5/10/15% and afterwards the survivor is instantly downed. That seems like some Ash shit to do.
---
I use spine chill a lot, but I don't normally leave gens as soon as it goes off. I try and use the speed boost to get done more, while alerting me that the killer is nearby. I only leave once I hear the heartbeat getting really close.
---
Oh yeah. I was wraith and this one survivor kept looping and flash lighting me when I broke a pallet so as soon as the exit gates were power, NOED kicked in and I targeted him specifically. Very satisfying when I he died.
---
It’s never their fault that they lose it’s always the killers fault, like ruins unfair, hitting a survivor on the open is unfair, everything is unfair. You’ll get used to it
---
Thats true, however what i am saying is there are a few. Not a lot of people are good with him and he is the 2nd worst in the game right now. Many people just enjoy playing him but some people are very good as him. He is in need of some changes to how his ability works but he in the right hands with enough practice he is completely viable. None of the killers are non-viable imo and they can all be played in red ranks to success if you know what your doing :))
---
I don’t know from the statistics but it seems to be longer or the same as breaking normally. I would only shred a pallet if it was already thrown down and I just want to kick it from far away instead of having to waste time walking up to it. Also I’d imagine that brutal, fire up, etc. don’t affect the shred so if you’re running those just normal kick.
---
You got escape points??? Dah hell
---
ohhh sounds like base build for Claudette
---
Now this is some awesome shit
---
The Survivor rule book.
---
Tbh Wraith and Myers don't rely on stealth as much (and Myers is invisible to OoO in T1) and they can also benefit from OoO users:
---
* PWYF is a really good perk on Wraith, and having OoO obsession in the match while you have PWYF is an actual advantage for the killer
---
* Myers can really benefit from instadowning an obsession if he has any obsession-related perks
---
The Ghost Face is completely screwed by OoO, not gonna lie. I think GF should be invisible to OoO while shrouded tbh.
---
We’ve been asking for a new game mode for 2-3 years, or something else to do. It won’t happen most likely as the game is very simplistic and has the same thing over and over but yet it’s fun.
---
It’s only happened like 2 other times where Survivors were salty that I played decent.
---
This made me audibly "HA" in a public bathroom now I'm scared to come out
---
I dunno, I'm rank 7 and got teamed only with people within 2 levels of me for 3 games after the patch. The killers were between 5-10. If I couldn't see the killers' levels, I'd still know they're 5-10 because I went against ruin, BBQ chili and NOED in each of the 3 games.
---
RIP
---
If you get lucky with totems and you use DH and so on. There’s a chance, but other than that it’s just looping his slow ass for days
---
considering the fact I got a swf of rank 1, 2, and 4 as a rank 11 killer, i don’t think this cant happen anymore.
---
True it was. Idk why you were so respectful explaining this. It really surprised me for some reason that you didnt just say "bleh killer main". Good shit.
---
Claudette on a Odd bulb green flashlight
---
I here that flip flop can be good combined with other perks, but so situational that it doesnt seem worth it to me for when it does work out.
---
1. Nurse has a high skill rating, in lower ranks all survivors are easily predictable so are easy to wack, but in red teir she's an absolute  [ U N I T ]  of a killer, when you load in and hear the first blink you know you have to bring your A game.
---
2. P3 is prestige 3, you have p1, p2 and p3. They are shown by bloody weapons, bloody clothes and bloody head for killer. Survivors have trousers/skirts, shirts, and head.
---
3. When you finish a game you can see a bar fill up on the end screen, you see 3 pips, a black pip is a safty pip, it means you did the minimum to not de-rank. 1 pip means you gain a pip towards your next rank and did well in the game! But 2 pips means you did very very well and basically  carried however multiple people can have doubled piped
---
4. Why do people DC? many reasons, the most common is that the killer tunnels them straight from the beginning and camps them on hook. Other reasons are laggy killer, throwing team mates, accadently dc (bad wifi on the survivors side) or the killer having BS perks that makes the game no fun I.E NOED
---
5. Omg I hate NOED, I've had games where the killer has no kills and is hardly making an impact on the game and is gen rushed... and then NOED activates and suddenly he has a 3k... it's not fair that they have to do literally nothing to get some free kills, it's gotten to the point where me and my friends are playing and if they killer isn't doing so hot we instantly take out totems (We do this anyway unless the killer is really good) because we know for a fact they will have it. However with haunted grounds, I don't come across it often and am not to bothered when it is popped, adds more stress and fun to the game (for me and my friend bc we are over lvl 250) If you have any questions about other perks ask me!
---
6. Claudette is seen as a "I'm gonna hide in the corner of the map, do half a gen and then escape.. oh? Someone's on the hook? I'll get them! Oh no wait, I hear 0.3 seconds of a heart beat.. back to the edges of the map I go-" obvi not all Claudette mains are like this, I've come across some who run the killer around the whole game. However every one loves Dwight, he's always going to be the baby of the game "baby Dweet" we call him lol 
---
Hope this helps! Any more questions feel free to ask! I'm more of a survivor main where as my best friend is a killer main so I'll be able to answer any questions you have! :)
---
Meh! 🤷‍♀️I would definitely be a snitch too if I was looking at 27 years in jail. My freedom against a weird sense of “loyalty”? Screw that! 
---
Sorry, Dwight!
---
Can't juggle against DS. It's been about a year now since DS was changed.
---
"Coulrophorbia"
---
It is not fixed. You will get nothing if the killers DC's at any point you're in the game.
---
precisely!
---
•Reduced total number of boxes spawned by 1.
---
•Can no longer stack add-ons that increase number of boxes spawned
---
I thought Thanatophobia was really good on killers like Plague
---
I agreee with bubba all 3 of his perks are good to get also 2 pig perks are good imo she comes with tapp who has good survivor perks and maybe spirit lastly.
---
The amount of players is limited as it requires 4 people per killer so killer will always be the one shafted as they need to get way more people in the game compared to the easily balanced one killer a lobby. Basically we need more people playing survivor.
---
This is like pig and leatherface
---
With a team tho or na
---
What is wrong with DS? Can't play without tunneling?
---
Well as a Legion main in training (I.E. Still waiting for them good rng bloodwebs) I enjoy them due to how they are played. 
---
Oh no, there's 4 med kits, guess I'm playing legion since you cant use Insta heal in DW.
---
Man I hate getting pallet loo-oh wait, either just stop for a second and they drop it, or they run. either way a hit for me and maybe some wood for my fire.
---
Hit someone and 3 heartbeats blast my ears with audible bliss? Im making some BP today.
---
plus under rank 10 it seems a lot of people dont stack up on gens when they find out you're legion even if im not running discordance to try out something else.
---
Honestly I do feel they are in a "solid" place as far as their stats and power work. It's just some minor tweaks to add-ons, and maybe some new ones since their asthma is way worse than Omega nurse and that's not ok
---
It's still really good in combination with DS. If a killer is chasing you after you get unhooked, you can run to a locker and almost be guaranteed either a DS proc or a full heal.
---
I know you can use self care multiple times, but it never really fit my playstyle. In my experience if I'm in a match where I need to heal myself multiple times I'm probably going to lose anyway. I usually bring a single grey health kit and it's usually good enough. Most of the time I have a sense where the killer is/where my team mates are and either get healed by a teammate that's on a gen/ignore my injury and do the remaining gens to proc adrenaline (this situation happens after I use my grey med kit).
---
It was edited.
---
It looks like an improvement over what was happening days ago, but still :/
---
Rogue developer took pity on the big, he was immediately fired
---
I use it to be friendly towards team, or to show any sign of communication.
---
Even if it is being used to egg on, or distract the killer, it isn't toxic. Just like killing isn't toxic..
---
It is the survivors job to waste your time. If you can't catch them and are getting upset because they teabag to get you to continue chasing, then it is on your skill level and you being a sore loser. It is the way you are interpreting it.
---
Ofcourse some people are toxic but this isn't, 'people who teabag' in general.
---
It is a game, a brutal game at that. If you are out to have fun, none of this will bother you.
---
There is a snowflake killer hivemind in this sub which deems crouching and using in game items as toxic behaviour. It is laughable and you don't find it in any other games.
---
Legit, killers find looping, stunning and flashlights 'toxic'. You can tell when they are pissed with you because they focus you.
---
By comfortable do you mean easy? 
---
Tunneling someone has a high chance of them DCing too which naturally makes the game easier. 
---
Personally I find it boring and usually let them all go if 1 person disconnects early on but I can see how people would want an ez farm game.
---
non human killer still uses the human skeleton . spider would be a complete rework of their designs. But not impossible.
---
left Behind now serves a purpose, since EGC completely ruined how it functioned before.
---
*•Crouching now makes a global sound-cue so Survivors don’t get too scared.*
---
Why did you use eminiem instead of actual max though
---
Wow, right??? That would so random &amp; awesome! XD
---
How much is DS? FINALLY
---
Maybe you only see box auras when a trap is placed on you. And then, it's only one aura, and it's the one FURTHEST from you. Once you've used that, it's a 25% chance to get it off, but if you don't get it off, that aura disappears and the box FURTHEST from you again lights up.
---
Adds time to the survivor getting the trap off. And makes it so that if you're unlucky and a gen is done immediately after a trap is placed on you - yeah, you stand a real chance of not surviving.
---
oh, this isn’t from today! this was from saturday
---
Nice opinion but my Legion is mine ONLY
---
my first thought is "why are you playing the game?" when I see someone literally not contributing at all. it's four versus one for a reason. just like when one DC's before their first hook, messes the whole game up.
---
I don’t get why u sat in the locker for all that time tho
---
Laughs in Demogorgon.
---
Thats valid from playing him in red ranks, he sometimes struggles on the more open maps to get the first hit. But if you can position yourself well enough, it is simple to body block stall for enough time to get that first hit or uncloak from behind a wall near the gen which causes the survivors to typically run away, allowing you to hit them pretty easily when the do so. After that its a game of knowing what people are doing and where they are doing it which is fairly predictable after a while and the perk build i run (PWYF, DH/Nurses, Make your Choice and Haunted) allow for me to have extreme map pressure once people are hit once and when the first person gets on hook, allowing for me to snowball very fast most games. Its similar to Plague with Infectious/ whenever someone cleanses. Extreme snowball and knowing where 2-3 people are at all times.
---
Bingbong just chillin in the basement probs
---
her power would let IT to damage the survivors
---
Wtf...
---
yes
---
So instead of finding a totem and cleansing it you want to find canisters and carry them? Is that not an actual harder version of what already exists?
---
Yep, found the SWF Toxic Survival main
---
OUR CUP OVER FLOWETH
---
No don’t let the killers know /s
---
*Laughs in zero portals left*
---
I saw your first post bud...trying really hard there hey? 😂
---
**cries in flower**
---
Can they fix the game so I stop randomly dcing? I don’t want to be punished because the games unstable.
---
Make his yellow reach add on base and he's great. Literally all he needs
---
Getting these achievement made me notice that they correspond to about how much you need to play a certain killer to learn to use their power effectively. I used to be complete shit at Hag and Nurse until I went for “In the Void She Walks” and “Triggered.” I feel like I understand these killers better and Hag has actually gone from my least favorite killer to my top 5. 
---
I think the real difference is that Demogorgon is just easier to get the hang of. He’s got so much going for him right now that you don’t really need clever strats to utilize his powers effectively. 30 practice downs with the pounce is enough to know when to use it and it’s pretty difficult to use the portals ineffectively.
---
Tell that to the 23 people who messaged me on psn so far might get more salt later on.
---
When did I ever say that it was not toxic.
---
Do you read or do you just jump to baseless accusations I said it wasn't bannable.
---
Now let me give you a little piece of advice. 
---
Calling somebody a child after you do something like saying like say stfu only makes  you loo  like an immature moron and it doesn't make you seem any more mature or your point any more valid than the person you're arguing with.
---
Yourself a favour and get a reality check.
---
26-30 Sept
---
You like him nice for u, but u shouldn't say that about any killer, that's your opinion and all u are doing is creating salt to other killer mains like me.
---
In my opinion Ghostface is a complete piece of s**t that doesn't work properly and Legion is my main, but do I go around trying to create salt? No

Canisters would be easier to find than totems as they are meant as a time waster and fast to instal, it would be a very easy mechanic except you do it for each generator. It’s purpose it to buy more time at the start of the match for the killer and a little bit more when other gens need to be worked on. Sometimes Ruin is very hard to find and other times it’s right in the middle of an open field (looking at the Asylum Map). Ruin is randomised but canisters, not so much. Semi hidden locations that aren’t too difficult to find.
---
That’s a win for me, he’d have to wait that long just because of one perk. Also they sometimes won’t know if you have it (if you’re using a survivor other than Laurie) so they’d have to either risk it Incase they didn’t have DS or wait the 40 - 60 seconds. By the time he takes me to a hook he’d have wasted a minute technically in a chase with me.
---
this is a great guide, congratulations and thank you for writting it for us.
---
we need people like you in this community. :)
---
Come together would be Cancer when combined with hope
---
You'll reach a point where shards will ONLY be usable on cosmetics anyways.
---
Its hebephilia
---
Some survivors are loopers, some are gen workers, some are saviors. Gotta play to your strengths
---
it just depends how well you play him. I, for one, am a huge proponent of using clown at high ranks, but a lot of people find him to not have enough map pressure to be viable. you need to end chases very quickly if you want to play him higher. it’s all about practice.
---
Yeah, I never understood that, it always confused me because why have a 1-perk when it’s in your base kit
---
I'm definitely not biased or anything, but he seems like a god among men.
---
They probably think your just smart and avoiding the DS x)
---
I literally forgot up the ante was even a perk.  It's even worse than open handed.
---
I mean repairing an accidental buff bug isn't a nerf per se
---
Hmm
---
Pair it with head on!
---
I love Steve so much but I only proc second wind once every 3ish matches :/
---
Funny you think I’m trying to create salt. I am simply stating that ghostface is the best in my opinion. Whereas you have dissed my character even though we all now that legion is just a rip off ghostface like clown is like penny wise but you think that just because I prefer one character to another I’m creating “salt”.
---
He does quite a bit, but I think it'll be pretty far until you hit that point. As you said, he helps against running in circles, which is commonly called "looping". As you rank up and play better survivors, not only will they get better at looping, they will also become more optimal, so generators ("gens") will also get done much faster. The Clown really struggles with stopping people from doing generators across the map ("map control"), which is his biggest weakness.
---
Glad you're enjoying the game! Let me know if you have more questions.
---
Didn’t Mettle get nerfed to hell?
---
Yep and while they do that, they screw the other survivors overs by doing shit like fast vaulting, gen exploding, and other shit which would get the killer's attention on purpose. 
---
I ran into a survivor the other day who did that. At first I thought this person was just a noob or something, (like me) but then when I saw this person juke the killer like 5-6 times and had been a chase for like 3 minutes while only getting hit once, I knew this person wasn't a noob.
---
Why is Lightburn still a thing on Wraith?
---
Yeah it's really sad it's like a lot of people I play with because I'm red ranked don't understand it's still a game to have fun. I played with a guy who literally ran no perks and could Loop a killer a whole match and the first time he gets caught he's ready to get off the game and stop playing. We're losing the fact that it is a game it's okay to be competitive but understand it's a game
---
Nah, he's pretty standard TbH.  
---
Spirit Fury and Enduring for the classic wombo combo or make your choice and pop goes the weasel for a more active pressured approach.
---
Best comment!
---
Yeah but it goes well with WGLF
---
They ran out of ways to nerf her so they made hidden buffs on her just to nerf those
---
Some guy was posting about a killer that has demon stuffed animals and the survivor version was him was a guy who made stuffed animals.. absurd lol
---
the cannibal is a powerful killer.
---
The difference Thanatophobia makes is so small it's negligible, even on killers that are centred around keeping the survivors injured, such as Plague and Legion.  
---
Here's how the maths look for generators when working with Thanatophobia:  
---
* One person injured = -4%  
---
80 / 0.96 = 83.333... seconds | This makes a difference of 3.333... seconds.  
---
* Two people injured = -8%  
---
80 / 0.92 = 86.957 seconds | This makes a difference of roughly 7 seconds.  
---
* Three people injured = -12%  
---
80 / 0.88 = 90.909... seconds | This makes a difference of roughly 11 seconds.  
---
* Four people injured = -16%  
---
80 / 0.84 = 95.238 seconds | This makes a difference of roughly 15 seconds.  
---
As you can see, just by looking at the maths, this perk is borderline useless. The *only* use you'll really get out of this is if you're looking to mind-game the survivors into healing, and tracking them with Nurse's Calling, but in that case you're banking on the survivors being, well, not very smart. Good survivors will just power through the laughably small effect that Thanatophobia has, and you'll essentially be playing with three perks.
---
What would you have done?
---
I guess so.
---
Brilliant, but i’d rather they iron out the bugs before working on anything else tbh.
---
The killers I fight turn 180 degrees and still hit me, they end up looking away from me as the animation ends
---
wraith has a shitty reach and coming out of concealment slows him down quite a bit. I try to get ahead of the survivor and let them run into me. it does feel like I am forced to tunnel more with Wraith than any other killer. good question!
---
Not been in the locker
---
I'm starting to wonder if we should call survivors who work with the killer to spare their own life as 69s
---
I end up behind them but they stil manage to hit me even though they're looking away from me
---
ugh the agitation though. I had an experienced survivor literally sabotage me. killer was on his ass on the other side of the map and he ran straight towards me while I was working on a gen. knew I was there too, literally ran right to the side I was on so the killer would go for me instead. I can't blame killers for tunneling when survivors sabotage their teammates on purpose.
---
I have 49 cakes on my legion still. I'm so ready. Hopefully I see a lot of farming groups for survivors!
---
I usually just tell them how camping is counter intuitive to the game and nets you less points.  Other than that they just get a gg from me.
---
Survivor mains: "omg why are killers so toxic"
---
Also survivor mains: *blinds me on their way out of the gate when I didn't camp or tunnel or anything the whole game*
---
:(
---
It discourages playing with large rank brackets yes of course, many many games do this already via restrictions. It could have been worse to look like this where only say ranks 1-5 6-11 12-16 and 17-20 could play with each other. 
---
And please, think, someone in the group is not gonna be like rank 4 while the other are rank 10, that's a completely ridiculous acusation.
---
Yeah but i personally dont get slugged much
---
Balanced Landing? Really?
---
I know. Killers have full movement during a lunge if they have sensitivity high they can 360 spin into a hit.
---
Being able to slow games down is so important for a lot of killers. Even if objectives get reworked in some way (gas cannisters/gen speed), I still think a lot of killers will run ruin or PGTW because longer games tend to favor the killer. Longer games -&gt; less pallets -&gt; easier chases.
---
Maybe, but until that happens I'll use my shards on things that have an immediate impact on gameplay
---
I switched to distortion a while back and I’ve been having better luck with BBQ&amp;C
---
Thank
---
Save the best for last is a good perk for him bc he can build stacks really quick also I’ve seen ppl run thanataphobia bc he can keep everyone injured
---
Legions really good at gaining points careless to if you kill anyone or not, good killer to have cake on.
---
The things dwight's do to survive
---
What was the leaks again legion,clown hag and plague?
---
Thanataphobia, Sloppy Butcher, Nurse's calling, Ruin or Save The Best For Last depending on what you prefer. Make it literally impossible to heal
---
In the end that would be a buff to killers. That's like forcing a weaker version of ruin to be base while allowing 4 other perks. I get the intent but in actuality it wouldn't be as good as you're thinking. Plus if they were not randomized, killers head to where canisters are and wait knowing they have to come get it.
---
You really haven't. This is just the truth.
---
When I see a ghostface teabagging me on a hook I laugh. When I see a bunch of survivors teabagging at the exit gate I laugh with an attitude 'go on get outa here you pesky kids'. If I see a survivor running and teabagging on the other side of a loop or pallet, I assess what I am doing wrong. Can I catch them? Should I leave them and zone the geny's? Instead of just getting angry, crying, letting some kid on the other end of the world upset me, then taking to reddit to complain about the toxicity people - who most likely are just having loads of fun.
---
I draw the line at communications abuse though. - even if it "GG EZ Baby killer" - That is toxic -  because you are going out of your way to intentionally and clearly mock someone. See the difference?
---
You think the game needs to change for you but really it is you who needs to change to enjoy the game.
---
Bruh i am rank 7 ma teammates r rank 17 killers rank is 3
---
Don't face camp or tunnel. When you do that, three other people are focused on gens. You have to apply pressure to everyone. If you camp and tunnel you'd be lucky to get 2 kills.
---
Demogorgonborgon
---
I want to apologize. I have been doing this with Steve, simply because I haven’t gotten BT on him yet. I just want to play my babysitter with great hair and I don’t have all the good perks on him yet
---
See Haddonfield, underground complex
---
I wanna comment but I don't want to sound mean so I wont
---
Yes. Lmao. Very few times but there's been a few times where I decided that person not escaping was more important than anything
---
I use to not use it a lot but lately since I've been stuck in low rank hell its useful just to know when the killer is definitely nearby or not.
---
I suggest legion. I think they are fun and I KNOW they get lots of BP.
---
Perks I suggest for BP are BBQ and Distressing. Distressing guarantees you max out Deviousness on Legion every game.
---
The other two are up to you, but do NOT run ruin. Ruin will make the game last longer which is normally a good thing, but not for farming. Its better to have a 10 minute match worth 20K BP than a 20 minute one worth 30K.
---
Run addons that increase duration and reduce cooldown of frenzy (the power guage, not the slow down after frenzy ends) . And obviously take BP boosting offerings.
---
Prioritize frenzy stabs and BBQ hooks. If you see someone you'e already hooked, frenzy them and use the Killer Instinct to find a new hook victim.
---
This can result in short, fun, salt-less games that give you loads of BP. You just gotta accept low-kill games. Good luck and have fun!
---
Good meme
---
ITS WHAT
---
That’s unfortunate
---
I quit the game in 2016 and come back to see ruin and bbq. I wouldve been so upset if i joined a week or two later
---
You're awesome, I didnt think I'd manage to get one. My psn name is tyguy9402 just whenever you're ready let me know I'm in no rush!
---
I’d buy it but that $50 price tag says oyherwise
---
The kid in the back is The Nurse who was chilling there the whole time waiting
---
I have a similar story to this. I was looting the basement chest when I saw him, I then looked straight at him for about 4 seconds. Guess what happened next?
---
A I deactivated his ability
---
B he exposed me and I got hooked in the basement
---
Secret pig buff this hotfix: The key has been removed from every jigsaw box
---
The obsession comes into play when a perk or addon designates a survivor as such. Depending on the perk in question, this could be a good or bad thing. Certain perks like Remember Me or Save The Best For Last could mean the killer is planning on using the obsession as leverage for the mid to late game. Other perks like Dying Light or Play With Your Food can also mean the same but the killer is going to actively avoid killing you first. 
---
Rancor means you’re gonna die at the end game and you should write a Last will. 
---
Other perks like Decisive Strike or Object of Obsession will mean the killer needs to play against your perk and may cause them to slug you or take you out first because you’re their obsession not by their choice. 
---
Lastly addons from Myers and Freddy can make you their obsession but there is less penalty for being the obsession there. It does not cause the killer to find you more easily or less easily by any means, however if you are the killer’s Obsession and you didn’t bring a perk to make it that way, be cautious of how the killer will interact with you.
---
I think the solution would be a more heavily weighted average.  The issue I have with averages is that 1. the rank resets happen frequently to arbitrarily lower someone's (who is good) rank, and 2. the total number of ranks is fairly low.  If there was an ELO that was maintained over time and we had 100 ranks...ok, skill estimates would be a lot closer to reality, but the current system doesn't do that.  As such, averaging a rank 1 + their "possibly decent, but doesn't play much so they have a lower rank 15" friend just doesn't work.  
---
I would propose that each color bucket you go up, the more weighted the average is towards them.  So a red+yellow rank would do something like 75% weighted towards red, and you'd end up with mid to high purples instead of a high green/low purple.  I think this accounts for the larger skill disparity and SWF benefits, while still accounting for the fact that not everyone is the same skill as the highest player.
---
in what universe is doing all 5 gens with all 4 of you alive then dying because of gates right next to each other fair?
---
Aftercare is better than bond. It takes some work to activate (either unhook or heal a survivor). But once you do - it has unlimited range and not only can you see your teammates but they can see YOU too.
---
It helps so much.
---
I’ll go ahead and send you an add so I can invite you later!
---
Ty
---
My internet or connection randomly dies for one second or something. It happens with no other games and I'm not kicked off of Xbox live so my internet isn't down, but it just says 'a connection is required to play' and I'm like "I AM CONNECTED." It's so fucking obnoxious
---
I see a lot of people run that build and I must say it's pretty effective
---
Good post! I liked the bit on tunneling. As a killer I’m gonna go after the quickest and easiest hook. If I happen to run into the person who just got unhooked, sorry, that’s why you bring ds.
---
Facecamping is purposely ruining the game for 1 person because you don't have enough faith in yourself to get another kill.
---
Also you get way less points facecamping 1 person than you would hitting all 4 and them all escaping. So yeah, it's pointless.
---
You don't really need distressing on doc if you go out of your way to shock all the survivors to madness 3.  It's easy enough to hit the cap
---
and why does they get angry about the noed i dont get angrya bout decicve strike
---
Because this type of survivors thinks they always have to win against the killer and you should be their servant
---
It seems I’ve forgotten about stuff like that, I was just thinking about points flat out rather than total that you can get just off one survivor, thank you for pointing out my mistake

Eventually you will be able to handle all of the survivors jukes and you won't feel like you need to face camp.  The survivors that talk trash in the match results screen are entitled survivor mains who aren't good enough to face againced 4 people instead they decide to hide behind their good friends and bully the killer.  The best thing to do is just don't get into it in the chat or dms, they want you to get angry.  If a game dosent go your way and your feeling helpless (which happens to everyone) just take a break.  Skill will come in time.  Also noed gets a bad rap use whatever perks or addons you want, the game already favors the survivors massively.
---
Honestly this would actually be a cool concept, but it wouldn't really make sense as far as flashlight blinds, DS, etc goes.
---

---
I always thought boiled over was a bad perk but see a decent amount of people run it. It doesnt speed up your wiggle meter, just seems to counter iron grasp unless I misunderstand both perks.
---
They have made it exactly as it should be. I am telling you, a Rank 7 Killer compared to a Rank 3 Killer are completely and entirely different beasts. Rank 1-4s will still be able to run rings around that killer with ease. This will mean that the higher rank survivor will get infinitely longer chases against weaker killers when they are SWF. 
---
Like I said in one of my posts, it is completely and utterly irrelevant that the killer should do something different, how does he know what he should do against higher ranks? He needs to play against his rank, not rank 20s, not ranks 1-4. He needs to face his actual rank and let him rank and derank as normal. If you are failing to see that for the health of both veteran and new players on killer or survivor, this is the healthiest state that the game can be in.
---
As a side note, with the amount of abuse new killers are getting from highly ranked survivors when they do this shit, the only way to rout that BS out is to make the high rankers face their level of killer. This will stop their toxic bs because someone is new to the game. Regardless of whether you and your friends or anyone else's are not toxic towards the new killer, they learn nothing by being stomped and ran around by people like you with the addition of you having tons of survivor perks FOR FREE when you play SWF. This was a necessary change.
---
Red rank survivors mostly just fuck around and do dumb shit to each other. Killer at red ranks is easier than killer at purple or green ranks imo. That's where the survivors are sweaty because they want to rank up.
---
I swear my friend tried trapper for the first time before he really played a lot and did awesome. All 4 survivors were trapped at once, every icon was trapped and he was like "...what? Is that rare?" And I was like "I'm convinced you main trapper and are lying. That is insane."
---
Franklin's Demise sounds hilarious on Legion, but I haven't tried it yet.
---
Personally I like to run Spies From Shadows, since it's a great way to find a survivor to start chaining hits, and most people don't expect you to run this perk.
---
Discordance is a great base perk too.
---
Killer mains also hit you at exit gate too ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
I was just using it for extra bloodpoints and that extra radius of shock, I enjoy it for sneaking up on generators and watching them scream and run, easy to track them. What would you use instead?
---
I hate being THAT killer but fuck you the least you can do is make it easy for me
---
You literally said "don't even @ me". And how is Legion a copy of Ghostface. Next thing youre gonna say is Michael is a copy of Ghostface?
---
I'm sure we all know the feeling the other day I had to go up against a demo and thanks to Spine Chill I sprint bursted away into a locker multiple times. Of course people usually don't check lockers so I get away with it sometimes.
---
Welcome
---
Don't worry about people complaining about noed its like when killers complain about decisive strike or other perks some people just think of it as an op perk that can't be negated even though it can and now with inner strength it should be negated a lot
---
You can be hit with Ds if you don't tunnel even with the changes it just means you can only use Ds after first hook not two Downs in a row idk how they would even do that. I have hooked someone at the start and got dsed by the same person on their second hook when I had 2 dead already and they dsed me. This was after the changes to it
---
My favorite was when it wasn't your fault and you got sandbagged and camped then called a disgrace
---
**The best thing they could do is just remove survivors ability to see boxes**
---
No, have you ever been a victim of a reverse bear trap that shit takes time to remove and the first box attempt won't remove the trap usually requiring a second box attempt to completely remove the trap.
---
I would advocate buffing pig's current teachable over that anyday also Freddy Kruger and the Puke lady also have this style of gameplay so removing visual indicators would be incredibly obnoxious.
---
Because they don't understand
---
.... that's a little toxic...
---
snoozefest
---
I love that at the reveal everyone were excited saying stuff like they were gonna drop their main to main Steve etc. Then their perks get revealed and everyone changed to wanting to main Nancy. I'm proud to be on team Nancy since the reveal
---
I'd say personally I've got a P3 claudette and A P1 Ace and I feel I get more ultra rares on the claudette than the other characters but for Ace it feels almost the same as normal. You'd probably need to get it up to P2 or P3 to tell the difference unless I'm just really unlucky on Ace.
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
Probably a nurse hiding behind the gate you didn't open or basement protector..or AFK
---
Reality check on reddit, you are the social butterfly aren’t you😂too funny you are
---
The idea is to keep them off gens, If you hook a person odds are 1-2 of them will get off a gen to rescue him/her. You can use this time to find the guy still on a gen while they heal up and repeat. There's a perk to slow progress for each person hurt which encourages them to heal-thus buying time
---
Franklin's demise on him is so hilarious
---
Hitting someone at the exit gate is considered toxic, now?
---
Whenever I play survivor I usually chill at the exit zone so the killer can get a little bit more bp for another hit/down.
---
&gt;  i dont get angrya bout decicve strike
---
Decisive strike is punishing you for bad play, there is no reason to be angry at it.
---
If you want to be angry about some passive bullshit that procs endgame - be angry about Adrenaline.
---
DS exists to stop people tunneling one guy, if your getting hit with it a lot you need to rethink your playstyle.
---
I’m new to the game so I didn’t know crouch spamming was teabagging (since it’s not like halo where you’re literally teabagging their body), and there’s no other way to communicate to the killer or other survivors in a positive way to show you’re just having fun, and everyone is so sensitive they take it as a disrespect smh
---
David. Gotta get those we're gonna farm forever stacks.
---
im pretty sure i said i started facecamping when i hit rep 12 mate
---
Why corner? I'd derank by playing killers I suck at but if I did do that I'd stand in front of one gate lever and block it
---
If all 3 survivors and the killer are around the downed snitch, they can take part in a group mori for 3k each.
---
This is a painful recreation of going up against extremely good survivors who are basically impossible to catch
---
Because the entire playstyle is hit and chase
---
Discussion is an inaccurate way of putting it.
---
Sounds like one
---
I like legion, they're fun to play for me, and I enjoy the fast pace of their games, I'm just not too good with timing frenzy and hooking, what perks would you use on legion? I've been running thanotophobia, Ruin, BBQ and Remember me, but I guess I'm really going for kills and slowing the game down more than I am bloodpoints with this build.
---
Played the game when if first released and never got into it, though I like watching it, still frequent this sub daily though.
---
There’s 7 gens (7 canisters) and 5 gens to do. If survivors see a killer camping one they can just find another one. They wouldn’t be able to camp them without wasting a ton of time, it’s pointless. The only way to stop them would be to smack them or down them depending on what would be best.
---
On some maps. Oh boy Billy on the new map is F tier lmao
---
Answer me coward
---
Well distressing doesn't really help you, in fact it makes finding survivors harder believe it or not.
---
It takes a long time for them to go from madness 1 to madness 2 without you manually shocking them, so unless you use the add ons to increase their madness gain from the aura, you're better off with a smaller terror radius.
---
Think of it this way, you go to treatment mode, someone screams, you begin to chase/shock.etc, in that situation smart survivors will find you just to get the scream of tier one out of the way so you won't be able to find them later on in the match.
---
On my doctor I generally use Ruin, BBQ, Pop Goes the Weasel, and Make your Choice.  MyC can be easily substituted for sloppy butcher, or if the lobby has 3 or more items, Franklins Demise.  For add ons I use a shock range extension add on (the electrodes) and then a Discipline (the add on that increases the amount of madness gained from shock).  I prefer farming with this build over legion.
---
Her face, like she's proud of what she did lol
---
I have only gotten hawkins with billy. It suuuuucks
---
Awesome thanks again, I just realized my psn was set to not get friend requests so if you tried and it didnt work it should now!
---
Imagine an actual robo killer tho
---
Totally wrong. Depends on what killer you are playing. I main pig and once I hook someone, I just crouch and hide next to/behind the hook, easy second kill.
---
That’s really good
---
This is exactly what they did bro
---
My fav build with Legion is third seal, pop goes the weasel, nurses, and coulrophobia. Could remove nurses or coulrophobia if you \*really\* feel like you need bbq or ruin, but as someone who never runs ruin (survivors find it took quick and most can hit hex checks anyway so it's just a wasted perk slot), I can promise you, so long as you apply pressure correctly, and not committing to chases that will waste your time, you'll do fine. BBQ is always fine tho if you're looking to grind up BP, otherwise I don't use it much.
---
Before someone says, "YoU nEeD rUiN iN rEd RaNkS": No. I am red ranks. I average 3k's without it.
---
Congratulations, you're a camper. Want a cookie?
---
I was not defending that bullshit. I meant that the devs saying that the exit gates being too close resulting in your death is your fault because you could not get the hatch is dumb. If the killer is fast and has NOED then there really is no hope. Not everyone has keys.
---
It's 2x Blood points on the 26th
---
Meanwhile I'm frantically trying to get that tier 3 BBQ on Bubba but it just. won't. show. up. in. my. bloodweb.
---
I was about to say at least Crotus Penn has the fucked up building but then I remembered the fucked up building is good for survivors and just, what the hell is up with Crotus Penn.
---
Good suggestions, but idk about surge personally. It only applies on m1 hits, and I find I shred people down way more often than not.
---
Pop Goes the Weasel is really good on demo because of his map pressure. It may be worth looking at as an alternative.
---
I have an issue with them putting perks available on base game Survivors/Killers. We have too many perks now, and more on the way, to waste a week on Perks we can easily get with blood points.
---
**I"M SICK OF CLAUDETTES BEING THE WORST TYPES OF TEAMMATES JUST CROUCHING AROUND THE CORNER AND CAN'T EVEN USE SPINE CHILL PROPERLY! DOING GENS U?**
---
You really couldn't make it any more obvious that you've never played a Bloodhunt in DBD before.
---
I was hoping for a ghostface to slowly lean in, but that works too.
---
Only gaming subreddit with spicier memes is r/Mordhau imo.
---
Depends on factors: were they a jerk? Were the teammates good or awful? Did lag help me down them? Is the gamertag cool?
---
😱😱😱
---
"you wouldn't have won without NOED!brbbrrtrfjoji"  yeah but I still won.  I can't wait until I get ruin
---
No...I'm just saying that for some killers it's a viable strategy. I rarely have more than one person leave when I play pig/do that. Survivors need to get over themselves. I dont get mad when people use divicive strike/ stand at the hook and block it. It's all strategy
---
Then the killer hooks a survivor that didn’t make it to the gate and blood warden activates
---
I agree.
---
I’d recommend getting the lower tier perks in that case since their odds of appearing are greater than tier 3 perks
---
Well I do play with my low level friends but because they’re friends not to be toxic and bully a low level killer. I know a lot of people do that but I wouldn’t ruin someone’s gaming experience just to get a cheap win. With how fucked matchmaking has been lately I’m rank 3 and I’ve been matched up agains like rank 15-20s and I’ve given them the kill at the end of the game because I feel that bad. I’m not complaining about the update because I want to be a dick to others I just want to play with my friends.
---
No. Double bp is just double bp
---
Spine Chill is my information perk. For new inexperienced it tells them to get off a gen.
---
Experienced players use it to avoid surprises, locate a killer's position and intention, tell if another survivor is being chased, give concrete info on the Spirit's location/husk, tell which direction the Nurse will blink, tell which add-ons/perks the killer uses and tons of the other applications.
---
I love it for the fact that it acts as a 6th sense in-game and the survivors that use it must use their intuition to determine what it means. I have strong intuition so I don't need tons of concrete information to figure out what Spine Chill means in different scenarios.
---
Crotus prenn was even more fucked up on release, I'm talking all pallets spawn and both windows open.
---
good game man always camp let those swf losers rage quit
---
dont worry about ranks always camping its a good strategy to get kills
---
let them come to you instead go and find them
---
That's that the meme is tho
---
Thank you for verifying 👍
---
Honest to god who gives a shit? Whenever I play killer I just hook everyone, since if you really wanted to let the last survivor escape, who cares if they wiggle off? Never made sense to me why killers claim they’re nice for letting the last survivor have hatch but then throw a tantrum when the survivor wiggles for 0.01 seconds. They can find the hatch/open the gate faster if they themselves are running in addition to you searching, and if you know where the hatch is you just have to corral them towards it.
---
If you’re not gonna let them find the hatch with you, just kill them and stop wasting their time since believe it or not people don’t just want to sit and watch themselves get carried around, no one cares about the chump change you get from escaping through hatch.
---
No problem :)
---
P3 Blendette: Wazaaaaaaaa-
---
Ghostface: This, bitch.
---
IM SO PISSED OFF, YESTERDAY I GOT FACECAMPED BY A HAG WHO WAS RANK 8. SHE PUT ALL OF HER TRAPS ON ME AND NO ONE WAS DOING GENS!! MY DEATH WAS ALL FOR NOTHING
---
Very true. I mainly say surge because Surveillance shows you up to three gens &amp; surge can regress up to three gens if they are really close together so it does the job for you but I definitely understand what you’re saying &amp; it’s a good alternative.
---
Dread it.
---
Run from it.
---
You won’t learn to beat rep 12 players if you stick to one tactic the whole time, you’ll win some and lose some but if you keep trying to play normally and just patrol you’ll learn to counter rep 12’s
---
Pretty much. They don’t realize you have to lose at some point. You can’t perfect the entirety of this game without being Young D’Arby.
---
6IX9INE would just be ratting everyone out
---
The killer's aura is almost never revealed.  
---
Only certain survivor perks do it, and I think the only one that the killer has that reveals where they are is rancor?
---
I play 50/50 survivor and killer and have to say it really feels like you get it from both sides. Running certain survs will get you tunneled most games. It’s like people only want you to play certain survivors without certain perks.
---
If you level it to level 3 that is, which is a bad idea on most killers like spirit, nurse, freddy
---
This is another reason why I love the Gorgon because you can plant portals at the gates and triverse into the Upside Down and go into the portals to  gate guardian them, its really cool!
---
Dude it's brutal
---
Biggest advice I can give is to stop worrying about kills.
---
No, seriously.
---
You're still learning right now, so your personal focus should be on just practicing and playing games. If you can get into that mindset, you'll be able to ignore salty survivors and tbaggers.
---
It's fine if they get away now, you'll improve and crush them later. Just focus on learning from each game and practicing.
---
The game takes a lot of map knowledge to play well, and that just comes with time. Give yourself permission to suck now so you can learn what you need to.
---
Hope that helps! Can't wait to see you improve.
---
:/
---
Then they proceed to dc
---
yeah i was planing to ask about this are they expecting me to leave when i see shit ton of scratch marks around me?
---
I'm just glad I wasn't playing huntress.
---
Old habits did hard
---
so basically you could use rancor and get the aura of 2 survivors who had nothing to do with it? and how would object work? doesn’t seem very fair :|
---
xaxaxaxaaxaxaxa
---
shit forreal man
---
Well it isnt a bad idea per se, its just that they can benefit from MYC lvl1
---
Someone watches a lot of "toxic" streamers and found out it's not as easy to get away with being a shit lord as it looks on stream.
---
For serious games I like to run: Ruin, Sloppy Butcher, Thanotophobia, and any intel perk (usually discordance).
---
For farming/fun: BBQ, Distressing, Save the Best for Last, and Discordance.
---
I should add that I forgot about discordance in the first post. Super good for farming on legion and in general.
---
This advice only helps those who only enjoy camping hooks. It’s ok to run from the hook to find others if you notice the survivors don’t bombard the hook the moment you hook them or the moment you leave it. Even then, that hooked player hen rescued has one less hook phase left and has to be healed to avoid your mighty swing bringing them down should you find them again.
---
Since your OP I’ll give you a pass
---
You say that like it is a bad thing
---
Time to get pumped, play 5 games, and then get annoyed at everyone!
---
Hah
---
I DIDN'T THINK MATCHMAKING COULD TAKE ANY LONGER BUT AFTER THE PATCH IT LITERALLY TOOK ME AND MY FRIENDS 45 MINUTES TO ALL GET IN THE SAME MATCH TOGETHER AND THEN AN EBONY MORI ENDED US ALL. SO FUN!
---
Pretty sure my man.
---
Or he would be legion 2.0 and have a crazy mode
---
And now I just want a killer who's power is controlling people and can force survivors into doing stuff like that.
---
Or a killer that makes puppets out of dead survivors who follow behind or patrol like broken golems screaming when people get near.
---
My teammate also wasn’t coming to save me
---
True true. It sounds like a good combo on killers in general! I actually haven't considered it before and may give it a shot later. Ty!
---
I'm literally waiting for Ruin to be in shrine so I can tilt more survivors, can't wait.
---
1. People enjoy Nurse because she is pretty damn strong, and it feels awesome when you hit that 100% accurate blink on top of a injured survivor  
---
2. PX (x = number) is the Prestige level of your character, everytime you hit Lvl 50, you get the option to Prestige, which gives you a Bloodied cosmetic and resets you character back to Lvl 1, a P3 is someone who has the 3 levels of their Prestige  
---
3. A Pip is the game's ranking system, you need X pips to Rank Up and get paired with people with similar ranks, in a match you can get at maximum 2 Pips, thats why people say "I double pipped" because they got 2 Pips towards their Rank Up  
---
4. Some people don't feel like playing against a certain killer (Nurses and Spirits get more DCs than Wraiths and Pigs), some people DC because of bad plays (not looping correctly and DCing because of it) and some people just DC just because they got pissed.  
---
5. Survivors "look down" on Perks that help the killer, because if the perk helps the killer, its bad for the survivors, so if someone uses NOED for example, the Survivors are going to get mad for the killer using a perk that helps him in the EndGame  
---
6. Survivors are fully cosmetic, but all characters have their own stereotypes (Claudettes play Stealthly, Neas are Toxic, Dwights are Newbies, etc.) but if someone said "oh look at this Claudette",  maybe she did a dumb/smart play, maybe they didn't notice her hidding or something, and some people also don't like some characters (the way they look and sound)
---
Well you aren't fucked, you just don't sneak against that person, but it essentially feels bad in the early game, yeah. In the lategame tho OoO will screw the user because there is little safety when pallets are broken, so you just M1 their ass an that's it.
---
I would honestly love a "Shard Hunt" event where you don't necesarily get 2x Shards but rather complete a series of daily quests just like the daily rituals but harder and for example, one completed quest would award you something close to 600 shards or more.
---
Balanced Landing is the best exhaustion perk in game, change my mind.
---
This is me with ghost face but this is amazing
---
You clearly didn't get the point, my dude.
---
Ok so you can 3 gen strat off the start with canisters since they aren't randomized and with 7 on smaller maps they'll be close enough to 3 gen
---
I think it’s just mutual blood point farming. Survivors get protection hits and flashlight stubs and the killer gets some more brutality
---
Depends on what context, you do make a good point but my bias only starts when everyone is 2 hooked, if my friend is 2 hooked and the rand is 1 hooked I’ll go for the rand, if the rand is 2 hooked and my friend is 1 hooked, I’ll go for my friend, pretty simple stuff.
---
My in game bias is when my friend is last hook, I refuse to kill them under any circumstances, all that means is I move on and look for someone else, what I have figured in this debate however is that at the end of the day (assuming there isn’t a key) it is impossible for the rands to get hatch which admittedly is pretty unfair, please don’t crucify me for having an opinion but you know what else is denying a survivor hatch? Slugging for the 4K, both of which are scummy yet still fair play (IMO), make what you will of this last point but I doubt you’ll care (no one ever does)
---
Bon appetite motherfucker
---
he's probably in stealth mode, cant get bloodlust when using your power c;
---
IF YOU DON'T HAVE BORROWED TIME DON'T UNHOOK ME WHEN THE KILLER IS DIRECTLY BEHIND YOU AND SLASHED ME THE SECOND YOU FUCKING UNHOOK ME JESUS H CHRIST
---
I was waiting to see if I didn’t have to use my key you moron
---
If I’m injured and near the hook, I’m gonna rescue and then take the down, otherwise I’d prob get Down and then that’s two people on hook
---
The canister would appear on your screen as being picked up but you wouldn’t physically carry it, it would appear before picking it up on the ground and appear on the ground after being smacked by the killer. You would keep your item in your hand. Either that or you could carry an item in one hand and a canister in the other. Depends how the devs would go about it. The current ruin with this mechanic would make James hell for lower level survivors, hence why i suggested a rework.
---
People project feelings from previous games onto new killers/ survivors.
---
This isn't the type of game where you show the upmost respect to the other side. Not saying that respect in not welcome. But you can't think you are entitled to the other side being a 'good guy'.
---
Balanced's passive is what makes it so good, but I still think that Dead Hard's effect is better, as it's possible to trigger it whenever and wherever, and as long as a loop is close, dead hard can be used for distance, making it uncounterable. Running to the exit but the killer will \*just\* catch you? Dead hard can save you. Playing against trapper and he's forced you into an area with a trap? Just dead hard over it! Saving with BT but you had to get hit first? Dead Hard the hit so BT is procced instead of you going down! There are so many more uses for DH, and it can be used as long as you are injured, giving a much wider set of uses as well. BL is just so map dependent, and you'll be completely screwed if you end up on shelter woods or didn't get a hill spawn where you're looping.
---
Like a survivor blowing up a gen? Or messing up a healing skill check? Fast Vaulting through a window? Getting stalked by MM? &gt;.&gt;" I think you're being a bit too strict but having it randomly select players is a half baked idea, Instead it could reveal the aura of the player whom proc'd "The Abyss stares back" and anyone within a 5 meter radius?
---
When you’re trying to save your key it does
---
JUST HAD A GAME YESTERDAY WHERE I EARNED JUST SHY OF 31K (BEFORE BONUSES) AND ALL 4 PLAYERS ESCAPED. YOU REALLY CAN EARN ALMOST MAX BP EVERY GAME AS KILLER IF THATS ALL YOURE AFTER
---
That is true, they have a major difference in play style and what they excel at. But what about clown? I love the clown, but I think wraith is higher on the tier list than him.
---
The demogorgon is easily the best killer for bp. He gets 200 per portal placed, 50 for travelling from portal to portal and 800 for hitting a survivor with shred.
---
Maybe that will come with the archive or whatever it’s called :D
---
*shows alot of bloodpoints*
---
"Show up to school tomorrow"
---
Yup, also it is because usually it is not worth it to do anything. the whole thing behind a lawsuit is that is hurting you or your bussiness. a hotdog stand named "mickey's" in a city where there is not even a disney land is not doing any damage to Disney's income not claiming ownership or anything like that of the character, so they just let it be.
---
I suppose it fallas in a dark area nobody cares about.
---
Play how you like, if the hate mail gets boring just disable messages from strangers
---
Always happy to farm. And plus some of them are just there for dailies
---
MOST OF THE TIME AS KILLER IT'S EASY TO TELL WHO'S DOING IT TO BE AN ASSHOLE AND WHO'S DOING IT FOR POINTS BY LOOKING AT ENDGAME CHAT AND SEEING THEM TYPE EZ BABY KILLER OR NOT FUCK
---
Normally you would, but there are some builds and situations where even that's not good enough. Entirely situational though.
---
I'm one of them.
---
Not the farming type but more like the friendly type.
---
If I encounters survivors that struggle a lot but they're playing fair and not being toxic I actually leave 2 of them alive and guide them to the exit.
---
It feels warm and fuzzy to have the survivors thank you after the match :)
---
The puke spin at the end is the icing on the cake. I loved it! xD
---
I PLAY ON PS4 WITH NO ENDGAME CHAT! RIP ME!!!
---
No, just ignore them unless they're purposely screwing their teammates
---
I said unknowingly. you know if someone fails a skill check or fast vaults. you wouldn’t know if ur teammate has alert or something, and you don’t know if ur aura is being tracked without distortion. I think if ur gonna go with 2 aura readings, it would have to be the 2 players who read the killers aura. and if the survivor who saw the 2 auras was the same then it’s just on them.
---
Then those* but it's not like I'm looking to make a crappy perk that just sets the meta and ruins the game for being too strong, I'd rather think of balanced perks with interactivity. Maybe it could replace one of those tbh
---
I believe not. Only from trials.
---
i didn't even know demogorg muffled the scream of the survivor when bitting their face. That's so cool
---
IF YOU WAIT AT THE DOOR JUST STANDING THERE THEN I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOURE DOING BUT IF YOU TEABAG ITS JUST BAD MANNERS.
---
I didn't say you did. Just keeping the conversation balanced. The same reasons people complain about NOED apply to adrenaline and keys as well.
---
I can't stand farming, I'm here to play the game and earn my points the normal way.  Not a fan of getting picked up over and over again to wiggle off. to mac out my points.
---
69 upvotes. Nice.
---
Yeah I bet! I always feel really bad whenever I kill everyone or have games where I kill everyone super early. Sadly my internet is out right now or I'd get on my ps4 right now and chill with people as demogorgon lol
---
he have a point
---
Woof.
---
I love the idea. I still have no clue as to why they buffed ruin. If they wanted to slow the game down for killers they should have created another mechanic like this. The current ruin makes it hwll of low rank survivors, and I feel the devs are catering to changes for high rank survivors.
---
Thanks for this, the first post already has me laughing
---
doesn't really feel like a "saw" death
---
Wraith would be amazing if they removed the shimmer effect he had when cloaked. like what's the point of cloaking besides the increased movement speed IF I SHIMMER LIKE A DAMN DISCO BALL
---
Yeah I feel you. It's a very boring method to earn points and sometimes I feel like it actually gives you less points than just playing the game normally.
---
*you’ve been hit by*         
---
*you’ve been struck by*          
---
*truck*            
---
           
---
#YAAOOOO!
---
Very true!
---
"I got my stacks, I've already won. Do with me what you will"
---
fuc
---
That’s interesting I wonder if they changed the time they load in.
---
Yeah that’s definitely what I first thought of
---
Legit I'm sitting here at rank 4 like.. wait your games last longer than 4 mins? Lol
---
No doubt, if he could get a slight buff at all I’d be happy! If they removed the shimmer I wouldn’t have any complaints about him.
---
EXACTLY!!!! YOU DONT EVEN HAVE TO LET THEM ESCAPE TO HAVE A GG FOR EVERYONE JUST DONT TUNNEL AND CAMP LIKE FUCK WHY ARE YOU EVEN PLAYING
---
That’s what I was implying at the end of my post, learning from this, unfortunately I haven’t gotten anything out of these replies constructive other than “it’s bannable and scummy so don’t do it” but I did give myself mixed thoughts on one thing that really affects the gameplay.
---
- What I am doing is similar to slugging for the 4K but without the slugs, it’s theoretically impossible for rands to escape my lobbies through hatch without a key, just like slugging for the 4K I said it as fair play yet scummy so I really don’t know what it comes down to because of what I do is bannable slugging for the 4K should be too (which it shouldn’t be btw)
---
lol how would wraith be better than clown? clown can completely deny loops, and any killer with exhaustion add ons lower rarity than green cannot be overlooked lol. I may be biased but how good a killer is is completely based on skill of the player imo, and clown had a much higher skill cap than wraith.
---
Matchmaking is still broke im rank 4 playing with purple rank friends and we get matched against green and yellow rank killers
---
Generation Z detected.
---
yeah bad meme. don't patronize and generalize killers just for the sake of being toxic, without them we have no game, and with more stuff like this, the less they like survivors so in turn the more toxic they get
---
I have 24 of these left!
---
yes they used to get free unhooks
---
dont give them
---
hit the survivor who tries to unhook dont bother with the hooked he will have borrowed time
---
hook they new survivor and wait for the other to come and replay the same thing over and over
---
u will get at least 2 kills with that stategy
---
The Forums
---
Mine is sitting at level 1 where he will forever stay :(
---
You’ve just given me a counter argument, tunneling isn’t bannable, scummy, but not bannable ._.
---
(This isn’t my full argument btw just a quick thought)
---
"Oh shit, why am i exposed"
---
I get it. I do. I’m not saying it’s the right thing to do. But I’m trying to explain the mind set of people who dc or kill themselves against a facecamper. I play games to have fun, and relieve stress after a long day. The last thing I wanna do is spend about 5 minutes being chased and tunneled by a killer go down to no Ed, and be 1 hooked by a facecamping killer. It’s a waste of time and I’d rather spend the time I have not being stressed. It’s not for any toxic reason.
---
I’ve never lost any offerings unless everyone has loaded into the map and then the killer DCs. If they disconnect before loading the item is back in my inventory.
---
have you tried playing with friends? this game is much more fun with friends. I remember the first time I got this, I befriended some randoms and we had fun crapping our pants together (when we were still fairly new as survivors) but then life happened. I had no other people to play with and it got boring for me.
---
&gt; What are your thoughts on people who play Killer to have fun
---
Describe what "fun" is for you. In my mind I play to have fun and I'd like to think my gamestyle is fun for survivors too. But my ultimate goal is still 4k.
---
Killers will hit you when they know you are on the very edge, meaning when you go down you will escape.
---
They do it for the bloodpoints, which is fine but survivors are also only flashlightning you for the same reason. It's not "Rubbing it into your nose" it's for bloodpoints.
---
No it's not the same as teabagging at all - One has a very clear toxic message, the other is a gameplay mechanic that gives points.
---
Thank god
---
Serious Sam as survivor
---
His perk grant you the ability to punch the killer  pick up the killer's weapon and use it against them (Works with Billy's Chainsaw and Bubba's chainsaw too)
---
Hitting the killer 4 times would kill them and the match would automatically be won by the survivors
---
The Oval should have a number in it, that is the players rank currently. The picture underneath it is a skull with a 1,2,3 and that tells you their prestige rank with said character. The higher the prestige number the more ‘experienced’ that player is with that character. Hope that helps!
---
I'm kinda split about that Dwight cosmetic. It's good, but not 1080 auric cells good.
---
lmao
---
At Red Ranks you don't get much friendly killers, so i doesn't really matter how bad of a day i'm having, a Friendly/Farming killer will ALWAYS calm me down, because it's really nice to just chill, get some bloodpoints and not having to worry about a sweaty Nurse main trying to slap everyone down in the first 5 seconds, Kudos to friendly killers
---
Doctor isn't a low tier killer just sayin
---
Dead hard also exists
---
IT IS PRETTY ANNOYING THOUGH AS A KILLER WHEN YOU PLAY WELL, GET 8 HOOKS, 30K BP, AND ALL 4 SURVIVORS ESCAPE AND YOU DEPIP.
---
I THINK IF I HAD A NEAR PERFECT SCORE I SHOULD GAIN A MOTHERFUCKING PIP.
---
No problem! I hope it goes well. ^•^
---
The hardest choices require the strongest wills
---
I’m not trying to start an argument! And I agree that clown has a much higher skill cap :3
---
I hardly use any addons whatsoever, so I was thinking in terms of the basic kit. Wraith just has a little more map pressure IMO, between two killers than have near no map pressure. I just think wraiths ability to catch unprepared survivors off guard is a little better is all! 
---
But I’m saying these are facts, I still respect your opinion.
---
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE AN ASSHOLE, BUT IF EVERYONE IS OUT, JUST LEAVE. UNLESS ITS MY LAST GAME OF THE DAY, AND HOW WOULD YOU KNOW THAT, I'M GOING TO GET MORE BLOOD POINTS IF I JUST QUEUE INTO THE NEXT GAME. ESPECIALLY BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES I'M ALREADY CAPPED ON THE CATEGORIES YOU'RE TRYING TO "HELP" ME WITH.
---
Yeah. I really like both worlds because too much of one thing really gets boring after a while. Farming bloodpoints with killers isn't exactly fun but it's a nice break from the sweat and toxicity I agree.
---
I hate the doctor because stealth is such an important part of the game, and he can largely ignore it. Between shocking and madness tiers, he's like a walking BBQ &amp; Chili. He's not OP, but he's my least favorite killer to play against (even great Nurses are more fun).
---
I think i’ve only done it once but it was like the worst player and he sat on a wooden wall corner (where totems can spawn) and i zoomed on top of him and sat there
---
I enjoy it when a killer has fun instead of killing everyone as soon as possible. I played against the trapper and I got caught in (no joke) every single trap he put down. And instead of being a douche he walked up to me, made his character shake his head in shame of me and letting me struggle before picking me up.
---
I have 4 pages of perks on Demogorgon, still no bbq
---
THOSE GOD DAMN TEABAGGERS. WHY CAN'T WE ALL BE NICE?
---
That's a great idea. I didn't think about the terror radius increase for his frenzy.
---
Dammit, basically Young D’Arby’s stand steals your soul when you lose. If you yourself know deep inside, your soul, that you lose, he takes your soul before the game ends because you admitted defeat technically. His stand also sort of allows him to cheat by asking your soul questions it can only answer truthfully, but luckily can only say “yes” or “no”. Jotaro wins by getting Joseph to use his stand to play the game in secret instead of Jotaro, and Jotaro would essentially circumvent Young D’Arby’s stand by being it’s question target instead of Joseph. Will you use a fast ball? Yup, (but I’m not the one playing, and you don’t know that) is a good example.
---
At the end, Darby begs for forgiveness, Jotaro says to read their souls for the answer and well... you can guess what star platinum, Jotaro’s stand, one of the powerful stands, that beats the shit out of you and can (more important than Darby SPOILERS) decides to do.
---
Balanced, as all things should be
---
It'd be great, but BHVR would never do it because it'd make them less money.
---
You’ll forgive me for it though, yeah? Yeah? Yeah? *visibly scared*
---
Rip please don’t be offended by my ignorance.
---
I mean, as a person who’s played survivor ever I would. that would be insane with the silent bell. not to mention, they’d have to make it so he can’t pull while invisible otherwise he could gen grab easier than spirit with prayer beads.
---
WELL TBH I DO IT FOR GREED AS WELL. I GET A FEW HUNDRED POINTS FROM "CHASE" "PROTECTION" AND "ESCAPED" SO ITS FOR ALL OUR BENEFITS
---
Again. No one is against it being killer favored.
---
What is being discussed is it being killer favored in the extreme. There is no justification for a rank 2 killer where the average rank of SWF is 13.
---
30 minute queues, short games, and more casual survivors instantly having their game end is not fun for anyone.
---
others have said it, but you're not going to learn how to beat anyone better than you if you just stop trying the second it gets hard. also, i hate to break it to you, but rank really means nothing - it's more just an example of how much you play, not actual skill. if it were a matter of skill, i know plenty of red rank killers &amp; survivors who wouldn't be in red ranks - and vice versa for some lower ranked people.
---
Because you're contradicting
---
Ghostface hands down. I wish he still used a cellphone though.
---
BHVR is the developer/company that made Dead by Daylight. Nerf is when said developers make an aspect of a game worse because they think it is too strong
---
Dark Sense just got a buff too, you see the Killer's aura after every completed gen.
---
I CAN'T SEE MY FOREHEAD
---
Wraith &gt; leatherface
---
I'm not sure why you're trying to correct my grammar when it was correct, weird flex but okay.
---
Well, by 'fun' I kind of meant whatever you enjoy. In your case you seem to enjoy simply playing the game and getting kills. Others like to farm or help out survivors that may be having a bad game such as if someone DC's super early you might let someone get hatch for example. I'm not sure, I guess I could've worded the question a bit better lol
---
Too bad pigs abilities don’t thrive on tunneling and she’s a shit tier list killer now anyway
---
I just wanna say this, wouldn't we wanna replace Demo with Spirit? Just a question because I personally don't consider demo to be a stealth killer.
---
Idk how to feel with friendly killers cuz i'm a killer main i just play the game and have fun
---
&gt;Survivor comes to unhook you.
---
&gt;Give them a kick which stuns for 2 seconds.
---
&gt;Killer simply picks them up in this state.
---
This will stop that shit sooooo fast, it might even deter normal gameplay/altruism.
---
Not tunneling when they use their borrowed time and ds to save the fucking unhooker
---
He can’t grab while invisible anyway.. plus the silent bell is ultra rare.
---
Also you would see him as he decloaked no matter what, so I don’t think it would be overpowered or anything.
---
I had two 32k point games on him at green ranks the other day, I also had a few sub 10k point games. I either own or get rekt on him, never in between
---
This is Patrick in that one episode where they try to get into the salty spatoon
---
I complained about looping and stuff but then I discovered that if I hold R2 I could lunge and how to get sloppily mindgame... I know I'm stupid but at least I figured out how to counter loops!
---
Try countering a bubba with bt, or have the person who saved you get down and be camped once again.
---
Yeah, I always find it really cool when people do stuff like that because sometimes I kind of lose the connection thay the killers are just another person behind the screen. They can also take puty on survivors having a bad game and let them leave rather than being toxic and getting a 4k every time no matter what. It feels good to get a message afterwards of someone simply saying thanks.
---
I GOT YEETED OFF PSN FOR A WEEK RIGHT BERFORE I LEFT FOR VACATION FOR A FUCKING MONTH! NOW I COULDNT PRESTIGE NANCY WHEN I WANTED AND I CANT PARTICIPATE IN DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS!
---
Imagine being on a forum and being this opposed to discussion
---
Quote "sometimes ruin is hard to find, sometimes not. Ruin is randomized, canisters not so much."  That implies to me that the placement of canisters are not randomized and are in the same location each time you get a certain map. 
---
You have 7 areas on a map that are spread out but on smaller maps a faster killer could guard those. Even if you didn't factor in hiding factors or objects on the map and put the canisters as far away from each other as possible, it would still be able to be guarded by killers like Billy. 
---
Like I said, the idea is cool and it is almost exactly what they do in Friday the 13th game (find car battery and keys to start car, find gas canister to escape on boat) so the idea isn't foreign to me. It just wouldn't work as well in practice for this game as I think you're thinking it would. 
---
I'm not knocking the idea or you at all, I like the concept, but I don't think it would go well in practice.
---
A timer begins as soon as you enter a trial that will eventually cause you to fall asleep. The timer is 60 seconds. You can see the progress of this timer with the tiny clock in the bottom left of your screen. This timer, and freddy hitting you, are the only two ways you can fall asleep. When you are asleep, the only ways to wake up are to go towards the alarm clock (white aura across the map), have a friend snap and clap at you until you wake up, or to fail a skill check. The alarm clock wakes you up for 90 seconds. The other two methods wake you up for 60 seconds. When you're asleep, freddy can use his generator teleport more often and his traps will begin to affect you. 
---
Freddy can have either of his two traps equipped during a match, but not at the same time. One is a puddle of blood called a "dream snare." Stepping on it will slow you by 15% for 3 seconds. One second longer than a default clown bottle. His other is a "dream pallet" which are fake pallets freddy can place any location where it is possible for a pallet to appear. Dropping these pallets causes them to explode in blood, usually resulting in freddy getting a free hit on you if he's nearby. The pallets are more often used because they require much less thought and planning to use. The snares are more powerful and require some tactics to use correctly.
---
If you have 300 ping then all of this info is irrelevant because you wont ever be able to tell whats going on and you'll most likely die quite easily every time he chases you.
---
True, tunneling is not bannable. But your whole play is.
---
I'd say it's a toss up between Clown and Ghostface. Something about cutting off their finger and sucking on it is just so good.
---
yeah, maybe even have the kick apply to the killer to deter camping
---
I would've preferred it so at least when they're abusing that stairway to walkway to jump off point to other floor, I could've thrown a hatchet at them. 
---
Billy was helpless
---
The problem people brought up last time the game was made harder, was that it's too inconsistent per game, and there arent enough points go around. (If I remember right, they made it 1 bar easier than what it was on the PTR across the board. Which was still 2 bars harder than before.)
---
To get iridescent objective, you need to do 2 gens. To get iridescent altruism, you need to (I think) get 2 unhooks and 2 heals. To get iridescent survival, you can't be downed. To get iridescent chase, you have to be in a chase for (I think) around 5 minutes total.
---
We already run into the problem of people depipping or just safety pipping after destroying a killer because one guy looped, and 3 did gens. No hooks means bronze altruism and everyone is only getting iridescent for survival and either chase or objective. You can try to make up for this by letting the looper open the gates and having the people on gens do totems, but that's a bandaid fix.
---
When going for pips instead of survival, you will be forced off of gens after doing 2 because you won't get any benefit out of it directly. The game actively pushes you towards not doing the objective, and to instead, sit near the killer waiting for to looper to go down for "brave" points and altruism.
---
Making the game harder will just mean everyone will have to actively farm by letting themselves be downed for altruism, letting gens be kicked so everyone can get their share of objective points, and hoping the killer doesn't tunnel vision so everyone can get their chase points.
---
We need an Alien chapter. And since we already have a non humanoid killer now, and there have already been a slew of alien games, I’m fairly certain that this is going to happen at some point
---
Paint thinner at least shows auras so you can see what the survivors are doing for like, 6 seconds
---
I honestly don't think they were prepared to be this big and have no idea how to improve. My company made close to 2 billion last year and our deploy fail rate is seriously like 40%.
---
It's instinct for a lot of new killers because they dont understand the "three strikes and youre dead" mechanic of being hooked.
---
Repost
---
I like plagues, the way she just does the little slap with her censer at the end.
---
he can grab when invisible tho.
---
And add on to this: I don’t do this EVERYTIME I’m camped or tunneled. For example, if there is a 1 gen left I’ll wait until they finish the gen and open an exit. Is there’s 3+ gens left and nobody is doing anything but but crouching 5 feet away from me. Thank you, next
---
If a game has gone on for 20 minutes, chances are you're still going to get a shitload of bloodpoints and rank up. Stop being negative.
---
My favorite bullshit map for totem spawns was groaning storehouse where all 5 totems could spawn inside of it at the same time.  They may be better hidden, but its like a one stop totem shop.
---
That's fair. To each their own. I personally play killer whenever I'm by myself or have nobody else to play with which isn't very often so I'm still pretty awful at actually playing them but I'm working on it. I just find it fun to be nice every once in a while. Say someone DC's in the game I'm in, I'll let the last person leave through hatch or something similar. Just small things. It feels nice to get a simple 'thanks' after the game.
---
But just realize it will be reduced to atoms
---
Honestly not a fan of her mori just because of the voice, it feels out of place
---
*shrug* just depends on ur playstyle. I like clown cus he can usually end chases quickly, creating pressure, but I see what u mean about wraith.
---
Because thats rng, finding the hatch on maps like the swamp can get annoying. And yes it’s annoying when someone gets hatch, but they just got lucky in finding it.
---
And there would be a status Proc "Scrutinized" which would indicate when your aura is revealed. Wether it applies globally is a different bag of worms. And I usually don't go too into depth since the dbd reddit community are awfully dismissive of anything that changes the meta unless it's a buff based on the majority of things i've read.
---
It should still be in your inventory. The killer's connection should never dictate the status of your item, unless they DC while its on the ground somewhere.
---
You’ve made a meme about enjoying memes. You know what’s next..
---
My first mori death as a survivor was a clown lol
---
You get your offerings back if someone DCs before the match starts.  It just unequips them
---
Love my crouchy boi
---
The real goal. Dem stacks though
---
How about no? The risk of hexes is that they can be destroyed, and are subject to RNG like everything else in this game.
---
If you don’t wanna risk losing the perk, don’t run it. But sometimes, you’re gonna get a bad spawn in. Sometimes, I spawn in right next to a Killer
---
Not true at all, the ghosty boi isn't even moon walking to hide the direction of his redstain or respecting the pallet
---
It only lasts like 10 seconds until it expires and how does a minor restriction make it any less op it still can drag Chase's across a gen's progress when used by good players
---
that wouldn’t change the meta, trust me.
---
I was one of those sore losers but I learned to counter those. I now win around 70% of loops, I just turn around when they try to flash me and I just ignore those people trying to get my attention until they are the last survivor left
---
Just fucking slug, m8.
---
bruh moment
---
This game already has too many survivor and killer perks that do basically nothing or are worse versions of better options.  If anything they need to overhaul the lame ducks before we dilute the pool even more.  
---
Hangman's Trick, Beast of Prey, Predator, Monstrous Shrine, Thanataphobia, Stridor, , Calm Spirit, Boil Over, Open Handed, Up the Ante, and so on and so forth.
---
The most recent patch added a scoring event for survivors for escaping the trial as the obsession. It’s 1000 BP for leaving the trial alive. Other than that, there’s nothing hidden.
---
I dont know the statistics so I dont know if that is true . Regardless, you came off very rude for no reason.
---
Well your a kind exception. The players i generally go against don't care.
---
Your joking right
---
To fuck you out of your BBQ &amp; Chili stack and if they teabagged and got downed acting like a jackass then fuck'em.
---
Yes! yes! yes! yes! YES!
---
Not bloodpoint thirsty, just don't wanna do good the entire game and then have noed come out of nowhere and have that trash killer get no skill kills cause he has no idea what he's doing. Only knows how to chase survivors and then DC's at the last second fucking people over.
---
Thank you
---
Not even any effort was put into this. Actual shit post
---
No he can’t... he can open lockers and kick stuff, bet he doesn’t grab anyone, he has standards.
---
I can’t stop playing it. I’m a fps snob but I also realize that it’s not going to run like my pc but I’ve had zero issues. I’m so glad I pulled the trigger
---
yeah the devs are stupid for this one, the whole reason matchmaking was a bust was literally because they weren’t taking the average rank at all...if they were then matchmaking would be fine
---
New to the game here. I don't really get when people say "stop tunneling". Like what am I supposed to do? Just stop chasing you and let you have an easier match even though I'm outnumbered 4 to 1?
---
Hag, Ghostface and Spirit in my opinion.
---
If i see you near the one i just hooked i will go for you, if i only can find you then i will hunt you down. Ps when i say the one i just hooked i mean like 5-10 sec ago i will go for who i can get.
---
I said I agree with that. Also, hidden or not, high rank survivors will find the totem more times than not.
---
The only grab you can get whilst invisible is locker grabs.
---
He shares this trait along with piggy they could both get locker pulls whilst in their stealth modes but because they can't directly attack from it they would either have to uncloak or stand up/ambush  it is impossible for them to grab you out of anything besides a locker which they are allowed to search in their stealth mode
---
YOU’LL GET THERE. I BELIEVE IN YOU!
---
Ever played him at red ranks? Lol
---
Myers, his is close and personal, if using the right addons he just grabs them by the neck and stabs the hell out of them. Simple, Cold, Merciless
---
source please? I'm stuck at work and would love to see it
---
Well technically it would be the survivor cleansing it for the greed of their currency vs the person that actually needs it to function, neh?
---
Gonna be nice.
---
Yeah that's fine. It's the survivor's fault for unhooking near you. That's not tunneling unless you genuinely go after one person the entire game. That's something I've always found annoying where you are just running around gens like usual and then they unhook right as you walk by and call you out like you were specifically doing that on purpose. It's stupid. People find anything to be mad about.
---
Is his tombstone mori different from his offering mori? Or are you just talking about him just grabbing them while they are running lol
---
Hitboxes are dummy thicc
---
Typically its faking a window vault. Both survivors and killers can do it. As killer stare at the window for a second, then move away, and as survivor, run out from the wall a bit like you are trying to get a fast vault and then run towards the vault but simply dont vault. If the killer is close enough they will probably swing and potentially miss, giving you distance. Also, there was a bug for a while where michael had no hitbox while vaulting, so you could slide through him while he vaulted. Another thing it might be referring to is crouching next to the killer as they vault so they dont see you and walk away thinking you ran. Most killers wont fall for this so dont do it. 
---
TL;DR it could mean literally any mindgame around windows.
---
Are you going to do the Ora Ora thing?
---
yeah i'm not saying you disagreed or anything. I'm agreeing with what you wrote. 
---
i don't think anyone's expectation is that a hex lasts the entire game, but they should at least be mildly challenging and not next to an objective that the survivors will seek out by default anyway. They should be a reward for actively searching for the hex rather than it being an added bonus to already doing your job fixing gens as a survivor.
---

Perks :
---
*The Red Snitch*
---
*You value yourself more than others*
---
The first time you start getting chased you gain the ability to reveal one survivor's aura for 60/80/100 seconds to the killer.
---
This perk also applies the Exposed status effect to the revealed survivor
---
*Hey trapper, did you know that the baby Dweet in that locker over there fucked your mom?"
---
How about yeah? At high ranks you can be easily gen rushed without it, and even then you can end up wasting a perk on it with bad placement. Perks shouldn’t be subject to RNG. 
---
Spawning in as a person is completely different because even if you spawn next to the killer, if you don’t run like a chicken with your head cut off the bat, you’ll be fine. Hexes can’t run or sneak away. The majority of the times the Ruin spawns are bad because of the RNG. As killer and survivor I’ve seen them get taken off the map before the first minute.
---
Yeah but... seriously who did not see this coming? Because shit post or not - he is 100% right. You almost always pip as a survivor,, except when you are the first being hooked and facecamped while having an inept team. Other than that, you will make your points to slowly but surely climb the ranks.
---
Source? I am a killer main playing a lot of survivor recently and no matter what I keep progressing in ranks while even as a decent killer I sometimes, against good cancer groups, gain no pips at all.
---
Clown is pretty crap at higher ranks, I love the fat boy but he's useless after a point. That being said if you like killers that slow the game down a bit, go for Legion (he's pretty bad too though) or use any M1 killer and sloppy butcher. That will slow down the game pretty well.
---
This is fucking incredible I'm going to print this out and tape to my ceiling so I can look at it every night
---
U like little kids huh.
---
MY RANK DOESN‘T SAVE ON SWITCH SO I AM ALWAYS RANK 20
---
I want to know to im confused
---
Does that work on ps4?
---
your helped
---
With that kind of playstyle, you will struggle in the higher ranks (purple and red). Camping, tunneling and using NOED is punished hard by competent survivors. There are a lot of survivor perks and strategies to counter this sort of behavior. Yeah you might get that one kill by camping, but you definitely won't pip nor gain a good amount of bloodpoints.
---
I had a game today where I used a BPS, someone DCed while we were loading in and I got it back

Seriously, if I had a killer moonwalking to the exit I'd probably stay because I'd be too busy laughing instead of running.
---
Theres nothing wrong with being a sore loser. People get baited, it happens. The key is understanding that your mentality is the issue, once you change that, you can have way more fun.
---
Exactly like you describe really! You realised that there were actually ways you could improve. Rather than being baited over and over and letting that ruin the game for you. A survivor getting your attention is a massive red flag. You can assume they are a self designated runner. Never do what they want you to do!
---
It's only slighty different in the way he grabs them, by the neck with thombstone and then kills them. With a mori, he grabs them off the floor with his hands and stabs them. It's almost the same, but the differences makes it feel more personal.

Okay Demogorgon instead. It’s 1,100 points every time you hit a survivor with Shred

I just want his bloody head to wear with the Scoops Ahoy uniform

since when is a 20 year old a little kid?
---
One time I downed this dude who farmed and purposefully sandbagged the only other remaining survivor and we proceeded to teabag him until he died. It was glorious.
---
She better come with Shirtless Myers and Shirtless Clown.
---
I believe you, I play both sides and I find pipping up as survivor much easier, when you're in rank 1 the only way to depip is by having a shit game which is almost rare because by that point you know what you're doing.

Green rank survivors won't be able to handle you.  Regardless of your intention it's going to result in unfair games in your favor against opponents that won't have the tools to deal with you.   This is all assuming you're a legit red rank killer and that you didn't boost your way up there of course.
---
They need to merge Grey-Yellow into one rank. Green into another and Purple-Red into one
---
OF COURSE DS IS IN SHRINE THE WEEK OF THE DOUBLE BLOODPOINTS! I AM BOTH EXTREMELY PISSED AND HAPPY!
---
- SOMEONE WHO PLAYS BOTH SIDES BUT ENJOYS KILLER MORE
---
no im not this post was literally just made as a joke and for laughs im not trying to criticize people and how they play the game
---
But they don't know that :P
---
Please dont tell me that...in my head everything would have been better at lower ranks 😔
---
I main claudette but I dont do stupid shit like this
---
Don't preach the old magic to me witch, I was there when it was written!
---
I am aware of its history and it was never taken as seriously as this sub takes it. It has always been for fun in halo. These people would never last. Just see their body getting teabagged and start screeching. People back then realised what was a bit of fun and not the end of the world. Halo teabagging was also just hilarious.
---
I suggest you reread my comment. I said in some cases in dbd it can be used for  respect. You can easily relay this message. As you know it is the only form of communication survivors have. and Im not talking about spamming it at the edge obviously. Killers relay comms with the nod as well. It is clear if they are mocking, celebrating, saying thanks or respecting, in my opinion.
---
Favorite killer is ghostface not only is it hilarious to see them freak out when I sneak and then hit them but it’s really easy to win as him ever since I’ve started playing him I’ve gotten 4ks and the occasional 3k im rank 6 so It’s not like I’m getting paired up with potatoes 
---
And my fav killer to go against is huntress
---
I don’t see a lot of doctors tbh, and only seen like 2 of them with mori’s. Not a bad mori though
---
Now imagine that you use actual "having fun" emote every time you drop a pallet at killer's head (laughter? smiling? "So fun" phrase?). I'm not sure your comparison is better than teabagging. A stranger still can take it as offense, and "normal" people don't usually mind.
---
How is Come Together OP? That can fuck up some serious Gen Repairs and actually favor the Killer
---
Well the game isn't deep enough for real discussion. The game is a meme
---
It's a bad joke, too
---
you mean the awful big bird shirt?
---
Calm down buckaroo
---
There are times when one side or the other goes out of their way (when there's a clear skill gap) to ruin the other's time. This doesn't seem to be the case. Sometimes bitches be salty. Ignore them, write down their names maybe for more intense future murder, and move on :)
---
Just doing my part homie. Otz is such a wholesome man, truly an inspiration to us all
---
Depending on how long ago you bought the game, you should have leather face. If you do, bbq is one of his teachables.
---
Dat 3% tho 🤤
---
Yeah :/
---
Exhaustion Add On for Huntress :)
---
Listen man I just want to play the game I put money into!
---
Well it'll probably be a while bc ruin was in the shrine not that long ago.
---
As a killer main:  yes!  Being healthy is a pointless luxury.  Survivors, heed this man, do not heal.  Disregard your cries of pain, your blood trails, and being one shot to dying state.  Trifles!  Only truly pathetic survivors play at full health, that’s why everyone at red ranks plays No Mither, because being full health is a pointless frivolity that serves no purpose except to display your obvious cowardice.
---
Me but to Meg, Feng or Kate
---
Dam+Dangerous = Damgerous
---
Honestly this sub has some of the best shit posts on reddit.
---
I personally hate playing with moris, makes the survivors go into try hard mode. I only use for the daily.
---
Just a few days ago and I had to save up to buy it
---
\[voice from the bushes, punctuated by the sound of knives unsheathing\] But you're obviously missing out on 500 extra bloodpoints if you don't wait for the last generator
---
Anyone else envision a Meg doing it or is it just me being Sprint bursted too often
---
please don’t *punish* me
---
The memes are extremely high-quality in this sub
---
Maybe, but 5 tokens is less slowdown than everyone injured with Thanatophobia, and that only adds 12 seconds to gen time.
---
Then you probably have leatherface already.
---
Really? I mean, isn't a big deal, especially having 3 ways to get out of dream state. You can't use bt in dream state, so? Just don't rush to save especially in chases, that's it. No need to Nerf to please low rank players
---
That's pretty much the only way to use a mori without screwing yourself over as killer anyway.
---
If not Me. Candy, who?
---
The point is the actress is portraying a kid, she may be twenty but the character is not plus why would u want a kid in a bra as an outfit, because that’s technically what it is
---
At last, the final infinity stone for the Boob3 god mode
---
generally devs are middle of the road
---
idk about BHVR specifically, but the director for overwatch has said multiple times that he hovers around the 50th percentile
---
Then you probably have leatherface already
---
So if I down 2 other people and hook them, I should still get DS'd because the third got unhooked like 40 seconds ago? DS should just reset if you down/hook another person and it would be a real anti tunnel perk, now it's just the slug perk because you never know who has it as long as one obsession is in the game
---
This happened a survivor I was spectating and it happened to me as well in a different game.
---
PLAYED A GAME AGAINST LEATHERFACE ON AUTOHAVEN
---
TELL ME WHY 4 FUCKING GENERATORS SPAWNED ON THE SAME SIDE AND THERE WERE ONLY 2 AT THE KILLER SHACK
---
THEN EXPLAIN TO ME WHY THERE WAS ONLY 1 PALLET AND 3 L WALL T WALLS FOR THOSE ENTIRE 4 GENS
---
So a Nerf because you can't re adjust your camera?
---
It was intentional tho, it's part of her power and strategy on trap placements.
---
I just leave.
---
No reason playing the toxic game, worst I do I shake my head at people.
---
First time?
---
If only it were time for your *treatment*
---
They won't be so much games as they are clubbing of baby seals but I get it.  Just try to have some compassion up there.  Regardless of intentions your games are going to be shitshows against vastly inferior opponents assuming you didn't climb to red ranks with like Prayer Beads and NOED or something.
---
&gt; Fun = will be nerfed ASAP.
---
Blizzard is that you?
---
I don't like the clipping on his waist, so I'll be sticking with Dapper Wraith.
---
Decisive Strike let’s you escape the killers grasp if you get picked up in 60 seconds (tier 3) but some killers ignore you
---
Green ranks are empty right now too so you’re wasting your time even more deranking.
---
deal
---
I mostly never run an ebony, I’ll throw on a ivory if it’s a SWF and they want to meme me with 4 flashlights
---
Up until Undetectable gets added to them, anyway.
---
You must be one of those people that throws technically and literally around when you talk without using them correctly.
---
Technically it's a picture of a 20 year old in a bra so you're still wrong.
---
BHVR wouldn't add it anyway nor would I drop the money for another paid cosmetic.
---
Sadly no I don't have the money just yet but I'm getting paid today so hopefully soon
---
No. I don’t usually run obsession perks, so if I get an obsession, anyone who gets downed within a minute of being unhooked gets slugged, because everyone is running decisive until proven otherwise.
---
Leatherface is a paid DLC??

But I want to get more points than you.

Makes me feel good more than any dancing and such could.

Im a survivor main my guy, my bad on not making that clear.
---
Escape is not a death
---
I once had a Freddy left me escape as Kate but in return I had to stay asleep so I could watch how he admired me 
---
Weird flex but ok 🤷🏼‍♀️🤣
---
Soooo true
---
CONTEXT: I downed the Nea, she DCs. A Bill was waiting for the flashlight save, but I down him. After I hook him, a David was right next to the hook attempting (and failing) to hide so I down him.
---
 They both kill themselves on 1st hook and I look for the last person to give them hatch. After not finding them for a bit, I close the hatch and it turns out she (the Meg) was right next to it the whole time, so I down her and take her to the Exit Gate. After dribbling her, she ran away from the door??? So I keep taking her to the door and she keeps running away and teabagging at pallets??? She clearly didn't have a key so like???
---
I was so confused at this point. She eventually died to Endgame and she gives me this gem.
---
No, but ive had people tell me its inaccurate. Probably the best weve got though
---
i thought it was quite humorous, actually
---
Lol ok purposely misunderstand me that's cool. I didnt say pointless. You said that. I didnt say never heal. You said that. I didn't t say no mither is good. You said that. 
---
I'm a killer main too. Red rank.
---
It's about knowing how vulnerable you really are. If you are at a strong loop with no other survivors, work on the nearest gen. Who cares if you are injured. Now if you've been hooked once or twice and/or are in a really bad spot, yeah maybe find a teammate or get a med kit.
---
Not sure why everyone here likes to put words in my mouth and then say those words (that I never said) are fucking stupid. Like yes, I know, and you purposely pretended to misunderstand what I said. Good for you.
---
If you are a killer main who thinks injured survivors should always heal immediately, then you must be pretty ass. Becuase that's not what red rank survivors do. They know when to heal, and when to apply pressure. It's called being confident in your abilities and knowing how to play the game. Healing is not bad. There is a time and play for it. But it IS a luxury. It is not needed for you and your team to win.
---
So youre saying I should just suck it up and play lobby simulator? What is this game...
---
On new map, even if you run past the totem, you not gonna notice it, and even if you've memorized all places, still have to go back and recheck the place, because you had no time to look behind the barrels or something, not mentioning that all spots in pretty inconvenient places. On most maps you can spot a totem just casually walking from one place to another, without actually deviating from your path.
---
This saddens me on a personal level.
---
The hunter becomes the hunted
---
I’m well aware of what it does, I’m just confused because you don’t seem to consider that a positive.
---
Sorry everyone, forgot to specify what version but yeah this was taken on mobile.

If u want to be super technical yes it is a picture of a 20 year old in a bra but in the show shes a kid still 😘
---
R/DBDGoneWild
---
Well, it is rage Wednesday so that comment should be in caps lock.
---
Isn't about punishing but rewarding instead. Giving more objectives to do or more BP doing different things and so on
---
Punishing a behavior never works, rewarding a different one does. It's always been like that, plus it's not survivors fault that gens are so easy to rush which is the most effective way to escape. It's devs fault that don't add more things to do since holding one button for even longer would just be annoying
---
This i am ok with if thats the case
---
Carol/Cheryl:
---
Perk 1 - You're Not My Supervisor!
---
Strong independent woman who performs at her best solo. Sabotage, repair and healing (self) is increased by 50/75/100 when no other survivors are within 40 meters. Skill check frequencies are increased for 25/35/45.
---
Perk 2 - Outlaw Country!
---
The killer is your biggest fan! Every failed skill check will initiate an audio/visual cue that is twice as loud and bright with a duration of ten seconds. During this time no other visual and audio cues are observable by the killer. This does not trump killer perks (ie. BBQ)
---
Perk 3 - Again, again!
---
Your lust fueld love of pain demands satiation! Requires two tokens to activate. If you unhook a survivor before being first hooked yourself, receive a token.  If after you are hooked once you unhook another survivor, receive your second token.  You are now able to be hooked a third time and remain in the struggle phase able to be rescued.  Your fourth hook instantly sacrifices you; cannot obtain another two tokens.
---
To be a good ghost face don’t stalk unless you got really good add ons, I usually go into stealth mode and sneak up on them and hit them so they don’t have anytime to react and my chases usually end in 5 seconds and remember to juggle survivors don’t just target one survivor if you hit a survivor and you see another survivor close by injure the  other survivor, if everyone is Injured it makes doing gens extremely hard because ghost face doesn’t have a terror radius so you can easily sneak up on them and get a free down since they’re injured, pair this with sloppy butcher and the survivors are gonna have a tough time trying to balance healing and doing gens
---
I've noticed some totem spots have become very good ones while others like the open one in the asylums is a huge fuck you to the killer.
---
I DON'T KNOW IF THE LATEST PATCH MESSED UP THE MATCH MAKING OR NOT BUT I'M GETTING MATCHED UP WITH RANK 3 - 5 SURVIVORS WHEN I'M ONLY A RANK 11- 13. AGAINST THE KILLERS OF MY RANK. POOR KILLERS.
---
I was thinking of a claudette using this in my head too
---
HELL YEAH!
---
\*takes one step back\*
---
Brilliant suggestion man, you should be on the dev team!
---
Dude just said demo is a stealth killer, as he roars loudly across the entire map every time he swings or does any action...the spirit is much more stealth with her smaller terror radius and she can turn invisible
---
It's not terrible at all.  You can use the auto healing after you get hooked to either work on a gen, or heal someone else.  Second wind allows you to get healed while you're being chased or tunneled if you can last that long.
---
Getting healed by another player takes about 20 seconds, self caring is about 30-40, IDR.
---
FUCK DAILY RITUALS FOR SURVIVORS/KILLERS I DON'T PLAY! I DON'T WANT TO WASTE BP FOR SOMEONE I WONT EVER. FUCK YOU BEHAVIOR FIX YOUR SHIT
---
Repost #3? This isn't funny after I've already seen it so much.
---
Gotta our boil over in there, and your good my guy
---
Makes sense on scratched mirror myers if I remember correctly.
---
Oh yeah?
---
That cat knows wazaa.
---
shh don’t remind them
---
it does work....did you even read how it works?
---
HONESTLY I HAVEN'T NOTICED A PARTICULAR CHARACTER CROUCHING ITS USUALLY EVERYONE!
---
Flip Flop is Godtier on Sabo Squads
---
This is a flimsy argument at best because you pick your perks before you even find out if your killer is going to camp and tunnel, but if it turns out your killer plays fairly you're still absolutely going to use those perks.
---
Nope.
---
Will power dude, Just put the game down, go nap, see friends and do something else, maybe play like 2 hours a day. Best thing to do is slow yourself down
---
Other than the movement speed buff i dont see how the other perks are op. Just because a perk is viable doesn’t mean they are op.
---
how dare you have an opinion. 
---
the nerve of some people.
---
I don’t know
---
The Baker:
---
Perk 1 - Feast! Able to spawn dishes around the map.  Neither the killer nor the survivors know what will happen if they eat the food. When done eating the killer will get a notification.  The meal either grants a running peed bonus for 30 seconds, causes a vomiting noise/trail for 30 seconds or increases item efficiency by 100% (items dont get consumed; addons dont count ie. Instaheals) for 30 seconds. All are equally 33.33% probable; all give killer notification once consumed.
---
Perk 2 - RSVP!  If a survivor pallet stuns, blinds or  locker stuns (DS doesnt count), that survivor becomes visible to the killer when the last generator is completed for 5/7/10 seconds.
---
Perk 3 - My Ingredients!  Able to boobytrap chests so that a jumpscare occurs and the killer receives a notification when the survivor first starts opening the chest.  Must be manually applied and re-applied after trigger.
---
The first time I got tombstoned I was so pissed. It was after I had been playing for around a month or so, and I thought the killer was modding or something 😂😂😂
---
Take a step back from the TV my dude
---
Keys yes they're the survivor cheese equivalent to moris.  But Adrenaline is such a silly false equivalency.  They earn their perk by playing optimally, killers are gifted NOED for playing like shit and losing their objectives.  Adrenalines haste and health state effects are single use only and are gone forever in 5 seconds.  Killers get to keep their haste effect and instadown that applies to all the entire endgame as long as their totem exists which it will against soloqueue lobbies since they don't reliably cleanse all 5 dulls unlike coordinated swf groups.  If you need to run NOED to have a chance in your games that is what it is but please let's put the false Adrenaline equivalency to rest.  NOED triggers as a reward for failure and has much stronger and longer lasting effects.
---
It just happens that every single fix devs did to a pig ended up being a nerf overall.
---
Not my proudest fap
---
I use it because I have an endgame build with my doctor. Distressing for map coverage, overcharge to slow gens, noed and blood warden to pause the game in endgame. It doesn’t matter when you get kills, and I don’t just let them do gens until noed pops. 
---
Honestly it’s an annoying build, but I feel like that’s what Dr. Carter would want
---
Ah yes, a fellow zet0r fan
---
I feel bad playing against baby survivors in the game. Like fuck man, I often play killer with no perks on PS4 so this is nothing new for me and I just feel bad you know? Killing them and hunting them down, fucking insane lol
---
wraith is pretty visible for experienced survivors so they will see you coming if you are anywhere out in the open. leatherface’s chainsaw, while obviously not good and not seeing much use, can get an instadown out in the open or between loops or in deadzones which is pressure that is much needed while playing killer (the chainsaw break as well is more niche in use but can still zone people to prevent them from getting to other loops or bait them into leaving the pallet). keep in mind the chainsaw negates ballsy saves and bodyblocks as well whereas wraith can do nothing in those scenarios except m1 and at best negate bt with no terror radius.
---
wraith’s only power in a chase is bodyblocking a pallet/vault but you can pretty much only do that in windstorm. he has no anti bully as well which means that the only way wraith can be better than leatherface is for mobility. although base wraith is only 126% so unless you’re running windstorm that slight mobility doesn’t mean much.
---
yes. we pick the perks because we don’t know if the killer will camp and tunnel. just like a killer would be ruin not knowing if the survivors will spawn next to the totem or not. it’s perfectly valid to use perks to counter things we don’t like. I don’t know how you expect someone to use bt if the killer isn’t camping? or ds if the killer doesn’t down u again within a certain time of getting off a hook?
---
I bet it got cleansed right away too, not because of it's placement but because you ran straight to it.
---
Yeah if it was 8 percent or more the survivors could permanently outrun the killers. noed would be necessary
---
I'd say I agree, but I've switched from trying to find the hatch to hiding at the a gate. Wait until the killer comes and should be at least be halfway across the map and still die more times than not.
---
I love how both of you freak out, I get jumpscared by survivors all the time on the new map
---
Bad totem spots
---
Completely not DBD related but that image showcases the “longest possible walk” someone could take. Sort of - like there are probably ferries and of course it doesn’t circle back. I watched a few videos about it (from YouTube channels like “Half As Interesting”) and to date no one has completed that walk. It would take roughly 3 years of walking 8 hours a day to complete and you’d probably die before completing it.
---
When you say "I kill everyone I don't know, but I let my friends live" - that's teaming, that's "working with a killer", and that's bannable. Even if you friends play "for real", they know they are not in real danger. That's unsportsmanship, and that's bannable. Is it really hard to understand?
---
😔
---
I’m surprised dead hard isn’t on that list. 
---
Honestly I think it’s stupid that most survivors ignore totems and then complain that there’s noed. Just do the totems it’s not that hard, then watch the killer squirm because he can’t one down everyone last second in a desperate act to get a 2k.
---
It doesnt make your blind quicker. Not anymore.
---
Personally, I believe you shouldn’t worry about your rank too (matchmaking seems to put you against whatever ranks is pleases). If you enjoy playing clown then play clown, he’s decent and fun to play.
---
I’m mad for the guy
---
I don't know, Huntress mori looks pretty brutal comparing to whimsy whacks of Wraith and Trapper.
---
Petition to have Natalia Dyer's jawline as the next killer
---
Benny Hill Theme as chase music YES PLEASE
---
You don't know how much I fucking hate that phrase, what does it even mean?
---
Nah you got it wrong, Doctor is definitely a stealth killer because if they always hear your terror radius then they don't know where you are. ;-P
---
only for my amusement? i guess thats true since people play video games to amuse themselves. whats wrong with that? we all play to have fun. because video games are fun.
---
this new system ruins the fun for everyone. the previous system ruins the fun for one person. in an ideal world, matchmaking would be fair to everyone and thats what i want. but i dont get the logic behind making it unfair for 5 people instead of 1?
---
Doc, Demogorgon and Legion rack up a ton of points quickly. Pair them with BBQ &amp; Chili, survivor pudding/bloody party streamers, and a build of your choice. You don’t need to use perks like Distressing or Thrill of The Hunt because they don’t add much to your total, they just help you get the 32k BP cap faster. Play normally and you should make a ton of bloodpoints. 
---
For survivor just use Prove Thyself and WGLF. They also make a ton of bloodpoints. Deliverance and Borrowed Time help get bloodpoints in survivor and benevolent category so try using those.
---
wouldnt that make Moris completly useless?
---
How about no.
---
I like second wind, I dont like that you have to fully heal someone and then also heal someone else a little more. When I tried it, it was with we'll make it and i healed the people fully at the hook and it wouldnt activate until I healed someone else a little more. They need to fix this,make it so it works how it reads and if I fully heal another survivor equal to one health state, activates. I would run it if they fix this
---
Still haven't finished a gen yet.
---
Inosuke best boy of all boys ever
---
Also he’s getting a better face eventually
---
GODDAMMIT I HATE LOCKING MY CAPS HELP
---
JESUS FUCKING CHRIST I’M GLAD I’M NOT THE ONLY ONE THAT HAD THAT HAPPEN, ONLY THING IS THAT SOMETIMES I GET MATCHED WITH A RANK 2/5 KILLER AS WELL
---
UNACCEPTABLE
---
r/uselessnobody
---
I think one problem with dropping the canister though is if you are solo and somebody else is carrying a canister and gets hit you won’t know where the canister is and can’t do the gens
---
No mither isnt tbe shittiest imo, i would actually run that in some meme builds w dead hard and resilience, slippery meat is shittier than no mither, bc even if you run it in a meme build, most likely it still wont do anything
---
I'm just saying, don't pretend like "I'm using these perks because killers are mean" when it's really "I'm using these perks because they're strong perks," which is totally valid.
---
You're allowed to state your opinion but why do you have to sound like such an insufferable asshole while you do it? I've never seen such a condescending tone, and it's about a video game OC nonetheless. Grow the fuck up an come back when you have.
---
It’ll legit be her best skin so far. I agree all of her skins are kinda the same and lack luster. There’s just not a lot you can do with her character. She’s just mehhhh. I wish they’d give her some assassins creed type of ancient civilization cosmetics and things that are a little out of character. Give her a NUN SKIN! I’m excited for a serum plague tho🙏🏼
---
&gt; Let us test out cosmetics before purchasing them? 
---
Testing cosmetics is pretty silly.
---
They are cosmetics. 
---
Testing characters makes far more sense (IE: Splinters)
---
I AM TRYING TO GET BETTER OKAY BUT MATCHMAKING IS LITERALLY ALLOWING ME TO PLAY AS A KILLER LIKE ONCE AN HOUR I JUST WANT TO GET MORE EXPERIENCE !!!!
---
True, I mean on its own I agree its the shittiest, since it puts you at a disadvantage and the others dont, I guess I just like it more bc it seems easier to meme with than perks like slippery meat, wake up or old left behind. I take back what I said but hope this clarifies what I meant
---
CAN YOU STOP CHANGING MY DAILY RITUAL AGAINST MY WILL IT'S NOT THE FIRST TIME I GET A DAILY FOR GENS AND AFTER THE GAME IT MAGICALLY CHANGES TO A KILLER QUEST I DON'T WANT
---
Hey, thats ok though!! I know we will need to start with something pre-made, so this is great direction for us to try.
---
I need help. I'm a chronic teabagger. Every pallet, whether it hits the killer or not, I pump out a few teabags. Right before the killer downs me, a few more teabags. Once I'm unhooked, even if the killer isn't present, a few more teabags. Please...anyone.
---
No problem!
---
You have to do \\\ for it to work
---
 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
You didn't say WHY you didn't like it you just said no. Could have at least said it was too cartoony in the first comment. And it's not like its ever gonna be added to the game I'm just trying to have some fun man. 
---
Your opinion isn't right evertime you know. Just let me have fun and stop being a dipshit
---
1. Offerings IMO shouldn't be that game changing. People would still use them just because, for dailys, or situational where they get bodyblocked often or no hooks are near
---
I hope that is the next map rework or autoheaven
---
I got you! No one likes vertical lmao
---
I'm afraid to tell you, they are all in the book. Check the index for the main sections
---
Seen what?  
---
You can't run through the killer while they break a pallet.  
---
How old were these videos lololol
---
That's why I asked for clarification. If he stayed to make sure everyone left, then no it's not toxic. But my understanding was everyone was already out.
---
&gt;What you questioned in that previous comment was about survivors learning against their own rank. If you, on the OLD RANKING, played SWF with your low rank friends, they are both (Killer and your friends) not learning. You are either doing gens, doing totems, or running the killer around for 5 years. This does not happen at the low ranks and they must learn for themselves what they must do.
---
you are definitely not wrong at all to assume this. but when I play with my friends, i intentionally try not to let the killer chase me around all game. i also use this opportunity to try weird builds or level up characters that are level 1. 
---
ofc i do gens. as for totems, i have taught all of my friends to do them the second they see them.
---
i get what you're saying though. if i make the killer chase me all game, my friends wont learn. that is 100% true. but in my particular case, this is not what happens.
---
Good enough to escape though
---
Yeah
---
It has been confirmed that it’ll happen by DbD’s Twitter as well.
---
I didn't lie about anything but it seems you suffer from a complete lack of substance since this whole post amounts to salt over your swf not getting preferential matchmaking treatment so I'm not surprised you went there.  You need to teach your friends how to play against actual killers man.  This matchmaking change isn't remotely as bad as the old system that allowed groups like yours to face considerably lower killers.  It is beyond tone deaf to complain that this isn't fair to your swf.
---
It does, sorry I thought you were some weird sick no mither apologist or something.
---
No no get 69
---
True, but that really fucks over survivors. Plus the hatch is kind of fun as killer cause it’s a race to find it first. Instaheals I wouldn’t mind getting nerfed but until then, Franklin’s. If the changes had a bit more give and take for both sides then it would be fine.
---
yes from 26 to 30
---
NOED is completely fair because by the time all gens are done you should atleast have one pip. If not, that's your fault.
---
BBQ is the reason my gamestyle is what it is. As long as I see a single aura, I'm gone from the hook. Lots of action for me, lots of BP for everyone... No. BBQ is a must have perk for me.
---
i have actually stated multiple times that i want the matchmaking system to be fair to all parties involved, but thank you for your kind words!
---
&gt; And it would slow down good players because they actively have to go find every totem. 
---
Well no. It doesn't. They just do the gens through ruin.
---
It literally only punishs newbies and as you already listed, We already have a ton of stuff that does that - why add more?
---
The only people this will benefit is low level killers, it will be even more slanted in their favour.
---
Unless you were being a jerk and teabagging and bad mannering during the game I don’t think that was being toxic at all. You’re not required to just leave as soon as the gate is open and abandon your teammates. 
---
I am a killer main.
---
Me and my friends being immersed Claudette's in swf 
---
The Killer: Something's wrong, I can feel it
---
Damn nice, very odd time tho, i thought they would wait till halloween
---
That’s kind of a choice no? To stay in tier 1. Pig is slow in stealth mode no matter how you want to play her
---
Id assume its console, prob had something to do with it.
---
You would consider Demogorgon as stealth? I mean yes, he has the new status effect when he comes out of his portals for a short duration (which is fun to use when I use it to grab some survs off gens) but I wouldn’t say he’s stealth. Is that just me or does anyone else agree? Good meme btw😂😂😂
---
from a business standpoint it makes absolutely no sense to make it so that friends cant play together. well, they can. but apparently they shouldnt as it will only drive them away from the game. but they will also lose hundreds of customers if people dont try to get their friends to buy the game. there are many ways a game sell copies. friends convincing each other is a very big one. 
---
srsly - how can you not see that its bad that if you want to play with friends, you have to make them not have fun?
---
Wow, usually when these type of “suggestions” are made, the perks are either wayyy too bad or wayyy too good. Now, these are actually alright (except maybe for come together). Good post.
---
Looks like dark souls character
---
There is a way to see which teachable perks you have
---
by putting the group against a killer of the average rank.
---
So.. you flashlight him every pallet.. that's annoying
---
And you got the 4% and did nothing so your mate died .. annoying too.
---
And you got the hatch, which is sad for me
---
there is, you click show info on a killer/survivor and the teachables are locked or unlocked depending on what u have.
---
Yeah it seems odd, but I guess it’s a big help as well for the recent chapter that dropped last week. Just for those who really want to grind their characters.
---
YEA THIS REMINDS ME ALSO TRYING TO FIND A GAME AS KILLER TAKES TOO LONG. DEFINITELY FUCKED UP THE MATCH MAKING. PC BY THE WAY.
---
Yes yes yes yes
---
Pretty sure he was kidding....
---
I feel like we’re just gonna disagree on this one. Good discussion tho, and good luck out there in the fog!
---
I just bought the game after the free week. Realized that you cant buy with in-game currency the following killers: Leatherface, Freddy Krueger, Michael Myers, Ghostface and the pig from saw...
---
What a fucking shame.
---
Plot twist - Dwight is running Head On
---
You're right nobody has ever had a trial where one person doesn't do anything at all but still manages to be the one to escape or get the hatch. What was I thinking?
---
Little quick to make excuses for bones not being cleansed. I solo queue as well and hardly ever run into NOED. And when I do I rarely go down to it because I just leave. That's where everybody messes up and turns a 1k to a 4k. They feel the need to go back for the 1. It's the same as the people that try to save a hooked person against a basement camping bubba. Overly Altruistic.
---
I can't citate this because I have no idea if they wrote it on a blogpost, or said it in a stream, or something else, but it boils down to this:
---
When they got the licenses for Freddy, Leatherface, Pig, Michael, etc, switch wasn't in the picture. Therefore, they have a license for PS4, Xbox, and PC. Now they're still in contact with some license holders, like the pig, so when they got the cosmetics done they probably also made a deal for switch and maybe mobile. But for EG Leatherface  they now have to go back to the license holders and work something out, same for all other licensed killers, and some they got but some are still being worked on so they might be coming but they also might not and there is no way to tell. 
---
Freddy is in a particularly odd spot because (some of) his license recently shifted owners, which might even mean that he'll be our first deleted killer if the new owners decide to be nasty. But if they aren't, we might get him on switch.
---
That's not what I'm saying at all. I'm only replying to the fact he said no other killer has to sacrifice map pressure and speed for stealth. Playing stealth Myers is exactly that. You sacrifice speed, map pressure and lunge distance for the tradeoff for stealth. It makes Myers a joke tbh.
---
Oh absolutely. If you're being active with BBQ (and I guess Ruin if you make a hex build or guard it all game) it can pay off and then you're not "down" a perk. 
---
There's just some people who won't even touch a killer without it, like me, while having a build or tactic they want to try but feel like they need BBQ.
---
I don't think anyone should consistently sacrifice for fun or the meta, especially since Killer is already stressful enough.
---
Do not respect pallets. Get them to drop them when they don’t need to then break them. It leaves them fewer safe havens on many maps. Some are so full of pallets it kinda doesn’t matter but ones like the killer shack are super advantageous and if you can get them to drop it early on your face then you can break them. I always try to hit them and never respect the pallet. I lunge for them and sometimes get lucky with timing and hit them just as or before they drop it. Other than that it is just a matter of learning which loops you really can’t chase on, learning to mindgame and fake them out, and knowing when to break chase.
---
Others have said what it is so I won’t get into that. But it can be an effective evasive tool for survivors against inexperienced killers. I’ll often try it with frequent success against a lot of killers but most of the time, they learn after you do it once so don’t try it too often. Your biggest tool as survivor is being unpredictable. 
---
Another note is that this can work fairly well against Legions in frenzy, since they can not see scratch marks, though some windows work better than others, like the center building side window on the butcher house farm map.
---
What are you on about..
---
Please tell you had two hex perks, if not Ruin it was nice knowing you
---
was it the same when you restarted the game? this hotfix is buggy as fuck, i played for a little while last night and crashed for the first time in forever, and got DC'd from two or three games.
---
Practice and watching YouTube videos on specific topics that I need work on.
---
It's an Army of Darkness...
---
Anyone know what time it starts tomorrow?
---
&gt; This matchmaking change isn't remotely as bad as the old system that allowed groups like yours to face considerably lower killers. 
---
what are you talking about...? we consistently faced killers that were around the same ranks as my friends
---
Are you being sarcastic or? Kinda confused here.
---
Ya but in trying to fix the u international buff, they gave her a big that causes the screen the freak on successful basic attacks.
---
You mean to tell me that I’ve been mindlessly juggling for a whole year now?!
---
Why did you start with no it won't?  
---
And you're right it's not unrealistic to have two gens pop before you first down, but it's not unrealistic for me two down two or three survivors before they break my ruin or complete a generator.  
---
It's a frustrating perk because it's so RNG dependent on placement, number of skillchecks, etc.
---
Yeah. Sometimes you can just get few a downs by just running a perk that they don't expect.
---
You literally listed three counters to it. Two of them being actually good perks that also have a use outside of avoiding pallet blinding. Not to mention that flashlight last what? 15 seconds in the entire trial. Yes they're annoying but there's no reason to change it.
---
Spirit because gen grabbing is fun and I'm only rank 15 so people still don't know how my power works (tbagging after dropping a pallet, thinking I'm just standing there).
---
I do but have any of these. I didn’t play much during the summer event.
---
Maybe it's like an early exclusive thing? Maybe they'll make it purchasable through iridescent shards soon. And if not, yeah that is kinda BS.
---
Ghostface has alot of antilooping and mind game potential at loops with the fact he can hide his red stain, is very short, and can crouch id say he is one of the best m1 killers at anti looping! 
---
Yeah thats true about leatherface theres not much to him but he seems like hed be alot of fun especially against over altruistic survivors.
---
Yeah, probably better off leveling hag the old fashioned way. She's fun to play anyways. Really nice jumpscares.
---
Joel or Ellie from TLOU
---
Because it is apparently an interesting character, it is like Hitler and the volkswagen, if the story I've heard is right he was the one who asked for them to be made, and they ended up being really loved cars.
---
In this case the problem is that using it would directly benefit Salva, if the character was owned by the metro goldwyn mayer and could be separated from Salva, probably DBD would have gotten him.
---
What does it do?
---
🗿
---
In theory, every single user can have the same name on steam
---
Yeah thats true but they both seem like fun to me Ill probably go with ghost face but still ive seen amazing stuff with leatherface from fungoose lol
---
I think it's funny in situations where people meme around for a bit, but ultimately get back to the game.
---
Still, I totally approve when the killer messes around after two or more players DCed early on, since the normal flow of the game is beyond salvation at that point.
---
Honesty I just do it for the points. It's also slightly helpful in a chase.
---
My cup runneth over with memes.
---
It dont rlly think that at all .(im not a salty survivior main im just expressing my opinion)Flashlights are easily counterable, and unless hes using iron will a good killer can just track easily.
---
Bro today I got called a tunneling camper by a guy who DCed while I was bringing him down to the basement.  
---
I found him on the other side of the map from the first person I hooked, and it was this David's first hook.  
---
Like bro if you're going to call me a tunneling camper, atleast give me the chance to do either of them in the match.
---
Cool
---
Forget DBD on Switch. I wanna give that kitty in the background *all* the headpats and belly rubs.
---
I can't believe they've done this shit!
---
Killer can choose not to break pallet, killer can easily tell where which direction survivor went even when blinded, you just need to play tge game some more and you realose its not that hard to follow sound and not fully depend on visual
---
In general, camping and tunneling is terrible and a negative way to play the game. 
---
But the survivors have to at least TRY to not be seen when going for the unhook.
---
This doesn’t mean I’m agreeing with you, you’re still playing like shit. Even when it’s SwFs survs are still bad at the game so you shouldn’t be getting dumped on. And stop blaming survivor perks too. Dead Hard is easily baited. Self Care literally helps you as killer, it makes people waste 32 seconds of time after each hit. DS stops tunneling and since it effects you so much it’s obvious you’re tunneling. Stop blaming stuff and evaluate your skill
---
I always like to think of it as a game of hide-and-seek. If I'm the seeker and you keep hiding in the exact same spot I'm not going to pretend I don't know you're there.
---
Someone hasn’t really put effort into finding out what teachables they’ve unlocked. I thought it was pretty straight forward with the way it’s laid out.
---
Ohhhhh. I feel dumb. I’m a PS4 user so I’m used to TOMx192837
---
Coincidence
---
What was  nerfed?
---
Lol I thought everyone knew about this!
---
Otzdarva is great if you want to learn killer  
---
Puppers is an awesome survivor, positive, memey and entertaining.
---
im rank 2 currently. i play with my 3-4 friends who, obviously, have ranked up as they play more. i believe their rank is 16 on average atm. 
---
i was gonna say im not smurfing but i guess technically maybe that would be the correct term? the difference is that im not actively trying to play with new killers; i just wanna play with my friends regardless of their ranks
---
You know, I’ve been debating getting Legion. I know he’s ass but he can close a chase quick and Frenxy helps you see the location of others, so as a bad killer he might be better to run. I also wasn’t discordance. 
---
But I just got GF and Demo to 50 and my plague is sitting on 42. And I need to get the new perks on a ton of other killers. 
---
Choices choices.
---
Wait do survivors not get BP if the killer dcs?
---
Not that big of a deal. Just watch out for people baiting you into picking them up, and always slug the last person you unhooked if you down them
---
We need more rewards than just bloodpoints on all platforms, I’m tired of running out of killer add ons
---
Yeah the blood webs are way better than they used to be. You just have bad luck in terms of not getting BBQ yet. Luckily there is a 2x Bloodpoints  event starting tomorrow so you’ll be able to find it even quicker
---
This. Especially with matchmaking lately. It'll be me at R15-11 depending on the day I'm having, an R8, and then 2 R20s. The 20's usually get rolled and tunneled when in reality I often try to throw myself at the killer in exchange. Just give the lowbies a hard time and then show them out. They need the BP.
---
This is the kind of person that puts "Leave any salt in the comments it taste sooooo goooood" in there steam bio.
---
^no pls
---
Imma fast vault into ur stall to check on you!
---
I spend 1.2mil on wraith, i still don't have it, not even tier one, i just gave up even though my wraith is prestige 2,im way over level 50,for 1.2 mil looking for a single perk is just a bit dumb, i kept getting same 3 sometimes 4 perks in 3 bloodwebs, tier 1 next blood web tier 2 of the same damn perks
---
get headphones
---
Another issue is the fact you can't just give dollars for skins - you have to buy into their predatory MTX currency which makes you a step rem9ves from your money and more likely to spend more.

Everybody who plays dbd should read this or any other guide that explains to them properly what is tunneling and others, like a glossary. I'm a killer main and I've seen so many times survivors calling me a tunneler, camper at the endgame, when clearly they don't know what those words mean and I wasn't doing all of that lol. But yeah, a lot of survivor get so salty but so salty when they just simply don't win. Sometimes I play as a survivor with my friends and people should know that loosing some of the games is part of the game, get over it. Like the game motto says: Death is not an escape
---
Mmmm. Sweet sweet dweet meat.
---
Can I get the original photo by chance?
---
Devs are incompetent, nothing new, the only department who is doing go and is the reason why they didnt meet there same fate as there competition is the design team for cosmetics and characters/Killers !
---
Since camping isnt against the rules, they wont ban it
---
Yeah, it’s new.
---
Seems like you need a good dosis of mori every day.
---
My recommendation is 3 in the morning, 2 at noon and 4 in the evening.
---
Brain fart on my part. Edited it out now but I have no problem acknowledging it here. 
---
And I agree Ruin is very RNG and I can't pretend like I never had wins because survivors didn't know how to deal with it. However, I do think much like only playing Nutse and Spirit won't teach you good killer fundamentals, having Ruin in every build won't improve your understanding of creating pressure.  
---
The better the killer and the worse the survivor, Ruin can absolutely be an awesome perk and form of pressure.
---
I just feel people need to experiment more in this game, especially killers if they want to have fun. Because we all know who and what to play to increase our chances of 4ks exponentially but if you're not going to commit to those killers and builds, just try your own builds more often.
---
for what killer
---
Had that happen last night on Xbox. Loaded up my boy Steve to sabotage 2 hooks, did that, didn’t get the ritual. When I looked it changed to 4 after phase hits with Spirit. I was ok with that.
---
S A M E
---
Wait, so is ruin a joke because of totem placement, or busted because it’s so common? Can you guys pick one?
---
Yeah that's what I was referring to and why the new matchmaking system is way better than it used to be.  As a rank 2 survivor you have zero business playing a rank 16 killer.  If they choose to chase you games over, your friends can pop every gen during that chase.  They are incapable of counter playing loops at that rank.  They don't understand the game yet.  As for your last statement you can still play with your friends regardless of their ranks.  Absolutely nothing has changed regarding that.  You just won't be able to club baby seals anymore.  Teach them how to play the game well and they'll climb rank naturally.  You're still in swf with constant communication.  That still is worth quite a lot.
---
They changed the rarity, used to be the highest rarity, now the Wedding Ring should appear more often.
---
from the wiki:
---
&gt;**Unique Wedding Ring** (Very Rare)
---
&gt;An engraved wedding ring that emerged from The Fog and resonates with an indescribable and incomprehensible energy.
---
&gt;Reveals the Obsession's Aura.
---
&gt;Decreases your chances to be The Killer's Obsession.
---
i've never in my 500+ hours gotten this add-on in my bloodweb, and i didn't know add-ons to lessen your chances of being the Obsession existed! kind of interesting.
---
No. People just like racking up bigger numbers I guess.
---
it's a key add-on!
---
DaRbY rEtIrEd
---
Oof. In your defense, I didn't know there was a way to check until the 200hr mark lmao
---
I take this, but No Mither instead of flip flop and then use it as my main build
---
In OPs defense I too just learned about this today. 
---
Helpful to look at it under the individual characters, but it would be a lot better if there was a single page for all learned teachable perks across an account.
---
Killer main, not good as survivor, but got fresh outfits
---
wait, so it used to be pink? no wonder i'd never seen it before, i guess - i'm only now starting to get pink items in my webs on a semi-consistent basis.
---
Me when I play nurse
---
I’ll link when I get home, but it was a video on Advanced jukes or window jukes.
---
Ghostface. It's my actual dream to photobomb his Mori one day.
---
No mither has its uses, Vaulting builds are crazy good with no mither. i would say the worse survivor perk is somthing like This is not happening or calm spirit
---
&gt; Teach them how to play the game well and they'll climb rank naturally.
---
but how will they enjoy playing the game if they have to play against people much better than them?
---
i have no business playing against rank 16 killers, nor do rank 16 survivors have any business playing against rank 2 killers. i know that we as a SWF have significant advantages, but my friends are still actual people that want to have fun. they're just as valid as the killers are.
---
The matchmaking seem so wonky on survivor. I been climbing up and been at 12 for a few days and been getting paired with 16s and lower or red ranks. Interesting to see the difference in skill but makes it hell to pip as a solo player since it's a crapshoot on what the killer level is.
---
Self Care is one of the worst perks in the game for your teamates as you rank up.  Run anything but that.  It teaches the worst game losing habits for survivor.  You'll improve immediately getting it off your loadout.
---
But who are S and J??
---
Do totems count as objectives? And are they subject to BP offerings?
---
&gt; if you are buying a car, you want to take it for a spin first
---
Yes but the difference between a cosmetic and a car is if the cosmetic is faulty I wont risk swerving of the road and crashing or being stuck in the middle of nowhere.
---
back to roblox
---
This was the perks and add ons. https://i.imgur.com/RpxN2Yc.jpg was I really in the wrong, I mean sure but that build is not that toxic. And Myers tier 1 is slow as
---
Thrill of the Hunt is a Hex perk that does three things: reduces totem cleanse speed by 6% for each remaining totem, gives the killer a notification when a survivor starts cleansing a Hex Totem, and gives 10% more Bloodpoints in the Hunter category
---
It’s a bug I think. I’ve been in 4mans and have had the killer dc right on the last escape, and only 1 or 2 of us are awarded any BP for the match while the rest don’t get anything
---
That and Legion is sprinting so he’ll move further before it clicks to look around.
---
All of those perks being c to bottom tier.
---
more frustrating when you go to get someone and just as you get there they're being rescued by someone else even though you haev WGLF
---
Never even played it but at this point I think I should lol
---
I should've been clear, but I meant Haddonfield offerings as killer, yea
---
lol, welcome to DbD
---
NOTE FROM OP: 
---
I am grateful for the cosmetics available with Shards! I'm talkin' High Roller Ace! Flying Ace! Frontier Billy! Cold Wasteland Huntress! Death Parts Nurse! I love it, we all do I think? 
---
I'm mostly just asking for less exclusives, more Iridescent optional skins. It would give players with thousands of hours (who only play DbD at this point to have fun and to improve) something to grind for, something to look forward to, and spice up their games when finally earned. We have free to play skins, but it's so few and far in between, and they're generally far less interesting than the premium looks. we want to play more, earn more! we want to mix and match! I dont think its unreasonable to ask for a nicer cosmetics late-late-late game grind.
---
It seems your perks are really good for your rank. Those are the perks a purple or red rank Myers would run so maybe that's part of the reason they're so salty.
---
Notifies the killer when a Hex Totem, including Thrill, is being cleansed and slows down cleansing speed a bit. Also helps max out the Hunter points for the killer for every totem standing.
---
Seems powerful on paper until 2 or more survivors know about and simply power through while you're in chase. Or they just use it as bait to pull you away from Gens.
---
No he doesn’t hang in green ranks. He used to hang in lower ranks when he was legitimately more toxic. This was when he really didn’t play Killer at all, and ONLY looped. He almost never did Gens so it was much harder for him to rank up, especially because he would always inevitably get caught and promptly face camped. He would even say he knew he deserved it and accept it. It was a running joke on his channel that he would never escape/survive in the end because he would piss the killer off too much. The majority of his humor is sarcasm, he’s self aware and isn’t salty when he loses, even when it’s to a mega prick of a killer. But the point is he’s changed how it plays, apologized for previous toxicity, and picks on people his own ranks now. 
---
He got a lot of shit for it, and hasn’t done it in a long time. He’s apologized since then, and stays in the ranks he’s supposed to be now. Dude doesn’t even going in games for the sole purpose or looping anymore. 
---
That’s my entire damned point. But oh yes its just because I think he’s funny according to others. Noob3 taught me how to survive in a chase longer that 5 seconds. He is entertaining, and he’s good at the game. His editing style is also entertaining and he has grown as a content creator. 
---
And really, you’re gonna compare him Ochido of all damned people? 
---
***Really?***
---
Green toast on eggs
---
In every 5 matches i play there is always a survivor who DCs, in like 20+ games a killers DC,
---
at least you know who it is
---
Who knew blinding a killer to increase your chances of escaping is seen as encouraging toxicity
---
... yah..
---
But how will they enjoy playing the game if they have to play against people much better than them? 
---
Literally take that very argument and apply it to the killer.  It's the same exact thing man only the killer doesn't have 3 helpers in voice chat to guide them throughout the game.  
---
Again this isn't balancable one way or another so considering the absurd advantage you and your friends still have in voice chat if it has to skew one way or another it should absolutely be in the killers favor.  I took terrible friends and taught them how to be rank 1 survivors.  If you know what you're doing you can too.
---
They should use the average. Lets take a "standard" bully squad. 
---
Rank 15, Rank 10, Rank 9, and Rank 2 is around the usual ranks. 15+10+9+2 is 36÷4 is 9. So they should be matched with rank 9. Considering how ranks are in constant shift, I think this is fair. There will obviously be newer survivors that suffer, but new killers suffer already
---
MY GAME LOOKS LIKE GARBAGE
---
Unpopular opinion : I don’t like the memes at all yea there are some pretty funny ones but I personally would like more discussion about killers and what not but I see why people love the memes
---
I didn't say they did I'm expressing how I feel about it but you're looking for an argument where there isn't one..
---
To be fair he’s having issues with his internet and personal life at the moment. The apartment he moved into isn’t the greatest and his kitten keeps literally destroying his cords to everything.
---
people love to condone these practices (gotta make money durr), but I completely agree with you. Auric cells as a whole are an entirely unnecessary step to just directly purchasing what you intend to buy.
---
They don’t get their daily, lose any addons collected during the game that they escaped with and reduced bloodpoints sometimes but they do receive bloodpoints
---
Once had a game with an Ace, Bill, and Nea(I believe) in SEA servers against a Nurse. Ace farmed the Nea to death cause he'd unhook immediately in front of the killer, and he attempted to farm Bill and I as well. The nurse realised what he was doing after the Nea died, and so did me and Bill. Upon being put into the dying state, me and Bill ran over to tap on him and teabag him, keeping him in place. The Nurse let us continue. Everytime he got up after an eternity of tap healing him, the Nurse would down him again. We made him DC, and we all stood still to say our prayers at Nea's death hook.
---
Well then the killer is doing that on purpose, exploiting a bug to punish survivors
---
I started playing with the free week thingy and bought the game, I just love playing the catch and release game and let em escape, not looking for ranks or anything and I wish I could "tbag" like they do to have fun together.
---
Original video by u/IStormPush
---
Problem with the changes is not the BP, problem is they made it that you get same perks in 3 bloodwebs insted of random, as stated above for me i spend 1.2mil and i kept getting same perks tier1 tier2 tier3, i think that's the frustration
---
I played a few days ago against someone who was relatively new [I didn't play since the last rank reset, so my rank was around 12ish]. I put the pallet down, but he never broke it. He just kept trying to go around and hit me. Afterwards, in the game chat, he complained about not being able to do anything at the loop.
---
I told him; either bait the pallet drop or swing through it. Either way, in 90% of cases, you break the pallet right away because you'll get looped the same way over and over. Granted, there are some places where you don't have to break the pallet [Stranger Things map, upstairs room], but in most cases you should. 
---
Some loops are super difficult, while others are easier to deal with. Keep playing, understand which loop gives you the most trouble, and prioritize your time. Why go after a survivor at a difficult loop when you can take an extra 5 seconds chasing another survivor at an easier loop?
---
Ok, yeah, I did not see that. But regardless, telling someone to go kill themselves is a pretty scummy thing to do over a video game.
---
second wind is easily steve’s best perk
---
You're expressing common sense then. NOONE actually wants an inescapable trap
---
I dont like this. Should be the average imo
---
Okay so then what's your problem..
---
I think this is the trouble. Everyone enters the game with this mentality but it slowly becomes more and more competitive and all people want is pips and points..
---
Carefully, this man is a hero...!
---
I had three killers dc in random games last night. Sometimes they weren’t doing well at all and sometimes they were doing very well but at least if a survivor dcs it doesn’t end the game and steal points from the killer.
---
Thank you so much for your answer. I hope everything works out soon. I was looking forward to playing Freddy on Switch. We’ll just have to wait and see how this goes. If anything bhvr should be transparent about this since this means the switch version is lacking stuff other versions have
---
Thank goodness I'm on pc. Now they have fixed the swf matchmaking, they need to implement punishments for people deranking just to fuck with killers/survivors. Lobby times for me have not increased one bit after the patch.
---
ALSO
---
The killer lunge is a thing of beauty
---
That you act as if that's what they're planning on doing.
---
I know Amanda would make them inescapable but in this game that doesn't work well at all it makes it unfair and silly.
---
That is pretty good, for once BHVR finally wanted to give us something we wanted
---
Medkit = possibility of an instant heal. I've run into those enough to know that if I'm not running Franklin's I should probably murder the ambulance.
---
As far as playing Steve and getting targetted? Blame other survivors. As f as far as my games have been, he's swiftly overtaking Nea as the most annoying asshat in the game.
---
I want people to stop making posts about how they provoked a killer and then act like the killer was just mad for no reason
---
SMALLER PADDLES!
---
Must be brown ranks, i don't know about that, but for personally i haven't had a DC in days literally and i play over 6 hrs a day, red and purple ranks.
---
ohhhhh
---
My brother got accused of stream sniping some dude yesterday. We looked up his name and saw he had 1 fucking viewer on mixer. Lmao.
---
Survivors will go to crazy lengths to blame people for their losses.
---
Not at all. You don’t have to pick the survivor up this eliminating the risk of decisive strike. In addition to that, you don’t have to worry about hook economy or finding one. And overall it’ll have you time. Current Mori’s are a disaster, this would actually be a great change.
---
Playing as a red rank survivor, I love it when I get the chance to farm. It doesn’t happen often.
---
As killer, I enjoy games at low ranks more so I try not to pip up too fast. I generally play the game normally until I have my BBQ stacks and then just kinda mess around with different chase tactics and let the survivors do gens and leave. Unless someone is being super annoying or toxic, then they can die on the hook. But I feel this method is more fun for everyone and I still get loads of BPs each game.

Wait til they find out that spirit has a reduced missed attack cooldown.
---
They all just suck tbh
---
IS *is* indeed a better perk, it lets you heal in ideal time while reducing killer's resources and you get a lot of bp, there is no down side to it.
---
But OP is a .... forget it..
---
When are these braindead devs going to remove the need to watch 70 hours of cutscenes before you can leave a match after you die
---
Almost ignored this as a joke post... Honestly, not bad! One of the best I've seen to be honest, both in perk relatability and power! They're good, but nothing crazy nor game breaking (have Come Together cancel after all gens are done cuz of Hope). Cheers!
---
I’d say early-mid October
---
Good luck man - this patch fucked the PS4 version with infinite queue times for survivor, frame rate drops for killers
---
&gt; Yeah, it backfires on the object all the time when I play killer.
---
&gt; yes considering the fact that the killer can also see you and you’ll probs get tunneled
---
Bullshit on it being fair and balanced. A killer earns his BBQ aura reading through hooks and it only lasts for a few seconds. A survivor can stand in the corner of the map and have a sandwich and watch the killer continuously and whisper his/her location to their buddies. Even from a locker for YEARS prior. The perk is so aids that they made two new status affects around it.
---
There isn't any killer perk that reveals an aura forever and BHVR wouldn't dare make one since survivor mains like you two will be up in arms about it. OoO is just another no-skill-required crutch perk for survivors. One of many.
---
And the fact that the OP's suggestion would bring out offense at his idea says it all with all survivors would feel about killers having any sort of buffed aura reading ability.
---
you must live near the ocean.
---
Here here! I look down for a few seconds, they either give up and I continue the chase, or they continue and waste their flashlight, I'm not getting blinded. And if they aren't running Iron Will, I'll take the blind, break the pallet, and use my great Headsets to tell where they've gone. More often than not, I'm still right behind them.
---
You're right. The comment said it was annoying. Have a juice box and take a walk.
---
Which I did acknowledge in my original post. The reaction he got from the killer was unwarranted. Which is my main problem with this entire community. You get the same kind of reactions on both sides, killer and survivor, which is ridiculous because there shouldn't be sides in the first place. It's just a game.
---
What who's planning on doing wtf are you on about
---
BHVR should just rework BBQ. Its farm bonus should be the base for all killers-it will actually be healthy for the game because it brings more build diversity and promotes other playstyles than camping and tunneling. 
---
Players want points, the game is a grind if you haven´t been playing regularly. I know it myself-I would love to play other stuff, but grinding for teachables is a lot of time. Playing anything other than BBQ feels painfully slow.
---
SOON™
---
ALSO, KILLERS WHO CAMP AND TUNNEL AND HAVE "YEEE GIVE ME A SALT IN COMMENTS" ON THEIR PROFILES MUST HAVE REALLY SAD, BORING LIVES
---
Looking forward to it but I'm worried for Plague and Huntress.
---
&gt; stronger in the lower ranks because they literally will not touch a gen till it's gone.
---
Maybe they’ll learn to actually do the generator instead. You act like nobody would adjust to the change. 
---
&gt; How do you not see a problem with that?
---
How do you not see a problem with a perk that is wiped out as useless nearly instantly half matches? Better yet, how would you call that a strong perk when it’s so unreliable? It’s used because it has potential to be useful, but when it’s useless it only hurts the killer. What about lower rank killers who need it more? 
---
&gt; We don't need to encourage people not to use Noed though
---
Nobody is really saying that. Just that if Ruin worked the same way, or better yet, if they were reversed, Ruin would be an actual strong reliable perk.
---
What blood point update?
---
I shake no and hit the wall usually if I'm gonna give you the hatch and you wiggle. I do that twice and if your ass is still wiggling, I save a Yellow Mori for such occasions.
---
Yes. Cleansing dull and hex totems gives you points towards the Lightbringer emblem, same as generator repairs. It also gives you BP in Boldness category so general and Boldness BP offerings work with it.
---
Dude last time I got a streamer rank 7 in my lobby and checked that he was streaming first thing I did was close the damn browser and play the game fairly even tho I did bad that game lol and all of the survivor survived the survivors still flamed me except the streamer...
---
Stop being reasonable. Don't you know where you are!?
---
Thank sucks. Thats a lot of play time, but like that, at least if a survivor DCs you get a bonus as killer, I don’t think it prevents your daily’s completing either but when a killer DCs it’s pretty nasty for all survivors.
---
Are you delusional? Do you suffer from a mental illness? YOU ACT AS IF THEY WERE PLANNING ON DOING THAT.  Your comments all imply that. It's a bug/glitch. Deal with it.
---
A gen can go in 90 seconds that's a minutes added on to the gens being done within the chase so at least 3 gens done in that time. Are you ok
---
Scratched mirror is map pressure.
---
It causes players be me more alert, it gives him Undeniable vision in a 32 meter radius, and that means he doesn't have to search behind or around anything. First hit, and maybe all hits are free on the indoor maps.
---
He may be slow, but being able to see through walls is better map pressure than 115ms.
---
*DS is in shrine rip tunnelers.
---
There you go fam edited for accuracy.
---
Nice.

I love Peekaboo Myers.  I don't know why they got so salty.  I enjoy playing against him.  I'll never understand why people play a horror game and don't want a horror movie experience.

MY FAVORITE IS WHEN I SEE THE AURA IF ANOTHER SURVIVOR BEING CHASED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP AND GO INTO PHASE 2 AS CLAUD SLOWLY CROUCHES UP FOR THE UNHOOK!
---
Maybe uninstall the game and reinstall? Check keyboard settings? Maybe its just not responding
---
So I never said it was every trial. But it does happen. But we can move on from that to another scenario then since I will admit that specific scenario is rare. I was trying to point it out from a survivor side so I didn't face the old "killer main" accusation. With that being said I'm sure even you can admit that playing as killer it is just as annoying to face a group of survivors running adrenaline as it is to face a killer with NOED. You can do almost everything right but lose pressure on gens. The last one pops, adrenaline activates, and now the game has completely changed.
---
Just because somebody sees something a different way doesn't make them a troll. I understand randoms don't typically cleanse totems which is quite annoying itself because by now anybody besides new players should try to. That's why I run small game. I don't trust others to cleanse them so I go out of my way to make sure I take care of them. Most of the totem spawns are quite easy to remember on most maps so I don't really waste a huge amount of time. I cited Inner Strength as yet another way totems are being pointed at as something important.
---
If NOED activates and the killer downs the person they are in chase with, don't go for the save. You're asking to get hit with it then as well. Don't open the door right in front of the killer. NOED or not that's a bad idea. And I'm gonna be brutally honest on your last point about the downed survivor. That sucks for them for sure but doesn't really affect me. I'm not there to make sure you survive. I'm concerned with my survival only. As far as the free kill as a reward. Really? Does it bother you that much that a killer might get a kill? Are you really that petty? As long as I pip I couldn't care less how a killer gets his kill. Whether it be me dying to NOED or a teammate. If they are relying on NOED more than likely I did enough in that game to get a pip so who cares?
---
How many totems are on a map? I always believed it was 5-6.
---
That's just paranoid at that point you might as fucking well use enduring every game. besides most ds will run object as well meaning the obsession could be the one with ds. It doesn't make ds any less op it adds tones of time just waiting and in that time just as much gen progress will be done
---
You forgot the shit post flair dude
---
good survivors will hear it most of the time. Thats how I mostly find totems on school map.
---
I have headphones, but for some reason I still can't hear their footsteps.
---
We’re on Xbox. The marker was stopping in the zone. I’ll have him check for a game setting on his TV like the other reply says. Maybe some screen latency issue.
---
I do stuff like this when I am completely outclassed by survivors.
---
HELLO I FEEL AWKWARD HAVING TO USE ALL CAPS DUE TO THIS FORMULA. I TOO AM VERY ANGRY OVER THESE LONG QUEUE TIMES AS A NEW PLAYER, WHAT IS THIS CHANGES THEY MADE THAT CAUSED THIS?
---
Yes. Just wait for reset on the 13th
---
One of the 1st killers I played as. And still one of my favourites to play as
---
Am I the only one thinking bubba has one of the best ones?
---
I JUST WANT LEGION TO BE BUFFED A BIT LIKE HOLY FUCK REVERT THE VAULT SPEED AND IM GOOD!
---
I didn’t say there was anything strange, just that killers can be guilty of bullying certain survivors in the same way that survs do it to killers a la flash lighting wraiths relentlessly. I’m saying both are pretty shitty.
---
I’d just suggest DC’ing at the very end of a match and not killing anyone
---
Yes please make flashlights even more useless somehow, I love being forced to spend hundred of thousands of BP on worthless crap when leveling my survivor.
---
I love when people say NO'ed is unfair... But yet are running around with Self Care and Borrowed Time. Salt must be in the water everywhere ;)
---
So now instead of just running DS I need DS and Tenacity or even unbreakable with it. I'll be honest, I don't want an entire perk build just to stop being tunneled, I'd rather that just not be a viable strat. I didn't think it was controversial to advocate for anti-tunneling and anti-camping mechanics beyond a slight penalty to a killer's rank.
---
That's what I try to do, but for whatever reason I just can't hear their footsteps, even with headphones.
---
Nah. Claudettes are out there doing gens.
---
Damn

Could be! Newer model Xbox? Could be just a bug in DBD Xbox Servers.

Also you said it only works being tunneled I proved it wasn't and you said yes that is how it works, I got downvoted how now you fucking agreed with me you acustic child
---
I don't really see what the point in doing it in the first place is.
---
I agree. I find nothing more activating then seeing survivors toss down pallets when I’m several meters away, but it doesn’t even matter because if I break it they just blind me.

I don’t think you’re getting it.  I’m not saying “just change your mentality.”  I’m saying it doesn’t matter whether you didn’t mean to disrespect, it will still be taken as such.  Just because you used a racial slur without realizing it doesn’t mean someone won’t be offended by it.

Gens take 83 seconds to pop your saying wait 60 seconds on top of the chase time just under the assumption it might be ds. That's 3 gens for one hook why am I the one being down voted no matter what you do ds will drag the chase around at least one set of gens depending on how many people are left alive. If that's not op then what the fuck is noed? I don't even use that shit ass perk.
---
But is it really worth using up a perk slot just to counter it?
---
Perhaps
---
If you’re dumb enough to blindly chase them instead of checking gens, yeah it can add that much time. I almost never have an issue with the new ds cause I don’t have tunnel vision (no pun intended)
---
Yea, the killer is better off having it wasted at pallets than survivors using it for hook saves. You can often bait them into using it more by standing at the pallet for a second while they try to aim for the blind, evade, fake walking away, come back, break pallet, take the blind and keep chasing. Do that a few times and there is no more flashlight.
---
I'd rather they improve the p2p we have now instead of dedicated servers.
---
Maybe that's just me but so far dedicated servers are not very promising
---
I play a lot of killer I'm a 50/50 player and I actually can't admit your point on how devastating Adrenaline is in my games.  The reason, I play aggressively and to apply relentless gen pressure.  Most of my loadouts are designed to slow down gen repairs while becoming more efficient I'm chases.  The vast majority of my games end with gens up so Adrenaline doesn't really come into play.  Goal is to finish with 1-2 gens every game.
---
I have absolutely nothing against a killer outplaying and killing me or any of the other survivors.  I'm not petty at all and will message a ggwp afterwards.  But NOED is skilless and just annoying to see someone can play so poorly and be rewarded with zero effort no skill downs.  I never mind if matchmaking was jacked and I got a green rank killer or something I expect it up there but when you see Red Rank Spirits still boosting their way through games with the biggest crutch perk left in the game it is annoying and sad to me.  They're the reason I run Small Game in half my games.  
---
Your mentality of just looking out for you is unfortunate for your teamates I try to be better than that but again I don't ever attempt potato saves against NOED gamers.  I just leave too but it still doesn't make what happened to that player any less shitty or feel anymore earned by the killer.  Also the game in general is in such a healthy spot for killer.  We haven't needed NOED to rank up since like 12 survivor nerfs ago.
---
i like this but spirit and especially nurse would have to be nerfed to compensate for the fact that they have very easy early pressure with how easily they can end chases. nurse doesnt need any more gen pressure
---
Just had a killer DC as I escaped and I got no survival points peeposad  🥺 So ready for dedicated servers, I’m sick of this shit.
---
One word: Ochido.
---
r/murderedbywords
---
Gg eeeez
---
When killer is shy hehe. Susie got better skins tbh
---
Seeing where people are at if you can't catch them defeats the purpose of map pressure. 🤷‍♂️ Most people that play this are alert to what's going on around them in game. The people I play with and against are at least.
---
Permanent tier 1 Myers really only works well on Lery's memorial and possibly Hawkins lab. But if you play your memorial/Hawkins offering and the survivors play any other map offerings and you don't go to Lery's/Hawkins then you've basically shot yourself in the foot.
---
Thank you for posting this. I feel like the most complaints come from "mains". People who never play survivor don't understand their gameplay or tactics, the same as people who never play killer. Until I started playing survivor I was guilty of this myself. The best cure for this antagonistic community is for everyone to be 50/50 players.
---
 Then maybe people would understand that most things they hate about the other side are either punishments for their own mistakes, or simply them using a perk/item to their advantage.
---
THERES NOTHING WRONG WITH THE GAME, I'M JUST BAD AT IT
---
Yeah?
---
Maybe.
---
Franklin's counters items in general and brutal strength makes break actions faster. Why wouldn't you run them. If you know all survivors have items run Franklin's if you have perks that synergie with brutal strength (pop, surveillance, overcharge) why wouldn't you run it?
---
Also I make a game out of getting 4 stacks of BBQ as quickly as possible, which makes it a better game for the survivors because they're almost guaranteed I'm not going to tunnel on anyone because I want those easy bp.

[This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/c0kdec/farming_etiquette_proposal/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) is a pretty good summary of the general guidelines for farming.
---
Dedicated servers if they are not getting the cheap ass servers are very very good for the game. They can monitor the game waaay better and improve player experice significantly, queues would benefit the most since you have a bigger pool in a single area
---
So how would he have leatherface if he just brought the game
---
Fair point, but it still gets on my nerves to no end.
---
Dude, what you do is slug, then leave that guy on the ground and chase someone else. That way, there’s three persons not doing gens. Guy on the ground, guy you’re chasing, and guy who is healing guy on ground. If you slug someone and stay on top of them without picking them up like a moron, you deserve to be genrushed.
---
Look man I’m not that other fella I knows he ain’t gonna have LF at this moment I just thought you were generally surprised
---
I just play Ghostface so I can join in.  Sometime did I’m getting looped super well,  I just start teabagging during the chase.  I’ve even had people just drop the pallet lol so it actually helped sometimes.

Do pigs eat bones?
---
exactly. with this and the old system, people werent having fun. but how on earth does it make more sense to make it so that 3 people (at least) wont enjoy the game instead of 1? how is the enjoyment of 1 person worth more than the enjoyment of 3?
---
with that logic, low rank killers playing against high rank survivors is just a way for them to learn the game. how is it fair to put low rank survs with high rank killers so that they can learn the game and get better, but its unfair to put low rank killers with high rank survivors so that they can learn the game and get better?
---
NEW PLAYER WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU MISS TEACHEABLES MULTIPLE TIMES? DO THEY APPEAR AT 45/50 OR CAN THEY APPEAR EVERY LEVEL?
---
See, you seem to think that DS is invulnerability which it isn't. Getting slapped with DS puts you in the dirt and allows the killer to take a look around or go on a little sight seeing adventure. Maybe even go for the lad who unhooked you while you taste what delicious kind of dirt the red forest has to offer. Your team is punished because both you and who unhooked you isn't on a gen, maybe someone else decided to try helping too and didn't get the memo you were covered.
---
Your team doesn't get a gen done, decisive strike expires, you progress to the next hook stage, killer only benefits.
---
I'm sorry to say the word you're looking for is "addiction." If it's to the point of affecting your *physical* health, you might need professional help.
---
It would also let killers know if people are around. I honestly see it as the most balanced of them.
---
Of course but unfortunately not everyone is like you and again while I understand your grievances what this is now is still the best solution. 
---
And might I add, while you do constantly avoid the killer to not get chased, lower ranks literally freeze and hide whenever they hear the terror radius of the killer, including stopping gens etc. You would have to keep up that style of play to fit in and be those actual low ranks, accompanied with never hitting great skill checks and never pushing through ruin (If the killer has it for whatever reason). 
---
While what you're doing is admirable, it's in essence not what you should be doing, and should that really be how the game is for you? I don't think so. While this is the best solution and for now the *only* solution, this also stops the outright bullying of lower rank Killers and survivors who have smurf accounts that they play with higher ranked people that they normally play with to get lower down killers. This makes the game as healthy as it can be and with less toxicity. 
---
This, above all things, is a necessary evil.
---
Thank you, This helps a lot!
---
DbD is my example subreddit to show that having memes allowed is great and if they weren't, the sub would be a boring mess of arguing and announcement threads.
---
As killer, you have the opportunity to choose perks and add-ons based on what you the survivors carrying. People put on Ruin or Franklins when they see toolboxes, why wouldn't you choose perks to counter flashlights if you think they'd end up being a factor?
---
Are they already leaked?
---
Hooking someone?
---
Haha yes
---
That’s why they didn’t release it with the stranger things dlc and other issues of course to
---
Didn't they address match-making by making parties go by the highest rank and not the average?
---
No I honestly sometimes have the longest games
---
Lol no way this could happen but id love it, a skin at most if he even mentioned the game
---
Most of my lobbies end with GG's all around.
---
it's the, I want to say MTV or Netflix?, TV show of Scream
---
With the rank reset I've been getting a lot more gen grabs as ghostface lately
---
A bit offtopic but that backdoor escape daily seems like it should be rewarding much more than it is, 19k blood for 2 hatches is terrible compared to the relative ease of the other 2.
---
Who takes videos with their smartphone
---
**VERTICALLY**
---
Assuming that crouching as communication always means teabagging.. of course that's a terrible comparison.
---
I think a big reason that companies do this (and I'm not defending the practice), is that it costs to list something on the marketplace. If each cosmetic was listed individually, it would cost them a lot more than it does to have 5 or 6 options for in game currency. I don't necessarily think that all in game currencies were created to be predatory, it just allows them to introduce new content without all the red tape of the actual marketplaces.
---
At least you know she's 16
---
Mind if I use this for an edit? I’ll give credit.
---
Yeah, I'm getting beat up too, just for mentioning a possibility. Didn't even say it happened, just said maybe this...
---
Honestly if you experience it this much you're gunna want to think about the common denominator. Maybe try to enjoy it despite what's happening. You have options.
---
Except I'm not arguing for any of those things. All im saying is that having colour blind options would not give anyway an unreasonable advantage. Sure it might help, but it would be so fucking minor so as to be irrelevant. The amount of games you'd win by using colour blind mode would be incredibly minor. And I think that yes it's worth it to sacrifice a tiny amount of 'balance' in an already wildly unbalanced game to allow more people to enjoy it.
---
We should try and allow as many people as possible to enjoy the games we play. Have a little empathy for these people.
---
STBFL tends to work *slightly* less well with killers that can one shot. I would suggest Bamboozle for the truly epic vault speed.
---
Could you upload images of the individual cosmetics
---
I'm willing to relocate.
---
1050, havent been playing very actively for the past 6 months or so
---
Bring in a mori offering, the perk devour hope or tombstone myers then  meet the requirements to use it
---
Yet I loop the crap out of killers and get called toxic, but the baby players who don't do shit get mercy lol (not trying to be toxic just joking around)
---
Leading the killer to the basement is another good method and the survivors get basement time.
---
Survivors have walked to a hook, pointed and then walked right up to me and crouched. That's the best signal I've ever had for "hook for points."
---
Nice repost
---
That's some shit
---
No one escapes death-the perk
---
Mori
---
I kill people if they wiggle off a second time, but I've had one to many killers carry me to hatch, drop me, then close it. Like ffs, if you're gonna kill me just kill me. So now I wiggle to like 80-90% so when they drop me I go free.
---
I don’t save them, I use small game and cleanse all of them. I run it with object of obsession and the killers usually ignore me cause they’re afraid ima loop them to death, but I just use it to help me know where the killers run to in the beginning so I can cleanse the hex’s first :) I love me some totems
---
As a survivor, i tend to be respectful to the killer and leave immediately. If he's in front of the door i would sit in front of him for a second then walk to the door to show respects. I'm a killer main so i really know what's toxicity in this game and i want everyone to be respectful of each other and have a great game. So i teabag only on teammates. And if a killer plays like a bitch, i pm them not to insulte them, i try discussing kindly and explaining what was wrong, and help them feel better. Same thing in life. If you're nice with other players, you'll get a ton of friends! 
---
:)
---
No clue, I'm on ps4, been playing since mid august  2018, am almost devotion 8 with over a
---
Have the survivors p3, every teachable, almost 3 survivors with every perk and every killer teachable except demigorgon.
---
Yes but for those people who take protection hits and for the people who run the killer around all game they are going to get hit more than 1 or 2 times.
---
It doesn't but i would advise against it, just follow the sound wait like 1 sec for the effect to wear of and hit them, unless their flashlight is shit and you manage to have broken the the pallete before the blind then you can hit them
---
I just wish each Legion character has different voices, both the guys and both the girls have the same voice
---
If you were just going to give him hatch anyways, why you mad? Same outcome, you can’t expect everyone to know what the killers doing, I’ve had killers take me to the hatch drop me then close it and hook me.
---
If anybody could give me a rough estimate of how long this would be around thatd be awesome thanks
---
Your probably right I just feel like every killer build has either pop, ruin, or corrupt intervention.  The killer usually needs to have a gen slowing perk.
---
Fair enough man.  I don't think you were being defensive.  The discussion got more sensible as it went on and I can respect your position if that's how you feel about the perk.
---
Im sure using the SFM models and renders of Demo Steve and Nancy are also illegal, but nobody complains about that. (I know that people generally use the sfm models to make transformative content and art but its still wrong)
---
2,350
---
If they wiggle just hook them it’s easier.
---
I'm not saying the gens need to be slower but I do feel that the game is always in the survivors favor, especially if they bring meta perks.
---
I have been noticing the same thing, usually just with great skill checks though. Make sure his TV is in game mode. Make sure the lobbies you are in have a good connection, if your ping is bouncing between red and yellow or higher your gonna need to account for that too.
---
Just tell your friends to "git gud". Killers have been hearing that from survivors since they bloody released swf. You're just an entitled survior main, nothing more.
---
I mean... you are self promoting.
---
im afraid im not a survivor main :(
---
That’s a funny way of spelling “crouching in the bushes in the corner of the map”
---
Nurse herself is fine, I think her add-ons need to be reworked though. same with the spirit, prayer beads need to be changed.
---
Still entitled.
---
honestly ive never understood the hate towards SWF groups. i personally have the most fun when playing against them
---
2021?
---
so basically DBD is a game where friends shouldnt play with each other... got it, lol
---
If you chase a single person for 4 gens that’s on you..
---
Change your mentality when it comes to how you take it. Do you whine like a sore loser? Or do you just accept it and let people have fun and just try and punish them for it. 
---
Also I was saying I can make it clear when I am respecting someone when crouching and disrespecting someone when crouching.  And it has been well received.
---
You just can't compare non verbal crouching in a game to a racial slur. Do you really need me to explain that one?
---
Its a game. It is both played competitive and fun. Maybe i'm crazy to think you need tougher skin if you're going to play online anonymous gaming against real people. Legitimate disrespect isn't being taunted in an online strategy game where you literally are a killer.
---
My first game as survivor on switch was against a fucking hag that only had Ruin. 
---
I swear, I have never been more angry in my life at a game. God damn you stupid kids who cant possible play without your precious crutch of a perk.
---
+1 for knowing comparing is not equating
---
Lot of people uploading "dropping a survivor next to the hatch just to close it and kill them anyway" videos, makes it impossible to trust the killer is actually trying to be nice or just be a dick one more time.
---
Plague is the one killer it’s bad on :(
---
Yeah, I also love his simplicity when I just want to have a chill game. It was the very first killer I played when trying out the game and really enjoy playing him time to time, even if he's technically weak.
---
Every last one of them gets grabbed off the unhook and then dropped and none of them have Unbreakable.
---
I wonder if this is similar to some of the issues with event gens. I remember that if someone left before loading in, there was a chance that the gen removed from play as a result was the event gen so there wouldn't be any.  Did she possibly have one of the addons that removes a box?
---
Also Rancor.
---
Yh ik, it’s just that some kids just use it on her cause it’s an op perk even tho it’s pretty much useless
---
yeah, im entitled for disliking being a burden to my friends :/ why am i so evil?
---
That makes sense on a superficial level,but there's a huge skill difference between a say a rank 14 killer and a rank 5 survivor,which would be an entirely possible match up with an averaged system.
---
# Just  stop playing as much it is all will power the power is in you.
---
Where did I ever say I messaged or communicated back in any way?  All I do is move on, but when you complain that people are salty while doing a well-precedented BM action you really come across as either arrogant or out of touch.  You also fail to explain how you communicate it differently, just a vague “they get me, I just know it” sentiment.
---
Also, someone else said it, but a comparison does not an equivocation make.  It’s in fact very easy to compare two social faux pas and the attempts to rationalize them, despite being different degrees of offensive or rude.  Imagine that.  It’s not about tougher skin.  I accept their are always douchebags and move on.  It’s about trying to rationalize douchebag behavior and getting fun specifically from being rude.
---
20 ish lmao
---
Don't forget the shit storm that was thoughtful Thursday.
---
Since the hit box is so huge on pc
---
When you get blinded but little do they know, *your wearing head phones*
---
Dwavid
---
That’s the problem, you’re playing on Switch.
---
What are you talking about babykiller instaheals are perfectly balanced and fine!  Here's 3 reasons why.
---
1. Dude I'm so fucking with you instaheals are cheesy as shit lol.  I wouldn't bat an eyelash if they were removed completely.  
---
I've been having good success countering them a bit with lobby adjustments.  Anytime I see a bunch of medkits I assume instaheals and throw on Franklin's which hard counters them.  If I don't feel like running Franklin's instead I'll just toss a killer at them to counter them.  Plague is my go to for this though sometimes I'll use Legion.  Plague makes them unusable and Legion makes it so that only Needles have an effect Styptics just cleanse deep Wounds.
---
r/DBDGoneGay
---
I blind for points as survivor and hit for points as killer. Simple as that.
---
It's absolutely this. I had this problem x2 on my TV's and switching them to game mode fixed it instantly.
---
Lol in my defense it was originally for snapchat
---
You think I don't know that?
---
Wut lol. But at least he let you go. Last time I played Kate I was the last survivor left, and this one Billy downed me and stood in front of the hook with me on his shoulder just listening to the sounds Kate was making.
---
Lol... surprisingly it runs a lot better than PS4 version especially in handheld. Not a problem.
---
It’s hit or miss. Some days I don’t kill anyone and just fuck around. Most of the time they’re happy and enjoy it. Occasionally you get some angry person that flames you for not playing the game correctly.
---
Most people still enjoy having fun on video games, some take them way too seriously though.
---
This is a little off-topic but did you notice the “candles” are fingers
---
I respected the hell out of 2 survivors who body blocked a baby survivor for me. At first I didnt get it, but after one chase against the baby you could tell they were new. Experienced players would stop doing gens just to step in front of me while I was chasing the baby to chase them instead. Later on I'd just run behind the baby for a couple seconds and then do a 180 and give them distance. 
---
It's the little cues if you pick up that will make the game enjoyable for all 5 of us.
---
That's why I always 200% of the time check the basement if I lose someone nearby
---
No problem, wish there was a easier way to capture videos and have then directly on my phone
---
Self care is a shitty perk, Idk why everyone makes out like its a clutch perk. It's actually really bad.
---
Pig is best girl.  
---
Dont @ me.
---
If you do, you should know that a hard counter to pallet-flashing is simply using your ears, they gain less distance than they would if they didn’t flash, meaning you’ll catch them faster too. No need to change an entire game mechanic because you can’t/won’t drop a few bucks on a better headset
---
THE THING THAT PISSES ME OF THE MOST IS WHEN I HAVE A GAME LIKE THAT AND THEY STILL T BAG ME AT THE EXIT GATES, IT MAKES ME WANT TO FUCKING DIE
---
How does 1 work?
---
Here since day one 4 K hours
---
Other day i got unhooked right in front of the killer by an adam that was sitting in a corner with his U R B A N I M M E R S I O N instead of doing gens. When he went down right in front of both me and the killer, i tbagged him and i got tunneled to death even after DSing. Messaged the killer that i was baggin on dwight and not them so there were no hard feelings
---
Yeah lol
---
In the same game, the Bill started running towards a hooked Nea. I knew he had borrowed time, so I crouched. (I was playing pig) The Nea got unhooked and asked to be healing by the Bill. I downed her again and she insta-dc’d.
---
Had a 25 mins Hag game earlier today, like 30k points because Hunting, Deviousness and Brutality were all maxed out. Sacrifice got pretty close but last two guys were only hooked once. With a brown offering +  rank 2 BBQ and Chilly this ended up being 60k. Survivors earned 20k in average.  
---
It surely dragged out at times but it was a fun game overall.
---
Hail Nurse Calling!
---
I love it when people DH for distance and fast vault directly into a bear trap.
---
Agreed.
---
Entity can suck my dick with it's being displeased
---
Feng is basically cardboard
---
100% this, and then you have assholes who figure out who the babies are and go after them first because they are easy prey.
---
mori them
---
I agree, I only mentioned it in the post to show his full build.
---
Self care basically donates pressure to the killer and it takes forever, better to just do a gen tbh.
---
Just a question - what kind of business model would you propose to continue the support of the game if the cosmetics were cheaper/available for shards? When I ask myself how they'd do it, I don't really have a solution. The game is 3+ years old, and unless you're buying on Nintendo Switch, there won't be a huge influx of purchases to the base game. DLC is expensive to make, and only offers incoming cash 4 times a year. Purchasable cosmetics are easier to make, and offer quick and high returns on investment.
---
Do I feel like more outfits might sell if they lowered the price? Definitely. If they cut the premium outfits in half, they'd have to sell twice as many though, and doubling the number of people who are willing to spend extra on cosmetics isn't an easy thing to do. I don't have any research data on what people are willing to spend, but I'd suspect that they've done some kind of market research (or hired someone to do it).
---
I get the whole "it sucks that I have to buy this cosmetic" feeling. I was hoping the most recent Kate cosmetic was available for shards. I kind of view it as clothes shopping though. I don't buy every shirt I like in the store. I only buy it if I can afford it and if I think it's worth the cost. The cosmetic store is the same thing. I love the new Nurse cosmetic, and I can afford it, but I'll almost never see it since I play in first person. (If anything, I feel like the killer outfits could be cheaper because of this.)
---
I speak from a developer point of view, but not from one in the gaming industry. I've worked for companies that are well funded, and others that are severely underfunded. It's expensive to hire developers in Canada (where both BHVR and I are), and you want to be able to hire good people when it comes to something like this.
---
I love my anti gen rush build: Ruin, PGTW,Discordance,Overcharge . Had plenty of DC’s from this build lol.
---
I'm imagining that dead hooked survivors would kobe themselves off brokenly and then maybe patrol around where they died or the killer could tell them to stand guard or something.
---
If you would've left out the babykiller in the first sentence I wouldn't have caught on so fast lol. They for sure need to go along with ebonys. I usually will do the same with franklins. Always fun to watch them try to run back to their med kits. But lately I've been working on getting the adept killer achievements and my god is it frustrating running into insta heals.
---
My family is literally dirt poor.  Maybe it has something to do with me playing on Xbox.
---
Doesn't take off the fact that facing them is really boring, i dont care if killers are balanced or not at this point
---
My favorite thing to do mid chase when ds is active is just jump in a locker because then he's got three choices. 
---
1)Wait 45 seconds until it runs out and waste so much time
---
2)Take me out of the locker and eat the decisive
---
3)Go try to find someone else
---
I actually saw a hack when you were in the boat, bird flew and told you right where TTV was. Nice bird hacks noob.
---
Yup, had this a few times too
---
I heard the PS4 version is very buggy unfortunately.
---
I DONT THINK SHE WAS BAITING ME BECAUSE ONE PERSON WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP DOING NOTHING, JUST FUCKING CROUCHING, ANOTHER PERSON WAS NEAR ME, AND THE LAST PERSON WAS ALSO DOING NOTHING
---
There is no reason to trust the killer since people can be so toxic, so mayaswell wiggle.
---
Is it just me or were cakes and ebony moris super common on ghostface blood webs when he first came out?
---
I saw something like this with demo on one of my discords
---
Being poor sucks, and I know this sounds dickish, but they definitely shouldn’t change game mechanics because a handful of people can’t afford decent equipment
---
It does not double it. It increases the base amount you got. So if you got 20k, double event would give you 40k and adding streamers or something like it would increase the amount to 60k. And getting 4 stacks with the perk would increase it to 80k.
---
&gt;Many of  of DBD david's outfit though is too similar to outbreak David.
---
That sounds fucking badass. It'd be really cool to witness that !!
---
I think that'd be cool too! I'd love to see that
---
Next time Pig is nerf BHVR will make sure to kill her completely and after that when we'll pronounce PIG in BHVR's direction they will laugh and respond "who is pig?"
---
Next mid-chapter patch notes:
---
-Removed all the Reverse Bear Trap because rank 18 survivors call those op
---
-Pig will now hover on the ground when crouched
---
-Pig is op because she can hurt people so we replaced her blade for a hidden plush that she can use to hug survivors
---
-When Pig will ambush she will choke herself to death while trying to roar
---
-Fixed a bug that somehow caused the Pig to win a game
---
Yeah that was my understanding of it.
---
That would be great actually for Amanda's Secret. One trap, no key, they can escape through the gates and hatch but they have 2:30 seconds to do it
---
I.... I don't know what that means ;-;
---
the only Mori thats too strong is the ebony
---
But the pig slit Tapps throat in the first Saw movie, it literally is a “Saw” death. Granted it was John Kramer not Amanda, and Tapp didn’t die, but you get what I’m saying.
---
The tier list. Huntress has respectable thickness
---
No, fuck that queer shit. Clown is best girl.
---
I already have 3/4 perks and I don’t want caulrophobia so I guess I’ll wait another shrine for something
---
What the hell is hag doing in C tier? Sis is literally all bones.
---
Oh... I'm stupid
---
Wait what realm is groaning storehouse?
---
I'd really like to see Candyman come to life in this game
---
And killers complain that ds is op
---
I really enjoy the art style!
---
Unfortunately they can, which is why the whole friday the 13th fiasco happened. But you're right about the cosmetics part, I'm hoping for that to happen too
---
Camping is still camping, no matter the situation. But it just makes sense for the killer to camp at this point in the game.
---
LIFE. AAAAHHHHHH
---
I’m screaming and crying right now BHVR wouldn’t do this.
---
-Demogorgon 
---
-Stealth killer
---
Choose one
---
Didn't say it did.
---
Nea is not that good looking
---
True. True.
---
Why is that an actual sub
---
Also she's not "fat" thicc she's more of a (lord forgive me) "sexy" thicc
---
Well if they just keep delaying it they'll never actually have to release it 🤔
---
This should be tagged as +18
---
Wagon Gorgon
---
&gt;Except I'm not arguing for any of those things. All im saying is that having colour blind options would not give anyway an unreasonable advantage.
---
If that's true, that's fair, but that's not really what I was addressing with my comment.
---
I made the point that balance takes priority to accessibility, and you seemingly didn't understand why someone would think that. I think the examples I gave illustrate why it's a bad idea to not be black and white about it.
---
If scratch marks were able to be like green, every killer would opt for that because it would make the marks easier to see. I think that's worth considering when making a change like this.
---
I understand wanting everyone to be included, but that simply isn't a reasonable expectation in a competitive multiplayer game.
---
It really doesn’t. I’m at rank 13, and it only takes 2-4 minutes. It’s not that bad.
---
Well, Legion is the kitsch killer of the game, Susie's just the kitschiest.
---
remove nurse calling and the deer perk
---
add make your choice and noed
---
I'd swap deerstalker for make your choice or maybe tinkerer
---
&gt; promotes other playstyles than camping and tunneling
---
That's aura reading part that promotes anti-camping playstyle, not bonus points
---
This is what I thought each time Kevin showed up in screen
---
This is like saying ptb ghostface was stealthy because he didnt have a terror radius,
---
Sure he doesn't have a terror radius, but it doesnt really matter hes really LOUD. Survivors will still be aware of his presence, he has a global audio que whenever he uses a portal, and if a portal is too close to a survivor they'll hear him emerge, and his footsteps are loud as heck too.
---
&gt; That's the risk you take when you run a strong perk, It's a strong perk because despite the risks everyone runs it.
---
In hopes it will actually be useful, which usually isn’t the case. Which is why we are talking about it. 
---
&gt; I tell you what, lets buff decisive strike also then. So you can stun the killer when grabbed. Lets remove all RNG, You fine with that?
---
This is false equivalence and pointless. Not saying get rid of RNG, and you can use decisive when grabbed already. Besides DS isn’t RNG based perk, which is why it’s so good. 
---
&gt; The game is already killer favored in lower ranks.
---
How so? It’s lower tier so neither should really know what their doing unless they’re smurfing. 
---
&gt; Ruin is already a strong perk.
---
When it works.
---
This list is weird. Spirit is definitely not thicc whatsoever, unless you define thicc as having tits and an ass and being moderately attractive. Same for hag, she's the opposite of thicc. Pig should be like two tiers higher on the list, and Meg should be a tier higher.
---
Can we get an f for the deaf dbd players
---
Half of this sub belongs there.. tbh
---
Where are you taking him?
---
Exactly, and how is that fun for anyone?! I'd rather get looped with a decent chance I'll eventually catch them, than have someone who once they break eyesight just hides around the nearest corner.
---
&gt; Had plenty of DC’s from this build lol.
---
If that's your idea of fun, sure.
---
Is there a difference in hit box? Im pretty sure its just because the killer can flick his mouse and get the hit.
---
Keep posting more of these meme concepts
---
Dude, they kind of have to
---
but i just got told earlier that noed is for bad killers and honeslty i cant use make ur choice
---
I think it should be reworked with just the speedboost. The faster movement is what makes it effective, the insta down is what makes it annoying or feel unfair.
---
I think make it "when exit gates are powered gain a 1/1.5/2% speed boost for each totem still active." For a max of basically a permanent Bloodlust 2 at end game if survivors never touched a totem.
---
This would encourage survivors to still cleanse the totems but not make them feel screwed over because they only found 4, as well as still make the killer threatening at the end if survivors ignored them even just partially.
---
Yeah Nea used it already :/
---
I verbally lol'd at that last one
---
Oh, ps4, on pc I get a match in like 10 seconds rank 1
---
Not exactly what everyone's talking about
---
oh, i didn't even notice the initials! that's a good question, actually. i wonder if it's something we'd find the answer to in existing lore or if that will come with the Archives.
---
Still seems op to me
---
Maybe I’m just salty,  but when I think they missed I’m always hit.
---
It's only fixed on paper really, matchmaking is still pretty bad from what I've seen
---
Bonus points are easily promoting anti-camping playstyle. More unique survivors hooked=less tunelling and less camping. If you want those points, go hook more people.
---
WAH!
---
You forgot huntress aka the thiccest killer
---
 I CANT GET MY PERKS I BOUGHT FROM THE SHRINE AFTER 20+ BLOODWEBS AND IT FRUSTRATES ME SINCE I ONLY PLAY FOR 3 WEEKS NOW
---
I thought there was a dispute about ownership with Friday, not a sale of rights.
---
Yee hot, did you get to make it out? Oh. Third down. At least you 360d him.
---
Ok. This is pretty epic.
---
How to get those
---
Yep. Just like Ruin should be reworked and something needs to be done with the gens at base level. I seen another person commenting how gen tapping is BS because killers have to commit to seconds to kicking a gen and a survivor can tap for a millisecond and all that time is wasted.
---
Small things like that and the point system holds this game back from being even more engaging imo.
---
A little tangent, but I want the blood web to be split in 3 trees: perks, items, and offerings. Price them accordingly, I'm sure perks will see a rise in price but I think a change similar to my suggestion will benefit players of all levels. 
---
Anything to encourage more playstyles even a little bit.
---
Oh shit I also main doctor and play on ps4
---
Personally, badass factor Legion wins, orgasmic satisfaction goes to Huntress
---
Ewwwwwww gemma Collins
---
Toxic survivors it's a 24hrs video, to be in a nutshell
---
The yellow wanderer robe+the egyptian hat is a great combo. Along with the prestiged body and egypt hat
---
My first hook but I died in it :'(
---
NOED is really up to you.
---
On one hand it can be a clutch and get you a win late in the game.
---
On the other hand you shouldn't have a build that relies on you losing, ideally your build is good enough to stop them from getting that far in the game anyways. NOED doesn't activate in the end so why not have a perk that works the entire time and stops them from getting to the end in the first place.
---
By way of the game being rated M she is 18.
---
To be fair, David, Bill, Tapp, Jeff and Ash could easily murder all of Legion except maybe Frank.
---
90% of the time it's this. They love to make their little dicks feel bigger :P
---
IMO still not worth a perk slot. Inner strengths best moment is right off the hook with DS and at a high rank you don’t have time to wait around for DS to wear off and use iron maiden. Plus gen speed is wayyyyy more crucial to try and slow down with four perks.
---
Iron maiden is really just kind of a fun perk in my opinion once again.
---
I personally like the sea goat hat with the green wanderer outfit
---
Hahahahaha!!!
---
This. I actually love being pallet blinded because the survivor is staying closer to me.
---
Something similar has happened to me and 2 friends of mine. We just normally spent our bp and the next time we played our bloodweb progression was gone, but we didn't get our bp back.
---
Well yeah... personally, i'm using these two just cuz some killers play with no respect. And i hate how people still complain about Ds even after it's been nerfed so much. Not that i'm complaining, i like the new Ds more. Bt is good just for camping/tunneling killer or for the endgame, and you as the rescuer will still most likely get downed. Then the rest is as you said, they are good perks. Nothing wrong with using them. The same goes with Ruin, Bbq, Pop etc. Then there's noed to which i have my own opinion, but if they actually ever considered nerfing it, i think it should be just that the survivors get the exposed status effect right when the gens are powered, not after the killer hits someone. But yeah, Ds and Bt won't, in most cases, give you benefit if the killer doesn't play dirty.
---
spirit isn't that thicc, nurse is much thiccer than her
---
or maybe it's just the clothes idk
---
K
---
me too! it's so fun to goof with them, especially when we both know i can't catch them lol :)
---
The amount of times this has happened to me.
---
Thank you! That helped a lot
---
If it ends up not being a new killer I hope  we can get that chainsaw as a skin for Billy/bubba
---
Yeah in my experience people who play survivor tend to be the altruistic types that enjoy playing with others while killers tend to be fucking neckbeards who get their jollies off finally feeling powerful for once in their life. I used to not be tilted in opinion but enough games on both sides tells me that people who wait in killer cues for 15 minutes at a time do so because they prefer to just act like assholes over getting into a game more quickly.
---
The guy dropped a pallet on my head, but for some odd reason, it didn't stun me
---
*Laughs in Electricity*
---
WE HAD 2 GENERATORS LEFT TO DO AND ONE PERSON DEAD.  I GOT PUT ON MY FIRST HOOK AND WATCHED AS, LET'S JUST CALL HIM "FUCKBOY", SELF-CARED IN THE DISTANCE.
---
NOT LONG AFTER, OUR OTHER LIVING TEAMMATE GETS PUT ON *HIS FIRST HOOK*.  FUCKBOY IS STILL SELF-CARING.  WHEN HE FINISHES, I WATCH IS AURA AS HE STARTS RUNNING IN WHAT IS BASICALLY A CIRCLE IN THE DISTANCE.  THE KILLER WASN'T EVEN THERE.  
---
I DIE ON MY FIRST HOOK.  THEN SPECTATE AS OUR OTHER TEAMMATE DIES ON HIS FIRST HOOK.  FUCKBOY IS STILL JUST RUNNING IN CIRCLES.  EVENTUALLY, THE KILLER FINDS HIM AND WE ALL DIE.  
---
I'M ANGRY ENOUGH TO POINT OUT TO HIM AFTER THE GAME THAT HE COST THE ENTIRE TEAM THE MATCH.    HE'S CONVINCED THAT HE MADE **THE PERFECT CHOICE IN THAT SITUATION AND CALLS ME A DEAD BITCH.**  HE TELLS ME THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO WIN WITH 3 PEOPLE AND 2 GENS LEFT.  **WHAT THE FUCK**
---
A need was identified and the demand was met
---
What would be more Ash-like than to go down swinging?
---
Reminds me of a time when i flashlight clicked at a pallet to show "hey i know it's fake" vs a Freddy. All fun and games right? This guy tunneled &amp; camped me and my friend to death because of that :(
---
It's a sad bubble that guy lives in...
---
You just HAD to
---
Fun for most killers in my experience is just the feeling of superiority. Maybe 1 in 10 killers are fun to play with and are good sports about it. Most of them just turn out to be greasy neckbeards with little dicks who talk shit post game or DC if you're beating them too hard.
---
Don't say that, she's just... Slow
---
Pretty sure it is one the rewards from the [Howling Grounds](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Howling_Grounds) event.
---
I love it when this happens. 
---
Last night we cleared 4 dull but couldn't find the Hex. We pushed through all 5 gens against Nurse. Myself and a friend ran the Nurse around the Springwood map (we are both currently level 3 and we both really enjoy going against Nurse), we got a door 99%, got a rescue, the door opened, Nurse chased the hooked and the rescue to the door and tried cutting them off, I came around to the door watching the chase, blocked her hit on the injured and we escaped. 
---
Game ended and we saw she was running NOED... Which never activated because we never cleansed the last totem, Ruin.
---
So fun!
---
Huh. TIL I need to get back to the gym XD
---
I think the game thinks you used the chainsaw again. But like 100x faster and without the animation lol. You got points for destroying the pallet. Unless it was a perk to break the pallet?
---
Yes, I am the dude who made the dbd dnd crossovers, just deleted my old account. :p

How I get so many errors

Long enough for it to not be broken
---
I recently saw a Meg in a DJ cap and a hoodie that should have stood out, but instead she managed to blend in with lockers, dark walls etc. in Gideon Meatpacking Plant. I'd stare at her for a few seconds and only belatedly realize that hey, that's a survivor, hit her! That outfit was a work of art.
---
How I only get the Sam error
---
How it's really frustrating
---
I was using Spirit Fury yeah, but even then, i should've been stunned by the pallet
---
I believe one of them won't be a killer but a survivor outfit instead. Unless they forgot to add the survivor skin's name in the files for some reason.
---
I hope you wanted to get downvoted cause that's most likely what you get
---
Then what's the problem with my switch
---
I frequently play trapper and haven’t had any lag/frame drops, couldn’t tell ya about demo tho
---
Trust me, I know.
---
But not again Nancy's.
---
YES.  IT'S ALSO A *SPECIAL* FEELING WHEN YOU'RE WORKING ON THE LAST GENERATOR AND YOUR TEAMMATE RUNS THE KILLER RIGHT TO IT.
---
I’m not aware about the leather face reboot nice to know I need to check that out ! But you’re right about the scream Netflix, I don’t know though if in terms of licensing, it’s not different from the main franchise.
---
Or everyone could just be not so sensitive about an emote.
---
I don’t know why you got downvoted, it’s literally the truth.
---
I dont need noed for pig. Some killers I do need it on like demo and ghost face cause I'm not really at a good level with them skill wise. I've become a pretty terrifying pig imo.
---
This is me the day I bought the game, playing Dwight and got Moried at 2 minutes

My typing speed when i have to roast the claudette that hid the entire match and escaped due to DS when she says "gg ez baby killer"

You can hit the share button, then square to save the last 15 mins of gameplay. Then you can view and upload it via your capture gallery on ps4

I'm very confused

"..." - Mike Myers
---
Yeah I like the switch too
---
My turn to post tomorrow
---
Sick repost
---
I get pretty much any perk from survivors I don't own or plan on owning.
---
RNG.
---
If you think you will always get amazing totem spots, you're going to have a bad time.
---
YEAH, LAST NIGHT I GOT IN A LOBBY WITH A BUNCH OF RANK 20 SURVIVORS.  I WAS LIKE, "FUCK IT, I'LL JUST BRING A KEY."  
---
WELL, THE JOKE WAS ON ME, BECAUSE I WAS THE FIRST PERSON HOOKED AND THEY ALL JUST LEFT ME THERE TO DIE.
---
Come together isnt that strong, if a killer is someone chasing all the survivors at the same time then no ones on gens
---
some excellent wordsmithing going on here. 😘👌🏻
---
Cause there's 5 corn maps and one Hawkins map. You're just far more likely to get anything else.
---
Slug them until they DC
---
tiny boobs fucking rule tho :/
---
On PS4 you can go to the quick menu, Dead by Daylight, then Currently Playing With once in a lobby and just message the killer/survivors.
---
I prefer killer but I hook and go hunt, dont even proxy camp unless there's scratch marks. Its funny getting salty messages about how I'm supposed to hang out (to some degree) with the hooked survivor and no go clean across the map and hook another. Unless it's against Blendettes I usually let the last one hatch. 
---
Honestly think if you want to be nice to last person, once their last teammate dies - just put the controller down and go get a drink or something. If you get back and the survivor isn't hunting the hatch or popping a door, hook em.
---
I PRESTIGED NANCY, THEN DIDN'T GET A SINGLE DECENT SURVIVOR PERK UNTIL I WAS NEARLY LEVEL 40 AGAIN.  I HATE MYSELF FOR UNLOCKING ALL OF THE USELESS FUCKING PERKS.
---
no it should just work like survivor dailies where you just have to make x charges of A or B action. one full gen = 80 charges, one health state = 16 charges. So if you heal 2 x 8 charges it activates the perk.
---
But those bloodpoint stonks lookin real good
---
The inbuilt recording is really annoying to upload to literally anything
---
I played a custom game with the boys and brought Iron Maiden and spooky wraith
---
&gt; In hopes it will actually be useful, which usually isn’t the case. Which is why we are talking about it.
---
It is useful, people waste time cleansing it. You just aren't happy when they find it quick.
---
&gt;This is false equivalence and pointless. Not saying get rid of RNG, and you can use decisive when grabbed already. Besides DS isn’t RNG based perk, which is why it’s so good.
---
There are games where you cannot use it, since the killer will slug knowing DS is in play. The killer can turn your perk off if hes smart.
---
In the same way, Survs can turn ruin off, if they're smart.
---
&gt;How so? It’s lower tier so neither should really know what their doing unless they’re smurfing.
---
Survs need to know how to loop to stay alive, since they don't know that at low ranks.... they don't stay alive.
---
Killers don't need to mindgame if the survs are running in a straight line.
---
how’s the playerbase on switch?
---
DS is for the tunnel problem. You can’t ask the killer to not punish unsafe unhooks or survivors who just run into the killer because they have a primed DS to capitalize on their mistake. 
---
You’d only run Unbreakable or Tenacity for the pure slugging part of the issue you have. If you are getting slugged and your DS never goes off, the solution is take off DS and run something else but yes you should run an anti slugging perk becacuse of how it’s the only counter DS has for killer who don’t want to lose momentum for their plays. We already have multiple methods to discourage hard camping and hard focus. The fact that your teammates don’t properly follow through is a bigger issue. If a killer is just camping you then your team needs to do gens and if they’re not, it’s not on the killer to wander the map looking for nothing when they may know your team are nearby. 
---
There shouldn’t be a point where one survivor has every tool in the game to keep them from dying because there are four survivors and at that point you have no ability to do anything. You should be prepped for the most likely scenario: Slugging and Focusing. DS and Unbreakable. That’s two open perks for whatever else you’d like and unless the killer has a build focused for slugging (Deerstalker Knockout And Infectious Fright) then they’ve spend 3/4 perks for that because nothing can mitigate a DS stun aside from waiting the timer. The killer isn’t obligated to eat your DS just because you and your team made whatever circumstances that led to you getting slugged.
---
Will do, Shirtless David
---
Even if you can’t capitalise on make your choice having them exposed usually spooks them into hiding might slightly help with gen rushing
---
New player, what did MoM do before that was good?  
---
Well I bought him because I'm a big fan of the show, but if he weren't a licensed character I don't think I'd ever touch him with the current perks.
---
I dont think I have literally ever gotten a down using iron maiden's exposed effect
---
No it shouldn't. There is no reason red or purple survivors should ever go against gray or yellow rank Killers. It throws off the entire balance of the game and gives the survive with friends group that already have an inherent advantage... An even bigger advantage.
---
My guess is you've never who played as killer Beyond rank 15. All I can tell you is within my first three hours of playing the game I was going against red ranked survivors who made the matches absolute hell for me and nearly made me quit dead by daylight. For the last year on the game most of my matches were incredibly unbalanced and it made me very unmotivated to play killer. Thankfully I finally learned how to play killer right and don't get pushed around by survivors nearly as much but this is the best quality of life change this game has ever made in my opinion.
---
yawn
---
just sent a ticket, thanks for the advice.
---
I love playing coxcomed clapper and ghost soot I’d play kyf and just yoink them off gens
---
*Bold: +9*
---
PSA to survivors, chasing someone and not giving up on chase is not tunneling
---
Oh no don't get me wrong my point wasn't that make your choice is bad, my point was that leveling it to tier 3 is bad since you want it to reset as fast as possible and nurse, spirit can easily end chases in less than 40 seconds
---
Can confirm, devs tweeted
---
Dead hard is too buggy
---
Toxic ash perk?? All of ash’s perks are p bad since the MoM nerf. Do you mean DS, the Laurie strode one?
---
Actually I was a victim of this bug, and you'd see Pig walking so fast it looked like she had tier 3 bloodlust WITH Agitation, I'm not joking. My friends and I legit thought the killer was hacking.
---
Also balance should go before what you like. A lot of people think old decisive strike and mettle of man were fine and a lot of people think that Omega nurse is fine.
---
That's typically because they only play one side of things and can't see the bigger issues. Based off of your username I'm guessing you are more biased to the Survivor side of things. Nothing wrong with that but please be more considerate.
---
Lots of players have left the game or Community entirely because of this and I don't blame them. I nearly did multiple times. This change needed to happen. You can still play with your friends. Now your friends are just forced to play at their skill level instead of carrying a match and ruining the fun for the other side
---
I could go for a different monologue;
---
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. 
---
I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. 
---
I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
---
¯\_(ツ)_/¯ it works for me for the most part.
---
I just realized the demogorgons head looks like a pumpkin.
---
OMG One of the animations of my childhood good memory's  ...
---
and yea kind of accurate lol
---
Omg
---
M1 Billy?, no offense dude, but he's on Hawkins, what's he supposed to do.
---
Running into multiples because she's already chasing you to the hatch and now you're surrounded by Hag phantoms in the basement of the meatplant not knowing who or where she really is anymore akgkakgk
---
I've gotten it surprisingly often, but I know it's just chance.
---
I love that the shirt changed to RIP lmao.
---
Or you’re the victim of a mori. Or devour hope. Or maybe an unlucky rancor. But yeah, those two perks compliment each other’s weak points very well
---
Man i think i've seen this cartoon but i cant remember its name
---
Any jacket related outfit.
---
As you can tell I love me some Ace, David, and Claudette.
---
Also Kate's alpine wear is amazing.
---
No one escapes death-a really good killer perk that can be countered by cleansing all the 5 totems on the map
---
What killer is this?
---
no shirtless myers old man myers should be a cosmetic or the one from rob zombie with the hole in it
---
They didn’t exist in the 90s, which is the time period Danny came from. Also, if he did come from a time period when they did exist, he’d still probably use Philly for his selfies since he’s so attached to the camera.
---
You realise the majority of players are solo queue right? Even then, since DS was nerfed I've had 0 issue with SWF teams when I play killer and I'm always r1 after resets. Balancing the game around premades does not seem healthy.
---
The fact you called it Sugar Rush instead of Pills, Here!
---
So, would you say that quick and quiet doesn't trigger after you get 3 seconds? Also, why do you feel this is necessary?
---
P1 ash with the shorts is what I use and it’s worth it
---
Mind blown.
---
I have yet to get tier 2 nurses calling on nurse, wtf.
---
I've never get why the spirit was so angry all the time. Now I know its because she is on reddit.
---
This. This is good. Thank you, all of the guides I've read have not gone into this much detail.
---
im kinda 50/50 on it i dont mind it i kinda hate it
---
to be fair, you’re completely wrong
---
Bbq and tinkers a billy with not heart beat is fucking terrifying.
---
I run small game, my friend will run prove thyself. If ruin or Huntress Lullaby comes up I am off on the hunt.
---
Is nobody gonna a dress the Clown? He crushes the survivor’s skull, which makes a gross cracking noise, before cutting one of their fingers off, sucking it, and putting it on his finger-ring.
---
PS4 is a very, very active platform luckily. Have fun playing again tomorrow and enjoy those double bloodpoints :D
---
i have been thinking about that  for the catchphrase
---
Her sweater is just the right shade of white
---
I just quickly thought of this on the bus and I don’t think it’s necessary but I thought it would be a cool concept
---
 it would be an awful perk at tier 1.
---
I'm rank 8 all the time and if the killer doesn't have ruin *pop* *pop* *pop* *pop* *pop*
---
Yes please. We need more mindgame perks and less exhaustion / second chance perks
---
I've legit had it spawn in the fucking killer shack once.
---
I think it’s Spirit.
---
Why would it need this? Q&amp;Q is fine as it is, in fact you get it back faster than you would get stacks
---
I think i've got my point across enough. I really didn't want to have to spell it out. But here we are.
---
I obviously understand why lots of people frown upon it here. That is the basis of the conversation. The comparison did nothing except namedrop racism. 
---
Apologies for my 'poor reddit form'. If I think your reply isn't right I will downvote you. Especially if you resort to silly tactics. It's not really something I keep track of.
---
And i'm not afraid to say what I feel, especially in a sub and thread that is full of people who take teabagging as serious toxic behaviour. I'd rather help people see how pointless it is to get upset and offended through a game action. Votes really mean nothing to me and should not to you if you want people to think that what your saying is true to yourself.

I like toxic gg top on feng with her ruffled skirt and whatever head

Thank you so much!

142 started a couple of months ago in like the end of summer so maby july
---
Most wraiths I go against just camp every hook. Always around a corner just sitting there invisible.
---
Use it when you have a black ward offering, or when you get another. Add-ons are meant to be used so there's no point in saving them, blood webs are infinite after all
---
I don't understand why people are against this, it was a bug. Just run Agitation for the same effect. People complain that BHVR doesn't fix bugs, and when they finally do, y'all still complain...
---
I don't play death by daylight but I understand the woe of one time use rare items, but I grew to learn that if it just sits forever it's equally useless (unless you can sell/trade it). So I just any one shot item when it feels most convenient or fun.
---
Yea but the chances that it does actually make a difference is slim.
---
It's all down to preference, but there's a lot of perks that will have both bigger and more consistent impacts on the game.
---
Know the entity it has already and hasn’t sucked your dick
---
They’ll appear more in the later levels of the bloodweb, i suggest doing it when you have the add-on ‘soot’ ghost, with this combo it does two things
---
1. The survivors will not be able to hear your bell
---
2. Your red stain and terror radius will be hidden for 6 seconds allowing you to hit/grab survivors
---
APPARENTLY IRON WILL IS BUGGED SO IM MOANING LOUDER THAN A HOE IN CHURCH AFTER I GET HIT. GOTTA LOVE THIS NEW PATCH!

If you're not at least dev 1 you ARE new.

Nea’s perks allow her to escape the chase with ease, and Kate’s allow her to put up a fight.
---
My usual thing is I throw on good add ons when I just need a good game. Had a few rough matches and need a good one to kinda reset? Need some bloodpoints and have a pudding? Boom.
---
Or, I use them when I want to try a specific/meme build. If a build needs a certain add-on to be viable, save it for that build. Want to meme but not get completely stomped? Use a good add-on
---
God of war has kids in it, it's rated M for mature...
---
Walking dead (telltale) is M for mature
---
Borderlands has tina (who is 13)
---
Etc
---
When I P3 my killers or Survivors I only wear the P3 part because it just feels nice for some reason so that's why I kinda just dumped the points I had into him which I was saving for the demogorgon not that it really matters anymore as I already got him P2 close to P3
---
Lol exactly
---
Defend or vacate motherfucker
---
Pretty much why I don't play this gamer longer than a few weeks at a time. Killer feels too easy to win when playing against non sweaty swf teams with voice coms, and survivor feels like a losing battle in every red rank match
---
White Burial Kimono Spirit, especially on the Ormond Resort because she looks like a winter snow spirit
---
Julie's character outfit with the blue jeans. She's very unembellished and plain, which makes her a scary everywoman to me (like Strangers)
---
The Nurse's bloodied bodybag from the hospital. I'm terrified of needles, and it evokes fears of blood and surgeries
---
Meg's blonde hair with the athletic jersey. I see her as a bold upperclassman who takes responsibility for others as a Dwight/Leader alternate
---
Claudette's classic green botanical apron. It really shows the scholarly and intellectual side of her
---
Unlikely because of the way it's set up but there might be Xbox and Playstation in the future, PC people would wreck console people due to kb and mouse
---
Seconded. Not counting the fact that you can't run back in to save anyone, immediately leaving the match to me feels like I'm too big of a threat to chance it, and thus feels empowering or respectful.
---
This would be an interesting ultra-rare add-on. For it to be fair (at least, as fair as an ultra-rare can be), the timer would have to be *tremendously* increased, possibly by a few minutes, so there's a small chance a survivor with a RBT could escape (also, have it so a survivor can escape even with an RBT on so they can actually survive). Additionally, it should reduce the total amount of RBT's the Pig has just to avoid free 4k's. Additionally, jigsaw boxes could still exist, but instead of removing the trap, it gives the survivor more time.
---
But this is just an idea in response to a /s post, so it's just a fun concept.
---
Big brain time
---
CLAUDETTES BEING THE CROUCHING ONES IS JUST A MEME AT THIS POINT.
---
Definitely an interesting idea. Bus thoughts are like shower thoughts.
---
The trade-off is you can use multiple in a row but they regen slower
---
Damn, I just want the trophy haha
---
I have about 1200 hours. there been a few times where I haven’t played the game for months and there’s never been a point where I play the game 7 days a week
---
What rank are you? I haven't lost to a swf voice com tryhard team since like last year.
---
PC?
---
THAT'S BECAUSE YOUR TOO CLOSE.  YOU CAN'T GET THE RIGHT ANGLE FROM THAT DISTANCE
---
Clam slamming
---
I just so happen to be that demogorgon
---
Use all rare add-ons before prestige
---
Wait, you consider that “new”? Was I a new player this whole time? I’m only level 42!
---
It's Robin Hood done by disney
---
AND THE TBAGGING AND FLASHLIGHT SPAMMING
---
Pretty late comment lol. Since then, I've gotten to tier 3. I run BBQ, NC, Distressing, Ruin. If I can, I use iridescent king and the green distance addon
---
Accurate and +10 for the Disney reference
---
Tip: You can just do a circle motion with it and dont need yo hit it from side to side.
---
US East in Florida but thats not the issue this game hitches and lags like a motherfucker even when i play with people sub 130 ping
---
My favourite perk
---
It's not about the bugs honestly. Pig is a mediocre killer, and nurse is an insanely effective one. The community has been begging for nurse fixes forever at this point, but they continue fixing those that don't need fixes. 
---
I'm not saying you're wrong with your statement, but I've just told you the reason why people are upset about this. They're nerfing a killer that needs BUFFS and leaving an stupid powerful killer unchecked.
---
That looks like Ochidos old video
---
karma as in principle
---
Ok i’ll watch out for those, thank you
---
The most fun i get would be running from the cannibal because "You know what happens next"
---
Pretty sure the switch is on dedicated servers currently. As killer I get a ping bar lol. Seems fine so far. Haven't tried huntress but nurse on switch has been tolerable
---
Stopped watching when I saw NoED
---
yea, but thats for competitive only
---
i never once said that we should go back to the old system. not sure why you're bringing this up?
---
I get hate for running Nurse's Calling when they didn't catch on during the game and get far away to heal. I am totally breaking a chase to interrupt a back-rub session.
---
I got so many downvotes :p People, you need to snitch for your liiiiiiiiife!
---
Happening insanely frequently now.  
---
When I see a survivor just absolutely destroying a killer I've started thinking to myself 'bro just let him get a hit in or he's gonna DC'
---
THE FUCKING SERVERS KEEP KICKING ME OUT OF MATCHES. I'VE ALREADY LOST 4 RED KEYS THIS WAY, GOTTEN NO BLOODPOINTS, AND EVEN RANKED DOWN. IT FUCKING SUCKS
---
Do you even ever play survivor bruh.
---
sure. but i dont think SWF's are so bad that BHVR has to actively punish people for wanting to play with friends
---
You just confirmed you use noed therefore you suck
---
I mean, it's going into my Copypasta documentation, so sure lol
---
you realize the game isnt free, right?
---
I got so many downvotes :p People, you need to snitch for your liiiiiiiife!
---
we do custom matches whenever we're 5 :)
---
This. As a console player, you don't get anywhere near the same control with a controller (ironically).
---
So yeah, that's the ranking system. Rank 20 is the lowest rank, that's where you start. Ideally, when you're rank 20 you're playing against a bunch of other people that are new also. Unfortunately it doesn't always work out like that.
---
\-You could be playing against a SWF (survive with friends group) where someone low level started the party, but high ranked people are also playing on the team.
---
\-You could be a victim of rank reset. Every month the ranks reset (you don't go from level 1 all the way to 20, but the short version is you get knocked back down a few ranks to keep things interesting).
---
Please don’t tease me... I am so fucking stoked if this is true (pics if possible??)
---
Omg she hit the crouch button twice r u okay???
---
Pig or Demogorgon
---
Its not what the entity wants. It's all for the killer. 
---
Entity displeased but not Mikey boy
---
I’ve seen this before, a killer running spirit fury, he picked up a survivor and a person dropped the pallet, the killer didn’t get stunned but spirit fury was used
---
I find Discordance more effective than Ruin tbh.
---
Dont you fucking dare BHVR
---
This us why you should get the Soulja Boy Console Port it's controllers automatically circle the thumbsrick for you
---
never said it was bannable. I just said tunneling is a dick move and unfun. that’s perfectly reasonable mate, unless u want more tunnelers in this community or somethin?
---
The killer doesn't get a notification when a survivor goes in the basement. This only happens if the killer is using a perk called "Territorial imperative"
---
I play solo at red ranks and I still have fun. I don't take the game too seriously so maybe that's why. Ruin every game does get boring though.
---
Honestly, I've turned my messages off and only let friends message me. After playing games like overwatch and Dead by Daylight, it's much easier to just not see it than force yourself to ignore it!
---
Who is she?
---
Noed, facecamp and tunneling, you kinda deserved the 1 second "tbag"
---
Omg that feng was so amazing!! You should feel amazing that you caught her 
---
Can you explain what that perk does just because I won't be able to see the killer's perks?
---
If they’re running the perk territorial imperative it’ll let them know someone is in the basement, but other than that there’s really no giveaways.
---
If you search the chest in the basement and the killer hears you rummage or shut the lid that could alert them, or if you grabbed a save in the basement they’d also know. 
---
Hope I helped ya
---
I wish this would happen...
---
I usually wait to give then some extra bloodpoints but if they don’t come soon enough I’ll leave
---
I don't want her reworked though she's already pretty damn good
---
You can use them for other survivors. But you need to get the character that has the perks you want to a certain level
---
Have you not seen "Scary Movie"?
---
Yes you can. You have to unlock the perk in the bloodweb aroun lvl 30. For example... Claudette, if you want to get self care on everyone, you have to level her to 30 and keep leveling her till you see the perk show up. You'll notice it because it will be an orange red color.
---
You have to buy through your bloodweb until they’re reachable, once you reach a certain point it’ll tell you about teachable perks
---
She’s from the scary movie films.
---
I keep hearing about Tony Hawk. He ain't horror
---
There's a perk (don't remember the name) that gives an audio cue for the killer when someone enters the basement but it's very rarely used and other than that there's nothing that let's the killer know if you enter the basement. So feel free to go down there :)
---
Very helpful, thanks!
---
Killer only gets a notification if they’re running a specific perk. Otherwise, it’s just sketchy cause there’s only one exit and 4 hooks that never go away down there. Getting hooked in the basement makes it real hard to get out of there. Don’t be too scared of it tho, killers usually only go down there to hook someone they’ve already downed. And there’s always a chest down there, so guaranteed loot
---
It must be, I am seeing doubled posts
---
If you say so.
---
I live near an old auto shop/mini scrapyard owned by someone named David King. So that’s pretty neat.
---
WHY THE FUCK IS MY DEVOTION GONE DOWN TO LEVEL 1? NOW I ONLY GET SHITTY ASS 50 SHARDS PER LEVEL!!!!
---
I like it, but man it bothers me that it's backwards
---
If you want to get the chest, the killer will hear you searching in it if he is close to the shack. Another way a killer can see you is if he has the Huntress perk "Territorial Imperative", which granta vision on the survivors entering the basement. Literally no killer has it because it's really bad perk, so entering the basement is safe. It's just another area of the map.
---
Don’t worry we’ll save you
---
*Noed*
---
Aight we bout to head out
---
Get to level 40 on a survivor or killer to start unlocking teachable perks, then they start showing up  on other blood webs you get the first perk on level 30 then the next on 35 and the last on 40.
---
I HAD A SUCKY TIME PLAYING ANOTHER GAME SO I DECIDED TO TRY DBD. AS SOON AS I HOOKED A SURVIVOR I TURNED TO SEE A JAKE TBAGGING ME AT A PALLET. I LOOKED AROUND AND THE OTHER TWO SURVIVORS WERE CROUCHING BEHIND RANDOM OBSTRUCTIONS, READY FOR THE UNHOOK. THERE WERE NO GENS DOWN AND I HAD NO RUIN.
---
SURVIVOR PLAYERS LIKE THOSE ARE THE REASON I'M PLAYING DIFFERENT GAMES.
---
ON A RELATED NOTE, THAT SKELETON CAVE IN DARK SOULS AND ALL IT'S ONE-HIT KILL RESIDENTS CAN GO SCREW THEMSELVES.
---
When someone enters the basement you get a noise notification and you see the survivors aura for 3 or 5 seconds I think
---
I found the booty hurt camper 😂😂
---
you're not wrong, depends on what u playing it on. if u r on PC (in steam)  you can family-share urself
---
Yeah I don’t get why people are talking about him.
---
If the killer has that, he will see your aura (red outline) as you enter the basement and receive a noise cue.
---
SLOW VAULTING
---
Yea when someone tries to farm me without BT if Im in struggle then I'll just let go and watch them get smacked.  Like I ain't about to be your scapegoat kid.
---
Alternative perk idea: “Cindy, this bitch is messin up my floor” allows you to whoop the killers ass for 4 seconds.
---
YEAH THEY TOTALLY FIXED THE MATCHMAKING DIDN'T THEY? I'M TIRED OF PLAYING KILLER AND ENDING UP CONSISTENTLY WITH RED/PURPLE RANKS WHEN I'M RANK 14. IN FACT I'VE GIVEN UP ON PLAYING THE GAME AT THIS POINT UNTIL IT'S ACTUALLY FUCKING FIXED
---
https://youtu.be/gShL8rAmd94 watch this clip from one of the movies and see how it applies to DbD
---
I think I've played against some killers with that because I searched a chest, grabbed the item and THEN heard the terror radius, so they couldn't have heard me rummaging, but when I (quietly) went into a closet while someone got hooked, they came right over to that closet and hooked me. I wasn't leaving blood or scratchmarks either.
---
Solo survivor in red ranks is the single-most awful experience in this game. You'd have to dodge 10+ lobbies until you finally get fellow survivors that actually seem semi-competent, if you don't want a default loss because most "players" can't even do the bare minimum (repair gens, let alone through Ruin), and then once you do, it's fun add-ons and Mori time, since the killer also notices as much. Not that fun add-ons and Moris aren't also often enough in play with awful "teammates". Nurses and Spirits galore, as well.
---
I still sometimes play solo red rank survivor because I mostly play for the chase, and so I don't care too much that during my 2+ minute chase only 1 gen gets done, or that I die on first/second hook, but I do more often than not just play killer instead, which is a better solo experience the majority of the time. Well, unless killer queues are awful (which, they have been pretty bad for months now, because the ratio of people queueing as killer to those queueing as survivor has consistently been skewed off of the 1:4 ideal, with more people wanting to play killer and less wanting to play survivor - go figure).
---
VSCO girls are getting spookyyyy
---
Take my upvote
---
If you really want to say something (I hope it is something kind) you can drop a message on his profile.
---
You know that killer perks are supposed to be stronger than survivors perks right?
---
Even if it's not always the case..
---
I did mention him...
---
Did they teabag before the clip? Cause that you caught me teabag was nothing to get pissed off over. 
---
But man how tilted do you have to be to facecamp that long after tunneling and facing a team that had a disconnect. Just play the goddamn game
---
Basically don’t cleanse vs nurse or spirit unless you are 100% sure they are committed to an action
---
That's usually what I do if everyone still in the game is safe by the time I'm at the exit zone of the gate unless they were being an asshole then I'm not letting them get anymore points off of me
---
NOT. ENOUGH. CHASES. NOT. ENOUGH. HOOKS. NOT. ENOUGH. HITS.
---
Legion can be a girl. *Checkmate*
---
She teabagged cuz she knew she was dead there, she didn't mean to be malicious ir to piss you off. Get a brain, dude.
---
Oh. Didn’t see the edit.
---
Facecamp- For the tbag you mean??
---
NOED- These are my Wraith perks lol. Do you have a better suggestion on what perk to run? Yeah I’m sure Monstrous Shrine could come in handy. I don’t run NOED on my Billy or Plague, who I main, or anyone else. In honesty NOED should be nerfed but use what you want to win
---
Tunneling- You do understand you’re not entitled to get away because you got unhooked right? It’s only tunneling if I’m deliberately chasing them and ignoring everything else. Two low rank survivors besides Feng were left, and had to finish 4 whole gens. That’s not tunneling. Damn I’m a survivor main but these comments show me why killer mains are so fed up lol
---
They will have an orange version that appears at exactly level 30/35/40 and will remain in the bloodweb untill you get them (if you don't get the 30 one it will appear in 31 and so on).
---
When you unlock those orange versions then they can appear in other bloodwebs. That is how it works for both survivor exclusive perks and killer exclusive perks. On PC you can press F1 (on console it is the button that shows statistics, idk) and it will show the teachables in order of unlocking (for example hillbilly 30 one is enduring, the 35 one is lightborn and the 40 one is tinkerer).
---
Pig isn't that bad she's definitely not the worst killer in the game. She's probably the worst killer that's still viable but her kit is definitely way better than like 6 or 7 of the other killers. She just depends almost entirely on downing someone quick at the beginning of the game. If she does that she can snowball really effectively by slowing the game down with traps. If not, she's fucked.
---
That being said they really didn't need to nerf her (any of the last 5 times they did). Their priorities are just so weird that they go in and nerf one of their most popular killers to play/ play against while leaving so many other bugs and actually OP, not fun to play against shit.
---
Unless you're playing Nurse ho HO
---
Only if you can give it a haunted suit of plate armor skin.
---
No, I only tunnel T-baggers who sit at the pallet and I'll try my best to kill off the better players in the match first. Not tunneling, but if I saw two survivors and one is that good player and the other not, the choice is easy. There is strategy behind tunneling and it is effective, just not fun for the survivors. Having 3 instead of 4 players is easier for killers and is a valid strat in the eyes of a new player. 
---
Also, campers are trash.
---
Big.... Brother....   Ed....ward..
---
Yes, a rank that denotes skill level.
---
Dead By Daylight has ranks that denotes skill level that increases or decreases based on what you did within the match.
---
Is that not the same? I think not.
---
I decided to level up my Spirit during the event and have 46 of them left. Really wish I could have used them to get my Steve to p3 lvl 50 but the killer queues were atrocious.
---
I already saw this meme in the sub, people who steel memes make me sad :(
---
Stop. Please god stop.
---
Yup that’s why she sent me these [messages](https://imgur.com/a/65KSGmL) after? Obviously it was with malicious intent dumbass
---
I faced that problem too when I was starting out. In my opinion say ALL your addons until you gain more skill then you can put them to good use, plus if you wait you will have a whole stockpile of addons so you can afford to lose few.
---
Pretty good! Survivor games are instant and killer games maybe 2-5 minutes wait time. Last night it was less than that.
---
No it's one of the greatest memes ever
---
I would never forget fat boi ;)
---
Thank God you put a watermark on this.
---
Because you camped her idiot
---
So can dull totems become hex totems once perks activate later in the game?
---
I always thought that all perks the killer uses spawn according hex totems.
---
Trouble on Teabag Island...
---
Depends. If you already have it charged, do it. If not, just slash it. It takes roughly the same time for either of them.
---
Did you go into locker before or after they were hooked?
---
Credit u/chattywindow
---
Don't judge me but I use  a controller on my pc, when I'm playing dbd.
---
I don't find that there will be huge gap between the consol and pc when it come to dbd. Maybe just the nurse would be different.
---
I also solo que not always fun, but I stick around because of the times I have a good game.
---
YES PLEASEEE 😭🙏🏻
---
For real, Franklin's is one of the best.
---
Whens this change comin out?
---
I’m Kms rn
---
Wait is the bloodweb update out?
---
I went in it as they were coming down the stairs. The one behind the wall that's near a chest
---
To be fair, he *is* wearing a mask in a dark-ish warehouse.
---
Right? Nobody's asking for Pig to be nerfed (this doesn't just go for the most recent nerfs, this also goes for all the RBT nerfs they did too). They could be spending the time and effort fixing dying light, or nerfing prayer beads spirit, or adressing the massive amount of crashes in the last few updates. Instead, they took an already meh killer and just curb stomped her into the dirt.
---
Ty 😊
---
Xbox.
---
Never said votes mean anything.  Using it as a disagree button does exemplify the attitude of someone who defends teabagging as not rude.
---
The basis of this conversation is that you don’t understand.  You said you didn’t understand why it was demonized.  I’m explaining to you that people don’t like being taunted or BM’d.  You’ve found every way to not respond to that.  The argument of “just don’t feel that way” is remarkably out of touch with how humans work.
---
The comparison continues to prove its point too.  All common arguments to defend intentionally offensive behavior: “just have thicker skin,” “I’m not afraid to tell it like it is,” “I just don’t care what people think,” “it’s just a joke bro.”  Comparisons exist to draw parallels.  I’d hoped you’d be self aware enough to notice.
---
Your point has been obvious from the beginning: you don’t want to be called rude for doing rude things.  My only point has been that you shouldn’t act surprised when people don’t take kindly to it.  Feel free to play however you like, but don’t be surprised if it gets frowned upon.
---
Actually im quite killer sided, and constantly debate the killer side of things
---
 I think it would be better overall if SWF worked off averages, rather than either of the ways it worked before. If matchmaking actually paired you to an average ranking the system would be fine. 
---
Unfortunately, the games matchmaking pairs you to 5 levels above or below an average. A SWF with ranks 15, 10, 5, and 2 should face off against rank 8 killers. The issue is the matchmaking places them with rank 15 killers. The new system places them with rank 2 killers. Thats not any better than before.
---
The system doesnt need a change, it needs a fix. Being considerate to killers is great, but i think that the rank 2 is gonna be pissed no one is playing with him anymore because every game with his friends ends with failure. There are two sides to this game.
---
For survivors, I use all my good stuff (syringes, streamers, etc.) when I’m playing with a friend(s)
---
For my killers, I use them whenever I feel like it, since I don’t play to rank up, I play to farm and have fun.
---
If you DO want to power-rank as killer, then I would say stockpile a good 15-20 games worth of really good add-ons/offerings, and use them all in a row to try and push a new high.
---
If you’re casual, then whenever you go “I could use a fun game,” then just use it, you’ll get more :)
---
Because the servers will have a running cost
---
Basically.
---
Mmm mmm
---
Lol facecamping in my opinion is literally giving them the attention they want. Also wasnt facecamping enough without smacking them the entire time?
---
my point is that games like Overwatch restricts playing with friends when its in a competitive manner. i wouldnt mind if DBD did this too but it cant cuz we dont have other game modes or a non-ranked mode
---
bloodlust is pretty shit though.
---
I wasn’t pissed. I was laughing my ass off, karma sucks. And yeah she teabagged before the clip but I didn’t commit to her because I didn’t want to throw the game. But this 60 sec facecamp I knew I would 100% still 4k
---
That happened to me today and on pc.
---
They must have been outdated programs.
---
Yeah occasionally I get a game where all the survivors are TERRIBLE to the killer and I feel just as bad, I feel it's a little worse for survivor though because they don't get to play anymore.
---
It doesn't speed up the faster you do it lol, there is a pretty low cap.
---
[lol what perks here are better than NOED then?](https://imgur.com/a/DjOuvNv)
---
its ok just take my upvote
---
Even when less than 5 just to have fun and teach them. I don't see the big deal
---
and the way things should be done always benefits the killer or the survivor based on whose speaking.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
So is that why she teabagged at all the other pallets (there were ones before this clip) before the facecamp then? Lol dumbass not sure why you’re trying to defend this guy so bad, I guess shithead surv mains gotta stick together
---
Not unless I can get Elvis too
---
Duh, so does every single game that use dedis, but their DLC's and cosmetics dont cost an absurd amount. 
---
Note: A single killer game has 4 players + the killer, it isnt gonna be costly to do that compared to for example battle royale that has 100+ players in the same playing field. Hell even in CSGO u can get a server for 10€ with everything setup a month.
---
Obviously The Wraith
---
I am confused wether this is a joke, and why you are being downvoted
---
Really don't know how to judge your experience, but I'll throw it out there. Were you injured? It's super easy to hear people when they are.
---
Otherwise what other people said. Perks like whispers, nurses calling, BBQ, and territorial imperative could help find you.
---
Ikr it's so annoying
---
~~In most cases the survivors because the Devs are little bitches.~~ And that is why Oz is our Lord and savior, ~~the Entity~~
---
Definitely. I enjoy the meme for sure! The problem is indeed that she is getting the silent treatment. SAW is one of my favorite horror franchises, so this hits me on a personal level lol. It also goes with my argument that it's okay to leave minor bugs in a game that help or hurt a character as long as it doesn't interfere with the core gameplay. Lots of games have done this before and nothing bad comes out of it.
---
Oh so thats why people go bald sometimes.
---
Jesus why do survivors throw around the word tunneling so much, this isn’t tunneling dumbass. 4 gens are left with 1 already dead and 1 soon to be dead, this is literally the best thing he could do in this situation to leave only 2 survs left
---
Toxic Nea already touched that pallet...
---
when you can't count to 5
---
This has always been a thing on console
---
It's more like people ranting and arguing in the comments
---
So looping is provoking the killer? How so?
---
Probably cus no one playin it
---
It might have been BBQ because I was silent as can be entering the locker but once the guy got hooked right in front of me the killer coincidentally headed straight for MY closet!
---
Leaks By Daylight
---
Pfft this doesn’t happen. After the 11th game you say “fuck it” and change your perk set. Only to get slugged every game after until you change your perks back then you never get slugged again. Rinse and repeat until you throw your mouse and scream at your monitor how rigged this game is. The entity is always watching.
---
I started running haunted grounds against Nancys because they just can’t help themselves. And if they do know it’s haunted grounds and don’t cleanse, well that’s 2 less totems they get to heal with.
---
Yeahhh no you‘re dumb as fuck bud. If she knew she was dead then why did she teabag then run to another pallet? Obviously wanted a reaction
---
MY TEAMMATES LEFT ME TO DIE CUZ THE RECENTLY HOOKED SURVIVOR WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAT ME ON SECOND STAGE!!!!!!
---
Scary Movie sucks so no thanks
---
Ooh, really? I am gonna play Ghostface for the first time, I love the films! I have bought Ghostface and 2000 AC to catch up on killers!
---
There would be way too much shit in the tall grass.
---
I know that camp can be a strategy, but as a main Hillbilly, I can tell that you could earn way more bloodpoints than that playing without camping.
---
Plus, I play as survivor too, and being camped is so frustrating, u can hold the killer for 5 gens, get alot of BP, but being camped and die makes u lose 5k BP at least, It's really annoying.
---
Alright, it was hard to tell since the only teabag shown was hard to look at as insulting
---
"Can I copy your homework?" 
---
"Yeah, just change it a little so it doesn't look the same"
---
Nice repost my dude
---
Neither are half of the survivors. Dwights a pizza man, megs a athlete, clauds a botanist, neas a graffiti artist, ace gambles, feng min is a gamer, david is a boxer, kate sings, jeffs an artist, jane acts, and adam is a fucking teacher.
---
i think something with the update today fucked with some character progress last night because i experienced a reversion of progress on my clown
---
Why is it unlikely based on how it’s set up? With the friends system it makes it seem likely. 
---
Personally, I don’t think there’s a huge difference in KB/Mouse and controller. I think the two main differences are in playing huntress and 360ing... both of which are still possible with controller. People say nurse is easier on PC, but honestly after playing both I think the only reason it’s easier on PC is because of the lag that comes on console every time you blink. 
---
Plus, most games that have cross platform have an option to disable it(fortnite, new cod to name two off the top of my head) 
---
@OP: I believe BHVR said this past spring that they would like to incorporate it eventually, but it’ll be a long time.

I didn't run, I think it may have been BBQ.
---
I take it you haven't been against a group of 4 good rank 1's? Survivors at their peak are pretty overpowered, yea. Then through in BT, quad adrenaline, insta heals, SWF, etc. and it gets even worse. Even gods like Zubat and the like can't handle a coordinated group of good survivors (unless playing nurse).

Yes, because commenting on Reddit while I’m in class or at the gym dictates not going to parties
---
Sounds like he heard you or saw a little animation as you entered the locker. Other times its instinct like when i dont see anyone with bbq ill check a locker by where the gen was or in the direction i know they are in. Or the killer just likes to check lockers.
---
Mori time
---
As an Ash main, I feel it’s my duty to get others out- even if it means I’m gonna die in the process. That’s just the way of the Jefe, and I wouldn’t play any other way.
---
This is like the 5th time it's been posted now
---
Idk why people think abusing their R3 is gonna wiggle faster.
---
I didn't quite understand you. But it is possible to play with any controller on pc. Xbox controllers just plug in and play, ps4 controllers needs a program except steam games which doesn't require you for any other program.
---
*possibly
---
It’s nowhere near confirmed
---
Yeah the escape attempt thing is a trap for newbies, you should almost never use it or it should signal that the chance to escape is like 5%.
---
I literally just had a game where my ruin was cleansed within the first 15 seconds of a match.
---
Needless to say it was a short game.
---
*spacebar clicking intensifies*
---
Mad grit, killer perk
---
Yeah i didn't even know the David was there. Had me ded when i grabbed him. XD
---
That's just a perk called Mad Grit. Not amazing, but really funny looking and terrifying to be chased by that combined with Agitation lol
---
Tried that and same thing happened it took forever or it kept saying error after I restarted everything
---
Do you play on Xbox a recorded this by telling you Xbox to record that because that’s the only way I could think you recorded this
---
Only if its ps4 paried with xbox, and switch with mobile. Pc needs to stay on its own
---
Read the disclaimer at the top of the Perks overview article. It's a relic from older times that we kept on the Wiki.
---
Like you almost feel bad for him 😂😂 you know he was raging after
---
I actually get sleep paralysis, and I have to say that the experience would be honestly terrifying.
---
And so it begins Begins the hunt for the hunter
---
She teabagged cause she was cornered until he moved? And you're calling people dumb lol
---
These are powerful. First perk gives a stun And turns struggle into skill checks, a thing done people have been asking for because the button mash is annoying. 
---
The last perk is huge. Not only does it delay info but it spreads to other survivors? I think the unhook delay is great, but either no spread, or perk owner is broken for 30 seconds after unhook.
---
Ok now you have destroyed me lol
---
Oh ok, it didnt seem particularly effective its how buggy it made my character look and his ping when the match started made me question it. I'm starting to see a lot of weird crap the higher I climb
---
People like me don’t really care about stars too much, only really pips and bp, which you can both check at the beginning
---
So fix it
---
Damn I've never seen that happen when the timer isn't even 75% yet lol. I guess 99%-ing gates is the way to go for now.
---
One time I got a reward of the wailing bell as an offering, I have no idea.
---
Why you sitting here trying to argue facts? Also, quit putting words in my mouth. I never said any of that shit. Have fun with it all you want but fact is you sacrifice everything on Myers for a stealth build. The topic is "no other killers sacrifice speed or map pressure for stealth." Stay on topic my dude.
---
No survivors come from horro, they were created within the hooror based game called Dead by Daylight which includes them in the horror category. Ash, Steve, Nancy, Laurie, and Detective Tapp come from a horror based movie. Tony Hawk does not belong here. I'm pretty sure that is more than obvious.
---
If I were him, I would think u had DS, so I wouldn't go for u, but the unhooker...
---
You better start running before he gets tier 3.
---
I guess the entity really didn't want him to leave. That, or my secret tea bag of death technique.
---
That's one smooth criminal
---
No, this is correct.
---
I still find balanced landing the best.
---
I think she needs better perks but I also only started playing like a week ago so my opinion is super uneducated.
---
You got all the good ones. You can get clown for pop goes the weasle or wait for it in the sos. Other than that youre good
---
Underrated post lol 😂😂😂
---
Really should be the bullet time scene but sure.
---
There was 45 seconds left after I hooked them and went for kill.
---
He probably heard that from joe
---
There is no in-between. Sometimes it is well hidden, and becomes Hell on Earth, and sometimes it is instantly broken....
---
Nancy’s new perks also help for totem hunting.
---
I ain’t got time for Ruin—and it’s shitty I have to invest time in looking for the totems, but I’d rather get those cleared sooner. It also prevents NOED if I manage to clear all lol
---
I TRIED IT SEVERAL TIMES BUT ALL MY PIPS DISAPPEAR AND I AM STILL RANK 20.
---
I think it's a timer sync issue between the survivor that died and the host. If it hits some lag at some point it could have screwed with the sync. Netcode can be wonky sometimes.
---
When you enter a locker the killer can see your aura. Even if you enter a locker without sprinting the killer can hear the door squeaking. If a killer listens closely they can even hear your breathing when you're inside a locker. Did you sprint before entering teh locker? Maybe there were scratch marks leading right to your locker. If they stop in front of the locker the killer knows that you went inside the locker.
---
The easiest way to find out what the killer can see is to play killer (at least a couple of times) so you'll learn how to hide or run away from the killer properly.
---
I imagine you just sat around the hook and revved your chainsaw rofl
---
I believe you can disable your voice coming through on the recording. I know it worked for me when my friend used to do YouTube and I was in a video- I accidentally left the setting on and my voice just didn’t come through in the recording.
---
I would do main Brenda. This needs to happen😂
---
They just scared man. 😢
---
WTF its Huntress :D
---
Yeah, when I was referring to complainers I meant the oMg pIG nErFeD aGaIn wHy group. It was obviously an unintentional bug, so they fixed it.
---
Other games subs don't allow memes and those are really boring, the memes. I really enjoy the memes here! &lt;3
---
Plague!
---
I have fun in solo queue. Its the same stuff run the killer around albeit a bit harder but red ranks is still fun in that way. Core gameplay is the same just makes me think more and i enjoy that.
---
I almost want to say a perk like Leave Me Alone night let the survivor become the obsession for someone else. If they do, they get some benefit.
---
"Okay, now let that shit just mutilate her white ass and leave."
---
If it is an pink add-on or maybe purple it would be really cool, but if its too easy to get it becomes op bcs indeed most gorgons would just take everyone to basement.
---
Yesterday I was being chased, jumped out of a window in Haddonfield and got hit through a window after my character hit the ground. Mr. Fantastic as a Killer when?
---
I'm a pig main and I like to play the game to have fun, like legit try and make the game scary again instead of super optimal chasing but it's impossible with short games.
---
I've found that corrupt intervention, thrilling tremors and ruin to slow down games when used together by a lot. The last perk I'm still thinking, BBQ, Pop, Enduring, Haunted Ground, Surge or Thana. Not sure.
---
Her perks are decent, just not on her. Make Your Choice Hag is probably her best build. Surveilance is alright, especially midgame but Discordance is probably better. Hangman's trick just straight up sucks.
---
Oh I see...
---
Who fucking cares. Why do licensed survivors **HAVE** to be horror based? I wanna play as tony hawk. Fuck now i want Morgon Freeman, connor from DBH, fucking james bond, thor. I mean it doesnt matter what their background is bc literally anyone can be preyed on
---
I hit them as they were escaping with chainsaw and after I hooked them, I ran circles around the room (Hospital) cuz I need bp
---
Personally, I think the only thing that she needs changed are her add ons.
---
Are you talking about the rooftop fight scene? Cuz I’ll make one just for you lol
---
I agree with this post but the reasons for or against make no sense. Which only makes me agree more, LET THE MADNESS TAKE OVER!!
---
CRAWLING IN MY SKIN...
---
they prefer just playing normal games when we're less than 5 :) im not gonna force people to do something they dont want to do
---
the music at the end is so fucking funny to me and I don’t know why ajhdjdiwndnf
---
Looping is toxic? Self care is toxic? Are we living in 2017? As a red rank killer with a thousand hours in the game, I almost never camp or tunnel, yet I still get 3K's and 4K's. You either need to pick a better killer or deal with losing every once in a while.
---
We will be honored if you would join us
---
I can’t I’m in class
---
Good to know
---
I like it but they'll just point instead lmao
---
Laughs with urban evasion.
---
Just fuckin ollied the widow and wall ran across lmao
---
BVHR needs to start makin some phone calls. If they can get stranger things, I don’t see why she can’t be DLC Like ash was.
---
You only have so much time left before it happenes, farewell my friend and goodluck.
---
Its best to send a support ticket, they will probably give you your bp
---
I was trying to figure out a better pink add-on than the one they added, and this was something I thought might work in it's stead.
---
They’re not prioritized. To use the Insta-heal you’re supposed to push the secondary action button during the heal, which usually is whatever button you have mapped for skill checks (I’m PS4 so it would be L1).
---
Imagine thimking you have an argument then being shut down so all you have to say "Who cares?" 😂😂😂
---
It runs fine, but leatherface and freddy domt exist
---
What would you change about them? I just would want her dash to actually be useful tbh.
---
You basically played so your mate escaped! gg and move onto the next match. You did well.
---
I think its a really cool idea :)
---
Lel aight, i'm assumimg you're new to this. First of all stop using the word "toxic" to describe game build-ins, doesn't make sense and besides toxic is such a misused term in this community that it has lost it's actual meaning. Second, survivors won't give you a free kill after 3 escaped cause they pity u, instead some will try to make it even worse for u, so there is no point in trying to be the "good boy" so hard. The only times i give hatch are generally when there are DCs or when they're so bad that i don't even feel gratitude in 4k'ing anymore, but if they try to wiggle out (or generally give no sign of collaboration) i just slap em on the hook, end of story. And btw, don't get mad about this shit, it's not worth it, you shouldn't expect survs to play by your rules, and you shouldn't play by theirs as a killer. Listen to what i'm saying or learn it the hard way, game after game, trying to be a "nice", non "toxic" killer.
---
Would be fun but it feels like it would make too good of a basement build.
---
Its almost never used but it does exactly what he said. Gives a visual and audio notification to the killer that someone entered the basement when he is X meters away.
---
Yes but there's ranks in DBD and they are an indicator of skill, that to me and to everyone else, is a competitive matchmaker. 
---
It's not unranked like Quick Play or Casual in OW or Siege, so what is it? 
---
Ranked.

It is not. In fact, best use of it is pairing it with an ex perk, like lithe.

Thanks for the advice! I'll be messing around with my monitor's settings as well, I can create profiles, so I'll keep a separate one for DBD.

YES SOON WE WILL HAVE THE WHOLE SUB REDDIT FILLED WITH BABY DWEET MEMES
---
I met some good friends and its pretty much been my main game for the past year, except when resi 2, kh3 and dmc5 came out, also played a bit of bo4 but otherwise dbd with friends a lot.
---
Man a few days ago I was playing wraith for a ritual, and the team I went up against were complete shit, bombing hooks and everything, terrible hiding, even a bitch DCd cause I was 'camping'. So I decided to give the last one (Nancy) the hatch. Problem was, she kept wiggling and running away from where it was, even though   I kept signaling that I gave her mercy. It took about 20 mins to keep smacking her in a good spot were I could get her to the hatch. It felt like I conquered the world after it though.
---
Only the 5th? I swear I’ve seen it more times than that.
---
I'll give you that one 😂
---
Inb4 "They didnt even try. They let you win".   
---
No, they actually tried to win and run away all the time
---
False, the survivor isnt teabagging enough
---
Yeah, look, if you’re gonna almost outright steal a meme, don’t do it on the exact day the original was posted. Because, uh... people WILL notice.

That always happens to me they literally spawn right near it

And horror. Twice

Lol dont do that

Hyped as fuck for the Epilogue outfit next Wednesday. Already got the Cells to cop that shit instantly.

I just realized it was actually 16 attempts oops!

Ive gotten out of eveygame ive ran plunderer bc of keys
---
You want to make the game scary again, play scratched mirror Myers on indoor maps, especially Léry's.  Monitor and Abuse reduces your terror radius to zero, and the line of sight blockers allow you to sneak up on survivors who aren't paying attention.

---
It's always legit scary when you run into your first one and you didnt know she was the killer
---
I haven't done one adept... what would you say Is the easiest killer to get adept?
---
It’ll always appear once you’ve purchased the Teachable perk.
---
"new to the game" ruin and nurses calling lol
---
The one time you would use it is when everyone is dead....when you cant use it. And the game instakills you instead.
---
Fine, you got 2.
---
To be fair killers break stupidly quick 70% of the time so i dont blame her
---
It never really functioned.
---
Exactly what I tell my teammates almost every match. “Come help with this generator!!” “I’m working on totems for NOED”
---
Not sure I understand the egotistical "I never get a win so let me flex" comment at the end there.
---
How do you record like this and play at the same time? I am confusion.
---
Well, licensed cosmetics are always going to cost money.
---
The last batch of cosmetics were actually better at being available for shards than previous sets. The following characters had their most recent outfits available for shards:
---
Dwight (not including today)
---
Jeff
---
Meg
---
David
---
Ace
---
Jake
---
Adam
---
Jane
---
That's 2/3rds of non-licensed survivors who had outfits available for shards.
---
For killers, 3 of 11 non-licensed characters had outfits available for shards:
---
Wraith (not including today)
---
Huntress
---
Plague

Dying light is a Zombie parkour game this is Dead by Daylight, but I get your point they do really need dedicated servers.

Also Matthew Cote wanted him in first. Not us. We're just going with it bc it would be neat
---
Yeah, that’s reused from Haddonfield for sure. Quite a fair bit of Badham is reused from Haddonfield, actually.
---
I would have to stop running and give them the succ. =(
---
There just needs to be another mandatory objective. Cleansing totems, even with all the encouragement to do so (NOED, Inner Strength) still isn’t enough. Fuelling gens, connecting a cord to the exit gates, bringing a fuse from one area of the map to another... anything of the sort would be better than the current state of gens. Gens go too fast without Ruin for Killers, and playing against Ruin is annoying for Survivors because it just makes gens more tedious than they already are.
---
Or how about a dead version of you Haunting you for the rest of your life saying “no no no” over and over again?

I didnt steal shit... havent browsed this sub in a while, wanted to add myers T-posing in the picture and a nea but I'm on holiday with my phone so I dont really know how to add that
---
Pro-play? Lmfao dude DBD has never and will never be competitive
---
Dead Hard is a distance perk, not a dodge perk. Use it like a distance perk and it's the best, use it like a dodge perk and it's crap and easily counterable.
---
Wrong again. Ghostface has to be covered up **head to toe** so we down drown in cum
---
pro play in dead by daylight? are you drunk LOL
---
So if there are 2 rank 1s a rank 7 and a rank 19 rank 13 killers should be treated with that? You get an advantage playing SWF anyways, I think the top is fine
---
Spam butt dance = fuck you scrub/heal me, asshole 
---
2 quick butt dance = thank you teammate 
---
2-3 slow butt dance = thank you killer
---
Yesterday, i downed the last survivor right after closing hatch. She was running around a corner where i had already sacrificed the other survivors so there werent any hooks nearby. After i picked her up she started wiggling so i took her to a nearby exit gate and hit the lever right before she wiggled off. She instantly started powering the gake because she thought i was being friendly then i grabbed her off and took her to a hook that was now in range. :)
---
The thing I love most about all the Claudettes out there cosplaying bushes, killers always get so fucking confused when they find a Claudette that can actually play the game
---
I see a variation of this meme at least once a week, but it never fails to make me lel.
---
You can be happy that you have bloodweb (yes we dont have bloodweb on mobile) .And  everyone is complaining about the broken matchmaking, but on mobile there is no matchmaking at all.
---
They should change escaping to be around 3000 and make getting survival more possible doing things such as not only mending and healing and struggling but unhooking yourself, using an exhaustion perk escaping a chase after being hit and escaping a chase instead of boldness. Maybe 50 points per window and pallet vault during a chase idk
---
Im new here could you exolain whats the deal with ghostface tomorrow?
---
If you let tbags bother you I’d hate to see how you’d react to serious things. 
---
Players do this to get a rise out of you. And you gave them what they wanted. You showed your insecurities when you could have moved along. 
---
And not to be rude but you body blocked to secure that down which is a strat with wraith but they hit you with DS and out played you.  It HAPPENS.
---
I appreciated this meme, even though others don't.
---
Ah, the ones who are never in my survivor teams.  But I know they exist, because they're in every killer game I play.
---
Fuckin called DS being in the shrine four hours before it reset lol.
---
I remember how naive I once was, when they first announced that each chapter was going to come with a set of themed cosmetics (an idea which they've kind of abandoned by now sadly, some Stranger Things cosmetics for other characters a la L4D would have been cool), I initially thought they'd bump up the price of the indiviual chapters to maybe 15-20 bucks but it would include the whole chapter and the whole bundle of cosmetics, make each chapter feel even more like a big event. Little did I know that 15 bucks wouldn't even get you the chapter and ONE of the cosmetic sets. Lmao.
---
I'm not going to lie, I've still put quite a bit of money into the game but I think it's absurd that they used to put out packs of multiple cosmetics for less than 5 dollars and now a single outfit costs double that. And the auric cell exclusives.. yeah. I can understand for special things, like licensed ones and even select ones for each character. But now it's almost every single one. The new Dwight skin is my biggest thing, like... there's literally no reason for it to be purple rarity at all, let alone auric exclusive. There's nothing special enough about it for it to be priced that way.
---
The trophy is now almost unattainable
---
I dont know what you mean by that since this build is stupid and shouldnt get any kills without people giving theirselfs to Be sacrificed. Althrough they teabagged me and looped me for godsake how long.
---
Whats heard?
---
Yeah now you just have to suffer crashes and errors every other round. It’s great!
---
I don't really know if this is a bug or a feature, but it's cool as fuck
---
Then you are part of the problem. Disconnecting is bad no matter how you look at it, in any game, in any form and under any circumstances unless you’re being harassed by some bug or glitch.
---
Not gonna lie I play on Xbox and PC and the killer has left right after I run out of the gate before, but this has never happened to me, unless the game got broken from this update, which has happened before because, well. BHVR.
---
Hopefully it gets addressed soon since the BP event is right around the corner
---
I wanna say that they need to start fixing their game first but we all know that will never ever happen.
---
Bring
---
Back
---
Thoughtful
---
Thursday
---
I dont think they do. I literally JUST got out of a match where a Jeff dropped one and it blinded me, and I was the survivor on the killer's shoulder. But I still didnt get dropped.
---
WHY DOESNT THIS HAVE MORE UPVOTES
---
I forgot to even mention Mori's. I barely used them when playing killer but after going against them I'm pretty much gonna make sure I never use one unless it's from DH. The absolute least fun thing I've ever endured is going against a nurse with ebony mori.
---
It's crazy what another perspective will do to you
---
Did i say i dc? No i said i can understand why she did it.
---
YOU DON'T HAVE A _BLOODWEB_ ON MOBILE?  That's one of the biggest parts of the game
---
Apparently every strong perk is a crutch...
---
Also, it is not that powerful against skilled players (those who don’t miss skill-checks and coordinate their actions).
---
The memes have gotten boring too though, there needs to be more of a balance
---
On the spirits map I managed to hit all survivors over and over with frenzy and kept it going for like 2 minutes lol. After they told me they were pretty new to the game and were swf, and that it actually scared the s*** out of them because they never knew where I was and just kept mending so they didn't go down.

How about when you carry a survivor with you, it collapses the portal on both ends?

Could also have the addon itself reduce the number of charges of the portal so it couldn't be utterly abused.
---
2083 at the least
---
Nice bait
---
Did u see the pic tho lol
---
Dwight holds his belly like something is touching there ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Bc nurse is way better on pc and survivors can 360 crazy good on pc as well. I **do not** want to play aginst that shit on ps4
---
"I hope you understand that I'm a higher rank than you and shat on your faces"
---
And us console players are still wondering where optimization is...
---
The only time I “teabag” is when I meet up with other survivors in the beginning of the game
---
yeah i know i was making fun of him
---
Repost?
---
The photography on this is great! Captures the look of the game perfectly
---
Thank you for good recommendations!
---
I agree. 
---
Some games like gta v gust doesn't feel right for me to play with mouse and kb. On the other hand I play overwatch and pubg with them and it's great.
---
If you see a tier 3 perk go for it, ittl get it out of the bloodweb indefinitely. Eventually all that will be left are perks you dont have
---
I know...
---
Honestly, the entity can go take a walk.
---
That is one of the hardest achievements in the game, getting it seems far better than a double pip
---
You are most likely a new player so I'm just gonna say it. Fuck off.
---
Get over it. You were pretty toxic too, not sure what you are trying to achieve here.
---
Well they’re not actually leaving, there’s just some kind of connection issue after the trail where it says for the last survivor the killer has left when they’re definitely not. It’ll say for the last survivor that died or escaped the killer received 0 BP and disconnected but for everyone else the killer got their points and didn’t DC. Good advice though killers better for Bloodpoints plus BBQ, another solution: just don’t be the last to leave or die as survivor because then you get all your points
---
I assume killer skins are worked on first cause hallowed blight is sort of about killers mostly plus you can go real crazy with it being about killers mostly
---
That's like 5% of the survivor playerbase, if that, my dude
---
*Devs stands over you T-posing* "Dedicated Servers coming soon."
---
Bruh.mp4 they were all rank 1. They got -1 after that game, so it shows rank 2.
---
I see, according to replies I'm gonna watch good players then. Thanks for the input.
---
Legion
---
BUT WHAT ABOUT SA-TIS-FAC-TION
---
I bet she doesn't have the age to play this game
---
And what if you could decide if you want to play with crossplay, like in Rocket League
---
Not trying to achieve anything
---
Ik what killers are getting hallowed blight skins, but what about survivors? IK Dwight and Claudette probably won't get one since they got one last year, but who is?
---
I used zedge. Quute a few dbd ringtones there
---
New perk
---
Spectators Reluctance
---
You have a disliking for others who turn a blind eye towards your troubles.
---
When you are put into the dying state, reveal the aura of any survivors in a locker to all other survivors for 2/3/4-5 seconds. 
---
Or
---
At the beginning of the match, gain 3 tokens
---
When you are put into the dying state, Spectators Reluctance consumes a token. Reveal the aura of any survivors in a locker to all other survivors for 2/3/4-5 seconds.
---
&gt;so it shows rank 2
---
Which is why it clearly shows rank 3, right?
---
damn, killers have it good apparently, have you tried looping yet?
---
I think they need to reverse the nerf they gave her traps. Being able to escape with her trap on your head is a load of shit honestly
---
As a Claudette/Nancy main who hates hiding, I can confirm that many killers have swung through random bushes after losing line of sight.
---
Yeah. I wonder what could have happened. I imagine they'll be giving people some sort of an apology token, like a free 100k BP or something
---
She looks like she freaking on the pommel horse at the olympics. Imagine the mind game possibilities
---
Das me
---
Maybe. I mean I'm not devestated, she was only level 14 ish but still I had some really good rng in the bloodweb
---
Doin gens. You?
---
I already did. Oh yeah
---
Ok one of em is rank 3 but the bottom one dc'd so he got -3 pips
---
Yeah, my personal build is Ruin(hag teachable) to slow down gens while I set up portals, Enduring(Hillbilly teachable) and Spirit Fury(Spirit teachable for chases since demo chews through pallets, and BBQ&amp;Chili(Leatherface teachable) for points and map awareness. I hear people get good results from Surge and Make Your Choice(pig teachable). Just remember that Exposed and other on-hit effects do not trigger from Shred. This also applies to Surge.
---
True. I just don't really find resilience that helpful. While it is. I still feel slow. Sometimes I really need to hide my tracks. I normally run lightweight over it. 
---
The thing about urban, it helps me save people of hooks. Offcourse, I don't over use it like immersive players do.
---
So you are flaming a huntress for dcing after their ruin got broken.. on an indoor map with near 0 hatchet potential? yikes.
---
I actually really like Spirit’s mori, as it makes me believe she’s expressing her built in anger from what happened to her on other survivors
---
This is a known bug. It’s been reported on the Official DbD Forums and is being looked at.
---
Link to full video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhhpvy04ng8
---
How the hell would you improve p2p, do you even know what p2p is. They can’t stop people lag switching or plug pulling as long as it’s p2p.
---
Yeah I was unaware there were any other Scream parodies, there’s definitely a lot of goofy chase scenes in Scary Movie, but this isn’t one of them
---
We have bloodshop instead of bloodweb. There are two separated bloodshops (for survivors and killers) . Items, add-ons and offerings are unlike on PC or console shared between all the characters. The bloodshop is simple. It resets every 24 hours from the last time it was reseted. A random bunch of stuff (not perks) are chosen to be in the bloodshop every time. The bloodshop is separated into multiple rows of stuff, with the rarity of stuff increasing as you go through the rows. First you can only buy stuff from the first row and once you have bought something from that row the next row will get unlocked. You can still buy stuff from the row before but only until you have bought something from the following row. The number of things you need to buy increases as the rows go. Once you have bought everything from the last row the bloodshop resets.
---
You may be asking how do we level up our characters and how we get perks on them. Well, you gain xp for the character you are playing with and the number of xp you get depends on your emblems at the end of the game (none=25 bronze=75 silver=150 gold=225 iridescent=275).After each character level up you will be shown 2 perks and you will have to decide which one you want to get. You will unlock the teacheables of characters at levels 20 30 and 40.I hope this taught you something about mobile and i hope you undersand why we have millions of useless bloodpoints and why i have around 40 ebonys, 75 toolboxes, 20 pink keys and a lot more stuff that Im never going to be able to use all of.
---
Ha that’d be great, I’ll settle for a fix, it would be worse if it actually affected my rank but honestly losing 5000 or so BP from one category and my item, not the end of the world, still playable and able to work around it but definitely something I’m hoping they look into soon
---
&gt;then run for a strong looping spot 
---
Can we talk about this for a second? Survivors, if you are trying to be a distraction and you run to Iron Works window/shack with God pallet up/any other super safe loop, any killer with two brain cells won't bite. I'm tired (playing both sides) of reading a survivor say "I tried" when they did that. It's not trying, it's just masturbatory.
---
Take my money, all of it.
---
"How long must we wait?" How many slices of bread did you eat in your life?convert that to hours
---
FUCKING EXACTLY, I JUST GOT THIS GAME ON XBOX TO ACTUALLY HAVE A DECENT FRAMERATE WHEN I PLAY KILLER (BELIEVE IT OR NOT I HAVE A WORSE FRAMERATE ON PC) BUT ITS UNBEARABLE TO WAIT 20 MINUTES FOR A 5-10 MINUTE GAME JUST BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO BE RANK 20, THIS IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT CROSS-PLATFORM PROGRESSION SHOULD BE A THING (TO AN EXTENT, OF COURSE)
---
oh
---
When dedicated servers come killers will get to bitch about misses.
---
my recommendation is to buy base and maybe 1 or 2 dlc to see if you like the game. buy the rest of the dlcs on sale or at a later date
---
Hence why I main Billy. If it’s a SwF, I’ll play good addons, if it’s a SwF with toolboxes, I’ll bring the very best addons. If they seem like a chill SwF then I’ll play some Plague
---
Angles*
---
The Pig is fine, there are way weaker killers like Trapper, Wraith, Clown and Leatherface
---
Overflow. 1/2 is everything except Stranger Things, 2/2 is Stranger Things and whatever comes next.
---
Gimme gimme them cosmetics. Even though people dislike the idea of a Battle pass type system in this game I'm all for it
---
The “downvote” option is where the reporting feature is. It’s where you can report people you think might be hacking or who use glitch spots and stuff like that.
---
i would prefer to see the cosmetic from all demons instead
---
So you do it yourself but you're posting this for your badass internet points?
---
Run camaraderie
---
You  can turn your characters around both in store and in game lobbies.
---
Theres a perk for that.
---
i used to play on a non consisten manner like 4 or less matcges a week it was never my main game this is through a whole year like ever since i got it on ps plus but now im focused on it 100 percent
---
Embrace the anarchy
---
&gt; If you think a perk that rewards you with haste and an instadown for playing like shit and not protecting objectives is the same as an exhaustion perk I don't know what to tell you. The correct example on survivors side would have been old decisive and old MoM but one was reworked to be balanced and more fair while the other was reworked to be so putrid noone would run it anymore. NOED is currently the biggest crutch perk remaining in the game.
---
Campings a strat. Like it or not its not going away.
---
Gonna go out on a limb here - 
---
&gt; ## KNOWN ISSUES
---
&gt; * **The End Game Collapse timer is visually desynchronized between clients and host.**
---
Yeah, and have you ever seen it do anything at all? I report every time a player DC's and so do my friends. Never seems to make a difference.
---
I suck at Killer, but, as Wraith I'm not half bad. Of course it's probably because everyone I usually kill is braindead
---
Ruin should just be a baseline effect, which is active without a totem and lasts until the first gen is repaired or the first survivor is downed. The actual Ruin Perk could be made similar to Third Seal, so that it applies the Ruin effect to every survivor hit by an attack until it is cleansed. Just my opinion.
---
That’s creepy as hell and I love it. If it’s a bug, they should keep it.
---
Half of them are swf too which is even more embarrassing.
---
Next time, just @ me
---
You speak truth my boy
---
This has to be a joke.
---
Got three packs, I can't wait!! I am gonna be one pimped Ghostface
---
It did, I was trying to teach someone new at the game, and me being the rank 2-3, we got a rank 2 Freddy that had franklins, bbq, ruin, and blood warden. So I think they fixed it.
---
I would start with the base game and if you like it, then go for the DLCs. I love this game to death. I had never played a game like this before I started playing.
---
So I would recommend this game to anyone to at least try. Try the base game and if you like it, then get the DLCs

Yes somone mention it, shame i don t play it anymore.
---
Godlike
---
This screenshot is litterallt from 2 matches ago
---
I mean they already bitch when I make em whiff like 7 times :3
---
Hell yes. Thank you for your time.
---
once you get a teachable it acts like any other perk, so if you go through enough bloodwebs you will find it but no guarantee  for it to spawn unless it's one of the last 4 perks you don't have at tier 3 on that character
---
I don't know why, but lately for some reason vault areaa are basically useless if you're not very far away from the killer. I swear a lot of times I shouldn't have been hit but I was. Not talking about those times where the killer can reach through the window. I'm talking about ones where there's a very noticeable distance. Maybe my internet got worse, or I've been getting laggy killers (or both).
---
I heard save the best for last is pretty good since using your shred won't take away any stacks if you hit the obession in theory you can keep all 8 stacks and kill the obession so slap that on with all the other meta perks then you're good to go
---
My thing happened last night, the day of the update.
---
it's a neat idea but it would need a pretty heavy downside to it otherwise it would just make every hook a basement hook when demogorgon is extremely good at protecting the basement
---
I haven't had a match where the escapees didn't teabag :(
---
Has happened alot, just search the sub
---
Montos Demo Dungeon
---
Awesome I’ll probably get the game since so many are recommending it.
---
I made a similar post earlier this week. Apparently it’s related to the survival points being added at the scoreboard and if the killer leaves it first you get none :(
---
Pig's pallet stun sound is cute and billy's is loud and obnoxious.
---
I will probably do this thank you for the idea.
---
I agree that we all can complain at times, regardless if we are right or wrong. But look at the image bud, it doesn't lie.
---
And just because someone complains incorrectly sometimes, doesn't mean all their complaints are null and void.
---
I love y'all both. Keep survivin'
---
People who prefer tanjiro and zenitsu over inosuke are disgraces to society
---
how to get downvotes 101
---
Flip flop + tenacity + unbreakable + boil over is a fun combo to use, especially on lery’s or Hawkins with a putrid oak
---
Feels like they broke it even more tbh
---
IM PISSED OFF BECAUSE ITS THE 4TH FUCKING TIME WITHIN THE PAST THREE DAYS IVE HAD TO REGRIND AND REPRESTIGE STEVE! I PRESTIGED HIM LAST NIGHT FINALLY I START IT UP TODAY AND HES BACK TO LEVEL 30. WHAT THE FUCK DEVS
---
Hopefully it’s not too unbalanced as the people I have been watching seem to do fairly well against the survivors.
---
What’s that? A console optimization?
---
You can rotate the characters
---
"improve p2p" lol good one
---
I think it's going to be nearly infinitely delayed or we're going to be incredibly disappointed. But let's see!
---
Camping is a strat. As much as I hate it that’s the truth. It’s how some people play and u just gotta deal with it
---
Knowing bhvr we wont get it till next year
---
Remember....no Dwights
---
Yea when he was having nightmares
---
Yes but you don't really hunt with the kids. It is slightly different.
---
It’s just latency from the host to the client. The killer (host) sees you still leaping over, but on your screen you are long gone. Sadly if your connection is just a little bit off from the host. You will experience such delays. 
---
 But there’s somewhat of a work around. Always perceive yourself one or two steps behind on your screen. It’s worked for me on multiple occasions with hosts with bad connections.
---
I would think the same thing but afraid not.
---
Makes sense seems like an easy fix, too bad it won’t be before tomorrow :(
---
And now they got a whole new baggage of bugs to fix with the Nintendo Switch version.  
---
I like the Switch version, but docked mode lags a lot, no way to progress with ranks (they reset everytime we exit the game) and there's some audio bugs with missing sounds (the exit gates are missing a few sound effects)
---
Boil over. It's worth it when the sotuationcalls for it but not very often. You will get some slugging killers randomly, but it most often happens at the end when the killer slugs the 2nd to last guy to get a 4k. A nice meme build is flip flop, tenacity, boil over and no mither with a toolbox to sabo hooks.
---
Something said, not good
---
It's a strategy the devs discourage though
---
The achievement is literally ‘achieve a merciless victory’
---
You pissed yourself and everything
---
I love it when I get 3+ puddings in a web. I feel like Homer Simpson with a donut.
---
The characters that are original to DbD can be bought using Iridescent Shards, which you get as your profile levels up (so just for playing the game)
---
thank you ;;__;; &lt;3
---
The people i watch are Monto, Noob3, Tru3talent, HybridPanda, Hexy, Puppers (the ones i can remember)
---
Tru3 is the one that will show you how the game favors mostly the survivors, ofcourse with a bit of bias from his part but it will help you see both sides and why theyre salty all the time 🤣
---
Noob3 is a funny troll
---
Monto is a meme
---
Hybrid gives mostly information
---
Puppers is a casual meme
---
Hexy, idk how to describe him for you since i rarely watch him
---
Tony ferguson is the type of guy
---
Wait, what happened here? I had this happen to me yesterday and I dont know why. Sorry if it's a dumb question.
---
Your Mom
---
I'd let him kill for the free rollercoaster ride
---
I see this as a absolute win
---
ITT: Baby survivors arguing why their second chance perks are totally fair and balanced but NOED isn’t.
---
Hey I wasn’t here 333 days ago, reposting not so bad somtimes
---
GorgAn
---
I could see a series of animated shorts or an animated Netflix series working well.
---
Also Behaviour give us more events similar to hollowed blight.
---
I could cum just to the thought of Freddy fisting me with he's finger knives.
---
And i just got an escape cake in my new bloodweb :O
---
Use it, ultra rare add ins are a lot more common then you are led to believe, I have over 50 Ebony moris on several killers, as well as dozens of other ultra rares. I’d say it be a better idea to use them sooner rather then later and practice different combos to figure out what synergizes best with your powers and play style
---
I REALLY HaTE HOW MUCH WE FIGHT OVER THE USEFUL THINGS EACH SIDE HAS, I THINK IF WE STOPPED BEING SO TOXIC TO THE OTHER SIDE WE COULD REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW THE GAME BALANCE FEELS TO THEM AND WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A GOOD MIX WHERE SURVIVORS NEED TO FEAR THE KILLER BUT DONT FEEL ABSOLUTELY FUCKED AS SOON AS THEY HEAR A HEARTBEAT. PERSONALLY, I WOULD LIKE TO SEE STEALTH BE MORE VIABLE AS A SURVIVOR WHILE GIVING KILLERS MORE WAYS TO STALL THE GAME!
---
Nurse is much much much more broken.
---
Plus I love being terrified by her.
---
It does but unless you time it perfectly the killer can just look up or turn around to not get blinded. Also you have to drop it a few feet in front of them, if it's right at their feet it doesnt work.
---
The shame is he didn’t give credit or xpost like supposed to. Shame! Just because your a thief also doesn’t make it ok.
---
Maybe, but when playing killer I've definitely gotten a couple hits that I shouldn't have where the person is definitely completely on the other side of the window AND my physical reach should not be able to connect with them.
---
that would be cool. also tbh i'd love a like "dressing room" so you can see a complete look you might have in mind, since right now you can only try on one thing at a time.
---
Well guess what? You sucks
---
It looks like a lag that interrupted the full action, but goddamn was it beautiful still
---
Must feel good especially since the double BP is just around the corner meaning you can basically just instantly just level Steve up and get everything on him or whoever you play idk
---
*when it takes less effort to not be a tiny peepee but you just* ***gotta*** *do it*
---
Honestly i wouldnt be surprised if Danny actually did take a picture like that guy before
---
LMFAOO you are a joke
---
It's not a dumb question. It's definitely a new bug. A guy on Monto's latest video even mentions it at the very end of the vid.
---
bitter murmur, spies from the shadow, iron grasp and unreleting
---
If you’re not a killer you don’t. You just deal with toxic assholes (and I’m talking about your teammates if you sooo queue, not the killer)
---
What build/perks are you using?
---
Now this is a dank meme.
---
What it really feels like playing as killer
---
Killers win 90% lol got any source to those sick stats?
---
Well he didn't say it was a (good) strat :D
---
Those elegant 360s tho
---
When you release none of the locations are ever close to you,,,
---
That's the joke. Congratulations!
---
I would like to know too
---
bro she looks like a twig. the fuck
---
A thick twig?
---
I don’t think you get a notification that a report resulted in anything, but I’d assume that it must do something lol
---
It’s only been a couple of months- they’ll be added before the end of the year, is my guess.
---
It doesn’t, because I rarely play Wraith. I main Billy and Plague, and I run NOED on neither. 
---
Bloodhound is useless, I have no trouble tracking scratch marks/blood, and even if I were to use it then technically wouldn’t that be a crutch? Because without it, tracking wouldn’t be as easy. 
---
Why the fuck would I use Thrill of the Hunt lol, Whispers gives me the situational awareness I need. And then it’s a second Hex perk on already weak killer, shit idea. Knowledge on the rotations of survivors is enough, I don’t give a shit if someone is cleansing a dull lol, gens are my concern. 
---
Do you see Sloppy Butcher on the list? I’d use it if I had it, but I don’t. And even so with Inner Strength + Second Wind, SB took a nerf. 
---
I don’t need killer tips bud lol. I use NOED on Wraith as of right now because it’s the best perk out of what I have. He’s the only killer I use it on, and that was my first Wraith game in a while.
---
Gordon Freeman for the next chapter.
---
I'm a rank 1 survior main on PS4. I don't 360. Just fake one way and go the other. Kinda like a 180 but not really. More like a 160.
---
Detectives hunch only activates if your in the terror radius and the terror radius makes thimp thump
---
Yea, I’m not going to deny any glitches or mishaps with the games mechanics. Hell, just last night a survivor hit me with a pallet and was teleported on their side. But I can safely say that most incidents are just from latency.
---
Wait... Dead by Daylight porn is a thing?
---
Lol no, not even worth a detailed response
---
Yes! Im needing the descriptions of them
---
We'll probably get a Legion rework before dedicated servers at this rate
---
This is a very gripping saga of Vigo’s sexual encounters with DBD’s killer roster; I can only imagine what the Plague’s gonna do to him.
---
Doesn’t matter to me. I can’t stop watching it! xD
---
I play on xbox1x and it's really smooth and plays well killer and survivor both so not sure what this is getting at
---
She was cornered yet ran to the jungle gym right behind her and camped the pallet there? You’re a dumbass dude lol
---
This joke has been made 90,000 times...
---
And it's still funny everytime
---
Hilarious.
---
It's so fun to use. I just don't get slugged a lot for it to work.
---
HAHA.  THIS REMINDS ME OF A RECENT SURVIVOR GAME I PLAYED IN WHICH I GOT 22K POINTS AND SOMEHOW SAFETY PIPPED.
---
Does slender man ever attack? My son was playing this and he would just stare at you and the screen would get fuzzy or something. What would his power be and what would his weapon be?
---
You don't. An endless parade of Spirit/Nurse wears you down pretty quick, and all the variety in this game disappears. The variety is what makes the game fun.
---
His power should have something something like ghost face where if you look at him for long enough he gets a huge speed boost or something.
---
It's okay to camp when it's the last survivor alive.
---
What's noed?
---
I think it depends way too much of the situation. At least I rarely face this kind of match
---
Keep you’re purple fart powder away from my gens.
---
He didn't explain what it does.  NOED allows you to instantly down survivors once Exit Gates are powered which means that you can effectively just EAT survivors and get kills even if you got none beforehand.
---
Yeah killers are just bad, imagine NOT being able to mindgame survivors at loops were the killer cannot mindgame..  B A L A N C E
---
ITS BULLSHIT! THATS 2 CATEGORIES MAXED AND 2 BASICALLY AT HALF. HOW MUCH BETTER ARE YOU MEANT TO DO?!?
---
Yeah it's really been BUGGING me..............fine I'll go get mori'd.
---
Except the survivor had Distortion and has loops for days.

Each token will increase your terror radius by 2/4/6 meters.
---
Each token will also apply an additional effect.
---
The associated Totem will seem Dull until two tokens are acquired, then it will show that it is a Hex Totem.
---
1 Token- Your terror radius will be slightly delayed in it's heartbeat.
---
2 Tokens- Survivors will scream when a chase is activated.
---
3 Tokens- Your red stain is hidden.
---
4 Tokens- Your terror radius covers the whole map but perks that rely on being in your terror radius will not active unless they are in your normal terror radius.
---
5 Tokens- The Exit Gates will not be shown to the Survivors and any perks that show them their auras do not work.
---
Your terror radius will sound like they're within 10 meters of you.
---
You will be 5% slower.
---
All Survivors can be killed by your hands.
---
Dive Into Insanity:
---
Survivors that have been hooked once have a 5/10/15% chance to scream and reveal their location.
---
Survivors that have been hooked twice have a 20/25/30% chance to scream.
---
Chances to scream occur every 10 seconds.
---
Screaming chances stop if they are in line of sight of another Survivor.
---
Abduction:
---
When you see someone working on a generator and stare at them without moving for 5/4/3 seconds without them looking at you, they will be afflicted with the Oblivious effect without their knowledge until they look at you.
---
The effect itself will last 60 seconds.
---
Cooldown for Abduction is 100/95/90 seconds.
---
Only one Survivor can be effected at once.
---
Just saying the teabag was so subtle it looked like it was at the beginning and you're way too worked up about it, it didnt need a post lol.
---
I don’t get why people think gens need to be harder, ruin just needs to be weaker. No one is asking for adrenaline to be base survivor, most killers want it weaker
---
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 You are clearly not that high ranked my friend. If you can explain what's so broken about her i would love to hear it.
---
Holy shit thank you
---
Yeah there is two.
---
Devour Hope becomes a tangible Totem if not cleansed beforehand and I believe it only actually takes a lit totem form once you get the Exposed status from it.
---
Then there is NOED which only becomes lit once the exit gates become powered.  In terms of perks that are stronger TECHNICALLY Deour Hope is better because it lets you Mori but NOED is pretty damn good if you still have a few survivors left.
---
That’s cool and all but, where can I get one of those pillows?
---
He has these really long tentacle like things that come out of his back and sometimes the trees so I'd imagine it would be something with those. He teleports too and if you look at him for too long you die. I could also imagine the add ons being in the form of the slender pages you find in the other games of slenderman.
---
VAULTING ANYWHERE NEAR THE KILLER ALMOST ALWAYS MEANS YOU'RE GOING TO GET HIT.  IT'S FUCKING STUPID.
---
Honestly kinda not surprised just expected him to be a little chubbier i
---
20 second cool down and he no longer gets a notification when survivors are destroying the portals.
---
Explain why then Mr Jokester
---
And bubba, but I'm a Nurse main. Dodging me with a locker is death lmao, if I do run it.
---
Can wait to see the finished product!
---
It's a cycle that can't be blamed on one side. These survivors may very well be acting this way because every killer they've gone against in the night is as toxic as they're being. This causes killers to play gross, and maybe half of the survivors in that next lobby did nothing wrong. It's their first game, and they get a facecamping clown who just hits them on hook despite them doing absolutely nothing wrong in the game. Those survivors get irritated and thrown on BL and drop a strode key because they start off really bad and it was in no way their own fault. They Strode Key and BL a Wraith who was just playing for fun and teabag him at the gates. He gets irritated so he plays a Prayer Beads spirit the next game because he feels bad and if that's how survivors are going to play then he'll do the same thing. His lobby has survivors who did nothing prior, but they get pissed, and so on and so forth.
---
You cannot blame a single side for toxicity, when it is a beast that endlessly feeds itself.
---
Huntress is mom bod, and I'm gay so I know these things.
---
the games best played when you’re semi roleplaying like this anyway imho
---
way more fun than beating down wins or bloodpoints
---
It do be like that.
---
I played the game then saved the video on my ps4
---
While adrenaline is not toxic in nature, mist survivors that I see using it always teabag me after they get it
---
Honestly I don’t despise the perks I just hate the people that are toxic when they only won the game because of them
---
DBD store page
---
Interesting.  I actually like the idea of getting emblems on specific characters to unlock their perks more.  I am a strong believer that you should be playing the character you're trying to level up, so I try to do that anyway, but having it built into the system isn't bad either.
---
Ah shit O forgot about that. I guess that's why the needed Badham before Haddonfield too huh
---
I stand corrected, this guy is right. Its Boldness.
---
This is amazing
---
I like it I can imagine them involving the slender pages and the static affect to some of these too. Maybe the totems could be in the form of pages especially for him.
---
Thank you, comrade!
---
I was expecting someone taller.
---
Aye, I do know that, but yknow, they can still get you if you're unlucky
---
I mean, could work for Pig or Ghostface with 0 terror radius...juts gotta be out of sight
---
BOY I SURE DO LOVE HOW MY DAILIES CHANGE UNEXPECTEDLY AFTER GETTING NEW ONES. I'LL HAPPILY DO CO-OP ACTIONS... OH WAIT I NEED TO OPEN THE GATE AS BILL INSTEAD!? GEE WHAT FUN!
---
Got the original photo?
---
Honestly kinda curious how he or it would work considering in most depictions he stares at someone and makes them go insane or something like that but they could just make him use his tentacles to attack or something
---
&gt;**KNOWN ISSUES**

---
Well if you know they are there just open the locker and grab them. Why else would you stick around
---
Thank you!
---
Yeah and it could give him a token to teleport close to the survivor when they choose with a static effect
---
I always use Crotus and Haddonfield offerings with Balanced Landing + Dead Hard
---
If I'm healthy, I'll try and wave them over so they can get a smack (As long as it isn't a instadown) so they can have some extra no at least
---
I throughly enjoyed this.
---
The game does lag but it has honestly been pretty consistent.
---
The 30 fps skill checks are pretty hard sometimes.
---
The game also doesn't save rank yet but that should be fixed soon.
---
HAHA WELCOME TO BEING A KILLER.  HAVE FUN GETTING A PALLET SLAMMED ON YOUR FACE RIGHT BEFORE BEING BLINDED BY A FLASHLIGHT AND TEABAGGED.  
---
THE BEST PART IS THAT WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING, ANOTHER MOTHERFUCKER IS RUNNING RIGHT BEHIND YOU SABOTAGING ALL THE HOOKS TO 99%, ONE PERSON IS WORKING ON DESTROYING YOUR RUIN, AND THE LAST PERSON IS DOING A GENERATOR ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MAP.  AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE FUCKS HAS THEIR TWITCHY LITTLE FINGER READY TO FUCKING TEABAG.
---
The guy who owned him sold him off a while ago, the studio that owns him are extremely stingy.
---
 u/michaelgidg is right, here is a [video](https://youtu.be/WFw9-KuH6No?t=34) I found to help. Volume is a bit low.
---
That's what the Hex Perk is for. The more of your objective you get done, the more he grows in power.
---
The static I think would be apart of his power.
---
Bonus blood points would be cool, like a 1% per rank. It doesn't sound like much but it would add up over time and would at least be something.
---
IE: lvl 20 1% bonus
---
Lvl 10 10% bonus
---
Lvl 1 20% bonus (an extra % for being high up)
---
I would say a flat reward per achieving a rank but it would just be te same - people getting there for the reward and then deranking
---
If you exit the house with that knife good luck.
---
I have fun in reds. I use meme builds and get given the pity hatch most games. It’s great.
---
The nametag is just that great little detail that makes this a quality shitpost. 
---
Also, inb4 4 brown medkits.
---
I’ve heard some killers say this and some say “You stopped wiggling. Never give up” and at this point I DON’T KNOW WHAT YA’LL WANT FROM ME! *survivor tears*
---
I've seen people do that even before I hook someone. I down someone, and like 3 people just come out of nowhere to try and bodyblock or flashlight me. So I just keep whacking them to fend them off, and eventually I have four people downed on the ground and not sure what just happened.
---
People are thirsty for altruism sometimes.
---
That’s...not how that works? Ruin slows down the early game and Adrenaline rewards the survivors for reaching end game, they do totally separate things. The only thing that binds them is their strength and common use. Ruin does not need to be weaker when it can already be powered though/cleansed/tapped.
---
I legit say this every time someone fucks up a skill check
---
They said summer 2019...well summer is over and we got nothing

When you get to high ranks everybody has the most meta perks anyways.  I just assume everyone runs DS unless I see I have no obsession and then I don’t have to worry about it.
---
Kind of douchey. Just play the game.
---
Oh yeah
---
David and Jake blight skins please
---
How are you liking the switch lite? Honestly thinking about getting one just for that cyan color tbh.
---
LET'S DO THIIISSS!!!
---
Hey one of my childhood favorites combined with DBD! And yeah that’s pretty accurate for whenever I touch the killer.
---
I GOT CALLED A USELESS WHORE EVEN THOUGH I DID THE ONLY 3 GENS THAT GOT DONE AND THEY DID NOTHING BUT MUSICAL HOOKS.
---
HOPE SONY DABS ON YOUR ACCOUNT YOU FUCKER.
---
You have to be healing when you use it, I just realized this after constant failure.
---
I just want the option for no hud. Be really cool...
---
Idk who this is but he look like that Ice Poseidon guy 💀
---
It does work it’s just hard to get the timing as you can get the killer blind without it stunning them
---
This is actually the first push back for it. They announced it to come this summer but that is a crazy amount of work. Don't get me wrong, I find myself frustrated after a game of everyone DCing within the first minute because they don't like the killer we are against or the killer I am playing, I've vented a few times on here about the wait for dedicated servers but the wait and push is understandable as long as it isn't a continuous thing.
---
You are a man of culture, then. May you live a good life.
---
10% of the emblem = bronze
---
40% = silver
---
80% = Gold
---
100% = Iridescent
---
10% from hooking everyone atleast 1 time
---
10% from getting 9 or more hooks
---
20% per killed/sacrificed survivor
---
20% from survivor disconnects.
---
0% from survivor bleed out.
---
For fun 🙃
---
2 points for each sacrifice with all 4 dead is 8 points. 1 point for hooking ALL survivors once, 1 point for hooking ALL 4 survivors a collective of 9 times. Which brings you to 10 for an iri. The gold and iri are dependent on having each survivor hooked at least one time.
---
You got silver for 2x3 for 6 points which is a silver.
---
Very rarely have I seen that happen.
---
Run Adrenaline if you're hooked at end game
---
Run Borrowed Time to help the hooked Survivor
---
Run Camaraderie to extend the time you're on hook
---
Run Decisive Strike to punish the Killer for tunneling
---
Run Deliverance to unhook yourself
---
Run Kindred to show everyone the Killer
---
Run an Exhaustion Perk
---
Body Block for each other
---
Flashlights
---
Styptic Agent/Anti-Haemorrhagic Syringe
---
Improve how long you can keep a chase going
---
Have the 3 other Survivors do gens because lack of pressure which screws the Killer out of Emblem and Bloodpoints on top of the emblem punishment for unnecessarily staying near a hook.
---
Ok
---
Nowhere did I state otherwise?
---
Oh for sure well let me ask you this, if you had every park what would be your build? 
---
Yeah i hear ya it looks good i just dont see many people using it sadly enough! 
---
Nice talking to you! Im not trying to poop on your build by no means i just like asking questions and talking about killer builds heh
---
Thanks for telling me about BBQ with cannibal didn't know you had to get leather face first to get it don't know YMMV sry and I like hillbilly mostly because of his mobility so people similar to hillbilly I'd probably like but I also want to be good with s few different types of killers so kind of liking the look of Myers so might join you maining him
---
They need to rework legion, leave the pig alone, poor Amanda.

Welcome to the internet. Have you seen r/dbdgonewild or r/dbdgonegay?
---
Ok so I think I forgot to type that, it’s not my first and it gets me every time
---
Thank you! So in layman's terms, I need at least 9 hooks AND a 4k in order to get iri, and gold you get for EITHER a 4k OR 9 hook BUT you must hook all 4 players at least 1 time. Is that right?
---
''Hey Cindy look, I'm on DBD y'all check it out!''

When finding a match with swf takes like 30 minutes now

There's always one.

I HAD A GUY CALL ME AND 3 OTHER RANDOMS A SWF GEN RUSHERS. WE DIDN'T EVEN COME IN AT THE SAME TIME. WE WERE JUST COORDINATED, AND HE SAID THIS ALL WHILE USING EBONY MORI AND GETTING TWO KILLS. YOUR ANGER IS MISPLACED
---
Sweet justice has been served and yes, this is a known bug.
---
And the 26th time is some cheesy killer meme build like a basement bubba. Sure they can play what they want, but sometimes this game really sucks like that.
---
Wow you are good. I can never do that 360 thing
---
Has that been confirmed or just speculation? Because looking at the name, I got the impression it's 3 killers (Clown, Spirit, and Nurse) and 2 survivors (anything with Vigo and harvest usually are survivors related)
---
Exactly what happend to me the other night it's such a satisfying feeling

Alright, that's just you. This entire sub is a bunch of slightly different reposts of the same jokes. Don't know why I stay.

Use adrenaline since you already have it. Sprint burst is ok for now but try for dead hard or balanced landing. For the rest it's mostly up to how you want to play
---
*cries in Insidious*
---
Overall sure, but when you are a rank 1-5 killer, it's much much more common. It gets very discouraging trying to play any killer that is not Nurse/Billy/Spirit.
---
It's very fun but don't let the toxicity get to you
---
*traps head*

I LEGITIMATELY DGAF AND TARGET THE FRIENDS THEY ARE BOOSTING TO DRAW THEM OUT SO THEY GET OVERCONFIDENT. I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO CHASE A TEABAGGING DAVID SO HIS FRIENDS CAN MISS SKILL CHECKS AND STILL GET THREE GENS.

---
WHEN SURVIVORS TYPE GG EZ AFTER ESCAPING IN POST GAME CHAT EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE IMMERSE AS FUCK AND WHEN I DID FIND THEM I DOWNED THEM IN LESS THAN A MINUTE YET THEY HAD THE AUDACITY TO SAY EZ
---
But it should work. They just didnt do it right
---
I had a billy face camp me for head-on’ing him and out running the Iron Maiden.  Managed to escape and just to rub it in, the game gave me the bug that ended the egc prematurely while the timer was still going.
---
Poor baby Dwight 😩🐒
---
More satisfying when it’s the asshole with the flashlight lol
---
I too love rewarding camping killers for no reason
---
A killer gave it to me the day it changed lol
---
"a Behavior Dev" 
---
Like we didn't all picture the exact same guy.
---
Yes they do function with the double bp as well as all offerings for bloodpoints
---
6ix9ine said that Jeff is part of the trey nine bloods
---
Meaning we NEED a reliable slowdown perk.
---
I agree with your username.
---
"by the end of summer" lmfao
---
Sad there’s no dedicated server for Australia
---
Left behind did function, it was just difficult to use and there are just better perks to use
---
Lol!  I was gonna say that hit like every checkmark in the babykiller handbook.  Glad to hear you've developed your killer play and game knowledge since then.
---
What :( I thought they confirmed it
---
Thanks!
---
yea I was rewatching this and going "wtf I used to think this was okay? and those chases tf how did I get to red ranks as shit as this"
---
Wow ok boomer, read the rules
---
Oh yeah, what happened in the vid was complete bullshit
---
Yeah, for a iridescent, you need 4 kills, 9+ hooks.
---
For Gold, you need either a 4 kill (80% from survivors killed) or a 3 
---
kill (60%) with 9+ hooks and all survivors hooked atleast 1 time.
---
It’s not a rule. Most killers who give the hatch make it very clear by swinging while I’m in their grasp or letting me wiggle and struggle free like you do.
---
🙄🙄 whatever helps you cope
---
You were messing around for like 2 min?
---
The only reason to save is because there's an increased chance of people looking to just farm.
---
If you aren't looking to farm then no point saving.
---
*teabags known streamer/youtuber* "ohhh man didn't know it was you in sorry lol gg wp" people like this are scum
---
I ask why because why tf would someone make a perk unusable at random. A reason could be that devs only play killer 🤔
---
When you die to save another survivor and they teabag at the gates and say GG EZ in the chat. 🙄
---
For real?
---
Yup, it's currently in beta and released only in certain areas atm.
---
If you know that most people consider it an insult, it's an insult when you do it.
---
By selling the game, it’s not free you know.
---
As a solo q survivor, this speaks volumes to me. All I care about are those sweet sweet stacks.
---
The salt from killers who don't realise how much of a technical advantage they get from hosting is going to be intense.
---
Was the gif 2 minutes? Pretty sure it was 10 seconds.
---
Wahhhhh BHVR nerf Nurse wahhhh BHVR nerf Spirit
---
Lmao if I should grow a pair than you should grow thicker skin for getting angry over someone saying teabagging is toxic, funnily enough, you proved my point
---
Thanks for the advice! Hopefully I won’t get completely destroyed by everyone too much.

Pig and Ghostface can crouch, but they're both paywall characters.

Bloodpoints would be nice, but my idea was a special cosmetic for survivor/killer each season that you get for reaching top rank.
---
It can still be added to the shop afterwards so newer players that may have missed it can still buy it, but you earn it for free if you grind the ranks that season.
---
With? The poor map rng I honestly couldn’t care enough to cry for immediate changes , but to say it’s balanced and anyone that doesn’t think so is bAd is ridiculously ignorant.
---
Then they're bad at doing squats.
---
So Yesn't
---
100% me though. If there is any hope left in you escaping you will die. But when you’ve given up and accept death, I will grant you life.
---
No, they don't.
---
I’m a survivor main and I agree. Running towards the killer after being unhooked basically is asking to be slugged.

Wagongorgon sounds like something the Swedish chef would prepare on the muppets.
---
I saw this happen earlier to a guy who was going to escape, had just lost the killer and was tentatively making his way to the exit.

Things get REAL tribal up in Dead by Daylight. Survivor mains are AFFILIATED with Survivors, and Killers are their ENEMIES who must be HARMED. The ENEMY faction.
---
That timer being that far down doesn't mean we were at the door that long... I (Nea) opened the door and was making sure my friend (Jane) made it and she had just arrived in the door when the gif begins.

Nothing too big. Don't want hitboxes getting too small, though, apparently.

&gt;  thor. I mean it doesnt matter what their background is bc literally anyone can be preyed on

Yeah... no. That's not going to work.

Lol this would be the best idea ever. “I got you I got you on camera”
---
There's 3 types of vaults. Fast vault is when you git the vault from the front while sprinting. Medium vault is when you hold shift and vault, but from the side or while standing next to it. Slow vault is when you vault, but dont hold shift.
---
Just keep chasing them eventually you'll catch up
---
who?
---
Nobody tells newbies this rule, you know. I still wouldn't know if I didn't watch Otz.
---
Typically a slow vault is used when you lose LOS with the killer. You run toward the window, then stop running then vault. This avoids the audio cue and visual cue for the killer to see/hear. Fast vault is when you keep sprinting through the vault and then it sounds like you're kicking a board along with a visual cue for the killer to see.
---
Yeah that about sums up solo queue. People like True want the game balanced for rank 1 seal team 6 survivor squads, and I can understand why, but that would make the game completely unplayable for the 94-97% of players that are playing outside of 4-man SWF (and yes that figure is accurate, sourced from BHVR). Playing solo queue can be pretty rough when you have players that DC, sandbag, troll, or are just plain bad. That said I've also had some great times in solo queue games, and met many cool people.  
---
I try my best not to take the game too seriously, but sometimes you just have to take a break when you get too many bad games in a row.
---
When they're saying "slow vault" in these circumstances, it is more like a medium vault. When you run directly at a window, you will vault much faster than if you approach at a wide angle (such as running along the wall the vault is on). This is also why you sometimes see people run away from the wall at an angle before sharply turning towards the vault, this is to try and get a fast vault instead of a "slow vault". These slow vaults are still quicker than not running in the first place, but they allow a killer to make up some ground.
---
I thought there was just fast and slow. So you have to be facing directly at a vault to truly fast vault?
---
I am a butt hurt camper because I point out that his idea gets destroyed by the killer literally taking a step back?
---
What?!
---
Also, I love the downvotes. People are such snowflakes on reddit.
---
"Ima' downvote you! This will show you, you meanie!!" \*frantically downvotes post\*
---
UNACCEPTABLE. All Killers are camping slug tunnellers but should follow the Survivor's Rules for Killers, obviously.
---
A medium vault is a slower fast vault, it's when you're running to the window on a weird angle and you can't make it through the window straight, so they climb over instead of hop over.
---
You're talking about "pro-play" in a game that has no competitive scene at all. I don't think you know what that phrase means
---
Ik that, I meant while running vaulting, not just vaulting in general.
---

Killer here
---
Its a perk that activates when all generators are done. it turns a dull totem (unlit, meaning a "useless" totem) into a cursed totem, makes the killer faster and exposes all survivors (insta-downs when hit)

Pretty strong when you get hit unexpected, or try to get one more kill before they all run out teabagging, but the perk is useless when all totems are cleanses, because it needs a dull totem to sit on, hence the references here
---
No matter what when the day comes hopefully the survivors wont have to worry about the huntress' ridiculous hit boxes for her hatchets
---
Thank you for the warning I usually just turn stuff off or block people if they begin to be toxic so hopefully it won’t be a big problem
---
Yeah there's a post about it here

Theres 3 vaults
---
Slow, Mid and Fast
---
Slow vault, your character will be interacting more with the window giving killers a chance to get a hit.
---
Fast Vault the time the character interacts with the window is lower so youll be out of danger faster and gain distance easier
---
Mid is in between, its a bit hard to identify
---
Fast vaults only occur when you're running perpendicular towards a window and have some distance on it
---
Slow vaults occur when you're too close to the window like right next to it.
---
kek
---
Yeah but who knows what they were doing for the other 1min 50 seconds the timer was running. If it is just a desync the timer should still be the same. Idk people messing around at the exit gate are just a pet peeve of mine, its one of the reasons the end game collapse is even a thing.
---
Would be cool to have the backrooms as map lol
---
Oh god. That seems really weird...
---
I just told you, they stop sprinting right as they get to the window to vault slowly, or they keep sprinting through the vault to do a fast vault.
---
Same lag spikes as any other console cause of the hosts wifi.
---
They are not on switch because of licensing, but their perks are in the bloodweb
---
While holding shift, yes. But you also need to run a bit to hit the fast vault if that makes sense.
---
In my opinion reposts is not what make a sub toxic
---
Several weeks ago. BBQ first and then Ruin the week after I think.
---
I’m very impressed by this community’s ability to push out memes.
---
WHY THE FUCK ARE SURVIVORS SO WHINYYYY. EVERY GODDAMN GAME IT'S "Wahhh I got hooked twice you tunneler!" or "Were you still on the map while i was hooked, ugh face camper." STOP CRYING. YOU MAD ENTITLED TO TELL ME HOW TO PLAY THE GAME. FOH BEFORE I PULL UP A NO ED NURSE JUST SO YOU ACTUALLY GOT SOMETHIN TO CRY ABOUT
---
We can only hope.
---
Ooh if there's bloodpoints in a real money one lowkey might buy that actually haha.
---
It's bugged, it says they're in the party when they're not, and even if you close the party it says they're still in it.
---
Yes, there is nothing too BIG for dbd, that’s why they refuse to change it.
---
Not toxic, but they make it repetitive and boring. This sub is a meme pit. Sucks when the pit is mostly reworded old jokes.
---
You didn't understand my question then. Everyone else did, but thank you for contributing too. I already knew the difference between a normal fast vault and slow vault, did not know there was a medium vault though.
---
It's a bug right now
---
Okay thank you, does this affect gameplay a lot? Because if it does I may practice it a bit too get better at it.
---
Pretty much. I don't mind a challenge but there's certain killers/builds that are quite literally impossible to beat unless you're with the sweatiest premade SWF and even then a player who has mastered killer is still not going to make it easy for you. 
---
I sorta regret ever shit talking survivor players if this is what they constantly force themselves to play....
---
Wait, the gates still need to be opened if you power gens, though.
---
Ey that and shards will be in it
---
That would be awesome. A survivor that walks by and doesn't unhook you because they are too pussy
---
If only the Trapper had a wheelchair
---
I'll get the coffee you get the donuts, we startin' a support group up in this biznitch.
---
*disconnects*
---
There's fast, medium and slow. 
---
Fast is done when running at a vault in straight on angle. 
---
Medium is when you're standing at a vault and you vault while pressing the rush action button.
---
Slow is when you go at it from a hard left or a hard right angle, usually from running along a wall to it.
---
Less frames to get hit if you do a fast vault. So yes . But it's not hard, hist run at the window from the front, and not the sides.
---
Dude, you're not supposed to let them know this gives you a secret 3rd health state, it's supposed to be a secret.
---
&gt;Yeah but who knows what they were doing for the other 1min 50 seconds the timer was running.
---
Exactly my point... You immediately assumed we were being toxic when it was just two stupid friends being stupid in game with each other
---
&gt;unusable at random.
---
You clearly know what you're talking about.
---
Adding it to the store for people to buy makes earning not feel accomplished! thats the whole point!
---
I didn't think it would be hard, just practice my timing and angles a little bit.
---
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG WITH KILLER MATCH MAKING? IT IS TAKING SO LONG TO FIND A GAME BUT WHEN I QUE FOR SURVIVORS IT SEEMS TO BE REGULAR QUE TIME.
---
The reason your parents dont want you to have candy for dinner is so they can eat it all once you go to sleep. 🤔
---
Whispers isn't really useless, but it would be WAY too strong to set gates at the maximum distance. Just make them never within direct line of sight of one another.
---
At least you didn't have any pretense of getting a 4K with Legion.
---
I really sold that shit didn't I?
---
I said slender would be a great idea like a week ago too so I’m glad to see other people think the same.
---
Like I said, hard pill to swallow
---
He probably recorded it with the PS4 capture thingy and then recorded that with his phone
---
Are we just going to ignore all the perks, addons and moris killers have in their arsenal to counter these perks/slow the game? 
---
Take a shower and get that salt off x
---
Basement Gorgon is awesome, I think territorial is a great perk for that too.
---
Im fucking fuming. God dammit you got me. You won this one
---
I just want console optimization...
---
It's not about timing, only angle. Just mash the spacebar. Good luck
---
I know this is a bug but I wish it was a feature to keep survivors like that on their toes.
---
Thanks.
---
I still blame BHVR for the desync but even why I play survivor I leave before the last 30 seconds just in case I get downed or bloodwarden or that exit gate glitch that doesn't let you leave. I wonder if they ever got patched, because the timer desync and that would be just dumb.
---
Anyway, the 5000 survival points would be more to me than my friend making it out XD
---
Oh, I'm aware. But there's a lot of people that think it'll magically fix their issues in the game and that they'll be Rank 1 for sure once dedis come in.
---
I'm also not sure why I'm getting downvoted lol. I am pro-dedicated servers, just pointing out that they'll have their own problems
---
