WAITING FOREVER FOR A LOBBY TO GET A LAGGY GAME WHERE I SPON NEXT THE THW KILLER AND GET PUT ON A HILL AND CIRCLED LIKE THE KILLER IS A FUCKIN SHARK
---
---
---
The devs want all killers to be human.
---
Yes i'm totally okay with that. If you play legion to do this go fuck yourself(not you just in general) make it a terror radius thing? maybe but that would also mean the survivor is in your terror radius and therefore cannot get away(would than just become built in whispers).
---
If its known that its game breaking, it needs to be fixed. Much like that one stupid ass rock survivors can go up but killers cant (still isnt fixed btw)
---
Feels bad man, played a trapper yesterday that tunneled someone to start the game. Thank god I didn’t see him until the gens were done bc he made the first guy he tunneled DC. He happened to be a trapper who ran NOED and after we opened the gates we came back to save the other guy who was on his first hook btw, and he was being face camped and he had three traps surrounding him. I felt so bad because I couldn’t find the totem and even with borrowed time, I wasn’t in a position to save him.
---
Took me a bit to remember the add on names (internet is too shitty to Google them and ive been working 16 hour shifts lately so I havent been able to play the game). Also assume all perks are at tier 3.
---

---
Jump Rope - considerably reduces survivor action speed in the dream world
---
Blue Dress - Moderately reduces the chance for a skill check while in the dream world
---
Jigsaw Piece - so we can go to The Game map so your terror radius covers most of the map most of the time
---
Thanatophobia - slows all action speeds with each injured, dying, hooked, and dead survivor up to a max of 15% action speed reduction
---
Colorophobia - slows down healing speed while in your terror radius by 50% 
---
Distressing - increases your terror radius by 26% so that Colorophobia is reaching across most of the map
---
Dying Light - once you kill your obsession, all action speeds are reduced by 25%
---
Freddy's power also reduces action speeds in the dream world by 50%
---
This, on top of all the perks, can make it so that healing speed is reduced to -140% and all other action speeds are reduced to -100%
---
I play quite often and my psn storie33
---
Just making sure you’re that delusional
---
By your logic, anyone who plays Claudette is cheating as well
---
I’ve dodged SWF groups from people I know, just because I play survivor with them so I know how they play and it isn’t fair since they usually run with other people I have played survivor with so I have “insider knowledge” on how they play. 
---
Now if I play a SWF group and one DCs, I generally don’t show any mercy, if an entire SWF DCs and leaves the one random, I’ll let that guy live and just fuck around on the map. Example: I was my Billy Boy with super turning add-ons, Ruin, Make Your Choice, Nurse’s and Enduring (I don’t respect pallets) and got a cross map on a member of a 3 man SWF, they all DC’d. I downed the random, kept dropping him in front of my Ruin until he got free and then I just chainsawed around the map while he did gens. 
---
I’ve also had situations where I’m on Stalky Boy and had two sacrificed, one on their first hook and the last guy alive with 5 gens still up (I was being a toxic cunt with Fragrant and Judith and they all just fed me, so it was on them), I let the guy live because the last guy on the hook DC’d after i caught the other guy running for an unhook and was heading towards them, basically screwed him over big time. 
---
In my opinion, SWF is a mixed bag and it’s pretty fucked up to camp them just for that reason. I’ve had games were I barely get 2 hooks with a very skilled SWF and games where I’ve killed them all with 4-5 gens left because of their little screw ups giving me openings. It’s not karma, like any camping, it’s just being a dick because you know you’re not good enough to get the kills otherwise.
---
[removed]
---
I'm also curious as to what you mean by this? Trapper is literally one of the best killers as he completely negates looping. The only counter really is if they pop your traps but "Oh darn, now I know exactly where you're at and maybe even if you run bloody coil thats a free hit too. 
---
Terrible font
---
BUT...  why?
---
do you have a source for that just out of curiosity?
---
Borrowed Time tho
---
Why is every post about how toxic mechanics of the game are?
---
BaTtEr Up BiTcH
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
One of the dev streams around the Hag release. Human or once-human. 
---
Oh!!! Haha. I withdraw my rant then.. thanks!
---
I love blood warden and it’s getting even better now that they’re getting rid of dead swf being able to warn their teammates about its existence.
---
#SpiritMain
---
as trapper kill a survivor using your own hands
---
Let me guess, they all escaped?
---
Indeed it has blessed me well!
---
Calm down 
---
yes lets give that to her then they can move to adam who also gets dark clothing as well
---
You can't get bound envelopes as killer 
---
cant count how many dcs i get when exit gates are powered
---
Right! No one jump scares better than Mickey. Doing a gen and all of a sudden I’m grabbed off of it and I’ll look around the whole time and he can still sneak up on me 
---
I've had that happen to a friend before on PC
---
She died because I sandbagged her when it started happening
---
I also died
---
she called me trash
---
worth it
---
&gt; Give all survivors(that are allowed) a piggy mask.(this would be so cute). 
---
Making Nea's face look better is a mission I can always get behind! 
---
It gives him a speed boost to counteract is usual slow self so it’s not like it’s useless. It’s the same as using it on Huntress. It isn’t optimal or efficient but people still do it and it still works simply by being noed.
---
I thought the easiest thing for them would be like they do in fighting games. Like after so many matches you get a cutscene and then eventually you get the end cutscene with your character winning or something and then you’ll get a special entity “blessed” skin or weapon. 
---
This method I would would be pretty cheap, compared to some other things they could do, because they can just use concept art stills and voice overs if they want to. 
---
Obviously a lot of the other things discussed here would be amazing, and I actually think think the entity is pretty interesting, and they did a good job with the Halloween event (although it was pretty generic and I didn’t thing the Spirit or Legion story sets were really that good). Some amount of vagueness is great but there are some things around the edges they could elab on like Cloverfield does.

---
Maybe, but why ban survivors?
---
I wish reddit would keep my new paragraph indents :(
---
i get so tense playing this game like i seriously think my OWN HEARTBEAT is the killer’s
---
Having a 4 killer game with 12 survivors would be pretty insane.   12 gens, 8 must be done to open the gates (With a bit of a Left Behind setup on them, more survivors alive slower overall gen progress is per survivor), with 4 gates and 2 hatch spawns.  More pallet spawns as well.
---
Just imagine 4 hags using all their traps in one room and them stacking independently, all set for max trigger radius.  One survivor walks in to do the gen in the room.  A hag approaches, and the survivor jumps.  As 40 hags jump up because he stopped crouching.
---
Real question is, why is there no indicator to survivors someone on the hook has deliverance active? Their aura should be a different color than the typical yellow, easy and simple quality of life fix. Very annoying when I'm hanging on the hook for an opportune moment to rawdog off the hook when I've got a Claudette horde coming for BPs.
---
What about camping with Freddy?
---
yeah the point is that its annoying to do it if you dont play that specific killer
---
You’re giving it away dude
---
The survivors hold all the power while the killer holds very little. If the survivors stay on generators, do what they're supposed to do, and leave, the game will be over before the killer can do anything of substance. 3 gens can be popped in 80 seconds without Ruin. 100 seconds if you include travel time and maybe someone stopping to get a dull totem. But still less than 2 minutes. 
---
Not to mention the huge perk power disparity: survivors get tons of second chance perks, the only killer perk that's second chance is NOED, and can be cleansed before it activates, or cleansed once activated. 
---
I agree, this version is way more entertaining. I was talking about how in this version he purposefully tries not to 2 pip so he doesn't rank up as fast. I understand why he does it, but I think it would be cooler to see him just blast through the ranks. Sadly he won't do that otherwise his queue times will take forever.
---
Now I really want to see a Super Sonic styled Freddy (not Super Freddy from that one movie)
---
Wait really? I thought you could grind for them. Huh my bad
---
Genuinely curious, how do you enjoy him as Survivor?
---
If you like the chase then you hate him because your skill won't matter. If you like stealth then you hate him because once he hits a Survivor he can see everyone in Terror Radius.
---
The only fun part about playing against him is that most Legion players are garbage so you can window juke and pallet juke pretty easily. But once Legion players get better it'll be impossible to juke.
---
Fuck you, I play Civ 5, get that smash cancer garbage out of here.
---
Pretty sure, it's just get a merciless killer with 4 people died. Pretty sure leavers and moris count
---
Whenever I use an Ebony Mori I swear I'm against the most coordinated teams. ree
---
I love how he automatically left after that so he wouldn’t hear your comebacks. He could dish it out but he couldn’t take it. 
---
As long as it’s a 4k you still get the achievement. 
---
I'm at about 130
---
How can you be so sure he likes sucking dick? Maybe he's more into licking balls or eating ass.
---
Which is a fucking terrible movie for reasons like this.
---
i just finished this myself last night... took me like... 3+ weeks?
---
boy the next patch cant come fast enough... if the damn thing actually TRACKED CORRECTLY id be done in a matter of games.
---
That's not gonna stop anyone not wanting to play against Legion. Still gonna kill myself if i cant dc.
---
BHVR WHAT THE FUCK IS A CHASE??? THREE TIMES TODAY I WAS IN CHASES BUT MY LITHE DIDNT POP BECAUSE IT WASNT ~TECHNICALLY~ A CHASE. PLEASE EITHER FIX CHASES OR MAKE LITHE WORK WITHIN THE TERROR RADIUS AS WELL AS A CHASE OR SOMETHING FOR FUCKS SAKE. I DIED THREE TIMES BECAUSE IT DIDNT POP WHEN I WAS DEFINITELY BEING CHASED. 
---
Rank 1 Survivor main chiming in to say I agree with all this. ANY killer with a brain would camp the last person- specially with the gate so close you could piss on it. Hell, I wouldn't have even tried to go in for the save at this point in case of NOED or something- I would have looked, seen him facecamping, then run off to try to loot a last chest on my way out the door. Though, IF I had somehow pulled an unhook, ala this vid, I certainly wouldn't have stopped to asswiggle at the gate, because I know how toxic it is when people do it to you. When I do babykiller dailies and people do this, it's frustrating as shit. Just fuckin leave so the match can end and I can move on to the next match. Though, I would also like to point out that it's super scummy to dc just cause you lost your hooked surv. But in short; Rank 1 Surv Main Agrees With Facecamping When Gates Are Opened And Right Behind The Hooked Dude.
---
ITT: You're just screwed if you don't have ruin and enduring
---
Add in an option for the Killer to concede and “force” the last survivor out the hatch and I’m all in. If I want to let you leave, you shouldn’t be able to force me to go across the map so I can watch.
---
Yep! You're right. Also, me and my friends already do that, but a lot of the time we might forget a perk or item and etc then someone runs it and we're all like "shit". Also there's sometimes someone who isn't in the call or multiple people, gets hectic. Just an idea :P thanks for the feedback though
---
You'd still have to do that though, unless he meant the addon literally dumped the survivor in front of you in your view
---
I would rather not play at all than try to play killer on console. 
---
Dude slower gen progress based on the number of survivor should be base game for 4 survivors now that you say that lmaooo. But that sounds sooo hectic. I think you'd have to make it so only one of each killer can be used or it'd be way too crazy hahahaha. Or maybe they have a shared number of traps?
---
EVERY TIME THERES A BASEMENT CHEST CAMPER ONE OF MY DUMBASS TEAMMATES TRIES TO GET ME TO OPEN IT. NO BRO. IVE PLAYED BUBBAS BASEMENT. THERE ARE NO WINNERS ONCE YOU TOUCH THAT CHEST. 
---
I don’t bother doing it, I just leave them for the end with 4-5 gens still up because of the perk set up I have. Then I Mori them or watch them bleed out for 3 minutes. 
---
Some people do like to mess with the killerx but sometimes it's more fun to evade. I get a kick out of them looking right at me like 4 times and still having no idea where I am. Stealth can be a fun play, too. They're both respectable play styles.

I do enjoy the juking aspect. To Juke a legion is hard so it's satisfying when I can. I'm not a great survivor, but I do enjoy playing against legion.
---
I wanna see that so badly
---
Especially when those chapters can even be bought with the in-game currency, assuming non-licensed. 
---
Zoinks scoobs that's a infinite tombstone myers!
---
entitty
---
I wouldn't even say deaf. Ever since the most recent updates sounds are so horrible that you can barely hear survivors. Built in iron will due to chase music etc being obnoxiously loud.
---
You can barely hear the huntress lullaby over the injured survivor music now.
---
Killer. I don't like that often my time as survivor can be ruined by other players on my side. Plus i've just experienced so many assholes playing survivor no matter which side i play. Maybe i just prefer seek to hide in general but when you play killer you are in total control of your side of this objective based game, theres nothing worse in an online game that having your situation get worse because of something like a player on your team whos just there to pull the killer around to other players or something. If i screw up as killer its totally on me and thats how i like it.
---
Same with not giving Freddy a Christmas sweater. I can imagine Freddy with a Christmas sweater and his claw is covered in Christmas lights. I would easily pay $20 for that. 
---
Yeah we never D/C by choice, no matter how the game is going for us (by choice as in our Internet doesn’t drop). I don’t know why the random D/C’d, I personally was running over to get him, but the killer told us that the reason he camped us on hook was it was our karma for being a SWF group. 
---
I admit I don't know about the recent games but I do recall the older games required the  DLCs or else you will never see the new maps.
---
Did you click a vote button? 
---
I mean once you know it's hag, you def start crouching near any point of interest.  What gets you is the random hag trap that had been left near a hooked and freed survivor or gen that got completed and she jumps you with it.
---
When you gain pips, your rank goes up. There is no real reason to want to do that, really (but maybe in the future they will reward getting to rank 1)
---
Imagine if she had 115% instead of the 98%, she would be way too op
---
The killer we were up against said that he camped us because we were a SWF and it was our karma and then of course made it out like we were the weird ones for not thinking that was right. 
---
That’s like saying Pig isn’t the best killer. She can Teabag, something no other killer can do. 
---
That’s how I am when I play killer! I just thought it was so odd this killer would think we should be camped because we are SWF 
---
achieve enlightenment with two easy addons!
---
That's me, literally xD
---
Just never be nice. Your job as a killler should be to kill! Dont care about feelings, kill them and harvest them for the Entity! Fuck their feelings, their goal is to escape from you, your goal is to kill them. 
---
Really? I've had trouble discerning direction but never in hearing it when in an area.
---
Some edgelords look out for that DS pop up
---
I USE FRANKLIN'S DEMISE BECAUSE OF ALL YOU FUCKS TEABAGGING AT THE GATE WHO ARE LET ME GET A FREE HIT.
---
FUCK YOUR ULTRA RARE FLASHLIGHT, IT'S MINE NOW!
---
As the killer you do this or as a survivor? I think for survivors they at least want a chance to make some bloodpoints and possibly get a safety pip lol
---
That's just awful, have an upvote
---
You crouch-walk so you dont activate her traps, yes. Urban Evasion (Nea) is super good. Small game just notifies you when you face the trap. You can destroy her traps by shining your flashlight at em
---
So that means The Hex Girls are Min, Laurie and Meg
---
I feel like, to reduce the heavy RNG and make the traps a more consistent time-waster, there should be escalating odds. The first box should be a fairly low chance to have your key with each successive box having an increased chance. Maybe even make the odds lower if the trap isn't active yet.
---
You're doing God's work 
---
Has to be hooks.
---
In my phone, when I scroll uo and down this thing appears to be moving. 
---
Well they did sell 1/4 of a game.
---
Twice.
---
Meng? Is this a fusion perk? I can't wait for Claudavid.
---
Lol thanks, but I already know them
---
TIME TO HIDE IN THE CORNER FOR 10 YEARS WHEN IT'S REALLY OBVIOUS THE KILLER HAS BBQ.
---
I fucking love the freddy buffs part 
---
Ok So Im wrong. 😂 you need 16 point in the sacrifice category for a merciless killer so wait until everyone's on last hook if you're going to do a mori.
---
Camping as Freddy
---
I gave up on the hatch standoff, as a killer if I find it first I find the closest wall and stare at it while repeatedly smacking it in hopes that this will make the survivor find it soon and hurry the fuck up and take the hatch and end the match.
---
I mean, survivors have been steadily nerfed because they used to be so powerful, so....
---
Playing killer right now is easier than ever. The amount of pallets has been reduced, infinites were removed, exhaustion was fixed. In any game that you play a lot of, you will memorize the map. That isnt a bad thing at all. At the point it becomes a matter of skill. The hatch is fine as is. The thing with it is, you have no idea whether they deserve the escape or not. I've had games where I've escaped with the hatch with 27k points and the rest of my team had below 9k. I shouldn't be cucked because they played terribly.
---
what is going on . I've always seem him as a "passionate"player 
---
On the point of the mori, so long as it isnt an instadown into a mori I dont mind.
---
IM SO TIRED OF GETTING T BAGGED WHEN IM JUST TRYING TO LEARN A NEW KILLER. I PLAYED PIG TODAY AND JUST GOT HER AND WAS REALLY PUMPED TO LEARN, HOOKED EVERYONE ONCE OR TWICE AND KILLED ONE AND THE THREE REMAINING SURVIVORS T BAGGED ME AT THE EXIT GATE. I DIDNT BODY BLOCK OR BM ANYONE AND I JUST HOOKED AND DID MY KILLER JOB. WHY T BAG WHEN YOU WIN!! 
---
Legion is garbage without their best addons. And even with them it's nearly impossible to kill everyone. He can tunnel well and gets 2 kills consistently. 
---
Not disagreeing that they used to be stupid strong, but the nerfs did go a bit far.
---
Survivors are boring because experienced survivors know exactly what to do in any situation.  
---
I mean, if Freddy tunnels he's just going to do awful. I think more of the problem is it toes the line between being too hard to get out and too easy. Too hard and it's awful for survivors, too easy and you might as well not sleep anybody you aren't immediately chasing as Freddy.
---
Alot of people see flapping or clapping etc on the hook as a sign that the killer is camping you. If the other person isn’t injured they might not get that he is being chased...
---
It is three hits? You hit them once, then one more, take the stun then one last time. 
---
All of this can be done within 20 seconds. 
---
I say get self care frist but we re gonna life forever is a good start for the bloodpoints
---
It's really about options. All perks will not be equal. Ever. There is no point. 
---
FU is worse than BS or bamboozle, but if all you have is FU3 and you want better chase potential its not a bad option, and it's better than BS 1/2 or bamboozle 1.
---
Yes you should.  Its a team game.  
---
KYF is the new Monopoly, just DONT do it lol  
---
This is the best thing ever!!!! ❤️
---
And I did the work of my team, so I get to escape while they die.
---
Trapper is one of the worst killers in the game. You can only trap a limited number of loops, survivors can easily untrap those loops and even if they don't, setting traps costs time and map pressure. Iri Stone + Stitched Bag can be very strong in some maps, but that's about it. 
---
Exactly. Survivor isn't really hard at all once you know what to do.
---
Yeah, that would be nice and would really help but I suppose currently it’s just one of those things that people would only know if they did SWF.
---
Smells like a witch hunt.
---
Sure they HAVE to give maps aways for free... considering the bad matchmaking
---
I do the same if the last survivor wasn’t toxic. This game already has so much toxicity and I like to make it a little better. Plus I play it for fun, not to farm BP.
---
Survivors laugh at and taunt the killer more than be afraid of them...  
---
Camping with Freddy with Insidious and no survivors in dream state.
---
I didn’t know I needed this 
---
I played with you today lel
---
If I'm not mistaken we were against a p2 Leatherface w/ claudette mask that 3 gen stratted at the end.
---
Auto win is stupid and you know it.
---
They are decent but the locations on that map are also really easy to memorize, therefore it doesn’t really matter 
---
They already did for the tutorial. All it needs to do is repair generators to do its job :D but yeah idk if they'd bother
---
How is that an auto win? The killer is the one who got the win in that situation. This game is balanced around the killer averaging 2 kills per game. If you get 3+, you won.
---
There’s like ten traps on the map so you can trap just about damn near every loop. I’d go so far as to say that with meta perks I could 3k rank one survivors damn near every game with brown addons. 
---
Omg, actual strategies can come from it hahahaha. Awesome.
---
And that should change. It's part of why survivors have received so many nerfs. And it's kind of laughable how survivors whine that they've received too many nerfs and need buffs. It's like dictatorships; any side who has been powerful and loses that power isn't going to like it.
---
Good to see that mods allow this but when I post a screenshoot I get removed sure
---
SINCE WHEN DOES SHADOWBORN AFFECT FATIGUE?
---
The little I've seen from him is.... questionable to say the least.
---
I haven't watched Saw but it always makes me mad that he's all like, "I'm helping people". Like no, you just found you're dying and decided to take as many people with you as you can. Wasn't one of the people he kidnapped there because she was depressed after the death of her son, which is a totally reasonable reaction to your child dying?
---
That's how mafia works
---
Same even with ps4 I'm pretty sure it's rank. Im rank 7. Rank 5 before rank reset
---
I play survivor when I'm watching a movie. I play killer when I consider having fun.
---
Yikes that's annoying. Chase music is for sure loud.
---
I'm new to the game and I'm like rank 17
---
Yeah I do that and it generally works almost all the time. Just find where the hatch is in case he chases you and work on generators. They usually don’t expect it. 
---
But deliverance + dismantle = easy achievement farming! (Gotta get the unhook yourself 50 times and break 50 hooks achievements still THEN I’ll never run deliverance again lmao)
---
You will be recorded as 50/50
---
Not a witch hunt at all. When a very popular content creator is displaying problematic behavior I absolutely think a discussion is warranted. And that’s all I’m going to say about that.
---
I mean, the 1/5 needs to be taken into consideration as well, especially as this is an asymmetrical game where the 1 is supposed to be the power role.
---
at low ranks maybe. i’d like to see how far stealthing gets these gamers when killers actually know what they’re doing.
---
Cunts
---
If you think playing survivor is easier than killer you're out of your mind. I got rank 1 as a killer two days after the reset, its insanely easy to 3k+. I'm still sitting around rank 5 or 6 as a solo survivor, hoping my teammates arent brain dead and I can at least safety.
---
Probably before it relys on the killer since dedicated severs are coming we don't need to rely on anyone so yeah they might add something like that.
---
I honestly don't mind the licensed killers being paywall locked.  But their perks should be far more common on the shrine to make up for it, instead of some of the rarest to be in the shrine (Looking at you LF perks, BBQ especially).  I really don't need to have the 12th chance to buy Billy's level 30 teachable when there are far more difficult to acquire perks that I'd like.
---
BBC XD
---
Against actual good survivors, without atleast Purple add ons you'd be lucky to get a kill with Trapper, without camping that is.
---
Survivor's easier than killer lmao.
---
I usually average before reset between rank 8 and rank 4 depending on how much I play that season. So it can get you pretty far, if you know how to loop when you so need to. 
---
ITS A HORROR GAME!  THE SURVIVORS SHOULD HAVE HUGE DISADVANTAGES!  Lol
---
The glaring problem I see is that Legion's power is unavoidable but it can also down you. It needs to be one or the other. I think if Frenzy didn't reduce your bleedout timer and the devs removed the cheesing, it would be a balanced time-waster. They can buff their movespeed to 115% to compensate so they can chase like normal and maybe even use Frenzy to reposition if led to a really strong window or pallet.
---
Thank you all
---
YOU TEABAG ME AT A PALLET OR WINDOW I WILL TUNNEL AND CAMP YOU  SO. DAMN. HARD.
---
THEN EVERYONE ELSE IS FREE TO LEAVE UNLESS THEY MAKE THE MISTAKE OF ALSO TEABAGGING.
---
IT HELPS WITH THE LIMITED VISION LMAO.
---
One time I saw a Wraith using the silent bell add-on and the bone clapper add-on at the same time. Ascended build
---
Idk then rank rest just happened 3 days ago might be cuz of that. But sometimes I never find a game so I jus get off
---
Nah.  The last guy camping the door and being able to escaoe automatically and get extra points for being a coward is lame and boring 
---
No banned perks?
---
Oh my god I thought it was just me!
---
Aha. Thanks. Boooooo. Have to actually try. Plus now I’m never gonna use those moris on my never played killers lol
---
EXACTLY! Tell me one serious horror movie where the people in it acted stupid in front of the killer and didn't get brutally murdered for it.
---
Survivors can see the red stain through walls on low as well, it's an advantage for both sides.
---
Well it could imply that the boxes aren't actually predetermined. The data lines up. Or it could be bad luck. Might want to collect more data to be sure.
---
The killer tunneling and camping hooks to get an automatic kill is lame and boring, yet there's nothing really being done about it.
---
In theory it should. However that all depends on how much effort bhvr will put into dedicated servers. 
---
Keep your nose out of someone's shit you soyboy. 
---
I just seem to be seeing too many people calling him over or underpowered. Just wanted rant about how that annoyed me I guess.
---
Not necessarily less powerful. Just more difficult to do anything with due to controller restrictions, and frames.
---
Once the door opens its just insultingly stupid.  Four dudes run past you and you can't dobshit about it.  Its lame as hell
---
I just think that the frenzy power needs to go. The ability to vault could work as just a cooldown ability on it's own which wouldn't be a problem to me, but the current state is just running around and waiting until his cooldown recharges so he can down you.
---
I agree completely, but 4/5 of the money is better than 1/5. &gt;:(
---
I feel personally attacked :'(
---
FUCK NO, I'M SORRY YOU WERE FACE CAMPED BUT DON'T BITCH ABOUT ANY KILLER NOT RESPECTING SOME MADE UP 4% RULE.
---
What if they're only treating you like a piece of shit because someone else treated them the same way, and they're getting revenge since that's what they deserve and it's only fair.  It's a cycle that continues and makes the game worse for everyone, but it doesn't have to be that way. 
---
The survivors dont have any unspoken rules about what they can and cannot do.  If there is one generator left and you finally catch somebody you have every right to camp them.  What?  You should run off and let your only kill escape because thats good sportsmanship?  
---
If you're gonna say he's "problematic", at least accuse him of something. Problematic behavior could be a million things, specify so we know what charges you're bringing him up on. 
---
It’s not that people struggle to survive against it. The problem is that it’s literally impossible to survive against if they tunnel you. 
---
No struggling if you can’t survive to begin with.
---
......ban killers.....?
---
*ban killers?!?!*
---
**BAN NURSE BAN NURSE BAN NURSE BAN NURSE**
---
You are probably daydreaming of sucking whatever thats why you talked about it so much. Bunch of immature kids that are unhappy for not getting 4 kills lol...
---
Not unless you have Blood Warden or NOED, and both are easily countered. It's dumb as hell, and I can't wait for the devs' fix to the end game.
---
If there are only two people left, one is on the hook, and you know where the hatch is you have every right to camp it. What? You should run off and unhook them and let your only chance of escaping disappear because that's good sportsmanship?
---
She's actually slower. 
---
Yup I got one of mine removed as well because of the apparent "no salty post game chat" rule, yet I see them here all the time 
---
You just poked yours into someone else’s shit ya cuck.
---
To be fair, you can't survive against any killer if they tunnel you. 
---
It can't even do that all the time... my bot just crouched and stared at the gen, and others had their bots do the gen backwards??
---
Personally I dislike tyde a lot but I am curious what behaviour your talking about. 
---
There’s a number of things it could be so I’m just wondering what specifics you’re bothered by.
---
Wrong. You can loop a killer for 5 gens with Windows and pallets. Not legion
---
In your GameUserSettings.ini, you can tinker with the different graphical effects affected by this setting and more selectively adjust your visuals, that way.

Everyday I comment people try to get into fights with me. Usually it's over things that aren't even very upsetting. Like saying, "I love cupcakes" and receiving the disproportionate response of, "I HATE CUPCAKES SO YOU'RE A CUNT!"
---
DOWN THEM AND THEN CHASE THE FARMER. DENIES SAFE UNHOOK AND SLOWS DOWN THE GAME ENOUGH WHILE YOU CHASE THE ASSHOLE.
---
What language is being spoken? It sounds nice.
---
You have been reported for witch hunting. This is not the place to witch hunt
---
Sometimes mods aren't online. When they do come online they probably will remove this, after all no salty messages allowed. 
---
All right, problematic behavior such as harassing other content creators online for days on end, blocking anyone who disagrees with him, calling women thots, and liking tweets calling other female streamers whores etc. and this is someone that other male content creators are advocating should become a fog whisperer. 
---
I feel you, but let's be honest. This is on no one but you and the David.
---
I replied to glassia_tower explaining.
---
that's actually genius but shouldn't his body be burnt aswell? 
---
Huge shout out to u/frostbitejo from r/photoshoprequests for making this 
---
Rip that reaction 
---
No 
---
I’m not going to say your wrong about all that stuff being demotivating but it does go both ways.
---
When a Mori is used, the killer camps/tunnels or brings in super strong add ons (the real good shit like instadown hatchet) survivor becomes quite demotivating as well.
---
Basically all I’m tryna say is most if not all of what you said does go both ways and many players forget this. 
---
The game is super fun but the game mechanics are suoer janky.  Why the hell is every match just...  GENERATORS!  Give me a wood chipper
---
That does seem serious. If half of that is true, I would condone a video exposing him. Don't overkill it, cite sources, provide links, and work to be fair. That way, it'll be a reliable compilation of misdeeds. 
---
Even ebony? 
---
That can’t change. Anything that is scary won’t be as scary (read: not scary at all) with experience. The devs are right to balance it as a competitive action game. Because it won’t hold any players as a ‘competitive horror game’. Survivors don’t need more nerfs because we’re far past the point of horror games. And survivors haven’t been godlike in power since early 2017. That is a myth that needs to die. Survivors haven’t even been considerably stronger since the exhaustion nerf. Killer mains need to actually try both sides before they blame their problems on balance instead of strategy. Moreover, survivors don’t need any more nerfs because of the volume of them they’ve received. Getting the same treatment over and over, and having the same set of tools subtracted from over and over, gets boring and frustrating. If they keep nerding survivors, they need to add new perks, or reworks of existing ones, that offer interesting uses, like killers have been given. 
---
For asking for peoples experiences with a content creator for a discussion video I’m making? That is not the definition of witch hunt. I’m not asking anyone to harass or report him or anything of the like. 
---
Hahaha I'd ban Doc.
---
Read the last part of the OP. Actual moris have nothing to do with it.
---
Yeah, they're definitely finnicky. But they said they would add more tutorials in the future which means they might plan on revisiting bot AI again.
---
Then they're idiotic. I'm not saying it's okay for Person A to treat Person B like shit, causing Person B to treat Person C like shit.
---
I'm saying if Person A treats B like shit, then B can treat them like shit back.
---
Yeah, all DLC are reasonably priced (and tend to go on sale by the time something special (Steam sale or promotional free weekend) rolls around the corner) and the cosmetics featured are often memey/seasonal or something you buy purely because you like the look of it.  Outside of maybe the DLC there's nothing that really feels 'must buy' unless you really like certain cosmetics.  
---
We are not worthy
---
Definitely. I have no intentions of making it a video simply hating on the guy. And this is why I made this post asking for people’s experiences with him, good or bad. I want to make it thoughtful and informative with credible sources. But now I’m being accused of witch hunting. 
---
Not my proudest fap.
---
Make the video, show it to them, and prove it's not a witch hunt. 
---
&gt; WE ARENT TRYING TO BE SWEATY SWF 
---
FUNNY, THAT'S ALL I EVER GET PLAYING KILLER AROUND THIS TIME. I CAN'T GO NEAR THIS GAME FOR A WEEK AFTER THE 13TH.
---
This is untrue. Every killer aside from legion and nurse can be looped. Nurse however, has a few counters and takes some level of skill whereas legion takes practically no skill and will win literally every chase as long as they have VERY basic game knowledge.
---
XD in all seriousness, every time ive used this build, ive always gotten at least 3 DCs. Tends to happen right after the obsession is killed and Dying Light activates.
---
THEN WHY DO I KEEP FIGHTING PURPLE AND RED RANKS AT RANK 14
---
Well there was that one Halloween movie with the Busta Rhymes character. And we all know that movie was *totally* not hated by anyone for that, amirite?
---
Oh I will! Thanks for understanding. 
---
legion is not a twink
---
he's a TWUNK
---
This. The counter to blood warden is to just leave the fucking game when you can lol
---
I like to play stalthily. My favourite survivor build has Urban Evasion, Dance With Me and Lythe for disappearing into the night. I'll do generators, unhooks and heals, "team player" stuff. I can survive a chase when I need to but I find looping a little dull.
---
Having a confrontational team mate is good though, it helps me go about my business.
---
Understandable points, thank ya.
---
Gotta remember that the killer could've been playing scummy to get kills. Obviously you can play however you want, but there's a lot of times that ill get against a scummy killer that will 4k solely from being scummy and teammates will talk trash. Situational.
---
Your JenDenise subscription is running out, hurry on out and renew it ya lil scamp.
---
THEN YOU DO UNDERSTAND HOW LEGION AND HIS POWER WORKS. YOU STAB PEOPLE.
---
THERE IS NOTHING WRONG WITH HOOK CAMPING AFTER ALL GENS ARE POWERED.
---
It’s too late to make the game scary again nerfing survivors even more into the ground will just make them lose players at this point
---
Did they change the classic Scooby doo theme
---
Insta-downs on all gens done should be baseline. Or maybe just a big reduction in attack recovery time, whatever, but the point is, the 9 million kilometres surrounding the exit gates shouldn't become a safe zone the moment they're open.
---
He ain't wrong about the twitch thots though
---
And one could argue none of them are really must-need.  Only one who might be considered such is Leatherface for BBQ &amp; Chili.   
---
Lol I don’t watch JenDenise. But thank you for providing me with some more evidence of how Tyde Tyme and his stans behave. 
---
I was thinking maybe a boost to Bp. I’m 1/3 to Devotion 4 and I would t mind maybe a 10% boost per devotion level. I already have all of the perks unlocked so I don’t see a reason why not something simple like that
---
okay then father grantedtoast
---
Looks like you got played
---
&gt;You can only see everyone in terror radius while you have frenzy active, and it doesn't last very long.
---
There's plenty of perks that increase terror radius. (Distressing + Montior &amp; Abuse) There's also add-ons that make it last longer. (Also Iredescent Button makes his terror radius global but it's Ultra-Rare so meh). I've played Legion a decent bit to see how people play against him and hopefully learn some things. Every time I play as him most hits lead to finding at least one more survivor. I've never had a game where I couldn't see another Survivor in the majority of my Frenzy's. Getting to them is a whole other issue but the fact that I can see them and start the chase is what counters stealth.
---
&gt;He does terribly in matches where everyone is doing their own thing, but when everyone groups up and tries to win by just getting in your face and blocking for each other/body blocking when you do hit someone, he cleans up.
---
This is every Killer except Nurse and Hillbilly (who wins in both scenarios). Legion isn't overpowered. If he could win in both scenarios he would be overpowered. He's just ridiculously unfun to play aginst.
---
 People on both sides complain about gen-rushing. If the only way to counter a Killer is to genrush then you're just playing a loading bar simulator. Also if body-blocking hooks is that big an issue they just added a perk so you never have to deal with it again. (Aside from obsession DS since pausing wiggle bar does nothing).
---
Plus, working as a team is another great aspect of DBD. A Killer who's power is to directly counter that is really lame design. (While Billy is great at it, his chainsaw wasn't designed to just slug or be useless).
---
This is unpopular.
---
KILLER, OBVIOUSLY THOSE SCRATCH MARKS ARE FROM YOU CARRYING THE SURVIVOR AND NOT A TEAMMATE 1M AWAY.
---
Shut up
---
I tend to not know where the door is.
---
Could’ve had bitter murmur and one shot him with chainsaw 
---
But how was I supposed to know if the killer has Blood Warden or not? And I mean literally every survivor heals at gates
---
Which is still a ridiculous concept imo.  It means matchmaking for new maps potentially takes longer.  I like how Vermintide did their DLC maps where you can play them as long as one person in the party has access to it.  
---
The problem is that Killer's unfun because of all the nonsense mechanics they have to put up with, while Survivor's unfun because the Killer can just choose to end anyone's game if he wants by tunneling them. Killer's problem can be fixed with non-shitty balancing, and I can certainly think of a few ways to fix the Survivor's problem, but the game is so built around that that BHVR would have to change a lot just to fix it, and we all know they won't.
---
They need a big update to fix the problems.  But they won't.  They are already making money 
---
You don’t know you just leave and don’t worry about the extra 100 blood points every game lol
---
No. He replied to a female who tweeted to him: “be gone, thot”. 
---
Now this was cute.
---
The problem with that is that if the pig catches you midway through your box search, and knows which boxes you probably searched, when she downs you again she can try and put you further from the remaining boxes.  The more you backload the odds of getting the trap off, the more kills she would get by far because she could also play around that backloaded odd and loosely figuring the pattern of boxes the survivor could have used.
---
Your right, so is the hillbilly hes a lot more difficult to control. There are sometimes i wish i did have a pc that runs it. But other times i don't
---
Heh, that's a solid meme. Not really anything to complain about
---
Imo keep 32k cap the same but remove the 8k cap on each category. This way you can't abuse farming but you also can get the cap (or close to it) a lot easier.
---
Show me a 15 year old who can turn a huge wooden pallet into splinters with 1 kick and you'll have a point.
---
ENTITY IS MEGA DISPLEASED
---
The game is broken AF!!!!! Please shut it down for matinence!!! 
---
I wish I had friends to play this game with
---
Do people really have trouble seeing p3 Claudette? It's only the brown clothes that give me trouble.
---
Personally I think his power just doesn’t work in this game. It needs a complete rework but maybe someone can prove me wrong
---
It may be worse in NA and EUW because the regions are bigger and there are more wannabe proplayers looking for someone to blame for being stuck masters. 
---
Maybe dbd is more toxic than OCE LoL but in my experience it doesn’t even hold a candle to the lol community in the bigger regions. I’ve sandbagged hard in dbd and gotten nothing worse than a fuck you, I’ve 1v9d games in LoL and still been told to consider late term abortion on myself 
---
It'd be really cool if we got a story mode following Benedict Baker and crew.
---
Doing spirits Mori on the obsession as they run towards the exit gates is one of the most enjoyable things I have ever experienced in dbd.
---
It's worth running on occasion for that novelty alone.
---
How do you deal with someone that waits by a pallet to blind you when you break it. Do you just have to accept your fate and get blinded by the flashlight? Because I don't think you can chase them back and forth as they keep sliding on the pallet due to obstacles around them?
---
(I don't play killer much and just was taking a flashlight to the face at every pallet and it was very annoying. Later in the game they somehow came across three flashlights, but I dealt with that by looking away.)
---
I mean you got your few extra points tho... :p
---
You shouldnt need other people to tell which perks are good, especially ones so straight forward.
---
And no they shouldnt, thats one of the only things in the game you dont control, plus it would be just lead to people getting meta perks instantly
---
My exact reason sir. (or ma'am idk)
---
I like making the survivors my pets once they have traps on there head. So I will tunnel the person off the hook but then not hook them again. My children will listen to me. Also if you can't tell I don't play pig seriously.
---
It’s definitely possible it was an attempt to lag switch. Keep in mind even on PC there are some issues currently with becoming “desynchronized” according to the game.
---
I’ve also heard playing games as killer does something awful to console. For now I guess you can just chalk it up to a pretty good job so far.
---
Those at least make sense 
---
F
---
I love this! I've always wanted a way to increase the survivor/killer slots and this just fits. Of course, the bots would be a bit finicky but if worst comes to worst it could just spawn in a model that didn't attract crows.
---
True, they also said that prestiging affects blood webs, and that the shrine is random. Can't trust any information that doesn't come from actual player tests.
---
Broken =\= op
---
since when is pig a crutch killer
---
This post is clean and wholesome.
---
It is not all that easy to get that third strike against good survivor's, but What about Myer's OP Add on's looking through walls, and all game Noeds come on.
---
*He's theeere, the phantom of the bing-bong!*
---
its because they don't really care if you did good or not, they just want to upset you because they are angry they lost. you will be called bad no matter what so just ignore it
---
Makes me sad to see you’re getting downvoted just for saying you like Legion. Like honestly makes me really sad.
---
Legion is hella fun to play - chases feel fun and engaging, and if you break off after hitting someone in Frenzy to apply Deep Wounds to someone else, it definitely feels like you’re playing the way the Devs intended. But just sitting there holding M1 isn’t fun for survivors.
---
The problem does come down to the design of Deep Wounds and Legion, sadly. When they reworked Deep Wounds and the way Frenzy interacts with it, I saw the problem coming from a mile away. But i think it’s important to look at killer design now and when the game first came out.
---
If Legion could just two hit people and down them while Frenzied, Legion would *actually* be overpowered. Instantly would become a top-tier killer, too. Nurse can teleport through solid objects and two-hit people, granted her ability takes some skill to use.
---
But what if Nurse was made today? Would she have some sort of Deep Wound effect applied to her M1s after Blinking? If she did, would people complain about Nurse the way they do Legion?
---
No, I sadly don’t have any ideas on how to “fix” Legion. The only thing I could think of would be a Freddy-esque mechanic where while within Legion’s terror radius, any Deep Wounds applied by Frenzy don’t decrease. It could help prevent moonwalking cheese, but ultimately I’m unsure how it would actually play out balance-wise.
---
If you have a team that spreads out against legion, legion cant really do anything. I think legion should be able to heavily punish groups of survivors who don't actively try to prevent the last 3 gens from being together. 
---
Legion has very few useful perks. If deep wounds was affected by the healing perks, it would at least allow for some variation on legion builds. In their current state, their playability will go stale pretty quick.
---
If they gave legion a 5% movespeed boost, they would have less incentive to use their frenzy in a chase, because it offer less of an upside eith the same drawbacks tee hat it previously had. By buffing deep wounds legion would have more of a reason to use frenzy to chain it into multiple survivors. If it ends up being too strong, BH can tweak the cool down of frenzy or the decay of the deep wounds bar while maintaining hos unique playstyle as a killer.
---
I'd take that side over ScottJund who has a deep desire to be pegged by the Huntress or JenDenise who is 30 years old and hangs out with 18 year olds. 
---
fuck no if i wanted single player content i'd play a single player game, this is like asking for CSGO or OW to have a story mode
---
Use whispers
---
^agreed
---
It’s part of the great culture common in this community. It’s all in the love of the game
---
Humility is a good trait to have. Good on you.
---
We just have to wait, i already have the auric ready for her
---
I asked the same thing, was just called trash and no further response. Ah well though xD
---
-_-
---
Okay, well, at least I've been explicitly clear now. =]
---
Anyways, Frank's Mixtape—as it stands—is boring. Thus, it needs to change.
---
Just adding more hits before the survivor is downed would be the lazy way to fix this add on.
---
On a side note: does any of the legion's add ons have a downside? Like, maybe that's why people hate them so much; since all they get are positives from add ons, they stay godly because it's only that. Perhaps do something like Judith's Tombstone and slow legion way the fuck down if they use Frank's mixtape? Make the duration shorter if they have shorter cooldown. Increase the cooldown if the duration is increased. 
---
You know: balance that shit!
---
Just a thought. 
---
Killer shack? No. Basement? No. The Fuck Hut? No. Apparently we were all wrong.
---
Hmm, you know what you're right. 
---
Survivors should start the game by running around for two minutes, gens locked down, after two minutes the survivors can start to work on gens if they haven't been found, hooked, and killed yet☺
---
Another thing: while leveling your characters, get them to the level they need to be for the teachable you want. When I first started, I leveled Nea and Claudette both to 40 before starting on Kate. I’ve mained Kate since then, but something I did before I prestiged her the second time was I unlocked all the teachables I wanted. So I got up to Bond from Dwight, WGLF from David, Borrowed Time from Bill, etc. Then once I P3’d Kate and had all those perks on her I started unlocking everything else and getting it on Kate. I’m actually really close to getting Jeff (one more account level) and I’m gonna dump my BPs into him for his teachables and get them on Kate.
---
I believe it was TydeTyme that did a video on how to cheese the bloodweb (level efficiently). I highly suggest watching it, as I still cheese bloodwebs while leveling.
---
I hope this extra bit helps you, as I had to figure this stuff out on my own D:
---
It’s moments like this that make this game great. Survival. 
---
Haha I paid $5 for bbq. I don’t care if no perks is cooler, I gotta get my monies worth. 😅
---
Careful m8. Survivors get hella salty when you mention gen rushing 
---
?
---
He or she
---
Invisible Wraith camping with the bone clapper, the add-on that lets you see auras up to 12m, Huntress Lullaby, Sloppy and Thanataphobia
---
I have all the dlc’s except for legion and out of all of them the pig is my favorite. For a killer she’s pretty scary because she has a great stealth aspect to her and her power is great for slowing down survivors. When survivors have bear traps on theirs heads they usually run around the map and expose themselves more easily. 
---
Also she has an adorable stun noise so pallet stuns don’t hurt your soul as much. 
---
Usually at the end of the dlc we geta sort chance to buy the cosmetics for shards but they are really expensive
---
You gotta think, before DBD their biggest claim to fame was Naughty Bear.
---
Nice of them to actually finish the game, moat times when I cleanse the dulls and the last gen pops they just ragequit there and then
---
I TEND TO STICK TO SURVIVOR AND I PROBABLY WILL CONTINUE TO. PLAYING KILLER  GENERALLY JUST BUMS ME OUT BECAUSE EVERYONE SEEMS TO BM SO MUCH 
---
I’ve yet to see desync myself as a killer but I’ve been in-game with a friend who was streaming who had it happen to them. The killer was also streaming, so she clipped it and showed it to him and the guy said he legitimately felt bad cause it clearly wasn’t what he saw in his game.
---
2.4 bugs have been rough, my dude.
---
Don't have it on all of my killers
---
Are you this kind of a loser irl as well? Go make your little detective video, little bastardo
---
I don't know why they choose Myers often. In my opinion, Clown is better but people rarely choose him. 
---
I thought fireup was a killer perk
---
They don’t say where you go. Probably into a much more torturous level of hell 
---
I’ve had it happen to my nea once and a while 
---
You clearly didn't focus in finding this sooner
---
Lmao too true which makes those bonding moments all the better!
---
My normal add on is never sleep and susies easy to get in the web and gives you frenzy a good speed and fast cooldown
---
Fun and simple, good for chill games.
---
Perfection
---
This is very good advice! I thank you! I actually didn't finish that video you mentioned from tydetime, I will finish it. All the help here has been fantastic! Yours included! Thank you friend!
---
Haha oh yea I know I wanted to prove a point so I got 4 friends we got toolboxes and put on leader at rank 8 and we had the game done in 2 mins everyone survived and we did it again and again same result 
---
Ooh, I need to try that.
---
I second Meyers. I usually don't like playing killer, but I usually have a good time playing as Meyers. 
---
Exactly, and they go "well the killer should have slowed them down" as if the killer can chase 4 people at once
---
I don't know, that third gg seems pretty salty to me
---
As a killer main. I can confirm
---
This shit happens to me in 70% of my matches in every rank
---
I do it while switching items with friends. If im prestiging or they are we do this and just exchange items.
---
Woke
---
You are way cuter. Nice job
---
Swedish
---
Well I've lost ranks too. It's not the matter of "fixing the game", rather fixing a feature. The fact that a killer gets bloodpoints for a survivor dc and  the survivor doesn't makescthe game feel like its ripping off some survivors.
---
See, the thing about the “insult, ragequit” is that the insult has to be followed by a ragequit, it loses all value if you just stay in the lobby
---
This video makes me want to kiss MCote
---
Aye I play nurse I’m currently rank 7 so I have an idea what I’m doing even with a powerful killer I got screwed over and  I killed one of them and they said I’m bad and that they should be ALLOWED TO GEN RUSH it’s a survivor thing I’m just not going fast enough:/
---
i USUALLY JUST DO BASEMENT FACE BUT YOU'VE INSPIRED ME TO DO THIS WITH TRAPPY BOI, GOOD LUCK IN THE FOG
---
I'm not a good killer at all, so this is me after a couple of killer matches
---
I tried that build for the first time not too long ago.
---
Sadly it went the predicted route of me reaching tier 3 as the gates were opened, however 1 hapless survivor wanted to give me a final hit at the exit border :)
---
I guess she technically *did* escape when i threw her dead body over said border, and we both had a pretty good laugh about it in the post-game lobby :p
---
Bit of a random story time, but i wanted to share my little moment of a bad game gone good.
---
Entitty *Aroused* you mean
---
Nah you got it right, it's just that they aren't fun to play against because their power doesn't guve survivors any chances.
---
Remember these are the same people who claim camping/tunneling is cheating when it's really the same thing as gen rushing 
---
Yea how would you fix gen rushing?
---
Maybe just keep the pallet vault and scrap the rest of the ability? (Cause that's at least something no other killer can do... Nurse doesn't count.)
---
No more speed boost, you're at 110% movement speed: deal with it. 
---
They can figure out what to do with the rest of the add ons. :/
---
Another option could be that EVERY attack legion does applies deep wounds. Then, obviously do something about Frank's mixtape still.
---
You could also make it to where survivors don't leave scratch marks when deep wounds is applied, and the bleeding frequency is slowed considerably if the survivor starts the mending process and reaches... Idk, let's say 30%. (So sloppy butcher X bloodhound can't just fuck everyone over every time)
---
Bring back the consistent mend meter that was in the PTB—if for nothing else, the thing I just suggested.
---
There's a ton of things they can do to balance, or at least make them more... Fair? Certainly weaker, but no longer unbearable to play against.
---
I really like the idea behind Legion, many people one killer. I wish they'd done the "many people" part a little better though. Plus Susie is adorable.
---
Frenzy is a really neat ability and I like how it works, but I do think it should be reworked or tweaked a bit.
---
Gotta love survivors not doing totems then claiming noed needs a nerf 👍
---
This hurts me in multiple ways
---
*distant obscenities*
---
Someone smack that damn overblown Cheeto already! 
---
Myers is a lot of fun, and has a strong lategame. Plus the typical halloween soundtrack you get with it is nice. 
---
I will finally be able to die peacefully  when it releases but not a second before.
---
Billy is the name of the puppet from Saw.

---
Yup, NOED, a perk that can easily be stopped from even existing is somehow OP in their minds
---
Comms benefit every player. New or not. 
---
An unskilled player can still make callouts. Can still tell their team what perks the killer has. Where a totem is etc, etc
---
Considering that legion is, not lore wise, basically a survivor turned killer. I'd say legion is to survivors what toxic/nontoxic swf teams with comms are to killers. 
---
I don't want legion fixed until or unless swf comms are unless its a buff. Yea that is on the Devs I agree.
---
Killers can't counter swf teams that want to be assholes 
---
Toxic swf can't really counter legion
---
Like a taste of your own medicine kind of deal. 
---
Probably unintentionally, but that just how I feel about it.
---
Exactly I’m playing survivor Rn and I don’t even need the op build 2 people on a gen is so quick!
---
Oh no, I'm starting a discussion about a problem of the game, clearly I'm just being a little bitch eh?
---
Oh yeah definitely experienced that. It's crazy how fast they are and how you can barely make contact with them. They blamed my internet for the problems but I tested it right after and all was good.
---
Go play a single player game then dude lmao.
---
Outlast has some hide and seek elements in there go play that. 
---
This is a MULTIPLAYER game 
---
 with a RANKING system so it needs to be somewhat balanced.
---
Agree 
---
Right well give it a try trust me it’s a perfect and should be the only game sold 10/10 no problems with it at all
---
Yeah no surprise. Hes annoying and whines about everything. 
---
Please no, this is not a game for emotes
---
I honestly think that CS:GO, LOL, and DBD all have super toxic communities, but having built in voice chat in CS:GO makes things much worse.  LOL and CS:GO is often just flaming teammates and placing blaim, but DBD I find is made worse because it's asymmetrical and survivors and killers are always mad with each other (sure you get the occasional problems over farming or failed skill checks).  Personally I'd much rather get flashlight stunned, tunneled, or flamed in post game chat by the opposing side than having my teammates flame myself/each other and be tilted for an entire hour or so during a CS:GO match.  I suppose that DBD or LOL would probably be much more toxic with voice comms though.
---
Oh of course, I agree. One on one it’s no brainer, knife person wins. I’m talking as if it’s 3-4 survivors against the knife person. There will be blood spread on both sides, but in theory the overwhelming man power of 3-4 people should still beat the knife guy.
---
Because the majority of players are survivors and they’re going to hate it if the they don’t win and the motherfuckers kill each other through bad teamwork and then say the killers op no there just shit at the game
---
Happened to me a month ago I couldn’t use any dlc killers but I fixed itself when I restarted the game 
---
Really? Not to be mean but is it an issue with your map pressure maybe?
---
Now it's a wet dream.  
---
A horrible, scarring wet dream.
---
That face somehow give me goosebumps
---
As a killer, I don’t need anymore help on the game 
---
Nah.  It doesn't.  
---
Dude, its a pretty good game. No game is going to be perfect. I play killer and survivor and that helps me know what to expect from each side. 
---
Trust me when I play killer I hate Dwight and that is why I kill him first. But honestly if every game of yours is ending super fast then I would rework your strategy. You should be slaughtering them not the other way around. 
---
Did not mean to sound so rude earlier, but we can't really complain about gen rushing when that is the way the survivors escape. There are plenty of ways to delay their progress.
---
Hopefully he doesn’t get palleted during the chase
---
Like the 5th time this has been posted.
---
If it will stop players from hating legion, then do it :(
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
You play nurse on PC?
---
😂😂😂
---
It should be a nod or shake of the head
---
Sadly he will eventually learn the community is really toxic...Dozens of players D/C'ing just because you have a good offering(Why can the other team see it?) and always telling you how you should play "fairly"...in translation...what works best for me to go against. And don't forget all those high-ranking douches joining alt/"friend" account to play low ranked killers. Games a mess and the devs are somehow okay with it.
---
Fuck, I'm just throwing ideas out there. I never said you couldn't get away from legion. If you recall, it was you who said if he hits you then you should just start mending because there's no point in trying to run. (Read back in your earlier post, it's there, I promise.)
---
If you have any better ideas, please share. Otherwise stop complaining, when I'm just speculating *starting points* towards a fix.
---
(Honestly I love how quickly you flipped your tune on me, caught me quite off guard. Perhaps I half expected you to disagree, but I had no inclination that what you had to say would read so hostilely. I love it! I truly I do. Surprises are among my favorite things in life, and that did it rightly.)
---
Furthermore, and it's my fault for not being clear on this, so I apologise, but the first and second suggestion are supposed to coincide with one another.
---
At any sluggish rate, I did so very much enjoy our conversation, but I'm afraid I must pick it back up later—should that prove necessary, of course. I need to finish reading a novella that is dryer than an eighty year old conservatives humor... (In fact, I believe that is all too accurate to be considered an analogy, and not a description. Hmm...)
---
Okay! Have a lovely day! &lt;3
---
One piece of advice, friend...Turn your in-game chat OFF and play how you like to play!
---
Yo I mean that thing that killers can already do just by changing the direction they look. Wow. Imagine that.
---
Shut the fuck up. People like you make this subreddit insufferable, having a smart ass answer for every valid criticism. Just because there's a perk that finds people, it doesn't mean holding the game hostage should be allowed.
---
The funny thing is, Activision is trying to publicly shame anyone who doesn’t buy the pass but all the pass holders are congratulating them on not buying it, Activision also ended up showing that community that 90% of players haven’t bought the pass. I fucking love all the shit Activision/Treyarch is getting for this
---
OH MY GOD
---
THIS NEEDS TO BE IN THERE. The 10 generator, and 10 hook death.
---
No. He was attempting to hit my friend after he got unhooked so he could secure a kill and farm but I dashed left and took a hit for him.
---
I did not have borrowed time on my Nea. 
---
Nice, the disciples of that haggard crone and her toad-faced boyfriend have come here to push their hysterical agenda.  It is pretty amusing to see how Jen/Scott cannot take an ounce of criticism and have to rally their disabled fanbase to "fight the injustice" that is a guy who can barely get 100 viewers most of the time.  
---
Steam overlay, looking at your played with (i think it's played with) shows you who the killer is.
---
The leader change is also that it doesn’t work at all on gen repairs any more. 
---
When the fuck do you ever see a survivor give the killer free kills and free downs and shit lol they do everything in their power to get everyone out alive.
---
LeArN hOw To SwInG bEtTeR
---
I can't imagine unhooking someone being feasible when some fuckin unit just lobs a glass bottle at your face.
---
It just needs a small tweak on the numbers 
---
This must be the Spirit’s home 
---
Oh no worries there. I’ve been playing for years 😅 I was just really high when I posted this. 
---
It isn't fine it's garbage unless it's a basement build and even when it's a basement build it barely shows any effect
---
You won’t see desync as the killer, DBD is a peer to peer game and the killer is always the host (which is why the game always ends if the killer leaves but always continues if survivors leave) and desync occurs because the two instances of the game are different but the killers game super-cedes the survivors games. When the two instances of the game are conflicting, the survivors instance of the game is reset to match what the killer sees, because they are the host. 
---
I don’t think the recent desync issues are because of bugs. I think it’s just too much going on in the game these days with the new engine and all the aura perks and effects and too much information being constantly processed on four separate connections to five separate instances of the game that all have to be synced to the hosts game and something somewhere in the code is not keeping up. I never used to have survivors complain about desync issues on my host, but the past six months it’s every time I play. I mostly dismissed it as salty players until I got to see a vod of it happening. 
---
I played against a 4 stack SWF with twitchies and was surprised when they blew up with salt and accused me of cheating in postgame. The game had been perfectly smooth for me. I watched their vods and there was one really bad moment where one of them thought they had gotten away from me, and then basically teleported onto the hook. It’s pretty clearly not cheating from anyone who played Halo 2 extensively back around 2006 and got to experience what abusing peer to peer connections actually looks like, but I can see why they assumed cheating. In actuality, they desynced from me mid chase and by the time their game had resynced to my game, I had downed and hooked them, so that’s where their game reset to. 
---
They all reported me for cheating, and I haven’t been playing much since then. I’ll just wait for dedicated servers so I don’t get banned because peer to peer games lag and desync. 
---
Teabag with Amanda
---
But don’t worry, hitboxes aren’t fucked.
---
Well, at least i flaired the post appropriately.
---
Well I dont really consider survivors playing nice if they are farming with the killer. That's a mutually beneficial situation where everyone gets tons of points. That's still selfish behavior, and the second the killer betrays their trust the survivors will definitely stop farming. Being nice as a survivor would be like "oh we just shit on this guy, let me go have him kill me" or just letting him win chases for no reason. Those situations are what is equivalent to a killer "being nice" by letting the survivor that just got unhooked unsafely go free, etc.
---
Meng? Is that Meg and Feng scissoring?
---
Personally I prefer Dake, aka David and Jake but I support your right to ship Meng. 
---
Ok, so are we stopping camping/tunneling as well, along with gen rushing? If they are the same, why should only one side be stopped.
---
Was this intended for me? I’m the only who brought up nurse in this post so I’m going to assume so and clearly if that’s the case you didn’t read my post as I said nurse is not a loopable killer. 
---
Killer. Farming is boring. I just move us along
---
Tell that to the urban evading claudette trying to get you to disconnect on swamp
---
There is counterplay to all of it... What are you smoking kiddo. 
---
Very well played dude great job!👍👍
---
Dear Sasuke you can't kill TRUE evil
---
*Nea goes into EW3 too*
---
Dude I’ve been called facecamper/tunneler/every bad name you can think of about 80% of my games. I played a game as a lvl 1 hag (just needed dailies) against all lvl 50s, hooked two of them and didn’t even kill one, and they still went full bm in endgame chat. There are toxic killers, but for every one toxic killer there’s 4 toxic swf survivors. Eventually you get teabagged and flashlight clicked enough you just stop caring about being nice unless a survivor specifically stands out as good to you and sometimes you give em the hatch
---
I do. But that's not even the point. Don't generalize like an asshole. that's all I am saying 
---
the entity is displeased 
---
That’s John Kramer. Buckle up fuckos, cause I’m about to learn you a thing or two about the Saw franchise. Spoilers, obviously.
---
The first Saw movie doesn’t really factor into Dead By Daylight all that much, other than introducing Amanda Young as a druggy who gets introduced to the Reverse Bear Trap Mk 1. She escapes by cutting open a former cellmate of hers, getting a key from their intestines, and removing the RBT which has a labeled timer of 60 seconds, and not the 150 seconds portrayed in game for whatever reason.
---
The second movie gives us an identity for the Jigsaw Killer, who was revealed to be the corpse present during the entire first game. In this movie, Amanda Young is placed in a house that will open in 1 hour or so, with a group of criminals, all of whom are being poisoned by nerve gas and will be dead before the one hour mark. Their goal is to find various syringes with antidotes in them, a task that ultimately kills everyone but the son of the main character for this movie, Amanda, and one other guy. The TL;DR is, the other guy gets beaten to death with a toilet tank lid, and the main detective is abducted by Amanda once he drives John Kramer to the location of the second game (Which is technically at least the third actual game in canon, but we can stop at Saw 3D here), and the detective gets locked in the bathroom from the first game, and dies later. Amanda is revealed to be an acolyte of John Kramer, and the movie ends. 
---
Saw 3 follows Slow Ass Motherfucking Jeff, who is trying to save John Kramer from dying because of a brain tumor. TL;DR, SAMF Jeff fails, and Amanda is shown throughout the movie to have rigged up multiple impossible traps, which means that she actually shouldn’t be The Pig in DBD, since then the traps would just activate the second a generator activated. Essentially, Amanda gets shot by Jeff, who then takes a saw to Kramer’s throat, and kills him, setting off a shotgun collar which kills her, this is probably out of order because I actually don’t care thst much about Saw 3, and it doesn’t really matter other than to introduce Mark Hoffman.
---
Enter Saw 4, which takes place around the same time as Saw 3, it is shown that the detective from Saw 2 is still alive, and is hanging on top of an ice block, with 2 more sudpended in the air ready to crush his head of the other guy involved in the trial fails. Hoffman is also there, but it is revealed at the end of the movie, which, TL;DR, ends with a failed trial and the detective dying, and Hoffman is revealed to ALSO be a Saw acolyte, who matches The Pig far better than Amanda, simply because he actually makes traps that are escapable and he scores the only kill with an RBT in the entire series. The only 2 other candidates for Pig status are Dr. Lawrence Gordon, who can be ruled out due to being down 1 leg, and Amanda Young, who would be broken clean in half by David, while Hoffman is very much more muscular and has also been shown to not be averse to just going on a rampage, as in Saw 3D, he kills a whole lot of police officers once his identity as an acolyte is revealed. 
---
TL;DR?
---
The old man is John Kramer, Amanda Young shouldn’t be the Pig for several canon reasons, Billy is the puppet, and Mark Hoffman should be The Pig, since he’s the only one capable of moving that quickly and not making the RBT inescapable. What does this have to do with anything? Not much, but it was fun to write.
---
You spend most of the game with God mode enabled. Otherwise you have 3 to 9.5 seconds (baseline is 7) to GTFO once he tags you with Dream Demon. If you're on a gen you can just wait and mash the skill check button. You'll auto fail the first that appears and wake up, then you can run. If no check appears after several seconds you bail and run. Or, you can skip straight to the running. Either way you've got several seconds to reach a pallet or loop where he can't hurt you. Once you're asleep Freddy is just an M1 Killer. His power does nothing to help him in the chase. So he's very loopable. If he hits you then you can self heal at pallets to get a Skill Check to fail and wake up.
---
If he doesn't chase you and just goes to sleep somebody else, just get a Skill Check or find a teammate and you're awake and invincible again. Rinse and repeat until you escape.
---
Maybe the problem is with your skill as Killer. 
---
Uh, the third strike is incredibly easy to get, regardless of how good survivors are. That's kind of the whole reason the add on is hated. Meanwhile, Myers' add ons are all relatively well balanced. 
---
Yea I would love to but you have to play the game otherwise don’t start tell me how do I stop 2 survivors who are on a gen that will take 30 seconds while chasing another one who is a decent player or if everytime I pick up a survivor I get flashlights in my face or body blocked or when I’m playing survivor I get face camped tunneled or my team farms me hm? Because I don’t know but on the topic HOW DO WE FIX THIS GAME where the devs take 3 years to fix one fucking issue 
---
Do whatcha gotta do, pick a favorite, kill 3 drop your fav on hatch. Unless it’s swf Claudette’s, then slaughter them all
---
My pc is aids so not really I play on ps4
---
I mean you threw some ideas onto the internet, I criticized them? Gave pretty good reasons as to why I didn't agree with them. 
---
The way you flip-flop from calm to annoyed to making a snide remark and then to wishing me a nice day is a bit off-putting to say the least. 
---
I haven't been hostile at all, I didn't complain about you throwing out ideas, I gave an opposing argument. Which you can agree or disagree with.
---
REEE TOXIC SWF
---
Ebony moris? Do they not exist? You must be new to the game.
---
No asshole, it would look better with a specific animation for it rather than just having a spaz attack with your mouse or analog stick
---
jesus christ that was too close at like 3 different points
---
The system must be changed. Return offering to survivors if killer DC, same as items and add-on. Problem solved.
---
Well 2 days of more playing and it still happens alot, still losing items... zzzzz any thoughts of ranking up just doesn't matter at this point. so many items and ranks lost because of this rip
---
So in essence they made one of the legions perks, discordance, useless as there's no point in co-oping on a gen anymore? Clutch. 
---
I’m not entirely sure what’s going on and why the community dislikes tyde. I started hearing about him from a friend about 5 months ago and I’ve heard that he’s disliked since then but I’ve never understood why. I remember he explained on Twitter that the tweet he liked calling Jen a whore was liked because he wanted to show he read it. I’m still very conflicted and without solid evidence I can’t voice my opinion. Same with OchiDO and others like them. 
---
You just suck. You can't get kills withouy camping and tunneling.  Efficient it seems, haha 
---
Played against Legion the other night in "The Game"... Found a dull totem. Started cleansing. As it hit about eighty percent done, the exits opened and NOED spawned on that same totem. Didn't even have a shot to use against us. 
---
“You’re a tunnelling bitch” - the nea that used a pallet, tea bagged then flashed you and moon walked out the door because you decided to go chase someone else 
---
I’ve had my internet doing weird shit, like just cutting out midway through missions in Warframe, and since I like playing Killer, I can’t do shit until I figure out what the fuck is going on.
---
I said there was counters to SWF, not every aspect of SWF. Don’t act like a dink. 
---
I suspect that’s what you do most matches if you find SWF such an issue as the vast majority of them are not very good. 
---
I don’t have anything to say to you as you didn’t provide me with anything to answer that you didn’t ask in a rude manner. If you are simply going to be a cunt I’d rather not waste my time. 
---
Have a good one. 
---
I play plenty of both over the past couple years now
---
Yeah sorry, I guess I should have specified I've never seen anyone *complain* about desync while I've played killer. Obviously I wouldn't have seen it.
---
But no, I agree that jumping from 2.1 to 2.4 for the engine was a HUGE jump, and I don't think the devs were quite ready for that jump. We've had so many bugs since the engine update, between some games crashing on load, people Dcing more frequently in load, there's a bug where players highlighted during Legion's Frenzy STAY red, so on and so on.
---
I really do hope that dedicated servers fix the majority of issues we have with desync, lag switching, and just general P2P problems. I'm honestly surprised the game has lasted as long as it has just as P2P. I'd understand if they swapped TO P2P after they stopped working on the game, but to start a game as P2P and then delay switching to dedicated servers was just a bad idea.
---
Legend Feng 👏
---
that image was made by someone trying to insult him btw
---
Yeah nah. The only reason survs have emotes is to communicate two simple ideas. Why do you think bhvr hasnt released the finger guns emote everyone is dying over? Cuz its pointless (pun intended)
---
😁
---
By your logic, survivors could also stand to go play the killer side. The survivor nerfs were rightfully deserved, and this is from someone who's played a nice chunk of survivor for a while. Survivors don't like being nerfed repeatedly, but they forget the killers' game before those nerfs wasn't very good. The game is on it's way to being the asymmetrical horror game the devs are trying to sell it as, but it's still far from that yet. The 1 is supposed to be the power role, after all. Not the 4.
---
Let me pull a Jason and stuff somebody into a wood chipper.
---
As someone who plays a lot of LF killer...how are there that many pallets still left? lol
---
Lmao, the downvotes.
---
No, but I can imagine the salty survivors quitting two games in a row because "I can't respect a pink addons myers" and "You sound real mad about it." I was kind of miffed at the time because I was trying for the achievement and now I dont have anymore tufts of hair, but oh well. 
---
Wouldn’t it be 10 people? I doubt his teammates would be too happy.
---
Sometimes you can mindgame them by turning around an walking backwards if they keep sliding over the pallet again and again. You need to remember that most experienced survivors pay more attention to your red spot than your body. 
---
My point is, let's not forget killers as well when we consider the survivor side.
---
Nice, not even a tbag.
---
Juketsu*
---
Yeah, at worst if lag and desync still happens on dedicated servers, the killer will lag too. Silver linings I guess
---
Iirc, that was a really fast game. By the time the Killer got his first hook, we already had 3 gens done. Then he just facecamped the poor guy to death and gave us enough time to get all 5 gens running.
---
Im just lis tier, but I feel legion is the anti strong survivor. If your playing stealth he doesn’t have any power. If your playing the infinite loop, flashlight save, super altruistic you gonna have issues. But again im a scrub with no teachables and think every killer is tough.
---
Nah, I'm not that kind of player 😊
---
Omfg trapper looks like its his first day at daycare and hes eager to meet new kids and play in the sandbox :3
---
Hit him so hard he lost connection.
---
Which I agree with entirely but the way your comment was formed almost made it seem like you were neglecting survivors. I don’t think that was the case but it just appeared a possibility. 
---
Considering games where 4 survivors actively work towards objectives, I agree. But in reality, you can’t do that. Most of the time there 1-2 players doing gens, the rest just wander around. 
---
Damn!   That is one thing I love about leatherface the intensity of his chainsaw attack ending right behind you. 
---
Nice escape! 
---
Right?! 😭😭 She did an amazing job!! 
---
Clown is a one trick pony which is why I think a lot of people don't like him. He does one thing and he does it very well, he shuts down loops. I enjoy him, Spirit is my favorite killer but he is definitely a close 2nd/3rd.
---
No kidding...Almost every time I use the survivor pudding offering almost everyone disconnects...I'm talking over 30+ players all disconnecting in a single night. I never even have D/Cs any other time I use lesser offerings. That kind of toxicity is what creates more toxic players...It's a game just play it you esports wannabe nerds!
---
Sure I can try it. Brb
---
It's not like they're going to be able to break chase and lose you. They'll run away, and you'll catch them. It doesn't take long at all for the power to charge up at all. 
---
There’s no such thing as gen rushing, the only time there was ever gen rushing is pre nerf bnp ;) 
---
The one thing I learned over the years - the less fitting characters are  for rule 34, the more people will rise up to the challenge. As long as it's humanoid, there will be porn made about it.
---
A killer with good mindgame potential like the spirit we don't really need a ranged killer cos huntress is already a babe and the killer's that slow the game are usually pretty boring I think they should rework some killer's like Freddy, legion maybe even leatherface before adding more killers
---
Deletes every med kit you own.
---
Yea
---
The kind that wants a balanced game?
---
Ranking system in this game is pretty garbage most of the time. It's not an indicator of skill but rather an indicator of experience.
---
Don't worry about whether you pip or depip because you'll rage frequently. Just worry about having fun in the game.
---
I wish they'd change the way the BP system works though. If I get chased the whole game and get facecamped at the end (which I don't care about) I get 8000ish BP. The cap for each category should be removed but the 32k cap should stay. That way I could still get a lot of BP even if I couldn't fill multiple roles on the team. (Gen jockey, Hook Saver, Looper/Distractor). As long as I do my role well I'll get rewarded.
---
Also pig
---
Except you literally can’t 
---
Woosh
---
Nope, the 50/50 thing is absolutely a bug. 
---
It's supposed to be a predetermined box that has your key. That's how the devs explained the power when Pig was released.
---
One box with your key out of all four.
---
25% of people should get it off the first try.
---
25% of people should get it off on the second try (1/3 of the remaining 75%).
---
25% for the third try (1/2 of the remaining 50%).
---
25% for the fourth try (everybody remaining).
---
This not only makes the base traps much weaker, it makes Jigsaw's annotated plan and Jigsaw's sketch absolutey terrible, since they only have an impact in 6.25% of cases.
---
:(
---
No they haven’t, as you can see, it shows his debt actually going away.
---
nope
---
Understandable then
---
That is beyond toxic lol. Where they at least being toxic survivors, if not that is child abuse.
---
I only do this if the killer facecamped or tunelled me.
---
Ruin, bbq, sloppy, and nurses is everyone's build these days. I couldn't tell you off the top of my head, but I know a couple of his add ons increase the terror radius in treatment(shock) mode, and decreases radius in punishment(attack) mode. Distressing is great and also gives you extra bloodpoints 
---
Thanks! I blame it on my teammates, I'm more of a... hook rusher. I need them WGLF tokens, y'know? xD
---
It doesn’t impact the game 
---
This was stolen checl my profile lmao
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=u6i9BsYwspo
---
Leatherface I don't even have a category for. He's not fast, he doesn't slow, no traps, he is just m1. Same for myers but his ability is kinda fun to use
---
I'll consider it thank you! 
---
True true!
---
You're late, but it was earnable lol 
---
There is a specific setting whch goal is to only torture the survivors. Doctor with Ruin, Overcharge, Distressing, Unnerving Presence and a Gideon map offering. These cunts camp 3~4 gens nearby and make it unable to repair. They never hook a survivor, so the only escape is DCing.
---
and I only Camp or tunnel if a survivor t-bags
---
Not really I got plenty of no kills with tape.
---
Victorian Nurse was not earnable through event currency. Shards, yes. Vials? No.
---
I like how behavior was there 
---
How is it woosh 
---
He's using No Mither so he can pick himself up as many times as he wants. He uses unbreakable to charge the Recover bar 25% faster.
---
Freddy buffs is accurate
---
Its too bad KYF is bugged to shit. At least for me :(
---
I only do this at the end of the match, if the killer played well I just wait for the other and leave.
---
It’s no mither, it lets you revive yourself throughout the match, however you are broken throughout the trial.
---
had a bad day? xD
---
Lightweight isn't really worth it at all tbh.
---
Lithe+DanceWithMe is a much more useful/interesting way to utilize scratch marks (or lack there of) as Survivor.
---
Yeah like if one survivor had crazy camouflage skills
---
Gotta get lucky every once in a while :D
---
Pipping is way too easy as it is. Just be happy you didnt hold m1 all game and you actually got to play dbd.
---
If anything pipping should be harder like when emblems first got released.
---
47% can't be accurate lol I pretty much never get the trap off first try 
---
Michael *angry*
---
Nah i get that, personally for me if the exit gates are opened and all 4 are still alive and running I let them all live. 
---
Love it. Legion deserves that loool
---
It’s honestly not that big of an area
---
*laurie loud coughing injured noises commence*
---
Bloody. Party. Streamers.
---
I like Lightweight. It allows me to be at least a little bit more stealthy while still remaining a decent speed around the map. It also allows me to stop running and hide without worrying about my scratch marks staying up forever and giving me away.
---
I was waiting for this. 
---
The only one missing the point here is you. Not everyone gets 80k bp per match as a killer just for existing on the map. So you might not care about the blood points but that doesn't mean that those who play survivor don't. They have to care a little more because you can't even buy 2 items or add-ons in their bloodweb for 9k points more than half the time.
---
What do you mean? 
---
Thanks! :) 
---
Should I save up my shards for the next one? (Freddy main btw)
---
Maybe it has something to do with your antivirus.. could be blocking the connection.. try disabling the antivirus then launching the game..

No it isn’t “on it’s way to being asymmetric horror”. The game isn’t even close to that. And it won’t be. This game has no selling points of horror for anybody with a least 100 hours in the game. It’s just a asymmetric action game. And I play more than a good chunk of killer. I play more killer than survivor but enjoy survivor more. And what’s funny is that whenever people try and say “it needs to be a horror game” they always first suggest balance changes. No mood changes or atmospheric enhancement to make the game actually more unnerving. They actually just want the killer to be far, far stronger than the survivors for brainless wins. Like that makes the game scarier. It doesn’t; all it does is make the game more frustrating for seasoned players. Y’know, the ones who have kept this game alive for two and a half years? If you want a “horror game”, add  horror elements. Don’t just make a particular role stronger. 
---
this was amazing! Great job dood love it
---
So it shortens a long Chase to a slightly less long Chase. 
---
What would you recommend as the ideal setup? So far I got Monitor and Abuse locked down but not too sure what else 
---
Can you elaborate? What are they doing to it? Also is there a source? Thank you in advance.
---
It really isn't. It's pretty easy finding the last survivor with whispers 3
---
Very cool
---
That's nice and all but I don't care. 
---
Time for you to move on. Sorry you dont score well as survivor.
---
* wipes brow *
---
No worries, every Pig player on Xbox just tunnels their traps so I've learned to just not worry about the the Jigsaw.
---
I love it!
---
ohh okay. I got confused because I saw a post about some killer main complaining about how "survivors only focus on gens instead of secondary objectives like totems" and I was mostly confused about it.
---
Git gud
---
Sorry I had to it was there
---
Then say you want the game balanced for the power role instead of saying “I want this game to be scary” even if you’re aware it’s not scary. And like I said, it won’t be especially with the kinds of changes you have in mind. 
---
Just like any other game with level 12 wraith
---
Respect. 
---
I did leave the door there. Someone was gonna kick it
---
There are some loops Legion struggles with if not running increased speed/duration on Frenzy. Legion can also have survivors move through them during the vaulting animation, making it possible to double back over a pallet Legion just vaulted.
---
But if Legion hits someone during Frenzy (specifically a hit that applies Deep Wounds, not one that decreases the Deep Wound bar) auras of survivors*without* Deep Wounds within Legion's terror radius can be seen for the duration of Frenzy. The way to play against Legion and minimize Deep Wounds being spread and gens being slowed is to not be near other survivors (or just generally not all be clumped together).
---
Again, there's design flaws with Legion and I won't argue Legion is perfect. But Legion is what it is and people need to try to give constructive feedback if they want things to change.
---
I agree about leatherface he's just a m1 killer that can instadown if the survivor is out of place and daddy Myers is pretty unique where acts as stealth and just watches you he's the only killer in the game that doesn't necessarily need to down people at the very start to snowball, and Freddy needs a complete rework not just some changes but it's hard to come up with abilities because most good ideas have been done to an extent
---
&gt;And my point is, it's not asymmetrical in the way it's intended to be. The 1 is supposed to be the power role, but any survivor group with decent/meta perks and experience can literally run circles around most killers. That shouldn't be able to happen.
---
Do... do you even read what I write??
---
I will terribly recreat this in minecraft
---
So only a licensed survivor should be able to survive....lmao your responses just get more and more ridiculous.
---
There’s a reason you get downvoted to hell a lot around here
---
Lmao the handwriting really made me crack up 
---
It would be cool to see thru a survivor's eyes for a few moments, turn them to stone, or have an infection ability that could spread to other survivors if they get to close to one another and break up swf healing. Or paranoid hallucinations such as the survivor sees other survivors as the killer for a brief time. 
---
I'm torn they're both very fun but I'll give it to pig
---
Oh shit! I forgot about the stealth characters! Myers, Pig, and Wraith would fall in that class. 
---
Meaning Leather is truly the only killer without a class to stand in
---
When it comes to the lesser evils, Tyde is nowhere near the Jen &amp; Friends level of things that have put this game into a stranglehold.  
---
The latter have actual contact and friendships with the developers and other representatives which plays a big role in why they won't ever be punished.  Jen does nothing different from Ochido yet escapes it because she has a rabid flock of horny virgins and rainbow haired inbreds ready to throw themselves for her.  
---
You're forced to play boring until you get tier 3, which one shots and basically ruins blood point gains. It's been a while since I've played but that seems right.
---
Prestige 3
---
Every time I'm on this subreddit, I see a comment by you being a little bitch. Why the hell should someone playing as a KILLER be nice?
---
Download dlcs or set account to primary.
---
I feel like the first idea would be impossible, or not really useful. Surw seeing through their eyes reveal their location, but theres very few things that straight giveaway a location.
---
Though the second one with paranoia seems really interesting as a passive ability. 
---
I am a Wraith main myself, been there...
---
I want to buy her. I played her by using a splinter and enjoyed it. 
---
If they nerfed him he'd be dead lol
---
500 traps in 50 games... Is this a Pig buff on PTB?
---
Close app and re-open
---
Not really, since they pop right back up for the next one. Lmao.
---
I FUCKING PRESTIGED MY HUNTRESS AND I HAVENT SEEN RUIN SINCE. IM SO FUCKING MAD I CANT GET ANY SORT OF PRESSURE BEGINNING GAME. ITS SO AGGRAVATING BEING GEN RUSHED AND THEN CALLED A SHIITY KILLER WHEN I WAS RANK 3 BEFORE THE RESET. AGGGGGHHHHH
---
Well based on how he is in the movies. The DBD equivalent is pretty much spot on, Leatherface used a chainsaw, placed people on meat hooks, and threw tantrums when people escaped him. 
---
I can't think of anything that he could receive that wouldn't be giving him something he never had originally. Making him bounce of the walls though isn't good because we'd be left with someone you couldn't escape. If there was nothing stopping him or limiting him and he could just touch walls and bounce around, survivors only way of not getting one shot by the chainsaw would be a window or a pallet. 
---
I don't think he needs a rework, his power is easy to use and mildly rewarding aswell as punishing. He's a pretty good killer to learn to get the basics of how a killer should work so you can then learn the more complex killers
---
I find Pig more fun. Her 2 powers are hella fun to use while Myers is not too fun (at least imo). I find Pig’s stealth super neat and can be super useful in the mid to late game with Nurse’s Calling. Her RBT’s are fun too and with the right addons they can be useful in the chase. I like running Rule Set No.2 and the Exhaustion addon. 
---
Shit, u rite. I was just gonna flip the image around myself and use it as a wallpaper on my phone, but the idea of it being the main menu works just as well.
---
I’m a killer secondary as well lol and I played against a SWF today. They didn’t go for gens until about 10 minutes in, after they’d tossed all pallets and teabagged me enough for the entire day. Yes, a lot of survivors are extremely disrespectful so I kinda get why a lot of killers hate em 
---
Had my Ruin found instantly on The Game yesterday
---
Samuel is saying it, so it's ok
---
He has some addons that increase TR in treatment and decrease it in punishment mode. Outside of that, there really isn’t anything. I wouldn’t run Monitor and Abuse because it only increases TR in chase. 
---
I'll keep that in mind
---
You constantly whine about a slugged person DC’ing so the last person can get the hatch, denying your 4K. By your movie logic, that person gave their life for another to escape. So you shouldn’t be mad.
---
She streams almost every day for hours and always starts in the high green ranks or plays with people in those ranks which makes you likely to play against killers that are less skilled.  This means she deranks herself willingly (and even freely admitted it on her Twitch page) from R1/red ranks every time before she begins streaming.  Either she DCs in every game which fucks her team over, she suicides into the killer which fucks her team over, or uses a third party program to set her rank which goes against the rules.  
---
When she does stream these games, it's almost always SWF and shit talking killers that are obviously still trying to learn the game.  Her defense of why she does this is because R1 has too many Nurses/Hillbillies which translates to "I get fucked up too often and tilted."  
---
As for Ochido, no idea.  But allegations without evidence is the new hot topic these days. 
---
Umm yeah, the next one being your next game. But for that particular game, the killer is “dead”
---
You get more points in a game if you coop things though lol... 
---
What people usually call genrushing is pretty much just Survivors being efficient and banging out generators really fast while the Killer is occupied. It's not toxic (unless Survivors make it toxic), but when it happens to a Killer with poor map control it really sucks because there isn't a whole lot you can do about it. (Besides run something like Hex: Ruin, which can still get destroyed right away if you're unlucky.)
---
Yes and no. With Prove Thyself having increased repair + BP stack, I wouldn't say that Discordance would be any more or less useful than before.
---
I highly suggest Make Your Choice. Make sure your far enough away and don’t teleport right away, and only once the save is made. The pink addon that makes teleportation range infinite is really good for this, and the one that doesn’t show the clone of Hag also helps (sorry I don’t know the names). So ideally you’d hook, trap, leave then teleport once a save is made for the EZ instadown. 
---
Other than that, Monitor and Abuse is really good because of her lower TR. 
---
Why do killers hit people on hooks and shake their heads no?
---
Umm no.
---
Seeing as how her original costume makes her look like the boogie man from nightmare before Christmas, i think it’s pretty *eerie* looking.  
---
This also makes her the most realistic human looking killer, which is also creepy in its own way. Every other character either looks overly monster-ish or has a mask, except maybe Spirit (but even she makes weird faces). 
---
Yeah, because DC'ing isn't a mechanic in the game people are supposed to use to hand a hatch escape to their teammate, lmfao. Trying to pass off DC-ing like it's a game mechanic, spare me.
---
On PC my wait times are amazing. Connect instantly. (I get in a game and have 3 survivors and maybe a DC) whether I'm play killer or survivor. Eh. 
---
When people only make and play META, it’s hard to balance because If the Meta calls for ____ then everybody uses it and then it gets nerfed and people move to next best thing. It’s annoying 
---
That would make Freddy even stronger for new players and the same for good players.
---
He was SO CLOSE to getting you with the chainsaw! Amazing escape, great job!
---
Im a slow change kinda guy because perception can skew things. Iv seen too many bad changes in other games due to feedback by people unwilling to adapt.  Again I’m not end game player. I still run screaming when a kill finds me lol. 
---
Your right nothing's really wrong with him but he's fairly dull and when hillbilly is just a way stronger version of the same mechanic I dunno he just seems out of place
---
I fucking love this sub
---
True. Still it sucks that they lock the best perks (im looking at you BBQ) behind a paywall as well. Basically I just want BBQ on the shrine lol
---
Please no. I can't stand more added salt. 
---
Nope. You can buy the spirt, clown and legion with iridescent shards but you have to pay for all the licensed killers 
---
Not defending the salty guy who sent you the message   but, and I guarantee you know this but the killers “internet” plays a huge factor in the survivors chances of well surviving 
---
What’s the difference with P3? Because of the bloody cosmetics?
---
Activating a trap as soon as one generator pops after it was installed would make for a very interesting Ultra Rare add-on...
---
Right on and welcome to Dead by Daylight. 
---
Yes I know that. But the game in actuality wasn’t lagging. Hence why I thought it was so funny that he was just blurting out as many insults he could think of.
---
Oh he certainly is dull, especially compared to the character he inspired who is better than him in everyway. But I'd say leatherface does have the certain advantage of being able to down more than one survivor with his power if they're close enough to eachother
---
Yup, you got it.
---
I get what you're going for here, but also that's literally true of every perk.
---
They can't even code a new killer without the wraith suddenly having hemorrhage on sloppy butcher even after healing...
---
Kate deserved the win!   Good Anna.  
---
No shrine rework
---
-after hooking a survivor in the basement all survivors are auras outside 40/36/32 meters are revealed for 3/4/5 seconds
---
I don't do that, but fair enough, I suppose. Both sides can be equally scummy
---
It was hurting my brain
---
It makes her base outfit darker, which makes Claudette harder to see. 
---
Balance is not achievable with this game, and not really an active goal of the devs.  Overall the game is much more balanced than it gets credit for, but not every part of the game is intended to be balanced for every type of player.  
---
If all 5 players are inexperienced/unskilled then Freddy is a very powerful killer but if all 5 players are very optimal, Freddy often ends up being relatively unthreatening.  Ebony moris are very strong, possibly overly so, but are generally pretty rare(this recent event allowed many killers the opportunity to stock up on a bunch so they are temporarily more common atm).  Brand new parts used to be insanely powerful, allowing you to instantly fully complete a generator.  
---
Perks like self-care and sprint burst make surviving significantly easier, and perks like NOED can net you some otherwise unobtainable kills.  Nearly everything in the game has some form of counterplay, even if the counterplay is more difficult to pull off than the play itself is.
---
Overall there's a good mix of killers/perks to cover what may be good for/against players of varying skill.  Instead of picking one part of the player population and balancing around them, there tends to be a lot of things that are situationally good to allow players to tailor their builds for whatever is most relevant to them. For new players a perk like deja vu may be considered OP since being able to know where generators are is very important.  A perk like decisive strike could be next to worthless if you're rarely going to hit the skill check and even when you do, you don't have enough experience at running to not be downed again within 10 seconds.  On the flip side, there are circumstances where even an ebony mori may not be enough to stop a good group of survivors.  It's all relative and there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to balance for this game.
---
I kind of felt that way to but it would look so cool
---
-groans in storehouse-
---
This is the correct answer. Whether it's supposed to work like that doesn't matter.  There are too many trials for this to be a lucky run.  You've just figured out that, since they didn't know a good way to match a trap to a box, that they just used a 50/50 code.  This would be MUCH EASIER to code, and it makes sense why they did it this way.
---
damn that was too close
---
Jesus fucking Christ I tensed up so hard on that first pallet vault
---
scum scum scum, scum scum, scum? scum scum scum!
---
There are better insults than saying something you don't like about someone and then the word scum.
---
Reinviting people has nothing to do with queue times. Queue times are long because match making is fucked.
---
At the end of the day, you're still using NOED on Michael, so...
---
it can also cancel unhook i think
---
I sure do hope not. I’d rather we get dead by daylight 1 first as this bug we’ve been playing is getting old.
---
Oh, don't worry. It's not going away.
---
The Entity is just selling his debt to a loan shark.
---
goodbye my lover,goodbye my friend
---
I’m not going to spare it of you. When I play killer (Rank 1, multiple times) I don’t feel genuine imbalance geared against me. However a whining vocal minority has decided that the most powerful example of survivors is the standard to balance to, while ignoring the most powerful  (very overpowered) killer options. And geez, give up an inch, get a mile huh? No. Survivors aren’t noticeably stronger. They are stronger,  but they aren’t absurdly stronger in any measure. I don’t know what to tell you other than live with it, I guess? Whatever it is, I wouldn’t want to play a game that you balance as either role, due to either polarized frustration or boredom. You already would play a game that I’d balance, because this current state of the game’s balance is good. This is a good balance by all measures. Killers get enough kills on average, survivors escape enough on average. If you need absurd power, go learn the nurse. You’ll still notice that nobody is scared even when their evasion abilities don’t work. They just get frustrated. 
---
Wiggling is to force a killer to hook you before they can get you to the basement, also Boil Over can be really strong with wiggling especially on indoor maps since the wiggling can make it difficult for the killer to get through doorways, giving you more time to wiggle off and escape.
---
If they are going way faster it could be a 'silent speedhack'. 
---
YOU DIDNT READ CORRECTLY. I DIDNT MENTION SCRATCH MARKS. I MEAN THAT WHEN IM CARRYING SOMEONE AND I LOOK BEHIND ME A SURVIVOR IS BEHIND ME FOLLOWING ME. TRYING TO GET A UNHOOK AS SOON AS I HOOK.
---
Poor Wraith, always pushed to the wayside.
---
Great work!  Once you get to higher ranks the killers will own headphones and it gets harder =) I loved the combo of pallet loop and evasion.  How many hours do you have?
---
Just recently finished watching the entire series. Honestly the first one is by far the best imo. Although I enjoyed how all the characters were tied together, even though it felt forced in some movies, like the twist at the end of the final chapter (I haven't seen Jigsaw yet). The traps are pretty creative too, but now I'm rambling. I really want to buy Pig but I'm scared she isn't that strong :(
---
Also the twist at the end of the first one is a clip I watch often. It's so intense watching the theme slowly get louder as Adam listens to the other rule set. 
---
That is correct
---
I have almost 1000h logged in Dead by Daylight and I still think evading the Killer during a chase is my main weakness. In the end, surviving a chase is more like a bonus. You actual goal should be to waste as much of the Killer's time as you possibly can so your mates can work on gens. Chances are you'll get downed sooner or later anyway. In case you really wanna evade the Killer, the best thing to do is break line of sight, stop running, change directions, then run again. Once the scratch marks trail suddenly stops, they'll start looking around for you, and that's when you run as far from the Killer as you possibly can.
---
It is very unusual that the results have come out this way. If you do the math, statistically they should get it off on the second box most times.the first box should in theory have a 25% chance of succeeding, and the second have a 62.5% chance of succeeding and the third should have about a 99% chance. The math seems a bit fuzzy, but keep in mind the variable probability like in the famous Monty Hall problem. We aren't measuring the chance of getting a 1/2 after missing the first 2 boxes, we are measuring the chance of guessing the wrong box 3 times consecutively.
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty\_Hall\_problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem)
---
The fact that the results had about 50% getting it off first time has a few possible outcomes. First, recording error, you might not have heard, or recorded every billy laugh. I imagine there is probably some recording error in there, but that is still too high a swing to really be likely to purely be because of that. Second would be just improbable results since it is measuring random results in the first place. Possible, but 500 is a pretty decent sample size to get a swing that far from what we should expect to find. Third, is that the box may not be preset for each survivor but is rather determined upon a survivor trying out a box. As much as I hate to admit it, the third does seem the most likely conclusion here.
---
&gt;reduced BP if not enough bear trap kills
---
So what you're saying is a guaranteed reduced BP event?  
---
Seriously though, getting bear trap kills is rare as hell
---
Nostalgia...
---
That's instaheal on meds. Wait... 
---
always wiggle out, ive had moments were if i started right when i got picked up but because i didnt i got hooked, and you never wanna get hooked in the basement, so always wiggle
---
**Monty Hall problem**
---
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle, loosely based on the American television game show Let's Make a Deal and named after its original host, Monty Hall. The problem was originally posed (and solved) in a letter by Steve Selvin to the American Statistician in 1975 (Selvin 1975a), (Selvin 1975b). It became famous as a question from a reader's letter quoted in Marilyn vos Savant's "Ask Marilyn" column in Parade magazine in 1990 (vos Savant 1990a):
---
Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No.

So do Billy's, and hutress.

You should spare me, cause I really don't wanna hear whatever other crap you're gonna assume about me just because you don't like what I'm saying. That's not how stuff works, dude. Nor is your opinion the be all, end all of DBD. 
---
I really wish this was in the game, I want multiple killers. Please do more of these.
---
I think that's more of a killer complaining because they struggled to gain map/gen control quickly (or at all) versus something to *actually* complain about.
---
Some killers do better (mechanically speaking) by having more time to set up, and may benefit more running an "end-game" build (NOED/Bloodwarden for example) versus just running stuff to eat pallets as they please. Unfortunately everyone can't be pleased and someone will always find something to complain about.
---
I am not saying you are this type of person but when I see killers post this type of stuff I get a picture of a salty killer That tried their best only for the group to get out anyway and then say O I was just being nice.  I am sure there are survivors like that too but I have run into a lot of killers like that. 
---
"*GOD I LOVE WAITING 25 MINUTES FOR A GAME ONLY TO HAVE THE KILLER DC AS SOON AS WE LOAD INTO THE MAP.*" - NO ONE EVER
---
What? Did Claudette really think going to botany classes and shit was free?((Making this joke as I don't exactly know the university pricing in Canada))
---
I've been told that before and I can't quite get the hang of it. I usually just hide and do gens on the opposite side of the map with the idea that the killer is busy with other team mates so I can get as many started or up as possible. But if not I'm damn near sure to get the old 3 hook. I try to rescue too but I'm basically just trading places most of the time hahah
---
I mean you can just go on any post about a successful woman or POC and see for yourself
---
DBD can't be balanced like traditional games. 
---
How do we know NOED is unbalanced? It has a hard counter and some soft counters too. Is it OP or is it just a matter of 'it kills me so I think it's broken?' 
---
And that's without entering the wet and wild world of survivor perks, where you have to consider what happens when the same perk can appear four times.
---
Mori are one of the few things I feel traditionally overpowered in DBD. The only counter to it is "don't get hooked" but the way the game is designed suggests a certain game flow where survivors are getting hooked and unhooked.
---
Good stuff.
---
First off, whether it was intentional or not, your coming off as incredibly rude.
---
Secondly, why wouldn't I provide an example of what I am talking about? 
---
 
---
Unskilled players are just as likely to misdirect their team as they are to make a good call, and the next patch doesn't let survivors see perks until the game ends.
---
Frankly it doesn't matter if Legion is a taste of your own medicine, SWF squads at least have to work for it when they want to piss a killer off, Legion is straight up just "They're gonna move toward you quickly and stab you a lot and there's nothing you can do." Your vengeance fantasy shouldn't matter when it comes down to a basic principle of game design.
---
Unless we will all work together
---
It's rank reset. Most of the people don't even know to run to pallets 
---
I'm sorry, but you really made me laugh out loud, in person, with the head bang comment😂

Guess I finally have a reason to use rancor.
---
so 5 traps... 50 games... still not 500 traps
---
Glad to be of help! Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion are the ones I recommend the most, although my greedy ass swapped out UE for WGLF :P
---
Okay yeah I see the problem. I said 50games I meant 100. Happens to the best
---
I’m trash at survivor but if I do somewhat decent in a chase and I’m playing Bill the killer will often times give up on me early, it almost feels like noob camouflage 
---
Your opinion is... your opinion. I wouldn't say it's "good enough to balance a game around" at all. Don't think you can say your opinion is that good.
---
Joke's on you, never played Deathgarden in my life.
---
If it’s on console and the killer closes the app they get nothing it’s a annoying glitch 
---
I am... Disgusted.
---
I'd like them to do away with hooks, so no camping and tunneling.
---
I'd also like more skill-based gameplay.
---
It failed. Miserably. 
---
I don't fully understand your situation with the accounts on your PS4 but this happens when you change the primary. Im gonna assume that the account you are trying to play on is different than the account that originally purchased the game. The account that originally purchased the game has most likely changed primary to a different PS4 than the one you are using. Even if the primary was changed to another PS4 and then changed back to the one you use, there is usually a delay to some of the licenses from being fully restored. 
---
I used to swap my primary between my 2 ps4's depending on who was playing on what PS4. Ever since they changed the way it works, I now have a designated ps4 that STAYS as my primary and one that STAYS as my son's primary. I don't wanna wait 3 or 4 hours to play a game that hasn't had the license fully restored. 
---
I think a "Dead by Daylight 2" would just be a whole new thing. Whether it's a different type of game set in the same universe or another game of the same type with a new story, who knows, but if you played DbD back on release and then played it today with all the DLC, shit you'd practically be playing a whole new game, there's your DbD 2.
---
Yeah, I know.
---
You know i can extend this list right?
---
&gt; I wish I could tell you how many games I played but this game doesn't even have a stats menu
---
Ok, how many killers achievements? What was your highest rank? Thing is, I can't see any "pro-killer" points in your post, and that's just not... fair? Everyone who plays both sides knows, that there problems on both sides, game is not one-sided.
---
&gt; devs are just trash 
---
No, they're not trash. For example of trash devs search Steam for $0.99 games.
---
Aheoud of separation + dying light on a swf. Watch them dc for nothing, lol

“I can’t respect killers running pink add ons”

-the survivors with instaheals and brand new parts, probably
---
I support the state of the game as it is. Lots of people play it. This is why my idea for game balance is at least proven. Yours is not. That’s why my opinion is good enough to balance around. Also for bonus points, has a Freddy flair and complains that the game is rigged against him.

The background isn't a separate image, the perk is just one image on its own so you'd have to open it in some program or another and then change the color with a HSL slider

---
I HAVE NEVER MET A GOOD WRAITH. WHENEVER I ENCOUNTER A WRAITH, THEY CLOAK CAMP THE HOOK AND RUN NOED TO ENSURE THEY GET 2 KILLS PER GAME. LIKE WOW, SUCH ENTERTAINING GAMEPLAY.
---
The "Ban Survivors" isn't really needed since Survivors are basically skins. But this would actually be really nice.
---
Though Myers can stalk through trees, corn, and sometimes walls so that tends to help me find those hidden clauds pretty well anyway
---
"Getting gens, You?" If no survivors do any progress to gens for 120 seconds they are exposed, their aura is revealed, they get ddos'd, and they get fuken banned for 30 years

How is she compared to Adam with the black suit cosmetic?

I got called shit garbo  as spirit when i got 4k and 32k points. Totally truth tbh, but a 4k is a 4k
---
Bubba too
---
Happy cake day
---
Understandable. Other than that, interesting statistics. You know, there's a saying: you're not a proper Pig main, if survivors in your games has to search more than one box.
---
You’re assuming the second that the RBT is attached that only one of the Jigsaw boxes allows the player to take off the RBT. Perhaps multiple boxes do this or instead the game assigns chances that the trap will come off for every box with the last trap box having a 100% chance (perhaps it’s effected by the luck stat).
---
*cough cough* TydeTyme
---
Well people in groups are more toxic thats just normal huh? I like rank resets so much because suddenly almost no one is toxic, like i played so many games yesterday and every lobby was nice with people saying gg and even having a short chat here and there, except for the one game where three ppl had the same tag in their name, where crazy altrustic and therefore all died on hook only to insult in the post game chat. It‘s just way to noticeable for me that when ppl are toxic they seem to be swf. Mob mentality sucks.
---
Lot of people aren't gonna agree with you since most of them are toxic bitches themselfs. (:
---
She's also shorter
---
*cough* disgusting *cough*
---
Pig traps are broken. Jeff had a safety helmet on and walked right the fuck out the gate as if it wasn't on him. First time I've seen that. I know for a fact it won't go off for a hatch escape. Except for the fact he didn't use the hatch and I sure as shit didn't bring him to the gate either. He ran to it from the middle of the map. Which is the only reason I didn't hit him again because I wanted to see his head pop like a balloon.
---
Oh they don’t see the irony. The guy that said that was the last one and I was proxy camping the hatch because I wanted it and he popped the last gen and I had bitter murmur. He got real fucking mad. 
---
+1 for length &amp; quality

*cough* runs around with ten traps and then calls hag a bad killer *cough*

&gt;NOED
---
hmm
---
"I support the game as it is" ok, so you clearly don't see how Freddy is weak and needs changing, and not only do you assume stuff about me because you don't like my opinion, you gotta go ahead and try to use who I play against me. Despite the fact that I've done neither to you. Got it. 
---
Yeah, your opinion is *totally* what I'd want a game balanced around. /s
---
Ohhhh I didn’t know about that. I thought No Mither just meant you did every action a little bit faster. Interesting
---
Oh darn
---
+1 for the nice comment! :)
---
Sloppy Butcher / Bleeding Wraith add-on separately: fixed.
---
Sloppy Butcher + Bleeding Wraith add-on: still bugged.
---
Should make sense if you read everything though, tbh.
---
What is Jeff doing there? He’s supposed to be in the Legion movies!
---
I know the saying *oinks tears away*
---
Isn’t very reliable when used as a statistical analysis of the whole.
---
Well you certainly put a lot of work into it and your English doesn’t seem that bad so good job!
---
Im a pig main and I hate Claudettes way more, those invisible bastards wreck my nerves
---
That is true.
---
If you would like to be a total asshole, then Territorial Imperative + Make Your Choice + Iron Grip + Agitation, you hook em and walk away and then just wait for someone to enter the basement, start channeling your spirit walk, and then rush to kill once they're unhooked. Mother-Daughter Ring + Dirty Uwabaki is super good for this because you get to the basement entrance in like 5 seconds or less.
---
Let me just clarify that if you do this then you're a massive asshole and should be sacrificed to a cosmic spider for your sins.
---
If the game is completely balance towards killers getting easy 4ks because "realism" the game will die. No one will want to play as survivor.
---
You're new to the game, you cant critizice a game when you don't understand its core mechanics. If you want to get better just play more. Maybe watch how high level killers play.
---
Reasonable enough. I'm at a loss here, because I'm not a Clown main.
---
I know blood tracking is strong but why do you bring such special attention to it? Spirit can't see blood during spirit walk without an Ultra Rare and those aren't exactly in great supply.
---
In fact, before Simple Plan existed, Pierre (the singer) was in a band called Reset which basically was fast skatepunk. The band evolved into a more metal sound when he left (No Intensity is fucking gold).
---
Check them out if you're curious about it.
---
Fair enough. Thank you for the suggestion either way. You appear to be a Freddy main so you have my undying respect in any case. You are braver than I am. 
---
Yes :3
---
Upvoted for awareness, I hope this gets fixed
---
I know that feeling of a leather face, tho 360ing them chainsaws has a 90% chance to work at rank 10.
---
I did that on accident once. I was cleaning my machete (trapper) and she died. I was relying on the BBQ auras to find the last guy, so it was mildly annoying and pretty funny. It's also happened to me once as the last alive against a slugging LFace
---
No actually Resilience makes you do everything faster, but only when injured, and so it's commonly used with No Mither because you're just always injured. The only benefits of No Mither are: Infinite self-pickups, 50% quieter pain sounds, no bleeding, and you are always injured.
---
You play the game, don’t you? You play a game that my opinion would be balanced around. And also, the irony is thick of you assuming the rest of my argument based on not enough information. I was being sarcastic because you favor the weakest character in the game and then moan that it’s rigged. I think Freddy needs a rework, badly. I want him to be more powerful, but he also has to be fun to play against. At the moment he is somehow the weakest killer and still unenjoyable to play against. I would change him. We’re all waiting on the changes to make him fun and viable. 
---
Don't let it bother you, its not worth it. I play both sides. Survivors have limited ways to communicate. Survivors tea bag to say hello to each other, the killer. It's a taunt to get the killer angry and loose focus. You give it power over you by getting upset at it. As for waiting at the gates, its the last bit of points both sides can get. Survivors get a few hundred points for escaping while being chased and killers if they get close can get at least another hit if not a down on an unlucky survivor. 
---
I was seriously yelling " GET OUT! GET OUT! GET OUT!" I was at the edge of my seat.
---
Nice painted nails though dayum.
---
So... they're Meg with inifinite DS?
---
Ez karma duud 
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Yeah, it’s good for him. The biggest problem is that damn near everybody breaks totems against him. 
---
It’s just annoying because it’s like a cycle:
---
Survivors are toxic to killer
---
Killer takes it out on next group of survivors
---
Ect.
---
Meyers, Pig, the Legionaires, Bubba, Trapper, Clown and Huntress are all just normal people for the most part, their abnormalities and "powers" are all just side effects of being in the Entity's realm, for the most part.
---
Thank you for this 
---
It does but it is a detriment since it removes your terror radius and doesn't mask your phase noise
---
So make no mither usable?
---
I ran into this for the first after playing for a few months. I just let him kill me after 20 mins. By that time most of the points are maxed out anyway. Match sucked.
---
I suppose meaningful is a matter of opinion, I respect that. 
---
Consider not wasting people's time

This is the content that I subscribed for

What would your tier be?

S: Nurse, Hillbilly

A: Myers, Huntress, Spirit, Hag, Legion

That would be mine.

bro i feel ya...we have all been there. you just need to grind and make do with what perks you have unlocked. just watch some of the pros on youtube or twitch, they can run survivor or killers with no perks or add ons. anyway good luck in the trial.

You sure do act like your opinion is the truth, don't you?

Did he have Dead Hard?
---
If it’s really that bad I suggest not playing the game for a few days until those killers gets to higher ranks, so you can face killers that actually are low ranks.
---
A great steap to improving your overall skill and survivabillity in DbD would be,changing your attitude.
---
I had to chuckle when you called BBQ and Ruin a crutch perk.
---
Both Ruin and BBQ have mayor counters ingame. Ruin can simply be destroyed and is quite easy to locate unless youre playing on Gideon Meat Plant (f*** that map) Remembering Totem Spawn points is benefical and quite simple
---
For BBQ you can either run into one direction and count from 20 to 24 then switch direction or just hide in a locker shortly before someone gets hooked.
---
Sometimes hiding behind a Generator works aswell.
---
Ditch the term "crutch perk" it wont do anything good to you besides turning you into a toxic player,there is literally not a single perk that i would see as a crutch.
---
NOED is often refered to as a noob perk and while it does indeed inflate Killer ranks it also offers enough counterplay. Pretty simple,destroy all Totems,on each map there are 5 of them. Its not hard to keep track of them either,and you got quite alot of time to destroy them.
---
Besides that an experienced player can do just fine without any Perks
---
Perks do offer various Things like Survivability,Stealthiness, ETC....
---
But in the end nothing beats pure gameplay experience.
---
Perks will only slightly help you at prolonging loops and chases,knowing where Pallets are,how long you can loop certain Killers are much more valuable and helpful
---
What perks would you suggest I go for? I already have Dwights, Claudettes, and Neas teachable perks but I don't really know where to go from there. 
---
Sure. It’s my opinion that you over exaggerate the balance of the game. 
---
I’ll just leave the conversation here, either youre too young or you dont have enough IQ to understand
---
No. That was patched a long time ago.
---
If I see one comment about not taking a screenshot....
---
Lol, I turned off screen recording features for this game to help frame rate. 
---
Wait so what exactly happened?
---
Oh my god. I thought it was just me... this is incredible. 
---
I also worked through it, too, survivor dailies are hard to come by.
---
Its really an Issue that needs to be adressed.
---
As a Killer you can literally Pip without hooking a single person. Its stupid.
---
While as a Survivor you can be as good as you want,if the Killer chases you the whole game and you still manage to escape (without touching a generator) you sometimes dont even get to safe pip.
---
Survivors need more ways to gain points in general.
---
250 Points for "Dodging an Attack" if a Killer misses an attack while being really close to you. Would be something
---
And it's my opinion that you're wrong. See how that works?
---
And when will killers learn that crying on reddit doesnt do shit
---
One of these days I'll unsubscribe from /r/deadbydaylight because of so many qq posts about toxic/teabagging survivors and camping killers
---
When will toxic survivors take their bullshit back to call of duty.
---
I always feel like I have a certain role to play when I play, like depending on my character, so I usually just use the things that help make the character do their job right, like putting lightfoot and urban evasion on nea for, well, evasion, and putting leader and botany knowledge on dwight so I can be support, plus other things to improve my own survivability, like self care or balanced landing. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/9ispkj/leatherface_after_a_match/?st=JR0C3XT5&amp;sh=04c1d626
---
I would argue that it's more survivor-sided, with the exception of a few outliers like nurse and ebony moris. But that's only really the case at the higher ranks, which I doubt that OP has reached yet. 
---
For newer players the game does almost seem killer-sided, but once players get more experience and have to play at a higher skill level killer is always more stressful than survivor and requires a lot more strategy imo. 
---
I do agree that the game will never be completely balanced, otherwise it would take enjoyment out of most of the playstyles that people like to use. Granted I would love to see a lot more perks receive balance adjustments, a lot of perks are just never going to be viable outside of kyf or troll builds (example: no mither sees some use for the sabo build, but that is pretty much it).
---
Thank you, papa pigsaw?
---
Deliverance, Self Care, Urban Evasion, Sprint Burst.
---
If they beat you then they are good enough 8-)
---
I put a trap on his head across the map from the exit on Lery's. I found him when his timer was almost over because he couldn't find his box. The gate was open. I stood back at the waiting chairs and watched him pass all the way through the gate and the pop zone past the pillars. He stood right on the edge of the escape threshold t bagging me. So I walked to the door. He threw his firecracker and left. His head should have popped once he reached the pillars in the gate hall.
---
So I should start leveling up Adam and Meg?
---
The killers are just tools. 
---
Okay! 
---
Your attitude towards the game makes it take years off your own life.
---
&gt; I play so fun and the most respectful way and there’s people who really suck @ giving a shit for others.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; When I play killer I don’t receive ANY hateful messages. 
---
Notice your own bias here. 
---
You're saying this about people not being empathetic, and then you post this, a completely apathetic statement:
---
&gt; y’all have it sooo easy and that’s that on THAT 
---
You've specified you're a survivor main, and this post is mainly bashing killers.
---
So you must be fed up with the sounds being bugged, so when you try to listen for a survivor you lose them? 
---
Or when a frame drop happens and you lose a survivor, especially in cornfields? 
---
Maybe even you hate how some killers have become nonviable because when you use their power the ps4 cant actually process you using that power, so you get frame drops and lose the survivor.
---
You've got to hate when a survivor abuses an infinite and you're stuck running around and around until they finally trigger the entity blockers, and at that point multiple gens pop.
---
And you've especially got to despise when a survivor breaks any totem perk 15-30 seconds into a match.
---
Both sides of the game have issues, especially on ps4, don't deny your opponent's weaknesses when pointing out their behavior.
---
All the killer has to do is be on the map and they get called a camper.

---
Okay, so exactly what I said but with “body block” instead of “auto aim”? 
---
Yeah, I realized after that I messed up in my thinking. Rather embarrassing really. Core point does remain that the math doesn't add up for the boxes being set at the start of the match if the stats taken are reliable.
---
I'm doing a basement build piggy with ruin right now. Yay for meme builds.
---
Unlucky i guess
---
Looks like they were trying to give you the hatch
---
Just from a quick read i think ur math is rather off. The chance of finding the key literally should not decrease due to several factors. Your calculations are simply posed not as a probability but as a mere percentage— its not a 47% (or whatever number you said) chance of escaping its 47% of your sample size escaped on the first escape attempt. Contrastingly within the limits of the game (given the number of the chest thingos you can search for the key to escape the RBT on any given map) while less people may have recorded escapes as their attempt number increases this is because after each escape attempt their next attempt has much greater odds of success due to 1. The initial probability of whether they find the key in a chest (in otherwords if we had only one chest their % chance of success/failure) and then 2. The number of chests remaining. Your maths and reasoning suggest that their chance of escaping decreases with each attempt, but rather by making consecutive attempts the likelihood of success increases and thus they do not continue searching, hench the % lowering. With each chest search that does not yield the key to escape the RBT, there is one less chest which does not contain it and thus 
---
(no. Of chests containing a key to escape)/(no. Chests remaining) is the effective probability of success. 
---
Since the denominator consistently decreases until the overall fraction = 1 (as a respective key to an RBT is always generated when the RBT is placed), provided a survivor has time to check each billy-box technically RBT’s are useless when purely considering their kill potential, as if given the time (as you did in your studies) to search each billy box, the survivor will undoubtedly find the key.
---
Lets not even get into how you included outliers (DC’s/ragequits) in your sample size
---
So in short your misguided math (which again, isn’t a true account of probability) yields some truth. The Pig’s power is kinda crap when considering the numbers behind it. Based on sheer luck and probability many survivors escape quickly, and those that dont will still be capable of escaping nevertheless if left to their own devices (without considering timer duration— as when a generator is completed in regards to number of billy boxes left to search, and in turn the time needed to travel to and perform the search dictates their success regardless of if they go to the correct billy box immediately or last.)
---
HOWEVER. You’ve ignored a lot of stuff. For each dumb survivor that doesn’t know about the exit gates triggering the RBT, you get a free kill. For every survivor who IS aware of this trait you’ve slowed down the game by ensuring they must go running around chasing billy-boxes before they can even look for an exit gate, which will often= a free kill. (Thus regardless of rank it’s still highly impactful in the endgame)
---
Furthermore even without this exit-gate shenanigan each RBT placed slows down the game by forcing a player to abandon completing generators until they find their key (considering that’s the logical thought process + the fact that a generator completion triggers the timer to begin)
---
Additionally each failed billy-box attempt (which again, realistically, you could in cases not even have) coupled with potentially failed skilchecks (although that’s more dependent on the rank of the survivor) provides the pig with the sound notification that it has occured, allowing her to 1. Keep tabs on survivors and 2. Go after them more easily. You left survivors to search each billy box without repercussion when in a realistic environment the pig/killer-player A. Would not allow that and B. Follow up with a hook either after RBT placement or losing and finding the survivor once again. 
---
It may not sound like a lot but endgame power and/or an ability to slow the game down have shown (as far as I understand)  to be highly coveted. If they weren’t, perks like NOED and Ruin wouldn’t basically be must-have runes on any killer who can obtain them (whether through the blood web or shrine of secrets, respectively) in order to provide power as the exit gates are powered (NOED) or to prevent them from being powered (Ruin) at all. You can crack jokes that these aren’t must-haves but the former (and to a lesser extent the latter) wouldnt be massive memes without some logical and relatable basis acknowledged behind them.
---
You’re too focussed on the RBT’s killing capacity/escapabilty and have controlled your variables poorly which (due to the provisional nature of information provided by this experiment) has provided you with a perspective that has blinded you to other attributes not only of the RBT’s themselves but to the mindset of a realistic killer, to the mindset of a survivor(s) and the state of the game in entire (regarding perks)
---
No this isn’t me saying you’re dumb or bad at math/scientific methods it is just an elaboration on the information you have overlooked intentionally or not to create your argument. But I’m a dumbass and what would I know. Take my two cents with a grain of salt.
---
I had a killer and a survivor not understand that in the same match. The killer put a trap on me after the double pillars and I crawled out then a survivor saw me leave and tried to run out and triggered the trap. It was the biggest shitshow I ever saw
---
I agree with giving the win to Myers if you dont count The Nurse or The Spirit. The whole fear thing is only really explored in Freddy Vs Jason. Thank you for your input!
---
&gt;The killers lobby dodging because they’re so afraid of SWF. Game takes enough time to get in as a survivor.. we shouldn’t be punished to wait more. 
---
It's not about being afraid.. it's about not wanting to deal with the IMBA bullshit of SWFs. When I play survivors I hate being matched with them and when I play killers I will dodge them. You wanna complain about your poor wait time, well playing against a SWF is fucking not fun in the slightest.. what?  I'm suppose to be miserable and not enjoy myself so you and your 3 friends can sit on discord calling out where I am, where I'm headed, where my totems are and when it's safe to unhook.. and if i'm lucky deal with you toxic shit talking at the end of the game?
---
I ran some stat tests and it turns out the distribution isn't 1:1:1:1 nor does it seem to be 4:2:1:1 as you claimed but rather it seems to be 8:4:2:1.
---
If we look at the people who got it off (ignore deaths and DCs) we get the following from a chi square test:
---
p-value assuming the distribution is 1:1:1:1 was &lt;.00001, less than a .001% chance. 
---
p-value assuming the distribution is 4:2:1:1 was .0276, a 2.76% chance
---
p-value assuming the distribution is 8:4:2:1 was .2716, a 27.16% chance.
---
Given those results the last model seems the most likely, but the second one is possible. What this means is that you most likely have an 8/15 chance the key is in the first box, 4/15 on the second, 2/15 it's in the third, and a 1/15 chance it's the last one. I spent more time on this than i should have but it was really interesting. If it turns out I am right then I hope they fix this ASAP.
---
+ Open Handed.
---
On a serious note, i like to run OoO, No Mither, Dead Hard &amp; Diversion.
---
You wouldn't get banned even if they did have bans on console
---
Couldn’t agree more. Did some stat tests on it and posted my results above to Flint124. Most likely model seems to be 8:4:2:1 odds. 
---
Thanks guys, but Why is reporting a thing if it doesn't do anything? 
---
Seems fair. 
---
I found porn of states fucking other states. Humanoid isn't even the first form
---
For me, "true gen rush" is a game style that was shown by Marth88 and his "de-pip squad" - almost no altruism, maximum gen repairing efficiency (everyone works alone, no time wasted to find ruin totem), zero fucks given about blood points and/or pipping. 
---
I don't think I've ever played vs such team. When I get "gen rushed", it's usually because I wasn't good enough to catch first (sometimes, second) survivor.
---
That's my build, minus the pebble. It's so easy to lose the killer in chase, especially in jungle gyms and the killer shack. I'm loving this build so much!
---
Eeeh, survivors need to do the gens to escape and killers get mad when they are done too fast. I even get annoyed, especially if there is a Dwight and a toolbox. But I will always kill the Dwight first so things don't go as fast. 
---
Howweeever, when I'm playing survivor I love Dwight and I want him by my side forever💖
---
Some people want the gen times to be longer or blah blah blah. Not all games are the same. People like to complain, you get used to it.
---
Good for what? What's you goal?
---
I play for gen grabs (they're fun), but don't mind ranking up, so Enduring, BBQ, Whispers and Monitor&amp;Abuse with Combat Straps is good build for me.
---
Its use is apparent until post unhooked. This is where Lightweight and sliding burst work well together to make sure you can find a safe place without getting tracked and tunnelled. 
---
Excuse me, it's ma'am! It is ma'am!
---
I mean... yeah. Myers can't kill Freddy either in the dream world, so... gg? Two winners, *if* Freddy can't kill Myers?
---
Yeah exactly... 
---
I just did this exact same thing. It beeped but they walked right out and I got a big ol salt mine afterwards.
---
&gt;what?  I'm suppose to be miserable and not enjoy myself so you and your 3 friends can sit on discord calling out where I am, where I'm headed, where my totems are and when it's safe to unhook.. and if i'm lucky deal with you toxic shit talking at the end of the game?
---
This. SWF doesn't like being inconvenienced, but don't seem to care one bit about how they're so unfun to play against. They don't care, because it's not *them* having a rough time.
---
It's not what he said but honestly at least half the killer still play very sweaty a 3v1 with no gens done and that's honestly pathetic and bad manner. Still "patrol", come back and immediatly down the guy that was already hooked, slug, etc ... Honestly man I don't care that you win your 3v1 but at least let people play a bit.
---
Dedicated servers are coming summer 2019, actually.
---
I'm pretty much you then, lol.
---
I started playing mid oktober, hit rank 1 within 3 weeks as well.
---
After that I haven't tried to rank up, but I play so much that I still end up rank 1 every reset. This might change soon as I'm getting sick and tired of 15 min queue times every time I want to SWF, even if it's with one other person the queue times are just out of proportion. We've even managed to get into games faster and more reliably by queueing up simultaneously as solo.
---
Took me a while longer to hit rank 1 killer though, but that's mostly because I prefer survivor and only play killer to farm blood points faster. Neither are hard to achieve but I'd place killer slightly above survivor in regards to difficulty.
---
I have a friend who runs an end-game pig build (noed/blood warden/remember me) and it works out really well for them
---
Tbh you shouldnt read the dbd sub if you're just starting out (especially the older posts). People here often talk out of their ass and ooze with negativity.
---
The survivors' objective is to get generators done. They could also spend time going through chests, cleansing totems, being altruistic, healing, etc. etc. Gen *rushing* is attempting to get all five gens done as fast as possible, which is a strategy. I just find it funny how people fuss about NOED, despite literally having enough time to get all five totems cleansed between four people before they get all five gens done. They literally genrush themselves out of time to cleanse all five totems and then don't like it when the killer brings a perk that punishes them for it.
---
i doubt those people even go to parties
---
Perfect use of game development time 
---
Imagine using noed and not getting a single kill
---
We all want that honestly it should have been like this in the beginning. It would make ppl buy more skins 
---
Lmao did she have a terror radius she just appeared randomly. 
---
Lol yeah i see that too XD
---
Go for it, BM gets BM but the one who BMs first is worse.

Corn maps are garbage, change my mind.

Get rekt

My answer to these players, is Legion. 
---
In current build repairing 2 gens by 2 solo survivors is faster than repairing them in duo (https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators#Statistics). So if you really want to rush gens, split up.
---
LF dlc is the cheapest one when it's on sale. 
---
it's the best realm for survivor by a long stretch, i would cum my pants if i got it that many times
---
Even if the exit gates are open?
---
By the time you find them, set the traps and start looking for survivors, they’ve done a gen, popped your traps, cleansed your ruin etc. and if you just go for survivors at the start you’ll have no traps down. He also suffers from people just breaking his traps, and is probably one of the killers most crippled by swf other than maybe hag and Michael. Love trapper but distinctly in the lower middle of all the killers
---
Would require way to much work on their end, to remake all clothes with blood. 
---
yes enjoy your van noob
---
TEABAGGING AT PALLETS IS PUNISHABLE BY TUNNELING
---
I don’t really care about teabagging, if you do it near me I will down and hook you so idc. I was just talking about the “bm gets met with bm” mindset. Also you can bet your ass that if the gates are open then the other survivors are either waiting there for you for some retarded reason, or as soon as you turn away from the hook they get borrowed time rescued. So it’s not worth leaving at that point in the game.
---
Dope. Are you some kind of developer or just self-taught? 😀
---
I meant smartest out of the possible contenders for the winner. And that lethal electricity takes time to charge up. I don’t think he will ever get the chance to use it
---
It’s a good perk sure. Good thing you stopped running SB, one of the wordt exhaustion perks in the game rn
---
Then why, in all that is holy.... WOULD THEY EVER NERF THEM TO MAKE THEM MORE BORING TO PLAY?
---
You don’t understand that this isn’t a horror game, it’s an action game with horror elements. If you truly believe that it should be exactly like a horror movie, then the killer should always get killed by a survivor at the end of the game or escape (oh look the escape hatch).
---
You have no idea what you’re talking about, so stop giving your god-awful shitty “balance” suggestions. You must have less than 20hrs if you think the things you do, go and learn the game and get good before giving your trash ideas on this subreddit
---
Something so satisfying about watching leatherfaces getting owned
---
Thanks, I think I get it now. So, those perks have switched places and now Prove Thyself is good while Leader is a dogshit?
---
It's supposed to have always been like that, it just wasn't working properly.
---
“YOU HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS HOW TO BALANCE A VIDEO GAME THAN ME? YOU’RE BORING AT PARTIES!”
---
It’s happening to my clown and spirit with the frosty eyes every time I select them the next day they have reset. 
---
But a gen grab with Pig is awesome, a gen grab with Spirit is pretty much just expected, or Prayer Beads cheese.
---
And for 3 years they recalled it now whe survivors is on the ground
---
I'm yet to play Spirit more or less seriously, so can't comment on that. But there are other fun things about Pig's gameplay, so... No, you're right, I need to finally give Spirit a try.
---
The best anti looper on the game, and he leaves lol 
---
Boo hoo.
---
I would be deep throating those nipples. 
---
Gen rush lol alright next time the killer is chasing someone ill wait til he hooks them to start doing gens. Dont want to gen rush anybody...lol but please dont hook rush me either. 
---
trapper wins cuz he's an absolute unit
---
tunnelling is effective
---
I find it pretty even these days, other then coms. 
---
So satisfying when a legion DCs
---
ruin is a crutch at low ranks
---
The g word?

---
You mean, against like 1-2% of teams?
---
&gt; BBQ&amp;Chilli is good to jumpscare people
---
How do you do that? I can't think of any way how BBQ could be a main reason for jump scare.
---
«Just cleanse totems» yeah ok, «just juggle then» «just slug then»
---
I dont expect Nurses and Billies running NOED, so i dont cleanse totems as it wastes my time
---
You know what sucks about SWFs? Waiting 20+ mins for a lobby and then having the killer quit right away because they’re too chicken shit and throw a tantrum and dodge the lobby. I’ve been plenty of SWF games with a friend of mine where we get creamed immediately, it’s really not that difficult playing against them if you’re a decent killer. 
---
I think they could do it, would just take a long time. Maybe something to aim for after dedicated servers.
---
Definition of a fun ruiner right here ^^
---
Don't get why this is not a thing yet. I guess 
---
 that the devs want to encourage stupid survivors to keep doing what they do best 😥
---
ruin can slow down the game and make survivors waste time searching for it. If I'm facing ruin I just try to hit great skill checks and focus on gens. I played a game yesterday where we made all gens without destroying ruin. It can slow down the game though if youre unexperienced
---
Yeah, it's only really there as a mirror to banning killers. The only real reason is if you want to ban Claudette because of her invisibility lol. Also if you'd like to make all the survivors Dwight for your own entertainment.
---
Sounds like a problem with how you are playing, not with the perk.
---
Yes a toolbox is definently the same power as an ebony mori....Btw if their using an ebony mori good add ons usually follow.
---
Thanks! Will do!
---
definition of a killer trying to do the objective as efficiently as possible here
---
Self taught
---
So far 3/4 times of running Haunted grounds and Devour/Ruin, the important totem always gets cleansed first, and the remaining ones are ignored.
---
overall they are the best camo outfit because of the dark colors.Though it makes you pop out a lot more on some bright maps like the hospital halls
---
that looks nothing like nea and i can't tell if it's male or female 
---
Dude, I honestly meant to put banned perks there instead. Banned survivors was a placeholder I forgot to change cx just pretend it says banned perks. Only reason to really ban survivors is if you don't want invisible Claudettes.
---
Big brain killer mains btw
---
because the survivors are so bad that you don't even need to run it, and if you do then you're relying on something that you really don't need
---
It has a lot of issues atm. If the killer is not the host, decisive Strike and other things do not work.
---
I can only imagine cx
---
I also realized that I accidentally put SWF instead of KYF in my comment too oops
---
That's just because I found it funny to put Jim's face on Michael. In reality I was playing clown :D
---
No. You've clearly didn't meet good survivors as legion. If they know how to loop legion, legion just can't do a thing about them because his powers just go out too fast.
---
Youre a killer main i can tell and you probably run NOED on every killer you play, how many times does your NOED prop? every fucking game.. one survivor cant cleanse all the 5 totems.
---
I'm such a noob if I look back I eventually hit a wall blocking me and I get downed.
---
Haha np. Banned perks is definitely an option that should have been on there, can't believe I forgot. Me and my friends love to ban decisive Strike, Mori perks (except DH) and ruin when there's less than 3 survivors.

Have you not seen the virgin moonwalk legion Vs Chad chaser legion meme? Iconic meme 
---
Literally nobody agrees with that but
---
Because tunnelling is a made up rule by the community, the killer/survivors can play how ever they wish. 
---
The perk “distressing” increases your terror radius by 26% must have on doctor. 
---
No wonder. But isn’t all outfits easy to spot in hospital map?

Imagining ten generations alive at the same time *is* a terrifying concept.

No, I just chose to focus my reply on the last sentence.

Feelsrank15 man.
---
Probably because you know I am right. 
---
Or WERE normal people.
---
Spirit. Freddy. Myers? Wraith? Doctor? Nurse?
---
They all were normal, but have changed.
---
(Myers was a normal kid until he killed his sister. Nurse floats. Doctor is insane. Wraith is invisible. Spirit can phase. Freddy is a literal dream.
---
This should be the intro of the game instead 
---
Entity demands more David there 
---
No, I completely share the same view, but it’s still bm for survivors. So many killers are too scared to find another survivor when it’s completely possible.
---
I love devour hope as hag so much
---
ah, yes. the infamous gDecisive Strike.

This doesn’t have anything to do with DBD.

Did they teabag you?

Does it not activate if you are in a chase? That could be the case but I never play pig so I don't really know.
---
Can the reduced and increased BP thing only happen for people who own the SAW dlc? It would suck if you didn’t own it and they lost.. 
---
Baby killers outta control
---
They’re two different memes
---
And what are we waiting here? Lets go
---
The killer and survivor bots would be very hard to implement but other things such as survivor and killer count,hooks until death,generators,exit gates etc would be a nice thing to have.
---
Insert you have no power here meme
---
I'm rank 1 both killer and survivor.
---
I simply find it hard to believe that if you are a killer main and play legion that you aren't getting many easy 4ks with Frank's Mixtape.
---
I main Doctor, MM, LF and only played legion during the double BP event.
---
Meaning that I was already rank 1 and had to learn how to play him at rank 1.
---
Playing legion at rank 1 is like playing any killer at rank 15 when you are a rank 1 player. You can mess around and still get a 4k\3k with one hatch escape. Generally feel bad for the players I'm killing when playing legion, because it's so incredibly easy.
---
Also, how fun is it for a survivor to get hit twice, legion waits for his ability to charge up 20% then hits you again and downs you? Pallets don't work, vaults don't work. 
---
Unless the Legion is incredibly bad or misplays, you will not be able to be in chase for long before he catches you.
---
The fun in this game boils down to the chases(Not killing, not escaping, like many would believe), and legion simply removes that.
---
Oh definitely. My idea of bots were just something as a filler for games. Nothing special it could just repair generators.
---
Just useful when you want to go in KYF to test something but don't have anyone to join (need 2 players to start atm) or when you only have 3 survivors and just want to add a basic bot to fill in a place.
---
Sure
---
Tututu tutututu tututu tutututu tututu tututu tututu tutu
---
Probably because its basically impossible to do "right". If a well coordinated team does a 3 man hook dive and body blocks like a motherfucker they could get punished for an "unsafe hook" despite saving their team-mate from a face camper. Or you have things like starting to unhook as wraith/ghost/hag zoom in from nowhere costing you bp even if the unhook started safe.   
---
  
---
When I play survivor and get coldwind, I just get really bored, as its pretty much a guaranteed win for me. Whenever I play killer, I get really frustrated by the ludicrous amount of pallets and infinites. I hate each coldwind map more than the game, because at least there's SOME fun to be had on that map.
---
Did you slash up your camera too?

*laughs in 4man DS*

Whoa.  You just assumed a lot while being really angry.  Lol.  Who said nerf?  I said change.

Of course

I allways use whispers, cause this has happen to me alot. Made it so much easier

I’m not angry and your changes are nerfs you idiot

rescues someone from the hook from up to 16 metres and heals them instantly

I find it to really good.
---
Thx. I upload all of my poster on my reddit.

Hmmm ok. I mainly play it with the wraith. I only got noed for ghosty and fredsons...
---
“Of course you cannot defeat me. Your hate isn’t strong enough”
---
It s a good perks for lower ranks.. red ranks I prefer iron will 
---
Damn I thought I was a survivor main but who wants to survive with ypu?
---
CAN'T UPVOTE THIS MORE THAN ONCE, REDDIT PLZ FIX
---
Myers gets a high placement because he can take a beating but Hag is literally half eaten and gets mid? Hagphobia never sleeps I see...
---
Those are good points, especially if you are just talking about tunneling the first person only and then cycling the hooks for the remaining 3 survivors.  How many remaining generators there are at different points in the match can make decisions different, and if at least 2 generators get done before you've killed anyone it could definitely be the most effective to get someone dead asap.  At that point it could slip beyond control if all 4 were still up and some chase goes very awry. Also if you're running ruin and if it is still up or not can effect how frequently you need to be checking gens, and how much time you can spare getting someone dead without giving up gens. 
---
Personally I love having 12 hook matches as killer where and nobody was hooked twice in a row, even better when it's pulled off with only 0 to 1 gens getting completed.  Obviously it's not going to happen every time by any means, but playing that aggressive style to keep all the survivors busy as much as possible with anything but generators does allow for that to happen much more frequently than maybe any other strategy.  It is riskier though so I can understand wanting to have more of a safety net/assured lethality.  I'm also content if not everyone dies though as long as I played in a way to maximize my bloodpoint gain, which has some overlap with killing everyone but isn't the only thing important. 
---
Hey I have posted there before, lots of good huntress and nea stuffs 😎

M&amp;A Bamboozle BBQ and Chili and Ruin

That was cinematic as fuck
---
And most the time you’re in these just hoping the hatch opens up, there’s two people just standing at the exit gates so they can tea bag the killer. PSA: Leave because the final person might desperately need the hatch!!!
---
I guess but most killers are 1 trick ponies. Good example would be Huntress. Can’t use hatchets for anything else than getting a hit.
---
Yeah lemme just run in a straight line next time. That'll work out great!
---
either Huntress or Myers win. Spirit technically cant lose because shes already dead
---
I TRIED TO HELP MY FRIEND AFTER DOING 4 GENES ALONE BY MYSELF WHEN THE OTHER SURVIVORS WERE SANDBAG'ING EACHOTHER AFTER I OPENED THE DOOR I WENT TO HELP HIM AND THE KILLER HAD NO ED SO NO ONE ESCAPED AND I DIDN'T EVEN RANK BECAUSE I DIDNT UNHOOK ANYONE EVEN THOUGH I WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID ANYTHING REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I'm a spirit main and I always get 4ks with hex: devour hope, hex: thrill of the hunt, BBQ and chili, and pop goes the weasel. Here's how a normal game should go. You kill the first person fairly quick with your phasing power, you place them on the hook and you see people on a gen. You have pop goes the weasel so you go over to the gen and kick it, it loses almost all of its progress. The person gets unhooked and you get a token. You phase over to the hook and you do it all over until you reach 3 tokens where they are exposed, and 5 tokens when you can mori. If anyone tries to touch your totem, Thrill of the hunt goes off and it'll give you a notification and makes the cleansing process slower. You will phase over there and you could pull them off and hook them.
---
Pretty much what i said for DS and NOED. Remove them while you rework them because leaving something that broken is unhealthy for the game, which is why I don’t think Freddy should get the same treatment. He’s not overpowered so it makes no difference if he’s in the game or not.

Even without chase perks, I would just do your best to bait pallet drops and destroy them ASAP. Also hope for a map like the game or even just survivors that make a lot of mistakes. Once you destroy more pallets, there is less they can do against your uncloak speed boost. Getting rid of the shack pallet is pretty important as well. Don’t be too afraid to get pallet stunned, sometimes is best just to eat it rather than play around it for 3 minutes.

---
When will we all just get along? Am I right?... Guys?
---
You gotta use their Teachables, otherwise there's nothing to really look at. Teachables are intrinsic to a Killer's WWW stats. Without them, we're just looking at weapon choice.
---
That being said, Billy wins. He's durable, and that's all he'd need. If he gets one hit in, he can keep the pressure on and push in for a win. If he gets hit, he can just shrug it off with Enduring.
---
Darn that was wholesome 
---
Putting a blood overlay on a texture doesn't seem that difficult to me. And besides, it's a game studio. If they're not working on the game, what are they supposed to do?

Same here :-D

I'M SORRY THAT HAPPENS. AS A NURSE MAIN WHEN I PLAY KILLER SOMETIMES I BLINK BACK AND ALL I SEE IS THE INJURED SURVIVOR. IM NOT JUST GOING TO LET YOU GO IF I HAVE NO OTHER TARGET. SORRY BUDDY

---
THE BUG LITERALLY CRASHES GAMES ONE IN EVERY 5 MATCHES OR SO AS WRAITH I CRASH PEOPLES GAMES WITH SLOPPY BUTCHER SERIOUSLY THAT SHIT NEEDS TO BE FIXED.
---
Literally top post on the sub, repost lol
---
It’s because he takes away everything a survivor can do. You can’t really stealth against him, you can’t escape him. He has strong map pressure....
---
The only weakness is the unreliable downs, but even that’s a non issue if you got addons or abuse the LOS so that you don’t count as in chase so people have to mend while you are still close to them.
---
I know how to play him, doesn’t mean he isn’t one of the weakest killers in the game. You can also 4K with Freddy, does that mean he is underrated? 
---
We have seen though that based on his Lores he can make stronger tonics then just afterpeice, primarily he seems fully capable of making tonics that can knock out a person. You generally are not considering add ons to factor in here but the Clowns tend to be normal items, somewhat. Even the strongest killer would probably be effected by a huge dose of knockout gas, combined with Hydrochloric acid,Bleach and Chloroform even the most steadfast killer may have issue if their lungs and skin are burning up.
---
In this same regard i think your disregarding the Doctor rather quietly, you cite the killers are out of the trial, so im running under the assumption that their powers work how they do in the lore, and not the actual gameplay. Therefore Doctor is not just making people scream, he is a master of torture,interrogation and Breaking the mind through electrical shock Therapy, Electrical powers he now has grafted into his own body. He doesn't need to be physically stronger then the other killers, not when he can target their mind and snap it with his own powers leaving them in such a stupor of fear,madness,paranoia or whatever else he needs to them simply kill them. This is especially true for two of your contenders, The Nurse and the Spirit (somewhat, she is dead though so technical DNF already?) are both in all likelihood psychologically sensitive considering both of them just snapped, because of this their minds may be even easier to Break, to target with his madness and to leave them mentally broken.
---
So my Vote is on Doctor and Freddy as major contenders, The Doctor because he is the only killer with the power and knowledge of how to mentally break someone ever physically, and Freddy because his status as a Dream Demon may make him somewhat protected from the Doctors effects, provided Freddy is not drawn into the real world and exposed to the Doctor's Spark.
---
Idk thats up you im just saying its just a post name. what are you arguing exactly lol
---
Exactly? That was the point 
---
Should we do the same for killers? :)
---
noed, ruin, camping, tunneling
---
there you go, you can pick your 4 icons as you like
---
Yet red and purple ranks still run ruin.
---
They definitely synergize with each other, if that’s what you’re asking. But there are certain killers that combo works better on, and some you shouldn’t do at all ie: It’s really good on doctor, probably best on him, but won’t be that useful on say, pig or Michael. 
---
HEIL 2 YOU
---
But... Isnt that the point of the game to begin with? Running around one broken double window doesnt make the gameplay fun. Hiding from the killer gets you pumped up and shit and actually makes you semi scared. Just running around a pallet for 10 minutes has no point.
---
I have no idea how to take a screenshot on xbox one. I've accidentally done maybe 3 times.
---
This is a console only thing. I hope you never have to deal with a god tier nurse crushing your team before a single gen is done. It leaves scars... on the inside. 
---
Is that from PTB? I can't find this cosmetic in store.
---
Pretty much every killer is underrated. With practice and time any killer is unstoppable.
---
No, I gave a hyperbole. The example was there to express how absurd it is. Most of the time I get negative responses, to a very calm subject. Or I see people who say crappy things for no reason. 
---
50/50
---
Freddy IS underrated. Yes, he’s the weakest killer in the game but the memes that perpetuate that he is complete and utter useless trash seem to resonate with most people that haven’t even given him a proper go. I was a Freddy main when I started in December 2017 and had a lot of success as him. I shifted away to explore other killers but Freddy is not nearly as useless as the community makes him out to be. If there’s one thing I can agree on however, it’s that he’s trash at defending totems and the end game in general unless you have a full on end game build. Even then it’s not guaranteed and you’re better just taking perks that help throughout the whole match. 
---
Well answered. Thanks. 
---
First of all: It was an intended mechanic that wasn't working, so they fixed it.
---
Second: Just have everyone work on different generators. It's really not that hard.
---
Okay, but Pig would be viable as long as she had someone to get a down first. A combo of Pig and Billy- unstoppable. Billy takes the blows and downs people with Enduring and chainsaw, Pig sneaks over and deals the finishing blow with her RBT. it's a one hit KO since no killers can search Boxes. 
---
What?! Survivor will stand by the exit so the killer can get a last hit or down....and the survivor gets accused of being toxic.
---
When I have a bad killer, or new killer, I'll stand at the gate so they can get a "teleport and hit" with the Nurse or something...Just in case they are doing a daily.
---
Like someone someone else said, don't generalize like a bitch.

It’s actually pretty good on the Pig. You are bound to fail at least one skillcheck

I get that. I’ve honestly not played pig much, I don’t even own her, just played through splinters. My point was really that combo works better on bigger terror radius killers, and pigs crouch came to mind before anything else. 
---
Just no
---
There's no cross-platform synchronization. You have to start from scratch.
---
It’s not used correctly though, because you can’t have 2 offerings per person, so it makes no sense like this
---
no love for the hag
---
I like how the shrine of secrets was introduced specifically so that you could get all the perks without a pay wall.... But then exclude things like bbq and chilli
---
Worse killer is definitely Freddy.... LF has an instadown and pallet breaker meanwhile Freddy has literally nothing. Freddy is only viable against really bad survivors.
---
They probably would have got the gens done even with ruin if he wasted time face camping. Ruin isn’t that hard and usually isn’t that hidden. If you waste time camping then call gen rush that’s on no one but yourself.

Feel free to send a Friend Request and we'll wait in a lobby for the next millennia, lol.  
---
If not, Good Luck out there in the Fog.
---
50 percent action speed reduction, and perfect tracking. Add monitor and they can't get away.
---
People don't use him correctly typically. Freddy needs multiple sleeped..
---
You shouldn't be committing to many chases as Freddy if people are nearby. Especially with class photo.
---
Leatherface has nothing if you're near a pallet or window. 
---
You'll find the higher you go in ranks the less effective that strategy will be. It also handicaps you in the early game since the normal method is to be standing then when you get within range of a gen you crouch to sneak up and it doesn't work if you are just out of range or go to crouch to try and stealth again. It's more detriment than help so go for perks that either help with tracking or locating. Additional perks you can play with are BBQ, Bitter Murmur, Sloppy Butcher, Discordance, Rancor, Nurse's, Deerstalker (if you tend to slug), Iron Maiden, and Tinkerer
---
I didn't realize it when I made it yesterday but yeah it's horrible.
---
True, but it was so sad... Alexa play despacito:)
---
I'd buy that!
---
This has been discussed a million times, no one can fuckin agree. Let's not make it a million and one. 
---
Not really, they’re both basically immortal (going off the old Halloween movies,) but we’ve seen that Jason can be killed so Myers probably would have a better chance
---
Ahahaha yaaaaaas! 
---
Sloppy Butcher is the reliable form of Ruin. If you hit people enough to say get off atleast 10 heals a match that is equal to an entire Generator worth of time.  
---
And even then Ruin stays the superior perk since every skill check in the match that ends up being good is worth 8 seconds of regression. So with Ruin in the match you get 14sec cleansing time+8seconds per skillcheck. This outvalues Weasel easily. The only time you would consider Weasel over it would be to use it with the ultra rare that shows you the gen progression.
---
Costs more to add something onto a contract, plus the company that gives BHVR the license can charge anything for it really.
---
I know right? This meme is fucking great! 
---
I won't blame them for doing it, i just don't understand it, even as a killer myself. To me it's boring and feels like a petty thing to do (also you gain few bloodpoints from 1 kill you have to commit to) so unless you care for rank i don't see why one does it.
---
Push through until you get downed because of it. One time I was crouching behind a rock waiting for the save then next thing I know I’m crouched in the open with Myers coming at me and downed me. DC on that one for sure. I don’t even mess with any non green internets anymore honestly. 
---
He’s reposting scum
---
Yes...Yes...And...Fuck Yes! 
---
THE GATES ARE OPEN. LEAVE. I SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO START A LOAD OF LAUNDRY, CLEAN MY BATHROOM, AND COME BACK TO SEE THAT YOU HAVEN'T LEFT YET. 
---
I've chased noobies that had no idea the traps kill them at the gate out of the gate with it on their head and it always pops their heads at the pillars that are a few feet past the gate door. 
---
However made this is awesome!

👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
---
Still waiting on this cosmetic too, tbh...
---
You my friend are awesome! Thanks for the laugh 
---
How someone can have fun with a killer that require no skill!? Lmao legion mains 
---
"lol"
---
Heals those with no mither
---
Well I mean, the one time I tried out the black box this happened.
---
1. The survivor spawned across the entire map.
---
2. The survivor was moving before the camera finished even panning....
---
3. The survivor spawned next to a team mate and was waking up before I could even move.
---
4. Obviously I was pissed off. Ultra rare? Seriously some bullshit if I've ever seen any before.
---
The map isn't garbage or bad, it just gets annoying and boring being stuck on the same map all of the time.
---
It looks like a damn nice perk indeed. Just having a hard time to switch something out from my DH-SC-Ironwill-Empathy build i grew so used to :(
---
I really like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, so I bought it along the Pig pack during Halloween. Little did I know that my love towards Leatherface would be rewarded with easy access to BBQ&amp;Chilli
---
SWF itself is game breaking. You have no right to whine 
---
What’s with the recent Sasuke choking memes?
---
Nice job! c:
---
It's really annoying that Bubba's 5th swing doesn't hit opponents, I've had so many situations when the charge ends on the 5th swing and nothing happens. 
---
If they fixed that, increased his movement speed while charging to 100% so that he doesn't have to be on your ass from the start to actually hit you and fixed the bug that causes you to get stunned after hitting a survivor with the chainsaw (even with grease) then LF would be a pretty good killer.
---
Just looked up its prior state, really upset that’s not it’s current state
---
I think they do it on purpose to see if they make the news (reddit) 
---
Wow, it looks great!! I can't wait to see it colored.
---
“You mean the chaos emeralds? I’m going to assume you mean the chaos emeralds, because I’ve got one of them, right here.”
---
hey wait a minute thats not a killer!
---
I'm assuming you fucked up that first sentence and I have every right to complain. Go bother someone else.
---
It makes people feel like they are doing something
---
THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVICE! I SUPPOSE COULD SEE THE APPEAL WITH CAMPBELL'S LAST BREATH BUT I FIND THE RANGE ADD-ONS HELP MUCH MORE THAN EXTRA BLINKS. USUALLY IF I RUN EXTRA BLINKS I ACCIDENTALLY USE THEM WHEN I DON'T NEED TO AND MESS EVERYTHING UP.
---
thank you!! I should be done within the next half hour because realisation of the day: drawing and colouring 5 kilograms of fog frolicking around those kiddos does take time
---
k
---
Its funny to call it a chapter
---
I mean, poor design choices will be poor design choices. Unless they change or remove these, we all have to deal with this nonsense. Though tunneling is a bit of a scale. There's the "I checked gens and found no one. Then someone got unhooked, so I should go there because that's half of the survivors or more if anyone is dead. Oh look, I only see the injured survivor who just off the hook." What survivors seem to expect is "Since I see the same survivor again, I'm going to *NOT* go after them." Obviously, that's just silly or way too nice. Then there's the tunneling that actually should piss people off. This is when the killer is chasing someone and either has another survivor run in front of them or goes right by a generator with one or more survivors on it, and goes out of their way to ignore those free hits or grabs just to keep chasing the same person. That's just stupid decision making and is pretty shitty for the survivor the killer chooses to go after. A hit is a hit, now multiple people are injured in less time than a down. It's common sense what is the smartest choice, yet they continue to go out of their way to avoid hitting survivors just to target one person. *That* is the tunneling people should complain about, not coincidentally finding the same person 3 times until their dead with no other encounters.
---
That moment when you turn away from the screen for a split second, outstanding move.
---
Haha fucking SWF
---
"us using comms to replace perks like Dark Sense and Empathy with beefed up versions to free up perk slots and coordinating in a way a one person team can't logically counter is not broken!11!!"
---
typical delusion 
---
I hate that map for both sides
---
Agreed, you have zero input or opinion on a particular perk/character if you only play one side. 
---
Because noed just guarantees you kills lol.
---
I thought this was common knowledge ?
---
Because he has no real counterplay and removes the outplay-potential from the game, he's only really good for tunneling, besides that he's kinda ass 
---
ALL SURVIVORS WHO WILLINGLY ENTER BASEMENT SHOULD DIE IF YOURE DOING BASEMENT OR SHACK DEFENDER ITS JUST THE RIGHT THING TO DO. SOUNDS LIKE A DUMB CLAUDETTE WHICH IS NORMAL FOR HER AND MEG PLAYERS 
---
Ace mains for life!!!!
---
Jeez ok
---
What do you mean by "they" screwed it up? Queue times just depend on who's playing and at what rank. Rank reset just happened so if you ranked down to rank 1 really fast that could fuck it up.
---
Agreed.
---
Wraith is about mid-tier right now, better than Pig, LF, Trapper, Freddy and Legion IMO and arguably same tier as Doctor, but he does need add-ons (namely windstorm to bodyblock pallets/vaults).
---
Dude I don't know what drugs you have taken but you clearly just came here to start a argument. Go bother someone else.
---
I've been known to get drunk and do stuff like this just because. I've used purple medkits with those addons, then would throw out a puzzle piece for a laugh.
---
SADLY TRUE. SOME KILLERS PLAY SCUMMY WITH TUNNELING, CAMPING, ETC., BUT A LOT OF SURVIVORS ACTIVELY GO OUT OUT OF THEIR WAY TO TRY AND RUIN A KILLER'S EXPERIENCE. STICK WITH IT THOUGH. THE FEELING YOU GET FROM PUTTING A FLASHLIGHT SPAMMER ON DEATH HOOK IS AWESOME
---
500 test cases is a fairly strong argument against it being bad luck.
---
Or rather: 477 test cases (ignoring the 23 deaths / dcs)
---
477 survivors on first box: 239 escape (50.1%)  
---
238 survivors on second box: 137 escape (57.5%)  
---
101 survivors on third box: 61 escape (60.3%)  
---
40 survivors on fourth box: 40 escape (100%)
---
The data is very strong for it being 50/50 on each box, with the fourth box being 100%.
---
Patch 2.1, same time as Hag. I'm not saying it was great, just that they already touched on him recently. 
---
Which update added the Trainspotting skins?
---
There's nothing more pathetic than people playing dumb
---
the saw franchise is heavily centered around the chinese year of the pig, that being the main reason they use a pig head to kidnap people, this year is the year of the pig once more
---
This is so quality, well done
---
Many people who say they main a side mean theu just play that side more often and like that gameplay more, not that they absolutely never play the other side
---
1. Reverse psychology on survivors might works better (PleaseDontDoGens).
---
2. "Direct" psychology on killers. They can be easily aggro. A failed teabag might be enough salt to fuel a killer for all the game (i.e. I will be happy to focus/kill a wanna teabag/looper).
---
3. "Troll" are to be ignored on both camps. They don't deserve your time.
---
Cheers :)
---
You are clearly a noob because no one experienced thinks SWF's is a game breaking game mode. 😂
---
It's not called a chapter. It's called a paragraph or a page or something like that I'm not sure
---
haha
---
"everyone good agrees with ME" he says through tears
---
I’d play Killer more of the wait times weren’t obnoxiously long. Too many killer mains and not enough survivor mains. 
---
Lord, imagine if they implemented a rule where you had to survive X number of matches before you could play Killer again. 
---
They’d lose their shit. 
---
I legit think they should do something like that though. For every 2-3 match escapes, you get a killer game, and you can stockpile up to like 5-10 killer games. Killers get more of a taste of the survivors side, and survivors get to play Killer more because they won’t have to wait as long to get into a game. 
---
Even though he is invisible he still moves grass when he walks through it, he also scares birds, look out for it. 
---
I was talking about that survivor offering
---
Even more rare then 4% if you count the rng of the hatch spawning there.
---
jason would pull out that shit and punch his head off
---
 more people in a lobby makes it harder to find a lobby
---
It honestly depends on which jason both in their prime Jason would more likely win
---
Thanks, that was funny xD I might try the first one for sure. It will also make the killer happy if we aren't doing objectives.
---
"gen rush" 
---
Yeah the survivors should wait and do nothing for a while rather than the game objective, the killer better no look or chase anybody either or I'll call "good ol hook rush"
---
Gotta sell this useless Killer somehow.
---
does it matter if it was reposted? people like u are really annoying.
---
Exactly. Gotta find that sweet spot.
---
Those are base game perks while BBQ is one of the most wanted perks ever because it cuts the grind in half while also providing aura reading. And its locked to a mediocre and very boring to play killer. I wonder why it hasnt been on the shrine....this is BHVR we’re talking about
---
Try joining a friend because you might have an "version mismatch" error. This happend to me as well. If theres nobody to join, verify integretity on steam 
---
Actually yes, pretty much yes.
---
I wonder if when he used his power he couldnt vault windows or if they just removed the ability to vault pallets (while at the same time making him 115% move speed), maybe that could give it good counterplay? 
---
I keep getting Mt. Ormund lol
---
not necessarily, I started with survivor and now I'm the nicest killer ever because it's just unfun to play against someone who tunnels the shit out of you or just uses the strongest stuff over and over again
---
Even though I love Doctor and Clown, they aren't for sure S+. Spirit should switch places with Wraith and Freddy + Legion should at least be swapped with Trapper
---
Rank resets usually mean smaller player pools at higher ranks, but you should be getting enough matches at your rank.
---
Do you play at off-peak hours such as mornings or nights?
---
Its been a rank reset recently so lots of people are still rank 15. This might be better in a week or 2. Not everyone has as much time to play 
---
Yes.
---
That's because it's only in the sweaty high ranks where all the annoying stuff comes out lol
---
Too many people in this game are completely clueless as to what is actually punishable by BHVR/EAC/Steam/whatever. 
---
Console's ban-ability aside, generally when someone threatens to report you in this game, you can just laugh it off because it's probably just salt.
---
Hell, just the last 2 weeks I was threatened with reports because of the following:
---
* Dribbling a decisive striker
---
* Letting someone with Decisive strike fall into the basement stairs
---
* Slugging someone to chase after a failed flashlight hero
---
* Hitting someone through a pallet
---
* Using Sloppy Butcher on Wraith
---
* Abusing the Myers house on Haddonfield (I actually felt a little bad because the layout was insane and I had Balanced Landing, but the killer used the map offering so I don't know what they expected)
---
* Throwing a pebble at the killer before leaving
---
* Having invincibility frames after being unhooked (And in fairness, these can be extremely bullshit in both ways, sometimes it feels like you wait until they're a few steps off and you still don't get the hit, other times it feels like you're dead as soon as you hit the ground. Yay clarity)
---
So yea, DbD is just one of those games where as long as you're not blatantly cheating or d/c'ing every other match, never worry about someone reporting you. They're mostly full of bullshit.
---
You should edit that in your post. It’s pretty far down in the comments.
---
Jesus Christ, this got my heart pumping.
---
As a killer main, I ain't even mad. You deserved to escape!
---
Come on buddy
---
Great poster, but the girl in front looks like she got roasted so bad she lost I.Q. points
---
Had a game the other day as Pig with a Survivor that would teabag after every pallet drop.  Instead of, you know, creating distance or AT ALL taking advantage of the stun.  I play my Pig with Bloodhound, so all this really resulted in was a bunch of broken pallets and that Survivor dying to a reverse bear trap halfway through the match.
---
I've played both survivor and killer and can pretty confidently say safety pipping is pretty easy as survivor so long as you don't get camped or chased the whole game.
---
Survivors need, like, 50% more bloodpoints permanently. That's about how much killers get on an average game. 
---
With BBQ even more so considering it's counter part WGLF is free.
---
No, i play at about 2pm but i live in belgium so maybe its bcs of that. 
---
You're defiant- I'll give you that much 
---
haha i kinda see it - maybe the entity extracted some of that iq 
---
Really like this idea dude. Maybe not survive 'x' amount of matches but at least participate.  
---
Get so many gen's completed, totem's cleansed or exit gates opened would be good objectives.  
---
This could also work with survivor mains too, they would need to complete 'x' amount of matches as a Killer, get so many hooks, sacrifices or using the Killers unique power 'x' amount of times.
---
Don't worry, he'll just pull out the ol "cancel myres tier 3 then flashlight blind" jitsu. And that wouldn't even make the top 10 most ridiculous things with that show.
---
After my last video helped a few of you out, I decided to do one on the basics of Pallet Looping. Includes the kinds of pallets, basic concepts, and real game applications. 
---
I was just saying gens can be repaired fast so it’s nice to have ruin for some breathing room...I obviously pushed a sensitive button for people
---
dont mean to burst your bubble but you cant actually depip below rank 15 and you're probably just rank 8-10 until toxicity , maybe ps4 different tho
---
it’s pink though
---
First survivor I got to lv50 was Feng. When I was new &amp; bad at the game I wanted technician (lol). Tbf Doctor was new at the time so every other game had doctor with overcharge. 
---
First survivor I prestiged was Jake. Have him at P3 now and I'm working towards all perks on him. 
---
First killer I got to lv50 was Wraith. He was easiest to learn with, also because I was new &amp; bad I thought predator would be a really good perk. 
---
Only killer I've prestiged so far is Leatherface. Only prestige 1 and I only did it because I ran out of decent add ons for him.
---
Ive seen more miraculous but yeah, this is decent, solid 7/10 maybe 8.
---
good for doctor, not really seeing a use for any other killer
---
Keeyah!
---
I dont use self care
---
Then again, I got to red ranks using perks like Wake Up and Diversion
---
Those are some nice moves! 
---
First killer was Myers because I love Halloween and the first survivor was Dwight because I had no idea what tf I was doing. Took me a while to move on to other survivors too. Didn't move on to Claudette until I had leveled up Dwight and Laurie
---
Lmao no it wouldnt, how delusional do you have to be to believe that. This isnt a quality meme and OP has proven himself to be a moron with the title and in the comments. This meme is literally a “le toggzic survivor startor pack, btw u not good for using this xddd”.
---
Mori'd
---
nah jason would get bodied
---
Actually almost no survivor worth their salt runs self care anymore in the high ranks. You’d rather just run iron will and not deal with 40 second healing times.
---
Doc and clown above billy lol..
---
whilst probably regretting some earlier life choices 
---
Playing Killer, should have made that clear
---
Dbd wiki says its pink, but my eyes say its red, so idk what to listen to
---
meg and wraith
---
I don’t know about the stats but most of the time personally if a killer leaves game without dashboarding on PS4 I keep most of my items.
---
I had about 12 DC’s last night personally and I always managed to keep my skeleton key and addon and managed to bring it into each of those DC’d games.
---
Yeah but the problem is that the Friday the 13 game was supposed to kill DdD lol
---
yeah but that and the basement window (which isn't always there) is the only place BL is useful
---
eabro7
---
All I said was gens can be repaired quickly and it’s nice to have ruin for some extra time. I know I’m still pretty new to this game but damn I guess y’all trigger easily even when no one is being aggressive. Lol
---
That wouldnt matter, i am a killer main as well and i had the same problem
---
It's random. The game makes way more money on cosmetics that it will from a £3-4 DLC. At this point people that are going to buy LF will have bought him and there won't be enough new players coming in now for them to care that much about selling their cheapest DLC. If people are waiting for it on the shrine they'll just save up shards and buy LF with shards instead of money. 
---
And your point being? The licensees don't have a grudge against dbd they just sell their character out 
---
It's on PC, friend. I'm just playing with a controller.
---
Then we should strive for counter mechanics, not removing them. We should want more ways to play the game not try to remove tunneling / camping / noed
---
Thank you SkittlesThompson very cool
---
It is annoying. I say, as a killer or survivor, no BM-ing unless the other side does it first. 
---
You used it negatively lol You said the good ol gen rush like its some kinda scummy tactic and not just playing the game. You knew exactly how you used it lmao
---
Hello, No.
---
Confirmed.
---
Isn't this from a terrible horror movie that released in 2018 / 2017 , I can't remember the name of it.
---
you should try the deinstall tactic :)
---
I don't think you need to state the obvious.
---
Thanks! He was so close though! That chase could've gone either way, I was just the luckier of the two :P
---
Nurse is easy
---
Killers and survivors have their fair share of broken meta perks
---
As mentioned, it's a bug fix not a change. And it's usually better to split everyone up and do gens anyway. Nothing's more satisfying than having like three gens click on at the exact same moment (unless you're killer, of course.)
---
First prestige was Claudette. I wanted to try and make a difference, and convince people that not all Claudettes were toxic. Mistake. 
---
First p3 was Doctor. I p3d Claudette afterwards, and now my Pig, Doctor, Claudette, Nea, and Feng are all p3. I have a bunch of p2 killers but other than that I just keep spending blood points because prestige isn't that cool. 
---
I definitely don't think all my prestige is meant to tell others I'm good at the game. I suck at the game, especially as Survivor... I can manage rank 1 as Killer but I can barely win at rank 10 as survivor. And the funny thing is I play more Survivor than Killer. But I just kinda play because I like the characters, and because parts of the game are fun.
---
Perhaps.
---
I tend to agree with you. As a general rule of thumb, however, a person who plays more frequently would probably, on average, be better than someone who plays once a month. 
---
But, that isn’t always the case. Like me. 2300 hours and I’m still pretty bad sometimes. 
---
I guess what I learned from this thread is I don’t know shit
---
Hag has plenty of cosmetics? 
---
Well, I didn't exactly **know** it was there... I was counting on Mr/Mrs. Entity being generous, and it didn't let me down :P
---
Yup. I don't deserve rank 1 killer.
---
Yet.
---
Ofcourse they are tactics, but they are scummy tactics. Sure tunneling and camping grant kills faster, but when you do that, survivors with somewhat IQ wil rush gens and cleanse totems, so not only do you get the camped survivor mad, you also only get one kill and you tilt yourself
---
Hello Zepp is such a great song.
---
I have played both sides a lot and nurse is broken a she is a killer that ignores all the core mechanics of survivors as well as being able to abuse a wide suit of perks
---
that’s like saying hag isn’t good without using her traps, obviously lmao
---
I’d rather not, it’s more suiting of below average players such as yourself. 
---
No chance. He's a worse hillbilly and especially without addons just isn't good enough. Very easy to loop, terrible map pressure, and some maps shut him down hard. He's on of the best basement camping killers if you're running perks geared to that, but otherwise he's just not good at all.
---
I will breaks this chain
---
Hahahah I can't say TEW was a direct inspiration, but the more cinematic, the better! :P
---
Same question to devs and legion mains ;D otherwise i won t dc and didn t recognize more dc‘s
---
not proud of the amount i games i throw to facecamp survs that upset me &lt;/ 3
---
not everyone has been around for 4 years like yourself. give people a break. and might i just add, this is my first time seeing this video 
---
Monto always has good killer builds. I'd check out some of his stuff. 
---
Personally, I usually run ruin, haunted grounds, make your choice, bbq+chili. (Or thrill of the hunt + devour hope instead of the latter two.) But then I also just play the pig to have fun and instadown people when I can, so it's not really a serious build.
---
There was no reason to t-bag, LF played a fair game!
---
Since the healing nerf I’m sure Claudette is not #1, since self care was her only meta perk and a lot of people don’t even run it anymore. 
---
I definitely agree! Goddamn brick walls :P
---
Thanks, I tried by best! :)
---
At best he’s low mid tier. He’s incredibly easy to loop. As long as you don’t wander into a dead zone with no windows he is forced to M1. 
---
it absolutely counts. on console its harder to juke/360 and the game is more shit. 
---
Yet DS is a bi-monthly thing...
---
Sorry this is late, but personally, I love to do an end game oriented build.
---
NOED - For obvious reasons.
---
Remember Me - To try and extend the end game period as long as possible.
---
BBQ and Chili/Blood Warden - BBQ for knowing their locations after every hook. You could switch it out for Blood Warden if you want more endgame time. I prefer BBQ, but Blood Warden could work in it’s place if needed.
---
Ruin - To extend the game so you have more time to get Remember Me tokens and hooks in before the end game. Also just a solid perk in general.
---
Add-on wise, I would use Tampered Timer and Box of Gears. Really, just add-ons about the traps.
---
Save all your traps for the end game, they can’t leave through the gates if there’s a hat on their head. This might not be the best build for Pig, but this is one that I always love to do.
---
If the exit gates are opened, I don't disagree with face-camping and I understand what it's like to be so angry as killer that you rage quit but that doesn't mean that the OP is obligated to leave their mate there so the killer could get their last kill. So I don't get why people are accusing this person of "farming". It's annoying we can't have a conversation without it becoming a killer circle jerk. He made a play and it worked. The killer got outplayed.   
---
Disclaimer and it's fucking ridiculous I have to bring this up but, I mainly play killer myself and could see two sides of this situation and I agree with doing it if the gates are opened. 
---
And when was the last time she received one?
---
You won’t get banned.
---
On paper, not in practice.
---
I like running a totem guard/russian roulette build with Spirit. Thrill of the hunt, ruin, haunted grounds, and devour hope and you can know when anyone's working on a totem. Even if they manage to break one, it could be haunted grounds, which is just instant exposed effect.
---
Add in yamaoke beads and you can silently approach and grab them off the totem, which is always hilarious. Add in an offering for the game map or another tiny map and you're just bullying at that point lol. Though, admittedly, in a SWF it can be difficult if they coordinate working on multiple totems at once (at that point, you hope the russian roulette screws them and they manage to break haunted grounds instead of an actually useful totem.)
---
People get so distracted with totems when they know you have ruin, let alone when they know you have multiple hexes, so you don't have to worry about generators as much. And even if they do ignore the totems and go for gens instead, so long as you keep hooking people, your devour hope will keep gaining tokens, forcing them to *eventually* try and deal with the totems.

Claudette and Na
---
It heals the killers too
---
I'm digging how you drew the clothes 😍
---
you could try checking the gens
---
Congrats dude, on console it only works for healing, so like... 4 seconds at a time... Your patience is immeasurable and I'm in awe
---
It can be strong on the doctor, but on most killers its just alright. 
---
ever
---
Being a sore winner (or loser) is pretty inexcusable though. IMO, anyway. 
---
Jesus what the hell are you doing to those killers
---
That is true, but there is only the gap between your current rank and getting to rank 1 for the first time. After that you don't even have to try
---
Idk man. I have over 1k hours and survive most of my games, and 3k most of my games. But landing a DS skill check is a 3/10 thing for me. I rarely can ever hit that skill check. People that can do it consistently have my respect.
---
I agree that its a game breaker as a High Rank Killer and Survivor. vs 4 Randoms if I chase someone off a totem i can probably keep that totem. vs SWF on Comms that totem is as good as gone even if it had a good placement.
---
If as Legion I use Iridescent Button and try to scare people off Gens when im across the map because they think im omw it wont work on SWF on Comms. Similar to how Knockout and The Third Seal are completely useless on coms
---
With all that said comms are the issue and people should be able to play a Multiplayer game with their friends. Bhvr fix this shit
---
&gt;You don’t understand that this isn’t a horror game, it’s an action game with horror elements.
---
Well said, that really describes how a lot of new players look at this game. It took me about a season to grasp that.
---
this guy tanks bullets like they are nothing jason would body him
---
True.
---
oh it is I see it as useless as hell only use to see if there were survivors near
---
That's not relevant to what he's saying. 
---
You're not wrong. I'm on the fence with the "rank means nothing" debate that has been going on lately. Because like I said, the more you play, the better you get (theoretically, of course.) So if you're playing enough to rank up, a lot (but not all) of those people are going to be more skilled in-game than someone who isn't playing very often. 
---
But, on the other hand, like you said, it's not much of a chore to rank up after reset. Basically as soon as you get there once, you're going to get there every time if you continue playing the same amount of time as you usually do. 
---
That's why I feel there needs to be a bigger requirement curve. The issue is that I'm not sure what that would be. Thus the whole system is at a standstill. 
---
yep
---
Last night went surprisingly well for finding matches. 5 matches found with less than 10 minute wait time for each, some less than 5. I don't know why but it was nice.
---
But that map info
---
If you disconnect, you are a bitch. If you’re that bothered by the internet, don’t struggle on the hook.
---
Disconnecting is unacceptable from either side unless it’s the only way out (body-blocked in the basement, trapped by a fellow survivor, what gave you). A frustrating experience is not a valid reason.
---
As you mentioned distressing, as the others mentioned "calm" add-ons. Agitation increases terror radius while you're carrying someone but I wouldn't use that on the doctor really unless you're trying for a basement build. 
---
I would use overwhelming presence if they have items (it increases consumption rates while in your terror radius) and *definitely* unnerving presence in general (makes skill checks more difficult while in your terror radius, which in addition to Doctor's madness effects can screw up skill checks constantly.) 
---
Ignore him. He's known as the village idiot of this sub.
---
Why DC? Why not just hit the hook, die, and not act like a petulant child? Bonus is you keep your points. The more important part is DCing is a garbage-person thing to do.
---
&gt;Hagphobia
---
HAGPHOBIA  ^(I'm done after this remark, dis too much.) 
---
Legion is your answer.
---
Hilarious
---
Make Your Choice + Mint Rag is *toxic* and *fantastic*. Walk away and as soon as they're unhooked, teleport back and instadown the person who did the unhook (maybe even the person they unhooked too, if given the chance.) 
---
My fave builds are russian roulette/totem guard builds because I just find them so fun. Hag isn't as good at it as spirit or nurse, but ruin/devour hope/thrill of the hunt/haunted ground + traps near them can usually be pretty effective. 
---
BENUTZE DIE KETTENSÄGE
---
Gang memes aren't funny and never were
---
Mint rag is infinite rang and rusty shackles hides the phantasm. 
---
(Nerdy hag main to the rescue with the add on names lol)
---
I can already imagine mains of him yelling "GET OVER HERE" while reeling in a survivor.
---
Tier lists are very dumb TBH. Every person has a different way of playing the game making some killers a lot better than others. Tyde's list is a good example. He placed Hag really low, but he had 0 traps placed down. Each killer plays very differently and every player plays differently, so a tier list means little to none TBH.
---
They're human alright. They just have a long lasting sprint burst.
---
We all say Nea is the killer when we've been sleeping on Meg. She's the *real* killer and secretly part of the Legion. 
---
Honestly I’d put hag upper A tier, mostly because her power is restricted and she otherwise has to move at 110%. Like if there’s somebody close to unhook she can’t make it back if they crouch with urban and she can’t rush back to a generator she knows somebody is on. The spirit can, nurse can, and so can billy which is what I think separates her. The spirit being lower S tier of course.  Hag definitely is A tier though from the effect she has on the game
---
"But I hit rank 1 every season! I am the say all end all!" Couldn't agree more friend, take your karma!
---
It also has no affect against a freddy, cloaked wraith, or crouching pig. Really stupid, I stopped running that perk awhile ago because it rarely works out.
---
👌
---
Legion isn't the biggest problem with the game, but a lot about him is illustrative of problems with the game, not to mention he just might be the most poorly designed *thing* I've ever seen in a video game. 
---
May not be effective but you could try using the in lobby chat before game to set up some expectations with your team mates. Just tell them to do gens if someones being camped etc. doesnt always work but could be vital
---
This is why I took into consideration the highest skill floor posdible for each one.I am basically rating them with a close to perfect player behind them.
---
"When I play killer I don’t receive ANY hateful messages. I play so fun and the most respectful way and there’s people who really suck @ giving a shit for others. If killers say “there’s no rules” then don’t complain about DS, t-bagging, flashlights etc. y’all have it sooo easy and that’s that on THAT. But one thing to remember, we all have one thing in common, DBD. So don’t be a d\*ck weasel to others."  
---
I know a lot of people are going to take umbrage with that statement and I could understand, but killers can we step back a little and try to understand that this game could be rough for both sides? I agree with the OP that the game could be stressful and unfun. I could sit down and play other horror games but playing killer in DBD asks that I be in a near Jedi like mindset or I get gray hairs. 
---
I know, I'm saying your cap for bps goes up by 1 mill as well.
---
That's a good joke mate. 
---
You posting on reddit is exactly why they do it lol. They want to provoke a reaction, especially an irritated one. 
---
(My fave is when my rancor target is doing it like an *idiot*. Or when Myers secretly has his instakill add ons equipped lol)
---
He's around mid-tier. Bodyblocking with Windstorm and Swift Hunt makes him considerably better than Leatherface and other killers along those lines.
---
&gt;if we're sticking to canon, Freddy can only kill you if you're afraid of him.
---
Well, you'd be absolutely correct if our Freddy was cannon with Robert Englund's Freddy. It would be cannon that depriving him of fear makes you invulnerable to him. 
---
But! We got the Jackie Earl Hailey version of Freddy. And if you recall correctly; Nancy in that movie tried the whole "I'm not afraid of you, fuck you" approach, but that only resulted in Freddy laughing at her and confirming that he has control in the dream world regardless of how you feel about him. 
---
I am not the one who is getting tunelled. I am just curious why do people tryharding that much.... It's just annoying when I trying to help this game and play with my friends who bought this game because I told them about it and then they can't even play with me because fucking tryhards are tunneling them as nurse... For new players it's hard to escape from everything. How can they then escape Nurse? It's fucking uncountertable. And when they ask me how to play vs her. I just have to said "try to be stealth".. It's pathetic... 2 of my friends don't want to play this shit because of it.
---
You are right but unlike billy,spirit and huntress she can apply pressure around the whole map at the same time.
---
Just as ugly as the real. One!
---
Yeah godforbid they have fun in a game. 
---
Anyone paid to play the game would be a professional in this instance. 
---
Sorry about the background noise, I was watching Tru3
---
If a killer doesn't use their abilities, they're a bad killer. 
---
Duh, lmao.
---
Leader is an aura perk so you can't be affected by it yourself, you can only affect other people with it. 
---
Not gonna need Small Game for this one
---
I started using nurse on Xbox and I don’t see what people mean she is definitely still playable and fun
---
His map pressure is horrid, it takes ten seconds to mend and you don’t need to heal at all against him. If you aren’t in a chase you should be on a gen or saving someone. There’s no way to drag out the chase so yeah your gonna go down no matter what you do but 4ks with the legion should be way more rare than they are.
---
Leatherface below Freddy? Why on earth?
---
Ones like these aren’t very funny, but you said “never were”, and that’s what I’m disagreeing with
---
Lmao whiny babies bro. "Toxic killer"? Aka you took away all their playing cards and exposed the fact that they are playing a game as four random weaponless civilians with flashlights and wrenches and who wants to play a game you can't win lmao. Kick their assess
---
Lf is only good at camping wtf you mean.If survivors have an ounce of a brain you will not get a chainsaw the whole game.Freddy as bad as he is with the right add-ons he can be quite decent.Still trash but not lower than bubba.
---
Just don’t heal against him and he loses all pressure.
---
Be nice.
---
Hey Vigil and Streetwise are crap but they are aura perks too :D
---
As someone who leans towards killer more I can't be mad about 360s. Extra tech in a game is always cool, it's not really an exploit and you can counterplay it.
---
However I think listing the killer hours along with each play is pretty lame. Why go through the trouble of looking up their steam profile for each clip? It's not insane that you spun someone with 500 hours, killers with thousands of hours whiff all the time and survivors with thousands of hours also make bad decisions/plays. It's not a perfect game and nobody should be expected to play it perfectly at all times.
---
DStrike was in the shrine 3 times last year (thats over the span of 52 weeks). Was also in the shrine 3 times in 2017 and once in 2016. So I don't know how you figure its bi-monthly since it has only been in the shrine a total of 7 times over ~3 years.
---
The bonuses of the perk are okay at best. There’s no reason it shouldn’t be on all hooks if it was gonna get a buff. You hit the next stage 6 seconds faster. That’s it.
---
I played 95% survivor for a long time, have been playing just killer for the past few weeks and yeah I definitely can see both sides of every argument when it comes to this game now. Honestly when it comes down to it I think most arguments just amount to the game being heavily RNG based, as well as how unbalanced killers are (nurse vs Freddy for example). There’s just no way to make this game “balanced” when there’s so many variables. Another example is the doctor. He’s just a mid tier killer on most maps, but give him The Game map with terror radius add ons and he becomes a beast.
---
Quentin and Huntress were my first P3s, then I was like "hmm, I could do with some different perks" so started levelling others
---
Primelink! I am on a fucking roll! From rank 16 to 13 in two days (5hours i think). Man, I love you. Never hit 13 in my life! 
---
Now, as a sub of yours, I'll ask this question: what do I need to know if I manage to get in green ranks?
---
I'll camp if I have survivors swarming the hook to insta-save them. At that point it's free hits.
---
I will try not to tunnel the unhooked one, but honestly hitboxes suck and sometimes you got the wrong one. So, my bad.
---
But if all 4 survivors are serving themselves to you on a platter, yeah, take it. 
---
Annual repost. Just a different caption each time and its fine :3
---
Myers should higher, his instadown is really good when used at an opportune moment and can turn the game around. Doctor should be lower. I think LF is still better than freddy, just because Freddy’s ability to stall the game is basically nonexistent if you’re going for no add ons, also he has to wait some time to down, and if you ARE using add ons, LF is better just because he can instadown consistently. Both get looped like normal killers, but whereas freddy has to wait some time to hit survivors (allowing them to get to pallets that they otherwise wouldn’t have gotten to), LF engages in chase normally. Freddy has some interesting endgame, but his endgame relies on being able put all survivors in the dream state, which isn’t always going to happen unless you abandon chase and let them fail their healing skill check. Survivors can cleanse totems to counter NOED, and remember me requires you to prioritize the obsession. If you miss even one survivor to put in the dream state at endgame then they will certainly wake up their teammates or open a gate. 
---
I agree on the part with the 4ks. I think it’s mostly because many people still heal up to full. That said though a good legion player with perks and Addons is just not fun, cuz he basically always knows where
---
you are and you only get to do a gen if he chooses not to sprint to you.
---
I don’t think legion is a particularly strong killer. The concept is just not fun to play against imo.
---
I think it's called a 2 sentence poem.
---
Claudette and Doc
---
NEIN! xd
---
It's only scummy to y'all cuz now you're exposed for playing a game as civilians vs a killer without weapons
---
That baby sized myers looks fucking hillarious. Literally a baby killer 
---
“Guys I swear! It’s not pink, it’s salmon :(“
---
halloween (2018)
---
Playing a match where every thing is going perfectly until the killer starts sweating bullets because there's only 1 gen left and has to resort to lag switching. Do I stay to embarrass him even more or dc... Choices.
---
Except the data doesn’t suggest is 50/50 each time as the stat tests showed. It’s possible but with a p-val less than .05 it’s not likely. I’m not sure why it would be 8:4:2:1 but that seems most probable. Either way something is wrong with the game as it most certainly is not 1:1:1:1.
---
I'm not going to argue that legion was well designed, but you cant argue that not initially balancing around comms wasn't just as bad as a design failure
---
A bit misleading
---
I like to equally split my time, and I tell new players to do the same. Its helped countless times to find survivors in spots I would go to as one, or evade the killer by understanding line of sight.
---
Theres also nothing like slaughtering 4 people after being killed yourself. Great fun.
---
Imagine being this insecure about rank to deflect then double down insulting OP
---
Timeshocked, I totally understood what you meant.  Gen rushing is a thing idk why people say the term is dumb. My friends and I have had all the gens done in like 10 min oncee and the killer freaked out. You are right people are odd on this sub. Yesterday I made a comment on how Freddy doesn't need to be buffed and go so many dislikes. This will also get disliked i bet lmaoo
---
I started with Dwight (wanted Bond) but then quickly ended up leveling and sticking with Jake. For Killer at first I went with Nurse (she’s the best so therefor I should start with her right?), but then bought Myers and have him all leveled now.
---
Thank you! I forget a lot of addon names for killers I don’t really play, but I’ve been looking into Hag so maybe I’ll play her. 
---
Feels like this sometimes. 
---
1) 1 require no skill 2) 1 5) i dc everytime ;D 6) no place 7) depend on player.. everytime annoying 8) c 9) delete legion immediately 
---
They're using gross exaggeration to prove their point
---
He’s a big boy.....
---
Lolol, I had to double check that wasn't me as a killer--I play Legion and this shit happens to me all the time. But sometimes people think they're smooth and I've actually just walked away on purpose.
---
Isn’t joe black?
---
Been subbed to it since it started. :D :D :D
---
Happy degenerate here!
---
If not your idea then they should just scrap the whole bloody clothes 'reward' and give shards for each prestige. I don't use the store so I don't know what values would be appropriate but enough to buy a piece from the store. Should be easy enough to do retroactively too if they wanted.
---

They can they just don't want to anymore. Sony and Microsoft don't have any control over the companies ability to keep control and order of their games. As it stands right now, each side points the finger at each other. You can't report cheaters to Sony anymore and behaviour won't do shit about reports. They both say to report to each other. Sony&lt;-|-&gt;behaviour. It'll never end until behaviour does something. But they won't because they don't give a damn about console. 
---
Oh im sorry, I forgot Freddy is good while LF only camps, even tho Freddy cant even do that.
---
your whole comment proves you havent touched Bubba in your life and are just using memes are your info source, and considering you have posts like [legion\_is\_far\_worse\_than\_freddy](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ae6ih2/legion_is_far_worse_than_freddy/) and  [opinion\_about\_truetalent](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aeafsc/opinion_about_truetalent/) where you openly say "Just to clarify Im a salty survivor main", you are nothing more than a sad survivor trying to be cool making a tier list.
---
The problem is, regardless of ‘sides’ we’re all playing the same game trying to have fun. Taking things too seriously and pitting factions against each other is pointless
---
I wanna be able to make the noise the wraith makes when he gets stunned so I can scare the piss out of everyone including myself
---
Joe’s black 
---
&gt;I know my internet is a bit shit atm
---
If you know that and you know that the killer is always the host then why do you host games and degrade console performance and the experience for players anyways?
---
yeah - I think he had this lighter makeup stuff around his eyes on the renders without his mask if I'm not mistaken
---
In all honesty, Green ranks are where the game changes a bit. You'll start to hit killers who are from the high ranks due to rank reset. In my opinion, the best thing to do is just practice how to run. If you can do generators, you can play in low ranks. If you can learn how to run, you can play mid tier (Green). 
---
Once you get passed mid tier, you start to learn new things like map pressure, gen locking, and killer mindset. I'll be doing a new video on those soon. As for right now, just practice what you learned till you perfect it. Congrats on 13!
---
The Legioa
---
Seems a bit late for that now.
---
BHVR could fall out SAY “BBQ isn’t gonna be in the shrine” and people would still not buy it. It’s been over a year now and every week it ain’t changing. The shrine is about as random as my ass. We had Enduring in the shrine two times in the same month span but sure with every killer teachable bbq doesn’t show up after 104 chances???????
---
All the previous chapter's would be possible to include
---
true! there's some white stuff around his eyes on the render without his mask, i tried to make it work :)
---
It’s done the way it is because less people play killer and so the BP acts as an incentive, and it’s the more difficult role to play, and thus more rewarding. If I consistently got just as much for playing survivor as I get for playing killer then honestly I’d just go play survivor all the time and play killer for dailies. As it is there aren’t enough killers on console right now and there’s always been less than on pc, I don’t think the few people suffering through the console killer experience need a good reason to switch roles and screw queue times up more.
---
There are a few streamers and others who are solo sided. 
---
Lmao u sound like a kid who got busted for stealing candy
---
Justice is served would u like a side of rice 
---
Oh yeah now that I look closer I can see it. I like your art style, nice work!
---
So you support exploits in online video games?
---
Just played a killer game as the hillbilly to get my chainsaw daily done, and 2/4 survivors D/Ced instantly the moment I downed them.
---
Really just makes the game less fun when people rage quit, not to mention they just screw their own teammates even more.
---
Help me out here, I'm not a statistician.
---
But to me the numbers look like this:
---
477 test cases (ignoring the 23 deaths / dcs)
---
Yeah I fully agree with that. He’s really low tier, he’s just impossible to escape from at the same time.
---
Not sure I understand what you meant by "it started happening". You sandbagged her because she was farming you or something ?
---
I wouldn't mind if a friend did this tbh, because it's okay for friends to tease and annoy each other. However, doing it to someone you don't know is a lot more malicious imo.
---
Inb4 it’s Shroud of Separation. 
---
He didn't have a lag switch he had a PWN switch
---
Yes but most are also highly capable of playing the other side at a high level 
---
Everyone's argument is also anecdotal, so what's your point? Go troll somewhere else.
---
Sorry for late reaponse. This is actually JUST a Story nothing else
---
I mean whatever you say dude but Myers can’t blink through walls 
---
Unfortunately yeah but I'd totally buy a all season pass to future DLC and stuff so I didn't have to buy them as they came out.
---
Fucking beautiful. I laughed way too hard at this. 
---
I would imagine so. I watch my friends who got me into this game try to play Killer and I’m reminded why we only play survivor together. 
---
Lmao
---
and now that I look closer it rather comes across as a skin condition than edgy makeup. darn. but thank you! :)
---
He deserves it tbh. 
---
Trapper looks like le epic trollface
---
Constantly have this problem, no matter how many people I'm playing with.  I usually get to play with 2 other friends, and the waiting time for **ONE** extra survivor to bring the party up to 4 is just asinine, especially when I can quit out, look for a game just by myself and be in a lobby in seconds.
---
You can facecamp all you want but you’ve probably bitched about rude survivors at some point, so whatever
---
LOL do you have a link?
---
"go to this hook"
---
In my first week of owning the game I hit rank one. That tells you rank has nothing to do with skill. I just had good teammates who knew what they were doing
---
omfg i was shivering
---
They were probably just goofing off and having fun. There’s really no need to be so serious about it. 
---
Nah it's live. She can grab you whilst in her fatigue and pallet stunning her doesn't do anything. You get the points for killer stun and yet she's still allowed to just hit you anyways (even when she got fatigued as well).
---
You sir, are the type of cancer that makes me hate all survivors.
---
I was honestly hoping for something simple like holding a finger to their face and doing the shhh gesture
---
The whole reason it's for the basement is because it would be unfair out of the basement. Buuut you might be right in saying it would just be a really good perk, because I still think it would be more situational than anything. Like "why choose is over other perks" not that worth it.
---
like the last 5 minutes of a slasher film right there
---
Considerate of you but no one cares m8
---
I AGREE. BUT I DONT DO THAT SHIT. JUST TRYING TO DO SOME GENS AND GTFO.
---
Any profit is good profit my guy, I wouldn’t put it past them or any other game developers honestly. Also you can’t but LF with anything but actual money since he’s a licensed character.

As a killer main who plays survivor games for rituals and as a "cool-down" between killer games, camping killers bum me out. It's not fun nor optimal, and you're risking losing 3 in exchange for 1.    
---
The only reason I can see for it is ignorance or just salt mining. C'mon buddy.
---
Yea but I guess it makes sense that a lot of the scummy, sensitive players would flood the subreddit too. Great game, horrible community. It’s a game!
---
Yeah I realised you can't get LF with shards
---
You sir are one of a kind. Likes call people names on reddit, but claims to let the killer kill him in DBD.
---
I've been playing Nurse on console (with mediocre results), and never noticed this happening, though I never tried swinging while I was fatigued.  I'm guessing it won't work if you have already swung before the fatigue, right?
---
*Decisive Strike, Self Care, Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion*
---
I am so tempted to slam that pallet down, then take out a flashlight and start shinning. 
---
That face, its so perfect lmaoo
---
Thank you!
---
oh fuck me, i did it
---
Haha. Believe it or not. A Myers just dropped me on the hatch. I crawled to the nearby hook. I don't want mercy escapes.  
---
Weird flex but ok
---
For me, at least, I don't expect people to bring keys. So when people do bring keys, since they are small, I miss it 😂. That is just me though.
---
Loll what is this??
---
cute af. Especially the trapper.
---
It's easy to miss. I never notice the key, I just just sometimes see that their hand is in an odd pose and go, "Oh, must be a key."
---
How much would it cost tho. They plan on adding alot of new killers and quite a bunch have been released already. I doubt you'd get away with your 20-25 €/$/whatever currency.. 
---
The guy you are referencing is an over dramatic whiner who won’t put in a simple ticket with customer service and has resigned to bitching and spamming because he’d rather have attention than to get his issue fixed. 
---
PC land however, no shortage of killers whatsoever. Try getting into a killer game. See how long it takes. There’s an unnecessary surplus, and no whiner is going to change my mind on that.  
---
How were you sprinting for like 10 seconds straight? 
---
Myers lacks map pressure.This is why he is mid tier.
---
A vast majority of survivors don't do this from my experience and most will even fake you out and make you miss as they run out. Or better yet are standing there tbagging while you hit them which I wouldn't really consider a nice gesture. For the most part survivors are being strategic and staying in the game as long as possible in case a teammate needs it or to waste more time until completely pushed out.

Even the ones that do let you hit them, it's not really anything special. Like, yea they're giving you a few hundred points, but they risk literally nothing to do so. When a killer "plays nice" they're risking throwing their win away by letting someone out of the basement, not punishing bad unhooks, not chasing the same guy they keep finding over and over again because he sucks at hiding, etc. 
---
Technically they're "being nice" letting you hit them, but only because they don't lose anything and don't have to try. But you certainly dont see them walk away from the gate after winning and let a killer down them and get a free kill/hook. That would risk them dying/ not getting saved, etc. 
---
I also want a refund but i know devs will do nothing with legion because of the dlc money -.-
---
It’s not a competition...

Hmm, it seems that this post was inspired by the survivor version of the title
---
Right! The response people give when camping is discussed is “just do gens”. Now apparently if you just do gens, you are gen rushing. Campers and tunneling right off hook limit what secondary actions survivors can do during the game. 
---
U forgot insidious dawg
---
That's a moot point because it's not fun to play against survivors that all have unfun super strong perks and addons over and over again either.
---
I would bring so many of these into a game thinking they were automatic on first use just to lose them and think to myself “why does it never work”
---
maybe out next killer will actually look and be scary but one thing is certain, they cant possibly make a worse killer now. So its all up from here on out!
---
Thanks for actually doing the correct math. The horrible handling of probabilities in the OP about gave me a stroke
---
Then you’ve never seen a Pig successfully ambush an exposed survivor.  Let me tell you, it doesn’t matter that Amanda is a girl, watching that brief flash of terror in the instant before they’re laid out cold, that will pitch anyone’s tent.
---
What? Not at all. Saying “oh shit it’s the wraith!” doesn’t suddenly make it impossible for the killer to play.
---
Maybe $60? 
---
NOED ISNT BROKEN. and neither is DS. decisive strike is fair, it resets a chase and if you are a good killer it doesn't even matter. noed can literally be removed before the end of the game, cleanse the fucking totems.
---
&gt;bubba with a mori
---
??????
---
Yeah, I get 1 survivor daily to maybe 5-8 killer ones. Plus, in general, the BP is so fucking low. I don't know why they nerfed them before. 
---
Great for the community's numbers, bad for the flood of "Why does the killer [rush the objective] in every one of my matches??" posts on /r/dbd. 
---
You do realise I just go with OPs Bad Joke?
---
Low effort
---
Ok then.I agree here.Can you show me someone who play lf good so I can understand why he is a better killer than freddy?no sarcasm 
---
I had a stroke trying to read that reply but it’s not your fault lol it’s me, so I apologize if I say something that repeats what you said or something totally wacky. Anyways, it’d become a perk with no downsides or conditions but still average at best, so it’d at least be a good perk that you could run if you didn’t have very much else to run. Imo there’s nothing wrong with that kinda like botany knowledge, no downsides and if you want it then it’s still a good perk.

I've counted every ragequit I've had on the survivor side since January 19th 2018. The list is at 350 ragequits. And I haven't played much this last 2-3 months and this summer. But for instance, the month of september where I played regularly, I've had 4 ragequits per day in average.
---
Thank you! I had to update my GPU in order to be able to play on Ultra with 50+ FPS. Before, I couldn't get past 45 FPS on Medium.
---
Lmao I remember the guy who posted the survivor one, this is hilarious.
---
I love these passive-aggressive survivor memes
---
Toxic *cough* *cough*
---
I mean keys are op.They are the survivors mori.
---
Entered this room of randoms that all had the same outfit. Didn't want to be the only Claudette in a room of Nea, so of course I had to join them.
---
While making shit ideas in the comments. Penisfinger
---
And that wouldn’t be a problem if the balance wasn’t skewed so bad to where wait times to get into matches were insane for one party, but not the other. Not to mention people really should play both sides more often rather than having completely biased opinions all the time. 
---
Ds... oof
---
The crutches are NOED ;)
---
Oh LMAO
---
And you have to die a few times to learn both lol
---
It's a face only a mother could love. 
---
Hey br
---
What GPU do you have? Also what’s your graphics settings? I can’t really tell through reddit
---
I considered how to handle them but since we don't have enough info about the match it's best to exclude them. It's reasonable to assume that people who died were more likely on the latter boxes, but that doesn't mean they all were box 4. Not to mention we have no idea about the DCs. 
---
Either way though, the numbers don't lie that it most certainly is not 1:1:1:1. Used a program that was more precise and it turns out I got the lowest p-value I've seen outside of a textbook. Good job BHVR!
---
Except Mori’s are guaranteed to work throughout the entire match and keys are an end game item for which specific requirements have to be met first, including finding the hatch. 
---
Oh wait. Yeah, they’re nothing alike. 
---
I think you dont have enough experience to make video 
---
Would not call that looping tho, just used every pallet instantly
---
Fire up creates a wildfire killing all survivors
---
I absolutely will dc without hesitation on "The Game" map because actually fuck that map for both sides, other than that only if I'm hella rubberbanding or 2/4 of my teammates also dc'd @ game start with 5 gens still left because thats just a waste of time at the point.
---
I love passive-aggressive survivor memes, but the OPs should start [linking the threads](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agvh97/when_will_survivors_learn_using_these_things/) that rustled their jimmies for reference.
---
Not really.Keys can totally turn a game around.
---
Reposted because original got removed due to lack of flair.
---
Entered this randon room of Nea all dressed the same, so naturally I had to change my character and outfit to match.
---
The only ones I can agree with are myers pickup mori and the alignment for Billy's mori. The rest are great. Specially legions ironically enough. His is pretty smooth
---
Wrong.  They discussed this.  Prove thyself only cancels out the 10 percent penalty each user receives from working on a generator.
---
And that penalty wasn't even being applied due to a bug.  
---
If more than 1 person is running prove thyself, you get no additional benefit.
---
bingo!  winning idea here, I honestly think they are moving this direction. 
---
Your post makes so many false assumptions. 
---
I’m talking about PRIOR to rank reset happening. 
---
My internet is beyond optimal. Fiber optics are the future after all. Technology is what I do for a living. 
---
And yeah, I gave up after sitting for 20 solid minutes to get into a killer game. Not fun. 
---
But you still made it clear there’s a problem with queue times for killer on PC. That’s because there’s too many of them. 
---
Usually you get 5000 points or an escape unless the killer pulls the plug on the game, in which case it’s an exploit of the p2p connection mechanic and there’s nothing they can do about it until we get dedicated servers.
---
He had a mori daily but no Rancor/DH, dont mind him
---
Getting hit in the face or the back of the head with a bottle generally interrupts whatever it is you were doing.

Hi this isn't me. This is a relatively new streamer on twitch. [https://www.twitch.tv/everettss](https://www.twitch.tv/everettss) if  you want to check him out more he streams dbd quite oftenly
---
It’s part of why survivor items just need to be invisible to the killer. They already get a leg up by being invisible before the game starts. Killers love to take franklins when they see keys, or lobby dodge when they see flashlights for P3 Claudette’s, or lord knows... if too many people appear at the same time. It’s ridiculous. 
---

---
not sure what you mean by moot point but I don't have much of a problem dealing with DS, syringes, adrenaline plays, etc. At worst you can uaually still get around 2 kills if you play your cards well. I do enjoy a good challenge so I could care less about any strong tools they bring in as it adds to the difficulty. And if you get a 2k with bad perks versus survivors with all the best shit wouldn't you be satisfied?
---
Yes I am, no idea how this is funny.

What makes you think that?

So you’re saying if each survivor has (let’s just say) 100% gen repair speed, and two survivors are working on a gen, instead of 200% its 190% and prove thyself would just cancel that penalty? What about other speed ups such as leader, spine chill, resilience, toolboxes, etc. would that increase speed with prove thyself or is there a max speed per person or per generator

I GOT DISCONNECTED 5-7 TIMES AND IT REMINDED ME HOW BAD DIAL UP WAS, AOL TO BE SPECIFIC.
---
and thats great for you, but trying to play killer and survivor is too hard. Survivor mains dont have to care, its a skin. but killer players have to wait on a whole 6 milliopn bloodpoints to get a load out and thats dumb to wait on a character lkike that. 
---
I think you’re not reading the things I’m saying at all. I just said it was fine to camp. Even hard camp. But that standing directly under the hook was too much (and even proved to be part of why he lost). But that’s cool, throw out your edgy rulebook, good for you. I’ll keep mine so the karma gods of DBD keep giving me more pleasant, fun killers when it’s my turn to play survivor 
---
Couldn’t help but grab the doctor and spirit on that sale. Looking forward to playing them!
---
If he loses the ability to vault his power becomes a shitty version of the spirit. 
---
Discontinue perks that aren't ever used rather than buffing/nerfing them every few months?
---
 Also not every new chapter needs new perks with the new survivor/killer. STOP making new perks to fix shitty game design or as a solution to one particular problem.
---
Get tombstoned!!!
---
Is there more of that or is that it? 
---
I mean 99% of perks in the game are situational, if you're usually around people in chases then it's a good perk, that and it also speeds up other processes much faster (noticably healing and unhooking too, as well as hex clearing) so it's an amazing perk for that one too. 
---
There's no multiplicative bonus. (This was bugged in the PTB and it was possible to get a multiplicative bonus and they specifically stated that that was a bug. The perk should only cancel out the penalty.
---
Yeah same here and also waiting a long time to get into a lobby and having the killer quit out the lobby. Happened to me 5 times in a row smh.
---
Decisive Lagswitch
---
First killer: Trapper
---
First survivor: Dwight
---
The karma gods of DbD must like me, then, because I get nice Killers almost all the time.
---
You know what? Yeah. We're saying the same thing. My bad.
---
"Darn" Just impatient for improvements to existing elements in the game and trying to find rhyme or reason as to why we get new DLC often but not patches.
---
It's not like DbD's varied killers really matter much, the game is so unbalanced that once you're spotted you're fucked. it's just a matter of time.
---
Wreckers yard
---
Whats so bad about legion if i may ask.
---
How do you know he DCd because of the BPS?
---
I dunno. Teabagging doesn't buy me more mixtapes.
---
Nah they're gonna get dunked on by the community instead.
---
Probably be equally informative about the state of the game
---
She didn’t promote toxicity in game just because she’s a fog whisperer, toxicity been in this game since the beginning of SWF :) 
---
It's a solid cosmetic. Get it. Don't let other people ruin shit for you. If I did that I wouldn't play Legion at all.
---
All I saw was chad sliding around the ground with a shotgun, was that what you were talking about? a few points:
---
1. I've actually been seeing a similar bug in DbD lately myself. survivors will move around the map with their animations completly frozen.
---
2. Unlike DbD, where the result of this (relativly minor) bug/glitch can be humoros seeing chad slide around. in DbD this can cause the (albiet rare) issue of not knowing weather that survivor is going to drop a pallet. which can be slightly frustrating.
---
I wanted to love DbD, but the game grew more and more unbalanced and turned into a glorified mobile game with all it's microtransactions. To the point where it can be hard to tell a meg from a nea from a kate Etc. rather than actually try to vary the repetitive gameplay.
---
Also some of the game design decisions leads me to question the companies basic programing skills. Who makes a co-operative game and dosen't include fundamental basic aspects of co-operative play? (voice chat.) I don't buy their 'it's not a bug, it's a feature' they tried to peddle since launch. I just don't expect they know how to implement it into their game.
---
Then they release events that are so lopsided and messed up that they have to patch and re-work the event several times while it's still going (hello hallowed blight!) I wonder how their next event will be fucked up?
---
so yeah... DbD is a game that had alot of promise but fell apart and only succeded because it got released first.
---
I love playing Legion both as and against.  I have fun with Wraith, Pig and Freddy, but not as much as I do with the Legion.
---
Showgirls (1995)
---
Woah the stale meme squad
---
It's not. More accurately, it's two lows with a high in the middle. You start, and get dumpstered. Life is pain, as you are pathetically worthless. You can't hit anyone, ever, and you contemplate death. Then, you get gud. Your skill allows you to hit, and down, and kill, but the survivors still pose a challenge. Then you get to true power; there is no escape from you, a God of prediction. I got there, once. It was boring after the thrill wore off. Yeah, it was high skill, but high stress because of how fast you have to think. It takes a toll on the mind and spirit, over time, and it becomes a lot less fun once you've mastered her. It becomes a routine without challenge. That's when I quit DBD for a couple months, then went back as my old friend Wraith. 
---
He’s unfun to play against but they suck. On the tier list, he’s right above Freddy. It’s kind of a case similar to the doctor, not that great but annoying to fight against. They need to be reworked, which could take a year considering how long it’s taken BHVR to rework Freddy. Speaking of which, people who say legion is worse than Freddy are talking out of their ass. Freddy has his problems, legion has theirs. Just watch Bricky’s video(s) on Legion. 
---
I get about 2.5-3k a week. Levels and shards don't take that long.
---
**OSHA wants your location**
---
The exit gates was open literally a foot away. The friendly friend killer gloves come off at that point.
---
This isn't inaccurate 
---
Hope they say something related to the event :/
---
Her rampant toxicity, abuse of the ranking system, open mocking of players, and general attitude towards people in game is promoting toxicity BECAUSE she is printed by BHVR. While the community is toxic, it only gets worse by seeing someone doing it and getting praised and not punished.
---
... slippery meat gives you more tries. Deliverance guarantees success on the first try.
---
It's only use is going to be trying to kill yourself if you fail to activate deliverance before you get found. 
---
Doesn't change the fact that this dude was an obvious rank 20 noob who had ample time to grab you off the hook. Enjoy your victory I guess. 
---
You right I got 2 with bear traps and hooked other two lmao 
---
Mate that’s great for you, I made a comment about rank reset because it is perfectly reasonable that you could be talking about recent experience, which would include rank reset. I’m quite glad you have fiber optic and you’re a techno wizard but busted matchmaking doesn’t care about your connection, which is why I said restart your game as well. 
---
And yes, on pc, at rank one, you may experience a long queue time as a killer (there are a lot of killers at rank one because it’s so easy to pip, and pc has a much lower percentage of casual players in comparison to people that play all the time anyways) but that is quite different from there being too many killers across the board on pc. Like I said, restart your game, there are few people that consistently experience extremely long killer queue times with the exception of high ranking killers right after rank reset.
---
He's right y'know
---
I wouldn't hold my breath
---
Saying that BHVR endorsed a streamer does not mean that they condone their actions. BHVR endorses streamers who are popular and make enough to increase sales. It's clearly a marketing technique. Think about it logically, would you endorse someone who rakes you in a lot more money and consumer product? Of course, you would, whether you condone their choices or not. Money is money, my friend. 
---
I think he should at least be higher than doctor, then. I can kind of see why you put wraith so high (double windstorm add ons and you’re very fast and can bodyblock) 
---
Just stick to doing the generators little guy👍
---
The first survivor I leveled up was Ace. He seemed pretty cool and I like him. First killer I think was Wraith. Now here I am as a Kate/Freddy main. I need to go back and play those guys again. 
---
Then she shouldn’t be endorsed. Strip her of the status. She’s a petty individual that openly threatens her tie with BHVR to punish people on stream. As someone endorsing a person you innately take responsibility for their actions, especially inside the game you make. By not acting it’s condoning. 
---
Yes please. I hate being in high ranks because I’m not good at the game but because I’ve played for a while I’m supposed to be there. It’s fucking stupid and needs to be reworked. 
---
All I know is that I lost a tick rank and I gained about 3000 ish bp
---
Yeah my boy Fat Jesus is doesn’t work out. 
---
It's not just a texture, the blood actually has thickness so the all the model geometry would have to be remade.
---
Especially for killers as some skins have holes in them, some are shiny, and most have a drastically different geometry (just think of hillbilly's weapons: spade, shotgun, pickaxe, mallet, propain hammer...). It would be a mess having to overlay the prestige on all that.
---
I agree it would be cool on survivors tho. But it's certainly not as easy as overlaying textures.
---
Faced a Wraith that had sloppy butcher and anyone he hit would have that blood gush animation for the rest of the game lol.
---

---

---
that's OP. the last gen is always the hardest one to get and having a key that let's you bypass it would be whack.
---
Apparently a perk is a tactic
---
I know it's LF here, but Nurse needs NOED 3 to be 0.25% faster than survivors. Tier 1 won't cut it.
---
Nice even though there's like 1 or 2 grammar mistakes
---
Or...how about they let us see what your fellow survivors are going to throw in? And what items + addons they are taking?
---
Would be so much faster and a big QoL change.
---
i don't know if it inherently ruins the game, but it makes it a lot harder and more annoying. those are the guys that usually come at you with flashlights and go out of their way to mess with you. at the very least, they're bound to be more coordinated since they're linked up with voice chat.
---
ACTUALLY IT DOES HAVE AN EFFECT ON FREDDY. YOU DON'T EVEN NEED TO BE ASLEEP, JUST WITHIN HIS DREAM WORLD TERROR RADIUS.
---
HOWEVER BECAUSE OF THE 7-ISH SECOND TRANSITION THE BORROWED TIME EFFECT USUALLY WEARS OFF BEFORE HE CAN GET A HIT IN.
---
Maybe Resilience, Self Care, or Stake Out?
---
Resilience means you don't care if you're injured, Self-Care means you don't care if you get injured, and Stake Out for ignoring the Terror Radius.
---
This makes me annoyed when people post a meme for example «toxic survivor starterpack» and its pictures of DS, a flashlight and a P3 claudette.. when i play with p3 claudettes they are always in the cornfields

That first part with Jason and he turns around and see micheal always gets me. He gets startled lol

---
It’s not a joke. It’s a threat and it’s an abuse of power. She does have direct lines of communication and using those to harass people for just playing the game is just pathetic and needs ramifications 
---
I actually enjoy playing with swf because they want to save each other no matter what. They'll just keep rushing the hook over and over while I'm still standing right there 😂 but swf groups with microphones can be a pain. If I know I'm dealing with a swf group I like to make sure I'm playing a killer who can instadown, I find it a little more difficult with Legion. What kind of build are you usually running? 
---
Me and my friends are also going to hell for farming the shit out of each other.
---
Can you exactly tell me what she says in her own words or send me a clip from her stream that she’s threatening someone 
---
Nice, dead 'ard.
---
Like when hooked the entity Spawns faster or something.
---
Disconnecting is just a quicker suicide if we are going to say "just don't struggle" so I don't understand why you're a bitch if you dc but not one if you suicide on hook. I don't support dcing but that just doesn't make sense to me
---
If they didn't insert the in-game option to do it I'd guess they don't want you to.

I can't tell if you're being serious. No that's not what I was talking. The guy just trolls Jason for 10 minutes straight. Stands over him and emote dances. What happens in that video will never happen in DbD, the killer is actually strong in DbD.

Did you just watch 5 seconds of the video?

&gt; DbD is a game that had a lot of promise but fell apart and only succeeded because it got released first.

Again, can't tell if you're serious. DbD hit's 40,000 players every day on Steam. It's just a better game, that's why it is doing better. That's like saying Fortnite is more popular than PUBG because it was released first....oh shit it wasn't...it's just a better game.

It was more adressed to the mods just in case. :)
---
Community
---
RIP to consoles right. 
---
Despacito
---
I just mean the point was a bit irrelevant because it could be said about both sides. Similar to what you just said, wouldn't it be satisfying pipping or even escaping against a killer with the best perks and addons? If you like challenge then you would like hard killers as well.
---
&gt;	Nea is one of the survivors that’s great at long chases from the killer.
---
Just because of her inherent perks or what? 
---
Still tryin to learn everything I can so sorry if dumb question :’)
---
&gt; its quite obvious that the P3 Neas are the toxic jukers.
---
How dare you
---
brothers.. I have ascended 
---
I just have the basic  perks that come with legion and his blood web plus in or two  from the shrine. But remember me1, discordance3, unrelenting3 and bitter murmur 2
---
Internet chilvary guy here
---
They're lying to their consumers by saying that the shrine is completely random when clearly it's not.
---
I knew I sucked with him for a reason! This is my true calling!
---
XD bro you just said “yes she says that” but as a joke. Now you are over here telling me to provide you with time stamped evidence. You’ve admitted you’ve seen her do it. I’m not going to sit here and argue with a fanboy. She’s toxic and deserves sanctions. End of story.
---
Example A. 
---
Abuse sensitivity? Unless the killer is playing with a gamepad (which would most likely be willingly) then he could hit him easily. 360s arent easy to do, and even if they were, unless you do them perfectly youll get hit most of the time. They're a high risk, low-high reward tactic (high if it saves you from getting hit then you vault or use a pallet or something but low if you do it in an open field, you're gonna get hit anyway)
---
Depends on what you mean by ruin, they are almost always on voice chat so while you are chasing one survivor the rest know its safe to work on gens etc.
---
3 or 4 stack swf on comms is stronger than most killers so yes you are likely just outclassed. 
---
The meaning "Baby Killer" is a whole another one after seeing this ! HE IS SO TINY ! LOOK AT THIS TINY MYERS ! 
---
Lmao you’re mad sensitive then if you want someone banned for being toxic, yikes 
---
SB won't rewind all the time you spent walking
---
It's the best way to live/die, if I get stacks. death means nothing when the entity makes you come back every time 
---
Not dumb at all. 
---
And the answer is sure! 
---
I actually have no idea. But she always loops my ass hahaha
---
Go, my child. Enjoy! 
---
Yeah, it’s not fantastic, but it’s a nice thing to have if you see a SWF with four flashlights join your lobby (and don’t have Franklin’s Demise which is basically a far superior overwhelming presence lol.) 
---
I was just offering it as an option since it’s a perk they’d definitely have as the Doctor and they were asking about terror radius things
---
You need to formulate yourself in a different matter then
---
If everyone runs a Up the Ante and the purple statue, and slippery meat, your odds of a hook escape is 41% chance per try, and after 6 full tries the odds are a 97% chance to get off the hook.
---
Dont know why r you getting your idea is great
---
Man I guess
---
no
---
You should get that rank back once you return to the menu. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn’t but there’s no way BHVR can tell where the disconnect comes from when the killer bumps himself off
---
okay but then how is your point any more relevant? It's based on the assumption that all survivors will play killer in a mean way, when you could just as easily say killers will use DS or whatever when they play surv. Obviously not everyone does this and that's my only point. And I do think it's inherently somewhat satisfying to escape a killer with strong add ons and perks, but I was using an example from the killer's POV because that's what you brought up, never meant it wasn't satisfying to win as surv with lower tier perks.
---
I actually don't. Saying he did a good job on the timing of the pallet drops is not condensating in any way nor is saying this is my normal everyday game play when I play as survivor because I spend my time kiting the killer for the entire match until he gives up. Quit being so fucking sensitive to everything said on here and taking everything as some sort of attack when it isn't.
---
The problem isn't me, the problem is how you view everything.
---
THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WHO SEND HATE MAIL IN HIGHER RANKS ON PS4 IS TOO DAMN HIGH, STOP CALLING ME A NOOB BECAUSE I DIDN'T SAVE YOUR ASS FROM THE HOOK WHEN THE DOC WAS LITTERALY HUGGING YOU
---
Mfw I posted and asked for bots 2 updates ago and everyone replied that it would be completely useless,while over here they try to somewhat discuss,I'm a little jelous and slightly sad too op
---
Yeah ultra rare is 100% pink. 
---
If you're doing it by changing game files, yeah. There's a reason there's no option for it despite it being nearly a staple in games now.
---
Your monitor say it's red* It's supposed to be Pink but it appears red on some monitors with incorrect/bad color profiles.
---
That's me every time I'm on a generator and I pan the camera to see Myers right over my shoulder.
---
Because perma effects are permanent? Which ones do you suggest gain a timer and for how long?
---
You're paying doctor so...
---
That's what I keep telling myself when I see them in a lobby, but why does it have to be that 8/10th times they have to flashlight spam?
---
So it fits perfectly into DBD
---
Wel all know this was a lie. They said the same shit in a live stream too. No "small updates" were ever made leading up to the bullshit we got last month.
---
With the console optimization delay, I’m starting to think they really don’t care about console.
---
Killers vary in terror radius, speed, and height, which each provide unique advantages and disadvantages.
---
Or when you randomly see a generator out in public and have this urge to go over and start working on it🤷🏽‍♂️
---
The two people above me are cunts and deserve to be looped for 5 gens or camped/tunneled to death. &gt;.&gt;
---
I wonder if they will do it when dedicated servers come in? .....in the summer.........
---
It’s not in season anymore, Stop Farming 
---
I don't get it. Isn't Jason just a sorrow-plagued mother getting revenge for her dead child?
---
I had that happen as a survivor I was like “oh there’s the hex totem !” Then I saw the exposed icon and I was like “holy shit”
---
It's sad when the only way you can get happiness out of life is by bullying people who are new to the game. Just keep telling yourself that you're good at the game because you looped a rank 20 trapper for 5 minutes
---
Watch Angrypug on Twitch for a bit, then come back and tell me you're fucked once the killer spots you. 
---
Maybe just get better, idk. The game is actually very balanced, they released stats where survivors escape almost exactly 50% of the time on average. 
---
I guess it's because the bots weren't the main part of the post maybe? They were just there as an example of what could be part of the menu. All I want is filler bots so I can play a KYF with a bot just to test things tbh.
---
Sorry though :o(
---
The literal definition of professional player bud.
---
Literally what happens to me all the time. Gotta love survivors on console.
---
They don't and they should. Console always will have more players which means more income. Especially since we don't get half off sales in the console stores just because a new season started or the wind blew a different direction at the start of that particular weekend. No one on steam pays full price for anything unless it's a brand new release. Console has to foot 100% of the bill 100% of the time even if it's 80% off on steam.
---
No more easy to loop than the other 80% of the cast who isn't nurse or legion.
---
If they have tentacles around their icon and you don’t have an obsession perk, they have DS (most likely since nobody ever runs OoO or Sole Survivor). If you pick them up and they don’t wiggle, they most likely have DS. 
---
Something needs to happen. From just a purely playing for fun standpoint, leveling your dread gaze upon the remaining survivors with their now insurmountable task of completing five generators with only three survivors isn't fun for either side.
---
To say little of whipping up a loadout with rare and expensive add-ons and offerings only to have it largely go to waste because most times the survivors just give up, hoping that the game resolves quickly.
---
I don't know what the solution is. Do they move ragequitters to a different matchmaking pool? I don't think that's a great idea because queue times can be shitty enough as is. Huge BP rewards or item/addon/offering refunds? Maybe. Maybe give quitters a BP malus, make them go into BP debt for quitting.
---
Lol I can't help it. Hex totems are so juicy!!! Even when it's Spirit I gotta break it!!  I once had a Spirit use haunted grounds and Noed! 
---
It’s FPS - it freezes momentarily.
---
It isn't toxic to play a p3 claudette, but is very obviously looking to squeeze every tiny bit of advantage they can out of the game, even if it is at the expense of exploiting the game's lighting engine. Toxic is the wrong word for it, but it is definitely not playing gracefully.
---
It’s not my ms it’s my fps. It freezes momentarily.
---
Nah you just did your best to illustrate how to get a better offline kyf experience,good job you deserve more upvotes
---
I've had some good success with swf groups on Legion with ruin, haunted grounds, no one escapes death and mad grit. If you can manage to down someone, as long as you're running mad grit you don't have to worry about anyone body blocking during transport, which is nice. Ruin to slow them down and make them give away their location with the skill checks. Haunted grounds to hopefully nail them when they try to cleanse ruin. Noed for just in case at the end game. Maybe give a build like that a shot?
---
If that were true, why would it have been on the shrine once before, shortly after Leatherface came out?
---
I only say ggez if I get utterly creamed, but every so often is does make the killer mad instead of realizing it's a joke that I made because he got a 4k and we all had 5k points 
---
haha indeed!
---
I disagree. You should choose a killer that compliments your playstyle, either bolstering your strengths or making up for your bad spots.
---
Haha ty man. I spent way too long on it tbh
---
Is your hardware good? Bad connection can even cause stuttering fps. 
---
Oh no!
---
Cause after that they changed their mind?
---
I hate this tbh, before it seemed to be connectivity based but now I think it's just the load screen freezes that are becoming ever more frequent. Or the infinite load screen.
---
The music is intended to make it harder to hear everything else. It would absolutely be cheating to get rid of it. 
---
The Wraith is very versatile, has good addons (now) and in good hands he can be quite scary. Definetly underrated.
---
Mikey also took bullets and explosions like it was nothing so...
---
maybe he goes to the gym but only does crosstrainer on level 1 whilst snacking on some high calorie protein bars? idk
---
That is good for my dont play with swf make happy my day
---
Personally I think if you are running pig, its rather important to have something to help with gen kicking. As an useful tactic against pig is to 99% a gen while someone has a trap and keep doing this until they get it off. Then popping those gens quickly after. 
---
Overcharge is great, but Pop goes the Weasel is also very nice.
---
Next something to make skill checks harder, I would suggest Huntress's Lullaby or Unnerving if you don't have it.
---
Something for the end game, Bloodwarden, NOED, or Remember Me.
---
And lastly something to buff your game in general Monitor &amp; Abuse, Nurse's Calling, BBQ, Enduring, Brutal Strength, Make your choice, etc..
---
I'll try it out thanks!
---
that's because it's in their pants as they kill you, you're not looking in the right place
---
Yeah thats when i got it 😂
---
IT IS A FUCKING STRUGLE TO PLAY OBE FUCKING MATCH ON PS4. WHERE ARE THE FUCKING CROSSPLATAFORM? WHERE ARE THE INDICATORS OF THE FUCKING PLAYER POPULATION? WHERE ARE MY FUCKING SELF RESPECT? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
No one says that though lol 
---
Awww he looks like a babyyyy
---
I know it’s a joke. That’s why I tagged it with shitpost
---
LOL 
---
Makes it even more authentic 
---
They needed to update the engine first. If they would have fixed the framerate and updated the engine after that they would have had to start over from the beginning after the update. Pretty much every asset is incompatible with the new engine and it takes a lot of time to fix that (especially because they switched feom blueprint to C++ which is like writing a novel in french and then having to translate it into japanese without knowing any japanese whatsoever). A single patch won't be able to fix the game completely because every update WILL break the game to some extend. That always happens (like in Minecraft for example, every time they add new features the game breaks completely) and they're already working on the optimization pass (they have already adressed many issues in the PTB patch notes). People shouldn't complain about things like game development if they don't know anything about how hard the process actually is. They've hired so many new programmers to fix the game and to get the dedicated servers ready but the players keep complaining.

Taking it out of the entitys world is a little unfair. Wraith is powerless because the entity gave him the bell, Doctors ability is nonexistent because "The Entity has ignited a corrupted and inexhaustible spark" Legion, Hillbilly, Trapper, Huntress, Clown and Pig arent really who they are in the game because the entity is the one that made them super powerful (itd be more like Michael v Evan, not Michael v "The Trapper"), the spirit, nurse, and hag are dead. That basically leaves us with Freddy v Michael.
---
That would be even more powerful than the purple key.
---
I'd be fine with a BP bonus.
---
I do this every chance I can. I wish it were more common.
---
It blows my mind how I could be in a swf group and it takes 20min+. I could be in a group of 4 all rank 10 and it'll still take forever to find 1 killer. When we do find a killer they either face camp or DC immediately so we have to wait another 20min or more. Ps4 user btw
---
No point in playing vs it because it’s just a long boring chase you can’t win 
---
What ticks me off the most about the bbq shrine debacle is that the shrine doesn’t follow pseudo-randomness, which is what we see as “random” due to no discernible patterns forming, instead it opts for true randomness where patterns are capable of forming. Same deal with apple changing shuffle from true to pseudo as people kept complaining “it wasn’t random enough”. 
---
True but hatch is also OP especially when three survivors are in a match with 1 gen  left in the game....and still u can use a key and get out...i was just thinking a different way to use the green key ....just think of it as a red key - rare and not a lot of people use it but still is usable....just a thought..:/ 
---
Are you actually so obtuse you don’t see the difference? Unless you think DCing to prevent the killer from getting BBQ stacks/sacrifice points/etcetera is fine, which I don’t.
---
Neither is a good practice, of course, but DCing is the bitchier of the two.
---
Had a reverse moment, chased a prestige rank 3 david, lotsa running after him, finally down him, take him to hook they dc as im about to hook em. Like why? (For info they dc when im near a hook, not during the down or even the carry but the hook)
---
But it's annoying and random
---
Well would you look at that
---
I didn't see anything wrong with what you wrote. I wonder if people are sensitive about ruin as well. 
---
As a general philosophy, I try to only upvote and leave downvoting for spam or trolls. If I see something I disagree with, I'll upvote the opposing argument vs. downvoting the initial statement. 
---
Anyways, gave you a +1 to turn back the tide. Cheers
---
You can choose a killer that makes up for your bad spots or whatever (even though every killer is pretty much the same) but it doesn't stop me from looping you for 5 minutes straight. Doesn't matter what killer you pick (unless it's nurse or legion) a good survivor can loop you for the whole game and you can't do nothing.
---
I think the major factor for SWF teams is that you should assume any knowledge one has, they all have.
---
While this means you'll probably see more altruistic action in chases or hooking attempts as they swarm you, flashlight you, etc., this has a devastating effect on your hex totems.
---
I absolutely check steam profiles to verify against SWF teams before using hex/totem skills, or in general any strategy that relies on surprise.
---
I'd like that too, but most of the times I experience the following scenario: 
---
'Ay wanna blood party?'
---
rest of the chat: 'aaayy sure buddy'
---
-one bps appears as an offering, but not from the one who offered it in the first place- 
---
also, many matches with bps end surprisingly early with moris and camping, either as if the killer/survivor doesn't like more free bps or wants to be a meanie weenie.
---
And they are all pitiful excuses for humans. 
---
Survivors who want to play the game play the game. Whiny little children disconnect.
---
HA WELCOME TO MY REALM BEEEEEEETCH!
---
You guys are all wrong. Leatherface is a word 
---
DCing helps your teammates and hurts the killer more than suiciding. I don't like either of them but dcing would technically be the best choice for the team most of the time. I just don't understand how youre a bitch for only one of them, when they are both equally as bad. Dcing is better for your team and suiciding would only help the killer aka your current adversary, but thats the one that makes you a bitch for some reason?
---
You're a bitch for both or youre a bitch for neither.
---
My point inherently including both sides. Why play nice because survivors wont. That diesnt mean survivors should play nice and you could just as easily say survivors shouldn't play nice because killers won't. Both are true. If you play "nice" you're setting yourself up for disappointment because the other side most likely won't. Just play well and have fun, you don't need to go easy on people that are worse than you at the game, that's what rankings are for.
---
It wouldn't be that hard to link the apis to each other for matchmaking and partying up. Just would be very tedious. Gaming definitely needs a central hub.
---
Hi queen favor....can you not be on the Dev stream anymore. I'd really appreciate it
---
Yikes....so how did the match go? Did your team pull off a miracle escape? :)
---
Reeeeeeeeepost
---
Oh yeah I checked his comment/post history shortly after cuz I figured, everyone else i see on this sub, even when being negative is never usually that antagonistic, thanks anyway though &lt;/3 
---
Yeah I'll still chase and slug them but will let them all live. I even carry them to the exit haha. 
---
I'm good thanks tho 
---
Hey so how do unlockable perks work. My Claudette is level 33 I want self heal. When I reach the x level will it automatically unlock for other characters or will it be on the blood web and will it be tied to my version of Claudette’s or what 
---
I wasn't saying gen rushing is a bad thing. I'm saying by giving kindred that coop bonus, we encourage gen rushing/clearing totems while the killer is camping.
---
Blue haired Susie?
---
I don't get how this was ever a point of contention in the player base.
---
Pink _is_ a tint of red... The ultra rare color itself is I guess somewhere between "Rose" and pure red. The red/pink distinction isn't even that important, though I'd personally say it's closer to red than the traditional/official pink color.
---
Then don’t walk. Besides the first generator, you can use map awareness and perks such as Bond to know when you are safe and when you are not. Also resets every time you are hooked  so it’s the most reliable perk for escaping the scene, especially the basement

pretty sure 😳
---
If you want a better experience invest in a better machine. Stop resorting to childish expectations of developers to make gold out of shit, the shit being a console port of a game designed for very basic PC builds
---
Forcing people to play survivor just so they can play killer is just gonna result in a lot of people letting themselves die on the hook in the first minute. lol
---
hey, at least they used a bloody party streamer
---
Myers might not know how to do that, i was just answering a possible way for them to not fight in the dream. Also plenty of humans have gotten close enough to Freddy to pull him out, why not michael? 
---
With sloppy butcher?
---
Ah, right, forgot
---
&gt; supposed to be Pink
---
[citation needed]
---
positive!
---
Mildly curious what the killer’s name was if you remember. It reminds me a lot of a chase I had one time
---
I hate The Game so much...worst map
---
Can we not all agree to call iridescent. Coz thats what it is
---
If it was on xbox, it was probaly me
---
I by no means think he would win the fight ( I personally think nurse or spirit would) but surely you can’t deny there’s something not human in the hillbilly?
---
She doesn’t get mid, I put her in the section for somewhat supernatural. She definitely couldn’t beat any of the Thicc Boys
---
I'm just saying, especially in his theoretically weakened state, that wouldn't be a good idea for Myers to do.
---
If it's any consolation, I would agree that it's more red than standard-pink.
---
gotta love that over 40k bp per match
---
That chase sequence was awesome. Good job. 
---
Can't be decent past rank 15? How sad bud. As sad as the multiple "GG ez baby killer" SWF I face every other game. 
---
Nice Kobe!!
---
I play about 90%/10% killer/survivor.  I have to say, I've gone up against what survivor mains consider "toxic" killers and it is like, a fraction of what it's like to go up against toxic survivors.
---
Getting a pc that'll run dbd or most games don't cost 1500. It's not 2007. You can get a pre built that'll out perform any console for maybe 650 bucks. 
---
You're essentially asking to pay more money you baboon. You'll be forced to buy the original killer AND the skin cosmetic. you're a moron. This is a terrible idea for even more reasons. There is literally no reason to do this. It's a stupid idea. You're literally asking for knockoff versions of the killers we already have. Why would you want killers that are trying to be the original thing but aren't? Why do you think having the actual original killers is worse than having shitty imitations of those killers? Absolute idiot. What makes you think spending more money is beneficial to you?
---
What system do you play on? I'm a level 9 scrub and play on all platforms so just lemme know and we can play together.
---
There are two kinds of mains here; a main who literally only plays one side and never touches the other, and a main who prefers one side to the other but occasionally will switch. 
---
Bond is trash
---
Every leather face ever... 
---
Its a shame this game rewards camping so much...
---
Gang's man trick is the best example of this I think ? God send Vs 4 man Sabo squad and useless otherwise.
---
Agreed - if the survivors arent retarded/farming rescues then they should just gen rush and escape. Sucks for the hooked guy as theres literally nothing you can do but thats Dbd (in its current form)
---
Huh?
---
the same as they do on every platform. Once per month, on the 13th.
---
Pigs always either hook camp or box camp... makes for a rather dull game
---
Chancla OP, plz nerf
---
Prob cus u ruined their experience by slugging for 4k
---
Haha good first addition! Yeah in a game where you only sabo in teams or for daily's its fairly redundant 
---
Its because you play legion.. 
---
I once caught two people with Hallowed Ground and they both DC'ed, some people. I tried to let the other two know they could leave, but they kept running away from me, and I got bored.
---
That makes sense. I’ve never been in a lobby w someone who had a key, besides myself ofc lol
---
7? generally 2-3 days gives me 3-4k... only playing a dozen or so games in the evenings
---
Sole survivor, fire up, noed
---
Sometimes I hear my own heartbeat tbh
---
Hey, no mither is great! I've been using it a lot lately with resilience and this is not happening. VERY good combination against ruin, especially if you aren't that great with checks.
---
Sure you do down in one hit, but no mither has made me super stealthy. Also it's very satisfying when you escape. 
---
I know that, but the fact that they announced something that they clearly can't accomplish yet is idiotic. They could have kept it a secret, and then when they were actually ready to release it, announce it. Plus them not commenting or saying anything about it makes things worse. They raised players hopes and then crushed it, as they always do. I love this game, i really do but what they did is pretty sad.
---
The rank 20 killer mains are down voting :(
---
link?
---
Console players aren’t actually part of the community, they’re just there to hand over their cosmetics money while the state of the game on console is completely ignored. 
---
Good example of the hatchets hit box. throw hatchet in wrong direction, somehow still snipes player
---
If Michael were weakened, he would still most likely have the control to stay awake, seeing as Freddy can have trouble sleeping certain people, and Quentin proved there are cracks in dream world making it easier to leave. I think Michael has proved he has some impressive control over his body, and he doesn't fear Freddy. I think it would be possible for him to take down Freddy
---
Meanwhile, PS4 EU still doesn't have the Charity Case :(
---
I “main” killer, but in actuality I probably play 55/45 killer to survivor. 
---
Nope, you said that just now friend. What I'm saying is, don't except a company that has never made a game for console to be flawless. Ports are always inherently terrible unless time goes into the port, which wasn't the case for this game. Trust I've played so many terrible pc ports. *looks at dark souls 1 pc port*
---
Once you get to the level needed it’ll pop up as a teachable on that person’s bloodweb. Once you get the teachable perk, it’ll eventually show up on the other character’s bloodweb. 
---
Fear wasn't really a thing with Freddy up until FvJ, at any rate. 
---
I’m working on getting iron will right now, haven’t got adrenaline yet somehow, and deliverance I don’t know how to use properly(I’m probably just dumb)
---
I would say no mither, unbreakable, and unnerving presence. Both nm and unbreakable require a killer to slug you while u.p requires the survivor to stay on the gen or stay healing.
---
It’s the same for both sides as far as toxicity, what is annoying is killers coming on here bitching about “op survivors” and tea bagging when tea bagging isnt nearly as bad as face camping. That said survivors coming to cry here too is just gonna double the amount of useless whiny posts so don’t do it. 
---
Then what do you define as nice? There's nothing wrong with not using the best things in the game, and it's not setting yourself up for disappointment. Imagine if every survivor ran DS, Adrenaline, and Sprint burst, and every killer was a 3 blink mori nurse with noed and ruin. Would that be very fun? For any sane person that would be the most boring thing ever. Saying that the other side never plays nice is just plain unreasonable, unless if your idea of playing nice is something completely different than mine. Also ranks don't matter lol
---
Work on getting adrenaline, it's a life saver
---
i also would like to know 
---
&gt; You don't have to follow people if you have someone hooked, you can instead stand near them and bong away

But if you do that they'll think you're camping and let your audience perish. :(

Thanks but will it appear as a rank one and I keep upgrading it again? Or rank 3
---
i just thought i should share this because it was pretty funny/unlucky that i solo queued and somehow got teammates who put the same offering as me, just to be 4k’d by an ebony doctor 
---
I have the teachable but haven’t got it on Nea yet
---
You clearly don't understand that what you say sounds very cocky and shit. But by all means, blame everyone elses viewpoints in the matter instead.
---
My point is that you could have formulated you comment in a different matter so that you doesn't come off as a cocky person who is so much better. Cause that's how most people interpret it.
---
Lol. I guess we posted at about the same time. This gave me a chuckle too. 
---
Personally, I'd rather have Iron Will or Adrenaline anyway. That said, Deliverance works by you unhooking another survivor. Then when you are hooked (during the "attempt to escape" phase) you can just get off the hook. If you've already been hooked once and are in the "survive" phase, it's too late and Deliverance is useless. So if you're someone who gets hooked first, normally, then Deliverance is probably a wasted perk. If not, it can be useful. 
---
Great to see good survivor skills in action as well as zero toxicity.
---
I'd be happy to be outplayed by you any time.
---
&gt; Oh look, I only see the injured survivor who just got off the hook.
---
this happens to me so often when they get unhooked and ignore the fact that most killers will come back after the unhook notification (if theres nothing else going on). getting unhooked and self caring in the open in a situation like this just isnt a good idea. usually i'm not tunneling on purpose, but i'll take a free hook if its offered to me. for these bad survivor players it will look like tunneling, but idc.

All of this! 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 it seems like it’s gotten worse since the rank reset too.

Many of them think they're slick sneaking around. But survivors can actually see them coming from a mile away unless the gen is surrounded by walls.

Yeah they totally should cause its just such a pain for the survivors

They're mediocre cosmetics compared to the cosmetic store items now anyways. They were only good when we hardly had any cosmetics so I wouldn't worry too much. They're just recolours of basic cosmetics with some YouTuber / streamer logos on.

Don't get me wrong, some of them look nice. But there's no use waiting on them since cosmetic store has a lot better options.

Too bad it's not weird that shills like you are bending over backwards to defend them.

---
depends if you player killer or survior. if you play killer you need to get the leatherface DLC for BBQ&amp;Chili, its arguably the best perk for killers. As for survivors, its not as big of a deal, as most of the meta perks are all on the base characters. Otherwise, just get whoever youll have fun playing. Check some youtube videos and tier lists about the characters/perks and you can decide based off of that.

God forbid someone take pity on someone else and share the story. No, instead let's have *yet another* salt mine from a survivor who was denied hatch or something.
---
I once had 3 leave the match on me when I was survivor before the game. So it starts and it’s just me with 2 gens needed. I assume at this point that we will farm. The killer somehow comes right to my gen within 10 seconds of the game starting. He downs me. Let’s me wiggle out. I’m thinking cool. I complete the gen and then he immediately kills me and hooks me. Fun. 
---
I see your NOED but also your mercy. Thank you for not being shitty
---

This "rank means nothing" circlejerk is so fuckin' tiresome.
---
I play both sides and I hate survivors. As a killer alot of them flashlight spam, DC, or T bag.  Then as a survivor it's always the other survivors that screw me like if he's gonna camp me do gens, don't farm me.  Or they kill themselves on the hook so you have no time to do gens. Or they miss their DS so they DC and now we are playing down a player...  Like I'll get frustrated at the killer when he tunnels me but tbh he is the one that looses then because he wastes all this time on me and the other 3 get out.  IDK maybe its cause I only end up around rank 5-10 so the survivors aren't that good but whenever I lose I feel farmed by my teammates or sandbagged not like the killer out played me.

The thing about the game is that as a survivor if you are too good at looping and the killer never gets you then the game in considered an unfulfilling match for everyone and no one gets very much BP. The game is balanced around a more casual player base and not a competitive level. When you play at a competitive level against a casual less skilled killer you effectively cut the main flow of the game in which the killer interacts regularly with all 4 survivors. In doing this, nobody gets an excessive amount of BP because nobody acted as a “survivor” in the context of the game. (One person was running the whole match and the others literally played m1 simulator)

Worst thing you can do to a favorite game. Look up fan fiction. Unless your into that stuff reading about Huntress’s proposal to Meg is kinda uncomfortable.
---
If it's 'random' then getting one perk a few times and another never at all is entirely possible. If it were pseudo random you'd expect more equal results.
---
I’ll put three on here that I never run and people seem to love. Unbreakable, Dead Hard, and Deliverance. Yes they’re incredible perks when you need them. You just get to use them so little that it doesn’t matter. 
---
Deliverance:
---
Someone is going to save you before you struggle more often than not. If you’re getting camped it’s irrelevant anyway. You have to unhook someone first before it’s activated and often you don’t get that opportunity before you yourself are on the hook.
---
Unbreakable:
---
Yes we all agree getting slugged at the end of the game really sucks. But the amount of times this happens and you recover from the dying state to have it worth a perk slot are so slim. Recovering from the dying state isn’t like a guaranteed victory or anything either. So you’d need to recover and then go on to escape for it to truly be useful.
---
Dead Hard:
---
Against any good killer, it’s a one time use and all it does is buy you a few more seconds before you get downed. Not worth a perk slot at all. You use it once to buy a few seconds. Cool. Now any good killer knows you have it and will wait for you to use it before going in to hit you. Not worth a perk slot to buy an extra few seconds one time per match. 
---
He was at the start useless, then people found out you can use blood trails to make the timer go down and he became broken
---
Oh shit I didn’t even think of that! He’s a hulk in disguise
---
New killer. Latino Mom

You have NOED you’re not supposed to act like this
---
If you just started you're still in the 15-20 pool. Also it sounds as though you're playing on a cardboard box, so who knows what goes on with your matchmaking.
---
The problem with this meme is that you cannot use words to communicate the humor behind this meme - it is somewhat abstract, metaphysical, and touches some obscure branches of philosophy. Maybe one day we'll have the technology that will "transfer" thoughts directly to one another without the need to transcribe it.
---
For now, you can try to guess why this meme is funny by developing your own model based on studying the history of gang memes. You'll know when you've guessed right when you start laughing and you are literally dying.
---
Seriously, best killers in the game still run, let the redditards play though.
---
I have found that after a killer dodges your swf, you all need to restart your games otherwise you will wait in lobbies for an inordinate amount of time.
---
I never wait longer than 5 minutes for a swf lobby. While restarting the app every dodge is fucking annoying, it pales in comparison to lobby simulator 2019.
---
Probably host issues I suppose. Background programs? This game is poorly optimized but PC gets the better version 
---
It helps with the fact that I faced 4 SWF groups in a row.
---
I always play nea with the skirt and keys are invisible
---
If they destroyed all the dull totems, noed doesn’t activate. Especially swf, they probably got them all. 
---
Does this video get reposted a lot on this sub? I feel like it does.
---
I always face swf, at least 8/10 times and I know how much it sucks, but dont let the fire consume you 
---
...but...but charity!
---
That's what I meant.
---
Lets not punish those that DC, but those that DC constantly. Make a system that detects how many times you DC say in a span of 12 hours. If it's more than for example, 5, start issuing out the repercussions you've suggested. 
---
Keep in mind that some people's internet isn't  fantastic.
---
It's only like £1 might as well donate manually if you want to donate to charity ;) ik what you mean though. It's nice to get cosmetics whilst simultaneously giving to charity.
---
I'm trying, man. I'm really trying.
---
and too much to put it in a single meme
---
I run perk builds geared towards getting as many bloodpoints as possible. Bye bye small game hello prove thyself!
---
Rancor only gives a little blip on the hud. So it’s not very accurate for setting up a chase. It’s more of an information thing. Bitter murmur is great for finding and killing people. So it’s all preference if getting a guaranteed mori is worth it or not. 
---
You right, my receipt for this pre built is a huge lie 
---
Good lord, what story is there even left to tell after the Mrs. Voorhees dies?
---
It feels like that in the beginning, but at some point you will keep reaching the limit of 1 million blood points without even realizing it. Just hang in there. 
---
There are a lot of nuances that go into both sides, and playing one side can really make you blind to the other. I met a self-proclaimed survivor main with about 1k hours and clapped with Nurse. The person hasn't even made it to Rank 10 as killer, but they are going to accuse me of foul play.
---
Please take the time to understand the game before calling others out.
---
I think bitter murmur is better. I also think there needs to be contingencies for the mori. Sure at the end of the game you insta down the obsession, but I think you should have hooked them atleast once before you should be allowed to mori them. So if a survivor does great all game and survives they are punished without the killer needing to do anything.
---
First time?
---
Jason gets revenge, then keeps killing people for multiple movies in new locations. One is based in downtown Mannattan for example
---
I just want some proof bruv
---
Isnt that an sfm thing?
---
So because the Hatch is OP you want to add another escape? That makes actually zero sense.
---
Ok, I just googled it an apparently there is even one that takes place in outer space. What is wrong with the world?
---
Exactly lol. Jason X was the worst hands down
---
Cool but you still played against a rank 20 Billy.
---
If you look closely... you can see his hex totem
---
I use balanced landing every game, you just need to know how to play with it
---
I like seeing all auras for ten seconds after last gen is completed. Also if the gen jockey is running distortion he's going to lose tokens quicker.
---
Hmmm, I’m skeptical until I see photo evidence 
---
"rank means nothing" circlejerk exist because people still think otherwise which is just retarded
---
Lol it depends on the killer, there's no best generic perk build hahaha rank 10 I guess
---
He has bbq and chilli which is the best killer perk in the game at the moment 
---
Yeah. That part I can't control. I'm actually surprised at the ranks since most of my games today have been pretty balanced.
---
You should be complaining about the NOED "buff" they did. People didnt use to focus on totems as much as they do now. Now that nearly every killer is running NOED bc the tier 1 buff it is a high priority. Which has rendered NOED nearly useless. I never run it when I play killer and I always ensure all totems are done before I move into a new area.
---
What you're likely facing is people who deranked a ton. There's not much you can do about it in all honesty. What I would definitely recommend though is not running NOED. I understand that it helps out a ton with killers who dont have a strong early game, but if you start to pip because of it you'll be playing at a level where you'll just be getting stomped all game. Start saving up a ton of bloodpoints and watch some videos of other people playing trapper to learn some of the better trap spots and perks to run. Dont focus too much on getting kills if you arent the greatest. Focus on outsmarting people with your trap locations. Try to lead them into the traps you placed earlier. Start taking small steps into becoming an amazing trapper main. It may take a while but you'll definitely see progress. If you pip too quickly you're going to be thrown into games with people at a much higher skill set who will run you around all game, meme your traps, destroy all the totems (people will tend to do this once they start to see that the killer they're facing isnt that good as they'll expect the NOED), and fly through the gens.
---
Problem is that those are DLC perks, so you'd force some players to never be able to even possibly play at full competitiveness unless they cough up more money. You could do it for base game perks, however. Make it so Sprint Burst, Self Care, Nurses Calling, and Agitation will never show up in the shrine, and it'd be possible. 
---
I just play legion to switch genders.....I have no clue how they are good lol
---
Holy wall of text.
---
In short, just take it slow, dont rely too much on NOED to get your kills, start learning which perk/add on combinations work best for you, and make sure your trap placements are 10/10.
---
This implies he would be shitty had he not let her go. It’s not his fault her three teammates abandoned.

Would love to hang out with you someday. Would listen to your music all game long, living happily ever after. Your post made me chuckle. 
---
Yeah usually if multiple people (2 or more) don't load in or disconnect I'll let the Survivors do a few gens and find them the hatch. It's not fun for anyone to win/lose a war of attrition.
---
Can’t believe she really equipped iridescent head smh
---
Ok buddy
---
Correct. But it certainly wouldn’t have been fun at all for the survivor to try to complete two entire generators without detection thanks to their teammates being shitty. While that choice wasn’t the killer’s, they *do* have the choice about what they do about the situation after it presents itself. The killer chose to be merciful, and not shitty. That’s what I meant. Don’t twist my words around.
---
Claudette, Jake, Ace, New Killer, Jake variation
---
Why on earth would I go for a save and give a camper more points and potentially another kill?
---
Let's take a moment to appreciate how well they nailed his mask. 
---
Seems kinda useless though if they bring Iron Will, plus the killer ain't going to let you go back up due to knowing you got the perk.
---
Passive-agressive Wraith. *(Bing Bongs angrily.)*
---
Maybe I'll try that. Thank you!
---
I wish I was getting that one
---
When the Emblem system was introduced, it *was* harder to rank up. People cried on Reddit as is tradition and the devs acquiesced, now it's even worse than the old Bloodpoint-based system.
---
Meg\*
---
The rank colors are based on item colors and the rank is Red, but I still think the offering is Pink.
---
The reason people cried though is because it wasn’t balanced to both sides. Killers were ranking up faster than survivors and the matchmaking suffered tremendously for it. But they should have increased difficulty for killers instead of making it easier for survivors. 
---
I literally don't care what you think. What your delusional thoughts are and reality are so far separated it's pathetic.
---
Everyone.
---
Yea how often are you like, injured. Lmao. /s

Actually you can just swing through the pallet. Their swing will end as your pallet throw animation starts and you're not invulnerable anymore. If you keep running you dont have time to loop it again.

---
Damn that's tough. But if it works I'll keep doing it.
---
Big brain ace main
---
I can see it now. They would have 1 totem perk, an aura of any kind, and a healing or altruism perk.
---
You can also depip from only getting 1 sacrifice so, definitely not incentivized behavior
---
First survivor I leveled up was Meg because the very first time I played the game, I had a daily for her and I figured if I'm going to play her anyway might as well put points into her.  Then it turned into well, since I've already put points into her I might as well stick with it.  I got lucky because at that point I knew nothing of what perks were good or anything like that and meg has pretty good perks.
---
As far as killer goes I leveled them all up relatively evenly, mostly as I played them or as I got daily rituals for them.
---
I could hear the hatchet whoosh noise as it spins in my head while the shoe was midair.
---
Honestly a fact that’s forgotten is it’s the killers playground, your stuck in their with them and they can use you like a cheap Indonesian hooker until you get out that gate or hatch, tunnel, camp, NOED, moris. All part of their toys.
---
I like third seal ;-;
---
"OK Claudette has a tool box, David has a medkit, and Nea may or may not have a hand"
---
Personally I disagree I feel the whole point of it is not ever hooking them to counter decisive strike since they more likely to he obsession 
---
There is absolutely an animation, it's just that the animation gets overridden by the "recently hit and injured" animation.
---
Overcharge can synergize well with Freddy, because it incentives the survivors to wake up, but punishes them as much as huntress' lullaby. Unlike ruin and lullaby, it can't be cleansed.
---
Which turns it into a metaphor for how she sees the world as the survivors kee.......
---
Goddamn it man.
---
Very legal 
---
Sorry, but there are so many killers running NOED on PS4 now that survivors have learned that they have to be totem cleansing machines if they want to escape. 
---
I would really recommend learning to play without NOED. It may seem difficult in the short term, but in the long run you’ll become a much more effective killer. 
---
Thought you were gonna say the survivors knees.
---
A small regression vs. a 50% penalty to repair/healing. 
---
Thank you UgotGINGERFIED very cool
---
Thank you for this. I love it. 
---
That TrU3Ta1ent
---
Killer is always more popular during free weekend because A) New players want to try and B) good killers want to bully survivors
---
Yeah, I realized that from another response. I'm currently running brutal strength, bitter murmur, sloppy butcher, and NOED. Any ideas of what to replace NOED with? Or any good perk combinations?
---
Always buy the brown memes first, they're cheap!
---
It's unparalleled strength.
---
TrU3Ta1ent in the background 😂😂
---
Thanks for this build. I’ve been a Myers main for a bit and was looking for another killer to be relatively stealthy with. Also, the mind game potential with wraith is fascinating as he can move quick to body block their next move. I also love the great speed he gets while invisible to traverse the map quickly. There’s also some fun builds that allow you to be annoying with his bell and terror radius for when I just wanna play around as well lol
---
Probably the stupidest thing you could do to yourself. The only time Freddy is powerful is when people are in the dream world. You're better off using the Slow Game build on Freddy.

Just gave me an idea :3
---
I think that would be a good balance. I tend to play altruistically and hit totems. (when the killer has NOED it pays off lol) So it would fit my playstyle. I just always thought it was weird that there are perks for breaking hooks, doing gens, opening chests, helping others, but nothing for totems. Its the only side objective not touched by them.
