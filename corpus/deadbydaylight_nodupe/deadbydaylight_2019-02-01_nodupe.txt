&gt;Dead hard is the worst exhaustion perk
---

---
Have you forgotten balanced landing exists?
---
---
---
I personally don‚Äôt care what people do or why they DC, but if the game starts and there are 3 or less survivors in the lobby, I‚Äôll disconnect if I‚Äôm killer. I‚Äôd rather sit through another queue session rather than play a game where both sides don‚Äôt enjoy
---
Lol good one.
---
I'm sure they were livid.
---
you should bring your claudette to prestige 3 and wear those bloody clothes they literally make you invisible! for perks you should use dead hard and decisive strike and bond and always look for pallets, drop them and teabag the killer that‚Äôs a mindgame pro strat trust me 
---
HAH, I'm rank1, not that ranks matter since it's piss easy to get rank1 if you play enough and aren't utter garbage as I assume you are
---
I usually dribble the obsession to each hook if they don't struggle immediately on the first pickup. Many killers do. You can't really do anything to prevent it, but you can try "faking" Decisive Strike if you're the obsession and let the killer waste time dribbling you and filling your struggle meter. 
---
Just need a hooked survivor and you got it 
---
[deleted]
---
the ranking system is a joke
---
So the 15-20 games I was obsession without having unlocked was because I was using a perk I didn‚Äôt have unlocked?
---
So I can‚Äôt struggle unless I use DS?
---
Nope just bad rng 
---
I know I would be 
---
@ me next time hoe
---
I don't understand. You can struggle whenever you want, but sometimes when you're not using DS and you notice that you're the obsession, see if you can bait the killer to dribble you(wasting their time) by not struggling at first. 
---
I think my last 30 games 25-28 were NOED. Just random.
---
Its not registering any progress for me with coins. Do you know why? Ive played all day with 0 progress at all
---
Oof. 
---
I feel like every bonus bp offering is bullshit. 90% of the time you spend bp to lose bp like the offerings usually cost more than they earn
---
I just meant because the ‚ÄúA D wiggle‚Äù doesn‚Äôt show up when I run DS until I‚Äôve used it. But I can still wiggle even when it‚Äôs giving me the skill check?
---
Those toes üòÇ. I love it
---
Please post your event anecdotes in the [megathread](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/aljuze/megathread_the_moonrise_event_has_started_and_yet/), we're trying to reduce subreddit clutter. Thank you. 
---
They need to get the rights to the killers from You're Next. A lot of these concepts apply to them.
---
I think sprint burst and urban evasion are vastly underrated here.
---
I once spawned in a room in The Game as killer with a generator but no windows or doors. This was about 2 weeks ago, the survivors refused to leave after the gens were done, so I hard d/ced.
---
Man I cut myself on that edge
---
You can complain about DS and think noed is ok, both are crutch perks
---
Third time this joke was made. Wasn't funny the first time, definitely isn't funny now.
---
And.. I don't support noed. Lmao why did you even assume that. Crutch perks suck in general
---
‚ÄúI want to play a game. It‚Äôs called ‚Äòhide the salty sausage‚Äô...‚Äù
---
Yeh
---
E l o n g a t e t e d Dwight 
---
When you said you thought it was killer sided I thought you were joking. After reading your post and seeing that you were serious it‚Äôs even funnier. In no way is this event killer sided. It‚Äôs literally the most survivor friendly event we‚Äôve ever had. 
---
Together, but even when it's just me my times have been long.
---
This isn't an event thing cause we haven't played yet for that, it just is an every weekend thing.
---
It‚Äôs because everyone is playing survivor since it‚Äôs the easiest way to earn coins, not enough killers means longer queue times
---
Too bad they look like shit
---
That‚Äôs so weird. I‚Äôm on PS4 and we hardly communicate. People invite me to party chats and I just never accept them. I already have a group of friends (that I met by playing Overwatch) and I‚Äôm usually in a chat with them, but even then I don‚Äôt need random people directing me where to go and what to do. 
---
You‚Äôre probably tapping it way too fast and too much. You just have to tap it consistently, you don‚Äôt have to go crazy. Same with wiggling. 
---
They already got the 3k pipped easily and got nice bps.  They really have to insist on the sweaty 4k?  It's a massive waste of time and bps you lose in the game you could have played next
---
Of course but that's not how this game works. I personally believe that a large percentage of the community plays it just to troll. Whether it be the Killer or other Survivors. That's what a lot of people want to do. 
---
On a positive note, I do like how short it is so I can mori and quickly get back to chasing the other survivors.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeah, thus the Small Game. lol
---
Broken lanterns give you 3 points IF you can find one after hooking someone, before they get unhooked. Hooks give 2 points when you hook someone.
---
I'm just gonna keep hooking people.
---
Well damn I scrolled forever and didn't see one. My bad. but you're wrong, moth memes are always funny. 
---
That‚Äôs how dbd works
---
just don‚Äôt let them do gens bro!!
---
I'm not going to make an argument with someone that doesn't know what they're talking about.
---
I named a *very* specific group of players within very specific games. Either your reading comprehension is very poor or your skin is thinner than paper.
---
1 2 3 4 how many people gonna complain about queues on ps4 we know it sucks
---
Define Troll. To me trolling is like "messing around and not caring"
---
It‚Äôs probably the same player who spent the game urban evading around the outskirts of the map. It‚Äôs literally the survivors‚Äô job to make sure you don‚Äôt give the killer a 3 gen strat for endgame.
---
Cosmetic comes with free insidious!
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
 
---
I think there are less killers and more survivors as its easier to gain points as a survivor with the least amount effort. More survivors equals less killers which means less lobbies. Less lobbies mean longer waiting times and the longer you're waiting the more likely it is that you'll be shoved into the next available lobby and that could be someone a million miles away from you etc rather than a more local one. Like when you que for ages and then find out you were in a game with completely mismatched ranks. It's usually because that was the only lobby available at that time etc. 
---
This is my theory anyway. I could be wrong and the matchmaking could be even more screwed if they're testing their new system over the event. (Which would seem silly... But this is BHVR bless em). 
---
UwU indeed!
---
Well for the new lunar even you have to admit the fact is that playing as a survivor you earn event currency WAY faster, I'm talking 150% to 200% faster
---
Let's work it out like this, for survivors each gen repair is 4 points and if you get a lunar vessel you have a wooping 25 points (and you don't even have to be the one to escape with it or actually work on the gen) while as a killer you get 2 points for each book and a measly 3 for destroying a lunar vessel. You can already see what's gunna happen here. This is why the wait times are so fucked rn, no one wants to play killer and earn at half the rate of the survivors for what double the work of going try hard? 
---
Am I the only one that loves the Wraith's mori? It feels so genuinely wrathful, as he was holding himself all the time just for that.
---
Yep, first thing I ever tested when Doc got release,d never got changed, if it wasn't a thing then you could gen tap to avoid the overcharge skill check
---
I don‚Äôt have any friends
---
Every one say geneeeeeee!!!!! 
---
Legion players never clean themselves* 
---
Use "economy of time" if you prefer. The point is that the devs have a vested interest in keeping up an active community. To do that, they need to make sure that players constantly have something to work toward without feeling discouraged by an artificially high barrier to the next stage of progress. That's the "economy" - making sure players feel like they're always making progress without running out of uses for their bloodpoints.
---
This is why each killer needs to have a separate rank.
---
First time I saw it !
---
Whoa man your making sense uh we dont do that here you need to take that and move on down the road, sheesh this guy.
---
So you‚Äôre saying that it is and is not proxy camping to go after someone who is near the hook?
---
It‚Äôs not taking the system. Dribbling a survivor to avoid DS is counterplay, the same way cleansing all the totems to prevent NOED is cointerplay
---
I think the main problem is again that swf are at a huge advantage here. Just calling out how many totems have been cleansed is a big benefit as opposed to a solo surv who needs to check every totem himself. And no solo surv runs around the whole map to check all the totems and because you can't rely on your team doing totems there's no benefit in doing one or two totems yourself because noed will proc anyways 
---
You have some control over when the killer finds you and you have a lot more control of where you're going to get downed. You're the one leading the chase. If 60% of the map is in dribbling distance, run to a place where 40% isn't. 
---
Most campers I face are Wraith or Doctor. Doctor shocking anyone trying to unhook.. pretty sad. 
---
They spawn where hooks spawn. That's about the only tip there is for finding them.
---
But some of his suggestions seem like buffs to the perk, and some like nerfs. I'm wondering what purpose he's trying to serve. 
---
If you get downed because NOED, you're a bad survivor. Its so easy for survivors to rush 3 gens at the start of the game while one guy takes off the heat and gets hooked. By the time 2nd guy gets hooked, survivors ought to have finished all 5 gens if they are playing properly and not dicking around. Certain maps take so long for most killers to patrol and its impossible to keep organized SWF from completing the last gen(s). They just keep doing the gens while one gets chased.
---
Also more fireworks
---
Yeah, could you imagine sitting on a gen and getting caught with BBQ and Chili and go down despite being halfway across the map from the huntress, glad there‚Äôs no addons for that . . .
---
It's up to you, boss - if you're having trouble playing games with standard hardware, I find it's usually worth putting down a bit of money to make your gaming experience more comfortable.
---
Isn't the whole idea to escape with a vessel? And if so, me playing some level 5 character just for the event kind of makes that chance less likely because I have terrible perks right?
---
Participating includes offering the red envelope, which is why the devs give you incentive to offer them, like more point opportunities for coins and more bloodpoint opportunities. If I don't play an offering, everyone in the lobby suffers because that's one less vessel for the survivors, killer, and less bp oppurtunity for them because less chance theyll be able to hold a vessel,less chance the killer can break vessels, and I get no extra bp for gens done and getting vessels. This is bad design, they should've decreased the chance of them appearing or keep the chance of them appearing with a maximum of like 5 or 6 red envelopes per bloodweb, making the over abundance of event offerings less likely while still making them common enough for everyone to participate.
---
Also how do I save my bp for my main but have to spend bp on other survivors to make sure I get one? A problem with lower survivors is that there are less nodes, there's a chance you won't get any red envelopes (I thought it was guarenteed one envelope but it isnt, it's just one red envelope is what you can get at the most). I can't save bp for someone else if i have to spend it on another person. 
---
You still alive?
---
Because surv gain the event currency much faster than killers.. Kinda deja vu here except last event killers had horrendous queue times and not surv. 
---
To be honest, I don‚Äôt really care for it but there are many people out there that want it to be removed/reworked so I thought I would put out some ideas that I think are pretty good. There is 1 match that I will forever remember though that makes me hate NOED in one small part of my heart.
---
This happens so fuckin often, I think during the animation the hitbox dosent catch up to the model and your hitbox is left there extended though the window for a good half of a second, in this case I don't even know what the fuck to say his chainsaw just became telepathic and luarie finally felt her age from the last Halloween movie bc that bitch fell over like she needed life alert fr fr 
---
Cleansing totems is an intended feature the devs put in to counter killer abilities. Dribbling is something someone figured out they could do by abusing the drop survivor mechanic. The devs need to introduce a real way to counter DS instead of letting people game the system. Not to mention, killers can protect their totems, but survivors can‚Äôt do anything about getting dribbled. Even just letting you wiggle with DS would fix the issue
---
I think they're doing that for match making purposes killer queues were horrible in holloween
---
I mean yeah obviously I'm using BP offerings almost every single game. But so does just about everyone else
---
Its a huge mulligan. It stuns for so long that its easy to get across the entire map just by DS.
---
Realistically NOED also only lets you kill 'once' unless survivors are braindead and run at the killer with NOED.
---
Yeah im not too sure about that one either. The core problem to me is that you can't rely on random to do totems so no one does em.
---
OPs changes probably wouldn't change all too much about the general noed situation 
---
Lmao FR fr broooooo bug fixes MY ASS bruh I feel like every window is unsafe as a survivor fucking Freddy üòÇüòÇ
---
Not like I‚Äôm gonna play Feng or Ace anyway, time to just get the huntress outfit and call it a day 
---
How can I avoid SWFs if I can't dodge the lobby? Suggestions?
---
You see all this information we‚Äôve covered in this one comment thread? This is completely ridiculous to expect some random new player to figure out from playing the game, when the devs could just fix DS
---
Well this time there's only 3 outfits.. I'd rather have more outfits and choose the ones I like because I feel the lunar skins aren't nearly as nice as the last ones were 
---
You're getting very upset at me pointing out that DS is toxic and dribbling is not
---
Right?! Especially how buggy their hit boxes are atm. There‚Äôs no way they release something as unfun to verse as that. 
---
i disagree, the survivor skins are LEAGUES better than the survivor skins last year IMO. plus, i'd rather get all outfits than get some. 
---
Did she threaten to mori you before carrying you to a door, by chance?
---
Ayo behavior *yea?* IMMA NEED THOSE DEDICATED SERVERS ABOUT NOW CHIEF BECUASE IM SURE AS HELL THIS AINT IT 
---
God I was so happy when moth memes finally were a thing of the past. Pls don't bring em back. 
---
man in silly, going into a circlejerk thread expecting to have a discussion only to get downvote bombed and have le epic redditors laugh at me because they know im right.
---
Dwight‚Äôs thighs hit harder than a disrespectful step-daddy
---
I like idea 2 if your insta-down charges aren‚Äôt depleted by hitting injured survivors. 
---
so pretty much noed how it already is? ahaha
---
It‚Äôs not counterplay if the survivor can‚Äôt counter dribbling. Like cleansing totems. The killer counters survivors with a hex, survivors counter by cleansing totems, the killer counters by trapping/guarding totems, survivors counter by disarming/distracting, at which point you can‚Äôt counter anymore and it comes down to who is more skilled at the game. Now let‚Äôs look at dribbling. Survivor counters killer by running DS, killer counters by dribbling survivor to the hook. That‚Äôs it, there‚Äôs no more counterplay. You can say ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get downed by the hook but then they‚Äôll just use that to their advantage as well, they either hook you or draw out the DS and it still defeats the purpose of DS and works out great for the killer. There needs to be a solid concrete way for survivors to skillfully avoid dribbling beyond ‚Äúdon‚Äôt go down by hooks‚Äù which is along the same lines of ‚Äúdon‚Äôt get hooked three time‚Äù ‚Äúdon‚Äôt let survivors pop gens‚Äù etc, obviously you don‚Äôt want to get downed by a hook with or without DS as you have more chance to escape, but sometimes you just plain can‚Äôt get away from it in time, or a particularly brain dead teammate will body block you on a gen and prevent you from getting away

No he farted out of fear and woke up the neighborhood

please dont
---
No girls got shit on Katies booty, that girls pocket dance is tasty.
---
you still havent even replied to anything I said, just misinterpreted for what you wanna believe and then downvote bombed me lmao. using cringe unironically when you‚Äôre on reddit.
---
Btw asking a question here but is it intentional that killers can hit you through the fucking wall or did they fuck it up someway ?
---
Can you link this information? I don't see news of this patch on any official channel yet? Is it live?
---
Katies got it,  anyone who thinks anyone is hotter than kate is wrong. Only exception is wraith.
---
Or you can shoot a survivor and just kill them getting points in brutality and sacrifice but no points in altruism.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to add ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt need to the opposite end of the map for heals after getting unhooked‚Äù
---
You get worse players up around 20. In high ranks its a mix of toxicity being more common, occasional dummies, and skilled players. Its not really hard to get into it in the first place, it just feels like something you get when you play and dont think too much about it. I cant say I was disappointed since I knew there were no rewards, but I figured theyd have thrown some in by now. I dunno.
---
Latency. They technically could but you‚Äôd have to be on ridiculous ping. Like, 1500+ ping. They can however, hit you through a window if you‚Äôre on the other side and close to it if that‚Äôs what you mean.
---
Survivors don‚Äôt earn anything faster sitting in queue for 15+ minutes 
---
Cold steel the hedgehog
---
Rank = time played not skill in pretty much every game and especially this one 
---
Yeah, latency can be a real bitch. 
---
Alright then was wondering when wraith literally hit me through the window when I was standing there 
---
Hillbilly too.
---
3/4s if you have good eyes, my friend. 
---
To answer my own question, it is live on PC only.
---
lol this is so true, always screaming at the tv "get away from me bitch, I'm not going down with you."
---
The explosions always make me think I had a skillcheck fail at the last possible second
---
Obviously it's a window not a wall, the killer can still hit you through it. 
---
/s
---
You think of it as an exploit that the devs are too lazy to fix, but I think of it as something that adds depth and counter play to both killers and survivors. Saying that it should be changed because of "new players" is stupid because new players shouldn't be a reason why any mechanic gets reworked or removed. 
---
Should bodyblocking be removed because new survivors don't know how to bodyblock killers going to a hook? 
---
Should jumping in a locker against a blinking nurse get removed because bad nurses are too bad to play against it? 
---
I'm treating dribbling and counter play to dribbling the same of these tactics because they are all really obscure tactics that aren't picked up right away from new players, but are interesting and satisfying to pull off when done right. Honestly, I found it pretty common sense to run away from a hook when I'm getting downed with DS with 50ish hours, and I figured this out around the same time I figured out the more adept tactics like bodyblocking or locker dodging.
---
I think it's better than how it is now. Only issue is its still the same if 1 person is dead. They can down everyone. It would be good if one person was always exempt (except one person left I guess). I used to run NOED when I first started playing killer when I got the game. Then I started playing both killer and survivor and realized how annoying it is and removed it from my load out as killer. Last night I was playing a survivor game and I found the totem right as the last gen popped. The killer got 0 people the entire match. He found me and downed me when I had the totem at 99%. Someone rescued then got downed and he downed me off hook. He got another person who was going to help the person who saved me. Ends up downing all 4 people (it all happened by the totem so he wouldnt leave the area). One person kobed and escaped and three of us died. I hate the perk for situations like that. The person didnt deserve any kills because they played poorly and didnt down anyone. Then ended up with 3k from that. So if you always had one person exempt it would be a more interesting situation for those occurances. More of a chance for rescues/heals etc.
---
Perfect for a masquerade ball in Rapture.

I would say blocks but then again that takes still quite some while before you can hit them 
---
As a wraith main ive done this countless times. Surprisingly a lot of people don't realize you can hit through windows.

---
Reasons you're a shit survivor:

*using perks

*using items

*looping the killer
---
*throwing a pallet on the killer

*doing gens too fast
---
*doing 1 gen
---
*touching a gen at all
---
*destroying Hex totems
---
*destroying dull totems if the killer runs NOED

*you don't throw yourself at the killer when he camps the hook
---
*saving each other

*blinding with the flashlight
---
*finding the hatch
---
*escaping killers grasp
---
He prefers to be called, "Compact."  
---
to be completely fair, Freddy can actually do that in the movies
---
Doctor is best Farm Boi, I easily hit 60k+  BP with him and hit rank 10 by just waltzing around
---
Agreed
---
&gt; I still don't understand why it's called a 'Bloodpoint Economy
---
One of the devs, once said that double BP events damage the blood point economy. A few people on the Steam Forum pointed out that with Bloodweb Update 3.0, the grind has drastically increased.
---
The Devs noticed that Bloodweb 2.0 was **just too good.** So they had to edit the value of items, adjust the rarities of good items, ironically punishing P3 players by giving them more expensive stuff early in the web, making it impossible to cheapskate your way through like you could in Bloodweb 2.0
---
It's just a fancy, non-insulting way of the developers saying "We want you to grind for nothing". 
---
You definitely missed playing Legion, my friend. 
---
NOED is not toxic by virtue of being a hex perk that isn't even active most of the game and is next to useless on Leatherface, Billy, Myers, Huntress, Legion, and Nurse (assuming the player is skilled). DS is toxic because the only counterplay is to dribble to a nearby hook (Which isn't toxic, it's the smart move to make. If you say it's toxic, then kindly remember that you are running DS and sit down.), or to just eat the stun, which isn't a big deal if it's early in the game, but towards the end of the game, DS can secure a win even a loss is deserved. I know that you will say that NOED also can secure a win even when a loss is deserved, but the difference is that Survivor players tend to think that they are entitled to a win the moment the gates are powered, which they are not. NOED is literally one of the only things in the game that can make the endgame *not* be absolute hell for a Killer, and it's also a gamble as to whether or not you even get to the endgame in a match. NOED, Remember Me, and Rancor are the only three perks in the game that help in the endgame. If you mention Fire Up, then fuck off. I don't even like NOED, I've gone on the record as saying that multiple times. NOED is certainly annoying to go against at times, but don't act like it's overpowered or devoid of counterplay, because that statement is objectively wrong. If you want to deal with NOED, take off DS and put on Small Game. Boom, problem solved. 
---
And bringing the Survivor to the hatch
---
&gt;is joke
---
It literally is "tunnel the obsession" the perk
---
&gt; People comparing DS to NOED is just sad. You have to be good to get the best usage out of DS 
---
I legit fucking laughed. If it isn't obvious that this guy lives in fantasy land then I don't know what else proves it. 
---
People only want to play games they think they can win.
---
Dead Hard extends a loop and allows you to get greedy on loops. Sprint burst does not help on loops at all only makes you run to a different loop. Not really comparable. Sprint burst is for bad positioning Dead hard is for extending loops and cheating death.
---
And getting a feel for when someone is trying to screw you out of the only remaining objective with both exits open. 
---

---
Hopefully dedicated servers will fix this.
---
And you'll have killers complaining that once EZ hits are not not working.  Mark my words.
---
If someone‚Äôs body blocking you from a hook you just hit them out of the way, if someone jumps in a locker you can just pull them out of it or hit them as they‚Äôre coming out. Those things aren‚Äôt skilled plays they just add 0-2 seconds onto hitting the survivor. But I understand your point, I just disagree with it. I think that the counterplay in the game doesn‚Äôt match the counterplay of dribbling at all, and it throws off the fun of the game when I have to play it a completely different way only when I use one specific perk
---
It really do be like that sometimes
---
Yea medium are safer than fast lol dudes invincible while medium vaulting
---
Learn how to play doctor. Even if you lose you will get a lot of bloodpoints 
---
u/avn085 don‚Äôt do it I miss you
---
4 is better than both
---
Even with low ping players the problems still presist 
---
Especially if they‚Äôre sandbagging you. 
---
I haven't replied to your nonsense because it's pointless. You're set in your ways, everyone else is wrong.
---
Or you can just come to the terms with the fact that NOED rewards bad killers. 
---
The comment chain starts with me saying ‚Äúmore like face camping, proxy camping and getting mad at looping survivors‚Äù
---
The term ‚Äúproxy camping‚Äù then gets quoted by pickbro and he says ‚Äúmore like knowing someone is at the hook and you‚Äôre looking for them‚Äù
---
Thats not what proxy camping means at all, so then I tell him what proxy camping means ‚Äústaying at the hook even though survivors are at generators and letting the rest escape‚Äù
---
which gets some dude who obviously does not like me for whatever reason, probably a teenager who is taking reddit a bit too seriously whatever. he then completely misinterprets what i said and starts flaming me ‚ÄúLMAO IDIOT SO IF YOU KNOW SOMEONE IS AT THE HOOK YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE THE HOOK? THIS THREAD IS ABOUT YOU HAHA!!!‚Äù
---
I flame him back and let him know that thats not even remotely close to what I said, he just imagined I said that to keep the circlejerk going and here we are now. 
---
No wonder no one goes on here. Its all the same 3 memes reposted over and over again (been chasibg people in their dreams so long i forgot to chase my own!!!), killers complaining about SWF and DS, survivors complaining about NOED and campers - no actual discussion is posted here. its just one big circlejerk. when the mods try to do something to fix the sub quality people get upset and post EPIC SMOL BILLY memes. DBD subreddit in a nutshell.
---
Sure, I understand lobby dodging in general - lobby dodging SWF groups or a team of 4 survivors with toolboxes. This seems to be a widespread issue though, and I've never had literally 90% of my lobbies dodged before.
---
I saw a pig do this with me yesterday.  any chance you were pretending to do gens too?  I was laurie crouching towards the exit gate with the pig and then threw a firework in her face üò±
---
*tfw someone ignores everything I said about NOED's counterplay and still calls it a crutch perk* 
---
At least you learned what proxy camping means. Its not when people run at the hook trying to get farm points and the killer stays there defending it. Its when everyone is on generators and the killer hovers around the hook waiting for someone dumb enough to go for a save. its not that hard to understand.
---
I actually like the huntress skin and I think her weapon looks amazing. If you play survivor, you can rack up coins pretty quickly. I wish there was more incentive for killers though.
---
The cosmetics are lame too. I bp capped a week ago, got back to 100% achieves, unlocked the new teachables and maxed them on my mains, and leveled up new dlc go lvl 50and am all set for the next dlc. If this event seemed cool or had decent rewards, id have a reason to jump back in.
---
But it doesnt.
---
And the negative backlash ive been seeing, plus reports of awful queue time dont make me any more eager to try the event.
---
Haha. 
---
dam meg running all over the place. You could of just died and leave me alone!
---
I love how you have to type what I said in all caps and add exclamation marks to it and constantly change what you said because you know you're wrong.
---
That really is why im not playing the event as i want to, i already have my favorite huntress skin (the blight huntress), and i dont play survivor enough to warrent bothering to get coins. The skin is nice though.
---
Maybe my solo survivor experience is different but almost no one is doing generators. They are crouching around the map hiding with a lantern waiting for everyone to die for hatch to spawn. I‚Äôve never seen so many people run Sole Survivor in my life. Survivors get points when they actually do well and get gens done, but killers also get points when they play well and hook alot of people so I dont get it.
---
Arent bloodpoints capped at a million?
---
BL landing has the potential to be better but is very map reliant. If I see a surv watching me on a hill, they are waiting for me to come up so they can BL away wasting precious seconds that are needed at higher ranks. I just avoid that at this point.
---
The only thing learned is you are in fact an idiot, with a lot of time on your hands.
---
I'm not even getting Bags or Setting Hardware. Just Common Add-Ons like Sacks and Gloves. 
---
Your bloodwebs spawn rarer items more consistently upon each prestige level especially purple and pink addons.  I've had prestiges where I have great perks by 50 and I've had some where they suck.  Also Iron Grasp sucks man waste of a slot.  With the hook spawn rework many months ago you'll always make a hook.  Much better perks in game to put in that slot
---
Yes, they are. I'm one of the people who was refunded lots of bloodpoints due to my save file being corrupted/reset back in like October 2017.
---
I total empathize with the unfun aspect of having to play differently to counter, but I still lean it towards being a fair mechanic and good for the game because it really doesn't happen all that much. As a survivor, I maybe get dribbled 15% of the time and a fraction of those times, the killer will mess up and I'll may just be able to wiggle out without having to use DS. Even if I'm not able to DS, there's still a chance for a teammate to bodyblock or flashlight because dribbling is near impossible to accomplish with another survivors around.
---
I would agree with you and say it's a unhealthy mechanic if there were no counterplay or if successful dribbling was an every game issue, but it's no where near that in my experience. As a killer I only get the opportunity dribble surivors maybe 1/5 of my games (and this is me actively trying to down obsessions close to a hook). Where as in my survivor games, I very rarely get successfully dribbled. 
---
That robs them of points but okay
---
How about making Decisive cause Broken status for 60 seconds and NOED similar to Haunted Grounds but once activated it only stays active for 60 seconds? 
---
Death Note  Shinigami killer please.
---
### 
---
huh
---
it is supposed to increase luck, but sometimes stuff like that just happens. While being P2 on Pig, I had the worst luck. Only near never 30 for her at P3, and I have better everything by a landslide
---
"Proxy camping" is a term that I have never once head in my entire life before this moment. I'm willing to bet that most people haven't either. You act like BBQ is a default on every Killer, and that anyone, ever, in the history of Dead By Daylight, has hooked someone, seen three auras across the map, and decided to stay put. If that is the definition of proxy camping, then no one ever does it and you are complaining about NOTHING, in which case people are right to call you out on your bullshit. Everyone else here is saying that you are wrong. You are the only person saying that you are right. What's more likely, you just so happened to be wrong, or like three or four other people all just so happened to be wrong? 
---
New to the game here , wdym dribble too many times, if ur the obsession can't the killer dribble infinitly bc u have no wiggle bar ?
---
I also remembered your name because it was only a day ago. And your brand of stupidity is not easily forgettable. 
---
Pretty wack that they didn't slap 1.5x bloodpoints on for event
---
Imagine reading this 
---
&gt;aka not knowing how to apply pressure other than hooking someone and letting all the generators get done while that one guy dies.
---
and thinking I said this 
---
&gt;if a killer knows someone is nearby the hook, just walk away and let them save him?
---
Doesnt even make sense. Literally in my comment I said ‚Äúletting all generators get done while that one guy dies‚Äù. Reading comprehension is hard for reddit killers I guess.
---
Ah see that‚Äôs where our disagreement is stemming from, because I am getting dribbled every game. The way you described I completely agree, it‚Äôs a little annoying but it‚Äôs no big deal, but for me it happens every game unless the killer is an idiot. I actually get so excited the 1/15 games I actually don‚Äôt get dribbled that I mess up the skill check because I‚Äôm assuming I‚Äôm gonna get dribbled. Of course I‚Äôm also always the obsession even when not running DS so maybe I‚Äôm just getting matched with killers that are better than me, or survivors worse than me (if that‚Äôs even possible)
---
Hitbox machine broke.
---
Git gud baby killer
---
Hey white knighting won't get you laid. Its okay to like a womens body okay buddy
---
Hmm... probably! But i can't think of anything specific at the moment. My biggest issue is just trying to get better at being chased.  
---
Been away awhile how do get?
---
I saw someone on here criticize killers for 'patrolling' 
---
He's right though. 
---
In the event, a "perfect" survivor match is powering all gens (+4 each) and escaping with a Vessel (+25 for that). (4 x 5) + 25. That will get you 45 points.          
---
A "perfect" killer match is getting as many hooks as possible (+2 for one hook, survivors can get hooked three times each) and destroying the vessels (+3 for a vessel, there are two by default). (2 x 12) + (3 x 2). That's a max of 30 points if you *absolutely optimize* the amount of hooks you can get.
---
Just do the math. 
---
15% does not counter the gate taking 250% it‚Äôs normal time to open
---
&gt;‚ÄùProxy camping" is a term that I have never once head in my entire life before this moment. I'm willing to bet that most people haven't either. 
---
So why are you commenting on something you dont know? And I told you what it meant.
---
&gt;You act like BBQ is a default on every Killer, and that anyone, ever, in the history of Dead By Daylight, has hooked someone, seen three auras across the map, and decided to stay put. 
---
This is literally what the term camping means....
---
&gt;If that is the definition of proxy camping, then no one ever does it and you are complaining about NOTHING, in which case people are right to call you out on your bullshit. 
---
Except it happens, thats why people complain about it. Also, complaining about nothing huh? This thread is literally complaining about nothing. Almost no survivor says you‚Äôre a bad killer for ‚Äúusing your power‚Äù. The entire thread was made to circlejerk about muh toxic survivors being big meanies.
---
&gt;Everyone else here is saying that you are wrong. You are the only person saying that you are right. What's more likely, you just so happened to be wrong, or like three or four other people all just so happened to be wrong? 
---
Amazing logic bro. Just because more people believe one thing doesnt mean its right. 
---
Yes
---
It's literally like 1-2 seconds of carry time maxed out, really underwhelming
---
Tastes vary but I've learned quite a bit from HybridPanda, Monto and Ardetha.
---
They tend to be a bit killer focused but you can still learn from survivor side.
---
Maybe they just want to play the game and don't care about farming
---
Whatever you say bud
---
Yeah, but, seriously, I just hoped at the very least my allies would stop being made up with suicidal morons being among the selection.
---
He compared perfect gameplay to camping the hatch. Getting perfect gameplay is in the killers hand for the most part while it isnt for solo survivors.
---
You get event points for gens/hooks, but not a bp boost as far as I know.
---
They really need to remove perk tiers, period. Very few perks are actually useful outside of a particular tier (usually 3 but sometimes 1, in the case of perks like Discordance), and half the time I feel like I'm not even making progress because I have no desire to use a tier-1 perk because its effects are just too lackluster.
---
Lol so funny ... rumors ... pedo ...  Anyway, thanks for the info.
---
This gets posted all the time.
---
I was the victim of a Rancor obsession earlier and I knew about it but I kinda just shrugged it off and after I popped the last gen I was running the killer around thinking about saving the guy they had slugged up but then saw the exposed effect. I literally had a mini heart attack. Luckily I lost them and managed to escape, but the other guy got killed.
---
Both killers and survivors have to deal with the shitty console performance. 
---
This part just happens to negatively impact killers. The lag when you get hit impacts survivors a lot. 
---
Event farming with friends, if a killer doesn‚Äôt see their survivor friend in their lobby they redo it and hope they match in the next one, rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah, it's honestly like night and day. A competent SWF that's actually trying is damned near unbeatable.
---
I've long maintained that if there were a perk that did what SWF does (near-perfect knowledge of where the killer, gens, hatch, other survivors, etc. were, plus the ability to coordinate perks, roles, add-ons, etc. far in advance) there'd be absolutely no debate that it was overpowered.
---
I understand why SWF is necessary, but I wish people wouldn't pretend that it doesn't outright break the game.
---
Queue took up so fucking long the Game put me in a lobby with 1200 Ping. Twice. So I gave up and played the Game.
---
Pretty sure McD has better Wifi than that.
---
Delet this 
---
Don't hold games hostages, but you should also know that a game has to *end* before the end of an event for it to apply.  I started a game in the final minutes of a double bloodpoints event, and the game ended after the event ended.  Didn't get double bloodpoints.
---
I finally heard it the other night and y'all be exaggerating
---
Reee toxic tbaggers op. 
---
But for real infinite pallet loops don‚Äôt exist, just lunge through it and you‚Äôll probably hit them anyways 
---
I can see why.
---
You forget to mention that the other problem with DS (that for some reason Survivor Mains never bring up, gee I wonder why) is that it forces Killers to go after non-Obsession Survivors. So basically, if you choose not to use DS in a game and the Killer comes across you and the Obsession then guess who is getting chased? 
---
But apparently, for whatever reason, they're fine with it or most likely they neglect to mention this fact. It's part of this false narrative Survivor Mains keep perpetuating:
---
DS is hard to use. It isn't.
---
DS has drawbacks. It doesn't.
---
DS can be countered. Not really, unless you use Clown with Enduring but that's Obsession only and they cannot be anywhere near a pallet or window. 
---
DS is fair. It isn't. The devs said as much in a livestream. 
---
Meanwhile, most Killers are fine with NOED being taken outback... So long as DS gets the same treatment. 
---
Exactly
---
When's the last time survivors had a nerf of any kind? Borrowed Time is the only nerf that has actually mattered to survivors, and that was many months ago. When killers get nerfed, we try to protest the decision but get told to fucking kill ourselves by you petty survivor mains.
---
Survivors get nerfed, and you threaten to kill the developers, blackout, review bomb or dox the game. Or all the above!
---
Seriously, name the most recent survivor nerf. I'll wait.
---
????
---
I'm still waiting for any survivor to be able to wear any other survivor's clothes.
---
Hey shouldnt have made the even require us to survive and do gens. If we want our points we gotta gen rush and live with the dumb lamps. I hate these events because they just push the playerbase further apart
---
Scares the absolute shit out of me everytime.
---
Speaking of issues on console, downed a Dwight yesterday as he was hoping through a window an as he hit the ground he just disappeared, like not just invisible, straight gone.
---
I cld hear him wimpering on the ground but couldn't see him or pick him up. 
---
Left him there to bleed out lol
---
none.
---
Fulltime-Mains on both sides are toxic af
---
Big facts 
---
A meme goddessüò©
---
When I read the patch notes my heart sunk. It was a BUG that when you help people escape with the lantern that you get no points? Are you kidding me? I literally took back my criticism when I found out if anyone escapes with it we all get rewarded, then found out it was a bug. Hell, even if they tone down the numbers a bit but divide it out it would be good.
---
Ah okay I see, my bad üòÖ Thank you for telling me!
---
[removed]
---
Doubt dedicated servers will fix anything honestly.
---
You must not understand how windows work if you didn‚Äôt turn you wouldn‚Äôt have gotten hit
---
I got had the same decision and I chose Spirit, mostly because she is a stronger killer and overall more fun (imo).
---
This should be a Mori animation.
---
Survivor shoots killer
---
Killer 'dies'
---
Survivor goes over and starts teabagging the 'corpse'
---
SURPRISE!!!!!
---
Underrated quote
---
Yeah you can, someone asked the same question about the hallowed blight with the doctor skin.
---
Finally, the Freddy lore-accurate buff we needed.
---
Isn‚Äôt she also harder though? Im still kinda new as a killer, my only other killer is a pig at level 40
---
I‚Äôm colorblind 
---
Some people are just thirsty I guess.  I was playing SWF and got a friend request after finding a lobby.  The person had a feminine name and an avatar of a drawing of a girl.  I accepted, and they messaged me saying they were the killer and they were just gonna do their daily ritual and then farm points without killing.  None of my other friends accepted, so I thought it'd be funny if I didn't tell them until the end.  At the end of the game I told them, and one of my friends then immediately started asking the killer if they were a girl and if they were hot and wanted to play with us and stuff.  Was really weird
---
DAMNIT beat me to it
---
Then please. *Enlighten* me with your psychology degree and multiple studies how on depression can be dumbed down to "big sad."
---
Standard survivor main attitude.
---
Yeah there are 2 perks, Left Behind, and No One Left Behind.
---
do it in kyf.
---
Stuff like this doesnt belong in normal games
---
you just said you will take the lamp if you see it but as killer you dont have time to look for a red lamp somewhere on the map. you have to pressure the survivors. The event takes no time at all to do its literally how many points most people complain about
---
Cry about it.
---
CAN'T TAKE BACK THE HOOK THAT I GAVE YOU
---
You sir, are a good man. Thank you for this.
---
We all have to learn somewhere. 
---
Survivors can't lagswitch since killer is host but okay
---
The only killers I've seen breaking them are legions and Myers :/
---
You forgot sticking by the hook because survivors are nearby and if you leave in two seconds the survivor you hooked will be unhooked.
---
Heck
---
You can‚Äôt be a friendly survivor. You can only have friendly killers.
---
Broken status effect will prevent the DS user from healing for a certain length of time so at least they dont get back to full health with an insta straight away.. i dunno just throwing out ideas as both perks are prob never gonna be removed, just changed. I don't use either perk anyways.. 
---
yeah of course. but boil over OP, iron grasp hard counters it :)
---
And here I thought it was a Survivor buff!
---
Whoa that's a weird way to spell Meg....is it foreign?
---
I have 6 coins, got em all as Survivor, even with shitty queue times.
---
Survivors can‚Äôt lagswitch to begin with. 
---
Are you thick?
---
Perfect Killer Game : 30 points
---
Doing 2 gens and camping hatch: 31 points
---
MATH IS HARD
---
\*Legion praises the entity\*
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and I like NOED because it‚Äôs the real challenge and it makes me say ‚Äúoh shit we‚Äôre fucked‚Äù. That‚Äôs the real adrenaline rush tbh
---
Yea My ass in dumb fat
---
Fo sho. First movie didn‚Äôt have many memorable lines.
---
Everything will always be overshadowed by ‚ÄúWelcome to primetime, bitch!‚Äù
---
Lmao, yes it does? Wake Up makes the doors open faster, it literally counteracts what Remember Me does, which is to make the doors go slower. Plus, nobody said anything about Wake Up being something that flat out cancels Remember Me. Survivor perks aren't supposed to be as powerful as killer perks, anyway (obvious tweaks still need to be had, of course).
---
Delete this before I delete your kneecaps
---
Sort of.
---
Wraiths are one of two extremes; either they're toxic assholes (camp, tunnel, disconnect when things don't go their way, use NOED to ensure more kills because Survivors can genrush Campers, and otherwise act like jerks because they can), or they're the most friendly and decent Killers in the game (always switch targets, make sure never to hook the same person twice in a row, and always let the last Survivor have the Hatch).
---
It's probably because Wraith used to be so bad (almost a quarter of his add-ons existed solely to negate the crippling penalty of Lightburn), only those two extremes would keep playing him.

That BT nerf was more of a buff. Killers cannot see you mending with NC.

I think your right, especially in post game chat. 
---
Yeah as someone who just started playing the game about a week ago, not having any teachables really sucks. That and having only 1 perk slot for every killed/survivor I haven‚Äôt leveled.

You play pc games with a gopro on your head?

---
Baby killer so bad he can't even kill himself. UNINSTALL!
---
Also if you're getting chased, try and avoid generators where possible. Lost a game yesterday where we were fixing the last gen relatively close to the exit gate. Chasee McGee decides to run right up to us and Billy managed to chainsaw the two of us that were at the gen.
---
It's remake Freddy he's not cool enough to do that :(
---
Excuse me 
---
I only use iron grasp early in the levels BUT it does help me carry people into the basement which snowballs into a 4k usually
---
Oh really? So getting buried on Twitter and deleting your account wasn't enough, huh? Do you need to get exposed on Reddit, too? I still have a lot of screenshots. Keep talking shit about me places and I will not hesitate to post all of my proof on Reddit, too.   
---
Also, keep lying about what I said. I never once said Rank 1s are toxic. That's just more of YOUR lies to make you look "good". Last warning, stop talking about me. 
---
Ohhh oops, sorry, I see what you meant now. As cool as that would be, that isn‚Äôt possible lmfaoooo.
---
COMMENT THEN
---
Dracula could be cool. 
---
What are people using for speculating? I heard there's a teaser image?
---
I think it was a Noob3 video where Billy chainsaw hit from the top swamp boat to the survivor half way to the bottom. Idk what BHVR is doing tbh. Totem spawns feel worse too and hook spawns feel dumb too still.
---
Pretty sure Billy is meant to work like that, at least he has since before the update 
---
You‚Äôre right that it doesn‚Äôt flat out cancel it, but wake up reduces the timer from 50 seconds to 43.47, which is hardly a counter at all. It‚Äôs the only perk that speeds up the process but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a counter.
---
I don't know but it's what I saw in a thread the other day it was a comment somebody posted but OP deleted their own thread.
---
*gets stabbed by Myers from across the map*
---
Delete that comment before I delete this post
---
alright! :&gt; I didn't participate much in the past events, so this current one is the first more manageable for me
---
Ok. Any chance you know where to see the image?
---
I literally don't care how many times anything scary movie related is reposted, I love it everytime lmfao
---
It could slow the killer down to a walking pace, something like terminator, where the killer barely reacts. 
---
Don't sandbag.
---
Yeah, why is it so loud? Also great meme, saw it right after playing on Haddonfield too. 
---
I‚Äôd agree to delete DS just so NOED wouldn‚Äôt give a huge speed boost tbh. 
---
Since the last update that's like 90% of my Dead Hards... I don't know how, but something fucked it up BIG time.
---
*Heavy breathing intensifies*
---
nothing wrong with critizing the event for how shitty it is. but people are complaining about how difficult it is to get points or whatever even though it‚Äôs super easy if you just play the game
---
awwww is the crybaby killer main salty? get over it and learn to counterplay it's what this entire game is about, countering what the other side throws at you for the sake of winning. I'm sick of god awful crybaby killer complaining about DS when you can just learn to play against it. I mean it's not like this is a new problem, DS has been in the game for awhile and as much effort as people put into bitching about it you could suck it up and learn to counter it.
---
Fixed your comment for you ;)
---
Ahh ok, I was thinking maybe they had gotten rid of the cap somewhere in these recent patches and I missed it.

that‚Äôs a bug lol and it‚Äôs been patched
---
‚ÄúI get carried every game lol bro NOED isnt a big deal‚Äù cool story bro
---
yes, technically
---
Never happened, could it? Not likely as the survivors have paid cosmetics and phasing one out and into a killer would amount to wasted money by the player. But it is a great bit or lore.
---
P.S. the running joke is that Nea is actually a killer.
---
It be like that
---
I feel like this i r/humblebrag because of how you seem so "chill" and just advise others to do the same thing. Like, just play the game lol, it's so simple!
---
Maybe stop telling people how to play the game, huh? If you don't even care why are you making this post?
---
and getting posts will seem easier and quicker if you don‚Äôt focus on it as much
---
If survivors die early they get no points too.. it seems like killers are upset about d/c. Not gonna lie, I have a bad habbit of Leaving games if the killer runs really cheap perks or never lets us save anyone. I'm not talking about anyone being op but if we have to rely on hatch to get out over half the time then is the killer role maybe a little strong? More points for certain actions could probably fix it but some people just like others to have a bad day so who knows?
---
It's just ridiculous. Either that happens or you're matched with a killer with horrible McDonald's wifi. I HOPE the fanbase hasn't died because this game is so fun at times
---
i play both equally. try again
---
I definitely agree that bugs should be reported and complained about, it's just that I personally expect it to break in new ways each update. I agree that the game has far more bugs than any other multiplayer games, even those by small studios too. 
---
When the hag is the killer ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS JUST BONES‚Äù
---
Police brutality, coming up!
---
Any perk that counters another is just a poor design choice ie. Choice 1 and 2, as it limits its useability (bare in mind theres no guarantee you'll use to perk in a Match) 
---
And choice 3 just seems like a heavily nerfed NOED. And at the same time you buff it beyond comprehension as surviors now have no counter play
---
The pedo allegations have no actual evidence behind them, just people accusing him of doing those things. I‚Äôm not defending him, but it‚Äôs not fair to just jump the gun and say ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs a pedo 100% confirmed‚Äù without actual evidence. Again, I‚Äôm not defending him at all but I think it‚Äôs not fair to just jump the gun and take these claims as 100% truth. 
---
we‚Äôre all in the same position. it‚Äôs hard to get the points and even harder for killers. but it‚Äôs really not that deep. play the game and you‚Äôll get the points
---
afk in the basement and proteect the chest from other survs
---
give them ur items
---
lmfaoooo how‚Äôs it annoying for my team? and how‚Äôs it trolling? LOL
---
People aren't playing enough killers for numerous reasons, the most prevenlant being that you don't get enough event coins
---
i‚Äôve tried that but it doesn‚Äôt work for me :(
---
You don‚Äôt? 
---
oh im not complaining about ds like these other shit killers but go on and see if your copy paste argument gets you anywhere. besides i'm not really worried about it if the best you could do was hit ctrl-c ctrl-v and change some words as it highly represents the intelligence levels of the survivors who complain about it ;)
---
I'm not talking about people who say "you suck" *obviously*. I'm talking about the people who play the game just to be dicks to others instead of playing the game for the game's sake.
---
Probably, but can you elaborate?
---
Just let the man enjoy the meme :(
---
i‚Äôm not telling them how to play. i‚Äôm telling them TO play.
---
and i can‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs bragging when i‚Äôve just been playing the game? lol
---
literally
---
Well boys and girls here's the next installment of the DbD franchise.
---
Dead by Kombat
---
Soul by Daylight
---
Dead or Daylight 
---
Mortal Daylight
---
Dead Force
---
that‚Äôs trolling lol
---
if by carry you mean carry my team by looping the killer for 5 gens and escaping without adrenaline or ds then yeah, that would be accurate ;)
---
I don't know if I would call a patch a week later "hot fixed."
---
I'm trying, but it's honestly rough. I feel bad for survivors who aren't SWF because you can tell they just get straight up abandoned on hooks. I hook and try to run away and most of the time either survivors give up on hook, or struggle and just die if there are 2 gens left or less. I run away and look for lanterns. I have been getting 3-4k per match even by focusing on the secondary objective (and without it being highlighted it takes that much longer), where I should be getting 1-2k based on how I'm playing.
---
Seems as though despite me being merciful and trying to let survivors have their fun too, this event is just poorly designed. When I go against an all SWF group though, it's like a normal match and I feel like I don't have time to go for the lanterns, so I treat it as such. It's almost like an alternate and really poorly designed version of the actual game for this event, which is really disappointing.
---
No need to thank them, we've come to expect this from them at this point
---
I love these! I wish I could use them but I‚Äôm a console player :(
---
It's alright.. I obviously suck at memes I'm gonna hide the memes here... better luck just asking questions.
---
Mortal Daylight sounds pretty rad, tbh
---
I see, thank you for your quick answer!
---
Yeah, but it's still unbalanced and it's making queue times worse because it's unbalanced. It's reasonable to complain because of that.
---
Gen tap. Good times.
---
Docs eyes staring into my *soul*

Great art btw &lt;3
---
that has nothing to do with getting points but ok
---
This comment... is a little irronic, you think? Why not just play the irl game? "If you don't even care why are you making this".. comment?  I agree, no need to complain about survivors being op. Most people die when they play survivor. 
---
I wasn't. That was my friend in SWF and I knew the killer was gonna hit during the animation. 
---
You will be dead by daylight
---
Business on top, party on bottom.
---
Well I feel 60 seconds of being able to chase with only 3 suits that can be sabotaged, is a bit underpowered. Most chases take a while. And the killer ahould be able to know where their suits are wincr the suits are needed.
---
Boil over is a minor annoyance at worst, actually. It doesn't really make a huge difference with a Killer who knows how to navigate. 
---
Deja Vu, however, is quite something. I will agree with that. 
---
Let me be the first to say, I'm so unhealthy that watching the survivors run makes me tired ok so let's stop right there buddy 
---
Yeah it could! I saw something similar in r/Rainbow6 and decided to make a dbd version just Incase anyone wanted a way to try and atleast start getting in shape, as everyone‚Äôs gotta start somewhere.
---
It's a shame how I'm able to hit ctrl-c ctrl-v so much easier than you can hit a survivor. That's why you rely on NOED.
---
"go on and see if your copy paste argument gets you anywhere"
---
it got you tiled, and that's good enough to me :P
---
Oh my bad, how do we know then? 
---
You all have your volume up way too high.
---
Hot
---
Looking into in again, and seeing the detail I appreciate it even more. And I can‚Äôt even like imagine how hard it had to be for you too get, EVERY pixel. 
---
Amazing job! 
---
‚ÄúStop whining about the event favouring survivors,‚Äù
---
‚ÄúStop whining about the mechanics,‚Äù 
---
I like the building, but would recommend switching agitation with something else. I personally would switch it with thanatophobia, but that's just me. That or sloppy butcher.
---
funny how it took you 20 minutes to come up with that, further proving my point
---
the entity gave her her powers. Just like how the entity gave the wraith his bell and gave the hillbilly super speed when using his chainsaw
---
Thats true
---
Their is nothing can do most killer just want to play the game and will just hit you 
---
I mean, it is a way to counter decisive strike...
---
I‚Äôd rather not do 200 dips per match lmfao 
---
Me everytime I'm on a gen and I have empathy perk and just watch as someone runs my way.
---
if you run into the Killer and he Kills you, it becomes a 3v1?
---
I don't think that the Trapper really has any sort of meta build. Just use whatever perks that you prefer.
---
point still stands, trolling is part of every game, and post game chat doesn't really count 
---
Idk if you kill a survivor your toxic, if you hit them your toxic, if you want to win your toxic, if you breathe in a survivors direction your toxic and god forbid you actually pick up your mouse and keyboard and play as killer becuase your getting stright reported man, as a killer main I really think we should be way more considerate when playing against survivors

---
Makes sense. The one that I was thinking was Hangman‚Äôs Trick because it affects your traps but they never really get sabotaged so that‚Äôs not too great. 
---
I mean, why would you nerf the less powerful team in the first place? But off the top of my head BBQ and chilli got its 43rd counter with the addition of both distortion and locker buffs.
---
Jake clown isn‚Äôt mad at you.. just disappointed. 
---
Welcome to hook vacuums.  But Decisive is overpowerd amirite
---
Is the only thing that scares me in this game 
---
Are you just throwing your opinions at me? I'm saying that not everyone runs great perks everygame if anything the killer has an advantage unless they have less than 3 perks. I already said I didn't mean they were OP so what are you talking about? In my experience the killer varies a lot so saying that they are OP is like saying survivors are OP. The level of skill it takes to play killer is not as much as a solo survivor trying to save people he can't talk to in any way. Sure maybe sfw survivors are annoying or op or something idk. My friends seem to have more luck alone and  I feel the same.
---
Both sides have plenty of toxic players. The difference is that you have one killer and four survivors in each game, so there is a higher chance of the survivor side having a toxic player during a match. 
---
exactly. that‚Äôs about the points.
---
the event favors the survivors because it‚Äôs easier for them to get points. the mechanics are finding the lamps and taking them/destroying them for points.
---
yes
---
What u/qis123 said, just hop in the game and play for a bit and see if you have fun. Just saying with the event going on people are playing a bit more toxic to win and get the coins so if you run into an excess of moris don't be shocked
---
Apparently a developer had mentioned it would be the oldest killer another said it's a vampire, I also don't understand it.
---
you realize you can be hooked two times, right 
---
K
---
Nah, I only match 120 and below ping and it hasn‚Äôt happened to me since newest patch.
---
"I'd like to see you try"
---
*falls over
---
names. how they dress too but that‚Äôs down to stereotypes n assumptions
---
Sounds about right 
---
It was good until the end
---
My family mentioned Jack the Ripper. He was from a long time ago.
---
lmfao ;)
---
Haddonfield still my favorite map
---
Yeah. I personally just run with things that makes chases earlier, since that's what you'll be doing most of the time. Enduring, Spirit Fury, Brutal Strength, etc. But it's all up to you. The Trapper's power isn't reliant on any specific perks. 
---
Noed shouldn't even exist
---
Would not be so bad on XBox if Killers would not Dodge. 
---
Except that‚Äôs the point I can tell from the way you type your messages you rarely play killer and just to spite me you said you play equally you see the way you say things gives away who you really are your a entitled survivor main who rarely plays killer but no we have to stop complaining how about you stop and think rather then coming off arrogant and what about people who only find killer fun what about them those who like to chase rather then being chased? Should they just lie down and take it like a dick?No they should speak their mind all because you people think that no matter what they say they are just annoying complaints in your feed
---
I'll never have to do lunges at least since I've never successfully blinded a killer in my 500 hours.
---
Then again,  I do want a booty. Time to get good.
---
guys i gotta confess, epiczombei2007 is not real!
---
A couple of months ago actually found it while cleaning out my PC xD
---
What about hooking everyone once by pulling them off gen and then using ebony mori?
---
&gt; so once you vault don't just stick around.
---
b b b but I need to teabag and point, how else are they gonna know they suck?
---
I hate it. Im p3 50. It takes 55K average to go through one web. Just for 1 offering. You dont even get that in a game using the offering lol
---
Do you have the post you are referencing kind sir?
---
It came with salt.
---
Forgot a comma there bud
---
yes, but you realise they dont always unhook you and that the Killer might bait you into thinking he is "friendly"?
---
Overall this is a bad Idea for a somewhat competetive pvp game
---
Yeah I do, I‚Äôll tag you in it 
---
Cheers
---
One time, I was playing Myers and the exit gates are open and I caught one, hooked, looked around to see no one far away(I had bbq and chill) and just stayed there to guard the hooked survivor from being saved until they died.   
---
After game chat was like : You filthy camper, why don't you just fuck off and get good?  
---
Me: You can see I have bbq and chill right? I looked around and saw none of you so that means you're all right there. If I understand correctly, you want me to walk away, and look for you/check the exit gates, even though I know you're all there?  
---
Them: Yes you asshat  
---
And that kids, is the last time I payed attention to post-game chat ever again. Survivor main btw, just trying to do killer dailies. 
---
The past still haunts you 
---
man i genuinely hate you
---
Had someone try this on me, too, yesterday. He sabo'd the hook by the gen he was working on as I approached, then ran into the corner. I downed and picked him up and realized there was nothing close. Tried anyway but he got out and ran back to the corner. I redowned him and left him while I went after others. He got up and I went back and smacked him again and saw the hook was back, so I put him on it. :)
---
but then they'll know ur friendly
---
https://youtu.be/pBKEa3R1ru0
---
Hahh, thanks! xD
---
I'm really glad you took the time to edit it.
---
daaaamn thats a smooth Start 
---
Aww, I appreciate that so much. Towards the end, I was cursing ever starting this, but hearing that makes me feel like it was worth it.
---
The worst part is that it only happens when I play with friends. I hide behind a tree and my buddy curves his entire chase over to me and gets me hooked.
---
I was ALREADY laughing at the picture, but this comment made me laugh even harder.
---
The game is peer to peer and not dedicated servers. The killer is the host. Hence laggy is killer has shit net, or if you‚Äôre from a distance from them. But fear not, dedicated servers are coming this summer :‚Äô)
---
I agree with this, but I would also like to add that Killers need to stop dodging. It is getting ridiculous. I have never had so many dodges in this game as I have had tonight.
---
And what really grinds my gears is that we always have killer mains posting about long wait times but then this crap happens. 
---
Lmao
---
That lunge though is tough to avoid. Especially with Leatherface. 
---
Replace killer with survivor and you basically have the same salt. Its just a never ending toxic cycle. I play killer, every 1/5 games Ill get a message. I play survivor, every 1/10 games ill get a message from a shit teammate or the killer. Its just a terrible community all around. 
---
It's a shame there aren't more so you have to choose which you get with event points like the Hallowed Blight stuff.
---
Counter point, pallets seem to extend out like a foot from their models, I've been hit by pallets before I've even gone around the corner
---
I hate when other survivors do that, because I usually end up hooked a few seconds later.
---
Yeah i know you arent defending him. I just remember watching the video and remembering something about the messages. I forgot he said he couldnt prove it
---
Not like there's an entire perk dedicated to preventing that right?
---
^^^(D√©j√† Vu btw)
---
Thank you so much :‚ÄôD 
---
Then do totems? It‚Äôs not that hard.
---
YUP!
---
That's true they were pretty bad. Making them bad for survivors instead isn't the best solution though. 
---
Ohh alright
---
I hope you mean how hitboxes favor the survivor over killer....
---
Why
---
Nah, just gen rush, it's not like they take that long 
---
As if he wasn't weak enough already
---
Wow. What awesome solutions you have given, mate. You want me to slug someone on whom I have spent time to Chase and down just so that they can get healed again and give Me a Chase again with DS still active.
---
What if they deliberately go to s place where you can't get dribbled?
---
And that‚Äôs kinda where the evidence stops. All we have are people‚Äôs words with no real evidence. Until we get some screenshots of him asking for pictures then I‚Äôll believe everyone. Just gets tiring of having people jump the gun on these kind of allegations and I have to be the one to say ‚Äúwell we don‚Äôt know the whole situation‚Äù and then people say I‚Äôm a fanboy when I‚Äôm not. Gets tiring after a while. 
---
Last year more than one would spawn, they changed it 
---
When you've got the thunder going on down under
---
it was me. i was that dumb bitch.
---
Super cool! Well done. Huge SF2 fan here. 
---
Find the Dwight!
---
Why didn't David's jacket come back this year for the event. Will it ever be available again or was it only a one time item
---
This is one of the worst things they could've done during the event. Definitely going to grind as much as I can before that hits PS4. 
---
OMGGGGG 
---
I really hate that perk, and camping the hooks, but damn, can't fault you for camping in that situation!
---
We are all equal on the hook.
---
This, I honestly shouldn't be anywhere near rank 1 survivor skill wise but I just play a lot. Chase me for 30 seconds and you'll probably get me.
---
It's just not fun for me there, and I honestly just don't belong there.
---
If anything blame the system, there should be an unranked casual mode, or make ranking up actually take skill.
---
Oh God. Just when I thought it was dead
---
Pretty much
---
Nobody is saving each other because they did the hotfix where the team shared points. Now it‚Äôs every man for themselves 
---
This is dope af! 
---
&gt; Point # 1
---
Yea....this was made clear when they talked about the event last Dev stream. It even says in the description that when a survivor goes on the hook ALL hanging lamps become corrupted and able to be destroyed. This shouldn't be a surprise to anyone
---
&gt; Point 2
---
Yea, this one sucks, especially because they blatantly announced it on their stream. However, take a moment and realize what would happen if this wasn't true. Let's say even if a survivor holding a lamp gets disconnected, they still get credit for it. You want to know what would happen?
---
Survivors would run in, grab the nearest lamp, disconnect and move on to the next game. And let me make it perfectly clear, there is a rather well-known method of disconnecting, that if done  right, still grants the survivor BP / lets them keep their items / and basically the game treats it as if the killer rage quit. This method is incredibly low-tech and anyone can do it. 
---
So back to what I was saying, think back to the Hallowed Blight event. Survivors pretty much did the exact thing I'm talking about. They sucked all the cankers dry, found the killer, suicided on the hook and got into the next game all within a few minutes. It was absolutely awful.
---
At least with this event, people still have to play nearly the entire match out. But if you could keep your lamp on a disconnect, games would be over within 1-3 minutes every time and no one would be having fun.
---
&gt; Point 3
---
This is purely to prevent greed. Again, BHVR learned from survivors competing against each other for cankers. Now there is still competition, but your odds go way way up for every offering burned. 
---
&gt; Point 4 
---
For the first time since I started playing last September, the Killer queues aren't fucked. This is a god damn miracle. It should also be an indication to you that this event *ISN'T* killer sided if everyone is going and playing survivor. Because they know you earn more points faster and with less effort in that role
---
&gt; Point 5
---
This is probably one of the best implementations of a Holiday event  objective that doesn't completely fuck over either side in terms of getting gens done / getting survivors hooked. 
---
It's a tiny time commitment that makes each player make choices with what risks they want to take. Don't want a lantern to be destroyed? Pick it up, become more visible and make yourself a more attractive target but get bonus BP the longer you hold it.  Leave it for when the gens are almost complete and you risk having it destroyed.
---
This entire post seems like you've got this skewed logic that you should be escaping every match with a lantern. That's a horrible way to approach this. You're already getting 20 points for having all the gens complete, whether you actually helped your team or not. 
---
I've been playing mostly survivor since the event started since solo still has decent queue times. Already at 714/4500 points for the cosmetics and not slowing down. It's so stupidly easy as a survivor to get both Event points and bonus BP. 
---
This event does have problems, but it's so far from being killer sided I'm wondering how you even came to this conclusion. 
---
Not to mention you wouldn't be able to even get the chance to use the perk at all. 80/70/60 wiggle bar? Depending if you had the green variation, your telling them to just wiggle all the way off. I play plenty of killer and there's ALWAYS hooks around. That perk would essentially be useless.
---
 If you want a 1.5 second stun, just use Enduring. that perk makes the stun very low.
---
We don‚Äôt say that word around here...
---
While I don't think that a longer lunge is what is needed, I do agree with your sentiment. Most people who don't play LF or are only used to going against him don't realize how close he has to be when he starts his rev in order to catch up by the end of his chainsaw sweep (this changes with add ons though). 
---
I believe that when LF begins to rev his chainsaw his movement speed decreases to 87.5% and then slowly accelerates to 250% once fully charged and released. 
---
Crap....
---
If only I could even draw and be good
---
UwU bing bong boi!
---
What are you talking about? Surely billy is not supposed to hit a survivor who not only vaulted the window but also starting running.
---
You can only grab a single Vessel,but with an offering you get points for picking one up (1k) and holding it (500/minute) and escaping a whopping 5k
---
That's kind of a lame excuse. "Oh, it's easy, just do ___". Well, I could argue "It's easy, just use Enduring". 
---
It doesn't change the fact plenty of people have made rank 10+ just because they rely on one perk to crutch them up there. I don't hear people saying "The only reason they got such a high rank was because of Decisive Strike!"
---
Imagine gatekeeping a meme 
---
Yeah, I'm seeing a lot of selfishness and stuff like that, and a shit ton of potatoe heads. Just had a guy lead the killer right to me because he knew he was going down so I just left.
---
I'm in the same boat as you. I get that a lot of people HATE NOED, but I kinda like it. Its one of the few times this game feels like a horror game again (at least for me). Back when I was new I used to be scared of the killer all the time. Now I just loop. But when the killer has a Mori or NOED, or say their Devour Hope has 5 tokens... now that shit is frightening.
---
It didn't even look like a hook vacuum but it probably was 100%, just latency fucking with everyone.
---
This game sometimes.
---
As an addendum to your tip, about 80% of the time it's a misplay to have more than one person per gen. It's slower than splitting up, and best case you've revealed to the killer what 2+ survivors are doing instead of 1. Worst case is you both get hit scrambling to run away.
---
There's also Discordance, so... think really hard about whether it's a good idea to 2-man a gen before you do it.

It‚Äôs been happening to me a lot, lately. Even before the event started. I figured out that around 5PM EST to 8PM EST is when I have the easiest time getting into a lobby. That being said, SWF always takes me at least five or ten minutes. Even more right now, though. 
---
This is a rare encounter is the wild

I'm back

&gt; plenty of people have made rank 10+ just because they rely on one perk to crutch them up

....

&gt; I don't hear people saying "the only reason they got such a high rank was because of Decisive Strike."

Amazing work OP, time well spent. 
---
Lurker jumping in here, but how so? If memory serves, the only way they interact is that they both cause an obsession, right?
---
This type of stuff still happens with dedicated servers.
---
Uh very much so. The o my reason I knew the name sounded familiar is because I saw a video on Facebook about a month ago talking about jack black starting up a gaming channel and just remembered the name because it stuck with me for some reason. 
---
I‚Äôm glad I remembered! 
---
I wish there was a killer version of this
---
Fuck I thought this would actually be helpful. 
---
And it was! Thanks OP.
---
I was using a Myers with minimal perks since I don't usually play killers so I literally had no choice but to play it. He's not even level 50 :(
---
were u playing with a survivor that has lube on its name.
---
thank god i'm almost done with my 3rd coin and can just forget about the event. 
---
Then they borrowed time and body block for the 4 man escape. Crying intensifies

daaamnn. 
---
Haven‚Äôt played for awhile, what happened on 2.5?
---
They *are* scary accurate. Well done, either way.
---
God forbid people don't be raging cunts and remove someone from even having the chance to actually play the match via a no skill offering
---
You didn't let me win! TAXIC
---
Idk I've had no problems. Killer queues were much longer. I think they're still longer during this event.
---
It would be funny if Cindy had rank 20 on her face while Brenda had rank 1 and the whole scene played out having the skeleton have qrank 20 killer.
---
I agree but killer usually gets way more bloodpoints than survivor anyway. But it‚Äôs true that if they wanted to fill up moons they would have more trouble. 
---
Actually, it means that survivors generally cut tomatoes with very large knives, but killers observe small pocket knives. Make sense?
---
Freddy: speed 1 strength 1 ability 1
---
The rank system is just too easy for the ability to get pips. Safety pips are super easy to get especially for unrewarding gameplay. In my survivor games, you can safety by solo doing one gen, cleansing at least one totem and getting an unhook. Afk next to a hook and die ASAP. Boom safety pip. As a killer just chase and hit all game. No hooks. Break shit like pallets and kick gens and there‚Äôs your safety. Or just use your ability and get BP all game for Doctor shocking and chainsaw usage. What‚Äôs worse is Legion is my favorite killer and by just using their power, you will get Iridicent Chaser and Malicious just cause of how many times you can hit someone before you down them. 
---
My one proposed change to the system is remove safety pips in red ranks and make the gap between 1-2 pips closer towards the end of the bar. If we want players to feel like they‚Äôre giving it their all in red ranks/rank one then make people earn that shit. Or even make the last three ranks be obtainable by scoring at least two Iridicent emblems because getting a pip should be hard at high ranks not just mindlessly simple. 
---
Hag and David?
---
Just versed a guy that was rank 10 saying using ruin at this rank was toxic and gave me an easy win. He was using DS. XD
---
They‚Äôre all great movies, even though Freddy became kind of a wisecracking protagonist. What was really awesome is how that trend in the films became part of the plot of New Nightmare, which was one of the best sequels of any franchise ever. Arguably it‚Äôs not a true sequel because it doesn‚Äôt take place in the same universe.
---
Huntress using insta down addons in my every game lol and mori too..
---
Did I miss the part where the killer doesn't have to actually catch someone? How is it no skill when you're still required to catch someone? Seems pretty naive to think you can win every match unscathed. There's equally cancer tactics survivors can use. I swear, a sizable portion of people in this sub seem to want killers to just telegraph everything they do and escort the survivors out the gate. 
---
I looked at the outfits, realized I don't care about them and then realized the event is basically over for me. Really disappointing. I'm just playing like normal now. If I happen to see a vessel on the way I might grab it, but only if we're doing well.
---
The huntress skin is basically just her bear one, but slightly better imo. It definitely doesn't top out her blight skin.
---
Nothing new. During any event, be it seasonal or simply a bonus exp weekend I dont play survivor simply because it's not fun. I usually just run farm matches as killer, or games where I'll only hook everyone once. I like to think the games people are matched against me are a relaxing break from the sweaty killer community.
---
Nurse and Clown have been the worst for me, especially when the clown would throw his potion because it would look like he missed but I still get affected by it anyway. 
---
I'm not sure how I'd spice up events, honestly there's not much you can do when it comes you a game like dbd and events
---
Yeah, I don't know why they gave huntress another skin when she got an amazing skin in the last event. I don't own Feng, but I'll still probably get the cosmetic.
---
they patched this out already
---
Oh so they fixed the bug where you share? 
---
How do I delete someone else‚Äôs comment?
---
I think "powers" were given to less than physically adept killers to make up for what they lacked, while *less* obedient ones were tortured/mutilated, example trapper and the metal in his shoulder, wraith being afflicted with treeman syndrome etc.
---
This is great! Amazing job!
---
yep
---
One hook, kill. Versus 2/3 hooks it's supposed to take. It's really funny though how you somehow twist that to a narrative of me saying that killers are OP when I neither said that, nor came anywhere close to saying that. Good try though bud.
---
&gt; /s
---
I think you dropped this.
---
It's okay, guys! He was joking!
---
Nice
---
Prolly a fake tbh, it'd be cool if it were him tho
---
I've had many many people die on first or second hook purely because their teammates just wanted the lanterns, it's pretty bad.
---
Is it really? I for some reason find it hard to think that jack black plays dbd.
---
I like her blight axe more but the rest of this skin is better imo. Better cosmetics than the summer event that‚Äôs for sure.
---
I dont think so
---
Spirit and Dwight, lmao
---
Yeah, nah that never happens. There's always at least one that comes to tap up the survivor after they're fully recovered. Most red rank games are relatively altruistic. Never seen a team leave someone slugged. 
---
This is funny because I've gotten two 4 DC games today and some guy that started cussing me out in Arabic thinking I won't understand (I'm Arabian too lol)
---
Can u not go to it on mobile?
---
Because they are cunts, it's a dick move to use a mori to remove someone from a match well before they normally would have without it.  More so during an event where everyone just wants to get cosmetics as fast as possible.  
---
" I never said you insinuated killers were OP. Seems like you're projecting a bit. " really you didn't  
---
"  I swear, a sizable portion of people in this sub seem to want killers to just telegraph everything they do and escort the survivors out the gate. " That sure insinuates it.   
---
" There's equally cancer tactics survivors can use. " " It's a hook to kill, not a grab. Use decisive strike and get free. " Nice dude.  
---
" There is counter play. " To a mori, no there isn't it's either don't get hooked at all or die. 90% of the time the second someone is unhooked they are tunneled just to get the mori off   
---
" I don't understand how its "supposed" to be 2/3 hooks to kill when the same people that put those rules in place also allow for modifiers to that rule. " Oh I'll scream from the top of a mountain all day the Devs incompetence when it comes to this game.  Mori's/ Freddy/ legion/ nurse/ map design 
---
This hurts my morale
---
I've definitely had my fair share of shitty killers. So many moris, so many insta-downs, not to mention being tunneled and camped.
---
There are shitty survivors, too, who take a lantern and hide all game. They do nothing just so they can escape with it. It's very draining.
---
I don't know which event was worse, this or the flowers. 
---
same here
---
It's funny how people make these huge assumptions.  This video starts by saying if you've been in DBD community for more than a few days, you would have heard of this guy.  I've been playing steady for over a year and never heard of him.  People get pretty narrow focused thinking everyone sees what they see.
---
Yea who in the right mind would play this poorly put together game... except u and I tho cuz it‚Äôs still fun lol
---
Yeah. I get that. I find it disgusting how if you slug and camp, you can finish the game so much easier than if you play ethically. The devs need to do something about this. 
---
this is sick bro keep itup
---
me too... and it sounds a lot more clear/better quality than the old music too
---
I don‚Äôt have the blight skin, so being able to get this skin for a few hours of gameplay was really great.
---
Blood points. I was not talking about coins. 
---
Why you gotta be so mean
---
how do you move left
---
People can be entitled idiots 
---
They can equally be sore losers because there‚Äôs been several times when I‚Äôm about to hook or Mori them and they dc
---
They sometimes call me names like noob or trash even though they lost
---
This isn‚Äôt just to killers their teammates can equally be targeted when you don‚Äôt save them for any reason even when you couldn‚Äôt have done anything.
---
For example I opened the gate and my teammate was hooked by a patrolling billy and he got mad when I left him and I pointed out that it was unlikely I would have been able to save him.
---
I‚Äôve seen enough horror movies to see that it will probably get us both killed
---
huntress skin is ugly 
---
Whispers 
---
Ugh, alright maybe he didn't see it. I guess I'll be upvote...
---
I get some people run by you and get you caught by the killer, but fucking seriously unless you run bond or sometimes empathy, we can't fucking see where other survivors are and are a bit distracted trying to run for our lives.
---
*Y-yame*, *you'we* making my *smow* peepee *gwow* uwu
---
He seems to be the idiot who thinks they are entitled to escape 
---
Then just stop playing it if it's only getting worse. What incentive would the devs have to make it better if people just keep logging on to play it? I stopped playing a while back because I really couldn't be bothered to wait 10 minutes to start a game just for survivors to tbag and stall, then post game is just people telling me how I'm the one playing "wrong" somehow. I didn't bitch, I just quit because it's ridiculous and it doesn't seem to get better. DbD has to be one of the most toxic gaming communities over ever been in. Both sides are so incapable of recognizing the core problems of the game and choose to just place blame on the opposite side. It gets so fucking old. 
---
oh you're using controller nvm lol
---
Oooh or a leprechaun for St Patrick's.
---
tfw a party gets party killed with two disconnects and one of them calls you trash
---
Oh and in post-chat the player told me they meant to drop the pallet but instead when the push made them go into the locker, we had a laugh about it, THIS AUTOMATICALLY MAKES US BEST FRIENDS NOW! I HOPE YOU LIKE ANTLER CHANDELIERS AND RABBITS! I LIVE IN THE FOREST! PLEASE COME VISIT ME!
---
I don‚Äôt mind killing but the only reason I play the game is to play with friends. It‚Äôs just disappointing. Currently at a 25 minute wait by the way if you wanna hop on and catch these flashlights 
---
And not having shift taped down.
---
Ripped by daylight
---
No it doesn't. The event lets you get them for free. Stop being an entitled elitist jealous that other people with busy lives, or who started playing after the event, get to also enjoy the same cool shit as you.
---
Thing about Balanced Landing is even if you're exhausted, you still get a vastly decreased falling penalty.  And that by itself warrants a perk.  None of the other exhaustion perks have a 'passive' effect like that, and that makes BL probably the best IMO.
---
You should never farm, in end game chat I will call killers out for farming nearly every time. Not to be toxic, simply to say you‚Äôre wasting mine and others time as I‚Äôm here to play DBD not FarmVille. 
---
Father is angry with you.
---
I had one yesterday where I vaulted and then all of a sudden I‚Äôm just running into the window as if I did not vault.
---
And Lithe activated.....
---
Come on DBD did I vault or not - make up your mind
---
I shot him 6 times!
---
Ouch, but not inaccurate
---
Lol! I love how everyone's mind went to this. I've smiled at all of them! I was screaming "moth!" To myself looking for a lamp yesterday 
---
This is anti-money for them tho
---
Yeah, incredibly biased and short-sighted of BVHR.  
---
yeah, I got it from the shrine of secrets and used to use it when I had mori missions a long time ago, now if I bring it I usually forget that I HAVE THE POWER! So when I one-shot someone I'm like, wow, I guess I really hated them...Oh wait DH haha
---
Let's
---
Get
---
Political!
---
HAha JK, YAY DRAX!
---
Yeah, he hasn't started at all and says every video he doesn't know how to game on the computer yet.
---
When i want to derank i just let them kill me fast x-x 
---
The New Nightmare
---
Definitely is, but Jack Black has started what is (supposedly) a gaming youtube channel under a similar name.
---
Intentionally stupid is still stupid
---
Gamerescape lied to me
---
let the killer chase me round and then let him hook me 3 times gives survs chance to do gens and the killer still gets his kill, winwin imo
---
What'd you hit? I can't see anything...
---
Wasn't farming, I was somewhat playing normally but more forgiving. When some of the survivors was close to getting out of the exit gate and they saw me, I just walked away. If I was heading towards the hook that the person was unhooked I just target the one isn't in the dying state. So technically I just didn't kill anyone.
---
i think i notice that direction thing, similar issue i see when attacking ppl at generators or vaults. More of an inconvenience in those cases since like in the case of a vault ill just climb over and pick them up but with 2 ppl at hook it's a huge advantage for the survivors.
---
every survivor needs a perk that shows auras tbh 
---
Dude me and my roommate had a conversation about this this morning, what a coincidence. What the fuck bhvr? Why the hell did you earrape me? 
---
Needed to be said! Also, super important, just always be doing something.. There‚Äôs no point in crouching around the map if it doesn‚Äôt get you places. 
---
Claudette. And yeah, it's super hard to see her, lol.
---
it's not an advantage though, that's a pretty bad position to be in, there's always The Pig's Make Your Choice if you want more of an advantage...
---
This clip is actually pretty funny LOL
---
Maybe behavior can do a quick experiment.
---
In any mode not named kyf, all chat is immediately disabled for about a month.
---
I'm curious as to how many salty messages are going to be sent via 2nd or 3rd party means.
---
funny, it made me remember how it all started. 
---
2003, me 11yo to almost 12. came back from Baikal camping and got my own personal internet (before that it was through phone and I wasn't really interested in using it, had too many gaemz to play and books to read). 
---
so I sat and decided to explore the *W E B*. stumbled upon Harry Potter rp text forum where I spent a lot of time later completely unironically like a normal fukin kid just writing fanfiction with other Potterheads. 
---
but I also had another side. 
---
some weird way, literally a month before 4chan even launched, I have found a forum - Christie Glamour - where girls who liked popular back in these times glamour were discussing weirdest topics to me. abortion in age 13, sex, boys, all the things that I didn't care about like clothes. I got really curious. few weeks I was just reading their posts with lots of grammatical mistakes, stupidity and weird discussions. then I started participating in these discussions intentionally making my grammar very poor and pretending to like what they like. then I proceeded to creating posts of how I'm 14 and pregnant, my boyfriend cheating and so on, getting responses, support.
---
later on I'd start giving shitty advices. the ones that only stupid people would follow. and some did follow. 
---
in like end of 2003 I was already a known member of their community, they thought I'm one of them. and I remember a girl was asking for advice on dying their hair with henna. I told her she needs to use warm pee instead of water cause it will make the colour brighter and the effect to last longer and also more healthy. she believed. her blonde hair turned into acid-like carrot colour and she wouldn't stop bitching about it on this forum. then I have created a post saying they all are disgusting, dumb and I wish they would kill themselves cause they're human trash. and left. after that I only use internet for games and information. no more Potterhead forums either.
---
few years later, early 2007, age 15, I'm very much goth and unsure if even straight. searching for yuri on the webz. see 4chan /u/, stay for a bit. then realise there's more to this imageboard. see /b/, stay. my family, my home, finally people like me:c we troll, we bully, we attack, we have no morals. best time in my life(apart from rn when I have a husband). then joined russian equivalent of 4chan, 2ch, got de-anoned in late 2008 by a guy I knew irl, stayed for a little more even though normies sorta occupied my 2ch and then I just focus on university while only watching YouTube and research my philosophy stuff. 
---
going back to active internet using after graduating in 2014. see that my internet is a trashbin of normal fukin people making up their shitty rules and enforcing them on my /b/rothers. disappointed. only play some occasional MMOs and as per usual researching information. YouTube is trash. 
---
year 2017, I join Harry Potter gmod server, get fucked over like a baby killer by 'murican system they applied on a god damn Hogwarts RP server with bullshit tolerance and stupid rules. 
---
year 2018. join dbd sub Reddit. get fucked over by people calling me insane just because they can't comprehend my logic with no emotions or morals involved. 
---
wow, sorry. I'll leave it here to reread sometime. that was some flashback.
---
Yours are not.
---
The hitboxes have been shit for months and have just gotten worse every update. Dedicated servers wont fix that, although it will definitely reduce the number of bullshit hits that killers can land. I doubt they're ever fixing the hotboxes though. The entire community collectively shit its pants when they actually fixed the huntresses hotboxes.
---
They can remove NOED as well. Its a shit perk.
---
Thanks, I didn't know that. I don't know if killers get more points, I know it let's them have more chances to smash stuff tho...
---
And the fact he would be single digit survivor rank lol
---
I'm glad I'm not alone on that feeling.
---
Dunno. I see a ton of survivors going into my games with 500+ ping all the time for some reason lol
---
i would say you can pretty match let half of the points on the list i would just add something like pallet stunned, bloodlust and maybe missed lunge
---
Killer Instinct
---
How dare you not allow baby survivor to cash in their get out of jail free card.  
---
I like how the link indicates this is from a PBS documentary...
---
can i have this unedited image for research purposes only pls
---
Siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiick!
---
Photoshopped! FAKE NEWS, everyone!
---
Yeah thats me.I stopped doing it a while ago since I have been playing with friends more often.
---
Bro it's already happened.  Every P3 claudette is a killer.  A no gen repairing, urban premonition hiding around the map hatch camping killer 
---
all the people playing in pubs must be redditors...
---
Yeah. That's just weird to mr for some reason. Probably because I didn't think he's a gamer if is actually is.
---
Yup. Its the main reason survivors are so much stronger then killers. The only thing that comes close to the impact SWF has is selfcare. You have a free Bond, Kindred, Empathy,you know where the totems are if one person has seen them, Killer cannot juggle chases, as the second he starts chasing someone they tell their friends to get on gens, you can coordinate builds, you can save your friend's item if they die and give it back to them later, co-ordinate body blocks so the killer doesn't get hooks, and people are more toxic when they have their friends to back them up. But other then that it isn't so bad.
---
PeashootO!
---
It is. And it is not yours. 
---
I guess he was only lucky by half
---
Who was that?
---
Never said it was?
---
I love it on Leatherface. You can conceal it until 5 stacks.
---
If you're going to keep trying to get this going maybe do some stream clips or fan art, buddy.
---
Damnnn when did Dwight get so thicc
---
So? What's wrong with wanting a 4k?
---
50 minutes i waited in a group of 3. Just gave up at that point. Lobby simulator we call it.
---
Yeah, it's happening more after this lunar patch. Don't really know why, prob just a bug
---
If they didn't do a fast vault then it 100 percent was not a bullshit hit. being on the other side of a window means little. Being able to hit through them is intended. The survivor ran a bad route
---
Ace's psychic facesplitter mori is ultra disgusting.
---
you also didn't actually reply to any point they made but whatever
---
Yeah no shit.
---
That's hilarious. Sorry, dude.
---
:O He/she REALLY wants to talk to my manager.

Wow. That‚Äôs such a long reply and I loved reading it all! 2008 was my favorite year of the Internet, and I met my husband somewhat because of 4chan. 
---
But it still looks like a butt to me, from the ‚Äúpooping back and forth‚Äù thing
---
))&lt;&gt;((
---
Any of these are good
---
It says on the perk it does
---
yup
---
Yes.
---
lmao
---
lag
---
r/wooosh!
---
That means the killer is leaving. 
---
&gt; they will grind whether they buy it during the event 
---
Why? Look at current event and make it that you can't buy outfits after event's end. Let's say I buy an outfit I want on day 1. What makes you think I will grind after that? I already got what I wanted from this event.
---
That build?Yikes.
---
Whispers and Surveillance do different jobs.
---
Whispers is good for early and end game tracking.
---
Surveillance is good for gen patrol and mid game awareness. 
---
Now I use Whispers because BBQ is my mid game info perk, so I prefer being given an easy snowball or 4K thanks to Whispers 
---
I counter your locker Dwight with iron maiden
---
I wish Feng had this face in the game too. 
---
Idk over half of those I've never heard anyone complain about. I've definitely heard everything from OP  
---
Like when has a killer insulted a survivor for getting off his shoulder or for NOT darting at the hook right away, usually it's the opposite.
---
&gt; Stop making every event a massive grind followed by burning out and not wanting to touch DBD for a month.
---
But what about massive cry "we need more grind" when they announced Halloween event? "Why can't I grind for every skin? Give me something to grind!" There was a lot of these messages here. Well, now you can grind for every outfit...
---
Its a perk dude.Its literally in the game.Its bullshit but it is what it is.
---
You get 1500 BP for destroying a vessel
---
Amen. I don't care about events much, as long as I can actually play game. Queues are so fast!
---
I really like this event it brings a cool aspect to the game. I like fighting for lamp with survivors. But i did mostly play killer so it could be the survivor side is thrash. 
---
Wish they would fix healing, so it doesn‚Äôt feel super clunky after unhook and automatic canceling 1 second in.
---
Bro the amount of times I get hit with Rancor and Dying Light is so annoying - I have never ever used DS, it's a crappy perk; but all of a sudden I'm the obsession and the killer now has the largest hard-on for me in the world.
---
unzips
---
The complaints in Hallowed Blight weren't "we want to grind a lot more," they were that we were only allowed to earn 1 set of cosmetics out of 7.
---
Their "solution" was to triple how much we could grind for free, that isn't to say that people wanted to have to do that much to get hats they otherwise have to pay for in the store now.
---
In this event, yes, it's possible to earn all of what they added, but it takes a ridiculous, and frankly unhealthy amount of gameplay to do so. It's clear to everyone that their goal isn't to add earnable event cosmetics, but to get people to pay for them.
---
you no ride horse,
---
horse rides you
---
\~berserk
---
I'm just mad how many points you need to get a full moon keeps increasing. 
---
forgot to sc on my computer :( only had this crappy phone pic
---
Yeah I love reading things but also I think ‚Äúwow that‚Äôs a lot of text, I wonder if there‚Äôs something good I might miss out on by not reading it‚Äù 
---
Also it‚Äôs from a movie, I think it‚Äôs called ‚Äúyou, me and everyone we know‚Äù or something like that. 
---
give this a try
---
Hope,sprint burst,adrenaline 
---
gotta go fast
---
outrun any fucking killer once the gens are done 
---
would inverting the colors on your monitor help?
---
What exactly happened?
---
Here is the video https://youtu.be/KQoJo81lujk
---
I have tried to use Devour Hope over and over on so many different killers, and I don't think I have ever actually been able to get it to work. It has the potential to be extremely powerful, but with how quickly totems get found and cleansed the most you're usually going to get is *maybe* one or two stacks, which is enough for the haste effect and nothing else. It has the same problem that Huntress's Lullaby has in which it is a late game perk that is almost never going to make it to late game, but at least Huntress's gives you some kind of base effect.
---
10-20 min solo just to get a lobby dodging killer
---
50+ swf  
---
Personally, I prefer the version of the line from the remake.
---
&gt;Oh, god.   
---
&gt; No. Just me.
---
That reminds me of Ludwig from Bloodborne. 
---
...wut?
---
Like The Trapper being a fighter in Mortal Kombat. Not Scorpion being a killer in Dead by Daylight. 
---
I don't really get why they did that.  It's like, even with the better event bonuses it wasn't moving things along _too_ fast, and it's hugely beneficial to those still leveling characters or trying to prestige.  
---
If I had a penny for every time I see a survivor stand at a pallet and wait for the killer to Come to throw I  down I'd be a millionaire lmao
---
Who ever decided killers can destroy the vessels was dumb. Who ever decided that a killer DCing to rid you of your vessels before escaping, FULLY KNOWING how toxic their community is, is straight up mentally handicapped. Change my mind.
---
**Rule 3** - Shaming other players.
---
* Do not publicly shame other players.
---
No
---
Just try to get some friends together and play some. Makes rank one less of a hassle/annoyance when you don't put much thought into it. Best to play this game casually, if anything.
---
Broken Matchmaking
---
It really do be like that. I just don't want to ruin new player's games :(
---
Maybe your connection sucks?
---
Maybe your connection sucks? It‚Äôs either yours or the killer‚Äôs one that sucks cos I can assure you that these things don‚Äôt happen if both the killer and survivor have good connections.
---
Amazing art again! This would look great on a T shirt!!
---
Id say you get cosmetics easier than the halloween event, i for one got 1 coin in a day yesterday for playing 3-4 hrs. So yeah, i dont think this event is that krindy.
---
Yeah, congratulations on earning one of nine event cosmetics. You are officially 1/45th of the way through the grind.
---
You can get 1 coin in 3 hours easily, so 9 hrs for a skin. Id say thats not a big grind.
---
Survivors are not competing for points. 
---
We tested this out in a SWF group and you only need one chap to leave with a vessel, if you escape as well (even without a vessel) you gain the points. 
---
&gt; They aren't SO DESPERATE for cash that events can't be a reasonable grind.
---
Reasonable for whom? For a player who puts in 5 hours a week? 15? 40? You can find "I got a game on a free weekend and now it's Monday and I have 30 hours..." topics here. On Halloween I think there was a post about unlocking everything possible on third day (or maybe even on second?)
---
And you can't say if they're desperate for cash or not without looking at their finance reports. But I don't think anyone on this subreddit saw that.
---
Was the game even out on console during campfire simulator?
---
Oh I met that same person. Only I didn't visit the basement since I had prem and suspected that's what they were doing.
---
_damn it feels good to be a gangster intensifies_
---
That was a bug which was patched out today.
---
You know what makes me extra stupid?
---
I watched him go to the basement and never come out. 
---
I knew what he was doing and I *still went down there.*
---
It was a good laugh at least. 
---
You are playing a flawed game with sketchy devs, you are gonna have to do some things you don't like if you wanna get the best experience.  Just the way it is
---
I have a lot of fun with Wraith, I am using.. Spies from the shadows, rancor, hex thrill of the hunt for BP and predator. What I want though is BBQ and chilli, brutal strength and maybe enduring to throw in that mix though. I even got out of bed and booted up the pc to check for you lol, anyway, that's my 2 cents. Oh and I plan on trying out a nurses calling too. So 2 build ideas there too.
---
Wait, for real? I thought it was meant to be this way to discourage sandbagging for points. 
---
Also, further reading into you wall of text, hooking isn‚Äôt even 2% of a cosmetic. It‚Äôs 2% of the first one as the second coin needs 200, the one after that 300 etc. 
---
Alright stop... collaborate and fix gens. Dwight is back with a bag full of wrenches...
---
Sorry, I got what you meant, I was joking. Yeah, that's a much longer shot than I originally thought. I mean I love Dead By Daylight (sometimes I don't) but Mortal Kombat is much higher, and since they all use weapons, maybe...Soul Calibur?
---
Whoa! This is amazing!!
---
John Carpenter told them to make it louder
---
say what now? what did i miss?
---
Can confirm I scream "LAMP!!" whenever I see one.
---
No one can say what killer would be fun for you. There are people who love to play Clown, I think he's boring. There are people who can play Billy every day for hours, there are those who find his playstyle dull. You have to decide for yourself. Watch some streamers/Youtubers.
---
Effectiveness wise Nurse is the strongest killer, if you're on PC. Hillbilly, Spirit, Huntress are strong killers. But truth is - if you have fun playing, say, Freddy (considered weakest by most players) you can master him to make him quite strong and play at the highest ranks.
---
"Ho...how did get so huge?"
---
"I suck at DbD. Also drugs."
---
Bing Bong! 
---
To be fair it has been like that since before the patch. But I don‚Äôt mind it that much. The ridiculous hits that happen rn however are a different story. I don‚Äôt encounter them much though.
---
Mfw killers actually complains about BP gain lmaoo. Guess they cry about everything
---
Don‚Äôt know who downvoted this and why. But he‚Äôs right, shit like this happens all the time in other multiplayer games it‚Äôs called ‚Äúfavor the shooter‚Äù however in this case the only ‚Äúshooter‚Äù is the killer. OP wasn‚Äôt past the pallet when the Pig smacked him on the pigs screen.
---
hell ya yugi
---
11/10
---
Awesome
---
The moment you mentioned SC your entire statement became false. The perk is garbage because it takes so long to heal.
---
I didn't expect the ending 
---
Then dc or do gens and get out. Not that hard.
---
It's a lot easier as survivor but killer could be more reliable 
---
Honestly, I can imagine some of survivors doing something like this to brighten up the other survivors. 
---
&gt; if you escape as well (even without a vessel) you gain the points. 
---
You got points even if you died after someone escaped with a vessel... not anymore :rooCry:
---
Shirtless dwight make my PP hard
---
Out-skilled ;)
---
Looking good
---
Finally.
---
Time to leave this sub
---
How is this event so survivor-sided point-wise? Everyone called it before the event even went live. They hotfixed the bug where the first survivor getting out with a vessel before anyone died rewarded everyone with 45 points no matter what, but honestly that leads to better gameplay and teamwork than the sandbagging mess it has returned to now. Funny how their bugs lead to better design than their original plan for the ~~cosmetic firesale~~ event.
---
Are they just trying to break the queues? There's little incentive to play killer for the event besides the bloodpoints; a perfect 45 point game for killer is so much harder to attain than just escaping yourself with a vessel. The queues are already suffering for it, and instead of adjusting that for killers they just nerfed something that reduced the grind for survivors. Fair play, this is all a cosmetic push anyway, I just wish it wasn't so obviously one with how grindy it feels on both sides.
---
Here we see someone who wants to feel special.
---
If you want exclusives I can link you a dude who sells codes, starting from 100‚Ç¨ :)
---
This got hotfixed, unfortunately. Back to the sandbag fest if you're not playing with friends! (And knowing some friends, even that won't stop them)
---
Looks like the nerdy character on an 80s/early 90s teen sitcom.
---
Play With Your Food is for movement speed. The perk you are thinking is Save The Best for Last and you need 8 stacks to have the max attack speed possible which probably won't happen by the time you reach a hatch standoff cuz the obsession will be dead already.
---
Even if you do manage to reach a hatch standoff with 8 stacks, it still won't be fast enough. 
---
Great thing is that you get extra BP for holding the Vessel. 
---
Sad thing is you don't get BP is somebody else holds a vessel. 
---
In Hallowed Blight everyone who used the offering gets BP if someone drains a Canker dry
---
No mither is to op as it is :/ 
---
We tried that once, didn‚Äôt work for me back then (day 1-2) :morfCry: 
---
Won't work
---
Yesterday I was looping a wraith for 5 gens. As the last gen gets fixed I attempt to vault window however my adrenaline cancelled the vault (animation had started). Luckily he didn‚Äôt have noed.
---
Ya the event is a grind. But I‚Äôm having fun in a weird way. So far I got 6 coins
---
Missed opportunity to make legion with Frank's mix tape a noose 
---
It's a resolution-bug with widescreen, idk how you fix it tho
---
How do you counter a 3 gen strat against a doctor when in one? 
---
It was a typo haha big thumbs and a small phone :)
---
Ya sadly patched on pc but not console just yet. The event is a big grind I have 6 coins and I been playing like none stop 
---
Damn can't even call him by his real name :( feelsmauriceman
---
Nobody is talking about tunneling. But at the end you can only chase one person and they'll do gens right next to you if they're any good.
---
Me, when my cat did his things on the carpet.
---
4500 points for everything. 
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. You will most likely get 2 full sets of cosmetics with playing regularly
---
Ya a lot of disconnects it feels like 
---
On the flipside I've been trying to be a nice killer, survivors have been using their ultra rare items/addons and gimmick genrush builds and still DCing after the first down. I don't understand, why go through the trouble of wasting those offerings if you're not gonna see the game through?
---
I don't like this reasoning because you could easily reply as a valid  counterargument "killers everywhere I urge you to ONLY run Ruin and bring Ebony moris because they're just gonna be dicks, trust me." But thinking like that really doesn't get us anywhere. If you really think DS, instaheals are OP and start heavily using them you're only asking to continue the cycle of facing whatever OP killer/perks/addons you hate the most as well.
---
Don't get in one in the first place. And if you are in one, try to draw away the aggro while your teammates finish it.
---
6 coins is a shitton considering you still got 12 days. That‚Äôs about half of the total points. 
---
I'm not reading all that but want to tell you, yes its fucking bad but still better then recycling old shit hopefully 
---
Myers is the ultimate starter killer. Effective at killing, unique for being a normal chase killer, big variety of addons and can make good use of a few perks.  
---
Optimal build would be mandatory Hex: Ruin with 3 perks of your choice.  
---
I would recommend: (chose 3 on top of ruin)  
---
Monitor and Abuse  
---
Sloppy Butcher  
---
Save the Best for last  
---
Bamboozle  
---
BBQ  
---
Enduring  
---
Spirit Fury (only use that one in combination with Enduring)  
---
NOED  
---
Nurse Calling  
---
Whispers  
---
Brutal Strength  
---
Damn beat me to it
---
exiting the game is not an escape...
---
I have a tip and am not colorblind if you play on pc, there is still a way to use nvidia freestyle otherwise gl my dude
---
You could also say  
---
"Dont waste another 2 Minute chasing the same dude if that means losing 2 more Gens after he dsed and get your gen controll back"
---
Both are shitty unbalanced perks. BUT! One DS is only dangerous if the survivor is really good vs a killer  that gets looped without gameplan/gern controll, while doing all totems in a non swf comp is a job not as easy as it sounds and some Killers really should try that for themselfs. And it does give the Killer the Option to play like a Potato all game and in worst case still win. 
---
The choice to not give them auras is mindboggling. If they wanted them to be a truly enticing anti-camping measure they should make sure killers are able to actually know where are they are, and not just stumble upon them like survivors' personal hex totems.
---
That's not how it works with DS 90% of the time and you know it. DS can extend a chase by several minutes that you don't have. Even if you have Enduring, Enduring is only a soft counter. You don't have to pretend like DS does almost nothing to push a narrative. 
---
It is unless you unironically chased a surv for multiple mins, in which case you're bad which also makes your statement questionable at best.
---
Sloppy Butcher (Wraith) breaking the game for survs is okay. Free points though? That crosses the line
---
I'd be Hulk after one game
---
Even if every single game you see all generators done, but don't escape with a vessel, it will take you 225 games to get all 9 coins. Which you won't. So you're looking at 500ish games in 2 weeks to finish the event. It seems easy now, wait til it takes 500+ points to get a coin, then come back and tell us how easy it is.

I will give you SWF being a huge disadvantage to the killer but im talking solo queue. Im gonna just agree to disagree on this one. No use going back and forth.  Happy hunting for you.

Don‚Äôt flatter me with calling me young, son.  Only stupid people assume that being a ‚Äúkiddo‚Äù is something bad.
---
i'd have to do at least 20 push ups every round i'd play
---
Feng was cute enough as it is :/
---
As a killer who doesn't care too much about the cosmetics and is just trying to play normal games the amount of DCs is fucking staggering to me too. They aren't people who just want to farm either, they're bringing in really good add-ons and map offerings and just DCing after their first down. The mind boggles.

honestly fuck the L2/R2 character switch. it's not convenient, it's inconvenient. just delete it, don't even put the time into letting people disable it because it'll be a year for BHVR to figure out how

*nea*
---
Why is it such a big deal to so much as mention bugs/glitches or exploits. I‚Äôm having to resubmit posts like five fricking times before the automod oks it
---
TIL u can even compare those 2 ok
---
you can play around both pretty easily so no neither should be removed
---
My friend is colourblind and said that messing around with Nvidia Freestyle helped him see scratchmarks and auras.
---
you are very off base. If i spend 30 seconds to hit you, and then leave, and you spent 30 seconds to heal up, you have come out on top, especially if I haven't gotten another hit in that 30 seconds. Any time I waste lessens my chances of winning. 30 seconds of your time is easily made up. On the flip side, If i spend more then about a minute and a half and I do catch you, you have come out on top anyways, because 90 seconds is another gen that is done. I hope now you understand what I am saying.

It be like that sometimes. In time you will likely come to see things my way. Happy hunting to you too.
---
It has been ever since emblems
---
That is exactly what she was planning on doing tbh.
---
You underestimate my power
---
Me when I remember I had a cypress mori but already hooked the last survivor 
---
comparing BBQ and WGLF. I like the meme
---
Coming from survivor main remove DS and decrease NOED movement speed 
---
Very well said and with no bias I like it. Only bit I would add that I was disappointed with was the lack of lore this time. In the hallowed blight the unfolding story as the event went on gave it an interesting twist and made it seem more relevant than they just glossed up some gens and hooks. 
---
It's so bad
---
Hag and Trapper already are pretty heavily countered by just paying attention, you do not even need Small Game, I get what you are saying and a small buff to the perk would be nice. But I would rather have bonus BP for cleansing and disarming and maybe even do it a bit faster.
---
Same thing happened to me but vs leather. I blamed the ping that time but this post surprised me
---
being solo ps4 I am finding them now and with a friend at same rank  i am now 100 out of 700 for the 7th one
---
Your perks stay offerings are a one time use and items can be used more times if you survive and not fully use it
---
When you had enough of its NOED
---
There's also the fact that it doesn't work if you change the running key.
---
Everytime someone puts a map offering for the Haddonfield map, I assume he did that just for hearing the loud Halloween theme at the start of the game hahaha
---
That's playing around Nurse's Calling
---
Is Dwight the Shaggy version in Dead By Daylight?

---
I might have read wrong because i dont quite understand you, but what i can say from what i think youre asking is that everything you do with the bloodweb or whatever you want to call it will always be saced, so if you unlock a perk from there you will be able to use it all the time untill you prestige the character
---
Huntress didn't kill young girls. She stole them from their parents but she doesn't know how to take care of them so they die of hunger or Diseases.
---
Ah, a fellow Joey+ Smiling mask main too. Respect.
---
It would be a lot funnier if you didn't have big red circles over the obviously important information 
---
Bonus BP is nice, but what I really think would actually benefit Small Game is a little token counter beside it that shows how many totems are left in the level.  That way you aren't scanning the whole map for that one final totem when someone's already taken care of it.
---
thanks! 
---
Actually, if your teammate escapes with the lantern and you're alive, you get 45 points, so it really doesn't pit survivors against each other at all. 
---
i see, ty! 
---
So many anti-survivor posts in the forum and on reddit...We must be awful creatures.
---
this is some wholesome jack.
---
Oh! Nice! 
---
In my downtime I've been working on making little animated gifs to eventually all loop all together to make a loading screen intro in reference to those like in gta4. 
---
 I'llprobably end up using this one too, but here's one i did recently of the best nea cosmetic
---
[https://i.imgur.com/5GfvkvG.gifv](https://i.imgur.com/5GfvkvG.gifv)
---
You can disable late game chat... or just leave.
---
Probably fake just saying, but yeah.... fake
---
Now you are just making assumptions. Why would you resort to ad hominem when you could easily discuss whatever point you are trying to make? It just makes you look bad.
---
I feel that sometimes, but teabagging *is* toxic. I'm only toxic in return and most times I still don't camp or hit on hook or whatever. I do get tempted when I'm in a chase and they stun me like 3 times though, not going to lie...that shit pisses me off sometimes lol. I don't camp or anything though because it technically wasn't toxic, just rage inducing lol
---
Any of those exhaustion perks you listed out would be better than Bond. Sprint burst is pretty good because you can evade the killer when they're coming towards you fixing a gen. Dead hard can get you to a loop/pallet safely or save you a pallet, and adrenaline is amazing. Adren is probably the best perk in the game, I'd put it over DS honestly. But I would say use sprint burst or dead hard since you have self care already.
---
Ah then I am not sure, probably a bug
---
Take my upvote and leave!
---
There was nothing in your post about gameplay, though.
---
People who suggest to run Fire Up are disqualified from giving advice on killer. Monitor and Abuse is pretty good on Myers, but not even close to be a must have. Ruin is a must have, MaA isn't.
---
I think I found a new bug, either that or they nerfed Darnboy again.
---
If there is more than one person asleep on the same generator, one person failing the skillcheck will wake up *everyone else* on the gen along with you.
---
Why not replace saboteur or self care with a med kit or a toolbox
---
Your pixel art is kinda awesome though... You can clearly see the effort
---
You definitely ain't kidding about the ridiculous advantage of swf lol.  I was playing with my buddy earlier today in a 2 man against a baby legion.  He was rank 2 but you could tell he was still learning the killer.  I spent most of the game running him and was on death hook.  I eventually went down at a pallet.  I told my injured friend to hide for the pallet save. Told him exactly when to throw it he got hit through it getting downed but still got the save.  The moment I hit the ground the last gen popped and we both adrenalined off like racecars with him getting picked off the ground.  On the one hand it was clutch and funny as fuck but honestly I did feel bad about it too.  The communication and coordination potential of swf is stupid as hell lol.  Killers have to sweat overtime to overcome this and really work for their wins.  It is a massive advantage and anyone that under sells the impact of swf is kidding themselves.
---
wait, is this JonTron??
---
its easier but the grind is A LOT longer. Pick your poison.
---
That was good in fairness to you
---
The grind is meant to be long to give you incentive to skip the grind and pay for what you want instead.
---
no, it's fixed. but thing is it was present for 1.5 months. and they only fixed it with midchapter patch. 
---
He probably is refering to "Making the game hostage", but you staying there isn't making the game hostage at any point, he is just being a salty boi.
---
Yeah
---
tbf, legion is a pain in the ass tho. a infinite-t3+tombstone myers is more fun than that, hell mirror scratch even
---
Well it is very good perk.....Gotta earn that bloodpoints for my add ons.
---
Most killers suck. And sucky killers camp. And I think events bring out more sucky players. Not a bad thing that more inexperienced people play the game, but unfortunately their play style is lame to go against.
---
Sounds like this guy stays close to the hooks. He's not gonna get much out of MYC.
---
Then pm me.Im kinda curious.
---
I think this is funny
---
Anyone that teabags at pallets deserves whatever the kill does when he gets them
---
I think the rewards are ok its the event thats underwhelming.
---
Increasing the number of tickets given in bloodwebs woukd be a good starr, as woukd giving a BO increase so lvl 50 players can more easily get those tickets.
---
Right now you're lucky to get 2 per game. Also killer permanently destroying them? Not right fair. Let them respawn after a minte or so. That way survivors have a chance to escape with them all game, and killers can keep destroying them for points.
---
Yaint wrong
---
No to a why question, ok dude
---
I was playing my baby nurse and came across a trio of survivors who were ‚Äúbasement security‚Äù. We memed around in the basement and we added each other as steam friends and swf all the time!
---
Haha, Munich here. Yesterday one Russian translated some mysterious words from another Russian for me, saying that I am a bloody bastard xD love the community.
---
i First thought huntress was a typo and you meant to write leatherface bc this looks like le bubba
---
Yeah, but I don't think the killer should be punished to make up for survivors making bad decisions. 
---
By camping they are in fact wasting their own time
---
How‚Äôd you do that?! 
---
Ah, i just found it in a discord group im in
---
I think you forgot to put a "/s" at the end there, bud.
---
i knew the hitboxes seemed odd 
---
No, but Zarya is.
---
Looool I was so scared
---
yeah Huntress especially
---
Lol yeah, but there are some pretty good moments that really make this game worth it. 
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. If I notice one strong survivors who's skills far outmatched the rest I focus the weaker parts of the team instead. Going for the weakest link first is the best way to force the great players to make mistakes which I then can abuse. 
---
If you spend minutes chasing the same skilled guy then the rest of the team has free access to gens.
---
Muda muda muda!
---
BHVR fucked up the game so hard that the optimal play is to now go for medium vaults to exploit buggy hitboxes in your favor instead lmao
---
Give me dedicated servers so I dont lag the game for everyone and Ill main killer.
---
Ive been getting much more than that i've been getting 45 a game as survivor it's got to be a glitch.
---
UEHVUEH UEH UEH UUEH
---
Seven seconds after the get off the hook you hit them. No borrowed time, no bodyblocking, it's his own personal nightmare.
---
she hot tho
---
im talking about the first part.
---
lmao that ending
---
I wouldn‚Äôt use ds, cause it‚Äôs only one time, and you might miss it. If you are going to use self care, use after care so you can see everyone and they can see you, so they can gen rush.
---
What perks do you run as Survivor/Killer?
---
I went through a phase where the perks I was running were shite bit I thought that they were helping me
---
"Vacuums" are normal. Every video game snaps you into the place when beginning an animation sequence.
---
In this case, there's a radius around the hook which when you stand in it, the "[SPACE] Hook" prompt comes up.  You're hooked when the killer presses Space, not when the animation starts.
---
Perks not only stay but have a chance to be upgraded when you use bloodpoints to level up your character as well as having a chance of better rarity items as you progress and when you prestige it reverts you to level one gives that character higher chances of getting better stuff and a part of a outfit (to prestige you need to reach level 50) the shards which are the blue thing in the top right you can use to 1 unlock characters 2 buy outfits 3 buy something call teachable perks (a perk that when you learn it it can appear in other peoples blood we be) for instance if I buy sprint burst by getting meg to level 35 and buying it then that means I can go to feng and give her sprint burdt
---
Borrowed time and body blocking don't work against freddy. If only they removed the glitches autotarget that takes you to hit an awake survivor.
---
Yeah.
---
I mean I understand why they dodge and normally its not too much of an issue but man is it fucking annoying while survivor queues are broken.
---
I've been taking the lobby I get to do my part in helping the situation....unless its some P3 Nea or Claudette  with a username like "toxic fucker". In which case you deserve to sit and wait in a queue.
---
Cause nobody wants to deal with the pain of being a console Killer 
---
Because it‚Äôs not fucking worth it. 2 points per hook? 3 points if you actually manage to find and break one lamp in time and they don‚Äôt get a rescue? While with survivor you can just pop gens for 4 points and constantly get 45s when other escape with the lamp.
---
Best Combo with other stand [ The Basements] Non can escape that 
---
I think it's the same for when you pallet a killer and they get sucked into the pallet drop. The hit box is just weird sometimes and you get sucked into it. 
---
Perks will definitely help you. If you aren‚Äôt the best in chases, there‚Äôs two things you can do: Get better at being chased (practise, watching streamers/youtubers), or go with a stealthy build. Killer is also just a lot of practise, and a bit of knowledge towards the perks. Find a killer you are comfortable with and get the best perks on him/her
---
Yeah wtf tbh
---
How can you beat up an ace who has a smile?
---
As of when? Cause around 12hrs ago it still worked for me
---
That's called "The Peoples Elbow"
---
That‚Äôs my mindset when I play killer, good pallets gone, easy game from now on
---
I started then and everything since has been underwhelming
---
4-5 hours ago
---
It is actually a way to think about it. They throw their whole game just because you destroyed them. It‚Äôs not a loss on your part
---
Exactly this. Pressing M1 on a gen, even the worst survivors can do. Theres no difference between a bad and a good survivor on a gen.
---
Chases however, end much faster against bad survivors.
---
I think the same, it will fix some issues but not every.
---
Games usually "favor the shooter/attacker" so the killer will still get a hit even if it seems impossible from the survivors side.
---
No, that was definitely his point, that he DCs when he knows it's a legion.
---
But you still have to use it because it really helps when you need that little push to make it to a pallet or the exit gate or when you're escaping the basement from a camping killer...I love it so much when it works and hate it so much when it doesn't :')
---
I actually think killers should go on strike for 24 hours. Let's see how much fun survivors have then.
---
Did you see anything informative?
---
/r/dbdgonewild
---
Exactly this event will be painful, looking forward to things going back to normal. 
---
Why would you NOT?
---
Would be nice if it was erotic too. 
---
I think he‚Äôs just highlighting how ‚Äòun-fun‚Äô it is to play against Legion. That‚Äôs his point. 
---
They can't, because of the DS. You gotta wait for the skillscheck to appear and go away to be able to wiggle.
---
they are only fixing it cause it makes them lose money, other game breaking bugs can wait I guess
---
This needs to be a Perk... "When in a chase, survivors auras within 12m are revealed to you, passing within 5m of a fellow survivor causes a Speed boost up to 150%" 
---
Perks name would be "Good luck, bitch!"
---
So close...to being halfway to your first outfit. :(
---
Dude, I LOVE moth memes, thanks for this masterpiece! I actually changed my steam name yesterday to "Moth" and also changed my profile pic + description.
---
I'm also thinking about a nice fitting perk build lol
---
I mean, skillchecks are fucking easy
---
He‚Äôs still *leaning* the role. 
---
This is what happens when you study the pebble 
---
this is not related, but i wanted to thank everyone in this community, as bad as the game community is and how toxic people are in it, surprisingly this community is positive and non toxic and very responsive, i deeply wanna say thank you to everyone who cooperated on my posts &lt;3
---
He just started a gaming channel on YouTube so
---
hey anarchy o/ 
---
When you injure someone and they go self-care, it takes 30+ seconds since you might be running Sloppy you will have 1 less person on gens, you can go find others to injure/down.
---
In the time it takes for someone to complete a self-heal you should have another one in chase, or even on a hook. 
---
Each time you injure someone and they go heal, they're effectively useless for their team. A hook + dude self caring in a corner of the map leaves only 1 dude on gens, so you can either go slug the one healing, look for the dude coming to save or go find the one working on the gen, effectively dropping all gen-progress, if you can keep rotating this then you can easily win.
---
SC is a weak perk because it encourages the type of playstyle that negatively affects the survs, they might be greedier when it comes to taking hits because they can just SC, but each SC is 30+ seconds, so you get to put survs off gens more and can apply pressure when someone else is sitting in a corner.
---
If you complain about SC you're delusional, because it's a lot harder to play vs a team where no one has it, because they have actually good perks in their slots. Self Care makes the game easier to manage for the killer. 
---
\o
---
Yep they did yesterday
---
i remember seeing a survivor unironically suggest guns
---
It's random so yeah
---
Lol she killed little girls by herself even if it wasn't intentional
---
Hanlon's razor is more likely.
---
Fr tho
---
When bing bong cunt got buffed.
---
If this happens I get really furious and ends up with me tunneling him until he fucking dies on the hook
---
I don't like being camped, but I don't really care all that much at the end of the day. A lot of times I'll teabag a pallet to entice the killer to stay on me rather than stop the chase and start going after gens. Sometimes this works, sometimes the killers are smart and leave the chase. 
---
It takes me 20 minutes to find a lobby on ps4 as a survivor. Killer? 2 minutes. 
---
The past 3 patches are either "How the fuck couldn't hit me!?" or "How the fuck did he hit me!?"
---
There were moments that killer's weapon went through me and there were moments that killer injured me after the attack animation.
---
suffer for your crimes
---
I've stopped questioning it at this point.
---
I saw him in my peripheral vision as soon as I released my blink
---
At least ‚ÄòDark Sense‚Äô saved ur ass. GG
---
The amount of points needed to get a coin increases with every coin earned. It's 100 points for 1 coin, 200 points for the second one, 300 points for the third and so on...
---
I'm just unlocking the survivors' skins since I have the Hollowed Blight set for The Huntress and already got 5 peaces in ~20 hours
---
. Just imagine grinding 900 points for the last peace!
---
Well apparently it's not working. I'm getting teammates that are either more concerned about laterns then saving teammates or teammates that just rush to the lanterns and walk around walking for the rest to finish the gens. 
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for the Dead or Daylight beach volleyball spinoff. ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
I only play it for the jet skis though.
---
That‚Äôs a bummer. Survivors will no longer be teammates (if they were already)
---
Ooooooh, im so sorry, I just started earning points yesterday! Good luck with that last one xd
---
I'm having fun. ü§∑
---
I'd call it a spinoff?
---
They could bump up the ranks from 20 to 50 and also make the punishment for doing bad in a game harsher. That way getting to high ranks would actually mean something. 
---
You bring up interesting points, but you don't get three things: One, survivors are not on a time limit, they can waste 30 seconds and be fine. I can halt all gen progress but one bad call and survivors have the upper hand again. Two, you are not always going to get another survivor in 30 seconds, and three it isn't just self care that is the problem. I agree in a vacuum self care is no big deal. But it coupled with the other factors I mentioned is just one big mess.
---
I never realized the doctor was black
---
The stagger reduction only "helps" on very specific loops.
---
It does nothing on maps like shelter woods, gas heaven, fractured cowshed. The fact that it is so map based makes it bad, and the passive effect really doesn't help that much.
---
Make him say darn too
---
This has been done before and I don't understand what's good about playing a shitty character.
---
Get the l√§mps brudha.
---
tbh Noed nor ds should be in the game :     ^)
---
Gesundheit 
---
Unfortunately not. To make myself feel better, I hope on killer and go after those who do those "risky unhooks" 
---
You can almost report them for working with the killer but it's a tough call
---
I swear I'm the only person getting fast games with no worse lag than usual.
---
I mean, I was playing yesterday after work at 4 and my first two coins by 10.
---
Yeah, but what if people don't want to play killer or don't want to keep playing with people they got paired up with?
---
I do. Although I find this event really hard, I‚Äôm still going to grind it. I mean, I‚Äôm a killer main, even if this event‚Äôs hardest side is the killer, I‚Äôm not going to give up anyways. I wish other killers main would not stop playing just because it‚Äôs harder
---
ZA WARUDO!

I usually don't destroy the last l√§mp  and let a survivor escape with it. Survivor get a much more from it than I do.
---
Am I the only one who likes going against the legion? I think the only bad thing about him is that players can abuse the chase mechanics to make deepwound timer go down. He isn't hard to go against unless he has specific addons/abuses the mechanics. I find the fun in the fact that he can't see scratch marks in frenzy, giving you room to out play him, and you can deplete his meter by stunning. I don't know,  I just think the hate is undeserved for the edgy teens in my opinion
---
yea Huntresses and wraiths for me 
---
Ditch sabouteur.Useless perk.
---
Stop dodging.
---
It takes Survivors 15+ minutes to find a match. If you judt dodge, you are screwing them out of the chance to play.
---
Without clues, there was no way to tell if that was a joke or not imo
---
Well the killer isn't made of shit so... you're being to critical. 
---
I play both sides and i would say killers easily get double the BP..  maybe even more. I think the real question is should survivors get as many BP as killer?
---
You even made the doctors eyes off putting in pixel form, man they creep me out, like staaring into my soul. Well done OP have some karma
---
I‚Äôm a competitive fighting game player, as my first passion. I also got started in the arcades. DBD is what I do to unwind after a practice grind. In short, I absolutely adore this. Thank you for your service
---
Sprint burst, the perk that makes you walk everywhere.
---
subtle way to derank I guess.
---
I literally played Nurse with 4 blinks and gigantic Range with an Ebony and The Game Map.
---
I think the survivors wanted to unninstall after that.
---
&gt; I keep getting caught in chases
---
That's normal. It's about how long you can keep that chase going that matters.
---
Okay let me repeat my statement. All survivors in my lobby have a 400+ connection when I play killer during the event. I don‚Äôt want to force survivors to endure an awful match because BHVR can‚Äôt fix their game. If they want to play and stutter and rubber band the entire match, that‚Äôs on them. I thought I was in the right to dodge because of their connections 
---
Should be in r/neakarlsson üòç
---
30 minutes just to find a match with some fucker from asia
---
I had a game yesterday where I picked it up at the start and literally never got hit, held it all game and escaped. Hardly any bp compared to old ones. It's a joke.
---
Killer is far more consistent, you won‚Äôt have any chance to reach a maximum but a solid 25-30 per game is fine. 
---

I‚Äôm running Brutal Strength + Enduring + Spirit Fury to eat pallets for breakfast and force ppl to take the paths I trapped.

Bbq for bloodpoints, if you don‚Äôt care about bbq I‚Äôd take bamboozle as well. 
---
Imagine this but Shirtless Myers... OwO
---
How dare you insult the glory of B I N G  B O N G?!
---
If it‚Äôs ever a survivor that‚Äôs pointing and teabagging, I like to *BING BONG* in chase
---
and everyone who isnt playing an asian character shouldnt be allowed to play during the event
---
*Grooses theme plays*
---
You should be happy you didnt do the howling grounds event. It. Was so bad. ( if a killer picked someone up they could get flashlighted at any point.
---
Irreproachable tournament, unchallenging. 
---
I imagine some lad in a smoking with a handlebar mustache. 
---
&gt; * a Bill sabotaging hooks instead of just doing the gens
---
Could have gotten the ritual, which is super easy to complete.
---
&gt; * people just disconnecting 30 seconds into the match as soon as they get downed
---
Happens even when there aren't events.
---
Meters? Well you probably don‚Äôt need a scale. Bbq is great for this achievement. All‚Äôs you have to do is hit someone unhooking or snipe someone on a gen. The achievement is somewhat of a slog but it‚Äôs not to bad.
---
If no one burned an offering, 2 "default" vessels are untouchable for survivors.
---
If killer didn't burn offering, he can't break vessels.
---
I'm going for this one as well. You can try using perks like nurse's calling at tier 2 or 3. Once you see their aura you know you're at 24 or 28 meters.  You can run deer stalker level 2 to confirm if it was over 24 meters too
---
And I'm not a teen, I'm a 30 something man that likes the chess game of counter play,  not an m1 borrowed time deep wounds mechanic. 
---
Smh you gotta use bone clapper and coxcombed clapper

---
YOU LIAR!
---
There are more players playing survivors than killers because it's easier to get points for the event as a survivor. If there is only a handfull of killers online it's almost impossible to start a game. The devs should either increase the amount of points killers get or some players that don't really care about the event should play a few rounds as killers instead.
---
i really really really hope youre joking
---
I've had teamates using bond do this to me in the past. 
---
I am an altruistic player, but if you try to bait me on purpose imma focus more on gens
---
Some of you care way too much about defending the internet honour of someone that is indifferent to your existence. 
---
That's the same dlc that gave us Decisive Strike, it's obvious they don't know shit.
---
I was punished fairly. This was from my earlier days though, I know now how important the shack is.
---
I power through Ruin personally. Sometimes I like the challenge, sometimes I hate it. 
---
28 meters is in your terror radius so thats how i think about it
---
Good child
---
That is the joke 
---
I agree. It feels really fucking cheap.
---
I blame the devs for making tickets harder to get. They should be more common like petals.
---
It was very humorous
---
Ha
---
Go commit p3 nurse as survivor 
---
Exactly. I'm barely 20 and I've seen all those movies a ton of times 
---
Nah, game is constantly getting better and growing bigger, just take a look at the steam charts. 
---
What‚Äôs wrong with bing bong boi?

---
Lol. If you give her the red peony hair, Phoenix rises polo, and the comfy track pants, (I think that's what they're called) she looks like one of those women who would ask for your manager after offering an expired coupon.
---
From my perspective the survivors are evil!
---
I need something to slow down the early game so I can set up my traps and not have 2 gens done already. Ruin is probably the best thing for this but that‚Äôs kind of a given. 
---
Dedicated servers won‚Äôt fix bugs or bad internet though. 
---
Pretty good job... So far ;)
---
I've essentially been sandbagged more as of late than I have over the last like 6 months combined
---
Claudette and Nea.
---
After this fucking event, 20 to 30 minutes
---
I usually solve this by addons (faster traps and bags) so I start with 2-3 traps and can set them quickly (or even in a big loop). 
---
I hate myself for this, but whenever I read Vessel I think boar vessel 600-500 bc etruscan ceramic on impulse. I don't even find that meme funny and it's so annoying that my brain is doing this to me. Can't they just call it a lantern for my sanitys sake?
---
Unless you are in Yamaoka map?
---
30 mins then immediately get dodged.
---
3 seconds, and with some left turn right turn, I don't see why the billy cannot catch up.
---
upvote for the humor.
---
lol that killer is funny
---
When Freddie's buff he needs
---
I don't think DL is necessarily that good, a lot of the time by the time obsession has died there's only like 1-2 gens left unless you find them very quickly at the start and tunnel the poor guy to oblivion.
---
But yeah it's probably pretty annoying for the obsession as the killer will always go for you for example if there's 2 survivors both running in opposite directions, making your match annoying as hell.
---

---
Wait till you see what is the exercise for killer hooking survivors...
---
Or at the very least just remove categories of bloodpoint gains. If a survivor gets chased all game, he'll get 8K points, because he couldn't touch gens or perform altruistic actions, and he will most likely die, meaning 8K is all he gets, out of 32K possible(Though really, this should be more like 28K since you cannot get survival points for anything except self caring/escaping and self caring grants a total of 300. You probably won't self care more than 3 times tops, especially not with how common sloppy butcher is)
---
my god, they made LF and freddy viable 
---
more healing time, YAY just what we wanted.  Its sad that you cannot mind game the Legion at all.

AND I CANT GET BARBECUE FROM THE SHRINE
---
OH.
---
Tell me about it. 900 hours so far and of all my survivors, I only have Dwight, Meg, Jake, Claudette, David, Nea, Feng prestige 3 lvl 50
---
Something that helped me with the grind was using "we're gonna live forever" - i do miss the days when it was 200% extra bp instead of the now 100%
---
Had to go to like bloodpoint nr. 90 to get ruin T3 on my hag. Fun times
---
Pillar Men Theme starts playing
---
Really?
---
A bad match is still better than no match at all, though.

If you want to ensure players have a good match, farm with them.
---
AND I CANT GET BARBECUE FROM THE SHRINE.
---
I want to know what he was smoking
---
You had to have a prestige level before the bloodweb change which happened like 2 years ago
---
People that actually play that sabotage ritual instead of binning it are absolute trash, especially as it's only worth 20000 bp.
---
I would have his power be like Myers, which every hit you get bath in blood and you have a blood meter, and once that blood meter is full you transform. Or some shit like that.
---
Well, well, well....
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Legacy_Prestige
---
 they could give players prizes for winning games on high ranks so that it would actually be cool and rewarding to be at rank 1. Also there could be an endorsement system where if you played fair and weren't toxic other players could give you points that you could cash in for cosmetics and cool stuff like that. 
---
This honestly looks more like lag than anything. The D-strike not going off instantly and the spastic movement after the vault just straight up looks like 400+ ping
---
In dbd it doesn't seem to matter if they *actually* hit you. If you are in their cone of vision and they swing it usually registers as a hit. At least in my exp. I also hate how chainsaws clip through windows and other props and only get caught on rocks sometimes. Like. Thats super inconsistent and unrealistic. If someone vaults a window they shouldn't be killed by the phantom chainsaw deciding when to phase into objects and when not to. 
---
Its kind of like how some props don't let huntress hatchets clip through but I saw a guy get downed because they clipped through a car and hit him
---
I was on top of a mound, and got hit by a Billy that came revving in beside me at ground level. I was above his head and off to his side on top of the mound and he was on the ground.
---
Nope. You can see it's still lit up. If D-strike is used, it'll gray out
---
Yeah that was my first thought, but with the transformation being automatic I thought it would bring a mechanic of timing your hits/hooks to maintain beast form as long as you can and being as aggresive as possible
---
Fuckin amazing, you deserve that gold u got
---

Solo, i mean. Without friends
---
That sounded like it would've been a fun game but I really hate killers like that. 
---
I'm also trying to do this achievement but it's stupidly hard to do it...
---
It's 24m DOWN hits... which means survivors already have to be injured to count or you need to get one shot hatchets addons (and if you do so...  survivors will DC when they know you're using this addon so it doesn't help much with this achievement...). Also depending on the map you're playing on, you will have almost no possibility to snipe survivors working on gens.
---
For distance indicators, you can use Deerstalker or Nurse calling (both rank 2) you could also use Devour Hope that will give you 24 meters from the hook
---
The best map to do it are The Pale Rose (Backwater Swamp) and Rotten Fields (Colwind Farm)
---
I believe that a good way to do it is using Surveillance, BBQ &amp; Chili, Tinkerer &amp; Discordance.
---
These perks allow you to easily tracks survivors on gens allowing you to try snipe shots.
---
You could also try to use only Hex perks with Thrill of the Hunt. to try to snipe them when they try to destroy your totems (I'm thinking of Huntress Lullaby or Ruin, Thrill of the Hunt, Devour Hope and Haunted Ground that way you have 5 hex totems on the map) but sometimes totem placements don't allow you to have easy shots (except maybe on Coldwin Farm maps when the totem is right in the middle of corn) so I believe it's better to track survivors working on generators.
---
Another way to do it is to camp the hooked survivors from distance (with Devour Hope for distance measurement). You should also go a bit further than 24 meters to avoid the rescuing survivor to be able to hear your lullaby. It's not a very nice tactic for survivors but it should work well (in case survivors are not SWF...)
---
She can see through the little cracks in the mask where the braces stitch it together, the cracks are honestly probably wider than the tiny holes in frank/Julie‚Äôs masks tbh
---
Ok.
---
same thing happened to me yesterday it was wild
---
To see how close those other damn kids are to his basement 
---
I did pretend to do gens, yes!! 
---
‚ÄúHe has shown flaws and glitches that were fault of the devs‚Äù Bet if any other person uploaded them they would get mad as fuck at them and would want them banned
---
No you! 
---
For real, I don't know how they made hit boxes even worse, but they're even worse. Last night I was running along a wall from a killer and I turned at the edge of the wall and ran up the other side while the killer swung on the other side of the wall. The hit connected. I was literally beside the killer, with a wall between us when the hit connected. Ridiculous.
---
He‚Äôs not super great
---
I don‚Äôt get why KlautusHam was downvoted, he‚Äôs right. This community is so weird sometimes. 
---
again, thats wrong, if you kill all 4 survivors with 5 gens remaining you did a pretty good job, even though you dont get many bloodpoints
---
*beast noises*
---
Ditch Sabo and Self care, both perks are a waste of time now. Bond can let you find another suvivors to heal you faster and it grants you valuable information like where survivors are being chased and etcetera.
---
Run iron will too, being quiet in a game were killers can have lots of information thanks to sounds is very important. Also run an exhaustion perk, id recommend Balanced landing, it lets you save it while you run across the map and opens new loops.
---
So run: DS, Bond, BL, IW
---
I once got called shit for "following me into the basement when I was trying to unhook".
---
I swear sometimes they're playing a different game than I am.
---
(Obligatory comment that, yes, killers can be just as delusional towards survivors.)
---
not what I mean, like, zapping has never really been a sign of anger, you do it for bp or for insanity or to meme or to stop them from vaulting or something
---
It took a lot of restraint not to kill the people I knew were toxic from previous games with them, Haha. But, I feel that with how the event is, it's maybe nice to help sometimes! 
---
I may do this every event from now on, just on a different killer so people don't expect it! But... maybe the same one, because I like Piggy... -and Adventure time was a cute little show! 
---
Thank you so much!
---
The event maps would be cool but it takes a while to design those maps and they don‚Äôt really have the manpower to spread themselves that thin on top of designing the next chapter and doing big fixes, optimization, etc. 
---
As far as the cosmetics being purchasable, it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs so much of em. In the past events the grind was much more manageable and in turn we only got like one limited time thing. With the hallowed blight you couldn‚Äôt even get all the cosmetics from playing the event because they did 7 whole outfits, and this event is one hell of a grind for 3 whole outfits. Some people do t have the time to play this game nonstop or for 3 hours each day of the event just so they can get 4500 points and so it makes sense to have them purchasable. 
---
Seriously tho, I don‚Äôt get why people like to say ‚ÄúBHVR is just trying to get us to spend a bunch of money and they‚Äôre really greedy hurr durr‚Äù, they don‚Äôt have to release as many cosmetics as they have been recently. I‚Äôd agree if they gave out like 2 cosmetics and made them 2000 points each and purchasable but we‚Äôre getting three whole outfits. It makes sense that there‚Äôll be an immense grind that rewards the really dedicated players by not forcing them to pay and allows the people that don‚Äôt have the time to play nonstop to still enjoy the cosmetics if they want them.
---
Needs that 25% if someone is stupid enough to come down into the basement
---
It would be a safe bet that if you had let them unhook they would've flamed you for being shit and not guarding.
---
Some people just like the fire.
---
It‚Äôs really first come first serve man. I know that sucks but that‚Äôs pretty much how everyone in the game acts regardless of whether you burned an offering or not. 
---
"hey you're walking around that's not allowed"
---
grown women with grown women beards
---
How kind of him! Some people think that Killers are just butts, but I've run into so many killers in my nearly 1k hours playing the game that will have mercy when the entity deals you a crappy hand. (Aka, your selfish teammates leaving you to dead!)
---
I hope you run into someone more kind soon! 
---
That's sweet on ya to help regardless buddy. :)
---
Though even as a survivor I find friendly killer interactions weird and awkward, hell it makes me feel like a person who's never experienced love. XD
---
I wish I had a Playstation! But alas, I am PC only. 
---
I'm so glad! 
---
With my stand power,„ÄåNo One Escapes Death„Äç, I am unbeatable!
---
For every prestiege cosmetic you had before November 2016 you got a legacy version of it.
---
As to why it's because BPs were capped at 500k, rituals were harder and gave jack shit and bloodwebs took way longer to so, so they rewarded everyone who grinded through that cancer.
---
You can play against any killer! Some killers just aren't as popular as others, so they're much more rare to see, unfortunately. :(
---
But bing bong cunt hurts bing bong‚Äôs feelings
---
Sometimes it just feels good to be nice! 
---
Oof.
---
He needs more buffs. Cause he is the cutest cutie of all killers.
---
We are few and far between, but I have seen a few take up the mantle! Hopefully you run into one!
---
If the getting all the coins didn‚Äôt take 4500 points then I‚Äôd be playing killer but I ain‚Äôt on break and I only have so much time I can spend playing this game, so I need to play survivor because you get the points twice as fast and I kinda need that efficiency 
---
Yeah ofc but I've noticed it happening a lot in lower ranks (16-20) and they've always been toxic/insulting in the chat after. I also kinda notice it from their gameplay tbh if they're annoyed. Nothing says pissed off as a doctor who lets all the gens get finished just because he needs to kill YOU üòÇ
---
The devs already said that No Mither is supposed to be a hard mode and that its not gonna be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù
---
Like sometimes I try to be cute you know and I think they just take it as toxicity but I'm just not really that toxic to killers cuz I know it can be hard. Although after I posted this I was playing my newly perked up Ace and this Mike meyers saw me being cute and he let me go after he had an infinite all game and then we became friends so finally had a good game
---
But you do know that you don't have to escape with it to get the points, right? If one gets out with it, everyone who is still alive also gets the 25 points.
---
Possibly, when I go into rank 8-3 it can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 15 for a game, just for the killer to leave when it‚Äôs not full.
---
Thrillbilly Express
---
I mean, I dunno about you, but I tunnel most of my obsessions in life.
---
Getting a 4K before the killer can. 
---
Oh I see. May I ask you why do you want all the coins? Are you a colletionist, or you simply main all of them? I‚Äôm getting only Feng because she‚Äôs my main surivor and the only surv I play
---
Duuude I met Basement Security a little over a year ago. Good guy
---
It‚Äôs because people are playing her since she gets a new skin except they aren‚Äôt as good with her as a killer they usually play so they get genrushed and then camp as a response to do damage control
---
That's not even the worst part the worst part is when they hide in lockers to avoid you killing them and getting the achievement
---
Patch 2.5.3 - 31 January 2019  
---
BUG FIXES  
---
  
---
Fixed an issue that caused Survivors to obtain progress on the Lunar Event objective if a different Survivor would escape with a Vessel.
---
When you que into a match and see 3 P3 Claudette‚Äôs and a legacy Dwight and you get hit by 4 decisive in the game
---
This new Feng cosmetic has awakened something in all of us
---
Supposedly they are tracking it and ban those who DC too often, how much is too often is the real question.
---
I'm going to use this as an excuse for my terrible tracking skills
---
'ez baby killer'
---
"I CAN'T SEE THROUGH THIS MASKKKK"
---
What annoys me is losing a pip when the killer dcs :(
---
as if you‚Äôll play 225 games without getting a vessel lmfao
---
Really? The 4500 points you have to grind for aren't enough, now we even have to get out by ourself?
---
What a joke of developers.
---
He was awfully polite in the after game chat.
---
hitboxes in this game are complete bullshit. they just make it worse with every patch. I will never buy auric cells again.
---
It's patched now only the actual vessel escaping get the 25 points. 
---
[Proceeds to spend an hour dying to Bubba before someone realizes the stands weakness is a totem]

crying bout points isn‚Äôt playing 
---
EDIT: Meant to write "where is killer" instead of "who is killer" but didn't notice it before rendering
---
entity magic or some shit
---
Gamebreaking bugs or issues that heavily affect gameplay - Wait for patch
---
Survivors getting free event points - patched within 24 hours.
---
so? lmfao. it‚Äôs a video game. you‚Äôre supposed to have fun
---
I don‚Äôt know why this is funny but it is lmao
---
Can we have some context for this image?
---
Yup they had this fixed on pc a day ago. I guess it was a glitch and that really sucks 
---
Yaint lying
---
Wow, and I thought that was intended, now they made the grind even worse, what a joke.
---
This has been my experience during the event too.
---
It's even better when 2 people make it out and the killer goes on a salty rampage at the end about how premades are so unfair.
---
right. i‚Äôm level 40+ on Nurse, Huntress, Legion and Myers. i do play a survivor a bit more, so i think my peak with killer is rank 7 or something. my pig is level 8 or something. i have quite a few achievements for killer.
---
believe whatever you want, babygirl. i‚Äôm here if you want screenshots.
---
The newest patch made the grind even harder for everyone and ruins the gameplay even more. What a joke.
---
go commit infinite loading screen
---
I‚Äôve became fairly decent at huntress with a couple of longshots. But you can‚Äôt see progress on your trophies so no clue which ones counted and which didn‚Äôt. 
---
It's not like we get "much' extra points from the fucking event anyway
---
Hook someone, walk 24 metres away then throw a test shot at the hooked person to judge how high you need it to be. Wait for him to be unhooked then throw just before he is free, this way his body won‚Äôt block the shot if the other person is behind.
---
Hah, I totally get that. Its just unusual in my opinion for a younger generation to get into those movies IMO. It came out 35 years ago for Christ sake! I figured you guys would be way more into Babadooks, or vampires, or whatever the fuck is big these days. It makes me feel good to know you guys are out there watching Nightmare on Elm street because it was such a big part of my childhood. Noice!
---
Yet another camping Huntress, thats all this event is.
---
Cunts like that are out to just ruin the game for everyone else. At least it entertained you I guess.
---
what
---
You realize killers have to do those things because at red ranks most of them just mean a free loss. Playing versus SWF is fucking aids. 
---
Ok thanks! That‚Äôs a good reference, thanks. Really helped me out because that happens quite often
---
The double blink 
---
I guess a collector is a fair way to put it. I‚Äôve been playing this game for over two years and enjoy both sides (for reference I have all teachables on both survivor and killer, so the game is definitely something I‚Äôm pretty involved with) so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm just in it for the huntress. Still, my professor ain‚Äôt stopping to play the event so I‚Äôve gotta budget my time pretty hard if I want all 3 outfits
---
do you get any BP for carrying/escaping with the vessel?
---
because i don't..
---
Their is really an r/NeaKarlsson?
---
Knowing the age group of most of his fans, I'd say [these](http://www.jeffs60s.com/images/candy-cigarettes-pic.jpg)
---
I honestly have no context. They sent that message and the killer left a few moments after. I thought it was hilarious and so here it is.
---
not on the cost of others 
---
Feng min is a art teacher whos favorite medium is clay. Her drawing is mediocre at best but everyone likes her because  nobody fails the class  because  shes open-minded and can't actually critique or dislike a students project. Whoa
---
It's was a lose-lose situation for me. I chose to lose with extra bloodpoints lol
---
You must deal with smarter survivors. :P I've done that repeatedly &amp; they still flee. One of them messaged me asking if I knew how to kill people.
---
Prepare for a bunch of farms and keys in your lobbies now, because literally NO ONE is going to try and get 5 gens done because survivors now have no insensitive to work together. And even if all 5 gens are done, killers can just DC for THEIR own fault at failing to do their objective, rendering all your work and vessels useless.
---
I can get more or less the meter measures in a map just from view. More or less. Like I know if a BBQ is going to hit me or not, or if I'm playing Freddy I know how far do I have to go to see the aura of a survivor I lost in a chase.
---
I usually have people flee. Every once in a long while, I'll have someone who gets it.
---
Yeah, I saw the update scheduled on Steam and I had a hunch they'd change it. My team mate told me about the "bug" yesterday and I was thinking that maybe it's not a bug and it's intended, cause it's an interesting strategy to just escort a single team mate and get the points for the whole team. But yeah, they've changed it yesterday.
---
Smart players after a hook walk in 1 direction for the required time then double back when not revealed to send the killer on a wild goose chase.
---
Smart players when someone goes down head towards the killer to get in the radius so it doesnt reveal them and becomes a wasted perk 
---
Like a minecraft spawner
---
Not a big deal then
---
But it is OP. It's fantastyc!
---
Yup looks like survivors have to just get as much gen points as they can and that‚Äôs it 
---
At least you acknowledge their existence.
---
This was a cool thing because it made you work in team even more to get the important lantern person out.
---
Now it will be a f'n fight between survivors on who gets the lantern first and leading the killer to a lantern person to get it reset.
---
Great f'n job developers.
---
I haaaate that. This guy on Coal Tower literally did not touch the gen... at all. Literally at all. He stood there with his toolbox behind the stack of boxes, doing nothing. If he'd touched it one time, literally just one time, it'd have been done. I will never not resent that guy. :P
---
i'd play
---
I think you‚Äôre giving the community too much credit. You know damn well killers would ignore everyone else if it meant getting their precious points.
---
Great comment. People don‚Äôt realize that if you dc you lose your offering and addons + all the bloodpoints and event points.
---
This is my problem with the game. Fix it? Nahhh. Let's just distract players with new clothing items.   
---
Eventually their player retention is going to be in the dirt because they fail to prioritize the game's functionality. At that point, no "event" is going to save them.
---
It also happened in the middle of a game. Had no reason to leave since his was doing pretty well 
---
Good job, this is awesome 
---
Yes yes boycott the game Ochido fans, less of you would be very welcome ;)
---
Sweaty build? Ruin, enduring, spirit fury, monitor, haunted grounds, bamboozle, etc (‚Äúmeta‚Äù picks) 
---
Casual: anything you want really 
---
This makes me want a killer with a really long katana 
---
This is actually useful because its never explained! Thanks.
---
Then again isn't it true that most of the newer killers all have this one perk that is useless or very situational? Like Spirit Fury on Spirit and Iron Maiden on Legion ?
---
Ahahahahahahah
---
does your ethernet / wifi randomly cutout for a few seconds? That's the result when it happens
---
The ratio of games escaping with a vessel and games where two or less gens get done are roughly the same so it's an average.
---
*Chainsaws then runs into an object*
---
i mean i like me some vampires, but i started watching buffy when i was 7 (2001, when it just ended in the us) so i like different kind of vampires than a lot of people my age i guess. but there's a ton of people who appreciate older things as well as some new stuff. it's good that you can compare styles, but it's really annoying that so many remakes come out lately. but you get good new horror stuff too, like hush and shows like haunting of hill house
---
Something about hims...just a little...off
---
Yeah, he was.
---
If no one burns an offering than no one will care who gets the lamp. unlike the last event, the offering for this event is stupidly fucking hard to get, you have to spend around 40k for one and that's almost impossible to get as survivor, so unless you saved a good deal of BP prior to the event you're looking at an red envelope every two matches. Now imagine taking that long, only to use one and then not get a single lamp in the game because the ones who did not burn an offering were luckier than you were.
---
Out of curiosity, which platform are you on? PC/Xbox/PS4?
---
I play Frank, I think. Whoever has the Devil-May-Care skin.
---
Speaking of multiple killers, did you know there are rumours of two killers being released for 2.6?
---
Because it‚Äôs the best pallet in the game
---
Bing Bong
---
We aslo all know that the target will play like a ninja at start of the match. That will make it hard to find it first. But the target have a timer on the head, hooking another survivor could be a good bait ;) +10 seconds timer means the killer can't find you longer.
---
We could also tweak things such as adding this rule : "The timer is slowing down by half (?) when the target is inside killer's terror radius but not in a chase"
---
funny but they cant see the killers name tho :o
---
Haha indeed, mate
---
Because its super safe to play around it once dropped, so the killer is forced to break it as no amount of bloodlust can help them hit the survivor.
---
lmfao then how did I and a billion of other people get at least 3 coins within a few hours?
---
its not on the cost of others. but oki
---
From what I've experience there are not enough time to move whatsoever in the seconds it take for him to get to you. This seems like a bad argument.
---
Gens certainly does not block auras.
---
Yaaaay
---
I have not heard about that. :O SOUNDS AWESOME THOUGH!
---
If SWF are kicking your ass, in your opinion, then you need to improve as a killer yourself. There are advantages of SWF, but not big enough advantages that you cannot hook or find anyone. Use your rank 20 bigbrain and find the immersed claudettes and stop bitching. Killers have a large advantage, you just need a better build and better addons. But truly you don't, I have played killer at rank 1 with no addons or perks and still got a 4k. It is all about your game sense and your playstyle. If you chase one person all game while their friends do gens, cool, awesome, just learn to use your senses and find them. If you can find one of them you can find them all. There is no reason SWF should be making you rage this hard lmfao 
---
It for sure is not a good perk. One non hex ruin check is more impediment than a max power thana.
---
„ÄåStar Platinum„Äç STAR FINGER! 
---
100% this. Next event is going to be even worse.
---
Aight, lets just assume that you're correct and that that Meg intentionally grieffed your Feng. How can you definitively prove to BHVR that it was intentional? How can BHVR tell that that Meg isn't just an idiot? Cause if it isn't completely obvious they won't do anything because they don't want to risk accidentally banning someone who didn't deserve it.
---
Fengs skirt is pretty cool, and ace's shirt. all the others are meh.
---
I don't know why they have not one, but two killers who have "countdown to death" powers that for some reason pause if they are in a chase.
---
&gt; Stopping mid chase to grab lanterns,
---
This is the funniest part for me, like do they not realise that they lose the lamp when they go down?
---
The grind is big but we also get three full outfits this time, all achievable without dropping a dime. Your first outfit is practically free because there‚Äôs no way you can‚Äôt get 600 points during the event unless you straight up don‚Äôt play and even getting the next 1500 isn‚Äôt unreasonable at all over a course of two weeks. If you only care about one side you‚Äôre fine and if that side is killer then you probably already have huntress‚Äô full set by now. If you‚Äôre a collector then you can grind out all 4500 hundred points or just play dbd as much as you usually would and get the last outfit for like ten bucks. 
---
I get that they aren‚Äôt doing event exclusives lately but I really hate the whole MhM bHvR iS gReEdy bandwagon. They could‚Äôve given us a weapon and a pair of pants and I swear there‚Äôd be less complaining. Of all things to complain about with this event, the 9 cosmetic pieces being purchasable is not of significant importance.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works cuz I‚Äôve dodged and have missed attacks closer than that. Also if that were the case vaults would be literally useless since your hitbox would be in the other side of the window
---
jet skis are babby's game. The real throwdown is butt battle! 
---
It's infuriating for sure, but its not always necessarily JUST to stop you from getting the achievement. They're doing what they can to survive, y'know, the point of the game. Jumping into the locker last second to avoid a tombstone mori is a valid strat, but I highly doubt anyone is doing that JUST so you can't get the achievement. 
---
&gt; Since you've already walked past a couple empty lantern posts.
---
Fuck me, i BARELY see the empty posts let alone lamps themselves. IDK what algorithm they used for the post placement's but it's stupidly hard. When the events over they need to use that algorithm for totems.
---
Grammar is a very important part of life though. I hope youre just joking. 
---
Run one way then walk back the other, depends on distance but it works some times
---
Might as well be "Press R1 to wake up" with how often it happens
---
If your playing on console the survivor queue times will be high until they fix the game regardless, but the event is easier for survivor so that‚Äôs why the queue times are fried right now.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve noticed that if anyone has the bloody prestige clothing on or is holding a flashlight, that‚Äôs when the killer seems to disconnect the most often. At least for me, that is. 
---
&gt; Killers already get more points. 
---
Holy shit you could not be more wrong.
---
Killers get 3 points per hook, meaning in the best circumstance possible we can only get a max of 12 points from hooking. That's ignoring the fact that if someone dies on their first hook that's only 3 points, or if they DC like they've been doing we get no points.
---
On top of that breaking lamps is incredibally hard to do as killer because unless we already know where one is, the chances of finding one before a hooked survivor get's rescued or dies is minimal.
---
Had to go clean it up I guesd
---
Thank you! I made an updated version that gets rid of the gradient lines, should I upload that as well? 
---
Also, I would love to do that as a side project! I'll have to figure out which program to use though, since my student subscription for Adobe has expired and I can't get my grubby little hands on After Effects anymore :c 
---
We need that as a Mori
---
Ah, yes that explains why he left so suddenly lmao
---
I just don't understand why we do not get a visual notification for where the lantern is when we hook someone. 
---
Even just the nearest one would be great. 
---
She escaped without being injured on hatch(You know, despite clown looking at her when she was the only one alive). He ran straight past her while healing(She got a full heal off. She was in the open. The direction he was coming from meant he couldn't  have missed her). She consumed the flashlight by like 80%, despite Feng Min being pretty close to where the first picture was, meaning there was no long lasting chase going on where she used it repeatedly. She also has bond which is easily the most 'Fuck you' oriented perk you can have, and is the only one that can so easily pull off what she did, and the fact that clown would wound her and then suddenly head off to another target, despite how close she is(I mean, he could quite literally have heard her on the first picture) - 
---
The amount of stuff linking up simply cannot be counted as coincidence anymore
---
Update(if you care lol) after hard resetting my box I can now find matches, I still don't know what happened tho lol
---
It's literally one of the easiest dailies.
---
They patched that? Fuck them, seriously. 
---
Packet loss falls under latency because it‚Äôs a connection problem
---
Everyone else here has already mentioned myriad counterplay to it.  You can use a locker, you can hide behind a generator, you can fake a direction for 4 seconds then go somewhere else, you can move closer within 40 meters then move back out, you can run Distortion, you actually use it against the killer to by making sure you are revealed really far away in order to waste their time and give you more than ample time to hide. 
---
As a survivor, I *love* that killers get a perk like that, one that gives a strong incentive to leave the hook.  I think it's one of the most fun playstyles for survivors and killers when the killer is able to go off and start a new chase after hooking someone and continue doing that until the killer has achieved 12 hooks or the survivors have escaped.  Sure the perk gives bonus bloodpoints to the killer, but it also encourages a playstyle that allows all 5 players to earn a lot of points and pip, regardless the results. 
---
If survivors have a problem with BBQ, they may want to rethink things.  I get having a problem with perks like Insidious and Dying Light, those things encourage gameplay that's really unfun for at least 1 person, and they're promoting a playstyle that isn't optimized around bloodpoint gain.  
---
Any perk the killer has that gives them a reason to leave the hook and not come back is largely a good thing that promotes a much better experience for everyone.  It really has too many ways to counter it from survivors, and many survivors make sure their aura isn't revealed when they would actually be fine letting it get revealed.  You do kind of want at least 1 person to be revealed to the killer, so they don't assume that everybody is within 40 meters ready to swarm the hook.  These days though, everybody could be across the map and you'd never see them due to lockers and whatnot making BBQ a very unreliable tool for information anyway.  
---
:D hehe nice. Have fun!
---
Broke ass cant afford the wire
---
I appreciate the feedback, I just put this together in like an hour or so. Will keep this in mind for next time!
---
Wow I just went up against a camping huntress. She only got one kill but I lost my lantern because someone took it when I got hooked üò≠
---
Just rumours though. Hopefully it comes true. And hopefully they‚Äôre not as strong as nurse, as weak as sharp hand joe, as unfair as legion or as boring as trapper D:
---
I think add-ons make a good killer great. Clown is very fun but his add-ons do nothing for him. Then there‚Äôs killers like Spirit whose add-ons really are fun and increase the power level, in my opinion!
---
Pro btw
---
Yeee I like all those perks but I couldn't use any due to being left alone :/ 
---
True lol
---
"Some times" seems like a flimsy excuse.
---
You could just not try and "win" an argument and instead listen to his position. The fact that you need help with an argument should illustrate that you aren't firm in your position or understanding.  
---
devs thoughts = worse gameplay or make more money from people grinding?
---
Any chance you could share your magic freestyle settings bb?
---
Next up, the Feng Billy!
---
Hit spacebar when you're next to it and it's red.
---
Sadly, Devs only have 13 days to create this Event to do it this year... :D that will be too short :(
---
Because the jiller has to break itcand its at a super safe structure same goes for cow tree pallet
---
That's the joke :)
---
They can be bought with shards but they are not free lol
---
Baited her by messing up other gens far from ones I was actually fixing, it was a long game lol
---
&gt; pause if they are in a chase
---
Because otherwise Legion can just use bleedout add-ons and follow you. You would literally have no way to counter one that doesn't leave you alone after giving you deep wounds. 
---
XD Pig in B tier and huntress and spirit below clown 
---
Whispers is one of the best perks to run on huntress. It's great all game especially against immersive survivors. It's all because of the lullaby the huntress has, typically when a survivor hears it they may go into hiding and whispers will save you time by letting you know they're in the vicinity or cleared it which saves you rediculous amount of time. I personally think she is the killer that benefits the most from the perk and is basically a must have for her. My build of hers usually is ruin, whispers, nurse's, BBQ. Sometimes I switch out nurse's for iron maiden just cause I love the synergy and feel of reloading hatchets fast as fuck.
---
No, SWF advantages are huge and a acting like the aren't is the most disingenuous shit.
---
One of the most balance mechanics in the game is that killers can see gen auras and survivors can't.
---
The fact that SWF allows survivors to know where the gens are on the map completely removes that.
---
Anyway, most of your "argument" is a personal attack and relies on the garbage *I'm rank 1* justification which everyone knows is horseshit because rank means nothing starting at around mid-purple ranks 
---
They do have a thumbs up. I give it to people sometimes and I just wonder what does it actually do you know haha
---
yeah, slashing with space bar. I stood there for 3 swings till I saw the interaction prompt.
---
Am I just a slow reader or are these texts gone way to fast?
---
BTW factor in your queue time because I need to wait a lot as Survivor currently.
---
Although it may be a bad play, it's way harder to iridescent Lightbringer if you don't co-op gens. I used to gen-jockie by myself and you don't even come close to the max 8k if you do gens by yourself, even if you did 3 or 4 of the gens.
---
Basically it really depends on your team, if you have a good teammate that can tell when you guys need to leave then you'll be good.
---
Enduring,spirit fury,ruin,BBQ is pretty much as good as it gets 
---
If you could see the hit box of the tantrum, it would be a circle around Bubba. 
---
indeed and wtf is "the chainsaw"...LOL
---
I mean, most survivors expect the perk anyway and counterplay it rather easily. You'll usually get 1-2 people being shown for every hook if you're lucky. The bloodpoints is the main upside here.
---
I used to slug them and just wander off, if I ended up with 2 or more on the ground I'd go stand in the open doing nothing until they were revived, then chase the healthy ones.  ... but the amount of insults I got in post-game lobby was ridiculous. Either I was a dick for slugging people, or I was a noob for all of them escaping etc. The dropping makes it waaaay more obvious that I'm NOT trying to kill, and they seem to get the message.
---
I have a full L3 Billy. You had to get a prestige before Nov 26th 2016. 
---
Back then it took about 6 million BP to P3 level 1 someone. Now it takes about 3 million. A level 20 bloodweb then was like a level 50 bloodweb today.
---
There also was no Party Streamers and BP offerings were only 75% max.
---
Lanterns?
---
Wow, that is super fast. 4 hours of survivor and I only got around 250 points. 
---
Someone else brought bloody party streamers?
---
The kind of teammate everyone wants on their team and the kind of teammate everyone should strive to be.

---
It‚Äôs ridiculous on ps4. An actual campfire simulator. I was waiting close to half an hour for a game that wasn‚Äôt worth waiting that long for. I‚Äôd guess it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs more lucrative to be survivor in the event ?? 
---
Doing a quick sketch each day to practice! Any suggestions welcome.
---
Don't bother with him. Their whole argument is just a personal attack

Thanatophobia is a bad perk

Nope. PC players only get Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse, and Huntress/Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake, Nea, and David as base game/free.

You dont

Back in the day, Small Game used to show you the aura of Bear Traps within 3m.

They changed it since there was only 3 killers back then and Trapper was most played.

Must've played like 12 hours straight
---
dont think so
---
you really dont get it...
---
Swap doctor to C and legion to A and maybe this is right.
---
Also think that the spirit is better than hag.
---
This is really cool. Good job.
---
I understand you realize that it cannot be changed. And I realize you stated that you could be better. I simply cannot put my mind on the fact of why you even made this post to complain when you are the clear problem. The SWF using voice coms is not the problem, you are the problem. You should not be going on here ranting about a perfectly fine and fun way of playing dbd just because you simply cannot compete against it. It may be time for you to find a new game. 
---
Wait, was there a massive killer buff recently? Might be enough to get me to start playing again! 
---
Do you mean before dropped? Once that pallet goes down the killer shack loop loses it's oomph
---
Wow you really are here to just stick up for random people on the internet. I shared my personal viewpoints on his post whether or not you agree or disagree, it was not a conversation for you. All my points I brought up were valid and rotate around his personal skill at the game. He clearly does not have a full understanding on how he can personally improve but rather would throw excuses out as to why SWF is completely toxic and that he cannot play against it. Cool story, it may be a personal attack, but I feel as though the information he brought forth was useless information no one cared to read. Thus, I will share my opinion and attack him if I want to. He needs to improve his gameplay and realize more so that he is the reason he is losing, not because of SWF.
---
One of the biggest things I have learned through years of playing video games, mainly competitively, is that the excuses you make for games do not better your skill or justify you, you have to own up to the mistakes you make in game and not blame it on other people. The only way you will better your performance is through learning from your mistakes and building off of them. Continuously making excuses will continue to push you farther back or keep you at the exact same place you are in.
---
Point being, don't make an excuse about SWF and play the game how it is, people are toxic in these games, it fucking happens. Get over it, learn from how they play and be toxic back. Do what you have to win and don't come on here trying to vouch that you only lose because SWF is too op for you. Just better your gameplay and personal experience and move on. 
---
I got mine on PS4 after the patch, no problems for me so far
---
Saying that iridescent head + infantry belt isn‚Äôt douchey because it‚Äôs just a ‚Äúkiller add-on‚Äù is like saying to dc isn‚Äôt douchey because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúgame mechanic‚Äù

FUCK YEAH

That killer was awful lol

I think that Meg had a split second heart attack thinking she wont be able to vault LOL

I'm new to playing dbd so excuse my ignorance - but is it not ok to use discord to speak with a friend while playing SWF?

Not gonna Lie.  I wanna try this xD

Ruin doesn't 'ruin' the game for survivors, what it does is buy the killer as much time as possible to gain some momentum even then the totem can get cleansed at the start of the game within seconds. There is no shittier feeling than playing on a tough map and getting gen pumped with a low mobility killer before you can even find a survivor by the time let's say you find one and even if you down pretty quick you got 2 gens popped on you with just one down and guess what that's just 3 more to go making you want to wait for that stage 2 hook progression because you know the time is already stacked against you. Without ruin gens will get popped easily within less than 5 minutes lower with the right toolboxes and perks and also coop repairs, only counter would be to play a killer that has great map pressure on any map like nurse and billy being the top two. Enjoy playing against the same two killers every time you play if you'd like to not see ruin in the game.
---
Please tell me you made a "Reason you're a shit Survivor who should uninstall?"  xD
---
This is genuinely sad to see
---
No add-ons, no offerings, no items. The perks I was using were Sprint Burst, Quick &amp; Quiet, DS and Adrenaline
---
What's there to really master? When to shock so the vault gets interrupted? He still gets looped hard in my experience. 
---
I play more survivor than killer, I don't even think it's worth a perk slot on every killer in terms of effectiveness.  I generally run it on every killer for bloodpoints, but as someone like Hag, I'm not gonna walk to the opposide side of the map to try to chase someone.
---
For some killers, particularly Hillbilly and Nurse, BBQ can be a *very* powerful perk.  Depending on the map/survivor positioning, they can sometimes reach the revealed survivor within a couple seconds of the aura fading away giving almost no opportunity to really hide from that point.  The survivor would have needed to move in closer, hide behind a gen, use a locker, or distortion.  If they're close but revealed against a high mobility killer, then yes it is going to be very strong, possibly even seeming OP if you were unaware of the counterplay.
---
Against the the other killers, you still get just as much of a heads up that the killer is coming if they have BBQ or not, though I suppose you could even pre-emptively hide before hearing a heartbeat if you were that concerned about it.  
---
People are always looking for anything but themselves to blame.  Sometimes you will be in situations where no matter what you do, you will get hit.  Does that mean that situation had no counterplay? I don't think so.  The counterplay may have been 30 seconds before that, instead of just a few seconds before like it typically is.
---
I'm not exactly a main on either side, I play both sides a lot and enjoy trying to optimize the gameplay as much as possible.  I find camping killers to be unfun and unrewarding, and would rather have a slightly more difficult match with the killer applying pressure and spreading the hooks out between everyone, and a perk that allows them to do that is something I would rather see as a survivor than not see(maybe unless it's hillbilly/nurse, then it could be a very snowballing rough match).
---
Pc master race. That‚Äôs all u got to say
---
time goes faster if u dont focus on that shit as much ;)
---
I am too busy pouring on my Tapp to get Detective Hunch
---
One problem with this. The survivor will just git gud, and parry the killer till they DC. Feelsbadman.
---
I stand corrected then. I'm pretty new to the game because I bought it on New Year's so honestly I was just speculating based on all the times I've gotten iridescent, seemed to be when I got more bloodpoints in Objective category. So maybe it isnt best for Lightbringer but I will say you definitely get more bloodpoints doing coop.
---
Oh and I think I know that opening a gate is a lot of points towards iridescent because games I open the gates, I almost always get gold+.
---
time to add proximity mics in this game... lul

SCP-096 HAS BREACHED CONTAINMENT!

It has no effect on my FPS on PS4.

Do you have insta down bottles?  
---
Nah.

Then why are you spamming bottles at the hook and not M1ing before you get bodyblocked?  
---
... HUERHUERHUERHUERRRRRRRR!!!
---
And he highlights this by... ruining the game for his entire team who might be people like me who really don't have a problem with Legion. DC'ing is DC'ing.

Oof. Imagine bitching about a perk when you don't understand how it works.

You‚Äôre seeing Whispers- when you get above rank 10, your opinion might matter more.
---
The hag traps would spawn the big mud clones of her that would sorta y'know, attack anyone that got close to them, with variances between the light medium heavy inputs, light would spawn a clone that's constantly active but can be destroyed by being hit, the clones would occasionally attack on their own, medium would summon a clone that is only triggered when it gets close, which would grab the characters and hold them in place, they're still able to block attacks, it just holds them in place for a little bit like 2 seconds, strong summons a clone at the very furthest part of the screen, doing the motion again lets you teleport to it, not doing the motion means that pushing someone back will lead them into walking into the trap, leading into a sort of launcher attack from the clone, that leads into a free juggle combo, I'd expect.
---
Trapper would have the most strength, in my opinion. Dude's a beast. 
---
has to be troll guys, don't bother
---
hillbilly not having map mobility?... he has one of the best dude.
---
My frames are fine on Xbox
---
You‚Äôve mastered him when realising you never lose when playing him which most people cannot do. 
---
In a way Ironic considering his time period. 
---
You sly bitch
---
I initially played this game on 3440x1440 and as a survivor there is no vertical room. So basically your head is almost at the top of the screen and the game is super zoomed in. I now boot the game in 1080p windowed. This is the one and only game that I have that sucks on ultrawide.
---
Not focusing, it's just a fact, and you can't just ignore it away.
---
Same. Fps wise it's actually gotten a little smoother on average.
---
That's pro af.

I started maining wraith because of this reason only lol love his bell

Honestly, I didn't want them to have identical stats, and since they're both the same speed, I thought people would complain if I made one faster than the other. So somebody had to have a higher ability score than the other, and I figured that Huntress had to be stronger, right?
---
and before you all ask, yes, ace is SO powerful, that he could challenge shaggy to a 1v1 and actually stand a chance against him...
---
I'm happy to say it is an advantage - I just didn't realise it was taboo. I often thought to myself, why isn't there at least a text chat function?
---
In fact - why isn't there some kind of communication in game? Is it simply because of the advantage? Seems weird to have a team game without comms no?
---
Now I kind of want Survivor Whack-a-Mole, damn it.
---
You cant bodyblock if you are not in dream world
---
Ayyy HxH!!
---
Just because you're a bad pig player doesnt mean pig is bad lol. Pig has plenty of snowball potential once you get the traps going. Chase potential is also there when you know how to ambush loops and ambush in general.
---
Thinking skill is rng based is the newest joke, let me guess you're a rank 12 hardstuck player yeah bud? Lol
---
Beautiful
---
Same can be applied for killer, I‚Äôd much rather have others wait 5 minutes to get out of the lobby than sit at a hatch for 45 minutes. If you actually have to sit there on the ground for 5 minutes blame your teammate for not picking you up and not the killer for wanting to secure the 4th kill.

Type of Bug: In-game

Description: Last night I escaped with the vessel and got the additional BP, but not the 25 event points nor any points for doing gens. This was after a fresh restart. Can rewind and see me starting the game for the first time.

Platform: Xbox One

Type: Menu I believe 
---
Description: when turning the game on, it won‚Äôt go past the initial screen after launching the game up. It tells me to Press A to Continue but when I press A, the line goes away shortly but doesn‚Äôt actually take me to the menu so I can play
---
Sincerely interested: Would it be a possiblity for you to record a few matches and post them here? Maybe you are using stuff that I'm not aware of, I'm always interested in learning new stuff.
---
When did they change this? Because i have definatly been body blocked by people not in the dream while carrying survivors before
---
I thought about it for a long time, and I think that Hag would win. I don't think Huntress could wind up her hatchets quickly enough to down Hag, and Hag could trap the lockers! HAG WIINNSSSS.
---
Dwight and locker is OTP
---
P3 Claudette loves her flashlight
---
Jake loves rubbing his hooks until they fall off
---
They gave him his speed boost yes, but without using add ons up the ass he's not much good about handling looping (unless you're just a good killer, which isn't common lol)
---
But they're both garbage perks
---
Pqxkrt pause can be caused by latency, the terms are not interchangable because they are not the same thing.
---
If there was packet loss going on, hits from killers would likely not register, as that packet could have been lost. The problem is hits that are connecting when they have no business doing so.  As I've explained, it's likely how hitboxes behave in a moving character model, but there may well also be network problems in play, though it's most likely to be desynch as opposed to packet loss and latency.
---
Aw, thanks! xD
---
Clown is more fun and strong enough. Spirit is just phase m1 phase m1, there is nothing interesting to her.
---
She is the smallest survivor I believe. 
---
To be fair, balanced landing is multi-purpose.
---
I guess I never noticed how, well, short she is on the characters lobby screen.¬† Is that even correct?¬† It looks kinda off to me.
---
The characters are lined up in perspective manner right?¬† So the one at the front should look taller than everyone else.¬† Despite that, Feng's height looks a bit off.¬† Maybe it's too emphasise David's height but still she looks really smol here. 
---
The Claudetteslayer
---
OH NO DAVID LOOK OUT! OH GOD OH SHIT, HES HOT AIRPODS IN!!!!!
---
Who is Ace? You must be talking about God
---
It‚Äôs always been this way, of your not sleeping you can‚Äôt interact with him at all,
---
Yeah, I think Doctor is... next level, man. I don't know what happened. I worked on those eyes for a good twenty minutes before I gave up. I think I'll be seeing those in my nightmares.
---
What doesn't make sense the part where you come off as a arrogant count or the part where you don't understand what killer main have to go through because of people like you?
---
Looks like we just need someone to program it! :P
---
Aww, thank you so much! That's really nice of you to say. :3
---
ah, a believer i see, you see, ace visconti is god's mortal form
---
You think it is any better for Killers?
---
Killers already have problems with map pressure and keeping up with gen progress. Some Killers simply can't and will find themselves hard pressed to land multiple hooks. Without hooking, Killers can't earn points at all.
---
A good Killer that lands all 12 hooks AND breaks all lamps, only gets maybe 30 points. Killers need a godly amount of luck and effort to land all of those hooks and find the lamps before an unhook for very little points. Killer effort in earning their points is by far not rewarded enough. Killing someone doesn't even allow a Killer to break a lamp as once the sacrifice starts, the lamp is untouchable. Unlike the hatch where it only opens after the sacrifice finishes.
---
Survivors on the other hand get points for each gen finished if they did the work or not. You can hide in a locker all game and still earn points. It isn't much to ask that Survivors need to show some effort to earn their points as well. That extra 25 points is equal to an entire game after all.
---
I actually want to but I ain‚Äôt sure how to :/ sorry 
---
Welcome to the cult brother
---
How was i body blocked while carrying then? This is literally the only reason i don't play freddy
---
Hasn‚Äôt affected my FPS at all and I‚Äôm playing on a standard Xbox one. 
---
Well, yeah, flashlights are the worst survivor tool in the game. A lot of rank 1 players are incredibly boosted also. We can‚Äôt use anecdotal evidence as a basis for a killer‚Äôs viability. I could 4K with freddy at rank 1and get a 1k with nurse and say freddy is S tier, does that mean he‚Äôs S tier? If you think doctor‚Äôs where he belongs on the tier list, provide good reasons. He shocks loops, ok. But if a survivor keeps running then shocking loops is useless since charging shock slows you down. It can help you with the occasional god window but that‚Äôs about it. Doctor gets looped just like any other killer. Also, his early game may be okay due to the fact that treatment mode is a free whispers, but once survivors are up to tier 1 it won‚Äôt be as reliable for tracking purposes. 
---
Must of been a weird fluke, 
---

Hey, Sat! I'd like to make a post sometime with the icons (so people who are interested can change out their selection screen icons), but I didn't want to spam the subreddit with posts. If you'd like a set, just find me on Twitch (RoryDiesALot) or add me on Discord--Rory#8450.
---
"Obvious main part" that only works about 20% of the time.
---
You‚Äôre looking too far in one direction, you seem to look at the perspective of only caring about bloodpoints, and rank. What do you tell someone who‚Äôs just playing the game and not caring for rank or points? ‚ÄúJust allow the survivor to leave‚Äù If I‚Äôm getting trashed on for allowing the last person to leave, then I‚Äôd rather be trashed for how I defeated them all.
---
Girl got some THICC calves. No wonder she's horrifying to be chased by.
---
You rate the Doctor way too highly IMO. Against immersed survivors he might be top A tier.
---
But against actual Rank 1 survivors that know what they're doing, he's very loopable, and unlike Huntress, Hag, and to an extent Spirit, Docs shock doesn't do much to counter that. It can be done in some vaults, but around pallets, little you can do with it. 
---
His Madness is a great tracking tool and a 3 gen strat can stall games, but in chases his power doesn't help much.
---
And his skill ceiling is not that high. Huntress and Spirit have higher skill ceilings and are much more rewarding. Doctor against Rank 1 survivors is B tier not top A tier
---
Do you know what happens when you buy the fengmin skin without having fengmin?
---
Just wondering, it'll probably say 'error:something something' right?
---
I guess that sounds right in comparison to everyone else.  David is probably the tallest, right?
---
thanks boo :*
---
Bit off-topic bit why is that nurse running monitor and abuse? They can hear you blinking close no matter the terror radius right?
---
What are you supposed to do as a killer in that situation?
---
I- ok. But you really don't need NOED on the nurse unless you're not very good at her. If you're not very good at her that's fine but at least acknowledge it.
---
Good nurses get easy 4ks most of the time, they don't use ruin either. Too much map pressure to need it. At that point it's just s waste of a perk slot

---
Happened twice months apart tho. First was they stopped me from hooking. Then healed. I droped freddyml. Then more recently i was literally surrounded and trapped. I couldnt even drop the survivor
---
I have them, but I don‚Äôt play any of them. 
---
I think Quentin or Tapp might be taller, but that might just be that they have smaller bodies compared to buff David
---
I think it‚Äôs a tie between David and Bill, though Jeff looks massive. 
---
For me it does with curtain killers like if I play trapper I get like 10fps but for the cost part its smooth and I'm on xbox
---
No it's not better for the killer at all, I agree.
---
You even have the problem that Killer barely.get any points because everyone just quits like crazy after they got downed.
---
But, they should have buffed killer somehow instead and not made survivor worse and grinding worse for everyone.
---
tbh I never perceived it as a "team game." You have common objectives and work together, and I try to help out my teammates like if gates are open and they got hooked, but it's not like being on an NFL team, you know?
---
Devs have talked about how they envision the game - and it's supposed to be an isolated experience. If you were in the woods with a serial killer you wouldn't be shouting out across the trees to whoever else is out there.
---
&gt; I'm happy to say it is an advantage - I just didn't realise it was taboo
---
It's not taboo. The devs were fools and built the player base around it without proper balance, and most people in this sub are survivor mains who play SWF. It's taboo to point out the issues with it, if anything.
---
Survivors are all the same. I unlocked 43 perks for my Jake and I only play with him.
---
Feng is standing way back. If she was closer, she'd probably be taller.
---
The problem with the even is that if you want to farm it then it‚Äôs mostly playing survivor. Killers get points for hooking people and smashing the vessel, and you can only smash the vessel after you hook someone, and you don‚Äôt really want to go around looking for some red lantern for a few points in an even when you could be running around and playing the actual game
---
The Scent of Blood will lead you the Way it\`s kay
---
That's what I meant by how weirdly positioned she seems.  She just seems so tiny in comparison to everyone else.
---
I actually really like this
---
I know, it's just humorous. Especially since they speak as though the entirety of dbd community are ochido fans and we're all gonna boycott with them.
---
You could use GeForce Experience (free) to record gameplay in good quality and upload that to youtube. Not sure what the system requirements are (when you have a gaming pc you stop reading those), but I'm sure they're minimal.
---
How can you even decide which one is more fun if you only have 1? Lol.
---
I have both and I can tell you clown is more fun in all ways possible.
---
I ship me and my suicidal depression. Hbu
---
Because stabbing someone who isn‚Äôt injured gives them more than enough time to get the unhook? Not that this is top-tier killer behavior, the correct thing is to wait for them to actually go for the unhook and then grab them off(though this leads to many mindgames)
---
t h i c c c c
---
Position better to make their exit take longer. Hit someone, they‚Äôre 99% guaranteed to get the guy off the hook so your best bet is to swap that survivors place with another. Gives you the same situation but with more of an advantage as another person is hurt.
---
Chuck the gas, hit someone, the gas will interrupt the unhook, and you use that to get a free hit, then repeat the steps
---
I don't think I've ever seen her so tiny. Probably something bhvr messed up with an update. 
---
Getting this literally right now, I always like to cool down my nights with a little dbd so yeah kinda sucks
---
The sound is neat but it\`s way to loud ( i always have to remove my headset until it\`s gone lul).
---
The survivors are all re-skins of each other. Other than cosmetic look, there is no difference between them.
---
I‚Äôm on an original Xbox one not an X, I think most people have issues because of the TV‚Äôs they use, 
---
If you use boneclapper, you have to spam it the entire game. 
---
If he wanted to report exploits he could have sent clips in to the Devs where he purposely tried to find exploits so that they could fix it.
---
That's not what he did. He used the exploits in public games whilst recording as he teabagged and mocked killers and uploaded it to YouTube for everyone to laugh at them.
---
Maybe if he had ANY intention of having the bugs fixed, it would be a different story. But he even said in one of his PS4 videos "why they have to fix the bugs" soo
---
I‚Äôd rather play the game out avoiding farming and then hit that phat report button. 
---
This is a pretty good idea!
---
Smooth as fuck. Early dead hard tho
---
As long as one side earns points faster, the quetimes will be bad for this side unless its like a small difference ( wich isnt really the case)
---
Not every game, but the maps are divided into "quadrants" so consider that usually there will be at least one in each quadrant. Overall, everything (gens, totems) starts to have familiar spawn locations after awhile (I've been playing 1.5 years)
---
A number isn‚Äôt exactly a puzzle especially with no context my friend. 
---
I hate this image
---
Ah yes I'm aware of brother Donald and his many accomplishments to the cult üôèüèº we are very grateful to have him, but have you heard of one of the oldest founding members? He goes by Chuck Norris.
---
They are just cosmetics, Feng looks like she‚Äôs 13 and Ace looks like a kiddie fiddler, so fitting they are sharing this event I suppose. 
---
Maybe! If anything I'd just like to know if people appreciated me as part of their team, or as an opponent! 
---
"So are ya Chinese or Japanese"
---
Makes my pee pee sad and scared
---
That's a good point about the not yelling in the woods.
---
How about this then - If in friend lobby = game not ranked.
---
If Solo = game ranked.
---
???
---
I'm a simple man, I see Netero I upvote
---
I always call her Minnie!!üíñ
---
Same here
---
All I know is I play Freddie a lot, even at rank 1 and I‚Äôve never been blocked by an awake person, they have tried but I just clip through them. 
---
Yes like sure I'm a rank 1 survivor and I feel bad looping but I really love it when a killer comments nicely on my skills rather than mean comments. I've told nurses on console how amazing they were cuz it's scary when you get a good one 
---
Sometimes with the shack pallet you have to go around because theres a wall, wasting time and potentially getting juked by he killer. On Lerys you can always run in a straight line no matter what.
---
Ah ok, I‚Äôm very new and I‚Äôve been the killer in a situation like this. It seems like you just hit them way too slowly to be able to counter it so was wondering what to do or if there‚Äôs just nothing you can do. Seems weird that in a game like this the killer can feel so powerless at times. 
---
Decisive though.

3 pieces is only 600 points. Even assuming a bad score of just 3 gens/12 points a game that's only 50 games. I'm sure you can do 50 games in 12 days.

Feng's the only one I'm bothering with myself. Don't care for Ace's and I don't play Huntress. Plus her Blight skin is cooler anyway.

Well fuck me. I havnt been playing freddy because of this. Guess it was a bug.

He still had to go through the window to get you so even on his screen that was bull. Wow. Hitboxes are fun!

Yeah doesnt work when you blind yourself with bottle as well.

Aww, yeah, they were my first games, too. I remember going to the local rec center after school and spending my pocket change on a slice of really disgusting pizza, Backstreet Boy's "Everybody" on the jukebox, and then as much SF2 and Cadillacs &amp; Dinosaurs as I could fit in before I ran out of cash or my mom picked me up. It was really fun doing something more nostalgic, and I'm really glad that you like it, too. &lt;3
---
You missed the: - Camps Generators 
---
When the killer has bbq, and the survivor on the hook has Kindred 2. 
---
Several of the killers are listed as African-American, but not everybody realizes it! The Hag, The Doctor, The Wraith, and Joey from Legion are all African-American.

Yeah no.I call bullshit.You put doctor that high over a killer that cant be looped really?

Of course people are going to complain about a problem. Consoles also play at 30 FPS and if BHVR locked the game at 30 FPS on PC we would also complain. Just because console has a problem doesn't mean it's the standard, you can go complain all day about it too if you want.
---
It would explain why I miss my frenzy attacks sometimes or I don't see red scratch mark. Definitely fault of the mask and shit vision, not game mechanic.
---
Major/minor bugs or issues - Major bugs can be hard to isolate and fix. Minor bugs in untimed content have less pressure to be fixed before bigger issues.
---
Timed event not working as intended - Time pressure to fix it before event ends because post event fixes for an event would be silly.
---
I can see that, now, *splorp*ing in and out of the ground! Doctor's Shock would travel in a pulse along the floor... Not sure how to do Wraith's, though!

If these people could cause companies to go out of business by instituting boycotts, why am I still able to buy soap?
---
If I know this community people would just "downvote" you for anything. Also they should add some me rewards for devotion high rank etc but they seem to no care
---
He‚Äôs very fun to play as, I usually stack both dress add-one, it lowers the chance of getting a skill check, makes it way harder to wake up. 
---
But survivors need to hear my bing bong.Otherwise why even play bing bong boi?
---
Stealing it. Now I'll be posting it before every game, and handing out grades and all of that. Teacher might not have been able to become a killer, but they sure as hell gon become a survivor
---
Maybe if shaggy used 2

---
People call it vessel? We say lamp or lantern.
---
Nice answer to a valid argument. Kinda makes you look like you're just crying and have no points on what you're saying.
---
No you can still get the skin and then whenever you get feng she will have it. Same with all past skins and even store bought skins for characters you don‚Äôt own. 
---
That explains a lot.
---
then play killer crybaby survivors 
---
I hear you friend, and sorry you‚Äôre getting downvoted.  Some console players have no troubles and that‚Äôs great... but for those of that do, it really is frustrating. I constantly feel like taking a break but the sheer addictiveness of the game keeps reeling my masochistic self back in all because I get the occasional good not-frustrating day. It is a bit annoying to feel like you‚Äôre low-priority to the devs. 
---
Because you still spent those bp on addons to generate that bp as killer? Not sure what your point is.
---
r/killthecameraman
---
I LOVE pixel art.  This is awesome! :)
---
True but i think we can agree that at rank one you can still win and even 4k because there are still many survivors that arent that good
---
Once they fix the ranking/matchmaking system they will need to do some balancing
---
What they should do asap is to do something about the windows on ironworks/torment creek/groaning store house/wretched shop
---
Overall get rid of the RNG or controll it better 
---
Thank you! I use Photoshop CC for all of my art, but this was definitely a different (more tedious) process than my usual stuff. For these, I used the killer portraits as references and guides--laid them out, separated each image into 5x5 pixel blocks, and then tried to determine the average color of each block. Because some of the killers were really monochromatic (like the Hag), I actually started pixelating in these really wild, crazy tones--they kind of looked like heat maps. After that, I went over and tweaked whatever hadn't translated well, blending and smoothing things out. Thank you for asking!
---
Yeah I was worried about the achievement but got a good match second try for it and the group teabagged hard and I got all four easily.
---
Don‚Äôt pretend like you don‚Äôt love it.
---
You seem really mature and this gives what you said a lot of credibility and not at all makes you look immature! You should try a debate club, I'm sure you'd be the king there.
---
For Pig, they kinda wanted it to reference the source material. The Reverse Bear Trap was one of the most famous traps from the Saw series, and it was what Amanda had in her game, so it was a good choice. If the traps didn't time down at all, they really wouldn't be threatening except at endgame. 
---
Legion was definitely poorly designed and not very well thought out though.
---
Aww, thanks! I did make a set for that purpose (just killer so far, not sure if I'll do survivor), but I didn't want to spam the subreddit so I won't be posting it for a while. If you want a copy of the files, just find me on Twitch (RoryDiesALot) or Discord (Rory#8450) and I'll send them over!
---
I ain't wasting my precious fire cr-I mean light grenade on their dumb mistakes, I'm getting out and getting my 5k
---
Thank you! Now I want someone to actually make this a playable game, haha.
---
I just noticed how awkwardly I worded that, my bad.
---
well, you see, if it's a sole intention to 3 gen to make them not leave the map it's one thing. you still are able to complete a gen rather quickly. in less than 10 minutes, 100%. I had many 3 gen Docs and Legions and myself was a Doc left with 3 gens. it would take me and even a team of randoms around 3-4 minutes. sometimes less, sometimes maybe 6 minutes. we'd actively get points and everyone was participating in actions they supposed to be doing - gen progression and gen regression. the killer also uses his power actively to maintain the gen. you're saying of a very specific situation that I personally have never encountered in 2k hours. Doctor would always chase and always hit/hook. so I really can't tell if what you're saying is even real since you didn't provide any proofs and I have never seen such a thing myself. 
---
while this shit scenario with survivors immersing when 1 gen only completed and has no intention in completing it is often times in my games. it only depends on time they immerse. anything under 5 minutes to me is okay. but over I start to get pissed. usually when they realise no gen is progressed enough for them to complete it, they either say fuck it and work on any or just come to die. and I've seen multiple videos and posts of survivors immersing in other people's games. so, yeah. 
---
Then you can run Dead Hard, and it gives you a choice.
---
Exactly as soon as the chase starts he gets into the locker...
---
lmao sorry i get kinda anxious and can‚Äôt control my camera moving sometimes 
---
Any pallet that is not mindgameable, like the killer shack, cow loop...
---
I'm a main killer... It's just that I actually have a brain and can recognize that the other side has problems too, something that you seem to not fully understand. How are you suposed to "cleanse the totems" when there's no voice chat exactly? Are you suposed to cleanse 5 totems by yourself or hope that your teammates do it? It's not viable to do it since if let's say one of your teammates cleanses 1 totem and you cleansed 4, you're gonna be looking for the 5th one forever.
---
You and your all survivors are salty crybabies mentality needs to stay away from this community, it only makes it worse for everyone else.
---
I can see your DS bulging thru Lorie's pants. Shame you didn't get to use it. 
---
What platform? I haven‚Äôt noticed this on PC
---
Which part is wrong?
---
Sounds more like you're just bad. Always assume a Killer has B&amp;C and from there you can either get close, to be within the 40m range or you can move far away to put more distance between you and the Killer. Not a bad argument in the slightest.

Is this 'meme' based on the iraq war? The one that killed over a million innocent people based on false premisses. Nice thing to joke about btw
---
Seems to mostly be a console thing based on what others are saying, hopefully they fix it up for you guys soon!
---
DbD has always been a grind. Always. It's the reason Legacy even exists. You honestly expected otherwise for an event?
---
Gaming in general tends to be a grind. Just play the game and focus on the gameplay instead of the end goal, that will only lead to you burning yourself out. There never will be an end goal anyway. Something else will always show up to add more grinding. But if the gameplay is fun then it isn't really a grind, but a nice little extra when having fun.

I suggest giving yourself short term goals instead. Little personal challenges, achievement unlocks, prestige 3, all perks for your mains, trying out new builds, anything really. As you get them done, you will naturally earn event points anyway. 2 birds, 1 stone. And you wont be stressing over some event that isn't even going to mean much in the end anyway. The cosmetics aren't event exclusive anymore, so no point fussing over them.
---
I only really want 2-3 of the cosmetics. Huntress body, Ace legs, and Feng head look the best and fit rather well with other cosmetics for more custom looks on all 3 people. So I just need to earn 3 coins at most. 2 really is good enough as I can do without Feng's head from not playing her.
---
David/Dwight and Huntress/Pig 
---
I've not been having problems getting games other than waiting an extra 5-10 seconds to get into a survivor game. 
---
It might have something to do with location as I can play perfectly fine with other players in Asian regions. A few disconnects here and there but that might just be the usual survivor salt
---
Aka they aren't doing anything
---
The amount of salt I got in the last two days was crazy lol. I don't really want to play killer right now if I'm going to be reported every other game.
---
*Oh the sweet blood, it sings to me.*
---
Whenever I try shit like this I wind up bodyblocking my own teammate and get them killed. Props
---
oh well, made the day for that meg, ruined it for poor wraith
---
Hunters mark is kinda useless, just don't do gens if you're the obby.  This would be one of the perks that would show itself when it's discovered, like dying light or huntress' lullaby, so just don't do gens.
---
Blood echo is basically the doctors addons but a perk.
---
and you'll be one of them is kind of a crappier Play with your food, because killers will be losing their bloodlust all the time during a chase. and with Play with your food you'll be faster in and out of chases. 
---
and as u/K_sper said the power is just billy 2.0
---
I'm simple, I see sw and dbd together, I upvote. 
---
sorry to be mean but it's true :/
---
"Our team are working on this around the clock to fix it as soon as possible"
---
- every game developer on every issue ever lol
---
Good man. I‚Äôll contact you on discord eventually lul
---
Which one?
---
I've had hit or miss experiences with killers when it comes to that. Cause one time my 3 teammates all DC'ed (within 30 seconds of the start of the game) against a one-hit hatchet down Huntress, and she tried so hard to kill me. :\
---
But anyhoo - I repaid back the karma last night with a Feng Min, as I was the Doctor. Killed her team quickly, with them only getting 1 gen done. She came out and was bobbing her head to me, so I let her do a gen and get the hatch. I almost always give in to survivors who do that, cause I know the feeling. 
---
30 minutes to find a lobby, 3 hours to get a game without a killer dcing because they didn't like the look of someone in the lobby.
---
I've adjusted my phrasing a bit. It's difficult to get my point across as an ESL.
---
I don't mind this event.  I like all cosmetics besides Aces set.  Both sides are selfish when playing normally,  why would this change during an event? They cannot please everyone.  The only thing that I don't like is that these cosmetics are going to be always available.  I don't care that people can buy them but I just think that after the event ends so should any way to get these cosmetics.  It's cool being able to throw on the Donkey Jacket for David knowing that someone can't just go out and buy it.  
---
Much like this game, "A corpse, should be well left alone."
---
oh god oh frick 
---
Sure, thanks for clarifying :)

Once you see it you can never unsee it

WOO WOO WOO DID I JUST HEAR SOMEONE JOKING ABOUT THE DEATH OF A MILLION INNOCENTS? BETTER CHECK YOUR MICROAGGRESSIONS, BRO
---
This isn't the high quality content I signed up for but it's the high quality content I needed.
---
Darn I don't want the Ochido players to go 90% of them are adapt the game and try and juke like their "Lord" does so they are easy kills. The other 10% are carrying the other 90% so if you ignore the Claudette with the pink trousers you get 3 very easy kills.
---
For you and /u/meldsher 
---
Someone recorded their RBT data and analyzed the results. The conclusion: [it is 50% per box. Box is not predetermined.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agpne1/feb_5th_we_will_all_work_together_beause/)
---
I don't really care for the skins and I think the whole mechanic with the chalice is kinda fun with having to keep on to it for as long as possible while at the same time being more visible while carrying it.  
---
I'm also getting pretty decent BP amounts too + even more firecrackers.  
---
That's from the survivor side though, it's pretty mediocre for killers (though if you dont care about the coins, queue times are great now).
---
I saw it when I saw someone sharing a screenshot of their Feng. I was sure I had seen something similar then clocked what it was. If only she was Asian it would have been perfect.
---
Scrap them both.
---
That actually looks really interesting. I‚Äôll probably give it a try later today. 
---
I do wish, the Legion was ya know, scary looking, but with all those outfit her/she still isnt one bit scary looking at all. 
---
If you honestly think its that easy to bait Dead Hard you must not play rank 1. All the survivor has to do is look back to see if the killer is lunging. They won't use it if you are doing nothing.
---
Sure, **IF** it happened exactly as you said. Can you prove it? Will any other survivor from that game also put in a report with you or can you provide a video of it?
---
I'm not saying you're wrong, I'm just saying you need to look at it from the perspective BHVR will have. You're just some rando to them and your sad story doesnt matter. You could be lying to me right now and I don't have a good way to tell. Neither will they, and blind faith in the good nature of some guy from reddit isn't enough.
---
How many times you plan on whoring out that "imagine" line, chief?
---
It works better when you're not acting like a complete tool.
---
This ^ if you have looped someone for the ENTIRE game and your team mates are too arsehole to take a hit (say you are solo surviving) DS gives you the chance to escape having been tunnelled all game. If you get looped all game and NOED activates and you get 1 kill that isn't you being skilled it is you getting an instant down. 
---
If you are shit with NOED you can get 1 ez kill.
---
If you are shit with DS you either miss the skill check or buy yourself a few seconds before being downed again instantly. 
---
If you are good with NOED you don't need it. Or it gives you an ez 4k
---
If you are good with DS you won't use it at all or you might be able to avoid a face camp.
---
Man, that hatchet while he was walking away was the icing on the cake
---
That's a bad move A Little Ant also I've played with you before as your killer
---
Having a blue check mark on twitter makes you less credible nowadays tbh
---
Compare one average game as killer to one average game as survivor (including accounting for not surviving) and tell me that the bloodpoints difference is worth only two add ons.
---
A comment you chose to say to me instead of the fool who originally wrote the post I edited. Morons and trolls don‚Äôt want reasoned argument, and won‚Äôt return any if you give it to them. Why bother giving him a detailed response of why he‚Äôs wrong when he‚Äôs just going to reply with the same lack of intelligence? 
---
People think using ‚Äútrigger‚Äù words like ‚Äúcrybaby‚Äù and ‚Äúsalty‚Äù and all that stuff are like gateways underneath the skin of others when in reality it‚Äôs laughable. Even your comment here is a silly attempt at trying to declare yourself as someone more mature. Yet here you are, participating in the same conversation, using the same tactics. The truth is that you are simply as trashy and dumb as everyone else here, and yes, I do include myself in that. The difference being that I will at least own up to it. 
---
It‚Äôs reddit, buddy. Learn not to take it too seriously.

*Shitted smh these people and their spelling.
---
damn, you yeeted on him
---
This post is great
---
Ahhh. Gotcha. 
---
I don't think it's easy, I know it is. I'm a rank 2 Myers Hag main. Please use DH, they cause me the least grief out of every other exhaustion perk.
---
Laurie and her shank
---
Red paint brush and class photo man. Always get a 4K with that gem. Put them all to sleep, hit them all once, use nurses calling to find them all again. If I'm fast enough, I pretty much always see all Survivors at all times and they have no clue until it's too late. Love that combo.
---
Buff by daylight
---
What even causes this?
---
Actually you dont have to spam. Just cancel as late as possible
---
Please make more. Please&lt;3
---
Only change I‚Äôd make is a QoL one. Not letting the killer know if you missed your skill check due to their dribbling. Then dribbling will work in your favor if they do it too much. 
---
I love getting a lantern early, losing the killer in 3 chases, doing 3 gens by myself, but then at the very end the twice hooked Meg, who did nothing all game, watches me get NOED smacked and hooked, takes my dropped lantern, and has now left with over double the coin points for being shit at the game and leaving me to die.
---
For those of you wondering,
---
Buying the base game gives you these characters:
---
Both: Trapper, Wraith, Billy, Nurse, Dwight, Meg, Claudette, Jake, Nea.
---
PC: Bill, David, Huntress
---
Console: Ace, Feng, Hag, Doctor
---
The reason for this is because PC players got Huntress free, so pay an extra $10 for this ‚Äúspecial edition‚Äù (only edition available), and get the two DLCs. Oh, and console still has to pay for Huntress.
---
It does affect gameplay slightly, as you can climb some objects that you normally cant (such as the shorter haybails on coldwind maps)
---
*Gets hit anyway*
---
Me: I HIT E WTF IS THIS BULLSHIT LAG

David King can finally have the fight he's been looking for.
---
Not necessarily. What I did was usually phased out from the hook into the area I was expecting to have a vessel hanging from a lantern. Abandoning the hook immediately gave a window for the hooked member's team mates to grab them. Before they did I usually got the lantern down (you can see me do it in a matter of seconds in the video, actually). Most of the matches I didn't even use any add ons. I was surprised at how many points I was getting. Sometimes they managed to do the gens and escape and I still got more points than I would've gotten from a 4k without getting the lanterns (taking down four lanterns, for example, gets you 4x3=12  points extra). Imagine facing a SWF group where they all used a red envelope. That's 2 (base) + 4 vessels you can take out. 6x3 = 18 points from the lanterns alone. Get 9 hooks = 18 points.
---
Why is the new head's hair reddish? It was black on previews? I really wanted it but seeing how it looks now I'm not a huge fan
---
Screw you dude, my dad died by someone trapping him in a bear trap and putting him on a meat hook. I find it extremely offensive that you're on this sub reddit.
---
Yes. Yes, you should. This is amazing
---
Comes with the new killer: 
---
The Tax Evader
---
Ah yes, nothing says balanced perk like completely defining the match. DS, even with dribbling, wastes a insane amount of the killers time without enduring, it can single handedly cost them the game. NOED results in the same premise, where a killer can be doing terrible and boom, gens done, he turns a "everyone escapes" match into a "I got three kills" match. They BOTH need to be changed at the same time. Currently they're both just perks that are no fun to play against. As a killer, its "Oh good, a person i have to ignore the whole match, lest I waste too much time on them and cost me the entire match." And as survivor its "I've outplayed this killer every step of the game and preformed really well, I realy earned my escape. Oop, NOED, no one wants to save me because they'll just go down too, guess i don't get to escape even though i was better then them. Guess the entire endgame no longer exists because NOED removes any semblance of altruism at the end, as its not worth giving the killer more kills when he hasn't earned them at all." NOED and DS are BOTH problems in the game that functionally ruin the game for both sides, and they both need a change. Its not a "get good" matter. No perks should dictate an entire match. No perks on the killer should turn a no man into a 3 man once the gens are powered. No perk on survivor should allow them to drag a killer around the map for one chase, then just say "lol, lets do it again" As chases are everything in dbd. When you mess up, you should not be given another chance as freely and time wasty as DS does. Skill checks are not hard to do it really doesn't take skill, it takes timing, really big difference. Maybe not Nerfs to them even, tbh, I think they should be changed completely, like Tinkerer. 
---
indeed
---
You could use space for gens. 
---
Oh no don't worry, I can be all toxic and a troll sometimes. It's just that if you're trying to seriously discuss something MAYBE arguments will be better than trying to insult someone else like this is high school.
---
Sounds shady AF. 
---
Two DC‚Äôs. Can‚Äôt get the achievement of someone DC‚Äôd.
---
oh no
---
I'm disappointed that u/DJRogan didn't reply with something like:
---
"That's cool...so how do you wanna split rent?"
---
Hopefully I can try this before they patch it.

Seeing you played Freddy, overconfidence likely killed them more than you did.

I expect nothing and I'm still disappointed

Tons of people exploiting this right now.   Basement LF with insidious with rev chainsaw is completely silent and instadowns anyone who enters. 
---
Have you never seen hostage doc? A 3-gening Doctor is a whole different thing. A 3 gen Doc is trying to slow the game down and kill you.
---
Hostage Doc is trying to waste your time. He'll eventually lose but it's going to take a long ass time. Just like an immersed Survivor.
---
Plus it's not even an argument of "Does that even happen?" It doesn't matter if it's rare. If someone does do it then it's bannable via the dev's response.
---
Man you see some pc rank 1 killers complaining every now and then but nothing rivals the amount of posts about swf and it‚Äôs long wait times, and right now there are 0 killers complaining about wait times. ‚ÄúAlways have killer mains posting‚Äù is a bit of an overstatement. 
---
On a less direct note, the dodging will always happen because of stuff like toolboxes or p3, but I‚Äôve had to dodge recently because I get matched with some poor guy who‚Äôs been waiting 20 minutes and lives in the goddamn Western Hemisphere so I dodge because he has 600 ping and don‚Äôt wanna deal with infinite dead hard. That‚Äôs probably a good reason why dodging has become more prevalent.
---
Lol yes the tvs are the problem dr house
---
Bugger meüôÑüôÉ can‚Äôt believe these devs patch the spot where they leak the tiniest amount of money but completely avoid patching the game so it can be fucking played.
---
15k on add-ons? Even an ultra-rare add-on is only 7k. Lets be honest, the add-ons which people get and use most frequently are yellows and greens. 9-10k at most.
---
For me win is when you t-bag at exit gates and killer DC's
---
So thats why Im getting dodged so often.I just bought the gold and gravy jacket for ace and he looking kinda thicc.
---
They can‚Äôt do shit right can they
---
It's the thumbnail of one hybrid panda video right
---
Lol me when I didn't know how good the shack was üòÇ
---
So the numbers still make sence . Thanks for confirming. Im done with the conversation so enjoy talking to yourself.
---
Lmao.And then discover that the killer hard dc'd so you dont get any points.
---
This is photoshopped?
---
My personal take is as survivor: Survive.
---
As killer: Kill/Sacrifice two of the four survivors at minimum for a draw, three or more is a victory. 
---
Why isn‚Äôt this taken down for saturated content. I‚Äôve seen this post like 12 times.  
---
Nope. Took the photo myself.
---
Damn right dude. I played solo as survivor for the first 3 tokens and god damn that took longer than it should. On one playthrough I was literally bled and killed on first hook three consecutive times by "teammates" refusing to save me and just doing gens even if clearly the killer is chasing/hooking someone far away. 
---
Summer BBQ was pretty good
---
that's mighty interesting 
---
This is the beautiful content I need in my life
---
All of the survivors with death. No one escapes death.
---
nothing you say makes sense lmfao. apparently im arrogant and a stereotypical salty survivor main because i think people are dumb enough to focus so much on the event. lmfao
---
DS must be way better on PC than console. On console it‚Äôs actually hard to hit the skill check on console on account of the low frame rate. It‚Äôs a wasted perk slot on console for that reason. 
---
NOED is never as easy as cleansing all the totems. If you‚Äôre not playing SWF, there‚Äôs no way of knowing if all of them are cleansed before the gates are available. I‚Äôve said it lots before on this sub but there needs to be an indication to the survivors that the totems have been cleansed. Maybe a 1% buff to healing speed. The buff itself is not important but notifying the survivors that all of them have been cleansed is important. Alternatively, making NOED appear on 2 totems where only one has to be cleansed would be an option, too. I‚Äôm much less fond of that idea as it‚Äôs a pretty harsh nerf to NOED.
---
I don't agree with your average bps either, but okay. Have a nice day.
---
Billy players are most often nice/silly like this from my experience. More so than other killers I mean.
---
Killers have a more gameplay damaging affect but neither side is really more toxic. All toxic actions are done to piss of the other side  but none are really anymore toxic than the other, whether it be teabagging or hitting someone on the hook, blinding at every pallet or camping a survivor, it‚Äôs just a bunch of d bags being d bags
---
You are too negative about things.
---
Unrelated but just asking, is there a hard cap on earning the coin progression? 
---
Yeah why is this a thing. 
---
Problem: The devs have explained how the boxes work themselves, and it's not that. It's predetermined boxes.
---
Huntress is a DLC but it is free in the ps4 store
---
The dmc one is just edgy lol
---
Good times. Still some genuinely good moments in this ocean of salt
---
There probably is something going on with this update since I get random frame lag spikes whenever a gen is completed or a survivor is hooked. It only started happening this event
---
BUBBA BOY!
---
Legion's perception stat is -3
---
How many tokens have you gotten so far?
---
around two gens maybe.
---
Love this üòÇ
---
Oh, that I didn't realize. When I had it happen it didn't really mess around with it much cause it happened when I was farming in a game where only 2 loaded in.
---
Im GAY and I SHIT and PISS all over the place.
---
I guess you can say that this post bursted your bubbles. 
---
It wouldn't have much of an impact. The event shows that even with a mass exodus of Killers there's still enough to go around.
---
Good call.
---
Haha I actually made one of these for myself quite a while ago, it was kind of for me only tho since I have leg nerve junk cuz thanks car accident so it hurts really bad (24/7 my life sux) so its mostly chest and arms and back
---
I mean, you've seen it before because it's a super common traditional Chinese dress lol
---
So I‚Äôm not the only one having this problem huh
---
You only have to look at that smile once to figure out he is a GOD.
---
&gt;oints, I know it l
---
Damn If that is true that is insane. Guess I'll be using my offerings.
---
Surprised you didn't mention how if the killer dc's, the survivors lose all their event points that they would have earned if they haven't escaped yet.
---
Day 1 was fun, now I get hit from 10 feet away and there's a mori every match. IT'S FUCKING BROKEN!!!!!!!!!!
---
Is the wire extra lol. 
---
Nice!
---
I mean no life but also no money. Why would I pay for characters I‚Äôll never play?
---
You must be a really unfun person to be around. Like, buzzkill sorta unfun.
---
This is a work of art
---
the mechanic, the selfishness of survivors increased by a million, the grind is ridiculous &amp; you don't even get a lot bonus bloodpoints. 
---
the events in the past were hundred times better
---
indeed, fellow believer
---
Who actually checks that though lol
---
perk C:
---
Yes, the fight against a cruel society that says he must use Dead Hard, when all he really wants is to use Dance With Me &amp; Lithe!
---
Sometimes a sacrifice is needed
---
My emotions! MY EMOTIONS!
---
I found the best way to 4k for me is to equip Bloodwarden. For some reason the match never reaches end-game when I use it.
---
You realize that the videos aren't coming out live right? They're clips from the stream so it was probably from a few weeks ago. He'll probably have videos for another month at least. 
---
You know where the jigsaw boxes are placed no? So you can know where the trapped survivors are going for starters. Ofcourse if they get it on the first box that's very unfortunate, but even then you stalled or can hit them when they are going to this box.
---
Regarding the ambush, you're playing it wrong. At unsafe loops you can practically hit them all the time if u time it correctly, at safe loops its better to just get the loop or try to mind game them and still get an ambush.
---
Rank is a pretty indictivate because pig does snowball and has chase potential, you not knowing this showcases you're lower ranks.
---
The Hallowed Blight event was worse because survivors just killed themselves after getting their vial which was boring. At least they have an incentive to survive now.
---
This is really cool!
---
The only time clown has seen less than survivors after throwing his bottles
---
Maybe for a friend but i cant imagine how annoyed id be if i saved some stranger and he just ran to the exit gates and left

Hmmm... could have sworn I saw a video a while back where a killer picked someone up, they missed their DS, and a little indicator of the DS perk appeared on the killers screen right next to the killer perks, telling them of the failure. But I can‚Äôt find it again now.

She's a character in a realm about supernatural spidey legs keeping survivors in an eternal loop of dying, and killers in an eternal loop of killing. We don't question why she can see through a mask

inb4 comment about wanting Michael to slam them 
---
What do you even mean the frames are fine ever since they fixed the sloppy butcher bug it has been way better
---
XD
---
true. I'm killer main and even I think that's bullshit.
---
but for that I'd like them to make the gain for killer bit higher cause we get legit genrushed. as in not just people doing gens to escape but literally focusing only on it, leaving their buddies get to stage 2 and so on. 
---
and locating the lanterns is a huge choir on any killer that is not Billy or Nurse or Spirit. but even with Spirit I had hard time getting to lanterns in time. we just can't maintain the pressure. 
---
Yeah noed is very easy to counter in lery‚Äôs or the game with only solo survivors
---
i dont know what is going on inside his head these days
---
You bring up a fair point
---
Does the Huntress hate immigrants and interracial marriage now?
---
Michael went on a vacation to Italy.
---
Money ):
---
Let's just say 5 feet if the killers are 7 feet
---
Yeah i found the glitch accidentally in a kyf (on ps4) when trolling my friends. We had said no moris so I brought one and cancelled last second to scare my friend. Fun fact you can also carry survivors while tilted and get them to the same spots as you by dropping them. 
---
Fucking Wallmart
---
It looks a little snowy out there.

Kind of makes you wonder why DBD has no actual loading screen that we can look at while we wait for someone on a computer from 1950 to load in

&gt;Chest spawning right next to another intractable object and partially blocking said object so that you open the chest instead. Usually by vault spots

how does the game register when u take a hit for someone
---
I‚Äôve had the game for about 2 years, and every now and then I‚Äôd just buy one DLC. I mean, it‚Äôs like 8 dollars so that‚Äôs like a bag of chips and a drink to me.
---
I understand some Players might be too young (Which is weird given the games rating) but I think anyone with a job should be able to own at LEAST 1-2 DLCs, since they go on sale quite a lot
---

---
Lmao my team did? Girl. I usually do 3+ gens and 2+ saves a game. Miss me, cry baby. Just cause you face camp you think you deserve points üòÇ 
---
Woah hey I don't like 8 hours of squats, dips, and lunges after every match.
---
It‚Äôs not OP at all. Lockers block auras, distortion blocks auras, you can hide behind a gen to block the aura, or you could just fake the killer out by going in one direction then go another. 
---
I guess he brought it up because my name is NOLAgeek - he figured he could use it as a mean dig. (Which it is, knowing what I and most of my friends and family went through after the storm.)
---
what the fuck
---
Can't please everyone. I never play huntress and I primarily play shirtless david. It's free, and requires fairly little effort outside of just regularly playing the game to obtain. 
---
If they didn't face camp *that* close and hit someone as they approached then they could've downed another person easily.
---
furies? you mean like, spirit fury? It's an alright perk.
---
They "patched" other survivors getting points if the vessel carrier leaves.
---
Also: 0:42 potato survivor alert.
---
It‚Äôs real. If you look in the steam files it‚Äôs labeled ‚ÄúKenya.‚Äù It‚Äôs likely named that to not give clues to what the chapter is prior to the PTB. It used to be DLC2-DLC5, but I figured they changed it to countries so it would be easier to find it than numerical order. The only exception is Bill, whose folder is labeled ‚ÄúL4D‚Äù, which is obviously ‚ÄúLeft 4 Dead.‚Äù

why is wraith there? he's mediocre at best
---
Except that's A. cheating and B. People used it to get 100 of each add-on and offering, which, if you haven't played against certain iridescent offerings, completely breaks any game balance
---
Add me: DeltaForce2005 
---
I think this event has the best objective, as it's unique yet not overly intrusive or time consuming ~~like the fucking pumpkin spice plants.~~ That being said this event is easily the worst in terms of grind and payout. The Bloodpoint gains are a fucking joke and it takes ages to get even your *first* full set, with all 3 sets taking forever due to how the amount of points required keeps increasing.
---
I'm probably going to stop at 7 coins since I don't give a shit about the full Huntress set. The torso looks nice but I'm fine with my default axe and mask from last LNY.
---
You assume killers dont warm there points when people DC, same logic applies, 
---
So calm down child. 
---
damn, sucks D: I'm sorry
---
gj bhvr :)
---
It's whatever it is to you
---
I feel like I am constantly getting raped at 15 but no other levels. 
---
Thats my point is, no point of taking the lamp before all gens are done. After they are done, you don't really need objective points
---
you need to chill
---
Ya I remember people going full nectar kamikaze. I can honestly say though that I had fewer people suicide during that event than Ive had suicide during this event. In all my games as both surv and killer I get at least one.
---
'S BLOOD!
---
Lmao what? This isn‚Äôt about killers, first off. Secondly, they didn‚Äôt explain their comment clearly at all. Had they said what they meant the first time, there wouldn‚Äôt be anything to misunderstand. Made it seem like they tunnel / camp so get disconnected on and want points. Bye, little child. 
---
I actually really enjoyed the halloween event for how it was something fresh instead of what theyve been doing for every other event so far.
---
Bbq event was perfect. Do special gens get points. Hook on special hooks get points. It was a normal game or a farming game for everyone. Halloween was meh. Met some nice killers but wasn‚Äôt crazy fun. This event I have loved play normally if a person with a lantern is hiding non stop sandbag them take their lantern and leave. 
---
That got a giggle. 
---
What was their ping in the lobby?
---
also, before I finished the video I totally thought your title was referring to the doctor illusion lol
---
also, I love people who run Bond
---
Eh for some reason if you get hooked after all gens are completed while having a lantern if you die on that hook you still get your 45 points. At least you do on Xbox I know it's not intended but it helps whenever I run the killer around all game then get face camped at the end
---
All you gotta do is grab a key, find the first lantern, and leave through the hatch at the first possible point in the game. Then just repeat the process 99 more times. 
---
Fuck no letherface's chainsaw is already op the last thing he needs is that kind of range
---
Lmao ochido got banned for a legitamate reason, let the toxic ear tape channel die out in peace. The only people who really watch him and enjoy his content are not older then 12 tbh lol... 
---
Well, too late now, fricken tryhards lol
---
yesterday I was able to play only 2 matches within an hour as a survivor on Xbox One... the waiting time is ridiculous!   
---
today I can't play the game at all, the initialization error keeps appearing on the screen... wtf!?
---
My favorite part is that ochido isnt even good. He's just boosted, uses swf, abuses exploits, uses purple flashlights, and puts ear rape sound effects over a simple dodge that would be 100% predictable....
---
Even past this event I feel like these are the only types of games I ever get to play. BHVR just keeps doing shit to make playing this game solo an absolute chore and I'm sick of it frankly. I'm good at doing gens and I'm good at leading the killer on chases but if I'm doing the former then my teammates go down in a femtosecond and if I'm doing the latter then zero gens get done.
---
**Survivors:** Get hooked, stay there until death-phase 2 while all the glowing Survivors rush gens so they can escape with their 25 Points as quick as possible. One of the Glowy Survivors gets downed and quits. Have nobody try and and rescue you and die while everyone leaves as soon as they can. Fun.
---
**Killers:** Find a Survivor and hit them, they quit. Find another Survivor glowing from the lantern, hook him. He quits. Survivors realize they aren‚Äôt going to be able to escape and either DC or give up on the Hook trying to 4%. Fun.
---
What bugs me more is really that huntress skins are always the least interesting and always seem to have gigantic heads, which just looks unappealing
---
It wasn‚Äôt particularly high, yellow, but this was last month so I could be wrong. With all the recent ‚Äúkillers have too long of reach‚Äù posts lately, I felt compelled to post my own experience.
---
This is Google's definition for it if you're unfamiliar with the quote and classic movie "Chinatown" with Jack Nicholson: 
---
"Forget it, Jake. It's Chinatown" means "you can't change things, it's the way things are and the way they will be, regardless of how much you tilt at windmills. The line is about the futility of fighting injustices and darkness in the world.
---
Also there's a mansion in it that kinda looks like the Yamaoka Estate so...
---
Please, please do try to pull the shit this guy did, go ahead, time your vault to get in the way of the killer hitting the survivor while not blocking them from vaulting, please do get out alive afterward. Then you can think that this is 'unimpressive'.
---
I would get 3 letters burnt from the survivor teams max, and I didn't burn any as killer. I'm just giving the 7 vessels as an example of it being possible. It would require all of the players, including the killer player, to burn the letter offering. I wonder why you're not getting survivor groups that burn the offering. It's easy double bloodpoints.
---
Did they really say they fixed pallets in the last patch? I've had numerous occasions of 2 pallets right next to each damn other only after the most recent update
---
You need to go fuck yourself. You‚Äôre not gonna be rude as fuck and then play the ‚Äúomg like chill out! Why are you so aggressive‚Äù y‚Äôall are constantly mean to each other in this sub. I could say ‚Äúkillers and survivors have it equally hard‚Äù and there will be five people in my mentions calling me names and shit. This sub is toxic so imma talk to your goofy ass how I want to. Fuck off lol 
---
Didn't have to use it 
---
Survivors used to get the points for escaping with a lantern if only one person did while they were alive, now you have to be the one to escape with one.
---
Leatherface is considerably weaker than billy and requires an immense amount of game knowledge and skill to go against competent survivors, simply because he's bad
---
Stop bringing your salt into the equation, a oneshot that never lands isn't strong

Turn the Xbox completely off by holding the power button on the console. This happens to me sometimes.
---
Whispers is more reliable. Crows are inconsistent and immersed survivors dont scare them
---
I agree. 
---
I am a trapper main, and there are a few builds that always netted me results.
---
FIRST: BASEMENT TRAPPER
---
Agitation, Iron Grasp, Ruin, and Mad Grit/Territorial Imperative
---
This allows you to not only take the survivors to the basement, but also saves time and can allow you to either negate bodyblocking or monitor when survivors enter the basement. Combine this method with setting traps at all entrances to the basement once a person is hooked. Works especially well at the killer shack.
---
Addons: One of the trapper bags, the other is your choice. 
---
SECOND: EXPOSED TRAPPER
---
Hex: Haunted Ground, Devour Hope, No One Escapes Death, and Make Your Choice
---
This allows you to move throughout the map with little worry of whether you will down survivors, because it is not a matter of how, but when. Your goal is to use the perks that give exposed status to your advantage, and chase survivors without worrying about totems. Make use of the fact that Devour Hope is hidden to survivors until they are exposed, and also the fact that Make Your Choice works all game, and lasts for 60 seconds at tier 3. The only concern with thos build is gen rush, but the reward for completing the generators fast is N.O.E.D.
---
Addons: Both addons are your choice, but i recommend using one to darken your bear traps and placing the traps around gens. 
---
THIRD: GEN DEFENSE TRAPPER
---
Hex: Ruin, Pop Goes The Weasel/Dying Light, Discordance/Overcharge, and Brutal Strength
---
This allows a lot of flexibility in your playstyle, but with a few core requirements. As the match starts you have to walk straight to your Ruin totem, no exceptions; don't even pick up more traps. Once you reach your totem, put a trap in front of it to catch those who will try to cleanse your totem... If survivors disarm your trap, go straight back and reset it (unless it will be cleansed by the time you get there anyway). If you choose Pop Goes the Weasel, make sure to kick the generators that have progress, but aren't almost done, this way you get the most value out of the 25% regression. If you choose Dying Light, tunnel your obsession because when they die, the 25% speed penalty can slow the game down immensely. Discordance will allow you to break up survivors working together, which is a big plus, and it locates at least two survivors for map control. Overcharge can help to make generators more difficult, with the smaller first skillcheck plus the potential additional regression, and has no downsides for you. Brutal Strength is something you *need* in this build, as you will be kicking generators often, and the speed increase in doing so will assist in time management... not to mention the value it has in chases. Overall, the objective is to defend the generators for enough time to net you kills, and this give you a lot of defense.
---
Addons: I recommend at least one addon to increase your speed for placing traps, you don't want to save time with gens and then waste it placing traps. 
---
Let's be real, the are all good in their own ways, best build - DH, Lithe, SB, BL
---
Exactly. I can be in a chase with the killer for a good few minutes and no gens are being done. I keep Bond on, so I know exactly what they're doing. If they do fuck all then I will just run to them with the killer. 
---
Platform: Xbox One  
---
When loading the game I keep getting the initialization error  
---
Restarted my console AND the game itself a few times - didn't fix the problem
---
Legion man bad reeeeeeeeee
---
You misspelled "When the killer's not even chasing them"
---
SWF has a huge advantage over solo players, and every solo game makes that painfully apparent. I can't tell if someone's rescuing or if I should go for the save, and more often than not, by the time I start running over, they get rescued.
---
nice :)
---
No, I'm talking about disconnecting at the loading screen right after they see the offerings. It happens almost every time after the BPs is burned.I dont even go for the lanterns, I dont need the cosmetics. No, i dont tbag the exit gate I'm not an asshole, I usually just barely escape, so I'm not about to brag about it
---
we gonna live forever and borrowes time makes every save a safe one. get those fat stacks brother
---
Ooh thats why i didnt get any progress, gottcha
---
Ah.
---
I dunno I haven't experienced any bad reach at all in my survivor games. I think people are overstating it as usual 
---
Aww, you seem really cool too! Really sad, but good luck out there in the fog then &lt;3 
---
Doctor with two Terror Radius add-ons and Distressing can make his madness almost global and it's fucking great.
---
Pair with Unnerving Presence and it's like a free pip from everyone DC'ing
---
It does not.However you can just crouch at one side and the killer will swing behind them like a mad man.
---
*Self caring at pallets intensifies*

"WTF WHY DID HE LUNGE"
---
This was inspired by the holy trinity (peashooter, crazy dave, and 21 savage). construntive critsism only please and thanks you!
---
**NUT**
---
Same, but some posts on here make me reconsider, like that Cannibal vs Strode post was some bs
---
*Doin' gens, you?*
---
The Kenya Chapter can't you read
---
Thanks, you're very inspiring! :)
---
This is pretty old dude.
---
Oh god that sound extremely annoying to fight against 
---
You're going to get some hate for this because how dare you not want to be paired with a much more experienced player instructing other players
---
This poor Hag
---
I'm 19 and started watching horror movies because of this game. Never watched them as a kid but I love them now!
---
Yeah I thought he had infinite tier 3 with tombstone because I wasn't hearing the music turns out he was already in tier 2 on the verge of 3
---
Why not both? 
---
Maybe that's the problem... I have a game downloading now so maybe the game is waiting for it to end to uptdate itself
---
Why does it exist then
---
The fucking reposts on this sub are insane lol enjoy your e fame bud
---
I'm assuming Freddy, Meyers, Amanda and Leatherface are the bosses
---
Is it just me, or in the second picture (top right) it looks like Joey is really sad?
---
Spirit without hairs looks like she have cancer
---
Thanks so much game for pairing a rank 19 survivor with a rank 15 killer.Oh Im sorry.It doesnt affect you therefore it is completely alright.
---
Unfortunately their ranks average pretty close to yours and that's how it works in SWF groups. 
---
Because it's a PC port and they just left it there i assume
---
I really like your art! I wish I could draw like that :(
---
No. I'm not savant but any tips are helpful bc art is hard lol :p
---
Because 2 tracking perks is not a good build. You really only need 1 tracking perk. 
---
At what stack? 
---
Initialization error, told to restart game. I have done a hard reset which did not fix the problem.
---
*i need a heroo*
---
I'd just let him kill me. I don't have a house trap setup like Laurie did, and fighting Michael Myers straight up is the worst thing you could possibly do. So yea R.I.P. Me
---
Because what? You say that? 
---
Fair enough, but not everyone uses Calm Spirit. 
---
Only the event offerings show for everyone else.
---
I've had it to where I was teleported to the floor above me and directly in front of the doctor :/
---
Horrible choice of music and nothing really spectacular.Its good but not great.
---
Im having the same issue, gonna have to wait for them to fix it on their end. Luckily for me I have it on PS4 too.
---
Yeah i was gonna say, I cant say ive ever seen that happen, but it is funny and a tactic Ive never seen used, very risky to try though.  I find it amusing how this person wants them to be banned...like wtf
---
The highest envelopes I've seen burned are 3, and while killers definitely can earn as many points as a survivor, 7 vessels at 3 apiece for 21 points plus 4 survivors hooked three times each on a new hook each time for 24 points equals 45, that is absurdly difficult compared to the survivors goal of finish 5 gens and escape with a lantern for just as many. Also not sure red envelopes give double bp, bp gains from this event as a whole seem abysmal.
---
Wtf did I just watch lmao 
---
I know! I am still freaking out about this because he didn't hit me even though the chainsaw was right on me! 
---
Always time to learn! Haha 
---
If you want some sicc tutorials, Kate-Fox on DeviantArt has many that I've learned from! 
---
I wish you luck, friend! :)
---
We're going to farm forever requires 4 stacks to double your base bloodpoints. My point was often someone will screw over your team with unsafe hooks be it because they want to hotdog, suffer from incompetence in ability to do gens, or they have the perk as well. 
---
Not only do these people make you lose the game, but they prevent you from getting your 4 stacks.  Unless you are that person
---
I used to be worthless since it only helped against SFTS. But now that it keeps you calm in the wake of Doctors and Clowns? It‚Äôs pretty decent.
---
you can still get the cosmetics.
---
yep, I agree  
---
as a survivor main I'd still let Myers tombstone me :D
---
No because it‚Äôs a stupid way to build. Any smart killer won‚Äôt run 2 tracking perks because it‚Äôs a wasted slot. You really only need 1. 
---
he probably thought the ‚Äúggwp! :)‚Äù Guy was being sarcastic. 
---
I meant additional points not the actual offering. So like bps and those things. Wasnt clear.
---
On console, survivors are usually cocky going up against a Nurse (because it's pretty difficult), but just the other day i got a gen grab within the first 30 seconds and I'm pretty sure they all shit themselves. Feelsgoodman
---
I will play what I like 
---
Great I cant unsee that because of you
---
NO. BOUNDS.
---
Seriously, that‚Äôs messed up
---
It‚Äôs better for sure, but I don‚Äôt see it that often. Who knows, maybe now that Spies is actually a good perk people will start running it more and more. 
---
Sorry, someone must say that haha
---
Well an offering does not make you good at the game.
---
Usually :) is a toxic thing to do
---
Use of sarcasm doesn't mean you can use slurs and insult people though?
---
That‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm just saying if you want to be an efficient killer you shouldn‚Äôt be running 2 tracking perks. 
---
The SWF is strong here
---
That's the point I don't play killer
---
Wow, your ability to shoot over things and thread the needle is cray cray.
---
people without a job are.
---
When you pass a test that you didn't cheat on but the teacher thinks you cheated and gives you a 0%
---
Lmao 9/11 was fuckin awesome bro
---
Better gun suggestion: I can use it on myself when my teammates are bad
---
Slam me instead micheal
---
Yes officer, this post right here. 
---
It takes a good team. The strat? Be in position from the side, have a teammate stand right behind them so they can bodyblock a grab/hit, them unhook with borrowed time. Alternatively you can have someone go down saving you and then have someone flashlight save the guy who just unhooked you. 
---
One rank 2 lol... why not chase the other guys?
---
Check the updates, maybe that's the problem, haven't checked mine yet
---
Lmao I wish. 1920x1080
---
I played against a freddy with huntresses and yellow dress. I got 2 skillchecks within 5 seconds of repairing the gen, but it was almost done, ao I did them both and I got grabbed off right before the generator was completed and that generator never got completed that match
---
I like stealth builds because it makes me feel like I‚Äôm playing the game how it‚Äôs intended to be played, stealthing around and avoiding the killer at all costs. 
---
I remember that ochido got basement blocked (with an active rbt on) and somehow he got the user banned for that (even tho the devs have already said that if you are blocking someone with a rbt you couldn‚Äôt get banned)
---
It really was üò¢ I'm sure you can imagine my anger when it happened
---
Imagine shooting Michael Myers off a ledge then going over to see where he is and he's not there.
---
He was only paired with me because of his 4-person queue. Not only that, does it look like I killed anyone? Here's a hint: no.
---
what's the deal with airpods?  
---
not everyone who has them is rich  
---
some homeless in LA have iPhones, are they considered rich?
---
I can't wait for you to get to 69,420
---
His special power is that he says the n word.
---
Ironic that people are rallying for him, huh? The hero we don't need
---
Match doesn't seem to add up, it should be 25% for the first, 33% for the second, 50% for the third and 100% for the last
---
Watch your back, Quentin will want a word with you very soon.
---
OP is totally wrong, but bugger off with the "you're not ranked high enough" shit
---
Sorry I can't hear you over my airpods, I don't speak poor
---
Well if you let all 3 of them show up odds are they are going to get the unhook if they are competent, the clown should have just gotten a quick hit off on the first person to the hook and hope it either buys more time or ends up getting him another down.

I‚Äôve found if I get in a lobby with 3 people and it doesn‚Äôt find anyone within the first minute or two it isn‚Äôt worth waiting (on console at least)

I for one feel like the way pig works was a good choice

What?

the church of ace doesn't want a war, we want peace

---
This is the grade A shitposting I live for on this sub
---
I was trying to derank from rank 1 so i picked freddy who i've never played with only fired up 1 and no addons and decided to only slug people. I 4k'ed 4 games in a row. I want to make an actual freddy slugging build now.
---
PS4 problem where I will be running from the killer and they will be way behind me and swing. Suddenly I am downed and then teleported to their location when I was clearly not near them. 
---
During the Halloween event didn‚Äôt the que times go crazy because surv mains filled up their vials quick and needed killer vials next?
---
Don't know why something like this is happening, it's like this event just let everyone from other different places in the world join in even though their ping is shit. 
---
DAMUDAMUDAMUDAMU!
---
If I recall correctly, Robert Englund made up that line on the spot.
---
When the killer is so bad that you give the credit for any kills to survivors.
---
Same on PC , 3 people lobby bug. Wait one minute and leave.
---
you kidding, right? Hollowed Blight was not in the slightest on killer's side cause in order to get a vial you needed 6 event hooks not just 2 cankers. for that you'd need at least 3 people apart from yourself to use the offering. which was disgustingly rare apart from first couple days of event. the queue for red rank killers was often times 20+ minutes. I'd sit for 45 too just to get a team that used 1 offering. that's why they made it so you could earn the vials that are good for both sides later. also, survivors could have just filled their vials and die. didn't need anything else. 
---
Just know if you‚Äôre not running BT as well &amp; farm me, I‚Äôll make sure to fuck you over with bond :)
---
If this is true, then what would be the use of the addon that adds 1 box?
---
Gotta love...
---
#People complaining about wait times when this is what console players deal with when trying to play SWF's everyday
---
I'm aware, I'm just asking if it's been like this since NOES since that was England and they stuck to that pattern to make it simple.
---
Certainly not a waste of points. Burning one lets you obtain points for event objective related things.
---
Simply grabbing a Lantern is 1,000 points and then you'll receive 500 every so often (I believe it's every 30 seconds) and if you escape with one that is 5,000. It's worth noting that these points don't interfere with your regular point gain. Meaning you can hit the regular 32k max and still have event related points push that limit.
---
Not sure on the point gain for Killers as I have yet to try.
---
I was just able to login so maybe try it now?
---
Devs need to change it so that killer is matched up with the highest rank survivor. No reason not to.
---
Bind activate ability to L2/LT
---
More like this specific event. The game is basically unplayable for me at this point. 
---
There was also the issue of the Event Point progression not working.
---
They are the same price for common item, add-ons, and offering. Stop complaining about pointless crap.
---
There really is not much of a skill differential there. At all.
---
You know that it is not the same as the differential between 15 and 2. Come on.
---
nah, everything is up-to-date
---
Tbh I'd prefer this over him running into the window. Sounds hilarious xD
---
It was fine for me at first but today almost every game has brain dead Survivors crouching around the map too scared to touch Gens because of their precious Lantern.
---
Hell I had a game earlier where I managed to solo 3 Gens before any others were done. No one died during that time and only 2 people got hooked. What they were doing all of that time is beyond me.
---
I did actually, but it was difficult playing against a rank 3 Borrowed time, dead hard, and the other David king perk whose name's evading me...
---
It‚Äôs a game, if I want to slug my opponent, emphasize on the opponent part I will. As a killer your job is to kill as many survivors as you can, and if I have to use a 5 blink nurse, and an ebony Mori, then I will gladly spend BP and will.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be fun for the non-experienced survivors in the group if they played with their experienced friend trying to teach them the ropes.
---
Nevermind I found it myself. Thanks for nothing
---
haha probably along the Chainsaw, which will be just a giant chainsaw roaming around the maps. It can cut thru pallets and walls, so long T walls LOLOLOLOL
---
Daaaamn. Well that‚Äôs cool!
---
Doubt. Probably just a coincidence.
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Yeee
---
I don‚Äôt play on console, I can imagine using a controller on nurse is just awful. I respect console players in the sense they can play in all awful conditions and still enjoy the game.
---
Are you really talking about we're gonna life forever? The perk that only just gives extra bp for unhooks? Bruh
---
thats great and all, but this isnt normal for PC, so I was wondering what was up, Sorry ur console wait times are shitty 
---
i find games well in ones and twos. i guess 3 people parties are just buggered.
---
Haha, nice 
---
This somehow all sounds like people acting like cunts during the event. That's doesn't mean the event itself is bad. No matter how the devs make a event, people will never change.
---
Evil Incarnate - achievement - kill 4 survivors with Tier 3 Meyers. 
---
He used 2 ultra rare additions to get this. The tombstone which doesn't derank to T2 meyers after a kill, and the hair which says you stay in T3 once in there. 
---
Then, 2 people just DC so he can't get the achievement. RIP ultra rare addons.
---
Yesterday when you made that spirit comic thingy I was legit hoping so much that you would make a Julie or Susie one and I woke up to this little present &lt;3
---
r/The_visconti
---
This isn‚Äôt about console at all.
---
Us console nibbas don‚Äôt have the privelage :(
---
What? 
---
Ya and most people don't know because console players really have had no voice on this issue. I just find it funny how I see it finally happening to OC and people are loosing their shit.
---
Well... Fuck
---
*misses the point*
---
While his response was definitely unjustified, if you sweep the killer really hard and put ggwp :) in the chat I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre expecting. It‚Äôs the same if the killer gets a 4K in three minutes with five gens left. If a killer does that and puts gg in the chat they‚Äôre doing it to be a dick.
---
You‚Äôre just asking for a toxic response if you taunt someone like that no matter what side you‚Äôre playing, what game you‚Äôre playing, whether you‚Äôre even playing a game or an irl sport.
---
Thats what I thought: no more responses from you. I can see on your profile that youre literally rank 13-14 hardstuck, thats actually embarrasing as fuck lol. L2p pig before you form any opinion, for that matter learn the game before you form any opinion.
---
Rip then bro. If you‚Äôre on ps4 I have atleast 72 BPS we could swf and I could burn some for you.
---
This is literally the definition of confirmation bias. 
---
"but the posts my friends made said it is?"
---
lol come on
---
This sub always overstates everything all the time. I've never been in such a dramatic community in my life
---
Nobody asked about console. This is a PC (and all other platform) issue.
---
Are people not allowed to report issues if they are on PC just because console has had similar issues?
---
*continues to miss the point*
---
...If they want to "learn the ropes" then they should do the tutorials and play some games with other beginners 
---
Why does this logic, in your mind, only apply to survivors? What a blatant double standard 
---

Dude maybe consider a career in this? It looks great!

Rank 15s really don't know either 
---
calm down
---
This has happened to me too though i'm on Xbox. was really upset i didn't get any progression to my next coin.
---
Yeah it seems like this is a problem with no perfect solution sadly, especially since rank isn‚Äôt a good indicator of skill.
---
Or not?I hate people who assume every game is consisted of 4 man swf.Its just not true.
---
That‚Äôs exactly why. DBD doesn‚Äôt have the playerbase to region lock people, would be my guess.
---
haha loveit

&gt; I'm rank 1(as I already said it doesn't mean much) and I can form my own opinions just fine maybe next come up with a reasonable argument instead loL yoUrE bAd LeaRn tO plAy scRub

You have been exposed and such your 'opinion' is completely irrelevant.
---
&gt; Pig is not a good killer she's mid tier at the very best please try and explain to me with what little common sense you might have why she's better than spirit and huntress
---
Pig is a good killer, I gave you the arguments last comment and 2 comments ago. 
---
Regarding spirit and huntress: this is not my list.
---
What exactly are you gonna ban her for? Killing you? She‚Äôs the killer.
---
Turn Xbox off and unplug it for 10 seconds. When Xbox live shits out it usually gives you this error on dbd until you pretty much fully reboot your system. 
---
It's because you have it backwards, the killer isn't the power role in this game.
---
This made me laugh! Thanks! 
---
Yeah you do.At rank 19 you barely played 5 matches.If you think thats enough then I have nothing left to say to you.
---
I had the same thing happen to me.
---
Platform: PS4
---
Description: Played one killer and two survivor games before realizing I was not getting event points. Got the extra BP but no progression. After match, event screen did not pop up. Lost out on at least 70 points. Restarting the game fixed the issue, but those progression points are lost forever.
---
Yes but it was true when they said they're a 4-man SWF. Who's assuming now? 
---
Not with killers, you don't get to keep items if you kill everyone like survivors do when they escape. So if you want to play with specific items you have to poor BPs into them. If you like to play multiple killers than every point counts!
---
Average ChapoTrapHouse fan. A massive oversensitive oikophobe who is an enemy of the western people. :)
---
oof a nerve has been s t r u c k
---
Can't make that assessment from this video. Either one could've started the toxic behavior first.
---
Screw you.Why are survivors allowed to have a useless perk in their loadout.Completely unfair.You sound like a toxic Claudette/s.
---
I don't run BT but only go for safe saves, that or I'll bodyblock the killer and lead them away so that someone can get the safe save on you. Better than leaving you on the hook!
---
this is so cool omg. talent
---
I think you‚Äôre misunderstanding. Neither of us were taunting the killer. We both said gg because it was a good game, and the smile was meant to be friendly, not sarcastic. It doesn‚Äôt matter if I did shit or great, I always say GG. 
---
His overreaction at a polite gesture, isn‚Äôt uncommon and quite childish honestly.
---
r/shitpostcrusaders is leaking
---
Still you.You clearly did not mention this earlier so I dont really want to believe you.
---
&gt;Not that it would make a difference to complain all day

[Yet here you are 6 hours later, complaining about it all day.](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/am5lzn/comment/efjhglj?st=JRMGJI6M&amp;sh=940a14fe) 
---
Yeah but in OP‚Äôs case it‚Äôs definitely annoying bc even tho it‚Äôs only one player who‚Äôs a higher rank they can bait OP into chasing him and organize the rest of the team to crank out gens since OP (being rank 15 himself) is likely inexperienced enough to not know when to break chase and how to deal with swf.
---
Amen sister
---
All legion mains are taking notes
---
The event killed the waiting time for survivors.
---
So common add-ons are good too...
---
Camper
---
I see a rank 2 and three low rank presumably potato survivors.  This is about the softest looking swf you could get paired with.  Don't know what OP is so triggered about 
---
/r/Ihadastroke ? lol
---
I think Yoshi is too OP for this game.
---
Same here! XboxOne
---
I dont understand why everyone draws over their name, like what are you scared of? Freddy's revenge?
---
Oh nvm I'll take them all. Didn't know I gained bp from them
---
It's honestly cause you're with someone else, I get into games super fast by myself but as soon as I'm playing with friends who are the same rank we wait at least 10 mins guaranteed 
---
Look at the post again
---
Did you even pip?Feels like you are the one that lost here.
---
Ah, ooh-wee. F. Thankyou for letting me know lmao
---
He‚Äôs been doing this to any post that talks about PC lobby times all day. Probably thinks it is.
---
Yeah I find the same but haven‚Äôt played a game with the boys for like a good month and so it‚Äôs worth it I guess
---
What is this A CROSSOVER EPISODE?!?!
---
Lol it doesn‚Äôt stop people from doing it. 
---
You‚Äôve been hit by,  you‚Äôve been struck by, a smoooth criminal
---
yeah 95% of survivors are brain dead they just throw pallets down when a killer isn't going for them... or they just wait at a pallet and still fucking die cause they're dumb and expect the killer not to see you standing right next to a pallet.. why would you waste a bit of time mind-gaming a killer on a single pallet faking a few throw's so you can buy more time when you can just *THROW THE PALLET DOWN!*
---
I greatly prefer Empathy.  Map wide range is so dope.  Knowing where chases are post hit and by extension the killer at all times.  Watching how said survivor plays during chase while I'm repairing to determine if they are worth saving or if they're pallet wasting scrubs that need to be left on the hook.  Gen rushing by running to injured dudes gen same thing for heals on teammates.  It just provides so much useful information.  I love it 
---
Can confirm. Had Leatherface daily and it's silent for him too.
---
Sure, you earned them, but remember you aren‚Äôt playing a single player game. If the other side is facing something like that (practically a free win) I don‚Äôt blame them for disconnecting. Just think a little bit about the fact that you are facing real people, and they won‚Äôt want to face something so op like that. And why should they want to play that? There isn‚Äôt a purpose in playing something you know you won‚Äôt enjoy
---
So you better kill none or all. Cuz if you kill 2-3 you gotta do 60.
---
Geez I don‚Äôt even know how you understood what I meant with all those typos lol
---
I‚Äôve just been playing as killer. Honestly you get more coins that way instead of waiting and getting just a couple after an hour of waiting.
---
Platform: I play on PS4, but I'm assuming it is all of them.

Bug: Some hatches can't be opened with a key while playing on The Game.
---
Description: Was playing a game the other day and a hatch spawned with the opening facing the wall. Three of us tried to use a key to open it, but it wasn't letting us.
---
‚ÄúDecisive strike is overpowered it should be removed or reworked ASAP‚Äù *hides op add ons and pretends they don‚Äôt exist*
---
All those tiers would make for an extremely overpowered killer and extreme bugs the game could even explode. 
---
18 boldness points did you even hear a terror radius for more than a second?
---
People have literally been posting about the console lobby wait times every day for weeks, and the devs have acknowledged it. 
---
Fair enough, I was just burning time in class 
---
Why is it always a Myers?
---
As someone who is not in the best shape I will have to edit down the number of reps for each of these but will absolutely try this out inbetween the long wait time between games. Thanks!

What is SB and BL?

Dude, I was doing the same thing I'm doing now you idiot.

Not everyone scrolls Reddit all hours of the day seeing everything that gets posted. Reposts are going to happen and it's hardly about getting karma.

The Cow tree is my favorite loop! I‚Äôve had so many killers give up and go find someone else and I haven‚Äôt even thrown the pallet yet!

I agree, I'll be informing Humberside police immediately, they will check OP's thinking

It's 2019, we can't allow jokes anymore. Smh

Yeah 80 or less ping ain‚Äôt happening on console

Issues on PC now too. LOL
---
Can you blame them, though? 
---
How many times did you sandbag your teammates learning how to time this lol
---
Me and my buddy make facecamp endgame saves without borrowed time regularly.  Just takes coordination.  Approach from different angles first dude baits hit other swoops in for unhook that's injured state for both of us and saved survivor.  After that he has dead hard for second hit.  I also have dead hard for second hit.  Everyone runs out exit gate.  Obviously if it's a Leatherface just say no to attempting facecamp save.  Myers on edge if t3 is almost in that scenario too.  Most other killers can't defend against this though 
---
Literally just wasted your time. I definitely am not reading that.
---
Welcome to the team, bud! Next step is investing in her *seifuku* cosmetic items!

Bro there's no counterplay to that bp gain!

I think there was like leaked audio of him talking inappropriately to a young girl and you can really tell it's him tbh.

Don't feel entitled, I did not come up with this just for you :)
---
Just know that there are definitly ways of designing events where people are not motivated to be cunts. Don't say it's just the people. 
---
what?
---
You're cute
---
Quality OC right here
---
I guess the reward is bragging rights. I used to run no mither with dead hard so I can pretend I got hit when I use DH and have that two hit down feeling but DH isn't reliable and No Mither is an useless perk that is only useful against killers running blood hound. 
---
Lol up there with Leatherface my ass. Can wraith down both survivors in one hit? Wraith is only "good" because they don't know he's there otherwise he's complete trash because IT takes time to uncloak.
---
They are addons not perks you bring into every game
---
As much as I despise him, he's not bad at the game. He clearly knows his loops and is able to keep killers busy for a long time (even good killers). I give him credit where due he's just way too obnoxious about it and runs crutch and boring meta perk builds.
---
It doesn't matter if they want to play it, I've played 4 man sfw with flashlights on Comms i don't disconnect and neither should they. Its not my job to make the game fun for them
---
He means an event offering champ. Those points do show.
---
I like how you refer to Meg as ‚Äúa Meg Thomas‚Äù like she‚Äôs a species of animal or something
---
Imma check when i get home, hopefully it's working
---
It is likely old footage from before his ban.
---
I can see you aren't condoning or agreeing with the killer's words but what would be best for OP to do in this circumstance? Not talk at all in the end? He didn't say EZ or try to be rude to the killer. The killer's responsible for their own reaction. If a player chooses to play in a toxic way, I usually say nothing at the end cause I know they want a response to it. This exchange seemed to be genuinely friendly.
---
Dude just say "gg" then. How oblivious/tone deaf are you to not see that telling them "wp :)" when they played terribly sounds extremely condescending. Jesus.
---
Maybe your postgame chats wouldn't be so toxic if you tried *just a little* to not come across like you're mocking people.
---
Lithe, dance with me, urban evasion, and quick &amp; quiet. 
---
He does actually play killer he has quite a few videos where magically he isn't so toxic and gets annoyed at survivors. 
---
I don't feel entitled. Just don't feel like reading a wall of text. Your not special guy.
---
Another place to waste their time and to know where their going
---
Run a mori.Every goddamn killer has it at rank 1.
---
Lol I played billy and a baby Dwight ran up the ramp on the hay bailer that‚Äôs a dead end and got body locked in. I just shook my head and walked away
---
You can't be toxic when you're not good enough to be. 
---
Still, makes you wonder how he can be such a toxic ass and yet somehow feel like he deserves to complain as a killer
---
ZzZZ i play both at red rank and the only thing I dodge are lobbies with 300 Ping so.. nah dont have to. 
---
That's just... Rude and unnecessary. But you do you. People like that just have bad vibes.
---
Personally I play to have fun whilst ensuring I don't ruin the experience for others, but that's just because I'm REALLY empathetic. 
---
This is what it‚Äôd look like if Meg got the cosmetic instead of Feng
---
I swear with the start of this event I've gotten more:
---
* lobbies with bad pings
---
* Killers disconnecting right at the start of the match
---
* survivors disconnecting on their first down
---
This game has honestly become insufferable
---
survivors: lelelelel killers SUCK for dodging boosted SWF lobbies with full toolbox and flashlight load outs
---
also survivors: umm excuse me sweaty but actually it's fine for everyone to DC for having to play against stuff the devs put in the game
---
You'll run as fast as Kenyans!
---
And win a race against actual Kenyans!
---
Then be deported and sent back to Kenya!!!!!! 
---
And no one ever said they have to make the game fun for you. Those add ons literally give you a free 4 man for basically just existing. Something existing in a game doesn‚Äôt justify using it. You deserve 4 dc‚Äôs tbh. You shouldn‚Äôt be entitled to a win just for buying an add on with bloodpoints. How tf is that fair?
---
6 might be enough
---
I though there can't be worst killer than legion... Pls delete this if devs see that they will add him ;_;
---
Tbf the gaps where her eyes are are bigger than the holes in Frank's/Julie's mask
---
You mean one rank two and his 3 smurf friends.   This is nothing more than the standard matchmaking abuse because the system is too dumb to know better.
---
we literally do not care
---
I know that. I'm not gonna say "use google translate if it's western (roman/latin) characters". That's just excessive. They know what I mean.
---
&gt; then I saw the offering
---
So the build is ok?
---
Rank 1 killer you fucking zygote
---
Engage brain before typing next time you idiot
---
And who's tier list is this so
---
And no, they don't come off at the stations
---
I think applying after the game us a great idea it would be an alternative to randoms trying to farm me off the hook and reward players for doing the objectives.
---
Truue
---
I'm glad I could read your thoughts! Haha :p
---
Ikr? Double  BP was a godsend. 
---
What is the God pallet and how do I use it to escape the killer easier? 
---
dont get me wrong i don't actively try to be an asshole but if it is within my power to give myself another advantage over the opposition ill do it
---
Sure.
---
I hadn't even killed anyone yet? Its not a free 4 man you're really overselling how good the add ons are.
---
Love it, also my new wallpaper
---
Mines finally loaded! Thank you :)
---
ofc its leatherdaddy
---
I think that is to much. I thing giving you bonus BP in trial is better, I know survivors get a lot less BP than killers but still.
---
Yeah im just thinking like the devs, regardless the boxes are predetermined.
---
I think ultrawide doesn't charm DbD very well. Of course it can't widen your field of view what would be too much of a massive advantage.
---
still I'm tempted to buy an ultrawide monitor
---
There‚Äôs no way to know how someone is going to respond, in hindsight yah the best option would‚Äôve just been to not say anything in that case but the issue with gg is that if everyone had a good game then it‚Äôs fine but if the other team didn‚Äôt have a good game then it‚Äôs usually a taunt especially if you but the wp part. Most people forget in an asymmetrical game that everyone is their own person, so any experiences with past players in theory should not create prejudice toward each other, but as we all know this happens in and out of the game. Even OP has prejudice towards killers based on his title, so I don‚Äôt personally blame the killer for his reaction being hostile but I do agree that he definitely went way over the top.
---
Yeah mines finally loaded thanks for the help :)
---
Not to mention that you cant realistically get as much points on killer than survivor...
---
Only way to get close to is if most ppl bring offerings, and you go out of thee way to smash as many lanterns as possible, which may lead to less hooks and more chances for survivors to win...
---
Where Survivors just have to gen rush to get a guaranteed 20. Killers have to hook people 10 times to get an equal value (3 dead survivors and hooking the last at least once). If you can smash a couple lanterns during all that, sure, you get more.
---
It is however really unlikely to get 45 points, like survivors can get for just leaving with a lantern.
---
Smashing the max 7 lanterns = 21
---
Hooking every survivor 3 times = 24
---
If somehow everyone brings an offering and you can manage to get all 7 lanterns AND kill all 4 survivors with 3 hooks. I commend you, but its not equal compared to "just escape with a lantern"
---
It might explain why lobbies are very slow, people realise its much easier to get event points with survivor, considering the HUGE grind they pushed it out for.
---
Blight was fine for both sides but the first half required you to play both sides
---
I agree, I played it for one night and I no longer want to play the event willingly. I do think we're getting scammed on bloodpoints this time around, we earned more through special generators than we do holding onto a vessel. I also think the cosmetics look mediocre, I'm not a huge fan of them, even Ace looks meh to me.
---
Turn that frown upside down friend!
---
lol i have a friend who's new to the game so he doesn't look around while doing gens yet and silent wraith scared the shit out of him.  
---
sure let me quickly design the event: Increase the points for either hooks or vessels, heck why not both. 
---
Oh wow, surv Qs arent such aids anymore and you can actually play with killers that are in your region instead of waiting 5 mins to face a jupiter-gamer. 
---
I get your point, but I don‚Äôt care about it because you‚Äôre being an ass while at the same time pretending you‚Äôre some kind of oppressed person because you play on console. Stop posting this nonsense on every thread that mentions queue times on PC because it gets downvoted every time, yet you think you‚Äôre somehow in the right and that everyone‚Äôs dumber than you.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a good middle ground between every other killer and nurse because most people who play nurse have no interest in showing mercy lol
---
So boil over?Plus that dance with me effect which is totally useless if the killer has EYES.
---
Just do a slug build. Tilt them right back.
---
What are you talking about? I'm highlighting survivor hypocrisy 
---
Hence why it is super zoomed in and almost unplayable. I have 2 Alienware AW3418DW 3440x1440 monitors. I will never go back to 16:9. Out of all the games I own, this is the only one I gotta play in windowed mode at a different resolution. And even then, I still prefer it over 16:9 monitors.
---
Yeah, that's true, I'm trying to P3 them all right now but I play trapper and Billy a lot so I poor points into them when I run low on items.
---
good god you are a fucking piece of work
---
you fucking know perfectly well that's not a valid comparison. you bad faith pos
---
I run enduring normally.
---
I know its from the post Im not that stupid. Maybe stupid, but not *that* stupid lol.
---
because he touches children in the no no area.  
---
I always find that hard to manage 
---
Good to hear, I'd hate knowing that the box with your key isn't predetermined. Kind of ruins immersion. Yes the entity could move the key around, but it doesn't feel right
---
From what I know insta-heals and decisive strike is in the game.The killer cand dodge well so can survivors.
---
Yea exactly famous camper. Never said he was good at it just that a lot of low rank wraiths camp because he can stay cloaked next to the hook.
---
But you seemed so confused over why I wrote that, thought you didn‚Äôt realize :(
---
Boil over increases your wiggle meter speed and prevents the killer from seeing hooks. This is instead a tactic to delay the killer from getting to the hook by forcing them in a particular direction due to weight shifting. 
---
If you had eyes, you‚Äôd have read up on that yourself before commenting. 
---
Ah powerthirst, peak internet humour.
---
isn't that totally unironic? like as unironic as anything can be?
---
:(
---
exacty the point i've been trying to make
---
Yeah it's crazy the amount of BP you get from a single co-op gen, easy BP playing with 100% bonus.
---
How do you not understand? Do I need to spell it out for you? If you think that it's fine to dodge both, then this is not directed at you. But that's not the general feeling of the survivor community 
---
Also comms is not in the game, so nice try
---
It might not get 4k games but god damn of it doesn't piss survivors off. 
---
Boil over makes the killer harder to navigate.If you you would read perk descriptions.
---
It really doesn't help that so soon after his release was the winter event which gave everyone lots of rare add ons (like frank's mixtape.) So while everyone was just leveling him for his teachables, they all got these ultra rare add ons and moris and stuff. Bad time all around. 
---
Depends on why you play. For those people playing for rank (there aren‚Äôt many, but some do I‚Äôm sure), then earning a pip would be a win, regardless of kills/surviving. In my own mind, if at least 3 of my teammates get out, the survivors won. If only 1 gets out, survivors lost, and if 2 get out, it‚Äôs a draw. Just how I see it though.
---
Uh 90% of the top twitch Dbd streamers do
---
Id use it.
---
Not only that, but he broke Quentin's face, just look at that boy in game! What a jerk!
---
Boil over doesn't increase the wiggle meter speed, it increases the effect of wiggling, so the killer strives more to the left or right
---
Everyone knows you should only get your opinions and arguments from Twitter and Twitch,  those are the real enlightened sources of information.
---
Megamus Thomasus is her scientific name.
---
get a job idiot, said by the person with ttv in their reddit username
---
Except some maps have absolutely no crows so it's bad
---
Why‚Äòs that such a good counter against Hillbilly in particular?
---
Yeah, the killer was definitely terrible as long as the other survivors
---
*Listen here you little shit*
---
I do wish I got some kind of 'no one would've survived if you didn't make the sacrifice' bonus but obviously impossible to implement that accurately. Thankless job sometimes but I feel more flattered now 
---
Lol I play killer for two reasons:
---
1. Sweet sweet revenge.
---
2. Helping people out during events.
---
Also those hatchets are hard af to get down. I'm so jealous of people who are good at the huntress.
---
Thanks for the info. I came from Hybridpanda's video mentioning it and had no idea what the guy did, although I have heard his name before. Sounds like someone who should be banned for sure.
---
I think it's just inevitable that someone will have a problem with it though, so I can understand both sides. Guess just keep doing what you enjoy.
---
I get it.
---
Not gay enough, NEXT!
---
I love the obliviousness I have when updates come out. 
---
I'm all "yes, they fixed this bug" or "awesome, they fix this mechanic in the game". When in reality, I need to start saying "great, another update where they fixed some issues. Wonder what new issues popped up as a consequence". 
---
üôÇ
---
If you're running pretty much *any* tracking perk on the Doctor than you don't know what you're doing. Whispers is actively useless on him and Tinkerer is can even be self damaging considering the fact that the Doctor's natural tracking ability comes from his terror radius.
---
I prefer having 4 perks instead of 3 tbh
---
Write that down, WRITE THAT DOWN
---
Does it even work on lanterns?
---
Yeah, maybe increase points for hooks or give that +25 point bonus survivors can get for a 4k. 
---
When Momma nevers buys her kid them orthapedic shoes.
---
I wouldnt say that its every non mindgameable window. Id say that the cow loop you could still get downed, if the killer has bloodlust 3. Cow loops a safe pallet, but I wouldnt call it a good pallet.
---
Id reserve it for super safe pallets that the killer will have to break, even if theyre on bloodlust 5.
---
I'd love a rich status effect...sniff
---
Wait there are pc people who frfr haven‚Äôt just gotten them with shards?
---
No, if they played as badly as you said then telling them "wp :)" sounds like you're mocking them. Why say "well played" when they obviously played terribly? That's literally the textbook definition of being patronizing lmao. Just say gg and move on. 
---
guys guys get ready for my epic joke....if you play on *insert platform I myself do not game on* you are.... pffft....BAD!!! üòÇüòÇ top tier comedy everyone. PC master race rise up!!!
---
Step One: Bring back single use borrowed time that effects both survivors.
---
Note: I play on both sides. If someone is camping, borrowed time should have a two-sided effect, not singular because then it screws the other guy.
---
So you wanna tell me killers swing and step over window with same input?
---
F I N G E R G U N S was my username for a while but I started maining David and it didn't match so I changed it to BEEFY BOI.
---
(He is still not beefy enough, you know he would have more fat on him from drinking so much and be hairier (just look at that full ass beard!), I'M GOING TO KEEP RIOTING UNTIL I GET MUSCLE BEAR DAVID)
---
The t-bagging exercise is pretty fitting. üòÇ
---
Personally I'm not a huge fan of either, but I find Spies to be incredibly inconsistent. I've had games where it went off maybe once or twice if at all. Crows just aren't plentiful enough to justify it. I'm not a huge fan of whispers either though, I'd rather just have something like Nurse's Calling, Surveillance, or Discordance in that slot.
---
Cow tree is real dumb. It's not mindgameable, you have to run it a certain direction to stop the fast vault which means you can't decide which side to push the survivor towards, it's almost always right next to another loop and pallet that's also not mindgameable because this is Coldwind and all the tiles are goddamn transparent. I'll chase any survivor anywhere for a little bit just to see if they're stupid, and thankfully they often are. But if it turns out they're not stupid you probably will get your next hit faster blindly wandering the fucking corn than you will by chasing them around a position as strong as cowtree.
---
Bad killer has to hook survivors to win!
---
wow &lt;3 That's lovely!
---
Unbreakable is so situational but so fun when you pull it off 
---
I was abou to say 'It's usually the other way around' when the hatched went straight through you, but then the other one missed the mark completely, and still hit. You got both the bullshit hatchets in a single clip
---
Now why can't my teammates ever help me like this? If this were any group i've ever solo-queued into Laurie would have either left or gone for the totem rather than even try to take the hit for me.
---
THWAP THWAP THWAP (evil chuckle) THWAP!
---
They watched other killers dribble, and thought you could do it indefinitely, probably. They're not aware that the struggle bar fills by like 20% each drop
---
you dont lose pips

Bug: Legion's Feral Frenzy heart beat sound after striking someone doesn't happen after hitting a second person.  
---
Description: Basically whenever I strike someone with Feral Frenzy I'm supposed to get a heart beat as an auditory indicator of nearby survivors. Sometimes whenever I hit two people with Feral Frenzy the heart beat just vanishes, leaving only the visual indicator of the pulse leading me to the 3rd person. This can lead me to realise too late someone was nearby and miss an opportunity to reset Feral Frenzy's duration.  
---
Steps to reproduce: Simply use Feral Frenzy and hit two people in a row.  
---
Expected Result: Heart beat should be going off when an unstruck survivor is nearby WITH the visual red pulse.  
---
Actual result: No heart beat sound, just red pulse.  
---
Reproduction rate: It happens almost every time.

I think one in like 50 survivors on my end save it, rather than use it, and as soon as they don't struggle on the second down, I know for a fact they saved it. Then again, 9/10 times I eat it right away if I don't dribble anyways, so there's no reason to second guess
---
Depends on the builds. And if survivors are playing with friends. Could be either side.
---
Mood as fuck. 
---
I've lost 3 gens due to a single D-strike(Three people on gens, having to continue chase, applying no pressure, not forcing them off gens to unhook). Sometimes you're just unlucky and d-strike them too close to a pallet or jungle gym, and even enduring's not enough. Other times, it's a swift down
---
Thank You !
---
Very cool! Thank you for sharing!!
---
Ironic that you couldn't find/see anything about it
---
Scarlett Johansson playing Feng Min 
---
Would be a nice nerf if D-strike could only be used when hooked at least once. That way, it can't do a lot of early game damage, which is usually when it's most crucial to apply pressure(No survivors injured, being chased, and with d-strike in play, no reason to get off generators)
---
You‚Äôre being very technical. They all meant that you can‚Äôt see survivor auras with BBQ if their aura is completely behind the aura of a generator. End of story. 
---
To be honest, the data is extremely questionable. First, they've got 500 data points from, supposedly, 50 games. That's 10 traps per game, not possible. Now, there's a comment they made where they say they meant 100, but even that is unreasonable. 
---
To get an accurate data set they would have to apply 1 trap at a time. If, at any time, multiple traps were in use at once it would be impossible to know who triggered the Billy laugh, so it would be impossible to know how many attempts an individual made. So 1 trap at a time, no new traps until one is removed, and still managing 5 traps per match every match? Unlikely. 
---
Some people will spam space to get it out of the way and then wiggle nearly instantly. However, recovery time for a wiggle is considerably less than a d-strike stun, so I always dribble 4 times if I have to. I'd have to eat the d-strike regardless, may as well make it less harmful
---
Np my man
---
What do I switch?I have nothing on my ace.
---
Im solo.Swf takes half an hour to find a game anyways.
---
You have four. It's just that the fourth drop puts you at like 95% wiggle, so they could theoretically just spam space to get rid of the bar and then wiggle out. It's just that the fourth dribble usually puts you right below the bar so they don't get the time to. That, and people just don't even try at that point
---
I've been contemplating doing a Basement Hag day sometime... could be fun ;P
---
Yeah, I noticed it in the first game. Really annoying. Did 1 gen with 2 other people, then maxed on the next gen with 1 other person after touching it for 5 seconds.
---
100% should be post match bonus. 
---
Self care with aftercare? Trade with self care. 
---
I concur with this statement.
---
wow dude you're so cool downranking to bully new players then taunt them at the gates and never leave
---
Welcome to NYC
---
I‚Äôm so cool man :D
---
My Dwight build always uses Bond with Leader, so I can see my teammates and run to them for healing (on top of seeing them for generators and running from the killer). So I would drop Self-Care, but Bond would require you to take another off. I use Spine Chill and Deliverance for fun (killers usually don't see that coming) or Sprint Burst.
---
Yeah, it's way too predictable on Wraith.
---
Even if it wasn't it only really helps if I lose and that feels too defeatist to me; if I run NOED it's 'cuz I'm running a late game build or I'm doing a 3 gen strat Doc and I want to feel very evil.
---
**YOU NEED TO HAVE SOME GODDAMN FAITH!**

What was your ping?

Thank you! Despite all the negativity it's a fun game when you make it.

Pretty good job so far.
---

30 mins queues :/
---
+++++feeling those positive vibes+++++
---
You have to burn the event offering in order to get points though that isn‚Äôt made clear as far as I can tell. Thought my game was bugged for awhile.
---
1000 for obtaining a lamp
---
500 every minute or so for holding it
---
5000 for escaping with the lamp
---
Lol yep I would of been cussing probably. They just annoy me more then ds because at least with ds you're still hurt so I just gotta catch up but those perks it's a brand new chase now. Noed helps with that tho lol so that's another reason you see it alot
---
It is possible if you have all the good perks. If you want to play, say trapper but he is level 5 and you are rank 1 there is no way close to get even a 3k
---
Console gets them free, but we also don‚Äôt get Bill :(
---
Imo there should be backpack which allow you to carry 2 items
---
If I absolutely destroy the other side (get a 4K, or everyone escapes), then I do not type ‚Äògg‚Äô first. I feel like it‚Äôs rubbing salt in the wound, that I‚Äôm trying to goad them into blowing up. 
---
If the losing side offers a ‚Äògg‚Äô, then I will as well. If the match isn‚Äôt totally one sided, then I will offer one every time unless some toxic shit happened in-game. I just leave the after-game lobby in those situation. 
---
Imagine thinking pig is bad
---
Imagine thinking rank 1 is no different than say rank 10
---
Freddy: "Is this what... w-w-*winning* feels like?"
---
That's what im saying
---
I suppose so lol
---
OR NOTHING
---
Are you giving am event offering? That's the only time they give you points.
---
I‚Äôm just joking, showing how we both posted similarly around the same time
---
I think to be more fair, IF they are running franklins, you‚Äôll drop the item in your hand, but the one in your bag stays safe. 
---
I feel like they‚Äôve been using the past few events to find ways to slow down the game without actually telling us this is what they‚Äôre doing and using the ‚Äúevent‚Äù as a cover 
---
This event is a fucking joke.  I dont even get normal ping killers right now, just all red bullshit.
---
Similar you an oud, it‚Äôs called the pipa. Oud is middle eastern I believe where as a pipa has Asian origin. I picked one up a couple years back but I haven‚Äôt played it in a while 
---
That's the 3 man lobby bug. Been in the game for a very long time. 
---
Sounds good 
---
I use Leader, Balanced landing, We'll make it and a perk that I switch out pretty often, leader to help them heal me faster, we'll make it to heal them faster.
---
I think that the music was both a bad choice and a bit too loud. 
---
There were a bit too many bland parts in the content, but there were some pretty cool hatchet throws. 
---
I‚Äôd give it a 6,7/10. 
---
Way easier to get coins as a survivor and they got more cosmetics.
---
How you looked at the current event? You get rewarded more for playing survivor well then you do killer
---
Okay.
---
Dude, I found a key! Put it in your bag!
---
Still better tactic than camping 
---
You know this is because too much players are on survivors side... right ?
---
He only has one glove dev‚Äôs give him another glove 
---
Not true, smiles have been mocking for a long time all over the internet!
---
They think he‚Äôs bad because he‚Äôs fucking terrible.
---
I dunno, I don't think it's that big a gap as people think since survivors can only get one lantern potentially and killers can destroy multiple ones throughout the match
---
fair point on cosmetic, though 
---
They have to animate exactly like this did though
---
I don't think it's that big a gap as people think since survivors can only get one lantern potentially and killers can destroy multiple ones throughout the match
---
And whose fault is that? Perhaps the Devs for making the event lean heavily to the survivor side?
---
Passed event 
---
You sure its not on your part? I rarely get into red lobbies.
---
XD America, fuck yeah.
---
NO STUP MY PUPILS!!!
---
Every other killer has an ability that helps them to chase down survivors in *some* way.
---
The trapper can trap people and deny certain loops with smart trap placement, the Wraith can go invisible during a chase to get the bonus movement speed and to get rid of his terror radius, the Hillbilly can sprint people down and bait out and destroy pallets near instantly, the Nurse can blink, the Huntress can hit you from a distance, Myers can instadown and gains bonus lunge distance from ew3, as well as having a small terror radius, the Hag can tp, Leatherface can instadown people and  bait out and destroy pallets near instantly, the Doctor can shock people to deny pallets and window vaults, the Pig can ambush out of certain loops, the Clown can slow, the Spirit can bait or chase people down, the Legion can just run at you, Freddy can debuff your repair speed. 
---
This is his problem. 
---
His ability is the only one in the game that doesn't assist in *some* way in him chasing people down. It doesn't matter how slow your repair speed is, if it takes him several minutes to down a single person, he's just going to get gen rushed and the game will be over before he has the chance to do anything.
---
He isn‚Äôt almost universally hated. He IS universally hated. 
---
Calm your tits
---
I should be both ways prior to the gates being opened then shift to one side when the gates are open then?
---
While there are more lanterns to destroy, they can only be destroyed after a short time after hooking a survivor and they grant way lest points.
---
Because you lost the argument, was proven wrong and was exposed as being a rank 14 survivor. Triple yikes dude.
---

They grant less points because the killer has the capability to destroy more lanterns than a survivor does to acquire. But now that you mention it you're right that the amount of time to destroy a lantern is too short.

Is this... ‚Äúwhite washing?‚Äù

Right, i forgot about that you are correct. No i didnt in the latest games.
---
Yep but I‚Äôm having legion flashbacks of people abusing mechanics. Like this guy could just follow you to prevent you from disinfecting, or what if you‚Äôre the last person at a hatch standoff and you get mori‚Äôd because enough time had passed? I like the concept though, it could be good with some changes but I‚Äôm nowhere near creative enough to suggest any so I‚Äôm impressed that you came up with all that :D 
---
I feel like Killer with good addons is more consistent than survivor now, especially playing solo, considering they hotfixed other survivors escaping with the lantern giving you points.
---
o shit i hope not;; i tried to get her as close to her model skin colour as i could
---
IMO, a big part of goofball stuff like that is just the fun of it, even if it goes "wrong" - like if your name is Stay Out Of The Basement and everyone stays out of the basement, just stay in character and praise them for it postgame! ;D BUT also if you think it would feel like a waste or would be un-fun to do a basement thing and NOT have anyone come down, then I think you just shouldn't do it. There's no shame in just not wanting to do somethin! :) 
---
I enjoy playing just for the sake of goofing around sometimes, so the silly playful stuff, for me, can be just as fun as the serious stuff even if I don't succeed in the usual sense. It's all about your preferences and your mindset!
---
moonwalk?
---
Nobody is at fault, the quickest available killer is usually much farther away or outside your normal matchmaking region so the ping will be worse. It‚Äôs once again a product of too few killers due to the event
---
TO THE PLAAAAACE I BELOOONG!!!! ROTTEN CORNFIELDS!!!! HUNTRESS MAMMA!!!

Don't know you could be, but you do you. I'd like to play the game. 
---
Kenya means trash in old languages you guys are ignorant &gt;:((((((((
---
But it's insanely easy to lose that 25. On average killers 100 percent get out with more even if the cap is higher for survivors 
---
So they‚Äôre technically still in chase with you, but they walk backwards so you can‚Äôt see the red stain, which counts as ‚Äònot being in chase‚Äô so your timer goes down. 
---
TIL you somehow can't play the game because muh Legion

The one subreddit I expected to have a boner for Jontron actually brings up his bullshit. Nice.

I did actually if you can read my first 2 comments. No reading skills either, u just got promoted: from triple yikes to quadra yikes.

---
Sorry, I play PC and usually red ranks. 
---
I've not bought a single character other than Spirit, mainly because I don't play killer often yet wanted a fun but competitive killer when I felt like it. No point buying survivors unless they release perks that aren't trash, and even then there's the Shrine.
---
I‚Äôm only kidding lol
---
Ok so you break line of sight to mend, they find you again. And I‚Äôm not talking about garbage killers. I‚Äôm talking about actual good killers. Breaking line of sight doesnt work all the time.
---
And bringing a mori isn‚Äôt being a try hard?
---
Repost.
---
No killers playing &gt; game trying to pick up at least any killer &gt; high ping and big rank diff.  
---
as is tunneling camping, rancor and dying light with no obsession perk, etc., which are more frequent and far stronger than the odd person with ds
---
I like how they added a couple of killers with powers meant to discourage tunneling and one of them is only usable if you tunnel.
---
I don‚Äôt have BBQ in fact I have just found my killer main. 
---
Is it worth just getting leather face to power him up to whatever level you get BBQ at then teach it. Or just wait for it in the Shrine?
---
Just figured I‚Äôd ask since you have it. 
---
dishonor on you
---
dishonor on your whole family

dishonor on your cow (dwight)

Uh, yeah? What game is left when you remove chases and stealth?

Reddit has a tendency to bring up everything involving Jontron all the time no matter what when everybody else has moved on

You have enough time to get somewhere safe to mend lol

Dude I don't know what Legions you're playing against, but they are wildly different to the ones I've been seeing.

r/lostredditors

These are the most satisfying saves in the entire game. I don't blame the killer for trying to secure a kill, but you bet my ass I'm going to at least try to get the save.

Oof, he doesnt need to know that though.

**Backstory:**  Was chased for about 10\~15mins in this round.   Leading up  to the hatch, I was chased for 5mins, just trying to find it.  It was  the first win in 4hrs, and the game didn't reward me anything because of the BSOD.  It was quite humorus, for me.

(Muted the BSOD scene because it caused a lot of machine sound loop feedback.)

If only lol. It already takes multiple hundreds of hours to get even 1 survivor and killer to p3. If you don't prestige ever, your time would be cut down, but you'd still only have your one killer and survivor with a few select perks. God forbid you actually want all teachables unlocked, and like the guy said above me, you have to keep pumping BP into your webs just to get addons/offerings/items
---
Yea remember the devs were gonna give legion Kenyan speed in the new patch. 
---
Pallets once had vacuums too.  And yeah they were extremely annoying to deal with as killer.  But the hook vacuums are still in place.  I just wish survivors can have a chance to wiggle out or decisive until the game officially hooks them.  There have been so many moments where I came so close to wiggling out but it failed because the prompt disappeared due to the vacuum.
---
Except that's not true only 1 survivor needs to escape with the lantern if then everyone else dies or escapes afterwards you still get the 45
---
This.
---
Yeah, it takes about 40-50 thousand bloodpoints just for one Red Envelope. It was the same problem last year. I'm not sure how the summer BBQ event was, but the Hallowed Blight actually gave you multiple offerings per bloodweb. I'll take extra offerings over ridiculously pricey ones anyday. 
---
Depends, I'm rank 5 on survivor and some of my teammates still quit, but it depends I guess of the map, killer, perks used.
---
On killer I'm 10 (actual 10 skill level), started few days ago and is brutal sometimes, I play with really good survivors that deranked (they were definitely below rank 5) and they totally screw me over. Still, I got only 2 DCs and I play Legion (probably cause I play it normal, no moonwalking or other shit, I'm not even using Frenzy, only to travel faster between gens).

The system is broken, you shouldn‚Äôt have to spend 60k on a Bloodweb just to get an event offering because you‚Äôre maxed on a survivor/killer. It‚Äôs even more painful if you have all the perks unlocked.

As always AnklePickBro you step in with some shit super biased opinion. Here I am saying both survivors and killers post dumb shit then here comes you (per usual) to push open the doors and say: "wah look at the dumb survivors. I play survivor and I never see these problems. Must be bc I am so good". Then you go to pull clips from everyone's comments then present some argument that is just your opinion and not anything that furthers the discussion. Then when someone presents something you cant argue it just turns into "wah survivor blah blah".
---
I get it that you play killer (exclusively) and are very prideful of it. But dude I have never seen one productive comment from anything you have ever submitted to this sub. All of it is just talking shit to people and attacking them. Maybe step back and try to have a good mix of constructive comments and shit talking. Not just one.

Sure but lots of times Reddit will outright lie about some of things he says and they throw a lot of personal opinion in to really kay an extra lair on him to make him seem bad. I think what he said was dumb, I think he said some things he didn‚Äôt mean during a heated debate he was NOT prepared for, and he fell for some fake statistics. With all that being said it‚Äôs pretty easy to see he isn‚Äôt racist. That‚Äôs just silly.

I don't know, on PS4 I hope to play against a Legion, I find it entertaining, though I might be in minority here.
---
For me, it doesn't seem to be easy to play it, I find it very weak compared to other killers, but that might be cause I don't use his power and just run around trying to hit the survivors.
---
Same on PS4
---
Matchmaking was fine but killers were going super hard across the board with moris and such. I was escaping maybe 1/4 games.  
---
this sub's weird hateboner for him and true are getting old.
---
Oh, yeah.  I had about five games, that day, which ate my offering and the killer disconnected.  I was stuck at the loading screen for about 5\~15mins, each time, before it said that the killer disconnected.
---
Two other games, there were 3p disconnects and the killer felt bad for me, and let me farm.  It almost helped make up for all the bad lobbies I had.  Haha
---
Another lobby that took five minutes to load, I ended up with a two-man game.  It was weird.  The killer was still toxic and savage af.
---
I mean he still said them and continues to like/retweet racist alt/right figures l. Moreover, I‚Äôve never heard him actually apologize or really confront the idea he might be wrong or might have been racist, only that he expressed himself the wrong way. I don‚Äôt care how he expressed it, the sentiment itself needs to be examined and confronted.
---
I mentioned him as a walking locator in the means of fun, not in the means of practical use. Even so practical use is undeniable.
---
Strong with language you are 
---
I main him. He's viable at red ranks. Too many try to play him like every other killer. You hit the nail on the head. Sleep, hit, and break off a chase if you know you can sleep and down another. Then go sneak up on the injured survivor who is probably being woken up by a teammate at that point. Discordance is S-tier on him. People get so caught up in the whole "7 second permission window" thing, but those aren't hits you would otherwise get on other killers. Freddy can slow the game down to an absurd degree and slowly snowball things.

All I know is people like to say ‚Äúwell essentially he said this‚Äù while not being anywhere near what he actually said, people (especially here on Reddit) fetishize some of the stuff he says and put ot on a pedastal while it plays out like a game of telephone. Also, though this is my personal opinion, what he likes/retweets matters more than who he is liking and retweeting.

I didn't mean it to sound like they were greedy, I thought the cosmetics could be easier as a better way to incentivize getting people to buy Ace and Feng. If it's structured too strenuously then people will probably just say forget about it or one day regret all that effort they put in.

Even without Prove Thyself, with three people on a generator each under the effect of two Leaders, a generator gets done in 22.2 seconds.

Great teamwork!

"Bad" as in "weakest of all killers". As in comparing atom bomb to conventional artillery shell. Both are quite deadly but one is whole lot more powerful. Freddy is not entirely toothless, unironically, but it's pretty much as close as you can get to "impossible difficulty" as killer in this game. You don't exactly have time to "play with your food" unless survivors screw up royally. No other killer has to waste 7 seconds to actually be able to damage someone, let alone let survivor escape if they fail a skillcheck. I imagine that must be one of the most aggravating things as Freddy player, along with saving someone from hook right in your face. Definitely loses any "exit gates are open" end game tomfoolery. Before exit gates, imagine two survivors running from generator through you. You can only choose one of them to hit and chase. Any other killer can choose to hit one and chase the other, wasting survivor time and prolonging the game.

Can you make one with Huntress, Hag, and Spirit silhouettes!?

I used to watch him pretty much exclusively on youtube. Saw him streaming on twitch at some point, and was met with that wall of text. It might sound petty, but a bad taste rarely leaves your mouth easily

According to survivor mains Billy is not supposed to hit survivors under any circumstance.

I mean I understand killers do what they have to, to get their kills. When I play killer, I generally try not to go for the person sandbagged. Because if I‚Äôm on the hook, I can‚Äôt do anything when someone decides to instantly unhook me in front of the killer. But again, I don‚Äôt exactly care about kills very much.

I've played survivor solo pretty much exclusively since about 100 hours in because my friend stopped playing. My soul is dying at this point

Can somebody create a thread filled with just gameplay recordings like this??

I play killer only occasionally so I'm at rank 13 on ps4. I haven't come across too many rage quitters so far. If they do rage quit its swf and the whole team will dc. Survivor I get to red ranks every season and from my experience green/purple ranks are the worse for rage quitters.
