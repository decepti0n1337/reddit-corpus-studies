Not colorblind but I can imagine how annoying it is for colorblind killers and colorblind survivors to find anything.

Hm. See I rarely ever feel like I‚Äôm short on traps, but a swf group calling out where my traps are and disarming them while I chase the only one who saw me put it down without a downside is just a dickslap
---
If by "you were terrible" you mean like 99% of the community, then I agree with you. We didn't know how to play with him, because he wasn't bad, he was horrible, he was the worst thing to play. Even No Mither + Self-Care had a better chance to have fun / win that a old freddy.
---
A killer can't be good if he doesn't have chase power.  For some reason he got reworked and now he is popular for being very good and not like before when he was popular for being the worst killer. I don't know why some people can still say that a killer that has to wait SEVEN seconds (by default) to even have a chance to hit a survivor wasn't terrible.

You can hear the rain in the red forest maps tho
---
The common argument against this is that people who are not colorblind will use the settings to make areas and scratch marks more visible to them. I don't see any merit in that except in extremely limited circumstances which shouldn't be enough to justify not having the option
---
You dont even need dlc characters for a good build though. SC, BL, Adrenaline, and whatever else you want is good enough, though I'll use iron will instead of SC and then something like BT or some other team based perk.

Thank you a second time lol

I‚Äôm on PS4. Today is the first time I‚Äôve played since the DLC update. It takes forever for me to get into a game. Sometimes and tells me ‚Äúan error has occurred‚Äù and that‚Äôs it until it spends me back to the main screen.

---
The matchmaking is absolutely ridiculous. I just loaded into a game as a survivor (rank 13) with an 11, 4 and 8. I had to leave bc the ping for that game was well over 700 and homie don‚Äôt got time for that bullshit.  But matchmaking has been hell lately, but at least I can see what rank my teammates are to see if they‚Äôre worthy or not.

Object of Obsession
---
As long as we can agree he needs the quantity of traps buffed I‚Äôm happy to leave it at that and we‚Äôll agree to disagree on the amount :)
---
Object of Obsession, when you look at the killer, you can see their aura and they can see yours. It only works outside the terror radius and upto a certain range. 
---
When you are in the dream, you are oblivious so there is no terror radius
---
Gotta do what you gotta do lol.

Sorry did not see the exhaustion part and I guess some other perks could go against it.thank you for the insight

This is an ironic image

Fair enough, good luck in your future matches, random Reddit guy

If they are running OoO, they probably don't like freddy. So its either more of an incentive to kill them, or more of an incentive to pull the plug :)

"This one is a little bit of an oversight. The game takes your rank from after the match, not the start. In addition, these stats were collected from April 1st to April 7th. This was when it was significantly harder for survivors to pip. So what ended up happening was that most of the survivors that died would derank and count as a rank 2 death, whereas those who survived would remain at rank 1 and count as an escape. It was very rare to die at rank 1 and not derank at that time.
---
In short, it's actually much closer to 43% if you took the stats from a week later.
---
EDIT: Typo."
---
This is from the community manager Peanits in direct response to someone asking him to explain the 80% survival rate at rank 1.
---
But by all means continue to be in denial. Its very clear that posts saying its ridiculously survivor sided are wrong. And im not saying its killer sided either. I just think its more balanced than people will admit because they need something else to blame or they think a 3 or 4k is the only thing thats a win.
---
Yeah, they asked what is ooo so I gave them the answer

FFS guys take two minutes to scroll down and see the eighty billion other matchmaking posts. It is bugged.
---
You should switch wolf for a bear or something, with the upside being all survivors are exposed, however they can see your aura outside 35 meters and expanded terror + red stain
---
The game is survivor sided but the killer is able to ruin the game for at least 1 player if he tunnels and there's nothing the survivor can do about it.
---
The killer should only lose if the survivors are overly altruistic.
---
Depends what you consider 'winning' or 'losing' of course, as a killer I try to maximise points I don't worry about killing 4 players. As a survivor I just try to escape but I'll still try to save people on the way out.

Feels bad man. Although I feel this killer failed at map pressure this game if all 4 of these gens were this far done. That's the worst for me as killer, knowing when I make a mistake or a lot of mistakes and seeing the results. Like man I should've waited a little longer and I would've hit through that dead hard earlier preventing 1 of the 4 that just popped and 2 left is better than 1 left. Really feels bad. But bravo from the survivor side.

They should just remove her collision, take away her ability to see scratch marks (Legion can‚Äôt either, help him) and remove Anal Beads.
---
I tested this with a friend and gen tapping is way slower than even failing every ruin skill check unless you're extremely unlucky and get like 14 skillchecks. The average amount of skill checks per gen is 6 I believe.
---
In your eyes
---
Mistake buying them with Cells, it‚Äôs so much cheaper to buy the dlc.
---
I think it'll be hard for them. This is basically how the state of SWF matches prior to this update. Lots of flactuations between ranks are allowed for the sake of SWF and then they pick the lowest ranked survivor within that and find the same killer level.
---
My guess is that they just copy and paste SWF lobby to replace the normal survivor lobby, which usually tries to match all survivors of same rank. So now we got the mess that we are in now.
---
damn I thought Claudette was getting exposed for being in nine Trey too.

As a Freddy main, I think one of the most underrated reasons for waking up is that when you‚Äôre asleep you hear his lullaby instead of a terror radius. It sounds like a minor thing, but a good Freddy who knows how to abuse it will be able to make so many plays because of it. One of my favorite things to do with Freddy if I‚Äôm chasing a sleeping survivor is to break line of sight, teleport to a gen nearby where the survivor was running to, and surprise them with a hit. 90% of the time the survivor is still looking behind them trying to find me as I hit them. (Also like someone mentioned terror radius dependent perks such as borrowed time won‚Äôt work if you‚Äôre asleep. so if you‚Äôre running perks that depend on being in the terror radius you‚Äôll want to be awake as much as possible)
---
Other than that, his gen teleport is reduced by 15% for each sleeping survivor. He also has an add on that increases this even further. His gen teleport can cooldown extremely fast if everyone is asleep and he‚Äôs running certain add ons.  He also has add ons that slow down action speed in the dream world, as a memento to his old kit. 
---
Honestly, against a bad/mediocre Freddy you probably don‚Äôt need to go out of your way to wake up. If a clock or teammate is nearby cool but no reason to run across the whole map to wake up. Against really good Freddy‚Äôs who know how to toy with sleeping survivors, you‚Äôll definitely want to avoid being asleep. Not saying you have to leave a gen so that you can cross the entire map for a clock, but it‚Äôs definitely not something you should completely ignore either.
---
Lag switching is a strategy
---
Just because a game is asymmetrical doesn't mean that one side needs to be more powerful than the other. The goal should be giving both sides a fighting chance at accomplishing their objective.
---
There's a hole to drop down next to it that should be close to several hooks.
---
Been playing a lot of Meyers lately and have been quite surprised by how common this is (even from &gt;10 rank survivors).
---
Really nice and simplistic but fucking sexy. I like the look. Would you be doing the same for add ons, offerings, items?
---
they are nubs
---
What dlc were these reviews for?
---
Hitting a great skill check doesn't make you repair faster with ruin, it just prevents it regressing.
---
Just like balance.
---
Protip: charge into one of those lockers and walk away and watch the killer waste a lot of time checking each one.

Yeah the matchmaking is fucked. I'm killer rank 16 and had a game with 2 19s and 2 purple ranks. I was like "wtf"

What's worse is a baby killer who camps and tunnels, making the first one hooked guaranteed to lose a pip. People shouldn't lose pips/levels because of crap play from others. I main killer and so much despise that type of game.

I agree with you but I saw so many complaints I just put out an idea
---
haha...
---
I only get people that leave you on hook till second phase, then farm you and back to the lobby, friends. You better not get caught before doing something in the match or pretty much GG.
---
I mean, that's a good justification for why the exit gates open and everything, but in terms of gameplay it's kind of ridiculous to be punished for doing well, especially when it's one-sided.
---
If you like the look of bloody faces, then sure? I like the blood splatter for Steve.
---
Asymmetric means both sides aren't composed of the same component, unlike say a MOBA. It should still be balanced despite being composed of different components, which is obviously harder than balancing symmetric gameplay.
---
Speak for yourself, I absolutely loved filling the vials last year

He's my fav of all time but he's just not right for the game.  If you made him work for the game then he doesn't work for who he is.

(Go ahead and downvote, it was worth it)

It‚Äôs really about hope. You get rewarded for a longer game because of how long you‚Äôre doing. It‚Äôs not about just sacrificing, it‚Äôs about letting them try to leave. That‚Äôs why you get rewarded for PWYF
---
Killers don‚Äôt see the red stain, if that‚Äôs what you mean.
---
But they are like really unsafe, if your even decent at mindgames you can get the survivor always.
---
One dev plays with a fucking controller on pc
---
Had a similar experience, and of course, one of them messaged me with a solid, "gg ez lol"
---
Yeah, but in game it makes no sense to punish the killer for doing well by keeping them in the same ranks as the survivors they keep bodying.
---
Look guy, when you pull some proof out of your ass that actually proves that survivors don't escape, I'll admit I'm wrong. But the stats collected then were inaccurate because they took in a bunch of useless information such as console stats, low rank stats or by including disconnects that makes the data worthless. And they're outdated stats anyway. You shouldn't be swearing by shitty data that tells you that survivors don't escape. That should raise red flags for you reading it. 
---
And, the fact that you don't believe that survivors are blatantly overpowered is, again, on you. Either that or you play at below green ranks. Because as it stands currently, gens go too quickly, DS lasts too long to be a strict "anti-tunnel" perk, and there are barely 4 killers that have red rank viability to actually threaten survivors. And that's without survivors bringing in items.
---
The game has definitely gone a long way towards becoming more balanced, but until you start playing survivors that actually try to win with a killer not in the top 5, you can't say you know much about actual balance in this game.
---
Nancy has e v o l v e d.
---
Ikr. I just got a game where I was hooked and this Meg was tbagging me on the hook and pointing at me... she waited Trapper to come and didn't save me. Almost 1 minute on this and I died. Fortunately I messaged the killer to kill Meg and be toxic with her. He killed her and kept hitting her on the hook. Thanks Trapper &lt;3
---
Quit flexing
---
Ugh that‚Äôs annoying. Fortunately the higher ranks I‚Äôve been matched with have always been nice and understanding. There‚Äôs always a rotten egg :/
---
All green ranks are usually braindead and even on purple/red ranks you can get braindead teammates, its unplayable without swf
---
Anything is possible in The Entity's realm
---
This would be good, as many players are trying to avoid red ranks with how bad it is apparently.
---
Which is why we F13 folks should let it go.  He doesn't fit the chase and escape model.  The moment he has you that's it, you're done.  He doesn't give a fuck bout an entity ... you just can't make him work without it being not true to him.
---
Well, PWYF rewards game control. If you're able to locate who you want and manipulate chases, you get stacks, which let you more easily eliminate the rest of the team.
---
Alternatively, it's a bit of a crutch and bolsters weak chasers in some cases/encourages rotation.
---
Sounds about right. Time and space are meaningless in the fog. Being tortured and murdered by your future forms seems right up the Entity‚Äôs alley.

If they ever made DBD2 the first killers should be Dwight, Claudette, Meg, and Jake.

I always figured the heartbeat was the survivor's and it gets louder/faster to show their fear/anxiety at the killer getting closer. Makes sense that the killer can't hear it then as well.
---
That's a super cool feature though! Fingers crossed they'll port it over.
---
I‚Äôve had this happen twice
---
No, it doesn't. The terror radius stays on her body until she reappears, and while she phases you can only hear the phasing sound (unless she has the add-on that removes it).

Tfw you can hit skillchecks but they feel like they are running on 5 fps.

Honestly all of the Survivor perks are pretty good. Steve definitely has the worst of the bunch but I can see each of Nancy's perks fitting somewhere in the meta. Demogorgon is a solid killer and has awful perks. Probably the worst killer perks in the game beyond Ghostface perks and unrelenting.
---
It genuinely blows my mind that people can say it's easy to play killer when they have three hours total logged as the Killer and haven't been above rank 15 yet Survivor have an 80% escape rate at rank one.
---
But what do I know. I play Both Sides equally and get salt from both. I think we did a pretty good job so far
---
just got it and it was worth it 10x
---
I literally just gave you PC red rank 1 stats of a survival rate at that rank. You are the one making claims with no evidence.
---
Yes there are killers that are better than others.  Just because not every killer can compete doesnt mean the game isnt balanced. Personally I play the pig the most and shes not one of the big 3 you can still have fun.  Theres tons of useless perks for survivors which is the only thing to differentiate the survivors.  There's also hundreds of videos online you can find of "non Meta" killers winning in red rank games shit even getting a 4k.
---
The stats are 4 months old and the most recent we have. Since then they nerfed MoM to the ground too.
---
But keep acting like the survivors get away 80% of the time implying that on average killers only get 1 kill a game when there's explicit fucking evidence saying you are wrong.
---

[Shia LaBeouf confirmed as next Killer. ](https://youtu.be/o0u4M6vppCI)
---
Here‚Äôs my take since you‚Äôre new. First I‚Äôd start out with
---
Lithe, technician (I will assume you are still learning to hit skill checks, totally okay!), alert, dark sense. Some say spine chill but honestly when I started playing I didn‚Äôt like that perk because I was like if I got the little thing that the killer is looking at me I was outtie. 
---
Of course if you are already good at skill checks then you don‚Äôt need technician! I really like we‚Äôll make it but that is an altruistic perk (helps your teammates and not yourself) because of the fast heals after hook. So it‚Äôs up to you if you wanna test it. Kindred is good if you‚Äôre solo queue because sometimes the other survivors don‚Äôt automatically go and save you. Lightweight can trip up the newer killer‚Äôs since they rely on scratchmarks. Hope is decent if you‚Äôre good at surviving till the last gen is completed. Small game, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend for newbies. Not resilience, this is not happening, or no one left behind. Plunderer‚Äôs instinct can help you get better items so I like it, kinda underrated in the new players department. Some use premonition but I think seeing the killer‚Äôs aura is best for new players. I would recommend dark sense over premonition and spine chill.
---
Legion needs a buff for sure indeed

My friend.  It's hard to find people of that sentiment nowadays.  In my 32 years on this planet Evolve was probably my favorite multiplayer experience ever.  A shame what happened to it.

Just wait a bit before queuing for another lobby.

Today I was playing against a clown. I ended up last in the match with hatch closed. I was opening a door while he was coming back patrolling. I put myself on last pixel of door to heal me and get some points when noticed he suddenly stopped. 15 seconds of stare and next time I knew I was dead on hook.
---
Pop is just a better ruin /s, survivors will die for that last gen, and they will die because you regressed it to 0% cause they kept tapping it
---
Wait a while for before re queue

I feel like most other killers would've lunged there, but you for sure lucked out with that one, nice.

Pretty much. Hell they barely added the "feature" of not having to reinvite after every single game lmfaoooo

They need to fix that shit. Literally happened twice to me. It‚Äôs not common but it should have been gone ages ago

Honestly I would love a killer who has a giant eyeball for a head. Or a robotic killer. I just really hope we don't get Pennywise. It would make no sense since Pennywise is just a form it uses. Not even to be creepy. To appeal to children. It's a entity of its own and I don't think the entity you could work with it or would want to.
---
A giant eyeball like this would be so creepy. Or some sort of Flesh Golem. Same with a robot. Or Harry Warden from My Bloody Valentine. Either way the demogorgon opens us up to a whole bunch of new killer possibilities

I had this exact situation this rank 20 billy just gave up and stood in the corner of the map it was so sad

why are gays so obsessed with dbd?
---
I didn‚Äôt want to be ‚Äúthat arrogant prick‚Äù, but truth be told I have no issue countering Spirit; as long as you run with a plan, and if she tries to fake you out at pallets or windows, have a back up escape route or jungle gym and run to that. Alternatively, try walking/crouching away‚Äîyou‚Äôd be amazed how effective that is. IW just makes all the aforementioned much easier to do (plus, it counters ALL killers‚Äîespecially those of us that use headphones‚Äîso it‚Äôs not just for one specific killer). The only time I‚Äôve actually had difficulty against Spirit is when she has the Prayer Beads, but that‚Äôs a whole other conversation.

GIMP is a freebie photoshop, so that said you need to know how to work with the software to make icons. GIMP is easy to use nonetheless, so once you got the hang of it, it is relatively easy. You are not doing images of high resolution so the task is a lot simpler.
---
That's what happens when you have literally the worst character in the game as your Meme photo. I could hardly call Joey a character at all. He's just a skin.

On a serious note though this is very very true. Can relate 100%. Killers are punished for succeeding

I realistically dont see them being able to make bots that could recreate Real matches.

 I doubt AI survivors would be able to mimic real survivors doing mindgames, hiding etc. And how would teamwork work? Would They Just Bee-line towards a nearby injured survivor? And I dont think they could even walk around the randomly generated maps. 
---
AI Killers would completly erase hiding and any mindgame potential, they wouldnt even be able to properly use their abilities without being extremly predictable. If they even were able to walk around the map without getting stuck.

Not saying that this would be ton of work for a game mode which barely anyone would play.

what tf do you mean? i have 80mbps fiber with 3ms ping to a local server. the further away you are from me the higher ping you're gonna have.
---
 
---
ping/latency is the time it takes for information to travel from point A to point B, it's not the host/killer who is lagging, he can play just fine with 0 latency/ping, it's you who has 400 ping and is lagging because of the distance between you and the host
---
If we ever get workshop support I hope we also get custom perk support (obv for custom match only)
---
But hey I‚Äôm not picky
---
Children's Book (Red Forest) and Decrepit Clapboard (Haddonfield)
---
They could've definitely worded it better but I can understand what they mean. With how broken Matchmaking is if i'm joining a lobby as a Rank 10 and see a Rank 20 and 19 then I'm not going to expect a good match because I have two possible teammates who aren't going to preform well enough to pull their weight so we can get generators done.
---
You know what would really help bring in new player while also not just throwing them into matches with no knowledge on what to do and expect them to not drop the game after having multiple bad matches? (Besides obviously hotfixing matchmaking immediately along with the 50 bugs and glitches expected with every update we get.) Actually making tutorials instead of the two bare bones ones we have so people actually have a basic understanding of what everything does. A tutorial on playing as and against each Killer at the very least needs to be a thing so people know things like to crouch while being unhooked against Hag,  not having a staring contest against Myers, not everyone suicide bombing the hooked Survivor against Bubba, good spots to place traps as Trapper or Hag, knowing how Reverse Bear Traps work, etc etc etc...
---
Wraith, bing bong is his bell
---
Got my first ever save by dropping a pallet today. It felt good
---
Happens on pallets too
---
Thank you
---
Its not like the game costs more on consoles because of that. Oh wait.
---
Wow
---
I'm not 100% sure of this but I'm pretty sure timer kills significantly hurt your BP/pipping as opposed to having actually hooking them, so
---
Maybe you don't, but there absolutely would be people hiding and letting the entity kill them just to screw the killer out of points. Before end game was a thing there were survivors who would crouch around the edge of the map when they were the last alive just to waste the killer's time.
---
Your a monster, an insult to rule of law, a harbinger of despair and perhaps, even worse than Khaled Al-Asad.
---
Those perks are to give you "hope" since when the killer gets you and destroys that hope the suffering you give out is better.
---
Not every loop has to be unsafe for the game to be balanced. 
---
To counter loops you can't mind game don't try to switch directions all the time, just keep going in the same direction until the survivor is forced to drop the pallet.
---
And gen speeds are fine. I would agree that some toolbox + addon combinations can make it too fast but default gen speed are fine.
---
fuck thats satisfying
---
You lost. You‚Äôre just salty because you feel entitled to a win and cannot hold the game hostage forever.
---
You don‚Äôt tp as far if you‚Äôre looking down
---
Yeah, I have no excuse
---
Basically survivors are allowed to go full tryhard and actually try and win but the killer needs to make sure the survivors are having fun first and foremost
---
Behaviour, what the fuck is this bullshit? I went from a P3 Rank 1 Nurse to a P3 Rank 1 Spirit to a P3 Rank 1 Nurse *again.* My teammates were all on average about Rank 6 or 7.
---
This shit should NOT be happening. These players are far above the skill of the Survivors they're being put up against.
---
This goes in the other direction as well, by the way. I've had several games where my teammates have all been Rank 3 or higher and we've gone up against a Rank 7 or even Rank 11 Killer.
---
Fix the fucking matchmaking Jesus fucking Christ.
---
What's with the resurgence of archer quotes lately... not complaining just curious.
---
I was talking more about infinites. Haddonfield houses, the cowshed, ironworks, coal tower building etc...
---
Trapper should be immune to stepping in his own traps
---
F
---
100% no. It‚Äôs a strong perk as-is.
---
The hatch ties in with how the entity isn't supposed to be one sided, as mentioned in some dbd lore the entity presents a backdoor (hatch) for when it feels the survivors have done enough work to escape. This dynamic was again changed when the devs adding the hatch closing feature :/
---
I‚Äôm definitely not against end game, it‚Äôs something that was needed for that exact reason. But in my opinion, under certain circumstances, I don‚Äôt find it to be something that should count for the killer. Such as leaving a survivor on the ground and waiting 3 more minutes for the timer to run out just to watch them die by the entity and still get credit for something. And half the time, killers just chase people and wait for it to run out. The could be touching my ass and still not take a swing.
---
Maybe as a Purple or Pink add on because that'd be way too much for base power and probably at the very least 50 glitches with it interacting with literally everything.
---
Dude this is nothing. I'm rank 16 and got put up with 3 red rank survivors against a rank 19 or so demogorgon
---
Are you talking about huntress 1 shots and hit boxes or the delay after you release the hatchet, there was also a delay on plague vomiting.
---
LMAO no I don‚Äôt feel entitled to win. It‚Äôs my opinion so I don‚Äôt understand why you think I have some type of entitlement just because I disagree with this??? üòÇ
---
Wow I've never seen this before...
---
The *lowest* tier killers still have a 50% kill rate (tie game)?! Doesn't that mean they're balanced and shouldnt be buffed?
---
Legion has a 50% kill rate, statistics are not against you
---
y u mad @ my opinion boss
---
By puppy guard I assume you mean camping which is a problem with the player. Deep wounds is a minor inconvenience. When they're in frenzy you shouldn't be trying to outrun them, and besides they can only injure you in frenzy and put deep wounds. If they hit you again or get out of the ability they are stunned for 4 seconds. Legion is super weak compared to all the other killers.
---
you made me giggle
---
 She was gonna be a paid dlc but they set community challenges that we completed  and gave the chapter for free.
---
When he is in his power, you are safe to do whatever you want basically with the 4 second stun and not able to down anyone. He is also very slow, and just by using loops or using Sprint Burst or Spine Chill allows you to easily outrun Legions.
---
Loop her she is slow
---
Your opinion is garbage
---
Not quite
---
Noed is ok - it's the only real scare in the game. 
---
Went against a mediocre pig killer last night and we all escaped because his noed didn't activate. Clean those bones.
---
Actually, you keep pulling from the average escape rate of SWF over all ranks. Which is going to be low between the players who let altruism rule their decision making, the teams who just like to dick around, or the teams who have a super low rank player to abuse match making getting shafted by a skilled killer.
---
I'm pulling from the graph that refered to the average escape rate of individual players in each different rank. At every rank better tham rank 20, the escape rate is 50%. That's across PC and Console. On that same graph, rank 2 has a 60/70% escape rate and rank 1 has an 80% escape rate. Still inaccurate due to the influx of deranked players as a result of losses and disconnects, but if that data were more accurate, it would be about the same. As a result, the players who actually try to win are escaping around 75% of the time. Meaning red rank survivors are leaving 1 person behind in almost every game.
---
Keep being a biased, low rank dumbass all you want, it doesn't offend me none, but if you want to debate an incorrect point using faulty evidence, that's your fault. Don't stoop to getting angry at me because I've used logic and actual evidence to explain how you are actually full of shit.
---
no
---
Continhe to cry about my opinion
---
I have a friend that will DC everytime i cleanse against her. Personally I don't like Plague having a permanent NOED through the match with the potential to easily see your aura. The only thing ive heard to do is cleanse at a fountain away from any gens and on yhe other side of the map
---
Please be joking.
---
This was worth killing my karma
---
Like what would the point of mad grit be if the survivors couldn't bodyblock you?
---
the only one crying is you
---
Dbd has a variety selection of survivors. If you dont wanna play them then that's your choice. Behaviour cant please everyone.
---
*Exposed*
---
but you‚Äôre complaining about my complaint so therefore you‚Äôre just upset bc my opinion isn‚Äôt your opinion. So cry about it some more
---
I made a post about this when rich presence first came out, hope it happens.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/7bwqgb/should_dbd_be_supported_with_rich_presence_from/
---
He should get the points, you could‚Äôve opened exit gates. It‚Äôs not impossible in 1v1 situation as I‚Äôve been chased with at least 40% left to do on it and still escaped.
---
No, I‚Äôm not upset that your opinion isn‚Äôt my opinion. I just think it‚Äôs a stupid opinion
---
If you don‚Äôt cleanse shes a killer with no power. Yeah it sucks that you‚Äôre injured permanently but she has nothing to help her in a chase and shes very tall which make mindgames much harder for her.
---
Use no mither if you are going against a lot of plagues
---
Thanks for stopping by but I never said I didn‚Äôt want to play them :)
---
Shit... maybe that was my problem, looking slightly down keeping visual on the survivor I'm trying to blink over to
---
I know it isn‚Äôt impossible. I‚Äôve done it plenty. My opinion is MAINLY pointed at killers purposefully not hooking and killing someone just so they can shake their head at me and let the entity kill me lmao so I don‚Äôt think he should get the points.
---
I hope it does happen too. Maybe even the ability to join and invite friends in Discord, since it's possible with XBL and PSN menus &amp; friends lists.
---
Not only are you 1-hit but you're also very audible
---
The Demodogs from season 2
---
&gt;What about base bloody coil sounds OP? What kind of stuff would happen in trapper games that would be total BS? Remember, injured survivors could disarm without penalty. 
---
That you're punished for trying to actually counter the power?
---
If it was something like disarming bear traps had skill checks and failing one injures you then sure because that'd actually make much more sense and justify you getting injured then just randomly being injured for disarming a trap even though you did nothing to warrant it.
---
lol never inferred that women couldn't do the same task, just that it was called something else, mostly a joke amongst my friends when we used to play together
---
Because The Entity wants you to torture the survivors, not straight up kill them
---
It‚Äôs annoying to activate as you have to heal 1 full state. But think about it after you‚Äôre unhooked you could use those 34 seconds on a gen instead of finding someone to heal you or healing yourself which is 32 with self care (if you use it). That‚Äôs almost 50% on a solo gen or a gen complete with another person. Plus you can activate it twice or even when you‚Äôre mid chase it can activate. It‚Äôs a very strong atm I don‚Äôt think it needs buff, plus protection hits are too easy to get.
---
Because killers always give survivors the chance to utilize No Mither, especially if you're solo-queuing
---
imma be honest but would a controller really inhibit you that much as a survivor? console player here but i have a pc(xbox game pass has this game is why)
---
The only fix for NoED is to remove NoED and Adrenaline so there isn‚Äôt an endgame crutch perk on either side. Bad killers/survivors will utilize these perks to make up for their lack of skill until removal.
---

Follow this link and then click on the second comment. Thats the link to the developer saying that the graph youre referencing showing 80% survivor rate is false and it is actually around 43%. Were talking about the same information im just showing you its not correct.
---
Could have potentially been a SWF (survive with friends)
---
If I may say I‚Äôd suggest if you hear her use a fountain hide for as long as it takes for it to be useless
---
I definitely really enjoyed it and I really hope someone picks up the concept. There isn't enough asymmetric multiplayer in general, it's just such an interesting experience if done right.
---
He/she doesn‚Äôt get the extra points of downing the survivor or chasing them. Just a sacrifice.
---
Original post?
---
it is so the blink goes the furthest distance. If you look down when you blink, you don't go as far
---
I'd like to see Clown made a little better.  I've been playing for about a month or so and haven't seen him once, but the Clown seems like a fun character.  Almost thinking about buying the DLC to play him myself even though I don't really play killer.
---
This is a horrible idea. The ideas behind adreniline and noed are real things in life. It's not a crutch
---
If you‚Äôre unsure, just check every second post on this sub.
---
It could come down to people without colorblindness getting an advantage by using the settings, although you can already get an advantage on survivor by playing around with them anyway so its not an excuse at this point.

I was gonna say this! I started watching the series because of the DLC and I think having the Byers house + neighborhood/backyard with shed and forest would've been way better. I'd also say the middle school but that wasn't shown that much either and we already have a school map.

Scratch marks in grass? You mean the slightly brighter grass? Red stain? Oh so that isn't part of the wood/ dark stone wall? Well fk me right? Claudette on grass? Alright that one is just blind to everyone lol
---
Pig first
---
Duck at high walls and pallets to avoid her puking on you with her power.
---
I sill think it's dumb that they aren't releasing a new map with every chapter. Maps variety os incredibly important in this game. It was very evident that the game needs maps when we had a 6 month gap between Plague and Demo without a map.
---
It's that common?
---
Don't cleanse unless she is using the ultra rare add-on that gives her free corrupt. It's hard being one shot but it's a small price to pay for living. She's a slower killer so its not like it's hard to loop her
---
1. His speed isn't that much. He only moves at 5.04 m/s while cloaked, which is barely faster than Legion.
---
2. Demogorgon, Spirit, Nurse, and Billy are better at protecting their totems. Myers, Ghostface, Billy, Plague, Pig and Leatherface are as good or better at punishing people they find cleansing totems. In any case, it's not relevant, because you don't win games by cheesing people you find doing totems. You win by chasing people down and keeping them off gens, and Wraith is ass at that.
---
3. That doesn't really matter. You can hit rank 1 on any killer, but that doesn't mean you're fighting good survivors. On the occasion you *do* end up fighting good survivors, you're just going to lose if you aren't using a strong killer.
---
4. Increase his cloaked movement speed, increase his movement speed while uncloaking, give him Bone Clapper at base, increase his uncloak haste potency, rework the uncloak haste into something he can use on demand at any time when uncloaked, make him completely invisible from a distance, change Lightburn into something other than a stun, fix the bug that causes "The Ghost" to stop you from immediately picking up chase on uncloak, fix the bug that stops Wraith from immediately attacking after uncloaking via "The Serpent", increase his base stats, silence his footsteps in stealth so he can better hear survivor footsteps, change "The Beast" to give post-trial BP instead of just instantly maxing deviousness, change Blink add-ons to increase his speed while reappearing...
---
&gt; he shouldn‚Äôt get the points if I can out skill him for three minutes so that he can‚Äôt catch me.
---
If you outskill them, why didn't you leave?
---
also it is 2 minutes, not 3

All killers are god like if you are good with them. He's just hard to play. Just like old freddy
---
If you remind the devs that the Pig exists, they will nerf her.
---
Every perk is a crutch
---
Then No Mither just exists for some reason.
---
My best advice would be to loop her while broken until endgame is near. If all the generators are completed (or a bit earlier than that), she can't waste time going to drain a blood fountain. So cleanse then
---
Thats the only thing going for plague. You being 1 hit and audible after a WHILE. you can hide real good to be maybe infected at 3-2 gens. Play careful and always be near defensible positions. Other than that give her some slack Plague is hard enough to do well with already
---
Currently yes... mm is heavily broken after this last patch, which is saying something because it already was not in a great spot before.
---
regardless of how long lmao and bc I was being chased lmao???? as I said, if I can out run him and not be caught *
---
If you cleanse do it far away. And if she has her power just loop her until she is right behind you. She slows down significantly while charging her puke so you can bait it out and get an extra loop or a few out of it. Also, if you stun her while she has the corrupt it makes her lose it. Just try and play more immersed with her. I found that to be very helpful.
---
Honestly I feel that besides the rotation speed of the camera, it isn't a detriment at all.
---
and he shouldn‚Äôt get the points for sacrificing if they didn‚Äôt do the sacrificing
---
No, they‚Äôre secret like mori‚Äôs
---
I would switch bamboozle for spirit fury. That's just me though so If you're used to bamboozle that's cool .
---
Aged like milk with these current matchmaking issues
---
oh no not netflix!
---
And yet a Mori still only requires one hook to satisfy the entity.
---
Fun fact with head on, you can trigger Head-on and sprint burst at the same time with a rushed exit, letting you stun the killer and sprint off.
---
I just saw this happen in my last match to someone. The Devs really need to fix this game.
---
It feels kinda off with no elapsed time. But I guess rank and gens are a pretty good factor to use.
---
Only time you should cleanse is when you‚Äôve like 4/3 gen yourself. So cleansing cross map if the plague goes there she will end up losing, Looping a killer that‚Äôs 4.6 m/s is literally the same as wraith. No help against loops can‚Äôt use her power so it‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt be hard. It‚Äôs not like NoEd as NoEd is only as strong as it is due to the 5% speed boost you also get. If your whole team is broken and you‚Äôre the one who cleanses early game you deserve everything you get end game chat.
---
Itd be sick to see a badass hardened Dwight in a sequel too tho. Punished Venom Dwight or some shit, but yeah having past survivors as killers would be cool as well.
---
Here's the full parent video for anyone who wants to see the full thing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JB-6bVMu-oI
---
I couldn't enable elapsed time for the concept as my program didn't have that functionality implemented.
---
if you can outrun him and not get caught, then why not take the heat at the start and loop for 5 gens, then adrenaline escape?
---
Not like NoEd, no speed boost. That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs so easy to loop.
---
i would hate to see clown get buffed like that. he is already Easy huntress.
---
I want this to happen to me

It's always a sad day when I see my daily ritual involves playing the Wraith

why should I have to take the heat just because I can outrun him? LMAO i know how to gens too? if everyone did gens when they weren‚Äôt being chased it‚Äôd be a different story ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

But in all seriousness, Color Blind mode would be INCREDIBLY useful for (obviously) people that are Color Blind but at the same time, even for people who aren't. I think it's absolutely essential to be implemented but I feel like that maybe part of the reason why they DON'T introduce it. If you can change things like aura colors, it can be astronomically easier to see things even with regular color vision. Hooks stand out a lot more when they're blue and everything else is darker and more red. Generators, survivors, totems, etc. Those would all share the issue I feel.
---
Personally if it was implemented I would likely use it for both the advantage that I feel it would give as well as because I just like blue more. I know I think it was last summer we had an event that made the hook auras blue and it was insanely easy to spot them at a glance.

If you absolutely NEED to cleanse then do it at the furthest fountain from whatever generators you need to get done so Plague has to waste time to get to it then waste her super vomit timer bringing it back.

Keep doing gens to make progress even while sick because it won't spread until you're fully sick.

Why is quentin looking dead behind them all, and what the hell is claudette doing behind the counter?
---
I will always reiterate that it is impossible to depip in matches like this outside of your own fault. Even at the highest ranks, 1-hooking everyone right away will always result in a black pip with gold/iridescent guaranteed in gatekeeper and Devout and roughly about silver for Malicious/Chaser.
---
Even at the very worst, you are guaranteed about 9-10 points (minimum needing to be 9 to safety pip in red ranks.)
---
With the only exceptions being that you facecamped the survivors or just slugged them and let them bleed out on the ground. Which are 2 ways you can either lose points or just negate getting them.
---
If you somehow manage to wipe the survivors instantly and still depip it is your fault because it shouldn't statistically happen with how the emblem system is setup.
---
Adepts are supposed to be a challenge.  The double pip means you can't just cheese your way through it by equipping an ebony mori or facecamping survivors to death.
---
Good point. Thanks

I believe that it needs a percentage of one health state instead of one whole health.Not big difference,it would be like 90%,85%,80%. Just enough to not be wasted if your teammate use a second of self-heal in accident,just to be more consistent .Not to big as you need to heal the other for almost the entire duration.

I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre decent at skill checks and get 1 great and 5 goods that‚Äôs a 25% generator regression versus just like 5-10% generator regression and a .25 delay every 5 seconds or something. Depends on how many greats you get though I guess.

Like, an opinion differing from mine is one thing, but most of the time people just make suggestions that would change the game too much, they don‚Äôt really think about balance, and just want shit changed so they don‚Äôt have to learn to counter shit

It also doesn‚Äôt help that we are split into two camps during any discussion, as a suggestion most likely will impact one side positively.

I‚Äôve also heard many options already, as many people share the same, and hearing the same shit for the 25th time is just straight up annoying and changes your will to discuss to a will to tell the other person all the arguments why their opinion is shit, turning it into a negative comment, turning the discussion into a shitstorm
---
We usually get a Summer BBQ event but it was canceled this year due to working on dedicated servers and Gorgon.
---
Because if we make Ghostface easy to detect with *no compensation*, we get the absolute joke of a killer we had when the PTB launched.
---
I understand what you're saying. I just put OC on it as on other sub reddits and other places people put OC on their memes so that's why I had OC in the title.
---
While I‚Äôm not a massive fan of NoED (mainly play surv), I think it‚Äôs incredibly healthy perk to be in the game, simply because the threat of it being there is enough to encourage people to do totems as a second objective. I found this way more noticeable when I took part in the vanilla gameplay experiment. Knowing 100% there was no NoED really took some threat out and gens flew by even faster. 
---
Not to mention end game builds are a thing. It might not be super fun to go against but I believe people should be able to try different playstyles that synergise well instead of constantly playing the meta. 
---
Adrenaline isn‚Äôt an issue either. It‚Äôs only strong when you a) get lucky and it procs in chase, which isn‚Äôt super common, or b) you stay injured to do gens, which is a risk/ reward situation. It‚Äôs fine.
---
Good Team Work
---
It's alright. Being wrong was a consistent theme across your post.
---
Your last post's threads was a shit fest.
---
Also, He.
---
100% for both, console player.
---
Watch out! He's got a pocket saw!
---
You‚Äôve successfully established a bond with your ally
---
Well then, why would 75% of the player base vanish (as you said yourself) for something like that? 
---
For the things you said all that is needed is few bots that move in certain paterns and you being able to start Kyf by yourself.
---
Thanks for coming back. cx
---
Same here.
---
Most of the people who say to not cleanse don‚Äôt usually heal during the match anyway. They are used to being injured
---
That sounds more like a bug than intentional since both are exhaustion perks.
---
I knew Adam was up to something
---
i'm amazed that half of them didn't disconnect immedately.
---
Apparently you're the dip if you think that's how colorblind would work or even that being what is asked for.
---
Literally only scratches and auras. Fuck off with your attitude when you clearly aren't up to speed on what you're bitching about.
---
sssshh he‚Äôs sleeping
---
I could imagine
---
No one said instant tr loss? I figured it was implied that she should be able to crouch and uncrouch faster so she could teabag but her tr would regress at the normal speed it does when ah takes 5 seconds to crouch rn.
---
Yep I've noticed it as well, was being carried by a killer, pallet stun and it didn't do anything.
---
The normal meta perks. Just like all survivor/killer builds.
---
CowsIam: Now this is big brain time
---
Before anything I want to say I do not condone glitching, exploits, hacks, cheating, etc. I didn‚Äôt know how to do this prior to today, I didn‚Äôt think it was still possible. And I don‚Äôt intend to do this again. This was don‚Äôt in a CUSTOM GAME/KYF, and was never taken to actual games and will not be taken to them. 
---
I was playing Kill Your Friends and due to a miscommunication one of my friends accidentally did this. I won‚Äôt say how. I‚Äôve in fact had to delete my twitch VOD because I was streaming at the time as well. 
---
But uh yeah...it was funny and interesting and we all are reporting or have already reported it via a bug report.
---
Sorry we cant the take that joke the devs al ready nerf perks for joke like that
---
Another person mad simply because my opinion differs. Opinions are opinions, therefore they aren‚Äôt wrong. Didn‚Äôt you know that‚Äôs how that works?
---
+1
---
I can't play on low sens on dbd, your camera is stupidly important
---
Your sacrifice was not in vain Steve lives on
---
I don't see how it's harming anyone if it's KYF..
---
Thats how I feel about dailies. Once I complete it i don't give a fuck what happens. Here I'll open the gate for you, just get the fuck out.
---
Okay? So he presses a button (doesn‚Äôt have to crouch which he specified) and he has no TR after 5 seconds and moves full speed, Still no counter, built in mobile insidious, pretty whack
---
Because you make really stupid posts. There is a reason you are being downvoted to hell, your opinion is garbage and you are just whining for no reason.
---
Stop being disabled 4Head

I tried to crosspost because I dont like theft.  But DBD mods deleted it because cross post are not allowed apparently.

---
Rise up!  Loop the mods for the whole game!
---
All you have to do as a survivor is not die. I can‚Äôt tell you how many matches I‚Äôve walked out of where I barely even saw the Killer.
---
As I understand, it‚Äôs an issue with Sony‚Äôs (possibly Microsoft‚Äôs) guidelines on achievements. You aren‚Äôt allowed to change the wording on trophies/achievements. In theory, it‚Äôs to prevent situations like this from happening: changing the criteria on how achievements are unlocked. The achievement says ‚ÄúMerciless Killer‚Äù so that‚Äôs what everyone has to achieve to earn it (even if how hard that is changes).
---
Probably rage quit
---
I hate playing Clown. It's easy as hell to catch survivors, takes maybe half a brain cell to win a chase, and you still frequently lose 3/4 survivors by the end of the game. 
---
If you want to buy a DLC for what to me is an enjoyable killer, I recommend going with Plague, Spirit, or Ghostface.
---
Whats the dunce cap perk?
---
Ironic after reading the comments you made. YIKES
---
Yeah most likely but why waste the points and my time and just burden their teamates
---
Claudette B
---
I only made a few rude comments to people who didn‚Äôt know what they were talking about ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è but I wouldn‚Äôt actively be rude to someone just because of their differing opinion
---
there are a few reasons people may DC, such as rage quit, bad connection, to deny bbq and chilli, moris (this is pretty common) or to meme.
---
You are asking for something like old DS or Mettle of Man pre nerf . All you have to do is heal someone else and later in the match you get a free heal for doing nothing!! It‚Äôs strong and if anything will are a nerf of some sort. 
---
The only buff I could see is that the broken status is NOT revealed to the killer. If I see you get unhooked and have that I‚Äôm going to assume deliverance or SW and you bet if I‚Äôm close by you‚Äôre going back on the ground. 
---
**downvoted by the survivor mains** I play survivor and killer equally.
---
It‚Äôs a fair option for the solo survivor with potato team mates to get out. If you pay attention during the match as the killer there is a good chance you can know where it is and go close it before they get to it.
---
Me husband now.
---
Paulie ester used to do it all the time in kyf and hasnt gotten banned. Pretty sure cows was banned for something else
---
The Demoman from Team Fortress 2 needs to become a skin first.
---
Because another free health state is worth giving to survivors?? Absolutely not. It‚Äôs a super strong perk as-is.
---
Because another free health state is worth giving to survivors?? Absolutely not. It‚Äôs a super strong perk as-is. Should adrenaline active with one gen left? NO.
---
ok but why waste the points like I don‚Äôt care what happens to me as a survivor I at least you get the points
---
Exactly. Thank you!!
---
‡ºº „Å§ ‚óï_‚óï ‡ºΩ„Å§
---
Only penalized if you're healthy. 
---
Remember, this feature already exists in the game as the bloody coil add on. It sounds like you're making a point that this is OP on its own, not that it *would* be OP as a component of his base kit. Also, the injury is not random. The injury is consented to by the survivor trying to disarm the trap while healthy, rather than playing around it or not. There are more ways than one to get around a trap.
---
I regret everything now
---
points don't matter to some people, they care about having fun, and the things above aren't fun to play, so they dc (except memeing, which is pretty fun to narnia juke and stuff)
---
i feel called out by this
---
I play controller on pc because it's incredibly simple controls and isn't some fps that requires precision aiming.
---
Ok
---
You know that you can add color blind support in Windows with the help of some programs right? This way it changes the colors on all your system so I don‚Äôt have to depend on third parties adding support to your condition
---
random 6th grade words be like
---
"GET 'EM, BOYS!"
---
Can you blind the killer while he‚Äôs stunned/breaking a pallet?
---
Because usually the dc is pretty early and you would end up with such a miniscule amount of points.
---
It's not like I abuse the lag, If a player lags and I hit them I just end the chase and let them go
---
When I dc its usually because my pc shitting
---
bruh. I was like rank 7, queued with my friend at like rank 11 or 12 and we got nothing but rank 20s almost. Lowest we seen was like a rank 17 killer I think.
---
Because matchmaking is fucked. I'm rank 4 and just tonight I got queued up with three rank 19s and a rank 20
---
You can kill without being toxic and using any cheap tactics to win. Especially to newcomers trying out the game.
---
I hate when this happens
---
There is a weekly bug report and a weekly rant thread, post there instead of flooding this sub with spam
---
Same! I wasn‚Äôt so fortunate to find a hatch right after though.
---
Recycling would just make the mori/instant heals super common, especially on bp boosting events.I'd never go into a match with less then a green medkit/toolbox.  
---
Instead i propose getting 1 iridescent shard for every gray item recycled, thus turning every 4000 or so into a skin.  With yellows and greens giving 2/3 shards, this is still incredibly grindy, but at least you would have a use of junk things with out messing up game balance too much.
---
I suppose you could even shrine of secrets them into bp if you wanted.. but its conversion for that would be really bad.
---
What you're saying is, it's a Shia surprise
---
we should‚Äôve never clicked on that link
---
Glad this bug still exists  many months after it's been made knowledge to the dev team, classic.
---
Yeah you can it‚Äôs a good way to get a bit of distance away or change directions
---
Pop, ruin, chili and M&amp;B &lt;----- Meta
---
Edit: Spirit (along with thw rest of the cast, doesnt have a specific 'good' build.) Just run meta. That's it.
---
Except that's your rules
---
Killer has the power not survivors
---
They can do what they want and survivors seem to forget that
---
I am absolutely floored that this many people have seen that obscure albeit glorious piece of cinematic genius.
---
I mean... Its funny but not true. I'm currently rank 4 to 5 and been and most of my games end up with rank 20-17. 
---
My first Merciless with Demogorgon was two purples and two perkless 20s
---
Unless they have a good set of headphones :/
---
The low quality survivors make this 10x better

I actually only started watching stranger things once the chapter came out, now I know the map layout
---
So this is whats being upvoted in this sub now huh
---
Can‚Äôt argue with that
---
Yeah that too lol
---
Let's you avoid snares and fake pallets, reduces repair time add-ons, reduces fast teleport add-ons etc. You get points.
---
Shit as a Freddy main I mean stay asleep. Let the swing chains hold you tight :)
---
He schleep
---
U suk my dik
---
I am 100% sure its not fake, but there is nothing to gain from faking is a lie. Internet points my friend. Somone at r/pics posted a picture of a wedding, and the the title was something like we just got married. And the thing is that picture got over 4000 upvotes and gold, silver, platinum. But picture was from some guy on instagram. OP stole the picture, claimed it was him and posted it on r/pics. Later People found out the source and OP deleted his account. And funny thing was, some People said wow what a cute couple, wish you all the best, And OP responded with ty it means much too me. What People do for Internet points is really suprissing me.
---
doesn‚Äôt seem like they stood a chance ü§£
---
ur dik has fungus everywere.
---
He was originally wrongfully banned. I had a Dev actually arguing with me and a few others on here months ago claiming they never had banned him for it ever. (despite plenty of evidence of it) 
---
Then I think he  just said fuck it and kept doing it for YouTube content. He kept proving every time they claimed to have patched it that they in fact had not. He also eventually used it in real lobbies, not just KYF.
---
Also the Devs have proven time and time again that they play favorites when it comes to DBD content creators. They actively shun people like Noob3 and CowsIam while praising and turning a blind eye to others who do a lot of the same things. I mean shit they banned Noob3 for using a hack to get his Legacy back when they wouldn‚Äôt give it back to him, despite some of the FOG WHISPERS DOING THE SAME THING!! The difference is people like Noob3 are openly critical of the game. (Even though they still support the game.) And the Devs have proven to be egotistical ***(COUGH COTE COUGH)*** and unable to handle even constructive criticism so many times. That‚Äôs the difference. 
---
One of the reasons I like CowsIam is because he‚Äôs brought to light that either they are flat out lying about having fixed the issue, simply don‚Äôt care, or literally cannot fix it because they can‚Äôt figure it out. And none of those make them look good, which of course they don‚Äôt like.
---
Half the time the snipers arent even good lmao. He still wins most of the time.
---
So y'know how killers can't see survivors after downing them posts? Pretty sure this can relate to that problem, too.
---
Y‚Äôall going to McDonald‚Äôs???
---
&gt; No, he very much said he doesn't like it because it is gay. His words, not mine.
---
Saying he doesn't like it because it's gay doesn't make being gay inherently bad. It's not hard to disconnect these concepts. I do not like the color purple. Therefore I do not like when every other post is about the color purple. If this continues, I will be unhappy with the subreddit and likely stop viewing it. This does not make purple bad, this is merely my own views.
---
&gt;Sorry you don't like one variety of post. Other people do. That's why it gets popular.
---
Okay. Don't attack somebody for not liking something then. 
---
"You're not gay but YOU DON'T LIKE GAY THINGS? Stop being so homophobic!"
---
Is that a serious question?
---
The real description for that should be:
---
Playing as trapper
---
Five gens left
---
Placing down a trap- ah shit exit gates powered.
---
There's nothing to be proud of playing scummy.
---
The fact that you are angry about this shows that it actually bothers you that you play like this.
---
It was changed like many others to lessen the grind
---
Imagine use that against any other perk, especially survivor ones.
---
Adrenaline doesn't heal till lvl 3. DS? Doesn't work till lvl 3 but you still have the obsession chance. OoO same. And so on
---
He technically didn't gain anything lol. But I know what you mean, people fake shit for attention a lot.
---
Platform: PC
---
Type of Bug: Ingame, Audio
---
Description: Had a NUMBER of bugs tonight so I'll break them apart:
---
1) Played Sat. night (9/21) and leveled up Steve Harrington and The Shape. Got back online Sunday night (9/22) and all my progress was gone in terms of level-ups, but my bloodpoints were spent. Further, I still had my iridescent points, so I know the game saved SOME progress, but not my progression process. 
---
2) Group and I spent 30 minutes tonight being disconnected and dropped from matches. 
---
3) In one game I played tonight, the killer downed me, and screen broke into on the upper left and lower right corners. It looked like multiple chess boards arranged randomly around each other. Tried to take a screenshot but didn't work. 
---
I think the steps to reproduce, expected results, and actual results speak for themselves in all these problems. I don't know my computers exact specs but it's fine. Sorry if this isn't the exact right format, but this was a very frustrating night of playing the game for me. I know some problems come with rank resets, but this game was working fine all week until tonight.
---
P.S.: I've also been able to escape The Pig's traps lately. For myself and multiple teammates, every Jigsaw machine has laughed, including games where we tried every machine we could get to.
---
Hey
---
I didn't say they were good
---
But he does get sniped like every match
---
There's only 4 survivor slots and a lot who want to queue into him for any reason 
---
It's annoying when they bring all the instant heals / comms / farm map 
---
But hey whatever, it is what it is
---
OP said she was let go
---
This is so wholesome!
---
Angry ? 
---
I'm just defending players who do what they want
---
Don't project your rage onto me good sir
---
cheeki breeki
---
That was a once in a lifetime experience
---
In that case won't be an hex anymore but basic
---
If not.. do bones
---
DID I STUTTER ABOUT LOWERCASE LETTERS?
---
I just don't know what the meta perks are really.
---
oh no my feelings ):
---
Gens you, doing?
---
Add a tiny billy in the corner. Your meme needs to be DBD related.
---
Well, they can knock themselves out and continue playing that way.
---
But don't expect to look for approval from me or other players who want to play clean game.
---
And like I said, eventually it'll catch up with you as you encounter better survivors and as BHVR implements more camping and tunnelling penalties.
---
Honestly I think it's not about the actual game, but the fact that survivors teabag and killers facecamp as a way of toxicity
---
Leaving the game to avoid going to the dream world in the first place
---
Especially for Scoops Steve
---
Thanks now i want pumpkin hag :(
---
Happens to me a lot, I get goomba'd so hard I just try to get some points haha. People are generally good sports about it though and I always throw out a gg regardless. I actually succeeded in winning a match as trapper tonight and got accused of being a tryhard, with my baby perks and padded bear traps &gt;:v
---
You might want to scroll down.
---
And chill the fuck out.
---
The way it is now is much better than it used to be. When you destroy a team and have 1 survivor alive and 5 gens left it sucks. Hatch stand offs suck even more tho so leave it alone. That being said I don't like how when someone opens the hatch with a key and you close it, then because there's 1 survivor left it reopens. If I close it you shouldn't be able to use it again without a key.
---
No.  He just looks like he‚Äôs running.  Ghostface does the same it makes it feel like he‚Äôs faster than he really is.
---
I hope we get Harry Warden, but I can't think of a power for him
---
A killer being bad means they *are not an option* if you want to play the goddamn game.
---
Wraith being bad is basically no different from Wraith not existing.
---
Remember those Tourneys that happened a while back?
---
Remember how it was almost **all Nurse?**
---
If BHVR had a functioning rank system that sorted people by skill rather than "ability to fill emblems", Rank 1 would look exactly like that because at the highest level of play, **that's the only killer who fucking works**.
---
Sloppy, Nurses, Dying light and thanotophobia
---
With jake in the supply closet
---
I was the killer here. I was chasing the Nea (btw for OP to prove its me; there was also a nancy with a flashlight that blinded me a bunch lol, can post my perks too if I need to but I had 3 stacks on that dying light by the time I got stuck..) But anyways I was chasing the Nea on the second floor of the hospital building and lunged after her out one of the open ledges. It took me all the way to the rock; which wasn't that far from the building but the range extension on the Shred took me farther than it normally would for sure. Several of the survs tried to get close enough to the rock to let me autoattack them to get down; that didn't work but I was able to shred\* off the rock after a bit which I hadn't thought of since I couldn't move forward in any direction, lunging off worked even though it looked really buggy, and two of the survs had gone ahead and left by then lol.
---
As a Jake Main, SMH
---
Some overly harsh words for a rather well developed game.
---
Controller is poorly setup on pc. It takes a lot of messing with the settings to get anywhere near playable and even then kB/m is better
---
It is. I referenced a Dead by Daylight perk, but in context to something in real life.
---
I like playing as Bing Bong. He‚Äôs the only killer I‚Äôve managed to get a 3K with (grantee, I‚Äôve only been playing for about 10 hours). Sure, he eats palettes for breakfast, lunch, and dinner, but I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs as bad as people say. I do think he could use some help when it comes to chases, though.
---
Do bones
---
Obligatory ‚Äúmore power to you, you do you and play with controller till your hearts content‚Äù mushy stuff aside? I‚Äôll try and take a crack at this.
---
For starters controllers are more ergonomically restricted compared to having a full keyboard. So when it comes to movement, you do your strafing and steering with the analog and action button where on PC? It‚Äôs the mouse in coridioton to WASD, itself offering more input variety I suppose.
---
To be honest, it‚Äôs a topic I never really got to the bottom of myself so take this all as a PC players shower thoughts. I don‚Äôt mind controllers personally, love using them for racing games and platformers especially. But typically I‚Äôd sooner use M&amp;KB.
---
100% of the time someone on a hook on the other side of the map can see him lol.... I'd prefer they fixed that and literally standing 2 feet in front of him.
---
Common enough to be annoying. I started playing the game two weeks ago and have had it happen to me 3 times and once to my friend. This guy got lucky with the hatch but I haven‚Äôt
---
I‚Äôve seen so many Candy Man posts I‚Äôve never seen 1 nun one and Chucky and Pinhead are two
---
Of the biggest Slashers ever so of course they will be suggested more and Penny Wise just had a hit movie like a year ago and has a never movie out so if course people will be suggesting him also a lot of people probably don‚Äôt know Candy Mans getting a new movie I only learned that he‚Äôs getting a new movie recently and I love Candy Man
---
Aw, warm and fuzzy
---
FREE HIM
---
I understand that reference
---
So you're saying that I should play to lose, subsequently sacrificing my own enjoyment so someone else can have fun? 
---
Yeah, how about no. I don't do that in fighting games or CS, I'm not going to do it here. You get unhooked in front of me and I'm dropping you again.
---
Call the Firemen
---
common for me on xbox too
---
Dignity in yourself (or lack of) as clean player who don't resort to shortcuts to win. 
---
It's like in your anger you have forgotten that this is a game where there's a real person behind the characters.
---
I don't know about you but I can't be proud of a win where I took advantage of a loophole.
---
You do realise that survivors also play killers right? In fact, some of the best killers out there are survivor main.
---
I almost never even find the damn hatch
---
I could hear this picture.
---
Um, no lol thats a horrible comparison. Should have said teabagging and genrushing like the usual complainers
---
I think you may have misunderstood me, I was wondering how controllers would be more precise for DBD, and how they have independent direction (which as far as I can tell doesn't exist in DBD).
---
Shit I totally spaced and forgot to page /u/SleepyDreamsAwoken too! :)
---
I know playing against better players is how you learn and all but sometimes the skill gap is too great to be useful in any way...
---
Gorgon main. That was the funnest asymmetrical game i‚Äôve ever played. It used to be such fun
---
You could also think it's just the entity toying with your emotions and sanity making you think you got away safely but, then you get hit when the killer is 8 yards behind you.
---
There will practically always be a meta, even if you buff bad killers. Most people aren't rank one, and just want to have fun, even with a bad killer. If you want to win, you can use Nurse, or Hillbilly with bbq, if not you can use wraith and just mess around. It doesnt make sense for everything in the game to be designed for the sole purpose of being good, when thats not what all players want.
---
Tell that to survivors. Since a lot of them don't know what tunneling, camping, or cheating actually are.
---
lmfao what
---
Well yeah, if you gen rush and there‚Äôs no way to stop you, what are we going to do? Now do yalls understand why there‚Äôs so many nurses and spirits when survivors bully lower tier killers?
---
That would be amazing. When I did the tutorials, I felt it was so lacking on both sides.
---
Stop bullyng baby killers
---
mixer.com/UpLate
---
There‚Äôs a bug where you lose progress and for everything you did in your last session, don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs causing it
---
I actually hallow blight and hated all the special-gen events since the matches are so unfun
---
The worst ones are when it shows you vaulted through the window but then sucks you right back and you get downed.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why you believe that? The achievement only says to escape with the 3 unique perks. The hatch is escaping.
---
So would someone fail to get the achievement if they used any color of a mori then? It must be double pip and 4 sacrifices only? Sorry for the questions just want to know correct info is all.
---
At lower ranks you still get rank 1 survivors so it doesn't matter.
---
Source: rank 14 killer
---
Wouldn't it be better to run enduring if you encounter this scenario often?
---
Because as a survivor using M&amp;KB, you are restricted to just 8 analog direction inputs (WASD with up to 2 keys held).  You have to twitch your mouse to get minute imputes to adjust from this if you need an angle faintly off this "track."
---
A joystick does not have this restriction.  You can freely move in all 360 degrees (assuming its a good one, anyway).  This means you can use your camera and move it independently of it impacting your movement assuming you are adjusting your course.
---
Is this a massive advantage?  No.  But it is a potential one.  For survivors, there isn't many other interactions to worry about that need precise camera control (Although some killers have ranged elements so the mouse's advantage there is kept).  The closest thing is Diversion.   Which, let's be real, is a joke perk that would be better served if it had auto-snap to relevant world objects.  Few killers at high ranks will fall for Diversion if there was nothing to have triggered the sound notification in the area.
---
Well leatherface is a bottom tier killer that not really anyone plays anymore but a perk designed to counter one trash tier killer sounds bad, especially when it starts countering normal killers with no ability to do anything against it. Basement camping as leatherface a completely different problem that is solved by doing generators and leaving as soon as possible.
---
That‚Äôs a Nea moment
---
How can you dodge a lobby if every lobby is 200 ping?
---
Shredding put you in that situation, and shredding got you out. Cosmic irony, lol.
---
Enduring doesn't have the stun reduction buff anymore it got nerfed a while back which Is why mad grit should get buffed to replace the power gap
---
Geez dude, you don't have to be such a Negative Nancy.
---
Because it's literally not supposed to happen. The wording has been vague but ever since I can recall only escaping through the gate gave it.
---
Oh no another exit gate glitch, first the glitch where you cant escape and you die to the end game timer because the killer closed the hatch and both gates wont let you escape, and now this?!
---
You are being hysterical now.
---
Some of those like borrowed time are game mechanic. Ironically created to prevent tunnelling that you so clearly endorsed. 
---
Some survivors do abuse things like flashlight clicking. It doesn't mean you have to be equally toxic in return.
---
That just makes you as bad as they are.
---
Idk I mean so far I've never really noticed or gotten a notification about survivors being near the portal. 
---
Plus travel time is a factor, and the portals are limited (5 as opposed to hags 10). 
---
You can still cleanse them and what not, and there's still a cool down per teleport.  It just gives him a bit more pressure. 
---
Or maybe make it so that the last portal is a disposable one. So I set 4 portals, and then the last one I make and then go to another one, but after using that last one it disappears. So I still have to set the portal and go through, but once I do that portal vanishes and my portal counter is filled up by one.
---
Enduring no longer reduces the DS stun. It‚Äôs only for pallet stuns now.
---
Same end result yeah
---
If they have the gates open and they are hooked right next to the gate and running DS and haven't used their DS yet then let them get the win
---
Thank you,wasn't aware
---
Literally? Where is that literally said? If you look at the achievement like I said earlier it just says to Escape. Is using the hatch not an escape? I don‚Äôt understand your logic.
---
With victory cube you were allowed 2 deaths if you sacrificed the other 2 IIRC. With emblems you CAN 4x mori but every surv needs to have been hooked twice first.
---
I think it should just be 4 sacrifices personally.
---
Thrilling Oinkers
---
My point is you're lucky any killers are left
---
If some of them facecamp / patrol hooks / do shit you don't like
---
Too fucking bad, Game sucks on both sides and you can't control the other side
---
SCP: Secret Laboratory is actually not bad once you learn how the game works and if you aren't phased by its ancient matchmaking technology and if you can find a decently populated server where 90% of the players don't die at the first sight of a weapon.
---
The anomalies are basically the killers and there are 2 teams of humans who are basically the survivors. The game is in a very rough and unfinished state, but it is decently enjoyable for a free game.
---
Underperform, it's been in the game files since launch and isn't used.
---
I can't imagine that happens too often
---
I'm a long time rank 1 killer player. 
---
Every killer that isn't nurse, spirit or Billy is at a tremendous disadvantage against red rank survivor players. 
---
Only nurse stands a chance against swf red ranks. 
---
Elite swf players will still body even in the world's best nurse players (google depip squad)
---
I see, idk if they nerfed Enduring I doubt they would buff Mad Grit. I don't really mind DS stuns personally
---
And this is why i run lightborn
---
I'm saying that it has always been like that on purpose. I don't know how long you've been playing but a change like that, to my memory was never addressed.
---
Pretty sure the notification is that you get Killer Instinct for anyone near a portal if you‚Äôre charging Of The Abyss. You won‚Äôt get notifications otherwise, unless it‚Äôs for the destruction of a portal. This is just speculation, but it‚Äôs what I‚Äôve seen.
---
Ghostface is up there with nurse on getting good imo. Nurse is by far way better than ghostface but the learning curve is roughly the same. 
---
With ghostface you have to constantly think strategically and be willing to give up gens to position yourself and your timing. You have to learn maps and map flow, most travelled points and areas the just give up completely. 
---
None of this applies bellow rank 8, survivors at that level just dont know what to do against him and you can just play silly.
---
If you wanna see more just look up at marth videos or by typing "depip squad" and other playlist of his. He'll show, with perks, without perks, swf, solo, how easy is to ""win''"
---
If it's not your jam, also Noob3 it's fine by looking his 30+ escapes in a row.
---
Yeah these are not stats (at least Noob3 ones) but since you don't like stats at least you can see by yourself how easy it is to escape, especially with swf
---
Ok. Thanks!
---
Happens more often than you think. A survivor will sometimes go out of their way to make it happen so that you chase them instead of someone without it wasting your time
---
Is that fucking elliot rodgers ffs
---
No offense, but rank means almost nothing
---
The shred ability may be useless but its better to just m1 in some cases, thats how it is. The survivor cant mindgame a pallet like that, so just try to keep them there, you dont even have to break the pallet as they become useless once theyre down
---
(:
---
Maybe a pink add-on, definitely not a part of his default kit
---
Is that how that works? 
---
Jesus, abilities really need to be explained more/better in the game.
---
Of course you can't. But the devs can and they should for the sake of the game longetivity.
---
And as a player, you have the choice not to be toxic and play a clean game, in the hope of reducing toxicity.
---
I love that demo looks like hes listening to some good tunes when he nods.
---
That'd be cool too. 
---
Idk, I just don't think it would be too strong but I could be wrong.
---
I mean if you ask any of the top killer mains and people that play at high rank, a ds stun may seem like that much, but it literally kills your map pressure and forces another chase which you could be spending your time on other survivors or patrolling gens rather than still chase a survivor you just downed
---
I main 3 killers, Legion, Freddy, and Ghostface (mostly this one). Honestly?   
---
I just like them.   
---
They can be fun time by time, even if they are kinda bad usually. Plus i've had complete stomps with legion. Most people expect to face a billy or spirit, they have the mindset to be ready for that. So when you see mr. Frank running at you, it can take you for a loop. Plus I always know where my prey is, something I can't say when playing someone like Pig or Clown.. Or most killers, for that matter.   
---
Plus they look cool
---
His chase music isnt the same as the survivor side sadly. Im tempted to play survivor just to get chased by him.
---
I mentioned huntress because it was actually a separate dlc, where as hag and doc are available right off, but yes you are correct about them as well.
---
Again that‚Äôs only if you spam tap it like this video does (https://youtu.be/EsFcYbWCH8U) if you just stick on the gen for 5-10 seconds to average below right before the average skill check happens you should get either a better or similar time
---
It's a 60 sec timer. It's not very long. + you can just slug if you think they have it and you keep pressure.
---
Jonathan is a chump. Nancy is way out of his league.
---
But they technically "fixed" Enduring by fixing the pallet stun timer but removing it's effects on all stuns
---
I mean if he would of face camped odds are the inevitable "only way you can get a kill" comments would be made lol
---
Yeah.  I‚Äôve played primarily survivor for a while now (Still new, only picked up the game a week or two before the Stranger Things chapter was announced), and decided I should start learning killer instead of trashing the killer daily rituals.  This was my 3rd game, the survivors had all 5 gens in barely 5 minutes and I never successfully downed a single person (and only got in like, 2-3 hits max).
---
60 seconds is a ridiculously long period of time in this game.
---
I'm definitely trying to learn maps right now and best ways to play killer, thanks for the information and maybe I'll try nurse
---
Your definition of clean game is "Play by YOUR rules"
---
No, fuck you
---
I DCed today bc i couldn't heal, wiggle or recover. All signs that you would just run past the gate in that stupid glitch. So i just left. 5k bloodpoints or spend 5 mins looking for another match
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Whats a "win"?
---
More like a universal signal
---
Idk why devs havent added a 2x times mode like this. 8 survivors, 2 killers, 10+(?) Gens. And two maps merged by the entity. (So for example, there would be a dark cloud between two big maps like Haddonfield farm and Lerys memorial insitute.)
---
That's what most people do but you're still getting robbed of a lot of pressure for a perk that has no equal. 60 seconds is arguably a lot of time that you cannot chase a survivor and they could recognize this and punish you for accidentally going for the wrong person. Since there is no way of knowing for sure who has ds and only knowing that it might be the game, 4 man with ds could easily confuse the killer and force what could be a hook trade into a free escape from the killer from everyone
---
I admit I have absolutely gotten some bullshit hits before through windows. On the other hand, sometimes I miss completely when they‚Äôre still going through. 
---
I once had somebody who was completely through a window on my screen, or so it seemed. They had to have been in like the last frame of the animation, because I was able to grab them. I really didn‚Äôt blame them for DCing.
---
Dont play her on console.. just dont
---
i have a friend and thats why she only plays survivor because of this reason.
---
Please tell me the bodyblocking homie made it out
---
I CANT PIP
---
Yeah that's very true, I don't disagree. It can be avoided though, as it was changed to assist with tunneling. Not saying you tunnel on purpose, but if you run BBQ or other aura perks you could potentially find another survivor, DS user can get saved, and by the time you've hooked your new prey you wont get stunned by your previous victim. Its avoidable.
---
Now it kinda does, before it didn‚Äôt as you‚Äôd get rewarded no matter how you play, you can literally tunnel, camp, farm, Miri everyone, as long as u get the 4K. But now they somewhat balanced it out so it kinda does mean something.
---
Nope. It's not exploiting someone else at their moment of weakness. Like when they are fresh off the hook.
---
Your attitude will be a quick way to lose the game. Case in point, up until a month ago, I never use Decisive Strike. It's a perk I ignored when it's on the blood Web. But the increase of tunneler now force me to equip it in every single survivor I have.
---
Your action has repercussion. Don't be surprise when every survivor now equip Decisive because of your decision to tunnel them.
---
OwO
---
It's really gratifying when you let a survivor go even though they're blaintly in clear view, or they turn left instead of right and they're at a dead end. You give them a quick shake and walk away. Maybe you hook them next time or maybe give them even one more freebie. In the post game chat you get GG's and the survivor you let one pass says "thx killer" is why I play to have fun rather than 4ks.
---
You died cause you didnt leave. Perfectly justified for the killer to get points for your mistakes.
---
S L U G ds has a counter. Previous ds didn't. Deal with it.
---
Yeah, DbD was released first by a wide margin, but they were both announced within a month of each other, iirc, and DbD rushed to get out first. I might be wrong, but I believe F13 was the first announced. 
---
Of course, I'm pretty sure both were beat on announcement by LY, but that's... also dead. So a  completely moot point. Shame.
---
Oof
---
3-4 kills or "escape".
---
BHVR likes to reward mediocrity, though, so you can rank up even if you lose.
---
I find it strange that a game this popular doesn't have accessibility settings. Even some smaller indie games have accessibility options from the start.
---
It doesn't, I slug everyone now
---
I win more games because less people on gens because of DS making me slug people
---
Nurse? Or spirit?
---
Killers are op guys right?
---
He does. Our stabby boi needs buffs.
---
I had no idea ! They need to fix that
---
They can just run in a locker to counter that. Then they aren't even under slug pressure. You can't just stand over people for a minute.
---
Cause chains make him kinky? Idk.
---
Nurse. Her blinks cannot be used as efficiently on console as they are on pc due to stick vs mouse.
---
Spirit is great on console! One of the 2 best. Shes easy to play, little risk with great reward
---
Slug them and move on with your life, or just ignore them for literally only 60 seconds
---
I didn‚Äôt leave because the killer chased me around and never caught me LMAO if I chose to not leave, that‚Äôs different.
---
I think her is quite balances as is. Especially when he gets hos buff in the next patch. Makes him able to destroy pallets with "Of The Abyss".
---
And that's why people bring insta heal as well now. And why BHVR just came up with new perk that hides track mark and blood of unhooked survivors.
---
Like I said, either you step up and play clean game or you'll be force out of your comfort zone of tunnelling rudely.
---
It is avoidable yes but when you start getting into later game, where time become more and more precious and the space is closer most survivors are going to be nearby avoiding bbq. But for survivors has multiple other things the killer can't counter for unhooking survivors in these instances, ds should be something that can be countered because most people are going to either force a grab ie jumping in a locker to distract you or slow vaulting a window so they can get the ds, or now running inner strength so they can get the heal and head on to get out with another stun. You're right with chasing other survivors but sometimes that's just a luxury we don't have
---
A++ material @OP

*SirPelo scream*
---
Everytime I see this bug all you do is fall off the face of the earth and suddenly you‚Äôre right next to the hatch
---
~~ohandihopeyoubroughtyoursilencedpistolsfortakingoutthecameras~~
---
I‚Äôve seen the de-pip squad and while it‚Äôs interesting, tbf most survivors aren‚Äôt going to be playing like that. Game is still definitely survivor sided by far even after multiple nerfs. Bhvr isn‚Äôt perfect but this isn‚Äôt really an easy game to balance at all, nerfing swf too hard really hurts solo survivors, and killer balance is generally terrible just due to how how the game works.
---
With a controller, camera movement is restricted. The fastest you can turn your screen is "thumbstick all the way to the side. 
---
The only way you can make it any faster than that is by increasing sensitivity, which inherently makes your motions less accurate.
---
Meanwhile, with a mouse the only limit to how fast you can turn is "how fast can I move my hand".
---
No, what they should do is bring back all enduring, cause that change was way too stupid.
---
Dang I thought I was the only one who loved that game, good memories
---
MaM, Infectious Fright, Ruin, Enduring
---
If youre feeling adventurous, replace ruin with bamboozle or spirit fury
---
Most survivors know this and are going to force a grab on them to guarantee it
---
There are smart people that exist on this planet and they make your life a living hell in this game
---
Okay? You still died and the killer fullfilled his duty by not letting you escape. Its still perfectly justified and my point still stands.
---
Holy shit
---
My friends and I tried it once. Had no idea how to actually do anything, were constantly lost, and all the other players were *screaming* into their mics. It was the only server we could get to work that wasn't Russian. I'm gonna guess this isn't the typical experience?
---
Look up builds for killers your comfortable with that helped me when I first started.
---
An official way to install free custom icons? Doubtful. Expect to be buying them at 25 Aurics per perk.
---
Wow, the Entity is an asshole.
---
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DO THAT!!
---
I like giving people escapes too, but I feel satisfaction in 4ks on toxic teams
---
The bing bing too strong don‚Äôt buff him
---
Shh, don‚Äôt want people thinking you think the devs are at least somewhat competent
---
It is frustrating to play survivor, i do sometimes with my friends but its no excuse for what they say. But just keep on keepin on. Have fun playing killer :)
---
Imma head out, night.
---
‚Äú If they made an entirely new perk to counter something that didn't exist they might be interested in fixing a perk to counter something that does. ‚Äú dude are we speaking about the same devs? The ones that reworked one map(badham, still has an insane loop) and haven‚Äôt fix the old ones... etc. I am not gonna give more examples but u understand why I doubt.
---
Are you capable of argument other than "no it's not"? I guess not.
---
Riight, because your should just like unfair scummy tactics.
---
Clean game is playing game without exploiting other players who can't defend themselves. Of course you can win easily downing a stationary object but I personally don't find that challenging or satisfactory.
---
Hmm, you're the one who told me to fuck off and yet here you are playing victim.
---
When talking about balance, we're talking about either the high or the mid ranks, as that's where the experienced players are. Balance feels different on the low ranks, as everyone has a lot to learn.
---
Wraith is a good killer to start the game with, as playing him will teach you how to deal with loops without relying on your strengths (as he doesn't have many).
---
He has some strong add-ons, but his base power is just bad. 
---
I love his style and I like his power, but he is the simplest killer in the game with the least stuff to do. I want him to get better.
---
New killers are loaded with multiple powers. Almost everyone has something they can do in a chase. Wraith can get slightly less visible (but not really) to run faster (so slightly it's unnoticeable). With some add-ons you can use his power in the chase, but you just can't with the base one.
---
Two abilities. He can use the light on his head for a certain amount of time. And the other one he throws his pickaxe. It will be a combination of Huntress and Leatherface's chainsaw. Downing whoever is in front of it but it goes horizontal instead of vertical like Huntress. And he can retrieve it from the Survivor or from a select few spots around the map. That's all I could really think of for him based off of both movies
---
I know man. It's crazy how much he looks like him. I hope it happens but I'm not getting my hopes up.
---
to quote max payne: "Things have gone from fine to fucked up in about a second."

Figure it out for yourself. I‚Äôm not teaching you, and anyone who tries to say it visibly here will be reported. This is an awareness post, not a glitch tutorial. 
---
Sorry. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I would enjoy such settings as well.
---
 I'm hearing impaired, so not deaf, but I use special "streamers" to hear games running on my PC and their biggest issue is that they do not have left/right differentiation like headphones have, so I might hear a Survivor moan in pain or their footsteps, but I'll never know where it comes from. I have to guess every time.
---
Not sure what can be done here that won't be exploited like crazy with people that can hear fine though.
---
Thanks again for the great info!
---
Gonna be the one with a wastly different opinion here, swf are still a rampant fucking issue which only the big 3 can handle, the m1's get curbstomped and that includes demo and freddy who are viable but lack pressure with the current gen speed, god forbid you play a wraith ir bubba at high ranks sooner or later you will meet them and there will be no way of winning, and it wont even be your fault. If the big 3 get nerfed then killers won't have any safe haven which understandably makes them quit cause when a competent swf hits ya there wont be any way to hit back no matter your skill level and you want to know why? Cause the gen speed is broken and everyone except the big 3 lack mobility to pressure them.
---
It counts as an escape I think.
---
Snip snip vs good boy
---
I'll tell you what. Wraith is cool. His style and look are outstanding, his playstyle is promising.
---
He's weak tho. His power is not strong enough to let you enjoy it unless you're using good add-ons.
---
While I want to enjoy playing him, I'm always asking myself "Why am I not playing X" whenever his power level doesn't let me do anything.
---
There will always be a "meta" in games, but this is a different type of game. Buffing one killer doesn't affect other killers, unless it makes survivor switch their builds, because killers don't face eachother. You can have everyone viable at the same time. There's nothing stopping that from happening.
---
good luck sir
---
New perk idea - Iron Collar
---
When stabbed by DS the collar has a 50/75/100% chance to break causing you to unleash your massive rage and Insta-mori the survivor who broke it. Can only occur once per game.
---
Yeah you're right but it would be nice to hope
---
I‚Äôm red ranks and got about 15 rank 20 survivors &amp; killers in a row earlier lmfao
---
bUt gEnRuShInG IsN'T ReAl iT'S JuSt pLaYiNg tHe gAmE!
---
Given the correct scenario, I think it's pretty helpful.
---
They just wait until you leave and then get on a gen. You either waste time standing there or they're just immune to pressure for a full minute. The perk needs some tweaks.
---
Then don't tunnel!
---
If they get unhooked and they go in a locker with 50 seconds left on DS then go for the guy right next to them who hooked them
---
What victim ? 
---
Anyway so a clean game is "playing game without exploiting other players who can't defend themselves" 
---
Players can't defend themselves, they can only run and throw pallets. That definition doesn't make much sense. 
---
Are you just saying I shouldn't hook people ? 
---
I shouldn't left click ? 
---
I have no idea what the fuck you're even trying to say
---
Monitor and Abuse(Doctor Perk), Ruin(Hag Perk), BBQ Chili(Cannibal Perk), and I like to use Bitter Murmer. This load out gives you eyes on the survivors anytime you hook them or they pop a gen. Ruin works well for a few minutes usually. 
---
I‚Äôve recently started using Enduring perk as well in place of Murmer from the Hillbilly. Helps with pallet stun. 
---
In game strategy - in EW1 I like to sneak up on survivors doing a gen and get a free hook by grabbing them straight off the gen. You‚Äôve got to stay behind walls and pop out from around the corner to get them though. Don‚Äôt just run straight at them out in the open or they will see you. Try to stay behind trees and walls. 
---
Don‚Äôt stay with survivors too long in a chase. I am guilty of this far too often. I will have a good game going my way and then get overconfident and just continue to chase a good survivor who loops me for several pallets. This quickly turns the tide over to the survivors real quick especially if they are playing together. 
---
Once you‚Äôre out of EW1 try to keep building up to EW3 as often as you can. The two addons I like the most are Judiths Journal and something else from Judith. Both are Green Rarity. One drastically increases stalk points for all survivors and the other does the same just for the Obsession. Stalk builds very slow when you don‚Äôt have one of these to start the game. 
---
The Shape is my main and I find him the most fun to play. Sometimes he can be frustrating but he is very rewarding when things fall in your favor. Just watch out for those PWF.
---
And then even when youre able to down them, they disconnect.

---
If you like hiding and don‚Äôt know how to run the killer for a decent amount of time then yeah I‚Äôd suggest it
---
Oh boo hoo, poor him.  He doesn't have to stream live.
---
He sacricifed you though. He gets the points, he stopped you from leaving so the entity could finish you off. Idk why this so hard of a concept for you to understand. Its a sacrifice nonetheless how you look at it. And im not complaining, im giving critism and counter arguments.
---
I'm not new but I play the game from time to time but yet I still get matched with people way better
---
Oh he doesn't have to goto work today and earn a living, wow
---
Snipers don't have to snipe him either but they do anyway
---
Not his fault they've come to his job and harassed him
---
It felt good to hit a Freddy with a pallet with a big hit box
---
I feel called out.
---
Scoops Ahoy Steve must always live
---
Don't act dense. 
---
We're talking about tunnelling. Especially tunnelling and camping new players, which endangers the health of the game as these players meant to bring new population to the game.
---
If both say it is broke is it actually balanced ?
---
True god tier: Playing Demogorgon with Mad Grit just to hear his slash grunt over and over.
---
Paging u/SleepyDreamsAwoken &lt;3
---
He is a sleepy boy.
---
Are you his BF or something?  LOL.  I've never seen this kind of adoration.  Almost stalkery vibe though.
---
I never get over how the horizontal slash looks exactly like Long Island.
---
It‚Äôs kinda like a less consistent self care that takes about as long, requires you to get hooked and has a picky ass prerequisite (the fucking thing doesn‚Äôt register half the time) it‚Äôs not as strong as Inner strength, reveals to the killer that you have it and isn‚Äôt worth a slot over DS or Adrenaline. You‚Äôre overestimating second wind.
---
uhh, your missing the best survivor? how could you forget about the master race himself ace. i cant believe this
---
Today I noticed some sweaty purple ranks and their pet 16 were farming the random so hard they actually pointed at him.
---
So I let him go. I don't think he understood, since he still helped do gens, and I don't think they understood, because the pet was quick to tell me I'm terrible at the game after.
---
I guess what I'm saying is, never play anything other than your best Killer with the best loadout, or you won't be able to murder anyone who farms.
---
had a person jump right on my totem after getting unhooked in my face. Was I supposed to just leave?
---
"WHERE TO FUCK IS SHE!?!? AAAAAAAAAAA"
---
Or you are a god amongst man like Otzdarva that can even win without Hex Ruin
---
Template made by u/
---
shouldn't everyone get bp if that were the case?
---
I would use this if I could/ PS4
---
I actually haven't either, I kinda want to though?
---
At this point, I feel like they should just toss EVERYONE on the lower end 5% more movespeed and see how things settle. Better than waiting for individual attention.
---
I will admit I am not really good at looping and üöÇing a killer around the map and some characters I may play as have perks I don‚Äôt particularly like so I think it may be a good idea to get it I wanted to get opinions
---
The biggest insult in the wraith "Rework" was when they removed his windstorm addons and made it base, but then added a slowdown while uncloaking effectively negating the speed increase.
---
Yeah I don't know who on their team wrote that, but clearly they don't play the game..
---
Map offering, increases chances to be sent to the Pig‚Äôs map ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù
---
And while this is true, such high camera speed isn't that much more notable in value in this game.  DbD is rarely a game that needs that much raw camera speed, especially on survivor.
---
Except a Mori is only dangerous after you've been caught and hooked where as a key you can hide until your team dies then pop the hatch to win. Mori requires a,killer to at least do 1/3 of his job where the key requires nothing. 
---
Think it should be changed to work after you've completed at least one generator. So if its hatch time and all you did was hide your sol.
---
Good groups will have the advantage regardless of killer or map.
---
bingbongbingbong
---
Pretty much. With a few exceptions (most notably Nurse), Killers can only exploit Survivor mistakes. If the Survivors don't make mistakes, the Killer's skill ceiling isn't enough to beat them.
---
What's the pigs maps?
---
No it doesn't
---
That's what the game can be, and as I mentioned theres a whole list of shit survivors do as well. That is also what the game can be!
---
Tunnel and camp on new players just means they're learning what new killers do and have something in common with other players, if they choose to leave then they weren't cut out for dead by daylight or they can try killer. 
---
If you get camped or tunneled, too fucking bad, queue again and hope for a different killer
---
Conversely let's just remove scratch marks for everyone.
---
Everyone constantly complaining about not being able to hide, this could be a solution.
---
But, no, seriously.  No one can really hide anyway. Open your arms to the color blind, BHVR. Power to gaming.
---
Nope
---
When bubba gets a 4 down that easily it honest to god gives me hope that the character will be buffed one day.
---
Wraith isnt actually that bad he is very good in chases. With his ability he is able to force survivors to waste their pallets pretty easy.
---
Yeah I like replacing it with WGLF or Dead Hard sometimes, too
---
Where‚Äôs David??
---
that would be test for me as i cant simply swap another texture on his face. ill have edit mesh especially his eyes
---
To reply to a comment about rank its kinda the only thing that matters . . .

It‚Äôs called ‚ÄúThe Game‚Äù, it‚Äôs a meat packing plant, 1 of only 3 indoor maps in the game
---
This is such a fun build to run
---
Buuuuuuuuuzzkiiiiiiill.
---
Let people have their fun and stop being so paranoid about the devs banning you.
---
Well, I meant to flair this as a Suggestion and not Shitpost/meme, but Reddit had other ideas. Oh well!

He's got a built-in Insidious, completely countered by his uncloak time. So far, he's my Killer of choice for dealing with obvious toxic SWFs I should never have been matched with because I don't need to walk all the way to a corner to hide until the nightmare is over.
---
00:24  "you fr?"

Gen rushing should depip like moring people. It's insane how 4 toolbox can end a match in less than 3 minutes
---
Ruin, haunted grounds, devour hope, and thrill of the hunt. &gt;:)

I know, his face is very special. Do you have the black suit cosmetic doctor 3D model? That‚Äôs my favorite doctor skin, even with his bloody face. If you have the model, could you send me some pictures of him? I‚Äôm just asking, it‚Äôs totally fine if you don‚Äôt have the doctor model or no time for editing. I really love your YouTube channel btw!! My fav video is Sally dancing with Philip and Hermanüíì
---
Hmm, I remember someone begging to stop the stream-sniping like BHVR can do something about it.    
---
What is it without him and this level of obsession....
---
If you main a killer, that will effect your rank; if you use Hillbilly/ Nurse you will be a higher rank than if you used Wraith/ Leatherface. Your statement is only true if you use multiple killers at the same rank, which isn't what alot of people do, people generally use a few killers that fit their playstyle, and are consistently around 1 rank. If you use good killers then switch to a bad killer you will be "shit on", not just because of the killer, but also because of your rank, and likewise, if you use bad killers, and switch to a good killer, you will do very well.
---
If you, Flint124, use Hillbilly, you will (ideally) be paired with good survivors, because you use Hillbilly, and you will "win" half of your matches. Because I use Pig I usually get paired with decent survivors, and I also "win" half my matches, despite using a worse killer.
---
The problem here isn't having a spread out teir list, but rather only having 1 killer rank. I feel a much better solution than buffing bad killers/ nerfing good killers would be to have a separte rank for every individual killer; being very good with one killer (such as Hillbilly), doesn't necessarily translate into being good with other killers (such as wraith), so if matchmaking only looked at your rank for the killer you have selected, you would be put with survivors who match how good you are with that killer, and would always "win" half your matches.
---
Why did i get downvoted for being truthful lol
---
My issue is how my Lithe procs the exhaustion after I get slapped down and didn't even get to use the perk. If I don't zoom off, I shouldn't get exhausted, plain and simple.
---
I think you got that from monto‚Äôs new video
---
No you aren't, you're bitching at me about game mechanics
---
There are ways to contact the devs and responding to me about how the game is in reality with your delusional bullshit on a comment chain in a thread with under 15 upvotes isn't going to be visible by devs
---
So don't play the "I'm asking devs" card
---
And yea you seem new, still, nothing changed about that
---
Trust me when I say there are better things for them to be working on. Every multiplayer game in the history of games and the future of all games will have something 'toxic' that mean players will abuse. 
---
Welcome to reality
---
If the game would literally die because you and many others CAN NOT FUNCTION without a grossy unfair advantage then the game deserves to die plain and simple. The fact you know the game would die because of 2 different modes is more then enough reason to call it a broken mess. Behavior wouldn't do shit about it until killers start quitting forcing them to make AI killers. Then trash players like yourself and many others will go back to League of Legends to carry on with your toxic bullshit.
---
The entity clearly gave her too much strength with all these nerfs (:
---
Well there is a speed problem with the game. Ruin itself is only a band-aid for a bigger issue with the game. I'd argue that these buffs were all necessary for the game if they don't intend to change the pace of the game.
---
Because I already know it‚Äôs going to happen anyways no matter what. And I believe in raising awareness for such huge bugs. They have claimed to have fixed it several times yet here it is. I‚Äôm openly critical of the game and devs as well.
---
Decent if you get tunneled since the hook breaks
---
And the killer for not dcing lol
---
I'd rather prioritize my totem tbh
---
I love that both of them are just idly standing there like ‚Äúuhh... what do we do..?‚Äù
---
Umm yes, did you read what this game is about when it first game out? Ever notice how the game has no "team" element? No "team" scoring? Cause when you die you die, you don't get points because your "team" is alive and kicking, you sit on your ass and wait. Hense why people hate tunneling and camping.
---
Their concept of a balanced match 8s 2 kills and 2 escapes, too bad that's not even a pip at red ranks, the devs simply balance for red ranks
---
Err, you're the one responding to me when I was talking to someone else about new survivors playing Steve being tunnelled.
---
LOL. One minute you're talking about reality and another you decide that I'm new without any proof.
---
Who's delusional here?
---

If you'd like to rewrite what you typed up there and form a coherent thought, that'd be highly appreciated, thanks.

It‚Äôs actually been a thing since 2017, not sure if it recently came back or if it‚Äôs been a thing since then
---
You
---
Well judging by how my last game as Nurse went (Leveling her up for perks and figured I may as well give her a go), this may actually be the most toxic community I've ever been a part of, and I've been part of plenty.
---
I see you've finally lost it.
---
Too much DC from playing against the Doctor?
---
Yeah, what they usually do is have three survivors with some overpowered perks for generators and toolboxes then get one person to run the killer around while they do it.
---
I‚Äôll believe you on *that* one
---
they‚Äôre all really shit and online gaming is 9 times out of 10 just about making someone else feel like shit and griefing them
---
Definitely a bug on Their part, try validating Your files, also try reinstalling if it doesn't really work, and if it STILL doesn't work, try submitting a bug report.
---
Seems NOED wasn't a factor since it didn't pop up at the end.
---
r/mypeopleneedme
---
I had a Rank 15 go against my Catharsis Hag, a build aptly named because it's absolutely wonderful stress relief, but HOLY SHIT IS IT TOXIC. Pretty sure I just killed the game for them. Whoops.
---
What? No.
---
Eh, you're the one who stick your nose up his butt and beg like a virgin wanting to be deflowered by him.
---
So this is why they keep nerfing the pig
---
I dont see how, you probably didnt get it because for killers it goes off the emblem system and staying near hooked survivors reduces it by a decent amount.
---
Im looking at it from both viewpoints and your  point makes no sense or "your opinion" makes no sense. Your argument is: "Killer should not get points cuz the killer didnt catch you, the entity did." Which makes no fucken sense, cause techically, the killer never kills you, the entity does. (Unless the killer has a mori)
---
I‚Äôve came to worse
---
Idk why but it feels like this community is extra toxic. Some of the shit I experience in DbD honestly compares to old CoD lobbies back when it was still "acceptable" (not really, but people still did it without any punishment whatsoever) to call people n\*\*\*\*\*rs and tell them to kill themselves. Most of gaming has grown past this shit but DBD just feels stuck in the past or something. It's honestly the most toxic gaming community I've been in in the modern day by kind of a long shot.
---
Yeah I wish it was better but these are 4chan losers who are so unhappy with their own lives that they take it out on people digitally without consequence :/

They just want you to play a strong game and not take skilless shortcuts.  Again you keep comparing the two sides.  Unfortunately survivors is easier.  I've done most of the adepts for both sides.  I don't mind the requirement of the double pip.  If you play aggressively, pressure gens and don't camp hooks a double pip is far from 80 hoops.
---
I don‚Äôt get it.
---
What a jerk, I'm a red rank and I love getting in games with lvl 20 baby dwight's that I get to have fun trying to save
---
Every killer is viable, just not at the same ranks. I main Pig, which is (partly) why I am rank 10, and I never feel like she is underpowered, unless I face high ranking survivors.
---
Why dont they just make it 4 sacrifices then? Should be easy enough to make a feature.
---
Are you... Visually challenged or something? I originally responded to Henry _Andersen when you decide to just interject.
---
Oh wow highly upvoted memes. You're the big guy on the Web with 1000 hours of dbd tunnelling. Lol. Some real achievements
---
*‚ÄùKillers aren‚Äôt allowed to have fun or play ways I don‚Äôt like.‚Äù*
---
I do stuff like this all the time as Killer. Granted I‚Äôm not dumb enough to fuck up as bad as the Pig in the video did, but sometimes it‚Äôs fun to just screw around and sike Survivors out.
---
When you‚Äôve played Killer long enough, you‚Äôre like a cat chasing mice. You get a little bored so you start purposefully losing or letting them go to chase them some more.
---
She did let him wiggle out and get points for opening the gate, which is a pretty good amount. It‚Äôs not like she just let him crawl around for the whole timer or bleed out.
---
Ah yes
---
Be stealthy by being so loud, they can‚Äôt distinguish your noises and the noises made by the loud thing
---
It‚Äôs big brain time
---
Is this guy a nancy main?
---
There's a few maps where the killer has a reasonable chance and a good Nurse can beat any group. I'm not saying Nurse is balanced though, moreso that the game itself is in an annoying point where it's only balanced if all 5 players want everyone to have fun.
---
Yes
---
What does it mean to farm someone
---
The trapped had begun to swing. You can see the *swish* in the air.
---
Depends on the survivor I am not new new to the game I do have a lv 36 Dwight lv 15 ash and like a twenty off Claudette, but the perks I have with ash are not my favorite, and when I do get tunneled a bit sometimes so I think to have it as a 3rd or 4th perk may be useful
---
That last kill is the difference between a single and a double pip. Not that I think hatch should be changed, just a note on why killers care about 4k‚Äôs
---
Because facecamps count as sacrifices.  Devs don't want people earning achievements for skilless playstyles again why the double pip was the requirement.  If anything they should just change it to double pip for the survivor side too to make it more even and challenging.
---
Every game has been some poor rank 18 killer with 2 perks against a swf. 
---
I feel awful every time i get a newbie. But i did get a couple of my adepts done.
---
Another matchmaking post
---
Why are you booing him? He‚Äôs right
---
I see you are a man of shirtless culture aswell
---
It is completely broken rn
---
yeah you can hide the chat but there really should be a way to disable it completely. sometimes i just want to play the game and not be berated for mistakes or playing well.
---
Facecamps count as sacrifices, but how would a face camper get a 4k if the survivors are at all competent and realize they could just punish him by finishing every gen in the duration it takes for one sacrifice?
---
Bye safety pip

Yea Ik

---
I have my wholesome moments with other players which really keep me going but yeah a lot of the time, people get salty. I get it memes like the "survivors rulebook for killers" where I think survivors shouldn't get mad at a killer for doing his job. On the other hand, you have many players who abuse broken mechanics to win. Combine this to get a toxic community who hate the other team for using broken tactics while also using broken tactics themselves.
---
Where the fook is David?
---
&gt;It is completely broken rn
---
I don't see how posting a screenshot about it every 2 minutes is going to make anything change faster, specially since devs already made a post acknowledging it.
---
At potato ranks none of the survivors are competent.  Camping is effective up there which would make getting their achievement easier.  Survivors don't start to really punish camping until they rank up a bit.
---
Tell that to the devs, I am just paraphrasing what they said on stream.
---
I just noticed that you aren't even having a proper discussion anymore now you're just attempting to personally insult me to make you seem more authentic or feel better

Since you're done defending yourself thus admitting defeat, I shall take my leave.

Bye now, feel free to get your last insult in since I'm done responding to your personal attacks now

Eh, I figure it happens. Plus I went on to massacre the next group with my own extremely toxic build which I won‚Äôt share due to it not needing to proliferate further, so I‚Äôm not innocent here either. Shame for them, too. I probably would have had a fun game were I not in such an ungodly foul mood.
---
High rank = small pp
---
bad roast cuz matchmaking sucks
---
And YOU get a mori! 
---
EVERYONE GETS A MORI!!!!!
---
&gt;"Every killer is viable, just not at the same ranks."  
---
Yeah, that means they **aren't actually viable**. You *have to* compare them in the same rank, which is usually mid-high ranks, because that's where game balance truly matters.  
---
Comparing a Red Rank Spirit to a Green Rank Wraith or a Yellow Rank Leatherface is a pretty fuckin' stupid thing to do, and nobody's gonna take your argument seriously.
---
How about killers and survivors getting more points for playing against higher ranks and swfs? Since it's harder to chase and/or kill them you should be rewarded if you do so
---
They may not be safe, but overall the pallets are close together and in dumb spots.
---
a rebalancing of the main game and/or perks already available need to happen for 5 perk slots to become a reality. i'm more in love with the idea i saw once before of teachables being boosted for the character/killer they originate from, like a tier-4 wake-up granting 20% speed for quentin, but all other survivors cap at tier-3's 15%.
---
I definitely plan on picking up Ghostface, I'm hoping the licensed DLC will be on sale (on Xbox) during Halloween.  He's to me the most annoying killer to play against, so I hope I can get a better feel for his abilities by playing a few matches as him.  I just picked up the Plague mainly because some Jane Romero perks interest me.  Bummer to have it confirmed no killers like playing Clown, but it could still be fun for me since I don't take killer so seriously so far.  I still think it's remarkable I haven't faced him once, so he's probably a good candidate for a tweak to make him more viable.
---
So you went on and made the cycle worse? .-.
---
It's actually a pretty gross system. Some GAMEPLAY is outright paywalled, which is awful in a game you pay to play at all, and then the stuff you CAN earn takes about a month and a half of gameplay per character.
---
The system is also (inconsistent) shards/XP and XP comes from time and first plays (with so little from emblems that it's more of an insult than anything), and the XP tapers off around 10 minutes. This means Killers are punished, dying as survivor has no downside, at no point is playing well rewarded, and AFKing is a viable strategy to grind.
---
Is it specific to Nancy or were you just giving an example?
---
Everything is so balanced that it's imbalanced. Too many things counter other things to the point that one side can be so efficiently countered that they struggle to gain an advantage without resorting to dirty plays.
---
Had a game where everyone bought in a toolbox but strangely no gens done at all
---
After the match, i found out they were all rank 20s, brown toolboxes and and i just 4K'd their hopes and dreams...
---
To you new Dwight fellas, im sorry...
---
I saw this a few days ago and finally found it again, I‚Äôm just commenting so I can message you in a few weeks about possibly buying one.
---
Yeah, then again I cannot be accused of being smart while angry as hell at everything. Or when not angry at everything. Actually, I‚Äôm just not a smart person in general.
---
The ranking system has always been retarted and stupid in this game
---
I'd rather a point based perk system
---
12 points available, and perks like DS, adrenaline, NOED, Ruin, etc are worth 3 points, while less used perks are worth 1-2 points
---
If your killer is weak enough they can end chase on one survivor "just abandon chase and look for another one" isn't a solution.
---
If one survivor can loop you for three gens, there's nothing stopping another from doing the exact same thing, and you **cannot** rely on there being 1-2 trash survivors to abuse in each round.
---
It would be cool to see an adept mode, where no one can run perks that aren't adept to their killer/survivor. Would be interesting, but I know this would just divide up the player base.
---
How did you make the art on this?  
---
Like each add on, his perks, and his power's art?   
---
Did you take the time to make each one by hand, closely watching the small details to be as accurate to the art style? Or is there a website that lets people make art pieces for their OC characters?
---
Yeah, I don't understand what goes on in this Reddit sometimes.  I don't know if it's optimistic ("they'll grow out of it") or pessmistic ("holy shit, kids act this way?") to chalk it up to age.  But people love complaining and humiliating other people, including the devs when we all know none of us could make a game this compelling, competitive, and fun.  This thread is a good example:  it shows a bully being put in his place, but so many of the comments are like "that absolute piece of shit has a point tho, don't he?"  
---
I love that on console I don't really have to engage with anyone.
---
Rank system be like:
---
-Ah yes, a full rank 4-1 swf with everyone having over 1k hours. A rank 19 killer with just over 30 hours will be a perfect match
---
Cosmetics get pretty steep, though, and there are plenty of AC only cosmetics. Though I wouldn't mind if nearly ALL top cosmetics were AC only if it meant licensed characters could be bought with shards.
---
That does make sense.  And I do like the sound of that logic.
---
That is also an issue, though.
---
I always look at these video titles like that is a lot of hours how is that possible. But I realized this is one about DBD and I'm well over a thousand hours, and I'm like how is that even possible o_O

A massively acclaimed TV show that has won awards objectively sucks? Do you know what objectively means?

This is one of my favorite DBD memes I‚Äôve ever seen, I loved this scene in S3 lmao

Put all the survivors queuing for a match in a pool and sort them by tiers.  Maybe Levels 20 - 15 are Tier 4, 14-10 are Tier 3, 9-5 are Tier 2, and 4-1 are Tier 1.  Same with killers.  Ideally, you'd match killers and survivors who are all part of the same tier, thereby keeping people of approximately similar skill level together.  Survive With Friends groups are wildcards, so I'd say calculate an average level based on all players in the group and slot them in the appropriate tier.  Then I would provide two options on joining a match.  A 'Quick' option, which will pair you with any tier killer that's available to join, or a 'Rank' option, which will look for an appropriate tier killer to join, which may take longer to find.  Killers would also have these options so that both them and survivors know what kind of match they're queuing up for.
---
Not really sure if this is even a good solution, just something I had thought about.
---
The only parts I truly enjoyed in s2 and 3 was when Dustin or Steve were being shown
---
how can a killer tell a survivor is being annoying? like bring a flashlight?
---
Anyone saying Friday is better hasn't looked at steancharts. About 80 players on average for Friday. I think around 20,000 for dbd? 
---
Ironically Friday still sold amazing. But nobody is playing it anymore
---
Builds can't be toxic

If I may because I love making perks and stuff:
---
Power: Fit in
---
They know who he is, just not what he looks like. Living in infamy under a shroud of mystery. 
---
At any given time, he can disguise himself as a character model that‚Äôs not being used in game. You can still work on things with survivors, however:
---
* you cannot attack then
---
*you cannot vault
---
etc.
---
If while disguised you work on something, effects will occur to slow down what you worked on.
---
* if you work on a generator, it takes 10% longer to complete
---
*if you try to heal somebody, they have to succeed constant, difficult skill checks to escape from you. If they fail at least two, they immediately get downed.
---
*if you cleanse a totem, it is moved to a new totem and the one you cleansed is destroyed
---
You can only change in lockers.
---
Then addons would do things like increase gen time, difficulty, and reduce time to get out of transform
---
Perks:
---
Invisible: They‚Äôve never caught him yet, so why stop now? After losing a chase, terror radius and bloodstain is reduced by 50%/75%/90%
---
Hidden in plain sight:  He‚Äôs always been among the people which will soon be murdered. Every time you hook a survivor, receive a token. Whenever you‚Äôre in a chase, you can hit the secondary action button to reduce red stain by 50/50/75%. You can receive a maximum of 2/3/4 tokens.
---
Sadistic yet busy: Take time for the horrible things. Whenever you are in a chase and the survivor leads you within 20/30/45 meters of a hooked survivor, your speed is increased by 10/15/25%. This does not pertain if you start the chase within 45 meters of the survivor
---
Two killers? Two survivors? Would be an ambitious DLC but after Stranger Things with two survivors, they might keep aiming higher.

Says the game devs who made a tweet like 4 days ago about how there's been "rank discrepancies" and they're "trying to fix them"
---
&gt;Well there is a speed problem with the game. Ruin itself is only a band-aid for a bigger issue with the game. I'd argue that these buffs were all necessary if they don't intend to change the pace of the game.
---
Adding Mangled to Sloppy Butcher in addition to the healing nerf was a mistake, it backfired so hard and it made things worse. Now they don't know how to fix this and keep adding gen slowing perks, creating an overall painfully boring experience for survivors. 
---
Their goal with the healing nerf was to make survivors take longer to heal, giving killers more time to apply pressure. What happened was survivors stopped healing entirely. Why would you self-care for 40s against mangled if you could progress half a generator with the same amount of time?
---
If before they used to spend 12s to 24s to heal, now they don't spend any second and just power through generators to activate Adrenaline or to start healing when the gates have been powered and the pressure is really low.
---
If you want to play 2 of 3 strongest killers in the game (PC), you don't need a single DLC. Most of meta survivor perks are in the base game.
---

---
Hate her because it‚Äôs always a juke thing
---
And precise movement isn't needed either given that hitboxes and latency all render microplays redundant because you can Lithe a wall perfectly and still get chainsawed through 10 feet of air.
---
How can someone be annoying in the lobby?
---
Which is a completely fair complaint.  For instance:  Ruin, technically balanced, makes every game vs any killer FAR more annoying and grating than any other perk can logically do because it can turn games vs Nurse and Billy into low BP turnout 5 gens not done games with ease while being a basic necessity for other killers like Trapper where you can 3 to 4 gens pop before ever really downing someone.
---
Nurse, technically balanced, completely ignores all loops and survivor exhaustion skills with her power with enough skill.
---
I have a hard time naming survivor perks that are actually annoying to fight against as the only thing that comes to my mind is instaheals but those are one and done things where as the killer annoying things can be abused multiple times and in multiple ways.  Maybe you can argue that Adrenaline is annoying but then that goes back to how annoying things like Ruin are and can prevent Adrenaline from popping to NOED.

If any things need direct looks at it would be Ruin, Nurse and Billy in small ways and / or in integrating how they work into the game such as making Ruin's slower gen progress tied to killer and change how the perk functions to compensate as killers like Trapper and Clown who are pretty damn slow with low map presence should honestly have slower gen progress than Nurse and Billy who can get across the map with their default powers in record time.  The only things I would do to Nurse and Billy is make longer charge times have distinctly harder stuns the further you go so using them in short spans is better than long ones although every Billy I ever see just revs up and walks into you to guarantee downs which is such annoying bullshit I can't even think straight.
---
Clown or hag
---
Clown is just annoying with his bottles and when the camera snaps you towards one of hags traps it's so frustrating.

R6:Siege is way worse. People will deadass vote you out of the team if youre not pro as fuck. That beats DBD by a landslide.
---
I know several people who say they'd drop DbD if there'd be no/way less grind.
---
Many people said Deathgarden's main flaw on first release was a lack of grind. "Why would I play DG if there's nothing to unlock/upgrade?"
---
I don't like the grind as a main motivation to play a game. But it looks like I'm the minority these days.

This is pre-rework Freddy entering the Yamaoka house.
---
Nope now they said sometime in fall
---
Gonna have to agree and say hag. Though I‚Äôll admit, the hags that I‚Äôve played against are all pretty good for the most part so they‚Äôre doing their job right lmao.
---
I just got backed to rank 18 and I still been getting reds with a rank 20 killer
---
Being able to quickly cloak and uncloak with speed boost is fucking annoying and strong as hell once you learn how to do it right.  Him and Clown are both pretty damn "Weak" killers but I find them hell and a half to play against as you basically require A exhaustion perk that gives you an escape because otherwise they'll wittle you down quick.
---
Also, being able to body block basically all the time is fucking GREAT and is cancer on certain totem positions.
---
;-;
---
I dunno as I decided to main ash today. Are any of his perks good..? I‚Äôm having trouble putting them to use
---
When they can make you feel actively guilty for using them and are busted as Hell, I considered that toxic.
---
That tweet isn't aging well with how trash the matchmaking is rn
---
My sides hurt from laughing too hard at this. Good job.
---
No one cares wether you‚Äôre here for the stranger things dlc or not. Just play the game as whoever you want
---
https://youtu.be/DdaMN87lcb4
---
I've gotten this millions of times....they should really fix it
---
You sure it was hate-camping? He might‚Äôve just been trying to confirm the match ended with at least one kill. New players don‚Äôt pick up that camping hurts their rank and stuff. 
---
That was some good surviving, regardless.
---
No one will care why you are playing the game. The best killer is Leatherface and the best perks to use on him are Territorial Imperative,  Monstrous Shrine, Hangman‚Äôs Trick, and Unrelenting.
---
The clip was too long, could last 5 seconds tbh. Still, good meme lol
---
&gt;Maybe If it didn't happen all the time there wouldn't be so many posts about it
---
What is the point of so many points about it the devs already said they are working on it? Do you think they code faster according to how many posts we get per minute?
---
$70? We‚Äôre you going to buy all of them?
---
Ruin wouldnt stack, it would just affect one end of the map since its essentially 2 maps. If both of the killers run ruin, both sides have their Ruin. Survivors could be reduced to 7-6 tbh for balancing buuuut..... idk. Perks which buff killers affect only the killer which has said perk. Perks like Cruel Limits COULD affect all of the map/ map side but its just an idea.
---
I've noticed bullying only happens in the purple and red ranks. Due to the horrible matchmaking going on right now, I've played against plenty. In currently in the yellow ranks and every game I'm outranked they play so rudely. Constantly taunting and being unsportsmanlike. Strangely, most of these matches they apologize for their actions due to how outranked I was during the match but I've had a few be really toxic even in endgame chat. I've never understood why they act like this. It takes a lot of grinding to reach higher ranks but that's no excuse for poor manners.
---
Make that 7 bois and grills
---
Why did they nerf the pig? She has been my main the entire time I've been playing dbd but now it just feels like my control over the survivors with rbts isn't as total as it was when i first started playing (Early 2018)
---
Doesn't have to be 2 survivors? could just be a killer bundle and then that would make it even with the survivor roster.
---
Nurse is the best killer by far on PC, but I feel like she's mid tier at best on console.  There's gotta be something to that.  I'm not sure if it's because of the M&amp;KB or the frames per second that PC gets, but the best Nurse I've ever played on console (as a rank 3/4 survivor) is still not nearly as good as the best of other killers I've played. $0.02
---
You can change your settings so it prevents users that are not friends from messaging you
---
As a ghostface this makes me happy
---
You obviously cared enough to respond sooo.....
---
Also, I was saying that it doesn't sort people by skill, but rather by how good they are with the powers, perks, and items they are using. Which is why you should have different ranks for different powers, rather than just having 1 killer rank.
---
He wasnt talking about a perk btw
---
the most precious bill
---
Cheers for the credit :)
---
I don't see the problem with myc and a mori. They made their choice.
---
They said they were working on a freddy rework and that took them 2 fucking years and a mountain of memes. With these devs, people need to keep posting or they assume we've forgotten.

I mainly have played as a killer. While most people have been chill, I did encounter a few trolls and a few nasty comments in chat.
---
I have a unique situation and while there are many games that work similarly, controlling the camera and my camera movement at the same time to catch a survivor just isn't working. It's the being fast that I can't do.
---
I was thinking it would be better for me if there was a "lock on" feature when in pursuit of a survivor, but that might make the game too easy for everyone else.

Could you please fix the matchmaking then so that I am not matched up with rank 19s and 20s when I am rank 5? Honestly, all this toxicity and that twitter post is probably due to sheer frustration at how broken matchmaking is right now.
---
This entire post aged so poorly.
---
I believe it's always been there also voice kinda sounds a little different from when I heard it
---
Why are you complaining? Skeleton keys are highly unusual to see anyway and if they escape "oh well, ill rank up next time" also how to you nerf a key?
---
i'm so happy i moved from console to pc. my grind is completely reset, but the bloodweb changes should help get me moving faster :)

Don't listen to him, he's trying to turn you into a basement camper. Check out some youtube videos.

Had a game yesterday where I managed to get 2.5 gens done, then got hooked by a Michael then my game froze only thing moving was a player in the lower right hand corner running in place before the game said I and the killer disconnected whilst two survivors escaped. Mind you it also said I gained no points the whole match. I was beyond pissed that I just shut the game off afterwards.
---
Seriously, this entire post is cringe and aged poorly.
---
Yes, I usually bring one of Monto's ‚Ñ¢  Toxic builds that I have always prepared for this scenario.
---
Literally had that happen yesterday, it was so annoying that I bought spirit and 4k'd twice with just Sloppy Butcher I.
---
If only there were more people actually playing Demo
---
They could make them short (5 second) interactions that become available with end game collapse, maybe even require an escape to keep them.
---
If the killer wants more hope to feast on, he should rank the killer up to face tougher survivors so they last longer.  The reward for a longer game is already given through bloodpoints.
---
Nice, I haven‚Äôt played Freddy since pre buff. I haven‚Äôt heard any complaints either, so is he good now?
---
Well done its better than anything i can produce thats for sure
---
I love these kind of details. reminds me of the zero that pops up on your screen in borderlands when you get a melee kill as him. such a small things but its those touches that makes characters feel truly unique
---
Head on is so fucking annoying to deal with.
---
I mean surge was always kinda shitty I don't think it could ever live up to PGTW,Tremors or even ruin even if they revert back to how it was in the announcement video. (Please buff the other gen perks though I don't wanna run ruin every single match)
---
Fair point.
---
WAIT WHAT. I LET SURVIVORS WIGGLE OFF SO I CAN TOY WITH THEM AND KILL THEM WITH THE ENTITY WHAT THE FUCK
---
Currently trying to lvl 50 him
---
I‚Äôve had 4k depip happen to me multiple times.  You‚Äôre just plain wrong
---
I don't know if you can snoop into any log the game generates, that would be the best way to do it. But that most likely isn't possible, if thats the case you would most likely look into the game's memory because packets aren't reliable at all to tell that.
---
That's what I'm talking about, just saw Otzdarva playing him yesterday, he was chasing a David in the dram world with 8 stacks of stbfl, one hit on the David, he goes for the rescue, another hit on him and 2 seconds later the unhooked guy is down, madly strong
---
The question could be interpreted that way though...
---
Doesn't particularly sound like a survivor main to me. Billy is S-tier on most people's lists I've seen. He's almost certainly the #1 killer on console, and he's no worse on PC, just Nurse is better there.
---
Nice one
---
I think the Wraith is fine as of now. Though he's not the strongest, he is amazing at getting first hits which usually cuts a chase in half which is already a big help, especially if you have something like bone clapper, an uncommon perk, and the one that suppresses your terror radius, a common perk.
---
I was playing (at least trying to) yesterday DbD for about 3h. Me and my 2 friends, all of us 10 rank after rank reset. And what ranks we got? 20. All. The. Time. That one survivour AND KILLER. 20 rank!!! Ofc rushgen was terrible fast and we were always escaping but WTF? We got like 3 disconnects because killer couldn't do anything against us. That was really sad. Thats why new players won't want to play anymore, because they are getting too high ranks. Idk what happend after that new patch but devs need to fix it.
---
(Sorry for bad English, not my main language ;_;)
---
:O Adam!
---
Yup, still stuck in the match lol.
---
Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d833ni/has_anyone_else_had_this_glitch_ps4/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
&gt;"Do you feel the same way about survivors."  
---
Irrelevant. Here's why:  
---
Survivors as characters are all identical, with the only difference being their character models and their voices. Their hit-boxes are all the same. The only tactical advantage you might get when playing a certain survivor is that some survivors are *a little* less loud than others.  
---
&gt;"There are very few perks, and items that can be used at high ranks for survivors, but that doesn't mean that maps, dark sense, or iron grasp should be buffed."  
---
1. Buffing maps won't change much of the game's meta. Maps provide information that experienced players don't need. The *only* thing experienced survivors use a map for the Map+Key combination, which requires at least one SWF buddy.  
---
2. Dark Sense already got buffed. It is now in a pretty good spot. The only issue with it is that its effects aren't something most experienced survivors are looking for, but that's a given with situational perks.  
---
3. Iron Grasp doesn't need a buff anyway. The -75% struggling effects is enough to make it a worthwhile perk for certain builds, like the Fruit Ninja build (naming credit goes to HybridPanda). Once again, it's a situational perks.  
---
&gt;"I get that the difference between killers is a bigger deal than the difference between perks, or items. But I feel like if you are going to aim for being high rank you should expect to not be able to use certain killers[...]"  
---
So you should be punished by the game for wanting to be good at a killer whom you also find fun to play? Everyone in the high ranks should be bored out of their fucking minds because the game said "fuck you" to anyone who doesn't enjoy playing Billy, Spirit or Nurse?  
---
Here's the biggest difference between killers and perks. Perks can be situational, and that's okay. Killers should be able to *make those situations happen*. If they cannot do that, what's the point of even trying to use said perks on said killers? If a killer is only viable while using certain add-ons or certain perks, the killer in question isn't actually viable, and that's a problem.  
---
I'm gonna finish this discussion by repeating what u/Oicmorez said, because they made an extremely good argument, completely eliminating any excuse the developers might have had for letting under-powered killers remain under-powered.  
---
&gt;"There will always be a "meta" in games, but this is a different type of game. Buffing one killer doesn't affect other killers, unless it makes survivor switch their builds, because killers don't face eachother. You can have everyone viable at the same time. There's nothing stopping that from happening."

I think it‚Äôs good in combination with Quick &amp; Quiet and Head On, saved me in many chases because it‚Äôs actually pretty fast in tier 3.

---
The duality of man
---
EAC prevent game memory from being read at all so either you would have to bypass it, MITM the network, or just read the screen. Reading the screen sounds like the best solution as well, although getting character would be harder than getting the number of gens left.
---
R8 my survivor build.  No mither, pharmacy, self care, deja vu
---
You have to keep in mind it‚Äôs supposed to be a fair and evenly matched game. Just because tougher people are there it doesn‚Äôt mean better gameplay
---
Love your works man
---
Deja vu is useful unless you really know what you're doing
---
we are doomed bdb doesn't even know about how broken matchmaking is ü§£
---
Yea, but that still makes Wraith only viable in the bottom unless he's using good add-ons.
---
I want to be able to pick him up spontaneously and at least have some fun with him no matter what rank I'm at.
---
You don't need to win to have fun, but getting rekt isn't really fun
---
The biggest problem with his power is that it doesn't do enough on its own.
---
It's not good enough for walking around the map, because the speed increase is too small, unless you're running Windstorm add-ons
---
It's not good enough for stealth, cuz you can be seen across the map anyway, bing bonging is loud, and uncloaking takes too much time. His add-ons change that tho (Silent/loud clapper, 6 seconds of stealth after uncloak, faster uncloaking)
---
It's not good enough to use in chase, because uncloaking takes so long, speed increase is not great enough and the payoff is not worth the cost. Can also be "fixed" with add-ons.
---
While on one hand I like that his add-ons actually mean something (which doesn't apply to many killers), but having a power that's bad at everything and has to be enhanced with add-ons to be usable at all isn't very good.
---
I have a few ideas how he could get buffed in all three areas, but that's a bit much of a change and I'm not sure about the balance of it.
---
I'd increase his cloaked movement speed a bit, to make it better for walking around the map and patrolling gens
---
I'd also make it so he's totally invisible when over 32m away from you and is cloaked (similar to what Freddy has).
---
and the last one might be a bit too strong, but it sounds fun. I'd make it so if you cancel the cloaking (during the chase, hold M2 for a moment without fully cloaking), you get a slight speed-boost, similar to what you get for uncloaking, based on how much the cloaking was charged before canceling it (and slightly reduce his movement speed when cloaking to compensate)
---
The first two would be enough for me to play more of him
---
What about of you had a generic killer rank, and individual killer ranks, and matchmaking took an average of the two. So if you have never played ghostface, but are rank 8 killer you would be put with rank 14 survivors?
---
Wraith main reporting in
---
Decoy is one of the most fun abilities I've ever used in a game

Well, I can't draw like this. Looks awesome

Don't even get me started to the vacuum pallets

Why is Steve both hugging Nancy and being K.O.'d in the background
---
You forgot to put ¬´¬†Elite SWF &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Anything Else¬†¬ª (Watch Depip Squad if you want proof, perfect survivors beat even the most perfect nurse there is)
---
Spirit Nurse and Trapper
---
Surge should regress the farthest worked on gens from the killer
---
I really like the game but not the community. All I can see on the community page is lots of people being so angry for no reason, or on small thing basically that make me goes ‚Äúreally?‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs good thing I have tough skin to the comments after the game as I‚Äôd just laugh at their petty comments.
---
You right.  Ill switch it for solidarity
---
Yeah that is why I said AC might be an issue, packet tracking would be really hard to do and I don't think it would be reliable. Screen reading should be easy to do but I don't think anyone would be willing to run a program to have rich discord if it reads your entire screen, maybe open source but even then...
---
Spirit and Legion, for Spirit the problem is the lack of counters you have against her and that its always guessing game she is phasing our not, Legion they're just painfully boring and uninteresting to go while killer like trapper may still be simple but atleast traps can block off loops and stuff while Legions just stab with ability then m1 you or just m1 from the start
---
I made a set of icons from JoJo's, you can just check my post history for link they're the 2nd most recent if you're interested.
---
I'll second this. Recently started playing PC from console. Killer on mnk feels so much more smooth but when I play survivor I plug the controller in. Turning the camera to look behind and then juke from that angle just feels way more fluid on controller.
---
Bhvr*
---
there are mirrors on lery's. and they're super fucked up.
---
The mirrors in lerys show the back of your head when facing it lol.
---
That's a long and solid breakdown. Thanks for quoting me
---
Well the quote on the Cypress Mori is literally "You did well. The last one is yours."
---
Many people enjoyed them for the variety they added.
---
The other "events" were just the same game we always play.
---
I like it. Really captures the fear and confusion in Dweet‚Äôs face.
---
Did you break that totem? Was it Ruin or HG?
---
A good nurse can‚Äôt beat any group. Watch Depip Squad, they are a team of nearly perfect survivors, and they consistently (over 80% of the time) escape full team against Nurse with Ebony Mori, sometimes even denying the nurses any hooks.
---
I drew a much better expression the first time around, this was my second attempt
---
Work? We both saw it on steam and took a screenshot
---
I have seen this at least twice with Nancy, but I think it could be done with any character with the same outfit and if you are not paying attention to the name of the one that you are chasing at the moment.
---
Ruin, Whispers, Noed, Sloppy Butcher.
---
Usually get a 4K or 3k but I think that‚Äôs mostly due to my playstyle since perk selection could be better but I‚Äôm new to pc so I don‚Äôt have many teachables yet.
---
The stranger things one
---
Cringe thumbnail
---
NiüÖ±üÖ±a the depip squad was done pre-exhaustion nerf, when maps had more pallets and pallet vacuum existed, and a good omegablink Nurse with the current perks available in the game will never lose.
---
Whenever I get tilted or am going against SWF, I switch to Spirit.
---
That should tell you something about the state of her, right?
---
It's an ok perk but I would get iron will if you haven't already got Jake's perks unlocked. It's alot more useful than breakdown
---
I meaaan have you played the game? I personaly. Think the concept is better and more optimized than dbd but it suicided due to not being able to opt into playing the killer whenever you wanted. That and the one life system
---
Do you have a clip of it happening? I‚Äôm having a hard time visualizing from your perspective since I‚Äôm a killer main
---
&gt;creating an overall painfully boring experience for survivors. 
---
How so? How survivors play the game has only changed slightly, and a lot of those changes were arguably in their favor. Again theses buffs to killers are necessary and they are going to have to keep buffing killer perks that affect the pace of the game if they have no intent to overhauling the base pace of the game. I believe whatever changes that must happen will most likely be fought by survivor mains every inch of the way.
---
&gt;What happened was survivors stopped healing entirely.
---
For a little while, yeah. Then survivors adapted to the changes and they are still healing or insta-healing on top of it. The speed of self healing is fine right now and it's in a good spot for the time being. I just hope the devs will do something about gens. After all Surge is mostly beneficial for M1 killers, same goes for Sloppy.
---
Probably cuz you have too many teachables
---
Not all heroes wear capes
---
Just slug the second to last guy and find the last one or hatch
---
Honestly as someone who plays both (going back and forth between maining killer and survivor every few months) it 100% feels like Killer is FAR more consistent and I get hit with less bullshit BUT is a tad harder. Survivor feels a bit easier like 70% of the time with a few exceptions BUT I feel like I'm constantly getting fucked by the game and not necessarily me playing bad. Also all of the bandaid fixes bHVR has been doing have really started to get on my nerves. I know they want NOED to stay the same and they made Inner Strength because of it but in all actuality NOED is just poorly designed. Gens need to take longer so that games take longer but slowing down everything else survivors have to do without giving them any type of advantage for it (ie. longer time on hooks) is also pretty bullshit. With loops it feels like bHVR just either makes a map so bad that as a survivor you want to DC on it (Unless you have BL which is a MASSIVE problem in itself with a lot of loops) or as killer maps with such safe pallets that you just have to give up and waste all momentum. bHVR just needs to do a massive rework on a lot of things when it comes to balance and I think they just can't feasible fit the time in to do it
---
Is there like a written guide for your kind of trolls? I swear I've seen this exact same routine so many times. "Are you X's Y?" "[Reassurance] but [implied embarrassment]", but that last one was slightly new. Harkens back to 2007 xbox live. Not many trolls bother with that because it dates them back to that.
---
OOOOOH
---
i mean some people‚Äôs connection is literal garbage. I had really, really poor internet at one point and it wouldn‚Äôt let me play as killer; I don‚Äôt think it should have to be as bad as I had it for it to be a problem though, it should be a problem once 80% of the people joining their lobbies have 300+ ping. Sometimes that‚Äôs the survivors connection though. i was thinking it was a potential lag switch, but I didn‚Äôt wanna accuse lmao
---
That's usually to tell people to ready up though
---
Matchmaking is absolute garbage so that rank doesnt even matter at the moment
---
However that person is equally bad. Just shows how toxic half of the community is. Telling people not to buy the game because they'd be bad is an absolute joke
---
it's because she's p3
---
Ruin is frustrating as a killer as well. Any hex perk is tbh. Its far better but it still hurts to lose a perk without getting real use out of it.
---
As for annoying survivor things, insta meds should definitely be there, adrenaline. Balanced landing is frustrating sometimes because it might generate an "infinite" loop but its also frustrating as a survivor when you get in some maps that you can only proc it in a couple of bad spots. OoO is also annoying as fuck specially to some killers and in SWF.
---
That being said most things annoying in this game comes from playstyles, basically camping, tunneling, scummy players, etc.
---
indeed
---
Hag &gt; Nurse &gt; Spirit. You cannot use your skill against those killers, whatever you learned to do against majority of other killers they just outright ignore it or counter hard so you're going down sooner than later.
---
*Survivors flashlighting killer*
---
Well I guess I‚Äôll go fuck myself
---
LMAO
---
Money.
---
stranger things :)
---
If you don't think Infectious is meta-defining on Nurse you're delusional
---
Still waiting on that no mercy map behavior.
---
Hm he isn't OP because he is just great at exploiting weakness. Nurse is OP because she creates them. For a billy to dominate he has to play well and you have to make mistakes for him to take advantage of.
---
the guy in the background is quentin lmao
---
My internet isnt perfect for example but people hardly ever have a bad connection to me (and when they do and stay they accuse me of lagswitching lmfao). 
---
Since the killer acts as the server, it means that you need a decent connection to the killer as well, its just in this case the killers connection bottlenecks your decent connection if their internet isnt good.
---
He needs the green windstorm add-on to base kit and the other's adjusted accordingly. With map pressure and bodyblocks he actually is pretty damn good
---
jonathan is cute though :(
---
Survivors already have well above 5 perks, it's called SWF. Killers do not need more perk slots. Its already a 10 minute game with ruin and pgtw combos.
---
We all started as shitty players. I remember how bad i was on my first game XD
---
Combine that with my internet connection and me being a scared bi*ch, that was some hard mode XD
---
Ruin, first Spirit in ages that wasn't running HG
---
Ah ok that makes sense
---
i love me some ace but i just didn't see any opportunity to put him in üòî
---
I wish Ash talked during matches (only your player could hear it so the killer wouldn't know your place)
---
As a red rank survivor I've seen all the toxicity myself. The majority of the time it's people who are in SWF who do it the most. Not only will they be toxic to the killer, but they will sandbag solo survivors like me constantly. With matchmaking being really screwed up, I have been put against yellow rank killer who are obviously new to the game. I'll give them a good chase, but I'll let them down me/hook me because I bet it's a frustrating experience for them with this unfair MM. I don't tbag, point, or do none of that stupid shit that plagues red ranks. I'll message the killer after the match to let them know it wasn't my intention of ruining their experience due to this screwed up MM and give them tips + words of encouragement to continue playing. Gotta help out the community as best I can is what I say.
---
watch the ping, wait for it to flux, if it fluxes, leave.
---
Please stop with the BS. You never said that it wasn't right in your post...at all.And I can read quite well, but then again you can't lie with a straight face either.But I am not going to argue with a toxic killer who dcs because he is sensitive about being teabagged. You made the post.Like you said in your title, "I'll get the hate for this,but the hyprocrisy is crazy". That title describes you very well
---
same
---
Well as a rank 1 nurse, I believe Sloppy, Nurse‚Äôs Calling, BBQ and PGTW/Ruin are much more useful. 
---
Infectious Fright is only useful after a while in the game, when you might have the opportunity to Slug and several people are injured. This never happens against the Elite Squad for example. 
---
It‚Äôs an excellent perk, but it is no help at all against top SFW team.
---
Yea but this will not be the last pallet you throw on a spirits head ;)
---
that‚Äôs typically what I do. I try not to stay in lobbies where the ping is over 150 or spikes. But sometimes even then I still lag a bit. I had a game against a Michael where my ping was around 70 and I was rubber banding. Not sure how but ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I don't know much about colorblindness, but I know Splatoon has a colorblind setting that permanently sets the ink colors to neon orange and dark blue. Would this be an option for DBD? Like, instead of changing the brightness they could change the aura colors to something you have less trouble picking up?
---
Yet there will be people using 2 or 3 gen stopping perks just to make the game last 5 minutes longer. If there's going to be a really strong alternative to Ruin like e.g. PGTW then something should be done about ruin so it's less OP in combos with other perks.
---
It has always been there since day 1. Appropriate too since matchmaking takes forever on PS4. Ash is self aware!
---
That would be awesome. I really want them to add more emotes. Maybe a clapping one for survivors at the gate to applaud the killer for a good game. Or to be a killer and see a survivor dancing at the gate when you walk around the corner. Seeing Ash whip and nae nae at the gate would make me drop my controller laughing lol or maybe make the long matchmaking at lobbies not be so annoying by letting characters emote at the lobby. Maybe even give killers an emote or two. Just a thought I've been having for a while now.
---
Literally the funniest thing in the world üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ I‚Äôm a mad grit user now till I die
---
Ghostface is pretty meh, but Legion is a lot worse.
---
I'd much rather deal with teabagging or telling me to kms in chat than to literally ruin my game experience by kicking me out of games or team killing me. Yea, at least in dbd you can hide the chat.
---
I already gotten iron will from leveling jake
---
Do you mind if im not very good myself?
---
My name is New Stars on steam
---
Flashlight clicking is kinda toxic
---
if you do it excessively, yeah definitely
---
Nah chill. With Legion you basically know where everybody is, everyone is ALWAYS injured, movement speed is amazing and with the right perks, they never get a chance to do generators. Since Legions release date I've never gotten less than 3 mans with them. 
---
With Ghostface it feels like you dont even have a power besides T Bagging. I'd probably go out of my way to say he is the worst killer. Most say leather face but at least with leather face you have a power.
---
2 was brutal, 3 was ruthless*
---
What‚Äôs wrong with a player not getting points? That‚Äôs the real question. 
---
Like it doesn‚Äôt matter either way. It doesn‚Äôt affect you whatsoever.
---
Really? That's unfair for killers, there a 4k means nothing ..
---
You are taking notes though, right?
---
How can you tell if it‚Äôs your internet or the killers internet playing up?
---
Something I didn‚Äôt know I need
---
Oh I do it so the killer can spam theirs and we communicate through ready pings
---
Actually, the legion is objectively a trash killer and while he can get free first hits, he doesn't actually have a power that helps him in a chase. If you want to make survivors suffer get good at the nurse or get even slightly adept at the spirit.
---
Muggles are shaking rn
---
Yeah, I have every killer teachable perk aside from Demogorgon, so that‚Äôs the downside to unlocking all perks lmao
---
It's when a killer focuses on one survivor only ignoring everyone else until that survivor dies.
---
I only cared about this 6 hours ago. üò¨
---
Me being a rank 20 (cause I havent played in a long long time) got in a game with two rank 1 survivors
---
I had a Trapper yesterday at red ranks who slowly looked up. I instantly thought he was kicking the pallet and ran off looking for my next loop. That's the first time I've EVER seen anybody try that trick.
---
Had no idea that gen was an achievement.
---
Quentin is even uglier now idk what they did to his hair :(
---
As someone who physically can't have good internet right now, and is a killer main, I really hope for dedicated servers because it's no fun when everything is so easy because the game is hella laggy.
---
That being said, if you're facing a killer with terrible net just leave please and don't wait til the end of the game to shit-talk the killer. (Not you OP just ppl in general)
---
LOL yes! it's not like fucking RANK RESET is a fucking thing and the game PUNISHES fast games as 1 hit down killer or thrown games! XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
Self destruction
---
I want the Ashy Slashy puppet to emote
---
It was taken down by more than that. The devs handled a LOT of things wrong then straight up lied to people. The court case was a convenient excuse to walk away.
---
Just add me
---
From my experience, the things i stated are the only things that hinder the game idc ab devs lying the game is still fun would be way better if those two things werent the way they are
---
Doc or Myers
---
If you knew how much hate i get when playing my P3 Freddy with Fake pallets, Red paint brush, Enduring, Spirit Fury, Bbq and Ruin omg that‚Äôs incredible
---
Yea, but wraith still has the worst base power. It really feels like he has no power at base and choose it with your add-ons
---
It‚Äôs also sad that other than some uniques (6s stealth) all his brown and yellow add-ons are just bad and they aren‚Äôt really usable. They don‚Äôt make enough of a difference and it still feels like using his base power
---
Most killers have a combo of brown amd yellow add-ons that can be reliably used. Wraiths power is not good enough to work with little boosts
---
Unless it‚Äôs rank reset lol
---
Quentin: i sleep
---
How do I do a spoiler tag?
---
Legion has some limited detection and can easily injure.
---
His problem is that his power doesn't help him finish off survivors (barring Franks+SWS+tinkerer).
---
Once the survivor is already injured, he has nothing going for him other than normal speed and a smaller than average hitbox. 
---
Ghostface can one shot survivors and get surprise hits. If he has to chase normally he's almost as bad as Legion, but unlike Legion he does have other options.
---
People would abuse that with their friends hard. It‚Äôs why you can‚Äôt see what the killer is running til‚Äô a match is done.
---
**Guys, the Thermal Gen, go get it!**
---
I am weak against stealth killers like GF or Myers, i don‚Äôt know what to do when i loop and i know he is leveling Evil Within, i feel helpless
---
Spamming the ready button isn't bad for me, cause sometimes it helps.
---
For me it's annoying when you change the character 1000 times... then I bring a mori too
---
Not bad at all. Good job on the distance/perspective. Keep drawing and practicing. :)
---
Yup, not my proudest fap
---
They made the matchmaking worse to make queue times not take ages
---
It feels like we can‚Äôt have the best of both world. Either bad balance or long queues
---
And people are complaining about both
---
Being an exhaustion perk, doesnt it have 40 seconds cooldown?
---
&gt;Irrelevant. Here's why:
---
Survivors as characters are all identical, with the only difference being their character models and their voices. Their hit-boxes are all the same. The only tactical advantage you might get when playing a certain survivor is that some survivors are a little less loud than others. 
---
I know survivors are the same, my first question ties to what i said about buffing underrepresented things like maps, dark sense, and iron grasp.
---
&gt;1. Buffing maps won't change much of the game's meta. Maps provide information that experienced players don't need. The only thing experienced survivors really use a map for is the Map+Key combination, which requires at least one SWF buddy. 
---
&gt;2. Dark Sense already got buffed. It is now in a pretty good spot. The only issue with it is that its effects aren't something most experienced survivors are looking for, but that's a given with situational perks. 
---
&gt;3. Iron Grasp doesn't need a buff anyway. The -75% struggling effects is enough to make it a worthwhile perk for certain builds, like the Fruit Ninja build (naming credit goes to HybridPanda). Once again, it's a situational perks. 
---
This is exactly my point, these things (which are just random examples of non-meta items, and perks) are never used at high ranks, just like bad killers. But people don't have a problem with them never being used, which is why I started by asking if you did.
---
&gt;Here's the biggest difference between killers and perks. Perks can be situational, and that's okay. Killers should be able to make those situations happen. If they cannot do that, what's the point of even trying to use said perks on said killers? If a killer is only viable while using certain add-ons or certain perks, the killer in question isn't actually viable, and that's a problem. 
---
&gt;"There will always be a "meta" in games, but this is a different type of game. Buffing one killer doesn't affect other killers, unless it makes survivor switch their builds, because killers don't face eachother. You can have everyone viable at the same time. There's nothing stopping that from happening."
---
I don't agree with the idea that we need all killers to be viable at high ranks, just as not all perks, and items are viable at high ranks, 
---
&gt;So you should be punished by the game for wanting to be good at a killer whom you also find fun to play? Everyone in the high ranks should be bored out of their fucking minds because the game said "fuck you" to anyone who doesn't enjoy playing Billy, Spirit or Nurse? 
---
No, I think you should just face survivors who arent using meta perks, or items. I main Pig, and I never feel like she is underpowered, except when I face high ranking survivors. I feel like killers should be able to play at rank one with good killers, and also play at mid ranks with bad killers.
---
It's almost as if in order to rank up, you should be doing better than average.
---
Not everyone wants to spin four plates at once. If the killer is convinced killing me will be their optimal strategy, go ahead. If the killer let everyone fully play the game, the killer wouldn't be a killer, because the survivor rulebook states everyone needs to complete a gen, get an unhook, escape a chase and survive.
---
Wow, so we're the entity because we love watching different kinds of killers hunt down small groups of plucky survivors...that's kinda neat.
---
He had to poo and used the map to clean his ass
---
I‚Äôd love to see him but there is one problem that can prevent him from being in the game and that‚Äôs the fact that he made real life victims, and they have been gruesomely gutted, even if it was 100 years ago, BHVR would go through an incredible Shitstorm with every SJW now
---
Yeah it does. But the killer can still be stunned by the survivor in the locker right next to it three seconds later. 
---
In that case I guess it can't be helped. At least not survivor-side. It's just an unlucky situation all around.
---
There is still a touch of vacuuming on pallets still.
---
Im sorry i like to play with my friends. I bet you dont take Ruin and BBQ off either but i dont really care about people using meta perks.
---
I think the game has some kind of auto aim built into it, but in my experience it's mostly felt when the game decides you wanted to hit that wall next to the survivor trying to turn a corner.
---
So you want the killer to be immune from stuns for 30 seconds? Um no
---
Wraith, I was traumatized by a wraith who tunneled me for an entire game while bing bonging constantly. He‚Äôd down me, let me proceed to get healed then do it all over again. I ended up escaping because he didn‚Äôt actually care about killing me, he just wanted me to know that he could do it whenever he felt like it. Plus, it seems like every wraith I play against is god himself behind a screen
---
K
---
Sooooonnnn.
---
It doesn't even have to be 30. 3 would be fine. Just something to prevent this kind of thing from happening.
---
Those two aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive though, he didn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs an exploit or anything of sorts.
---
Soooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnn.
---
I have exposed someone by staring at them through cracks in the killer shack
---
my rank 5 SWF group getting rank17-20Killers every day this last week be like. We bouth to teach this fool some new tricks, so they may become better players and stick to the game B)
---
Okay but you made a recent post and I wanted to see who hurt your feelings and I had an OPINION just like you said others have????? So don‚Äôt act all tough now
---
e.e
---
No ones acting touch and I never said you couldn‚Äôt have your opinion. I simply said I didn‚Äôt care about this topic anymore. LMAO whyre you mad
---
I wish that term didn't have such a negative connotation, when you point out that the "killer ignores bodyblocking". Whenever I am given the option to hit a bodyblocker, it has always been a "hey, would you like to extend your chase another minute?".
---
I would like a remix version his chase music. 
---
‚ô™ Demo Chase - Salty Dub
---
‚ô™ Demo Chase - Charred Wedding Deep House
---
‚ô™ Demo Chase - Shred Slam (Explicit)
---
‚ô™ Demo Chase - Cold Wind Windup
---
Have you noticed any sort of disparity in skill? i.e does it seem harder on PC than console or vice versa?
---
It's not the killer's fault the Claudette chose the least optimal decision at the least optimal time.
---
People keep saying this, but then I see killer streamers 4K relatively consistently at r1 with maybe a few hatch escapes if they don‚Äôt slug, Truetalent says it often but then I see him ruin SWFs for 5 hours every day, like maybe the 2 groups of elite swfs exist but I‚Äôve never seen them on any killer streams
---
*Playing newbie Killer
---
The issue has been high skilled players against lesser skilled Killers, but I have yet to see any rank 20-13 in any of my rank 7 games.
---
It's honestly not worth getting protectin hits, BUT if you want to, try getting them when the killer is carrying a survivor. It's almost always guaranteed.
---
If you're new to the game though, you should ditch the perk for now and try to get some Teachables. David King's We're Gonna Live Forever is great for getting bloodpoints as survivor (think a less useful BBQ and Chili, which works with Protection Hits and Safe Unhooks) and Claudette's Self-Care are invaluable for new survivors.
---
I‚Äôm not mad???   I swear, teenagers shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on this sub. 
---
This is why people downvoted you so hard and think you‚Äôre a joke.
---
Because it's a laggy Killer, and that can be quite irritating.
---
Ghostface can one shot Rank 20 survivors and that's like... it. Let's be honest. Anyone lower will go, oh hi and boom. Gone.
---
I feel like Legion was slept on. Well, until everyone complained. Then boom. Nerfed but still hated on.
---
My billy is p3 and I have bought over 100 perks (including the tiers) and still haven‚Äôt gotten bbq
---
Anyone with an instant down. I'm not salty getting hit by them (I'm really not, I don't get mad at stuff like that), it's just not fun to play overly cautious knowing that I can't take a hit, and practically negates three of my perks (Mettle of Man, Self-Care, and We're Gonna Live Forever).
---
Good ol' Devs
---
Fix one thing then 7 other things break in the process
---
Oh no, I said something you didn‚Äôt like now all of a sudden I‚Äôm a ‚Äúteenager‚Äù. Get over yourself
---
Killer POV must be absolutely hilarious
---
Hey guys I have this totally op build for Hag that I'm never using again. Oh yeah? What is the layout? I cAnT tElL yOu.
---
Red ranks are the WORST tbh I am a red rank survivor aswell but when I play killer not often just to play casually cus I‚Äôm only rank 12 but I brought the demogorgan yesterday and had it LVL1 and obviously I got destroyed by red ranks and got so much abuse for on PS4 they‚Äôre so toxic. However I‚Äôll admit as a rank 3 I can be toxic but only against campers tunnellers and campers
---
Most of It looks good but dwights face looks weird imo
---
This has meme potential
---
I think you're supposed to cover peoples usernames
---
Easy 1000th upvote
---
I'm pretty sure he also got some tweaks In the ptb
---
Yep. I don't even know it DL crashed the game during the PTB. It's sad since it's actually a decent perk now. The slowdown meta will be upon us when they fix it.
---
I thought this was pretty well known?
---
"Leaving the game to get out of dream world"
---
It's also not hook camping if non of the 4 of you get rid of my activated deme portal in front of the basement and you save someone there.
---
Lagging as soon as you‚Äôre in is dog shit internet. Most people all they do is start downloading games and pew pew
---
For me it's just been "oh you want to have fun? Why not get paired with super sweaty survivors that just genrush and teabag you all game even though just wanna play the new killer" but yea new update is pretty fun besides the bugs
---
I've only seen one person use it and have it crash. No other person ever used it in their videos.
---
I can imagine them hitting you for like 10 Damage but they have an annoying knock back effect
---
Lol a simple dc would have been way worse this
---
Gens get done way too fast as is even with ruin, and there's always a chance they just find your ruin and cleanse it and now you're down a perk in like 30 secs into the match.
---
Is that counted as camping if I put a Demo portal in basement?
---
Best killer is wraith by a mile, with Predator, Insidious, Distressing, unnerving presence. Never lost a game with it against red ranks with insta heals.
---
‚ÄúI only cared about this 6 hours ago‚Äù is that what you call not being rude? No, you said that because you were sad and didn‚Äôt think someone would come to this post. 
---
Instead of replying back normally you wanted to ACT TOUGH.   
---
And you know you care about it because you made it and haven‚Äôt deleted it. 
---
Stay off the sub if you can‚Äôt handle people‚Äôs opinions
---
I don't have any feelings towards it, I have been playing this game for 3 years that I have gotten used to it lol. Hey maybe Dedicated servers will fix it Kappa
---
lol he looks depressed  like he is working a  9 - 5 job for the entity and is like "Why do I do this?"
---
So many people run in here and get trapped it's hilarious xD Me and my friend did custom match to explore the lab and first thing she said when she saw that room was something like ''Well whoever goes in here is fucked'' lol
---
Everyone's hands are huge

No sweetie, I said that because I quite literally only cared about it 6 hours ago üòÇ that‚Äôs not acting tough. but i mean whatever you say sweetheart. I don‚Äôt have to delete the post just because I don‚Äôt care???

That gen is the one that gets you the achievement? Well crap.

¬£70 would get you 5 copies of the game and access to the beta back in the day.
---
This pleases the nut
---
Is it bannable to body block like that and hit them? Cos if so I don't see why it should be cos they went in there so .-.
---
You didn't lose your anger at all.
---
For me its been the opposite. Sweaty killers who will DC if someone is about to escape. And they hard DC so you don't get bloodpoints. I'm just trying to get more bp for Nancy.
---
Hes just nodding. Can you count that as toxic,?
---
I have to agree. Season 2 was alright and I thought the show was gonna get boring. But S3 was bomb. I fell in love with Robin instantly.
---
Well by that definition you could also argue that the killer almost never kills the survivor since all they do is hook them for the entity to kill. The only time a killer actually kills a survivor is when he uses a mori, therefore does that mean killer only deserves credit when he mori's a survivor?
---
Camping you
---
PC actually seems far more toxic than console from what pretty much everybody says.

---
I‚Äôll try but as you can see I can‚Äôt draw for shit
---
Yeah, I've seen Hunt. It's clearly gonna become so competitive and toxic.
---
He ain't, just as fast as the demogorgon or Trapper.
---
I'd argue that Billy is the most balanced killer in the game. Strong M2 but can be looped, unlike nurse. A good Billy will still be able to saw at loops and those Billy's are scary. Spirit I fucking hate. Here's a killer that stands still and you have ZERO idea what they are doing and sometimes even if you make the right call she has collision and catches you anyway. Hell, even at vaults she has no animation, just standing still again and you don't know if she is vaulting or phasing. I realise she takes skill to play but my complaint is all the of the mind game is on the killer side and that's just not fun for me. I'd honestly rather go against a nurse. I agree too on Billy being super fun to play against.
---
I think the ancient survivor will be canonically be thought by modern survivors on how to fix gens. Or maybe instead of gens, they will have some cogwheel puzzle
---
You can draw better than me dude. You got some talent. Im sure you can do it
---
I agree with you, but we're talking about DBD here. Everybody already knows nearly everyone who plays Siege is toxic as fuck.
---
It‚Äôs the matchmaking. The new dlc and patch really fucked everything up. BHVR said they‚Äôre working on it so hopefully it gets fixed soon
---
same with legion eh?
---
It's both. Matchmaking is broken at the moment, BHVR is working on the fix. But even without it matchmaking for SWF is not "fair" in terms of ranks.
---
Oh... well
---
They did a pretty good job so far
---
Cool, but why did it take them 3 years to add the "feature" of not having to reinvite the entire team after each individual game? Why haven't they added a simple colorblind mode that people have been asking for since launch? Why are they the only single game that doesn't make stream sniping someone (cheating) a bannable offense? Why do they completely refuse to even TRY to balance the game for both sides instead of just having survivors be able to shit stomp people at high ranks just by playing with friends? Oh but MM came out 3 fucking years ago so all's forgiven! Actually a braindead degenerate.
---
Basically use your big brain, use your power creatively...
---
Know when to give up on a chase, know when to give up on redlight mindgames.
---
Know when to prioritize gens and when to prioritize survivors.
---
Know when slugging is better than hooks, know the value of a simple 1 hook.
---
Make a build that suits your killer. Playstyle means fuck all the killers power and stats are way more important that whatever you like personally.
---
If you want to win, play nurse, spirit, billy, huntress and hag... master their playstyles and high skill cap learning curve.
---
If you want to sometimes win... play freddy, demogorgon, or plauge.
---
If you are prepared to simply lose 90% of your games play anyone else.
---
You forgot Huntress, she's slower too. Also, Myers in tier 1
---
repost
---
Lmfaooo TheyNeverDoAnythingRight
---
Well endgame collapse exists now meaning you can close hatch and if a gate opens it triggers a 3 minute timer meaning if that counts down and survivors aren't already gone they die so yeah use that for endgame builds and stuff. As a demogorgon main I'll give some tips but all I'm saying is he's not the best killer to start with, his shred ability is only really useful at window areas or in straight lines besides that it's pretty eh, the portals are great for managing generators and exits but they cant be replaced so survivors  need to destroy them to get a portal back.
---
It üÖ±Ô∏è like that sometimes
---
It would be great if there'd be a system for SWF, if your friends is 3 ranks higher or lower you can't play with him, that'd fix the SWF problem, I think.
---
That was sarcasm
---
Yeah, but we all know they won't ever actually balance the game lol. Survivors have ALWAYS had the upper hand, ever since this game launched.
---
He seems pretty fast compared to everybody else, imo
---
This is a tough one cause outright fun factor in what they can do is Clown, Pig, Legion and Ghostface, for having a chance in every single game at Rank 1 so I am not bullied into submissive by toxic tea bagging SWFs? Spirit and Nurse hands down.
---
Contrary to like most of the player base I would assume, I absolutely despise playing against Trapper, not because he's strong or anything, but when I play against him I just... Fuck his traps man I hate them. They make me more scared than any of the Killers with Stealth including Prayer Beads Spirit (You can hear her footsteps if she has that addon so I know if she either has it/is coming towards me so it's less scary, and yes I can hear them when I'm doing a gen).
---
Yep forgot about those but Myers tier 1 is more so not considered his base speed ingame as in character info it states he moves 4.6 or as fast as the demogorgon
---
Not really the equivalent.
---
Pig by far to play as. And to play against, any stealth killer really. I love getting jump scared compared to heartbeat.
---
Probably because of how he walks
---
&gt; What I do know is that this game really needs you to be able to take a lot of mental pummeling.
---
Only if you focus on your results and put too much importance into the survivors' actions. If you play for fun and don't see every lobby as a team of bullies, game is quite non-toxic.
---
Pretty much, every time a survivor is sacrificed the entity drains a bit of their soul, and emotions and then revives them to relive that again. The limitations on game serve as a means of the entity to "fatten" survivors up so they have more powerful emotions to feed off of. So yeah, the entity is a massive asshole.
---
Yeah I figured as much, must've been half a second off though
---
What rank tho? I wanna know the red ranks winrate.
---
I think it should be 1/2/3 gens instead of 24/28/32 meters. Would make it more reliable on big open maps like farm or estate. Right now its only really good on the new map. Even on larrys the gens are too spread out
---
ULTRA KILL
---
TBH, if I burnt a mori (which I only do for dailys) and all survivors burnt streamers, I'd not use my mori.
---
"at least somewhat"
---
Do you really need an answer to how a game where certain survivors and killers that are already locked behind paywalls could be p2w
---
Indeed
---
no one cares
---
A COMMENT YOU CAN HEAR
---
My group plays all the time, even back when this wasn‚Äôt an issue, and it was always consistent. I guess maybe we just got lucky with it. Lmao we always try to figure out what we‚Äôll get by finding the average, it was never the answer we got, but always around it üòÇ that was the most fun we could get considering it took 20 minutes to a get a match lmao
---
I‚Äôm genuinely curious, are you allowed to play this game at your age? I mean maybe you are not actually playing this game but I thought this isn‚Äôt for those that under 18? I like your art though!

**\*Playing Lea Salonga's Reflection in the background\***
---
But they're not doing well? So many people don't seem to get that the point of the game as a killer isn't to kill everyone, it's to torture them. You're supposed to mess with people, play around, chase, and earn points with those behaviours. 
---
Why would they ever want to encourage short games for the killer? All that happens then is 80% of players end up having a shit game. The current system instead encourages everybody winning. If a killer has a 32k game, odds are the survivors have pretty good scores too. 
---
It works the same way for survivors too. If survivors just gen rush and finish the trail without engaging the killer at all, their scores aren't going to look good are they? 
---
Rushing the game either way isn't good. The entire rank system is designed to encourage lengthy and engaging play from both sides.
---
Yep basically a tunneling perk, don't touch the unhooked survivor for 60s and you don't get DS'd
---
They can constantly see you at loops, rip mindgames. If they are decent you're not gonna catch them.

It's showing the survivors not killers duh
---
Lol ikr he feels so much faster and just gets me at vaults all the time
---
I can see nurse being too strong, but anyone asking for spirit nerf just doesn't care about balance lol. Spirit is completely fine where she is.
---
Ever notice how ‚Äúteam‚Äù scoring has nothing to do weather playing with my friends play the game together and you are just salty because you are a trash rank 20 killer
---
No one uses emojis on reddit. C‚Äômon girl get with it or leave!

Everyone is right. You‚Äôre a moron Lmaooo I‚Äôm sorry
---
I played my first game of Leatherface and I did horrible with his power so I was going down the hole of Leatherface videos and this appears. I think YouTube is telling me something
---
If they could just decrease her post blink lunge range, I'd be so much happier with her
---
No, I don;t want Freddy to be seen from 2 meters. Mindgames becomes absolutely imposible, whenever you double back they can easily react, because they see you. The perk should have a range, like if you're 32m away from a killer, you can't see them.
---
Btw Freddy has lullaby so if he facecamps everyone is gonna hear he's there, insidious doesn;t work on lullaby.

‚ÄúNo one uses emojis on reddit.‚Äù *continues to have an emoji in her name* counts just as much baby doll. Quite frankly, I don‚Äôt care if no one else‚Äôs uses them because I do.

---
This a super kewl drawing! Dwight's lips might need a tiny bit of adjusting but otherwise perfect!! (I love your style btw)
---
They didnt change anything about that, so that's on you.
---
They made the final gen not activate bear traps to fuck up endgame builds, and they nerfed her crouch addons.
---
It said "Killer Stun". Good lord, BHVR.
---
They are bad.
---
Wouldn't it be too dirty?
---
True, to some extent. Meta-whores would be forced as they want to win. But people who enjoy a character regardless of being shit or not as good, would still play them.
---
Lol never even knew he exists
---
Balance hasn't changed at all. Survs still reign supreme and only 3 out of 17 killers are viable at high ranks.
---
I'm gonna loosen up your toenails if you keep being a mild inconvenience to everyone.
---
I saw your mouse movement lol
---
When 4 come together they merge into the Quadette.
---
Please behavior, fix this. Add a sliding scale to change hues and saturations and shit.
---
My color blindness is weird, because it's not natural,  and I require a slider to fix shit, so it's not as easy as popping on a type setting like they do in fortnite.
---
It would be a pretty cool idea, but it would just even more unbalanced shit, so unfortunately I wouldn‚Äôt agree to having it. Unless the devs, drastically change the game, maybe.
---
I want to like Demogorgon, but until I get my good build going, he's lacking that fun factor. Clown is fun, Ghost Face is tons of fun, Freddy with a slowdown build is fun.
---
Honestly, I don't know who I enjoy going against. I just know I dislike Doc and Pig most.
---
Yeah, "not wanting to use ruin", right. Every time they introduce a gen stopping perk it goes on top of ruin in most killer builds. Ruin, pop, thana and sloppy on Nurse, Billy and Spirit is the sad reality.
---
I hear &amp; see it constantly

Dead by daylight in a nutshell
---
Ok I thought you posted the image and I thought this was in the game, and I was thinking, ‚ÄúHow have I never noticed this before??‚Äù 
---
I read what you said wrong so I was like ‚ÄúOh wait, never mind.‚Äù
---
I get people who just dc when they get down,essentially leaving their team to die
---
Today I played my first game (downloaded the game during the free weekend, to decide whether to buy it or not). Couldn't find any game as a Killer, so I picked a survivor.
---
First game - swamps against the Hag. Jumped a couple of times to her traps but managed to juke some of her attacks, had some fun hiding and running.  
---
Two of us died, me and the other guy were hurt with two generators left. I was caught repairing one but somehow I managed to wiggle myself free two times in a row, after which the Killer had a change of heart and escorted us to freedom (planting some jumpscares along the way).
---
A wholesome match that has left me with a big smile, especially after reading so many comments about this game's supposed toxic community :3.
---
Wraith mains: am, I, a joke to you?
---
So .. you like to do the things you do the rest of the year? Sounds fun..
---
He is not dead... just saying.
---
In comparison, absolutely. 
---
Ruin, Stridor, Sloppy Butcher, and Make Your Choice.
---
It's super fun at rank 1 when the survivors have absolutely no counter-play, right?
---
r/emojipolice exists specifically to make fun of emojis, sir. Just using it for what it‚Äôs for. Also, don‚Äôt recall telling you that you can‚Äôt use emojis.
---
I really hate the Ruin meta. It‚Äôs the strongest anti-gen perk if it can last, but most of the time it‚Äôs found within a minute or two during the match. Other anti-gen perks are more consistent. 
---
Pop can be used as many times , as long as you can hook a survivor. 
---
Corrupt Intervention only last 2 minutes but it‚Äôs always there at the start to block off 3 gens
---
Thrilling Tremor is good to track which gens survivors are working on, but it has a pretty long cooldown. It‚Äôs not bad, still not the greatest.
---
I used to run Ruin, but it just isn‚Äôt consistent for me, so I just got used to gens being done pretty quick. I also have slug, since it‚Äôs needed to slow the game down a bit. 
---
Playing perfectly, multiple downs one after another rapidly, but gens just go to quick sometimes. It‚Äôs rough as killer sometimes :(
---
I agree and i think they should buff the shrine!
---
The way they all get up and move around like a school of fish
---
The thing with this game is fking messed up I tell you. You're looking at it from Surv POV. I can tell u in my killer games. MOST of the time my ruin breaks within a few seconds or less than 5 mins into the game. When I play survivor, it takes 24 years to find a totem. By the time one of us finds it. It's over..
---
Nah.
---
Wraith doesn't need buffing surely? Most killers just use him to camp anyway. Its like, "Yeah we can still see you Bing Bong!" then they wonder why they lose the game so quickly..
---
If you use your power in chases then it really isn't that bad.
---
&gt;ignore the fact that Windows 10 has options to help. 
---
chief the der der add a color blind feature argument is stupid because there's already shit people can do
---
Head on is definitely not annoying. It's a meme perk. It depends on how well you play against it because it'll be very obvious.
---
Hmm ur controller holder appears to say otherwise
---
Never said it was, unless I implied that, not my intention, as of now I want to have fun playing the scary alien monster and trying not to be competitive.
---
So far it's going good but I'll need to play more.
---
wow poor bubba, then again he should have known you were in there because of the rushed entering
---
It's all a reflection on a glass coffee table
---
What are the chances people play like Marth played SWF with Depip squad? It's the most immersed and the most boring killer which does not stand for SWF itself. People who SWF will have 4 flashlights and waste time on saving ppl while having a few on the gens and are good loopers.
---
With 8% and current cooldown, surge should regress 3 closest gens.
---
Get shat on you toxic fucks
---
Break a leg? Mine are made of steel
---
You‚Äôre so creepy. I like how I look??? I just wanted to change it weirdo.  Why you want to see more of me babycake?
---
As survivor you don't even have to escape to get a pip, meanwhile you get punished if you get genrushed even if you get a 4k
---
Meme or not, but Notorious ds&amp;head combo on seriously pisses me off
---
They gave him yellow Windstorm by default, which is ass. He should've gotten green at least
---
I‚Äôm so creepy bc I looked at your page once? OH NO. I‚Äôm real sure, that‚Äôs super convenient for you isn‚Äôt it? Let‚Äôs insult a stranger and then change our profile picture so they can‚Äôt say anything LMAO good thing for you, I‚Äôm not shallow and I don‚Äôt give a single fuck as to what you look like. Grow up babe.
---
Well would you rather waste 20 seconds of time or get hit and moonwalked? And it‚Äôs not 20 seconds full up, it‚Äôs just 20 seconds to mend. You can stop and start again with the same time.
---
I like your style, keep going :)
---
Thats the reason why we have such a bad matchmaking. What the point of playing survivors and getting like 10-17k bps on avarage when you can play killer with BBQ and get 50-60k
---
"I should ask the entity for a raise"
---
With DS it definitely is! Lots of time wasted!!
---
He slowed down while uncloaking a bit but when he was visible he regained normal speed.
---
In the update they kept the slowdown while uncloaking but also kept it a bit after before the speed boost kicks in.
---
Well it does save walking up to it and wacking it too, and with surveillance it becomes very effective and easy tracking
---
Glad im not a killer main...
---
I did the achievement for doing that Gen and escaping. I'm never going to that room again
---
2 very high level Steve‚Äôs helped me as I am a low level baby Dwight against a hag saving me multiple time but in the end I was sacrificed to the entity, I really appreciated the effort they went through to help me.
---
Most people who buy dbd for stranger things are really simple
---
yes I published it on r / PerkByDaylight
---
Tell the devs to stop matching me with baby killers
---
We actually NEED shitty ass new players. So they can get better. And we have a lot of good players afterwards. Or at least mediocre players. Everything is fine as long as the community grows.
---
&gt; Know when to prioritize gens and when to prioritize survivors 
---
This. Whenever someone wants your attention and you go chase them endlessly, don‚Äôt. Be smart about that.
---
I like fuck up every single game chasing a tbagging survivor.. yeah..
---
Yeah I agree. I guess I should have been more specific in how I think she should be nerfed.
---
Mad grit does see use and is quite powerful against right situation. Ever heard of fruit ninja build? These lack of information shitposts on dbd are why most people stay shit they dont explore things fully and deem it shit or op without properly using em. Downvote and may god have mercy on your dumb soul
---
When I play killer, I'll sometimes spam the ready button. It's my way of saying, "Hi." =(
---
The only thing I can think it could be right now is maybe a ban? But I'm still not sure have you tried to close the game
---
I'm just trying to communicate through morse that we have party starters
---
I made an oopsie
---
I‚Äôll rush the gens
---
It depends on the country at which age you are allowed to Play and you can just tell steam that you are old enough
---
The band clearly started playing more heavy metal-ish since hail to the king. A7X had a way more heavier and unique sound until Arin came in with his awful drumming. They even straight out plagiated a Metallica song. Rev was the heart and soul of the band.
---
I keep hoping they'd implement an actual cooldown on Billy's chainsaw, with a base amount and extra the longer you ran with it. Right now he has map presence and instadowns at his disposal, at least make him choose one over the other or punish him for missed saws.
---
Nurse also shouldn't be able to lunge like 5m with a power like hers.
---
Just lioe everyone on reddit doesnt care about ur shitpost picture. If u visit this site even once a day u see shitloads of these. Ur not special and ur actually quite oblivious to how often this is a thing atm they made a statement theres a bug and they know what it is and are fixing. Now get over YOURSELF and that match u baby killer u
---
Yo my guy you gotta get off the gen for a second then get back on when you fail a ruin skill check if not you get like 1 million skill checks
---
Ah I see ghostface is having a bonding experience with you!
---
Thanks man! The next one will be way more complex. Intrestingly enough though. Half of Survivors and Killers gets rather  frustrated while playing a survivor. Which indicates that there is something really wrong which splits the playerbase. Hope the next survey will shine se light into that situation.
---
When you told steam you are 16 it doesn't matter
---
imagine thinking you're a total chad online but in reality you're a 12 year old girl in a 40 year old's body
---
May I ask what would it do?
---
Pennywise, Richie, and the carnival all designed off of IT: Chapter Two
---
I feel this way with all of demogorgons perks tbh, good ideas but bad execution. Surge should rather be '1/2/3  closest generators' instead of '24/28/32 meters' its basically useless on maps without multiple floors
---
How is that annoying lol? It‚Äôs not even that bad. What‚Äôs annoying is when the survivors changes his main a million times, not when they spam the ready button.
---
I got the same problems. Sometimes nat type is bad. Sometimes I dc. I guess it is a ps4 Bug
---
Mind breaker has some potential but the exhausted should be permanent until you leave the generator
---
Something else survivors have that I think is annoying now is keys. When there is a healthy survivor with a key next to the hatch, there is absolutely nothing you can do about it. Especially annoying when all 4 survivors are T-bagging on the hatch, each with a key in hand.

That was so painful to watch
---
I always had the idea that they should release modding tools for maps/models for the community to create custom maps and cosmetics which would then follow a system like TF2 where you can vote what you want to be put into the game and you can test the mods by either doing a private match or going into a modded version of the game (like Vermintide 2)
---
to be fair, that was probably swf. How do you get all 4 survivors in there?
---
TAKE MY STRONG HAND!
---
I mean, if all the DLC‚Äôs are really 70$ - go for it.
---
I personally think it‚Äôs worth it.
---
While yes, unfortunately, they recently offered that perk on the Shrine of Secrets, so it's doubtful that it'll appear anytime soon.
---
No idea what that means just saw it here
---
I had a game yesterday where I was killer against a 2, 4, 5, 12... AND IM RANK 13, THEYRE ALL LOWER THAN ME
---
The force of my thicc hand will pull you from that foul trapdoor lol
---
What are you going to do after all the killer offerings are done? offerings to play with certain survivors maybe? or perks?
---
As a Michael main I‚Äôd love to see that added, but sadly I doubt it will happen. But if they do ever do it hopefully they fix his mask a bit

You're right that would make more sense

Toxic cunts will be toxic cunts.

The final gen activates the traps, they just don't activate if the trap is added when all gens are already done
---
That's just crazy...wtf?
---
I explained the possibilities of depipping off of a 4k. I know it isn't impossible to do so, but at that point it's your fault for either decaying your emblem or just leaving everyone slugged, inversely another possibility is just letting the gens fly within a minute or so and then afterwords doing the former 2 actions which would also make you depip since you would at that point only really have 1 good emblem.
---
If you depippied off a 4k it's your fault not the games punishing you "for doing too good" since you most likely weren't doing good.

Better keep him cold, because when this creature gets hot, he gets bothered and will rock and flay both your body and mind, for he's a not only great in the sack, but he also loves kids....bodies....

---
The real way to play the new dlc
---
yeah, I‚Äôve been rank 1 for a while now but that‚Äôs only because I‚Äôve been getting pretty new killers. and really, I was almost at 3 because they weren‚Äôt hooking anyone so everyone was losing pips. Definitely not fun or fair for the killer
---
She could‚Äôve just faced the rock
---
Lord of the universe tier: Playing Pig with Mad Grit and the drill just to spam ASMR drill sounds

Cuz that's what heroes do
---
This was actually a scary scene for me
---
I have literally played and gotten good with every other killer. I just can't seem to get good with Billy. Hell, even the nurse is easier for kw to learn than the Billy.
---
Worse: he's like some type of weird Jedi Atronach Butthole Spider in the Sky.
---
,...!  Guys, I think I just came up with an idea for a TV show, jump on this money train, because we pulling off in this bitch
---
If you stop swf or even make it optional lots of people will quit so this cannot be fixed.
---
Get up on them and rev that chainsaw. He‚Äôs super fast and has a hit box the size of a house. Plus aim assist. If you know they‚Äôll get away with a window or pallet, just hit them with your basic.
---
For perks: Tinkerer, Enduring, BBQ, and Ruin is the most popular build.
---
Practice a little and you‚Äôll dominate just like every other hillbilly to ever play the game.
---
He‚Äôs an S tier killer. Just below Nurse and Spirit who are S+
---
It's not an sfw
---
Mozambique here
---
Told that killer must be ok you got me ! Lol well played
---
What is this from?
---
A simple solution could be to make regression stopping similar to overcharge i.e. difficult skill check. And then make overcharge a guaranteed missed skill check as soon as the genny is touched.
---
As a Jeff Main I apologize on his Behalf
---
Bruh I‚Äôve mained legion since their release and I can say without a doubt Ghostface is much better

But he's scared of wat- wait, NVM, wrong slasher
---
Imagine a 2 killer chapter with 1 survivor. (Hannibal and Bill, Clarice)
---
Its from the Movie "Legion"
---
I Chili'd all over my Barbeque.
---
And that‚Äôs his attack, he charges up and goes on all 4‚Äôs with his scream making any survivors near by scream, revealing themselves.
---
yea ik, I didn‚Äôt know what to fix about him though :P
---
I would love that. Hannibal‚Äôs mori would be eating them with a side of fava beans
---
People'll complain about anything in this game.
---
... I‚Äôm a criminal
---
What platform?
---
&gt;You can't just say the point of the game is what is pointed out in the lore rather than what the game conveys as the ultimate goal
---
How does the game convey this as the ultimate goal when it does everything it can to push you to play around and engage with each other? Everything about the game's design and it's lore shows that the goal is engagement, not destruction. The only reason you think it isn't is because you're thinking of it as a more traditional multiplayer game.
---
Maybe not, but when 3/4 of the build is for oneshotting them, essentially forcing them to either be Exposed immediately by Haunted Grounds or Exposed 3 hooks later by Devour Hope.
---
Mikel Mooers
---
I like that idea.
---
I stumbled upon it on YouTube around 12 but didn‚Äôt really understand it. But then it was free on PS4 for a little bit and that‚Äôs when I started playing.
---
I thought that was scented red crayons and 10 extra minutes  of recess.
---
So you can punish their game breaking exploit. /s
---
But seriously, I would not be surprised if Behaviour released a perk to fight an exploit/bug instead of fixing it.
---
Yea ik, thank you
---
PS4
---
It looks like he‚Äôs moving faster because he‚Äôs short. It‚Äôs just a perspective thing
---
Breaking him out of stealth as a survivor is bugged/unreliable. That could be why.
---
God I hope not
---
I havent had any problems on ps4... sorry but i cant help you.
---
0:18 "Aaaaaueueoooo"
---
Its the freddys lack of map pressure that allowed that to happen.
---
Probably a bug
---
You dont need any game slowing perks if you play as nurse, if you take them this just show how unconfident you are in your skill for playing her, and the guy arguing with you is right, infectious fright is a meta defining perk that on nurse has no counterplay other then what? Calm spirit?
---
I find the problem with Wraith is you can easily get the first hit, but once a survivor is hit, you struggle to get anything going.
---
Ah yes lightborn, a perk which bamboozles survivors the first time, but can be countered by just blinding you early.
---
Its a bug and it has been in the game since i started over a year ago. It happens to me to. Goodbye toolbox I saved a sliver on just to take out of the game

---
Since nobody has given you actual advice, I‚Äôll give some, nurse is the one of best but really hard to learn, hillbilly and spirit are also very good, not as hard to learn but not as good as nurse I find, legion is the worst killer by miles, his perks are ok tho from what I remember, the best perks for killer are barbecue and chilli, hex: Ruin and for me enduring. 
---
Barbecue and chilli is almost a must in higher ranks, it allows you to see survivors outside of 40 metres when you put another survivor on a the hook, this is great because if they do not show up then you know they‚Äôre close by, however if this happens don‚Äôt get paranoid.
---
Hex: Ruin is a perk for slowing the game it makes it so that good skill checks reduce generator progress by a small percent, but it is a hex perk, this means that it can be destroyed, so you‚Äôll need to protect it, don‚Äôt babysit it though, you rarely get anything done of you babysit hexes, this goes for all hex perks other than haunted grounds, it‚Äôs purpose is to get destroyed and give survivors a debuff
---
Enduring just reduces stuns, I‚Äôve always liked this perk for the reason that when you have it it almost makes pallets defunct as you can just break them as soon as they‚Äôre thrown down and you don‚Äôt need to run around them, it reduces all other stuns too but the main ones you‚Äôll face are pallets
---
If you have any other questions I‚Äôll be happy to answer them! Just reply to my comment and I‚Äôll get to it as soon as I can
---
*change nothing
---
Yep. Robin is great. Shame they had to agenda it towards the end.
---
I'd be ok with Ruin being nerfed if the base speed for gen fixing was nerfed a bit too. Ruin really is a gamechanger even if it's destroyed after the first hook, because that's when you've already started snowballing
---
Oh

---
Well I would assume that, if people are still borderline petitioning for it, that the options currently available aren't quite sufficient, no?
---
You do you. I personally would never do this and i find it pretty weird.
---
Death is the only fail state that is clearly conveyed through the game for the survivors. Even if you do enough to 2 pip you still end up getting same animations, same messaging as a person that de pipped. Even the end game screen says sacrificed. Only thing that is different is your rank at the end game, which you have no way of tracking it while in the game other than trying to remember what you did.
---
Same thing for the killers.
---
Not to mention the theme of the game is horror, or more specifically a slasher. The game markets itself and introduces itself as a slasher. It has all the classic elements of a slasher, even has licensed slasher killers.
---
Lore is inconsequential when there is a such a heavy leaning on an established genre. Obviously BHVR could revamp animations, UI, feedback of the game to better convey what the rank system intends, but that would remove the game's slasher roots for little to no gain.
---
A yikes from me chief
---
Connecting the chainsaw and running him more than 10 ft without hitting something. I get you need to plan ahead because his turn ability is crap after you start it up, but I seem to hit everything but the survivors. Even when I'm right up on them, I get juked so easily.
---
I mean if you consider teabgging as toxic, nodding is as well.
---
I have noticed a few times people just looking me dead in the eyes and not breaking me out of stealth, other times I can't have shroud on without someone kicking me out of it straight away XD
---
Sometime it pretty fun. The killer often open locker and it always hilarious
---
r/EmojiPolice
---
Lay your memes down and walk away!
---
Lmao just hand them permanent Bloodlust 1? Yeah thats a great idea buddy.
---
Thanks for the in-depth reply, I really appreciate it! I mostly end up playing lower rank Freddy‚Äôs after this update, so I haven‚Äôt really been seeing much benefit to waking up. I also don‚Äôt run borrowed time, so that‚Äôs news to me as well! But now I get it, thanks.
---
Micheal achieved what he wanted all along COOCHIE
---
Warframe? :O
---
I remember first seeing that Ghostface daily, I instantly re-rolled it due to its very specific requirements, it got replaced with the Doctor daily where all I needed to do was zap 4 survivors :-P
---
If you actually lean correctly as ghostface then you wont get revealed so easily
---
Taking control away from the player is never good. So big no on the overcharge change.
---
Honestly I just want them to make it so that if you dont touch a gen for 5 seconds uninterrupted the regression doesn't go away. Thatd fix it. But last time I suggested it i got downvoted to hell so apperantly thats a horrible idea.
---
me grabbing the ruler from the kitchen to hit the spider on my ceiling at 4am
---
Thats crazy, ive played that map over thirty times now and there has never been a gen up those stairs.
---
One can't perform a "strategy" without effective communication before and during, i.e. SWF. Spawning solo, not saying anything in the lobby, and then jumping in and out of a locker would appear sketchy to anyone. You were more of a detriment to your team than you were helpful.
---
but they are, also look at overwatchs colorblind mode. that shit was wacky
---
OK look. I don't want ruin nerfed. But if people want other perks equally strong as ruin then something needs to be done in case both are used in conjunction. Ehh, it's a matter of time before we get a perk like that and then we will need to wait months before survivor games are playable again unless in SWF.
---
I have only one thing to say about this, fucking. Pansies. Play the game well, stop being salty, say gg, and leave, get into a match, rinse and repeat. You didn't do anything wrong, and You won't get banned, don't worry bud &lt;3
---
Huntress. Almost all huntresses I  have played against have been campers
---
Do you have an example screenshot/picture?
---
Bubba should have a LOT less movement with his going though.  My biggest complaint with Bubba is that he can hold it for SO LONG that you basically always get hit by it.
---
Billy on the other hand should have to sprint a TINY distance before being able to instadown because right now he can sprint half a milimeter and instant down you which feels like COMPLETE ass.
---
No problem :)
---
This is great! Love all the little details.
---
That was unexpected
---
Trying to learn Wraith, so thanks for this. I don't have the addons to do the gen grabber build yet.
---
So are you saying that when you hit someone and they head for a loop rather than chasing, it's better to cloak and surprise them? I try that, but they know I'm there and just run between pallets while gens pop.
---
This is why i‚Äôm fully towards no mercy.
---
Thanks so much  your advice will help alot
---
So you don‚Äôt like browns?
---
Yhorm!
---
that gen always spawns there. So far from what I noticed that gen, a chest, and a totem always spawn up there (chest can be removed  with a cut coin obviously.
---
it is always the room next to the hole that you can drop down from.
---
Lol I‚Äôm on a wired connection. It wasn‚Äôt mine
---
Easiest solution, don't allow multiple ruin like perks to be played in the same build, as long as it really is as powerful as you say
---
Why i were more of a detriment? It not like i spam the locker the whole game?
---
Yes. I am the CEO of racism. Hello.
---
bruh they are telling you to fuckin ready up.
---
Normally I'm on the Killer side of things but what more do you want wraith to have? He's not meant to be good at chases, he's meant to be good at getting a first hit easily.
---
Just because a killer isn't as broken as nurse, doesn't mean they need a buff. Chases lasting too long are a symptom of bad map design, which is something BHVR is currently addressing in the new maps they release.
---
I get it, it's a stolen Facebook meme that this dude put the word lightborn in and watermarked with his name. Nothing to do with the game just a low effort karma grab lul.
---
She deserves it with perks like those. Seems like the typical ‚Äúimmersed survivor‚Äù build.
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve done absolutely amazingly as Billy with his three teachables before and only gotten a single pip because I didn‚Äôt chase long enough, nor injure them (I‚Äôm pretty decent with his chainsaw). I get 4K after 4K and play Billy exactly how he was intended to be played and don‚Äôt get the adept perk for him because I‚Äôm too good at him. That‚Äôs the most counter-intuitive thing imo.
---
It ain‚Äôt just nurse; I‚Äôve had this against a variety of killers, such as the clown and doctor. It‚Äôs just a part of the bug Dead by Daylight.
---
I‚Äôm not surprised.
---
&gt; considering that Killers don't seem to slow AT ALL after falling
---
... yeah that's an intended game mechanic bruh. Just like survivors being able to vault quicker than killers.
---
Fair enough - how about making it actually "tremendously difficult" as per the description? Because as now even I can hit those overcharge skill checks! Lol.
---
I like your idea though of the 5 seconds. That's the same (or similar) to when you miss a hex skill check and the generator doesn't progress for x seconds. Makes sense.
---
I loved that event and it was an amazing time to SWF to coordinate harvesting and getting gens done.
---
Now its just going to be same ol dumb gen rushing. And killers camping the event gens.
---
Vanity mirror tho. He‚Äôd love it üòÉ
---
it was around 2 am when I was making it so I wasn‚Äôt at my highest. also, I can‚Äôt draw people facing the right to save my life
---
Does it say which Killers are forced to kill?

I think that‚Äôs a fair assessment. Obviously I don‚Äôt know what the game is like at higher levels, so I can‚Äôt offer my two cents there. But I do agree that he really only has one ability and one way to play him, which makes him easy to learn but overall kind of unrewarding in the long run. He definitely need a buff, but his basic premise isn‚Äôt completely without merit.
---
Once again, you're letting your expectations cloud your judgement. 
---
Whether you are killed, sacrificed, or escape, the ending screen is identical bar the word. It's just your survivor running. Same with Killer. Whether you get a 4k or nothing, the end result is the same. 
---
The only metric you have to judge your performance on is your emblems, and they encourage you to take your time and engage.
---
Fair enough. Just thought i‚Äôd add something in so you can improve instead of just saying ‚Äúit looks good‚Äù and nothing else. Hope you have a good day!
---
sloppy is better
---
Thanks, you too man
---
Not just the nurse and been a little longer than ghostface. Try having this bug against a legion and you cant mend or be mended
---
is the ranking still completly random?
---
Yeah I'm aware, but a good survivor also know to abandon a loop as soon as Pig roars. This happens most of the time when I use the ambush gimmick in high levels. Best this to do is crouch, roar, cancel charge, stand, and follow them as they abandon the loop. If her move speed transition speed stayed the same post and pre crouch it wouldn't change this dynamic, just improve her mind game potential.
---
Adept mode Jake = immersed survivor who also stops themself from being hooked. I‚Äôd be shaking in my boots.
---
Damn I want that, but swf would ruin it :( you could just go "Hey guys, is one of you David?" "No" Then they run
---
It's even more fun doing it through the glass in Hawkins and watching them all freak the fuck out
---
This exactly! I really hate that I can barely escape her and she can lunge practically around trees when I try to get her to hit something instead of me. She gets so much mobility on such a low cooldown ignoring all obstacles, and I still get hit on the opposite side of a tree because she can lunge like every other killer?
---
It's bullshit, personally.
---
Also a generic lol at matchmaking.
---
Rank 2 solo survivors get paired with rank 15-20 survivors even before the free weekends, and against rank 18-20 killers.
---
Every heard of getting gen rushes?
---
But why would they even all go in there. I feel like they had it coming.
---
Trapper for sure, thats what the hooks are in his body are from i reckon
---
Yeah, but 4-party swfs aren‚Äôt too terribly common. Mostly it‚Äôs 2 or 3
---
Why the heck would that be banable. Don't listen to the turds at the end game screen who will tell you literally everything you did that game was banable.
---
Unrelenting, Monitor &amp; Abuse, Dying Light, Pop Goes The Weasel. Bloody Hair Brooch and Rusty Flute for add ons. I know Prayer Beads is strongest but relying on purple add ons is gonna cost a lot of BP
---
&gt; Idk why but it feels like this community is extra toxic
---
I play many other competitive/semi-competitive games and it really isn't worse than those, maybe just a bit different. 
---
One thing I've noticed is that console games, dbd is no exclusion, tend to always be a little bit more childish. What I mean by that is you'll get more racist comments and dead threaths and less "criticism" think something like "Why do you run this or do this, [slur] noob!!". (DbD, Fortnite, CoD etc.)
---
PC-only games tend to have more of this "criticism" and less childish flame. (LoL, DoTa, CS:GO etc.)
---
This holds true both ingame and on the forums/reddit.
---
I played a game where everyone had the exit gates open, I had just hooked someone, and all three came up right behind me trying to save on the hook. I got called out for camping when I walked away with a 3k
---
I prefer a Bad Touch.
---
Why?
---
Because you and me baby, we're nothing but mammals, so let's Mori like Hattori (Hanzo) did some Japanese nobles.
---
Slash and Stab, Y'all.
---
You and me baby, we're entity fodder, so let's kill and be killed like a nightmarish cycle.
---
Playing the Wraith at red ranks gives me depression lol
---
&gt;That would be all well and good if survivors got that memo too.
---
Did you miss this part?
---
&gt;It works the same way for survivors too. If survivors just gen rush and finish the trail without engaging the killer at all, their scores aren't going to look good are they?
---
As long as either side doesn't get the game, or opts to play against the encouraged style of play, it'll be a problem.
---
NOED is made to reward killers who have been bad all game
---
I had this Claudette try to Kobe, enter struggle on her first hook while I'm nowhere near, lead me to her SWF (it was just a two-man SWF, and two solos) and get downed, DS me, unhook them, go down again, I let the other one go, hook the Claudette.
---
And where is this Dwight she unhooked? Standing in front of a locker, just went into the main building near a generator to stand in front of a locker. Could have run, could have hid, I wasn't tunneling him and only had a general idea of direction, though I was checking if he was still in the area before returning to patrol generators.
---
And then he hops inside the locker and I have to leave him or take the DS hit.
---
Like what the fuck?
---
\&gt; Didn't camp, left the hook until the next survivor led me back.
---
\&gt; Didn't tunnel the guy, let him run away instead of slugging.
---
\&gt; Didn't try to focus him down, went into an area with a generator to resume patrolling after looking around to see if he was dumb.
---
\&gt; He jumps into a locker and DSes me.
---
DS should deactivate if I hook someone else first unless you're slugged, it pisses me off that someone who could have healed and hid and escaped because I wasn't tunneling, still hits me with an anti-tunnel perk.
---
Borrowed Time pisses me off when I turn my back and move 5 meters away and then the unhook happens, I'm not camping, I was literally unable to leave, why does BT proc?
---
Maybe they just really dont like their picture being taken?
---
But seriously, they are just salty.  Makes for some fun times if you only took a green mori and you cancel the animation once to see if they dc so you can use it o  the next survivor.
---
Didn't realize how much I wanted this until now..
---
You pointing out the problem doesn't fix it.
---
okay but I love this!
---
Thats some rtx ray tracing right there
---
Once again you are missing the point.
---
If you remove the ranking system, only win condition is killing everyone or escaping alive. People are complaining because there is a disconnect between the game, ranking system and the theme. You are saying this disconnection doesn't exist because there is an obscure piece of lore written somewhere.
---
I'm not even sure what you are trying to argue at this point.
---
*Happy Cannibal noises*
---
It's also bugged rn because I was doing a custom, downed one, surge proced on a gen another was working on, they stayed on gen and my surveillance was stuck to white and the gen wasn't regressing along with me not being able to hit it.
---
I agree to some point, but if generators to really spread out, you‚Äôve screwed your self
---
I've witnessed magic right here
---
dude if ur getting all ur gens done in 6 minutes, you‚Äôre the problem. you aren‚Äôt applying any pressure at all at that point,
---
Nope,  ive even spawned at the top of the stairs as a killer and noticed there were no gens up there.
---
All Stealth killers have their own list of design goals and Wraith hasn‚Äôt fully achieved his
---
Pig is slightly visible (she can walk around the map crouching). She‚Äôs slower when stealthed, but she gets up quickly, has an ambush charge and has her RBTs which cause others to waste time and run around the map
---
Myers is stealthy without being stralthy. He has a low terror radius and an actually scary ability. He keeps you looking around all the time and if you let him look at you for long enough, he‚Äôll go on a killing spree. He needs a moment to go out from his tier 1 tho (But he‚Äôs immune to all detection tools when in tier 1)
---
Ghost Face can straight up turn his terror radius off and is quite similar to Myers. He‚Äôs all about finding the right angles to sneak up on you unnoticed. He can also instadown you if he looks at you from the stealth for long enough, but you can also break him up by looking at him.
---
Demogorgon isn‚Äôt a stealth killer, but either side interacting with his portals lets him sneak up on you, as it turns off your terror radius
---
Doctor can also be a budget Myers with the right perks and add-ons, disabling his terror radius almost completely 
---
And here we have the first stealth killer, The Wraith. As the first killer of this kind, he wasn‚Äôt really thought out. He can turn invisible and get a SLIGHT speed boost to help you sneak up on you and a speed boost right after uncloaking. He will also turn fully invisible when standing still for a few seconds. What are his downsides? His invisibility still makes him visible, even across the map, especially because his model is so top-heavy. You announce that you‚Äôre here, uncloaking takes a lot of time and on top of all that, he can get ‚Äúlightburned‚Äù. Pointing your flashlight at any part of his body when he‚Äôs cloaked will stun him for a few seconds. His addons let him fix some of his issues but never all of them
---
There are too many NOED users who cant apply any pressure over survivors it seems. So sir, i beg you to stand down before they puke all of their anger on you
---
Lit
---
Oh yes totally if I get in a Chase end it and 3 generators done that's my fault? How am I  supposed to apply pressure in a Chase? I go against survivors that don't even care that there's a teammate hooked they just rush the generators and leave. There's so many factors in this game not just oh a bunch of generators are getting done it must be your fault then.
---
Ruin isn't strong at high ranks/thousands of hours where you can hit Greats though, the 2% bonus per Great it denies is a pathetic fraction.
---
That's where the gameplay really needs further adjusting, BHVR likes to say SWF die a lot but I sincerely doubt that applies at rank 1 against anything that isn't Nurse.
---
When you use a program to make everyone lag except yourself.
---
No dude noed is there as the only 2nd chance perk for killer, I play survivor and while my team gen rush I look at the killer play style, if I see him struggle I go for totems cause usually killer who struggle early=noed the way I see it is if survivors leave totems and the killer end up having noed is their fault, I play both side and the only thing that annoys me is when the gens goes that quick I am not able to cleanse all the totems and I get noed.
---
I mean, medkits don‚Äôt work but keep in mind that if anyone other than yourself heals the injured player - second wind does __not__ activate.
---
&gt;They won‚Äôt even be on the generator when they hear the terror radius they‚Äôll be running to pallets and loops,
---
If they won't be on generators with a heartbeat, how are generators being done too fast? Seems to me this is just a "you" problem rather than gen speed.
---
Yea I know I'm just a little salty as I just want to enjoy the new killer but I'm getting alot of great survivor players so that's partially why I'm salty right now and need I mention matchmaking pairing me with people way below my rank or way above
---
A lag switch is a device that slows down or temporarily pauses traffic to the internet. In terms of dbd the killer is always the host of a match (until dedicated servers arrive) and in some rare cases (usually in pc but can still be found on console) they might do this to gain an unfair advantage as it stops survivors from doing anything briefly while the killer is free to do whatever in that time. Usually and in your case it's just crappy internet, but it does still occur and is a bannable offense I think (the lagswitching, not lagging or bad internet lol)
---
A bored killer thinking of survivor perks?! This is blasphemy! Lol jk I like it
---
Had a legion that went hard and face camped with two people and 5 gens unfinished, like boi calm down neither of us are getting bloodpoints
---
That‚Äôs me as killer sucks your teammates dc but I still need these kills
---
We all do
---
Yeah it‚Äôs frustrating it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt have to sweat your ass off lmao
---
im gonna start poking booty now starting with jane
---
Ahha, I play both 50/50 and I have mixed opinions on both sides when it comes to arguments/discussions
---
I'm so torn about that sub because on one hand they're the Greatest Meme but on the other hand I saw Hag sucking dick and it destroyed my conception of the universe
---
My personal go to is Franklin‚Äôs, BBQ, NOED, And Bamboozle.
---
Idk if it was my first, but I got a pallet save the other day and I felt like a boss.
---
I ran a Sweaty bubba around and my friend got 3 gens done then I got face camped of course then my friend finished all the gens because I didn‚Äôt kill myself then he got hatch with a key and it was just 2 of us
---
Sometimes when I play Killer I make sure (if I have to) to sacrifice generators near incredibly strong loops just to avoid those being the last generators in the trial.
---
Plague, like most Killers, can't afford to check every single hiding spot around a generator and it takes her a long time to break someone again if there are good obstacles.
---
The important thing to remember from a survivor perspective is that a prolonged trial is only effective if the killer accomplishes something in that extra time.
---
A SWF who spends five years evading around the map and never getting seen/never getting afk crows, never getting injured or infected or hooked, but not doing any generators either, doesn't give the killer an advantage.
---
So it's been five years and a generator hasn't popped, what does it matter without a hook? It doesn't.
---
Plague is like that, she can get corrupt purge a billion times, but she still has to patrol the generators, default generator regression is useless, and if the survivors just immerse then she didn't gain anything during the corrupt purge and lost her tracking/ambush advantage.
---
It's not a bad idea but locker spammers are usually trolls.
---
Yes but it‚Äôs unnecessary to like try really hard when there is only 2 ya know
---
Oof hope I don't get banned
---
What do you mean by "Only you can perform skillchecks" and "Your skillchecks are synchronized"?
---
Let's assume that 2 survivors+you with Technician work on a single gen.
---
Does this mean that skillchecks will only happen for you while the others don't get to interact with the check but just see it?
---
Or do your three skillchecks happen all at the same time, potentially resulting in 3 generator explosions?
---
I sweat to finish the match so we can move on at that point
---
If I do is there a way to lift the ban?
---
I can understand that point but I‚Äôve faced bubbas that are super toxic after they end the game and they just say gg EZ
---
I had 1 afk guy and 1 DC in a game and it was just me and a friend with 4 gens left, we just gave up and the killer had the audacity to ask "wtf is wrong with you"
---
What a cock. 
---
And aside from manners, that‚Äôs how the game stays alive. You want new people. Pulling in Stranger Things fans is exactly why they did the crossover. More players, more money, both are good for the game. 
---
What an ass.
---
Nah. Hopper is dope but Bob is a star trek red shirt if there ever was.
---
I knew the second they introduced him it was so he could die
---
I‚Äôve been healed, simply running the killer and caused more than one killer DC already. It‚Äôs very strong. I would say more than almost all perks except DS and Adrenaline. Combine it with deliverance to save yourself at the right time and it‚Äôs incredibly strong.
---
harder? more like it shows how unbalanced some things are
---
You literally got the points for killer stun too. That‚Äôs depressing.
---
oooooo you stupid :DDDDDDE XDXDXDXD lolololol
---
Her default crouch is faster so straps aren't needed all the time. New straps reduce crouch by .3 seconds to make it like old crouch time.
---
Finally someone who can actually think of good perks, this Is way better than most of the perks concepts people make on here
---
I feel this way about Ghostface. He‚Äôs always right on top of me and I can hear his little feet just running behind me.
---
you simply wont get banned, but probably flamed
---
But my rule book your supposed to follow my made up rules GARBAGE KILLER FACE CAMPER CHASE SPAMER KILLER MAIN OP KILLER PLAYING TOXIC BUTT HEAD
---
What a good way to start my morning.
---
How to have a fun viable build without including ruin:
---
Step 1: Don't include ruin.
---
Step 2: Don't play like a donkey.
---
Congratulations! You just learned how to not RUIN a build!
---
Yes but playing red and purple rank is a lot better than playing grey and yellow rank
---
I'll spend a few minutes farming and probably show the survivors where Ruin is if they haven't found it.
---
If they have toolboxes, two survivors can tag-team the five generators and still pop them (yes, all five) in 2.5 minutes, maybe 3 minutes without toolboxes, it's easy enough to max out chase points and two-hook them each and go around playing with your power for deviousness and still get a pip and good bloodpoints out of it without taking more than 5\~ minutes.
---
Aw man. What a shame. I kept accidentally opening a locker instead of picking up a survivor today until I remembered I just needed to face the opposite way...
---
Killers ping goes to the servers reaction time since they are the host survivors pings are only their action time. distance doesn't matter as long as the serversreaction time is good.
---
Yeah they're usually op
---
I want the story to be viewed from a new  survivor   point of view. I want this survivor to be a person from the 21st century and would be like Thomas from maze runner.
---
Any killer suggestion would be great
---
Balanced landing, in my opinion, is better only because you also get reduced fall stun. This makes certain loops damn near infinite on some maps. 
---
Dead hard is really good for prolonging a chase by getting you through the next pallet or vault. The really good thing is that this is procced by an active ability button instead of by a condition so you can use it whenever you need to.
---
Both are solid choices. Just really depends on how you want to play.
---
Dead hard is the overall winner for being able to use it anywhere while Balanced is super close for having a ton of use from its passive ability. Together they work really well at giving you different options for escape routes. I personally run adrenaline along with them (granted most would warn you off using 3 exhaustion abilities) and have rather good luck doing so.
---
The Entity tortures killers that don't want to work for it.
---
Ewwww, how dare the GAYS appear in media!  Grrr!
---
I guess survivors should just throw themselves at the killer
---
üòáüåû and have a great day
---
K thanks
---
Ghostface, plague, and bubba
---
What is devotion anyway?
---
Ruin has made me a master at hitting greater skill checks, thanks all killers for running it.  I am being serious too
---
This is the first time I've ever seen a Trollhunters meme on an unrelated subreddit and I was caught really off guard
---
i dont even know üòÇ my kitchen got remodeled a little while ago so that might be why mines in there üòÇ
---
Lol
---
Then run gen-defence perks...
---
I like Ghostface. No heavy breathing or sound effects.
---
I accidentally found this photo in my gallery and the idea popped in my head
---
RTX off and on
---
Purple ranks = best ranks
---
My feelings are quite hurt. But it is ok! I forgive u ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
It's a great meme lmao, wasn't expecting it but the format is great
---
I hate how good your fucking skins are &gt;;(
---
Last minute switch to a blendette or legacy with a flashlight.
---
My skins are pretty good ngl,  who do u main tho?
---
Considering "Death is not an escape", the survivor would be up against multiple killers at different variables.
---
As if farm is a bad spirit map. Lmao
---
Both are good. I tend to avoid dead hard though because I am terrible at timing it. I always use it too soon or too late.
---
Balanced landing fits better with my play style. And the passive reduced fall stun is A1.
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main, but to have to fun I play... Leg-... Demo or Trapper
---
Same here, since the engine update I‚Äôm smashing though ruin, I don‚Äôt even look for it anymore I wait for a teammate to find it.
---
Try a big killer radius doctor build on the game. Add the perk that makes skills checks harder after each hook and you are in for a treat.
---
This is really awesome! I like your style.
---
I swear, *every* day we have the ‚ÄúYou do that? I bring mori‚Äù meme.
---
You won't get banned for bad internet, don't worry. Hopefully when dedicated servers come out lagswitching and accusations of it are a thing of the past
---
Demo is B and his perks are as a whole C. They are fairly situational, but surge is an amazing perk and works extremely well for gen protector builds, Cruel Confinement is a niche little perk which can really help easily catch survivors after a gen pops (for instance in cowshed and gas haven) and Mindbreaker is pretty funny to use and is a hard counter to sprint burst and dead hard allowing for easy first hits on people on gens.
---
Swfs let's ruin people's fun.
---
This is the problem with this game. The aysmetrical theme constantly puts 2 sides against eachother. Why can't we all just play and have fun. Who cares if the killer runs noed you can counter it easily. Please stop complaining about noed its ruining this subreddit even more.

Is it just me or does his reflection look like walter
---
Dude dont try to argue here, its hopeless ;)
---
You a console player?
---
Nurse is just zzzzz. People complain about Spirit forcing 50/50s but Nurse just turns the entire game into guessing which direction she's going to chain blink around a LoS blocker.
---
They might also be running it if they have a hit-list for survivors, or maybe they all brought flashlights or other items.
---
sadly, yea. I started ljke basically everyone else, when they made it free for PSN members for a month
---
Next dlc: play as Australian cat ghost
---
I feel like it would be cool but I also think that blade is so dirty that it won't reflect anything
---
Aye thats valid. I started on console as well in like 2017 but switched to PC and the beginning of last year.
---
I‚Äôd play a lot more of DBD is I had friends who played
---
can we share links here
---
Lol I didn‚Äôt realize how to do lunge attacks (just holding the attack button) when I first started playing. I used to just get real close and just tap them. As you might guess, I didn‚Äôt win too often.
---
Doesn‚Äôt it take like 90 seconds with paired with deliverance?
---
It is the killers job to kill so even if there are dc‚Äôs, you shouldn‚Äôt expect him/her to let you escape
---
Neat, but I don't think it fits the artstyle of the game. The game's engine doesn't include many natural reflections, so having one very clear and specific reflection might be odd.
---
Don‚Äôt know, a friend send me it
---
Same rank. I use it to get devious points or to mix up once they catch onto my mind game. Aside from that it's not something I use constantly. Better to stand, use the temporary stealth post crouch, and just gen grab people than to ambush. Shorter CD if you just smack anyway.
---
Yes that is true, I never said to let us go but to at least not try so hard to kill only 2 people
---
I've started even replacing adrenaline with inner strength in a normal meta build to see how it does, and it's definitely nice and more usable than adrenaline, but not as clutch
---
Just make the bone clapper and the fast break add-on a part of his base kit. And cut the slow down he has coming out of stealth. And honestly just make him fully invisible while walking around. Instant viability
---
If I was killer I would mess with them for a bit then actually kill them because if you‚Äôre a survivor and a killer really tries that‚Äôs just boring
---
Very very valid. I play with my group of friends all the time and its a fuckin blast lol. If you ever need console people to play with, DBD forums usually has a place where you can ask and people join hella fast lol.
---
He would have to hold his knife to his face. The way he holds it it would be impossible. Also thats a clean knife if he is able to see your reflection
---
Edit: his
---
And he suddenly sees Nea behind his back
---
No
---
Seems to be a lot of that going around. Lol
---
PS4 dbd is having a meltdown right now. Constantly getting kicked from my groups, always some error, infinite loading screens. Ive been having to restart my app at least once everytime I play.
---
Imagine that with NOED and ToTH on Demogorgon lol
---
I don‚Äôt really have a dog in this race, but I do want to make people aware of the change to dying light. It was reworked to an incremental perk, but they have it such a hard nerf. Previous version gave you 25% penalty on all survivors after the obsession is dead. Current version grants 3% penalty on non-obsession survivors for each non obsession hook. The perk also only works while the obsession is alive. So, the max the perk can give is 18% penalty on 3 survivors. After that, you can get 21% on 2 and 24% on one. Meanwhile, the obsession gets nothing but benefits. The obsession is unaffected by the penalty and receives a bonus 33% to healing others.
---
Old dying light could be achieved after one hook, granting 25% penalty for the rest of the game. New dying light doesn‚Äôt even do that for one survivor, maxing out at 24% and requiring the obsession to be alive. 
---
I am happy to see them give the perk an adjustment, but dying light didn‚Äôt need a nerf.
---
Don‚Äôt twist my words. I‚Äôm saying that everyone hates that one immersed survivor and she deserved to lose(since she wouldn‚Äôt do anything), not that she deserved no bp because the game itself held her hostage.
---
if your on PC and have Nvidia GPU you can turn on color blind mode in geforce experience , filters.
---
I mean you ain‚Äôt wrong lol. I play Pig, Wraith and Plague and i can always get 2 sacrifices per game where Plague i can get 4ks fairly frequently, pig if i play decent i can get 4k and Wraith 4ks are like 1 in every 6-7 games lol
---
The hooks are to make him feel pain in general so he's enraged I think his default torso piece says as much
---
Look at them, they come to this place when they know they are not pure.
---
r/TIHI
---
Tbh if you are in a game for 80 seconds and have put 0 pressure on any survivors you kinda deserve that.

Oh yeah, make him angry to kill

Can confirm the camping.

Actually had this happen to me. Killer said he didn‚Äôt care and he guy had a really sweaty build.
---
No....some killers are clearly and objectively better than others and can be ranked.
---
what happened to it preventing explosions :(

With Goodbye Horses playing at the title screen.
---
Iron maidon
---
Why didn't this shitstorm happen with Creed Syndicate, but rather the opposite. People instead loved the Ripper DLC in that game if anything and even complained that he should've been playable even more according to reviews. Same thing with Identity V and their use of the Ripper. Both extremely popular games at their peak. So I'm curious what do you think of that.
---
my pp just got hard because of that head on
---
I feel like the only change they should make is that 2 people healing would count. Otherwise, pretty good perk.
---
Reflections are hard to do and intensive. Most mirrors in games are broken/cloudy/dirty and don‚Äôt reflect. Shiny surfaces that look reflective often just map fake reflections of a skybox and don‚Äôt actually reflect the game world.
---
Killer of women rights
---
micheal should have chosen jane. meg looks like a goblin
---
I love this community, so friendly and accepting regardless of skill level. Brings a year to my eye.
---
That's a garbage benefit of the perk. It you fail a skill check you simply fail it and that's on you.
---
I think in regards to a killer pairing your survivor yould have to find a theme to apply like they try to do on chapters. Like demise of the faithfull was on how both killer and survivor were led astray by faith ended up in the entitys realm. I hope im making sense
---
I‚Äôve had it happen a few times too. I affectionately call it the useless bug because you normally can‚Äôt use dead hard or be healed by teammates when it happens, making you somewhat useless
---
Being able to see where the killer is after getting unhooked is actually pretty good, but the only thing that makes it not so good is the fact you can only use it up to 2 times per match.
---
As a survivor that is about to get downed because she is phasing right next to me to,  i can confirm
---
Nah it's definitely a reference to Halloween. Laurie was babysitting and had to fight off the Boogeyman. No way it's just a coincidence.
---
Prestige 3, you can get it when you get a character to level 50 and it gives you a bloody version of their default cosmetics.
---
great value spirit right here
---
Oh okay. Just didn't know the abbreviation
---
Now it ain‚Äôt that simple, sometimes the survivors are altruistic, and you can take advantage for that, or you need a kill to stop the gens. Usually you need a kill by the time there‚Äôs two gens left to have a good game unless you have a good late game clutch with noed or something like that. Camping on first hook is useless (unless they are close to 2nd state). I can agree that it‚Äôs useless then. But survivors also have other objectives than gens. Totems, healing, chests and more. Totems should be a priority because of noed but if you just gen rush, you are likely going to be punished for not cleansing the totems. Also not all survivors will cut their losses making it easier for the killer.
---
I'd be down for Jim the Tearer inspired killer lol. But I still think they should make one exception and only one for Jack The Ripper. He's just one of those real life killers that will do great imo.
---
Yea, so many jukes indeed...
---
I don't know the technicalities, I just know that it is not stable. So I guess a lot of signals are weaker than -67 dBm.
---
BUTTTTT what if there was a time where you failed a skillcheck and died because of it. and you would have lived if you had techi- yeah okay its garbage
---
Dead Hard. People just don't use it right. You don't use dead for dodging 1 hit, you use it to get to pallets/windows that you wouldn't have been able to reach.   
---
How many times have you been downed right in front of/under a pallet or in front of/during a window vault? Too many to count. You use it to get a pallet/window slightly faster. Even if they know you have it, who cares. They can't stop it.
---
I think it would be something like
---
"years in the dark" with a a killer using some kind of 21st century technology to track survivors
---
Bc old DS wouldve been super broken if it was exhaustion. And new DS wouldnt make sense as exhaustion imo. Plus if it was exhaustion youd be able to use it 2 times a game and I would hate to see constant posts about how it needs to be nerfed again
---
The slow didn't negate his speed boost, it just made it so you can't get free hits by constantly cloaking and uncloaking without penalty.
---
Dude, I got to rank 1 without Ruin by using nothing but Bubba and pre-rework Fred. I never run it because 80% of the time it gets destroyed instantly and you're down a perk slot all game. It's all about optimizing the chase as much as you can and keeping pressure on as much as you can. 
---
*However,* the only Killer I **do** run Ruin on is Trapper because I feel he literally needs it due to how long his "setup" is.
---
What if that's the killer's inner monologue justifying their actions?
---
It would be cool to make the killer and surcivor a foil to eachother. Like the survivor is this uber like milenial/gen z person with their way around electronics and modern thinking, while the killer is like a dark ages fanatic that uses imagery from them for his power and aesthetic. It woild fit with the theme "years in the dark" too.Ofcourse thats just my opinion i may not be your target audience.
---
If you‚Äôve ever seen Montos video, try the Russian roulette build with nurse on the game
---
Can i ask how do you counter noed so easily
---
I honestly really want a workshop so custom perks can finally be officially supported
---
If 2 people DC then I'll just kill 1 of the remaining 2 and possibly the other one if he doesn't find hatch. No point in wasting any time in that match when you'll get more BP in a real one.
---

Alienating it to being a issue on majorly one side is the reason for toxicity to begin with. the ‚Äúus versus them‚Äù mentality is really bad on this sub.

---
I meant i thought people where talking about removing the upside down part of teleporting and instantly teleporting from one to another. Thats why i said that would be removing the upside down where he lives/is from. I read the thread wrong
---
I teabag twice to say thanks if a killer lets me escape
---
Every game is going to be different so I can't just say do totems. In the case that you have a coordinated swf you can get one person to distract the killer while a gate or 2 gets opened. Then if you have any leftover hooks after noed gets cleansed by one of your buddies you can safely unhook them with borrowed time and get out hopefully.
---
This obviously won't work every time but it's possible to counter noed easily I think and I know most people can do it.
---
The voice over in this video is extremely dry but the content on running loops, (basically what all survivors do during chases) is really helpful. [video here](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=9Jrv7TQYg5U)
---
I play console so I wouldn't know but Billy and nurse are a solid S from what I've heard
---
Wow you are one salty and condescending guy.
---
Where did I say that Infectious Fright is bad? I never did. I just said that with BBQ and Nurse, plus my game knowledge, I‚Äôll know the approximate position of every survivor at most times. I feel I don‚Äôt need Infectious Fright, but if you do, it‚Äôs your call mate.
---
Then again, if you wish to double pip at rank 2 or 3 against top SFW team, you‚Äôll need gen slowing perks or the two first gen will pop (that‚Äôs mathematic, four survivors, each on a gen, needs 80 second. Let‚Äôs say you do 20 second to find the first one, 10 second to down him, 10 second to bring to hook, then 10 second to find the second guy, and 10 second again to down and 10 to hook again, 80 seconds are gone and 2 gen are done by the 2 remaining survivors, and it is with the absolute perfect timings.
---
With two gen pop in less than 2 minutes, it is extremely likely you won‚Äôt get red gatekeeper. 
---
With Ruin, no gen have popped, and survivor genrush less and go for the save immediately instead of popping gens before saving. 
---
I‚Äôve played enough to know that gen slowing perks are not needed to win (hell to win you don‚Äôt need any perks on Nurse), but they are very useful when it comes to rank up.
---
Ofc I could play Infectious Fright in place of Nurse‚Äôs Calling or BBQ, but I think it would be less useful.
---
The message is, if I played Infectious Fright in place of Ruin, I would not win more games, but I would pip less on some games I win. So Infectious Fright is not useful to me
---
If you need 4 information perks to win on nurse, it‚Äôs your problem. I don‚Äôt need as much to know where surv are, that‚Äôs all. However, I do need the gen slowing perks to prevent the first gen to pop in the 2nd minute and to have the red gatekeeper emblem.
---
Blame the dcs, dc= less hooks= less chance to pip, I will make sure u don‚Äôt make gens so I get iri gen protector, but I am gonna let the guys get safe unhooks. I try hard more when ppl dc than normal.
---
That could be a red addon tho?
---
&gt; When you use a program to make everyone lag except yourself.
---
It can also be a physical switch if on a peer to peer connection. On some games the host just by pulling their Ethernet out for 3 seconds can lag switch.
---
niceee
---
He's not wrong
---
why would you need a Tier list tho?
---
Every Killer is able to do "good", also I would see which Killer is more fun, or the Games gets boring really fast
---
Thanks
---
Got 'em!
---
Purple + Yellow "Calm" add-ons + Monitor and Abuse give you a total of 20 meters reduction
---
the base value is 32, so you it gives you 12m, which is basicly the same terror radius as his shock range with either a brown or yellow range add-on. No one will have enough time to react to that
---
Same killers? I wonder if you'd know any of us here on reddit from the game then? ü§î
---
r/okbuddyholly
---
but that would only be a pointless nerf lol
---
I think Balanced Landing has the biggest potential upside out of any exhaustion perk as the strength of the reduced fall stagger just opens up so many more possibilities for looping and potential routes during chases.  Balanced Landing at its best extends a chase far more than any Dead Hard could.  I think it also has one of the worst floors for usefulness though, good luck getting much/any value on Shelter Woods.
---
Dead Hard is more consistently reliable and map independent, even if its upside is not as high as the potential upside of BL.  Dead Hard is pretty dependable and can be a real lifesaver.
---
Personally I prefer BL, partly just because it feels much more fun to use but also the frequency which Dead Hard just doesn't work makes it rather frustrating at times.
---
To clarify, I didn‚Äôt mean it needed to be some crazy real time reflection, just a brief glimmer of whatever ‚Äúhead‚Äù you have equipped regardless of your surroundings. It doesn‚Äôt have to be real time reflecting all of your surroundings or direct head movement! I just thought it was odd how Michael twisted his knife around after a hit, and figured if you saw his gaze in the reflection, it could instead look more like he‚Äôs inspecting his weapon. My apologies if it seemed like I was being needlessly demanding!
---
It's not normal. The devs are working on it now I believe. Hang in there lol.
---
You dont need anything to maintain Red ranks as nurse, to make you say shit like that makes you just a bad nurse, but dont worry, you will get better eventually
---
&gt; No, it‚Äôs not because it‚Äôs mostly the same killers
---
Why then?
---
THIS GAME IS PERRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRFECT AND I LOVE IT ITS MY LORD AND SAVIOR
---
Because we aren‚Äôt children..
---
Too early should've stayed in green/purple until this weekend. Red Ranks during bp events are something else...
---
Or you know you could just not be dick for the sake of not being a dick?
---
So why do people on PC do it?
---
Happening to me and my friend too, kinda game breaking.
---
Yeah I'm not understanding the point either. I mean it would make it so you couldnt use an exhaustion perk after hitting DS, but DS is already kinda meh. Doesnt need more nerfs imo
---
Yeah but then you will hear also thunder/Halloween music too
---
Finally, a Killer that can delete loop spots from the map by placing a literal wall.
---
You are putting words in my mouth at every comment you make, and you seem quite angry. Calm down mate.
---
I don‚Äôt rely on them. They reduce the grind by turning pips into double pips.
---
You can play Infectious Fright, so that you can end the game at the first good Slug opportunity you have, it‚Äôs fine. You probably won‚Äôt double pip either because it was a very fast game and they did 2/3 gens in 3minute, like what good survivors do or/and you didn‚Äôt get iri devout because some surv died on first hook.
---
I prefer to draw out the game a little longer to get more hooks, while preventing that more than 1 gen be done, so that I consistently double pip.
---
And bonus is I get more Bp
---
Adrenaline is not relevant, they do not get to that point. My strat leave them with no option: gens are slow to do at the beginning, and after I put too much pressure for them to do gens. If they want to heal, it‚Äôs long and I can see them, if they donlt want to heal, I can 1shot them, and spot them very easily with BBQ or my ears (which why I don‚Äôt need IF, i spot close survivors with my ears).
---
&gt; Rank doesnt mean anything,
---
That's not the point. Replace the words rank 1 for best. I'm saying with Bubba there is a hard limit to your skill. One that is much lower than nurses for example.
---
Hope you get a large open map and patrol gens at the speed of light
---
oh lmao, I thought your previous comments were getting cleared by reports or something, not you deleting them.
---
All this does is make me wonder how much you actually play killer. Even with ruin up gens can go quickly when facing survivors who have played for a long time. With ruin out you can kiss your first two gens goodbye.
---
Trust Exent , like i said , i bought a new mouse ,and the problem persists.
---
When it comes to The Plague, I imagine she worships the Entity as her god now. She may not want to kill people of her own volition, but her God wants her to so she does it.
---
I mean idk what particular loops your talking about. If every survior went down in 30 seconds or less killers will 4k everygame.
---
The point of corrupt is leaving only 3 gens active; you go to protect/hunt around those.
---
It is connected correctly .
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/ There you go!

---
I'm buying a 2080ti soon so yes, Ray tracing in DBD please.

For real though the game struggles to run well even now, can you imagine if they started adding in real time reflections.
---
Well , 2 people did understand me o.o
---
[Original video.](https://youtu.be/oiuyhxp4w9I)
---
That‚Äôs not a logical conclusion simply because it‚Äôs an implication you want to read. 
---
The logical conclusion you should have arrived at is: 
---
People, regardless of anything else, who do not teabag, do not do so because, they are not children.
---
If you want to go a step farther, you may even arrive at:
---
People, regardless of anything else, who do teabag, do so because, they are children. 
---
But again, I cannot speak to why people do teabag, as I do not, because... I‚Äôm not a child.
---
Not really ive played fine as huntress with my controller. All those years of CoD hitboxes prepared me for this lmao
---
I literally only play killer.
---
I don't play for pips tho, which is why my guide is flawed.
---
Facecamping and ignoring everyone else just to kill the person who just got off hook
---
only if you had BB&amp;C
---
There's a perk for that.
---
And it was a Laurie which made it even better for me
---
i disagree demogorgen is a lot of fun to play.
---
I'm still hoping we get Blumhouse Mike for Halloween 2019. Or Rob Zombie mountainman-myers.
---
Because they‚Äôre asshats man. Dont let em get to you. Im a ps4 killer too
---
So you are saying it is impossible to reach rank 1 with Bubba?
---
I think the aura reading is pretty cool as you can see if the killer is coming back, so you have time to be healed. But apart from that the hook breaking isn‚Äôt very helpful to you and your team. I like to run this perk with we‚Äôll make it, wglf and aftercare
---
That's a great idea but I fell like a killer with technology is all that I really want in the game and putting a survivor from the dark ages would make a lot of interactions that I wanted to be in. For example  Dwight says " a new one has come blah blah etc, so where are you from?"
---
"I'm from blank city. how long have you been here?" "idk I came here in 1987 (or whatever is the right date) when did you?""you've been here since 1987?!? It's 2019 now
---
And if I may add, they have Leatherface also who is confirmed by the creator to be loosely based off Ed Gein. But anyway, why didn't the unnecessary political intrusion happen to the recent games that used the Ripper, Identity V and Creed Syndicate? Why were they excused from this and did amazingly well? Both games were pretty popular at their peak.
---
Well that's a nightmare to any killer but the nurse tbh
---
Or have a username like doc or I blend
---
Invader zim vibes from this.
---
Demogorgon: i'm 'bout to ruin this mans whole career
---
People still play Ash? Weird. His perks are all butthole tier
---
Legion and Billy on B Tier and Trapper and Freddy on C Tier in my opinion.
---
Leather face should be best camper lol
---
I just kill whos left to get the game over with.
---
Fuck bro the counter is hoping that the only person i find isnt the injured survivor that i didnt know had ds? Shit bro im such a fucking tunneler
---
Surprised hatch wasn't on that basement of the Preschool XD
---
It's boring playing the game as intended? Lol.
---
The sad thing is the demogorgon only gets to nibble the survivors meaning he stays hungry most of the time I think while Hag just devours them. Poor demogorgon will always stay hungry
---
Freddy b tier?
---
What
---
Thank Blood Warden for that
---
I guess you should learn to use perks other then ruin or sloppy, but that's fine you will learn someday, they are like baby's training wheels
---
Oh and i dont give a single fuck about pipa or bloodpoints, the shorter the game is the more shards i get, and that's where the actual value is, i find it quite funny and pathetic at the same time you value artificial rank that gives no benefits, thats really cute
---
I guess that‚Äôs fair enough. A lot of people, myself included, enjoy the sense of progression that comes with a ranking system but I can‚Äôt assume everyone feels the same.
---
They probably only play him for the quotes at the start of matches. I enjoy hearing "Look who's shitting in the tall grass." Even though I don't own him
---
Olympic athletes do it all the time to win, it's a valid strategy
---
Only a bad leatherface camps.
---
The stalker watches/ Hunting unknowing prey/ Oh wait Decisive
---
Isn‚Äôt it already lower than other killers‚Äô normal lunge?
---
That's real nice
---
The same thing happened to my friend last night, and the dropped off and respawned right next to the hatch.
---
I wish they would not make killer host it's like why would u make the person that would benefit off of lag the most host.
---
Probably
---
Yeah I have him P II but Bill and Steve have come around on console since then, so he‚Äôs put away for now.
---
They changed it with endgame collapse so that if the traps weren't activated by gens being done they wouldn't go off.
---
Gotta get the RBTs on before the last gen is completed.
---
Oh, that would be a good red add on.
---
&gt; Yes, mostly everyone else does not teabag on console
---
This isn‚Äôt my experience at all, lmao. In purple/red ranks on PS4 people teabag pretty frequently.
---
*every killer is able to do "good"* try Wraith or Legion on red ranks and then we talk

So the other day I went into a match as Nancy with a bunch of P3s. Assholes farmed me off the hook and would teabag me every time the Killer downed me.
---
In post game chat I told them I reported them for it and everyone *including the Killer* [(who was playing the fucking Demogorgon!)](/intensifies) called me out for being a "shitty newbie who only plays this game because of the new DLC." Bitch we're at fucking Rank 5 and I have over a thousand hours in this game, and more to the point I have literally never watched Stranger Things before. You may be surprised to know that people are allowed to buy the DLC without watching Stranger Things.

People like this are the reason Dead by Daylight is dying.

Basically, a full bar of signal is the minimum if you want to game but even that doesn't guarantee a good experience since both 70% and 95% can show up as full strength and you don't want the former.

---
Nah, more like interpretation. Never said that's how you actually felt. My point is your answer is vague. But whatever. Have a good one.
---
It is indeed becoming popular due to the locker changes
---
It might not be as good as it sounds since I'm jus a 15 yr old and this is my first book ever created.
---
I'll keep you guys updated but it's gonna take a few weeks or months to get the few first chapters
---
I really appreciate the support and if I can I'll give some kind of first look into the book and complete free access when it's finished
---
And not getting a hook while the survs you injure still work on gens. Its always better to have perks that actively slow down gens or give you more lethality. There‚Äôs a reason people run ruin and pop over most other perks and its not because they haven‚Äôt thought of the alternatives.
---
Iron warden?
---
yikes, take that somewhere else
---
You go into HIS map, and you. Do that to him? Bravo
---
Poor boy. If only he was fed more often, we wouldn't have this issue!!!
---
Dumbass Claudette is a dumbass for not running straight into the gate. Dumbass Leatherface is a dumbass for not checking the locker notification.
---
Even on lery‚Äôs?
---
I think that‚Äôs because he wasn‚Äôt playable, sure people asked for it, but if he was playable, there will always be this group of people being offended by everything
---
Im 16. Dont start writing with the pretense that it might not be good. Even things that are "bad" help us get better at writing
---
From what I understand when you vault a window your hit box stays back.
---
I dunno, it's not really the same console and I've heard multiple people say PS4 is worse than Xbox, I personally never ended up getting the shit some people end up getting. But yeah, that sucks. Maybe I'm just really lucky.
---
this was literally me yesterday, on steve, in his scoop's ahoy outfit, and the killer dc'd out of the match... I felt really bad, but I had just started playing myself too xD
---
That's on your team
---
not if its meg
---
Bro he‚Äôs the large brain bro
---
Yeah. Open lockers faster+ leaving a locker exposes you.
---
Sounds like a pretty accurate definition.
---
I jumped from the ledge of the Meyer's house to the top of the van in the street.  PARKOURGORGEN.
---
Plus y‚Äôknow, Nancy‚Äôs best perk(imo).
---
Dont forget legion
---
It's need or nothing
---
Spirit is the worst, unless your not running iron will you‚Äôre guaranteed dead. I remember when she came out and she was very fun to play against but now she just gets overplayed by the most toxic and sweaty people. Almost every game I get spirit with the schoolgirl costume with ruin. I would rather face a omega blink nurse then her any day.
---
Ay fair enough
---
Even if you get me in a match again i probably don‚Äôt remember your name.
---
There are online dictionaries which will help you next time you want to reappropriate someone‚Äôs words to support your poor arguments.
---
Agreed
---
When did they add eleven?
---
Also wanted to know if you'd know any fonts that might work well with atleast the cover
---
You're fixated on the rank part, which I just told you to disregard. 
---
And yes, you*CAN* get to rank 1 as bubba, but nurse for example would have an easier time.
---
Hallowed blight coming back?
---
What's the original called?
---
It was generally disliked when they nerfed her because literally no one asked for it. Not even survivors.
---
In Syndicate you are stopping him and China gives no fucks about British history or copyright or intellectual properties. The problem would come where you can play as the Ripper or any real life killer then the families of victims could come forward and BHVR could be in unwanted legal battles and certain governments such as UK might not play nice.
---
DAE have common opinion on this messageboard!??!?!?!!?
---
"we dont want the hag ripping out kids kidneys"
---
Oh, it absolutely was. It's not like the Pig was super strong to begin with but having to do trap boxes on a timer would still be kinda unfair.
---
I'm sure there is a good way to balance it somehow but BHVR went with the easier option.
---
Sadly not my department. I have a friend that does the whole aesthetic thing for my covers. Im just the brain that writes the story. Whats in the picture looms good though
---
I can‚Äôt watch him play bc it‚Äôs 50% gameplay 50% whining and complaining. Unfollowed Ochido for the same reason. No one wants to hear you bitch and moan all game long. 
---
That‚Äôs why I love me my Monto and Puppers!
---
Can we stop with this meme format? It‚Äôs been done to death already (especially on this sub).
---
Not every killer can do good in high ranks but in lower ranks i see where you‚Äôre coming from. I played Wraith for my games last rank reset(dropping from low green to real low on the board) and destroyed. I just wanted to do a daily and *that* happened.
---
Statement/That
---
only works with bond and iron will
---
Console or just controller?
---
Hawkins Chainsaw Massacre.
---
"Shocking"
---
Poor Herman, don‚Äôt go to Lery‚Äôsüò¢
---
Yea idk he does have a large fanbase so I was wondering what people on this sub thought. I did mention in my post whether this was a popular opinion or not.
---
He was indeed playable in both games. For quite a decent time during the play through. I personally never saw anyone offended by playing him specifically.
---
Very nice drawing. : -)
---
Good question
---
* T E A C H A B L E S * 
---
I run Bond, Spine Chill, Balanced Landing and Self Care on him.
---
Yea he's all talk no walk. I like streamers who just focus on the game and explain or complain (not too much) afterwards. Kind of breaks the tension when they start yapping.
---
My boi is looking as gorgeous as ever
---
Well as an Ultra Rare add-on (Red Moss) it‚Äôs pretty pointless, but adding the Shred pallet break to it‚Äôs default kit will make him slightly stronger. Adding the pallet break with a Shred stun reducer add-on could make Shredding pallets quicker than breaking them, and would also lower the chance of flashlight blinds while breaking.
---
We already have The Clown in game.
---
im new to DBD i know TrueTalent and i like him but who are the others? im looking for good DBD content to learn things
---
It‚Äôs not really my type so I didn‚Äôt enjoy it but I see why people would but I just wish people wouldn‚Äôt get 2k karma for posting a picture of an outfit they bought
---
Kind of a mute point on tiers then since all achieve the same results in the end
---
Ah, so you are also one of them. Good to know.
---
Have you seen the stun demo gets? Even with those addons it‚Äôd most likely be faster to break normally
---
He has the same movement speed (4.6 m/s) and same lung distance as every other killer (barring the slower ones,that move at 4.4 m/s).
---
Tru3 has admitted he does mind games all the time because he finds them fun so they aren't always meant to be tactical. On the slugging point, that's more a playstyle type of thing. Some skilled killers prefer to play traditionally and others will go for slugfest. Check Otzdarva as an example. Really skilled killer, plays a standard game style.
---
‚ÄúHow did you find this god forsaken place?‚Äù
---
Huntresses?
---
While I do prefer Dead Hard and consider it the best exhaustion perk because of its potential, my god is it INconsistent. So many times jiggling on the ground, or getting exhausted without receiving the dash or i-frames. Still my favorite though, it's saved so many games for me.
---
Dead Hard is more versatile, works on every single map  making it the most consistent exhaustion perk.
---
Balanced Landing is a little more situational, but is better than Dead Hard if used on the right map. If you use this perk on maps like Sheltered Woods, Gas Haven, Rotten Fields or any other flat map, it‚Äôs pretty terrible.
---
Overall you‚Äôll see streamers and high rank players run Dead Hard more often.
---
As a shape main, I fully support this!
---
Fun: Wraith.
---
Fun Against: Billy.
---
Reasons: Wraith is a spooky boi who i literally can‚Äôt get over cause survivors run the second they hear the bell. It‚Äôs great.
---
Billy gets bullied.
---
What difference would that make?
---
Bad Touch by Bloodhound Gang
---
Just asking since i‚Äôm curious. Makes no difference.
---
Is using Legion's power to get around the map quicker a viable option for him? Does it actually help on making him faster or does the stun actually slow him down making this a bad idea to do? I feel like his power regens super quick so maybe it's not a bad idea to do??
---
I have never heard someone say "I want to rank up" for like a year. Not sure what community you're talking about but most people that play this game hate the ranking system and wish they could stay out of red ranks.
---
That‚Äôs MY president
---
I commissioned this wonderful art from u/kelseyboi! Haven't had a chance to put it up yet; but both of my cats adore it.
---
Well reflections in games are really hard to do :p
---
Why are you trolling? Also funny how you said ghostface is worse then bubba, because bubba at least  has power. I don t know about you but bubba didn t use his power on me like forever. Bubba is litterally worst killer without power, and right after bubba there is trapper and legion. Plz take your rank 20 bullshit somewhere else. And hell if you don t belive me, lets go kyf lobby, i will find 3 more survivors, and you go play bubba or legion, and i promise you will get 0 kills, mb 1 If you are lucky or If you are camping.
---
I wouldn't know, but whether this is true or not, it is not enough to make a real difference (on PC)
---
Although rare Jeff mains are usually altruistic chads
---
Hook on, hook off
---
It is, but only if necessary. You save barely any time unless you have many vaults in the way and if you enter a chase with an uninjured survivor you may regret your decision. Maybe you wouldn't have seen them if you didn't cross. In short use your intuition to determine if you will need to start stabbing or not when you reach where you need to go
---
im still waiting for dedicated servers
---
Do you happen to recall the parts in Syndicate where you played as the Ripper and killed a bunch of officers? In the beginning and then through the asylum at which he stayed at? You played as him.
---
 As for the families of victims, they don't exist anymore. Well not that we know of. All living relatives of Jack The Ripper's canonical 5 victims either don't exist anymore, or they are completely unaware that they are related. Retracing the victims DNA to living relatives would have to occur in order to find out. 
---
The UK and London are completely fine with The Ripper used in media. There was actually a famous wrestler who cosplayed as Jack for his entrance in London. The crowd went wild for him. Shows you how much they have a problem with it, don't it?
---
In my experience, Jake.
---
I agree with you..  he's not a bad player and seems like a decent person but there's nothing that makes him next-level.
---
I've been stuck playing with inexperienced killers, and players so far in my come back games. Because of rank reset I end up having a lot of loaded perks the others don't expect.
---
For me its usually fengs or janes
---
H*E***e**H*e*ee***eh**EHe**He**
---
This game is designed to play solo q and swf is bullshit so as a solo player i cant dedicate my entire game on doing totems. I also cannot expect it from my teammates so in my point of view it isnt an easy counter
---
If on console, avoid nurse. All I can say, as she isn‚Äôt as good as pc nurse due to non player fault problems.
---
so entity aint complaining about hag?
---
Wait? Where was this? Was this on PS4?
---
Lol im just a person that hates noed
---
I‚Äôm sorry, I will take this into account the next time I make a meme. :/
---
Inner strength + selfcare + medkit. We've got a forewarned Nancy over here
---
A perfectly okay perk that punishes survivors trying to be altruistic in endgame
---
Console
---
i think you forgot to mention otz in your love list
---
I would maybe place him in the mid-high tier, more tipping into the high tier. With some pretty good map pressure and the Shred making it easy to avoid certain loops and pallets, he‚Äôs pretty good imo. Add-one are also decent, I mainly use a good old Mew‚Äôs Guts/Rotten Pumpkin and Rat Tail add-on combination to have multiple, quick-to-place portals, but I‚Äôve seen other people use other add-one effectively. The brief period of Undetectable upon leaving a portal as well as the Oblivious effect makes catching people off guard easier, and can get you downs more than you‚Äôd think. I‚Äôm definitely looking forward to the pallet Shred becoming part of the default kit in 3.2.1 and the Red Moss add-on getting a better use, which in my eyes is only going to make the Demogorgon better. Definitely somewhat high tier.
---
Killer: A+ - S tier
---
Perks: D (Surge can be useful _sometimes,_ and Cruel Limits makes those survivors who complete gens in your face more unlikely to get away. Mindbreaker is pretty trash though, if they made it so that working on a generator whenever have you Exhaustion, it would be better.)
---
Add-Ons: B (Mostly good, the Brass Lighter and the Lifeguard Whistle don‚Äôt seem to be add-one I‚Äôd enjoy, but increasing Abyss detection range, number of portals, portal placement time, Upside Down traversal recharge, and increasing portal seal time are better good and really benefit the killer.)
---
Demogorgon if used properly, is easy A-/mid-high tier. His dash attack shuts down jungle gyms, loops and closes distance in dead zones. Portals which give great map pressure and allows for some pretty nasty first hits. 
---
His portals get destroyed pretty quickly and his shred can be pretty terrible on maps with weird hitboxes like Autohaven and Badham. But his new pallet shred buff will be able to make up for any downsides he has.
---
I play both sides equal enough and went against high rank swfs and usually got destroyed, bullied but yet i didnt use noed
---
Nice. Which one? Xbox or PS4?
---
Big yikes
---
Got destroyed huh? Man imagine if you had that fun ruining perk that helps you in endgame
---
tru3 in a nutshell...."guys i don't want to talk balance today, I want to get rid of the negativity"  Then proceeds to complain and then talks about how "unbalanced" the game is which naturally gets his chat riled up.
---
Honestly, I dunno how the guy can still play DBD every day.  He looks miserable playing, even when he wins matches
---
\*pleased Freddy noises\*
---
Yeah, clearly you are only allowed to bash Trump here. \*eyeroll\*
---
I mean, i dont give a tiniest tiny shit about escaping. I care more about my poor rank 20 baby teammates to live and noed is ruining it
---
That‚Äôs pretty cool. I avoid Spine Chill and never run Self Care just because of the lost productivity from overusing it. But I love Bond and Balanced Landing too. Usually use DS and WGLF too.
---
It‚Äôs around 2-2.5 seconds I believe, but you reduce the stun by .5 or .25 seconds with the Black Heart and Mew‚Äôs Guts addons. So if you run a build specifically depending on Shred, you can get the stun down to 1.5-1 second.
---
I'm 2, 1 pip from rank 1, and still play like a blind potato
---
No, I want to:
---
Rank up to go past rank 9 because green ranks DC too often and are usually rank 15-18 that got there.
---
Derank when I get near rank 4 because there's too many spirits and nurses.
---
Not rank when I'm rank 8 to 5 because it's literally heaven, good players sink to the hell called red ranks, bad players float to the hell that's green ranks
---
Xbox. It says LT in the video.
---
I don't get why people don't do the same. It's insanity
---
Does the mending action reveal you if the killer has nurses calling?
---
Yeah as a high IQ redditor once said, it would probably remove 2 killers and delete everyones progress. Dont fuck with the spaghetti code.
---
No the killers are just being generous and stopping the evil genrushing survivors so we all have fun for longer
---
I cannot use a perk based on an off chance that i am going to face some bullshit team because %60-70 of the time i play against fairly good survivors and dont need noed
---
Me and the new map.
---
Honestly it's worse not watching stranger things. My friend said to me "ur not good with the Demogorgon u just bought because u like stranger things" I told him that he doesn't know what the Demogorgon was and he pronounced it dee moe George Jan
---
Not to mention that you can force the pallet by charging pounce if you've forced the survivor to a dead zone, and save lots of time by doing it from a distance. Can even mind game that you're pouncing to the survivor, but instead break the pallet in order to force the survivor into a dead zone, much like Billy or Bubba. It just gives Demo a lot more options in chase.
---
I think that she serves him first and is a cannibal second
---
We also need the stoned Ghostface from Scary Movie.
---
I mean, hag only consumes the liver, demo kinda chomps the whole head
---
4 is nurse
---
3 is legion... maybe
---
I thought 12 was clown but i guess it's 6
---
I'm lost
---
I'd give a finger to see NBC's Hannibal and Will in DBD

They look beautiful! Could either you or /u/kelseyboi PM me the cost / a quote for a set? 
---
(Figured he wouldn't want his prices public)
---
Iron Maiden. You're confusing with Blood Warden.
---
Like I said, Do whatever you want but don't then sit and say "Dumb ass survs ran from the hook and left scratchmarks, idiots!"
---
If your returning to the hook anyway, the correct thing for them to do is run. Not crouchwalk behind the nearest rock.
---
Please just read the comment chain before posting.
---
Dw, she‚Äôs running *slippery meat* :)

Cankers were all great until you get left to die on the hook because people are busy collecting nectar.

You mean needles crossed?
---
The entitlement of me telling him to play how he wants? What the fuck are you on about.
---
Myers just showed up and threatened the entity to let him in
---
You clearly havent used it as much as a billy main, the blind delay is so long you cannot blind the killer unless the killer lets you blind them, i have no idea what kind of flashlight are you lookings? Are you looking at dead by daylight launch flashlights with odd bulb and high end sapphire lens?
---
Meg's, they're too busy running away to have time to BM
---
Do the totems.
---
I'd like to be in the closet with david
---
Oh nvm on the wiki it said that it was changed after patch 1.9
---
The angle ain't right
---
jUsT dO bOnEs 4hEaD
---
That‚Äôs actually a possibility since Funworld owns the mask license, any existing Ghostface mask is eligible to become a cosmetic, like the silver one.
---
this is natural selection.   
---
Hopefully some of the new players will fall in love with the game and try and get better and improve, most won't though. Idk, I quite like dbd being hard to get into.
---
Yeah it's broken right now. Here's a tweet of them acknowledging it.  [https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1174790992857354255](https://twitter.com/DeadByBHVR/status/1174790992857354255)

"Lost productivity" 
---
Yet you vouch for WGLF. Sike.
---
Nice
---
*Hitbox intensifies*
---
Yes it was ment to be funny. Kappa is a Twitch emote for irony/sarcasm. Because, how often do your skillchecks happen to be in the middle of your screen when you play against a Doc?
---
When should you hit normal and when do you lunge?
---
What is the range on the normal m1? 
---
I‚Äôve heard it auto-locks on any hot oc on range but have had that fail on me.
---
It was unrelated content, just put the title as text above the image and it's fine
---
Killers not being able to vault fast is because it breaks chases by making them far easier to end and that's a result of how ledges are set up, survivors stumbling as long as they do from pretty minor heights is highly bullshit as killers effectively lose zero momentum from any height but you take a stair wrong and you're a sitting duck. 
---
I'm mainly annoyed because once you run BL it becomes real obvious real quick how many little drops can trigger it and if you didn't have it you'd be downed.
---
Moreover being slowed likely wouldn't affect lunge at all so you could still end chases if they don't already have a lead.
---
For any killer that can mindgame their red stain the mouse is better because you can twist around much faster.
---
Seriously man? We should keep it politically neutral here. I get it, you have an opinion that I respect. But c'mon it's a video game, it isn't a debate...
---
Its definetly better than this one so its a pass

Probably, but reworks are long in coming.  For any killer.

Yeah but I sadly don‚Äôt have any programs I can use to do that
---
1 is trapper

2 is wraith

3 is Billy

5 is huntress
---
Peppa is pig
---
15 is plague
---
I love it when people go into hysterical rants about things they don't understand and then call other people snowflakes.
---
It‚Äôs not tunneling if you self healing in front of the hook u where just pulled off of
---
They charge actual cash money for the Pig, though. When you buy the Pig, you‚Äôre actually spending 5 bucks to get Make Your Choice. You don‚Äôt actually want to play the Killer.
---
Perk: See-Through Steel. Killer insists they will build a wall around the exit but doesn‚Äôt even start until every survivor has escaped already.
---
That‚Äôs because of STBFL, not because of freddy
---
not really, the ranks still feel the same. a few killers (nurse, plague, huntress, the like) are definitely easier with a keyboard and mouse, though.
---
If you‚Äôre healing someone with Autodidact and you‚Äôre using Second Wind, will you trigger the SW from those first two regression skillchecks?
---
She also bites a chunk out of their throats
---
Making BT not work was on Freddy, Otz explained that if it wasn't for Freddy being able to counter BT, he would've either had to follow the unhooked survivor and waste time to hit and down them, or pick up and hook David, but he got them both because new Freddy = Hill Billy
---
It‚Äôs just a love bite, it‚Äôs fine
---
I dont do this shit myself, but as far as I'm aware its when you unplug the internet cable from your PC/Console, resulting in remaining survs not getting anything, and if you are a surv you wont lose your item
---
tl,dr: A really scummy thing to do
---
I was really excited for Surge initially, but messing around with it live feels somewhat...underwhelming. I've been messing around with Corrupt Intervention on some of my builds in place of ruin and had some promising results on some killers, but it still feels like even if I get a down in a respectable amount of time I'll have two gens pop out super early, especially on certain maps.
---
Seems like cleansing a portal has a chance to cause the bug. Sometimes it's just visual, other times you're stuck with the effect untill you cleanse another one.
---
I agree but I am a legion main so I would put legion in c
---
As a survivor trying to have fun with a friend who doesn't generally enjoy survivor but likes DBD in general it's been absolute hell the past few days. Ebony moris, face camping killers, etc every match that isn't a brand new killer.
---
Awww, ü§ó the survivors probably dont know, if i knew thats what you was doing i'd certainly do it back. üôÇ
---
You'll get what I like to call "Killer's Intuition".
---
Are you having a stroke?
---
I‚Äôm having a generator someone you? 911 I‚Äôm stroke doing
---
And Michael in A
---
I think the only time add-ons don't stack, is if they specifically say does not stack in the description.
---
yeah there was a pallet that was thrown down in front of one of the house in lampkin lane and i hopped over it as demogorgen
---
...No, I'm gay myself. I'm just not unreasonable. Good to see it's pointless trying to reason with you though.
---
Yeah and he should have special mori that works only with that cosmetic that he stabs a survivor with those needles in their forearm, cringes as they scream and exhales 'what a rush...'
---
Pretty much. They even give you 1K points, so, no reason not too.
---
Isn‚Äôt ghostface‚Äôs I‚Äôm all ears perk really good on nurse?
---
I hover around 15/13 as survivor and I absolutely love it. I don't get stressed out and actually have fun.
---
Unlike my partner who is in green ranks and he hates it. He wants to try and get to purple but he doesn't want to sweat every game.
---
Is lightweight worth using? Debating between that and Iron Will.
---
I don't wanna play vs 2 people and I also don't want to farm, so the sooner the game ends the better
---
I'll delete it and add subtitles to killers lmao i didn't think this through when i was doing it xD
---
He wastes time and can get easy first hits, but that‚Äôs it. His power is useless in the chase and the mend time is so small that‚Äôs it‚Äôs barely even an inconvenience for the survivors. Buffs ain‚Äôt gonna cut it for them, they need a heavy rework like Fredward.
---
Yea both sides have been sucking massively I've noticed, got sweaty killers or baby killers from the matches I get, pleas fix matchmaking BHVR
---
\*internal screaming intensifies\*
---
Nice hatch spawn tho. +1
---
Oh thanks!
---
How in the world did  you do this? Me and my buddies were trying to do this last night and the stun NEVER worked. We sat in the locker for the minimal 3 seconds like required, but they always left the locker like a little bitch lol.
---
Well I'm sure the straights will accept you if you keep saying it's okay for them to want to never see a gay person express any feeling ever. Good luck.
---
Love your style! Keep drawing!!
---
No he's a very good Dbd player.
---
The think is, since months now he play both survivor and killer at the same ratio while previously it was 80% killer. And he plays all the killers which means that he does not main a side and he does not main a character neither.
---
It obviously implies that he won't be optimal on every killers that ask some dedication like Huntress or Nurse (he was actually one hell of a beast with her when he used to "main" nurse). And still he's able to win a high ranked game with the one blink Nurse meme build thanks to his overall game knowledge and skill.
---
But he's stubborn about his gameplay which can hurt him regarding lower tier killers who ask you to 3 gen strat or slug. I think that it's not a real win for him to use those strategies and get a 3-4K.
---
But having regular 3-4K against the teams he goes against call for a high level of skill. 
---
He complains a lot and i don't agree like at all with his opinion on the game balance, but yea he's good.
---
if I had a dollar for every time I accidentally vaulted over a pallet towards the killer lmao gg tho
---
Drives me bananas that I'll just snowball and play very well on a game but because I didn't break enough pallets or slap enough gens during that snowball even a full 4K sac doesn't give me much of anything. Like I have to arbitrarily go out of my way to use all the mechanics even if it's not necessary to beat my opponent.
---
I would love to see something happen when he de-cloaks near survivors. A rough idea I had was something like this.
---
Harvest Fear: Uncloaking within X meters of a survivor lets you drink in their fear filling a meter. When full you can activate it to instantly enter an improved cloak. 
---
Improved Cloak: You phase through dropped pallets and windows for the duration. You may make one attack while cloaked and exit it upon landing the blow. Any stuns or flashlight blinds result in a very long stun due to your connection to the Entity being broken.
---
I know this has similarities to Spirit/Legion but Bing-Bong Boy needs some depth I feel. Another option could be
---
The Bells! : The toll of your bell instills dread in survivors. While within X meters of a survivor and fully uncloaking you shatter their confidence. For Y seconds after leaving cloak survivors in the radius are slowed and cannot initiate fast vaults.
---
As long as the text "does not stack" is not present, it stacks. 
---
Fun combos for stacking:
---
* Legion's Stolen Sketch Book and Mural Sketch for a 40% increase in duration.
---
* Wraith's Windstorm - Blood and Windstorm - White so he moves at 163% while cloaked
---
* Hillbilly's Thompson's Moonshine and Spiked Boots for 72% more turning.
---
Hahaha thanks! :)
---
When at firsti thought you guys were talking bout freddy as soon as i saw the word rework since i still keep hearing about freddys rework and was gonna be like he is one of the best killers in the game depending on your point of view but then i saw wraith and my whole opinion changed in other words wraith definitely needs a buff, coming from a survivor main
---
I'm still a fan of hybrid panda, very standard player, mugging special, but he can really play. I think I liked his videos simply because he's positive. I also like to watch him stream occasionally. 
---
Noob3 has started killer, loads of fun to watch because he knows he's not all that good at killer
---
I think I meant consistency as in, you will always get use of it. Unlike Balanced which has some maps that you won‚Äôt get much use out of it. Though I do agree the bugs that occur with Dead Hard on occasion are incredibly annoying.
---
Glad to be of service, just dont use it
---
I'd love if we got the different Myers masks or outfits from the different films.
---
Why should it be unfair?
---
The second one is otzdarva who is an intellectual and the third one is fruitberries who makes traps in minecraft
---
Honestly, it been made easier now, I remember how awfully slow it was when the game released. If the newcomers like the game enough the grind should not be too bad, specially with the shrine and the shards to unlock some new killers/survivors.
---
I am thankful the devs decided to make the bloodweb easier at higher level because there is really too many perks currently and if you were unfortunate to unlock a bunch of lame perks unknowingly, it just felt awful when you gen D- perks for 5-10 bloodwebs.
---
That's your first mistake.  Don't return to every unhook.  Play to disrupt all the survivors and force them off gens.  If you want to beat good survivor groups you need to play to pressure gens.  Hook leave to patrol gens, find and down your next survivor, hook and repeat.  Keep them constantly having to pull off gens to perform altruism.  Too many weak or newer killers think you always have to return to the hook.  That's how you lose gens and consistently have to deal with Borrowed Time and Decisive.  My playstyle makes them 3 perk survivors.
---
Very very good! Personally i would swap the doctor and the pigs positions but other than that it is very good! Im happy where my girl Plague is (maybe she could be a bit higher but i digress) and my boy Wraith is still chillin in D with his favorite homie Leatherface lol.
---
Clown and doctor are too high, and it pains me to say it.
---
Ghosface, Legion and Trapper are too low.
---
I wouldn't put Freddy in the same level as spirit.
---
Pretty much agree with the rest.
---
I just wanna get to rank 19 tbh bro lmao, getting spitroasted by high-rank survivors as a baby killer feels real rough
---
Welcome to the problem with matchmaking and SWF. It sounds like you got matched with the 16 who was playing with his red rank buddies. I encountered this recently as well.
---
The problem is the game matches survivors based on the lowest rank rather than the highest. League of Legends used to matchmake properly where 30s or Diamond ranks were matched with others of the same rank. I'm not sure of its matchmaking now, but that's how matchmaking should be in DbD: the highest tier player is the one you match a killer with.
---
To the naysayers, consider this: if you're a low rank with few perks or poor gamesense, yes, you're going to lose some games. But, you're going to learn what it's like to go against the higher tier killers and that will teach you the right skills to have when you reach those ranks. Going against a bad killer teaches you nothing except you can be carried by your better friends. When the high ranks hit you, they're gonna hit you hard. This hand-holding matchmaking with your red rank pals gives you no benefit other than quick BP, something any player can get.
---
Entity Displeased
---
As a rank 1 legion who just unlocked the plague. Plague is gotta be at least A teir compared to legion
---
A sign of respect mostly
---
It depends on your perks
---
When I wasn't playing monster, I typically mained Trapper. I loved hunting the monster down and dropping a dome on them before they could stage up.
---
The Entitty turned off the moon when Boques were removed, I don't think it cares about light

Pretty sure Michael doesn‚Äôt bow to the force of the entity or something. Or maybe that‚Äôs just for tombstone allows him not to

WGLF OP plz nerf
---
I was downed and bleeding out yesterday when the hatch spawned right near me but I bled to death as soon as it popped open and I could hear it. ‚òπÔ∏èüò•
---
This was the first time I‚Äôve hit red ranks but I‚Äôm going to just play killer
---
Imho, the lower ranks as the most fun. There is no sweat involved unless you have a killer who is deranking on purpose to bully lower ranks. But that's rare. 
---
It's most likely the messed up matchmaking. I am currently running better together, spin chill, empathy and dark sense. Though I tend to switch out dark sense with small game sometimes. Seeing as noed and ruin are more common now. I'm not the best at survivor, but sticking to the lower ranks has definitely improved my skills lol.
---
how did he make fun of trump?
---
Cause for the killer is the same achievement much harder
---
If you try to avoid chases, maybe hold out until you can get deliverance, it's great as an immersed player. Sneak up, save, then disappear into the grass like you were never there.
---
I'd say he is better at survivor than he is at killer, IMHO.
---
&gt;A killer being bad means they are not an option if you want to play the goddamn game.
---
No it doesn't. It just means you probably shouldn't compete in Tournaments. Your average player is fine to play subpar killers.
---
You're being over-dramatic.
---
Remember not everyone is red ranks. A lot of people purposely avoid that garbage.
---
&gt; Remember how it was almost all Nurse?
---
Yeah because nurse is fucking ridiculous.
---
&gt;If BHVR had a functioning rank system that sorted people by skill rather than "ability to fill emblems", Rank 1 would look exactly like that because at the highest level of play, that's the only killer who fucking works.
---
Who would have thought the top competitive players would take the 1 killer that gets to ignore any sort of terrain advantage when terrain is basically the only thing survs have to stall them.
---
Idk man if it's been like 30 seconds and you are still in there, you campin tho
---
This makes no sense
---
***Debate me irl bro*** I think I have some points to make, with the intent to change your opinion on Tru3 enough to get you to stop expressing negative criticism over something that doesn't affect you but may affect the person you're belittling for ill, because it makes the internet a toxic place.  I'll format it in a way that should be easy to respond to.
---
1. It takes a good player to consistently get to Rank 1. He has a lot of experience in playing this game. As well as a large following that often thank him and claim they are becoming better players by observing him. All this would indicate that he is a good player.
---
2. Claiming that he misses Huntress Hatchets=Bad player is a poor argument, seeing as how he plays every Killer: He can get rusty on certain Killers like Huntress, that have a unique playstyle and reward players who stick with her (and only her). I could easily show you a bunch of video where he has pinpoint precision and consistency throughout a game while playing Huntress, or videos of him landing shots across the map. He is not a bad Huntress player: don't cherry-pick moments, I can do that too.
---
3. He's a free thinker. Do you remember what people said about Legion when he was released and how Tru3 was the only one who made him work, before he caught on? Same goes for Spirit: People thought she was terrible too, now she's considered 2nd best. He does the same with Plague. He doesn't just follow the majority, he actually makes up his own mind first, without a need for validation, which allows him to excel while others wait for approval. Speaking of which, why do you care if you have a popular opinion?
---
4. Tru3, as a public figure, has to endure a lot of criticism and hate for unjust reasons: People who ruin his games for no reason. Try to empathize. Imagine knowing there's a bunch of people out there that just want to ruin your day anywhere you go. Like right now. If he slugs, he gets hate and told he's playing unfair. If he doesn't, you're still upset at him. This point can't be argued: You're just being unfair to him as a person.
---
5. He plays a lot. Doesn't he stream everyday? For people who play video games for a job, it must not be as good as it sounds. Enduring a lot of hate/criticism and playing while you're burnt out = grumpy moods, unless you're playing a character for the camera/channel you're uploading to. It's one thing to not enjoy watching it (don't watch then) it's another thing to start a thread trying to get people to agree that he's a bad player and a bad streamer. Don't add more straw to the camel's back, you know? Not that this has anything to do with him being a good/bad player, I just think it's telling you mentioned this in a separate comment: You just dislike him, I think, and want your negative opinions validated.
---
Lol, PWYF + Tuff and Tombstone at lvl3.
---
Now I just have to act like pacman find and swallow the 4 pills while moving around the maze.
---
Doctor to Pig is all very subjective, so I understand if a lot of people disagree with my placements. They‚Äôre all around the same level down there. The reason Pig is the lowest is because of her RNG traps. It‚Äôs either really good at slowing the game down or mildly inconveniences the survivors. Plague is easy A/S if they cleanse, but she‚Äôs reduced to a basic M1 killer if they don‚Äôt. 
---
But it‚Äôs good to know that I‚Äôm not completely insane with my picks :]
---
Hi everyone, I wanted to get some inputs on who is more worth between Ghostface and Myers. As far as I can tell the one thing I don't like about the former, which Mayers hasn't, is the fact that Ghostface's ability can be cancelled by survivors and then you have to wait the cooldown to stalk again. I saw a build by TrueTalent in which he doesn't use the stalk but just sneaks up on people after injuring them and that seems way funnier to play with than how he is supposed to be played. So, who would you recommend to buy betweem him and Myers? Thanks in advance
---
i had the same problem yesterday, 2 times in a row. Repaired the game via steam, found a damadged/missing data, re-downloaded and now it works. File was ~243mb

hey look on the bright side he's a really good addon now :^)

Get ready for absurd queue times as killer. Well, more absurd than they can already be.
---
Spirit, Billy, Freddy are all fine and see play.
---
They just aren't as strong as nurse, Balance goes both ways - Maybe if only 1 killer is seeing play it's because that killer is too strong.
---
In nurses case - That would be accurate.
---
I can help my team and earn We‚Äôre Gonna Live Forever stacks at the same time. Crazy concept, right?
---
You definitely sound salty.  Especially with no proof to backup your accusations.
---
I don't think so ):
---
I mean, hes red rank, which means hes good enough. No one perfect. Besides, as long as you enjoy watching him,
---
Pretty sure they get the average of the ranks, get two rank 1s and two rank 20s and it will try and get a rank 10 killer.
---
I don‚Äôt because I am a killer main and I don‚Äôt want to be an asshole. I will usually wait at the exit gate and give the killer opportunity for some extra blood points a the end, especially if they have been playing fair the whole game.
---
Cry cry baby
---
Haha I didn't even think about that
---
Fairly valid reasoning and i love the rest of the placements! First really good tier list I have seen on this sub in a while. Hell better than some streamers lists lol.
---
lmao  yeah
---
That sucks!
---
You just got pranked kid
---
I‚Äôve been trying to use Dead Hard but I feel like it‚Äôs not working a good 50% of the time. :/ Maybe I am just using it wrong.
---
lame
---
Survivors: nodding is toxic
---
Ruins not as hard to deal with on pc but on console theirs a skill check delay which isnt that bad if you play it consistantly since youll have it locked in
---
indeed!
---
I respect that guy for playing how he wants.
---
Heads up, I didn‚Äôt downvote or upvote you.
---
Upvoting for awareness, not the quality of the screenshot of the phone photo.
---
Ok that was a rude thing to say but this entire week me and my friends have been high rank, now red, and playing against literal rank 20s. Bhvr acting like matchmaking isnt completely broken, please f off.
---
They want to remove the biggest threat
---
And lose potential all at the same time.
---
sorry xd
---
Lack of counter play makes it unfun for survivors, basically. When you "ruin" someone's fun they act like assholes.
---
Salt. It's a bad choice though because then the other survivors can complete gens while the killer wastes time on you.
---
It depends. I mean what is he supposed to do, kill himself because the game bugged out? I'd assuming for stuff like this he would have to be a repeated offender to be banned.
---
Even for glitches that are easy to use/execute (like the Wake Up glitch just 1-2 months back), they usually don't punish or if they do they'll announce "starting now if you do it, you will be banned", rather than retroactively banning
---
So to sum it up, for glitches they usually give you a warning.
---
This is what I've noticed, anyways

Removing the top player in the match and so that they don‚Äôt get looped as much later
---
It‚Äôs not a very fun or exciting perk for either side tbh. Like sure it‚Äôs a solid meme every now and again but I can‚Äôt see the person using insidious actually having fun just standing there doing nothing. Also you get boned by a SWF group cause they just say ‚Äúhey he‚Äôs insidious camping me‚Äù or if people have Kindred you just kinda do nothing and it‚Äôs boring.
---
2 can be just as crafty as 4, I won‚Äôt risk it. That and I find it more fun to kill as many as possible, not to get as many points as possible. To bring you to the sky is my goal, good sir.
---
Usually if you loop them for a while that means there is probably 1-2 gens left.
---
At that point they decide it's best to secure at least one kill by proxy and move on.
---
Iron will is more useful that lightweight. Lightweight is in no way a bad perk but on its own just isn't worth the spot. If you partner it with dance with me and/or lithe and quick and quiet it will give you an amazing getaway potential to break chase and hide from the killer.
---
Removed - Oversaturated Content

I don't use any of his perks (flip-flop can be a little interesting in certain builds), but I like having a character with likeness and VO. I think that's cool, even if he's entirely too loud.

I cried a little inside. XD

Please keep this account going.
---
The same thing could be said for the survivors, just get the match over with and move on.
---
By wiggling I assume you mean trying to escape the hook, because wiggling typically means trying to free yourself when being held by the killer.
---
4% is better than 0%. When it does work it can be a ton of fun.
---
There are some perks that let you heal yourself, or get up when knocked down, or help you be more likely to escape killer's grasp or the hook.
---
Are you ambushing rescuers coming in for the rescue? If so, that's a one way ticket to flame city. Even just having it will get you hate, even if you don't use it to camp.
---
Thank you! Are there any Legion mains that you watch or have watched recently?
---
Map is a decently large factor but balanced is almost always better, mainly because of hit boxes, and most killers being aware of dead hard the moment you use it once. Also balanced has the ever present no fall lag which is a huge tool in looping
---
It has been done, just a long time ago...
---
They may just be unaware. It was recently changed so a lot of people are probably trying to test it out, not knowing it is broken. 
---
I didn't know it was until I saw it happen. I haven't seen any news from the devs about it yet so I'm sure a large amount of the player base has no clue.
---
Typically either feelings of salt or zero confidence in their ability to beat you without busting out the babystrats.  Hopefully your teamates punish their infancy with lots of popped gens for doing it.
---
Because it works especially well for demo. It's pretty good when you use it with him.
---
If you can‚Äôt get anymore survivors with frenzy, than chase the last survivor you hit. Hook pressure is more impactful than deep wound stabs.
---
I see bond as nearly an auto include for me because I play solo so often. Information is so valuable in this game I can't live without the knowledge that my teammates are doing nothing. But contrary to many, I attempt to use bond to avoid gens I know have people on them while I'm in chase :O
---
Some people maybe at unaware of the instant crash it provides when activating the perk, the reason why a lot of players run it is the insta down it could provide out of no where. But you will always have the trolls that ruin the game
---
Looping is extremely cheap and you shouldn't do it
---
look natural selection was susposed to have killed you freaks off we're tired of pandering to you just die off already like leftys
---
26th I believe
---
I agree with you. I‚Äôve stopped playing and have no interest in the DLC‚Äôs anymore. I think some new game modes would make it more interesting
---
Statistically, there are more survivors than killers. This messes with the perception
---
yeah lol. I'd be okay with the mask from H2, the Rob Zombie outfits, and the 2018 version
---
I have a lot of fun, and agree it doesn't always work. It's more about those unexpected scares that make it worthwhile. The sheer terror when there are multiple people in the basement as they hear my chainsaw and they all scramble for cover makes me love playing killer. I am not a fan of getting looped by red ranks and sweating as leatherface.
---
Lunge when you think the survivor can't dodge (where a palate used to be) because it's a narrow area. An m1 is just a little in front of you and does lock on a bit, but can still miss.
---
Knowing when to use either really comes to practice as each killer has a unique lunge range.
---
**Numbers from the wiki:**
---
* Legion base speed:  4.6 m/s
---
* Feral Frenzy speed: 5 m/s
---
    * Default Frenzy lasts for **10** seconds.
---
    * Default post-Frenzy cool-down lasts for **4** seconds.
---
    * Fatigue speed: 2.7 m/s
---
    * Default total Frenzy charge time takes 20 seconds.
---
**Let's take 14 seconds (Frenzy duration + Fatigue) as the time period for analysis:**
---
* Base speed: (4.6\*14) = 64.4m
---
* Feral Frenzy: (5\*10)+(2.7\*4) = 60.8m
---
So you can see that it just won't work out unless you manage to hit someone in those 10 seconds - bearing in mind you won't see scratches and don't get Killer Instinct until you land a hit. If you were using Discordance to Frenzy towards the first double-teamed generator then you face the problem of map size - the *smallest* map is roughly 86m\*86m, 121m diagonally if you went straight to the opposite corner, and 60m is only going to be half that distance. 
---
So, to be clear, at game start you're relying on someone accidentally running into you, and leaves you dry on Feral Frenzy if you bet wrong. In the midgame and endgame you should have a more sporting chance, with the odds getting better if you're pushing survivors into a patrollable 3-gen **and** have some kind of "ping" perk to tell you *roughly* where they are (presuming that it's *comfortably* within 60m).
---
Any other questions on that?
---
Yeah
---
They said they likely will change something but not for quite a while.
---

This sums up the adept Laurie achievement
---
*stares at comment while sweating heavily*
---
Nope, you are not alone at all.  I really hope they add another mode.  But for some reason they are scared to death to it, not like it will split the player base...well I guess it could but if it ends up being a super mode.  Then I think the choice will be single for the community.
---
I would say probably to remove the clear best player in the match. Most of the time it is a waste of time to keep going after that person but I have gone out of my way to go after them if they have given me a hell of a time and the rest of the group is not nearly as good. I really try not to be a complete asshole about it and tunnel right off the hook etc but you may earn my extra special attention. Especially if you teabag and flashlight click after a pallet stun or other obnoxious behavior.
---
It's killer vs survivors, regardless of the fact they haven't left yet. He did the right thing even if they were shitbags.
---
Either that or waiting near a generator. What else is it used for? Why hate it though? It's a fun perk and makes for some terrifying scares
---
Hard-counters the ‚Äògen-rush‚Äô some players love to do and can 180 a game from a Depip to a Ruthless Killer, especially good on M1 killers.
---
Matchmaking is bugged. BHVR has acknowledged that it‚Äôs bugged, and stated that they‚Äôre working on a fix for it.
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-came-out-to-have-a-good-time-and-im-honestly-feeling-so-attacked-right-now
---
They are basically down a perk for most of the game, so it should be easier to get to endgame with more survivors, which will make totems easier to find and allows better ability to open both gates simultaneously
---
Ah now this is some good stuff completely agree chief I got a colorblind friend who basically can not see scratch marks
---
That‚Äôs why she‚Äôs the top killer in my opinion. No map is bad for her. Billy and Nurse have some they struggle with.
---
how has anyone on this sub upvoted someone saying "fuck you pig" in any context. Piggy is like the most beloved character
---
Walking is for noobs!
---
I still can't believe the devs didn't so much as include a warning message to the news section when you open up the game yet.  How is a perk that it ran crashes everyones game not worth telling people about up front?
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any that I have personally watched just because of how inconsistent the killer is for you and the survivors, so that‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt see many play him. But with the franks mixtape question don‚Äôt run it, it got nerfed into oblivion and is practically unusable. Add ons I suggest are iridescent pin and the purple blade to make men‚Äôs significantly longer and for you to break pallets on vault. But besides that I don‚Äôt have any more advice to provide
---
How? it‚Äôs says that it only activates when the exit gates are open, I usually can‚Äôt do anything after that
---
I like how the pic shows spirit though. You dont need ruin or pop on spirit lol.
---
New survivor: The environment
---
I hate how amazing Pig is
---
Because if they don‚Äôt cleanse every single totem, once the gens are powered you move faster and down people in one hit, which are both really powerful boosts. So either they cleanse every totem and give you more time, or you get a massive buff in the endgame.
---
Or possibly opening a doorway to further reflections?
---
It‚Äôs actually when the last gen is powered
---
The main different thing is that it's a 1vs4 so people just be toxic "together" because they have only 1 enemy, whereas others be toxic because "that's natural, I'm the killer".
---
#ENOUGH
---
Could say the same about borrowed time and Decisive strike (not a fan of catching a hook rescue after heading across the map to find out my next hit got king crimson‚Äôd), yet I won‚Äôt because we‚Äôre all allowed to use any perks we want, and the honor code isn‚Äôt the official rules for the game. I‚Äôll ruin your fun if I want, it‚Äôs 4v1, someone ain‚Äôt gonna have fun. You can ruin my fun too, up to you.
---
New patch, new bugs. Like how does this get into the main game. They don't play test.
---
It's not the killer's job to make things fun for survivors, though. If they can't have fun that's a personal issue. I have fun when going against insidious leatherfaces, but I don't really sweat when playing and enjoy a good jumpscare
---
I've been ending up with rank fives on console and i'm only rank 19 so i've been having a bad time
---
They can do whatever they like. But playing a bit easier since the game is now unfair is encouragement for the other two survivors to stay. They can leave too and find another game within a minute or two sending you right back into a 15 minute queue again.
---
It's a great perk to win the game at the end. 
---
If the survivors neglect totems then you receive an insta-down once the exit gates are powered (all gens are done.) 
---
This can get you a kill or more in end game.
---
It's not a great perk to rely on though as it rewards you for "doing bad." Ideally you want to get them all before the last gen is completed. I would opt for a perk that slows the game down and give you info instead, such as Ruin, Corrupt Intervention, Discordance, Thrilling Tremors, Sloppy Butcher.
---
If you dont have many perk options and are having a hard time then go ahead and try out NOED, but just keep in mind you shouldn't rely on it for your win.
---
Huh, better than some games I've played with retroactive banning
---
This is what I want.
---
Map wide, no instant regression but starts the regression progress. Work on generators or lose them
---
I'm sure they could grab inspiration from some scps but I doubt they will ever make an scp chapter
---
Whenever i play as ghostface, most survivors disconnect/leave
---
Most do, that's why everyone runs DS, adrenaline and borrowed time. That's why as a killer I never camp or tunnel if I can help it, I make most survivors question the neccessity of their loadout
---
And that's why if one person DC's I DC too. The killer doesnt care so why should I. On to the next game.
---
When I see corrupt I just go looking for totems.
---
Damn, first day of autumn, already seeing snowflakes. Sorry you got triggered lil trumpet, it‚Äôs just a joke post  ‚ùÑÔ∏èüíó
---
When ever Dallas is injured he screams for a medkit
---
&gt;I mean survivor perks are the same way.
---
I feel its moreso for survivors. Killers are varied enough that some perks get use on some killers better than others. I've had decent fun with newer survivor perks, but none of them I would call more than gimmicky or situational, except for original Mettle of Man. Mettle was very strong against m1 killers, but now it's so bad that you have to throw the game to get it to work. And then protection hits are glitchy so it continues to not work. Killers have gotten Corrupt Intervention (pretty good on trapper), Spirit Fury, Discordance, and Haunted Grounds. Which isn't much, but it's still more than survivors. Personally I feel the best perk we've gotten in a while was Distortion, and even then lockers do the same thing.
---
INCEL

ALERT üö®
---
I cannot tell you how fun that map is as Ghostface. The no terror radius turns me into a 4k god.
---
You can only get grabbed if injured I believe.
---
It's not good. It is used in majority by bad killers who cannot get enough hooks against average survivors until the game ends and rely on easy kills. The perk is just a pure clutch for those who lack any skill.
---
I don't see the same thing.  He still seems relatively chill during his games despite playing it constantly for a job.  I still see him enjoy games.  If you want to see someone that literally hates this game and doesn't mind spelling that out to people during his gameplay watch Tydetyme.  That dude despises the game and honestly it kind of annoys me he even came back to it after all the absurd shit he talks about it.  Literally tells people I hate this game I'm back to play it for your money though.  It's beyond joyless to watch him.
---
In short now if an addon doesn't say it doesn't stack then assume that it does stack with other addons.
---
His perks are mediocre but after the pallet break buff I'd put him at low A tier
---
I don't play Legion enough, but my two cents is that if you're going to play Legion, you're trying to pressure everyone into constantly dealing with Deep Wound. With other killers, if you enter a chase, you stick with that survivor without bleeding too much time downing and hooking them. In Legion's case, it's all about spreading Deep Wound. It preoccupies survivors with healing it so gen and totem focus is temporarily delayed.
---
Here's my typical approach when in a chase:
---
1. Enter Frenzy if not already in it and apply DW to survivor.
---
2. Check for other nearby survivors. (Go to 4 if none are close enough to chase and apply DW to them)
---
3. Pursue nearby marked survivor(s) &amp; return to step 1.
---
4. Hunt mending survivor and down/hook.
---
5. Seek out new target &amp; return to step 1 upon finding one.
---
Legion isn't as bad as most people seem to make them out to be. With the right amount of gamesense, they can make a great main.
---
5/10
---
Lose potential? You just said you run Spine Chill. That‚Äôs lost potential unlike any other amount of lost potential. You could literally run Resilience and be more helpful.
---
Ooooooohhhhh, okay that makes way more sense

You see, thats the mentality that ruins the game. Because ive had so many games that both killer and survivors had fun at the same time when both killer and the survivors were able to emphatise each other and play fair enough and yet ive had so many games that both killer and survivors didnt have fun because of the camp and tunnel after the killer getting gen rushed because couldnt apply enough map pressure which is the reason that killer used noed. It seems like there is a problem with the game and rank system
---
Damn that song... good memories
---
Yeah he‚Äôs definitely cool, but I can‚Äôt ever get Flip flop to pay off, even running it with Tenacity and Unbreakable + Breakdown. Hooks are just too close together most of the time.
---
Nurse has maps that are worse for her, but she can still be very effective there. On most maps besides Lery's, Nurse outperforms Spirit.
---
If you have an Nvidia graphics card is a very easy to use feature included in their "GeForce Experience" tool. Unfortunately I don't know how other graphics cards handle it
---
I played against the same Trapper 3 times in a row Saturday night,first game i distracted him enough for my team to finish all gens
---
Second game he tunneled me and face camped me
---
Third game same as the second except i got saved and even though i had adrenaline and fully healed he still chased me meanwhile a injured meg was next to him
---
Literally, after a couple of days getting matched with other players with more than 6 or 8 ranks in difference, I stopped playing. 
---
Until it stabilizes a little bit. I know it hasn't been always 100% accurate, but right now is a circus show.
---
Honestly rank shouldn't reset every month IMO. It creates this bottleneck of players in yellow/green ranks from reset constantly, and the only way to get out is if you keep playing a ton, since red ranks can take a while to reach.
---
But none of them exclusive for console or is it better on pc?
---
It can be a way for you to turn a shut out game in to one where you get at least one kill but it can be hard to do that without then fave camping that last hooked person. I don‚Äôt use it anymore but when all you have are vanilla perks it‚Äôs sometimes a better option than the garbage you‚Äôre getting in your blood web.
---
That too but I'm at peace with fuckups happening.  But seriously how haven't they at least added a prompt yet?  That shit would take them 2 seconds.  Tiny mini patch just to prevent people from accidentally ruining the game for all players involved.
---
Mhm. Pretty much the exact reason he's such a cunt lol. Dude also went to my Steam profile and spammed my screenshot comments telling me to kill myself. This is why I have profile comments set to friends only. I get to Rank 3 as both Survivor and Killer and the only reason I'm not Rank 1 is because I don't find it fun to spam Adrenawin and Nofunurse every game.
---
Me and my friends have turned this dude's comment into a copypasta shitpost. Whenever someone complains about bad teammates at low ranks we tell them to "keep being shit and hardstuck purple."
---
Oh yeah I think so too
---
Ruin. Thana. Nurses. Sloppy. If you can. Frenzy multiple survivors IF you can, it may take time as you cant always make it the heartbeat and will have to learn how to gauge distance. Don't double hit with frenzy, this is just a free boost for survivors. BREAK PALLETS
---
Isnt that just on private matches?
---
Maybe a homemade smoke bomb a survivor made from materials found in a trial
---
Had a whole team switch last second to all claudettes with a flashlight.
---
Joke was on them though, I already had Franklin's and an ebony mori on.
---
Not saying that it is an us vs them, as some of those survivors likely play killer as well. Though chances are a handful of those players are one in the same in terms of toxicity. I'm just saying that lately I've been seeing it way more consistently in my killer games than survivor.
---
In my experience if you hide it after one game it will stay hidden until you unhide it.
---
Source: Am a salty PC player
---
What in the cinnamon toast f\*\*\* is this?
---
It‚Äôs an absolute shit perk that terrible killers use as a crutch to get downs at the end because they struggled the entire match. 
---
So if you never want to improve or learn how to play the game, use that.
---
Hey, that's not fair. 
---
Surveillance is alright too.
---
Why the piggy stunt sound its so cute? And why youve done it like that?
---
Though I have been seeing a lot of them running bloodhound as of late. They can't see blood trails while in frenzy but makes it easier to find people after it ends
---
A killer that could actually create obstacles might be cool
---
Its hard enough getting into games at higher ranks. A new gamemode would split the player base in half most likely and then it will make it take even longer for a game. The player base isnt high enough and the devs are focused on bug fixes and new content rather than dividing the player base.
---
lol
---
Yeah I agree!! X perk is way better than Y perk! Seriously guys, it‚Äôs mostly preference lol
---
Slugging seems to be working its way into the meta for some reason lately, maybe survivor slugging perks can get a buff at some point. I‚Äôd like to see Tenacity hide pools of blood and make you quieter in dying state like Iron Will. Other than that yeah I wouldn‚Äôt run anything of that type besides unbreakable.
---
Same with ruin for me.
---
Very situational. Yesterday I commited to a gen while the Demo was on the way over. Tried to vault killer shack window when it was suddenly blocked. He got a free down because of it.
---
√ôW√ö MISTEW MICHAEW PWEASE DONT SWICE ME
---
Run away, not just run in circles to try and frustrate someone into walking away. Defend it all you want, but it's still cheap.
---
Its removing the biggest threat they have. take it as a compliment, it shows that you‚Äôre too dangerous to leave alive
---
Not when you‚Äôre discussing potential functional use. We‚Äôre not talking about fun here, there are better and worse perks.
---
Agree with the previous answer, they're both great, so either trust your heart or get them both. I'd say Myers is more consistent, while Ghostface is rather situational because of the reveal mechanic. Ghostface can crouch, completely lose his terror radius and lean from cover, so he is better at playing it stealthy and giving survivors a spook. If you're on a good map or the survivors are not paying attention, allowing you to get some sweet sneak attacks done, Ghostface works just fine and he's very satisfying to play.
---
So pop, devour, discordance, BBQ.
---
Thanks for all the help.
---
Yeah because theres a counter againts Gen Rushing ü§£
---
PS4 frames dropped off a cliff with the update.  It basically undid the entire console optimization patch.
---
Is ruin good on other killers though?
---
Rules?

I had a game the other night where I did a ton of generator work, then got hooked on my way to the exit gate, one of the two remaining survivors left and messaged me after and said ‚Äúsorry‚Äù like lol fuck you

The other one stuck around but my thumb got sore and accidentally let up on A smash for a second (Xbox) and I died :/

Your [submission](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/d898a5/can_you_fix_this_bug_please/) to /r/deadbydaylight has been automatically removed for the following reason;
---
Cool thanks
---
Ghostface stalks individuals, and has a nice easy indicator to show how stalked a person is. Ghostface has no penalty for stalking at range, and can even buff his stalk speed by leaning. His downside is that he can be knocked out of it, and that hitting survivors removes all stalk progress.
---
Myers has to look at a survivor to see how much juice they have left, his stalk is weaker at range, but when he hits T3 his instadown can be applied to *anyone* and there's no way to force him out of it other than to run him out.
---
Ghostface is kind of a finesse version of Myers - he's a regular M1 killer if you can't get his power down. If you can think like a survivor then you'll arguably do better with Ghostface in the long run.
---
If you were just looking at perks, though, then Myers would be far and away the better purchase.
---
If they just run away they‚Äôre going to lose. The killer is faster and will catch them. Look, I am a killer main and what you‚Äôre saying is nonsense. If anything the devs should look at some of the loops and fix them so they are not infinitely loopable but telling survivors not to loop because at cheap is ridiculous.
---
God, last year‚Äôs event was horrible. Couldn‚Äôt ever escape because nobody would do objective, had far too many killers in a row feel the need to run ebony mori‚Äôs. That was a terrible time and I really, really don‚Äôt want to play it again.

How the turntables
---
Dead hard for most players, but balanced landing for advanced players. Deadhard mostly exists to give you  bit of extra mistake allowance, letting you reach a pallet or widow you relly shouldn't have gone for, or avoid a swing because you found yourself in a dead part of the map. Balanced landing is harder to use and on some maps, completely useless, but the passive opens up new loops which are impossible or just ineffective without it which deadhard doesn't do for you.
---
Today I logged in, fuck survivors.
---
I mentioned that
---
Tactical pick!
---
Its more of a fence, actually. And he can only place them where there already existing fences are.
---
Survivors: just trying to play the game
---
One bitey boi with an Ebony: M U N C H
---
It's really the only counter killers have to the gen rush.  I rarely use it but if I see 2 or more survivors going into the game with a tool box I most definitely use it.
---
You want a big terror radius on him, as his killer instinct is tied to it. Also, only use feral frenzy when there are multiple survivors around you or to patrol gens. Using it in a 1v1 chase is pointless. 
---
Addons: Only use power recovery and length boosting. The rest make little to no difference (Like dead ass the ‚ÄúConsiderably‚Äù on the cooldown reduction only brings it down by .3 seconds) 
---
Perks: Thanatophobia, Bamboozle, Nurse‚Äôs, and BBQ.
---
There is.  It's called learn how to play the role and pressure the gens.  Gen pressure is how you stop gen rushing.  But if you are entering games with the assumption that you the killer have no control over the speed at which the gens pop than you've lost already.
---
New patch comes new bugs and we have learned to accept it. Yet, we expect better. I was looking forward to using a new perk this weekend, Dying Light, in my build, but nope, it crashes the game so I can't even play what I want to play.
---
Again, we deserve better, but the community puts up with what we have. For example, we put up with having to reinvite everyone to a lobby for three years.
---
That's just how the devs have always been unfortunately.  It's as if they don't know their own game sometimes. For example, at one point they made escaping down from 5k bp to 4k bp. Furthermore, at one point, killers could get stunned at any point in the animation during a pallet stun or flashlight blind.
---
Makes you think.. but the games like a cigarette and you.. we.. are addicted.
---
Quentins are gentle spirits
---
What do you mean? Spine Chill is a great perk and it has so many uses. I still use it at rank 1 a lot of the time.
---
first time i saw a hatch pop up right infront of a player
---
It's not like I'm teabagging or face-camping though. I'm playing a different style than usual matches. Just because survivors just want to get chased and run loops doesn't mean they can't have fun when I stand still and wait for them to come near me. It requires them to have a different type of awareness than they are probably used to. I find it's usually the higher ranks that throw salt, which makes me think that they are just mad that I didn't play "their way".
---
The game has already more or less lost its appeal when half the players quit halfway through. Playing sweaty basically translates to trying to win, which I certainly do because I am not interested in prolonging a game like that artificially.
---
not this one. just me and my friend with 2 randoms
---
Thank you very much!
---
Sorry, I was under the impression that all looping was infinite looping. Like when they run in circles around the same piece of cover. That's cheap, and can't be countered unless you perfectly time changing your direction.
---
I like this idea, after he ate his nuget, and passed away alone in the tunnel, the entity took him.
---
That show is called Stranger Things
---
Yesterday I (rank 8) joined a lobby with an obviously new Dweet (rank 13), a rank 1 and rank 3.
---
Dweet was hyped, typing something along the lines of "yeah, team, let\`s go!" just to be shat on  by the rank 1 for not being up there with them and the reds would have to carry the team. Not sure their entitled asses grasped the concept of leaving a lobby if it wasn\`t to their liking. I sure did leave.
---
\*edit: word
---
title is also the name of my sex tape btw
---
I really want to play. But I like playing killer, the pressure and toxic survivors just ruin the mood. I end up being more upset than happy playing a game
---
If I got killed by a bunch of edgelord teenage punks I'd be crying too
---
I love playing wraith. Bing bong boi is fun, has a few different tactics u can use, and he isn't normally played by most killer mains. That and he's drop dead sexy!
---
After returning to DBD after a six month hiatus, I have a few stupid "from the outside looking in " questions:
---
1.  Why THE FUCK hasn't WGLF been buffed to counter BBQ and chili?  "After unhooking a survivor, you and the unhooked survivor both see the killers aura for 4/5/6 seconds".
---
Or, to be more fair, any time some with the perk unhooks another survivor, ALL survivors see the killers aura for 4/5/6 seconds.
---
But NOPE.
---
2.  I see they beat the fuck out of DS with the useless stick...but no changes made to NOED,  BBQ, etc.
---
Wow.
---
3.  Why is Deliverance still TOTAL FUCKING GARBAGE?!  In order for this perk to even WORK, you need to unhook a survivor BEFORE being hooked yourself,  because the mechanic is USELESS in hook phase 2.
---
Not to mention if you manage to go the entire match, be the last survivor,  get hooked on a cheap NOED crutch, and instead of the CLUTCH kobe moment you were expecting, you get a PHAT DIKK IN THE ARSE because we all know if your the last one hooked but it's your first hook, ALL phased get skipped for....REASONS. 
---
4.  Also, since when can killers do.lunge attacks AROUND CORNERS?!
---
5.  Also, since there are now like 3 times as perks as before, when are we going to see the addition of more actual perk SLOTS?  1, maybe 2 at most would allow for TONS more game playstyle customization.
---
Thank you so much! This helps most
---
This perk sound so good on paper but it's such shit IRL.
---
If I accidentally tunnel I usually teabag for a full minute before scooping em up
---
The only acceptable Insidious Leatherface is the Bubba standing in the basement guarding he chest. 
---
Or maybe the bubba hides bag by the exit gates. 
---
Have *fun^ with it.
---
Very strong but badly designed perk where the killer is rewarded with an instadown and extra movement speed as a reward for playing poorly and losing all 5 objectives to the opponents.  It's basically designed for brand new killers which you are so mess with it if you want and don't feel bad about it.  Just know that if you do run it you don't want to continue running it as you begin to learn the game better.  It'll stunt the growth of your killer play immensely and set you back months with the bad habits the perk teaches.
---
Kates
---
How come Franklin's Demise doesn't work on pigs dash attack or Hags Phantasm attacks? You would think jumpscaring survivors with a surprise attack would cause them to drop an item but apparently not. Does this also mean sloppy butcher effects aren't being applied if they aren't dropping their item from Franklin's too?
---
Reeeeeee made up rules. How about you go play a regular survivor match, where you lead the killer on a chase for 3 minutes and get facecamped for 2 full hook states? That‚Äôs the state of the game right now. Literally just as many toxic killers.
---
Its so fun for goatt face
---
Depends one the rank, but it's not that much
---
I understand that. Especially when you've used good addons or offerings and waited for so long in queue. But I hope you understand why I'd move on to another game after my team (who I dont know) decided to disconnect. There's just no appeal for survivors to stay in an unfair game. It just sucks all around I guess.
---
*Steve scream is heard from all angles*
---
Well that's kinda the point, look at far off he is from the pallet. Unless he's getting stunned by the stiff wind it doesn't make a ton of sense. The pallet hitbox is totally fucked.
---
Ranch
---
okay admittedly this is a funny meme but why are they following him??
---
No auras are viewable into or out of s locker. I run Bond and can‚Äôt see anyone while I‚Äôm in a locker. 
---
As to Ruin, I think it depends on if you can consistently hit the skill check. But even if you can, don‚Äôt work it with another person. When you fail a check (including Succeeding with a ruin checks) a gen can‚Äôt progress for 3 seconds. The checks come so often you will make so little progress with multiple people on the gen. 
---
That said, even if you can make the checks, others likely can‚Äôt. I say killing the ruin is better.
---
and blacks and gays too
---
I've just been using ruin, myc, dh and bbq with her. It's pretty nasty. Or instead of dh I'll use distressing just for the extra bp.
---
I've never seen so many people quit so fast before. I've been running the same build on the new killer too. Idk what it is about distressing to survivors these days but they just reveal themselves when they hear that heartbeat and you're no where near them.
---
I don't feel bad for it either. It's just part of the game and my objective as the killer. Just like it's my objective as a survivor to do gens and get those spicy flashlight saves and pallet stuns on killers. There's nothing toxic about it.
---
I wouldn't use it if you want to get better at playing killer. at the end of the day, if survivors cleanse all of the totems, it's avoidable. however, if you are only getting hooks/kills after the survivors have finished all 5 gens, that's sad asf.
---
rip you
---
Scarred hand hag
---
She still gets looped like every other killer. Huntress can instantly knock someone down a health state at loops and tiles. You can‚Äôt vomit someone into the downed state.
---
Killers: teabagging is toxic
---
Isnt he Asian though?
---
It does and honestly just crack on with gens and get good at those skill checks. If you're playing solo you have no clue if someone else is searching so your best bet is to stay put and work on the primary objective. Finding ruin doesn't open the exit gates!
---
Ah yes the mighty goatt face. I think goatt is a bit OP
---
Yeah, that's why I changed my gen/hatch escape to triangle instead of R1. You should too because if a survivor gets downed at a pallet, chances are you're throwing down that pallet before you can get the heal prompt to show up.
---
true though.
---
Greetings, Tenno.
---
Yeah, I'll wholesale hook camp the asshole after helping at least one of the remaining survivors get back up when shit like this happens, assuming no one's running things to get themselves back up, of course. Then I'll just set up a campfire and grab the marshmallows as I await the asshole's pissed off PM. Like... my dude, you brought this shit on yourself. Not only did you guarantee that you'd get camped, but I'll probably even be extra nice to the rest of the teammates who had to deal with you and let them all escape.
---
I'll still chase 'em and hit 'em once if they're healthy 'cause we all need those points, but I won't down any of 'em again. 
---
Do not make the killer vindictive!
---
There's always a gen in the room that Eleven's papa locked her in

Keep pressing M1

Nah lol

The ultimate camouflage

It's an connection error I think. Did you restart you console?

Ok Republican

Yeah I felt bad too. I think this huntress was doing a daily but I honestly didn‚Äôt expect to get the blind.
---
Pc, and no should i?
---
Same man, would give this man gold/silver if I had any more
---
Hes scary af on the new map.
---
I‚Äôve definitely accidentally thrown down a pallet when trying to heal some down, that‚Äôs a good idea thanks.
---
Who‚Äôs gon tell em üëÄ
---
I just want New Nightmare Fred. But as someone else mentioned, licensing is stupid so getting a good version of him is probably never gonna happen.
---
We're all stuck with Jackie Earl Krueger.
---
i have a clip from one time where i was looking for survivors, saw some scratchmarks headed towards a corner and tried to sneak my way around the other way and rounded an obstacle to find the survivor crouched down looking away from me.   they got insta-downed and DC‚Äôd.  good times.
---
Goatt stimulator
---
Stop trying to make sense of it. It‚Äôs purely a M1 vs Special attack; it doesn‚Äôt work when being hit by a chainsaw, which you‚Äôd think would cause anyone to drop everything.
---
Noob3 plays for fun, and doesn‚Äôt take the game all that seriously, which is very refreshing.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt remember their gt but this huntress only had one perk I think they might‚Äôve been doing a daily.
---
You should have grabbed NOED. Exposed status effect is ultra effective when everybody already has the Broken effect.
---
The fuck are you supposed to do? LET them unhook? This isn‚Äôt a sarcasm comment, I genuinely wonder what the fuck thought in their head makes it seem ok to call you out for legit the only good strategy left when they are healing at the gate, then rushing the hook?
---
It‚Äôs basically a second chance for killer.
---
Thank you :]
---
If an extension wasnt announced then there's no extension

&gt;Women have equal rights. At least here in the US.
---
Not a US citizen and also not a woman so cannot elaborate on that and it's better coming from someone with more knowledge and experience on that specific situation. You can still be a feminist though regardless.
---
&gt; Not sure who's bashing women.
---
The original comment which was implying Donald Trump was some innocent guy (Surv) and feminists are evil (Killers.)
---
Donald Trump has plenty of valid reasons for people to bash him. Bashing people who are demanding equal rights for women is abit... Stupid?
---
Why are all your questions ‚ÄúWhy haven‚Äôt the Devs...‚Äù as if we‚Äôd know? If you just want to rant, start an actual thread. These aren‚Äôt legit questions. 
---
As to 5. Never. That would likely break the spaghetti code.
---
Dwight potterfield.
---
To bad he went insane and started killing motherfuckas

Sure, but since when is that fun? That‚Äôs what I never understood about ppl who cheat or derank. If there‚Äôs no challenge, how are u enjoying yourself?
---
&gt; "Lost productivity"
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Yet you vouch for WGLF
---
Potential 100% bonus BP ain't waste of productivity, quite the contrary :)
---
I just got on to play though and it works ü§î 
---
I should probably delete this so they don‚Äôt shut it down
---
Honestly most of the licensed killers would never bow to the entity, which is why the entity is one of my biggest gripes about the DBD lore. It made sense when we just had Billy, Wraith and Trapper, but now it just conflicts with so many of the new characters that have been brought in. Even worse though, from the beginning it always detracted from the killers being intimidating or scary, because they are just second best obedient dogs to the knock off Pennywise. The killers should be the apex, not some thirsty spidey boi who can't do things for itself.
---
Don't dedicate to a chase so much that you don't stop till they're down. Get a hit and if it drags too long, leave to go patrol generators, also don't blindly walk around, always ALWAYS patrol generators
---
I remember when I first started and didn‚Äôt know that quickly jumping into a locker notified the killer, which was unfortunate since I‚Äôve been a true Dwight main since day 1
---
Usually that tag is used for spoilers.
---
It‚Äôs assumed the more broken/monstrous looking killers had to cocered into killing while the ‚Äúnormal‚Äù ones gladly took to it. So Hag and Doctor for instance were brutalized to do it, while Myers and Clown took to it like fish to water.
---
Because it's easier to blame someone else than accept the fact that you have a small dick.
---
Then it's not a game anymore, it's a puzzle. 
---
Also this is kind of unrelated, but I hate when survivors stand by the exit gates and teabag instead of just leaving. Strong overlap with assholes and people who run in an infinite loop around a single piece of cover.
---
Someone? More like 2 people it‚Äôs really dumb if 2 people DC because they are salty
---
I honestly agree with this almost entirely its nice to round out since most tier lists seem to favor putting chase power above everything else it‚Äôs nice to see a well rounded list and A tier flower power is a must
---
Except that doesn't actually mean anything. We could also say that the game was balanced around no Ruin so Ruin should not exist.
---
The entity does Myer's bidding.
---
You can't tell evil incarnate what to do.
---
Many situations where it saves time .
---
Yea, Quentin doesnt even have any customization. Seems strange.
---
I can't really tell you it's something you need to see visually.  There are mindgames one can use to end loops at many types of different pallets as well as T and L Walls.  You need to watch some YouTube videos man so you can see what we are talking about because with no insult intended you sound quite clueless still.  I'm assuming you're still relatively new to the game?  NotOtzdarva is fantastic and might really help you out. Because playing killer without knowing how to end loops is like repairing gens as a survivor with your eyes closed.  It's not gonna end well.
---
I really like your style, it fits the characters pretty well. It reminds me of the Total Drama series, but better. I‚Äôd probably enjoy watching a cartoon like this.
---
And Jane Romero will pay the blood points for the wall?
---
No. Stun from it is so long that just breaking it normally is faster
---
Is this pic new ?
---
I have plague and the gen perk unlocked already and have iron will unlocked already
---
???
---
Purple + yellow Calms are the range add-ons
---
Monitor and Abuse is a perk
---
The range add-on was for comparison
---
i have rarely, if ever, had a game i could see the exit gates from a single place tbh. Not that im saying its impossible, but if it is a thing, i do agree it should be tweaked. as i said, my main issue was the hatch spawning when theyve done like a single or even no gens
---
&gt;Not a US citizen and also not a woman so cannot elaborate on that.
---
You don't need to be a certain sex or from a specific place in order to agree/disagree.
---
&gt;The original comment which was implying Donald Trump was some innocent guy (Surv) and feminists are evil (Killers.)  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Donald Trump has plenty of valid reasons for people to bash him. Bashing people who are demanding equal rights for women is abit... Stupid?
---
Firstly, Being a woman ‚â† being a feminist. In fact, many women have great disdain for that label. Secondly, there are plenty of reasons to bash *feminism* as well. But this isn't the venue for that kind of conversation.
---
Your assumption is incorrect. My complaint is over survivors who run in a circle around a single piece of cover. How was I supposed to know that wasn't what looping meant?
---
Good argument. Independent BTW.
---
Ruin shouldn't be base kit unless they feel they need to rebalance the game. Just like BL shouldn't be base kit. Survivors can do stuff to gain distance and stuff that loses distance, height was always one of the losing.  Using a perk to break the rules is fine, it happens to both sides and its what perks are about in this game...
---
why would a really skilled killer play standard? Slugging efficiently gives you an advantage and allows much more map control.
---
If you don‚Äôt like Spirit i would get Rancor then. Breakdown just isn‚Äôt worth it unless you have all the perks unlocked and just want BP.
---
Never mind it needs to update
---
Premonition will activate in the same situations and tell you more information. Also,  neither of those two are supposed to work on Tier 1 Myers. And generally you don‚Äôt heal in terror radius if you‚Äôre not an idiot.
---
Idk the blade seems a bit grimy to get a good reflection out of. I don‚Äôt think michael keeps it polished.
---
Dude i just want to de rank, i got kinda boosted by my new friend and going against new killers and im not good enough to be in green ranks
---
Lol  love how you already know the answer you just don't like it
---
Let's be honest Ruin gets the same hate as noted so pick your poison.  
---
As far map pressure and discordance goes...  Depending on the map and killer, it's not unreasonable for survivors with a boxes to get at least 1 get a gen done by the time you get to them and certainly two before you get your first down (short of a crappy survivor being the one found first).
---
Honestly I only play wraith with the coxcomb + soot combo and if they gave him those Addons base, or even just the soot addon as part of his power he would feel so much better as a stealth killer
---
Fair enough. I guess it just baffles me how intense some people play this game.
---
Nope, breaking the pallet from dashing far away, can hit survivor while they vault and you break the pallet still, can catch survivor off guard. It‚Äôs only quicker if you are close to the pallet, in which case you won‚Äôt be going for dashes just like you go for normal swings when possible instead of The shred
---
The issue is that ruin (or game slowing perks) are basically a must for slower killers \[Trapper, Wraith\] if they want to keep up, while being equally as strong on S killers. And if you're playing a strong killer and have access to this strong perk and want to win, it makes logical sense to use it.  
---
The perk is too strong, yes, but if they nerfed it in it's current state it would be a huge detriment to slower killers and widen the unbalance even more.
---
*Killers.  I have a healthy rotation I mix it up with.  Killers provided left to right based on how often I play them.
---
Trapper, Freddy, Wraith, Plague, Legion, Meyers, Billy, Doctor, Hag, Leatherface.
---
It's funny because I'm assuming you made that comment with the assumption I just sweat it out with Nurse and Spirit which is why I keep talking up gen pressure but as you can see I main bottom tier/weaker killers more often than I don't.  I've always been attracted to the weaker killers where you have to work for it a bit more.
---
Gotta get those WGLF tokens
---
Because their fucking ego depends on how hard they "win" and anything short of full domination means they should really consider that bottle of pills next to the bed tonight for realsies.
---
Crap. 
---
Well to rephrase, she is a better huntress if they cleanse, yes. But most good survivors don‚Äôt cleanse meaning she‚Äôs left to be an M1 killer who can one shot. Doctor is better since good shocks at loops make the survivors defenseless to a hit and illusionary pallets bait survivors for free hits too. He also wastes their time with madness 3 and is the best at finding survivors. Nothing in Plague‚Äôs kit prevents survivors from running her around as long as the survivors aren‚Äôt stupid and don‚Äôt cleanse. That plus no map pressure is a pretty average killer.
---
Because, and this is from them, what's the fun in playing full try hard 24/7. Plus it sucks to play against.
---
I wish I had teammates like you when I solo queüò≠
---
Because Corrupt doesn‚Äôt address the problem of the gens still being done extremely fast. It just removes all but 3 gens from play for a whole 2 minutes. Doesn‚Äôt stop them from being done though.
---
Except I never said BL Speed should be base kit. You are ignoring my entire point on this. 
---
If the game was not balanced to have Ruin why do we have Ruin?  Because it was balanced AROUND the game meaning that it can exist as if it is base kit. I don't see any reason why you can't have a lesser slow after landing considering how absolutely crippling it is.
---
That purple Jason was Retro Jason, based off the NES Friday the 13th.
---
I'm actually starting to see some validity in this. I personally try to avoid DC'ing, but honestly if the killer wants to ruin the game for the other 2 I say the other 2 should DC and let the killer sit his ass back in the 15 minute queue to think about life a bit. Survivors can get a game in 10 seconds.
---
Ey bro i point blank shred 24/7 i need them bloodpoints ever since the game cucked me out of 3 finished dailies
---
B and C are all very close to each other in terms of strength. So I understand if you think Doctor is lower. I just think he‚Äôs pretty balanced in terms of chase shutdown, game slowdown and tracking.
---
oof.avi
---
I really hope BHVR fixes it soon. In any case, I've never watched Stranger Things but I've always wanted to.
---
No not really. He's a good guy I like him. In fact I used to be his editor. I quit DBD a long time ago and only recently joined back. I came to watch him in order to get an idea as to what playing killer is like. I watched him and it felt a bit iffy so I watched some other killer streamers and they seemed way more sharp, precise and better at the game. Yeah it takes skill to get to rank 1 but I've got there and it's not exactly the hardest thing. As a person, he's cool, apart from when he complains in games which he used to do (a bit less now) a lot and it got annoying. But as a killer, he just isn't really too great compared to many other highly skilled killers.
---
Next DLC confirmed?
---
You said it was fair. No its not, just like any perk it isn't, it gives a advantage that wasn't meant to be in the base game. Sure they try to make sure it doesn't break stuff but its not fair, just like any perk isn't.
---
I love demo, but it feels like an absolute waste to play him right now. When his "hotfix" goes live it'll feel much better to play him.
---
He's more a jack of all trades and a master of none, but he's decent with literally everything in the game
---
*Angry breathing at this heresy*
---
&gt; You don't need to be a certain sex or from a specific place in order to agree.
---
I'm not going to agree on something I am not educated in. 
---
Since I'm not american, nor a woman, I do not know the specifics of being an American woman.
---
So unlike you, I refuse to speak on behalf of them.
---
&gt;Firstly, Being a woman ‚â† being a feminist. In fact, many women have great disdain for that label.
---
I never even said being a woman = being a feminist, There are women all over the world who are being told what to do by men daily and don't see it as an issue because they don't know any better. That's part of the whole thing.
---
Most women are feminists regardless of choosing to use the label or not. 
---
Being a feminist is normal, You don't have to openly identify as it but If you do not believe women deserve equal rights then you are just a sexist. There is no inbetween here, It's pretty black and white.
---
&gt; Secondly, there are plenty of reasons to bash feminism as well.
---
No. There are not.
---
There are reasons to bash the actions of certain individuals who claim to be feminists (But actually aren't as they want superior rights, not equal.) There are however no reasons to bash the textbook definition of feminism since it is literally just equal treatment.
---
400 for a bandaid that has limitations and won't work for everyone is kinda meh really. According to EnChroma, as many as 80 percent of people with color vision problems may be helped by the company's lens technology. *But each person's color vision deficiency is unique, and so is their reaction to color blind glasses.*
---
Always...
---
The true new meta is inner strength, self care, second wind, and finally
---
No mither
---
Every killer has the same lunge range now except for T1&amp;3 Myers.
---
My assumption is incorrect?  Dude with all due respect how are you not new when you A. Don't understand what looping is and B. Are still convinced it has no possible counterplay?  If this is the case it's tragic and seriously man let's get you on YouTube and watching some killer vids that will help.  They will literally teach you what looping is and strats on how to counter each individual one and the ones that have little counterplay they can at least identify for you so you know which chases to abandon.  I'm yelling you NotOtzdarva please check him out he will help you out so much dude.  This isn't insults it's genuinely me trying to help a struggling killer learn the mechanics of the game do they stop feeling powerless in their games.
---
That's fine.
---
But regardless of if it's fleshed out or not, it needs to be mandatory.
---
nah he kinda sucks though
---
Yes,it was the last match i play
---
Now you can rest, as the sun rises on a grateful universe. The baby dweets jumping from locker to locker, the looming Michaels staring them down with murderous intent. You can start to make things all better again. With 4 Iridescents, and 32,000 bloodpoints.
---
Lol I play more killer but I remember looping a noob trapper for 4 gens cause he couldn't place is traps correctly
---
Ew, just ew.
---
Wraith is probably forced
---
Shhh stop you'll ruin it :D
---
Oooh that's even better than my perk build
---
Yeah thats not fun though. Its bad game design to punish players for doing well
---
Do you remember what you felt was wrong with them?
---
Her skins or her? Because she plays with the deliberate murderous intent of John Kramer, trap design of Detective Hoffman, and movement speed of Dr. Gordon.
---
Yeah because that‚Äôs not an answer, more so an excuse. For example Fungoose is arguably the best killer in the community, he 4ks 9/10 games at red ranks using Plague no addons and doesn‚Äôt ever have to use NOED. Actually good killers will tell you NOED isn‚Äôt an ideal perk unless you need that one pity kill at the end
---
Ruin doesn‚Äôt get nearly the same hate, it‚Äôs a sweaty perk but I have no problem with it. And Ruin isn‚Äôt meant to stay up the whole game, it‚Äôs meant to give you time to get the game started and get pressure going. If you tunnel the first guy you see and Ruin is popped and you haven‚Äôt hooked anyone then that‚Äôs on you. 
---
And I don‚Äôt understand what you‚Äôre trying to say. If you overcommit to a chase on one person then of course gens will get done, survivors don‚Äôt have to sit around and wait until you‚Äôre ready for gens to pop. Learn when to abandon a chase and find someone else. Can‚Äôt count how many times I spend time on a survivor then realize he‚Äôs wasting my time so I chainsaw and snipe some guy doing a gen. Rotation and map pressure
---
You‚Äôve got a lot going on. 
---
1: If you want to counter bbq you can hide in lockers or run Distortion. I don‚Äôt know if you mean ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù instead of counter but WGLF is kinda dodge because if it did any other in game effect, any perk that also does that effect immediately becomes useless. My idea is combining it with We‚Äôll Make It. 
---
2: DS was definitely not making anyone‚Äôs game fun and the new DS is passively and actively stronger now. When you see someone get unhooked, you have to be cautious about getting them up because Enduring no longer reduces the stun and the stun is always 5 seconds at every perk tier. Also after you get unhooked you're basically immune to danger for 60 seconds. At end game, this becomes a free escape in most cases. 
---
3: Deliverance is just a niche. It has its own requirements but like DS (funny enough, DS and Deliverance is a really funny perk combo to run right now) it can let you make a play with certainty. 
---
4: Lunges have distance and lunging around a corner is actually more risky if you don‚Äôt know if a pallet is there or not. It‚Äôs part of mind gaming survivors too. You moonwalk around and prime a lunge as you round the corner to give less reaction time. 
---
5: I don‚Äôt really think a 5th or 6th perk spot would really help anything. If anything, I feel like it would mostly exacerbate the issues we have with our current killer and survivor perk meta.
---
Pallet-Burn Plague?
---
The only time I go look for the Ruin totem is if I am playing against a Doctor. The moving Ruin skill checks are a huge pain in the butt to hit consistently.
---
If you miss a Ruin skill check, just stop working on the gen for a couple seconds so you don't trigger another skill check during the progression pause.
---
Oh, i use every killer too I mostly use wraith to climb up to red ranks since its more fun, so nothing impressive about you using mostly low tiers nice try, trying to flex ü§£.  But when you face a team full of commodius tool boxes and have 3 gens pop while chasin one guy, tell me how to counter that. Since YOU can counter that, right?
---
1/10
---
Her skins. Pig is also really annoying for me to go against
---
How  do I delete this post. New to posting. Was supposed to be Freddy with sunglasses.
---
Except matchmaking is broken and you get matched up with grey rank killers
---
Both of you couldn't escape?
---
Human Anatomy is a bit difficult for me so, it‚Äôs a main focus for me. Thanks for the feedback!!
---
You should‚Äôve let them die.
---
You don't really have to full try hard 24/7. As long as you got the skills to pay the bills just sit back and do what's logical. Not too hard and it's pretty fun to utilise your skills and destroy the dumb ass survivors.
---
Wraith is highkey forced if you look into his backstory
---
Boss had him unknowingly kill many people, and he only killed his boss out of a fit of pure adrenaline filled rage after he watched the guy murder a person he had tried to save.
---
I'm working and in college. The game was enjoyable back when I played it, but then they nerfed Jigsaw so it's kind of not fun anymore.
---
Furthermore, everything you're describing, it's not a game anymore, it's a puzzle. I don't want to solve a puzzle and make intense game theory calculations, I want to play a game and have fun.
---
This! Some survivors absolutely know how to abuse this shit to the max
---
Edgy
---
I'm 20 and this has more potential than my art now lol. Draw your next favorite killer.
---
Yep. When you play against high ranked survivors the cam gets crazy every time they 360 you. 
---
I mean, good for them. I wish I could do that! But I also wish auto aim could just be disabled
---
The Trapper actually pierced himself with hooks. The pain of it makes him angrier, which allows him to do his job better. Knowing his backstory, it makes sense he would do that.
---
Doc Ock is crazy. He wants to torture people physically and mentally. He probably did whatever he did to himself just to make himself scarier.
---
Freddy and Ghostface definitely love it there, because the Entity is actually giving them what they want. Freddy especially looks forward to torturing Quentin, his nemesis. The thing is, lore-wise, there's a lot more survivors and killers than we know about. The Fog has countless other killers and the Entity wouldn't just feed on a select few survivors at a time.
---
I‚Äôm getting close to finishing another drawing, keep your eye out for another post of mine!
---
Ghostface is one of the only killers to scare the shit outta me. Him and Myers. Absolutely terrifying.
---
I dont play doc or nurse too often. Im a Freddy main, but if theres a daily for them, I will. Constantly patrol your gennys, maybe rock discordance to let you know when there are 2 or more on a genny. Just need some perks that give you Intel where they are or that will slow their progress on gens. Or some add ons to buff you. I use my dream pallets mainly. And anything that slows their progress on gennys
---
I personally rock discordance, bbq, Rancor and tremors. I looked up all the perks and decided to go for those because I felt they would compliment freddys new genporting ability. Its been working well for me. If you see a survivor, dont tunnel too long. If a gen has been popped while in a chase I'll break away towards the genny.
---
I just patrol the outer edge of the map to check on gennys, working my way inward. With the nurse thats a little easier, Blink gen to gen. Doc you just need to shock a few times to check for them. If I see someone I chase, if I feel they have looped me a bit too long I'll break away to go find someone else. By this point my discordance has kicked in and I'll already have a new target.
---
Ruin is a good way to slow down a trial, but with the new inner strength out, totems arent safe. Listen to your crows, train your ears to hear those grunts of pain or lockers opening and closing. pay close attention, see any sign of scratch marks, head towards it. Not all survivors will be well coordinated, you'll win some and you'll lose some. Just gotta learn all the killer perks and figure out a build that works for you. 
---
I hope some of this was useful. Im not an expert at all, but I do average about 3-4 kills per trial. Every few trials the survivors give me a good run and I only get 1 or 2. But I make them work for it. Just keep at it and practice. And also, maybe doc or nurse might not be your killers. Find a killer you can vibe with. Sorry for rambling on lol see you in the fog.
---
Jane is going to get deported lul
---
If you're not chasing or have at least one survivor hooked at any given time, it's the not survivors fault for "gen rushing", that's the killers fault for being AFK or just taking a stroll throughout the map.
---
I was motivated to do this list after the people on the official forums posted their pretty terrible tier lists (no offense). My placements were based off everything which makes a killer good.
---
1. Map pressure/game slowdown
---
2. Chase shutdown
---
3. Tracking
---
4. Base movement speed
---
Oh quite possibly. People get upset for all different kinds of reasons.
---
I've only used Insidious as a joke, but I think it's generally seen as a camping perk. There aren't many other good uses for it unless you're playing basement Bubba or something.
---
GF on the new map is S tier.
---
47- WHY DID THE DOCTOR PRY HIS MOUTH AND EYES OPEN?
---
"Oh, no no no no, that's not how it works. Evan did not put the iron bars and hooks into his shoulder, and Sally did not choke herself with a pillowcase."
---
Taken from the Dev Lore Q and A
---
You're right. Why do you have downvotes?
---
It‚Äôs not just swf either.  Was playing with 2 friends last not.  All of us rank 7.  And it put us in a lobby with a rank 19 survivor and rank 20 killer.  
---
I mean I was happy for an easy pip and blood points but I‚Äôm guessing that killer didn‚Äôt have such a great time.
---
Top ten photos taken seconds before ^(E N T I T Y)
---
Watch true talent's how to play plague optimally vid. He doesnt use pallet-burn and only one gen gets completed.
---
Absolutely, here you go!
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Combat_Straps check change log.
---
They buffed her base crouch / uncrouch in the same patch to be fair, but there you are.
---
Nice but What does that have to do with the big teabagging?
---
the best way to get better is to learn from those who are better imo. that includes watching strong survivors and playing against strong killers. but i completely understand what u mean, it can be rough.
---
Nah, im not taking it personally
---
So you always put on franklins in the lobby if you see everyone with toolboxes?
---
I dont use ruin since in high ranks it doesnt last more than a minute, maybe 3 minutes at best, i do use pop though saved me quite a bit.
---
I mostly use Franklins on Legion since its an easy first hit and waste a bit of time picking up their items and then mending
---
Not really, since they aren‚Äôt the same character. The killer in Scary Movie is a parody of ghost face.
---
im p sure its implied that the Demogorgon we have is the one in the after credits from s3.
---
Ok, and I feel like McCready (or even Mary Elizabeth Winstead‚Äôs character, fucking LOVE her but can‚Äôt mind the characters name) are the obv survivor choice but hear me out... Nauls with his rollerblades?!
---
Haha, you wish it now. Just wait till you're working on a generator with a "buddy."
---
Oh shit. No mither that's the only perk I know

Self Care Gamers seem to enjoy it.  I don't think the entity has to push them very hard at all to kill survivors.

Yeah it‚Äôs really hard to browse by hot. No serious discussions are ever upvoted to front page. It‚Äôs all game clips of someone doing something moderately interesting, cosplay, overly done memes and maybe just maybe an original meme.

Think of it like this

Let‚Äôs say trapper is the only killer in Dead by Daylight and the only survivor is Dwight, now add Claudette as dlc and billy as dlc. You don‚Äôt need the dlc to play AGAINST Claudette and Billy.

I've never really watched Stranger Things so... idk what steve should actually sound like.

I didn't know there was a crash bug with Dying Light last night when I was messing with a build on Legion due to a Legion daily I had. It took me a few games to realize that crash was related to Dying Light.

&gt;I'm not going to agree on something I am not educated in.  
---
&gt;Since I'm not american, nor a woman, I do not know the specifics of being an American woman.  
---
&gt;So unlike you, I refuse to speak on behalf of them.
---
You should probably just say that you are not educated enough and leave it at that. We are discussing equal rights, which is in law. Your equivalence is like suggesting I can't speak on the death penalty because I'm not serving time myself.
---
&gt;I never even said being a woman = being a feminist
---
You asserted that making fun of feminists is an attack on women.
---
&gt;No. There are not.  
---
&gt;There are reasons to bash the actions of certain individuals who claim to be feminists (But actually aren't as they want superior rights, not equal.) There are however no reasons to bash the textbook definition of feminism since it is literally just equal rights.
---
Unfortunately, the leftist radicals like to redefine what things mean. At this moment there are battles to change the definitions and synonyms of words to align with their agenda's. By definition feminism is *the advocacy of women's rights on the basis of the equality of the sexes,* which is a fallacy as the sexes are not equal. A good example of this is feminists fighting for fitness test requirements to be reduced for women in emergency services, so they can be *equally* employed. The obvious issue with this is if they can't lift the weight of a person to carry them out of a burning building people will die. I suggest a read up on criticism of third-wave feminism.

Great now r/dbdgonewild has some new material

At the moment I'm just doing the survivor pov and what they discover. If the surv pov is great and you guys like it I'll try to do the killer pov but no promises
---
Season 2 came out two years ago... not really a spoiler at this point
---
Dying Light can cause it, if you‚Äôre running that I‚Äôd stop until it‚Äôs patched.
---
Well, he's a real person we can compare to whereas Jane has no actor to compare to.
---
Susie and Steve 
---
They are cute asf
---
This is true. Wraith does indeed bing bong.
---
Have you seen Jane? She's climaxing when the killer hits her.
---
Nasty
---
No one expects it, is the problem. Once they realize what I'm running it's usually too late &gt;:)
---
I think just making regression faster would be a quick and easy fix
---
Devs have said they wouldn‚Äôt put survivor looking killers
---
They said it couldn't be done!
---
this community is so divided killers act like its hard to just kill one person and give the other one the hatch to be nice. I do it all the time when I get dcs and I play both roles 50/50.    
---
I once had a ghostface and feng get super tryhard angry at me in the chat when there were 2 DC and I didn't give up struggling to let her get hatch. I just wanted the struggle points its not my fault the ghostface was pumping iron for e-sports or some fuck.
---
There were 2 bloody streamers lol like damn who cares that much abt winning or losing over this games stupid hard grind
---
I love playing as Ghostface to jump scare people! Very unpopular opinion but I love going against Legion and Ghostface. Idk why I just find them fun to face
---
&gt; The fuck are you supposed to do? LET them unhook?
---
In my experience there are survivors that literally believe this. They actually, 100% believe that you OWE them an unhook or you are playing wrong.
---
Too cute made me camed too fast
---
Lol good point. However I do know many people in Canada who follow US politics and like/dislike him.

Dude it's simple , sometimes when i want to use M1 or M2 it doesn't work  . For example : When i'm in chase with a survivor and i want to activate my power (m2) it doesn't activate .

---
he would kinda suck against survive with friends
---
But how do I do that?
---
new to the game, why is he called the shape and not the boogeyman like he's nicknamed in the halloween series?
---
Actually, it's kind of hinted that the hag made a deal with the entity in order to get the strength to get revenge on the cannibals that fed on her for so long. I think the reason she looks so malformed is because the entity sort of put her back together and, well... The entity is not really good at makeovers
---
honest I think it was ONLY overpowered with flashlights
---
having to arbitrarily time a pallet stun is so frustrating. maybe i'd feel a bit better if it wasn't so easy for the killer to block the pallet and keep you from getting the prompt idk
---
But why try to lure him away when you're the only one left alive and unhooked?
---
Nah she‚Äôs too dummy thick do get deported
---
As a killer main, that‚Äôs fine by me. 
---
Got my Franklins and Lightborn. Some of the easiest downs with those.
---
Original said teenagers instead of survivors
---
Good job missing the entire point of the thread.
---
Thats what happens when you try some kind of shitty insidious meme, or when a BAD killer does this tactic.  Not using any insidious/basement build bs, and assuming the killer is purple rank skilled, LF is the 3rd most effective killer at getting 3/4ks vs high rank swfs

Yeah, BBQ would be god tier aura reading if lockers didn't exist. And even with BBQ why would you use such thing as trapper/doctor etc.. by the time you get there they are miles away. Discordance is god tier, or it works and tells you where 2 or more survivors are or doesn't tell you anything and you still get to know that they are split. 
---
Trying to understand why you said " even Myers" Myers is dogshit, he's only good at snowball but so it is trapper/hag.
---
Not telling you to not use such perks, but if you use them with 90% of the killers. You won't improve. 
---
I love m1 killers. My main is trapper,bubba  and wraith. And I've never used such perks and I can assure you that I 4k 95% of my games..
---
Ruin BBQ sf and enduring are only good for chases but even with that , good survivors can make you lose time.
---
 Pressure/rotation is what make you a good killer. There's maps that survivors don't even need to loop, just camp pallets and drop them and by the time that all pallets are down, you lost the game.
---
i should‚Äôve mentioned i was playing without sound and i didn‚Äôt know everyone else disconnected
---
She crouches faster now
---
Yes, but it‚Äôs the same as Ghostface. The character and the costume are separate licenses. The company that owns the Ghost Face Mask also owns the Scary Movie Mask, as well as the metal mask and devil face mask. It is entirely possible.
---
This is so unrealistic, what Dwight uses a flashlight and doesn‚Äôt hide in a locker.

Must not have played for awhile...

Good job missing point.

I said hes bad at ranking up, but 3rd most effective at getting 4k/3k+hatch
---
Ah, yeah, fair enough lol
---
Hello
---
This is perfect, love it lol
---
That doesn‚Äôt sound fun
---
i try to help other people out that‚Äôs why i main david lol
---
Doctor is better than Plague because of his ability to shutdown loops and tracking. Myers is between A and B tier. He‚Äôs strong in chases with T3 and can get easier first hits with a smaller terror radius, but he has zero map pressure. Without good map pressure he doesn‚Äôt deserve A tier.
---
No killer at red ranks can afford to waste a perk slot for noed lmao....
---
4 kills or 3 kills with hatch you mean
---
Lol!  This has to be bait man.  Unless you're potato ranks and it sure as shit sounds like you are with your assessment of how "strong" facecamping is that playstyle will lose you the vast majority of your games.  Red rank survivors will gen rush you mercilessly and even if your potato self actually meets 4 equally potato opponents you will depip from a facecamping 4K.  You lose either way even if they fall for it while also getting terrible bloodpoints.  This feels like it was written by a 3 week played at Yellows.  That it it's just bad bait.
---
4 kills is 4 kills, salty kid
---
-said the green rank
---
Fits right in with all the other "survivors" who failed to live up to the title
---
I disagree. The ONE OF THEM form isn't mean to be a long duration form. Like in the movie, the creature changes frequently to take advantage of humans. And if you're found out, either relocate and approach again from a sneaky angle or switch back to THE THING form to pursue a survivor.
---
Being bad at ranking up does not mean it's impossible to rank up. I've ranked up to red ranks playing only Legion after his rework and he's not considered good either.
---
The fact your best strategy could never get you to red ranks playing only Leatherface says a lot.
---
We are, it has DBD credits on his imdb page under the op's film.
---
Cool
---
You lose pips my guy, I am rank 4 and would hate to loose pips like that
---
If the dev's were to change it so it no longer works with adrenaline, would that make my idea more fair?
---
Waiting 5-10 minutes for a match is a big killer in this too.
---
It upsets me when I see people burn relics. 
---
I think it was from games launch till early 2017(?) map offerings came in most colours (rarity): brown, yellow &amp; green. 
---
In one of the blood web re-hauls brown &amp; yellow map offerings were removed as the odds they offered to getting a map were so small and they cluttered up the blood web. Any users who still had them on their webs &amp; in their inventories when the patch went live got to keep em, they‚Äôre called relics and amongst old school DBD players are worth hoarding.
---
My P3 Feng and Laurie will never burn a single one haha.
---
no what they will is 1-2 will dick off behind a rock allowing you to kill their friend
---
no matter what you're getting your first kill.   And you ran to your ruin totem so more often than not you can protect ruin and the hook.
---
even if 3 gens pop while u camp the guy, ur going to get 1 more guy hooked before gates open.  the absolute worst case scenario is a 2 kill game and it rarely happens
---
red ranks, kid.  red ranks
---
Okay. If you‚Äôre usinf Insidious, you are standing around camping one spot. That is inherently a losing strat, as you‚Äôre not putting pressure on anything or earning points.. OBVIOUS camping has the potential to put pressure by making survivors be indecisive or hover waiting for a chance to save. Insidious camping you are hoping to jump the next survivor unawares.
---
But by downing the rescuer, you‚Äôre not getting multi hooks‚Äîthe first survivor stays on n hook, the new one goes on hook to stay, and the other survivor won‚Äôt come save. 
---
Even if you somehow use Onsidios to get a 4K, you‚Äôre not getting chase points and hooking survivors multiple times. You‚Äôre not putting pressure on gens. You will not get many points, and your emblems will not go up, which means you will not pip, your rank will not go up. Similar to how you don‚Äôt rank up if you mori everyone after one hook.
---
So no. There is no ‚Äúlegitimate‚Äù use of insidious.
---
Turtle. Fish. Paint
---
Maybe add a 1/1000 unique animation where he briefly jumps as if being scared by his own reflection
---
To a point. We can only assume from the clip.  A killer can only chase one person at a time. I'm guessing he had chases last way too long. Freddy is pretty well equipped to handle survivors that spread out, but there's absolutely nothing preventing the other 3 survivors from doing gens by themselves when one is in a chase. Survivors ultimately have to acknowledge map pressure for it to be a thing, and they're really not under any obligation to do so.
---
Boosted killers do.  I played against some red rank noed gamer spirits yesterday.  As long as they don't get a swf their crutch will activate endgame.
---
Thank you for this wholesome thread
---
it would be awesome but it would be too hard to implement. SWF and all.
---
I'm not sure HOW much of an advantage it gives, but the voice comms definitely help. On the other hand, my dumb ass often makes stupid decisions when I play with my friends, mostly when they get hooked
---
W A T? Premonition is shit compared to spine chill; you only get a single notification and then it's on cool down after. Spine chill stays active at all times, no cooldown, small buff, and works on all killers no matter who they are; they just have to look in your direction. And basing if a killer found you or is already chasing you by terror radius can screw you over or save you, spine chill makes it easier to discern that.
---
Why would you use the perk acronym to refer to a phrase?
---
If you learn what survivor perks are common and most often used and how they work you can counter them as killer. Like baiting out a dead hard,  waiting to pick up someone for decisive strike,  etc
---
I did renew my psplus a few days ago, but it had been playing fine until this morning.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Edit: never mind I see what you mean
---
About time rank 20 kurvivor and im getting matched against rank 1 survivors and killers
---
Imo that's how survivors SHOULD feel (powerless alone). It's 1v4, and usually 2 or 3 people coordinating can counter insidious pretty easily if they play smart.
---
That is not a great way to discourage toxic behavior in chat. You are admitting to being a douche with that kind of talk. (Not trying to insult you, just being honest as it is douche-y)
---
The best way is to just say gg and leave or give advice. If they want to be toxic, there is no reason for you to sink to that level. Especially with all the new players from the New DLC (if you want them to stick around and have better queues).
---
I didnt lol
---
I knew they existed, but i thought they removed them from the bloodweb before the console edition came out. Apparently I was wrong.
---
I‚Äôd do clown and Plauge
---
*sees party full of claudettes wearing same clothing*
---
This going to be a looooong match.
---
A fun perk for the thing would be a totem that when active prevents gens from being worked on unless at least 2 people are working on it.
---
As long as it's Englund's Freddy, I don't care which one it's from.
---
As killer, if I see people dive bombing the hook in my face right after I picked up the another survivor.  I‚Äôm dropping that survivor.  I shouldn‚Äôt be punished for survivors playing badly.
---
That would be so fucking awesome
---
I've done things like this before. I usually only do it if I haven't been hooked yet but my teammates have. If I know my teammates need healing, I'll usually fast vault or quickly get in a locker, wait a bit and hide from the killer or actually let him chase me to stall him. Most times, I'm able to get away from him, sometimes I end on a hook.
---
H A L L E L U J A H
---
ESPECIALLY because the particular comment you replied to, I wasn't being particularly defensive or anything? I've had friends look at this and everyone agrees you just seem like you wanted to cause a problem. They didn't even know it was on my post because I didn't show my name or the post.
---
So if people who have no reason to be biased towards the original person think you sound like a dick... Chances are.... You sound like a dick.
---
you already made me feel like shit about it to the point that I deleted the post and I've been pretty fuckin upset since, considering cosplay is the only thing I'm actually proud of. So do me a favor and stop commenting. Leave me alone.
---
Honestly we need more strong killers other than the usual 2-4 we see at red ranks I‚Äôm kinda sick of after 3800 hours on both sides seeing the same BBQ and Ruin Billy‚Äôs and NOED Ruin Nurses And Iridescent head Huntress, that short time that we had Legion with the same broken addons and now we have spirit. Clown was a close contender for top tier but mobility and how fast you can properly apply map pressure or down someone is a huge factor he was lacking in. I want more top tier killers as a survivor as a killer I‚Äôve never cared too much about tiers as long as they aren‚Äôt Legion bad or OG Freddy and Wraith bad because a good killer is gonna either win or barely lose in most situations outside SWF and if I want to be a sweaty then at least I don‚Äôt have to force survivors to keep facing Hillbilly on console with BBQ and Ruin and Enduring and all that fun jazz over and over again. Spirit isn‚Äôt broken her addons just need adjustments. I think her training wheels whakazashi mini windstorm effect is insanely strong as well as her faster charge time and speed and recovery addons. And her amulet is just her carburetors tuning guide basically. But those aren‚Äôt enough to make her impossible to beat if you know her counters like dropping pallets early or walking instead of running unless they‚Äôre on the other side of a pallet and even then only briefly to get away from her collision check, running iron will, sprint burst, Dead hard, balanced, quick and quiet, spine chill, urban, poised all make her significantly easier. Using tall grass to your advantage to fake direction and all I‚Äôve used and seen while playing.
---
You meant some INCREDIBILIS new material..!
---
(sorry, I saw your username: couldn't resist!!)
---
Nurse has trouble there too, some buildings are empty inside so they count as solid objects, she can't exactly blink through all of it unless she has range add ons. 
---
It's also somewhat easier to hide against her there, especially on those houses with tiny basement loop.
---
I didn't miss the point. You said Bubba is one of the most effective killers against survivors, I posted a bit of proof otherwise and I'm sure many people will have similar experiences. Insidious Bubba only works against either bad/inexperienced survivors or survivors that are way too cocky. Maybe you didn't read my post well, but I certainly didn't miss your point.
---
If you're going for perks: Clown and Pig
---
If you're going for killer power: Plague and Doc
---
I forgot deliverance. But yeah. Distortion is okay at best. I'm loving fixated but probably not long term. But that's what I mean. Since Kate, almost a survivor perks are just mediocre.
---
No, everyone hates being camped, and the community sees it as shitty. You may find it fun and get some degree of reward from it, but you need to accept that survivor‚Äôs hate it.
---
Thank you memerater! Very cool!
---
Came to say this, fun world owns the molds for the ‚Äúparody‚Äù mask the ‚Äústoned‚Äù mask and the ‚Äúhappy‚Äù mask they are the ones who also own the molds for the classic ghostface variations, I‚Äôd honestly take any of the parody masks beside the stoned/tongue one.
---
He doesn't have a decent counter-argument, so he uses insults instead, thinking it's equivalent.
---
Why is his head turned sideways? Reflections don't work like that ;-)
---
Awesome idea tho. Would be insanely cool to see.
---
Not exactly. I find the Thing would function sort of like this:
---
1. Find survivor/group of survivors while disguised in ONE OF THEM.
---
2. IF THEY KNOW YOU'RE THE KILLER, swap to THE THING form and hunt down one of them. Hitting a survivor would allow you to take their form when transforming to ONE OF THEM. This also reverts gameplay to the traditional chase the players already know.
---
3. IF THEY DON'T KNOW YOU'RE THE KILLER, either get closer to them by "helping" with the gen or if one of them is hurt offer to heal them. You have a unique Infection bar while healing that, if completed, places them in the exposed status. Either way, the deception allows you to get close enough to transform and get a hit or down in.
---
Put a post it note over the chat
---
Your friends.
---
Can't you just push the little down arrow or whatever and it'll minimize the chat so you don't have to see it and it'll stay that way till you press the button again?
---
He could shoot a survivor in the middle of fifth avenue and not lose any followers... I mean, entity progression.
---
False. Can get grabbed while healthy, too.
---
Clown and Pig are what I thought would be the best. Are they fun to play?
---
The reboot was good and doesn‚Äôt undermine anything, you have 6+ movies with old Freddy stop complaining because someone remade a movie.
---
Pretty sure it's a doctored image
---
no u need to be banned LOL
---
No, there's a finite amount you can stalk each survivor which is set at the beginning of the match. Once you've fully drained them, they're out for good.
---
No you can only obtain a set amount of stalk juice per survivor within a match. Michael can only go into tier three a certain amount of times per match.
---
~explosion noise~
---
I feel personally attacked.
---
Colonel I‚Äôm trying to sneak past the border patrol but I‚Äôm too dummy thicc and the clap of my asscheeks keeps alerting ICE.
---
&gt;Because there's one right there
---
Bad excuse. Find another one. They aren't hard (outside of freaking Hawkins and sometimes Lery's).
---
&gt;Because a perk
---
Yes, obviously if you have a perk that makes doubling up on a gen better you should use it. I'd argue it's not worth risking the killer having that perk to see gens with multiple survivors on it though. 
---
&gt;Because a daily
---
Yes, dailies often force players to play suboptimally. 
---
There are very few good reasons to double up on gens.
---
Do you have any system updates? Try opening another game that uses online only and see if a similar message pops up
---
*laughs in console*
---
I'd personally go for Clown and Plague, but then again since Pig is licensed you could buy her and earn whoever else you want in game?
---
wow that helps alot thank you
---
honestly i enjoy higher ranks, i keep getting camped in lower ranks and my teammates love to farm/completely ignore me while on hook.
---
thanks that helps alot
---
He already looks quite sad in the loadout to begin with, flicking his little lips nervously (?) and everything...
---
:p
---
just asking a question is all.
---
That was the worst glove though, honestly they picked the best looking Freddy and glove already so I‚Äôm happy.
---
It's really dependent on what you're willing to do. Ghostface has a steep learning curve and you've got to be really good at building stalk in chases at higher ranks. He's incredible if you get him down, but it's very difficult to learn how to do properly. Meyers is a lot easier to learn but he's generally always a mid-tier killer and a ton of practice won't really change that. If you're looking to just have casual fun thigh, Meyers is really good at scaring the piss out of survivors
---
They are both really fun to play.
---
Aight ya boi redactedvirus here with some hot and spicy tips. I'm a legion main and I have found that franks mixtape is garbo, don't use it. Honestly want success with legion? Be a basic bitch. Get enduring, spirit fury, nurses calling, then make a decision between BBQ and Chili or Hex Ruin. I personally run BBQ. The tactic that you described is usually the best bet to getting easy downs. Run duration addons and feral frenzy stun reduction addons for maximum efficiency.
---
Wanna be a true Legion player (asshole)? Run button, hit as many survivors as possible, and then follow the last one for a while if they are dumb they will throw down every pallet and you can get you spirit fury up in a matter of seconds by vaulting. Unfrenzy, hope they run to a pallet they stab those bastards in the back. 
---
Once you down a survivor use you bbq to see if anyone is healing far away. If they are zoom over there and then use nurses calling to zero in on their position. If they are "smart" they wont heal which means instant down for you. 
---
All a good tactic is to find a survivor whos injured and pallet happy. Run them down with frenzy but keep your distance they should throw down pallets. Hit em when feral frenzy is close to be done and then keep following them. You should be able to clear a good amount of the pallets by doing this. 
---
Have any questions feel free to ask. Happy hunting brother.
---
You can generally tell which killers might not want to be there because there is evidence of them being touched by the entity in ways. Sorry to say i cant think of any off the top of my head but i read that somewhere
---
Actually thought of one. Billy. His eyes are glowy, which is a sign of having been touched by the entity. All we know of billy is that he broke out and murderer his parents and farm animals, all we really know is that the entity took him soon after that so maybe he wasnt planning on doing the whole kill everything in existence
---
Stop you broke the law, pay your fine or die
---
there is no need for more emotes. killers are alone so they don't need communication and survivors only use it to bm or exploit.
---
for the category idea. you can see the points each time you get more points in the category so it's technically there but yeah seeing them all the time would be cool and I think wouldn't change anything gameplay wise. removing categories sounds kinda lame idk.
---
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just bad at playing fair‚Äù you just ruined your whole argument. If a killer NEEDS to play unfair to win, it‚Äôs a bad killer.  There‚Äôs literally nothing impressive or effective about making people DC or waiting for their friends to try and save them bc they all want to have fun. You‚Äôre trying to justify playing like a douchebag by calling it ‚Äúeffective‚Äù and no ones buying that. Have fun trying to win at red ranks vs highly skilled teams if they ever do something about camping and you have to, idk, play like a normal, skilled player. 
---
Oh, and stop calling people kid like you‚Äôre smarter than everyone. Tool.
---
if you never get caught you can never be camped ;)
---
Or old image
---
they made the original fucked up freddy's backstory, copied scenes from the original and made them worse, like it was literally just bad and represents nothing people like about the series so it had no reason to exist
---
His name is Ghost too!
---

---
Most likely following him after Trump put DBD in that highlight reel of violent video games when he first got into office. ( https://youtu.be/o36-byW6ZTo )
---
Haddonfield is a great trapper map. Permanently disabled loops? Yes please
---
and maybe he'll paint them later.
---
*Cough, cough* Nurse *Cough*
---
Doug Ford is pro Trump.
---
i can loop fairly well, but after all the pallets are down because of my teammates i'm just fucked.
---
* Rent Free - After looking at him for 5 seconds without interruption, every (90/60/30) seconds, The God-Emperor's chase music will play for a random survivor regardless of their distance.
---
* Covfefe - Survivor hit by the killer become confused for the next (40/60/80) seconds, shrinking the space of their skillchecks by 50%.
---
* Because You'd Be In Jail - Survivors inside of a locker the killer hits with an attack are locked inside, unable to leave for (10/20/30) seconds.
---
Power: Deportation
---
As he puts opponents into the dying state, the God-Emperor builds Justice stacks, up to a maximum of 9. At any time, the God-Emperor can spend 5 stacks to Deport a downed survivor. Deportation counts as a kill, as the God-Emperor expels the survivor from his plane, sealing them behind a horrific wailing wall.
---
Have you heard Jeff? He enjoys being put on the hook.
---
I ACTSULLT YELPED
---
Well, he walks right into women's changing rooms, grabs them by their genitals, and doesn't want Black people on his property, so there's that.

Brothel_Cop
---
Rank is pointless people dont actually care anymore, if rank meant something like you get bonus rewards as the end of each reset then maybe people would care. But it's not that competitive. It's definitely an advantage but its similar to 4 good solo queue survivors, its not that hard to know when someone is being chased.
---
8/10
---
Well, first of all, BBQ &amp; Chili is paywalled, as are many other good perks, some of which are meta.
---
Secondly, I didn't, but it's still pay to PLAY when everyone has ALREADY paid to play. Expansion Packs for single player games worked back in the day, but this is an online experience that's at least presenting itself as competitive, and unlike expansion packs, the paywalled content is part of the PRIMARY gameplay, not an alternative mode or arc.
---
&gt;I do, however, put away my toolbox/any other items whenever I see all the other survivors with toolboxes because the killer tends to either bring franklins or moris to counter, lmao. I've even had a killer say postgame that they changed to spirit last minute specifically because we all had toolboxes.
---
my galaxy brain play is to put on an item if i see 2 or 3 other items in the game then take it off at the last second to try to bait franklins
---
granted I'm tabbed out 90% of the time so I rarely get to do this lmao
---
It would fuck up a tv screen too, dude. This doesn‚Äôt help either group. I too am console boi.
---
I usually go after the farmers, but there was this 1 time...
---
I was a doctor and brought an ebony mori (I was planning to use it on survivors who were on their last hook or when survivors are popping out the gens like crazy) additionally I had dying light, not to tunnel the obsession, but because I really didn't have anything decent.
---
Whether you believe me or not, here is what happened: I started by patrolling the gens. Someone got into tier I after only a few seconds. It was a claudette, my obsession. After a short chase, I downed and hooked them, while I was hooking them, I heard someone running up bebined me, so I turned around, didn't see anyone and not even 3 seconds after the claudette got hooked, she already got unhooked.
---
I swung, and hit the claudette, she went down.
---
I was a little pissed at the farmer, they did this without borrowed time, this also wasn't the low ranks. I decided to teach him a lesson he wouldn't soon forget: I showed him where farming got him by using my mori on the just unhooked claudette.
---
Fastest 4 man DC of my life.
---
I felt bad for the claudette and the other players probably also didn't deserve this, but I'm sure the farmer wouldn't soon forget
---
From the killers perspective it makes hardly any difference.
---
The killer can‚Äôt collect the items.
---
Good luck, I hope they can fix it for you
---
I actually knew about this before. (because of paulie esther)  
---
But ''My way'' of doing it is a public game glitch and seems to be out of the table! :)
---
Why does every thread related to him have to turn into an orange man bad thread??
---
As a betting man, I'm inclined to believe it's just gonna get even more fucked up rather than fixed.   Matchmaking has always been one of the worst features of this game.
---
I've had this game for years. Rank means nothing. So pips and points mean nothing to me. I play for fun.
---
How do you know then didn‚Äôt get looped by the players of he was afk? Also how do u know he‚Äôs salty about it.

Respect for admitting that someone had a good criticism of your point. Not many people online do that.
---
No, not really. I would say they shouldn't feel powerful (SWF being flashlight bullies), but they shouldn't be powerless. Lorewise, yeah, that's the point, but it's at the end of the day it is a game. Survivors should have the power to try and survive, and insidious can be used to completely remove that. Yes, if they work together they can counteract it, because it's really not a good perk, that really damages both sides of the game.
---
Yes, this is what everyone is saying. These developers better give more love to him.

I prefer the "Trader Bubba". Give item to Bubba and you are allowed to touch chest

Rank means your skill level there is a huge difference because at rank 1 other random rank 1s should be experienced and good it‚Äôs especially really difficult to rank up now so 2 DC‚Äôs is annoying
---
well surge is questionable...
---
It came out years ago and this is not a very significant part of the show.
---
 does BHVR know about this yet? connection issues on PS4? it says "Connecting..." at bottom right when looking for match as survivor, but never goes anywhere, to the point that 20mins will pass and PS4 will enter power-saving mode according to my settings, and there's no way to cancel it, not with O(Back) or Triangle(Unready), so the only way to escape it is to close and reopen the game. it's the new worst connection issue the game ever had, because it's the first one that requires a game restart
---
It's the name I use to get to Hirame lol
---
I main solo survivor and I can tell you its a HUGE advantage. I've got like 1200 hours in the game playing mostly solo and occasionally killer and I noticed the diference to be inmense when some people invited me over to play SWF. Once a hex totem was found it was as good as dead, coordinated unhooks where a breeze, there was never a moment someone wasn't on a gen at all times, we always knew what killer it was, where it was and what it was doing. We even knew what perks the killer was running if someone happened to die early. I haven't seen killers DC and dodge so much, being a solo player this was pretty rare and eye opening for me. Information is extremely important and so is coordination, honestly those games weren't fair.
---
Should there be separate ranks? No way. Not ever.
---
Should killers know if they are against solos or SWF? Im gonna say yes, they'll need any help they can get. Little things like knowing if some random survivor found your Ruin would he be able to tell a friend, is important.
---
The Killer game definitely requires a lot of dishing out and receiving. Just don‚Äôt let toxicity get to you.
---
you can have a participation ribbon for trying
---
The Plague and The Doctor are the most fun out of the four
---
Thanks lol
---
Okay, so sometimes it's hard to find another one, the Killer may not always run a Legion teachable (or even own Legion), and dailies exist.
---
So there are reasons. That's what you asked for.
---
perfect game, no bugs at all ofc
---
I hate this. Thank you UwU
---
I'm just asking if anyone is experiencing problems with it, my friend can't join, if he can he doesn't appear for me, and if we actually get together, it says "host unreachable" and gets us stuck in the menu's forcing a soft reset
---
Completing that gen and escaping gives the new map based achievement, all alone I thinks called. They likely were fighting over it
---
Yeah, it's fairly unique by comparison, so it's a nice way to get exactly what you want instead of the other Hirame that probably exist.
---
What do you mean you were his editor? I'm actually really interested to have that answered, because logically other content creators heavily edit their videos while Tru3 basically just clips games from his streams, without editing (as far as I can tell) so obviously they'll show you highlights, their best footage, without giving you a real idea of their skill level or typical gameplay: It's not representative of their average gameplay, and thus it wouldn't make sense to compare average gameplay to their highlights. Content creators often play several games to get their perfect footage: No DCs, 4k, etc... If Tru3 only uploaded games where he as flawless, would you think differently of him? Because he does have games like that. It's not fair to cherry pick games one way or the other though when judging someone's overall skill level.
---
And like, sure, he's "cool" I guess, but how much does that have to do with his skill level? If you admit it takes skill to get to rank 1, you have to retract your opinion that he's not good at the game, especially when he gets to Rank 1 Consistently while playing every role and every killer. Rational people change their mind when it contradicts reality, you know?
---
Got the same Problem on ps4 mate... Hopefully they will fix it soon
---
If someone decides not to watch 8 episodes of a show that came out 2 years ago, can they really be mad?
---
if u play a certain killer to camp then why play it at all it's boring for both sides honestly unless you're the kind if person to get excited being a toxic killer :/
---
Yes, it can stack with prove thyself.
---
I'll go one by one in what I believe:
---
Ghostface: He probably gets a bit bored, especially considering that he can't really make his kills into public spectacle anymore, but the hunt is just as exciting to him so he's probably generally chill, maybe gets a bit lackluster sometimes. 
---
Clown: The guy is pretty crazy but all that's important to him in his kills is the ability to take a trophy. If allowed to kill by his own hand by the Entity enough, he'd probably also be pretty cool with it all.
---
Nurse: Definitely tortured. The ability she was given has been stated to be excruciating for her, likely to keep her line, and while she was definitely insane she also killed those patients because she believed it was helping them, so being forced to kill for cruelty would not be something she'd do willingly. 
---
Hillbilly: I imagine he's barely intelligent. All the Entity really has to do is point him toward some humans and he's off. There's no real mutually beneficial relationship, Billy likely doesn't even understand where he is or what's going on.
---
Trapper: Evan did what he did out of respect for the authority of his father, so it would be dependent on his respect for the Entity. Unfortunately there's not a ton about him as a person so not much else can be said. 
---
Wraith: Again, definitely tortured. He killed Azarov out of anger for what he'd been made to do but once that anger wore off it would take a lot for him to willingly kill. 
---
Freddy: Unfortunately I can't say much about him because I've never seen the movies, but from what I know it's very possible he'd be there willingly but it would be more begrudged. 
---
Pig: While I highly doubt she'd be happy about accepting the Entity's strict control judging by the way she was with Jigsaw, she's also very intelligent and likely understands what's waiting for her if she doesn't play along so she probably avoided the torture but only barely. 
---
Plague: She's a bit more unique, as she thinks the Entity is her god and that the trials are her being chosen by the Entity as its chosen so I have no doubt she's willing. 
---
Meyers: Kinda like Billy I suspect, in that he doesn't really care if he's in the real world hunting around or if he's in the Entity's realm because he doesn't care to differentiate. All he exists for is the kill so given that chance he doesn't need to pay attention or care. 
---
Doctor: This is a difficult one to figure out. Everything he did was in the pursuit of science rather than cruelty for cruelty's sake. While he's intelligent he's also completely off the deep end. I'd call it inconclusive but anyone can feel free to correct me. 
---
Hag: I'd lean toward the torture but it's another tough one. Before being cannibalized she would definitely have been tortured but that experience no doubt broke her thoroughly and it's very possible she's just like Billy at this point, uncaring about what's happening around her and just looking for a tasty snack. 
---
Spirit: The most tortured of all of them. She was literally just a schoolgirl when her dad went batshit and cut her up. The fact that the Entity hasn't bothered to patch her up or pull out the glass means she's probably still in a lot of pain as some sort of punishment for not wanting to be a murderer for all eternity. 
---
Leatherface: Maybe like Billy, his story makes it sound like he seriously lacks any real intelligence so if he were sufficiently manipulated by the Entity it's possible he thinks he's still defending his family. 
---
Huntress: She's kinda off the deep end too and no doubt is in this willingly. The way she killed everyone that came near pretty much seals the idea, she lives for the hunt and being given a chance to do it for the rest of her life would be considered a gift. While she does butt heads with the Entity, she does her job and they get along well enough. 
---
Legion: Everyone but Susie would end up going along with it, they might be edgy rebels but they know when they're up against something unbeatable. Susie though is definitely not on board and would have to be brought in line. 
---
Demogorgon: Totally animalistic, there's no real reason to try and make it loyal. Just throw it into a trial and let it eat shit up.
---
This is just my reading of the characters though. Feel free to correct me on anything here.
---
U didn't saw totem that spawn literally in the middle of nowhere. It spawns on open field without trees.
---
You got it with PS+, last August, right?
---
Did you let PS+ expire before renewing it?
---
Thanks for genuinely making me laugh.
---
How does it?
---
Probably because it'd be literally worthless against SWF groups, and *many* people play this game with their friends.  
---
Nobody would play it unless they're memeing around, which would only really take away from the experience as a whole.  
---
It's an awful idea, not to mention it's an all too common idea. This sub sees at least one of these "The killer can disguise as the survivors!" concepts every month.
---
The doctor probably loves to test out his shock therapy on the survivors. Trapper obviously wants to do the job right. Ghostface probably does get bored. Clown gets all of his fingers. The Legion probably enjoys the rush and all that
---
Never realized how much Reddit hates emojis like wtf lmfaoooooooooo
---
Where‚Äôs the clip?
---
Mostly to showcase the distance you can get with the pounce. I didn't kill anyone this match because I was too busy trying to see how far I could pounce at height.
---
Ey you gotta know when you're wrong sometimes.
---
Only thing you will get on high rank its longer queue time
---
I‚Äôm so confused, I uploaded it as a video and it posted as an image
---
It is a huge advantage when used properly.... to the point you are only getting 1 kill if you are lucky. It will result in a 3k or 4k when used by people screwing around or self sabotaging. (using bond to deliver killer, going for yolo saves)
---
It does rely on your own individual skill to a degree.  No amount of voice coms is going to help if you last 5 seconds in a chase.
---
Just gotta play man. You'll either get killed back down the rank ladder, or be tempered in the battles with stronger killers.
---
Console doesn‚Äôt have a PTB so you can say our version is the PTB till they patch it. (I know I‚Äôm probably 100% incorrect based on my little to no knowledge on how they do things) but really that‚Äôs what it feels like.
---
If they had casual queues, I would only play those. Ranks are just made of hatred and primal desire to be superior to others and fuck that we already have capitalism for it.
---
Same happened to me, a legion sweated after 2 teamates DC, he morried the other guy then went afk for like 2 minutes probably clipping it.
---
[Clear Kenobi Voice]: ‚ÄúHello there‚Äù
---
I just bought the game and decided to start playing killer this weekend and... no. No more killer games until this is fixed. Ending the game with no points and realizing they are rank 4, 6, 8 and 11 when I'm just 20, besides the fact that 3 or 4 of them were together? Really? I have played many online games, and I have seen many incompetent teams of devs everywhere, but damn!!!!! You develop a 4 versus 1 game, where the 4 men have thousands of hours of advantage in that game! LOL it is a fiasco.
---
Dude couldn't spell Forrest's name right.
---
It's not betting if the result is predictable ;)
---
I think Mike Meyers has a perk that allows you to grab vaulting survivors who arent injured. I swore he did it to me once.
---
Harness the energy of sun spots, obviously.
---
Exactly, and I was like, ok I'll play killer.. but that takes like an hour to find a match, it so broken. I'm in rank 8 at the moment (killer) and found a rank 20, 11, 7 and 1 all in the same lobby! What?!
---
Iron Will is one of the best perks in game. It's equally good for stealth virgins and for chase-running Chads. So you never go wrong with this perk in any build.
---
Honestly really looking forward to this, I‚Äôd love a good book about my favourite game!
---
Have you ever run head on, quick &amp; quiet and dance with me together? It's freaking evil lol. Far from meta, but hilarious and often makes them DC since they have no idea what happened.
---
It isn‚Äôt always my fault either when I don‚Äôt escape. Sometimes I can ‚Äúescape‚Äù and still die. This is the bug at where you can‚Äôt heal, you can‚Äôt wiggle, you can‚Äôt do shit. You stay glitched the entire game and walk straight through the gates and still die because the devs won‚Äôt fix their game lmao
---
That hotfix is coming soon.
---
i dont think the Russians can stop a literal god from stealing there play thing.
---
I say this bc in the trailer the way it crawls around the corner is exactly how it does when it enters the cage in s3
---
My teammate survived and also killer need to learn when to give up on a chase I aint just gonna let them kill me lol
---
Yeah, I'm just salty that I got destroyed by red ranks on PS4 who were all in Party chat and basically messaged me after the game throwing insults etc.
---
Me too. This map and lerys are hilarious with GF. Id like to see some of the survivor reactions when I play it lol. Happy cake day!
---
It might not be good but made with love it is
---
Can they, though? Remember this is Pedo Freddo, not the real deal.
---
ELI just started playing at the anniversary?
---
&gt;It's an awful idea
---
Seems like you should share a reason why it is awful other than it's a common idea and that the sub sees a concept like this every month. Something isn't awful because you say it is. Back up your claim with a reason and I'll gladly respond.
---
This is also a very rough draft of a concept that is based mostly on the lore of the movie The Thing which will probably never see the light of day #deadbydaylightpuns
---
8 seconds.
---
And that isnt the killers fault
---
????????????????
---
Just Played as a Rank 3 killer against all 3 purple and a 18, Lost tho, Joker fuckin sucks.
---
So if someone is self caring does it add 16 or still only 8?
---
Michael just seeing a comrade in not doing what the Entity wants.
---
Did you think that toxicity went equally both ways in this game?
---
Without the one perk, Quick and Quiet, if a survivor does any rushed action, regardless of your TR, you will get a notification.
---
But in times like that, the killer shouldn‚Äôt be credited with it. Which I said in one of the million comments here somewhere lmao I‚Äôm not really bothered by this anymore, the post was created out of frustration in the first place lol
---
Just blonde boyz doin what blonde boyz do
---
u cant imagine how blind survivors can be. i saw survivors working on a gen and the ruin is literally behind the corner.. :D
---
It wasn‚Äôt a suggestion, guy. If it was I would‚Äôve set the flair as suggestion LMAO I don‚Äôt know what particular killers are like, oh no, now I can‚Äôt rant OH NO. I haven‚Äôt played killer in like 3 weeks. Get over yourself
---
damn thats sick. wish killers had pre-sicko mode skins
---
His footsteps are silly. But it matches the fucking STOMPS of the demogorgon.
---
What's the strategy for countering The Pig? Most people talk about how bad she is, but my friends and I are all fairly new to the game and she's been wrecking us. Also does luck play a factor in the jigsaw machines laughing at you or are a set number supposed to work during each trial?
---
Im 99% confident this is bait lol from the Karma on his account to the date it was made lol.
---
Banned? Whyever for?
---
K. Thanks for the heads up.
---
uwur wewcome
---
Pretty sure this is called getting the game over with so both sides can play another round. Only a loser farms.
---
Oh that's good then lol
---
impossible. we squashed that concept millennia ago. there is no enjoyment in life other than shoving ur rank one achievement in everyone‚Äôs face on ur steam profile.
---
One day killers will realise that chasing survivors and protecting gens is the way they're actually supposed to play. Just like a survivor's job isnt just to escape, but to be chased and also help their teammates.
---
Until then, we'll have these threads.
---
100% lust
---
"Top 10 Rank 1 Plays".
---
Something about certain meme formats being overused etc.
---
idk, I thought this was one of them(formats) because it was being posted almost hourly at the time of the announcement.
---
they aren't the only ones who thought dedicated servers would be live at this point
---
I thought it was already strongly implied he was abusing kids in the Englund movies.
---
and now they'll uninstall and/or become omega nurse gg
---
Same here
---
That‚Äôd be amazing
---
Wait do you mean queuetimes or the 'rank 1 vs rank 20' matches?
---
I can't wait for the Demogorgon one. (maybe a tar bottle but named "stomach acid" bc of vore)
---
Most of the songs are called something like "The Shape Stalks" or whatever
---
For me this is the best tier list
---
LOL. Perfect :D
---
That's literally what the fuck I do when both the killer and the other survivors in a SWF are being toxic dickheads.
---
Me: "Come on, I wasn't being a dick, I was just trying to get someone off the hook."
---
Killer: "You salty swf should've been doing gens."
---
Literally was the only one doing gens and survivors would regularly bring the killer over and loop them around me doing the gen. Got 1 and half a gen done before having to go unhook the idiots that the killer was camping.
---
franklins is a quick fix to those items
---
Oh.. Ok then.
---
Why is this comment getting downvoted? tf
---
You sucky sucky me cocky cocky
---
sauce?
---
Flairs arent always used accurately, asshole
---
I have over 400 hours in this game as killer and I can't remember an aim assist ever existing at all. Is this really a thing? Why didn't I ever feel it before?
---
Apparently, me typing in coherent sentences makes me illiterate. Thanks for the regressive English lesson. Considering you think regurgitating your **statement** (It's not a reason, actually) in larger font is a justified answer, I'll give an actual reason based on someone else saying SWF counters it.
---
If they're SWF, from a Killer standpoint I'm a chameleon Wraith. Even if I never get to adequately use my Infection ability or regress a gen through "fixing" it in ONE OF THEM form, I can approach with 0 terror radius and transform to attack once I'm close enough.
---
In case you were unaware, saying something, "is worthless" isn't a reason; it's a statement. Saying, "It's literally worthless **because players would call out that the Thing is coming to their gen**," is a statement **followed by reasoning**.
---
So I actually pulled one of these off for the first time the other day. Turns out killers REALLY do not like when you do the head on save... I got to be Billy‚Äôs pi√±ata for the rest of my brief time in that match, was a depip too. 
---
I still laughed though. Headon is a fun perk.
---
Do we know the the palletgorgon will be added in?
---
Rip the free week end folks
---
This is shockingly accurate, I just got rekt by a 4-man SWF from rank 2 and I want to die
---
I'm rank 12
---
How am I an asshole? Lmao I think I know what I‚Äôm doing when I make a post, guy. Again, get over yourself. Just another waste of a comment you‚Äôre making
---
The only killer that makes me dc üòç
---
That's the reason why I don't buy any cosmetic .. they don't deserve my money for such messi shit
---
Oof brother, i havent played in a while and de-ranked to rank 17 and i got put in a match with a rank 10 killer, also my teammates where also rank 10 but they were trash. They should fix the ranking sistem. (again)
---
Easy way to not die with jigsaw traps is to not do gens as those start the traps, this isn‚Äôt the best idea tho. Whenever a trap is placed on your head, a random jigsaw box is selected and only that box will unlock the trap. She is a stealth based killer so running detection perks is useful AF, but if you‚Äôre new, don‚Äôt run object of obsession, run spine chill
---
Besides Matchmaking, have you guys been having really buggy and slow games after a couple matches? Also scratch marks just randomly disappearing? It‚Äôs really infuriating.
---
What im saying is that this doesnt happen nearly as often as it does as a killer. Im not denying that there are toxic killers. And I dont have respect towards a killer that chases after the person who just got unhooked in most cases.
---
Honestly? Like that's cool if it is but I just though the textures were fucked.
---
I think someone said it's something called Hirame.
---
Is there some sort of mechanic in the game that causes skill checks when the killer begins a chase with someone on a generator? Whether I‚Äôm playing survivor or killer, the second the chase music starts and someone is on a gen, a skill check pops up right as they run off and the gen blows. I‚Äôd estimate this to happen about 80% of the time. Surely it can‚Äôt be a coincidence can it?
---
How are you an asshole? Are you reading what you‚Äôre typing out? You need to get over yourself you waste of brain cells
---
In a game where the killer hooks each one of the survivors 2 times and then starts to kill them and survivors do not dedicate themselves to do the gens as quick as possible both sides can have fun . I‚Äôve played these kind of games both as killer and survivor but it only %5 of the time happens because survivors just hard sit on the gens when they dont trust the killer to not tunnel and camp. Thats when the game gets dirty
---
I'm assuming it's Enduring + Spirit's Fury.
---
Did you do it after or before you deleted the game?
---
me when i have a good item i wanna keep and the killer has Franklins
---
LMAO I haven‚Äôt even said anything rude to besides ‚Äúget over yourself‚Äù. Quit whining when you‚Äôve done nothing but be a bitch this entire thread
---
You say that like it's a bad thing
---
Make sure you pay extra close attention to your surroundings, since you don't have a heartbeat to go off of.
---
As for the boxes, if you know one has already been successfully used (for your own trap or someone else's) it won't be the right one in the future.  Each box only once.  So don't waste time trying to reuse.
---
Perks chirp every time u get hit the killer goes to jail
---
it isn't so much about whether or not you should cleanse but which matches you should do it in. 
---
you have to follow the synergy of your team because you all collectively choose her power and the effectiveness of it. if one person cleanses, the rest of you should all cleanse asap to avoid getting oneshot with little effort and the match is on rails from there. 
---
adiris' strength lies in the panic her power causes and how it ripples and cripples the survivors, she's a walking catch 22
---
anyone who complains about their teammates against plague should have known better, she's not more powerful in either form unless you're all master loopers
---
It was rhetorical. Obviously there are exceptions to rules.
---
Did it play an 8 bit tune when he was close?
---
You did it, you crazy son of a bitch you did it!
---
It‚Äôs just coincidence, skill checks appear at the worst time, there are perks that make skill checks harder and more common which I believe is a trapper perk
---
I only ever use it as a sort of backup plan
---
I love playing the plague. Shes got fun mechanics and perks
---
It might be a meme, but I had a Steve on a hook the other day and burned so much time looking for the injured female survivor I knew had to be nearby.
---
Given the past 3 years of history with BHVR and their fixes, that doesn't sound harsh at all. Just sounds like being a realist. I'm not celebrating either until I see it actually fixes MM and doesn't break some seemingly unrelated mechanic elsewhere. 
---
I'm also kinda shocked they've had such optimistic timelines for dedi implementation given BHVR's prior statements (from before the decision to add dedis) about how difficult they would be to implement.
---
Edit: entire 2nd paragraph because I'm high on cold meds and it was a bit hard to follow my meaning.
---
That's fucking gold holy shit
---
Good question! I don't regard the Thing as a "stealth" Killer so much as a "chameleon" Killer. In the Thing's case, it's more about getting the players to perhaps trust you and let you get close to them before you throw off your camouflage and strike. Stealth killers are much more of a "SURPRISE!" Killer, the Thing is, "How you doing, fellow humans? Boy, I sure don't like eating people. Isn't that the wors--FLESH SANDWICH!!!" Killer.
---
Nah fam, the Game is a great survivor map. Tons of safe pallets and it‚Äôs really good for people running balanced landing
---
Watch some good killer players, tr3etalent is solid. Good killer play requires a lot of predictions and baiting, focus on keeping pressure and control over the match and keep the survivors on their toes. That's why the best killers are killers that have strong map prescence and/or can just end chases fast (spirit, billy, and nurse embody both of these traits.) Survivors above purple rank are generally easy to control
---
&gt; it's still pay to PLAY when everyone has ALREADY paid to play

Didn't know we need to pay to play DbD. Don't want new characters? Play with old ones. You even get maps for free.

Only through the eyes of its community. DbD is not a competitive game. And again, if you want to compete, you don't need a single paid DLC. Nurse, Whispers, Deerstalker, Nurse's Calling, Shadowborn - welcome to red ranks

Just wrote a thread as someone who tried the game for the first time and was jaded by the high level players with top notch perks but it was locked and linked here. Here's the comment I was writing at the time.
---
Well, I'm also a league of legends player and I can say that if I had never played LoL and I tried now, I probably would quit within 2 days as everyone even at low levels is a smurf.
---
I'm saying that as a new player, *especially* on a free weekend and **double especially** in a game with quantifiable and meaningful character progression that can only be obtained by playing the game a lot, matchmaking should be heavily focused on putting together players with similar resources available to them, at the very least.
---
by clicking the control key?
---
Dedicated servers are testament to the absolute failure of the management and likely the dev team themselves.   Using it as one of the big promotional items during an announcement over 8 months ago, and still having to delay implementation shows a distinct lack of prioritization.  It reeks of a company who likely put one guy on the server conversion during his down time because it wasn't directly a profit generating project, while assigning whole teams to new dlc content, cosmetics, and the abomination of a battle pass.   There are very few reasons an adequately supplied team couldn't have pulled this off in the timeframe given.  But communities are unwilling to hold gaming companies to the same standards as other industries.
---
The game is intended is 4 survivors not 2
---
Nothing really wrong with the trap. He could have just waited knowing he would either catch up if she tried another loop or downed her after she threw the pallet and tried to vault.
---
STOP RIGHT THERE YOU CRIMINAL SCUM!
---
I've played 1 killer game on the new map so far, and jesus christ there are so many pallets. The only reason I got a 4k was because the survivors were being stupidly altruistic and got themselves killed. I can only imagine how rage inducing the map is against really good survivors
---
I absolutely love how the skills needed to play Ghostface tie in neatly with what he would do according to his lore. He would stalk his victims, map out their homes/surrounding areas, stay hidden, and strike when the time was right. He does just about the exact same thing in-game, and I love it so much.
---
On my first ever killer match I got curb stomped and did exactly this *however* my first ever kill came from that game as a survivor tried to taunt me at the hatch so I just pulled them out while they were jumping in. Don‚Äôt worry little Demogorgon your time to shine might not be now, in the future however, you rule the world. I really hope this match doesn‚Äôt get to them that bad :,(
---
Actually, you can disarm them without stepping into them, but you cannot if you do step into them. Well, you can, but it's gonna hurt.
---
I'll look into that. I'm sure I can wrangle up a small TV from something.

I 100% agree. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs well known that a lot of people want a multiple killers mode and I think it sounds great, even if we get a trial of it to see the community reaction and maybe then get it permanently. The licensed killers always feel really boring to me, I‚Äôd much rather have someone original that I can begin to like.
---
This is actually a social commentary post about the absurdity and ridiculousness DbD chapter requests are from the DbD fanbase. It disappoints me that such a simple minded individual doesn‚Äôt understand the most basic of parodies. The Dio section represents the numerous amount of anime suggestions made by the community, Monto‚Äôs toe crevasses represents the desires of DbD‚Äôs community like how Monto should be a fog whisperer or how much we want to see Noob3‚Äôs feet. A fucking bird symbolizes characters like Chucky and Bee who despite being a good fit for the game thematically, don‚Äôt fit the gameplay aspects of Dead by Daylight.

Brih my lobby had a rank 2 and a rank 20 come on ma'am
---
Half gorden the for demo-gogon
---
When you think about it, he *is* kinda fast. Normal killers like Trapper move at their speed because of their longer leg stride. Freddy‚Äôs short but somehow moves at the same speed. The man‚Äôs gotta be a triathlete when it comes to speed walking.
---
I'm kinda new but how hard are red ranks I heard a few people say red ranks are unfun and stressful as hell
---
Jumping in a locker will hide you, but will also almost certainly guarantee the death of your friend on the hook - if a killer doesn't see a ping from their tracking perk then they've no real reason to abandon their hook to go searching... at least until the penultimate hook, when they'll usually beeline for the hatch, ping or not.
---
Not really messed up. Charging up takes too long. Also there was no reason to throw down the pallet?
---
Is this real?
---
That Freddy‚Äôs movement is so bad, probably yellow rank
---
The fact Nurse and Billy have remained unchanged for so long yet they'll nerf every other thing in the game baffles the fuck out of me. I cant stand playing against Billy, it's such an oversaturated killer and hes not fun to play against anymore when it's the only killer you see for more than half your matches. At least Nurse takes a shred of skill and doesnt have a 1 shot and mobility ability in the same button. So many other things have been tweaked though. BNPs are trash now, every exhaustion perk got nerfed with the exhaustion changes, they entirely reworked Freddy as a killer... Yet hey, billy is fine
---
Better than ur name
---
it‚Äôs just dbd like u play now but everyone has the best perks possible and use the best killers most of the time.
---
Fashion by daylight
---
&gt; We even knew what perks the killer was running if someone happened to die early
---
you can't see the killer's perks until the game is over anymore?
---
The second one.
---
Did you like, have a falling out or something? What is meant by "alpha male" at Rank 1? I fear we've lost the plot lol.
---
To use a deductive argument, I'd say we did arrive at one point:
---
Premise 1: It takes skill to get to Rank 1 (You already agree with this)
---
Premise 2: Tru3Talent consistently attains Rank 1
---
Conclusion: Tru3Talent is skilled.
---
Do you deny it? Let me win this internet debate *pls*
---
I thought Mike was the one could drive not jason lol
---
I don't want to rank up.  
---
\*Gets to red ranks*  
---
Every game's unwinnable and I keep pipping.
---
I wonder if it releases tonight at midnight
---
I know this is gonna get me some hate but Legion is better than wraith. They‚Äôre both M1 killers that‚Äôs for sure but at least with Legion once you get your first hit you can use frenzy to re-engage with your target quickly and essentially negate the boost survivors get from being hit.
---
I think there's a happy medium here. The shimmer is necessary for ensuring the survivors have some form of counterplay around him, but there's also no reason for you to be able to see him from 70m away. I think the shimmer should be visible at ~16m so that survivors aren't just sitting ducks but also can't spot him from across the map.
---
&gt;Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average). The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
Good start I think, but I think it would be better if the rank was skewed towards the highest rank rather than just using it. For example, a rank 1 and rank 10 in SWF would be ranked ideally with a rank 3 killer.
---
maybe could queue up as a survivor, even appearing in lobby? So survivors see themselves and one other (there are still 4 survs but 1 of them is not visible)
---
No it was a paid thing. The videos became boring and long to make so I just stopped and he was cool with it. And by alpha male I mean like the top dog pro killer with all the skills. A rank 1 within rank 1 if you know what I mean.
---
"Go ahead and waste your pathetic decisive strike so I can end this game Yugi!"
---
Collision is how you find people who arent injured or sprinting.  
---
Besides, if they took out collision there'd be a bunch of wonky shit when she comes out of phasing inside of something.
---
Meh, matchmaking does not matter when its  bp farming season.
---
I love having to let people go in fear of being too good at my job
---
Credit to Vishthefish93 for the original post with the left picture from the office!
---
More love for bing bong boi is greatly desired
---
Well I just came back to dead by daylight. I was like hhhmmm who's a cool player and tru3 came to mind. So I watched him but realised he is as stale as bread compared to other killers.
---
It's pronounced "Eh-bone-ee"
---
I agree, rank 20 killers shouldn‚Äôt suffer just because a 4 man SWF has one member who‚Äôs rank 19. I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre changing this so the highest rank has priority when finding a killer.
---
Billy really isn‚Äôt op. Spirit is way better than him. Just loop a billy and he‚Äôs an m1 killer, it‚Äôs really that simple
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs just the Killer being a jerk about it. Somewhat of a taunt and whatnot.
---
TIL instadowns aren‚Äôt that good
---
Still has solid loops for balanced landing. Has solid loops in general. Plus, if you‚Äôre making a killer sacrifice multiple gens to hook one person and eat some pallets, that‚Äôs a pretty solid trade for survivors. Stealth killers can get a easy first hit, but most of them struggle in chases where again, those loops come in handy. An M1 killer has to waste a lot of time eating pallets and a stealth killer will struggle to end chases. Solid map for survs
---
They can succeed, it's just harder.
---
just keep at it and watch some guides on YouTube. it helps... good luck my son.. lol
---
Until then try to snag Play With Your Food [PWYF] so you can get a speed boost from your obsession. You can actually start the chase, let them go, and rinse/repeat until you're fully charged up. Full stacks on that makes a HUGE difference in closing in on loops
---
He's actually probably the most mediorce killer in my opinion he sorta needs it as his lunge doesn't work in chases often so it'll help if survivors just spam drop pallets
---
Been broken since at least May, should be an issue for them at some point. An acknowledgement would at a minimum be nice.
---
That smack after he gave up made me lose it.
---
Don‚Äôt always have those on hand, and a decent map is better than a bad map
---
I'm glad I wasnt the only one who noticed how Steve came every time he  got hit
---
but i wonder what the sign is for when we should close and reopen the game asap instead of waiting any further. it seems to me that the point may be after it gives you 2 error messages in a row that you have to dismiss with X. after that point, close and reopen the game asap because itll never connect if you simply continue to wait
---
The fact you consider Spirit stronger than Billy really makes me question your judgement on killer balance lol
---
That's why I put the question mark cause I wasn't sure
---
Tbh I enjoyed the guessing game lol
---
Hey atleast red moss will be a way more interesting add-on because we can finally have a stealth demogorgon build now meaning possibly more yoinks.
---
Yes a multiplayer game. With r e a l people.  Tbagging is just a way of saying "haha get rekt killer you fucking suck at the game so now I'm gonna make fun of you because who fucking cares if you stop playing the game because of the toxicity"
---
And Spirit is always an M1 killer. Check
---
Not many people are able to do that, but he really aced it.
---
At least with the Demo's I've played against -- yes, they needed it.
---
Best teabag :)
---
IT CRASHES THE GAME??? i was wondering why my game kept crashing shit
---
Dude you just post massive cringe it's time to delete
---
Also what kills were shit exactly? The ones that were homages to the originals? Or the original kills that blow all the others out of the water? [this](https://youtu.be/mxNAjgovko0) and [this](https://youtu.be/Nd5xweHX2Pc) are the best Freddy scenes in any Freddy movie fight me.
---
I mean I like it more than sheltered woods and lery's, but its definitely not a favorite of mine.
---
Forgot to take out the watermark.
---
No you're one of those incels who sits online crying about "SJWS" when it has nothing to do with the convo
---
Pretty inventive. Nice work!
---
While I agree it's an asshole thing to do, it's like survivors teabagging. Just ignore it, and play as fair as you can.
---
to your final point, the decision has been deemed unacceptable by society at large and is the reason why the the American's with Disabilities act and others like it around the world have been put in place.
---
The best way I found to play against survivors on the new map is to start out not respecting a single pallet, then start mixing it up near the middle of the match where they don't know if you'll respect or go around. The pallets on have strength if they actually stun you, if there isn't a stun, you're guaranteed a hit as long as you play it right.
---
Just got posted, looks like that'll be part of the patch tomorrow too:
---
https://reddit.com/comments/d8bxur
---
i said k that means just shut up
---
* Screenshots highlighting salty messages of any kind (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
* Bandwagon meme (memes which attempt to ride off the success of another post on /r/deadbydaylight without making significant changes).
---
It killed me.
---
Pretty sure the rule was more about the content than the format (every haunted grounds or ruin meme), but especially about the content screenshots of bad matchmaking and other content that is far from original. The meme format will die eventually.
---
Still kind a bit too restrictive to activate IMO.
---
Thank god I'm not the only one that thinks this
---
I‚Äôm sorry I missed that page in the reddit rule book. And I must have skimmed it in the sub rules.
---
That's one way to try to force a killer to waste a slot, lmao.
---
I feel so bad for this little fella
---
Handsome boy
---
Then she would be nurse... who people bitch about for being able to go through things
---
Sorry for the shadow!
---
Is all that dtuff not linked to psn account? Surely you can download the game again and it will be okay?
---
Oooo, awesome, thanks for the answer and ideas!
---
thanks!
---
Why leatherface so low? Every killer thats able to instadown cant be d tier
---
i think you can just re-download the game, update it, re-download all your dlc, and then use the download save file feature (press start on game icon, upload/download saved data, and choose to download it). no worries!
---
Yeah I kinda realized that like halfway through the match. Hawkins Lab is super mind game heavy compared to other maps it seems
---
Thing is, the killers offer the Moris and ask the entity if they can kill the last / one / all survivors themself, and not let them be consumed by the entity.
---
then hold the sprint button
---
You can get grabbed if it's a slow vault???
---
I'm good. Thanks for your concern.
---
I know Jane can come across like she enjoys getting hit but it at least can be plausible those are cries of pain when she‚Äôs injured. 
---
Steve just sounds like he‚Äôs getting pleasured by the hook or he‚Äôs rubbing one out.
---
all yours
---
See, obviously real
---
Finally can use dying light without crashing, wonder how good it'll be at slowing generators
---
Honestly that's the way to go. Solo survivor is rough. If you're not struggling with the killer, chances are you're struggling with your own random teammates. 
---
What do you play on? PC or console?
---
*Devious Oink*
---
there is not save files on ps4
---
just download the game again
---
your progress it will be saved on bhvr servers
---
Then technically, So is nurse. Check
---
I've seen killers on here ranting about how much they hate The Game and how survivor sided it is too.  A lot of us that play survivor on it disagree with you.  I don't even run balanced often which is God tier on that map and I still like it for looping.  There are so many pallets and they are incredibly safe.  The map has numerous God pallets and the dropdown room back up through stairs and dropdown again is one of the strongest loops in the game.  Wastes tons of time.  It is far stronger than you think.
---
I grabbed a healthy survivor over the pallet
---
The only way I've escaped Hawkins is just by putting gen pressured whenever I can. I rarely heal on that map unless it's after I finish a gen, cause if killer snowballs 2 hooks on that map, you're pretty screwed in terms of gen progress.
---
Somethings up with we are gonna live forever...... HMMM
---
Pc and it‚Äôs toxic and full of randoms that crouch and hide and rarely save XD
---
‚Äú...for fun‚Äù
---
How about - you work faster knowing your buddy is in danger, while your buddy is within the killer terror radius you get 6/9/12% faster action speed. If your buddy is killed randomly make friends with another survivor after 30 seconds. During those 30 seconds you are exposed.
---
You're not wrong. His moans are also very high pitched compared to how I thought he would sound.
---
Exactly why I say Billy is the most OP, thanks for proving my point. Check mate.
---
Oh whoops, I see how that can be misinterpreted. I meant no collision with players. All other collision should be as normal. So, not like nurse at all.
---
Love it!
---
Because getting hit with chainsaw is impossible. It‚Äôs a glorified pallet breaker. No map pressure either.
---
What would he think if he saw this? I'd be pretty upset that someone I once trusted enough to pay and edit videos is now calling me "stale as bread", "kinda sucks", "not good", "all talk no walk"... Sounds like you really dislike the guy. It's one thing to not be interested in something, and another to actively dislike them and express that. Are you sure you didn't have a falling out?
---
I suppose, but the extra 10 seconds of cooldown is pretty harsh.  
---
Granted, you'll still likely be able to use it a solid amount, but you also have to consider the fact that the portals still make a sound, and you're still visible when climbing out of the portal.  
---
If the add-on rendered the portals quiet, it would be a lot more interesting, in my opinion.
---
I have to say, his scream (at least from before) sounds a bit too melodic, not at all like he is in pain, but I don't think he sounds like he is faking an anime orgasm.
---
Yeah, when you get exposed it lets you know
---
&gt; especially useless shit like Mindbreaker
---
working gens pauses the Exhaustion timer, I'd call that far from worthless. maybe not as amazing as, say, Ruin, but far from worthless.
---
Yea they do but if someone isn't paying attention or the generators sounds are too loud it could give a yoink or a free it which I'm down for
---
Sometimes I forget killers are in 1st person lmao
---
Would be cool but you're assuming that an eternity in purgatory that the knife still has shine.
---
What about levels 1 and 2?
---
There‚Äôs like three perks designed to easily find totems. Det. Hunch + a map with a crystal bead would knock out the totems before the second gen is conpleted.
---
It sucks to go against NOED but if you aren‚Äôt actively trying to deal with it before its a problem, that‚Äôs on you.
---
I think you get that cosmetic after hooking over 9,000 survivors.
---
Calm down dude, no need to be insulting
---
What's VA?
---
Longer queue times
---
Why not both?
---
Voice actor. Or Virginia, depending.
---
I know that's a thing but the person I'm replying to implied that it was just a thing that could happen to see and tell your pals about
---
edit: changed you to that because i had a brainfart and it didn't make sense
---
[177810](https://nhentai.net/g/177810/)
---
Hex: Haunted Chonk
---
When the totem is cleansed, all survivors turn into black cats and suffer from the Chonky status effect for 60 seconds.
---
Oh, OK. That does make more sense.
---
Although I will admit, the few games I've played as spirit, I got really freaking confused when u was running into players... thought I was glitching lol.
---
There are already threads about this, but thanks tho. 
---
Git gud fam
---
I don't care, dc's are being punished with bans now via dedicated servers. Again I SHOULDN'T GET PUNISHED because a survivor decided to do ANYTHING as killer. If I wanted to deal with other peoples shit or rely on other people I WOULDN'T BE PLAYING KILLER NOW WOULD I?
---
I found this community when I started reddit this just popped out. Plus I play Identity V, I thought since IDV copied dbd I'll be able to understand but no. They are same about the basic mechanics 1v4 hunter will kill you you need to escape the place, but other than that everything else is different.
---
T4 is just Super Saiyan
---
Slender man maybe?
---
When I hook someone, sometimes I‚Äôll hit them so it cancels the hook scream, cause I don‚Äôt want to hear a minute long scream. 
---
Seriously, some fo them put more effort into screaming than surviving.
---
Because you won't reach the endgame when you have an Ebony Mori.
---
I do it to cancel annoying screams, I‚Äôm looking at you meg, and Steve, and tapp
---
Lol. Ok.
---
It takes forever to join a game, it would be a bad decision to split the playerbase.
---
I do it cause it's funny tbh
---
The game isn‚Äôt about doing well. It‚Äôs about cooperation, even if you‚Äôre not on the same team. The point of a game is fun. People ruin it, granted, whether it‚Äôs exit tbags (demo works well for that) or people who just loop around pallets. Sometimes it‚Äôs not their fault either. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúbad design,‚Äù it‚Äôs just reward for doing things
---
I love to see ruin because it's not too bad honestly. However, I do get scared when a killer has huntresses lullaby. So many failed skill checks
---
True, still nice insurance.
---
I‚Äôve actually had this happen. My wife and I play together and I noticed on her screen I wasn‚Äôt there, but on my screen we were both present.  It‚Äôs happened a few times so far.
---
This makes me want to main Steve more than I already do
---
but it's not really the same for both sides, because at higher ranks, entire killers become totally unviable, whereas survivors are all the same.
---
ü§¢ü§Æ
---
As others have said, SWF automatically destroys this. 
---
Let's say Jake, David, Ace, and Ash all load up into a game of Dead by Daylight. 
---
Jake finds a generator, and he sees Ace come up to the generator and start working on it with him. He decides to say something in their voice chat:
---
Jake: "Hey Ace"
---
Ace: "Where are you? I don't see you."
---
Jake: "Oh so this is the killer. I'm running now. The Thing is the killer guys, so everyone make sure to call out when you see each other because it might not actually be the other person."
---
I think the idea of blending in as a survivor *is* a cool concept on the surface, but when it comes down to actual gameplay, it becomes weak very quickly. There's a lot of SWF groups that play the game with voice chat, and the killer has no idea if the lobby is actually all together or not, so they're taking a gamble that they'll either be decent in the next round or just another M1 killer
---
I think he'd like that.
---
It makes swf virtually unplayable, it sucks as of right now
---
Oh it‚Äôs def shirtless P3 Michael with a Eboni!
---
I just got a decent perk build on my Ash too. God dammit
---
How does one git gud with Nurse? What perks and add-ons are best for beginners?
---
Having trouble stroking that epeen?   Trophies are for unimaginative people who need OTHERS to dictate goals in a game.
---
Highlighting the emblem at the end of game will tell you everything about that emblem.
---
it's possible to get rank 1 without either of those things though
---
It does not. It is classified as a Deviousness event which means that, with the exception of Legion, it won‚Äôt give or take STBFL stacks.
---
WAZZZZZUUUP
---
But all those pallets.... *Shivers*
---
He means just not worth running over already good perks. It wont change the ‚Äúmeta‚Äù like how Infectious Fright or Spirit Fury did.
---
If you escape, you get a minimum of 5000 points. If you didn't, it's possible that a disconnect by the killer caused an error totaling the points.
---
Other things that give survival points are escaping by the hatch, self healing, and successfully escaping the hook by yourself. There are probably a few more.
---
Edit: struggling on the hook, escaping the killer's grasp, and escaping a trap also give points.
---
That's a killer with little dick syndrome desperately wanting to feel strong when they are sad sad little neckbeards IRL.
---
7k BP to maybe get a yoink on someone bad at the cost of all map pressure is just bad. It doesn't need that drawback.
---
*too
---
Now I cant introduce my friends to this game without them getting downed in 5 seconds :(. Was playing a swf with a rank 8, 13, 19, 19 and we would get steamrolled against a rank 8 killer
---
While stalking, they will change color from white to red. Once they are red, you can no longer gain Evil Within from them.
---
&gt;Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average).
---
SUCK IT MATCHMAKING ABUSERS.... Enjoy your "just playing with friends" now.

That fake heart beat on that map is scary

Who cares about a water mark? Get a sense of humor moron

A good survivor team will always beat a good killer. Period.  
---
There are not however, many good survivor teams. There are a lot of amazing survivors, but in teams, eh... But when they work together and work efficiently, nothing a killer can do.
---
I was so excited to play as the Demo. I was terrible. But I kept at it. After-game chat was filled with crap like "ez" and "trash". I hope that doesn't become a growing behavior in this game, I like that in-game meme-ing, after game chats are generally super chill.
---
Edit: I've been playing since about 6 months after original release. Been seeing a bit more toxicity lately.
---
Hmm, well I agree about Amanda but she has that very good ambush attack, also height doesn't necessarily deter power
---
Devs you don't plan on fixing Second Wind activation condition ?
---
In the description it's indicated that it activates after you heal for a total of one health state. But in game you have to heal in fact one health state all by yourself in one shot. It won't activate if you heal for exemple a total of 3 health states with other survivors helping you.
---
It means that if we don't focus on unhooking with We will make it equipped, there are a lot of games where we won't have a chance to make use of Second Wind.
---
Where‚Äôs my battle royale mode: 20 killers and 80 survivors with 100 generators
---
1st part, love it.
---
2nd part is not really my cup of tea. Doesn‚Äôt seem balanced.
---
The biggest yikes is that someone actually THINKS of this when he gets hit. Like Wtf why is that creepy shit on your mind while playing a horror game. Oof
---
lmfaoo wish I could recreate this while playing surv
---
qin in the background is me anytime there's a party at my house
---
I just think it's funny he sounds like a girl moaning, not like, specifically hentai lol.
---
My advice: wait until tomorrow when they‚Äôre hotfixing the matchmaking issues. There have been multiple posts about it, in fact one is stickied on the front page right now.
---
They‚Äôre the same. The only difference between the tiers of perks is bleeding frequency.
---
D:
---
The high number of SWF with a mystery DC on death hook implies either a shit load of rage quits or the exploitation of this exact bug.
---
I don‚Äôt like this personally.
---
As a survivor it lowers the skill gap. Looping and being chased is one of the fundamental skills for being a good survivor.
---
This new map is a bad directional step as it doesn‚Äôt allow you to use these skills. 
---
And as a killer it means you‚Äôre breaking/getting hit with more pallets, which honestly is just plain annoying.
---
I‚Äôll stick with looking behind me manually
---
üíã‚ù§Ô∏è

I'd say it's pretty accurate, but there's a little untranslatable "pun" with Endiabl√© which comes from Diable and means Devil, and for a native speaker it's definetly reffering to the devil, etc...

Source: I'm french

Yup my friend did that Saturday because he couldn‚Äôt connect to the game, deleted everything and redone loaded it all and everything was still there. Info stored on their servers...
---
Xbox has a crazy stupid bug that you can tell you have if you can't wiggle from the killer's grasp. As shown, the exit gates won't work for you, so your only hope is the hatch. If the hatch is closed... it was nice knowing ya lol.
---
I was in the same situation where i was unable to heal but i escape without any problem
---
It was removed with the Stranger Things update to accommodate for the new friends list and lobby system :)
---
Perks, as much tracking perks as you can. Run 4 tracking perks if you can. Spies from The Shadows, Shadowborn, Whispers, I‚Äôm All Ears, Bloodhound, Predator, Iron Maiden.  Addons: don‚Äôt.
---
gone. reduced to atoms
---
So NOED?
---
Spirit.
---
I mean upstairs is a death wish for nurse, if a survivor brings you up there you have about a 90% chance of teleporting downstairs. Though most players have no clue how the upper floor nurse counter works.
---
There is on mobile
---
There‚Äôs a hotfix tomorrow for the game. To slow it down, I suggest running something like dying light, thanataphobia. Things like that. Maybe even running franklins when people bring in flashlights as a ‚ÄúHAHA suck it‚Äù kinda thing lmao
---
I believe midnight tonight? (Eastern?) not confirmed
---
Yes yes yes
---
Don't forget Franklin's demise
---
Legion gets stbfl on frenzy attacks?
---
What's that?  Nurse is fucked?
---
Don't worry guys, we're nerfing pig next patch!
---
I agree with this. We've all vsed good and bad killers. And every game, looping, and for the killer, loop-chasing(?), feels like the skill that determines the flow and winners of the game.
---
Taking away loops and making it so you're just throwing down tons of of pallets changes the game from being a skillfull mind game, to a repetitive and boring pallet respecting/hitting fest.
---
Is there an Etsy or something? I‚Äôd love to check it out too.
---
I really hope so, your message is giving me hope, I'm still waiting full download...
---
Plague's a win-win IMO.
---
If survivors cleanse, you become omega huntress. It becomes super easy to down survivors.
---
If survivors don't cleanse, they might as well be all running no mither without the ability to recover from dying. Sure she can only M1, but she has to do half the work (theoretically) to down survivors
---
So true.
---
Fuck you too
---
It's not harder but I do end up playing the game significantly less than before until the rank reset.
---
jUsT dOnT tUnNeL /s
---
Fixated has fucking ruined me.  I feel so slow now when I don't have it.
---
id also love to see them do some sort of visual symbols on the screen for terror radius and other auditory elements of the game for deaf individuals.
---
This is wonderful! I really hope it's like this, now I am waiting full download and will check... I hope so much that BHVR servers saved my progress and not resetted it
---
Why is Spongebob the go-to meme image for this subreddit?
---
No, it increases the skill gap. You can no longer just run from jungle gym to jungle gym to shack to center building while dropping every safe pallet on the way. There‚Äôs little counterplay for Killers. Survivors either make it to the safe pallet which forces you to kick it and give them time to run to the next safe pallet, or you try and play the pallet which you‚Äôll never hit a good survivor on until you are bloodlust 3. Survivors now actually have to know how to play and mind game pallets instead of running around a wall 1-2 times and dropping a pallet before they get hit. The only thing that makes these pallets unbalanced towards killers is bloodlust. If every pallet in the game was like this bloodlust doesn‚Äôt need to be a thing.

I also disagree with you saying you end up breaking more pallets anyway as killer. That‚Äôs only true if you treat them as safe and don‚Äôt try to play them. On Badham/Hawkins, there‚Äôs literally no reason to break the playable pallets until the chase is over. There‚Äôs way too many pallets on those maps and if you just mindlessly kick pallet after pallet you will lose the game.
---
My friend has been playing this game for two years and only just hit single digit ranks last month, two days before rank reset with 2-4+ hours played every day. I've been red rank every single month I actually play the game.
---
It sucks that I won't be able to play with them anymore.
---
YOUR TEAMMATES ARE RUBBER RUBBER RUBBER!!!!!!

This is really amazing! Im seeing a bright white light in my devastation feelings!! Can't wait the full download is complete!
---
Damn should have done that
---
Sometimes he's legit completely immune to perks like spine chill/premonition without any rhyme or reason.
---
Scratched Mirror Myers ate my Distortion in ~30 seconds. Nurse's Calling eats it quickly too. BBQ &amp; Chill is a "reasonable" pace so long as I alternate between closing in to the killer and praying my teammates don't get slugged.
---
Personally, I'd rather Distortion have a long cooldown rather than a few chargers. Same effects, just add cooldowns.
---
ok? the person im replying to didn't say anything about someone dc'ing in his scenario
---
YES, PLEASE
---
Same there's definitely some sort of auto aim otherwise my camera wouldn't automatically adjust to the Survivor's position when swinging.
---
Why
---
Maybe for a scrubby nurse üò≤ i have no trouble phasing in the new map anywhere
---
I'm mediocre and know this. Hover around rank 4-7. But it usually is a billy or Nurse. Get the occasional Myers or spirit.
---
No. No. No. No meeting you in bad mood. üò¶üò¶
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused The Pig to have a faster carrying speed than other Killers. 
---
Gotta nerf the pig again!
---
It's actually your pathetic, rude, defensive attitude. Smells like insecurity to me!
---
Uwu is not a joke.
---
It's a life stile
---
It works decently on Myers and Freddy's maps. Tbh, at this point I'm just using it since I don't have ruin or surveil on my Demogorgon yet.
---
Thanks. He did rage quit after me and one other guy escaped but I didn‚Äôt know if that had affected it at all.
---
Its debilism
---
These pallets are 100% a guessing game while most maps with loops around pallets have 50/50's attached to them. But they also have skillful plays around them.
---
 Killers can moonwalk and abuse the red stain to bait window vaults or pallet vaults and survivors can window juke or pallet juke while also using their knowledge of distance to allow them to bait a swing on a window vault while still making the vault.
---
But on the new map, all of that goes out of the window. You just have to 100% of the time guess a 50/50 of throwing the pallet or continue running. Throwing the pallet guarantees you either stun or get hit. While not throwing it guarantees another loop or a hit. No matter what you do, you have to guess every. single. pallet.
---
There is no skill around those loops. Which is why I honestly love it and hate it as a survivor and killer player. Both sides struggled and prosper from it, but not in healthy ways. The struggle and prosper are FAR ends of the spectrum. 
---
The struggle = impossible to run the killer/impossible to catch the survivor
---
The prosper = Impossible to be caught/impossible to never catch
---
The same argument could be said for traditional loops, but you can skill inject skillful plays into those loops in order to manipulate the opponent into making a mistake. Hawkins is just 2 kids crashing action figures together, hoping something will happen.
---
Im redownloading, but i already checked that i have no save files... But some are saying that on ps4 there are no dbdv save files because its connected to ps4 account and the progress is saved into bhvr server... Really hope so!
---
I know we arent supposed to make topics about it anymore, but the last update really made it 10 times worse.
---
alternatively: rubber chicken
---
Thank you I sent :)
---
u forget the fact that while survivors may be viable, not all perks are. I mean, look at ace?
---
Never thought about the compare to teabagging. Fair enough new way to look at things. Thx
---
It‚Äôs being fixed with the hotfix, please stop spamming the Reddit with, ‚ÄúBROKEN MATCHMAKING BHVR WHY PLS EXPLAIN‚Äù 
---
I‚Äôm sorry but seeing this 24/7 when the questions been asked and answered a million times is pretty obnoxious.
---
Hirame is pure quality
---
I disagree with it being a solid survivor map. It‚Äôs generally sucks and especially because you never know what floor they on. If someone else plays it my load out is set before I know I‚Äôm playing there
---
For real? I thought that's how it was supposed to work. God damn it, guess I'll stick with inner strength.
---
Isn‚Äôt this a repost or...?
---
**The screaming is funny**
---
Removed for salty after game chat
---
Rip sid!
---
Only if the survivors are bad.
---
That's not what I was saying...
---
Playing Demogorgon has been a painful experience for me in general
---
Isn't Pig pretty crappy anyways?
---
MILK FOR THE KHORNE FLAKES
---
&gt; Fixed an issue that caused The Trapper's bear trap auras to appear open until getting within close proximity of the trap. 
---
Thank you. That was bothering me so much when playing trapper because I have a shitty memory and won't remember which ones we're snapped/weren't set.
---
cursed_myers
---
I highly doubt it will ever happen outside of events, they don't want to split the player base into different queues.
---
Yup. It's a template.
---
Its just part of the game
---
Chef Freddy, too.
---
How about as soon as the game starts? I still think its sort of weak but maybe as soon as they get in a lobby?
---
Oh I see, another meme to slap on this page ig
---
Good
---
U were exposed
---
yes, but at least you can still play the characters you bought. a liller's design is far more central to the game than a perk. and anyway, killers also have the same perk issue on top of more than half of the killers being unusable.
---
The fix they listed in the patch notes doesn't sound like it will fix it completely. 
---
I've been in a SWF with all red ranks and still gotten baby killers...
---
they must've looked into the lights inside of pennywise's mouth. :O
---
I guess that makes sense.
---
There isn't much actual advice I can give you besides just practice and don't  be afraid to try new mind games. Other than that, just make sure your loops are as tight as possible.
---
That being said, don't expect to win as Doctor very often. I'm a red rank killer with 600 hours in killer and even I struggle to win as Doctor, he honest to god just sucks.
---
Its a popular meme template in a lot of places. It was a part of a lot of peoples childhood and its been around for so long that theres a lot of memeable scenes
---
If it helps, I knew exactly what you meant. It's a pretty old term, believe it or not. The furthest back I remember seeing it was in vanilla WoW in regards to leading mobs around, usually to other players or to cities.
---
Still no word on the Daily Ritual bug where removing one replaces it with something and when you exit out of the rituals and go back in, it‚Äôs changed?
---
Also, the fact that there are only killer rituals.
---
Im all ears is especially good on her
---
So the correct would be for you to steamroll the killer? The ideal for me would be a weighted average with higher weight the higher the rank but this way is still better than average.
---
Demo and Feng... uh oh
---
He gains stacks, yes. Not sure about the cooldown though
---
When you hit the other side of the vault.
---
survivors are just skins, killers arent. obv not all killers can be top tier mate. that‚Äôs just how life works.
---
!remindme
---
What are the best ways to get bloodpoints and level my killers/survivors. Been playing since just before Legions release and feel like I still have very low level everything.

I also laugh and mimic him, it's a riot on my discord.

Ever heard of this thing called kill your friends?
---
Huntress has a 48m lullaby you can use to gauge distance with. Stop healing when you hear it and she'll never get a NC proc.
---
Edited out incorrect directional info - it's no longer that way.
---
Yeah, the original killers have really cool designs, I have to try a couple others
---
Then overcharge is stupidly broken tbh... Just use overcharge when you rank reset and you will see why a difficult skill check would already be too much of a change. Every single gen that you kick and they touch will pop.
---
Even better build, iron will, dance with me, lithe and quick and quiet
---
Only until 50%
---
Quick question, what's it like being a shemale? /s
---
A good SWF team can demolish any killer.
---
The one exception to this is your friends, who will die immediately then wonder why they bought the game.
---
5 Seconds is a lot. We would be fine with 1/2 full seconds probably. Its just that you don't even need to waste time tapping it.
---
That depends, are you a girl or a guy?
---
Can't wait to play this on my Switch so I can let all my teammates down.
---
I've never gotten GF in this map or Lery's (thank god cause I'll probably have a heart attack lol). Only seen Myers once but it wasn't too bad.
---
Ranks are the same as in any other game higher rank better players.
---
Start by getting new perks until you find a build  you like hold circle
---
Slenderman isn't an SCP, he's a creepypasta. 
---
Though the Slenderman could be an interesting addition to Dbd. He is kind of a modern horror icon due to his game sorta reigniting the survival horror genre, despite the very poor sequel and movie deal, so it wouldn't be *too* unprecedented. The licensing might be weird though
---
First off, I don't believe (In the 2010 version) that Freddy's intentions were fully explored, yes he abused adolescents but he was found out before he could do anything more, whether he would commit to murdering those kids later is a mystery but given after he returns he has no problem killing them I don't think it was far off his bucket list so to counter your claim I don't believe he was "just a pedophile." He clearly had darker intentions what with the glove and all. Secondly, it also wasn't explored whether his powers originate from the Dream Demons or something else and if they do whether said Dream Demons have the same motive as the original Nightmare Dream Demons did. All things considered even in prison child pedophilia is a frowned upon ordeal and in addition Freddy clearly tortured and physically harmed the children so Demons would obviously have a reason to have their eye on him, it's not like demons are picky and nowhere does it state the Dream Demons didn't have other contracts with similar individuals in the past maybe Freddy just happened to be "the next guy in line."
---
EDIT: Also the 2010 isn't really revenge, it's just Freddy's continuation of his previous work. I don't remember if Jackie's Freddy has the same background and motivation as Robert's but I'm assuming no.
---
Since buying Deathgarden i got an extra copy, haven't given it to anyone. I'm asking if anyone wants it.
---
You, my friend, deserve an upvote.
---
Anybody got tips for going up against the spirit? Im red rank and always get pooped on by her
---
Good. And right before the bloodhunt.
---
However i feel the damage has been done. With all the new players from the stranger things doc having to deal with this shitty matchmaking has left a bad taste in thier mouths.
---
I just hope they give DbD a second chance.
---
There are only so much perk slots you can use... I don't run more than 2 perks to slow the game down, otherwise you end up with no perks to help in other areas. If you're choosing a full slowdown build you will lack in other areas, sure you might not let them escape but that is not how the game calculates score(pip).
---
Infectious changed the meta?
---
Zzz getting tired of the fangirling
---
Matchmaking is extra broken right now we are all waiting for a fix. Keep at it and keep learning, turn messages off and just focus on learning how the game works and how to play. It is not as straightforward as it seems and is full of deep strategy and mind games. Don‚Äôt let people drive you away. There are a ton of new people also still learning so many of your matches on either side may be a total shitshow.
---
Ranks: are based off of 4 emblems you earn based on how good you do. Look at the emblems page after the game (before you leave the lobby)  and it will explain them all.
---
Perks: you must grab them on the blood web. Always look at which one you want first and go straight for that perk before anything else.
---
Drop items on ps4: I believe the default is circle
---
They made it so it‚Äôs non directional in a recent update. So you can‚Äôt tell which way she‚Äôs coming from.
---
Everything for the extra points! Quite the surge of emotions before escaping.
---
Its rly meh, the fact it last 3 seconds means that in a chase you can just drop the pallet and stand still or walk away, its supposed to counter sprint burst but it effectively buff it because you can now use it mid-chase. Its like old thanatophobia, cool concept, awful numbers to be worth it
---
A lot of the healing noises sound really sexual too. It's like "guys, right now?"
---
Being toxic isn't meant to be apart of the game.
---
It's a good point, more than I can say certain people are putting forward on this post, but I actually think it might work in certain areas. Remember, the Thing bears all the same attributes of a Survivor so they can crouch, vault pallets, windows, etc. They can, for the most part, keep up with a survivor. Even in the SWF scenario, once I have a team in an area where a loop would be difficult, I'd transform back into the Thing and start swinging.
---
The other approach would be to approach from an angle players may not initially be looking. Killers tend to rush at a location because typically their terror radius or imposing size gives them away on approach. However, as a killer of smaller stature and with the ability to approach from an angle not easily noticed, it could easily provide the window to transform before the survivors can react. This not only fits the lore of the Thing from the movie but also provides a similar Wraith effect.
---
Which leads me to the obvious follow up question, "Why not play Wraith?" Wraith is pretty large and, even while invisible, an attentive player can spot him. This plays again back into the Thing is smaller which allows it to take angles that other killers would be spotted in a mile away.
---
It's no perfect fan concept, I know, and I do appreciate your input, but I still think it could be viable if you properly use mind games.
---
I agree for the most part, but I think huntress would go in S tier
---
Good stuff then drop the part you dont like üëç
---
Thy has been cleansed. Now we must cleanse thy hook.
---
Aww, poor bing bong boy. :(
---
Super cute doodle, I love it!
---
Everytime I'm playing Steve and one of my friends come to heal me they'll say "mmm some lovin time".
---
The killer rituals being more prevalent is most likely intentional so that the player base is encouraged to play more killers since a lot of people will be wanting to play Nancy/Steve.
---
I used the new dying light, and I was using Myers for a daily and I only having to level 8. Also, I wasn't chasing for too long, it was just a matter of the whole team working on generators extremely quick
---
I like most of the killers, funny enough I prefer the original killers than any licensed one, you can try all of them at level 1 prior to leveling them just to get a feel of what their power does.
---
Just ignore it. Match making is messed up at the moment but will be fixed tomorrow.  Just play and have fun and learn
---
BRING THE HOLY WATER
---
Reeee shut up it‚Äôs part of the game deal with it I‚Äôve seen so many fucking survivors call me camping while I‚Äôm chasing two people or breaking a gen survivors act as if being a killer is so fucking easy when you don‚Äôt ‚Äútunnel‚Äù even if it‚Äôs a smart play I HAVE to let you heal and I HAVE to give last guy hatch or like four people three if I‚Äôm lucky will curcify me
---
The fastest way to get blood bloodpoints is to have BBQ and Chili (a leatherface teachable perk) to level 3 on a killer you can do pretty good with consistently. As long as you hook all 4 players at least once you should get at least 40k even if you have a bad match. Up to 64k for a perfect match. That's not even counting blood point offerings
---
As someone who plays survivor and killer pretty evenly im pissed lol
---
I wasn't aware of that change, thanks!
---
Thank you! Bing bong boy is now under our wing and we‚Äôll protect him best we can!
---
No, but you‚Äôre supposed to let them try. You can still get a 5 gen kill, but if it doesn‚Äôt last long, then nobody really tried
---
Doctor love to torture and kill People they are just test subjects for him. I think he use those head gears to stay in focus or some shit like that
---
5/7
---
My dumbass thought he would be German since "Herman" is a germanic sounding name.
---
The dark skin would be because he got burned by electricity.
---
That's how I interpreted his design when I first saw him at least.
---
I am blessed.
---
No problem. It‚Äôs crazy when you think she‚Äôs one way and pops up behind you lol.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôll keep at it, as much as I complained, I like the game
---
You can't mindgame them if they can see you. Imagine yr at a Cc wall, if you try to hide your red stain and moonwalk a survivor with OoO can just see you and it doesn;t work. So you can only braindeadly follow them on a loop, which is not efficient as killer.
---
Lol!
---
The fuck happened to your comment.
---
Nothing on broken trophies...
---
I have the random replace issue but I don't have the killer only ritual issue. Maybe unrelated issue?
---
Did they do their own voice acting or nah?
---
If you look at some of the patch notes, much smaller issues were addressed.
---
This is the third time you've shown your shitty video. No one cares
---
No, which is why this is so funny to me. If they just had him do it, it wouldn't sound this out of place.
---
What the hell, that was the most demonical looking ghostface I've ever seen. I would scream so much if that happened to me in-game.
---
He applied the face paint to it, which, I personally don't understand lol. Would have looked a lot better if he kept it his hair color.
---
Lol look how that ended up. I think we did a pretty good job so far.
---
See you wont even know cause i dont bring items. And yes i know survivors will do that especially for their precious key or maps.
---
Light born is a must have perk for all of my killers lol
---
This dude‚Äôs actually the reason I got into this game in the first place
---
Thats not fair. If im dominating in any other multiplayer game, am i required to let the others players win in order to "win" by game standards?
---
The problem is that to many toxic players are out there bullying/insulting the survivors after winning, so most survivors won't even listen to the killer in the endgame chat
---
This weekend starting the 29th is double bloodpoints.
---
Broken ass ranking system
---
You are correct, Jane is indeed

I thought it was the first demodoggo from season 1
---
yeah this. if you stop to break every pallet that is thrown down, it's going to take you a loooong time to catch someone. You can go around *most* of them.

I did lose him what are you talking about lol and I never provoked him I was just playing the game

Aren't Clowns Fu*king Funny?

I agree with that 100%. It's always been white, but since the last update, it's a very bold white. Very annoying! üò≠ DEVS!!!!! PLEASE FIX! ü§£
---
Spine chill is not getting fixed?
---
I think 049 would be pretty good
---
You can still mind game them it‚Äôs just not as easy.
---
Almost voted but it was 69
---
Honestly the stability of the game is a joke right now - long wait times, complete mismatches with ranks, endless loading screen crashes and end game crashes, randomly losing items and add ons when escaping. It‚Äôs a thousand times worse than it was before the chapter released and they need to fix it ASAP
---
If you get all rank 20 level 1 players, wouldn‚Äôt you try to give them a chance? It‚Äôs essentially the same if you have a generally easier group. Don‚Äôt try to make the game quick. It‚Äôs less rewarding for both sides too
---
omg that was wonderful
---
I hate it revert
---
This is FUCKING ADORABLE I love it thank you
---
What did he said?
---
That explains a few wtf moments I had when I jumped over to survivor. I just assumed I was too used to killer and hadn't played much lately with a dash of suspicion audio was borked again lol
---
Nice art
---
A guy.
---
But it is, so quit or stop complaining and letting it get to you. When I get people who teabag, I laugh, I‚Äôm confident in my ability to 4K and then send them a ‚Äúnice tbag.‚ÄùIf I‚Äôm feeling like a douche, I‚Äôll give them a nice facecamp. My chainsaw makes it so they‚Äôre gonna die 10/10 times. I see a SwF, I play good addons on Billy so I can‚Äôt get bullied. If you play Wraith against a fucking red rank SwF with one baby, you‚Äôre going to get bullied. Adapt
---
It‚Äôs not that they are more prevalent, it‚Äôs that they are literally all I get. 
---
When I get the bug that replaces my ritual with another and then changes again, I sometimes get a survivor ritual but then it always changes to a killer ritual.
---
Maybe it is just more prevalent and I‚Äôm unlucky, but I haven‚Äôt got a survivor ritual since the update
---

---
Potentially. I know if at least one other person who has been getting only killer rituals.
---
And then there‚Äôs just Myers who just says ‚Äúfuck you, I‚Äôm the boogeyman, try and stop me from grabbing and stabbing this bitch‚Äù.
---
I think The Thing needs another ability to help it in chases or map pressure, even if SWF doesnt make it worthless, it makes The Thing less powerful.
---
Exposed. Whenever you‚Äôre one hit at the end, a ghost face, Myers, etc. you can be downed without consequence
---
Depends on who I'm up against but it can be a great map. Certain killers get hurt by the Game more than survivors do.
---
Also I enjoy it more than most and it's fun burning the offering and hearing my 3 teammates groaning in Discord.

Don't tell Steve how to live his life.
---
maybe i'm whooshing here but I don't think it was a bug I think he was just teasing. If you let go of the mori button quickly it cancels it. Lot of people do it for memes or to bm. Leatherface's is especially good because you whack them with the hammer over and over and over again every time you do it.
---
It‚Äôs especially good when you bring a medkit with a syringe to save somebody who‚Äôs downed
---
Or look up. Or at a wall. Or literally just look away from the survivors.
---
They all escaped with flashlights
---
I think OP is going in order of releases of each and every killer. So we probably will get a plague one, but it won't be until next Monday (assuming OP keeps up a daily schedule of these until then).
---
*Let's get high!*
---
Went up against a Spirit the other day and after she hooked the first person in the basement, she just face camped him (which we could all see because the survivor was running Kindred).  So we rushed the gens but someone decided to try and go for the rescue before they too got hooked and camped.  So it was just me and my friend left doing gens, but we decided to be altruistic and try and free them but then I went down and eventually, so did my friend.  After the game, I get a message "gg ez" from the killer.
---
Then a few games later, I go up against my first lag switcher on PS4.  I DC'ed once I saw what he was doing, but I regret not recording the footage to report them.
---
Almost every match atm, I swear.
---
Yeah I love seeing where they are in a chase, it gives me time to finish a gen or react if they come near me it‚Äôs great
---
Now killers expecting respect are worse than toxic killer imo
---
Not saying you HAVE to, just it's a courtesy to let them go, unless maybe you're having a really bad game or something. If you have ever played survivor, then you would know how much it sucks to get unhooked, only to get farmed right after
---
Yep it's always the cocky one clicking at you with a torch. I ignore them until they come to rescue someone then I mori them if possible.
---
Bruh, relax.
---
I can only run killers in the Game or the new map because of all the rooms and turns there are. Easy money.
---
I would upvote but you have the perfect amount
---
Lmao the amount of times I've been like "don't run over here. Don't do it. Oh, you fucker." And had to dip off a gen because of coincidence is so high. I was prepared though thanks to Empathy :)
---
Oh yes running across the map to get a flashlight save is definitely good gameplay. (Because working on gens to escape is stupid.) Like i said before, if its happening out of bond range, its pointless. You are wasting so much time (that otherwise could be used on gens) spent running to get a flashlight save if its out of bond range.
---
Also if you have ears, then you can hear myers breathing, and if you have eyes you can just look out for GF while on a gen.
---
Chill.
---
*Just as planned.*
---
Look at the big brain on survivor Freud over here. 
---
I do it because it‚Äôs fun.
---
The problem is that the matchmaking doesn't work properly. It was always supposed to go based on average rank, but for some reason it seemed to only really focus on the lowest rank. You could have 3 rank 1 players and a rank 20, it would for some reason find matches against killers closer to rank 1 by a long shot.
---
If they made it weighted towards lower ranks rather then match exclusively off their ranks I feel it would work best. I was just thinking of buying my cousin the game because it can be fun with friends but brutal to learn alone, but it's sort of an issue now of they'll just get ranched for hours and hours.
---
&gt;Fixed an issue that caused pallet and vault auras to be white instead of yellow when using the Windows of Opportunity perk.
---
Aww, I kinda liked this change... ):
---
We're doing the best we can to remove/filter out all "but matchmaking!" posts. I'm frustrated about the bleh matchmaking too, trust me.
---
I did mention that in one of my comments as well. Also, the only people I'm "alienating," are the toxic players. As well they should be.
---
Empathy = god perk confirmed
---
Sorry for the poor experience man. Some people are toxic as hell for no reason
---
It doesnt matter if you lost or won you always should say gg
---
My brother law is at my house right now trying the game for the first time. He‚Äôs been matched against rank 4 led SWF teams that do gens in his face while he‚Äôs trying to figure out the controls.
---
Killers earn twice as much as survivors, so play killer and spend the points on survivors, or just level slower and have fun. Use a blood point offering every match, you will never run out, and try to use the brown ones last. BBQ and Chili is also #1 perk, if you can get it.
---
100% agree
---
Eyes is just servants from the shadows except better
---
I'm sorry that I want to play against people of the same skill level. Also calling me a crybaby makes you also a crybaby because you are crying about my post, just pointing that out.
---
No it is. Didnt you know as soon as you hook someone your camping if you don't leave the map.
---
Same goes for toxic survs also
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should have.
---
I‚Äôd learn to get over it honestly as 9/10 that is what the survivor wants you to do to tunnel then and camp them so other ppl can get gens it can be a good plan honestly. It‚Äôs fun to ignore trust me I hate it as killer or survivor been teabagged by a lot of dick ghostfaces but it‚Äôs best to ignore and move on
---
Because its your choice (and your friends) to play with someone considerably higher rank. Why should you be allowed to bully low rank killers?
---
Im the same way and ill tunnel if their absolute dickheads. Its up to you if you wanna be toxic back or not
---
How big is spirits sound radius without beads? A few times i went to hide thinking she was literally on top of me only for her to appear several meters out whilst heading elsewhere
---
Only thing that is really bad is the matchmaking.

---
‚ÄúHalf‚Äù as in everyone except the spirit and the nurse
---
Tired of getting flashlight spammed? Tired of your face getting smashed by every single pallet in the map? Tired of ggez baby killer in the chat?? Nurse is your girl, dude. Tired of instaheals? Plague. Immersed survivors? Ghost face. Assholes? Prayer beads spirit.
---
Ya you start at rank 20
---
Oh, right. Because we definitely needed more "increased" stealth with such a debuff side effect. Worst red addon ever.
---
I have a perspective from both sides. As a survivor, when and IF I decide to "teabag" (which is rare), it's usually if the killer has bad manners to start with (tunneling me or hitting me on the hook, that sorta thing) as a way to say "Ha, you're a jerk and you can't kill me now!". I don't instigate it just for the sake of being an ass, though.
---
If I see a killer tunnel/facecamp another survivor that was purposely being toxic like that for no reason, I feel that's kinda justified. It usually ends up screwing over the killer even worse than getting looped/teabagged but it's justified.
---
As the killer, I don't really care much about teabagging. Like...wow, you can press the CTRL button, good for you buddy! Want a sticker? Yeah I know they're teasing and taunting me, and it's frustrating since sometimes I genuinely am doing my best as a killer (though I'm not a very good one) but I just remind myself they're probably some Roblox playing kiddo on the other end trying to make themselves feel better about their mediocre life by trying to be 'pro gamer'. They don't know me and I sure as hell don't give a crap about them. If it bothers you, camp away!
---
I don't need to know where my team is if they're around me. You can see them if you have eyes and hear them if you have ears. Having awareness of the killers location helps you in a lot of ways and flashlight saves are just one. To assume Myers and GF can be easily countered is to imply they're trash tier which isn't true. You didn't mention the other examples. 
---
Anyways, we all have our own styles I guess but I'll take Empathy any day personally

---
I am just saying I have done it myself and most people don‚Äôt even run that perk. I get where you are coming from but I wouldn‚Äôt expect it to change as it‚Äôs not that game breaking
---
try playing Ghostface so you can teabag back. That's what I did and tbh it helped a lot
---
I‚Äôm talking about killer mains who ask for more respect at the toxic survivors who teabag you and call you trash for winning and/or losing but without tunnelling or camping.
---
I think the 3rd one is best, except you retain it for as long as the match goes, and slowly increases over time. If they win a chase progression is upped by 1%, while each second is .1%. You can only go as high as 15/16/18%
---
Because four gens got done.
---
That means he didn't even manage to occupy a *single player* for the first 80 seconds of the trial.
---
That was intended. Undetectable overrules all detection perks. It's in the name.
---
Why even play pig
---
If all it did was delete the game then you should still probably have all the data saved. My friend is pretty dumb and accidentally deleted DBD, after reinstalling all his stuff was still there. If all the data is gone you can contact PSN or BHVR and see if there‚Äôs something they can do.
---
I can't believe you just recommend prayer beads spirit ^/s ,but I do agree that killer choice is everything. However; it doesn't matter when no matter what you can't get better if can never catch a survivor because the 6000+ hours on you.
---
That's intended, gotta keep your eye out now.
---
But you're crying about his comment calling you crybaby because he is crying about your post...
---
Cool. Sounds cool, but it seems pretty strong though if you got toxic SWF teammates
---
Rule 3.
---
I mean if they ever fix matchmaking sure but as is you will still probably run into rank 20 killers regularly
---
I miss when using Mad Grit + Agitation, carrying a survivor and spamming m1 on Freddy used to make you go like double the speed of just walking around. So many fun meme games of getting one willing survivor on my shoulder and zooming around the map trying to catch the others.
---
It's so spoopy though!!! And there's a slide!!!
---
No, I'm just a small town boy, born and raised in south Detroit.
---
I found the Dwight main, he downvotes this
---
It might depend on ranking. I'm in purple ranks at the moment as a survivor and just yesterday I played against 3 clowns. I suppose it's a handful of luck/who you run into as well.
---
I have only received a single survivor one since the patch so perhaps you're right.
---
Same with me, I'm not discouraged though I've been having a bad experience with the demogorgon as I find alot of fun in him and potential but holy hell has it been a painfully week using him
---
Good lord. I was this delusional once, get help. You're not alone.
---
Yes. All maps have offerings! Most of them are somewhat uncommon though so they'll only show up once in a while in a bloodweb.
---
Step 1 : Invite them
---
Step 2 : There is no step 2.
---
I think he's considered low-tier right now, he is simply outclassed by killer's with stronger powers
---
No no no, dont spread misinformation, its 20 percent slower, you add 4 seconds to a normal heal and 8 seconds If you're SELF CARING
---
WHY should you be allowed to BULLY new players? WHY? Unless you are a sadist that gets off on other people's pain, I see zero reason to hate this change. You can still play with your friends, you just get to go up against Killers that have a chance.
---
Sounds like this is one of the rank 2s I killed at rank 13
---
That‚Äôs what I used to do every halloween when we were driving to our trick or treat area
---
Makes the swf 10x as mad.
---
KILL, MAIM, BURN! SALT, MILK, CHURN! FOR BUTTER!
---
I would say the biggest must have perk is ruin so you have more time to practice during games. For add ons basically use anything common while you're learning if anything (I used the metal spoon and white nit comb ones mostly). Avoid the add on Plaid Flannel that lets you see the blink landing area and anything that gives you more blinks so you don't get reliant on those. Good luck!!
---
He gave you misinformation, it only adds 4 seconds to a normal heal.
---
Sloppy butcher slows down healing by 20 percent or so
---
more accessible way to tell: you can't use emotes
---
Your movement is relative to the position of the camera, so if you're holding W your going to move in the direction of your camera, not your character. Again I could be wrong
---
you didn't make a point since Leather face as a one shot too and is far from being "OP"
---
Billy is affected by loops contrary to Nurse and Spirit which limit his potential.
---
I'm probably gonna do that next rank reset.

Hex memeless mode exists/ go to official forums if you want all discussion
---
stop giving survivors any ideas
---
I know it can be really upsetting sometimes when you try your best and other players just bully you cause you aren't as good as them.
---
Not everyone is this toxic but they are still there. Best way to deal with it is to keep a light-hearted attitude. Just have fun with it. You can't let assholes bother you, especially in a game so full of them lol.
---
If you are on PC you can turn off the chat by clicking the arrow to the right of it. This will keep it hidden until you click it again. It's a good idea to do this if you are getting a lot of toxic and rude comments. 
---
This is a very fun game and I'm glad you like it. I hope your experiences get better with it and you can fully enjoy it! Much luck to you, friend.

Context: Joined the game in free week and decided to purchase the game along with a killer I thought looked really interesting while it was on sale. Think this was around my 5th game as killer and was placed against a rank 3, 5 and 8. Safe to say I was absolutely smashed. Didn't even down a single survivor and was completely outplayed. 
---
This isn't the first game this has happened. I've been against ranked 10's in my other 4 games but this was the worst I had seen. So far my time as killer hasn't been an enjoyable experience. The survivors have been completely out my league and I've been completely helpless against them. Completely unfun and frustrating.  
---
Please fix matchmaking. I'm not learning anything from this experience.
---
What it is is that maps are separated into realms. Example: The Red Forest is the realm, but maps like Temple of Purgstion and Mother's Cabin are part of that realm. Do when you burn an offering to go to a "map", you really are burning a offering to go to a specific realm. Some realms like the farm, the forest, and the MacMillan estate, have multiple maps inside them. Some realms, like Haddonfield, The Underground Laboratory, and the game only have one associated map.
---
Mad because they got killed by the worst killer in the game
---
Is there 3 perks in the blood web after 40 now? or was that a mistake
---
&gt; The 3.2.0 patch introduced an issue that caused Survive With Friends group matchmaking to be skewed towards Rank 20, which is also fixed with this change.
---
This is the reason for the bizarre matchmaking since the update, and they‚Äôve mentioned it as a fix in the patch notes. 
---
Matchmaking is fine when the survivors are all solo queue, it‚Äôs SWF matches that are throwing it off because of this bug.
---
This might very well be the correct answer.
---
Dem jukes
---
Friend: they got the actors to voice them!
---
Me:Heh... Okay...
---
What are you in high school?
---
(I sped up and skipped most of the time it took me to set up the single light on the gen, That's why it's that far despite being on it for like 3 seconds)
---
So wait it is 4 seconds for regular heal and 8 for self care? Now you're confusing me. Also 4 is 25% of 16
---
He's right, I definitely meant to swing at the rock
---
Hahahahah it's ok
---
Don‚Äôt think there is much to be done besides try your best.
---
I‚Äôve been playing against rank 1 survivors a lot, it‚Äôs rather tough (killer main, no idea what a rank 1 killer looks like besides myself and what I do as killer)
---
Yeah. I noticed that.
---
really ? didn‚Äôt know thanks for the heads up !
---
I'm 'one of those who only' then accused me of just insta leaving games lol
---
That's because Leatherface's one shot isnt also an ability that traverses the entire map
---
Also, how is Spirit not affected by loops? Just because it requires more of a mind game than it does for some of the other killers doesnt mean shes unaffected by looping
---
Get rid of the extra charge time on his range add ons would be nice
---
I don't agree but am just happy when I find out people know these movies exist.
---
Honestly,  I wish they did the thing that some other games do (can't remember the specific game that did this) I wish they made the person with the best connection to everyone else host, instead of just killer. (This is, if they were to completely scrap dedicated servers) Also, I feel as if the killer was the one lagging then survivors would benefit off of lag "the most" as well.  But maybe I misread what you said, idk.
---
Huh... Idk I've actually gotten less ps4 messages in the last few weeks then when I first started playing, which was right after the legion dlc. Maybe people were just salty cuz of that. Lol.
---
It's a lot better now since the change but I main Freddy so I can't see shit. I rely on scratch marks and common sense to chase through corn. Lol
---
I think the chained Demogorgon is the Russian one
---
Exactly what I think
---
So all SWF groups will abandon the game because they can't bully r20 Killers?!
---
Nvm you are correct, Killers bad, SWF must win all game.
---
Hey at least you‚Äôre honest. Can‚Äôt hate on that! Seriously I‚Äôve met so many people who have no idea rob zombie makes awesome movies or who he is in general lol.
---
What you said is exactly the opposite. The scenario they were fixing is when 3 rank 1s and a rank 20 get matched against a rank 15 killer who just gets bullied by the rank 1s. Now the question is what happens when a rank 1 and three rank 20s group up? Will they match against a rank 5?
---
&gt;Fixed an issue with the pigs stun noise
---
Finally i got some prestieging to do
---
i think you should read more actually and start to think of you as the actual shit head to try to improve instead of rejecting what others are explaining to you.
---
Gains and loses, yes. 
---
As for "benefits from", bear in mind that the attack recovery in Feral Frenzy is 1s - the same duration as a *whiffed* M1. If you hit the same person twice then you get kicked out of Feral Frenzy, so whether or not it "benefits" from the perk is basically the difference between 1s and 0.6s *unnecessary additional time* to go along with your 4s fatigue. 
---
Personally I'd just drop out of Feral Frenzy manually.
---
I‚Äôm so sad
---
Infectious fright, BBQ Billy
---
I like empathy or even bond
---
the hotfix is supposed to be coming tomorrow, hopefully they have their shit figured out
---
If you play serious, comms let yoy destroy most Killers.
---
Or we were just playing with friends, that rarely played dbd, and that is why they are grey ranks and we are near red. So what, because of the shit matchmaking we should deny the opportunity to play toghther? You are making an aswfuly not at all valid arguments, as if all swf = are abusers. In that regard, you can say that all killers are = cry babies. And i am a killer main.
---
I got my first one yesterday, I was well chuffed
---
I feel like play time and total killer/survivor levels and prestiges should weigh more than ranking since a lot of rank 1s with 1000+ hours played can pretty easily derank to get easier matchups.
---
Everytime I play Ghostface people knock me out of it even when I'm leaning behind cover and they're at a great distance. It's really pissing me off and i'm getting discouraged from playing him
---
Took the midnight train going anywhere?
---
1000% nobody ever wants to backpack me :(
---
Still waiting on a fix to killer emblem... being effective reduces your emblem scores.
---
You outplayed them obviously
---
Keep the cap just remove the categories. Sometimes people wanna do gens and get done, others want to run around and boop the snoot.
---
What I was talking about was one time I played a marathon with some guys, at the time I hadn't played with a 4-stack ever. You could see the killers perks then, now you cannot. I was trying to emphasize how much of an advantage we had over the killer that time, an enormous contrast to what im used to as a solo survivor. It's been a while since I last played SWF.
---
Really hope the devs see this.  I'm also stuck on just killer dailies and they always get "replaced" with the same killer rituals.
---
I'm terrified of Plague and Ghostface
---
Tough call, both are great for playing altruistic. Empathy will be more consistent than Aftercare, but Aftercare is amazing when it works. One of my favorite support builds is Aftercare + Autodidact. Autodidact is also inconsistent but when it works it‚Äôs basically a permanent We‚Äôll Make It. Since Aftercare also shows your aura to others, people will be able to search you out when they need healing so you don‚Äôt need to be chasing people down all over the map. It‚Äôs also great for Endgame if people don‚Äôt know where the gates are. 
---
If you‚Äôre talking strictly unhooks, empathy is probably better. But I think Aftercare is underrated as hell and can do things that empathy can‚Äôt.
---
Undetecetable was in the game long before they made it a visual sign. And it works as intended. As it should, including all perks on detection. If your spine chill could work with undetecatable, it would certainly be actually pretty much detectable.
---
The numbers just arent worth it  imo.
---
I mean it starts to be decent at like 5 stacks. At that pojnt the Killer is very close to sacrificing his first survivors so the killer either won the game or most gens are already done.
---
Hahahaha √§lskart!
---
So you‚Äôre saying the devs patch notes are wrong?
---
Depends how you play him, I find stalking around the edges of the map and making your way in slowly helps but I use my shroud more to give the survivors a fright on the odd chance they are trying to knock me out and it doesn't work or I don't have time to mark them
---
BP or emblem? They are different and I'm assuming BP since its survival, mine are fine but I'm on PC so that might be a PS4 issue.
---
1. None of what you just typed made any sense. You should probably be the one reading more so you know how to type proper sentences. 
---
2. Your point of "instead of rejecting what others explain to you" makes you sound like a childish twat that thinks everyone should change their opinion solely because you have a different one
---
3. You're the one calling others shitheads now, so feel free to fuck yourself if you're going to just go with insults when someone says they're done with a discussion.
---
Grow the fuck up. Good day
---
I never said it wasn‚Äôt. I said it‚Äôs unfun to play against
---
Uhh... do they even remotely play their game?? It's a shitshow both ways....you come in as a rank 19 killer with what, 2 perks? and you've got rank 10-1 survivors with full perks double flashlights insta kits etc. and vice versa. Fun times for the whole family!
---
I'm rank 14 haha
---
Trust me you wouldn't want to get the map. It's absolutely TRASH
---
Kindred says it trumps all killer stealth abilities, but that hasn't been true since Micheal came out. I'm 95% that Undetectable is immune to Spine Chill, even if it doesn't say it.
---
Yeah that's the big part of it for me, we can compare him to his actor in the show and it ain't this.
---
#B R O T H E R   I AM PINNED HERE
---
Because it adds a sense of randomness and saltiness to my games instead of just genrushing the killer to Oblivion
---
Sil from species just kill people because of her sexual needs.
---
Valak, I mean she is just a demon.
---
Maybe a Bathory inspired killer, she kills young women to keep her beauty.
---
Not clear enough, like many of their patch notes. Nothing new really. But it works as intended, chief.
---
Oh no I‚Äôm just defending what I‚Äôve heard
---
If you only have Nurse, Whispers (tracking), Sloppy Butcher (anti-healing, slows their healing and thus slows the game), Thanatophobia (not great but pairs OK with Sloppy, slows the game), and A Nurse's Calling (anyone healing nearby will show up bright red, tracking). If you have better tracking perks (Barbecue &amp; Chilli) or slowdown perks (Ruin) then slot those in after Whispers. **Do not use Whispers below T3** - it'll be worthless for tracking. If you don't have it at T3, use Bitter Murmur instead.
---
As you get better with Nurse, your perks will become increasingly irrelevant - a good Nurse doesn't need slowdown perks, and there's really nowhere to hide from her (although I'd always take Barbecue &amp; Chilli because muh Bloodpoints).
---
I personally would not use add-ons while learning the Nurse. The method I used was to act as if I only had one Blink - that way, my chain Blink was just a "safety" for when I misjudged. Her first Blink has a far longer range than her additional Blinks, so it's important to get that first Blink down pat.
---
You'll get stomped the first few games, and if you're ever sent to L√©ry's or Hawkins, but the moment you master her initial Blink will be the moment everything turns around. I'm not sure anyone sticks with Nurse in the long run - short games don't pay good Bloodpoints, and you may not find her quite as exciting to use as the other killers.
---
Thank you sir. You are a gentleman and a scholar.

I played against a 4-man with one rank 15 and *three* ranks 2s last night. My killer rank is currently 14 because I have not been playing much recently. Needless to say, I am happy for this change.
---
I always thought Steve sounded like Filthy Frank screaming when hooked
---
My strategy: take the game less seriously and you stop caring. Obviously won‚Äôt apply to everyone but it works for me. I just play to have fun, and don‚Äôt really expect to win every game or do well in general
---
sometimes having a bunch of people all shouting over each other is too much. thats the main reason . plus it kind of takes away the immersion of the game. (i dont mean hiding in a locker somewhere on the map) I like the suspense of not knowing everything thats going on during the match
---
Idk what you're talking about, that's who is in the photo. Franku in all his glory.
---
Definitely still needs work. Baby steps though. Right now its a niche perk. Another step or two and it'll be good.
---
it actually really is helpful for BOTH sides knowing what a killer and survivor is running. Once you have decent knowledge of both killer and survivor you can typically discern 2-4 of the perks they're running rather quickly and play around them.
---
What‚Äôs killing michael?
---
Seeing this so close to a bloodpoint event makes me cry
---
I‚Äôve been playing for years and I will tell you I‚Äôve been placed against newbie killers literally every match. I feel terrible after the game is over ease then I realize that I was bullying a newb...but yes this game has a very toxic community
---
Ooooh well that's news to me, thanks for letting me know!
---
The only time you can really say Ez is if you are going up against an ebony mori, or red rank non-m1 killer with noed. That is, if you are not in a swf.
---
Billy on new map sucks ass
---
It actually helped me since I was about to prestige my bill, so after that match, I was able to get my balenced back after prestige, and am on my way to remaking my perk set up : )
---
Hey, that‚Äôs good enough for me
---
The fact that you can only activate it if you get the heal alone with no help is ridiculous and needs changing for sure.
---
The Game is both sided, honestly.
---
Survivors have a ton of good loops and pallets, and the map can be complete hell for inexperienced killers, or Killers that require an open space to function (Hillbilly). Add to that that the Killer can be stuck on the wrong floor without a way down and you can safely get gens done on the map as well.
---
Killers though? Killers have a bunch of good totem spawns, their TR is harder to detect (especially with M&amp;A), there is limited sight for Stealth Killers to abuse, there's a handful of one door rooms until the maps open up so it's easy to trap Survivors in them for a free hit, and a handful of Killers (Nurse, Doctor, Legion) just break the map wide open.
---
in that instance you won't be punished and depip if you actually win that encounter. That isn't arguing against any points I made.
---
Adding on to this idea - Surge gives no extra bonus regression on activation, but rather makes generators regress *faster*, so survivors already working on gens would be fine, but any gen with progress on it already and not being checked on would go down more quickly, giving it a unique method of slowing gens to avoid it being too similar to pop.
---
I mean arguably I find somebody willing to hurt somebody else freely and repetitively, evil. Ain't nobody getting in fights constantly out of self defense, Buttttt that doesnt matter because it's DBD and not that serious lol
---
This....does put a smile on my face
---
Same. I‚Äôm going to try to get Mikes bloody mask
---
Doesn‚Äôt mean all 4 of the players didn‚Äôt finesse the killer individually. Tbh at this point I couldn‚Äôt care, just making a point. I don‚Äôt think a killer deserves to get 4 genes instantly just because they haven‚Äôt played well or are struggling,
---
I rarely get that map which sucks because I want to get the achievement for doing the gen in the isolation room. The map offering has also been scarce for me. I leveled Nancy to 50 and it only appeared for me once. Steve is level 25 and it hasn‚Äôt appeared on his bloodweb at all yet.
---
God, I'm currently round this area, and the variance in games is ASTOUNDING. 
---
As a survivor, you get campers (sometimes face campers), HARD tunnelers, laggy killers, killers that slug, killers that seem WAY too good for their rank, killers that seem like it's their first game, and ones where it's actually a decent game.
---
Honestly, the tunnelers, laggy killers, and decent games killers are the most common around my rank, the rest are honestly pretty rare. 
---
As for killer, you get people blatantly farming right in front of you (with no BT), games where 5 gens are seemingly done immediately, games where 0 gens get done in 5 minutes, survivors who are WAY too good for their rank, survivors who you actually feel BAD hooking, and of course, the survivors who call you a horrible tunneler, even when you actively try to avoid specific players.
---
It's literally a crapshoot over what quality of games you're gonna have. Some days it's GREAT and other days just gives me a headache.
---
What about grandpa bill??
---
I believe so
---
Oh I had him go through that, but you forget all those things once you start playing people. The bots are also not on comms and don‚Äôt know how to juke or loop.
---
He's ugly.
---
"Lets get high"
---
come on killers, if someone offers the bloody party streamers let everybody join the fun and don't tunnel
---
Eh, you just hold M1 as survivor.
---
theres a good youtube guide on omg im blurry's channel, its mainly a breakdown of the addons/perk uses but theres some decent gameplay tips too
---
Look at [the scoring events page](https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Bloodpoints) on the wiki, and try and do as many of them as possible.
---
If you have Bubba, prioritise him for Barbecue &amp; Chilli. Once you unlock this teachable you can then grind up your favourite killer(s) until they have it themselves. Full stacks of this perk will add 100% Bloodpoints post game, which is a good thing.
---
If you have David then you can do the same stunt with We're Gonna Live Forever. It's a bit flakier to trigger than Barbecue &amp; Chilli, but bonus Bloodpoints are bonus Bloodpoints.

Bear in mind that if you're a bad killer then you may well end up earning less than you could as a decent survivor. The killer is there for the entire match - a survivor is only there as long as they have to be. Sweating out a whole killer game for 15k will be detrimental if you could do two 10k survivor games in the same timeframe.
---
Pick the role you do best at, and prioritise that. Grind them for their Bloodpoint perks and then grind them some more so that your "preferred" character gets the teachable unlocked. Don't be tempted to splash your Bloodpoints on multiple characters - you could easily end up with a bunch of mediocre ones rather than a few solid farmers.
---
Doesn't matter what rank he's facing nobody is gonna succeed at killer if they don't have an understanding of the game as a whole first
---
How many hours is enough for you? You said you have about 200, isn't that enough? I have 300 and I probably have more game knowledge (and play better) than someone with 1k hours that just play mindless of what is happening... That being said someone with 10 hours can play better than me, they might have watched a bunch of videos previously, they might just learn faster than me, they might be tryhards or whatever. Play time doesn't make anyone good or bad and rank is mostly tied to play time.

---
This is why I use these addons almost every game.
---
It's also why I like going up against Twitch streamers; I can always relive my victories and/or look back and contemplate possible mistakes.
---
Oh God, this was in the PTB and it wasn't fixed?
---
I can confirm as a baby Dwight running Ds and Head On
---
matchmaking is hopefully getting fixed tomorrow. im not holding my breath really, but theres a bloodhunt coming up so between that and the new bloodweb at least it will get easier to get all the perks.
---
My only suggestion is to try all the killers and find a few that you like. I did the same thing originally, only played freddy until i was rank 10 and then got bodied every round.
---
Spine chill is my jam at the moment because of the stealth killers. I did not know that only one box will save and it's random. Thanks for the help
---
Yeah I tried it with bitter murmer for a while, but it just doesn't happen enough when you're close to be a viable combo. I was so excited to run it when I first saw the cruel confinement perk but I'm not sure of a good build right now with it.
---
I have to take into consideration the fact that I lost my game for about a month and I got it back maybe three weeks ago, so you could say I play like I probably have about 80-100 hours because I lost so much gameplay knowledge over the period I didn't have my game.
---
When you hit them they can run through you so bodyblocking only gets you that easy first hit. You have to really outplay survivors using your power in chases at optimal times otherwise it's really difficult to get that second hit at all.
---
Yes its in BP, i assume its a killer leaving at the end of a match so it doesnt give me the bp even tho i escaped?
---
That happened to me a few days ago and it left me utterly confused. Glad to hear I wasn't imagining things
---
I‚Äôm beyond baffled at how this is possible.
---
True but that's because the game wasn't really designed with swf in mind in the beginning. You were never supposed to have any communication besides the two emotes you're given. Then again, its essential for some people. I know I wouldn't have started playing so much if it wasn't for swf. Not because we were steam rolling people, it's just that this is a very fun game to play with friends. But how do you balance that so it's still fun for people like us, but isn't as strong for the rank 1 super sweats?
---
Impossible! I'm the best player ever! I never make mistakes and I always have perfect pressure on the survivors! If I lose it's the game's fault! I'm not bad I swear!
---
Low rank survivor gets demolished with a average killer. And to be frank,low skill killers can work better if they need less skill  and teams are more disoriented.  But in high ranks is the exact opposite for the majority of killers sucks,as quickly ending chases rules.It is hard to balance about high ranks without fucking the low ranks.
---
I see where you‚Äôre coming from bruh. I just wish I could see something other than spirit and nurse nowadays. It‚Äôs sad I find it an honor to go against an insta saw in high ranks kek.
---
Stando powah
---
Thank you for this fantastic advice. I didn‚Äôt know what that was until your enlightening comment.
---
I am you nonce, im Level 40 and no Hawkin‚Äôs offerings have shown up
---
I'm the opposite, most of the last few years playing I've had considerably more killer than survivor dailies. I'm sure it's balanced that way intentionally
---
Low tier killer main spotted
---
I don‚Äôt want to deal with internet randos. Half the time they are either kids, toxic people or people with the fan on in their room. I would rather immerrsssseee. Just because they are partying up does not mean they are good by default. I only SWF with my wife and our kid. Decline all other invites.
---
Thanks for the sauce, worth a look
---
I almost want them nerfed solely for the fact that people would play other shit and it would make the game interesting again
---
Yep
---
Y'all remember that time Pharaoh just went in on Weevil so badly somebody had to step in to stop him?
---
That's how it feels to fight a coordinated SWF
---
Until it breaks on the next patch
---
They really haven't said anything about it to my knowledge. I'll check it after midnight EST tonight
---
I THINK grabbing onky works on vaults when they are wounded, otherwise totem cleansing, gen repair, hook saving and using a locker can be interupted with a grab. The most important thing is to be up against them and tap attack, no lunge, or it wont work.
---
Its almost worth letting them vault when you know they will so you can get the grab as a grab or catch is 600 brutality points.
---
Being the killer is a lot more fun when you show no mercy. Don't be a dick as far as bm-ing survivors, but I've learned that a lot of them are ungrateful or just take things the wrong way. There's no pleasing some people.
---
Looked calculated to me. You didn't teabag so I'm only giving you an 8/10 for that toxic display of skill.
---
I don't play killer, but I'm happy for y'all
---
Nah I prefer honesty thanks
---
Sorry I'm on a few hours of sleep lol I meant to say, "closer to rank 20 by a long shot"
---
And I feel like you have to consider it from both perspectives. Current issue is one low rank for some reason makes you get low rank killers when everyone else is rank 1. That's unfair. However, how is it fun or fair if an old player gets friends to play the game and they're all brand new, but they're still getting matched with killers close to rank 1? I wouldn't say so.
---
I feel like the game should weigh matches in favor of the rank 1 players, but not solely based off their rank. Or, maybe even better would be to just have a set max rank difference between your highest rank SWF and the killer. If you have a rank 1, the absolute lowest rank you can queue against is let's say rank 10 for example.
---
So what your saying is kill everyone always?
---
I'm a simple man.  I see Power Rangers.  I see Zedd.  I see Rita.  I give you an upvote.
---
the 3 other surviors DCd.  Killer eventually finds and hooks me and then says GG. SMFH
---
Happy cake day, fellow gamer :)
---
"GGWP"
---
More like....
---
***Belongs in my ass***
---
I barely play killer but when I do I get matched with a rank 1 and his rank 10 friend and it's really annoying.
---
I've had ideas for a chapter based on a dude with split personality disorder where the survivor and killer are the same person, just when there's a different personality in control
---
That was fucking bm
---
Nurse isn't easy at all to play. And even if she was, spirit is still way easier lol. Nurse takes way more than a few games to master. Spirit is an auto win with way less effort.
---
"I tHiNk We'Re DoInG a GrEaT jOb So FaR"
---
&gt;This sub should be a platform to celebrate the game and our success' when playing, not a place to moan and complain
---
"Ironic"
---
it's proper sportsmanship. 
---
I never though I'd personally at this considering I don't like esports and they're community, but notice how after every match, win or lose, both players nod and shake hands?
---
You can get absolutely decimated and still recognize that the game was good
---
I gotcha, it‚Äôs confusing because ‚Äúhigh rank‚Äù is technically a low number (1) and ‚Äúlow rank‚Äù is a high number (20) so sometimes it‚Äôs hard to tell. I really think they need to revamp how ranks are earned, like you earn more point against a higher rank opponent, and less points against a lower ranked one.
---
Edit: even just a straight up ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt earn a pip against someone 10 ranks lower than you‚Äù and a bonus multiplier when you face an opponent 10 ranks higher.
---
Since most third party releases aren‚Äôt at midnight expect it around 12-3 PM EST
---
&gt; Adjusted the matchmaking logic so that Survive With Friends groups are matched using the highest rank of all players in the group (instead of the average). 
---
Excellent! It sucked playing low rank killers just because we had 1 person with a low rank in our group.
---
Any news on why sometimes I don't get bloodpoints after a game if the killer disconnects? And that I lose my item, addons and offering also?
---
It's fine, just a little confusing at first. I've gotten it more as killer than survivor but ive gotten plenty of 4ks. Had my share of teams escape too. Seems ok to me
---
The first part needs fixing IMO. It needs to be easier to prime. 
---
First you actually need to *completely* heal a survivor. So you actually need to wait until someone is downed and rescued probably, AND he cannot heal himself or anyone else can¬¥t help.
---
THEN you need to be unhooked.
---
And ONLY THEN will Second Wind activate...and that still requires you to survive a 30 second chase, very likely.
---
Meanwhile Nancy can just activate IS by doing a totem in the first minute of the game, and then heal anytime she wants. 
---
Yeah yeah, she can be countered by anti-locker perks/anti-totem perks, she doesn¬¥t have the flexibility of "automatic" heal whatever you are doing and needs to sit in a locker for like 8 seconds...but still, it¬¥s undeniable that it¬¥s a lot more convenient...and you will be doing totems anyway.
---
If they make Second Wind easier to prime, it can actually be a good perk.
---
He best be hittin David next
---
Better than getting average like before and forcing baby killers to go against red ranks. Survivors can get carried, a killer can‚Äôt.
---
It really is just a case of get good. The more you mind game it the better you'll get at catching survivors in it
---
you shouldnt care much about the survivors since they arent that different - killers on the other side are very different. if you think doc will be fun for you - go for it mate
---
The majority of the pallets aren't even remotely loopable...
---
Yeah something happened over last week maybe the update but as a yellow rank I was in a match against all reds!! 
---
Maybe this is all a matchmaking issue they are apparently patching
---
You mean his childish gibberish? Yea. That's nightmare fuel. I like to joke that he is throwing a little tantrum to make it less scary.
---
Uh no? Not even close. Killers have a major advantage at rank 20 over rank 20 survivors. I‚Äôm not saying red ranks should face rank 20s at all but, with that being said all this is gonna do is completely destroy the survivor side and make them all move to killer making more queue time
---
thats sweet, think what you want bud
---
Don't have the hag sadly
---
I imagine people will spam the subreddit with complaints of performance. Or no one cares because it won't sell much.
---
The thing is , when a low rank killer plays , there‚Äôll be at least a 5-1 rank survivor who‚Äôll bully the killer and that isn‚Äôt fair for the killer
---
Survivor team &gt; killer &gt; solo survivor.
---
Its way to easy to bully a killer as a team tbh. The longer a game goes on should reward the killer and punish survivors. A perkless survivor is way more likely to have success than a perkless killer. Im not saying im the greatest player in the world I play mostly survivor nowadays and the game seems very survivor sided.
---
I fear no man. But that thing...
---
**it scares me.**
---
I'm trying to have a game that doesn't freeze at random points, no time to notice
---
A friend and I played as babysitters for baby dweets and jaeks because of the recent matchmaking issues. We'd always try our best to save them, even if it cost us our lives.
---
Tbh I feel like this better explained via video, but as killer it can be hard to mind game that building (the killer shack). 
---
The only way to really hit the survivor is to catch up to them and this can only be done by following right behind them (which will also waste a lot of your time too).
---
If you try to hit with a hatch up and you miss, you just end up putting more distance between you and the survivor and prolonging the chase. 
---
Honestly I‚Äôd just leave the chase if the survivor is too good.
---
I feel like I'm the only Legion player now and days. I don't know why but I like him. My first p3 killer. (I've only been to purple ranks, so I don't know how red ranks are)
---
Same
---
Wow I have a trip from 26-29, but wont be back home until the 30th. This is all a ruse against me. smh.
---
The killer shack is a good loop for survivors they are a lot harder to catch there. It is best if you can force them to drop the pallet then break it because the shack becomes way less safe. 
---
Overall I would say don‚Äôt respect pallets generally. Make them use them early on if you can then break them and leave them with fewer places to loop you later on.
---
They get annihilated by red rank killers, I used to be the one who hosted our group but they'd just get absolutely wrecked, every single match. Like 0% escape rate, less than 5k points every match level of wrecked.
---
Ah yes. I am ready to play killer.
---
Unfortunately theyre the only killers that are harder to bully really. Blame the bullys for forcing the killer picks
---
Can't wait for:
---
 "Pig movement speed reduced to 105%"
---
 "Pig movement speed while crouched reduced to 45%"
---
 "Pig crouching doesn't hide the red stain anymore"
---
 "Pig crouching doesn't surpress the terror radius anymore"
---
 "Pig ambush attack doesn't put a survivor into the injury state, only to the deep wound state"
---
 "Pig traps now takes 15 minutes to activate and the time to take it off is reduced to 0.5 seconds"
---
 "Pig mori has been disabled"
---
 "Pig cosmetics have been taken off the game"
---
 "Pig has oficially been taken off the game"
---
honestly sounds like steve screaming in stranger things imo
---
1.: Teabag other survivors as a greeting.
---
1a.(optional): nod.
---
2. Show off moonwalk skills.
---
3. Accept challenge to moonwalk to nearest Gen.
---
4. Teabag and nod at gen. 
---
4a.(optional): Point at.
---
5. Repair
---
Or it will encourage players to play within their own ranks. Maybe the exposure to better killers will help newer survivors learn quicker, especially if they play with a more experienced player who can give them good advice. We‚Äôll just have to see.
---
You're right. There's about to be a HUGE influx of new complaints/complainers. Batten down the hatches!!
---
Since you're talking about killers, I STRONGLY recommend picking up Leatherface. He might not be the best killer, but he has hands-down three of the best killer perks. Strongly recommended
---
"Disconnection Penalty  
---
In an attempt to discourage leavers, Behavior will lock players who purposefully disconnect out of matchmaking for a certain time. The duration of this ban varies depending on how many times a player has disconnected.
---
‚ÄúThis new system will feature a growing ‚Äúlock-out‚Äù timer for each time a player disconnects from a match, preventing them from re-queuing until their timer expires.‚Äù
---
Additionally, if one player of a Survive With Friends group is locked out, the rest of the team will have to wait until their ban expires. The length of the timer gradually decreases as long as the player doesn‚Äôt disconnect from additional matches."
---
Source - https://appuals.com/dead-by-daylight-will-soon-punish-players-who-disconnect-during-matches/
---
From what I've read, they haven't indicated the bans will lead to a perma ban.
---
Chad Ace vs the Virgin Wraith
---
Doesn't sound anything like it to me, to each their own though.
---
Depends if your console or PC
---
It was supposed to be Pizza Dweet but I see where you‚Äôre coming from
---
Devs are not allowed to decapitate survivors in the game.
---
Both, I absolutely hate the layout and generator placements, pallets being unsafe making it a note fest with no mind games and balanced landing being needed to not get hit. That map looks great but dear Gosh I hate it
---
In certain situations I'll let someone leave. If the other 3 survivors dc at the beginning or if I notice that a survivor is being targeted by the other survivors. Like deliberately sandbagging them or trapping them in an area with no exit. 
---
But if it's a normal game I try to kill everybody.
---
ah... Is that to point out that it should be "survivor" instead of "survival"?
---
It would be fun to have that mode though wouldn't it? A Minecraft Chapter: With new map, the nether. Everyone have to survive running killer around on the fortress and looting chest to find food. hmm?
---
I have BBQ already. And I don't care about Franklin's.
---
How many Mori's though
---
Oh got it
---
A lot of the more casual players have probably left to do other things by that time. Leaving the higher ranks still playing
---
Welcome to Pig life
---
Yea I know but I mean Hag still gets to consume some guts while the demogorgon just nibbles the skull like why not make it tear the flesh off the skull that'd atleast make it seems like he's eating them
---
Do your totems not get destroyed? I use Ruin and by mid-game I usually already have it deactivated because everyone is going for totems especially with Inner Strength now.
---
yeah, fair enough
---
Easy to use doesn‚Äôt mean better. The skill ceiling for nurse is vastly higher than Spirit‚Äôs
---
Well I mean it's just DBD on the switch nothing more nothing less it doesn't add anything really
---
Pretty sure the scroll of secrets only keeps secrets. The scroll of truth tells the truth.
---
But in all seriousness, you're flat out wrong.
---
Yeah I kinda agree with some of that. I feel a slight rework be in order for Hawkins but I like it simply because it's something new. I'm used to the gen placements now.
---
Ah, that's going to be a splendid dumpster fire.
---
The game barely functions on current gen consoles right now.
---
Learning to hit great skill checks is a very valuable skill, but you meed to read your team, so many teammates will either fuck the skillchecks or not do gens until they find ruin, if they are searching you may as well help because fuck all is getting done until you get them back on gens.
---
Don't forget Ash, he's loud as fuck and I'm an Ash main!
---
I guess what I'm trying to get at is people learn the game at different speeds and I'm a slow learner and a quick regresser.
---
Decisive Strike, when you are unhooked it becomes active for 40/50/60 seconds, if you are picked up by the Killer in that time (from being downed, grabbed from a locker, etc) you receive a skill check. If you land the skill check, the killer drops you and is stunned for 5 seconds. It is only usable once per match. Very popular survivor perk as it‚Äôs very strong and discourages killers from chasing the same target.
---
If you don‚Äôt run ruin they tend not to even look for other totems.
---
This is a great shout
---
I would like a bundle of new maps in general. A Leatherface one would be on my top list then Evil Dead and Ghostface.
---
Probs a stealth killer, stealth killers get absolutely shit Chaser scores unless you force chases
---
Also if you can hit the skillchecks its worth working with a second, even if they cant, 1 person on a gen takes 88 or something seconds, 2 people is 44.
---
I personally think she's the only one in need of a nerf..
---
Ah I see. Well I‚Äôm that case it‚Äôs virgin wraith vs super sayan dweet :0
---
&gt;racism is good you fucktard
---
Lmao xd
---
Myers with extended tier 3 and increased stalk efficiency.
---
So if I'm a rank 6 for example, and I get some friends to buy the game, and they'll all be ranks 20, that means that it's going to find us a rank ~10 killer? I'm not so sure this is the best solution
---
Flu shot season awareness cosmetic
---
Monitor and Abuse was the only stealth related perk i had on.
---
Because the pig is a fat joke, lots of m1 perks dont work with her mainly for the fact that shes the single most powerful killer in the game so the devs nerf her at every chance they get to keep the game playable.
---
Wait... noone thinks NOED is good, is a situational perk that gives you the ability to instadown once all generators are done. And guess what, you should want to finish the game b4 that point, its most of the time a waste of a slot if the killer is good, and can be shutted down b4 it even gets to be used.
---
It has his uses sure, but you are better with running some game slowdown perks and finish the game b4 they finish the generators and manage to escape.
---
If u want a perk that allows some late game shenanigans, rancor is a better options since the location reveal gives the perk a bit more use during all the game, and u can just instadown and kill ur obcession once the generators power up
---
Just because you don't win doesn't mean it wasn't a good game
---
This was awesome dude! Keep it up
---
*laughs in Xbox one X and no lag*
---
Well the current (from tomorrow) scenario is a rank 6 killer. And id say a rank 6 with 3 rank 20s should find a rank 14ish killer. A rank 6 with 1 rank 20 would be a rank 10
---
*ITS FUCKING RAW*
---
Correct. But if we‚Äôve got a slugging Nurse on our hands and everyone‚Äôs downed within three minutes, no. That absolutely wasn‚Äôt a good game and I‚Äôm not going to pretend it was, to appease anyone. No. Sorry.
---
Makes sense, if you‚Äôre playing Myers semi-Stealthily it‚Äôs easy to down survivors before the game detects that a chase has begun, meaning, even though you were engaging the survivors, there technically weren‚Äôt very many chases
---
And I 100% agree. They can have a bit of creative freedom even when it comes to Jack. Like you said, they can keep his name and general presumed appearance that we all know (the ominous Victorian Englishman with a top-hat) and that's all.
---
I had exactly the same bug on PC. This looks so cool, much better than default "brown swamp" filter.
---
Matchmaking is sort of fucked rn, wait until tomorrow's hotfix.
---
Ds is amazing wtf? It has a fat 5 second stun time rather than 3.
---
Btw lunges have been in the game since release, so has lunging around corners.
---
To me it depends on the people in my swf. 
---
There‚Äôs those that just want to play games and hang out, have a good time. There‚Äôs those that are already decent at playing solo but like playing with others and then there‚Äôs people who take it too seriously and start barking orders like a failed drill instructor... in these cases I rather play alone than to deal with that.
---
Not to name drop but when I watch Monto play swf with others they seem really put fun as a priority. 
---
TLDR: swf is not always fun cause angry gamers.
---
Don't even joke about that.
---
Git gud?
---
It was only a one time thing for me, this was my first time seeing it
---
There's a bug currently regarding matchmaking that should be fixed with the drop of the patch tomorrow, other than that, Matchmaking is shit no matter what, but it's been especially shit recently
---
That an additional system they're adding on top of the current one. They actually do already ban players who dc prolifically in the current system. That new system is intended to further discourage it. Either way i'm just glad something is being done about it, so tired of having my matches ruined due to 1 bad apple.
---
Should be the same as her TR, which is 24m. It's just pretty loud.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not a fun map to go to in most people‚Äôs eyes. Safe loops are boring for killers, being forced to heal after hooks because stealth killers can be a pain on solos. It‚Äôs just not a fun map compared to basically every other map imho
---
I love my switch. I cant be bothered to regrind everything I have on ps4. I already did it once going from PC to ps4.
---
The same reason why a killer might tunnel a survivor with a key because it can cost them the game.
---
Could have some potential with myers I think
---
It‚Äôs an inferior device so no one that has PCs or Consoles really cares. Also there‚Äôs not switch people in this Reddit yet to express their hype for it.
---
If they're trying to be toxic and ruin the game for others then don't say anything,but if they're just not playing the way you like you should still say gg
---
*Ah another repost. I see.*
---
Got the game now. Searching for a match. I got my popcorn ready. Game shows error code when trying to connect to servers because they obviously aren't up yet.
---
Exactly. We‚Äôre in agreement here, then
---
If your avatar is dbd based.. you are rank 10 max..
---
I never get that to happen so it‚Äôs a small minority or you guys just complain to much
---
Also, ( . Y . )
---
This is outrageous, this is unfair, how can I be a SWF and not stomp baby killers?
---
Cleanse in areas with no generators, don't cleanse before unhooking, don't group up, dont cleanse until fully broken.
---
I noticed that too Idk why though because he's pretty good and has a funny laugh.
---
Most of the time I try to look down/up/away I still get blinded so I just prefer using the perk. Personal preference I guess.
---
It was good for somebody lol
---
Got physical copy now. Searching for a match.........
---
I guess we are :)
---
*Saving that for future research later...*
---
Yeah, Inner Strength is def the better of the 2 perks.
---
It's why I saved up and dumped a million BP into Nancy right when the DLC dropped. So I could get it unlocked and then just play Steve with a better healing perk.
---
It won‚Äôt make them learn quicker, it will literally do the opposite because the complete imbalance with the p3 ghostface against a rank 20 lvl 1 David. Seems totally fair
---
I see this as an absolute win
---
Fingers crossed we get Robert Englund Freddy
---
I vomit on the pallet immediately and force them to use it.
---
Funny thing is every country on the surface of this planet has better internet then the unites states because of corporate greed!
---
I‚Äôve had quite a few matches where I got my ass handed to me, but it was still fun to play and I make sure they know it too. 
---
But if someone‚Äôs being an asshole, no. Fuck you.
---
I understand that, what I'm saying is that the game has never measured skill, it measures mostly play time in the season to match players and even then its irrelevant. It has always been bad and it didn't get any worse, its just the usual.
---
Now this is toxic behavior.
---
i don‚Äôt understand why you‚Äôre being downvoted if you‚Äôre on point with it. billy is nowhere near op. you can loop him just as well as other killers, albeit it‚Äôs a little harder if the billy knows what he‚Äôs doing.
---
"hey you guys doing anything? I'm free all day for whatever"
---
Lmao I was running out of ideas.
---
I'm excited!
---
I mean, if you had to chase them around the ironworks window thrice and still got DS'd you would have had to pretty much go for them the moment they were unhooked. ü§î
---
Aw the second person should‚Äôve been the hag but its still really funny with just Michael
---
Huntress and Nurse Switch mains! Beware!
---
To a friend? Sure, to a random? Maybe, if it's somewhat deserved... just to ruin that person game? Not to me.
---
guess i'll mark that one down as troll then.    Make a case why you need to be able to bully killers to "play with your friend".
---
Well they haven't really managed that in 2 years, so I don't expect it to change. Last time we played I asked them if the killer left the hook, and they told me 'I don't know, I'm watching wrestling.'
---
You could keep track of the perks people use and change their point cost each rank reset. The most used perks would use the most points.
---
Rule 3. We also aren't allowing salty post-game chats.
---
Exactly, this game has problems on a PS4 pro and even has problems on people‚Äôs PC‚Äôs who have a couple thousand sink into them. Then they wanna put it on the switch! Yah okay you guys at BhVR need to actually hire people who know how to code a video game! It‚Äôs 2019 not 1999, I have games on PS2 that run just fine online and there is way more going on than in this game!
---
He's from Manchester, ftfy.
---
No, it's not.  You've just called yourself out for being a horrible person
---
Edit: I should have known this is a troll acount

Why would a David go against a ghost face who is p3 and a rank 20 at that unless he‚Äôs with a high ranking person then yea if he‚Äôs low rank he‚Äôll go against a low rank killer who isn‚Äôt a amazing killer
---
And while unhooking someone right?
---
*Heeeeyyyyy*
---
Because that's the same as decapitation.  Any form of it and their game would be banned in several big market countries for them.  China being one of them.
---
I dunno, personally I feel that all progression is good progression when you're at game start.
---
That aside, the big thing with Ruin is that Pig could very well just sit beside it in Ambush and get an easy grab on the first person to find it. 
---
Not every Pig will do this, mind you, but it's something to watch out for. It's always mindgames with her.
---
when the arguments points turn into personal attacks and insults of the other person, it usually means the person saying the insults feels like their argument isn‚Äôt strong enough on its own. you can have your own opinion, but golly gee is it a fucking terrible one. spirit can be looped, yes, but for how long? 10 seconds? then she gets her power and it turns into mindgames. i wouldn‚Äôt call that a loop able killer compared to the other killers that are called loopable
---
Sandbagging and working with the killer? not cool
---
A lot A lot of them sound sexual like 
---
1. Adam sounds like he's going to be bust when he's hurt
---
2. When you lift Claudette, she makes a "Oh my!" like sound like somebody smacked her on the ass. 
---
3. David sounds like he's bottoming when he's injured 
---
4. Jane sounds like the vibrator on max when she gets hit. 
---
5. The Doctor sounds turned on when you hit him with the pallet 
---
6. When you pair two lady survivors together who are hurt, it sounds awkward.
---
The only time I win a shack chase if they won‚Äôt drop the pallet is if I manage to fake them and they are looking behind themselves and I went in a different path and catch them on a diagonal or something. Otherwise if they won‚Äôt drop the pallet I will just leave them.
---
Its just luck/bad luck, its my most played map post launch and even as a non ST fan its a pretty cool map.
---
Most of the time it‚Äôs survivors and always after a 4K escape.
---
Depends ig if you‚Äôre memeing on a friend or smthn, but just doing it to be a peen then not cool
---
No it's more like "heavy breathing"
---
Most ridiculous part of this game. You shouldnt be punished for killing all survivors too fast when killing the survivors is the damn point of the game. I get the entity feeds off the survivors suffering but if you get punished for killing the survivors too fast the survivors should be punished for the game lasting too long
---
His tombstone add ons allow him to grab and kill a survivor while in tier 3.
---
Any luck?
---
Pretty sure you only get a cosmetic for the trapper, if you haven‚Äôt seen anything on the Twitter then you‚Äôre likely not getting anything but the base game and that cosmetic
---
Relatable.

Is that why you guys don't say it back? lol

There's also a tutorial for both sides in the in-game help menu, you'll get free bloodpoints for completing theme. (Bloodpoints are a currency used to level up characters.)
---
Welcome to DBD!
---
Did you just assume my race? I laugh like a dolphin. What a nerve! :D
---
Yeah I love sandbagging my mates and other stuff like it
---
I can't wait to loop some killers on-the-go! Even if it looks and runs like a ps2 game lol
---
maybe i am a weird person but i actually like playing versus legion
---
Does this hotfix include the changes to Demi?
---
A few ideas I have that I think could severely improve gameplay with Doc
---
* Hitting with the punishment stick instantly increases a madness tier
---
* When a survivor is in super close range ( like 10m or something idk, im bad with distances ) you constantly gain madness regardless of mode Doc is in
---
* Increase the range of shock therapy by 5 - 10 meters
---
Basically allows for Doc to do his job of making people crazier faster, and a lot more efficient
---
Make wraith able to swing from cloak once and unable to cloak again for a certain period of time. Hes easy enough to see moving around and it would help balance the poor guy.
---
I'm not saying everyone who goes against him hates it
---
I dont think freddy is better than hag, i would just swap them, apart from that, probably the most legit tierlist on this sub
---
It's in his power description
---
Shut up meg.
---
The hag's traps always make me shit myself
---
Manchester is in Lancashire
---
Ftfy
---
Nice montage!
---
I'm a bond gal, but empathy is nice too.
---
Glad it was able to help you in a way! Ghostface can still be pretty creepy to go up against, but if you ever see one bounce/teabag with their ability it looks adorable! There's a lot of nice/good players out there that might be able to help you with your phobia. 
---
If you make any friends in DBD, you can also set up a custom game/kill your friends and get them to use Ghostface (if they own him) so you guys can exclusively mess around and be silly so you can de-sensitize yourself. :) Happy gaming!
---
It‚Äôs the only reason holding me back from buying
---
Seriously? That's... Strange considering what type of game it is.
---
This made me wanna play Ghostface again
---
Yeah. It's really unfortunate. Jokes aside, I actually wanted to buy him but then I heard his voice. He sounds like a female survivor. They really squandered a licensed character with a voice like that imo.
---
I surprisingly have really good aim with huntress on console
---
not enough evader* :)
---
chase is for killer, not surv
---
That's entirely fair.
---
You get pip points for not being near the killer
---
y u mak mi read dis, iz mak mi kry.
---
:'-(
---
yea they are which sucks, like you mentioned killers fair off a better, going back just as far all the way to Clown you had PGTW and Bamboozle, Spirit had Spirit Fury and Haunted Ground, Legion had Discordance, Plague had Infectious Fright and Corrupt Intervention, Ghostface had Thrilling Tremors, and arguably Demogorgon is the first killer in a while that seems like he won't bring a near meta perk like all the others. Though even then all the mentioned killers, ALL their perks can work in the right build setup and be effective even the perks I didn't mention. Who knows, Demogorgon still might get his perks buffed, it took a while to make PGTW and Infectious Fright decently viable.
---
Compared to all the survivor counterparts, who got basically all lackluster perks with maybe an argument for 1 or 2 perks being OK in the meta.
---
That's a pretty cool idea honestly. Maybe even someone with mental health issues possibly.
---
Does Steve have a different voice actor in game other than his actual actor? That seems like an odd choice.
---
Lmao this Rank 19 Wraith is really good at grabbing people when they vault a window
