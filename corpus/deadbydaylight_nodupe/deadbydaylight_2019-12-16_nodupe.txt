The worst part is when you do too good as a killer and the game takes your pips away. I can see not letting someone rank up when survivors play that fucking bad, but there‚Äôs 0 reason you should de-rank.
---
For real Obama is following!?üòØ
---
Tf kinda sick person do you have to be to put this?
---
Even worse is when you‚Äôre playing Killer specifically for the Adept achievement/trophy and then they DC. To add insult to injury, you now need more than just sacrificing all four survivors to earn it; you need to get at least two gold emblems and two iridescent emblems. But, the silver lining is that it‚Äôs much more satisfying when the acievement/trophy does pop. Ex: my proudest trophy is Adept Plague. It‚Äôs also the most difficult one so far. By the time I popped it, I had already sacrificed all four in three or four different matches.
---
I would laugh so hard if she only played with stridor and no other perks
---
What you could do for survivor depending on your skills and luck is try getting the killers attention and try to run him as long as you can. I'm not too sure how the game judges a pip , black pip or depip survivor side. I think if you do at least one gen and run the killer as long as you can and at the end let him kill you you should black pip.
---
He says as hes holding a key.
---
I wish we could fit stridor in there too
---
I just saw myself in the future
---
would look great till your eyes melt
---
You know I did think about this. I have some good chase perks, I could run a chase build and just try that because at least I‚Äôm being of use to my team mates!
---
yes i want to marry jake thanks
---
Almost like there would be more viable killers at higher ranks if survivors stopped crying and instead learned to deal with new things
---
Nurse would be dumpstered if she came out today.
---
-Myers knows your location-

Frenzy, with its increased speed, guarantees a free 1-2 injures upon activation and with the broken pin add on they can severely cripple a team for 60 seconds. With the extra running speed, you pretty much force the survivors to drop the pallet since you‚Äôre too fast for them to fake a drop and run the loop once more, this also makes the iridescent button better. Sure, you become mostly an M1 killer when everyone‚Äôs injured, besides optional information gathering, but that‚Äôs not bad when there‚Äôs no pallets left halfway through the game. The extra vault speed is also great for never getting window/pallet teched again and can catch up to survivors easier. New Legion IS better. It‚Äôs the best I‚Äôve ever seen him.
---
I wish I was a streamer because I did what Otz did and played 16 games of Legion at red ranks and got 14 4ks and 1 3k and 1 2k to show his viability.

Sweet repost.

As a red tank survivor, dont you dare bring that trash into my trial. Slippery meat is better

I‚Äôd argue Laurie over Nancy

At least we have the most fun power to use
---
Finally, I am not alone haha!
---
Maybe this is a woosh moment but I'm pretty sure this guy is just actually that gigantic...
---
Jake looks the dirtiest out of all the survivors
---
ah yes bc apparently u must put urself in the shoes of the wraith when u didnt even see the end game chat or the pre game ah yes that isn't being entitled and insert yourself into situations they dont have any idea about. 
---
or attention u got
---
Give him a little bell that jingles when he walks
---
She looks a bit too enthusiastic..
---
tbh those perks dont really exists I cant come to think of any at least but I might be over thinking this
---
Except imagine 2 trappers.
---
Or imagine going against a clown and a legion. Oof.
---
oof and almost the same caption as well. while the picture is wholesome, I guess he just wanted to easy farm karma by reposting it almost exactly the same?
---
As a toxic survivor, I 100% agree with this. It takes days to move down just a few ranks. I want nothing more than to slide down into baby ranks
---
Better yet, p*rn is when two people who really, really like each other have a wrestling match
---
I would be, both survivor and killers get everything back and it‚Äôs all based on skill then
---
You drive a hard bargain there Patrick

Dunning  Kruger is insanely common in survivors

Your comics are a welcome to my mornings haha.
---
I dunno if it's the Shin Chan style or just how hilarious your scenarios are being made into comic form that makes is a delight to read.
---
I really wish DBHR will add game modes with multiple killers and way more survivors. Maybe they can‚Äôt use existing maps with out expanding them. But they could make extra large maps for those modes? Imagine if the killers had to compete to kill too? So they could deter each other and then get the kills. But then survivors can just evade if they‚Äôre distracted etc
---
I don‚Äôt know but I‚Äôm pretty dead hard rn
---
That is a huge downside, waste of a perk slot, for 50% extra speed on heals and 100% bonus bp. Thats trash as you would likely trade hooks, you get 3k back and lose a 5k escape.
---
Thanks for the valid argument by pretty much saying "I have nothing more to say but I'm too much of a snowflake to accept when I am wrong so imma just leave"
---
As someone with experience playing console nurse, you will legit be on top of someone coming out of a blink and miss from the fucky hitboxes, this vid is rare.

Why would I try? you're right.

Yoo my name on steam is daddy Myers the fuck is this
---
How about you balance the game first before trying to do other shit.
---
Entirely different development team.
---
Myers is at your location.
---
Probably won't get patched either. It's not endangering the survivors enough.
---
Samination saw it and said he was a trapper main
---
Awesome
---
Kate lookin pretty nice at that angle

np
---
Trying to give baby survivor the hatch be like:
---
Yup, it's why I have survivor tomes. I'm spending probably half my time in this game waiting for a survivor que. Guess it's why I have about 9 P3 killers and 8 P2 ones.
---
I think Flip Flop‚Äôs current is 50% conversion rate. So if you recover 20%, you get 10% wiggle. Effectively this caps the wiggle progress you could get at 50%. 
---
This change would mean that anything up to 50% recovery would give you 1:1 wiggle progress (meaning if you recover 20% you get 20% wiggle). And would make this perk something worth using. The number of times I‚Äôve had 99% wiggle just to get hook-vacuumed on is sad :(
---
THIS MAN IS HITTI NV THAT SHJT IH MY GOD
---
Same dude. If killer has ruin, I will do a scout nearby gen that I was doing, and continue repairing if it's not nearby
---
OH MY GOD you people are so fucking inexperienced at the game. They aren't patrolling the gens looking for survivors. They are patrolling three specific gens from the start of the game that are closest to each other not allowing the survivors to work on them. It forces the survivors to do all of the other gens on the map which leaves a cluster for the final three. The survivors literally cannot get the last gen done because the killer is running pop, dying light, thanat and sloppy and going back and forth between the three gens in a triangle regressing them while the survivors very slowly try to work on them. It leads to the survivors always healing, mending or trying to risk working on the gens very slowly. Eventually one will get slugged or hooked for pop if they cant get far enough away from the gen after trying to work on it.
---
Legion and Freddy are the biggest culprits because Legion runs fast and also forces you to take even more time to mend while Freddy can just teleport to gens. It is 100% holding the game hostage and a very toxic way to play because the only purpose is to waste people's time. I don't know how to explain it any clearer.
---
Evidently somehow this sub thinks somebody DCing out of a game that is absolutely miserable is more toxic than a killer going into a game with the sole purpose of wasting everyone's time. They are literally trying to get survivors to DC then bitch that they DCed. Tells you a lot about the people who use this sub.
---
Dude what, lmfao. Do you not understand that one of the kids on the team is dead because he was face camped in the basement and we had 3 gens left? I couldn‚Äôt leave if i wanted to. Also, pretty sure keys are in the game for a reason, that key has no relevance to me getting camped on the hook. But go off about it.
---
sometimes if you put puppies into the oven, they come back to life. i'm sure the same logic probably applies to babies. that said, that looks like a super happy, healthy baby.
---
Yoooo prince of persiaaa ‚ù§‚ù§ Would actually shit my self if there was a dahaka killer.
---
The shit people will do for Meaningless internet points.
---
bc latency and animation-delay that makes it look weird
---
If you play on console, get used to it.  I steady get hit through pallets and vaults but there‚Äôs jack I can do. I think for me it‚Äôs the lack of dedicated servers. The killer most likely sees in his eyes a good hit when you see him hitting you from three feet away.
---
Welcome to dead by daylight.
---
Self Care
---
This shit is mad cute. Dwights are adorable to me as killer. I had one run into a wall and then just look at me and shake his head.
---
I felt so bad as his body ascended into the big Locker in the sky.
---
Great picture
---
That‚Äôs good mate, just hope for better days and try to do what‚Äôs best for yourself. Good luck man life can be a bitch at times but it can also be amazing. 
---
Just keep trying man.
---
That aged badly
---
I only have nea P3. No other P3, survivors nor killers. It takes forever to P3 everyone with the time I have to play the game. Especially killers, I'm not gonna start searching all the good perks all over again.
---
These are great, really love the art style.
---
It was set for the fall but due to it being buggy on PC and switch they said they will wait untill they fix the bugs (basically wait 5 years and it will be there)
---
Overrated
---
look at him parade around, so proud of his complete lack of ability
---
u could‚Äôve just booped the snoot, but u had to go too far
---
Yes charge add ons are safe to use now. It was fixed with the last hotfix. Just wasn't in the patch notes for some reason
---
I‚Äôve noticed that when I try to time it perfectly it breaks MORE often
---
I've had the word "tr\*p" used against me derogatorily many times. I know the origin of the word, but the usage of it has changed.
---
People don't call trans people "tr\*ps" by mistake, its to reinforce a narrative that trans people only want to "trick" others into sex for their own transvestic pleasure (see: autogynophilia or autoandrophilia) or to spread HIV/AIDS maliciously.
---
It started as an endearing term for cross dressers and became an internet joke, now its used to put down trans people (mostly women) and is therefore considered a slur by many people.
---
How do I feel
---
What do I say
---
In the end it all goes away
---
When will pigs fly
---
I'm a trans person and I consider "tr\*p" a slur.
---
Yes...
---
Do it one more time just to make sure it's dead
---
probably when it is less trash
---
On PS4 I‚Äôm just trying to finish my survivor challenges but it takes so long to find a game I could have already just played 2 killer games in the time it takes to play like 1 survivor game
---
Are you playing Demogorgon or Doctor by any chance? I experience the most frame drops with those two killers. If you're playing Spirit with the blight cosmetic you may experience frame drops also
---
I‚Äôm working on it mate, I took some pelican liquid and I‚Äôm applying it to my pigs, well see how it turns out.
---
Myers is your location
---
Sad boy hours
---
On pc it‚Äôs the same way tbh
---
that's impressive on console
---
true
---
True, but Amanda‚Äôs letter is pretty nice sometimes.
---
OMG AND ITS TRUE WTF
---
BHVR: "Three. Take it or leave it."
---
We're gonna live forever - left behind - self care and sole survivor.
---
I miss 8 seconds ago when I didn't know this existed
---
You already posted this. Have a downvote!
---
It‚Äôs so upsetting when that happens. Especially when they camp you the WHOLE TIME. It was first time on hook for me and i died because he wouldn‚Äôt leave. Probably wasted 4-5 mins just camping me. When you have a pretty good team they can get all the 3 gens done in that amount of time and escape. I‚Äôve never understood camping. They apparently need a kill that bad lol.
---
Why does it say 6 gens left? Is this custom game? I didn‚Äôt know u can do that
---
Okay? He doesnt know what addons you have. It sucks getting camped but nothings gonna change it. People will camp just deal with it
---
I actually like that idea, they'd still be pretty useless but that's way better than nothing
---
You‚Äôre definitely a killer main and you definitely camp.
---
That's a neat idea
---
If it was once the exit gates were powered I'd run it on occasion, but only when one is opened? Yikes.
---
Idk about nerfing/punishing slug builds, but I think giving downed survivors options to do some things would be great!
---
The way the layout is it seems like Dwight killed a baby in order to get a 4K, a 4 man escape perhaps
---
Shit fuck oh oh
---
I have won multiple killer matches and kept rank and all bloodpoints too and it just says all players disconnected and gives me points for that too. If you have a horrible internet on console you‚Äôre guaranteed a win in dbd as killer it‚Äôs cancer.
---
SCREAM WAS ONE MORE MESSY AND THEY GOT IT
---
sorry for caps, im lazy to write it weithouth caps.
---
In my opinion the lore is heavily focused on obtaining ‚Äúhope‚Äù so having games end so quick doesn‚Äôt generate a lot of hope from survivors, therefore a lack of ranking up
---
OP probably has no idea who the woman in the photo even is smh my head ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I was the ash in this game!!
---
True, it‚Äôs just annoying. I play both sides and have been red ranks in both and I don‚Äôt understand why there is just always something to complain about.
---
That way too specific and relatable moment we‚Äôve all been through
---
Do you also camp survivors for carrying an item that‚Äôs in the game chief?
---
He needs a red nose and it'd be perfect.
---
He had a decent perk set in the beginning, once everyone spent all their money MoM was nerfed into oblivion and now no one ever uses him..
---
Yeah it‚Äôs not hit boxes you can literally just prove that playing a game on stable connection for console. It‚Äôs 100% a latency issue. There is so much to compensate for because the killer will have bad internet so you get teleported places you just were and pop off generators that were only 75%. It‚Äôs definitely not hit-boxes
---
Was this in Xbox one last night
---
I am not a crazy gunman dad, I am an *assassin*.  Well, the difference bein' one's a job, and other's a mental sickness! (c)
---
broken key last longer than black key so it‚Äôs more for putting add ons, not using it to get out, black key lets you get out but has less charges, i think it‚Äôs pretty balanced
---
Nah PS4 earlier
---
At least you‚Äôve got an excuse there. I once followed a Nancy across the entire fucking map, pretty much chasing her, wanting a heal. She wasn‚Äôt even like rank 20, she was in the 10-12 range. And I didn‚Äôt have Iron Will equipped.
---
Honestly, the fact that an item called a "broken key" does next to nothing makes a lot of sense to me. Why would a broken key be useful? We're lucky they can show the killer or the obsession with the right add-ons.
---
I figured, I wasn't digging on you. I was just commenting on my thought process
---
yea I remember the good days of P2P on console
---
No but i make sure their the first to go.
---
Omg what a weirdo! Why didn‚Äôt she just heal you üòÇ
---
Well, if for non beginners, who you played as survivor doesn't really matter tbh. If you take into account other factor than perks, then I would say ace since he's extremely quiet when injured. For beginners, I would say, meg for adrenaline, bill for BT &amp; unbreakable, Laurie for DS, David for DH, and I would say, Dwight? His perks are really good. Bond, prove thyself, and leader. I personally love bond as solo queue player. It gives you a lot of intel when you're getting chased, as to not being the killer to the survivors, and easier to find teammates if you're injured without self-care (lol) or medkit
---
Eh not really, why do you think Scream season 3. Was able to use the masks, they finally got the rights and Scream Season 3 was in works and I believe came out before Dbd Ghostface. I know it was in works before.
---
That‚Äôs so weird, ok thx I‚Äôll check another forum to see if  it‚Äôs Xbox1 or if I just need to re-install because my games been all sorts of fucked up.
---
Damn I need to find some of the killers you get üòÇ
---
So you don‚Äôt camp? So you‚Äôre contradicting your own statement about camping because of an item?
---
Believe it or not i dont camp lmao. Just cuz im defending the bubba doesnt make me a camper bud :)
---
dude killers always pick up a downed survivor and as slugging killer will just wait it out to screw the rest of them
---
'when'
---
Not for baby survivors or anyone who isn't humping their teammates all match.
---
The killer‚Äôs theme for when they‚Äôre not in a chase is really cool too
---
I wish I could respond in meme format. With the Patrick Star Driver's License, and say, I don't see the problem with that.
---
I honestly couldn't care less. Its very definition has nothing to do with trans people.
---
I just don‚Äôt understand how you defend someone for camping if you don‚Äôt do it yourself. Usually everyone else would find that annoying. But, ok, northwasted.
---
I don‚Äôt know. And since it was after Ghostface came out, there were the head movements- every now and again she‚Äôd turn and look at me, clearly wondering ‚Äòwhy tf is this Ash following me. Go away you fucking weirdo‚Äô. Eventually she finally stopped and healed, but I‚Äôd practically cornered her by that point.
---
What? So me saying he coulda camped you for having a key means i camp everyone that brings a key into my games. Lol that makes tons of sense
---
Yellow moris need a buff. They're so circumstantial they're useless.
---
Mobile gaming is shit anyway, so I see no problem here.
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs just best not to argue with those people, unless of course you‚Äôre having a good laugh.
---
That‚Äôs not very groovy of her!
---
Ooh, or her headmaster outfit from H20
---
I own the game on both PC and PS4. Survivors find games instantly on PC, killers find games easily on PS4.
---
Because of this I main survivor on PC and killer on console.
---
Nea and hide better. Hah! Funny joke there mate
---
#No. No it was not.
---
I mean the label of concept is a bit weird though, makes it seem as if he's parading it as his  
---
Just saw the posters comment so i'll stfu
---
They already tried to get him, they even have unofficial lore in place as to why he can't join. 
---
Basically, he's already controlled by his mom and the Entity couldn't control him.
---
Yeah and its not fair to lose a game to a key or ebony
---
He was stalking David with his ass.
---
stick it to the man
---
Okay
---
An example of hitboxes is getting hit while standing right on the vault. I‚Äôve gotten idiots who do that like vault locations are walls
---
Like how do you not get the hint... even if the killer was going extra on the taunting that is still not the right play to just get the game over with.
---
The man has gone and done it
---
No... \*Cof\*\*cof\*
---
Fungoose can also show how to hack legacy too
---
Honestly if you seal team 6 it and genrush and get out, the game was probably fun for no one.
---
whats strange is the amount of no avatar accounts he follows, as an Ex prez of the USA, where he is their only follower
---
and why all f13 movies get to use Jason? how f13 is gonna be a messed up franchise before the lawsuit?
---
It used to be where killer lobbies would take forever but now it's the opposite. Survivor lobbies take ages while I get into a killer lobby within a minute.
---
Nvidia freestyle is fine. So is reshade.
---
I also really like the Stranger Things theme. Both of them are very relaxing while waiting for the match to start.
---
That's a great way to get a killer to alt + f4 on you. If I wanted to play against a sweaty piece of shit, I'd pick a sweaty piece of shit killer, but if you pull this garbage when I'm trying to chill with a Trapper game, I'mma DC on you. No fucks given.
---
Think hes a survivor or killer? There may be a horribly dark side of Obama... a... Nurse... side of Obama.
---
What about his swimsuit?
---
Sorry to break it to you but my recent experience with dedicated servers are WORSE than before. Killer swings from 6m away, the weapon doesnt come anywhere near you yet the blood flies out on its own and you get hit
---
When you find out there are 2 legions and realize that it's basically infinite mending but worse

Getting a 4k should automatically give a pip, change my mind.
---
Now we are:  a n g e r
---
It's non bhv killers have one but they only appear if you don't buy that killers chapter (if you buy just the killer with shards then it will appear on bloodwebs of other killers)
---
That's literally the meme for the most part
---
Well yeah if you literally refuse to hook people it‚Äôs probably not a smart play but sometimes there‚Äôs situations where it‚Äôs best to leave the guy slugged and do something else.
---
Okay big guy.
---
The meme here sounds more like getting a safety pip. I‚Äôd say you lose when you de-pip.
---
So why did he kill everyone else?
---
Well boys we did it toxic survivors are no more
---
Not a big guy, but go off.

Sir that was only funny when i said it the first time. You seem salty lmfao

fantastic idea, i wholeheartedly agree to this

Legion-A Tale of 4 Teens

Killer mains: "don't be toxic" also killer mains: "all survivors are trash".  I love how killers are just learning they can and have been toxic this whole time.

---
Happy cake day, and seriously, the first time I saw her I thought she looked like she should have a unibrow.
---
They must share 2 brain cells. i mean, if that‚Äôs a way for them to win then.... yep, only 2 functional brain cells. It‚Äôs so sad cuz it reminded me of a time where i played against Mikey and a Feng. I was wondering why my teammates (2 Dwights) kept dying(being downed) over and over again so quickly while i was doing Gens. After finishing 2 they came onto me and got me trapped while Michael was stalking me. I DCed immediately not wanting to stay any more. I had the footage but i didn‚Äôt know how to send it to the devs. Man some people are just pathetic üôÑ
---
Oh they changed that? I do admit its been a minute since i played her. My point still stands.
---
Personally I‚Äôd like to see a nurse movie, she‚Äôs one of the more unique killers and her add ons add a good chunk to her lore
---
watch streamers. you don't have to play but you still learn by watching them
---
You can still get matched with people that you block.
---
Very kaweewee, 10/10 clean lines. Good job OP

If you are on xbox, I'd be happy to help you with a few tricks. Honestly rank reset is a crap shoot and more experienced players use it as a way to bully sometimes.

Killers that respect the self unhook shall inherit the Earth
---
No it wont, every day I hear from the f13 community "oh hey guys I heard its officially settled in 2 weeks!" Or "okay I have official word the lawsuit will be settled in about 1 month!"
---
I feel like in dead by daylight people confuse niche for bad. Niche does not mean bad. I cant tell you the amount of times flip flop has caused the killer to drop me numerous times in a trial due to flip flop and unbreakable.  However I agree they are 100% niche. It is a decent perk.
---
while I'm a firm believer in the idea that Killers shouldn't need add-ons to be good, apples are god tier
---
I'm not on console but I appreciate the offer. ; ;
---
This game came out on my 26th birthday. Yay!
---
Do you have any favorite streamers you could suggest?
---
"haha don't be toxic also you're garbage and should uninstall and i'm fucking you mother"
---
Fuck this shit, I'm out
---
[Laughs in Dwight]
---
No it doesn't.
---
I have literally never clicked on Dwight. I want my ashy boi at the top!!
---
I would suggest ohtofu's videos on improving game play, they are a bit older but holy hell have they helped me with my survivor games (killer main that wants to play more than half the game). He points a lot out that I would have never thought of, and breaks every play that all parties make during the clips he reviews
---
Thanks
---
There will never ever be jason in dbd unfortunately. For quite awhile the dbd community has said oh well get him eventually, and for way longer than that the f13 community has said the same thing. The chance we will ever get jason back in f13 is one in 1000, and the f13 game will get him back leaped and bounds before dbd will. Even if that 1 in 1000 chance actually happens he might not make it into dbd
---
at that point why not just play things on a laptop since it's just as easily moved around as a phone and all that stuff you plug into it but the screen is 10 times larger
---
Gotcha
---
NOO GOD! NO. GOD. PLEASE. NO. NO!!! NO!!! NOOOOOO!!!
---
Thank you! I'll be sure to check him out. :)
---
Oni gave me war flashbacks to when billy still had his flick and i was wondering why oni was allowed to have that when they took it away from billy lmao
---
Did they even confirm how bad the matchmaking is? It‚Äôs really frustrating that they seem to have no intention to fix anything related to this issue.
---
Offt your post history is well entertaining.
---
Still getting roasted over at the For Honor sub?
---
Pffffffffft ok
---
I'll check out Otzdarva soon! My problem right now is that I don't have the BP for good builds. I got Bubba recently so I've been trying to farm with him, but it doesn't work great because I get matched with survivors who are better than me.
---
Are you a ghost face? Cuz seems like you‚Äôre stalking me üòÜ

Thank you for the comment. I try to leave end game chat before people say anything but I've gotten a few 'baby killer's and 'gg ez kys's. üò≠ I guess I should stop playing Huntress for now since she's got such a learning curve.
---
Which killers do you have or like? What level is bubba? You could always play another killer and just pour your bp into bubba until bbq is teachable.
---
Hallelujah
---
who's that?
---
ASH MAINS RISE THE FUCK UP. CHAINS (from Payday 1 and 2 TM) COMMANDS YOU
---
Is that the one where he duels another guy with dual chainsaws?
---
Will be any sort of cross progress on mobile?
---
Jason has his own game, not sure he'll ever come to dbd
---
But a lot of prominent people also have anonymous accounts.
---
As a ghostface main I can confirm ^^
---
Thanks for the suggestion! I'll check his videos out. :)
---
seriously he‚Äôs naked and people act like that‚Äôs not exploitative
---
Lol yeah. I think it‚Äôs tcm 2 with Chop Top.
---
Otzdarva definitely. He‚Äôs one of the best killers ik and he‚Äôs super sweet and funny! I highly recommend you watch him :) He mains Trapper.
---
I've had plenty of matches where I see there's no items and then specifically play a weaker killer just to mix it up, only to have multiple people switch on items at the last second.  Yeah, no, not gonna deal with that.  If you're gonna bring 2 toolboxes, a key, and a map, just do it upfront and I'll play Spirit or something, but if you're gonna try and trick me then I'll just close the game in task manager during the loading screen.  I'm not gonna reward that shitty behavior with you getting an easy win against me because I'm playing Bubba or something.
---
This whole chain is a goddamn "bloody bones gonna get ya" jumps scare waiting to happen
---
These exist? I never see them
---
please don't use lore to justify poor game design.
---
damn this a lib-ass sub
---
where my chapos @
---
I like the concept. Sounds like something i'd watch
---
Shattered Bloodline and Demise of the Faithful. Maybe not the most action filled as some others may have, but the story portion would be amazing
---
There is. Just don't get hit. Tell yourself that, and eventually you will stop getting hit. Don't say, "That's strong, that should be changed", say "That's strong, I should get better.".
---
The after death part is kind of arguable since he gets them over time and so staying alive makes the gadget stronger.
---
Omae wa Moe shinderu
---
He needed antlers more than he needed pants
---
I don‚Äôt know it did it automatically when I clicked post
---
Actually when he lifts his hand I think that‚Äôs the pigs ambush.
---
I understand, but that's like not reporting a crime to the police because it won't stop crime.
---
I think it‚Äôs a nod to Freddy‚Äôs add ons? Idk this is a screen cap from the Stranger Things live stream
---
This man gets it  :-p
---
Yeah, I get that, but it essentially means you have to hide in a store which have their own liscensing, and avoid the center at most times
---
ghostface is the best oh my god
---
Reason why I stopped playing killer on stream. It takes 20 minutes to find a god damn match.
---
Yeah. In the potato fields (16-20) on PC, it take me 5-7 minutes to find a match as Killer, usually &lt; 1 minute as Survivor.
---
This made no sense all
---
Add a search bar for perks.
---
It.......it literally displays it on the screen
---
I absolutely love playing Demo, he‚Äôs definitely not the best Killer in the world but he‚Äôs really fun to use especially if you set up well because the endgame becomes a nightmare for survivors
---
*insert nea is the entity joke* bottom text
---
They've most likely replaced the 4th tome's challenges by now, seeing as Tome 3 was adjusted and i remember someone mentioning these might just be placeholders.
---
why did this get downvoted i hope it's cum too
---
So many idiots in 1 photo.
---
He spent most of the game camping the basement as Ghostface, and then we group-rushed the final save and he tunneled down the person who was on the hook- who had D-Strike, and the moment he got stunned, he ragequit and then told us to go die.
---
Shout out to our boy the dedicated servers. :)
---
LMFAO
---
Yes!

I downloaded your character portraits and my game is 200% better now

That was just sad

TNea?
---
Just like how they were working on an optimization patch for last year
---
I havent posted this though?
---
He definitely did if he didn‚Äôt hit you on your way up from the stairs
---
Steve, because he bae
---
Oh lmfaooo i did post. And its my grandmother???
---
That kinda hurted me tho. Cause it‚Äôs like why would you think that of me?
---
Idk why but as of late I‚Äôm waiting longer to play as survivor than I am as killer. Which is super weird
---
Idk.
---
She*** :) 
---
And i forgot? Is it really a crime???? Lmao
---
Go ahead and be salty though babyyyyy
---
unrelenting and beat of prey are pretty bad perks and lullaby can be okay if you have nothing better. my best killer is huntress and i've had decent success running whispers, nurse's calling, bbq, and noed. if you have hex: ruin then you can swap out noed, and sloppy butcher could also be used instead of noed since it's strong with nurse's calling. for hitting hatchets i've learned that it's a lot easier to hit people when they're vaulting windows or stop to throw pallets down
---
No, why r u unhooking in front of the killer u deserve to be grabbed
---
U sour and mean. That sucks. I hope u have a good day ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
I'd say not different enough to be an issue, but not close enough to be able to say "its his original 1978 mask". Not to mention he is way too tall to begin with, more similar in height to the Rob Zombie mountain man mikey.
---
Its gone now baby :* lmaoooo stop being a dick because i forgot i posted it

Like, why people do this. Address the issue being pointed out instead of making a competition of which role has the biggest problem. This community is pathetic some times.
---
I downed 4 people in the first 6 minutes with 6p seconds of  tier 3. And they were spread out. I feel so bad

No copy killers, but it would br epic. Myers and Ghost Face? Oni and Hillbilly

Look. I'm not always a nice killer

Flip Flop - Now is 70% wiggle bar, up from 50%.

Legion is really really good for farming. So is the doctor.  If you focus your bp on bubba you should be able to get the teachable in no time. There are also guides on leveling in the blood web the most efficiently. Good luck! Playing killer can be tough at first but there are some pretty good perks out there that can help.
---
Ofc you did
---
thats the dumbest thing I read today
---
Wait.. Is this your objection to the terrorist funding and sympathizing Obama? LOL get out of here
---
A non negative use of this meme!? Goddamn you deserve an upvote!
---
Start running no one escapes death with deerstalker and insidious. Then you can just down everyone at the end since they wanna be dicks. I‚Äôm a r16 killer after reset and I‚Äôve experienced the toxic community as well. Also toxic survivors deserve to be camped and left to die.
---
I personally think - it‚Äôs a little bit of all as you start to progress towards higher ranks. At yellow ranks it‚Äôs just hook everyone 2 times and you‚Äôll win - green everyone 2 hook except one or 2 kills and red ranks it‚Äôs kill all while stalling time to even pip . That‚Äôs the win senario for killers
---
What was the circumstance? What was the killer? Did they send you a message or do the common gen whack sign?
---
I guess you don't know about the history of any other nation, lol, always silly ignorant kids who make these comments.
---
Because the killer is facecamping?
---
His bleed out timer was at zero when he was hit.
---
They should make demo be wrapped in chrismas lights like he is in the chains cosmetics
---
Who? And what? And why?
---
I mean, why lie when its so easy to find proof? But ok dude.
---
Kate's a fucking idiot why wouldn't she erase her name off the list so she would get hatch.
---
you know you can hit people while holding survivors right?
---
:)) continue to be salty
---
Don't let one toxic ass Hex: Ruin it for you and others. That's bound to happen on occasion when farming with a killer or survivor.  Just move onto the next guy and help each other.
---
So is mettle of man, labeling one or the other as niche is simply a marginal distinction anyway.
---
Trapper, message,  Claimed he was just doing the interrup challenge.  I figured Hey I'll help him out I know how hard that 1 can be. He got all 4 of them and then he proceeded to hook two of us in the basement.  When our team mates came running to help us because they figured he was doing a challenge he got them too...
---
 1st time in the several months I've been playing this game that has ever happened and it is going to be last I'm never helping a killer again.
---
Lol you‚Äôre probably one of those people who always assume a 4man solo who outplays you is swf
---
Aw man i even made YOU mad that‚Äôs so upsetting ü•∫ imagine being mean
---
I think Dark Devotion is good On Demogorgon because you can maintain your 0 terror radius after teleporting making best use of the perk.

I'll see if I can get some better perks, thank you!
---
What a dick

go into every match expecting to lose, if youre trying to win every match youll just hate the game
---
Same thing happened when I ran mad grit üòÇ they thought it was legit hacks
---
gg pos
---
you dont know how this works
---
r/StabbyGang
---
Yeah I‚Äôll do gens, but when someone has like 10 seconds left on hook and someone is trying to unhook in front of the killer, it becomes a guessing game on how long will the survivor hold the unhooking for and this situation is too killer sided in my opinion. If they removed grabbing, the killer would still get the unhooking survivor.
---
This is especially annoying now when you can‚Äôt clip through the hooked survivor
---
I really don't!
---
Well shit, I was a trapper, but a different scenario. Yeah, some like to be cheeky like that, but it could be worse. They could send a ggez after. Always look on the bright side... is what I try to tell myself.
---
Are people really pissed that challanges are, well, challanging? I agree that some of the tome 4 ones are extreme, but its permanently doable, and what would be the point of even having a challange if anyone can do it easily? 
---
I dont expext to unlock every single challange, and I honestly like how hard tome 4 is for the most part, gives me hope that completing it will give the charm some meaning, unlike most shill "rewards" games give you these days just for attandence.
---
Thanks for the downvote asshat.
---
Suggestion to make facecamping less effective is a dumb thing?
---
Hey Guys how can I report this guy? In Spanish it says "bono monkey brazilian chimpanzee"
---
I'm a pessimist I can't do that lol
---
 I'm just not going to trust killers anymore all it takes is that 1 I'm not helping them ever again
---
i hope you realize that hook farming is a thing &amp; that killers aren‚Äôt always facecampers. it‚Äôs not being encouraged.
---
but seriously, would you rather get farmed and be downed immediately because of a shit teammate or have your shit teammate get grabbed? i know my answer.
---
Yeah I've seen teabagging for years. Soul Calibur, Street Fighter, Halo, Overwatch and others 
---
Tbh I think I'm done with the game, been playing with Gamepass so no big loss, but I was enjoying myself a lot more when I started. The rank reset basically just made it that I keep getting matched up with people who vastly outrank me, 
---
I find myself playing with fully slotted people while I'm scraping by with one slot. The only killer I'm actually enjoying is the Wraith. I liked the Nurse too, however I found myself way in over my head.
---
I liked Huntress as well, but playing with a controller makes her hard to use (I prefer couch gaming). I was considering getting in on the switch since everyone will have controllers kind of evening the playing field somewhat, but if the matchmaking is the same I find it hard to justify the purchase.
---
I think this game suffers (will suffer) the fate of fighting games, when the community is so small eventually that newcomers just move on because they keep getting matched up with way more experienced people.
---
The other day in a particularly big teabagfest someone kept jumping on top of some haystacks because they knew I couldn't hit them, of course I didn't know this.
---
Another particularly frustrating game about 3 of the survivors kept doing something to purposely throw an alert, over and over again. I don't know what the purpose was except to be annoying.
---
In a game today someone tried to do something like this to annoy/frustrate me but I somehow got a hold of him and hooked him, simply face camped him until he died and carried on the game normally.
---
Imagine complaint about survivors not doing gens when they could be lmao
---
Vibe check
---
Love this map...
---
By the time it hits console the next console will be released already and we will all move on.
---
Wait a minute, this isn't apex legends
---
Facecamp doesn't happen to often and id so go do the gens its 1 person. And if that person doesn't struggle and the other work together you can get the majority of gens done. All this would do is encourage survivors to sit right under the killer and immediately unhook. Which would make the person unhooked an easy down and hook again. 
---
So ya its dumb as fuck.
---
Logically, she should be able to infect the fountains with her own puke.
---
How is 6 gens even programmed in?
---
Fake the unhook to make him m1, then unhook during his weapon clean off
---
Are you implying this is race motivated...? 
---
Also consider not being a dickhead in the post game chat in the future.
---
Its me baffled by everybody hating because i made a mistake :)
---
Why not?
---
what? you're going around replying to everyone calling them "salty bitches" and yet we're the massive dicks for simply pointing our your resposting?
---
is there any context? why did he initially get called ‚Äúbaby killer?‚Äù
---
Its not lol
---
I you have 3 killers, it goes up to 7
---
I mean, call me crazy, but Flip-flop only giving you half of the recovery you had built up is really sad. I understand only letting you get up to half of a wiggle bar is only fair, but to recover almost half a bar and then still lose by a hair to a hook vacuum is rough.
---
*Cries in console*
---
Don't give bhvr ideas.
---
Oh that was the nea that was in the match, he slugged us all but she wiggled out i guess
---
So satisfying
---
Ok thanks anyway
---
There's an archive that says kill your obsession by any means necessary four times... I'm not a killer main so üòï

Are these a special event or am I missing something in the store menu?
---
the report button is right there in the end game screen, the icon with the thumbs up and thumbs down to the right of their bp score
---
Personally I'd like it to fill the wiggle meter 1:1 up until 50% and then stop. At that point you can fill up to 50%, make an effort to make distance between you and any hooks in order to maximize the result.
---

I was called sick and told to be ashamed of myself? Called an asshole for reposting, somebody even said its probably not my grandmother. Tell me thats not a dick move.
---
Nothing to kill yourself over mate

just click on a Killer/Survivor with one, you'll see the skin right away it should be the first outfit of every character who has one, icon is bright orange.
---
Ok, so I will make these clear. It is quite common for people from Argentina to offend Brazilian's by calling them monkeys, so all I want to do is get these screenshots to a dev or anyone that can judge the situation properly
---
Dwight ‚ÄúThis is Fine‚Äù Fairfield

Ok thank you

Well I guess you can come out of any discussion a victor by saying no I'm right. You have fun with that buddy. Don't go into law.

---
Love the artstyle man, is that how you draw normally?
---
This is the ship I never knew I needed in my life
---
Nurse could be interesting
---
So that makes it okay to reply to every single comment calling them salty and bitches when not everyone is "attacking" you back?
---
It's just breeding toxicity by doing that
---
I love your style SO MUCH I wish I had more to reference so I could replicate it, I love it so much!! ( Ôºæ‚àáÔºæ)
---
when you select a hallowed blight cosmetic it should give you the option to buy it with the serums right next to the option to buy it with shards or cells
---
Thankyou
---
Is that a stranger things thing??
---
So I can't send multiple pics in one post, but he started camping a Dwight with 2 gens left and when the match ended, the player complained. The discussion is longer than the screenshot, I just sent the last one of them
---
Don‚Äôt forget also has a useful gadget
---
i believe if you press the thumbs down button next to their name there‚Äôs an option. i might be wrong though. i just misunderstood the situation and i‚Äôm sorry he said that to you.
---
Nurse WAS dumpstered.
---
Man I was gonna upvote it back but someone can't handle disapproval
---
....that makes myers the elf.
---
I did that but there is no way of anexing images so it  probably wont be taken seriously
---
Niche isn‚Äôt bad but very niche just isn‚Äôt worth a perk slot
---
Ever since the rework Nurse has been such an abject disaster of a killer that it‚Äôs rare to see one nowadays. And usually if I see one, I just let them have me since usually they wouldn‚Äôt kill anyone else regardless. 
---
Spirit I feel like just needs time for people to adjust with the nerfs. They didn‚Äôt do much but they did enough that The non-Spirit mains will struggle with her. 
---
Honestly red ranks has more Freddy in it rn than any other killer (source: a red rank survivor writing this comment)
---
Eh. Three's not too bad
---
‚ÄúHe knows when you‚Äôre sleeping, he knows when you‚Äôre awake, and it ain‚Äôt the saint nic‚Äù
---
knowing the way reporting systems work, probably not.
---
Mettle of man isn‚Äôt niche, protection hits are just broken
---
What would happen if Oni and Billy were to hit each other while sprinting?
---
I‚Äôm so glad that they haven‚Äôt patched this, and I hope they never do.
---
It's run pretty rampant it seems.
---
*tier 2 ping* lol
---
Niche isn‚Äôt bad but being niche isn‚Äôt as good as something like adrenaline that you can use almost every game
---
i DO always love tragic backstory killer girls and also this sounds very fitting in dbd universe!!
---
Maybe read all of them before commenting. All of them were hateful, so yes, all get a response. Every single one calling me out had some bullshit in it. If its really that much of a big deal, ill fucking delete it. It's literally my / second / post in this subbreddit. You all shit on my post and youre gonna get mad at me for it?
---
That really does imply that I am the one to blame when I literally answered an offense
---
Nah, if it were something that deserved a downvote it would be one thing. But some people just get hard-ons being negative.
---
I quite like Ace‚Äôs chest perk but I get why people don‚Äôt run all of his perks
---
Are you on ps4? I hope not lol.
---
Okay but like..? There's no reason to react like that. I retract my downvote bc you're being at least a little reasonable, but come one man. What's to gain?
---
Sorry, third post.
---
That is really sad
---
Y‚Äôknow, I don‚Äôt mind the writing. It‚Äôs very stream of consciousness based, which makes sense given these seem to be memories the Archivist pulled ‚Äúout of the fog‚Äù.  They‚Äôre basically long snapshots of the person‚Äôs life, and it works a lot better being a jumbled dialogue than written like a standard contemporary story. The repetitive nature of some of the lines is for effect, and I think it works well to put us in the mindset of the survivor, but from a third party‚Äôs POV. They‚Äôre written like the Archivist (read: us, the player) is experiencing the memories from Claudette, a sort of first person adjacent. At least as of the first two levels of the tome, I don‚Äôt mind them.  
---
My main issue is the narrator. He sounds like it‚Äôs really close to his lunch break and so he‚Äôs trying to get out what he can as fast as he can. If he took his time and used different inflection, especially for some of creepier lines in Evan‚Äôs story, I think that would‚Äôve been more effective.
---
....He literally formed an opinion from what you clipped. Why didn‚Äôt you include the pre-game/end-game?
---
yep
---
Omg this gave me a good chuckle have an upvote.
---
Yes.
---
Looks like blood wiping is back on the menu!
---
She's still the best killer in the game.
---
What was to gain from downvoting encouragement to someone who has been discouraged by a toxic player?
---
Statistically incorrect. 
---
In fact in red ranks she is one of the worst killers in the game.
---
Ya ps4 is f‚Äôd lately...instant for killers, 10 mins for surv :(
---
We have all been tricked. The hints were there from the start. The entity, an evil, completly unvulnurable to us, wanting for good people to be tortured, hunted, terrified and dying over and over again. And after he pulled us into his world, he added his first Avatar, the man we know to be evil incarnate. With a power to play with his Victims, to kill and torture them more and more easily the more he toys with them, having them tremble in fear, never safe from his stalking eyes. Had he been there from the start, we might have noticed. He didnt care about the survivors, he didnt need the other Killers, it was just a game, made by evil himself, whilst all this time, he was waiting, lurking, stalking us, and now it is finally complete. He is ready. He played with us, when we were running, afraid he might kill our avatar, how foolish we were. We didnt see, that all this time, we were feeding him, now finally, he has charged his P4, and he is coming for us.
---
Yeah, try playing ark
---
It‚Äôs more then likely swf you shouldn‚Äôt be getting matches like that,but look at it like this you can learn how they play that can help in the long run Edit: or maybe because it takes awhile to find games at that high rank it will slightly ignore it to find games?
---
Flip-Flop ‚Äî Easy fix: make it fill the wiggle meter at a one-to-one ratio up to 80/85/90%. Anti-slug perks already have limited utility so you might as well make it good. Unbreakable is still arguably better. 
---
Buckle Up ‚Äî Not really sure. The survivor aura reading seems like something that would never really be worth it. Maybe make it so it reveals the killer aura any time you heal a health state (not just dying to injured). That might be a little crazy, though. 
---
Mettle of Man ‚Äî I hate this as a Killer main but it‚Äôs still my best idea: If you are healthy and are struck by an attack that would place you in the dying state you are instead placed in a deep wound state with a 10/15/20 second timer. This can happen once per match. Does not trigger if you are already injured. Hard counters NOED. Weakens Billy. Doesn‚Äôt hurt most M1 killers. Hurts Myers but doesn‚Äôt cripple him. Hurts Leatherface but he can use a buff either way. 
---
That last one comes with the consideration that Nurses Calling be allowed to detect mending.
---
 
---
I am the Nea Karlsoon in the screenshot and I'am going to give you some context
---
The killer was myers who didn't pop tier 3 the entire match. We finished the 5th gen and he downed a guy and  
---
proceed to facecamp. Me and my friend were downed trying to save the guy while the exit gate was being powered.
---
The 4th guy escapes and the 3 remainig are sluged and you know the rest, my friend and the other died and I escaped.
---
I know I was toxic first in the endgame chat but being racist cause some random dude said some silly things is just being an a\*\*hole.
---
Yes! Now I can finally reveal that he has in fact paid me to act for his audience
---
Completely change MoM to a different effect entirely, that bitch never needs to come back
---
My poor boys who mained M1 killers were in hell
---
Just teasing lol we all make mistakes
---
as the end of the battle pass gets closer, you‚Äôre gonna experience some weird things. i know i am.
---
Oni:uses katana to stun killer.    Killer:*surpirsed scared noises*
---
Check out the Don't Starve: Hamlet theme. I usually throw that on when I'm waiting for a game and there's no good streams to watch.
---
:/
---
red mori
---
I hate that I have to play like shit to actually get any blood points
---
Legion has a perk perfect for handling that
---
One is a click of a button away. They aren't justified, but it also doesn't take any effort to do. You put way more effort in, over something super trivial too. Also just because they were negative doesn't mean you should as well.
---
This was done for a friend but it was too good not to share
---
I know, thanks. That's why this is mostly a rant. But to be matched with several higher ranks than me several times in a row stinks. And then on top of that, to have survivors being toxic? I'm not supposed to win every match. I understand that, and that's fair. It's the toxic behavior I can't stand. I'm never like that when I play survivor so what gives?
---
It‚Äôs a pretty known thing that you don‚Äôt play Killer right after rank reset.
---
Thread got a lil out of hand, I think you can mute notifications for specific posts/comments if you want though
---
My bad.. didn't figure out it was you. Marblethesurvivoronly I was talking with. It's pointless have a discussion with you anyway, you're too bias and obtuse
---
Pretend I never replied to you
---
Yeah, if there‚Äôs really some exploit pairing the two together, the devs can‚Äôt fix it if they don‚Äôt get reported.
---
4 of 5 is pretty bad.
---
Then realize that you play console so you can‚Äôt be matched with him
---
I wish I had a good pc for dbd
---
Demogorgon  then uses shred there goes Myers
---
Since this game runs in windowed fullscreen mode, the desktop compositing found in any modern OS will prevent screen tearing anyway. So you should definitely disable V-Sync, all it does is introduce unnecessary input latency.
---
Which of the people who escaped is the fourth
---
get ready for a removed post
---
Imo you can blame certain youtubers for toxic behavior, sure every game has some but for this game some people have made their career on bullying, and then you get the wannabes
---
Theyre still there though. The whole comment thread is ruined and its the first thing that pops up when you click on it. :/
---
Kinda curious,  which killer on console? It seems like doing the reverse would be infinitely easier. 
---
Also, I believe your rank has a much larger effect on queue time. I typically hover rank 10-5 on killer, and my wait is normally ~30 seconds - albeit, a crap shoot for the ranks you hit.  My friend rarely plays the game at all, and his queue for killer is ~5 minutes at rank 15.
---
You need to understand that myself and many other survivors tried to be upfront with our selections and it just resulted in us getting dodged relentlessly and then just getting off for the night. Any game with a ranking system should not allow players to dodge games without penalty.
---
is.. is ghostface capturing myers‚Äô ass
---
Exactly
---
He‚Äôs capturing the scenery but... I can see that it‚Äôs pointed oddly.  Camera angles ig.
---
Looking like Last Year out here
---
Agreed, only exeption beeing when you spend upwards of 30% of game time in close proximity to a hooked survivor.
---
That‚Äôs me when I drop a pallet on Myers.
---
*‚ÄùYou can look, bb, but you can‚Äôt touch~ ‚ù¶‚Äù*
---
Don't cry about anything in the game if you do that. You cannot call out Mori, noed or anything you think is unfair if you promote this behavior which results in people to play way more like assholes as killers
---
You promote a behavior that will make others try to make your life miserable. Do that, but then don't cry when killer do something you don't approve. You brought it to yourself
---
What nerf??
---
plus 3 decisives
---
üò≥
---
If this doesn't get front page but some shitty haunted ground joke does there is no justice in this world
---
I wish I had people to do this kinda shit with :(
---
Legion op
---
We already have something that's very similar. 
---
Freddy's Dream Snare slows and prompts noise notifications when triggered, and Hag also has similar effects with her trap addons.
---
I‚Äôm PS4 also and I‚Äôve noticed an increase in toxicity since rank reset, now and again I would get toxic survivors but not it‚Äôs every time I play killer.
---
Yeah from the first season. The kid captured by the Demogorgon used a ouija board made on a wall with Christmas lights and a painted on alphabet to communicate to his mom.
---
A 3 hit requirement is niche, but regardless of either of our opinions on it, it would be hard to say if it would actually be niche if protection hits were functional because no one has been able to test it.
---
To stalking range and gain.
---
This looks like 90% of a killer mains list.
---
Is your Iron Will icon Nezuko?
---
Ps4??
---
What about how low the hag is, that stood out to me instantly
---
What are you talking about? I thanked him/you.
---
Xbox ):
---
Ash‚Äôs perks have become poison to most of my blood webs. I leveled him way too early so any time I have three perks with three levels each that appear in my first thirty blood webs *way* too frequently for my liking.
---
Goddammit buddy
---
Oh look, leakingpickle again with his superior wisdom
---
I really missed you buddy. Your "acute points" are always so freaking funny to read
---
Just another day at the BHVR balance office
---
Easily top 5. Cmon, like her traps for teleport is amazing and not to forget. No cool down, I don‚Äôt understand why she isn‚Äôt picked more.
---
Only person I've played against was TydeTyme
---
Endurance is too strong no matter the requirements. The current requirements are "high" just to ensure people aren't willing to run this perk until they can give it a proper rework.
---
MoM needs to be redone from scratch. New effect, new requirements.
---
That's what happens when they nerfed balanced landing. Everyone running dead hard now
---
Never
---
Popular streamer, has a nice energy and lots of good killer tipps.
---
Should do I list the things not fun to go against? 
---
Spoiler: survivors will probably get twice the nerfs killers would get in that list
---
I wish I could upvote this multiple times cuz I would love Frank to be added to DBD
---
I‚Äôm in the US, so the best I can hope for is Ohmwrecker. Still, it would be a good time.
---
Except I‚Äôm on ps4.
---
I think this list is downright terrible. It might be the worst I‚Äôve ever seen tbh.
---
I‚Äôm surprised BHVR hasn‚Äôt taken away the killers ability to even injure survivors at this point.
---
Spirit and Nurse are a lot more inconsistent and harder to play now. For me it would be:
---
A Tier: Freddy, Hag, Nurse
---
B Tier: Spirit, Hillbilly, Ghostface, Pig, Myers
---
C Tier:  Huntress, Demo, Plague, Leatherface, 
---
D Tier: Oni, Doctor, Clown, Legion
---
F Tier: Wraith, Trapper
---
ill give you an upvote. i hope it is too
---
Let‚Äôs see what was before dbd, happiness, friends, a job and a fixed sleeping schedule, makes sense
---
&gt; bear in mind he states this is with no add ons at red ranks level
---
Obvious exclusion. Also, your flair is too long to show properly for me, what is it supposed to say?
---
Posted after my made my edit btw
---
right dont bitch when killers use dirty tricks aswell
---
This is what I found fascinating about Otz and Tru3‚Äôs recent Wraith discussions.
---
Both have a different opinions on what counts as winning but both their views have really strong points.
---
Personally used to lean more towards Otz‚Äôs if you kill most of them you win point of view but someone pointed out if you camp and tunnel with an ebony mori you could get a 4K but it wouldn‚Äôt feel like a deserved win.
---
So now I‚Äôm leaning more towards a pip = a win since you need to (theoretically) play better to get the pip
---
100% yes then!!
---
Don't speak too soon.
---
'death to moris, death to keys, death to noed and object please'. I realize how tacky it is so I'll probably change it.
---
I really like those survivor thumbnails! Are those new?
---
Basement bubba but you're a bitch if you run it
---
I respect that, to me though I can probably excuse everything as stylistic decisions (although I do think there is far better ways of going about it, as I highlighted above), however, I cannot look past the pronouns in the memory. It is jarring and confusing for "he" to keep swapping between multiple characters. I thought maybe it was to suggest Darwin was her father, but that would be ridiculous with the wording present.
---
It‚Äôs the **PLAHGG** dood!
---
Surprising, since DH isn‚Äôt that great with dedicated servers.
---
Myers: wiggle off and Kate‚Äôs not the only thing I‚Äôm gonna stab
---
Leatherface above Ghostface? Dafuq?
---
What's the music from 0:13? I've already heard it but can't name it.
---
Cursed
---
A Leviathan Axe.
---
Imagine losing with GhostFace...jeez, you have to be horrible as a killer
---
Other way around. Killers are promoting a behavior (dodging) thats making survivors try to make their lives miserable (switching characters at the last second) 
---
And you dont see the hypocrisy from killers who refuse to against toolboxes, flashlights, prestige, etc. but then turn around and equip ebony moris and their best addons and expect survivors to suck it up? With the horrible queue times and endless dodging, this game is already pretty miserable as it is. I have no problem using a scummy tactic to combat killers who do something equally scummy.
---
Ooof
---
Like always, this has nothing to do with hitboxes. Will people ever learn that they aren't playing an offline game?
---
Heh, accurate
---
Lore wise , huntress should be at 145 speed since she‚Äôs a full fledge athlete , would love that buff
---
I suppose so. Thanks for reading my rant nonetheless.
---
Idk, if I wanted to hear dialogue between edgy teenagers I would just browse Tumblr
---
Abusable
---
No, I understand it, I'm just not going to deal with it.
---
Craven Estate only got rights to the US with Nightmare, yes, but New Line owns it globally. For cosmetics or any other future things related to Nightmare outside game mechanics, both would have to say yes
---
If you burn the 'Ebony Mori' offering before a match, you don't deserve to gain a ranking pip, as 'Ebony Mori' gives an unfair advantage to the killer.

I would do something like this:
---
Start and finish a game with competent teammates who don't crouch in a corner all game.
---
I sadly agree. if you fk up 1 number it becomes op instantly, like it was at it's launch
---
Better safe than sorry. I still have PTSD from people who run MoM.. all 4 of em
---
&gt;Just like how they were working on an optimization patch for last year
---
You are joking, right? Or did you miss all the multiple engine updates we've had in the past patches.
---
This. He was stalking and that‚Äôs why the Survivor was able to run through him. I‚Äôd imagine his plan was to block the stairs and feed into Tier 3, but probably forgot that Stalking makes survivors able to pass through you

You basically just said "No he wasn't trying to bodyblock, I think he was trying to bodyblock."

At the start it looked like he had both Trapper's and Huntress's idle animations. This is incredibly cursed.
---
Buckle up should let you pick up downed survivors, of course the downed survivor would be the one controlling to stop griefing.
---
No
---
This is such a great video, J'm impressed and the humor is spot on
---
&gt;Like I'm okay with being stomped sometimes, but if you have to be a d*ck while doing it TO A LOW RANK KILLER...
---
They can't see your rank before or during the match so they don't know you are a low rank killer.
---
100% this. MoM is a perk that needs to be terrible because the effect is too good.
---
Yeah I understand that my question is a bit off putting. I didnt mean for it to sound like all ghost face were like this

The Legion in New Vegas was the first ever villain in Fallout that I thought had a point. The Master was a jackass and the Enclave were the Enclave, but The Legion had a point. Then came the Institute. Fuck the Institute
---
yooo this exact thing happened to me against legion, it was super annoying but I knew everything he was doing all game
---
You‚Äôre right I should have more faith in politicians /s
---
See if there were 3 more davids all with the shirtless cosmetic and Michael also having a shirtless cosmetic, now that'd be epic
---
No, I said YES he is trying to bodyblock, but fucked up by holding down his power. That‚Äôs why she escaped without being hit.
---
I was up against a legion too. Maybe it‚Äôs a bug with him then?
---
Boss fights aside though I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs my second favorite in the entry behind City though all of them are great
---
Pls tell you play Titanfall 2
---
 The killer was myers who didn't pop tier 3 the entire match. We finished the 5th gen and he downed a guy and proceed to facecamp. Me and my friend were downed trying to save the guy while the exit gate was being powered.  The 4th guy escapes and the 3 remainig are sluged I escaped and the other 2 died.
---
 I know I was toxic first in the endgame chat but being racist cause some random dude said some silly things is just being an a\*\*hole.

The only way i've been able to get my Trapper Archives challenges is by farming, and some people dodged after I told them because of Jackasses that do that. Fuck them

Agree with everything you've said
---
The n word of south America, I really think you don't know what you're saying. I'm from Chile btw
---
Thank you for celebrating my fifteenth birthday
---
As said.. you promote a bad behavior making things worse. Enjoy your own medicine
---
I see you don't know what constant means.
---
Better? What?
---
If I'm obviously confused don't be an asshole, just explain first.
---
Much like the survivor in the post, this took a big turn
---
His stalking rate is constant, this doesn't change that.
---
Thanks for posting a source, I knew range increased/decreased the stalk rate by playing the killer.
---
What I mean is that how is more than 5 gens even programmed in as something that can happen in a game? Did the devs actually have this so they could add a game mode with more than 1 killer in a game?
---
Fungoose has won like 114 games in a row with plague and doesn‚Äôt run thana
---
This is the best way to explain how a match with a rank 1 survivors against  a rank 20 killer goes
---
I stg this game is like crack I know it's shit and I know it's not good for me but DAAAAMN THAT FENG COSMETIC THO
---
So, something having a variable speed based on distance is constant?
---
Yui looks slick as hell
---
You literally said he was wrong, even though he was right, you get less stalk when they are further away.
---
I only camp and t-bag the survivor who‚Äôs being toxic.
---
I think starting with all of his traps is fair! All the other killers with traps start with theirs!
---
I do the same but I only t bag and camp toxic survivors.
---
He probably wouldve won 114 in a row with thana then.
---
Yeah, I can only wish
---
Incredible smartassery but aight
---
I know you didn't mean to but some people might take it the wrong way. The path to hell is full of good intentions
---
Still, just ignore those troglodyte who still think races are a thing and who discriminate against others. They are worse than scums
---
We also might be taking his words in the wrong way since maybe he encountered just tapp players who were toxic af. Like if he said the same thing but replacing trapp with Nea or Feng you wouldn't have thought he was being racist but just pissed I guess
---
In any case don't let anyone who discriminate bother you. Call them out, sure! But don't let them make you feel down or be bitter, stupid people are everywhere
---
Is Nurse laughing or gasping for air after years of having a pillow case over her head?
---
Yes, constant variable speed.
---
Stalk rate is constant.
---
There have been times as survivor where I go above and beyond in altruism and gen repairs but end up dying near the end so I de pip lol
---
#28 stab wounds
---
Who said anything about his stalk being constant? Teddy said you get less stalk when they are further away, and that is because of stalk efficiency.
---
You asked for a source, and I provided the source.
---
I am confused why you are saying anything about his stalk being constant.
---
Flip-Flop is (arguably) his best but it's still not "fine." You said Flip-Flop is fine, not that it's the best of Ash's perks.
---
When choosing between wet diarrhea, a turd, and a turd with corn flakes in it one can argue that the turd is the least awful of the bunch. But it's still a turd that smells terrible which I'd flush down the toilet at my earliest convenience.
---
Maybe, maybe not since the perk he replaced thana with is better
---
Ace perks have their use
---
Some of that seems ridiculously OP but the starting with all traps seems nice
---
according to the devs 2k should be a considered a good result, and what they're trying to balance towards, but more often than not a 2k is a depip. their balancing philosophy is not reflected in their reward system. for me, pipping is the win condition, because i want to play against stronger opponents.
---
So he called you monkeys? Wow so hurtful.
---
Rank reset?
---
Because of posts like this the devs seem to ignore most suggestions coming out of reddit (rightfully so). Most balance suggestions are straight up broken.
---
THATS A GOOD QUESTION
---
Reaches tier 3 
---
*Piano music intensity‚Äôs*
---
Where in the post am I talking about stalking rate as a function of range? No where.
---
HE. NEVER. STOPS. SMILING.
---
I'm guessing the killer is Mexican off of his Spanish dialect and OP is Brazilian, so it is actually pretty hurtful
---
What was his build?
---
Says the guy who went off topic.
---
Survivors: this new killer is OP you must nerf them NOWWWWWW
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also survivors: why do I only fight nurse and spirit!?!?
---
What the...
---
Constant has 2 meanings, depending on the context used.
---
I was under the assumption that you were using constant as a noun, in which a situation does not change. In this case, it does change with distance.
---
Ohhh I thought she was going quicker but I didnt knooow. I like dat. What would you recommend in place of stbfl
---
The topic is he shouldn't have been nerfed, when he hasn't. When you use a "Discussion" Flair, the bulk of the post is taken part in the comments section. If you didn't want a discussion to happen you should've used "Rant".
---
I feel like i‚Äôm ruining the image of ‚ÄúDwight mains‚Äù I have 2 accounts and whenever my main one gets suspended i play the other. And the other is like at rank 18 or sumn. I always play toxically there ;‚Äô) oops
---
Found the basement bubba main
---
I got a good laugh out of this, thanks for sharing lol.
---
R-201 carbine and mastiff are personal favorites of mine but I have been trying out the flatline
---
As a Brazilian I play in South American servers this is how most post-game chats are like
---
I use Ruin (but I want to switch it for Corrupt Intervention), BBQ, Thana, and Bamboozle. I'd say experiment with stuff and see what you enjoy, man!
---
2k could be considered a win, or even a 1k, if the surviving players weren't complete toxic trasholes to the killer every single time.
---
He‚Äôs just trynna boogie let him vibe
---
So freakin cute lol
---
Same! Never knew
---
But like... the Legion is basically the Enclave, isn't it? They're both groups that want to bring order to the world in the style of a fallen civilization, treat anyone who isn't them as an enemy to be killed (although the Legion is also fond of enslaving things, I dunno if the Enclave does) and are both led by delusional leaders.
---
Getting hit granted a stack, three hits and you ignored going down if you were already injured. After it activated you were revealed if you healed to full. Basically the same as it is now, except it didn't have the "Protection hit" requirement.
---
What this lead to was every single survivor getting a free bonus hit for doing absolutely nothing against every single killer except Billy, Leatherface (Chainsaw could take them from full to Down), Nurse, and Pig (Both of whom were glitched and wouldn't grant a stack if they had jumped or crouched prior to hitting).
---
Considering it was three hits, Survivors automatically charged it twice for the first hook, and if they healed or had Borrowed Time active on the second hook they just automatically got it.
---
Every single Survivor was running Dead Hard, Adrenaline, Decisive Strike, and MoM, meaning you had to catch every single survivor a good 10 times in order to secure a kill, and it also granted stupid amounts of free safe unhooks since you could just tank a hit with MoM, use the speed boost to unhook, and run off. This is also not including how Dead Hard made it extremely difficult to kill a Survivor, Decisive Strike often allowed you to get that last MoM charge while the Killer couldn't do anything to you for being so stupid, and due to all the extra hits Adrenaline was almost guaranteed to go off every single game.
---
It killed Survivor Build diversity because nothing was anywhere near as powerful as just stacking a ton of second chance perks, and it destroyed Killer diversity since there was nothing you could do to stop it once you were already in game; you can wait out DS, kill someone with Adrenaline, or bait out Dead Hard. MoM was just a passive that activated for solely trying to do the Killer's job.
---
I was gonna say that it can count for unhooks too
---
I've gone through the patch notes, and have found no evidence of Myers have an unlimited stalk range. He does gain more stalk when stalking multiple survivors, but he doesn't have an unlimited range and has never had it.
---
He needs something for indoor levels,  traps are way to visible on bright white floors.
---
I use dying light BBQ ruin and I'm all ears rn. But I bought pop from the shrine and I was gonna switch I'm all ears for pop when it comes up in blood web. I'm also leveling nurse rn to get thana and nurses for that Wraith and GF build Tru3 uses
---
Let's get him
---
The biggest QoL change I desire is the ability to reset traps without picking them up. There's nothing more outdated to me than having to set down one trap, pick up the one you want to set and then actually place it back down when carrying your limit. If they could make it so you press like left ctrl to reset it while standing over it that'd be extremely appreciated.
---
Not bad I mostly use L-STAR
---
Aw yeah, Mozart my boy. Thanks a lot!
---
Shouldn't Flip Flop be 30/40/50%, so the rank of the perk actually means something?
---
Cool idea but not very good
---
Flip Flop is just never useful if the killer isn‚Äôt slugging, and is only rarely useful if they are.  What would be interesting is a skill check while being carried that increases your wiggle meter.
---
I think the perk is fine, it can be buffed sure, but between the 3 that's all it needs a small buff, not a complete rework like the other 2 in order to be good.
---
This is adorable and I LOVE the art style omg
---
I thought this was Jumba from Lilo and Stitch in armour... Oof
---
Can we talk about how incredibly fucking useless that first pallet is tho?
---
I'd report and block them. Honestly, people who do that deserve to get Mori'd IRL
---
Not necessarily only Trapper, he is rather good with all killers, especially since he doesn't need ruin.
---
You are just horrible at this game
---
combat straps &gt; anything else
---
That‚Äôs your opinion. Imagine buying something and enjoying it, and then the devs just stealing it from you and replacing it for something totally different just because a couple unskilled noobs couldn‚Äôt get good with him.
---
I want this to be a perk instead of an offering. 
---
It would be a nice effect, but be a gamble, because there‚Äôs a handful of maps that can only have one basement spawn.
---
Holy shit this is either a complete joke or just fucking pathetic
---
That comic was a direct sequel to the film.
---
All killers need serious nerfs, getting a 4k should be an accomplishment, right now it's an accomplishment for survivors to NOT get 4kd.
---
Reuse*
---
What other maps are even there apart from The Game? Most maps have "main building" and killer shack spawns.
---
Mad cause bad?
---
Strange that you think one of the weakest killers needs a nerf.
---
The Carbines have always been my choice in both Titanfalls. The ROF and impact really feels nice to me
---
Can I offer a tissue?
---
At this point I'd just like to get in a game as Killer, SWF or not.
---
the title is worth more than I could imagine. almost spit out laughing.
---
You post on this subreddit 20 times a day so and masturbate to nea porn, so yeah I'm probably not as invested as you.  It's no much that killers are overpowered as I think that it's pretty self evident, I'm just amazed at how killer mains delude themselves into thinking they aren't playing the game on peaceful difficulty.
---
Incorrect. I used old Freddy, buddy. Used him in red ranks, all the time. I used him fine, but he was without a doubt the worst killer in the game, requiring the upmost skill to do even decent with him. He sucked. 
---
Sounds like you just can‚Äôt get good with the new Freddy (which like, how?). He is a million times better.
---
I mean, the offering symbol is a joke, but honestly I wouldn't see this as a bad idea if we're being serious.
---
It should give a double pip if you get a 4k through sacrifice. The emblem system just doesn't work
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre not good
---
Idea for a MoM change:
---
To activate the perk, you need 4 tokens. Prot hits give 2 tokens while normal hits give 1 token.
---
You do know Ghostface isn't just an "ez win dud" killer, right?
---
Meg porn &gt; Nea porn ü§òüèø
---
Fabulous idea, and I also like all the new survivor portraits!
---
There's already OP and everyone in chat, so it's a gamble
---
Yes I am
---
Mikey isn't one of the weakest killers, he's mid tier at worst.
---
Even then man, a rank 8 against a rank 3? That‚Äôs 5 rank difference which is pretty far in this game
---
He's saying he's screwed because he's the Obsession.
---
Little does he realize that the Obsession is often the safest person in the match.
---
It's within 6 ranks, matchmaking works that way to keep ques from literally being infinite
---
100 percent pure mad cuz bad. Love it
---
There's OP, first surv, second surv, and killer by my count. Debatably third surv but i'll let him slide.
---
As if this isn‚Äôt the sincere opinion of like 60 percent or survivor mains
---
You are entering DS territory there
---
As somebody who has thousands of hours as both sides... Ghost Face feels broken to play. I consistently dominate survivors with him more than any other killer. He's not broken In an overpowered sense. But in a glitchy inconsistent sense. He's the only reason I will DC as Survivor.
---
Probably SWF with the rank 8 which would make this a normal / expected matchmaking.
---
Or safe unhooks?
---
Survivor portraits are from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/PerkByDaylight/comments/e7t57f/custom_portraits_v34_cursed_legacy_cosmetics_kate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)
---
...It does
---
Why do ppl want to keep adding stuff that helps the KILLER ?? smfhhhh....what more you guys want !!!!
---
That's a weird way to spell Quentin
---
I will agree with you on that. Flip-Flop is conceptually fine but I do think it needs some work. It could perhaps increase your base wiggle speed, or could perhaps be merged with Boil Over? &gt;!Tbh I'd be fine with Boil Over still having the hook hiding effect but also increasing your wiggle speed by 10%/15%/20%. Flip-Flop meanwhile could have the increased wiggle movement effect of Boil Over along with the recovery = struggle.!&lt;
---
But definitely the percentage of recovery converted into struggle needs to be increased. It's ridiculous that being slugged for 30 seconds only buys you 8 seconds of wiggle time. Granted it's more of a problem with the general hook density on maps than Flip-Flop being OP. I think they could easily increase the percentage of converted recovery to 75% - if you're slugged to the point that you can fully recover the Killer will have 4 seconds to hook you, which sounds bad but is still manageable, and again: this implies that you were slugged for *half a minute.* If we consider the more realistic number of you being slugged for about 10 seconds this would still buy you 4 seconds to potentially wiggle off.
---
If you're slugged up to the point that you can fully recover the Killer should risk losing their kill. There is perhaps some abuse that can be done with other anti-slug perks but if someone wants to run Flip-Flop along with Tenacity / Unbreakable and they get slugged then the Killer has no one to blame but themselves for letting the guy with *two* anti-slug perks get into the exact position he wants.
---
Except the team does lose altruism points for not getting someone off the hook
---
You lose altruism for hooked survivors and the team as a whole gets it back when the unhook happens and the saver gets a bonus if it‚Äôs safe, but if there‚Äôs no unhook the points are just lost
---
God yes please!
---
Assuming this isn't bait, that's Ivory Mori, and it's also overpowered. If a survivor is giving you trouble, go hook another one.
---
Prolly for the christmas event.
---
I like to give most people the benefit of the doubt. 
---
Like, it‚Äôs impossible for EVERYONE to be dumb.
---
The Master had a point as well, it's just that he lacked a (very critical) piece of information as to why he was screwing humans over instead of giving them a new lease on life.
---
There's really no way of knowing if Humans are going to stay as humans over the course of the years, being exposed to as much radiation as they have been and with the things changing people being introduced so often (Harold to name a huge one). Can't really blame a guy for trying to jumpstart the process in a way that makes people faster, stronger, and more resilient.
---
Just as long as escaping should automatically give a pip. Change my mind.
---
EDIT: I agree about the 4K though. (Or at LEAST a black pip. You should never depip for a 4K or escape)
---
&gt;Funny how the game still runs like shit
---
Optimizing is a process, not a magic button that they can press. 
---
Also, with all these small changes to the engine, the game looks a lot better but without requiring extra power from your hardware.
---
I don't understand why people love talk shit about DBD or the devs even when they don't have the minimum knowledge on the matter.
---
Me as any killer when theres one more person alive. I always give hatch if i do well and they‚Äôre playing nice
---
This is what everyone thought the balanced landing nerfs were going to be
---
I got to watch puppers play dbd at pax east last year. I was SUPPOSED to play against him but i let a girl in a wheelchair go ahead of me. He picked billy and everybody had no perks. He slaughtered them lmao
---
says the killer main
---
Well some people will take a pic and put it in blender and trace right over that, but i just guessed. Went in game and took a bunch of screenshots and referenced them.
---
Rotten Fields and Haddonfield
---
You‚Äôre the one trying to say ‚Äúit‚Äôs constant‚Äù which it isn‚Äôt because there are variables that effects how much evil he earns, one example of which could be distance or the amount of survivors he is stalking. Let‚Äôs say for example if he is stalking one survivor far away then he earns less evil, but if he is stalking one survivor on a gen through a window and is relatively close to the survivor then he gets greatly more evil. It is not constant because there are variables that change it.
---
Hmmm...interesting. I'll have to look into that next time I play Demogorgon.
---
Omg a fellow new Mexican I had no idea
---
The third panel is so good, the grin on the mask actually looks like it has a dimple
---
With Urban Evasion maybe he can avoid the 783rd nerf he‚Äôll be getting.
---
But at the same time, he was backstabbing himself in a sense. With his FEV, the wasteland would surely fight back against him and reject it, killing off mostly any supermutants they would come across to rid themselves of them and of The Master. If it weren't for the protag, the wasteland would have been a bigger scarred battleground than it already was. Plus, he just looked really fucking ugly.
---
But with Self Heal he can spam himself with blood orbs
---
I wanna a mall that would be cool. Hawkins is cool and all but I want a mall
---
Played 3 games tonight, rank 3-5-9 killers and they all camped and tunneled if you got them off the hook. I went and played another game, Sunday‚Äôs are always so toxic on PS4 for some reason...
---
Finding survivors awards a *small* amount of points in Chaser. The Survivors Found is showing how many points in Chaser were awarded for finding survivors, it does not actually display how many survivors you found.
---
True facts.
---
You're obviously low rank.
---
shut fuck
---
Do you play exclusively Claudette and hide and bushes and scream like someone who didn't get their chicken nuggies once you get found? Bet so.
---
Make sure to apply it directly to the fivehead of every bubba you see fucker has been camping me non-stop
---
So shadowborn during beta?
---
Nice, can't counter the points and so try to pull rank.
---
I'm actually a red rank survivor, purple rank killer and while I typically think that rank isn't an indication of skill you were the one who brought this up.
---
Myers is a decent Killer, and is one of the better Killers to pick up in order to learn the game. He's not a top rank killer at all. But he's definitely not the worst, and the fact that you think so just means you definitely don't know how to use him.
---
You're just mad, because bad.
---
There‚Äôs basement protector. Cut coin and insidious. Ensure nobody loots the basement chest. That‚Äôs your chest.
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Michael_Myers
---
Go to the wiki article click on load out and there you shall find a explanation of the power and if you read all the way through it will say that more than one survivor can be stalked at once.
---
Playing killer is crazy easy against shit survivors yea I agree
---
:)
---
MiChAeL iS aN S tIeR kILlEr.
---
Speak for yourself not for others.
---
casual mode always gets filled by the assholes who want to stomp new people.
---
Nice finger nail
---
Bs tho cuz im a trash killer and everyone is toxic i hate this game sometimes
---
I miss your mom?
---
And where did I say that?
---
That‚Äôs cute
---
It can trigger on the speed boost granted by being injured as well.
---
The fact that I cant' see part 3/4 makes this more hilarious.
---
You think Michael is good when he isn't. Are you saying you agree that he's one of the worst killers then?
---
Lol it looks like it was my cats claw
---
Considering rank 20 to 16 aren't even affected by matchmaking, you still managed to get survivors within 6 ranks of yours, which is normal matchmaking.
---
I wish people stopped posting these screenshots showing normal matchmaking and saying "feels bad" or "nice matchmaking". These are all normal.
---
Good survivors usually know when they're up against a low rank killer since I wasn't even close to hitting 100% of my hits with them. Either way, that's no excuse to be a d\*ck survivor. If a killer is being toxic to you (because I know there are toxic killers too), then yeah, I don't blame you being toxic back. But when a killer isn't being toxic to you, then just play the game and leave. There's no reason to absolutely stomp while teabagging at pallets the whole game, and then 99 the exit gate to bully me more.
---
Myers isn‚Äôt D tier
---
Using Iridescent Head should not guarantee a pip.
---
In a proper ranking system when you roll some one of inferior skill your rating doesn't change very much if at all because it's not really a sign that you're doing better.
---
DBD doesn't have that, so instead you just get the Brutal Killer when you turbo 4K as an approximation of a better system.
---
They removed him and Quentin bc wes cravens company got the rights back you should watch Paulie Esther's video on it
---
Love it
---
Dude, he's not amazing, he's not bad, he's fine. 
---
The game isn't black and white, there's a lot of wiggle room between "S-Tier" and "F-Tier".
---
Michael is solidly B tier.
---
so a killer gets a good 3 gen going and they just win instantly? no thanks
---
Dude I can‚Äôt find a game as survivor but I find a game as killer in like 2 seconds. Xbox by the way.
---
Didn‚Äôt say they would be best perks in the game. But they wouldn‚Äôt be active poison which is what they are now. I‚Äôll take ‚ÄúOnly good if you don‚Äôt have anything better‚Äù over ‚ÄúYou have nothing. Here‚Äôs more nothing.‚Äù
---
He definitely is.
---
‚ÄúIf a game makes me mad, it‚Äôs not a game anymore.‚Äù     - words from an unknown wise man
---
They‚Äôd at least a way to prevent a three gen there‚Äôs no way to prevent survivors being absolute dicks and just hiding bc they‚Äôre gonna lose
---
No you‚Äôre either trolling or just bad at him.
---
MLG!
---
I've never played against any streamers I know of other than tru3 a few times (and a guy that Otz said was good but... he wasn't) so far, even though I'm always rank 1, which is kinda a bummer, because I wanna see if it's any more difficult or easy from the average player.
---
Then again, I hate playing against Trapper, so maybe it's for the better.
---
Ah another man who uses the mastiff what a rarity these days
---
He is D tier at most.
---
whats the music at 005
---
When you realize you‚Äôre on console...
---
You need to get gud so you can understand.
---
Well if you can take advantage of a stealth killer who can stalk to insta down (like myers, but with infinite stalk, can crouch and with a survivor literally choosing between a free hit or a insta down, without any possibility of a 3rd option), then you are pretty bad
---
Maybe not stupid, maybe just next level IQ
---
I wouldn't be surprised either. And I know not every survivor/killer is toxic, regardless of rank. I've had rank 20 survivors teabag me. The point was, I was frustrated through the multiple matches (in a row) I went through where they were higher ranked than I was by a lot, and then the straw that broke the camel's back, was having them all be toxic SWF group (thus this post is a rant). Like I said, I don't mind losing or being stomped in a match. I'm not supposed to win every match, but it's the toxicity that I absolutely hate.
---
Ok I‚Äôve done it once but it was because I was playing Hag for her Perks and I was at rank one... ended up back at rank one within a week. (Plz help I can‚Äôt stop getting Rank one me no like)
---
Haha, laughed the fat conductor.
---
You are wrong.
---
Yeah, that's not a great option... monitor color profiles are supposed to do that, though: they assign RGB values to pixel brightness, so a properly configured profile should be able to do that, right? Hopefully that sort of thing can be developed more.
---
As a survivvior main, I am confused
---
i mean the toolbox is still worth tbh
---
Can‚Äôt say I haven‚Äôt tried that
---
Yes that is
---
Calm down there tiger. I don‚Äôt like doing it personally, like i said- i only get on it when my account (Main one - rank 3) Gets suspended :‚Äô) Why are you so pissed off anyway? Most of the time i kill myself for them, and sometimes i do half a gen then hide in a locker. Sometimes i try to fuck with them other times i befriend them. My acc is no longer suspended and i‚Äôm happy that way. Will no longer let strangers talk to me fully knowing i have a short temper. ‚ò†Ô∏è Good‚Äôay now üëã
---
Big brain time.
---
I main Pantless Myers and if just enough of you is sticking out I can stalk you without any problems and sometimes I can even stalk through holes or cracks but at a very slow rate like if they are far. Now if your running the memorial letter it loads you up quick even if they are far but are hard to get off the webs at times... 
---
I laugh when they wanna try to loop at pallets and I just sit and stalk them
---
I wouldn't be smiling, I'd be shitting my pants. He's very nice, and he's one of my favorite streamers/Youtubers, but he is also *very* good at DbD.
---
&gt;Good survivors usually know when they're up against a low rank killer since I didn't hit 100% of my hits with them. Either way, that's no excuse to be a d*ck survivor. If a killer is being toxic to you (because I know there are toxic killers too), then yeah, I don't blame you being toxic back. But when a killer isn't being toxic to you, then just play the game and leave. There's no reason to absolutely stomp while teabagging at pallets the whole game, and then 99 the exit gate to bully me more.
---
I play quite a lot of survivor and is not that rare to find god awful killers at red ranks that look like they just installed the game. From their perk setup to the way they play. 
---
I literally yawn every time I read the word "toxic" in this community. There is very little a killer or survivor can do mid match that is "toxic". Survivors tbagging is funny if anything. Not to mention it often means they won't last 10s in a chase. 
---
Finally, if you want the match to be over just open the exit gate yourself instead of complaining they 99ed to "bully you more".
---
"I'm just happy to be here!"
---
You‚Äôre the one struggling to play myers but ok
---
I literally once did this when one guy told he was farming. He got so mad and messaged me in ps4 üòÇ
---
Don't worry friend, it only gets worse. Rank 9 on pc, full red rank teams fill 80% of my killer lobbies.
---
Dude I love it so much and I love you keep making art it‚Äôs really pretty ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Because when you botch a skill check on the generator, it makes a loud explosion sound that the killer can hear, and then they'll find you if you don't get movin'
---
:/ i dont know how to feel about this
---
trust me my man after a certain while you will see a entity displeased with a 4k as a win and a rank up as a reason to be angry
---
‚ÄúLol what are you gonna do just stand there while I t-bag you‚Äù
---
Y E S
---
Ok?
---
Yes, because they don't like being wrong.
---
No shit they dont. Thats an insult. And thats why he used it.
---
Then symmetrically had a game as survivor where people we being down in seconds cuz they didn‚Äôt do gens when ruin is up
---
Wraith isn't that great anyways so don't feel too bad lol
---
i noticed wraith's used to take a while to load

You realize most of the killers asking for help are survivor mains? It's why they need the help.
---
You are toxic, you deserve it. Stop acting entitled.
---
I play mostly doctor, and I play low (15+) ranks on both. I don‚Äôt play the game as much as I used to. Queue times are measured in the seconds for me.
---
Holy crap, Otzdarva follows this channel? I think there might be something to this shit
---
That's a lot. Especially if ruin is up. Pop is considered a great perk and it takes 20 seconds off. Than has the advantage of being passive.
---
True but he is fun to bong bong people
---
You came to the wrong neighborhood  motherfucker.
---
As a Steve and Ghostface main, I agree.
---
Should have Dead Harder
---
That‚Äôs ppl say about survivors too lol. Ig nobody should play after rank reset at all. We all just collectively delete the game because rank reset is brutal (jk I love the game too much)
---
maybe theyre just for filler on the bloodweb or else thered just be too many of teh common killer addons
---
Classic
---
Still same old 1-2 survivor min waiting time and 5 hour killer waiting time for me. 
---
Might‚Äôve been the update if it was fine just a bit ago, that‚Äôs my best guess.
---
But I like challenge. Why you haff to complain about challenge? In fact, this is too generous since it give 1 attempt. They should make it a secret tome challenge where only people that did the challenge 2 years ago receive reward. God, I hate people complaining about challenge, big sissys don't like challenge. Challenge goooood, now don't tell me otherwise. You have no right to hold any opinion except challenge good.
---
-- Lol, the above is like half of this subreddit and Twitter. Some people don't seem to realize less grind is almost always GOOD, and some challenges should be made easier. If seasoned players have trouble with it, then imagine what the newbie's are going through. I don't think any games battle pass is or should be meant for 3% of hardcore players who like challenges to complete... because then noone would buy the battle pass and the game would get little money....
---
Every time I find out I'm playing against wraith I just think "awesome it's just the wraith I should have an easy game"
---
i still remember when i got 4 swf all with the tank build (mom, adrenaline, ds, dead hard and insta heals)
---
almost uninstalled lmao
---
OK Doctor.
---
This post was down voted by khaki shorts gang
---
I‚Äôve never laughed so hard in this sub! I‚Äôm as dead as that pig
---
Havnt played in a while but when did they buff him from one of the worst?
---
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been saying from the beginning. I knew this would happen. Killers either message and ask if I‚Äôll help with their challenge, or they just go hardcore on everyone. I mean I love the idea of doing challenges and getting rewards, but there‚Äôs way too many toxic members in this community
---
Holy shit.
---
Very very very cute
---
It seems longer to me, and every time I go load a killer one I‚Äôm instantly in it and four people are already waiting for me. I just found it so weird. 
---
I was wondering if it was something like that.
---
I hope this is just another joke.
---
He is high tier I agree, but he already has so many counters to him I think nerfing him would just cripple him so much. The only thing I could think of that might be more balanced is getting rid of collision while he‚Äôs invisible so he can‚Äôt body-block you from a pallet or into a corner.
---
No, he is still a low tier killer.
---
One will strangle you, one with electrify you, this is a perfect oppertunity for torture P*rn...... i also love your art, i would encourage you to do future art.
---
Killer, wait times are less than 2 minutes.
---
It already reduces the charge time, which is currently already the weakest part of his power even with default speed.
---
That‚Äôs the same cosmetic set I use.  As for the weapon, I‚Äôve been using the Mossy Sword and the Prestige Weapon. Swapping parts out for his new set coming out later on.
---
For context I was stuck in this the whole match. I entered a locker somehow and this happened. Couldn‚Äôt move, couldn‚Äôt kill myself on hook. I was stuck in this no mans land of hell.
---
Give him some festive light wires wrapped around his arms, legs and neck. Or just body only.
---
It will do nicely.
---
Ok *DEGENERATE*
---
Lemme fix that for you , "If either side brings any addons, items, perks or offerings, the side that brought them deserves to auto-depip because they choose to use a mechanic provided to them in the game" There perfectly balanced just like your delusional fantasies.
---
Check out his previous threads.
---
If a killer is too good, find another match?
---
Dwight gives his whole life up
---
Most Obsession perks the Killer has makes the Killer not want to do anything about the Obsession since attacking them makes the perk go away (Save the Best for Last), killing the Obsession disables the perk (Play with your Food, Dying Light), hit the Obsession and leave (Dark Devotion), or flat out causes you to ignore the Obsession until the end (Rancor).
---
The only perk that makes you want to go after the Obsession is Remember Me, and no one runs that.
---
The only time you're ever really screwed as the Obsession is if the Killer doesn't have any Obsession perks (So the Survivors are running DS) and the Killer just flat out doesn't care about the status. If that's the case you're not getting any special protection from the status.
---
This...is AMAZING!
---
Claudette, Claudette, and last but not least Claudette.
---
Pizza boi dwighty, shirtless david and fat jesus
---
Yeah. Flop flop should definitely get a recovery speed buff. Without it it's overshadowed by unbreakable. :/
---
Nani!?
---
I love player commentary! this was a joy to watch haha, good editing (if a bit jarring cos it's so dark a map!)
---
Blight doctor is even worse in my opinion
---
Ron paul, tony hawk, and flea
---
Cross out run paul and put jackie chan. He's survived a lot of things lol
---
Why are you booing him? There is literally a graph made by DbD devs showing the safest/most dangerous maps for survivors, as well as which killers get the highest/lowest kills per game in certain ranks. Freddy is highest for red, while nurse is lowest.
---
To be fair, Tru3's build is viable in Red Ranks, but even then it's not "too easy to win with" or "Too strong". Joey's just a troll who doesn't know what he's talking about.
---
The dead give away is "Hours don't care about facts or feelings". Just downvote and move on, he's not even a good troll.
---
"Good morning! Vault-Tec calling!"

It would have cost you $0 not to post this

Its most likely that its programmed as

I probably would sound pretty crazy if Ebony Mori wasn't distinctly overpowered. This sub makes me lose brain cells.
---
Good idea.
---
If you cant beat em, *Join em*.
---
What's OP about him? 
---
\- You can see a shimmer when he's cloaked
---
\- His bell makes a noise when he's coming out of cloak
---
\- Uncloaking takes a while even with good add-ons equipped
---
\- The only thing he has to end chases is his bell which requires you to mind game 
---
What rank are you that you think that Wraith is OP?
---
And now a survivor main will make the same meme but with NOED/Ruin instead of DS
---
Those rare times I do get mom, I forget about the aura part. someone heals me and now I'm visible to the killer untill he downs me.
---
If a killer is too good, do generators while your teammates loop.
---
Try summoners war and suggesting certain changes I'd you want a drink of toxicity. Or go to the Steven universe sub and write "Pink diamond Was okay".
---
You obviously don't know how to play survivor if you think Wraith is op
---
lol the real babes are kate, then meg, then nea. if laurie doesn't count due to her lack of outfit options, which is no fun
---
I thought it included Demogorgon?
---
You've been posting threads fairly frequently lately calling for nerfs, buffs, and changes to aspects of the game. Most of these threads offer little to no valuable arguments to support your suggestions. In this case, you've offered us no details on these "oppressive" Wraith builds or what makes them have no counter play. Perhaps if you're willing to elaborate, we can offer some tips on how you can be more successful when playing against him.
---
Just because you've either experienced it as killer or survivor, witnessed, or heard of gameplay where the killer was a tough opponent doesn't mean they should be nerfed. Many people do well against the Wraith on a regular basis, maybe so much that he's generally regarded as a lower tiered killer.
---
Is it possible to do well with the Wraith as a killer? Of course it is, but people can excel with even the lowest tiered killers.
---
that was a long post. teh answer of how to enjoy killer is: just BBQ them but let them live. rank sucks, and gives you too hard a time than is worth it at higher ranks. just play for fun. i'm always rank 17 and i get ppl around rank 15, BBQ them, let them live, we get ~20k points each. after i BBQ all 4 of them, i just hunt and hit them only if they're not injured. for perks use BBQ, Ruin, Nurse's Calling, and NOED. the downside is it doesn't show the status of whether someone was already hooked once or not. so you have to constantly memorize who still needs to get hooked, until all 4 are. you get used to it though. i often repeat to myself, for example, "just do 1 and 3" (referring to whichever survivor from 1-4 at the bottom left). i'd never play any other way.
---
You can't see him if cloaked from certain angle.
---
No terror radius while cloaked.
---
Easy first hit.
---
Easy to come back when healing for second hit.
---
OP at red ranks
---
I play Wraith and he's too easy to win with.
---
He's braiding her hair. They are best of friends.
---
I Play on ps4 and These so called "DEDICATED SERVERS" are fucking Garbage man I takes 5 to 10 minutes for me to find a Game with survivor and seconds for a Killer to get into a Match
---
For some ODD REASON Killers can hit you through a fucking Pallet and Window, for some reason every time I fast vault anything it sucks me back into the Pallt or Window for the killer to get a Easy hit 
---
Fucking ANNOYING
---
Some time ago the number of gens was determinated by the amount of survivors on the match.
---
4 survivors - 5 gens
---
3 survivors - 4 gens
---
2 survivors - 3 gens
---
1 survivor   - **2 gens**
---
notice that when there is only one survivor he would need to do 2 gens. This means that the game also counts killers. So this means that the gamenuses a basic formula to determine the amount of gens. In conclusion:
---
4 survivors + 1 killer = 5 gens
---
1 survivor + 1 killer = 2 gens
---
**4 survivors + 2 killers = 6 gens**
---
Even though that the game now will end a match if there is less than 4 survivors, the formula still exists
---
Is the guy om the bottom right sleeping or jerking off?
---
D-Strike would be that "we're the rats" video.
---
I don‚Äôt need to. If it works on Bubba, it can work on anybody else. 
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter how ‚Äúgood‚Äù he may be with Bubba. The character has limits and has no power until real players.
---
For "ad hominem" to be appropriate, you'd have to be providing some kind of proper arguments in the original topic. You haven't.
---
When you run blood warden and there‚Äôs less than 60 seconds on the end game timer.
---
So let me get this straight  , OP tried to insult the killer but OP got butthurt when the killer insulted him back ?
---
after actually reading ur post: remember that one point ur missing is the slowdown that occurs when u do actually down and hook ppl. so the point is to down or hook as many ppl as possible as quickly as u can. teh 4 perks i mentioned are probably best for that. even NOED can help to completely turn a game around at the latest phase. at higher ranks, play as dirty as u want, too. for example using hag's teleport on a hook and grabbing the person who tries to unhook the person
---
Kate Ash and steve
---
I know a match could start with less than 5 gens some time ago but idk why they programmed more than 5 generators in
---
Just adds salt to the wond.

Shadowborn and Monitor &amp; Abuse be like:
---
Jane, Yui and Jeff, clearly. Maybe Jake in there somewhere.
---
The higher rank you go the worse it gets. I‚Äôm a rank 10 killer and I find matches in like 2/3 mins. Compared to survivor it seems like ages.
---
Haha yeah I bet that feels good! Only have blood warden on freddy atm but looking forward to mess around with it :D
---
At any given time, DBD can get, *Wild*.
---
I just said some realy dumb things and laughed ironically and this man just straigh up was racist. So yeah I got upset he was an asshole
---
I fuck my shit
---
Nice ad hominem. But no, he's too tier. You may just not be good enough at playing killer to realize that.
---
You definitely play survivor. Most survivors are bringing in the meta builds and all the good items. most of them are pretty decent. 
---
I don‚Äôt see killers bring as much dumb shit and not all of them play spirit.
---
You don't even know what it means I see. You can't attack my argument, because it's the truth. So you have to try and attack my character instead.
---
That's called sophistry.
---
You were killed by Gravity.
---
&gt;!Also, what was going on with your teams? An everyday struggle against Legion match?!&lt;
---
Would love to play Killer more often but... Queue times are pretty damn shit
---
What do you mean you can't see him from a certain angle??? There is no angle where he's completely invisible and the you saying that makes me seriously doubt you're in red ranks. 
---
After that first hit he's going to have trouble actually killing the person. You only have mind games after that making you just as good as every other killer.
---
If they heal at a pallet you won't be getting a second hit. And if a teammate heals them they can easily body block and take a hit. 
---
Wraith is just as good as all of the other M1 killers.
---
She was really convincing. I didn't see her until you pointed it out. 
---
How do you do fellow survivors?
---
That's the issue I run into when I play killer. At higher ranks everyone just hook bombs with BT, has decisive strike so they're invulnerable for 1 min, and then everyone can loop so if you're not playing a killer that can out play loops you're screwed. I know that playing dirty is a good way to secure wins, and I do it against toxic people who try to bully me when I play nice. But I can't bring myself to have 2 people down and decide "fuck it, I'll just slug for the 4k". I know how much it sucks and I'd hate to do it to innocent survivors just trying to play. 
---
My main goal is not to be rank 1 always, I want to have fun and let survivors have fun, but fuck is it hard to have fun as killer when 99% of the things you do are based on if the survivors make a mistake or don't do the objective.
---
Oh, well that's no good. I'll look up the video. Thanks for the information!
---
I have Spirit's Fury on her. Wanna give it a taste?
---
Yeah some of the rarities don‚Äôt really make sense on the BP offerings but they‚Äôre an easy way to get a few thousand extra bloodpoints so I like them
---
What a lad, he uses Classic Ghostface too!
---
They didnt program. Its just a simple formula. What they did't program is a limit for this formula. So as long as the amount of gens isn't bigger that the amount of possible gens locations the game should work fine
---
That‚Äôs why stillness crows exist.

And I play both sides and can say that a good survivor can deal with Wraith easily. If you know how to loop (which since you claim to be in red ranks most survivors know how to loop) you can easily deal with him.
---
Getting a 4K should automatically *save* your rank.

Dedicated servers, amirite?
---
You would probably only get 50,000 BP
---
As a legion main that has a lot of success with them as a killer I enjoy every match where someone underestimates legion and fucks around not realizing it‚Äôs probably not the best idea until you get a feel for how someone plays as that killer. For instance I played against a 4 man swf last night and they kept tbagging and randomly clicking their flashlights until I killed two of them in the first 7 minutes or so.
---
A good survivor can only win against Wraith easily if it's a bad Wraith player.
---
The teabagging never stops. Not with this one.        
---
This is how ghost face is meant to be played.
---
Words best lives by. It's why i stopped playing this game a year back IT was making me mad. But now in having fun! GIMME MORE BOLD PLAYS!
---
Nope, he's [better.](https://youtu.be/CPa0zxhF_64)
---
If they didn't program it then it wouldn't exist, the game isn't an IA, someone added that mechanic in for some reason
---
This immediately reminded me of [this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofV_iFBw2YE)

---
The difference is that I go to parties with people I like and have personal emotional investment in, they're not strangers spouting disinformation on Reddit like it's okay to be afk in a competitive game, but people I'm invested in.
---
If you think it is okay to be afk in a competitive or cooperative game, I hope you're prepared to take your beef up with every single publisher of every single popular game in the world that either punishes you for being afk (League, for example) or allows its users to kick you without penalty if you're afk (pretty much any party-based MMO system, including FF14, and Warcraft) or even disconnect you automatically for being afk.
---
OP considering it salty "salty behavior" to complain at someone/report them for being afk is widely acceptable, like you know, not opening a champagne bottle pointed at someone's face at a party because it can kill them...
---
I'm aware of what it means. I'm saying that you haven't provided any actual arguments. You've said a few things, and not supported those things in any way. So the only thing left to discuss is the lack of quality in the posts.
---
Omg that's great! It really does look like that lmao
---
Well as it stands right now (and take my opinion with a grain of salt because I‚Äôm somewhat new) There aren‚Äôt many perks that modify the wiggle state besides Boil Over (which is useless) Yui‚Äôs new breakout, which does the carried party no good if they have it, and flip flop, which is also pretty bad.  DS isn‚Äôt so much a wiggle perk so much as it is an anti-tunnel perk.  
---
In my opinion, there isn‚Äôt enough to make the wiggle interesting for survivors unless they‚Äôre coordinated enough to pull off a glashlight rescue or distract the killer long enough for someone to wiggle free, of which most killers aren‚Äôt stupid enough tonlet happen.  There are no perks outside of flip flop and breakout that modify the wiggle time, and neither of which are really in the carried person‚Äôs control.
---
Short and sweet. Nea teabagging at exit gate, didn‚Äôt get close enough to the exit, Rancor. 
---
Don‚Äôt always use it but when I do it‚Äôs usually pretty satisfying.
---
Nah, that would too goofy and not making much sense.
---
Nice man! Yeah legion can be good in the right hands fo sho. Just had another game where they t bagged me at the exit but weren't far enough out so when I hit them I just picked them up and hooked them lmao.
---
Survivors don‚Äôt get that they don‚Äôt need to escape to win. The 4 escape is usually just to spite the killer.
---
Just played through it again. Was very fun

what cheesed me was I had dead hard so I could‚Äôve bought more time I just totally mind-fucked myself assuming she was on my ass.

*Kazoo kid starts playing*
---
Kate, Jane, and Dwight
---
Dwight: haha I‚Äôm in danger
---
I'm getting fast lobbies atm so think they changed something. Haha yeah. 
---
Yeah those are the best survivors where they are just good players who don't spam map offerings and brand new parts and flashlight click, t bag etc.. Hard to learn to be a better killer against really toxic surviors except for just not getting annoyed and ignoring the ones who want your attention
---
Yeah red ranks
---
Nurse is the only killer that you must hide from.
---
Half the survivors have useless perks. At least Ash has cool meme builds. Tapp, Quentin, and Ace have nothing.
---
This is fine
---
What do you think?
---
Guys, i found ruin!
---
I want to say sleep but his face implies the second option
---
I just want my sleepy boy on switch. :(
---
Nah, it's your everyday life in an everyday match.
---
It's a living.
---
It's not really the server's fault per se. It's how the game deals with lag now, it's almost always in the killer's favor. Hell, wouldn't surprise me if some killers use mobile hotspot wifi just to get some super easy downs.
---
Quentinx3
---
Oh, I have. You just choose to attack my character instead of analyze my argument. It's very disingenuous.
---
Shattered bloodline would probably make the best movie.
---
I wouldn't mind a cheesy slasher featuring the Legion though.
---
Just don't lunge
---
What's this. A killer all salty because " survs are being dicks"  üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
This chest spawn triggers my giddies.
---
Then killer uses noed 
---
MoM survivors: WOW REWARDED FOR LOSING GOOD JOB
---
Haha I just had the same thing happen! Playing as hag for a challenge (rip framerate) and there is a 3 man swf who picked cold wind farm and had three toolboxes with 2 brand new parts. So I get one of them at the end and set up a perimeter to secure one kill. Anyway aYui rushes in with  borrowed time to unhook so I hit the Yui and then the team mates  try to body block. The Yui gets close to the exit and starts t bagging like crazy thinking they are safe so I hit them and down them. The team mates desperately try to body block but it's too late, I pick her up and hook her and that's her dead on hook.
---
I really like rancor for the information part but can be useful to ignore one survivor and know you can one shot them at the end and get the kill.
---
I‚Äôve never actively gone out of my way to perform badly to derank but as Killer I literally don‚Äôt care if I don‚Äôt pip because the game is considerably less enjoyable at high ranks
---
I main killer and still use ds when I play survivor, I feel like it's an essential because I hit the killer with it every game lol
---
\*m4 dream projection\*
---
A fellow man of culture, I see.
---
Yeah but considering how quick it to lull yourself if your teammates are far away, that seems a little unfair.
---
You mean Dwight, Fairfield and the ex-worker of Pizza What?
---
0 killer hours here, could you explain how?
---
I like how Ash is covering his puppet hand's eyes. Nice touch.
---
What do you mean?
---
ez
---
I'm thinking about getting it just so skill checks sont lag
---
Why would a build/technique for a specific character be just as successful on every other character? You don't build out or play Ghostface the same way you do a Hillbilly, or a Huntress.
---
I'm not defending the position he put Bubba in because my expertise as a killer is not good enough to accurately place the killers, but I'm curious why you're dismissing it so quickly.
---
Jerking off in his sleep?
---
I mean that's literally how the game plays currently. 
---
1 Survivor = 80 seconds base speed
---
2 survivors = 44 seconds
---
That's almost half the speed, at an efficiency loss of 10% from each survivor, totaling to 180% speed. Doing anything over 2 survivors repairing is inefficient as 2 gens with 2 survivors is more pressure than 4 survivors on 1 gen, then transferring to a 2nd gen.
---
Also idk if you know or not but the table I put into my post is the actual in game speeds, cited from the wiki: https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Generators
---
But did you have fun?
---
I would love it but it depends on the people who run the show more then BHVR we still might get more demi skins they gave us alot of steve and nancy skins
---
It truly pissed me off to the point I really don't want to at the game anymore truly something needs to happen with this
---
So how does he play bubba then...? I would imagine it‚Äôs the standard way. There is no ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù way to play Bubba. 
---
I dismiss it because with no add ons, Bubba is the worst killer in the game. He has no power. And there‚Äôs no way in hell that watching him play Bubba would make me think that character is #10.
---
Love hurts sometimes
---
Its funnier if you just imagine Wraith just going "No." then walking away.
---
You've literally only been saying "he's too op" and "you must just be bad" where is your argument?
---
You can still manage with three Survivors if someone disconnects. At least thankfully, you need to drag the game longer though if you want emblem system to register. Each category to be done (x) of seconds of activity and you score.
---
I can tell you it's even managing to do with one Survivor to get all emblems being Iridescent. But oh boy, you'd have to suffer a lot and hope that one person would bear up with your stuff.
---
Wraith is in a canon relationship with the nurse already
---
A streamer who plays the game all the time knows more about how good Wraith is then you.
---
The One S ? Yea, I've noticed the difference from my cousins Ps4. It lags just a bit on the One S, but the majority of the time it's quite smooth...I'm missing great checks for good checks now cuz I'm not use to it going by so fast...on the ps4, I hit greats checks so easily. Lol.....also, you should've gotten. the Xbox on black friday. It was a crazy deal
---
Just like a flat Earther, you ignore sources.
---
If you watch the video, he says Wraith is the third best killer.
---
Big oof. I just have the original xbox one so big rip.
---
cause thats how the game works, survivors control the pace of the game, and as killer u can only stop them (or try), thats why it feels like as a killer u are impotent sometimes, the match goes the way survivors want, they progress, u gotta make them regress
---
I like it.
---
I had an entire reply written out but it didn't post for some reason, so I'm just going to reply with a summarized version as I'm not typing it all out again.
---
Chases do not depend on "how good you are at chasing survivors". Not respecting pallets doesn't work when the survivors realize you're not respecting pallets, and they begin to move to T &amp; L walls near main buildings or killer shack. Also chases actually depend more on the survivor's efficiency. A bad survivor dies fast because they don't know where to go or what to do. Good survivors live because they can chain loops into either god loops or safe pallets. So in this case if you don't respect pallets, they'll target non-pallet based areas like main buildings and jungle gyms. If there is no main building or jungle gym, they stun you and make distance to those safe areas.
---
This isn't a conversation about chases though, as that's a whole different topic unrelated. My point wasn't that every single player is a death squad that will obliterate you on sight with instant gens. My point was that now the general skill level is rising for all players, I'm starting to notice games are become more and more difficult to manage, regardless if I'm playing nurse or bubba. 
---
This is also from the perspective of not tunneling or slugging. Which I stated in the post that you yawned at and read "some of the text". Obviously I can go full Otz and just punish stupid mistakes and 4 man slug into a 4k. But the point of the post was about having fun in an environment that has the potential to be impossible to win in.
---
Good survivors can run you a very long time, which results in 2 outcomes:
---
1. You chase that person for however long and lose tons of gen pressure, but gain gen pressure once you've hooked said player. As 1 of those 3 players will have to come save, leaving 2 people to do gens, 1 of which you'll most likely be chasing. But once that hooked survivor is saved, you now have 3 people not being chased. 2 who could be wasting time healing while 1 does gens. Or you could have all 3 of those people doing gens all over again. Now there is always the option to stick around the hook for the 1 survivor to come save. In this instance you have 2 survivors doing gens and 2 doing nothing. Assuming the survivor unhooks, you have to chase 1 or the other. Assuming there is BT, cause most high rank players run BT. You have to hope that the unhooking survivor has no where to go after the first hit they take, so you can snowball. If they can reach a safe pallet, you're back to 3 survivors who could be doing gens or 2 doing gens and 1 healing. If they can't reach a safe pallet, it's the same outcome, you're back to 3 survivors who could be doing gens or 2 doing gens and 1 healing.
---
2. You leave that person, so now you have essentially just wasted a fair bit of time doing absolutely nothing. The only benefit you gain from this is you now are unpredictable to the other 3 survivors. They don't know where you are, assuming there are no coms, and you can catch people out of position. Though the odds of you being able to completely capitalize on that unpredictability is fairly low against even decent survivors. But those 3 survivors are still working on gens.
---
You completely ignored my other points in the post and directly attacked the one point you wanted to talk about. If you're just going to try to debate the specific point that I even said was only significantly noticeable against higher level players, then maybe you can just stop replying in this chain. I don't want to talk to someone who's main goal is to be cheeky and disrespectful. I'll gladly have a chat about what we both think, but rudeness will catch you a block.
---
This looks more like he was tapping that ass and got caught
---
There is a way to prevent them from appearing.
---
As a ghostie main, I say we can always use some more skins, so hell yeah.
---
You got outplayed son
---
New killer: The Obama
---
I guess your idea of 'viable' is reach rank 1? Or is capable of getting 4k's? Because yeah, every killer is viable from that standpoint, no argument. But it's when, as killer, you have literally no chance in hell to do ANYTHING that could win you the game after not making a single mistake, that you realise how not viable most killers are.
---
Also, yeah builds make the killer in a way that survivors never have to understand. Why do you think the legion change was a hard nerf? Sloppy was pretty much the only thing holding those characters together. Now they stand no chance against half-good players. Every killer is like that: Why would you ever play nurse without aura-reading?
---
I've seen trolls not even trying and doing better than your shitty trolling
---
Bruh, at Target, I got the One S Star Wars bundle ( I wanted the NBA 2K20, but only had SW one) ...it came with 1 month free Game Pass and EA Access...I downloaded Fortnite,Forza Horizon, PES 20, and a shit ton of ther games for free....on top of all this....it came with a $40 Target Gift Card....I missed out last year on BF deals and I told myself i cant miss out again so i saved some money and hit a lick....I also bought a 43 inch 4K HDR V Series Vizio for $120..lmaoooo

z Z z Z Z z Z z Z z z Z z 
---
Gen time is directly related to every other aspect of the game which would be chases, hook time, unhooking, healing, etc. Mentioning just one of these subjects is straight up bias of a not so good player. But have fun discussing this among others equally skilled players. Thankfully the devs know better.
---
Btw, wtf is EA Access? I was a Playstation user so I'm new to Xbox
---
That's what I thought man, you're just going to completely disregard any valid arguments or opinions that differ from yours with childish replies.
---
Enjoy the block, hope to never see people like you on this reddit, you make it a much worse place.
---
Mori spirit tunnel ez
---
... are killers supposed to just 4K every game? Tru3 made plenty of mistakes here, like the guy said. He played far from a perfect game. If you get outplayed, you get outplayed. The ‚Äúpower role‚Äù (hate how everyone insists on saying that) is the better player/ team. Like the dude said, watch Scorpionz, the dude makes pig look really good. Just like Tru3 makes wraith look good, when I can hardly do anything with wraith. Kinda just sounds like you‚Äôre a bad killer if you think half the cast is completely powerless against good survivors
---
I completely understand your point. I said those things ironically.  Next time a killer use a dumb strategy like this guy i will just explain that he can use a better one to make things more challenger. 
---
This guy strategy is literaly camp with tier 3 99ed in the endgame. I was mad cause he killed 2 in the most brainless way. That‚Äôs just boring to play against, but I agree , i shouldn‚Äôt be toxic cause that‚Äôs just going to make the killer hate survivors.
---
Sounds like a bright side of Obama
---
The Yui not crouching was so triggering.
---
^^^^^^.

The first thing I think is, "Oooo extra Survival points!
---
rekt
---
Demogorgon clown and spirit.
---
The rank 8 is within 6 levels of you and it‚Äôs probably a swf lobby so it based matches on the highest level member. So this is normal.
---
I love this! As usual your art is just fantastic, keep it up!
---
adorable. she might need to get that chin checked though.
---
Told this one before, but to put it short: when I was learning freddy I encountered a sweaty 4 man SWF. all gens done in like 3 minuites even with ruin. They decide to be all cocky and taunt me before they even open the gate. Using NOED I down one of them and they open the gate just as I do (starting the timer) I simply continue waiting. When there is about a third left on the timer I pick up and hook him. BLOOD. WARDEN. they quickly get the unhook by just bombing the hook with BT but that didn't save all 4 from getting killed by the timer. As you could imagine, they were SALTY!!! I then see that they are all red ranks. With me at rank 8, perfect matchmaking.
---
Dead hard is the easiest exhaustion perk to counter, just wait it out every time. Even if you don‚Äôt know what they have yet just wait an extra second.
---
Thank you, you are a man of good taste!
---
Just uhh get better. Clearly he was just outplaying you. He‚Äôs at such a high skill level he‚Äôs able to control his ping with his mind.
---
That should be in her base kit tbh.
---
Ghostface and plague are definitely higher than demogorg for sure
---
They just don't agree with your treatment methods, don't worry about them though, they're just unaware of how effective it actually is. They're like anti-vaxxers, so in their best interest you just gotta force the treatments on them.
---
OK BOOMER

To be fair, you‚Äôre asking people to chill out and have a fun time, but if you‚Äôre camping and using noed, you obviously don‚Äôt care much for their fun. Use noed all you want, but don‚Äôt act like you‚Äôre not sweating a bit yourself. I‚Äôm not gonna shame you for your play choices or anything, but that style is very unfun for your opponents, so don‚Äôt expect them to be happy about it. Just saying
---
Points didn‚Äôt count as you only have a couple thousand counted in the top right

When you get them, you won‚Äôt want them, they‚Äôre absolute garbage.

Yeah, I didn't get any BP from the game
---
/u/RiskyUnknown
---
That's not the problem. It has the same problem as the hatch (which shouldn't be in a game BTW)
---
It rewards players for playing poorly. Why would the killer get rewarded for doing nothing?
---
Same goes for the hatch. Why would the survivor have an option to escape if they played poorly?
---
Why does Killer have to have a perfect game in order to have fun?
---
The reason people play Spirit and Nurse so much is because you actually have a chance of doing something that isn't "Pray the Survivors are potatoes or vastly outclassed by you". The vast majority of Killers can't do that, it's literally wait until Survivors get cocky enough to hand you a victory.
---
I've watched Scorpionz. Every single video is a "Stream Highlight" on Youtube and even the videos that should be impressive (Perkless pig on Yamaoka's Estate) aren't because the Survivors clearly aren't good; A Claudette literally let him walk up to her, not crouching, and gave him a free hit. After a David got hit and dropped a pallet immediately afterwards.
---
Killers don't need to 4K every game, but the fact that Survivors can act cocky enough to t-bag or emote at pallets as an example is where this game goes wrong. A good Killer should force the Survivors to be better. A good group of Survivors shouldn't force a killer to sweat bullets in order to win.
---
A town would be cool, I hate all the indoor maps though, every pallet is an unsafe one.
---
There was a wraith player I was up against who, when me and one other survivor were left, thought it was a wise idea to slug both of us and just let us bleed out for however long it took whilst spamming his bell. Bleeding out takes a while so it was infuriating to say the least, I could have just quit but I had an escape cake plus a lot of bloodpoints earned beforehand so I had to stay. Never be like that guy.
---
All the time for quicker queues.
---
Not worth saying. I‚Äôll save you from hearing it
---
It's very funny seeing survivor ego go from 100 to 0 in seconds. Reminds me of a bid from otz where he found a SUPER Toxic 4 man SWF as trapper. He got the 4k without a single gen being done (rip fire up) and in the endgame chat, dead.....silence. They didn't have a word to say. They probably would have bitched so hard if they won judging by their behaviour in game.

---
Ghostface is far, far better than wraith and can make much better builds. Wraith is in no way top 3. Windstorm or silent Bell dosent make him unstoppable. He can be countered with spine chill, premonition and just plain paying attention.

Stealth killers are good in the right hands. Apparently the developers think pig is s+ here. My problem with Ghostface is he has practically no down sides with the right add-ons. You can just move around full speed with no Terror radius and still attack. While Michael Wraith and Pig I'll have to sacrifice something to have a small Terror radius or no Terror radius.
---
Personally I think Ghostface would be fine if he didn't have the stalking ability at all. It feels too much like a rip off of Michael. And it's too glitchy or inconsistent trying to reveal him. No good Ghostface uses it anyway. All it is is another frustration. He can be breaking a pallet and you won't reveal him while staring him down but he can gain progress while looking right at you and you're staring back at him. He should not gain stock progress while you are staring at him. Even so he can just hide behind something for half a second and continue from where he left off while you're out in the open.
---
Sorry for the jumbled mess of words. It's quite late and I could have certainly worded that better but go space is incredibly frustrating and boring to play against. And I feel like I'm unstoppable when playing on him. I think he is the most fun fun and annoying character in the game. Not only that but everyone who plays him seems to be extremely toxic. He is basically the pink-haired Nea of killers. As of right now with how he currently is. I will not be staying in matches with him as I have no fun and no reason or motivation to stay in that match. Especially considering he is around half of the killers I go against and playing against a single killer that often gets very mundane very quickly. Hell I barely see Spirit nurse or hillbilly at the high ranks. Just him practically every game.

But its pizza
---
Just hovered right over that trap like no ones business
---
You've seen the Matrix. Now you know what high level killers know. 
---
Three years ago when I started shit was bananas compared to how it is now, and survivors would argue tooth and nail that it was fine. It's still not fine, but its slowly getting there.
---
I play dbd because I like to make killers suffer, I know it may sound sadistic but it‚Äôs true.....  Well at least like a few players agree with me *coughs in No0b3*
---
Hmmm, and yet, good killers get 3-4ks most game
---
Doesn't do anything anyway
---
Can't decide you want a pet or have a kink.....or both.
---
Ooh, look at this cute, little, flowery, nacked boi
---
All of otzs points were countered. And killers should be of similar balance to one another, that would be optimal.
---
That's why he would need a nerf.
---
Neither does the guy who tagged me
---
Maybe we‚Äôll find out when they release the next tome.
---
Antlers over pants was the consensus
---
Is this whole thing a reference to something? I'm lost.
---
So why is Tru3's word correct over someone else's? Tru3 had his experience with the killer. It's not going to be everyone's. Not everyone has the same play style as he does, but that doesn't necessarily make them bad killers.
---
While Tru3 is a very good killer, his experience and opinion isn't the only one that matters.
---
It's been months since I touched the game
---
 I dunno
---
I do this exact tactic also. Works pretty well.
---
Depends on the colour of your ranking. To keep it simple bronze=1 silver=2 gold=3 iridescent=4
---
red ranks: all 4 emblems need to be iridescent, so 16 points.
---
purple: Need 15 points so 3 iridescent and one gold
---
green and lower: I assume the merciless cap is lowered so it will be about 14  points to get merciless around those ranks
---
TLDR: the best way is to derank till you get to green, or maybe even yellow ranks since merciless at red require all 4 iridescent emblems meaning 16 points, at purple it's 15 points. And I assume green is 14, yellow 13, so it becomes more forgiving because worse survivors and the emblem system is more generous. Read the categories below in how to best obtain emblem scoring:
---
Gatekeeper: Since Oni has no perks that help in gen protection, you will have to resort to just downing and snowballing hard. The best offence is a good defence. Down one survivor and I would proxy camp or chase the first survivor you see and down before the person gets unhooked. To get iridescent is this category is more luck based, and you have to hope survivors don't do gens or they huddle up together all the time, which is BS in the first place. The start of the match is the hardest but honestly, try to make sure you have 3 gens left to be done. if you finish the game with gens not done you get points, so if survivors do more than 2 gens it's probably too late.
---
Sacrifice: Simple, just get like 9 or 10 hooks. The more you hook the better so always try to get 12 hooks cuz some survivors will just DC or kill themselves on hook which will screw you in this category, fun I know...
---
Malicious: similar to Chaser because getting hits gets you points, also hooking survivors multiple times gets you this as well (so no one hooks and that's why trying to get 12 hooks is important. For some stupid reason if a survivor heals you lose points but it minimal so the more you hit the better. Also it's important that you do not let a survivor get out of your grasp when you pick them up, you will lose points. DO NOT GET DECISIVE STRIKED it's bad, if you pick up a survivor and notice you cannot hook them because no hooks, just leave them on the ground. until they get picked up and wait for hooks to respawn if they sabotaged it.
---
Chaser: Hits, just get a shit ton of hits, like 28 hits or something like that (could be less depending on chase times) but just hit a lot. Hit people that have borrowed time, sometimes let people heal just to hit them more. For this one avoid losing points. You Lose points by standing near the hook, I don't know the exact distance but I would stand about 20-24 metres away.
---
So I just attempted this like 4 times, each time I did surprisingly well killing the majority, I did tunnel and camp since that's basically required, because not having information is horrible and the best way is to proxy camp. But honestly the beginning is the most important part. If you don't find survivors, gatekeeper score will be silver or less which will actually cost you the merciless score.  Oni's power is also bad for getting the chaser emblem and malicious because of it's one shot down, you need to get basic hits. so basically... don't use his power... unless you use it for the mobility and then use the swing that doesn't one shot down them.
---
But honestly, it's all luck based. If you get a shit team you can do it, but with the new ranking system where most people will be stuck at purple and red ranks, you're gonna get better teams. Also if you're in red ranks you need 4 iridescent emblems meaning 16 points, iridescent being 4; gold 3; silver2 ; bronze 1; nothing 0, in purple ranks it's 15 points and less I'm pretty sure depending on the colour of your ranking.
---
Well glad we could help you confuse him then.
---
I was against otz and zubat and tru3 dodged my lobby. Otz was trapper lost had only 1 kill. Zubat was Demogorgon he rekt me.
---
Correct
---
Well they are viable within there own intended rank, not all killer are red tank viable.
---
Head On and Botany are already good perks in my opinion.
---
Hi lost, I'm LickWits
---
If you feel that he countered all of Otz's arguments in an airtight way, I feel like you may have missed some of the things Otz said.
---
As an aside, I think the videos these two made were to promote discussion. They're not claiming to be the one source of truth.
---
Same.  But that's just like work for me lol
---
Nope, that would make legion good don‚Äôt be silly the devs hate them.
---
These are the ONLY three games that i have currently on my ps4 :0
---
I'm trying to make them viable not op. Obviously not all of my suggestions are the greatest solution ever. What would you change?
---
If que times are doable I‚Äôd love to see that! Playing solo killer is so lonely... especially when you‚Äôre against a group of toxic swfs :(
---
r/okbuddydaylight
---
Oh cool, so because they're ranked 20 I'm fucked every time I press the ready button. I get more games with ranked 20s than +/- ranks. Worse part is I feel bad for the rank 17 since he was actually trying. I don't remember if this game has a tutorial, pretty sure there is and clearly abusing this system to just grief.
---
Haven't played a single game since fall 2018 but the community and the memes keep me here and on YouTube DBD channels.
---
I uninstalled this game yesterday. I'll probably re-install it in a month or three when they do another balance change, and then I'll probably uninstall it again after three matches.
---
Head on botany and flip flop are all good. Not every perk needs to be insanely strong. Killers need the perk buffs more than survivors.
---
Buffing MoM is really dangerous. It needs that harsh requirement because the effect is way too powerful. Another problem is that you couldn‚Äòt tell someone ran it before its nerf which is the only way of countering the perk. I‚Äòd suggest reverting the changes but in turn add an effect that makes the survivor broken for 45 seconds each time they get into the injured state. Boom you know when someone has it and fulfilling the requirement is harder.
---
Corrupt them all
---
It should be an automatic pip. They need to give more points to the kill.
---
Kinda hard to with the lack of pants
---
There isn‚Äôt abuse, you can‚Äôt derank to 17-20. It‚Äôs all returning players or new.
---
I think we‚Äôll make it and we‚Äôre gonna live forever should merge and be something like for every safe hook, you get a stack, but after unhooking, you still get the 100% increase. I love we‚Äôre gonna live forever for the bp I‚Äôd like to see it merge with any perk tbh just so I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm wasting a perk slot for bp.
---
They don‚Äôt undertake that pipping is all self performance whereas escaping is team effort. 600 can easily make you lose out on 5k from escape
---
Never used those until they changed legion again, last time. So I got sixty - eighty pin adding of each color to use after new change. I am not legion main, but does any one feel like survivors usually overestimate their chances against legion because of the believe that he is worthless? Because I rarely end up killing no one, more oftenly at least murdering 2 - 3 people
---
Well, first of all, fix matchmaking. This entire weekend was basically hell for me. Playing as survivor, I got 7 games straight full of gray ranks with little perks. Playing as killer, I got red and purple rank survivors that I couldn't even hit. :( (Green rank survivor, Yellow rank killer)
---
I wanted to cry this entire weekend:
---
https://imgur.com/a/Ezpa1hd
---
its true. but man, at least nowadays you can win against high level survivors if you are someone like nurse or freddy. in my time i have seen:
---
* Sabotage permanently removing hooks.
---
* Self Care being quick as fuck meaning everyone ran it.
---
* Sprint Burst coming off of a 40 second cooldown.
---
* Borrowed Time applying to both the unhooker and the hooked (free escape if gates were up)
---
* DS being usable by everyone, the first time you get picked up.
---
* Pale Rose being 4x as big as it is now.
---
* No bloodlust OR entity blockers on windows (every map had an infinite)
---
* Claudette being actually invisible on some tiles.
---
* No kicking gens, totem spawn being so bad ruin wasn't even worth running.
---
* Instablind flashlights that were undodgable on the pickup animation (free saves)
---
And other such nonsense. Really I'm just glad i can have decent games every now and then, there are just a handful of OP things survivors have left (instaheals, dead hard having I-frames, Object of Obsession in a SWF, SWF in general, pink keys).
---
There's no way they're new since one has perks. They're just straight up griefing. Hopped on to try and play some dbd to get multiple shitty games in a row and it's not even a shitty balanced game. Every queue I've had it was ranked 20. How in the world was this a good change unless it was worse before
---
OP dont count so good
---
PLEASED READ: ‚ÄúReturning players‚Äù
---
I completely agree, I‚Äôll try my best to remember to comment in the morn cause I do think it‚Äôs a cool topic to discuss/debate.
---
Came out on my 19th birthday üòÖ
---
Seems doable at lvl 16...
---
It is when you have all competent teammates that work on gens when not being chased
---
Yes I understand that's why I'm saying they're not new, so thus they're returning and griefing games and so they're abusing the matchmaking as rank 20 to fuck people over
---
\*Entity Displeased\*
---
I actually imagine a lot of survivors try both fighting back and killing themselves but give up on doing it after it fails time and time again. Though people who kill themselves also might just become husks.
---
That is really interesting &amp; I did not know that! That might explain my difficulty with the challenge
---
Belly shakers
---
Love dbd greatest game ever
---
Unless they changed that since i stopped playing they are invisible, not "hard to see". You could run into one with your drone and wouldnt see it.
---
Before I even saw the part the video was about, I knew it was something to do with the connection cause of the delay with the pallet stun and pallet vault.
---
It is mandatory as a solo player. Don‚Äôt wanna get farmed off hook.
---
Every trapper game when I'm feeling like I wanna win
---
Huntress Huntress and Huntress c:
---
That was really really helpful! It's the only one I'm missing but when I started trying for them I was still in the very lowest rank which explains a lot. 
---
I has a couple more attempts at rank 10 last night but after my 4th game against minimum of 2 red ranks &amp; 2 purple (sometimes as high as 3 red ranks) I called it a night! 
---
Thank you for the advice! :)
---
To commission monster bells or not hmmm
---
‚ÄúYeah, like that‚Äôs ever gonna happen.‚Äù
---
They don't need to make a new one each month.  
---
There are many other thriving communities like Payday 2, Warframe and others who open up the skin making to the community, the best are selected and released. Not only do you get regular new, high quality, content but the community has an impact on the game and often the artists get some sort of credit for their work.
---
I prefer prove thyself since you're guaranteed to be working on generators every game.  No, you may not be working with anybody and the perk is useless.  Although usually after unhooking or at the start of the trial, there are brief periods when you may team up for gen repairs.
---
The additional healing speed is useful, although in regards to chests and hooks, there are usually more productive things you can be doing than helping them out, unless of course they are conveniently next to generators.  The exit gate speed is clutch but again, I think it's better to have a perk that helps you reach the end game phase rather than hoping you reach the EGC to benefit from a perk.  If you wanted a perk like that I think Adrenaline Rush is a better choice.
---
He got two and two escaped that's a fair game no?
---
The hero we deserve but don't need
---
That‚Äôs the beauty of maining Laurie. I get my load out plus everyone assumes I have ds. Not that I ever get to ds anyone in red ranks, but it‚Äôs the perfect cover to have some hook state breathing room
---
Yes my bad, i was thinking of that perk which is better than premonition imo :)
---
Just mentioning that the official obama acc also follows some furry porn artist
---
Legion in Titanfall is a fucking monster. He doesn‚Äôt care about your feelings. He just keeps on shooting...
---
Stop complaining. If you don't want to play it on mobile, then don't. Sometimes people can't shut their pussies down. Your opinion don't matter, girl.

Wtf are you talking about? Spirit &amp; nurse easily S tier. Just because it's picked less, doesn't mean it's bad or weak. As a spirit main, the recent nerf means jack shit to me. I rely entirely on sound as a spirit, the recent decrease in spirit pick are those who abuse the collision. Global phasing sound on prayer beads? Good luck with that PTSD bro. Instead of survivors gen tapping with the old prayer beads, now they're crouching around the bushes instead.

Ahhhh OK I know what you mean now, thanks my friend!
---
Im upset about you guys literally ruining my post over an honest mistake. It got ~40 upvotes the first time around, why would i have posted it again if i remembered it flopped? Ive been in and out of different dbd communities and pages just wanting to share shit but people like you and this whole goddamn toxic community have to make things shitty. I didn't hurt anybody, i didnt steal a post, shit i thought it was stolen from me! Why invest so much time trying to ruin WHOLESOME content? Is it such a bad thing to see her face twice in your life? Its fucking precious.
---
He‚Äôs fun to play, but gets shat on. Adding some sort of lingering effect like plague would be alright. But needs pressure and fast reloads.
---
And the WHOLE comment section is now flooded with people calling me sick and other absurd shit and all i did was post grandmas face a second time on accident. Thats fucking toxic and gross.
---
I'm sorry to tell you, but No0b3 does not agree with you. Unless you're also just doing it as a meme and genuinely care about the killer you're up against.
---
Troll..

Saying "ad hominem" whenever somebody calls out your lack of description or any substance for the argument

Nice bait tho

---
Would mettle still be op if it was reverted but instead of 3 hits it needed 5? I feel like that be a little better
---
Literally it's the responses like this is why good changes are not being made to the game. Tru3 wasn't "outplayed" at all in this video. He did everything right at every loop, he applied gen pressure a great deal that match, and won every battle of skill that did happen. However he lost simply because the claudette's knew where the safe loops were that required no skill, and had no counterplay.  Further examples is that the Claudette's literally standing next to a pallet waiting for him to break it, nodding her head - she knew she had the power role, and she knew Tru3 had no ability to counter it. Then another Claudette didn't make just oen mistake, but several - and never got punished for it, because they are playing the power role. She dropped a pallet on the same side as Tru3 but with the recently updated hit-box you can do that and still stun the killer even though the survivor is between the killer and the pallet.  Then the sugar coating on top was when the bad claud dc'd to stop him from getting points. Tru3 was one silver emblem away from at least a black pip (which he deserved more that round), but because the Claud dc'd (and doesn't get penalized because there still isn't dc penalty) Tru3 doesn't get 2 hook sacrifices to the entity, and doesn't get a silver devout emblem - thus costing him the black pip.
---
So even when a killer does everything correctly, and not only that but succeeds at each test of skill. He de-pip's because everything down to the scoring of the game is in the survivors control.
---
I got all mine for killers during stranger things chapter, but I waited for rank reset for the best chances. And it worked out great... mostly (I actually had a super difficult time with Freddy surprisingly, DC's or just bad luck.)
---
Unfortunately rank reset now only sets you back one colour. Except it's actually worse than that, it sets you back 4 levels, at least for me. I was rank 1 and now rank 5. Red ranks are from 4-1 meaning if I rank up once I'm back at red lol. So I honestly won't be trying for adept Oni unfortunately. I rarely get merciless even with a fantastic build in red ranks just cuz some categories are out of the killer's control on gatekeeper or sacrifice cuz of DC.
---
Personally I am gonna wait till they make some changes to the emblem system maybe fix rank reset but if you wanna keep trying, more power to you and good luck.
---
2 min EGC RNG where gates are 15 seconds to open without remember me hmmm yea no
---
Not a perfect solution, but you could try running stake out? That'll let you know if you're in a radius or not.
---
Last years there was the bloodweb with "presents" to level up quicker and a double BP event after the xmas holidays around new year. My guess is that there will be something similar this year, question is more like "when?" since i couldn't find anything about it
---
What does wake up do again? Sorry
---
Yeah it's better as your not just wasting time, your completely silent at T3 unless the killer had stridor
---
Self care is a shitty perk IW is good
---
Ash above all
---
I was avoiding commenting in case any comments on the post made the OP think the title was true. Anyway, don't do it and definitely listen to ^
---
This isn't dbd related
---
Nah it‚Äòs Ghostface
---
Iron Will is good for stealth builds, and it is faster to heal your ally than it is to heal yourself. There is also Inner Strength (Nancy Lv40), which is only 8 seconds to heal yourself in a locker (after cleansing a totem at any point prior).
---
That is what I am saying they have already said no events as they are working on other things
---
It reveals the exit gates auras and grants bonus speed to opening them
---
If you think Wraith is OP, you need locking up in a mental asylum. He's lower tier because of his lack of map pressure in his base kit. And where is your evidence for your claim? The video of Tru3 doesn't count
---
Ngl, woulda felt bad but idfc about my content my dude it's fucking Reddit. I don't care to see your grandmother's face multiple times in my life I have no reason to care about her. I don't think I'm necessarily toxic, just cause this post seemed and seems like karma whoring since your constant comments about karma and content show that you genuinely care about your karma. I pray for you, for one day you may not care about internet points.
---
If I take a break from killer for a bit or give away some free wins I can get down to lower ranks and then try for it. 
---
I know deranking isnt nice to play lower tier survivors but I think the fact I'm running only ONIs perks is probably refreshing for them instead of the normal ones you seem to see at any rank!
---
my behaviour took place here and idk where to reach out im sorry
---
Yeah i run stake out quite a bit, and ironically on killer I asked Otzdarva in a stream what to use and he said the perk im all ears, and it helps but is also a kick in the face that damn name lol
---
No mate, Dwight has DS.
---
When I see any survivor I expect to be harassed even if I let them win, or even if it's their teams fault they lost.
---
Soapy Steven posted and said where, 8 minutes ago.
---
Literally no one asked, dude
---
Nope!
---
Don't do it, it may seem like a good idea but it isn't the answer. When i tried i regretted it immediately. If you need to talk we are here for you.
---
Because at high ranks, swf is stronger than most killers. If they add more buffs to killers it could be balanced.
---
If I'm trying to let a Survivor go and they do that, I just leave them alone. Can't blame them either, I've had killers act like they're letting me go just for them to grab me off the door and hook my ass
---
No. Gens is your #1 concern, and Prove Thyself gives BP.

This is a sub of one of the most stress inducing games. Why do you seek help here and not get professional help? Posts like these make you wonder if this is a cry for help or a disgusting way to get attention.
---
Iron Will is underrated. It is such a good perk.  
---
I usually don't even bring a med kit. But if I do, sometimes I even forget to heal myself lol  
---
I am so used to *not* healing at this point because of IW.
---
iron will is godtier imo
---
a good killer uses his ears a lot (not just spirit players) and if they don't hear you when you're injured it can work well. especially on p3 claudettes..
---
..that's why i'm considering running stridor.
---
You could hide in a locker all game while the rest of your team tries to play the game and then get out based on their hard work and you‚Äôll pip. There would be many ways to abuse such a system. For example: People could easily queue up with 3 rank 20 ppl that will all get themselves killed instantly, allowing the boosted person to escape for an easy pip.
---
The sad reality is that killers must do everything solo. And if they‚Äôre that much better, be it luck/skill/whatever they shouldn‚Äôt get a negative outcome from it. They should break even.
---
Now if you said ‚Äúescaping shouldn‚Äôt result in de-piping/de-ranking‚Äù I‚Äôd be okay with that to an extent. Survivors shouldn‚Äôt be punished for kiting a killer around all game and escaping. Granted, I don‚Äôt know enough about ranking for survivors, so I dunno how much of an issue that is compared to killers.
---
If you're at low ranks then yes it's easy to 4k as killer. But as you go against more experienced survivors it becomes harder and harder until the point you have to use a "meta" killer
---
more of me being paranoid and wanting to know if the mods still hate me or if the community hates me and idk if i should die and i cant even sleep without wanting to die anymore im sorry man :(
---
Oh no, the player will be very upset by this news.
---
Sure, but that remake was disgustingly bad. I just feel that dbd should done Robert Englund look instead of his, since all it reminds me is a trash remake.
---
Why are you posting this in the survivor reddit
---
you still mad at me :(
---
Wouldn't demo see all Survivors expect Yui as traditional food? Since his dlc like just happened
---
Wow I love it it's super creative and cool keep up the good work! (The mori sounds awesome btw)
---
If I see a Blendette or Meg urban evade at the start of the match, that tells me they're running Sprint Burst and I'm usually right 90% of the time.
---
I mean flip flop is pretty okay its definitely just a woah guess he has that kind of moment not a game changer. MoM at least you can try to get it to proc and it can be funny, Buckle up is stupid you get to see if people are recovering... you can usually just guess correctly in that situation and picking someone up you get to see the killer for 5 seconds...
---
He's got a sophisticated palate
---
Nobody knows who you are on reddit so nobody hates you...
---
Oh wow hahaha
---
When you realize you‚Äôre on Reddit so anything with Otz gets instant 1 Million Reddit internet points! (drooling noise)
---
What a disgusting way to get attention wtf.
---
He follows a furry porn account. Poor dude was so confused
---
I'm the complete opposite I want a god damn survivor match so I can finish part 3 of the tome
---
Every time I call people out for teabagging, their excuse is always "but [insert streamer here] does it". It's basically "Billy's mom let's him stay up late, so I should be able to".
---
Bratty kids are going to be bratty kids. I wish there were a way to reach through the computer and smack them but I just reassure myself that their lives must be far worse than my own if their only outlet is to bully strangers online.
---
I wasn't mad in the first place. Don't deadify yourself, I saw you posted this in 3 other subreddits. I'm sure if I go look at the comments in each one they're not saying "Do it pussy". So, actually listen to the people commenting and don't end your life, however shit it may be. I definitely don't want you dead, and you thought I was mad at you.
---
I mean...... i used to use self care and dont get me wrong it has its times where it can be handy. But that 30 seconds is more than likely better used on a generator or a hex. So ive been using iron will in its place.
---
ive felt the distaste for me everywhere i post
---
If a killer is spending most of their game camping, and it isn‚Äôt because 2-3 survivors are trying to unhook a person in your face, they won‚Äôt be getting enough things done to rank up and it‚Äôll be an easy escape for everyone else. If a killer is facecamping or nearly so, then the other 3 survivors should be able to finish multiple generators by the time that person dies. If they‚Äôre camping, they‚Äôre likely going to tunnel. Better if you just let the person camp or whatever to prevent them from farming emblems. Unless you have BT and other perks to counter farming. The more you actually try and save against a farmer/tunneler without the right setup, the more you‚Äôre boosting those killers.
---
Granted, survivors shouldn‚Äôt de-pip when they dealing with that. BHVR could easily put in a system that would prevent de-ranking due to camping.
---
It says "It's just a Logo"
---
What's bruv?
---
Oh my god this just made my morning, thank you so much haha
---
dwights are either gods or bby dwits that need to be protected
---
I believe so yes.
---
Can't tell you where I know this but I think they do.
---
Could this be any better? I doubt it, looks amazing and super cute man!
---
"would have spent running the killer". That's giving them the idea the dcer was good enough at the game to "run the killer" at all. Which if they are dc'ing than that is the equivelent as throwing in the towel. The killer shouldn't be punished for that, he should be rewarded.  The team who has a quitter should be the only ones hurt by someone dcing - likewise if the killer dc's then all the survivors should receive a black pip, if they havn't already scored the points for a single or double pip (Which is how it already is for survivors when the killer dc's).
---
Yeah because having a title like that makes you look like a troll who jokes about suicide. Stop posting on gaming subs if you want people to take it seriously.
---
3 minutes was way too long when you didn't have to open the gates but if you had to, it would be alright
---
Even if it's for attention it should be treated as serious until proven otherwise.
---
Nah you're right, it's exploiting the trigger to keep the game the same as pre EGC. It was designed to put pressure on the end game so that it wasn't just survivors toying with the killer. They found a way to abuse the way it starts and do that anyway.
---
The killer CAN open a gate themselves, but that almost always guarantees all survivors get anyone unhooked and get to the other 99ed gate while you do that.
---
Gates should just regress after nobody has touched them for a while. You want them open, open them.
---
even the worst survs buy at least 20-30 seconds through 2 hits, and getting picked up and hooked.  You can't just eliminate that time
---
But you can still pip by giving hatch tho
---
Why do you ask us for help when you won't try?
---
 Call those numbers, see if they do you any good. See a therapist.
---
Nobody who really wants to kill themselves says "comment if you want me to kill myself" that is just fucking disgusting, also he posted it to multiple GAMING subs.
---
People like this are fucking disgusting human beings.

Much like you never go on a trip without a spare pair of underwear, you should never go into a game without Iron will. Very useful when things go to shit.
---
Because it's their TEAM. It sucks, but that's just how teams work - that is why games with teams need to have a punishment system for quitters. It sucks, but it's reality. I have seen many games where 3 survivors pulled through, and for the most part they don't. However it's not the Killers job, or concern if someone DC's. Therefore they shouldn't be the one getting the worst result because of a DC.
---
A pip is literally the game saying you win whereas a 4k is just feeling like you won
---
I've literally said on this sub it's possible to get a 4k and de pip or black pip, and I got downvoted and told that's only possible if I camped...
---
i read it as padded jews.
---
The power of cargo shorts compels you:) (yea i used to play shit out of him then i found someone i enjoyed more she is quite shocking, everyone got that fun character my friend tends to just be look at it im top of leader board with 1-2 kills:) )
---
As a past ghostface main i can say that there is nothing between
---
Money, money, money *clap clap clap*
---
Must be funny
---
In a rich man's world!
---
Just my experience, maining Killer and playing survivor with buddies:
---
**Dwights** are usually pretty bad. If they‚Äôre good, I tend to expect some mild toxicity in post-game. Unlikely to go for bold plays.
---
**Claudettes** are either quietly bad and immersed, or audaciously good and loud about it. Not quite as toxic as Neas, but they can be. Much more likely to go for crazy saves or flashlight blinds. The most likely to irritate me when they vanish like ninjas.
---
**Jakes** are pretty rare. If I run into one, they‚Äôre usually pretty average and focus on gens. Unlikely to go for unhooks unless they have to.
---
**Megs** are always walking away from me and sprint bursting away at the last second. They almost always try for it a second time. I don‚Äôt know if they expect me to forget? I don‚Äôt know. Most Megs I see are bold and will try to run me around, but they‚Äôre usually not the best loopers.
---
**Davids** are dumb and do dumb things, and don‚Äôt seem to take the game too seriously. Lots of pointless body blocking. Chases end quickly with David but if there‚Äôs a situation where a David can sacrifice himself to get someone else out they always seem to go for it. Dead Hard.
---
**Shirtless Davids** are big dumb yetis who do goofball shit like try to intimidate the killer. They‚Äôre adorable.
---
**Bills** always have Borrowed Time, usually Decisive Strike. Aggressive unhookers. You‚Äôll only see them on a gen if they have nothing else to do. Typically pretty good loopers.
---
**Fengs** are kind of a mix between Bills and Claudettes. Pretty aggressive unhooking, trend toward toxic post-game chat. Most likely to suicide if they‚Äôre first to be hooked.
---
**Adams** always have Deliverance and they will be unhooking themselves, usually before you‚Äôre even out of terror radius.
---
**Neas** hate your guts. If the killer wins, it‚Äôs because their teammates are garbage or the killer is using NOED or Ruin or Pop or whatever ‚Äúcrutch perk‚Äù they feel like blaming. If they die, it‚Äôs because the killer camped/tunneled. If the survivors all escape, they‚Äôll single out someone who they think could have played better or say ‚Äúez pz‚Äù. They‚Äôre misanthropes. Balanced Landing, flashlights, Decisive Strike.
---
**Quentins** are typically pretty bad. Sometimes they‚Äôre quite good, but rarely, and only played ironically. Usually running Pharmacy.
---
**Aces** are bastards you can‚Äôt hate. They‚Äôre almost always excellent players, will go for big plays and capitalize on your mistakes. Typically not very toxic in postgame, though.
---
**Tapps** are so rare I can‚Äôt even volunteer an opinion. 
---
**Kates** are like Megs, but with Lithe and Dance with Me. They play like Blendettes with none of the camouflage.
---
**Steves** are pretty chill. Typically go for unhooks. Unremarkable.
---
**Nancys** are either terrible or great loopers. Tend towards immersed/stealth play style.
---
**Yuis** play like low-to-mid rank Neas.
---
Just because they are low rank doesn't mean they are new
---
It adds another objective for the killer to do, and takes time. The most important resource the killer has. Regardless if he's good or not, that's a bad situation for the killer. Unless it's deliberately going to stop the game from ending till the husk is put on a hook like an afk player than it's only hurting the killer.
---
Haha but was very fishy. Think they de-ranked somehow because they played at red rank skill level
---
You are if you believe in it. I'm no princess to tell you to believe in yourself, follow your dreams, yadda yadda, But you should.
---
 Why go to the other side if you haven't experienced all of this side first? Ever got so drunk with friends on Minecraft that you built a city you didn't remember building?
---
 Have you ever watched all saw movies? Good, because no one who's still sane enough has!
---
Have you thought of getting a puppy? That's life changing responsibility.
---
You see, There's more to life than failure. 
---
I've been through something that I thought I'd never get out of, and with a lot of time, effort and rehab I found out I could get out of doing it ever again. You know what kept me going through all of those years? My beloved mother. My friends. That friendly neighborhood mailman that's way too hot to work as a mailman. Now I say, if I could get out of something as shitty as that, hell, I sure think you can.
---
That's true but usually by the time you have levelled 4 characters to level 30 you would have ranked up a lot. They were waaay too good for that rank too so it can't be that they are just bad.
---
Imagine DBD with dedicated servers but Beta version of them that we had, and all Survivors and killers are on Wi-Fi connection. 
---
This is gonna be unplayable.
---
And you claim bubba is the worst killer 
---
and "there is no different way to play him" based on what?
---
Probably like me and stopped playing for awhile. Come back and your a high rank
---
bc rank doesnt mean they are new
---
This is a beautiful event that will never happen in any of my games 
---
üëäüòî
---
Probably just havent played for a while so they would have had rank  resets
---
Maybe just took a couple months off? Especially with the old reset system it didn't require that long a hiatus to be 15+
---
Also think about this noed has a 1.5% chance to be used that's not a reliable counter
---
Also when someone disconnects your popping system should be locked so you can get a black pop at worst and not a depip because someone plugged the cord
---
Head on was made for these moments
---
My thoughts on bill: His cancer lung makes him loud as fuck and able to be heard across map. All his perks are good but left behind ia situational.
---
Unbreakable is decent but very situational.
---
Borrowed Time is great and has helped out a lot.
---
Billy big nuts, no one gets in his way, no killer, no gen and no closed exit door. He strides up to the killer, gives them a big sloppy grandma kiss and proceeds walking away. 
---
He's got one of the best surv perks and he knows it. Dbd needs to acknowledge more bill mains and give him a sweater, the poor guy.
---
...link?
---
So leave it up to RNG while EGC is counting down and u ultimately have to leave bc there was a 1.5% chance of the killer using this perk from all the perks in the game.
---
No that's not a okay counter and I'm a killer main even I think this perk is stupid
---
That was one of the best body block saves I've seen.
---
Sounds like it‚Äôs not a common enough problem to be upset about, then.
---
I'm guessing ur on console cos y'all recently got him
---
Makes sense, but if he's found a way to play Bubba that makes him better than some other killers, he's not the worst, right?
---
It shows while ur the last one left closed or open doesn't matter
---
PC
---
Yeah maybe but they played extremely well for someone who has had a long break, not rusty at all
---
I like his Christmas sweater
---
Scorch prime gang rise up
---
That was the point of my example. 
---
I was going to state how Bubba, due to his kit, can‚Äôt do anything that another killer doing the exact SAME thing couldn‚Äôt do. Every other killer has something at least.
---
Who doesn't?
---
If EGC is counting down, there‚Äôs a door open you can run through. If the killer is guarding the open door, sneak over to the other door. I don‚Äôt understand what point you‚Äôre trying to make.
---
That's literally not how anything should work that's like saying nurse is fine bc only a small amount of people are truly good at using her. That's literally the dumbest argument ever.
---
Not to mention NOED is bad for new players bc it just teaches them the wrong things
---
Iron will is amazing for not only making you very stealthy while injured as killers usually do not expect survivors to have Iron will, it will also allow you to run loops differently as killers will have a hard time hearing where you are going, especially if they do not think you have Iron will. 
---
Youtubers such as Fungoose and Ussylis use Iron will to break LOS with the killer and make the killer lose them during chases. It works amazing well for preventing killers tracking you during chases.
---
Self-Care is pretty poor in my opinion. The time you spend healing yourself could have been invested working on a generator and since self-care takes around 32 seconds thats around half a gen of work spent healing. 
---
Its becoming even worse now with more anti-healing builds starting to become popular meaning self-care times can reach past 40 seconds and with nurses calling, you leave yourself exposed.
---
Ppl who don't play bill
---
Thank you so much!   
---
I always try to make them lighthearted and avoid any negativity in them :')
---
Don‚Äôt forget Dota 2!
---
And also Lesion* in r6s
---
Ground anus omfg you made me scare my dog by laughing so loud
---
The point that's flying over ur head there is no sign for noed until it hits there is no info about how many totems are left there is no info about how many totems ur team did.
---
Yeah the problem with the "hide in a locker all game" argument is, then you would be playing with a 3 man. And your chance of succeeding as a survivor with even 1 man down goes down SIGNIFICANTLY, particularly at the start of a game. So it would be self defeating to hide in the locker. 
---
Also you cant just "easily cue with 3 rank 20 people" unless you yourself are rank 20, in which case you're probably not going to be able to win in a 1v1, even against a new killer.
---
It's not a sad reality that killers have to do everything solo. That's literally the dynamic of the game. 1 killer, 4 survivors. I will concede that killers have more to manage during an average game. But that is offset by the fact that they can move faster, have information perks (discordance bbq etc.) And can take survs out of the game, slugging, hooking etc. (And yes, I know survivors have perks also, obviously.) but if you're going to make the argument that playing killer is "unfair" then maybe dont play killer. 
---
I dont necessarily think that survs should pip automatically for escaping, but the comment I was replying to said that killed should automatically pip for a 4K, (which is the killers goal) so I stated that if that was the case, then survivors should pip for an escape, since that is their goal. (However, I think that no matter what, a black pip should be minimum for either of those, in any case) 
---
For example, 2 days ago i was in a game. And we absolutely crushed gens, 1 person started running the killer after about 2-3 gens, got hit once. We finished the rest of the gens, opened the gate, gave one body block and all escaped. In a few minutes with no one going down, and I de-pipped. So in essence. We depipped for doing TOO WELL against the killer. Which is ridiculous.
---
r/angryupvote
---
idk why people think it's so cool to play against streamers, i've played otz, pshyco, entity twice, two random spanish fog whisperors and my friend has played with monto and hybridpanda aswell as all those other streamers i've mentioned since i swf with him regular, not all you'd imagine, trust me
---
Then i'd say that at the very least Legion has less.
---
I mean i like him and i started playing him Because i constantly played l4d before.
---
I don't see why copyright reason would get infront of a simple face lift
---
I stopped playing for maybe a year and a half last time this happened to me
---
It has a few meanings that vary from player to player. Usually it means that the player is dedicated and spends a lot of time playing.
---
I disagree. 
---
Even if legion is unable to chain together deep wounds, does he not still get a free first hit on one survivor most times? Bubba does not get a free hit.
---
I played against tofu while he was playing hillbilly with a steering wheel lol
---
I hit him with the ol stupid biiiiitch
---
The difference in playing against a rank 1 killer and a rank 17 killer is pretty huge. I think most rank 1-4 players would who have taken 2-3 months off would stomp on a newish killer
---
It sounds like NOED is quite effective at teaching survivors to focus on something other than generators, and that sometimes it‚Äôs not worth going back for the save.
---
I still don‚Äôt understand what it is you think is so unfair about this perk that can‚Äôt be said about DS, BT, Adrenaline.
---
I hope so at least.
---
He probably still wanted to just play the game. This way he got to play and also get his tome done.
---
I'm still waiting for the day when we get a Legion game mode where all 4 members are in one game
---
Well the devs did get in contact with the actual actor on twitter who played Quentin in the Friday the 13th movie. 
---
He was encouraging them to make his character model more lifelike but I am not sure if he can influence the situation.
---
But he does get the occasional instadown.
---
He has a sweater?
---
Aww that's so sweet, I'm glad you enjoy them &lt;3
---
Just a joke. But I've done it before.
---
The guy in this video is a complete ass hole in real life, I‚Äôd bet money on it.
---
If his only bright spot is defending hooks then that makes him a soft patroller or a camper.
---
Thanks man, makes a lot more sense now.
---
Tbh I don't even know. I'd add totems to be counted on the hud bc that in general is good for solo queues. I'd probably make it so when the last gen is on 90 or 80% the killer has to make a choice either contesting the gen to stall the game more or let them do it and get noed but while the gen is on 80 or 90% the noed icon with a noise warning will activate and noed will hex a totem but not be active if the gen regresses under said % the hexed totem deactivates and will hex a new totem once it's active again ofc if no totems are up then it's gone.
---
Maybe not the best fix but I think this will give e Survivors ample time to choose how to proceed with their next action bc u could risk it and so the gen and get out or waste more time tryin to find noed this can also be paired with other hex totems for some interesting builds plus it rewards map scouting before hand if a Survivor can remember what totems where lit and which one wasn't. 
---
But personally I'd be fine with outright removing it and tell new killers about other better perks they could use.
---
I know balance is hard especially for dbd but I don't get how the devs think noed is fine in the current form
---
Is there anyone that can consistenly perform great on Legion in red ranks with no addons? (That doesn;t mean it's not possible of course, just that nobody has managed to do it yet)
---
She's there, she just blends in.
---
*I w i s h*
---
Lol I‚Äôm actually in lobby and listening to the theme, didn‚Äôt have to turn audio to hear the videoü§™
---
Damn all of you who interrupt the pick-up-heal when fully recovered.
---
Ye but they would of been playing to get to 17 all the rust is gone by then
---
Yep. I used the word ‚Äútrap‚Äù once in a shitty meme I made in 3 minutes, so that means I hate all trans people.
---
You guys got me. Ya figured out my whole plan. Darn. *My plans of spreading anti-LGBT propaganda were foiled once again.*
---
Yep. I hate trans people because of a meme I made on a Dead By Daylight Subreddit.
---
Good detective work, you can go home now. Case closed.
---
Did not order express. Tracking # said it shipped the 12th and is out for delivery today. It shipped from North Carolina and my friend is in Pennsylvania if that helps you with a timeline and it went through DHL. It sucks they don‚Äôt answer their customers. Hopefully you get an order confirmation soon though
---
Which is irrelevant to the question of whether or not it makes him a good killer.
---
Well in that test they also decided to have Endurance activate even if you were healthy as opposed to how it has always been
---
I will say that legion has the capacity to do more. If two players of the same skill level play LF and Legion in the same scenarios, I believe the legion player will have more success overall.
---
I saw another post similar to this and one great suggestion was to give him a secondary power that makes gens produce a small radius of gas
---
Yep, but I honestly think all killers are viable. It just depends on the map for some of them
---
I‚Äôm trying to read between the lines here ‚Äî is your objection that it‚Äôs shitty for the person who goes down from the first NOED hit because they had no way of knowing the killer had NOED?
---
From a high-rank perspective, there are so many tells for perks survivors usually have a pretty good idea of what a killer‚Äôs running. If they count four perks, then they know there‚Äôs no NOED. If they don‚Äôt, maybe they play a little more carefully once the last gen is finished.
---
Low-rank is a different story. I agree there‚Äôs some information you just have to figure out or be told by more experienced players. But that‚Äôs the case for a lot of perks and even killer powers. The game in general has an issue with explaining game concepts. Make Your Choice (‚Äúwhy am I suddenly exposed?‚Äù), Mad Grit (‚Äúthat should have been more than enough time for that survivor to wiggle off!‚Äù), Discordance/BBQ/Spies (‚Äúhow do they keep finding us?‚Äù). Even weird addons like Scratched Mirror Myers or bodyblock Hag. New players are all going to suffer from this until they learn what the strategy is and how to counter it.
---
We‚Äôre probably not going to agree that NOED has a counterplay. But the game is probably going to keep getting more complex, and new players will suffer for that unless there‚Äôs a perk dictionary or some other form of in-game reference to study up on. But nerfing the perk to make low-rank more fair will destroy any chances of it being even situationally viable at high-rank.
---
I look at it like this; if you get all the gens done and maybe even the exit gates open, you‚Äôve won. Unless you‚Äôre barely making it out, chances are you‚Äôve clowned on the killer and they‚Äôre gonna have an 8-10K point game. They‚Äôll barely safety pip if they‚Äôre lucky. So if they‚Äôre able to get a single kill with NOED after spending the majority of the game with 3 perks, are survivors ‚Äî even the one who got killed ‚Äî really losing?
---
Hello, is this Sally? Wheeeze, cough. Hi Sally, theres this guy that says Legion has the most fun power and... SCREEEEECH!!!
---
Niceee
---
Every time i play survivor and my teammates get downed in 5 seconds.
---
Corn cowers before Amandas Letter. Corn rows count as walls/visual blockers and you can see auras through the corn if you're moving against the rows.
---
and then it's just pages of "-Rep Facecamping/Bad mannered/Toxic."   
---
I dont understand people who take joy in being what is essentially a "bully" in Dead By Daylight. I KNOW for a fact most of these people are adults.
---
That was vibin', thanks man.
---
Not fun.  Such as safely unhook three people after endgame collapse has already begun.
---
This is taking the game hostage. if no gen is being touched for 10min you can record it and send a ticket to the support in the official forum with video evidence
---
I had a match around last Christmas where the survivors all popped party streamers so they EXPECTED me to farm with them.
---
You can imagine their anger when I was too busy completing a Sacrifice challenge.
---
i always thought a neat solution to her not cleansing is making it so infected people will go on a Borrowed Time style timer to go down if they dont cleanse after a certain criteria is met. Like pigs traps activate when someone does a gen, the sickness could become more virulent when someone gets hooked or something and require cleansing
---
obviously the secondary power would need to be nerfed though
---
Oh yeaaah, it looked a lot like huntress
---
Spirit fury.
---
Is this some PC joke I'm too Console Playing too understand
---
SAME! Purples is my sweet spot but sometimes I just miss greens because it‚Äôs easier and I‚Äôm lazy sometimes üòÇ
---
He does. It's green
---
Don't lose faith in people &lt;3

For years this game existed I've asked survivors to help me multiple times: with the rift, with some achievements as well, and I've never betrayed anyone's trust. Vice versa, I had kilelrs messaging me on STEAm, asking for help with traps/grabs/basement hooks challenges and everyone were left alive after that. Noone really farmed, there were no intentional stuns/heals and such, people mostly just meming and fooling around. 
---
I honestly prefer to trust them doing that. If killers betray me, eh, then it's on them, all I did was a nice deed and feel good about that :)
---
dude he has a sweater. it was given to everyone for free
---
So just like our Legion
---
Back when he was running for president he had a thing going where he followed anyone that followed him
---
Ugh yeah I‚Äôve heard rank one can be a nightmare. I wanna stay in purple/green area
---
I dont know why people hate on legion, I came back after maining billy and myers, and I can still easily get 4ks. I would definitely say they are at least high c tier
---
Low tier killers, or killers who survivors believe are low tier, suffer from what I call the Curtis Effect‚Ñ¢. Basically it's a subconscious fallacious correlation that because a character is bad, the person playing them is also bad. The most obvious example of this would be old Freddy. It's no secret that old Freddy was, too say the least, abysmal and everyone is familiar why. This meant that survivors were more inclined to try and do stupid actions and ballsy plays with extremely high risk without acknowledging that even with the character's handicaps, the person playing him can still be effective if they are competent.
---
Pretty sure he kills 3/4 survivors in most games yet he cries at this?
---
Its like yesterday i asked him a simple question about a topic where i felt he contradicted himself, he completely ignored it and i got attacked by 3/4 people in chat, some were even mods loool.
---
Oh god yea, that was the first thing they've ever done in this game to make me gag (the part where he just rips your tongue off)
---
While it seems like a rank reset thing, actually, this is totally feasible. If you main killer, you can dump points into survivors, unlocking teachable sand leveling them up without ever having played as them. That would be a weird move, but certainly a way to have 4 teachables on low ranks. Additionally, shrine of secrets would circumvent the whole problem of unlocking those teachables, so it is definitely possible.
---
Ikr? So fucked up but cool
---
Did that fairly easy, you just need to corner a survivor and spare his life. 99% of people will understand what you are aiming at. However i had to resort to much nastier tactics with No one escapes the endgame and Irinfantry Huntress.
---
Titanic
---
Hell yeah dude
---
There are situations when you're better off self caring yourself than get heals.
---
Like, when you're the last one left, or if you gotta rush a generator with a teammate, but you need heals. You heal near the gen while the other guy keeps working.
---
But yeah, i agree. I prefer finding a teammate too.
---
Oh yeah... yes, iron will makes you completely silent on T3 and it's very good for juking killers. I run it too cuz i like being immersed.
---
To be fair, this tactic is pretty old. 
---
Back when flashlights were... less counterable, when cosmetics choice was very poor and all you had were streamer's cosmetics and exclusives - these were the times that you had to quick switch.
---
I assure you that absolutely noone would play the 3-4 legacy squad, stocked up with items and some rare cosmetics. You had to quick change or wear the regular clothes to get into the game. Unless the killer had legacy as well, and was pretty confident in his/her skill, then it would not be an issue. 
---
Nowadays? All exclusives were just released, so it's not an indication of a skill level/playing time whatsoever. And if there are more than 3 items, killers can equip Franklins. 
---
I don't see much dodging nowadays, to be honest.
---
Me and Feng vs ghost face. I unhooked her and healed her up. She slides aggressively on a pallet back and forth, and jumps into a red box while I was doing the last gen. So I said fuck it and ran, she got caught and was hooked immediately and died. I found the hatch at the end. She says she let me win. Lol girl no
---
Yup it fits this game's tone as well very dark and well depressing üòÇ
---
I did!
---
Ash plays like a mix of David and Nea. Big dumb plays, delights in tilting killers into dumb chases or infinites. Clicky flashlights. Usually not toxic in postgame. Dies to his own hubris most of the time.
---
Do the same with wraith perks.
---
But what about the normal moments you just sprint and waste it? Honest question .. you just walk around all game being blow?
---
exactly man you got it! If the killer was to slug all 3 and ur the last alive its honestly on you to be sneaky and for your team to spread out though if your team plays good enough there should only be 2 slugs at most. It's super counterable if you play it smart and safe. Slugging someone only saves him so little time compared to the ability to move wherever to be rescued and way quicker to tap someone at 99 then to unhook.
---
David = dead hard
---
Bill no blood = baby
---
Meg = waste the sprint burst and it's easy kill
---
Nancy = baby
---
Doctor = easy escape
---
Oh I know, I'm just rather worried about the future playerbase and how the developers will work on the game moving forward. They didn't exactly add much in the 1 year since it launched on Discord, and the way they acted towards criticism in the beginning was a big turnoff to me. I just hope LY will find a stable playerbase.
---
Oh shit what's the music at 0:05??? I am trying super hard to remember
---
Omega Blink nurse was nerfed. All of her extra blink addons were changed, and now she has a recovery for her blinks. Really sucks for a Nurse main.
---
agreed
---
What about Assylum Ash? Or would that be a killer?
---
I'd say Sprint burst is third, after DH and Lithe.
---
Yes, you can 99 Sprint Burst to save it, but you literally can't stop moving in order to do so.
---
It does, plus it was nice to come up with something a bit more outside the box concept wise (seriously I dont think anyone was ever going to try making a chapter based off of a concept album, maybe I'm just secretly insane or something)
---

---
I guess I'm never getting that lore....
---
I like to say no but BE need to buck up
---
Makes sense
---
The survivor team got destroyed not even getting a gen done but the one toxic survivor got hatch and acted like it was easy game
---
Lmao thanks!
---
...okay? And how is this scenario relevant to anything posted here?
---
That hitbox ;(
---
Just had a game like this yesterday against and Oni. He did ok but DC'd when last gen popped and I said come on man. He says "I dont like Oni" like come on though finish out the tiny bit of match left
---
Myers isn't evil at all, the evil whitin is related to the person controlling Myers. xD
---
I'm unsure if it's fetish that pig had seeing that reaction
---
The Borderlands games look pretty good and they're pretty much in the same style
---
I main legion and get plenty of 4Ks at red ranks. It doesn‚Äôt make them a good killer. Technically everyone is viable, just that some are more viable than others. I‚Äôm saying they‚Äôre F tier
---
Idk. They can be found on other maps. Dont know what they signify or if they mean anything besides being somewhat rare to find if you dont know the spots
---
You're meant to 99% Sprint Burst and then use it mid chase at will. That's why it's considered so good.
---
Great fucking make them then
---
The only reasonable explanation to this is in the title.
---
 I always use purples or rule set no2
---
Occasionally last will
---
I'm not skillful enough to make them.
---
&gt; a killer could depip with a 4K while the survivors of that same game safety/pip up.
---
If we're talking red ranks (the only place where pipping is relevant because it's so easy to pip in other ranks in both roles), no. This isn't happening and you're exaggerating. 
---
It's either a very fast 4K and everyone depips including survivors because it was a shit game (sometimes the killer will still safety pip, but I can assure you it's guaranteed depip for all survivors in this scenario). 
---
Or it is an endgame clutch 4K and the killer will at least safety pip because the game lasted enough for him to rack at least silver/gold in all emblems but gatekeeper, unless he really did nothing all game (and at this point, without interaction with the killer, that means survivors will depip too, because they died AND couldn't rack up much benevolent/evader points, lose their unbroken, and good lightbringer isn't enough for safety pip).
---
Absolute stomps for survivors (easy escape without anyone being hooked or similar) at red ranks also give depip/safety pip for survivors because you only get unbroken and maybe some lightbringer or evader depending on if you were doing gens/being the one that ran the killer for five gens, but you lose too much by not having any point in the other two emblems.
---
SWF have a big advantage tho because they can at least have consistent results, but other than that, red ranks are the same kind of bullshit for solo survivors and killers, but at least as killer you're not depending on three other randoms to not be trash.
---
Genuinely curious, how was healing eachother buffed recently?
---
Kate Denson and Nancy Wheeler main? Well, you, sir, just made ME dead hard.
---
Yup  I boddied a kid and the first time he escaped because all three of his teammates had died and he was lucky to have made it out, I Got messages about how trash I was at nurse right after and how he is so much better at nurse than me.
---
The next game I faced him he and his team completed no generators and when I responded saying "I trashed him, gg ez" he sent me a screenshot of him reporting me to Sony and having his mom call the company as well.
---
thank you vrchat
---
Killer good :)
---
Survivor bad :(

Ignore me im having a bad day im sorry
---
Opposite here.
---
I almost exclusively use johns medical file and combat straps.
---
Vulture instincts
---
Merging those two perks would be perfect because right now We're Gonna Live Forever is easily abused when your own teammates decide to farm you. I know the points don't get added unless you're safe for a brief moment after the unhooking but I've still often been unhooked when the Killer is close enough that they'll get their points and I'll be tunnelled. It'd make a lot more sense if it came with super fast healing as that'd make it a truly altruistic perk. I rarely have teammates that use We'll Make It but I love it when they do because it's nice to be almost immediately back to full health as soon as you're unhooked.
---
Unfortunately they‚Äôve said before that each cosmetic added breaks the game a little more if not tested and correctly fixed first
---
Iirc he followed anybody automatically who followed him during his campaign.
---
idk I see where youre coming from but the add ons do just fine for that in my opinion. Terror Radius im not sure if I agree, stealthy is usually the preferred way for me plus there's perks for that. Maybe increase the base duration of the gas or give an extra bottle or 2.
---
Trust me I'm a clown main and would love to see a little boost. I feel like he is really good but I also see him to be not as easy as some killers. I just don't truly know what hes lacking. Maybe make it possible to stack intoxication gas till they get injured or hallucinating kind of like having a doctor effect. Maybe even make it have an effect that you can't hear his terror radius. It wouldn't hurt if he did have a lingering effect for some time period after.
---
Killers take 5 minutes to load any match
---
There's not even fall damage on apex......
---
this is tight as hell, ratings
---
Stats show killers have a more than 60% win rate though. Eventually survivor wont be any fun to play as. How high of a chance do you want to win? 80%?
---
I rather just repair the generator because now we have at least 1 person doing gens.
---
The more you rank up the more of the fun part of the game starts fleeing
---
Yes &lt;3
---
Wait i thought i can only have 1000000 at the time
---
Killers already have a more than 60% win rate though. You really need to be more powerful? Idk its just at red ranks killers seem pretty good and win at least half the time. I'm beginning to wonder if a lot of these survivors are too powerful posts are coming from people who aren't that good at the game?
---
Survivor waits are literally a fraction of killer waits
---
Well no the point is there‚Äôs not much he could have done the only sort of meaningful mistakes he made was not hitting the dude who dropped a pallet on the wrong side
---
It mainly has to do with rank. Killers who camp often usually have lower ranks, as the other survs can get 2 to 3 gens done in the time it takes for the one person to die. The only real counter is to complete gens, and maybe unhook with borrowed time and use DS. Other than that, there isnt much of a counter. If a killer camps, dont try to unhook and struggle to the end. Buy time for your teammates. However, if all of them are crouching around the hook, then just let go. No use. Remember, if the killer camps, it's their loss. You can just join another game where the killer isnt camping.
---
UwU
---
It's always the same, I feel you.
---
Im so glad all of you in the comments are people of culture.
---
Nothing makes me laugh more uproariously than someone tbagging and being toxic and then DCing when they inevitably get downed. As for my most satisfying moment, I can't think of something in particular but little things like realizing a survivor is nearby by a split second faint rustling in the grass makes me feel like Otz.
---
Hope not. I mean the good thing is that they apparently do fulfill the orders eventually.... they‚Äôre just slow and uncommunicative. I‚Äôm def curious to see what the item looks like once it gets delivered later today!!
---
Chestburster
---
Or you forgot to turn on the replay buffer in OBS whenever things like this happen. That's me.
---
Don‚Äôt listen to those people, lore niggas are where it‚Äôs at üí™üò§
---
No, to disable V-Sync, just set bUseVSync=False. I guess make sure  FrameRateLimit=60.000000 is also set, if you want to cap your framerate at 60fps.
---
There are other things you could do, like adjust the quality level of individual graphics elements, or actually make the game run in true fullscreen, but if you are satisfied with how the game performs as it is, no real need to do so.
---
BHVR: new idea to nerf balanced landing even harder. Make them get injured after a fall
---
I would pay all my money just to see all of these turned into movies
---
NOED activates
---
Bro,I crossed him because I only had Shards,but if I had the Auric Cells I would instabuy Demogorgon.
---
I guess I'm looking at it too hard. I draw characters and I tend to notice minor things too much I guess.
---
Fairly close. but not screen accurate. It doesn't look like Shatner, anyway. Maybe that was intentional.
---
No because the survivor isnt the actor js the character and intellectual property of whomever owns the rights
---
Dude I wish every team mate was as good as u like I get the worst team mates that just walk around and do nothing
---
How about the same for Perks? Or searching for perks via their name. Like you type Iro and Iron Will lights up.
---
I mean with all the tunneling c*nts out there it is really a necessarity.
---
I REALLY want to be not forced to run it in my build but EVERY TIME I unequip it I get tunneled next game. Always.
---
Last time I played against nurse I looped her for half the game got fucked by latency and left to do die on first hook
---
It's called fashion, look it up.
---
It's early to que and rank 20 is even longer
---
Some games do it pretty well, like Smite for example. I got over my hate boner for replacing the FP/Season Ticket with a battlepass, realizing that it was a F2P game anyway. I just played for a bit of time and I'm already like level 24 out of 60 on it.    
---
I would say destiny also does it well, except that the seasonal content is so little, and it's only there to boost the seasonal FOMO, since DLC activities are now locked behind seasons in D2. So yea bungie also gets an F.    
---
This game's BP is just too damn grindy. Grind out 8k XP just for 1 level, or do a super tedious mission for 3 fragments. It's just awful and clearly promotes you spending extra money just to complete it.
---
It‚Äôs literally impossible to post a ‚ÄúToxic X is a bad thing‚Äù without minimum five posts about how the other role can be toxic too, just give up.
---
Yeah I was thinking the same sorta thing like poor Freddy. 
---
And sweet Christmas I never knew I needed something so much as a shark for cats costume for him..
---
I didn't say it was amazing. Just that it was a possibility. 
---
Why play Ghostface when you can play Michael? :P 
---
It's not always about perfect efficiency, sometimes it's about those little niche situations and why those two killers are different. 
---
Oni offers a couple of extra things that Billy doesn't for example. 
---
Following bloodpools to find injured survivors, and the ability to sprint + instadown from time to time. And then, when the stars align and you get a double down? It's just icing on the cake.
---
Not quite invisible but more transparent. They can be seen, you just *really* need to focus on them, but at that point it's just better to step into them and keep pushing.
---
Imagine caring about rank.
---
You activated my trap card: God Pallet
---
Same for ghost face
---
Nea got injured, maybe after the gates were already powered so they knew there was no NOED.
---
It could also be seen as a big brain pun, since baby bill doesn't know that you want to heal as fast as possible against Oni.
---
He also has NOED
---
Damn he used **Brutal Strength** and negated the effect
---
Honestly how low effort can you get
---
OK this is pure ART. PLEASE recreate more vines. I'd personally like to vote for The Huntress doing the "I WON'T HESITATE BITCH" vine
---
I can hear the statues giggle at your unfortune
---
Fuck ochido, In case you don‚Äôt know he‚Äôs quite the pedophile
---
I never did One For My Baby because I forgot Boone after clearing Arcjet. Same with every other companion except for Rex. But all that is why I didn't agree with the Legion as a whole, just with some of Caesar's ideas. Lannius was a little bitchboy though.
---
SCATTER! FIND THAT TOTEM!!!  
---
5 minutes later, still no gens done, still no idea where the totem is.
---
*Mallet of the Forbidden one*
---
*Face of the Forbidden one*
---
*Tie of the Forbidden one*
---
*Apron of the Forbidden one*
---
When I saw the legion on my first playthrough in Nipton I just capped them. And that dude with a bowlcut who was like "YEA I WON BABY".
---
That was a well timed play and I as a killer main appreciate you for that! This is the kinda stuff that makes me hyped to play the game even though I'm killer mostly.
---
I was in a lobby with ranks 12, all of us, and then the killer was rank 1. It was so strange
---
*laughs in waiting 30 minutes for a match then just giving up*
---
Well i'm glad some good came from this. Thank ypu i hope you have a good day too
---
"YOU KNOW WHAT I WON? I WON THE FUCKING LOTTERY!" proceeds to be eaten by radscorpions. But i'll admit all I did was pop one into Vulpes and fucking R U N
---
I think the one that increases is your lean stalk is useful
---
sprint burst is so situational and the worst exhaustion perk though. you can't run the entire match because you're saving it for the right moment. I love lithe.
---
*Across the map* +2 protection hit
---
That is so kind of you to say! Thank you very much for that üòä
---
lol people really can‚Äôt accept that their country is responsible for human suffering all around the globe.
---
So I¬¥m assuming you¬¥re either new to the subreddit or new to the game, because otherwise you must REALLY enjoy recycled content for the 100th time.
---
No problem. I'm always glad to see survivors creatively using perks, especially when it's done like that.
---
"But that doesn't make sense..."
---
"Just slap on *The Entity!*"
---
Yup,there was no noed. You can see at the end of the clip ghostface hits the other Nea before she escapes
---
Yeah, it's especially bad when everyone else is too afraid to even unhook you. :(
---
i tried so hard to make it work but i never got the 3 stack even by trolling a bit. I'd really have to throw the whole game to get it activated
---
I stopped playing with her because her add-ons are boring
---
I always 99 the gates. In this scenario however, since the 3 of us were healthy i assumed that if the injured survivor would be running towards our gate we‚Äôd all be able to take hits. 
---
See, it was all calculated üòâ
---
Eh, I'd still rather use lithe. I don't have to manage my exhaustion and im near a vault 90% of the game anyways.
---
legit this is why I stopped playing nurse
---
Never say that again
---
Camping is fair game to complain about. No counterplay and makes the game a time progression simulator. Takes a fun game and makes it boring for 5/5 players. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt camp, I‚Äôm just saying if you do you can‚Äôt then complain about people giving you shit for it. 
---
Noed on the other hand, I don‚Äôt see the point in complaining about. It does feel unjust when you can run a killer around, out smart and mind game them and then at the end they get you because of a speedboost + instadown but there is plenty of counter play to it. And let‚Äôs be honest, you can predict with almost certainty when a killer has noed. Like I said it feels like an undeserved loss when you do get caught, but there is reasonable counterplay. 
---
With that said I‚Äôd still like to see a small change to noed: Keep the speed boost and instadown but only for as many full totems are left. So if survivors left 2 dull totems, you now only have 2 instadown attacks. Would give solo survivors more of an incentive to cleanse.
---
What about the Imperial Legion?
---
Someone devs on some people don't understand is that, if a perk ask us to not focus on winning to have a use, then it's a complete waste of a slot.
---
You can't get Mom activated if you don't troll. It's just impossible.
---
That Is literally against the subreddit rules and would be considered a "witch hunt"
---
These people are assholes but we aren't gonna make anything better by harassing them as a community
---
and also d/c's muddy the water a lot. i had one dude d/c super early and so the survivors just threw themselves at me to end the game faster and i depip'd. i shouldn't lose rank because of a d/c then 3 hook suicides. i can't control what the survivors do. atleast give me a black pip(i didn't earn a rank up, but i killed everyone why am i deranking)
---
Throw that shit in barb though? You basically can't even see the dark reflection of it. Best bet then is an IQ or twitch drone rolling over it and hitting it
---
hmm yea nice one
---
C‚Äômon, I know we all read that in Peter Griffin‚Äôs voice in our heads.
---
There's a button to invert x y axis. You may have accidently pressed it. Check your options.
---
Those configuration options are typically broad options, not allowing the specific "notched" configuartion people need for color weakness enhancement.
---
Everyone comes across toxic swf.
---
Just some of us aren't vaginas about it.

and then they complain when they get 10 spirits and nurses in a row after they tea bagged and flashlight clicked the last trapper
---
Pharmacy is okish to use.
---
I'll always try to hit the great skillchecks, but sometimes I'm just to tired or I can't act fast enough. Does anyone know if tapping is quicker than always getting normal skillchecks?
---
She is not an op that is useful in my opinion because she has no special part to her that makes her useful because she isn‚Äôt an op that can open soft walls her gun is out ranked by many others and most players can see everything with out help from her gadgets at all when you get to plat and it only saves a second or two
---
At least it doesn't depend on the addon order anymore this way
---
?
---
Because they don‚Äôt go outside lol
---
If I get face camp, that is 100% a win to me. Especially if the killer specially wants me to be face camped.
---
Yeah, the false rumors usually come from people "believing" in stuff instead of actually looking it up.
---
Isn't that just Legion but ranged then?
---
this is amazing
---
&gt; Flip Flop is fine,
---
no. By itself it's a shit perk, and comboed with other theme relative perks you just get a mediocre build that will do something once out of 8 games maybe.
---
This is so sad. 1 like = 1 prayer
---
Some people want to complete the achievements
---
The killers in DBD have Canon relationships? I'm not calling you a liar, but I would love some source on this.
---
He the fuck does that even happen
---
Not for me at all. I regularly wait 5 minutes for survivors lobbies and basically instantly queue into games as killer.
---
Oh shit my fuck
---
What platform are you on? I'm on pc and rank one on both sides, and my killer queues literally take less than 30 seconds, while survivor takes around 10-20 minutes.
---
Pretty sure killing yourself is just DC'ing. In which case the game will act as if you lost and you will go back to the campfire.
---
now i always get my Mom stack when i take a hit while someone else is being chased, but it's not enough. I never managed to get 3 stacks.
---
Either i escape before it happens or die trying. Anyway you'd need to hard throw the game to get those stack instead of just trying to win by focusing on gens.
---
Bohemia interactive and delays with dayz lmao
---
Holy shit she's dead as hell what was that pallet filled with nerfs?
---
I mean yeah but that was back in the times of well the plague where 'medicine' would be equally likely to kill you so...
---
And yeah for spirit don't interrupt mummy and daddy chop chop time :)
---
What why
---
Congrats mate, it always feels good to get a perfect game when you don‚Äôt try to get one.
---
Man I have open comments and I have way too many calling me on ‚Äúwall hacks cheater‚Äù
---
....I‚Äôm playing mirror Myers...
---
Ikr? I totally wasn‚Äôt expecting it, but was a nice surprise c:
---
So if a hillbilly downs all 4 survivors and slugs. Hook them all once each they should pip based on 4 hits and 4 hooks?
---
Then you better make a cake then
---
What was his perks
---
He got rank 6 without uncloak, imagine when he learns to uncloak. 
---
EZ rank 1, GG.
---
IIRC the guy specifically had no karma penalty for killing him after you've talked to him. Blasted his face right off.
---
quality
---
I got hit with a hatchet far away from any survivors and got a protection hit. When I join chases to take a hit for the injured guy then what do you know, no protection hit.
---
For this VERY specific moment that nobody actually does?
---
Most of the time i think survivors are virgins
---
It's console
---
Yea good teammates don't start rolling in consistently until like rank 4. Even still you'll get a bunch of no brainers a good 30% of the time
---
I created a speedrun category simply titled "murdering vulpes any%" and I own the WR of 5:18. Just shows he's basically useless
---
Even better...
---
It‚Äôs clearly a shot from the studio during an interview.  Set dressing using art from your game is pretty standard for those kinda of settings...
---
Insidious noed nurse hiding behind the exit gate
---
F.
---
bonus points if they start hitting me whilst i‚Äôm on the hook. that‚Äôs how you know you‚Äôve reaaaallllyyyy made them furious
---
That‚Äôs my secret! Every survivor has the same build!
---
what did i just watch
---
Well I meant the lottery winner more specifically.
---
Ace mains use Up the Ante instead.
---
My friend unhooks himself seriously like every fucking game.
---
Big brain is that self unhooks deny stacks of DHope
---
I gave the last survivor hatch. Guess who shit talked the most in post game chat? I'll never understand.
---
How? Console doesn't have dedicated servers yet
---
I was doing the final gen. An infected Claudette comes up and helps me. We are almost finished.
---
Claudette decides to begin self caring. Plague comes with corrupt purge and downs us both when I get the gen to about 99%
---
I heard you can still hear her wheezing. If true I would just go to the other gate.
---
Burger King Myers
---
Oh makes sense
---
She only has 8 tf
---
Only the wraith and nurse do until the devs find some fan art they ship
---
The devs I think Mathew specifically said it was the reason for their valentines outfits
---
The wraith has the nurses heart in his weapon
---
is that possible holy shit
---
Some people can only procure human contact by being arseholes
---
I mean to each their own, I will just always see lithe as a weaker Sprint burst

* Most crossposts are automatically removed, as they are typically unreleated to Dead by Daylight.

Ash‚Äôs portrait looks sick!
---
Just leave ffs
---
As a survivor main this makes me happy
---
*No need for Iron Will if you playing Ace*
---
Bruh, you should be exploiting the animations with huntress. You clear the path after they drop it and you hit them.
---
I'm the guy who taps
---
Killers should not be at a similar power level. There is nothing wrong with having better and worse killers
---
No pretty sure she has 10 then they replace themselves.
---
Killing them both takes off 10 seconds. And yeah, both are pretty forgettable, but the lottery dude dies not long after if you follow him. Killed by radscorpions in the deep Mojave.
---
Yeah but the green recovery ones are much better and less rare, but it is fun to use
---
1. Can't find matches as killer, therefore can't level up
---
2. Stay at low rank because the waiting time is too long
---
3. Get your rank reset every month on top of that
---
4. Repeat the above
---
Ok.
---
Yeah?
---
I think unless the reviews on steam tank because of this issue they won't do anything about it. Devs are too busy adding cosmetics for people to spend money on
---
sprint burst is unironically the best exhaustion perk in the game, you just have to babysit the fuck out of it. 
---
most people don't want to do that so they'd rather just press E to a pallet for a free escape.
---
Uhh, I don't get what you just said but it's still better to bait them on dropping a pallet and removing one from a map.
---
I‚Äôve never waited more than 5-6 min for a game.
---
Might be an addon bc she only has 8
---
Well I understand their anger. Throwing away 70-80k for a 40k challenge. Not stonks
---
But if you dont heal survivors and or get chased by the killer and win chases your not going to do well. You cant be a gen jockey and pip. Is staying on 5 gens never getting chased even fun? No way I could play survivor if I never got chased. You need to be bold, apply a challenge to pip.
---
I played 3 games as survivor yesterday. Waited like 10min in queue for each. In two of those games killer DCed at the end bcs he was loosing...
---
Demise of the Faithful is the most story-rich of the killers, easily.  Many of the killers (deliberately, this isn‚Äôt a criticism) are heavily themed after classic horror tropes already, and their ‚Äúmovies‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be particularly distinct from movies already out there (Hag/Blair Witch, Billy/Bubba, Legion/A lot of things, Spirit/Ringu).  One of the things that I think made Plague/Adiris stand out for people (besides her top-tier visual design) is that her lore and character are a lot more unique in this genre.
---
Survivor wise, I similarly think the survivors like Jane, Kate, Yui, Adam, and Jeff are a little more interesting that the original four (because the original 4 were more directly based on slasher tropes while the later survivors have a bit more to distinguish them).
---
If Neighbor benig crime then you are arrest.
---
I was done with self care the moment it took me way too much time to heal myself. Iron will 100% but people also use inner strength now instead.
---
Sorry but no, her base is 10, I play her fairly regularly and I just googled it to check, no addon, she has 10.
---
His name isnt you my dad, its LickWits
---
Idc that you‚Äôre getting downvoted, you‚Äôre right, a meme build can be fun af to play once in a while
---
Hell for them is just a basement that they wait in for all of eternity because no one will ever come
---
I am haha. I mean I don‚Äôt know specifically which is worse to play. I was just saying I‚Äôve heard ppl say survivor is worse to play during rank reset. Last rank reset was awful for me. But this one wasn‚Äôt too bad. So idk. I wasn‚Äôt stating my opinion tho. I don‚Äôt play killer so I wouldn‚Äôt know
---
Gotta miss those insta-flashlights and 1st down moris.
---
Those were the best
---
Did they recently buff her? I could've sworn she had 8
---
Having more than 1-2 people on a gen with ruin active isn't a good idea, it's much better to spread out and get progress in 2-3 gens while someone looks for ruin or keeps the killer attention.
---
Also if multiple people are working on a gen with ruin it's better if one works normally and the rest tap if they can't hit greats.
---
 Hey, I really enjoy to analyze this match! ‚ù§ 
---
Survivors can't see you while being crouched down as Pig but OoO lights  up so they know from which direction you are coming from. That's why  they are running away from you. They know you are playing Pig so they can easily out run you. 
---
Perks BBQ - No value - You could see them anyway all game. Ruin - Over 3 minutes! But they just pushed through it Devour Hope - No value - Cleansed at the start of the game Haunted Grounds - No value - Was never cleansed 
---
Addons Last Will - No value - He still had 2 traps in the end Jigsaw's Annotated Plan - Made the rbt kill possible I guess 
---
Conclusion: Please evaluate Pig in another match using your own build or  maybe a build given to you by a Pig main instead of this non optimal  very luck dependent Viewer Build üôÇ I would glady watch Pig in her best light! Thank you for reading üëç
---
Not dead, but matchmaking is fucked up for rank 20s.
---
this would work better a year ago before the ds rework
---
Yeah a perk that basically no one runs unless they‚Äôre playing spirit. And iron will still helps against stridor so it still wouldn‚Äôt be one of the worst perks.
---
They haven‚Äôt recently buffed her but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôve only been playing since just before Stranger Things chapter, so she may have had 8 at one point I have no idea but since I‚Äôve been playing its always been 10 base.
---
Looked at my googling and seems people have mentioned her having 10 as far back as 2016.
---
I think it's more of the concept that your "meme build" isn't funny or enjoyable for anyone else but yourself in most cases. It's not a true meme if everyone hated it.
---
Like, imagine waiting 5 or more minutes for a lobby just to get insidious camped.
---
I highly suggest Iron will.
---
My killer queues on PC are really fast. Survivor at red ranks takes me like 5+ minutes to find a game.
---
/s
---
Wahh wahh, I want gens to be done in 4 mins. Wahh wahh.
---
so if a team of survivors make a mistake early on they should be forced to slowly wait until the killer finds them with no hope of escape? sounds kinda cruel and tedious to me. what if the team only fails because one or two survivors play poorly? Should the more skilled survivors have to die because if that with no option to redeem themselves?
---
I never knew the doctor could make his red stain appear behind you when you‚Äôre going crazy, until I was watching videos from when he came out. I actually saw it recently and it scared tf out of me cos I thought it was taken out. Is it just an add on or something? Other than that, it seems like it would get really annoying. Especially when you know the killer isn‚Äôt behind you
---
Insta huntress. I dont play survivor anymore though.
---
Thats... not the same thing, but ok then, don't need to get so worked up
---
Smurfs.
---
Yes I understand basic math, but you seem to not understand the question
---
So basically we can have infinite gens
---
Iron will is in all of my builds. Self care pops in there every now and then.
---
But the ways to do it have changed, right? They recently said in the patch notes that they had fixed this and that's also why the switch button for survivor and killer is gone
---
That‚Äôs rich lol
---
Tapp has a really good perk (I can‚Äôt remember the name)
---
Haha, glad you liked it!
---
You wouldn‚Äôt have been able to wiggle out anyway. You‚Äôre just searching for a way to justify a rage quit
---
Noob3 lol
---
what the hell do you mean?
---
I'm sorry 
---
She's cute but not hot
---
Everyone can have a opinion but you have a wrong opinion
---
I'm not sure if you noticed but that wiggle bar isn't what I'm talking about.
---
If you watch Ohm‚Äôs friends play Doctor when he was released, it seems like every match they had to deal with it. I wonder if it was a standard effect for him, and they nerfed it? Either that or they were just running that add on each match. Either way it‚Äôs an interesting effect, and I kinda like it other than how annoying it is to constantly be lit up lol
---
He's got tenacity, detective's hunch, and stake out.
---
Majestic! The queue times are so bad, they go back to the Renaissance and reveal the world's most gorgeous paintings
---
I'm rank 17 killer after the reset because I never play killer because the queues at that rank take so long and I'll never get to a lower killer rank because I'll never wait 20 minutes to find a match so I'll never be able to play killer again basically.
---
Welcome to the hookers.
---
If you‚Äôre cold they‚Äôre cold. Bring them in inside
---
I can‚Äôt tell if this is a joke
---
You should never work on a gen with Ruin with more than one other person. Ever.
---
But is a good fakecheck where I get punished for a few seconds rly better?
---
I like bloodhound.
---
That‚Äôs a good point
---
If there was 2v8's plag and oni would be terrifying
---
Doubtful that Miramax owns the rights to any of the masks, they don‚Äôt actually own the franchise at all. Just were more like a distribution company.
---
The company that owns the franchise and has produce every movie is actually Compass International, which is the company that was own by Mustapha Akkad, but now his son Malek Akkad owns/runs it.
---
What is more likely is they just made a mask that was close to, and said good enough. The mask does change throughout the series after all
---
For me as killer: 0/1 kill = loss. 2 kills = draw. 3/4 kills = win. I don't care much about pipping, but my playstyle almost always give me at least one pip.
---
I took an 8 month break and came back about 3 months ago. The queue times will be rough at rank 20 but once you get higher killer queue is instant and survivor is like 5-10 min.
---
I was a baby at the time. I was close to escaping but then Nurse got me. I was furious for around 1-2 days
---
The other difference is as a killer you can control how long the games goes. If you really care about pipping up, slug the survivors and let them heal so the game goes longer.
---
Must be your region or something, I'm on PS4 and it's the exact opposite, 3 to 5 minutes for Survivor and instant for killer between ranks 8 to 16.
---
You seem very invested in complaining judging by your post history...
---
I didn‚Äôt have anything against the perk but now I do
---
No one gonna mention the two redneck assassins running around with chainsaws
---
Detectives hunch is good, stake out is ok (great for ruin), tenacity is meh at best
---
You should never tap. Just take the regression. Even that‚Äôs more helpful. Tapping distracts other people
---
I don't understand how even 2k can be considered a win, not mentioning 1k
---
I'm in the UK, I cant see that affecting things much. Maybe it's yours?
---
How did he not see you when you entered the locker
---
You activated my trap card! Trap in the corner next to the pallet!
---
Yeah it was actually pretty confusing for me when I started playing the doctor. I kept wondering why survivors were running around all lit up red haha.
---
June 14, 2016 Salt is introduced to mankind
---
Jane has some of the best perks, shut your fuck
---
Waaiiittt a minute. You‚Äôre telling me it‚Äôs visible to the killers? That would be so weird and interesting to see
---
Head on, inner strength, Q&amp;Q, and ds
---
lol i do this a lot
---
Strange. I was playing at you ranks not long ago, on PS4, and in my experience killer queues are shorter.
---
Op is mad cuz bad
---
I wish there was a pre game lobby where you can just fool around before the match. Thatd be fun
---
Then you find out the killer is spirit
---
Then no I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
Real talk takes me 20 minutes to solo queue survivor but i barely have time to open up youtube on my phone after i start searching as killer before my lobby gets filled by full swf
---
Oh your DS. That sucks
---
I've been in these ranks pretty much my entire game life and that entire time, I have never had a survivor wait be longer than a killer wait (aside from bugged out queues)
---
That face.
---
But I don‚Äôt think it should activate in an instance like that anyway
---
Yeah, I imagine a 2 meter muscly  adult guy among children in basketball team, and manager be like "we couldn't promote him to the adult league because he beats opposing teams too easily, so we can't really determinate if he's good or not".
---
Had this happen to me tonight on PS4, successfully hit my DS skillcheck, no killer stun, still stayed on shoulder, and wiggle bar showed no progress whatsoever. someone please explain
---
Had a game where I memed around as chest security bubba. Basically I protected the basement chest at all costs, but I wouldn't attack people who unhooked their teammate after they tried to open the chest. I just stood there until someone touched it.  
---
After the game I get a steam comment on my profile. Got told to get cancer for camping
---
Dwight's little smile always gets me
---
And wraith
---
I really wanted to love him also but he's just boring to me. And I can never get a hit with the demon strike because that damn Club takes up the entire screen so I can't see shit.
---
Anything?
---
Could you imagine if the entity was some 49 year old otaku wearing a Naruto headband rubbing his  neck beard with Cheetos stained fingers?
---
... nevermind, grossed myself out
---
Depends, if you get a lot of them, of course not. But the thing to do is for one to search for the totem, while the others try to repair in any way. Everyone searching for it will lead in 0 Gens done xD
---
Yeah it is, the Survivor looks like they have a red flood light on them constantly.
---
Arguably ripping someone's spine out can be considered doing something wrong
---
NOED or Franklin's, easily. BBQ is powerful but its less obvious in its impact to the Survivors.
---
Can‚Äôt get camped if you don‚Äôt go down (black pointing finger at head guy meme)
---
I do nothing because I finally have the time I need to scratch my nose or take a sip of a drink.
---
I don't know, generally when people bring this up everybody says the same thing about PS4, instant killer queue and a few minutes for survivor.
---
If someone properly explains all the lore of dbd so far, I will award you the poorest of awards. A silver.
---
One time, I pissed a spirit of so much she facecamped me for the last gen and continually hit me on hook. There was only 1 person left so she 100% could have gotten the 4k but she just wanted to hit me on the hook. I didnt even do anything super toxic, I just had iron will so I just did a few spicy things. She insistent that she won because I died and she laughed at the fact that the other person left me on first hook to die while she was face camping, but I think of that game very fondly and she is also screenshotted on my steam profile.
---
Yeah lol, Killers seem to find a new scarecrow: Toxic Survivors.
---
Before that they were bragging about Killers in general being underpowered, but now that official statistics has proven otherwise, they had to find themselves a new excuse.
---
Hey! Don't tell them!
---
Where you been boy? He has a Vietnam sweater with zombies on it.
---
Yes. So long as you stop working on the generator for 2 seconds or so after.
---
During this time the generator will spark, you won't be able to progress the repair any further but you can still trigger another skill check.
---
So boiler rooms are real?
---
I didn‚Äôt even buy it or care and I‚Äôm still high key bitter that ‚ÄúNightmare‚Äù edition doesn‚Äôt include Freddy.
---
I mean, he did unknowingly get set up as a executioner by his boss
---
&gt;Seriously! I'll give an offering to have us all start together and we'll spawn on top of a gen.
---
That offering is kinda a trap and best to avoid in the blood web. Survivors only have three "hidden" offerings that arent shown to the killer, so experienced killers will know when they see a hidden offering that either you burned the offering to spawn as far away as possible, or that you burned one to spawn in a group. Either way they will spawn in and instantly book it to the other end of the map to find you and pressure you and all of your friends at once.
---
It is generally more efficient to have everyone spawn separately and work on different gens. Each additional person working on the same gen incurs an efficiency penalty (unless someone has prove thyself). But even still, it is better for the survivors to immediately spawn in and start applying pressure on 4 different gens in 4 different areas of the map. The killer can only focus on one person at a time. If they find the first person and that person can lead them on a decent chase of about a minute, by the time the killer picks them up and hooks them the other 3 survivors can pop 3 gens in 3 separate areas. Much better than spawning as a group and hoping you dont get found and can crank out one gen quick. There is a good change your group will get found by discordance, whispers, or killer luck quickly and then everyone is scattering no one is making progress.
---
Clearly its, Beginner's luck
---
Human demogorgon monkaS
---
I still hold the belief that the Entity always takes people moments before they would have died anyway.  Jane and Adam‚Äôs lore both seem to support it.
---
Yo it‚Äôs fuckin real holy crap
---
How did you find the bill was there when you got out of phrase. Sorry couldn‚Äôt understand from the video
---
I used to be a tapper / totem scavenger, but eventually I figured it's much less effort to just power through the gen; someone will eventually stumble across Ruin and you may as well do the objective in the meantime.
---
The practice at hitting hex checks is also awesome for the regular game, too, as you get good at hitting Greats.
---
Three people right in this post said the same thing that they get instant games on killer.
---
Casual mode aka veterans players butt fucking playground.
---
I got facecamped by a trapper last night. I was the first one he found and I stuck around till the end of the game to ask why. He was very salty because I ran him on the "infinite" on badham. A trapper. Carrying a trap. Yup.
---
Depends what you count as tunneling. Decisive Strike counts chasing two other people then downing the survivor doing a gen 2 meters away as tunneling.
---
Over 1.2k hours, both sides. I just always hated end-game
---
I want to try a heal slowdown build with Sloppy Butcher, Thanaphobia, and maybe Coulraphobia. Paired with Madness 3, they‚Äôll have to snap out of it and then heal super slowly.
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have all the perks.
---
I want that
---
Very well doneüòÑüòÑ
---
sure but that would make plag a better legion

But he‚Äôs fast as fuck boi
---
Well... Yeah. Unbearable controls, shit graphics, \[often being forced to play with\] no sound, poor battery time, overall simplification of games. But HEY!! You don't understand!! You can play A GAME while you're on the GO! 
---
For fuck's sake.
---
Heck, I've only been playing with another, single SWF, so the moment Ruin shows up I explicitly ask him "Are you doing a gen?" and if he answers positively, then I'll let him know I'm chasing ruin. If he isn't, then I'll just continue mine while he does the searching.
---
Win/win.
---
Used my favourite add on's to have an exiting game...
---
so? it means fuck all when when your power can only hurt people and slow the game down but does fuck all to down people in chases his kit is low tier but that doesnt mean he isnt viable
---
Vegas was so good, especially after I read a theory that the various major factions represent different ways to try and emulate the past. NCR is old world democracy, Legion is the Roman empire, and House is the totalitarian capitalism that dominated the pre-war world of Vegas.
---
Dont worry he has DS
---
I think we can all agree that there are toxic players on both sides and the queue times merely reflect the % of playerbase who play each role. Obviously more people play survivor because you can play with friends and it feels more relaxed than killer.
---
*DC
---
To be fair to the Claudette, you didn't even hit her, her downed position was well on the other side of the wall. Good old dead by latency.
---
At this point I just run small game and I end up finding the totem within 3 mins. Since most killers run ruin or NOED, it's become a mainstay perk for me.
---
I run sniper doctor add-ons with ruin, thrill, huntress‚Äô lullaby and overcharge. It‚Äôs a bang and zap build designed to slow the game to an unbearable crawl. They can‚Äôt clear hexes with sniper doctor, and after a couple hooks, they can‚Äôt pass skill checks. It‚Äôs wonderful.
---
It can take survivors off gems while you get a down. Making it snowball at least in my experience as a purple tank legion
---
to be fair... she should have just left instead of t-bagging
---
Damn i love clown cooking
---
okay :,(
---
I think Bram Strokers would be scarier
---
that snowballing will never be as good as a billy or even myers
---
Shoot at them while they're dropping the pallet, you're gonna end chases way faster.
---
Some people like to wind the killer up and tilt them. You shouldn't let it get to you, that's what they want.
---
High rank killer on PC is instant for me and survs take under 5. More on area I think
---
as both survivor and killer main, this makes me happier, I know for a fact she was just hiding all game doing nothing
---
Insidious billy
---
Anime pfp isn't bad tbh, that's people who are like that.
---
but wesley snipes as the killer
---
After 7 attempts i got the perfect way. I used deerstalker, bloodwarden, knockout and noed. I had to fake a farming match, so I could secure two hooks on everyone and with noed have no problem to kill them after opening one gate myself. The only problem was raged survivors telling me how I have to okay and how to complete challenges without strategy.
---
Slowing the game was kinda against the point, but it does sound fun for when I inevitably remember I hate survivors and want to torture them.
---
Extra secret leaked entry
---
It‚Äôs a different kind of slow. Instead of passively screwing them, you have to take active steps. It‚Äôs like a reward for you!
---
Not really set up, just was the unknowing executioner. But he did kill someone knowingly, even if they deserved it, whereas spirit and plague didnt
---
Or chest camping Bubba
---
it depends on time of day.  During the day, More people are playing solo, so there tend to be more killer players so killer queues are longer, but at night, more people are on, so more are playing SWF with their friends instead of killer, so survivor queues are longer with short killer queues.
---
Nea and kate click flashlights trying to get my attention the most often.
---
Plag and Oni is not a fun combination haha
---
You can only have 1 000 000
---
so while legion is good bc he does gen slow down but can not down with his power plag is worse bc she does the same thing? and with the right addons she is stupidly strong? I would have said less if u said Bubba but plag nah
---
IF it's level One then IF you hit normal Skillcheck Go off THE gen and in again otherwise you get a small time when the progress is stopped, but tap if you're more than One at the gen
---
I'll never understand that mentality, why would you leave the match? 
---
Sure, you got shit on by the game but why would you leave your team and screw them over? It's not their fault. You still had one hook left and even if you were dead why not just play it out and get some points out of the match. Makes no sense...
---
That‚Äôs not what I said but ok
---
A god of unspecified power feeds on the emotions of both hope and suffering.  In order to harvest this it requires two things: someone to create suffering and a victim to experience the suffering.  It must also allow the victim to feel hope that the suffering is not without escape.
---
Therefore it created an endless game in which it could capture both evil and non-evil people and force them into these roles indefinitely to feed on their emotions.
---
also don't pay Reddit for medals.
---
That's nearly everytime the case lol. I think i'll test this with a friend :)
---
You definitely have a good point with plague, but with spirit she wanted to do anything for revenge against her dad for killing her mum and her, but never actually did anything
---
ex Freddy main here who has BW teachable and uses it frequently, ***WRONG***
---
Well without the chest there I could have dodged the shot with the pallet down. There was no other way to prevent going down here. But if you want to share a clip of **you** doing that, I'm happy to be surprised ;)
---
Run towards him while chainsaw sprinting great evasion tactic just at an angle not like suicide style
---
It‚Äôs the speed that sets legion ahead. But like I said I‚Äôm not an experienced plague so I am probs wrong. Also I forgot about bubba so sorry. Bubba is the worst
---
what is this video clip from
---
Ive been a killer main since legion came out who only started playing survivor alot when the archives were released, but ok. I actually put effort to debate you and use logic l, funnily enough. maybe you should start playing survivor more and see if you still hold on to your opinion when you encounter crappy teammates who don't do shit, and are forced to find the hatch because nobody else is doing objectives.
---
Yeah I don't want to, but your description is too in depth to not auto imagine
---
LOVE BILL
---
I think killers secretly do too. I get the hatch mercy often as that silver fox. Also, some of the best perks imo: BT/Unbreakable. Last survivor probably has more use than I get out of it b/c I never run it.
---
So happy he got the xmas sweater.
---
Pfff. Nah medicine was great back then. Got a common cold? Just let out some blood. In a week or so you will get better... Or die. But it's one of these two, you won't be ill anymore! (Atleast not with the same sickness, maybe something new, who knows? If you do stay ill, god probably hates you and you deserve whatever you have).
---
Wish we had more of this today.
---
I'm a Nea main. Sometimes I pretend to be mad if i die after a match just because everyone thinks Nea = toxic
---
The dopest sweater.

Hail to the King baby.
---
*THE TRICKSTER*
---
Ever heard of essential oils?
---
The game was over tbh. His teammate decided to come down and try to farm everyone
---
Legion is unviable at red ranks. That‚Äôs just a fact
---
What made old freddy the worst killer in the game? his power did nothing for chases right. But he had built in wallhacks. What does legion power do? fuck all in chases 1 hit means nothing if u cant end the chase
---
The game isn't based on dead survivors it's based on maximizing suffering for the entity. Getting an immediate 4k doesn't do that. BHVR emblem system is still messed up even with that in mind.
---
He is and she‚Äôs short. But this is Reddit so everyone is ‚Äúright‚Äù as long as you get the upvotes.
---
Also with the apple add ons it‚Äôs a win or fail situation.  The gen one can make a plague op tho. But with red adding then the button can make legion good in chases and with unnerving it can destroy some survs who are not expecting it.
---
Getting shit on by the game 2x in a row and having bad teammates doesn't exactly bring out the mood, the guy that was next to me on the basement hook shouldn't have been there in the first place since I got chased, he hung around me and got downed with me like a gamer. Not to mention the Freddy was camping and you can't give BT in dream state, so he was just going to hit anyone that'd try to save at the entrance, I wouldn't get BT and just die.
---
Also thanks for not just spewing your wrong at me and having a convo about it
---
The same. It doesn't mean I don't want it to be trimmed a bit though. Getting grabbed or healed should disable it. Beelining to the locker for a free escape is silly AF.
---
I just searched "STFU I'm listening to" and found the original video instead of a meme template. Otherwise I have no idea.
---
I didnt knew him until I got matched with him. He gava me hatch and in the endgame chat people were like: I love your stream and so on :) and became a fan.
---
Altough, they change their names constantly so sometimes it's hard to know...
---
When does tome 4 come out again?
---
We need MORE essential oils. We should put it in the water. Or even better: We should replace water with essential oils.
---
It says "Blind the killer 4 times". I think I'll try it out for myself because timing isn't my problem, I'm just awful at aiming the stupid flashlights lol
---
If I try it at a pallet, I spend the whole pallet breaking sequence trying to get it at just the right spot only to be slapped as soon as the killer is done.
---
Its Bram Stoker not "stroker" my dude. Although It is funny imagining Bram "stroking it" lol
---
yes but with the right addons even wraith can be top tier and that is not how we rank killers
---
Why stop there?
---
I guess it's both area and platform then
---
You‚Äôre right OP should have used a map where it was impossible for him to win haha dumb OP
---

Yes but he‚Äôs not the worst

Holy shit! I miss that song!
---
Healthy Dead Hard pogchamp?!
---
Lol my bad deadass thought it was stroker my life is a lie
---
you opened the add on can with the plague
---
Why not call it The Count
---
&gt; The game was over
---
Makes even less sense to DC in that case.
---
Should be today
---
just blind at pallets always at pallets they break it u flash them
---
Reward is a bit unrealistic. 5 / 45 000 maybe? Being generous.
---
Rules for me weather i let you go or not
---
1: No
---
2: No
---
3: Nada
---
yes bc with addons any killer throws themselves into a new pool as a way to say that it is not a good way to rank killers
---
Por que no las dos?
---
I think that‚Äôs the purpose. It would be way too OP if you could sort of control it like dh
---
I started this without add 
---
on consideration
---
My small brain never thought of it that way
---
Complaining about others complaining . Bruh
---
Plague is much better than Doc and Leatherface
---
actually i would have dodged that. What you should have done was run around the outside of the shack (the window side) and then ran at an angle so you could quick vault, avoiding using the pallet and avoiding the hatchet.
---
Depends on where you stand inside the gate. I played two games against the same nurse playing like this and both times her heard her breath before we opened the games. Trying to tell that to the other survivors was a challenge though.
---
I know I have to practice and get better at it, but it's pretty daunting for someone who avoided using them all the way through red ranks lol
---
My profile is a mess. I don't camp or slug just for the hell of it, but I'll do it when the situation warrants. A lot of players have an all or nothing view of camping
---
&gt; doesn't exactly bring out the mood
---
Take a break? :) Games are meant to be enjoyed.
---
&gt; I wouldn't get BT and just die
---
Still makes no sense, you could've just let yourself die on hook and walk out with some points and maybe rank up (certainly not downrank two pips) so you might get some better randoms.
---
But you do you :P
---
and that is where I brought in Freddy he was legion without speed but he was still trash
---
old freddy btw
---
I can confirm
---
The hook bar pauses for x seconds. It will continue to degress once that time is over.
---
Now 2 years later I've started using Spine Chill again, and it's now immensely powerful since it works against every killer even if they are Undetectable. And vice versa, I hate it as a killer when whenever I come to a gen that's being worked on and can't find any survivors regardless of how hard I look. Stealth is too op.
---
SWF, one person is designated totem searcher. In solo queue, I do it myself
---
already red ranks and would love to derank tbh but at any rate yeah I should prolly take a break
---
Yea it is pretty fucking daunting to play survivor when I main killer but u know it is life
---
Yes but he couldn‚Äôt do a lot he had no way to take survs priority off gens because you could just fail a skill check and be done.new Freddy is better than legion cause of the fake pallets and snares tho
---
can't agree with you more. killer main who some days just play survivor cause i don't feel like dealing with the messages or tea bags
---
How are normal game mechanics toxic...?
---
For anyone saying Dead Hard is easy to counter: yeah sure if the survivor doesn't know what they're doing, if they use it to gain distance on a loop or make it to a pallet/window, there's no counterplay to that if you're not close enough for a swing.
---
* Screenshots, videos and gifs highlighting multiple disconnected players (use our weekly RAGE WEDNESDAY threads, make sure to censor ALL player names).
---
Yeah he should have just struggled out
---
After 200 hours i still suck at greats and can only hit them guaranteed if i get the holy 9999fps skillchecks which happen maybe once every 25 to 30 games. It's frankly just goddamn annoying that Ruin is in almost every game. At this point they should really just change the repairspeed and take out Ruin.
---
in europe at least i think killer queues are very short but survivor queues...grab a beer buddy
---
This is exactly why I come to reddit
---
Legion is pretty poo poo
---
Tapping (correctly) is faster than getting 3 or more good checks.
---
I think that‚Äòs supposed to be the downside. You could use Fixated alongside it to get faster without wasting SB. I think they should add it to Lithe. It‚Äòs kinda weak compared to BL and SB and forces you to abandon loops. Would be a lot better to choose to activate it when vaulting.
---
"When 3 mins into match no survs have been injured" ahh, so the game is over.
---
True true. I did that with little thought. Which was my mistake
---
Scenario: I have a key with the addon that lets your keep the key if you die. I die on hook.
---
Is there a key left below the hook for my teammates to potentially use? Or does it leave the match with me
---
Based on a true story. It was a P3 Nea not a Meg but I couldn't find any toxic Nea images with a flashlight (surprisingly.)
---
Two people DC at the start of the match (Claudette DCs on first down because it's a Claudette and then someone else leaves cause of DCer) and I find the third Survivor and hook them for bloodpoints. Chase P3 Nea to the hook and hit the person on the hook and nod: Nea just clicks her flashlight at me and then runs away when I start to walk towards her.
---
Well I hope you enjoyed your 7000 Bloodpoints Nea, and I'm sad that your friend only got 5000. Could've gotten way more but lol gotta teabag cause two people DCed.
---
that too
---
Please do Ghost Face yelling at a bunch of pink Neas :"The feminists are taking over!" *I'm an adult virgin*
---
On a side note: qhen they pop Haunted Grounds, i like to scream: You fell for it, fools. THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
---
To be honest with you, if all the oceans are already filled with essential oils, the only other place where we could store would be occupied by air (atleast thats the only other thing, I can think of). And I'm not to sure if it would be a great idea to replace air with essential oils because I vaguely remember reading somewhere that we need air to live, I'm not so sure about it tho, soooo if we don't need air I'm all for a swap there aswell.
---
In Arnold Swertzanegers voice!
---
Give me all those scarred hands and shackles... Though scarred hand worked weird last time I played it. It felt like survivors just get through clones anyway, or it has, like, 1/4 of their hitbox.
---
Tru3 got bad rng, didn‚Äôt get much value from his perks and made plenty of mistakes, what does he expect? A 4k?
---
HAHAHA!! that little peek before moonwalking
---
Leaves the match with you, killers actually enjoy that so then the people in the match can't come and pick up your key.
---
Why Yes 
---
(Halloween Music starts)üî™
---
it leaves the match with you :p
---
What about The Plague doing "WELCOME TO BIBLE STUDY WE'RE ALL CHILDREN OF JESUS" then vomiting instead of snorting coke
---
If it's spare, we fill there
---
I'm pretty sure if you die on hook the key drops to the ground.
---
I don‚Äôt know how you got this in your head but it‚Äôs absurd 
---
For starters, there should never be 3 people on one gen while Ruin is up
---
There are worse Killer's than him eg: leatherface, wraith, demogorgon, pig
---
(Whoops, posted this as its own comment first lmao)
---
then you realised you're on NA :(
---
Every killer, Leatherface in priority because of BBQ, then Hag for ruin then any killer you want to try or whose perks you want to get. I'd advise to get spirit for her good teachables and enjoyable gameplay
---
The Cunt
---
slugging then letting them heal isn't fun for either side tho. as much as I'd like to pip every game. I'm not gonna resort to lessening my own fun for it
---
So by that logic, it's the killers that are toxic as hell on the servers I play on? because it takes 30 minutes for me to find a killer match and 10 seconds to find a survivor match
---
Very nice info. Yeah I'm brand new to this game so my understanding is very low. Still trying to gain my footing on how perks and offerings all work. I have no problem buying leatherface üòè but how's Freddy? Heard he was surprisingly bad.
---
I'm saying Flip Flop would be broken, and MoM would be in a worse state than it is now with your changes in mind. That doesn't solve issues with either perk
---
Wow I loved Revelations 2
---
I am one that scatters but only because multiple people on a gen with ruin can be rough. Most don't let go after ruin pops so it takes forever. I just find another gen and look for ruin along the way.
---
and legion has? all u do is run or mend for 9 seconds that isnt a lot of wasted time only time legion works good is if u can snowball but this means nothing if they never die
---
I believe that's the point
---
its not false. I've pip'd from literally just doing gens then escaping. iri in obj and escaping and not getting into chase or helping your team is more than enough to pip
---
Myres is a stealth killer so nurses calling (from nurse obviously) is a good option to get easy hits on unsuspecting survivors healing. Leatherface gets you bbq which is amazing on all killers and hag gets ruin which is just as great. Otherwise it depends on playstyle. If you like being extra sneaky then moniter and abuse from docter will help keep an even lower profile when out of a chase. Infectious fright from plague is also decent on myres with his snowballing potential with T3.
---
This makes zero sense. Before this, it was the killer queues that took half an hour, and ‚ÄútOxIc SuRvIvOrS‚Äù still existed too. What a weird way to push your agenda against half the playerbase
---
I try to be but I‚Äôm a potato who doesn‚Äôt pay enough attention so I just hold people back so I just distract the killer as long as I can instead
---
T3 is terrifying. I took an entire team out in a matter of minutes. I'm definitely a stealth guy, hence the immediate purchase of Myers and ghost
---
That‚Äôs what I figured. Otherwise I could duplicate keys üòâ
---
Thanks for the answer
---
Omggg that would be amazing üò≠üíï if not thank you for trying !!!
---
Tappin‚Äô my way downtown, 
---
Meg got hooked,
---
Feng‚Äôs runnin‚Äô past,
---
And I‚Äôm fucked now.
---
Do you not play survivor at all?
---
I would, think it could make you a better killer.
---
I 100% agree with this.
---
When looping is toxic, you're dealing with a shitty killer who won't accept that they are bad, but they still facecamp you because you were "toxic". That doesn't mean you should start bringing OP items to the next game though, because that killer isn't the guy who just acted like a POS because you were better
---
yes, its completely untrue IF you don't punish them for being bad. thats a great counter argument. you do that and they could black pip or even pip and they did nothing but be so bad that you had to play bad enough to get yourself a rank up. which is the fundamental probellem with the ranking system. i shouldn't derank if i completely stomp then(i might not rank up, but i shouldn't derank. which has happened)
---
Apex Legends and the fact TitanFall 2 is free on PS4 right now helped revive the player base a metric fuckton
---
But your logic is flawed by the fact that you count an escape as a win, which it isnt, a pip in ranks is a win, which you will achieve regardless of escape if you played the whole game "well" and didnt escape because team played poorly.
---
Surely, but in addition to exhaustion you got 10-15% slowdown
---
If you enjoy stealth then you might like to try myres's scratched mirror add-on which gives you 32 metre wall hacks in exchange for locking you in tier 1. Great fun on indoor maps.
---
w h a t
---
That's going to be my new motto in life.
---
But it‚Äôs not an actual event. The winter solstice is pretty much purely cosmetic (with a bloodhunt before New Years) and they copy/paste it in every year. 
---
I‚Äôm still holding out hope for my snowy menu and bing bong music, but if nothing is announced/started by Friday, I‚Äôm guessing we‚Äôre SOL :-(
---
I honestly can‚Äôt be mad at that
---
That‚Äôs without healing from injured which would eat up time too while you get your first hook or down
---
Ghostface is such an underused Killer imo, love him.
---
This is one of the biggest issues with secret Offerings. They are not secret at all. If a killer has one, it is 99 percent of the time a Mori and if a survivor burns one you just hike to the other side of the map and have both out of the way.
---
We need a lot more secret Offerings worth using, so that they can actually be secret.
---
Self care, no mither, sprint burst, dead hard
---
My thoughts exactly. You shouldn't ever be put in a situation where it is impossible to win, no matter what side you're on.
---
Billie Lean
---
Is there a perk or add on that even when you blind the killer they don't drop the survivor?
---
Happened to me the other day against an Oni.
---
Very nice. Yeah, I can tell it's going to take awhile to get the hang of these perks haha
---
;)
---
But having a rate of 30% of games that are impossible to win in any way does not bode well for balance. A perfectly balanced game would mean you win 50% of your games, but have the potential to win all of them.
---
Then suddenly one of you is Exposed
---
I just deleted it, can't even get into a game as I crash in the loading screens on half of the games.
---
Haven't played a more unstable game ever, main menu animations and looks are fucking awful as well.
---
They need to rewrite the entire code holy shit
---
This also happens to me.
---
You fuck my shit
---
This community thrives on whataboutism. No point in trying to fight it.
---
I really want a novel about the trapper
---
I know right -_-
---
I can agree with those changes, the pipping system is extremely poorly developed and needs to be changed. A good note for me is that like Tru3, I consider a win to be a pip. Therefore, with the current pipping system, getting wins is extremely inconsistent to the game's outcome.
---
Honestly
---
There is no perk that does that. Without seeing a clip of the gameplay my guess would be that you blinded the killer early. If you blind the killer too early in the pick up animation they will still be blinded but won't drop the survivor.
---
Clearly my point about 1 killer went over your head. Since you can escape via the hatch and other means, survivors would have little to no need to work together if they got a pip for escaping. They can hide all game let the other 3 die and get out via hatch. The other ppl can do the heavy lifting. It‚Äôd like haven for the immersive gamer. Which they exist. It was also why I said that giving survivors a pip just for escaping is bad. That‚Äôs the sad reality part you missed. It incentivized survivors to screw each other over more.
---
I‚Äôd also see way more justification of giving 1 killer a pip for killing 4 survivors than giving a pip for escaping. 1 person just beat 4 others. Said person had to stop gens from being completed, no one getting out via hatch, no one out of gates, no one DCing. 
---
You‚Äôre trying to equate 1 person having to do everything to 4 people that can split work as being equivalent in this, which it isn‚Äôt. You can have 1 really good survivors and 3 bad ones gen Riders and win the match. If a killer is bad no one will die unless survivors are bad. I play killer because I find it an actual challenge, while playing survivor I can make a lot more mistakes and still win, because there‚Äôs the chance that the other 3 can cover for my mistakes. Compared to killer, playing survivors is like taking a vacation. BHVR doesn‚Äôt need to make it that much easier or screw other survivors over that much more by giving them less reason to work together.
---
And it isn‚Äôt hard to queue up with 3 rank 20s. I‚Äôve been in games at red rank where there‚Äôs a rank 2 with 3 ranks 20-15s. Maybe it isn‚Äôt 3 rank 20s, but I can see that becoming way more common if you piped by just escaping.
---
That‚Äôs fucking stupid
---
Brutal Killer is the black pip, meaning no change.
---
I've never seen some one get 4 kills and still get Entity Displeased. Maybe if survivors were hammering out gens at mach speed and you were a Billy who saved yourself using moris?
---
Why would you ever use the offering to start together? It's one of the worst in the game. You're in deep shit if you're up against a killer with Discordance
---
If you timed the blind wrong they won't drop them. The timing specifically requires you to get the flashlight blind the millisecond they can move the camera, which is when they'd drop the survivor. Before that they won't drop them.
---
I think looping is stupid, not toxic. I don't like being a giant killer with the Benny hill theme playing in my head
---
Anyone used nurse pinks? Seem horrible
---
As killer I see that and literally just walk away, once they are out from behind they can‚Äôt go back under, so I just turn right around and get them that way. Just mind game them pretend you don‚Äôt see them.
---
Just do the gens. Ppl make too much of a fuss about Ruin. You‚Äôll even start hitting more great skill checks when you stop worrying about the totem and focus on improving at skill checks.
---
This is so cute
---
He COUGH
---
I remember when I first bought the game... Used to do this for the most part, figured camping to be a normal strategy... Oh boy do I feel sorry for the new players I did that to.
---
And they didn't DC before you reached the hook? Not that toxic.
---
But the points you make are exactly why a grossly overpowered survivor role is killing this game. Survivor queue times are atrocious, lasting sometimes 20 to 30 minutes for me on a lucky day, hours on unlucky ones. This is because nobody plays killer anymore, myself included. You say that there should be an incentive to play survivor but there already is one; far too many in fact. If the game keeps up the way it is, there will be no more killers playing, and the game will die. In a perfectly balanced situation, both sides have the exact same chance to win and you pick based on what playstyle you enjoy. Not because one is more likely to win, as it is now.
---
Perk itself isn't bad, but Self Care users are too used to being healthy, give killer free hits and heal when they don't need to
---
My Sabo Jake has takes effect! Unless you discard your hand, you cannot hook a Survivor card and the Ebony Mori has no effect!
---
I mean yeah, if you dunk on kids over and over that doesn't mean you're good at basketball.
---
Also the kids then get demoted to the toddler leagues because they were actually two toddlers stacked on top of each other.
---
I'm not saying it's a great system, just that any reasonable skill rating system (ie Elo, Overwatch's SR system) accounts for and diminishes your rating reward when you're matched against some one the system thinks you should be dominating anyways. DBD opted for a very simple low-granularity 20 rank set up that only evaluates your per-match performance, so instead you get black pips for quick games that probably aren't reflective of your skill.
---
I wish there could actually be something like this one day. (Like 3 killers in a match or 2 with like 6 survivors)
---
you are correct on that one hahaha
---
Resilience has been on my bucket list to try for a while. Is "This is not happening" any good? I tried it for the rift and it didnt seem to make much of a difference
---
I'm also currently trying to learn how to play without sprint burst / lithe, i'd consider dead hard if it worked more often than not
---
Yeah, killers werent averaging a 4k
---
I was a killer this game, but someone was looping me hard and i could not touch him. I was running billy with tink cuz why not and decided i would commit till it goes off. Well it did, i reved my chainsaw and flicked to that direction and insta-downed someone. From there the game went down hill for them. Being killer takes more situational awareness, no matter the killer.
---
Bbq shows u auras after u hook someone, the game is honestly playable without it but ruin u need for sure
---
You know that actually does sweeten the deal for me quite a lot.
---
Technically, though you can also save shards and dump them on the shrine for an instant 600k+ refill lol
---
I think it‚Äôs weird you‚Äôre defending using self care as a survivor because killers like it. Like, that should tell you something
---
Sounds good. As a stealth guy BBQ sounds really good.
---
Exactly. Thank you.
---
I appreciate the tips but isn't it bad that people have had to resort to this for a challenge? (I don't blame you by the way, the struggle is real)
---
Those statistics are a joke. They don't take into account DCs, hook suicides, rank, survivor skill level, and a whole host of other variables that I can't even think of now. Tru3 gave an idea that would show how viable each killer actually is, and that only shows certain aspects. The fact is that with the way this game is, pure number statistics will never show enough of the situation to paint a perfect picture.
---
Because survivor is super easy? Especially if you play in an swf.
---
No mither, MoM, unbreakable, solidatory
---
Vampires are so boring and unimaginative. Any interesting twist on vampires is already in place in game.
---
I always scatter to a different gen. The last thing I want to do is sit on a gen with someone who can't hit Ruin skillchecks.
---
You raise a good point. It's one of those perks/abilities in games that are good but are often used incorrectly.
---
A lot of people who run Self Care don't want to ever be injured and heal for no reason. There's a time and a place to use everything.
---
i love how i used to get so much shit for using sprint burst and now everyone is using it and agreeing with me lol
---
Just know if someone is really close to the person ur hooked, their auras wont be shown, at least thats how i think it works
---
Tru3talent normally slugs 3rd guy for the 4 k.
---
Why? Because he counts pip as a win and sometimes, you need to slug to get merciless.
---
Sorry, but mechanic that makes a killer slug to just get a 4 k is stupid.
---
The only healing perk I bring these days is We'll make it.
---
I have, didn't really enjoy it. Tried forcing myself and just didn't have a good time. I understand looping and usually just ignore those people who try to get my attention unless they are in swinging distance. I usually patrol gens. I've actually won way more games than I've lost so I must be doing something right. I might try playing survivor again because I have Laurie. I'm a huge Halloween fan so that's super cool. But playing survivor brings up new questions I guess.
---
it doesn't work against Ghostface I can tell you that.
---
That's not how the game should be. You should never, no matter your role, feel like you are helpless. As survivor, you should always have something you can do to help yourself, though they will sometimes need perfect precision depending on how bad you messed up before. As killer, you should always have some way to make a comeback, though it will become gradually harder and harder depending on how bad you fucked up.
---
In my mind i thought it wouldn‚Äôt be as rough... As you can see i‚Äôm quite the idiot o_O
---
Red Rank EU PC
---
Killer is instant
---
Survivor is either instant or longer than 4-5 minutes
---
Oh god another survivor main screaming about BHVR‚Äôs junk stats.
---
Great.
---
That might actually make it easier to find them. Im pretty strategic, I patrol around the hook immediately after hooking just to see if someone's bold enough to run up
---
If I see the people running about... I will tap up one gen.  Then i may scour around a bit, save off a hook or two.  
---
Gotta get myself to that not losing a pip point of course
---
I agree, I am a killer main, but I achieved both rank 1 with killer and survivor twice in a row.
---
I am not bragging, I just want to express that I do play both sides and I have to say that hatch is just obnormally stupid.
---
Real nibbas gen tap after ruin has been cleansed
---
The official statistics just show that a lot of killers 2K more than they 1K lol. 
---
And in like rank 6 and above, a 2K is a depip lol.
---
it's been great getting this stuff all the time with current bugged af matchmaking
---
No bbq isn‚Äôt necessarily for the aura its helpful but it can also double blood points so you can half the grind
---
Yeah no... I literally replied to a new topic. The killer main made an entire thread about it. Try again sweetheart
---
Yeh
---
And yet when faced with a team like this, every killer loses. You should not be forced into playing the same killer or the same build just to have a chance to win. That's not how a balanced game works. You should have the potential to win with any killer and any build, just as you have the chance to win with any survivor build. Not saying you should win every game, but you should have the potential to. This game was actually impossible to win.
---
And consequently the ranks of those with long survivor waits might be the reason why.
---
I see no sin here.
---
i think flip flop is decent but needs something added to it, maybe reveals the killers aura to all other survivors when knocked into the dying state. something to make it more viable and not dependent on perks like tenacity or unbreakable. Buckle up just isn‚Äôt good. I have no idea what to add or change to make it decent so I‚Äôm not gonna waste my energy on it. MoM is tough, the perk isn‚Äôt as bad as it once was since protection hits got fixed, but i think there should be more ways than one to get it. Maybe every time you take a protection hit or get knocked into the dying state you get a token?  Or now that i think about it maybe for flip flop every time you get knocked down you get a token that increases the conversion rate of recovery to wiggle
---
Wow polish people are so annoying. I could barely understand the mumbling and screaming.
---
I want there to be a powerful alternative to escaping killers that isn't running around the table. Honestly I'd want stealth to me much more emphasized. The tension and fear is what drew me to this game but most of the time being seen means nothing... Hell you need to be impaled three times on a giant rusty Hook to die.. if prefer it if games were... Faster survivors could escape faster and killers were more dangerous. But that would be tricky to balance.
---
 It Dependens of the rank this meme concern to red ranks
---
Nobody cares
---
He is a killer with a great amount of time in the game, he should therefore be winning over people with less understanding. The point I'm trying to make is that even at his skill level, there reaches a point as survivor that you become untouchable. As killer, you're only waiting for the survivor to make mistakes. Neither side should have to rely solely on mistakes to win. Yet that's how killer fundamentally is.
---
Cool, well like I said I've literally never seen any of those discussions. I have however, seen a lot of people complain about long killer waits and short survivor waits. This post for example.
---
i didnt say u cant make a comeback or a great play that wins u the match, but in general the killer isnt in control of the match and that feels bad
---
I'm not proud of myself for this, but I have to confess. I needed either a 4K or a hatch escape for an archive, and it was kicking my ass for some reason. Just having an off night I suppose. But, that doesn't mean I HAD to go Bubba, with a pink Mori, with insidious, and whispers, and...
---
... the team was dead in minutes D:
---
All killers should be red rank viable. And not just red rank since any survivor who understands how to do gens can make it to red rank. They need to be viable against teams like this.
---
I'm trying to say that they shouldn't be like that.
---
So rooms are real?
---
I'd rather have the Ability to Prestige one character to Prestige 6. Giving them additional cosmetics for mains. You can change the Prestige but your old Prestige 6 gets lost when you switch
---
I dont know what this has to do with my comment?
---
about that...
---
I dont know how he never saw it, I tried to sync up the sounds of the lockers opening and shutting, just dumb luck I guess
---
I don't disagree, the system can do with a lot of improvement (by junking it and figuring out a proper ass skill rating system). My point was just that even in really well tuned rating systems you can decisively win and still see no or little rating boost. That's not unique to DBD.
---
I scrolled past and came back to comment about how dumb this post is and I just saw...
---
Most of the time i play with low rank friends so i use them as totem cleansers while i do the hex gens and in the end they say i'm good at videogames.
---
Ignorance is a bliss.
---
Gens are generally near totems, so I continue to do gens and just do a quick check for totems around the vicinity.
---
Camping may be a legitimate strategy because they have no reason to get multiple hooks if they could camp and tunnel individual people to death.
---
Based on my end game chats, I'm pretty sure that the average age of DBD players is around 13, so you might be right.
---
I like the concept =), but personally i'm not too excited about another ranged killer.
---
I wouldn't say no to a Left 4 Dead Hunter though.
---
Tru3 played bad for his skill level that round and not to mention his build being god awful, as well as Pig just being an ok killer. What he‚Äôs complaining about is a small percentage of the player base, which is a 4 Man co-ordinated SWF that are all good players. I don‚Äôt get why he complains about it when he‚Äôs a solo queue survivor player, he knows that most teammates he gets and other solo queue players will get are trash/not at the same level as the survivors in this video. So why does he want to balance the game around the minority instead of the overall player base, that makes no sense in the slightest. If he wants that to happen then no one will play survivor, because they will be awful, queue times will get worse than they already are, people will stop playing, etc... The only thing that should be done to stop games like this is by making every killer viable at Rank 1. He‚Äôs already found good builds on killers (i don‚Äôt agree with them being 3rd best just because the build he uses is good but that‚Äôs irrelevant) and the devs are also buffing every killer with Doctor being next up. 
---
TLDR: Survivors in general are far from OP, just co-ordinated SWF, which you never get.
---
If they where to do this i would hope to got they would let us keep all our items, offerings, and perks since most of us have a shit ton on our mains.
---
You give the killer a good time by not playing like a jerk. What perks you use have nothing to do with it
---
Tapping and still breaking hooks thinking they won‚Äôt repair themselves.
---
BHVR has said before that killer gets map choice priority but I don't know how it would work if two people use the same offering.
---
killer perks tend to be way more obnoxious then survivor perks
---
No Mither,unbreakable,self care,sprint burst and a map offering for black water swamp
---
no mither, iron will, resilience, dead hard

You forgot about hangman‚Äôs trick!
---
Pharmacy, Ace in the hole, Plunderers, and Bond
---
Deal all of those moderately above average drugs and illegal toolboxes
---
Unless they have iron will or the killer has no ears there is no good way to hide while injured. You leave blood grunt and moan so it‚Äôs not that easy even with the gen and heartbeat that still leaves a blood trail for them to follow
---
Dude, omega blink Nurse was one of the easiest thing in the game, no wonder her kill rate went down after it was removed... It just showed how many bad Nurse players were around.
---
Yeah with an offering. But haddonfield is extremely survivor-sided, because it has really strong loops. The only scary killer on that map is trapper. You learn to loop sooner or later
---
Well, not quite. According to your point, they guy that ALREADY KNOWN to be a high rank, gets little reward from beating low ranks. If he's known to be a low rank and beats low ranks easily, he gets faster promotion. That's where DBS is unique. In DBD "ranks don't matter".
---
I know, but resetting to a rank where you have a team of green and grey ranks will quickly remind you how bad some people are in this game^^. I havent been in those ranks for a few months now, but trust me, there are regular games where killers get 3 or 4 kills because the survivors thought that maybe the Insidious bubba has gone patrolling after he got his second survivor hooked in the basement.
---
Is this real?
---
I like him strictly because i'm also a fan of Left 4 Dead. Gives me hope that maybe, just maybe we'll see at least 1 L4D killer at some point.
---
That's why Prayer Bead were removed. They had no counterplay. But people don't realise most things survivors can do is like prayer beads Spirit against most killers.
---
OINK &gt;:D
---
Idk, I'm already sick with Huntress.
---
Give me more Billies! The funniest killer to go against &lt;3
---
It's not about hiding from the killer, it's about looping them. It doesn't matter to me if the killer knows where I am because if I'm at a safe loop, I can delay 30-60 seconds before I go to the next loop. The legions ability does nothing for them in chase, so you essentially loop him like the m1 killer he is
---
That‚Äôs what any language sounds like when you don‚Äôt understand it or aren‚Äôt familiar with a regional variation.
---
Well, maybe is a coincidence, or the killer is just like the map, but I have run at least 4 times with the same configuration:
---
Freddy + haddonfield + ruin. Maybe it was the same player, maybe a coincidence, but it's too specific, since I don't play that much.
---
If you are working on a gen together, gen tapping is the most efficient way. Also don‚Äôt bother actively searching for ruin, if you see it good, if not who cares
---
Good point. No real unbiased counters here
---
I personally think it's better to just power through it rather than tapping. It's not uncommon to get decently long periods of no skill checks where you do make progress no matter what. By and large you seem to make more progress, even with some missed checks, than you would just slowly tapping the whole time. Unless you really can't hit 90% of the checks, tapping is mostly a waste of time.
---
The polish are so toxic. This game is perfect for them.
---
I was actually running a bunch of aura-reading mori perks haha I think it was devour, discordance, rancor and nurse's.
---
Self Care is often just wasted time. Two survivors can heal each other in the time it takes a single Self Care user to heal themselves. Plus a med-kit does the same thing and while you might only get 1 or 2 uses to use in a match with a med-kit that's often all you really need.
---
Oh thank you! Wow that makes those challenges a lot easier lol
---
Really glad I hoarded all my event firecrackers
---
Did i say stronger or more obnoxious?
---
Freddy is good at shutting down loops
---
So what about me? I got to rank 1 playing base Nurse (only time I ever used addons were Blink Movement addons and even then I almost never used green and above) and now I‚Äôm capped at Rank 4. And on top of that, it isn‚Äôt fun to play Nurse anymore. I‚Äôm having more fun playing Legion and losing than I am playing Nurse and winning. That speaks a lot to how fun Nurse is right now. 
---
This basekit nerf hurt Nurse way more than you think it does. All it is is a Demogorgon shred that can go through walls. That‚Äôs it. The fatigue on top of a cool down is too much. If a basekit nerf was needed, then it should have targeted her fatigue stun, not adding a whole new cool down.
---
I just analyzed the game, nothing more I did :) No clue if you would have a chance because I am not a Pig main. But he was definitely Perk/Addon less in that match so I can only assume something else would have helped.
---
I didn't mean to evaluate the Survivors, I am just concentrating on what he can do better as Miss Piggy.  
---
Balancing the game is Behaviours job, I try to make the best out of what Killers have currently.
---
From my post we can see he should try other addons and definitely less gamble perks! üëç But there is nothing wrong with playing a less optimal fun gamble build on Killer, just don't expect for it work in every game. üôÇ
---
Perk suggestion: Ruin Corrupt Intervention Brutal Strength Enduring  
---
I wonder how good Nemesis + PWYF would have been in that match ü§î You lose a lot of time to get your 3 stacks but when you got it you can definitely mindgame more pallets instead of breaking them. So you should get pressure more early.
---
Some parts are explicit, others are less clear. Great game all the same tho
---
Yep, much like how you don't cleanse vs plague, you don't heal vs legion, and they are essentially both powerless 115 movement speed killers at that point
---
Yikes, the irony just killed itself. Why the hell you came from asking a stealthy build and then complain about what they give you? If you're so critique about this you should already have a fixed idea on what build is the one you're looking for. The whole doctor problem is being so aggravated that he's top tier now. To be honest either way of playing (spread or coop) is good, but because you can only get 2/3 gens done by being spread out and you can basically finish gens in strong loops you come to a point where you should cooperate to finish gens. To cooperate before mid-late game is the best way as it leaves strong area only to work, and it allows few people to work on it and both waste killer's time. No wonder why top players prefer to start the game with a survivor to quickly complete an objective. Statistically you're correct about gens speed, but the point is the gen has to reach 100% first, not complete the match first. You should have enough knowledge to understand what I mean.
---
Practising enough and reliably hitting greats is faster still
---
Are real?
---
This is such a weirdly specific stereotype, I‚Äôve literally never heard of it. Usually it‚Äôs Russians with *cyka blyat*
---
you sir, are a man of class
---
It‚Äôs not really poor game design then is it? If they are basing it off of the fact that the entity feeds off hope then survivors need hope that they can actually escape. Therefore the 4K should happen closer to one gen or powered on gates.
---
people write that no matter what you do lmao, I think it's funny wrecking a 4man SWF and seeing "4 news comments on your profile" appear, i'm assuming you've never actually played killer if you haven't got a single salt comment before
---
I can‚Äôt see anything going wrong with this build whatsoever
---
It doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Moris. It‚Äôs that the ranking system is fucked up and if a killer ends the match too quickly for any reason the game punishes them. Say you‚Äôre Billy and chainsaw someone in the first 30 seconds of the match, then the other 3 basically run up and just want to die for whatever reason. So killer ends up with a 4k and de-pips.
---
Say you‚Äôre playing Myers, you get tier 3 because 3-4 are repairing a gen and not paying attention and you down 4 survivors in like a minutes after that and get the 4k. Killer will de-pip.
---
I even played a game at rank 5 as plague and all 4 survivors ran up to me so I‚Äôd kill them all quickly and they didn‚Äôt have to play against plague. I lost a pip for that.
---
There are other ways this can happens and it Has 0 to do with Moris. The killer literally has to make sure the game goes on for a time because being too good will make them de-rank at a high enough rank.
---
At least sabo has some sort of niche use in destroying hooks to potentially get survivors off of killer‚Äôs shoulders lol.
---
My god you went zooming to protect that guy.
---
I know right
---
When I play killer I love when survivors bring any healing perks or items.
---
can‚Äôt get killed by the killer if you are the killer
---
Any slav will do really.
---
Source: grew up on the border of ukraine/poland. Its cold and we hated it.
---
In the description of nemesis it says ‚Äústun‚Äù
---
I mean I think it depends on what type of player you are. I‚Äôm the player that does the more probably stupid in the long run type of shit like taking hits, rescuing even if it means sacrificing myself, distracting the killer even if I‚Äôm injured and on last hook, etc etc
---
I find it fun to play like that, not really in it just to escape as easy as possible but rather in it to have as much fun as possible and that‚Äôs what I find fun to do. Would it be more beneficial for the team if I just found the totem? I mean yeah. I‚Äôll get the totem if I see it but Im not gonna search for it and do nothing the entire time I‚Äôm lookin if I don‚Äôt have to- that‚Äôs just not my play style.
---
Yeah the emblems should be more killer specific.
---
which it does, specifically with a pallet or locker. some friends are trying to tell me it works with ds because both perks switch obsession and the "anytime a new survivor becomes the obsession" part
---
Yup but I‚Äôm not at red ranks and not saying he is top tier I‚Äôm saying he is viable until rank 5. Plus at the rank I‚Äôm at purple ranks, were the best survs make mistakes and if you can capitalize on said mistakes it takes out the whole powerless killer. Plus you can hit and block with feral frenzy when you stop your power. So they have to run away from the loop or go down because they didn‚Äôt have enough time to get there
---
Bruh. You‚Äôll get those bad players at all ranks, just less of them on average.
---
It's a nice change from the several months where killer was basically unplayable due to wait times.
---
Now I get to play the more relaxing role whenever I want.
---
A good counter for Freddie is Alert because of his gen hopping teleport you can see what direction he is going to go next (as in if he is facing your gen, WALK yourself to a locker)
---
Not fun. More fair.
---
getting a 4 man kill just because of the egc
---
Nah it‚Äôs better to tap, no one is going to hit all skill checks so why bother. Tapping effectively doesn‚Äôt take too much time off it. Just tap.
---
depends on your level as well
---
He just vibin‚Äô
---
You and me play the same. I'm sure we would create a totally average but fun team if we grouped up.
---
At red ranks everyone pretty much ignores ruin. Especially on maps like the game and Lery‚Äôs. Ruin is a pretty big slowdown but it puts a lot of pressure on killer if 2 gens are done within 3 min with ruin still up.
---
It depends on the tier. First tier, no problem. Third tier, I gotta find me a totem.
---
I fr don‚Äôt understand why everyone just runs away when the first skillcheck appears, I‚Äôm even in red ranks lmao just hit the skillchecks or work through them, finding the totem is such a waste of time
---
Couldn't find it in the r/pcgaming Q&amp;A. I definitely heard it before.
---
Spine Chill used to be a perk I used all the time but now I am a bit eh about it now. I know people are like "Oh spirit counter!" But I find I forget to use it and Alert is just aces at helping me locate the killer.
---
Demogorgon is good, just difficult 
---
Wraith at least has map pressure 
---
Pig‚Äôs traps provide more stall than DW and her ambush is a better chase ability than FF
---
Bubba is debatable, but I‚Äôd say his insta down makes him better, plus nemesis+PWYF
---
Otz put up a "sandbag your friends" video, and it made me realize that SWF should be doing fun stupid stuff, and probably be in custom games, instead of making life hard for others.
---
What's so appealing about having an advantage over the killer? I get that randoms can be useless teammates, but that should just make you better at the game.
---
Should I change mine to m4? I set it to f cause I mainly only use it as hag for teleporting
---
This tome lasts until the next midchapter, right?
---
same i hate it so much
---
Sorry for my screaming noises then.
---
In my OPINION (so no one gets the idea I‚Äôm trying to state ‚Äúfacts‚Äù here) green ranks is were every killer starts to not be viable. Cause I‚Äôm green everyone understands how to play their roles of runner gen jockey or healer. In purple everyone has mastered what the specialize in and learned the others so everyone in purple can run decently in red everyone has mastered almost everything for survs and then it makes it near impossible to play non meta killers (unless your otzvarda)
---
I‚Äôm a repairer, but I‚Äôd rather see other survivors tap than spend 5 minutes looking for the totem.
---
Still killer was more toxic than us
---
Some people don't even know how to tap right
---
Trapper. I hate Trapper.   
---
I also hate Legion, even if they suck. They are just extremely irritating and I hate having some weird sh\*t on my screen.
---
Well if the dumbasses are gonna stack up anyway then it's better if they tap
---
Yes
---
He isn‚Äôt the reason, he‚Äôs the conclusion
---
You forgot about moonwalking-Frank's Mixtape Legion.
---
Spine Chill saves me all the time. Specially against invisible killers. Maybe I will learn better in the future, but I really can't drop it now. It change my game from "always dying really soon" to "now I have a true chance of doing gens and escaping".
---
So, why does Bubba suck? 
---
I mean, the two measures of a killer's raw strength is mobility/map pressure and ability to end chases quickly. Bubba has the second. He has no map pressure, but then, neither does Myers or Ghostface or Wraith or Doc or... So why is it Bubba is seen as even worse than the stealth guys?
---
I mean, I do.  
---
It's the only way you can pick on up on sounds from an Insidious gamer, as well as a cloaked Wraith, a crouched Pig, a sneaking Ghostface, and of course, a T1 Myers breathing.  
---
Using your ears is pretty much the best counter to stealth, for both killers and survivors. It's also good for situational awareness in general.
---
Whatever works best for you. &lt;3
---
Not sure about that one. It's sad, but even dbd will die eventually as game.
---
DS does not trigger the part of Nemesis that changes the obsession. DS does change the obsession on its own which does trigger the part of Nemesis that gives you the Oblivious status effect and reveals you for 4 seconds. 
---
DS Stun lasts longer than the reveal.
---
I have won games at purple ranks with trapper without having any traps set so a bubba can def win
---
You make some good points, and I agree with a lot of this. What I don‚Äôt like is when people insist that they ‚Äúdid nothing wrong‚Äù and still lost. There‚Äôs always something more to do, always a way to end the chase quicker, especially when Tru3 really isn‚Äôt that great at pig. I brought up scorpionz as an example of someone who knows pig a lot better and can use her to end chases quicker. I think it‚Äôs dumb that Tru3 did play pretty good, got a 2k, and because of a dc didn‚Äôt get his emblem. I think the ranking system is pretty whack, and that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt use it as a measure for success as much as I use killing. But look, this game was a loss for 2 survivors, he only let 2 escape. Acting like he was powerless and the survivors walked all over him just isn‚Äôt a fair statement.
---
Don‚Äôt come at me and say my opinion is the reason why this game isn‚Äôt going in a good direction. That‚Äôs kinda rude, I barely expressed an opinion in my first comment to begin with. Let‚Äôs stay civil here.
---
Good luck out there in the fog
---
You've justified "alternative", sure, but "good"?  Nothing on a phone-brick is going to play "good".
---
You said it yourself "unless your otzdarva". The reason he can play with every killer is he has found a build with every killer that synergizes with their power and just generally plays killer well. You can get to that level with any killer. Sure  the best legion main in the world won't be as powerful as the best nurse main in the world, but that doesn't mean you can't stomp survivors in purple. Once you get to red, you have to play out of your mind but you can still do alright against survivors most of the time. Sure every killer has a different learning curve to them and some are easier and harder, but that doesn't mean they aren't viable at Green purple (or even red sometimes)
---
Every match has different survivors so unless you take a pool of matches like that you can‚Äôt say for sure it was purple ranks or just potato survivors
---
I still want a survivor that used to be a killer in his old life and his perks involve giving him bonuses while debuffing his nearby teammates. Like a reverse leader
---
Number of gens = number of players. It's called using variables/algebra in your code rather than specifically coding every single possible scenario, this is something you literally learn in your first 10 minutes of programming man, come on.
---
I would and wouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôd be irritated but I get the play so can‚Äôt be too mad about it. What I would be pissed about is if they all started t bagging after making the play which is what I usually run into
---
Those stats explicitly omit games with DCs so the actual kill rate is likely even higher and even at red ranks the kill rates are well above the intended 2k average.
---
You get what you deserve
---
A blade dlc would be cool. But who would be the survivor?
---
i chortled
---
I‚Äôm referring to the fact that you wrote a bunch of paragraphs taking something small incredibly serious.
---
Hence the ‚Äúno fun at parties.‚Äù
---
I didn‚Äôt even read what you just wrote.
---
Do bones
---
Yes, but with how fucked ranks are rn it‚Äôs normally a rank 17 or 16 that is the week link. When ranks are fixed the weak links won‚Äôt be as weak. But if it is and your playing bubba then it‚Äôs a matter of you can‚Äôt saw me from there and they have popped 4 gens even without that 4th surv it‚Äôs a matter of how strong the ability is and if it‚Äôs easily exploited like how you can stun a wraith or make a bubba bump into something. It matters how strong that counterplay is. Legion has a weird one. Juke during frenzy but you can fight it as legion easily once you see that. With bubba it reduces your standard for saw chances
---
One of my mates and I who play DBD the most do this. 
---
Our two other friends who barely play call ‚Äútapping‚Äù a tech they do. 
---
We are all one big happy survivor family.
---
You're a cunt though for running an infinite, even IF it was Trapper.
---
To walk the whole god damn match, i see i see...
---
Have a good day my guy. I wish you luck in your future trials
---
I think it's just way too easy to pip as survivor. I can get 0 saves, do 0 gens, get tunneled, and still pip...
---
But im not the one that defends the hatch mechanic, thats the guy im replying to who says hatch is necessary, which i say its not because you can pip without hatch.
---
I agree, it shouldn't be easy to win against good survivors, they should be rewarded for the time they put into learning, but it shouldn;t be imposible.
---
First strike, Decisive strike, Final strike, so killers can't play at all
---
But aren‚Äôt they isolated and tortured in between trials
---
No a spell card
---
Yeah, because most likely you were being an annoying twat, clicking a flashlight and T-bagging.
---
But the fact that there still exists an option to guarantee a loss for any side is atrocious. No one side should hold all the power, and yet in games like these you are at the mercy of the survivors. You should not have to wait for one side to make a mistake to win. Ideally, if neither side made a single mistake (which would never happen but still) the game should come out to a draw, i.e a black pip. Currently, if neither side makes a mistake, the survivors will pip or double pip, and the killer will depip most of the time, black pip very rarely. That is not a balanced game. That shows bias to one side.
---
dude this entire sub is recycled content
---
Killers won‚Äôt be able to sacrifice you at all. Slugging? Nah, unbreakable.
---
You don't have to be close. I was accused in a match where "Make Your Choice" activated every time someone was unhooked. They're literally given an alert that the killer is nowhere near them, but still claim camping.
---
I didn't camp, i looked for the survivor who just tried to flahlight save as i picked him up near the hook
---
how's it "fair" that survivors are forced into an almost winnable situation just because the team as a whole was outplayed at the beginning of the match? imagine if there is 2 gens done and only one survivor left. the survivor has no realistic chance of finishing the gens and escaping unless the killer screws up big time. the survivor has no choice but to either dc or wait to be found and hooked while doing gens, which could take ten minutes. that is a waste of time and extremely boring and unfun for both survivors and killers. with the hatch, both players have to race to find the hatch first, and the hatch can be closed by the killer, so there is counterplay. There's nothing fair about having your fate decided at the beginning of the match. in any game that takes skill, such as chess it a fighting game, there is always a chance for a comeback. if you take into consideration the fact that your teammates could die because of their own mistakes, then it's even worse.
---
Lery's agaainst wraith with spies from the shadows be like
---
Killers absolutely don‚Äôt need a perfect game to have fun, no argument there. But when you don‚Äôt play a perfect game, still get 2 kills, and then say it‚Äôs all the games fault because survivors are op, then I‚Äôm gonna say that that‚Äôs a pretty bad attitude.
---
I personally do think a group of 4 survivors playing well are a bit too good. The game could give the killers a bit more to work with. Buff weaker killers for sure.
---
I bring up scorpionz as an example of someone who knows pig a lot better than Tru3. Does he play perfect? No, not at all. But he sure does play pig a lot better.
---
And I disagree, 4 sweaty survivors should totally make the killer sweat too. That‚Äôs part of the killers challenge, this is a 4 v 1. Survivors bring their A game, the killer has to match it.
---
32 * 0.24 = 7.68m
---
32 + 7.68 = 39.68m
---
If the killer has a 32m terror radius and if distressing makes it 26% bigger, the total radius will be 39.68m, rounded up, 40m
---
Oh ok yea thats true kids at red are toxic beyond all belief the matches against them are fubar
---
I judge it off the blood points you get per tap, I believe 20 BP or less and you wont trigger a skill check, anything more and you run the risk of accidentally blowing up the gen.
---
r/dbdgonewild
---
Only at higher ranks do you actually have to be active. I've seen too many survivors who jump from locker to locker or don't take the killer on a chase for more than like 20 seconds and they end up being purple ranks
---
If I put the last survivor on the hook in front of a gate and they yeet off the hook and leave I‚Äôd flip my shit
---
Have you used him? His chainsaw without charge add-ons takes a remarkably long time to activate and combined with the slow down you can only get survivors if you start the charge when literally up their ass and maps don‚Äôt have a layout that generally allows that.
---
Also, his swing hitbox is pretty wide so you can‚Äôt hug loops at all
---
Keys and mori'd need a serious overhaul, anyways. The quality of the game will improve the moment those change.
---
If you're a 32 meter terror radius killer and use distressing you have a 40.32 meter terror radius. So on other terror radius amounts monitor and abuse is better at increasing the terror radius. But overall if you're trying to increase the terror radius on a killer other than the doctor, monitor and abuse is better overall since .32 meters really doesn't matter that much.
---
I mean, he was right though. Altruism fucked your teammate over. Also, face-campers are almost always justifiably pissed. There are far too many cheesy loops and toxic Survivors. The best part is, even though Survivors behave far more arrogantly and disrespectfully, they're also 99% of the players that send me hate-mail.
---
Eh I don‚Äôt think satans the worst thing I think making up a fairlytale and having more then half of humanity believe it and do dumb shot over it is worse and let‚Äôs not even get into the old catholic joke... lol
---
wtf is this abomination
---
Why do you think Botany needs a buff?? It‚Äôs a great perk I run it all the time it saves so much time
---
Tapping feels like an exploit to me I prefer to just repair normally
---
If you don't constitute a win as a pip then your view on the game is vastly different then mine, thus our arguments will never truly see eye to eye because our fundamental basis of the game is different. In my opinion, if you do better than the team you face you should face better people i.e rank up. If you lose, face worse people i.e rank down. Currently, you can wipe the floor with the other team and derank. As survivor, you can get your ass handed to you and still rank up. This shows an intrinsic bias to the survivor side and needs to be addressed
---
Try red ranks first. If all you did is generators without being caught, at most you got 2 Iridescent and 2 Silver (Altruism and Evader), and you can't pip with that.
---
usually it's when they try and unhook right in front of you and then call you out for being a "facecamper" because you haven't teleported to the other side of the map magically after hooking someone, or just watch them get a free unhook
---
Again, yes, it is a bad system in dire need of replacing. It lacks granularity, its sliding pip system barely measures performance across matches, and rank isn't actually an adequate measure of skill but a vague gesture at a proper skill rating system. Rank is an absolute measure of performance instead of a proper relative measuring, so its very easy for some one who does good at toddlerball to accidentally end up in the adultball leagues.
---
A good system will try to figure out how a match should end and adjust its rating changes accordingly. When a high skill player beats a low skill player, or a low skill player loses to a high skill player, little changes.
---
DBD, being a poor approximation of a good system, only measures you against some arbitrary idea of a good match instead of making relative measurements. It has to throw up its hands at a steam roll and go "Well we fucked up sorry these people don't belong here. We'll figure you out later." Its only safe assumption is that the people you just destroyed were of significantly less skill than you because it hasn't actually been keeping good track of any one's skill level.
---
Rank isn't an adequate enough measure of skill to do anything else.
---
Killer for Chapter 15!!!!
---
I sit for 20 minutes waiting to be killer but join instantly with survivor around rank 10
---
"I get 4ks all the time" is not evidence enough to any point. We need many, many more factors and even then it won't be truly enough evidence because it will be anecdotal at best, contradicting at worst.
---
You're one of those cunts... Probably a sweaty SWF-only player.
---
Also, stealth killers can find survivors in vulnerable positions. They can cause panic pallet drops, free first hits are very valuable etc.
---
Thankfully I used all my Abdominal Dressings on Feng when medkit charges were bugged last week.

problem being that killers have too many tools to counter Stealth as of now. Several killers have built-in mechanics into their power to help this, as well as there being like a dozen perks that allow for easy tracking or aura reading on any and all survivors, a lot of these perks having no hard counter themselves.
---
Even with full-blown stealth builds, survivors can't really lose a competent killer more than once, once the killer realizes the build they're going against. At this point stealth is impossible to make the meta playstyle, and while fun the few times it works, it definitely isn't successful enough against killers who can track.
---
The value varies by killer as the terror radius is different between them.  For example the huntress's base terror radius is 20 meters according to the game so it becomes 5.2 meters larger. 32 is the most common base terror radius and in that case it increases by 8.32 meters. For another killer, you can check the character info for their stats and do some simple math to find it as well.
---
Use the pallet, get the mallet
---
It could be either
---
Sure, but this one annoys me in a sense that not only is it a low effort of slapping text on a premade format (as you said a majority of this sub) but if camping isn't one of the most beaten dead horses in DbD than I'm the fricking Pope.
---
hag for ruin, Doctor for monitor and abuse, hillbilly for enduring, leatherface for bbq, clown for bamboozle and pop goes the weasel, plauge for corrupt intervention and infectious fright, nurse for a nurses calling. Of this I'd say leatherface, hag and clown have the best overall teachables. moniter and abuse is really strong in Myers btw.
---
killer also couldve had lightborn
---
I do think self care useful only in combination with botany
---
If there are 2 gens left and 3 survivors dead, killer should be able to get a 4 k.
---
He beat them so he shouldn't get punished.
---
Man fuck new Vegas. By far one of the most overrated games ever made.
---
You brought back broken old MoM but better. What the fuck
---
Main objective is gens so if you're in a corner healing for like 80sec it waste time.  Botany knowledge, resilience, iron will and dead hard bring a medkit and 99 it and you're set
---
It‚Äôs like that one movie stitched but instead of a guy doing it to 3 girls Dwight killed meg...
---
I can assure you survivors prefer to have a longer game than a shorter one with shit points. If you like the feeling of stomping the enemy team, then you do you.  
---
Don't ezpect the game to reward you for that though, lore's theme is despair.
---
I never have the patience to do that
---
This whole point is fair. I agree. I'm jw how you can take rank seriously in this game? Its a joke especially with rank reset. Everybody is playing everybody the ranking system sucks
---
I'm aware, I wish they had gone the direction of making stealthy horror the most powerful method of gameplay rather than boiling down to a game of tag with five people and you're always 'it'
---
That is literally what I said, yes. That was literally one of the two possible paths I postulated to getting a de-pip, yes.
---
One shot killers get bad chaser emblems. The chaser emblem is bad. It is busted and does not account for one shots. This is known.
---
lmao we need an official list of low budget knock off names for each killer
---
New Vegas fans are full toxic
---
Obviously I haven't played it firsthand but the Billy I was watching seemed to be able to do most things you can do on PC.
---
https://youtu.be/XmWaWLw_j0s
---
Luckily I've liked playing as the doctor. I've got him pretty high on levels so far. Still working on him. Thanks so much.
---
That's adorable!
---
u can use plaid flannel and maybe a fatigue reduction addon, for more easy learning, also its probably the hardest killer so u have to be really patient until u get results
---
It worked thanks we had a really fun time :)
---
The draw back effect is instant so decisive would be useless
---
Some times they actually put effort into is so props to those guys
---
it was like that near launch, and it led to boring games with hardly any interactions at all, with people usually dead on first hook super early into the game.
---
nah.
---
Are you going to color it?
---
I have to rotate my camera around behind me a certain way to be able to hit "greats." I'm weird with weird habits
---
You're right next time they should just give up and jump on the hook lol
---
Well, you know...
---
I kite and juke really well (meg hype) but dont feel like i can ever get the hang of any good loops. i also dont seem to be able to find them to try to use em. i sit around rank 8-12ish survivor.
---
You too buddy, hope the matchmaking gods put us together
---
This might be surprising, but sometimes killers are toxic for no reason
---
It doesn't really matter at the end of the day, you can win with self-care and without self-care. Survivor can also be played perkless without any trouble at all, at any rank and you don't even have to be amazing at the game.
---
What's pretty fucking stupid is that there are only 3 killers which have a chance of winning against a good team.
---
Every time i stumble upon a killer that can be looped, i actually feel bad because i know he is gonna lose 100% unless the rest of the team reaaaaaally fucks up
---
What do you mean? The rule #8939 clearly states that 'Any killer who uses the perk "Barbecue and chili" will be considered an enemy of the law and will be attributed an pecuniary sanction of 375k bloodpoints to our master, the Lord Entity. Whenever the one guilty won't fulfill the duty to follow the rules and/or won't pay the aforementioned price will be given to anyone who brings this criminal to the law, dead or alive, an reward worth 750k-1300k. These rewards will be added to the total sum of the headmoney on the criminal.' -comma 2.3, rule 8939.
---
Ye I‚Äôm the same on pc so heheheheh you see a legion then imma give you hatch
---
It really is. I'm just waiting for it to actually mean something
---
I know, that's what I enjoyed :/ If I got caught it felt like i twas hopeless, over. I liked that, it make it more tense, and scared. If I caught someone, there was a good chance they were dead, instead of a flock of wild survivors running in to lift someone off a meathook and frisk them for contraband
---
Me too. Then I will agree ranking up is a win, right now to me it isnt
---
Approach these Pigs with caution. They might be tired and hungry, or maybe they've had a bad day. Pigs are sensitive and short-tempered Killers that should be handled with care. If you see a wild Pig approaching you might want to give her some space or let her take her frustrations out on you as expressed through a dash attack. Do not fret if a Pig puts a reverse bear trap on your head as it's usually a sign of affection. The Pig is giving you a hat. Snoots should only be booped when you are sure the Pig is in the right frame of mind to receive them.
---
No, try stealth, corner-juking, regular juking, using pallets that are conveniently-placed (not known exploitable loops), etc...
---
I'd rather have level 4 perks for those specific characters. Meg gets a slightly longer SB, laurie gets DS twice or some dumb shit
---
At first I was a tapper. Its a good place to start when you're new to the game and learning all the killer perks. It's not complicated and it keeps the game moving.  
---
Then I got small game and I started going right to totem hunting once ruin is confirmed. BUT even with small game I've had so many matches where everyone is hunting ruin and not one gen is popped by the 3rd kill. Small game takes some finesse to use and it can take you in circles until you get the feel for totem spawn points (I still struggle on half the maps) and even then you might burn through every other totem before you find ruin.  
---
Several shutouts later, I've made a rule for myself that when there's ruin, I don't start looking until I've powered through at least one gen without tapping. I still run small game but I'm thinking a switch to detectives hunch might work better in my case.
---
Lol thanks, but dont. If you kill me, you kill me, no need to give me hatch
---
Quick and Quiet, inner Strength, Head On and Adrenaline.  Become the locker goblin, bonus points if you're playing as dwight.
---
I am! I plan to put it in a sticker pack along with 
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cetkbo/amanda\_art\_ill\_be\_making\_into\_a\_sticker/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/cetkbo/amanda_art_ill_be_making_into_a_sticker/) 
---
I just have to be "not busy" with general life to get a full killer sheet made
---
It‚Äôs not fixed for me, I was running the pharmacy perk and the Medkit I picked up depleted in a couple of seconds smh
---
How im suggesting a nerf
---
so it's ok that the survivors have to wait around to die with no chance to make up their mistakes? yeah ok. that's like saying that someone who fails senior year of high school should be legally unable to find a job again for the rest of their life because they "already screwed up, so they should just deal with it". nobody should be put in an unwinnable situation like that period, I don't care if the killer plays good in the beggining, no survivor deserves to deal with that bullshit just because the killer feels entitled to a 4K instead of 3K.
---
I'm sure, but in my experience, far more Survivors are toxic than Killers. That doesn't mean Killers get a free pass. Hell, I wish Billy would be rebalanced because I find that BBQ, Pop, Tinkerer, and insta-saw are WAY too powerful. Spirit was a problem to, but she got nerfed. I just don't experience toxic Killers as much as Survivors, despite playing Survivors more (because I have friends that play).
---
I don't know if it counts, because it's my main build, but:
---
Tenacity, unbreakable, flip flop, decisive strike
---
Pretty hot not gonna lie-
---
I hate how people still gen tap even though it‚Äôs still quicker to hit all good skill check and keep powering through
---
That's actually adorable. I had a match earlier where I booped a Pig early on and for the rest of the match she wouldn't hurt me but continued to go after everyone else until another person booped her and then she gave them the VIP treatment as well. The two non-boopers were both mori'd after their first hooks and the Pig brought me to the hatch and stood there nodding her head so I have her some more boops. An unspoken bond was formed from that first boop.
---
Aye, as I usually play around 2am I understand that.
---
I see a lot of people using that! Specifically a bunch of streamers/youtubers I watch
---
I‚Äôm used to it on space bar but if I didn‚Äôt already have my crouch as M4 I would probably try that too!
---
I like crouch M4 because I can hold it down for longer easier than any key on my keyboard, since this game has no toggle crouch
---
Killers used to be able to, I‚Äôm sure they changed it because it was too powerful.
---
I would say rank 3 would be the fine line between boosted players and those who actually play well.
---
Pharmacy has always been that way what do you mean?
---
only Bill?
---
Bro if they run an infinite literally just drop the chase and look for someone else if it bothers you that much lmao. Yeah you'll lose pressure doing so but I can assure you it'll have a better outcome than chasing a Meg Thomas whilst screaming in Bloodlust 7 Bubba Chainsaw.
---
Because the devs see camping as a strategy and sure it is. 
---
It‚Äôs just not fun for that 1. Person, or for everyone when someone dcs, or when you have dumb teammates going to the hook.
---
the all seeing build, i love empaty, really underrated perk
---
Oooh that‚Äôs smart, I like that one
---
You sound like fun.....
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSWiMoO8zNE
---
When you're a red rank survivor with almost 1k hours and still can't loop properly and get greedy with pallets when you're very aware the killer will hit you..
---
***sigh...***
---
Fair enough point there. I'm just of that mindset where teamwork and survival is the focus. I've sacrificed myself to save others and pulled some goofy shit  to be sure, but usually once I think I've gotten my pip. I guess I tend to be goal-oriented in games now that I think about it, but that's just me.
---
u have to open the gate yourself, its more easy
---
this is why i prove thy-self even if i'm not the gen jockey of the group, being able to do the gen faster before skillchecks appear is underrated, i can somewhat do them but my friend is getting in the bad habit of gen tapping so i tell him to just do the damn thing with this perk.
---
It's a viable perk for basement bubba. Leave him be, defending his chests.
---
"Hi, I'm Nancy Wheeler. I don't need friends, they disappoint me" *gets hooked*
---
Tapping on a totem, anyone?
---
I SEE EVERYTHING! - Dead by Daylight Survivor Build
---
Yeah it really helped my crouching, in other games I use C to crouch so being able to keep my finger off of the C key and keep it on my movement keys is very nice
---
It does matter since you don't go against these OP teams often. And it is very much possible to win even against these teams as shown by many youtubers/twitchers. It probably isn't possible for everybody but that's not really a problem since you shouldn't win against someone that's playing better than you. That's how competitive games work. You wouldn't call csgo unfair because your team of friends doesn't stand a chance against pro players.
---
I'm pretty sure the devs don't see it as a strategy, you loose emblems or points or whatever you wanna call them if you stand near the hook for too much without other survivors being near it
---
This!
---
lmaooo bt refuses to show up on my bloodweb for yui and it has been hell üòîü§ô
---
see thats why i said if you know how to use it properly, SB doesnt have to be used at the start of the chase, if you know what you are doing you have just as much control over SB as you do with DH.
---
Sb can be used just like DH to extend a chase but even longer, it can also be used to get out of any dead zones you find yourself in
---
Did you get a chance to use it pre-nerf? Now that was fun. Too much, really.
---
Doing gens, you?
---
Then I will go to hell with a giant smile.
---
Would be cool aswell. More things te killer has to look out for and more time needed for the survivors to win. Makes it harder and more interesting for both sides.
---
Tomes will always last but the rift is going to end I think in 20 days
---
They put that in due to the outroar of people complaining about campers and that they where in high ranks. They can appeal to the player base without agreeing.
---
I like your reasoning. I feel it fits the genre better too. In a slasher film the killer never gets them all right away. The killer could have just been hit by a car and gets up to chase someone yet a flimsy wooden door might save the protagonist.  Really you want them to get away and only snuff out the light when they were so close to the end.
---
Not at purple or red ranks.  You need 12 points to pip in purple and 13 in red.  If you "do 0 gens" you're not getting better than silver for lightbringer, if you get 0 saves you're not getting better than gold for benevolent, if you "get tunneled" (which I assume means die fairly quickly)   you aren't getting better than bronze in unbroken.  So your max score is 10 points.  This would be a safety pip in both purple and red.
---
What did this perk use to do? I'm still relatively new to this game.
---
YEEEEEEEEEEEEES
---
I love it! I think it would also be cool to see the metal hand cosmetic that he has in game, or even puppet Ash! Some blood and shmear would do it some good as well. It looks awesome dude!
---
console but i‚Äôll be playing on pc very soon. also, thanks for the advice! :)
---
I literally did this challenge first try in red ranks. Slug the final 2 with Bitter Murmur and open the gate yourself to trigger EGC, then hook them. Not that hard at all
---
That was insane! I had to watch it 3 times XD
---
Oh it was released on my birthday, nice never knew that
---
Alright calm down mate, get some coffee play a different game or do something else to take your mind away. 
---
Just calm down. It sucks sure but there‚Äôs not much you can do so just calm down and make yourself happy again and not in a bad temper otherwise it can affect your whole day and your actions.
---
Camping, and even tunneling, are definitely strategies. Not necessarily good ones. As survivors, when a killer decides to employ those strategies we have to act accordingly and gen rush. Hopefully the hooked survivor, as crappy as it may be, will help you punish the killer for their strategy by staying on the hook for as long as they can.
---
It‚Äôs ok. I used to tap too till I forced myself to hit great skillchecks. It was embarrassing at first but it really helps.
---
It‚Äôs a fairly balanced map, each side has potential to win. Survivors have shack on one side, a potential god window on the other side, and depending on tile RNG can have insane jungle gyms all consolidated to the middle of the map. On the flip side it‚Äôs really easy for killers to do a 3 gen strat on this map. Don‚Äôt spread your gens too thin as killer and it shouldn‚Äôt be too rough.
---
I see the pallet got wasted because he was downed anyway but I still think it was the right play to attempt.  The window was bamboozled so he couldn‚Äôt make a play there and the huntress knew it.  The pallet was thrown early to try and give him time to duck the hatchet (even though it failed).  For my own reference what would be the better play? Go down under the unused pallet so the killer leaves you that extra but will checking the area?
---
Yeah must of been a weird glitch or just lucky to have hardly moved, kinda sucks though I like going back up a lot after rank reset.
---
And what wpuld the reason be?
---
That‚Äôs fair and I know there‚Äôs some survivors that do that but lately I‚Äôve been going against red rank survivors and a lot of them are doing it to be dicks that or the non stop flashlight clicking at the gates and running around in circles.
---
Easy ass challenge, I did it with Freddy, Bloodwarden, NoEd, Enduring, ruin. I just shat on them all game, got everyone on a 2 hook, then before end I slugged as many as possible. Opened gates, sacrificed them. 3k with BW and NoEd
---
Unrelated. I got the humble bundle dlc yesterday and played have for several hours. My fucking Ruin Totem spawns in the most ridiculous places. That things hanging out there like the fucking North Star every match.
---
I feel like I do ! Even I don't see killer aura, Bond and Empathy usually let me know where he's at (easy to see who's being chased).
---
To be used...
---
imo that map is just busted. I think Pig is perfectly viable and Tru3 made a couple mistakes, but nothing really severe.
---
It‚Äôs literally just that the map is busted af. The gen layout alone makes it excruciatingly difficult for the killer to win then it‚Äôs packed with pallets to an extent many other maps are not *and* has a very strong central structure that is essentially a free gen.
---
Also that pallet slam that hit from from behind the survivor was horseshit and it happens way too often to me
---
Copying top comment I see.
---
ugh, what now?
---
It may be my favorite. It tells so much. I think some people think it just helps you see where people are to get them healed up, but as soon as someone gets hit, I immediately know where the killer is, which direction he's going, etc.
---
Didn't see it. When i wrote it my apolegies
---
In regards to the pallet I think you‚Äôre talking about, he was literally behind her. That slam was absolute nonsense
---
Not fun for anyone else in the match who doesn't even get to play the game
---
It's not just about looping well or hiding from BBQ. Looping well isn't needed so long as you're helping your team out by doing gens and unhooking. Only people I get mad at are the ones who don't do a gen or unhook a teammate they're nuisances
---
Cant get dead hard on anyone and i already prestiged quentin
---
Thank you Kekoby, very cool!
---
Same lol
---
Yep
---
I 9/10 times try to power through it but I'm not the best player in the world at hitting greats so sometimes if ruin is like here's 5 skillchecks in a row I'll resign myself to tapping for a bit because at least I don't give the killer a free pgtw by regressing the gen so hard
---
Oh you didn‚Äôt know? Well just so you can know Susie has been practicing her throwing knife skills so she doesn‚Äôt have to rely on her sprinting ability. She‚Äôs always out of breath and doesn‚Äôt have great lungs.
---
It was a good time, but boy wont it be better in the future IF they make everything balanced
---
going down for the pallet would be a better play, but the best play would be to run around the shack on the outside (window side) and either running at an angle so you quick vault or baiting the vault if she could hit you.
---
another option would be to bait the window inside the shack and trying to use the lockers to avoid the hatchet by quickly hopping in and out.
---
just chillin.. hoopin
---
It is how I try it too, but the last one always hides in a corner so I can't slug'em.
---
Situation always fails somehow
---
Sorry for you then. I don't see these teams.
---
As I said in my first comment. Make the Gens take a little bit more time. And I forgot to mention to nerf some God loops like the one in Ironworks. Then in my opinion the game is balanced. Playing as a pro killer against a pro team of survivors is possible.
---
Btw im gonna post some stats I made over the last couple of months on this sub. Maybe in a couple of weeks. Need to make some graphs and stuff. The stats contain information like how many times I survived, how many kills a killer gets per game, how much blood points I get and so on. It's pretty interesting and even though it's just stats of my games I think it could give some information about the current balance.
---
totally, also the range its ridiculous
---
Pffftttt that's awesome
---
You keep all 4 alive till end game? You shouldn‚Äôt have people hiding
---
Cause its useful...? As long as its not sloppy then self care is just as efficent as a teammate healing you.
---
Creepycute boi
---
Which is always the corner of the map opposite where you are.
---
The trick about suffocation pit is that the survivors can three gen themselves so easily. By the end of the early game you as the killer should decide whether or not you‚Äôll chase throughout the board or if you need to focus on one end of the map. Bear that in mind and you can do very well.
---
At red rank when it‚Äôs swf (which is pretty much all I go against) 3 gen really isn‚Äôt a thing especially rn after the new rank reset all the actual red ranks are in red ranks
---
Why do some perks never show up as purple? This seems so random.
---
the Kill dow someone, there is so many hooks spread acroos the map that you can't guess toward which he will bring the survivor.
---
That means that you have to 99% almost every hooks of the map to maybe manage to save your teamate, which takes as much time as doing 2 or 3 generators.
---
That's trolling at this point.
---
I'm waiting for it in the shrine smh
---
I do
---
People play him wrong.
---
He‚Äôs the best camper. If you want to salt mine a SWF, play camper Bubba. Sadly the boy is not meant for patrolling.
---
Used to be unlimited :(. I'd say wasn't much of a nerf though, VERY rarely is someone out of it's range. And, it's such a long range - that knowing they're out of it is very useful information.
---
Getting out of newbie ranks is actually really really easy. It‚Äôs impossible to depip until rank 15 so you literally just have to play. The queue times are a bit wonky down there but ultimately just play chill and normal and you‚Äôll double pip every single game. There‚Äôs really no gaming the system so just make sure you‚Äôre hitting your catagory scores well enough. If you have enough control in the game you can even play more relaxed to let other newbie survivors try to play instead of going hardcore sweat mode.
---
Meanwhile me playing killer: Really another 30 second ruin match? I thought they said they were going to hide the totems better... I might need to bring something else
---
You say that and yet it happens all the time.
---
Do you even know how strong the vagina is? I'll take that as a compliment.
---
And Legion gets another random rework for no reason.
---
You cared enough to post a reply tho.
---
I thought it did change to only knock you back within the same color grouping but I could be wrong. I was Rank 2 and knocked back just to 4.
---
The issue, though, is that unlike most maps a 3 gen there barely matters. If you‚Äôre 3 genned and the killer comes, take off to the center of the map and you‚Äôre gucci. Either the killer embarks and a stupid long chase they will probably eventually win but loses the last gen, or you just defend the gen and get no survivors down.
---
I run pgtw,ruin,nurse's calling and discordance on spirit it works well for me
---
Luck needs a buff.  Should decrease skillcheck probability while also giving a slight buff to great skillchecks to encourage risky plays (lets say 1% extra progression for every 5% luck your character has, rounding down).
---
And every single update it runs even worse with more bugs
---
Don't bother, it's taking to a wall with that guy. Every other thread he's spewing garbage like this.
---
For clown I use BBQ, Ruin, Enduring and Spirit Fury for most games.
---
Imagine forcing yourself to walk around all match just for some epic yellow rank plays.
---
Can someone please explain to me why Trapper gets a cosmetic set every third Tuesday yet Spirit and Billy only have like 5 good skins between the two of them?
---
My first thought was basement trapper being a tryhard.
---
"Doods, they made the atom bomb for a reason duh"
---
üò•
---
Never BBQ, never Ruin
---
My sound isn't good enough to be that helpful, so I leave Spine Chill on at all times.
---
Do you recommend a killer to play?  I have the base killers plus Bubba,  Spirit and the Doctor.
---
i dont have clown but i love oneshoting perks on spirit something like bbq, ruin, HG, MYC or maybe NOED if u want to collect some pink himalayan salt in post game chat.
---
some people also run stridor, sloppy+nurses calling, enduring+SF, rin is very versatile, but her power with a one shot is really scary for survivors and hella fun for u
---
It isn't the chaser emblem that's the only issue, which is what you're neglecting. You can't get full points on Gatekeeper, Devout, Malicious (since some of the points from that come from hitting), AND chaser. While you're saying "You don't get full points in Chaser cause of 1 shot killers", which isn't an issue against good survivors, you're neglecting the objectives of the other emblems.
---
how
---
If that's the case then any legion who's wearing a sweater should be given a 4k. It's the season to be giving ya know?
---
This.
---
Killers can just tunnel people off hook and mori them.
---
And the number of games i'v had where theres 1 gen left, but why do that when they can just pull a key out and find the hatch and oh look, 3 people escape. In other cases i'v seen 3 man swf just let someone die and go for hatch.
---
if im not crying just dont heal me, iron will gang represent
---
what if he had noed?
---
Completely agree, threw it on a while back out of curiousity. Extremely helpful against most killers.
---
Honestly all of taps teachables are really good. I use stakeout wit detectives hunch and as soon as one gen pops I see *everything*. Tenacity is good in certain situations, but stakeout and DH are good in any situation. Also because of taps color palette he is better at camoflauge than a P3 Claudette.
---
Legion is the only killer who hits me from 10 steps away, everyone else actually connects. No idea why?
---
but it's really entertaining as survivor. What would you like survivor be like ? getting killed as soon as the killer spot you ?
---
Are you even a red rank survivor then?
---
Smiggles do you plan on making this a killer icon people could download to use ingame. I have every killer icon adorable but have not found a huntress one xD
---
It was nerfed a matter of weeks after Ash first came out. It used to not rely on protection hits, just any hits. Everyone ran it and if you had the free hit active and dead hard once the gates were powered you felt invincible. People would body block like you've never seen. When all 4 people ran it and used it strategically, it was a huge headache for killers.
---
&gt;killer exists on map
---
FACE CAMPING!
---
It‚Äôs probably bugged for you for something reason. The most recent patch changed rank reset to only set you back one rank color. If you went from 1 to 3 it‚Äôs just a bug.
---
Also before this rank 1 reset to rank 10 so either you‚Äôre still experiencing a ranking bug you always have or you‚Äôre misremembering
---
I do, aswell
---
Oh man, you've captured their "crazy" perfectly! Big fan of this artstyle :)
---
I don‚Äôt know what platform you‚Äôre on but I get multiple insidious bubba‚Äôs session I play. Usually also completed with a ‚Äúgg ez 4K‚Äù after the end of the match (which is dumb in itself since it‚Äôs so out of the way to message people on PS4). It‚Äôs made me want to quit the game before but tbh I do love this game in all of it toxicity just because of how unique it is. I was just presuming he gets them as often as I do.
---
The issue, though, is that unlike most maps a 3 gen there barely matters. If you‚Äôre 3 genned and the killer comes, take off to the center of the map and you‚Äôre gucci. Either the killer embarks on a stupid long chase they will probably eventually win but lose the last gen in the meantime, or they just defend the gens and get no survivors down.
---
At least you have actually the ability to teleport to a survivor and kill him instantly.

Wow these comments are depressing. I wonder if this community will ever realize how awful Ruin is and learn to do gens. "It only takes me a couple minutes to find Ruin" holy fuck. It's players like these that fool killers into thinking that Ruin is actually a good perk, and then they rely on it 100% to slow the game instead of properly applying pressure. And then when they go against actual good survivors and the gens fly regardless of Ruin, they are clueless about what to do because they've been relying on Ruin to play the game for them
---
I honestly didn't expect that to be a real sub, but I can't say I'm surprised.
---
Cowards, I distract the killer so you can waste time arguing.
---
*laughs in Trapper with extra traps*
---
Give Ace boy some more love, please
---
The silver lining there is that they don't like Nazis at least
---
they finally decided to touch a gen after half hour and i killed both of them
---
*laughs in having eyes*
---
I mean if they work on gen they work on a gen and that's good enough for me lol
---
You can pinpoint the exact moment his world feel apart.
---
I can certainly try to make a version available to use. I've never changed my icons so I'm unsure how to make it ingame friendly
---
I'm on PS4 and this is almost the only video game I play so I play both sides a lot, and not, that is not common at all (multiple times per session? Give me a break. You could have come up with something more believable like once per session.)
---
Bubba barely even gets played on PS4.
---
Because legion is still broken asf and we need a huge nerf to his op power
---
Look at this killer noob using add ons smh
---
found the survivor main
---
Not useless. GFs, Wraiths, and Pigs still drop cloak for gen kicks and so the only stealth killer that it doesn't work against is Tier I Michael and if you get Oblivious  for some reason. Which I always get anxious and look about more then anyways.
---
I think the pipping system is largely ok, but some stuff definitely needs ironing out at red ranks. Today I had a pretty tight game as Hag against a double flashlight team, which ended with a 3k at 2 gens with a hatch escape, with 10 hooks total. And then I didn't even pip! I felt really robbed. I try not to slug to prevent hatch unless I know where the last survivor is, because it's pretty boring for everyone involved, but I can see the appeal when pipping is so finicky.
---
stfu just because you think you're all fast with your fast perks and keys and flashlights  doesnt mean you can bully low-ranks! It deters them from the game and therefore slowly you are killing dbd.
---
killer because it's more fun
---
Yeah, it looked like it was basically over for her.
---
*screams in we're going to live forever*
---
Yeah and with the rank reset changes, once you hit red ranks you're virtually always going to be in red ranks unless you just stop playing for awhile.
---
Good job! üëè Hope you won't have to go through this shit again buddy.
---
Also who created it?
---
Well I could do this.... it would mean not hearing a lot of screaming and I wouldn‚Äôt get as many bp, and as my aim is to get all teachables right now I don‚Äôt think I will
---
I believe there are tutorials on youtube. If you do figure out message me on discord!
---
I play as Nurse and it was a hard start honestly. Well I got 3 kills and the last survivor is a toxic Nea and she‚Äôs just at the open gate t-bagging. I was originally going to just let her go but she‚Äôs t-bagging away and HELLO you do know that Nurses teleport right? So I teleport and I downed her in one hit and start carrying her to a hook and she DC. They message me saying I‚Äôm a bitch for that and I just reply LOL. Moral of the story is, don‚Äôt t-bag at the gate, just leave.
---
no
---
https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-love-democracy
---
Standard, common add ons at that. One of them brought a key.
---
I'd be fine with that, sounds like fun. As long as every match doesn't end with half the people leaving because they didn't get the killer
---
I actually am considering my mentality is mostly "play the game how you want to play it unless it has to do with being toxic, cheating or disconnecting" (teabagging is usually the latter so I can't say I support it but I'm also not THAT angry to go on Reddit and write a meaningless complaint about it). I'm pretty annoyed by both sides not giving the other a break.
---
Was the clip amazing?
---
EA access is like a subscription so you get some free games made by EA or discounts on EA games.
---
That‚Äôs how you beat a 3 gen on pretty much every map except the game. Doesn‚Äôt mean most survivors are smart enough to realize ir
---
Does Surge count towards kicking gens for the challenge?
---
Ah yes, the ghostface who will 99% everybody before revealing themselves
---
I guess I exaggerated, but still, getting destroyed nets you a safety pip. Now imagine you have a game where you still got destroyed, but the other survivors happened to get wrecked before you. You'll pip, not because you can hold your own against purple/red rank killers, but because it's so hard to depip, and some games you're gonna do well on emblems just because all of your buddies got picked off first
---
you want to go back to gens. you probably know this already but as long as people get saved they have 3 hooks. you'll pip best by finding other people and hooking them. unless there's already someone by the hooked survivor, I'd suggest moving on
---
Yeah, kinda. Happens more often than it should.
---
Nemesis has two parts where it changes the obsession when you get stunned and do stuff with obs(Oblivious and aura). So any time your obs changes, these effects will trigger on new obsession. If it wasn't, when the obsession stuns you, obs would still get Oblivious and aura but it doesn't work this way. Only on new obs.
---
I think the killer side needs to loosen up when piping because it‚Äôs really hard after purple to rank up or so I‚Äôve experience
---
My job consists of holding m1 on generators or destroying rank 20 survivors (I wish I was rank 10 at least, fuck rank reset)
---
My art, especially my dead by daylight work, is stolen a lot. I've had to slap on ugly shit to prevent that.
---
Basically an infinite was a loop a survivor could run the Killer around forever.
---
To be real, there's like one infinite left in the game now if they're REALLY lucky with window and pallet spawns but other than that, they're more "Bloodlust III is REQUIRED to land a hit in this loop" loops.
---
Satisfying to say the least.
---
This is literally why I stopped
---
it should cause all survivors to start the game hooked in the basement too
---
I was doing gens, you?
---
In my experience hitting greats isn't too bad if your framerate stays good but the framerate on skillchecks is bad half the time for me.
---
Surge has too low values to warrant the slot. You‚Äôre better off kicking the gen and using Thrilling Tremors instead. It can combo with Surveilance but that‚Äôs two perks for a niche effect. 
---
Mind breaker is useless unless you‚Äôre a stealth killer and even then you can‚Äôt really tell when it‚Äôs helping you unless you‚Äôve already confirmed they have an exhaustion perk and the time of exhaustion is pathetic too. 
---
Cruel Limits like all ‚Äúplease do the gen so I can use my perk‚Äù perks is bad.
---
Demo's perks are ass.
---
Surge has *some* use. Stealth killers can benefit, especially surge+surveillance. Also useful on small maps like The Game. Also v. useful for a 3 gen strat. The problem is it relies so much on getting downs. And it doesn't work with grabs. And it's only 8%. 
---
It's very underwhelming. You can make it work, but it takes effort. For killers that don't have time to kick gens, it has its uses.
---
I mean the most effective would just be double Nurse, no real arguing that. if you just have two of the strongest Killer it wouldn't be much of a match. 
---
most fun? maybe Myers with a Ghost Face? just imagine all the chaos with double stalky bois it'd be fantastic. maybe Hag and Spirit? Hag throws traps down in loops and Survivors triggering the traps gives Spirit instant knowledge of the Survivors location?
---
every game i play with her i try to put traps around all the gens.
---
and every game i realize that its fucking stupid and i should just focus on 4 or 5 gens that are near each other.  when i do that i usually get a 3 or 4k.   I will sya she's one of my better killers.  i run ruin, devour, bbq and thrill of the hunt.  
---
they touch my totems? i'm on their ass before they can figure it out.  hook and boucne.  wait for them to unhook so i get my devour stack.  
---
my devour only really gets cleansed cause people are trying to get ruin.  if they get ruin first, they dont even bother cleansing the other one.   
---
until its a 3 tokens and the whole game comes to a screetching halt when i down someone in 1 shot.  the whole team stops whatever they're doing and now they start looking for the devour totem.
---
Timer doesn‚Äôt matter these cosmetics will be released to the store eventually this is just early access
---
Oh ok, didn‚Äôt know that
---
Tapping is basically the same as hitting 3 goods.
---
Well survivors are in luck when I run totem. 9 times out of 10 it's all the way across the map from me and out in the open! It's so nice to be helpful.
---
Tapping gang
---
If she's short, her co-worker next to her must be short too...
---
I agree with that last bit tho.
---
Literally just repeatedly tap the gen instead of holding M1
---
I‚Äôll do it until I miss like 3 hex skill checks then I‚Äôll run to another and start over. If another survivor hops on with me I usually leave. Don‚Äôt trust their skill
---
Cool man. You keep giving people hatch and I ll keep slugging them for my 4k. End of the conversation.
---
Dumbest meme I've seen here.
---
2 of any killer working together chasing 1 survivor. Goodbye looping.
---
Behavior statistics are not accurate at all. They did not provide rank, match time, gens finished, amount of hooks, emblem progression, survivor and killer builds, etc...
---
All they provided was a general percentage of what killers tend to kill survivors. This isn't valid data collection because there are no parameters. It has no elaboration past what killer and of they killed.
---
Also if you want to claim it might be because I'm not that good, I'll gladly run my nurse against you. I can assure you that I'm not having issues in the 1v1 aspect of the game. Where the game has issues is how survivors have no real challenge when not in chase. All objectives are brain dead easy, which means the killer just has to hope survivors waste time. Which does happen a lot, but when you run into players that don't waste time, it becomes apparent that there is nothing killers can do.
---
People say "oh well not all games are 4 man death squads". Yeah, not every single game has those players, but a majority of my games will have 2-3 solid players with 1-2 mediocre players. Regardless of who I chase, you dont have to be good at the game to do generators. Even if you throw ruin into the mix, ruin spawns next to gens 80% of the time, so it only lasts 30 seconds to 1 minute.
---
Hmm... you can have ‚ÄúHail to the king, baby‚Äù
---
Nice! Trapper is not the most powerful killer,  but honestly he is the most fun for me!  I like having to plan out where to put all my traps lol. Feels good when the traps actually catch someone.
---
UPVOTES TO THE LEFT
---
Maybe you just got down voted as the Killer too much? In my region its like instant.
---
See I fucked up, ran directly at him. Thought maybe my thick ass head would stop him.
---
You know that you CANNOT get merciless in red ranks without 4 k right?
---
If you count piping as a win than ok, I played well so I wanna double pip.
---
But hey I need to slug for the 4k and why? Hatch :)
---
Trapper is literally the coverboy of the game and the first killers so of course he‚Äôs going to have more skins
---
Agreed, I‚Äôm done the rift and I don‚Äôt feel like waiting for the next one before I turn in all my saved challenges I have completed. Don‚Äôt want my rift shards to go to waste.
---
Damn, you've made me realize a major flaw in my funtimes casualmode.... I guess there would also have to be twice as many palettes, just to keep things balanced. Though it would be funny to see two killers ganging up on one poor Dwight sprinting like a mad lad in the distance.
---
Yeah iirc its bugged too.
---
I remember my first time playing Pig. Someone tried to boop, but obviously I was new to her and literally hooked him and got confused as hell. Only later did I realize he was trying to just boop.
---
Ah yeah, ds, adrenaline, BT, dead hard and iron will aren‚Äôt obnoxious perks at all.
---
Exactly!
---
It be like that sometimes and other times you spawn right on ruin
---
Well, it is pretty apparent that the Killer's work is not to "kill". The Killer's work is to torture, break generators, chase and then kill.
---
The same way as Survivor's job is not to "survive". Survivor must repair gens, help other Survivors and run from the Killer. 
---
If Killers did only killing and Survivors only surviving, the game wouldn't be fun.
---
Yikes definitely not a great start then lool, but yeah honestly same I'm taking a break from it currently.
---
Double nurse does sound pretty good, just keep in mind that on a map that's twice as big, with eight survivors scampering around, you'd have to make sure you play *really* optimally to get effective results due to Nurse's low mobility when her charges are down. However, Nurse players are *already* really good at playing optimally, and I imagine having a partner to coordinate with and do callouts with would help immensely. 
---
...Basically, SWF but with Killers. Kill With Friends.

I'm supposed to just hand my snoot out like some common /swine?!
---
I have self heal
---
&gt; 1 thing I want to make clear. This isn't about wanting to win eveey game it's about having an impact and having the ability to win every game. Some games you have no control over the win and that's what I am showcasing here. With less unmindgable loops every game could be winnable. This is showcasing a game which was unwinnable no matter what I did. That's what I'm always trying to explain. Not "I want to win 100% of games" but "I want to have the ABILITY to win 100% of games." A forced unpreventable loss isnt fun game play and its what happens when all 4 are good survivors and you are not a viable killer. Hope that allows people to understand my stance more. Cheers!
---
he's totally right, but this same thing is also true for survivors. But the effect is worse for killers
---
Monitor &amp; Abuse, Ruin, make your choice &amp; nurses calling. 
---
Most optimal build you get get on hag. Don‚Äôt chase survivors, place traps everywhere and wait for them to go off. 90% of your hits &amp; downs should come from teleporting and hitting.
---
I'm a potato so that's relatable
---
Wait... Why isn't the entire game in here
---
Lol Trapper with either Billy, the Oni, Spirit or Nurse would be brutal.
---
and Imagine looking for ruin and you end up cleansing haunted ground? Fuck!
---
The latest nurse that tried that in my game dc'd when noed was cleansed before we opened the gate
---
I also hated this challenge.
---
In the end, I finally had to just be a dick and slug as many as possible and then patrol the hell out of the two hooks.
---
I really hope I never have to run NOED again lol.
---
Thanks for Small game.
---
On console his stick disappears when he wacks a gen with it, big sad.
---
They seem to mention it every few months, then they do absolutely nothing about them
---
Hard countered!
---
I still run into solo games where survivors play optimally. (I check every lobby just to know if there are swf)
---
Also even if you argue he didnt have a build and made mistakes, do you really think the game would have changed at all? What if he pressured multiple survivors? All the original survivor would do is hop back on a gen. In most cases, high rank players know to value a gen over a heal. IN MOST CASES.
---
Dont you think it's also an issue when there are strong and weak killers? I know a rework for doctor and addon reworks for billy, bubba, huntress, and doctor are coming. But there are so many killers that have the same problem, no gen pressure and bad chase potential. Now I'm not saying that every killer should be nurse tier. I'm just saying that the game is not in a good state when, if you want to have a chance at even slowing gens down, you have to run a meta build.
---
Oh, you're not running ruin? Say goodbye to gens.
---
Also ruin doesn't actually fucking do anything unless survivors miss the great section. So if you have players that hit greats easily, which even I can do on good days, ruin is a useless perk. I mean just look at players like monto, puppers, or Ulysses, not only are they strong survivors, they rarely miss ruin skill checks. (Unless puppers and monto are drunküòÖ)
---
I use the spell card, Polymerisation to fuse together my 3 Blue eyes white trappers to summon, Blue eyes prestige trapper!
---
My main survivor build includes Small Game and Inner Strength, so as soon as I see Ruin, I make sure it's gone within a minute or so after. Sure, we could power through it, but why bother? Also gives me a free quick heal.
---
Why
---
My snoot isn‚Äôt for any common slut, it‚Äôs reserved for special survivors.
---
The fuck is the NSFW?
---
I want this skin damn it....I‚Äôm almost there.
---
Plague and Nurse would be a slugfest
---
Explains why they haven't buffed him in a year
---
Believe me, it help. One game, I took out four totems while my teammate took out the last one.
---
Turns out the killer had Noed but couldn't even use it.
---
Small game also known as NO NO NOED! :)
---
no... i don't think i will
---
its how the perk works? what are you confused about?
---
On PC I only have this issue late in the evening. During the day my wait is usually like a minute.
---
For non-licensed characters yes you can buy them with shard, but for licensed characters you have to use auric cells
---
Plague/Spirit would be an extremely effective combo.
---
100%, noed isnt op or anything, but it's definitely one of the more clutch perks.
---
BHVR : Let‚Äôs make a game where 4 survivors have to fight for their lives without being able to communicate. 
---
Also BHVR : Why not also being able to invite 3 of your friends so that y‚Äôall can play together ?
---
Hard lol at mettle of man and odd bulb being on your list.
---
It specifically says, only applies when outside of the killer's terror radius
---
And how are you supposed to torture survivors when they can do 60% of their objective in less than 90 seconds
---
Unfortunately, this sub as well as the steam community hub seems to be about 80% killer mains. So literally anything, constructive or not, regarding killer power level will get spam downvoted and filled with replies like "get good" and "don't get hit". This is the best the game state has ever been for killer mains, and when you factor in about 50% of killer hit confirms now come during late vault animation or during a pallet stun, you will very quickly realize just how stacked it is against survivor. But for any killer main to acknowledge this would mean that they have to admit they aren't all "leet gAmErS", which they won't do. They are playing a team based game ALONE, and yet complain when people queue up as a team lol. It's honestly absurd and the amount off ass backward logic I read daily from killer mains explains exactly why they have had to make killers as powerful as they are right now. The game is starting to lean towards 1 person having fun at the expense of 4 others, and that 1 having busted ass perks and add-ons, while survivors are still stuck at boring levels of gameplay. The only way to be an effective survivor is to sink about 200 hours minimum on top of watching content to learn, and google all the god loops on every map. If you are going in with little to no game knowledge you are pretty much fucked. This game is 80% knowledge, 10% mechanics and 10% exploits.
---
I think the main complaint is that if you see an object you have to assume everyone has ds. So everytime someone gets unhooked theres 1 full minute where you just cant pick them up. With old ds you only had to worry about the obsession having it, as if a non obsession had ds they would still have to get the wiggle to 35% or roughly gave you 6 seconds to carry them to a hook. Also you could dribble the obsession if you were close to a hook. Its more of the impact this ds has on the 4v1 aspect of this game, where old ds was stronger in the 1v1 aspect.
---
Same. Small game is a must have. Also helps against Trapper and Hag.
---
bruh i swear there are just some posts in this subreddit that make me stay here 
---
lmfaaaoooooooooooooooo
---
I get what you mean. It just doesn't feel like a battle pass. Maybe if the whole archive idea cost money then it would feel more like one. Currently it feels more like a new core part of the game that makes me take time to grind, instead of an extra that I can choose to do, even though I'm aware that we don't have to do it. When it's there in front of you though it makes it difficult to not want to complete it.
---
thx champ
---
Yeah, the grass is a bit nuts sometimes, and honestly doesn't do a great job of hiding her (or Ghostface) from survivors' view. It's usually just more obstructive than helpful.
---
No it isn't. Self-care is 50% slower than a medkit, which is slower than a teammate healing you.
---
It means you were doing the right thing
---
Yeah the nice little nuggets of solo queueing are those weird clutch plays you get with that team of randos to go save that guy on hook or that they pull to save you.
---
I mean it‚Äôs mostly boosted idiots selfhealing in a corner against thana and sloppy, but there are some good people out there :)
---
If your gen is out in the open, Alert can give you the time to get to a hiding spot without leaving a trail of scratch marks and you can watch him leave and get back on your gen. 
---
Did this on a Haddonfield Freddie. Dodged him three times per gen and he never found me.
---
Maybe they meant you 3 genned them?    
---
IDK, sounds like another made up term like "Proxy Camping," "Soft Patrolling" or "Gen Rushing."
---
You get called a toxic DC'er?
---
I feel like a killer having nen abilities would be a bit op
---
I was lucky and played my first handful of survivor games with a good friend of mine.
---
One of the our allies got hooked, and she had Kindrid, she explained that she has a perk to let us see the killer aura, and we can see that the Killer is standing in front of the hook and not moving. "This Killer is being an asshole, do NOT play like this. Its not fun for the survivors, and it will cost the killer the game."
---
He was always a joke in the little intro cut scenes but he was also the best fighter in the game.  Go fucking figure.  
---
\#BATTLECHAD META
---
i mean once you hit red ranks, ranking up isn't really a top priority imo. you've already made it. and i played a game where i did almost every gen and escaped without a hook and never got found by the killer and got 2 iri, 1 gold, 1 silver. you get a lot of points for being in the killers terror radius and him not finding you
---
Im on Pc...
---
They aren't pro strats lmao
---
holy shit this is stupid reading through it, sorry i'm a fucking idiot lol.
---
If you remove the first E it gets a whole new meaning
---
I mean, if the killer cared about authenticity then absolutely.
---
Bud the reason they are in low ranks is because they face camp... You get that right?
---
Omg YES this is every game when I‚Äôm doing solo queue, but I mostly do SWF and most of us can hit great skill checks, so we fight through it. It‚Äôs always the best thing when it‚Äôs a trapper that REALLY wants his Ruin, so we just have one of us fuck with the traps while we do gens, and it works every time
---
nice repost
---
I hate it so much when survivors do that. I remember when the last two survivors thought it would be funny to run laps around the yamaoka estate at the end of the game, or the time when I 3 gemmed the last two with pop and they just hid for the rest of the game until I finally found one and killed them.
---
XD
---
Well I wasn‚Äôt gonna say thx captain obvious that sounded a lil douchy
---
Lol I only play solo survivor and I find matches almost instantly. But I mainly play on killer
---
Oh yeah
---
why not the hunter guy
---
Oh, is there a small arrow button to open or close the chat. Maybe yours is closed. It looks like two arrows close together
---
Ohhh sorry blood lodge you‚Äòre right
---
Battle chads unite, but for real tho, I was so hooked on F13, I didn't actually have a reddit account until F13 was a thing.
---
DAMN! HE PUNCHES AIR HARD
---
It means the survs have left 3 gens on one side of the map which can then easily be patrolled by the killer.
---
survivors would rather be able to move onto the next game where they either have a better team or a killer closer to their skill level than spend most of the game getting slugged especially in anything below purple ranks where their queues are basically instant
---
2 things come to mind, there might be more answers, but this is what I think could work.
---
1. Better matchmaking. 
---
Actually have a good matchmaking system. The current one obviously doesn't work, but even when it did work, people can be boosted or just single pip every match and eventually make it to red ranks. Even though all they did was maybe 1 gen and hide until hatch.
---
So introduce an ELO system that many games have. Overwatch, Rocket League, and other games I cant think of atm but do exist. Now this system won't be a cure all, but it'll help.
---
2. Change how survivors pip.
---
At the current moment, you can pip up just by doing gens and escaping. Sure this is the main objective of the game, but how come survivors can't pip after being chased all game, something that takes some skill, while survivors that sit on easy gens all match can pip up and even double pip?
---
They need to overhaul the way survivors and killers pip so it incentivizes players to do something other than objectives. As someone in the replies said, make it so you need to collect things for the gens. Maybe make it so once you hit every 25% mark of a gen, you have to go collect a random piston that spawns in 1 of 4 places, it'll obviously be highlighted for the survivor but not visable to the killer.
---
Just something that not only slows gens down a bit, but makes objectives interesting. Nobody in DBD enjoys sitting on gens, it's just an objective that gets you out.
---
Just leave bro let me go to the next game. I don‚Äôt want to have to walk to both exits and drove everyone to leave cause they escaped
---
It never was ready for anything.
---
*Are you okay?*
---
Tommy Jarvis is technically F13 property. Not sure if Chad is though.
---
That may be, but he forgot about Meg's special ability: **Instant Blind!** Even **Brutal Strength** can't protect you from that!
---
I‚Äôm at rank 6 and get instant killer games on pc
---
I'd much rather have Tommy Jarvis
---
My favorite quote from that game, by far.
---
Yup. Rank reset, i went from rank 8 to rank 9.
---
I just want them to rework all maps n remove "infinites" so at very least ruin isnt a must have perk so they can finally look at changing perks to be more play style focused. I'm tired of getting games with 3/4 slowdown perks
---
RPing as the Chad who escapes alone with the 4 seaters was one of my best laugh in gaming
---
Field Spell?
---
Scratched Mirror myers plus any other stealth killer
---
To be fair tho, what kind of online game doesn't let you play with your friends
---
Once you climb the ranks it gets ‚Äúbetter‚Äù
---
Imagine complaining about Unbreakable lol
---
If only he had the Wraith card so he could reduce blind effects
---
Maybe those who don‚Äôt base their entire gameplay on the lack of communication.
---
Unfortunately Jarvis is F13 propertyb parts 4-6 whereas Chad daddy is either Gun Media, Illfonic property. There is a chance that Chad is also F13 property I won't pretend like I know for certain, but Chad is more likely then Jarvis.
---
As a Nancy main, I prefer to
---
 *cleanse totem*
---
i got it
---
Ngl after the 'nerf' changes to Legion last patch, I genuinely love them. Games are definitely hit or miss, but as soon as soon as everyone is mending you have everyone screaming to be healed and they are all separated because you chased them.
---
Not to mention your fast as fuck. I am still supprised at how fast they vault things.
---
Oh absolutely or speedo chad that kites Jason through all the bear traps and baseball bats.
---
No Jason
---
I really, really doubt we will.
---
If I‚Äôm solo, unless they were helpful, I‚Äôm fine just leaving for myself, I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd bother saving me if I got downed
---
Maybe idr, it's been years since I've played
---
They really need to fix Ash's eyes in his new sweater cosmetic. One eye is animated, the other is stationary and it really makes him look derped out
---
But all the movies are currently owned by the same people lol
---
Going against good survivors time after time is Fucking aids and I don‚Äôt blame people for putting off killer. You have to sacrifice your first born child and have all the quadratic formulas in your head while playing killer to not get steam rolled. Meanwhile you play survivor and you‚Äôre just chilling eating cereal and still pip even if you die
---
That y is very triggering
---
Hag seems cool but i like a different playstyle.
---
Oh no people still think this. I played a game, killed 2 people and they got 1 gen done. The last two people hid in lockers for 5 actual minutes because I was ‚Äúcamping the gens‚Äù. It‚Äôs stupid, not real, and the only people who think this are the diehard survivor mains who played killer one time. (To be clear, I‚Äôm a survivor main too. Just not an idiot)
---
Some people just want to play with their friends, just because they play swf doesn‚Äôt mean they want the advantage
---
honestly, just standing facing the exit and looking over your shoulder at them repeatedly works. Or face them and hit 1/2 to emote. I always try to give the killer the extra hit at the end.
---
i can't hit greats to save my life. its part of the reason i almost never play survivor.
---
I got this bug a few times. Scared the hell out of me the first time.
---
we already know why thats not happening
---
I agree but it‚Äôs not the case currently.
---
It's not about the director it's about the killer.
---
No, it was a standard build, Brutal, Nurses, Ruin, Enduring
---
dedicated servers btw
---
Worst thing ever is fortnite, not satan
---
The chainsaw is on the wrong hand üòÖ not trying to be a dick just pointing it out
---
I am also a surv main (mostly) and I just hate the bitching. Take the beating and move on. Not once while playing killer did I go out of my way to message a survivor I shit on them or that it was an easy game, so I don‚Äôt think survivors should do it. It‚Äôs just toxic and cancer and I wish more ppl would just ignore it because it‚Äôs honestly either a shitpost comment and you can‚Äôt tell or they are actually so delusional they think I should play killer the way they tell me to, like no I don‚Äôt tell you how to play survivor ever.
---
I usually sit around rank 3 man albeit when I have those games the killer is usually around rank 8
---
EGC is end game collapse which is when all the generators have been completed or the hatch has been closed and the timer begins. Slugging is when a killer downs you and doesn‚Äôt pick you up. 4K is when all 4 survivors get killed, dead by hook or mori‚Äôd. Tunneling is when a killer only goes after one specific survivor even when they have an option to go after someone else. I can‚Äôt think of any others off the top of my head so if there‚Äôs specific ones you‚Äôre asking about, let me know and I‚Äôll tell you :)
---
He only wanted his wglf stack, now leave him alone
---
I tap, not just to avoid the regression for failed great skill checks, but mostly to avoid failed great skill checks alerting the killer of my location.
---
Nah lol I like killing people with fancy cosmetics much better

Why would they lobby dodge when they could just run Franklin's
---
Eh people in there are just bots who don‚Äôt care and play weird. Rank 1 is where it gets decent since you actually need to maintain it
---
Tldr: Its in legal limbo til mid 2020, where it will the ruling will probably be appealed. 
---
I am going to butcher the legalities but know this the best incorrect summary I can offer without doing a quick google search which I suggest you do and take everything I say with a grain of salt: Victor Miller the creater behind F13 has a creators right to renegotiate terms of the license usage ie more money and such. Sean Cunningham who currently owns the license is suing Miller trying to prevent him from exercising his right. This whole thing has been going on since last year I think, which is why F13 license holders can't develop more content (movies, dlc, NECA figures etc.) Cunningham lost the lawsuit earlier this year, but has appealed and thats supposed to wrap up mid 2020.
---
we had a game party for the lakers v timberwolves (the one where lizzo almost brought down the staples) and got a lil tipsy
---
we had:
---
balloons
---
lots of beer bottles
---
a bunch of backpacks for the beer
---
tire chains
---
a very scary paper mache frank vogel mask
---
plastic beer bottles for limbo
---
zipties and duct tape for contortion games
---
and an abandoned warehouse within drunk walking distance (4 miles)
---
and we made do
---
So you're saying no killers should be viable and survivors should have an easy win every time? You honestly just seems like a Tru fanboy taking what he says to the extreme.
---
tenacity + unbreakable
---
*Laughs in Franklin‚Äôs Demise*
---
Killer clearly lagged I play console (Xbox) daily and mostly get hit like this when I‚Äôm 2 feet past the past the thing I vaulted. On his screen it looks a lot different I‚Äôll just say that, oh and dedicated servers couldn‚Äôt hurt @bhvr
---
I find having a large terror radius can keep people off gens.
---
If a survivor wants me to chase them the whole game I‚Äôll gladly throw the game to see if they‚Äôre actually good and it‚Äôs funny when they cry why I tunneled them
---
You're right, but hence the shitpost/meme flair. None of this is to be taken seriously.
---
I play mainly DbD and R6S and yeah I get a few of them. They‚Äôre usually green or purple ranks and I play at around 6pm-3am UK time which is unfortunate because the lobby times end up being super long and I‚Äôm always matched with people on a worse rank than me. I have a group of online friends that main insidious bubba cuz they thinks it‚Äôs a hilarious (they post pictures of angry messages and stuff on a group chat) I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre getting the idea that they‚Äôre super rare. :/
---
Me when a survivor clicks and t bags me at the exit
---
New DS is old DS but works for everyone except only for one of 4.
---
You already failed when you didn't fulfill your job as Entity's henchman to farm despair, so it's only fair for it to punish you when you can't even 4k at your own accord. Killers are puppets.  
---
If you get 4k then I expect you at least played decently. That guarantees at least a safety pipping, unless you played like a scumbag resulting in low emblem points.
---
You must be fuckin tripping bc he moved away from that area and the killer‚Äôs lunge still got him somehow. Stop making excuses for poor game design and glitches
---
Bhvr doesn‚Äôt want to pay Victor Salva
---
Lol I‚Äôve tried to come up with similar concepts of a mode like this but that‚Äôs the conclusion I keep ending at.
---
You dont need any addons actually, so you can run any combination of them. I ran brown and yellow addons for speed increase (since I have too much of them), and one perk Stridor. 95% of games is 4k at rank 1
---
Some people just have bad motor skills, reactions and all around skill sets. Not everyone is a god
---
That's why I always wanted an EGC to trigger without powering the gates on a 20 minute mark. It's clear that survivors are just playing so immersed they can't be found and killer is doing their job of protecting gens correctly
---
Just rewatched it definetly not tripping. Quit being conceited it‚Äôs a game. He was mind gaming at a not safe pallet what do you expect
---
I've watched the video and at once Otz brings up his own evidence Tru starts agreeing with him and stops even talking about his points and starts talking about the emblem system. Tru says in the video that all killers can be viable with the right add-ons and said that without add-ons Wraith's bell is bad.
---
If you pause at 0:22 the killer isn't even close enough to hit me
---
I don‚Äôt really care about my rank. I prefer to have fun playing I‚Äôve been at rank 1 a few times and I haven‚Äôt gotten anything out of it so I don‚Äôt see the point. I prefer running silly builds and messing around with other survs I find at this point. I‚Äôve found after playing the game for a long time that taking it seriously gets pretty boring.
---
We will never get jeepers creepers in dbd. The director was a kiddy fiddler and the devs don‚Äôt want to give him money
---
Am I the only one that thinks stbfl is super overrated. It grants you what 40% buff on SUCCESSFUL attack cooldown, and you lose tokens super easy like what‚Äôs the upside to this perk that I‚Äôm missing
---
Bruh this it‚Äôs soooooooooooo trueeeeeeee this ranks of killers always facecamp, no wonder they‚Äôre still at that rank
---
So then don‚Äôt complain when you go against a facecamper lol. It happens and you enjoy the feeling of knowing 3 other people escaped for free.
---
To everyone stating the obvious...we do have Freddy as a character and no one seems to really mind.
---
I would argue that keeping somebody from playing the game by camping them is pretty damn toxic. There‚Äôs playing it how you want and then there‚Äôs depriving other players of a proper game.
---
Try telling these people that üòí You can still like the movie and hate what he did ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Its a disease in the purple ranks. Fuckin Ruin and NOED every game. On top of toxic af add-ons. I noticed once I get to red ranks all of that try hard bullshit dies down.
---
*Laughs in Ivory Mori*
---
With the ongoing improvements to totem placement I find that Ruin tends to survive a lot longer. Sometimes it stays up for an entire match.
---
I don‚Äôt think there is. I might be wrong but I believe only steam and ppl who buy from the (windows store) get it. 
---
I play on console so don‚Äôt take my word for this I just believe this is how it is.
---
Should give 7-10% luck and increase the rarity of items pulled from chests.
---
That's weird. I've seen it in videos. If only the Steam version has it, that's one of the weirdest things I've seen in a long time ;p
---
Well I've seen one called Tunneling.
---
I think the shard rewards expire after the current rift ends.  Then the next challenges will give shards for that rift.
---
Looks like someone forgot how mirrors work ;)
---
The new Dracula of netflix?
---
BT is only obnoxious if you are a shit head, Dead hard is easy to counter, iron will... really?
---
How about, Ruin, Thana, sloppy, NOED, franks, Pop goes, bamboozle,  Infectious, ect.
---
uhh blindness
---
I‚Äôm not conceited in this game. What would I be conceited about here? I didnt make any plays...?
---
And to clarify: That is a very safe pallet. The way he was running the loop wasnt safe. But that doesnt mean lag and glitches should get you downed. I play Killer enough and survivor enough to know that shouldn‚Äôt hit on dedicated with good ping. But on consoles without proper dedicated servers, they tend to hit bc of shitty ping.
---
it isn't that the connection is bad, I get 30 ping almost every match. It's that dedicated servers completely broke hitboxes.
---
Opium would be counted first, then opal, so overall time would still be 3 seconds. Also, Gorgon? Is that an unreleased killer?
---
She always had 10 traps
---
Better servers more like actual servers
---
Xbox Game Pass and Windows Store are the same thing basically, so I guess only Steam users? Bizarre!
---
Hag has 10 traps
---
You took the picture with your right hand, ash his chainsaw is on his right hand. I have a statue on my desk so It's easy to see üòâ
---
*cries in L√©ry's*
---
Yes this what you said. Yes yes yes. What he did was horrible thing to do but it wasn't even associated with the jeepers creepers set or has nothing to do with the character. :(
---
Hey man you have to see NOS4A2 its not the Best serie in the World but is the Best vampire in a long time
---
I‚Äôm not complaining. I find it funny. I got trapped in the basement for an entire game the other day with two of my teammates because the bubba was guarding the exit. I‚Äôm simply saying that I can understand the feeling of not wanting to keep playing sometimes when you get deprived of a proper match via insidious killer when you waited for 20 minutes in the lobby.
---
oh my god here we go again

# [LETS GET IT RIGHT OKAY](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/ddj6nv/guide_hitbox/)
---
ok survivor
---
Can literally confirm from experience that I took the photo with my left hand, so I'm afraid you've got it mixed up!
---
its always been hard to go against good survivors, so why would people JUST now be leaving? its gotten much better anyways.
---
Also survivor is more chill bc its literally a 4v1, you cant hold that against survivors. Also who cares about pips? if you hate going against good players then why are you trying to pip?
---
I used to have the gamepass version and it's definitely not there. I ended up buying the steam version though since I wanted to have access to the PTB.
---
Edit: oh wait you mean the demogorgon. My bad
---
üÖ±ut how
---
I agree with this dude.The only games that are good on mobile are tower defense,racing and games like piano tiles or clash royale honestly.All of these require minimal touching(piano tiles have 4 spots you need to touch basically).DBD will likely require constant touching,which is not usable at all over long periods honestly.It will be either a shitshow or a super casual game imo.
---
What are some fun killer builds that change your play style significantly? I've been having fun with Scratch-mirror Myers and Mori Myers. Does anyone else have add-ons that totally change the game?
---
What is tapping?
---
Aww yeahhh. At least with chad i can have a speedo
---
I wonder why you didn‚Äôt stay at the car pallet, it is super safe and even bloodlust doesn‚Äôt help out
---
It's that mob pitchfork and torches mentality that people have anymore. The movie was great and the jeepers creepers as a killer in this game would be amazing! And yes the director is a sick fuck just putting that out there
---
they moved to dedicated recently so they do get screwy
---
Well with sprint burst you could work on the most open and exposed generator and get away from killer. No need to limit yourself to certain areas with windows.
---
True
---
The worst thing you would want in your Burger King Myers, is someone's foot fungus
---
so we can go back to calmer games and not be stuck at rank 1 all year long making me want to uninstall
---
Mind your business motherfucker. I'm boosted
---
90% lobby dodge
---
Quick smacks can save you a game
---
Uh you can still see what's going on right around you
---
I've been accused of camping because i put down traps as Hag. So it's really a 50/50 if he did or not.
---
Tapping is the action of repairing a gen, not by holding the button, but by pressing it repeteadly. Used mostly when there's a Ruin Totem present in the match, the gen is done way slower than usual but at least you avoid the ruin.
---
I see you don't know what viable means. No killer should get a 4k every game.
---
there is a litte box post. here is an example, it says click here to chat  
---
[https://i.imgur.com/7LURHfH.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/7LURHfH.jpg)
---
Can you imagine using a mori on anybody like this, the thought makes me laugh. You‚Äôd hear ppl screaming in your ear to go fuck yourself and die it would be funny but SUPER toxic most likely
---
I disagree, we‚Äôre at the point in the games lifespan where people know how to optimize everything really well and if you want to keep up as killer you can‚Äôt make a mistake or it‚Äôll cost you the whole game. People don‚Äôt want to play against potatoes every game so you‚Äôll pip eventually. Then you go against the good survivors. 
---
My point is the payoff for winning against them is so stupid. You can get a 4K and get brutal killer whereas they died and they 2 piped. You see the problem? That‚Äôs the problem with how the game works
---
For survivor: Get a couple safe unhooks/heals, work on a couple gens, maybe a good chase and get out. Try to get hit as little as possible.
---
For Killer, get as many hooks as you can, don't end chases too early, hope they don't do gens fast, try to stop them from healing.
---
I‚Äôm usually insta survivor but 20 mins as a killer and then I get the toxic survivors as I don‚Äôt get much time as a killer xD
---
The number of times I‚Äôve been flames and called a baby killer on my billy lvl6 killer tank 20/19 xD is atrocious.
---
Well I don‚Äôt know what to tell you man we‚Äôre clearly having different experiences with the game. I‚Äôd appreciate less of the idiotic paraphrasing, you can disagree with someone without acting like a complete twat.
---
Donkey should have said "Chests!"

My source is basically everybody who you ask. And the official stats BHVR publish
---
Yeah, the two versions are practically identical apart from the lack of lobby/postgame chat on the Xbox Game Pass version.
---
I want to unsee
---
Nahh
---
and if you actually listened to what Otz said he let people go through the hatch. He only had one game where he got 2 kills and I can say with 100% certainty that Tru has also gotten less than a 4k on one of his streams.
---
Lol yeah same. I had one on somebody and I thought of this
---
Legion/plague clown would make for some decently quick downs
---
Thank you for understanding the point
---
Entity im trying to stealth but I'm dummy thicc and the clap of my clown shoes keeps alerting Claudettes
---
Multiple it's like a subscription
---
Doin‚Äô gens, you?
---
From my experience most Killers start with Ruin. But with enough map pressure skill one doesn't really need it.
---
Do what I run and run the activation bonus and recovery speed. Battle/Assault Spirit.
---
If you're on PC but didn't get the game through Steam, you won't be able to open the after-match chat. 
---
(Although if you have crossplay enabled, which it is by default, those players with a globe icon will be able to chat. You just won't be able to see it.)
---
Thanks for the help. I'll gloss over it.
---
I get hatch in not even 5-10% of games. It's not as big of a deal as everyone makes it out to be imo.
---
Everyone is saying something different so idk if me adding will be any help.  
---
The "gamepedia" says offerings give 9999 increase for the offerings we have now.  They do not say what the max is but if this is the max, combinding will not affect it.   I've also burnt a realm offering and not gone there, so its probably close to 1 to 1, but not precisely.
---
‚ÄúAll other politicians are bad by my favorites are perfect!‚Äù -you actually.  Fucking idiot
---
Seems like a logical thing to do. Is it heavily frowned upon?
---
It‚Äôs pretty long,  but only like a ten minute read.
---
Thats not an excuse to face camping.
---
Hey, i think we‚Äôve played together before! Hello fellow Ash main.
---
SCP: Labs has a voice system like this and honestly? It makes the game really fun and hilarious when people start roleplaying as their role.
---
I just run it to make Demo flap his arms at the speed of sound
---
They'd have to pay Victor Salva a lot of money, and he's a pedophile.
---
The hatch was made by Vigo iirc,and it leads back to the campfire
---
Really lol? Can u remember the match?
---
I mean if you really want to play legion, you'll very quickly understand why he's so bad. he can be viable under certain circumstances. his best perks are Sloppy Butcher with Thanataphobia
---
That sounds like a lot of work for a quick hit. Bit of a waste of a perk slot imo but we all have our own play-styles this just doesn‚Äôt really suit mine so it‚Äôs a pretty biased opinion but I still don‚Äôt see the hype, and it only counts for successful attack cool-down not missed so you can‚Äôt miss and hit them instantly again I‚Äôve ran the perk w what I thought would be good with it and it‚Äôs just eh. I get what you‚Äôre saying but it doesn‚Äôt really give you that much of an advantage in my eyes and I like to use perks that are already in use or that I don‚Äôt have to work so hard for and get so little out of. Ty for explaining though
---
Hot take: Oni is just Bubba with mobility and tracking
---
I can‚Äôt remember the exact match but I remember saying to my friend, ‚ÄúHey this guy has an awesome username!‚Äù
---
What do those perks do, why are they good on him?
---
Inaccurate, you're not shitting in the tall grass.
---
Lol, nice to know I'm not the only true intellectual
---
legion might be low tier but that doesnt mean he isnt worth playing fun is always most important not how strong a killer is. I personally enjoy trapper a lot and plague a bit but they aren't strong on their own
---
I didn't realize there was so much outside of the game to this game
---
Good survivors push through ruin, its as simple as that. Learn to do it without tapping.
---
It moreso depends on what killer you play as well. Its gotten a ton of hype because its one off otzs favorite perks so now more people are talking about it
---
use DS, learn to loop, and use pallets effectively. if you have a second man with you, ask them to run BT. sorry to say but he's right, you can play the game like that no matter how much you're ruining it for the person. doesn't mean you should play it like that, but you can. it's why DS and BT exist.
---
It was like that. Now I'm stuck at rank 5 for a month till next reset.
---
The only way this would happen is if Salva gave up to rights to someone else
---
Could we get a fix to the que times they take so longggggggggggggg please i will love you guys if you fixed the que times
---
Shit, I've been had
---
Say you get unhooked and there‚Äôs two other survivors around you that are easier to attack and the killer targets the injured person and completely ignores everyone else... now imagine that but the entire game going after one specific person, welcome to tunneling
---
Its pretty easy to get hatch if you play selfish and focus your entire playstyle around it.
---
I want this skin !
---
I think you‚Äôre thinking of the much more useful pwyf. 5/10/15 increase in speed depending on stack. 
---
Would also like to see demo going so fast he creates a sonic boom, will try sometime.
---
But that's the problem. In order to pip you have to deliberately put yourself in danger. Like the game I mention where we smashed through the generators, and the killer got 2 hits the entire game. 
---
Am I really supposed to go back into the trial and deliberately get chased, downed, hooked and have my teammates do the same, just to pip? Or black pip? Because we objectively played well against the killer? The survivors objective is to survive.
---
I know what you HAVE to do to pip. I'm very well aware of that. Im saying that it's stupid that I depipped for efficiently completing gens and denying the killer of hits, downs and hooks. 
---
The same way that its stupid that killers can depip for 4K's.
---
I was never excusing facecamping? Lol
---
One slows repair speed and the other slows healing speed
---
Is it like huntress with the lullaby radius being the sound of cheeks clapping?
---
People hate to see it thank you
---
This is dark for a killer game.
---
Legion's power requires he m1 survivors while no longer gaining benefits from m1 perks and he will never down a survivor without using Frank's Mixtape. Legion also has to eat a 4 second stun if he wants to exit his power to be able to down injured survivors. Legion's main issue is he's one of the least lethal killers in the game.
---
Now Legion's power does grant him tracking ability that ignores lockers and provides some stalling since Survivors effectively won't be able to work on generators without mending first. Which can be useful if you learn to use the information provided by killer instinct properly.
---
I‚Äôve been maining her and having a really good time. I usually pick a part of the map and lay my traps out In not so obvious places. It‚Äôs all about mind games with the hag. You want the survivors to feel safe, because that‚Äôs when they‚Äôll mess up and start triggering traps. Knowing when to give up on a chase is also key. Hag isn‚Äôt fast enough, and if you‚Äôre chasing someone, chances are someone on the other side of the map is triggering traps you can‚Äôt teleport to in time. Another thing that‚Äôs already been mentioned is to always have your traps set. You‚Äôre in bad shape if you have a bunch of traps that need to be (re) set at any given time.
---
Not if they weren't valid to the person they messaged.
---
which is a shit perk. what's your point
---
Forgot that plot line, my bad
---
I know that youre joking but I respectfully ask that you dont! Its hard for me to share my art as it is and I get paranoia about theft as its happened many times already.
---
I ain't leaving that que. I waited 30 min for this!!!!
---
Get over it and learn to play the game better, dude. Don't know why y'all gotta post about being salty when there's counter-play.
---
I wouldn't know. I never got 4 DCs in a single game, and I have close to 800 hours.
---
I'd think it would be fair to just cancel that game. Did they DC at the start of the match?
---
Personally, I don't bother healing against a Legion. If they approach me in FF, there's almost nothing they can do. In fact, I've probably wasted their time when they come over and see that I'm injured.
---
If they decide to come out of the FF, I have a 4 second head start on them to get to a safer area. Then they're just a regular killer. The only thing they kind of have going for them is they are short, and survivor shaped, so it may be difficult to see them when looping tall obstacles.
---
If the survivor isn't as comfortable with looping, I can see healing against Legion. You generally want to do what's best for your survival. At red ranks, if you see a Legion at all, there are a good number of players that won't bother though.
---
If 3 gens popping counts as nothing bad then yeah
---
And yet it has a ranking system, so people are going to be competitive.

I had a game against a Plague at the Underground Complex and she tunneled a Meg for most of the match, when she did go down we all body blocked to get her off her shoulder and then we did all the gens within 5 minutes of that while she looked for the Meg again. At the end I 99% an exit and then a Bill went down to NOED, the Meg runs up to my exit, opens it and then leaves without even trying to help. The Bill got camped and died and I eventually got the same treatment since I was the only one who tried to save the Bill so yeah, be a good teammate. If she really didn‚Äôt want to help anyone else the least she could‚Äôve done is not open the exit until we found the NOED
---
Super smash bros was also intended to be a party game.
---
I can imagine playing as micheal just whispering in close proximity while I grab them off the gen.
---
I mean (hooks one survivor) (entire team immediately saves him and heals while looking for ruin)
---
I didn't see what it was. How bad is it?
---
you don't need a "gaming" laptop to play games on a laptop. there are plenty of cheaper ones that work just fine and are the same price as a decent phone
---
According to the devs, the lore will be available as long as the game is running.
---
Doctor and Legion.
---
While in Tier 3 of Madness you can't mend until you snap out. Have Doctor Tier 3 a survivor running add-ons to increase snap out time and then have legion FF them running Stab Wounds Study and I'm certain the survivor will go down before they can finish snapping out.
---
I feel we need Count Chocula over Dracula with how much dbd nerfs killers. At least then no one will ever need to fear a nerf since hell be trying to help survivors escape so he can have his chocolate that‚Äôs on the other side of the doors.
---
It's the only picture of clown we need.
---
Pretty cheap that you leverage sound in the game that way.

This show was trash tbh, don‚Äôt want this cosmetic.
---
my experience as killer is that 80% of the time my ruin totem is cleansed in the first 30 seconds..
---
Dude. You can‚Äôt get the killer without giving him money. We‚Äôre telling you why the killer isn‚Äôt coming to the game. There is no way to get the killer without feeding money to a convicted pedophile, so we won‚Äôt get the killer. Full stop. That‚Äôs it. It‚Äôs genuinely that simple.
---
It made it so that oni cannot change directions when attacking during charge until the last few frames
---
Oh I did not know that lol I don‚Äôt play the demo enough, it sounds like you play him and my boyos at level 1 is he worth leveling up to play just in terms of fun? I bought him and haven‚Äôt touched him cause I‚Äôm afraid his add-ons and gameplay will be a letdown; that‚Äôs why I assume I‚Äôve seen like 30 demos since the stranger things dlc.

They're coming "soon" though!
---
So clutch it was cluntch.
---
I know. But I feel they also lobotomized him since he can‚Äôt seem to grab hatches out of a locker. He won‚Äôt even deck legion and take that damn stabby knife. I feel BHVR gave us Hsa Ash‚Äôs evil twin brother that‚Äôs completely worthless and he‚Äôs just here to ruin the chosen one‚Äôs image.
---
And then there are the people who don't do anything but teabag the only person who is doing gens because they refuse to gentap and -god forbid- miss one single skillcheck out of ten.

As a console player I‚Äôm glad they got rid of the flick. He feels identical on console it was just a bug nerf for him on pc. Rip

I mean one could say using the word Satan in that context brings in some sort of religion, so I informed him on what‚Äôs worse lol.
---
Hey JoeyBobBillie? What evidence?
---
It's completely random. Say you are wounded and I death hook 3rd guy. You could be waiting on the hatch or the hatch might just spawn in front of you. It's very problematic.
---
I do it whenever 1-2 people DC. I find someone, down them, then carry them to a gen or totem. Generally they‚Äôll understand I‚Äôm friendly and from there I just escort them for the rest of the match
---
Looks like he‚Äôs trying to do his daily.  I would of ran back and stepped in that trap.  50/50 he would of let me go. 100% I would of been ok with either outcome.

She has 12 if I remember correctly.
---
Loved that show
---
It‚Äôs been awhile, she‚Äôs due another nerf.
---
Oh, to be clear, I fully understand *why*.  Doesn't make me any less bitter about it :P
---
The idea is to keep people playing. So that every month you strive for rank 1 again. Its the same reason they keep the grind.
---
Yeah, I've tried adapting a better way to do things.. If I hook them, I leave the area. If they get off while I'm near? I chase the other person. If the rest of the crew dies or DC's.. Last survivor gets the hatch.
---
And it was a good joke haha, I was just saying.
---
Except when they literally spawn on my totem
---
They‚Äôre all bad and it‚Äôs a paid dlc for only a survivor
---
It's a meme that she's always been nerfed and not buffed :)
---
Lately I‚Äôve been getting killer games very quickly but survivors games are taking forever, it‚Äôs actually why I‚Äôm playing killer so I can actually play.
---
Wtf
---
They must be new here.
---
*again, giggles in small game*
---
I have the exact opposite as solo queue red ranks I get rank 20 teammates and rank 1 killers
---
I was hoping someone would say this! Take my upvote.
---
Yup. Same here. But thought this may help
---
It‚Äôs satisfying, shame it just takers forever.
---
Can confirm this happened to my buddy while we were in a SWF vs the Oni. He appeared to be hooked but in the bottom left it showed he was downed. After the action he was spectating the Oni and could no longer see his character. Oni tried to pick him up again several times but it just kept putting him back on the ground and floating in the air. Oni tried to fix it with endgame collapse but the timer ran out and he didn't die. Played the waiting game and the killer finally dc'd.
---
The folks over at Assassin's Creed said we stole the arm blade, so it's been replaced with a hand motion that lightly caresses survivors' cheeks.
---
yes
---
when i saw this video i commented "legion mains are getting out of hand" lol
---
Ironic
---
Ruin is basically just needed for killers that aren‚Äôt good.  If you aren‚Äôt Billy or Nurse, you get screwed if you don‚Äôt have ruin.  Like straight up you just have no way to stop certain gens from being done because every chase will be stretched out to 2 minutes if you don‚Äôt have an ability to counter it, and 3 whole gens will be done by the first chase.  If you choose not to chase, well, they don‚Äôt lose any pallets, and just do it eventually when you get there.
---
No-Blink Nurse is unexpected *and* viable **when you use the walking speed boost add-ons**.
---
Ghost Face has a variant where he just uses his Stealth and never actually Stalks, although some would argue that that's how he's actually meant to be played.
---
Take my upvote and fuck outta here.
---
Really makes me think of the Metro games, super soothing to listen to
---
I‚Äôm looking now at your profile and 3 days ago you said stealth Killers were the most fun to play against. So what changed?
---
It sort of seems like you‚Äôre just trying to upset people intentionally, I hope that‚Äôs not the case though
---
Corrupt Intervention is already good enough. Not on every killer, but Michael Myers for example it‚Äôs great on.

It‚Äôs not that I can‚Äôt get good with the new ¬´¬†*improved*¬†¬ª freddy, It‚Äôs just that hes boring af to play compared to the old one, and just annoying overall. I don‚Äôt want to debate for 3 years about wether he was better before or after the rework, all I meant was that the rework for Freddy didn‚Äôt only bring joy, It brought deception to some old freddy mains.
---
dont worry guys, we got rid of exclusives! /s
---
This is the most important thing. A killers skill is heavily dependent on how much common sense and environmental awareness you have so if you don‚Äôt have any of that you won‚Äôt be a good killer. But if you‚Äôre a great natural killer in dbd I feel like you can almost 4K on every killer you play it doesn‚Äôt matter how much someone says their ability is trash or not or what there opinion is, it‚Äôs what YOU can do that makes him viable, not other people opinions that‚Äôs for sure.

I don't think I've ever gotten comments on my profile. Then again I win while not being an asshole, so that probably has something to do with it.
---
Other than blatantly hard tunneling, facecamping outside of gens being done, and unwarranted BM, what is this "killer code" you speak of?
---
While you‚Äôre correct in that the you lose out on the most points due to the chaser emblem, that makes sense, since you didn‚Äôt have to chase. The issue is that if you got a 4k by totally steam rolling and not having to chase the other emblems should make up for that. The chase emblem should in this instance be what would push you to pip or closer to double piping. The other 3 should give you enough points to get the safety for the steamroll alone. The chaser emblem shouldn‚Äôt need to be accounted for in the case and also wouldn‚Äôt be a drag since you‚Äôre not chasing. The setup for getting only golds or silvers is stupid in the other 3 categories. That‚Äôs my point.

I sound like a four year old but I think I'm old enough to play

If 30 seconds have gone by with no injuries or terror radius, it's a stealth killer.  If it's over a minute though, then it's probably a Hag or highly defensive Trapper.  Or it's a meme strat.

Good players typically aren't afraid of the terror radius &amp; won't leave a gen for it.

Ive got 3 level 50 survivors, level 75 rank 17...  Last time I posted that Michael Meyers can 1 hit down people on here some ass clown told me I was wrong. Its all Michael Meyers does. I have no respect for anyone who has to pick Michael Meyers in order to be a successful killer.
---
I‚Äôve actually played the mobile version , it‚Äôs actually pretty good - they have made some adjustments ; a visual heartbeat as well as the sound to make it easier , and arrows to help you triangulate a generator partially completed. 
---
I‚Äôve also played 2k hours on pc so I know what I‚Äôm talking about. Mind you 360 are way easier so minor adjustments needed.

Can relate :(

There is a path to righteousness.
---
You must play four survivor games, one for each soul you destroyed.
---
You must take only one perk, No Mither, for they were all dead when they were first hit, and so shall you be.
---
You must run to save everyone who is hooked, and body block whenever the opportunity presents itself, no matter the likelihood you will die. You must show that you have as much hope and ignorance as those you killed.
---
Then, and only then, will your soul be balanced.
---
Good luck on your loathsome quest
---
If you want to argue for not de-piping then sure I can see that. But your initial argument was for getting a pip for escaping.
---
Though, I'd still argue that survivors should be required to at least help complete half a generator or get chased for x-amount of time to safety pip. I say this as having played like 200 hours on killer and like 30+ on survivor and know for a fact that survivors have it way easier than killers. The only time this isn't the case is when a high rank survivor queues with much lower rank friends and they go against a high rank survivor. Pretending otherwise is being biased because you have 4 individual people each potentially as skilled or more skilled than the killer which makes the game favor survivors significantly. Not to mention when you have even a SMALL amount of coordination on the survivors end and they take the game even a little seriously.
---
*Cough* Last summer *Cough*
---
Never iron will
---
It usually takes a minute. Sometimes when it is bad 5. But whenever i queue as a killer i watch 1 episode of american horror story.
---
You‚Äôre generalizing, and have you ever stopped to think that they want to get points for playing???
---
Fuck no one should be Fuck the devs because I see more that then fuck no one.
---
Yeah but even if you aren‚Äôt hitting the great skill checks Im sure your teammates appreciate the coop points.
---
Thats your choice? Most people are gonna play the game how its meant to be played and not care? The objective is to kill survivors and rank up or to survive and rank up lmao
---
Myers with chainsaw anyone?
---
Even the people complaining about bad perks forget about Tapp.
---
You sound like a child.
---
So basically you watched that one video of him arguing that wraith is powerful and ignored all of his streams where he doesn't get 4ks as Wraith and where he says specifically that he doesn't think that he needs a nerf. 
---
You're talking about us ignoring evidence while you only use one video that fails to support your point and ignore any other sources of input.
---
r/oinkers_
---
It's on console, you can see the wiggle bar near the end of the video show the analog stick.
---
For the love of the Entity I‚Äôm not out to get you! I just want to understand what the heck you‚Äôre talking about! Do you have any evidence? I went to your profile to see if you‚Äôre trolling but you seem relatively competent, frequenting both this sub and others, so just do everyone a favor and tell us the evidence you‚Äôve already listed. Please
---
What the hell is that matchmaking!?
---
Oh yeah. Even worse when you have a rift challenge you completed and you dont get it, or you brought in your best medkit/toolbox.
---
Well you do keep whatever items you find in the game and any that you brought in you don't lose any items you might lose out on points but that's really only your time so you're only wasting your time
---
You just posted cringe. You're gonna lose a subscriber.
---
Show me a game where he doesn't get a 4k with the optimal build then.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought but I know I don‚Äôt have tonnes of experience so was open to being incorrect.
---
What's the original source of this?
---
I should also mention that the Pig has the same opportunity to get close to the survivors but unlike the Wraith she doesn't need to make a ton of noise to come out of stealth. She can just simply stand up. Why is Wraith OP but Pig isn't?
---
It's an OP ass item. Shit like that is why I run Ebonies. Both are ez wins.
---
Also, *repost*
---
Try blood echo, it works great on legion since he injures everyone so easily, if they choose to stay injured, no more dead hard.
---
Yup, I'm harvesting shitty medkits so I don't waste any of my good stuff.
---
Oh hi Pyke. Please don't have a ton of cc, stealth, and an easy kill that duplicates bloodpoints.
---
I understand what they did, I just dont know why they simply didn't make something like a limit to being 5 gens max, can you calm down now? Why are so getting so worked up over a damn question
---
Pretty sure this is a repost PURELY because of MoM being there.
---
Deliverance gang rise up.
---
"Survivor main" and "killer code" and you understand where the entitlement comes from.
---
Also it's called the "Survivors Rulebook for Killers".
---
I'd remove bond and bring a different aura perk, as with empathy you can tell who's being chased and where they're headed if they get hit, and if they manage to escape the killer you can go and get healed/heal them + tier 3 lets you see them across the map.
---
Its not OP, Thats why u have too do a certain amount of gens before the hatch reappears, its amazing how dumb these killer mainz are
---
Kindred maybe.
---
Damn man the pig is already down for the count. You dont have to bring a chair.
---
I will weep the day you leave the nest and enter the wider world if you stop reading things the moment you encounter something you don‚Äôt like or have little understanding of

---
Well the argument I see is that at least on pc he is just a worse hillbilly now. No reason to pick him up over Billy.
---
I‚Äôve been told i was left for my build multiple times with no explanations outside of that. I run a blendette type thing but i‚Äôm not useless by any means. I just use it sneak and run from the killer when needed and unhook pretty regularly, otherwise i‚Äôm doing gens.
---
I wasn't camping. And i had zero other even decent perks to use. If i had anything else id have used it over noed. Still isnt a reason to be salty. Its just a game man.

Unzips
---
i wasnt mad i was trying to make my point
---
And what's the "optimal build"? You mean him running his red add-on and green add-on? Because he argued in the video that you sent he doesn't need his optimal build to consistently get a 4k.
---
wait u brought a splinter but have a skin?
---
What is "Liberated"? Is it a video game?
---
What do you mean what the fuck? They didn't say anything messed up.
---
IT DIDNT LET ME PLAY AS FREDDY
---
exactly. the bloodweb seems to prioritize tier 3 noed over every other perk. i t3 my noed before even getting 3 useful perks at tier one
---
You assumed me killers are supposed to play by non-existent rules you‚Äôve made up, and claim I‚Äôm sheltered? Get bent.
---
D BOIS
---
Nope, fully missing the point.
---
They have P2P so no not real servers
---
The best advice I can give is play a lot of survivor (possibly with Kindred) and see what you and your teammates do. If you know what you would do when the killer hooked someone, chances are someone else in the match is doing something similar.
---
Though it's best not to pateol a hook unless you know for certain someone is there, the game isn't about the kills/escapes it's a checklist of things you have to do in order to win. Staying within 16m of a hooked survivor grants massive negatives to that checklist both because you will loose out on other opportunities, and because of the straight-up negative points it gives.
---
lol aint that a funny
---
what OP items tho? maybe that 1 toolbox left after this nerf year, but that is still so fucking far from the OP killer addons it's a crime.
---
NO. LOOK AT THE OFFERING
---
My initial "arguement" was simply mirroring the comment above me saying that "a 4k should be a pip for a killer, change my mind." My comment was the exact same only with "survivor" &amp; "escape" instead. Since those are the 2 relevant objectives.
---
On that initial comment I made an edit *before* anyone replied to my comment. 
---
*EDIT: I agree about the 4K though. (Or at LEAST a black pip. You should never depip for a 4K or escape)*
---
While we're talking about pipping, I agree that at a high level, killer have to manage much more during an average game than survs do. But to the contrary of that in regards to pipping, a survivor can be out of the game within 3 minutes if they get one hooked or mori'd. So survivors can be eliminated from games, not allowing them to be able to gain more points. Whereas killers cannot. Killers ALWAYS have then entire match to earn points. 
---
I dont think the game is survivor biased tbh. (I legitimately think it's fairly balanced atm) As in my experience. And in others who have tracked their win/loss ratio as killers. Killer either 3 or 4K a vast majority of games. 
---
Whereas a 4 man escape is far rarer. And if you see a 4K and a 4 man escape as opposites. Then the 4k happens significantly more often that a 4 man escape. Whereas in a perfectly balanced game (which I understand for all skill levels is essentially impossible) you would see a ratio closer to 50/50.
---
But i guarantee that because you've played the game for 200+ hours as killer and 30+ as survivor.  You got way more 4Ks as killer than 4 man escapes. And as a surv I guarantee you've been killed or had a 1-2 man escape more often than a 4 man escape.
---
GUYS IM SO MAD. I JUST DID THE SAME ON TRAPPER AND IT DIDNT WORK AGAIN. I WANT A REFUND-
---
That's what I thought. Apparently most console players don't keep up on the game enough to know about if there are servers or not.
---
I mean you just have to look up in depth survivor guides to find info on it.
---
Foggy woods in the dawn it is then
---
Lithe is such crutch perk. Like, you need a perk to go faster to get distance from the killer? Why don't you learn how to 360 and loop them? 
---
And don't get me started on DS. Just another crutch because you know you're gonna get hooked. Just play better. 
---
This is how you sound.
---
He brought a splinter to play as Freddy but it didn‚Äôt work!

A lagswitcher wouldn't decide to DC like that. This is one of the most bizarre desyncs I've ever seen

Ah, ok. Bummer.

[http://prntscr.com/qbr9g4](http://prntscr.com/qbr9g4)

I think we aren't playing the same game then. I also never saw someone throwing the game after a DC, although they do start intentionally playing poorly sometimes.  
---
My suggestion is to climb up. I got the same thing about Legion one time (2 or 3 DCs), but I was on yellow after rank reset.
---
noed is a very strong perk that doesnt help you win basically at all. so it's both broken and trash
---
bro it‚Äôs a meme chill
---
&gt;And every single update it runs even worse with more bugs
---
I never play DBD without RTSS to monitor my hardware usage and I can comfortably say you are wrong.
---
Is your affirmation of "running worse" purely from an empiric stand point or do you have any proof to sustain that? According to my records, DBD is running about the same or better if you consider the graphical improvements without requiring extra power from your hardware.
---
i sit in purple ranks. i gotta climb back up after the reset tho(this did happen right after the reset to be fair)
---
oh btw speaking of "they didnt say anything messed up", here's my last game as hag: [http://prntscr.com/qbr9zb](http://prntscr.com/qbr9zb)contains: n word

To track with blood orbs the person has to already be injured. You can track with scratch marks if you are chasing them, or you can simply hear their grunts of pain. If they have iron will you can track blood stains. Admittedly blood stains can be hard to follow on some maps so blood orbs are nice then. Blood orbs are good at tracking and more convenient, but that doesn't mean you cant track just as well without them.
---
If every killer was capable of winning every game, optimal play would result in a 4k. I think optimal play on both sides should result in a 2k.
---
If you‚Äôre in red rank and happen to end the match in 1-2 minutes either because the survivors were throwing or you just snowballed out of control you will 100% de rank even with a 4k. If it goes 2 minutes you might be able to just eek out a safety.
---
Nancy = toxic and call the killer trash even if they die. Flashlight spam, tbagging etc. 
---
Nea = decent loopers but usually dies because they are to cocky or read the killer movements wrong
---
Cladd = I Main her p3 with proud I try to push gens and take killer aggro with prove thyself and OOO and bond being my go to perks. The typical cladd will hide in a corner and Sprint burst away to unhook survivors then hide and do noting.
---
Jake mains = ME JAKE ME SEE HOOK ME SABO. Also they Always play old man Jake or is a legacy survivor with 3k+ hours.
---
Meg = Sprint burst to T walls then die.
---
Kate/Feng = will Always run to the "infinity" loop
---
Jeff = cant handle chases for more then 20 seconds. Always go for unhooks and do all the gens 
---
Laurie = F L A S H L I G H T .
---
Tapp = good loopers. Always find ruin. 
---
Ace = pro players who only die if the killer tunnel him while his team is doing no gens. Also got a level 2 iron will
---
Adam = rare but they exist. Always deliverance infront of your face.
---
Quentin = toxic and rare to find 
---
Dwight = bald man scary avoid at all cost. 
---
Or just New players who bring level 1 provethyself and have no clue how to hit a skill check but we all love them &lt;3
---
It's easy to tell only PC and Switch have servers when you look at those two  and realize they get much better ping.

Imagine buying a game only to play half of it.

people were already doing that with Ghost tho. I personally have been using something almost identical to his wraith build/strategy for like 2 years

Looks pretty good and off topic but I‚Äôm curious about your channel. What‚Äôs the name? 
---
I‚Äôm interested about the Scary story telling.
---
Actually did this for my obsession tome challenge lol.
---
that's definitely not true. he was meta on console long before tru3 began playing him

I have definitely found where the survivor mains hide. And 5th perk with their power? What, do you want them ALL to be M1 basic bitch killers?
---
On the official Dead by Daylight Wikipedia, Huntress Lullaby states that every Token subtracts 14% from the warning sound‚Äôs base time with the fifth Token removing the warning sound completely. 
---
But before this edit (which was made 6 days ago), it said every token reduced the warning sound‚Äôs base time by 20% with the fifth token reducing it by 100%.
---
So my question is this: what made this change happen and is it a visual and not gameplay mechanic change? I‚Äôve looked through the recent patch notes, but couldn‚Äôt find anything about it, so some help would be appreciated.
---
I highly suggest looking up tutorials on how to run loops and killer guides on YT. My personal favorite is the Entity Education series by int3r4ct. Very informative and helpful!
---
However, it's ultimately up to you playing the game and figuring things out yourself. Just keep at it, you'll get better with time my dude! Don't get discouraged, we all sucked at first ;)

i did this once and it made me play clown for the match but when i returned to the menu screen i just owned Freddy and could play and level him up until i clicked another killer ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

Can we please go back to the Victory Cube please
---
Damn if only he placed you in the shack lol.
---
I didn't insult you or anything (you do you bubu) just trying to get a point across in a classic passive aggressive demeanor.
---
Tap it! Always tap it
---
Considering everyone replying to you was initially doing that based on survivors getting a pip for escaping and to change your mind, your point was the exact opposite of what you‚Äôre claiming it to be.
---
Even if it was a counter to someone claiming that a 4k should be an auto pip for a killer, ppl are giving you plenty of reasons for that being exploited on the survivors side and how they some could rank up even if they themselves do nothing.
---
I mean no one tells you to let it be when you spot a survivor sneaking for a save, you can actually chase and down that survivor and hook em, if that was what you were gonna do in the first place. Spotting anyone doesnt mean now you are entitled to camp or something, its just an excuse.
---
See I think the problem with this is that it removes the need to save anyone in the struggle phase as they can save themselves. Therefore an entire team with this means survivors can do gens instead of risking the save, and the killer would need to hook everyone 4 times instead of 3 which is a big deal, so big of a deal that even disabling all your perks doesn't make up for it.
---
alive with no perks is infinitely better than dead, and imo thats too powerful
---
i was slightly confused and seeked answers in the "post game chat"
---
&gt;You have to sacrifice your first born child and have all the quadratic formulas in your head while playing killer to not get steam rolled. Meanwhile you play survivor and you‚Äôre just chilling eating cereal and still pip even if you die
---
when you check the most watched streamers its mostly the opposite, like scottjund clearly interacts with chat and had a 87 (!) 4k win Oni roll, OhTofu autopilots for 2 kills at least even with wraith, meanwhile Pug and Puppers dies a lot.
---
Or the killer didn't manage to find a survivor / got looped in that time.
---
Yes I am new to the game, this may be a recycled topic, but I found it relatable so I shared it, no I do not REALLY enjoy recycled content it‚Äôs legit a meme I came up with, and yes it is low effort but most memes are and why can‚Äôt this subreddit be a place for video clips, fan art, discussion AND memes?
---
&gt;Essentially, as Killer, play fair, don‚Äôt tunnel, don‚Äôt camp
---
lmao wtf
---
these are parts of the game, you're denying yourself victories because survivors don't like to lose?
---
your fault
---
You're welcome! Liked it so much I saved it! Solid work, my friend. Wish I had that talent! I can't draw a stick figure! Ha!
---
I loved this game as a kid but no
---
Well that worked out pretty great for you
---
Butthurt MTV fans downvoting
---
ohh i see, i only checked steve and thought they were all only obtainable via cells. thanks!
---
God I don‚Äôt want to respond to your name. 
---
Anyway someone said earlier that this is repost because MoM is up there lol
---
#EVIL WITHIN INTENSIFIES
---
I‚Äôm not sure the window bait would be worth anything with it being blocked but I see those other options now.
---
BuT dEvOuR hOpE...lol
---
yeah I know you just seemed kind of heated and I respect your opinion on the topic. I was just trying to share a relatable meme and try to make someone laugh
---
My point still stands. Piping as a survivor is a joke
---
Thanks! Was a bit of a battle but I think it's finally shaping up
---
Oh lord, pun unintended but here we are
---
And it's a bit of a hodgepodge of spooky stuff in general really. Though I've got playlists solely for the audiobooks. Name is the same as my username here haha
---
So if your new I was right and that's not ment as an insult. If you just joined the game and experience one of our ancient tragedies than hey welcome to DbD.
---
I‚Äôm simply relaying what every biased Survivor thinks is fair and balanced.
---
these are parts of the game, you're denying yourself victories by refusing to engage in effective strats because survivors don't like to lose?
---
He didn't DC, I got straight up thrown back to the main menu, lost my items and got no BP or progress towards my tome whatsoever
---
Its too scary for you, I understand dont worry.
---
it doesn't matter what they think is fair and balanced
---
thanks man besides some of the very toxic people I met who lag switch and just throw the game to spite you, the community is one of the best I‚Äôve seen throughout my gaming years, and I‚Äôm happy to be playing this awesome game with you guys
---
I usually go for it if I'm not trying to do a challenge/tome and there's no noed. If noed is up I'm out though.
---
Does anybody start each game with a game strategy? I've been toying with starting at the middle gen ( if possible) so we aren't stuck with it in the end.
---
It‚Äôs not a simple issue to fix. If the killer becomes overly competitive, the survivors will as well. In order for red rank killers to not play as stressfully, the survivors need to also play more relaxed, and vice versa. There is no singular fix to this, as it is a problem that has to do mostly with the players. There are things that BHVR can do to try to mitigate this stress, but it essentially has to do with the players. 
---
One way to try to help with this issue is to make both player bases not feel as though getting 4 kills or escaping is the definitive form of victory. Other incentives, such as the archive challenges, are a good way of making players focus on something other than the number of kills or wether they escaped. When it comes to things like tunneling, camping, using perks that the community has deemed ‚Äútoxic,‚Äù there‚Äôs nothing that BHVR can really do to stop them. Many people are not the nicest beings around, so they will display their negativity in-game. 
---
Again, there are a few small things that BHVR can do to try to help, but it all boils down to the players and how they choose to play the game.
---
The problem is I still suck 466 hours in...
---
I got this a few weeks ago, congrats! Great accomplishment
---
My point was the exact opposite of what I was claiming it to be? What? To avoid confusion, my position is this. A killer should never depip for a 4k, and a survivor should never depip for an escape. (My initial comment was a parody of the comment I was replying to, come on mate.)
---
People are giving me reasons, I dont think that they're entirely legitimate, and fall apart at higher ranks. Btw if people just "sneak around all game and get hatch" they wont rank up. Because surprise, you cant rank up with black pips. So no, you cant rank up if you do nothing. 
---
And if you continuously play with people who sneak around and do nothing all match, then that just tells me you're probably a brown ranked survivor. (Which is fine, but if you have that little experience in the game you shouldnt be speaking about the ranking system in the first place. Because you havent ranked up yet.)
---
Unfortunately no.
---
I know this post is bad but it made me laugh for some reason
---
Where is this nonsense going on when I run ruin? It's dead in 30 seconds every time.
---
There's truth to it being random. It depends on your FPS, the ping to the server, screen tear from vsync, lag in general, not to mention bugs.
---
There's also truth to us sucking though, haha.
---
Hey just grab a cheap drawing book. Whenever you're bored, just listen to music and doodle. You don't have to be good at it, but after a while you start picking up skills. It's fun to draw random dumb shit for laughs
---
What does NOED do
---
&gt; I dunno, maybe? The connection was fine (green ping indicator in lobby) up until this last bit,
---
...well yeah. because at the end is when the desync occurred. it could have been caused by anything. you don't need consistently meh or poor internet for that to happen
---
Same here. I usually expect at least one person to search for the totem since a lot of people simply refuse to try at gens with ruin active so having 2-4 people searching for ruin is counter-productive.
---
Also billy doesn‚Äôt need to rely on blood tracking, he can just insta down them.
---
Yeah I want that rain coat
---
Wonder how he have got any reception in those woods.
---
Yep, im rank 3 survivor and keep running into high rank campers. It is upsetting to see people can climb up the ranks by camping. Or maybe they are trying to do dailies etc. with their low leveled killers and just feel unconfident.
---
To be honest I cant understand why the 95% of the clauddetes and neas are a piece of shit
---
Yeah bro, it's so much more fun when you just stop caring.
---
trust me killers are tired of feeling like they need 3/4 slowdown perks too
---
because it isn't
---
Groovy, nice work
---
We found the counter to oni boys.
---
I'm way more stressed as survivor than killer. its part of the reason i play almost entirely killer. when i play killer, I'm also watching videos, but if I'm even slightly distracted as survivor, I'll get caught off guard by the killer or miss a skill check
---
So you face camp the body blocker, or the survivor you caught that bb is trying to save? Because if it is the latter, you are not punishing the body blocker.
---
NOED assigns itself to an available dull totem. If the dull totem in question is cleansed, NOED will move to to the next available dull totem, rinse and repeat until either the last gen is done or all dull totems are removed. 
---
If a dull totem remains when the last gen is finished, NOED will manifest in the totem, turning it into a hex totem. As long as the totem stands, the killer gets a 4% haste and successful basic attacks instantly down a survivor. 
---
You‚Äôre probably thinking about Blood warden, which gives you a 1 time block on the exit gates for 60 seconds if you hook a survivor while an exit gate is open.
---
Could you please point out where I've said anything hypocritical?
---
The entire point of my comment is that in my experience, killers waits long; survivor waits short. All in this thread there have been people saying I'm wrong or experiencing a coincidence, that the waits are the other way round, yet I've consistently said that this is my experience and all I've ever experienced.
---
I've not said others are wrong. I've not said killers can't have short waits and survivors can't have long waits. I've simply said that I have only experienced long killer waits and long survivor waits and that I've seen that sentiment reflected often on here. 
---
So, anything else you wanna say to try to seem smart?
---
As whom do you play? Which is your main and your main perk build? Let‚Äôs start from there.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand your question
---
looking away from center of map improves the framerate on the skillchecks it seems
---
most people ignore ruin and just take it if they find it and also only heal if they need to. i can be in a 30 second chase and lose ruin and 2-3 gens. idk how tou can get away with just standing still and not losing
---
That's what we call in the killer biz, "a big oof."
---
lmao you are unhinged
---
feel better soon
---
Tbh, I‚Äôm having a really difficult time deciphering what you‚Äôre saying but if I‚Äôm understanding correctly, I don‚Äôt think your understanding of the killers line of play in that situation is very good if you‚Äôre making that leap of logic. 
---
Face camping, is sitting directly on top of a hooked survivor until they die, regardless of whether or not other players are around. 
---
It‚Äôs clearly not face camping when the killer sees survivors approaching the hook and actively stops the save attempt by being a threat to the save attempts. Just letting them unhook the survivor for free is inherently not in their best interest. 
---
If the team didn‚Äôt want the killer to stay close, they should have waited longer to approach so the killer could have the time to asses that leaving the hook was safe.
---
"Welp..."
---
When the game gets to be too much and I just can‚Äôt seem to get a break, I just start incorporating troll games in every once in a while. If you get gen rushed, but got to have fun dancing around survivors on a gen or do a slug race at the end or whatever happens, that match wasn‚Äôt serious. Kinda like a reminder that it‚Äôs just a game, and games are meant to be fun even if you lose.
---
it became free on ps4 plus its almost at 100,000 players
---
I actually said in the vid "Balanced landing hello???" But it was kinda low ground and I muted the voice so yeah xd
---
Those people are the reason why I will not unhook any survivors anymore.
---
I fucking hated that damn Yeti. Was there anyway to beat the game or were you just scripted to die? Lol
---
Meh, no need to be like that either
---
I play solo most of the time, and usually go in with several different possible plans. I like to start on the middle gens as well, partially because it's good strategy for end game, but also because killers are less likely to check those gens at the beginning of the game.
---
I usually try to work on a separate gen from everyone else, because split pressure is good, and because the killer is more likely to want to pressure gens with more survivors on them.
---
Depending on the map, I'll pick different gens to start on. On some maps, there are three gens that spawn close together. If I see that combination, I'll definitely go there first. On a map like Azarov's, I'll go to the opposite end to work on a gen since it takes the killer so long to get back and forth. I usually leave indoor gens on maps like Coal Tower or the Asylum for last.
---
The other thing that affects my plan is which killer I'm up against. I'll almost always break off on my own regardless of the killer, but some killers will make certain gens unsafe. If I hear a Billy, I want a well protected gen with a good escape route until I know he's somewhere else. If I see a Ghostface, I want a gen with good lines of sight so he can't sneak up on me.
---
Of course, other survivors can make things difficult if they all stack on a gen, or complete all the gens on one side of the map. Sometimes I end up having to change my approach if I see too many gens popping, or too many survivors getting hooked down one end.
---
something similar happened to me yesterday, except it was on my end because my roommate decided to stream something massive *on his phone*. he has a computer! I don't know why he decided to use his fucking phone and shit up our internet
---
I think it's because you hit that lil rock outcrop on the way down. It probably registered as two small falls, not big enough to activate bl
---
Apologies for the absolute darkness, apparently I was sent to the shadow realm in this match. I tried to use a filter to make the lockers actually visible but not much I can do on my phone.
---
Poor soul :(
---
I think you meant to say ‚Äúbeauty‚Äù
---
Thanks. I knew the rules and was wondering if they just had the luck to find it while slugged, so I guess just my bad.
---
Didnt they change it so it doesnt work vs ghost face and t1 myers?
---
As survivor I do like to plan for avoiding a three gen as much as possible. Do the unsafe gens first. Any solo person gens I try to do early unless they‚Äôre in the corner of the map when the killer won‚Äôt give two fuck about in the early game. 
---
Basically if you ever see a Solo Gen (Suicide gen) do it first.
---
You're always doomed to die, even scarier realising you can never get away.
---
Most likely people have never watched the show. This mask is fucking ugly idk how anyone likes it compared to classic gf
---
Laughs in plunderers instinc
---
Haven't been playing to buy any
---
lmao i play with that exact outfit, is that ur own steve or someone else‚Äôs?
---
I play killer and survivor, I also got the game last year for free ü§°, look at all these clowns (killer mains that lobby dodge) downvoting
---
Jane's ass
---
On some matches when some people get hooked and they were actually doing something in the game, like help reparing gens or clensing totems I'll rescue them but if they just fuck around and literally don't help then I don't. Other people rescue them.

Is all you do generalize, insult using the BEST insult being calling someone a clown, and call killers OP and bad?
---
bwshhqahhaüòÇüòÇüíÄ
---
if someone saves in my face and i couldn't stop the save, I'll down the person saved then chase the person who unhooked. still punishes the team as that player cant do gens, but doesn't punish the person who did nothing wrong
---
Why unbreakable and no mither?
---
Reapr?
---
I love baiting dead hards with Bing Bong, if they look back at me and I start the animation of the bell they think I'm lunging. If I make it so the bell makes a sound and they're looking away they usually use it because they heard something.
---
YES I keep getting tunnelled as sweater Nancy! I think they just love the sweaters so much they want to keep looking at it
---
It's just a mask
---
Team Fortress 2 and Titan Fall 2 sound the same
---
I tapped out one gen the other day. It was the only gen that even got finished. After the round was over, 3 people in an obvious SWF made fun of me for tapping.
---
Feng tossed her controller/entire Nintendo switch after being de synced for 1.5 seconds causing her to get downed, even after using dead hard correctly
---
Because Feng is a **GAMER**
---
Yeah, I actually drop one of those two once in a while - but, I have come to like running them together. There is often times where I find people to work gens with that I wouldn't without Bond. But, actually the best info it provides me - is getting others to work together. I can usually see someone on a gen, and see another nearby - and run to him and give 'em a signal to follow. Which lets those two work together, then I go find the last guy to work with.
---
I mainly see Empathy as a killer tracker, and Bond as a group buider.
---
Oni did it in wrath mode! /s
---
i can rest easy knowing someone has worse fashion sense than myself. even if it is just mr. steve harrington.
---
It was good specifically on legion, then they changed how deep wounds worked. It used to not go down when you were in the terror radius and nemesis would make you have no terror radius against the person who pallet stunned you.
---
Yes, one that I made myself! The coveralls (which aren't easy to see) are still being worked on. (Thus the WIP part) But after ages of making the mask I wanted to share it :)
---
Since now Killers can be anything biped, a yeti/wendigo would be cool
---
This literally happened to me yesterday. I was doing the trapper archive challenge and was running the add-on where if someone escaped they would be put into the dying state. Two people got trapped at the same time, someone DC‚Äôd and one of the two trapped people DC‚Äôd too, me, Claudette, and Quentin proceeded to farm and more or less I got the challenge done
---
I play Demogorgon. I just prestiged it so I don't have all of these perks, but usually I'd run Whispers, Ruin, Save the Best for Last, and Barbeque &amp; Chilli.
---
It‚Äôs not anymore, before the deep wounds rework the oblivious status effect would‚Äôve greatly benefitted him, since deep wounds timers used to decrease while outside a terror radius
---
even in rank 20 i had one game where a trapper facecamped his first hook and the dude hook had the perk to where we could see the killer facecamping him. we just did every gen in the time he watched that hook and all escaped minus the unlucky dude who was camped
---
Quentin has no sweater :c
---
demon spider went all throughout time, space, and pop culture to bring together random people, who may or may not have even had anything to do with the killer they were introduced with, to be killed by random people, who may or may not have even been bad people beforehand, over and over and over again
---
So you want oni to be just like hillbilly is essentially all I‚Äôm getting from you..
---
I'm not saying eithers balanced. Just that i enjoyed deathgarden more
---
1. This breaks the rules of the sub
---
2. You are pointing out A GRAY MEDKIT like are you fucking dumb
---
3. Your trash
---
First of all, I did not say face camping, i said camping, you can see it at the end of my comment. 
---
Second, can you define ‚Äúwaiting longer‚Äù ? Because there are times the killer wont leave the 20 meter radius, searching every spot, taking their sweet time. Should i wait for a minute as a survivor ? Should i wait for the other survivor to go to wiggle phase ? It is all relative you see. Even when  a killer doesnt think that he/she is camping, that ‚Äúassessment‚Äù process actually becomes an act of camping. There are times a survivor has to act before it is too late. 
---
What im saying is simple, did you spot a survivor trying to sneak ? Just go and down him/her. You spotted two ? Make sure you injure both before proceeding to down one. Just dont go back to hook over and over again after hitting them because you think camping is somehow justified now. Besides, if you are getting another one on the hook while they are unhooking someone, it is not a free unhook anymore right ?  
---
Btw, it sounds like i am telling you what to do a lot and if it sounds annoying, i apologise. Im just trying to say that there are other options than camping even under these specific conditions.
---
With the nerf of what I considered meta perks (BL/BT/Self Care) I‚Äôve been experimenting with builds and was curious what survivor mains are running these days. 
---
These days I‚Äôve gone with Adrenaline/DS/Prove Thyself and the last perk slot changes depending if I‚Äôm playing SWF or solo (Small Game or Unbreakable)
---
What builds have y‚Äôall had success with?
---
Here's to many more!
---
Real mature üòí
---
People really don't get even obvious sarcasm on this subreddit
---
A gen where only one person can work on it due to its positioning.
---
"...look at all these clowns (killer mains that lobby dodge) downvoting" 
---
That's an entire generalisation wether you accept it or not. Do you even know how to read at all yourself? And what the fuck does me being an Aussie have to do with this?
---
Self care is shit end of the discussion
---
I‚Äôm not a big fan of the rework suggestion.... 
---
Also saying his power is one of the most boring ones hurts my soul.
---
This is true and is exactly what happened in one game I had. She at least gg-ed at the end so I think they were doing it for the memes
---
Or they could have just come up with a better perk to slow the game down that doesn't utterly crush new players or rando groups.
---
I politely disagree. He works the same still for me as any other killer because I wasn‚Äôt even aware until a little bit before the update that his frenzy activated sloppy. It may not be as good to you but he‚Äôs still the same old if not better legion to me after the buff for him and that being taken away imo.
---
Its what basic bitch survivors do, they have 4 perks while killers have 5
---
I hate doing gens with Ruin up, I'll usually go looking for it. If I can't find it easily, I'll just start repairing. It also depends on what my team is doing.
---
This looks so good, how did you make it?
---
What are those other 2 huge dents?... Oh good god.
---
When idiot survivors don't spread the last three gens out it creates a triangle or race track. It is beyond easy to protect and pick off even the best survivors from. Many will say gen camping not realizing that they made a tactical mistake not spreading the finished generators.
---
Me either, I just find it hard to have fun when I'm getting looped for ages on end and have little to show for it.
---
Wait wait, i am not the one saying that. Campers who say ‚Äú ez noob‚Äù are saying that. I agree with you 100%, that logic doesnt make sense. Then again, we are talking about campers here, so you can throw logic out of the window :)
---
I agree, he's just boring to play also because his damn strike is so hard to get to connect. I'm also on PS4 and while yes I'm able to do a 90-degree flick it never really seems to help much.
---
I like the way you think but we need more Christmas spirit
---
Every killer has a place in someone‚Äôs heart no doubt but for me personally, it‚Äôs just the least exciting. The only time it is enjoyable to use is when you hit multiple survivors. Apart from that feature, he just lacks that element that makes a killer unique. My suggestion is rough and can be changed, but it‚Äôs down to personal taste. Lots of people liked the old Freddy, but you can‚Äôt deny that the new one is much stronger, and for the better.
---
Good thing no one plays Quentin
---
Lmao just don‚Äôt tunnel. And even so, taking DS isn‚Äôt even all that for me. I usually find them again and chase them. Or, I go after someone else
---
Are these killer or survivor perks?
---
Mime oni
---
Doesn't sound like that's what he was saying to me. He's just pointing out that he's a bad copy of other abilities. I'm in the same boat as I just feel he's boring to play on PS4. I personally don't have any answers to what should change about him.
---
Wait wait wait, what? Are you trying to imply ALL survivor mains want killers to have their powers removed or something else you aren't conveying at all?
---
Been a minute since I‚Äôve seen a ‚Äúsacrifice two survivors‚Äù daily. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen it for anybody but the Shape, either. I legitimately thought it was one of his unique dailies. üò∂
---
Literally wants the hillbilly with extra steps meme ro be true.
---
Lol thank you. 
---
Yeah we do need more christmas spirit also Merry early Christmas.
---
I‚Äôve been in situations where I‚Äôve hit both. Sometimes it‚Äôs just unfortunate. I was playing huntress when I double downed the guy. Was aiming for the rescuer and missed the hit.
---
4 hits to get survivors into dying state? Lmao biggest nerf ever Id say
---
Ah ok. Yeah, definitely suicide gen!
---
Merry Christmas
---
Thanks for skimming through the whole thing without understand *why* it‚Äôs four hits.
---
It‚Äôs killer sided mechanics
---
Thank you! The mask itself is made from just standard foam latex, I painted it using a mix of 50/50 liquid latex and latex based paint, then sealed it with spray liquitex. Then just glued a couple pairs of falsies to the eyes!
---
if i down then hook the unhooker or lose the unhooker, i will return to hook the first guy. its just not the first thing i do. i feel bad.
---
They're not perks, they're more like mechanics I think would be cool to have in the game.
---
*VIBE CHECK*
---
Oh lmao. Sorry about that. I‚Äôm high and read it wrong lmao
---
Ohh okay I was kind of lost there
---
100% this. If it ends up being devour, you know where it is and can come back and clean it.
---
I'm having this same issue. I ordered on the 5th of December. They took my money same day but I recieved no confirmation. I've reached out twice and nothing. I'm incredibly frustrated because I thought I'd have a nice gift to give to my little sister and here I am completely in the dark. I'm glad you got your order at least confirmed. Also while searching for others who have had problems, I found a post from a girl on instagram who, on top of hearing nothing from customer service, ordered the same hoodie I did (trapper hoodie), recieved a long sleeve shirt with the same design instead of the hoodie that's being advertised. I really hope this isnt the case because I can't even contact them now for a simply confirmation email.
---
Vampyr was a pretty good twist/take on vampires. 
---
But if we are going on 'things that have been done to death' there is the serial killer clown, cannibal hill billy x2, asian spirit getting revenge x2, murdering pedophile, young disturbed teens who kill, mysterious creature that eats people, etc.
---
Honestly there isnt a lot of orginality anywhere now. Especially horror. Once they started licensing horror movies and shows we have been getting less creative, newish ideas from BHVR.
---
Personally I want to see them make all their own unique characters instead of ham fisting Michael Myers/any other 30 year old + movie character into the lore.
---
When people say Oni is good, show them this
---
Some of em are cool but imo backup generator is pretty useless if it is visually different then other gens because survivors would just avoid doing it.
---
Same, I wish both sides would just knock it off and play the game. We all get it, sh*t happens, things seem unfair sometimes, but life's not fair. Deal with it and move onto the next game. Lol
---
I like the ideas but I don't think 50% extra bloodpoints is enough of an incentive for the backup generator. Maybe make it count as two generators.
---
I am a legion main, I still play them a lot. Overall they got buffed, all I was saying is sloppy butcher on legion lost some of its effectiveness since you can‚Äôt use your power to apply it anymore.
---
I‚Äôm just a ol Slasher fan and leatherface was my favorite so the crazed run is special to me. 
---
But further then that and maybe it‚Äôs because I‚Äôm reading it and not picturing it right but these changes sound worse then his kit now. 
---
I just think he needs to have a addon or 2 be part of his kit. His chainsaw revving is sooo slow, adding either primer bulb or the other addon (green gas can looking one) would just make him better. 
---
But it‚Äôs not his power that he suffers from its mobility, any killer without good mobility pretty much suffers and can‚Äôt make it to the top top.
---
Im a rank 1 killer and I know exactly what you mean. I have to take breaks often just because I am mentally drained after every match.
---
bright red w/ rotting pig head doesn't scream assassin to me other than the blade so just give danny the blade ezpz

Forgive me if I'm wrong but couldn't you press F to get some sort of speed boost and outrun the yeti?

A little late to comment but I think left behind needs a rebuild, along with we‚Äôre gonna live forever, pharmacy, Ace‚Äôs two perks that aren‚Äôt ace in the hole, solidarity, and decisive- a lot more but I‚Äôm not on dbd just thinking of the top of my head.

A few that could use some just major/minor changes are borrowed time, streetwise, sprint burst, prove thyself, detectives hunch, stake out, diversion and honestly so much more but I‚Äôd be sitting here writing forever. Not saying a lot of survivor perks aren‚Äôt good but they could use a lot of adjustment; same with killer.

Emblem system is garbage.

A great ghost face can jump scare and stop chases from happening..which is bad.

On the other hand, a Survivor whose treasure hunting will more or less be considered useless despite all the tools they give to the survivors.

I can absolutely understand that, but at the end of the day I‚Äôm still trying to progress towards a win and as unfortunate as it may be for the poor sap it‚Äôs the best play I have.

Fiona: Red Rank

Shrek and Harold: Green and Brown Rank, respectively

The Queen (can't remember her name): The Killer with Haunted Grounds

Donkey: Brown Rank who thinks tapping is the best counter to Ruin

They didn‚Äôt change Oni on consoles at all its been tested they just changed pc to be in line with consoles shit flick

Yeah I get that. I was thinking it could help to counter 3 gen strats by giving survivors an extra, albeit more difficult gen to complete. I didn't want to make it too easy to complete since it is effectively another gen that would be added to the game and I was worried about breaking the balance.

I love you
