I'd say technically it can be counted by exploiting in some way.
---

---
Being able to lose out on getting an achievement because of people DC'ing seems like an "error in design" to me.
---
---
---
Wheres the fun in that?
---
I love my 8 pages of salt on my profile, theyre like medals for me
---
You're a godsend. 
---
I only have 750ish hours and Im rank 2 cant get 1 Soo close
---
You weren‚Äôt on the ground lol. U used it at the same time they hit you, which nullified the hit. 
---
Maybe I should watch whole Saw movie series again. Hard to remember everything...but Amanda was beautiful, that‚Äôs the important! Also I‚Äôm so glad you liked my art!
---
You gotta run Unnerving presence, Overwhelming presence,  Clourophobia and Monitor and Abuse on Dead Rabbit Vanity mirror myers
---
Exactly! When the Spirit's *seifuku* came out and someone shared a screenshot of her undergarments here I was like *"Okay, that's definitely an improvement"*, then came Feng and it's even better. A bold move, BHVR, but a very rewarding one ;)
---
And being a dick in post game chat is a requirement for surviving
---
Thank you!
---
I have 2 accounts.
---
I got banned on both of my accounts for a week when the first ban wave for DCing came around in about september, then I got banned again on my main in mid december for 2 weeks. I hate this fucking game so much that it's got to the point where I don't even care if I get perm banned
---
Thanks devs for trying something new :) I like how the event discourages farming, bland doesnt effect the speed of the game :) it's a great experience. While some people complain about not getting all free cosmetics, I'm hopeful that some of them buy them anyways so that you can have money to keep making the game a better experience for us all 
---
Console best I can do is offer the killer the dance of my ancestors at the gate
---
Poe's law
---
&gt;Survivors make a mistake thinking we will chase them away from the gen
---
This always amuses me on maps like Suffocation Pit and Resting Place. I have control over half the map and survivors try to pull me into the dead side that still has half the pallets up?
---
The ears, right!? The *'eeeaaaars...'*
---
Except Myers Op add-ons also take some time and skill to activate which Legions do not. However the majority of Legions add-ons are junk.
---
I'd argue that Legion is actually easier to play against than Doctor as it's even weaker to stealth players which Doctor counters to a large extent.
---
Legion is not OP, I'm a pretty crappy survivor but that's one of the killers I tend to relax with because I know I stand a decent chance of escape. I would agree though that it's not a fun killer by any stretch of the imagination. Right down there with Freddy on the annoyance factor. 
---
Because it completely ruins the fun in the game for survivors. There is nothing fun about watching the killer stand in front of you, and there is nothing fun about just doing a gen when the killer is sitting in front of a hooked survivor. That's why it's frowned upon.
---

---
On pc as well. I usually just get salty survivors when I 4k. Because if the are geedily swarming the hook as soon as I hook someone, I'm obligated ti move etc etc.
---
Yeah salty survivors exist on pc too. That's why I'm amazed when I stomp ad LF because they are glad it was a fair game at least
---
Noice.
---
I'm here too
---
That seems like too high of a number but I guess disconnects on the games part is factored into that. Plenty of games where the loading screen just freezes.
---
You can do it, you still have a few more days!
---
This should definitely continue 
---
Join in a game with him and drop them one at a time:)
---
All of Legion, I like their masks.
---
It‚Äôs the poor players that allowed you to get a 4K in the first place. This doesn‚Äôt prove anything other than that your skill level was moderately above those survivors.
---
Well yeah, I know there is salt on pc, I still find it weird that you have been complimented before.
---
Yeah, but most of the time is Hoffman the one that acts as the Pig and Tapp is just in 2 movies (1 really) out of the 8. I guess the problem is there are so many characters in the series it's difficult to pick one.
---
I actually don't really care about the gore stuff, I really like the story of the saga more. But I digress, again, love the art!
---
So do I lol
---
I feel bad for the Rank 10 Killers having to play against someone with over 3k hours who should definitely be on Rank 1.
---
Ah, same. That happened to me today, quite a disappointment to realize that I had not gained a single lunar coin. :\[
---
I honestly love the banter between killers and survivors during and after games. I‚Äôm a killer main and yea after almost every game I got a message from someone about something or I message a survivor about something. In the end of the day, it just makes the game more amusing to me lol 
---
I like them and have 2 cats that are alive and well thank you very much.
---
I play solo, rank 15. it's not like I'm running in a SWF death squad so the killers don't have a problem. My teammates are usually shit enough to waste all of the pallets and get me killed anyway. These survivor nerfs have just made the game unfun for me.
---
That's only if he hits someone in Feral Frenzy and you're only revealed if you have not been afflicted with Deep Wounds while being in his base 24m TR.
---
How? You can block them from messaging you, but that's it as far as I know.
---
What survivor nerfs are you referring to exactly?
---
I can't find the link could you pm me?
---
So he needs a buff?
---
If you block them on steam the game will not put you with or against them.
---
brown cow stunning 
---
That's why, the game itself is easy, but the post-match is the death itself.
---

---
That rank range is DC hell. Survivors quit after getting seen. Much like the picture this has been my last four days at rank 14. I haven't had 1 match without a DC. 
---
That would be correct.
---
I suppose that's true. It is awful that people are able to exploit that though.
---
Remember Me doesn't even affect any action speeds apart from Exit Gates so I don't know where that came from

"WAGH" -Survivors when the killer isn't Wraith
---
This looks amazing!! I love the contrast comic-book look. Well done!! ‚ô•Ô∏è
---
Because people paid for a campfire simulator.
---
Because people paid for a hook and camp game.
---
Because people paid for a laggy game.
---
Because people who paid the game and who aren't good at the game get t-bagged at the exit gates.
---
Because people who paid for the game and can't catch a survivor get called names.
---
Because people who paid for the game work hard for a Rank that doesn't reward them but make the game excessively more difficult.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
But some people play fairly, and nicely. 
---
Some people derank all the way to the lowest of Ranks to help survivors out.
---
Kill your Friends is a great way to learn.
---
Oh man I'm still working towards the bloody head, I totally forgot about it! Could always add it in future. Thank you very much!
---
I feel like part of it is the instadown granted by the chainsaw coupled with the possible multiple downs at once if the Survivors are caught in a disadvantageous position. I've noticed a lot of Survivors take The Cannibal pretty lightly and assume the player playing him isn't very skilled because he's such an easy Killer to pick up, and as a result let themselves slip up more times in chases than they can afford because most other Killers' chases don't end after the first hit. Then because they were punished for their mistakes and couldn't run the Killer for 3 generators they're all salty because they're entitled to a win.
---
Walking backwards so the deep wound timer goes down when it shouldn't.
---
Probably because you're going to be chasing the Obsession to try to power up Remember me, so Dying Light slows down the game as well.
---
ive taken to always looking at the edge of the basement stairs when i go up them, because ive caught a stupid amount of survivors just crouching there like a shitty batman waiting for me to leave
---
*Claudette noises*
---
I wonder why they made the change from shorts to pants. Also, who made that choice?
---
All in saying is hes tiny and hard to keep track of. That's why he scary. 
---
The worst part of to cock block that achievement jump in a locker
---
wait huh???? do they have to hit you with frenzy first? this sounds like bullshit.
---
How did you get that flair? üòÇ
---
How is soloing unfun? I've solo'd for most of those 1k hours and I never get tired of it. It's much better than SWFing, where you can always know what the Killer's doing (at least if you use comms). If your teammates are too "stupid" for you, maybe you should consider ranking up. If the Killers are too good for you, well, you can't go below Rank 15 so you don't really have a choice there.
---
Thanatophobia is garbage due to low % and i wouldn't waste a perk slot on NOED tbh.
---
I currently use BBQ, MYC, Pop Goes The Weasel &amp; Devour Hope (granted the totem doesn't last that long most games, it still has it's uses).
---
I used to run Stridor instead of PGTW but i can hear survivors just fine without it.
---
You ain‚Äôt ever gonna learn how to survive those teenage bastards if you don‚Äôt at least try!!!

I don't want to play at high ranks where fucking the majority of people are fucking noobs who run urban and spine chill. I really really enjoy playing SWF but my mic broke a couple of months ago so I haven't been able to play properly. Solo is total cancer.
---
iron grasp, agitation, mad grit and ruin, i guess?
---
down someone and then run at people with your new friend and stab them
---
Lets get rid of crouching too. Its toxic. 
---
Not sure how this is meant to prove anything at all. Sure, you did well with him but that doesn't change the fact he is arguably the weakest Killer in the game.
---
I could easily post an image just like this where it's the Nurse and everyone escaped. That wouldn't somehow disprove the Nurse being the absolute best Killer in the game.
---
The logic to this post is bad.
---
Only allow BP to be earned in high rank matches... uhh I think you meant to say only allow ‚Äúladder points‚Äù or something new they‚Äôd add to fix be problem... It would make sense to have levels 20 - 10 be unregulated in terms of rank for SWF and 10-5, 4-1 be separate as well. 
---
I mean, by rank 12 they shouldn't be noobs. Not at rank 1 level, but not bad enough to need pity.
---
What did happen? People always said he was a bad killer and they bugged them and few times and now everyone memes that he isn‚Äôt fun to play against. I‚Äôve always disliked him, but why did the community change their mind?
---
"So... I got out. What now?"
---
I have done the will of the gods. Witness perfection mortal. 
---
Maybe get out of new-player ranks so you have a chance at having decent killers (so you'll actually have a challenge) &amp; teammates who know what they're doing?
---
don't the locations mean nothing? one killer was under Kenya or something.
---
Billy definitely doesn‚Äôt strike me as dark. Dark types rely on sneaky tactics. Ain‚Äôt nothing sneaky about billy. Fighting/steel maybe
---
Not sure why people downvoted all your comments lol, I enjoyed your deep husky voice 
---
If the Survivor is running an amazingly safe loop like the Disturbed Ward Asylum, the first Chase is generally long enough to secure nearly 3 generators, then when the Survivor DSs, the first chase is nullified and they can run the Killer for the last two generators. Given they also have Adrenaline, the Killer literally can't get a hook given these easily reproduceable circumstances.
---
You cannot complain about the game being unfair for Survivors after the nerfs if you play SEF on comms. That is more OP than a 4-blink Nurse.
---
And excuse me, nothing wrong with Urban Evasion. It is pretty helpful.
---
Got one hooked tunnelled and mori'd two games in a row by same sweaty killer. Fun time üòú
---
Can't wait for reset so I can start enjoying games again rather than the sweaty ball sack that is red rank back revving billy and slug fest nurses. 
---
'Teammates who know what they're doing'
---
LOL, nice one. Rank 1 is saturated with noobs. This ranking system is SO shit and I will just end up getting boosted killers who have been carried to rank 1 not by their skill, but by their Ruin + NOED combination.
---
only cowards juggle 
---
just take the stun and down the survivor again in 8 seconds like a man or a masculine woman or a wee little girl 
---
Yes, you put them into frenzy and follow them backwards. It will end the chase, and DW will start going down. Most killers who use this also use Frank's mix tape. There is no way to counter this if the killer does it.
---
I miss Darkest Moonlight on Kill Your Friends wtf
---
Why not just make her blinks silent?
---
You are fucking stupid if you think SWF is op. It's fucking DUO SWF. I am literally playing to have fun with my fucking friends you autist.
---
No joke, posting this on Reddit was a dumb thing to do, but I feel exactly the same way sometimes. You can get shitty team of survivors purple by bad luck multiple games in a row. When that happens to me, I literally do what you just said 
---
There was nothing I could have done to actually counterplay him. The only reason I lived is because he sucked at being a killer. 
---
Godammit, how come I've never thought of doing that! I always peek up Feng's skirt when I get hooked though, so at least I get to see that. Worth every minute spent trying to escape with the damn lamp :P
---
You cant make 1 sided posts on this sub. Too many feelings get hurt.
---
I never played with him before the buff so I don't know exactly what changed but his playstyle revolved around tunneling and screwing one specific survivor and I was that survivor. Like I said he really sucked so I actually never got downed and we survived all but one poor Kate Denson. I wouldn't even say he's strong but he is very good at making the survivor's lives miserable in a way that dosen't benefit either party 
---
Every survivor looking for a counter to legion; he sees no scratch marks and has slightly blurred vision in frenzy. Mind games are absolutely a must and very powerful. I escape almost every game against him. Mind games. Just try it.
---
Congrats on achieving what killers achieve every minute the time passes.
---
You can tell its not because his self care is tier 2
---
I was not meant for this realm. May the gods take pity on my soul. 
---
So, basically, you're telling me that just because I don't play the game the way you play it, I am a noob, even though you are the one who's scared of facing higher ranked killers and, instead, remains on lower ranks, ever though you have over 3k hours logged.
---
I see... ü§î
---
Can‚Äôt fucking see it, it‚Äôs so blurry
---
Happy cakeday
---
'just because i don't play the game the way you play it' 
---
yes because if you play stealthy then you are a noob... if youre stealthy then you're obviously not good in a chase which means that you're a noob because that's literally where all of the skill in this game is. and i've already made it clear that i play at low ranks because high ranks is fucking cancer full of noobs and NOED
---
Lol thank some people just haters
---
Amen
---
[Watch this i'm just gonna break the chase and walk away, break the chase and walk away.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jn2tC2XT-FU)

Also witb that skin, when you're hooked and entity summoned, turn the cam angle a bit low.
---
Literally same 
---
Self care bad perk change my mind 
---
He‚Äôs a lil cutie 
---
I always do that ;)
---
god that meme was so shit
---
Crouch while you're looking at them twice. That's it.
---
WAIT ARE YOU BEING SERIOUS? THERES 3 DAYS LEFT? YES YES YES YESSS!!!!!
---
Or, you know, I just have a different playstyle and have more fun being stealthy and unhooking people instead of just running the Killer around. To each their own. No need to be a dick to people just because they wanna play the game their own way.
---
It's more accurate really, haven't seen the term used much since one of my art books from the 00s though.
---
Looks like a normal legion game to me xD
---
you get game overs that quick and easy?? time to get lesion 
---
Clam down thotiana 
---
That hair lol it gives her off with BBQ too lol
---
He saw the offerings then disconnected
---
i mean you check all of the boxes for bein a noob...
---
-uses urban
---
-flexes about being rank 1
---
-plays spirit...
---
yup..
---
He has this technique where after he hits you, he can just walk backwards a bit and that'll pretty much guarantee you'll go down. You see, deep wounds only takes effect the moment you're out of chase, so when the Legion walks backwards a bit(it takes him out of the chase), he can then tail the hit survivor from afar and wait for them to go down. The survivor won't be able to mend, because the Legion can just run up to them and hit them again, then continue doing the same crap. So pretty much, if the Legion knows what he's doing, he can make your life in the match miserable...luckily, I haven't found many who even know about it in game.
---
I didn‚Äôt know in KYF you get all lvl 3 perks 
---
How about stop making people who play killers they like be punished for having fun???? Is this not a video game?!?!
---
LEGION BAD!!!!
---
2K upvotes, :big think:
---
And I thought I was a hoarder o o f
---
Your right to do so. What isn't a right of yours is telling people how to play the game and calling them "autistic" for not doing things like you do. It really shows that you're 15, with the behavior of a 12 year old. Please grow up, you're not ready for this game, or for life.
---
some dude recorded perks of 100 matches, out of 300 survivors 60% of them used self care.
---
The only good thing about F13. Since killers can talk to survivors in game their is a bond and it‚Äôs just banter. Here it‚Äôs just play ol MW 13 year old salt.
---
you me both...i am traumatised for life every time i see brown cows! 
---
well you are just salty and it's a fact :D too much sodium is bad for you, you should be careful darling

---
I just hate the sounds he makes. That half laugh half oink thing is so annoying. Plus there‚Äôs just something offputting about a killer that has the potential for instadowns. 
---

I don't get why people dc against doctor, he's crap

Man you are so dumb. I said IMAGINE someonw said that so Im not saying that I think it. Also why are you so bored to answer 1 mont old comment LOL. 
---
Weird I get way more salt when I play survivor 
---
Ootl, haven't played in a couple months. How did they break legion?
---
Yes, darling, I will be careful. Thank you for worrying about my health. I shall recommend you the same thing. If you want people to respect your playstyle, respect theirs too. I could just come here and say "Whoever isn't stealthy and doesn't draw the Killer's attention is autistic and noobish". In the end, if you're having fun, that's great, I'm really happy for you. But if you can have fun by playing with the Killer, why can't others have fun by being stealthy and remaining hidden? Don't be a bully. It's not gonna get you anywhere, and it's only gonna hurt other people.
---
Sounds terrifying, I actually have all these so definitely giving this a spin üëå
---
I mean what do you expect from a mentally challenged redneck man-child? I mean Myers or Billy don‚Äôt get nearly as much hate though.
---
I like that idea of removing the short miss cooldown and may I also propose that on miss, Feral frenzy is drained and ended?  Sounds like a decent step to legion counters.
---
Fun? Why not think of BOTH sides of this situation. MANY other killers give survivors some chance, Legion gives none. Tag and chase, mending simulator, tunnel, rinse and repeat. No skill. 
---
Do whatever the fuck you want to do, but stop posting your stupid DC's in order to get some "survivors are bad" reaction when you're a trash killer using NOED.
---
Git gud
---
No idea what this was, googled it, as a myers main. This physically and emotionally hurt me. üòÇüò≠
---
I really enjoy it on Doctor.
---
Distressing on Legion makes the TR ~30 metres which is still smaller than default TR
---
Too hot for Legion, maybe even the entity.
---
Time it? I had to use Doctor for the 500 electrocutes trophy &amp; he was the easiest character ever. Never ONCE had trouble timing ANY of my shocks.... üòÇ
---
Lol i hate bloodwebs too. I p3‚Äôd quentin and got selfcare for the first time at o3 lvl 45
---
You know, when I was around level 15, I played up against a 4 man swf with 4 Dwights who all looked identical, were all running ds/borrowed time/adrenaline, and were all very clearly deranking, considering how good they were. Guess what, I didn't dc. Why the fuck would I. I came from an MOBA background, so the thought of just casually dcing baffles me.
---
Fam timing means shock them before the pallet or window üòë
---
because getting punished for your teammates stupidity and not having a chance at survival isn't fun? it's also annoying to see the killer blatantly ignore the people farming their mates and then the farmer ends up getting the hatch with plenty of bloodpoints he got from farming his friends.
---
Annnnd, that‚Äôs not hard to do üòÇ
---
Good for you mate , I learnt it after playing him a whileüëå
---
&gt;New killers have been introduced before and the players adapted just fine.
---
I still see plenty of complaints from Survivors about Doc and Freddy, especially. Some adapt, the rest just complain.
---
I do agree it's easy to abuse Legion's power, but that's still not a guaranteed down. There are plays you can make, in the right conditions. And it still requires being hit. But some changes to remove the cheapness while buffing them slightly wouldn't be bad. I don't really play Legion anymore, despite the money I spent on cosmetics, because they're weak and, IMO, boring to use. But I think any worthwhile changes would require a full retooling, rather than just buffs and nerfs to stats.
---

Sprint burst + dead hard with no mither + self care

My first p3 was wraith. Followed by Myers and Freddy. Everyone else is p1, don't know in which order I get them to p1 tho.
---
Lol good moment
---
Don't mind me good sir I'll just hop right in front of your chainsaw
---
Fam it's hard ,when you see it in a video it seems easy but actually you have to predict thier timings when they're about to throw it or not and shock them I think 3 second before it ? Because I generally use the high stimulus electrode add-on and it takes time and sometimes this ‚ô•Ô∏ègame‚ô•Ô∏è cucks you by not showing the animation of being freezed before a pallet and they still throw it 
---
Smol billy.
---
This is exactly what I do. I don‚Äôt like using items while playing survivor so I wind up just hoarding everything. It‚Äôs a nice feeling.
---
HL isn‚Äôt a crutch, it‚Äôs just guarantee that he‚Äôs using unnerving, distressing and overcharged, which is a complete garbage way to play. The doctors power is already enough to lag the game and kill the frame rate
---
Nah. I love my killers, you just dont need skill anymore as killer, look at the graphics we got with the new engine update, complete and utter dogshit. New maps are terrible, events are shit, the list could go on
---
Wait. How the heck are lobbies THAT BAD?! I understand the frustration but honestly find ot kinda hard to care at this point. The second I point out things I consider 'bad manners' they either insult me, tell me to play better, or justify by saying I used 'bad manners' too. (I'm sorry you suck at hiding but if I find after you got unhooked and I haven't found anyone else I'm taking to another hook).
---
For your first x matches against Legion, sure, but there's a point you just can't take it anymore: if the Legion is not braindead, you're dead. If you can "juke" him, it just means he's so bad he'll probably struggle to do anything during the match, which is also not fun. As you said yourself, it's a game, if people don't feel like frustrating themselves bc of utterly stupid stuff the devs introduced into the game, I can't blame them.
---
Shouldn‚Äôt Legion be ??? Type because it breaks the game üòÜ
---
Absolutely agree. This is exactly how I feel about him. An uncounterable killer that is somehow still the weakest boy.
---
Lucky Julie :l
---
Hoenst question, were these immediate unhooks or were you proxy camping waiting for someone to come? 
---
You didn‚Äôt say how it went down, just that they were unhooked with you near.
---
Eh I normally do to but I was playing Cannibal (I hate the chainsaw but BBQ too good) I normally main Michael but I don't have BBQ on him yet and this dude was too good at looping for me want to chase him and since he wasn't doing I figured it'd make my life much easier that game.
---
Exactly. The only reason I can come up with is they just bought the license for the first movie.
---
Mostly because that survivor‚Äôs fun is ruined by no fault of their own. You‚Äôre also rewarding a survivor making a bad play. But mostly the first is the reason but play how you want, just  be ready to be flamed by the person you tunneled. 
---
First one I saw someone while picking up and waiting for them to step out for a chase. Second one I figured he was nearby and stepped like 10 feet away and IMMEDIATE unhook. Like first hook to death was 4 minutes or less.
---
Thanks dude. Guess I'm just gonna have to get used to it or turn off chat then huh?
---
Brb, I‚Äôm googling how to disconnect in real life
---
As a legion main i would do the same
---
I went into the flair options and clicked edit and changed the name of one of the flairs that were an option. üòÇ
---
Basically yeah, but I get more motivated to be a douchebag killer the more survivors diss my play style that I like 
---
Anecdotes are not a good statistic. You were better than the survivors. Congrats, give yourself a pat on the back. That doesn't mean Freddy isn't the weakest killer. It just means that you did better than the survivors.
---
Caboose: Church Did you miss me?
---
Church:*Shoots sniper rifle and misses* FUCK I MISSED HIM
---
Caboose: I MISSED YOU TOO!
---
For one know that you can't outrun the killer, they're all faster than the survivors. Some of the best advice I got from a rank one survivor was not to run everywhere. Crouch and sneak. Remember the killer can see hash marks when you run...so if you're not being chased there's no reason to run. Be stealthy! I've gotten alot better since I started doing that. Honestly practice and experience will help. Keep at it and you'll get so much better! 
---
Reasons why you say best:
---
1. Ace buddy
---
2. Dis post
---
I never got even close to as many messages in years of playing games on console as I have in this game. About half are complaints/insults and half are thanks for giving the hatch or having a good time. Most of the survivors actually seem normal, but the toxic encounters really down my mood sometimes.
---
Toolbox could have easily taken a hit.. 
---
Glad I'm not the only one to feel that way about some people in post game chat.
---
Honestly yeah. Most of them are the ones that are master loopers that you never see touch a gen either. Or if they do the moment they see you coming  they run TOWARD you or Tbag.
---
Thanks for your input!! I honestly might just turn it off and be done with it.
---
I personally thought the survivors weren't toxic, but very obviously new to the game. Like the killer judging by how they play and the perks. Then going to reddit and making a post about toxic players for le internet clout. I think that promotes a problem in the reddit, where new players can't really distinguish toxicity. I don't believe Rancor is a fair perk, because there are going to be a lot of matches I play at rank 1 with no decisive strikes, singling someone out because someone might be running a perk you don't like. That's not toxic, but it isn't a good thing to do either.
---
If they removed moonwalk he would be pretty bad tbh
---
Back to rank 20 you go. No more easy wins cause of a poorly designed event.
---
I feel you. 
---
Real killers gotta be Freddy though. Top tier. /s
---
Freddy op
---
Are we really posting 2012 memes this sub has gone to shit
---
Nurse should be legendary
---
Well shirtless Myers makes me wet he must be water ü§§
---
Epic gamer moment
---
I had difficulty getting the Nurse one, but it's oki cuz I also got the 3 blink pull achievment the same day :D. 
---
Also I would recommend doing the Adept achievment the day after if it's impossible to get it.  Trust me, it'll help you. 
---
Legion = DC's = The fastest way to get rank 1 w/o having to actually play the game.
---
The skins aren't shitty, which is actually such an issue. Like, I don't want to give BHVR more money until they fix their game--but then the skins are so cool :( 
---
A moba typically has way better balancing than DBD. People of various skill levels aren't just throw together like they are here.
---
This game has ranked for literally 0 reason now, anyone can be thrown against almost anyone and that is complete bullshit. Rank 1 people shouldn't be going up against normal players who are rank 10+ but they are...
---
As for me DCing... I just don't agree with this cheap ass tactic that can make matches drag on for like 40 minutes. Making me constantly scream, making myself sane, taking ages to do gens. Nah. This tactic is the only shit I DC against. I don't DC when I'm losing, if a teammate farms me or anything else. Just. This.
---
To fix this whole deranking mess they need to add rewards to ranked to encourage people to not derank. Then rank 1 players can go against people of their own skill level... This would fix a lot of issues, not everything, but a lot. It baffles me how they haven't done this already. There's no motivation for people to be rank 1, devs not adding rewards just encourages the shit they want to prevent. Changing matchmaking like they have just fucks it up for people who don't derank and play normally. The learning curve for an average rank 10+ player going against a rank 1 is so steep they may as well be falling off a cliff.
---
Do people actually run back there? I don't remember ever looping by going behind the shack, I always stay at the front with the window. I've also rarely seen a survivor go back there as killer. 
---
Laurie and David easily for survivor, as they have the only perks that are actively downsides. Sole Survivor at least lets you counter out OoO but you can't bring Iron Will or anything to reduce No Mither's impact.
---
On the killer side, Nurse just for her difficulty to learn and get a 4k, on top of the fact that Stridor/Thana have very little impact in a vast majority of games. Doctor because his perks have very little impact on being able to actually catch and kill people, and M&amp;A can be a disadvantage in most situations. Used to be Pig but since Surveillance got buffed she's in an *alright* spot, though MYC isn't exactly a brilliant perk due to her lower mobility.
---
My friend once called someone a failed abortion and got a comm ban
---
Welp looks like the sequel didnt continue sadly 
---
Shit I just skimmed over it that‚Äôs good as fuck
---
That was pretty ideal
---
Wouldn‚Äôt work would split player base 
---
No flashlights, cant be real claudettes 
---
how the hell does that even happen? does the game just go through every killer it can find, doesn't find one but finds one rank 19 killer and with no other options just goes through with it?
---
My eyes just fuckin die. I instinctively look a bit lower and just follow the scratches
---
300 hours of DBD, never seen this happen one single time vs leatherface.
---
This shit happens to me like every game, hahah. It's why I wish survivors (and killers on the other side) would just stop being dicks. You don't know who's on the other side.
---
Use blood shards 
---
It‚Äôs a great feeling when you save a stranger from a camping killer.
---
But..you can't know that. And that's once you're in the game. The killer gets the quitter bonus.
---
I‚Äôm either not buying it, or buying the whole dlc
---
people waste time healing when playing against her
---
she can injure everyone as quick as you heal so its a waste of time
---
but he cant handle the end game so the best counter to her is to ignore healing yourself and just get gens done as quickly as possible. 
---
now like a leather face's power makes them great at camping
---
the legions power makes him great at tunneling and you cant really get away from her if he decides she wants to tunnel you. since they only need to put you in deep wound status and then look down at the scratch marks 
---
since they are staring at the scratch marks to follow you it doesnt count as being in a chase so the deep wound status keeps going down and if you stop to heal legion will catch up and down you making it impossible to avoid getting downed no matter what you do
---
Nah. Already takes too long to find matches.
---
It‚Äôs true, they‚Äôre in disguise 
---
Honestly feels good to do this especially when I‚Äôve been in similar situations and got left for dead
---
Nah me and my friend were playing on randoms. I can‚Äôt use flashlight (because I am trash) and my friend has none
---
You could start by not mori‚Äôd them?
---
I can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt patched this yet
---
Plunderes instinct? 
---
If it was your last chance where you would've been struggled if you hadn't of popped off then yeah its suppose to happen
---
Feng Min is the only high tier goddess anyway, God I wish shed drop a pallet on my face 
---
Well maybe at least the penalties for leaving so damn much
---
As pig :(
---
Spirit thicc af though??
---
As a survivor main I wouldn‚Äôt want to go against this so get those 4 mans boii !!!! 
---
Aftercare, in my opinion, is better then bond. Breakdown can be fun on sabo builds, distortions not that good  because you can just get in a locker. Iron Maiden is good on doctor and especially huntress. Mad grit is meh, as it‚Äôs a counter to body blocking, and distortion is really good on certain killers(spirit, hag, hillbilly, huntress, and nurse. Micheal too so he can know where to stalk. The survivor has a good metal outfit but a bad prestige as it has little to no blood. The legions prestige looks good. The legion is weak, and almost everyone,including myself, hates playing against a legion because it‚Äôs so boring, but he is a bp machine.
---
No sympathy for face campers üòÇ
---
"Dwight, you ignorant slut"
---
Finally someone says it
---
Can‚Äôt see anything, but gets a lucky hit sprinting through the corn
---
 Well I have been getting 3 mans / 4 mans recently with this build at rank 4.
---
Kate in rotten fields is harder to see than a p3 Claudette
---
If u play a lot yes cause it is true u get better items (more higher rarity shows up)
---
I only prestiged to get the trophies.
---
The hardest adept achievement would be Myers as his perks counter act each other. One want to kill the obsession, two want you too leave the obsession alone.
---
So what does distortion do?
---
Hahahahaha I use it when I'm bored
---
It‚Äôs because people go into lockers so they don‚Äôt screen, so he can check lockers without wasting much time.
---
That moment when a rank 16 killer moria an entire red rank swf üòé
---
Whatever floats your boat I guess
---
This happens to me killer/survivor late at night with 20 min wait que
---
That‚Äôs the only reason I get upset 
---
If you didn't see them go into the locker and if there's no tracks leading to the locker then why waste time opening the locker to begin with? 
---
Iron maiden is a mediocre perk at best and is quite a waste of a perk slot. Even on huntress it doesn't save that much time and you would be better off running a better perk. 
---
I actually had a lot of fun with a 2 man game. I gave them max hooks, they got to one gen left, and last man standing got hatch. They had no interest in farming and were try harding.
---
Distortion starts with 3 tokens, each time  a aura perk for the killer starts one token is taken and you are not shown by the perk. For example they can‚Äôt see you with BBQ
---
Nope you will use the perks for a little bit till you realize your original build was better
---
HONESTLY
---
Ace is dabbing
---
Correct
---
??? How you usually slug the second to last person to give you time to find the last one 
---
Angry dr Phil?
---
Exactly 
---
Exactly what I was thinking but she could've done q better job of camping than that.
---
"usually when another survivor is in a chase, i can twiddle my thumbs and open chests, but legion forces me to actually play the objective, fucking boring-ass killer"
---
I came in here and literally every single comment is at 0, what asshat is downvoting this positivity
---
It's so good!!! I absolutely love it, good job!!
---
At least it's consistently inconsistent for both survivor and killer lmao.
---
Usually when I start walking away the other survivor sneaks up and heals the other one and they both escape.
---
Nah old(er) cartoon on adult swim. I think it was called Aqua Hunger Team Force. Has a meatball some cup and that old guy.
---
How are the panty shots on the new cosmetics bad I find them unique 
---
Hahhahahah
---
Surely not thicc.
---
Your objective as Freddy is to keep everyone asleep. If they fail a skillcheck they wake up. In fact, the first thing you jave to do to counter a Freddy is fail a skillcheck as soon as possible. Thats why Overcharge Freddy is a meme build.
---
You mean ignoring an actual game mechanic to follow some arbitrary "good manners rulebook"?
---
If you already think purple rank killers are sweaty then your gonna love most red rank matches :D.   I miss goofing around in purple...
---
Shit is valve doing the arg for portal 3 already
---
Gates were open my guy
---
Because it's not really their fault for their dumb teammate doing something stupid like that. I always go for the one who unhooks them if I'm close enough to have seen them do it. Cause when I play survivor and this happens to me... It's bullshit, you get punished for your teammate being an idiot. Unless they have borrowed time they shouldn't be pulling this shit.
---
Usually, I'm not around when someone is unhooked. I just hook people and brgin to patrol gens like normal, applying pressure to gens and keeping survivors busy is more fun to me than staying around hooks like other killers do. 
---
We all play differently. I just think killers who play survivor just know how sucky it is, we might take pity sometimes. Idk. I like punishing the idiot instead of the annoyed victim. Cause it's insanely annoying being farmed, and many people farm teammates on purpose which is also a dick move.
---
happy cake Day
---
if you dont like doing gens then why are you playing survivor? that's literally the objective of the game. if you don't enjoy the mechanics of the game's main objective, then sorry, but that guy has a point, maybe find a different game

It gives +hunting points which is why I mentioned it with distressing (+devious points).
---
Sounds justified.
---
Yeah and it feels horrible when you have to leave someone struggling on the hook. 
---
Its supposed to represent the Entity and the killer's red stain
---
Good thing I have all non-friend communications disabled.
---
Surprised they bothered to give her anything that resembled underwear and it's not just a fully clothed bottom from the mid-thigh up.
---
Is that Pig crouching and staring at you at the left?
---
I like this
---
And you're sitting there looking foolish with a whole paragraph you can't post
---
Great film.
---
I'm the same way! Sometimes I take the best ones and give them to other survivors who don't have an item aga just hope they save my sorry ass when the time comes üòÇ
---
Sometimes it‚Äôs pretty obvious the killer is way above rank than the survivors like the case in this picture. The killer doesn‚Äôt have to, but the OP asked how not to be an asshole to more new players. He/she could start by not mori‚Äôing them. 
---
***N O I C E***
---
Yea I never really watched it much. Didn‚Äôt watch family guy either. I like futurama but even that I haven‚Äôt watched much
---
same for pig and mirror myers, stealth killers are amazing in corn fields because not seeing shit goes both ways on this map, it just usually is better for survivors as they are smaller and have 3rd person view
---
i get that, but other than generators, everything you mentioned is an action to counter the killer from trying to stop you doing gens. if he doesn't try to stop you then you don't have to counter him stopping you, just do the objective, get out, and play a new match. basement camping leatherface isnt all that common.
---
You think that's a big butt? Man, you need more internet...
---
"bunch of pussies about it. If you say anything, and I mean ANYTHING, that can be construed as harassment, then you can expect to be reported and quite likely comms banned."
---
Is it really that hard to play the game without being a fucking asshole, though? It seems easily avoidable. 
---
You‚Äôre missing the ‚Äúshitpost‚Äù flair, bud.
---
My childhood consisted mostly of old video games and friends. I would have those shows on but never watched them.
---
Since I have college and a part time job I've only gotten maybe 8 hours of gameplay this entire event but I've gotten my third coin almost so I'm happy. All I want is the huntress items not really a Ace fan and the Feng one is nice and all but I can live without it. Way to bright for my liking. 
---
pig is actually great on this map, free ambush hits
---
Thank you for that, kind stranger.
---
Thanks! I'm enjoying every second of waiting and every upvote!
---
I feel so bad for you lmfao
---
Interesting indeed. Before, all skirts had shorts underneath. Wonder why they decided to go for "underwear".
---
he isn't bad he just is the worst.
---
My hard drive recently died in my PS4. I replaced it and got dbd reinstalled but everything except ‚Äúhelp and tutorials‚Äù is locked. I‚Äôve tried renewing my licenses and restarting. I‚Äôve heard that it might be because the game isn‚Äôt fully downloaded yet but it‚Äôs been sitting for at least 5 to 6 hours AFTER having finished downloading and installing. So I can‚Äôt imagine it‚Äôs STILL downloading stuff. Any suggestions???
---
that ending was perfect honestly
---
Not even gonna tell your subs on youtube about the new channel :O  
---
Fuck man, I'm just happy those videos are out.
---
who is being hard on them here (but agreed) 
---
In my experience, purple is generally more sweaty killer wise. (Never been past 11 killer side, I stay survivor.) I play with friends, and holy lord when we get purple killers it's just far more likely that they'll be slugging, ebony, ruin, with top tier addons for their particular killer. It's like they really REALLY care about getting to rank one. Once in red ranks, we seem to get a decent mix of folks who just dick around and have fun, with those who are super sweaty and only care about their precious 4k.
---
That sounds flat to me. 
---
Come on man. Think of the flatties we have. The Hag. Feng Min (unless you think Fengy's thicc). Maybe Amanda. But that's all.
---
You *thiccsters* got Kate, Anna, Bubba, Clown... Y'all full of people. Let us have the Spirit, please. Have mercy on us. I dont wanna have to worship the Hag for the rest of my days.
---
Believe me I understand I‚Äôve played both sides on this game and when the gates are open and there‚Äôs no gens well sorry bud I‚Äôve got literally no reason to leave
---
i constantly get the two mixed up because i only play r6 and dbd
---
Mine was oldish video games friends occasionally and more often local gaming with siblings.
---
Got nothing against people who face camp after the doors are open. like what else are they gonna do leave and lose the kill? 
---
Oh man, I love these, don't know if you've done more, but I've seen this one and the trapper one, and I love the continuity of the last panel with the survivor on the hook going "Darn" XD
---
Poison/Fairy lol
---
short answer to this is that the survivors saying this have around the same hours as you and don't really realise what they're saying is wrong / illogical. generally the experienced players don't care
---
Not true mate sorry, like some killers are objectively worse.
---
Presumably cause he's so colorful.
---
I'm sure I'm not the only one who had this be [the first thing they tested](https://i.imgur.com/kRyJxOb.jpg) with the new outfit and their piggy powers
---
yeah. over 1000 hours here. always say "gg wp &lt;3" regardless of the game's outcome. y'all just care too much, chill. 
---
Wait Freddy is in this game?
---
I just want to add I‚Äôm not salty over it I‚Äôm just playing for fun so I‚Äôm not really bothered about rank.
---
she was trying to flashlight save
---
Theres no way Freddy is worse than a killer like Leatherface or clown. He has so much to work with compared to those two killers (as an example).
---
K
---
I agree with this post completely. Finally someone who actually sees through the ‚Äòstandards‚Äô set out by the community/big streamers and someone who isn‚Äôt afraid to have and voice their own opinion. A lot of people don‚Äôt know how to effectively play him and utilise his power well, and therefore they jump to conclusions and say ‚Äúoh no he‚Äôs a bad killer‚Äù because he is very different from the rest of the killers.
---
Even the killer is disappointed in you for failing the skillcheck.
---
give Kate a skirt please
---
*muffled initial d music playing as is chainsaw Sprint thru the cornfield*
---
Yeah tru3talent sadly falls into this category lmao. I'm assuming that you think Pig is better, I'm curious about who else you think is better than Freddy that I listed. 
---
It‚Äôs always satisfying to beat face camping 
---
What's interesting is that i live in red ranks and i die about 4/5 of my games.  Every single game is a smurf killer just shitting all over me and my team.  Killers complain constantly about survivors, but if I die 80% of my games and just get owned, shouldn't I be complaining about balance in the other direction?
---
When I get a kill effectively robbed from me when everybody is running to the gates, I have an asleep and injured Bill in front of me, I go to swipe, and my swipe auto-aims into an awake survivor so all the survivors run out the door like nothing happened, and when I down my obsession and two awake people come up and start healing her, and I can literally do nothing about it except put those two people to sleep and hope they fall asleep before they get her up, I'm reminded that yes, Freddy is the worst killer in the game. He's so extremely easily abusable, and he can literally do nothing about it. Same goes for gens, heals, doors, etc., popping in his face during the dream transition, and having absolutely nothing for the chase built into his base kit.
---
Carl!
---
Main issue I have with Freddy is that survivors can wake up from dream with adrenaline. 
---
THANK YOU. I agree completely with your point about the streamers, I see so many of them using double blocks and tunneling one guy then complaining he's trash. People just don't want to adapt and change their playstyle.
---
Who said anything about earning BP only in high-ranked matches? Read my post again.
---
No. Quentin wont let Quentin sleep.
---
I'm not sure if he's the hardest, but Freddy's definitely up there. You're effectively working with no perks at the beginning of the match, and only one perk towards the middle of the match that barely does anything as is until the end. Then you finally get two more perks that kick in, like "oops, I'm about to lose, better hurry up and fix my mistake". 
---
I wouldnt label yourself as such honestly.
---
I main Freddy and the Spirit, both of which are different from the regular killers and I had to adapt my playstyle massively in order to become good at both of them, and now I consistently 4k at Rank 1. With Freddy, I am confident enough in my own skill whilst playing as him to go in addonless and sometimes - when I‚Äôm feeling extra daring - perkless. He really isn‚Äôt a bad killer and it‚Äôs frustrating when people say that he is.
---
I can totally understand about the points you are making, that is Freddys biggest weakness. It doesn't break him and make him the worst, but it does suck whenever it happens. The only buff Freddy needs to for zero progression on anything in the dream transition (and maybe an increased base range on the power) Your point about Freddy having nothing in the chase doesn't really matter for Freddy, he does't need something for the chase. He can get free hits off the transition and due to how short he is and how foggy the Dream world is he's got great m1 mindgames. 
---
While I don't personally agree that he is better than some of the killers you said, freddy is very underrated. He isn't nurse tier, but people don't know how to play him well, making people assume that his ability is bad. He isn't meta, he has a unique play style that a lot of people won't find attractive, and so they just call him bad. He gets destroyed by the usual god tier swf team as every other killer can be (except god nurse), but he isnt trash and I personally think leatherface is lower than him because his insta down is useless against actual good players who don't run in open fields, and downing groups only happens against unaware survivors, and witbout addons his chainsaw takes too long to charge (and his other addons that dont add charge time just seem terrible).
---
*Explains why you may be the type to say "GGEZ" if you escape...js*
---
I believe freddy is a bad killer because his power is more of a hinderance than helpful
---
He is the only killer where you have to wait to hit somebody once you find them (Wraith has this too but its much less of a waiting time that freddy) 
---
If someone isn‚Äôt already slept when going for a unhook you pretty much can‚Äôt farm someone against a freddy (Unless you invest in a fast sleep but your then not able to keep people slept for as long with the dress addons)
---
His power is to slow the game down (nobody dare say that damn line) but is much weaker in my opinion than other killers based around similar ideas
---
Pig: Takes a long time to remove but you have a limited amount of traps (+ survivors can‚Äôt leave threw gates with them
---
Legion: Fast to apply and annoying to have to mend a lot (and heal too, especially with self care)
---
Doc: Doesn‚Äôt take long to snap out of it but less skilled survivors may not be able to hit consecutive madness skills (also is very good at finding people if played correctly)
---
Freddy: Takes time to sleep people if you want to use dress addons to keep people slept or less time to sleep in exchange for no dresses, 
---
Feel free to share your opinions tho
---
Best meme
---
I miss vine :,(
---
Thing is you never get found tho. Can‚Äôt see shit in the corn fields
---
Freddy is a good killer, got me to rank the red ranks.
---
I just don‚Äôt like some of his add-ons like the one where it tremendously increases your speed during dream transition. It messes up my tactics.
---
Nah I never leave the corn
---
Survivors should make killers tilt, and killers should make survivors tilt.
---
We just need to step out of the role we played once we get to the end game chat.

No matter how insulting the result, or the chat you receive, you should always try to point out good plays and teamwork.

This is a drawing I did for the huntress using line work, this being one of my first drawings in 7 months, I say I did pretty good, the original picture that I drew from is from this link:https://www.deviantart.com/shaunanarchy/art/The-Huntress-Mask-759155535

It's usually good at first but then nothing is chronological, and you're sat there searching for everything. Or you end up like me and [can't be arsed doing it anymore.](https://prnt.sc/mj0mz4)

I don‚Äôt mind swf. I do mind when 3+ survivors are in P3 Claudette form.
---
ü§îü§îü§î
---
If the survivors aren't brainlets Bubba will never down more than one of them, and Leatherface has no antiloop potential whatsoever. He slows himself down when revving and you have to be breathing down their necks to be able to land a hit AND pray there are no pallets or windows nearby.
---
Clown is a TERRIBLE killer. Sure he counters loops, but survivors can just sit at the pallet, throw it down, then his power does nothing. He slows himself down whenever he throws a bottle, barely gets anything out of it, and then after 4 shots has to go to slower than survivor walking speed to be able to reload. Clowns power doesnt even do anything against windows anymore, due to the medium vault changes. You could argue that if the survivor camps pallets then they will all be gone quickly, but the thing is, if the survivor leads the clown to all of the 15 or more pallets on the map and breaks them all, the gens will be done and the survivor can adrenaline away. The survivor can even start looping once the Clown has wasted all 4 of his bottles, because if he reloads then the survivor has won the chase. He is no where near the best killer in chases, Nurse, Hag and many other killer beat him out by a long shot. Clown is terrible, possibly the worst killer in the game, Freddy beats him out by a long shot. 
---
Dayum. 
---
OH MY GOD REALLY?! That would be insane!
---
Yeah Huntress is one of the most map dependant killers. Almost no maps are good for her sadly.
---
Piggy is my favourite killer &amp; im a big fan of saw. Great art, and good to see her getting some love ‚ô•Ô∏è 
---
Mineta killer that gets 50% speed boost when tunneling female survivors
---
GG
---
(Also the last place I‚Äôd expect to find MHA content but I‚Äôm cool with it)
---
Not bad. Brutal is the weakest perk but still good. If you really want to mess with survivors huntress lullaby is fun to. 
---
I know it has nothing to do with him specifically...
---
But 13/10 gg. 
---
What would I replace with Huntress's lullaby?
---
Ah I see thanks for getting back to me, yeah it could be that. One game was a legion so we won‚Äôt wonder why that happened lol.
---
Better than trapper and doctor and legion yeah I'll go for it, but clown pig and leatherface? I cant. Clown is the one killer I will really argue is better than almost everyone (nurse excluded) due to his addons. 
---
boys will be boys
---
the connection and how much the game stutters is completely dependent on the internet quality of the killer
---
For the perks? No. If you want to play legion / have a gruff mountain man,  then yes.    
---
I personally find legion the most enjoyable to play. But I *

fucking *hate* Benny Hill chases. He feels so fast and mobile.

But he isn't for everyone. You'll have to decide he's right for you.

I‚Äôm confused about this too because it says if we are looking in each other‚Äôs direction, we will see each other but more often than not, when I‚Äôm watching the killer‚Äôs aura, their back is turned and I don‚Äôt understand how it activated.
---
Same thing with me haha 
---
Lol I‚Äôve never had that yet but sounds annoying. Just wait it out he will DC eventually.
---
I've seen some thing I shouldn't have seen 
---
For the perks? No. If you want to play legion / gruff mountain man,  then yes.    
---
I personally find legion the most enjoyable killer to play. But only because he counters survivor meta perks (exhaustion perks and self care) and chases are actual chases instead of Benny Hill skits. His actual power of average though. 
---
But he isn't for everyone. You'll have to decide he's right for you
---
He just did. Lol. If it hadn‚Äôt of been a legion, I would have let him have it. 
---
This thread is certainly something.
---
As long as you‚Äôre range and looking at the direction the killer is in both of your auras are revealed to each other, meaning you both can see each other until you look away from the killer. 
---
Best thing you'll see on Reddit today.
---
the real tragedy is that you're playing on console
---
Half the survivors i see running object of obsession at rank 1 are rubbish in chases
---
Does this new meta work with other seafood?
---
Freddy is weak but very fun to play
---
I'm a killer at rank 7 right now... The promise of survivors  in red ranks who suicide on first hook &amp; hook dive without BT are the only thing that keeps me going.
---
Tik Tok is the bastard knock off. It has some Vine references too. 
---
One of the best Vines, honestly. Underrated vine for sure. 
---
If i see squadettes or more than 2 toolboxes ill leave and find a new game. I dont leave for SWF tho
---
Their Emblem farming capacity is entirely unrelated to if they're OP or not. You can easily pip without ever getting a single kill, or even hooking someone more than once. Emblem progress and rank are absolutely irrelevant.
---
now I'm imagining the Killers as villains in the show
---
Wraith fits pretty well, to be honest. Surprisingly well. 
---
Amanda slightly less so, only being salvaged by the traps and her connection to John Kramer. 
---
The chainsaw boys don't exactly fit, nor does Trapper, as their powers aren't something that could be made into a quirk, they're just weapons. 
---
Myers fits in an all right manner, I guess, but I don't see him as the big bad in a show like MHA, more like a henchman, but if you've seen the movies, you know he's very obviously superhuman, enough to be a significant threat because of the fact that he just won't die. 
---
Hag has her quirk made for her, but somehow I don't see her being a villain in the show. I don't know why.
---
Spirit doesn't fit too well as a literal ghost, as the series doesn't have very many paranormal aspects to it, at least not with where I am in the series.
---
Huntress and Clown could both fit somewhat nicely into the series, even though their "powers" are both just weapons. I could see Clown in particular fitting in very well, as either a large-scale criminal mastermind or just as a jobber for someone higher up the chain of command. 
---
Nurse could work just fine, even if her quirk would be pretty simple, although I would see her being a more sympathetic villain than most. 
---
Doctor would fit into the series extremely snug-like. He's got the quirk, the backstory, the intimidation factor, the intellect, all of it. 
---
Freddy falls into the same category of Spirit as being undead, but if he wasn't dead and his quirk was just being able to enter dreams and kill people in them, I could see him being a very impactful villain simply by virtue of how dangerous he would be. 
---
Legion would fit in well if their power wasn't so lame. Maybe make them moderately superhuman in nature, combined with a eusocial hive mind-type thing, and you could have a cool villain. As they stand, not a lot potential. 
---
Killers will camp anyone though. Sometimes it's just their tactic 
---
^(click clicky click click clicky)
---
This sums up every match for me at rank 1 
---
Killer finds Survivor somewhere else in the map &gt; Frames freeze for a second &gt; Exact same second the skill check pops up. Happens to me too often.
---
If you're using all 4 bottles before you can end 1 chase, something's wrong
---
&gt;good tips someone else gave
---
Yeah like ‚Äúhes short so uh...bring a coldwind offering‚Äù...when you dont know what killer you‚Äôre facing. AMAZING COUNTERPLAY HERE FOLKS
---
who you calling boy my names handbannna
---
I hate Legion and anyway who plays them tbh
---
I've been running Ruin, BBQ, M&amp;A, and NOED on my Spirit. NOED makes me feel scummy, but I don't have anything better at the moment *shrug*
---
Imma say this now, Never feel scummy about using noed, if survs use ds, we can use noed.
---
It's not opinion ... It's what happens in 80% of my games in red ranks.
---
You aren't wrong. lol
---
***Unhooking noises***
---
Yummy 
---
This looks like the beginning of a Smash victory animation
---
Hoffman was the only 1 that actually killed someone with the bear trap btw.
---
I'm survivor main and although I hate getting tunneled hard if a team mate farms me and I decide to stay I yell at my teammate not the killer. Honestly even if a killer camps me I don't really get mad anymore. I play Ace and if he can smile while getting a hook through the back I can smile while getting tunneled on a vidya game
---
moom
---
Brutal. I use lullaby as a just in case they find my ruin first. But like I said it‚Äôs more of a messing with their heads. Your build is solid as is. If you ever switched anything brutal would be the first choice of perk to drop. Personally I‚Äôd go stridor or sloppy butcher over brutal and lullaby 
---
Damn you got me there
---
Or I can play and dc vs legion 
---
I TOO FEEL THIS PAIN
---
TOO RELATABLE
---
It‚Äôs in the game you paid for play anyway with any perks you bought. Personally noed doesn‚Äôt bother me because I love 500 free blood points for cleansing a totem
---
OMG IS THAT A FELLOW HUNTRESS MAIN OWO
---
Freddy is bad because if survivors aren't total idiots it's nearly impossible for Freddy to get more than 2 kills.
---
The problem with Freddy is that he isn't fun to play against as a solo player, because everything about him is designed to make sure that one person is unable to play the game.  You literally can't lose him in a chase if he doesn't want to just give up, and his being bad makes it actually necessary to camp/tunnel the first person he hooks if he wants to get kills.
---
Most importantly, it's not just a case of re-balancing.  If you simply make him stronger, then he becomes broken and even less fun to play against (because you need to be able to actually win).  If you simply make him worse, then we see the same problem in the other direction (while making it basically guaranteed that the one person he catches first will be camped and tunelled).
---
To fix him you have to alter how he works.
---
Legion is similar in that he has a hard time stopping all of the survivors, but is basically impossible for any single survivor to do anything against.  Re-balancing won't be enough, because it will make things too toxic in one direction or the other.  Something needs to be changed about how he works.
---
Or don't ruin dbd for EVERYONE ELSE
---
THATS WHAT SHE GETS FOR BEING TOXIC
---
Really proves you aren't insecure when you slam that "Leave match" button 1/4 of a second after typing some lame unoriginal insult. Love killers that do that. Especially since they're the campy-tunnely type about 90% of the time.
---
make jukes more viable? On Ps4 its easy enough to juke him as it is.
---
When you look at the killer outside of its terror radius, their aura is revealed to you. Your aura is revealed to them too
---
I take it as a personal insult if I‚Äôm not camper or moried 
---
The problem being Legion breaks *everything* survivors have. You can‚Äôt: stealth, escape, loop, mind game, or do anything except hold sprint and then wait for you to go down because you can‚Äôt do anything about it. It also takes forever because A: you move at 110%, taking forever to catch up to survivors to injure or down them. B: they use their power and you can‚Äôt do anything to avoid them because they move fast enough to null mind game potential and can vault palettes and windows, but they have to hit you several times. Also off topic kind of. Trapper doesn‚Äôt innately break game mechanics with his power. He can just make it so that you get caught when you run into a trap which can be placed by windows/ palettes.
---
Same but only brown medkits. Saving all green meds for "real games", whatever that means.
---
What mind games though? Mind games is a hella broad term
---
new tech??
---
TOO BAD ITS PRETTY WELL BALANCED
---
And then you secretly avoid doing the same gen as them the rest of the game xD
---
The Entity is MissingNo
---
Ofc that‚Äôs a thing
---
"Will never play" is just gag-gifts such as Bad Rats and Ricochet, horror games (I can't stand them) or shitty little cheap titles. DBD is heart.
---
I really don't see how, considering the second worst, Wraith, doesn't have a power that actively prevents him from defending gens/totems/doors, while allowing him to chase just as well as freddy.
---
He is the worst killer in the game and hasn‚Äôt been fixed or change in a very long time. This is why he‚Äôs laughed at as a killer, though he is no where near as bad as some would make you think he is pretty well inarguably the worst killer in the game at high levels of play.
---
There‚Äôs only a few bad maps for her... she has more ‚Äògood‚Äô maps than most of the roster. 
---
Against legion. 
---
Don't you vent your frustrations by firing wildly into the air?
---
If you really want to take addons into consideration, he‚Äôs worse than a lot of the killers. 
---
Spirit has good snowball and map pressue id reccomend you to drop ruin 
---
Sounds like you need a new friend 
---
He's bad, and also unfun, and his ability is uncounterable.
---
Pig is undoubtedly not on Freddy‚Äôs level.... 
---
her power has a lot more utility and her only big downside is her movement speed. 
---
Leatherface, while not being great, is a lot better than a killer that is more RNG dependant than WoW‚Äôs drop rates.
---
Yeah.. say that to the 4k swf groups then, 3 usually rank 2-1. Yes he is a shit killer I'll say that but people take him as a joke and get fucked because of that. Groups that love running to the hook as a 3 man team to save 1 person? Yup all hooked in the basement. The list goes on but people underestimate him and make mistakes because of it whereas freddy is a gnat that is annoying at best 
---
Tagging multiple people and dream world auras hardly matter when I wake up in three seconds due to self care or a gen, and the other three things are killer mechanics that are not specific to Freddy.
---
A bit out of season but I only just noticed this and I'm amazed I didn't see it sooner.
---
**ALL** of Clown's knives have names. Every single one.  
---
**EXCEPT** the letter opener from the Santa set.
---
Really? Is it that hard to give it a name? "Stab-a Claus"? "Santa Cut"? Or ignoring awful puns "Merry Mary"? "Festive Francis"? Heck you could've even named it "Tiny Tim" and it would've fit quite well since the blade is so slender.
---
Clown mains are petty crybabies and this is the pettiest of the petty I could complain about.
---
Well before he was buffed he was not fun to play against, but he was trash so it didn't really matter. Once he was buffed, it became just not fun to play against, especially if they're using frank's mixtape, you may as well give up if they have that.
---
Wraith post-buff, isn‚Äôt that bad. For sure above trapper and leatherface when considering high levels of play. 
---
People don't complain that he's strong or OP or anything along those lines.  They complain that there's literally nothing a survivor can do to counter him due to how his ability is designed, that's not something that changed from his release to today.
---
Not at all. Huntress's only good maps are autohaven ones. All others are either too enclosed, have too many trees, too many LOS blockers, or are coldwind.
---
Not at all lmao, many killers are worse than him.
---
I see Slay the Spire, but it's not installed. :/
---
^
---
Yeah no problem https://discord.gg/J9KbgP
---
P.S. The default knife is the only "female" knife that Clown has. (Madame Butterfly and Madame Bloodfly.) In addition the yellow knife with the plad handle is the only knife that's a "doctor."
---
It's the little things that keep me up at night.
---
Freddy‚Äôs negatives outweigh the benefits he receives from his power. Wraiths do not. 
---
Leatherfaces power has a lot more utility and a much higher skill cap than most people seem to think. It isn‚Äôt as brain dead simple as being close to a survivor, there are numerous mindgames involving his power and sometimes they can lead to an instadown via chainsaw. 
---
why are you screaming
---
Clown is terrible at higher ranks dude, his power doesnt do anything. Hes one of the worst, if not the worst killer in the game. I wrote an explanation as to why so below somewhere.
---
This guy fucking gets it.
---
No killers are great on Rotten Fields, it's the most survivor sided map in the game statistically. 
---
Wanna give some examples? Cause from console perspective nurse is unusable to the point unlike on PC, hill billy cant turn like on PC, spirit stays the same (that was the almost everyone part) and legion is just.. needs a fix 
---
I reckon its the best perk IMO just because of the fact that survivors can gen rush injured with zero consequence.
---
found the actual unironic legion main

*ANGRY HUNTRESS TANTRUM NOISES *
---
I never said you couldn't play on those maps, I just said that they aren't good for her?? Just because people can 4K on Rotten Fields as Nurse doesn't mean its a good map for her.
---
Yeah I'm not telling it's a bad thing, I just like running from the killer and trying to "trick" them.
---
The toxicity of each side exists just to make the enemy angry. That's the worst part of dbd
---
Dc'ing from a game where the doctors just going to guard 3 gens for half an hour for 10.000 bloodpoints and a black pip doesn't seem to unreasonable to me. Especially when one of your team mates already has. I'd be more against dc'ing if this game wasn't only ranked mode, and if ranked actually put you in games with people of your skill level. Or if the game was remotely balanced.
---
Do you even play clown... the reasons you listed are well... trash which leads me to believe you aren't that great of a killer, there are addons that cause exhaustion, as well as hindered (reduces movement speed) you also shouldn't ever have to reload during a chase. Two bottles should be plenty for a chase especially with the exhaustion addon as that negates, sprint burst, dead hard and balanced landing. The hindered addon is just extra at that point
---
Trapper has to spend valuable time finding and placing his traps, and the traps hitbox is so poor that most of the time the survivor can just run right past it.
---
Leatherface has no power unless the survivors are brainlets.
---
Unless he has Franks, it takes ages for legion to down someone, and he has no map pressure due to 110%
---
I don't even want to argue with you about Clown has he seem not to get why he is so terrible.
---
I hear the ladies love this technique when used with a sea cucumber
---
Get good at following scratch marks first.
---
Doesn't matter when they can just camp the pallet ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø. Try going against a good team playing clown.
---
Legit just make him not be able to jump pallets
---
Yeah, the running joke is always gonna be the surv on the hook at the end. 
---
Usually it's rushing to unhook too quickly before the killer even has a chance to leave, or unhooking mid chase.  There are multiple scenarios that could cause it but it all results in unsafe unhooks and giving the killer a free hook immediately, usually on the person freshly unhooked.  
---
When it comes to the reduced missed attack cooldown it isn't that good of an option for survivors to 360 because the legion will just recover from it almost instantly and can just try again.
---
I'm nearing 3,000 and I see it probably roughly every couple of weeks.
---
I mean its pretty rare to find females that enjoy penetrating others, amirite?
---
I recommend watching players like tru3talent etc... when I first started I learned a lot just by watching people play, it‚Äôs good to see both perspectives as well, just to know what survivors see and how to you see the game. It‚Äôs just the small things you pick up that make the overall experience better as you go.
---
If you press the arrow keys now, it will interrupt healing.  Could potentially be it, it was around in the early days of the game and it was recently restored.
---
Survivor reviews don‚Äôt really matter unless you‚Äôre talking about their teachables. Otherwise, they‚Äôre all just skins. Killer reviews are just tier lists imo and I see those all over the internet. However, if you want to do this, go right ahead. Who am I to stop you from doing this.
---
Alright
---
Yea, any news on FPS updates for ps4
---
As I wrote elsewhere in the thread, any of those things you mention simply elevate him to what a good player can already do with any killer in the game. My effort with him is the same effort I put into any game: Adapt to every situation and try to get 2 or more kills with multiple hooks for every survivor. So I mainly utilize Monitor and BBQ for aggressive gameplay, sometimes Enduring, MYC, or Discordance. Sometimes I'll sleep all targets on a gen first. Sometimes if I see easy prey, I'll go for 'em instead. I shy away from stall builds on any killer, because the Ruin, Sloppy, Thanatty meta is just not enjoyable for me. If they work for you on Freddy better than other killers, you do you man. Win or lose, I like my matches to be over succinctly. I have varying results with my Freddy builds, a fair share of 3-4Ks mainly, get trounced every now and then too. But I don't feel like I have any more control over the game than when I play any other killer.
---
"Tagging" multiple survivors at once to slow the game is something Legion can arguably do better (though they suffer the same problem as Fred when it comes to finishing the job in a chase). Either way, it's a horribly inefficient way to play at high ranks, even now that healing has been nerfed.
---
Not sure what you mean by "Perks". His perks? They are all average at best. Blood Warden is fun for endgame memes. If you mean combo-ing perks that have synergy with his power, there really aren't any other than M&amp;A that come to mind.
---
Dropping a chase is a judgment call that any killer can make. 
---
His dream auras just help folks who can't track survivors worth a damn and you're not mindgaming anybody who can just get to a safe window or pallet in those 7 seconds and mindgame you right back. I really don't see how these strats are killing anyone other than potatoes (like myself when I play survivor lol)
---
Clown boobs!
---
Just keep trying to be honest maybe switch to another killer ir play a little survivor to see how they work.
---
I played fucking Wraith against a 3-man swf and got a 4k. Yes, I got NOED, but after I downed a guy, it got demolished. My kills started from after the gates were powered.
---
Same, my gf has a cousin and some friends that play, but i never group with them because theyre competitive and very salty and overall just stressful to play with.
---
Sure he is. You don't get to pussy out of a match just because the competition isn't to your liking.
---
Well, you *can*. It just makes you trash.
---
I already said: this post is about the idea, not about the balancing.
---
r/KarmaCourt is ringing...
---
for sure
---
I remember when autohaven's cars were death for Huntress, has that changed and I wasn't aware? Been a while since I've gotten one of those maps as or against her.
---
My friend recommended I played leatherface mainly to get him leveled up for the perk bbq and chili, is there a better killer to play as a starter instead?
---
Ik itwas a joke lol
---
No play leatherface until you get the teachable unlocked (the red perk at like level 35 or so), then switch to another killer. I would recommend hillbilly since he's basic and you can zoom around the map which will help you learn the layout of things.
---
Also watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t8u0jRxN2kQ&amp;t=2s) its a little advanced since you seem brand new but the concepts are solid. Learn to moonwalk and how the red stain works. Also play survivor as well which will help you learn how they play.
---
Finally watch Dbd twitch killers, namely Zubat, Marth, and Scott since they're the best.
---
That's a very narrow view of bottle use there. As soon as you're thinking about survivors dodging your throws, you're letting the survivor dictate the chase, when the whole point of his power is to counter that. Use the bottle to force the survivor into making that game time decision whether to cut through the cloud and hope they aren't too slow to get hit before the pallet or spend time taking an alternate route.
---
Any survivor can chill at a pallet against any killer except Huntress (and arguably Nurse) mid-chase. So what?
---
Depression is real
---
You misunderstood me
---
Yes and yes ! God we are the same üòÇ and when if they don't save they apologize frequently and I am like it's okay just save me next round if we meet together again , I usually give green flashlights with battery add-ons as I have 92 GREEN flashlight and I can't, I've tried ,I can't flashlight while in a Chase I am already freaked out enough
---
Should be added that the reason they moonwalk is so they don't lose the survivor,  while allowing the deep wounds to force them to either bleed out or mend at which point legion will catch up with them. 
---
someone is a sensitive steve
---
&gt;try and say something nice to your killers
---
r/nocontext
---
I guess blood point isn‚Äôt everything for the killers?
---
We don‚Äôt need another huntress
---
Real pro players run no mither because giving yourself an advantage is clearly something only some dumb rank 20 would do.
---
Eh, I think Leatherface can be wholly dependent on the map itself's rng, in terms of how frequent the open areas are. Shelter Woods, for instance, now has some brutal dead areas for survivors where he can seem way better than he is on maps like Lery's or a dogbone map.
---
Pig, I just don't see the appeal of in these discussions. If you pull off a dash mindgame with her at a pallet, it usually feels good, but that's dependent on how well a survivor is paying attention. Her stealth is as much of a nonfactor as T1 Myers. And her traps are only useful for tunneling a survivor trying to get out of them. If a team simply waits to remove them until the next gen is done, they don't slow the game down nearly as much as some people say they do. Again, that's dependent on a good team, and she'll often seem great because the majority of teams and the players surviving in them are not that good. I still like her for fun chill games, which is my usual MO, but I don't believe in the strengths some say she has.
---
Yes that is the one bannable form of tunneling
---
Aaaaahh this is goooorgeous
---
If it's ruin I just leave and find a different gen to work on alone. I am usually able to land the hex skill checks if no one else is on the gen for some reason.
---
The little things make this game awesome 
---
what‚Äôs M&amp;A?
---
Hiding is perfectly viable if you know what the fuck you're doing. You have clearly never played any substantive length of time as survivor if you legitimately believe it's not.
---
As far as bonuses to bloodweb rarity go, it's super minimal. At around level 40-45 bloodwebs become very static, no matter if you're prestige 0 or prestige 3. They'll always look something like the following
---
* Mix of 16-18 Commons/Uncommons
---
* 6 Rares
---
* 2-3 Very Rares (with it being 3 like 95% of the time)
---
* 0-1 Ultra Rares
---
And that's it. It's kind of depressing to see how static each web turns out but that's just the way it is.
---
How are they a smurf if you "live" in red ranks. The only people you're going to find there are certified sweats...
---
Hate to break it to you, but that isn't the pizza shirt.
---
Honestly you probably could've pulled that off if you had crawled away from the huntress after going down, since it would take her a few extra frames to get over to you, thus possibly allowing Adrenaline to actually heal you up.
---
Lol yeah, but instead I was just being stupid. But I wasn‚Äôt playing swf so I didn‚Äôt know that the last gen was about to pop.
---
Why do people who argue how OP a Killer is never actually know the Killer's stats? FF ***lasts*** 6 seconds, baseline. It takes ***15*** seconds to recharge. 
---
&gt;You said he ignores pallets. It's the same thing with Windows, he ignores those too by vaulting over it.
---
Yeah, ok, sure. He ignores the Killer window mechanic of vaulting by vaulting. Genius argument. JFC.
---
The perk actually activates if you're looking in their direction. The killer doesn't have to be looking at you. It just says "your bond reveals your Auras to each other." So the killer could be facing away from you, but you could be looking at them, and the perk would still activate.
---
You can. You just need a ...lot...of.....time.
---
I'll let the last survivor go if they're not being toxic or if they're clearly a new, inexperienced player. I don't need a 4k all the time, and the nice survivors can get some extra points 
---
If only the devs devised a method for identifying SWF groups, this wouldn't be an issue. 
---
As another killer main, with thousands of hours in the game, you'll tend to get toxic messages calling you whatever the survivors want to use as an excuse no matter how you play.
---
I faced a swf of pizza Dwight‚Äôs and they all apologized for making me wait on delivery post game
---
Thanks!
---
I‚Äôm so happy you liked my art‚ô•Ô∏è
---
He legion can‚Äôt vault that window either
---
I SHOT HIM 6 TIMES.
---
I remember seeing a screenshot where some dude had like 230 purple flashlights or something
---
Yeah, without SWF Adrenaline popping can be really hard to pull off successfully. Even when you do, sometimes you can just get smacked down again, especially if the killer's Billy, Nurse, or Huntress. (I've smacked a couple survivors down, only for the last gen to pop during the animation of falling down, then the game waits for the animation to finish before healing them up, so I'm done with the attack cooldown by the time they're up and I hit them back down)
---
Some Dwight‚Äôs regularly hit great skill checks, I‚Äôll have you know. I mean, not me, but y‚Äôknow. Some. 
---
Lol, keep telling yourself that, buddy.
---
‚ÄúWhen in the dream state, all survivors are affected by HEX: HIT THAT YEET
---
But they have so many $10 skins you can purchase...
---
I am a killer main that only plays survivor for daily rituals, and completely agree. No matter how I've tried to play, or how hard I've tried to play by survivors' made up rules, I STILL get constant hate mail from survivors. I've run into douchebag killers too, don't get me wrong, as I used to be a heavy survivor main. But I NEVER got as much shit from killers as I get from survivors.
---
I'm more scared of 3 man game, or even 2 man game to bring anything good. When they fix this nonsense (never), or finally implement match not starting if some people didn't load in, when I can bring something better
---
If you play survivor for a while, you will understand why it's so annoying for the survivor getting unhooked. There is nothing you can do to stop them from farming you. I stopped playing for months before because of constantly getting farmed, getting camped at the beginning of the game etc.
---
 I don't play killer that often but when I do, I usually go for the farming survivor unless it's just a SWF with a bunch of toxic survivors. Because I feel really bad for the person getting farmed.
---
I have gotten to the point in this game, where when I get a toxic message from another player, I just respond with "lol", and leave.
---
2/10 no pizza shirt
---
When you‚Äôre on a team you should care about the other experience, and if you disagree don‚Äôt play a team game. I play this game mostly solo and I will take hits and go down for my team even though I don‚Äôt know them. 
---
I never mentioned anything about balance all I‚Äôm implying is be a good teammate.
---
I doubt it will ever happen, but I would love if a killer like this got introduced. Different from other killers power, and would probably not be as effective against experienced players, but that power would be fun as hell to play against.
---
You delivered it 10 seconds late! I'm not paying!
---
If it‚Äôs a team game you should be more inclined to but sure you do you 
---
*moaning*
---
This is exactly why I play solo.
---
Well that and I don't have any friends
---
Not for all killers.
---
Yes. Absolutely 
---
this shit is so true 
---
Have you played survivor much? You have to get in their mindset in order to outplay them 
---
How am I angry? I just said I don‚Äôt play vs legion. 
---
It depends, maybe they deserve it.
---
I mean by that logic then facecamping every single game is perfectly ok and no one should complain about it because the killer might just be "having fun". 
---
Lol
---
Wtf is happening?
---
Please post more of your Myers stuff. I'm so thirsty
---
Since huntress is so quick to follow up attack after she throws her hatchet she could have taken a couple steps back and readied her hatchet and then camp. That would have been way harder for you.
---
First, savr up a TON of BPs abd then prestige them and level them up.
---
Luckily enough no one is stopping you from immediately leaving upon finishing the match. Been doing it for a while and the game became much more enjoyable. 
---
You don't need the full 15 seconds, though? You can activate it without needing full - this isn't the Spirit.
---
And yes, he vaults the windows better than the survivors can. If that isn't 'ignoring' I don't know what is. How can you say 'ignoring pallets'? What's with this inconsistency?
---
$11? I got it for $7. Are you not in the US?
---
No shit.
---
Play more solo, and maybe tell your friend to take a break for a bit. 
---
Can I ask how many hours you have in DBD?
---
Awesome save!
---
230ish hours, rank 7 and 8. It's not nearly as high as others however you don't need a degree in DBD to analyze game mechanics. You need to understand game design instead. 
---
Carefully thought out post. I do agree with the core message that we need to buff things rather than just nerf everything. A lot of players have been saying that for quite some time, just not enough for it to gain traction though. 
---
It's boring seeing the same few perk builds because they're meta and everything else is lackluster. It's also boring seeing the same top tier killers in a majority of matches. 
---
Even if they didn't buff survivors or killers directly, as long as they buffed non-meta perks that would be okay. In higher tier gameplay using non-meta perks generally puts you at a disadvantage, so in turn there should be more perks that are meta worthy that way you'll experience new builds frequently. 
---
I however do not agree with your concept of new abilities, as it would change the game far too much. If it was implemented in a new game mode that would be interesting, but we only have 1 gamemode and I would prefer it if BHVR didn't ruin it. 
---
Let me tell you about this time I fought a Legion in this game.  It was intense, probably the most insane feeling I have ever experienced playing a vidya game.  There was this moment of sheer panic, I had no idea what to do, I could feel the fires of Hell burning inside me, I thought I was going to die.  Every single time I was stabbed, I felt my very soul scorch and cry and all my previous sins come to light.  Never before have I felt victimized.  In fact, I called an abuse help line soon after to talk to someone about my experience.  After they hung up on me within two minutes thinking I was being insincere, I rocked back and forth in my bathtub and shivered under the cold water to try and purge the violation I felt infecting every inch of my being.  Eventually I worked the courage to scrub myself off and head off to bed.  I spent the remainder of that week avoiding my computer.  The laptop I played on was on the kitchen table, so I had to make wide U-turns to ensure I made no contact with it.  That's what Legion did to me and that was one game.  Sub/like/donate, and remember to support my patreon.  
---
While it is bannable, it is extremely hard to prove that they are singling that person out in every match. If the killer's gameplan is to tunnel to get a kill, then there's not much you can do if you're the person they decide to tunnel. 
---
My best advice would be to shrug it off and keep playing, without definitive proof you'd just be wasting your time reporting. 
---
If only playing against him was 1% fun people wouldn‚Äôt dc. I‚Äôm not saying dcing is right to do against a legion, it‚Äôs a dick move but people would rather dc than spend 20 minutes playing mend simulator. Devs need to address legion but let‚Äôs face it we‚Äôll probably get a Freddy rework before that and we all know how long that‚Äôs taking.
---
15 seconds gives you 6 seconds of use. That's 1 second of use per 2.5 seconds of charge. You may not need all 15, but you need at least 10. 15 is still preferable, otherwise 1-2 good jukes is all it takes to burn through the FF and reset the entire process.
---
&gt;How can you say 'ignoring pallets'? What's with this inconsistency?
---
What inconsistency? Legion literally uses the same window mechanic as every other Killer, they just do it faster while using their power. It's no different than EW3 Myers or using Bamboozle. They still have to use the window vault mechanic, so they literally cannot - by definition - be ignoring it. They do not, however, have to use the pallet break. They can use their power to ignore the need to break the pallet by simply vaulting it instead. 
---
i like this thinking. i think people take this game far too seriously.
---
I don't get why anybodies even playing him. Literally everybody hates him. You'd have to an asshole to play a killer knowing that nobody but you is going to have fun in the match. 
---
 I‚Äôm sobbing this is hilarious. And makes me wanna make vine-memes
---
NOED is fine. Survivors do not like adapting.
---
D-strike is a bit too strong, as there is nothing a killer can really do except get lucky or slug.
---
But I think D-strike is ok, you don't get mad at children who need a booster seat to ride in a car do you?
---
Its very useful on Doc and to get bloodpoints
---
It was a simple question to see what kind of experience you have. If you said you had like 20 hours of game time I would not bother talking about it with you. 
---
However, both of these perks are strong, too strong imo for a single perk. While there is counter play to NOED and some to DS, they are still annoying to deal with no matter what. I bet most people who plays DBD as their main game want these 2 perks gone from the game.
---
The only time I can respect and understand why someone would use DS is when they run No Mither, other than that, play the game and get better because its not needed otherwise. For NOED, this perks encourages bad players into bad in-game decisions. They want to lose 5 gens while they camp / tunnel 1 survivor so it will be a 3v1 later. 
---
These perks are just hurting the game and the community way too much.
---
An odd bulb and an intense halogen on a yellow flashlight? Was this an accident? 
---
I do not know what the word "reviled" mean, so excuse me if I repeat what you said earlier. But one way this power would be somewhat effective against more experienced killers who adapt easily and know the different maps and their layout would be if a survivor would be stuck for about 3 seconds if they happen to be in a tile that goes through transformation (works like traps, but guarantee you escape after a few seconds). All survivor also causes a noice alert to pop up (the one which pops up during a failed skill check). The animation for survivors being stuck would be either them floating a few cm above the ground or them being put in the same animation as when Freddy puts survivor to sleep.
---
I do not think the power in itself is a threath against more experienced player, although it would be fun to play with/against, which is why it should have something of a secondary bonus (like survivors being stuck for a few seconds/giving their location away).
---
This happened to me once, I didn‚Äôt even know someone was there I was just tryna chainsaw sprint lmao 
---
Dude he wasnt in struggle at all.
---
NOED is ok for swf, not for solo q really.
---
Dead hards not a crutch. Shit doesn't even work half the time. And its easily countered if the killer knows you have it. I don't get the basking in the salt thing either. Reveling in the fact that you ruin other peoples fun in video games seems really really sad.
---
GAYS..... RISE.
---
Good juke? What juke are you gonna do against the legion in FF? Sick spins? You only need a couple of seconds 2-3 at best to catch up with someone who's going down in one hit. The insane lunge distance helps with it - which does not get you out of FF. Additional addons help more with it.
---
Also, They vault it faster and keep your momentum. I think that's what you're forgetting. Remember survivors before this update and how they used to stop on windows vault? Yeah, Legions never did stop, they keep going. Not only that, but they get some sort small distance after vaulting.
---
You're massively underestimating the benefits of this vault power. And no, it's not like EW3 vault. Myers does not have momentum.
---
Oh god 
---
I have never done Insidious basement Cannibal, maybe because my Insidious is only at tier 1 and I don't have Agitation on him yet. 
---
Big fax 
---
I feel like this is a good time for some general knowledge:
---
If all the gens are done and someone is hooked, especially near an exit gate, and *especially* if the gate isn't open, the correct course of action is almost always **to open the gate first**. Seems like people don't understand that unhooking someone without a gate open is borderline idiotic since where are they gonna go?
---
OMG why didn't I think of that thanks! It's literally that easy!
---
i think i nut
---
Gumines
---
The only way to really prove that is if the killer tunnels their target to death then immediately leaves the match.
---
Happy cake day!
---
You still rank up if you die. Loop the hell out of him and either you die, break the chase, or the killer gets pissed and leaves.
---
Oh you didn't know? Survivors are not supposed to have fun according to Reddit. Apparently survivors just need to git gud.
---
Must ban your a cheater 
---
NOED encourages clearing totems, if small game was on the same level as DS or No one gets left behind, or WGLF it would have new ways to be countered. Maybe changing a perk so a Survivor is incentivized to distract the killer and is protected by doing so.
---
Legion as I said plays the game differently and we need the rest of the killers/survivors to catch up to this innovation.
---
DS is broken because obsession perks are broken. Maybe it's not that DS is strong but chasing obsessions are too weak /too hard to find. 
---
Then do it, but then prepare for DCs. 
---
The map or the engine?
---
Shouldn't backwalking be treated as an exploit? It's not really a designed tactic, it's just abusing a mechanic. How does it differ from bodyblocking the basement or dropping onto unreachable areas? They're also the results of game mechanic abuse.
---
Nurse should be fairy type
---
Like me?
---
NOED and DS are and will forever be poor comparisons because DS is much better and a pure terror to deal with.  The better comparison is NOED being the counter to Adrenaline if you want to give it a proper perk rival. 
---
But these conversations are silly and never go anywhere because anyone that has played for a decent amount of time will know that outside of heavy bias the killer perks are so outclassed by survivor perks just thinking about it will cause you to abruptly projectile vomit.  When you play a killer you're always considering perks and seeing this common trend develop: many of the desired or good ones don't come with a hideous downside to them or require a counterplay effort that the average survivor won't do because most survivor players are lab experiments gone awry.  
---
I remember when I first began playing survivor and unlocked/looked up perks I actually felt like I wasn't being given a sandwich with rat poison hidden somewhere within it.  It was amazing, eye-popping and magical.  Survivor perks are like a buffet, a feast for kings.  Their perks are not only useful and tackle everything you could ever want, but they don't even come with a real downside to them.  Even killer perks that seem simple in application like Blood Warden are given these safeguards and restrictions to ensure there's enough idiotproof counterplay to it for the survivor.  
---
Compare things like Borrowed Time and Adrenaline.  Borrowed Time will always ensure the rescued person will be able to escape the end of the game and Adrenaline straight up resurrects people like Jesus and heals them and if that wasn't enough of a stomp to your testicles you have a speed boost as well.  Yet here are killers with good perks like Ruin that can go down within fifteen seconds of a game beginning.
---
Killers have too many perks that can either be made useless through totem cleansing, requires idiotic conditions that may accidentally see you unlock a fight with Reptile from Mortal Kombat once fulfilled, or would be good but are too hampered by the developers being deathly afraid to pull the trigger on making them good with one minor adjustment.  
---
Killer perks overall when compared to a survivors perks, suck.  Considering the killer is only rocking four of them, they have to put up with four survivors rocking a staggering sixteen of them combined.  Sixteen perks that are all useful in some way and can easily be played with.  Killer perks need to be made stronger to make up for lost volume.  
---
*completes gen* Oh no he has NOED like every other leatherface in this world. 
---
Unhooking people to activate Deliverance all the way.
---
&gt;NOED encourages clearing totems, if small game was on the same level as DS or No one gets left behind, or WGLF it would have new ways to be countered. Maybe changing a perk so a Survivor is incentivized to distract the killer and is protected by doing so.
---
NOED does encourage clearing totems but that doesn't change the fact that its a bad perk with a very strong effect. Losing the game in order to activate its power is a huge gamble. If good survivors or SWF with comms manage to remove all 5 totems before the last gen, the killer played with 3 perks for nothing. Same with every other totem perk. 
---
&gt;Legion as I said plays the game differently and we need the rest of the killers/survivors to catch up to this innovation.
---
Legion should be removed or reworked (which he will). He didn't change anything, he just ruined DBD with his boring gameplay. Survivors are powerless against him yet he struggles to down them. 
---
&gt;DS is broken because obsession perks are broken. Maybe it's not that DS is strong but chasing obsessions are too weak /too hard to find. Multiple DS wouldn't be so bad if killers and survivors were strong enough to expect extended chases without relying on loops/palettes
---
Obsession is not the issue with DS, you can always play around that and even when you can't, at least you are expecting it. Non obsession DS is the real issue because it just happens and you need to deal with it, most of the time denying all the pressure that the killer could've had. Countless times I ended up getting wiggle DSed because there was no hook nearby or I downed someone right by a hook and I was trying to place that survivor in a different hook far from an objective or in the basement.
---
I don't get rank 1 on killer every season because I don't play it as much, but as someone who gets rank 1 survivor every season, there are plenty of potatoes in rank 1. 
---
The problem isn't that rank 1 lacks bad survivors, it's that every rank above lacks good survivors. While all the good players are in fact at rank 1, being rank 1 doesn't mean you are a good player. That's the point of the post. Point of the picture is the people who think their rank gives them merit when it comes to skill. It doesn't. 
---
The difference with going to medical school is because you actually have to learn in order to pass. You don't have to "learn" to get to red ranks. You just have to play a lot. I don't try to depip, but there are games where I play like a potato (because I admit that everyone has those games), and I still manage to at least black pip. I literally just had a game as Legion where I decided to give mercy towards the end and everyone escaped, and I black pipped despite playing very casually. 
---
Both
---
Well it is.Its justified but it is camping.
---
No, that's not it. If the killer is camping, the match goes like this: You do gens, the killer chases and hooks you, boom, the match has now ended for you because you're not getting off the hook. But if the killer is a decent human being, you get multiple chases, multiple intense situations where you hide from the killer, all that. There is no fun in not playing the game. That's the problem with camping killers.
---
If this were true, every good Nurse player would have a 100% win rate.
---
Doing gens, u?
---
The fact that he's still the same :D
---
so i meant "revealed" so when a survivor travels through a changed tile their aura is shown for 3 seconds, add-ons would allow for plays like what your saying, making them act like traps.
---
i did want him to play like myers with his add-ons, changing how you play him
---
I think max range nurse is more annoying than triple/more blinks. It increases her speed (because, you reach the range faster, if that makes sense. I think.), and she can blink pretty far.
---
They tend to stay as they get more blood points for it, cause the longer you survive the more you get up to a point
---
I don't have a problem with using the best perks in the game. I have a problem with flaming someone for using Enduring while you're also using the best perks in the game, then using your rank as evidence of your skill.
---
Also add-on less Freddy lol 
---
I don't go against mori's every game but everything else he said is pretty common. Solo rank 1 is nothing but useless teammates, endless killer sweat, and dc's. Killers don't even use noed that much because you don't even get to the end game most of the time at rank 1. 
---
&gt;less than 100 hours played
---
&gt;rank 8 killer
---
we done here bois
---
sloppy butcher adds about 3 to 4 seconds of heal time. personally I don't think it's very good.
---
You can you can reset your rank with cheat engine
---
They fixed that in the latest patch but this was timed so perfectly 
---
To taunt and make fun of the killer. You can go at them and force them to run out, but killers shouldn't have to do that. They're not the survivors' mother.
---
It was a shit pallet at endgame so it doesn't matter 
---
With cheat engine you can reset it past 15. 
---
i mean i hope they try something like this, it would be hard to program in my opinion, but would be so fun, though player feedback is needed, like some areas can't be changed while other get an outline of what they will be if changed, and im thinning how he does the tile changing is, ether he holds out his map and does a chant or he focuses on his amber dragonfly and a light flashes from it blinding him and everyone around him (to hide the transition) 
---
Legion sucks and everybody will hate you for playing him. And Jesus only has 1 perk worth getting. Not really worth it imo
---
As a killer main, nodding and leaving an item is nice, but a thing that would be REALLY nice for you to do a lil' dance\~ I love when survivors just spaz out
---
I haven‚Äôt got a clue then, soz
---
That is simply not true... don't confuse FPS with lag.
---
Advice #1: Start looking behind you when you're in a chase  
---
Advice #2: Don't panic and run the moment the killer starts searching around you. You're doing the opposite of staying stealth  
---
Advice #3: If you want to blend in with the environment remember that carrying the lantern makes your character visible because of the fireflies or whatever that thing is  
---
  
---
Advice #4 Don't waste pallets.  
---
Advice #5 If your teammate is hooked and you're being chased don't run towards the hook. You're helping the killer secure the hook this way.
---
Yep. Alot of people hold their ranks dearly. I get upset if i derank some but its not a big deal and im not going to stop playing. 
---
Devs are complete shit. You could make a 12 hours video of clips of shit like this happening in the game. But no releasing more cosmetics and DLC is clearly more important.
---
Hopefully, 30% of me made this so this can be a new format here.
---
Try blurring the name out; you‚Äôll prolly get banned of the sub reddit
---
Do you think he'sa real professor?
---
I play a lot of solo q, and the people im getting teamed up with already struggle with gens and making smart decisions. I dont mind cleansing totems from time to time if i think the killer has it, but if I do, no gens are getting worked on and we wont even get to late game. Im not saying this is the case in every game, but it happens way too often.
---
Solo players can take Small Game as well and from my experience it's the solo players that tend to stay overly immersed and hidden so they can just dip without hesitation when someone else gets downed with NOED. There's also no pressure from their team mates that makes them stay and unhook.  
---
Furthermore if you're playing solo and NOED activates there's nothing stopping you from searching for the totem for NOED. Two words: Small Game.
---
It is, in fact, on a P3 Legion.
---
The higher rarity only affects up to Green items. Just means you get fewer browns.
---
Im gonna say the sane thing to you, copy pasta. 
---
Hatch stand off isn't worth it. Some killers are generous while others just want the match to end so they can move on to the next one. An immersed survivor that doesn't wanna be found usually won't be, as funny as it may be/is to have the killer walk past your super awesome hiding spot. It's just plain boring.
---
Agreed. Doing a gen in the middle of the cornfield and a Myers just pops up without warning, nearly shat myself.
---
the devs have confirmed a while back that it's not taking the game hostage cause in there words you can force them out so a report would do nothing

Rotten fields is only bad if it‚Äôs billy

---
So the issue lies with DBD players skill, not the perk itself. The perk itself is fine because getting rid of totems is insanely easy, even on solo queue, but then you get teammates that can't even hold M1 in a generator, NOED has nothing to do with this.
---
If the people who are also survivors are not playing well, it should not be expected that they get out. Play smart/for the hatch or join them. And if you think its unfair that you have to die because you were paired up with bad players, then don't play a 1v4 game, its gonna happen from time to time.
---
If the survivor played well and especially when their team mates were bad/disconnected etc. they deserve the hatch in my opinion. Sometimes I like to award players that juked me with skill during the match and give them the hatch/exit gate release.
---
I love the art! It reminds me of the game Anaksha Female Assassin
---
Kinda funny how things could have been so different had the huntress just looked up the moment she heard the firecracker fuse.
---
Well glad I'm not the only person who thinks survivors should just be smarter.
---
I don't normally face camp. Exceptions are if I get one dude who ruins my game he's getting a fat facecamp and when the doors are powered. Cause why would I walk away when I KNOW all four people are gonna come to me?
---
We all know that's a mask the Pig is wearing...but what if it wasn't? \*Vsauce music plays\*
---
I hate myself for spending so long on this, but here we are. Anyway, this is based off a lil‚Äô headcanon of mine. I think killer‚Äôs humanity aren‚Äôt removed initially when brought into the Fog, but the Entity tests them via the trials, hence why there‚Äôs more human killers like Pig, Legion, Myers, etc. Obviously there are exceptions like Spirit, where the Entity kinda just yoinked her an made her into a monster. Anyway, if the killer fails to please the Entity, it strips their humanity and corrupts them into a monster (like Billy, Wraith, Hag, etc). So I drew a "corrupt" Pig, as I imagine the Entity would just make her into a Pig monster. The Entity is lazy and uncreative ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø

Pink looked weird, so I changed her colors to be that of a boar instead.

Don't forget running into the killer when he's carrying a survivor to a hook, to get that sweet free stack.

"BUT I ONLY HAVE 99 OF THEM" 
---
I don‚Äôt really use them apart from med kits and I love using my keys to find the hatch but apart from that they can all sit there! 
---
Reports are absolutely useless if you didn't do anything wrong. Don't worry.
---
And best way to deal with these annoying Players is to ignore them. Most of them get salty, so laugh about it.
---
I wouldn't recomend doing it regularly. You might be able to ensure a lot of kills, but it's quite boring
---
I use the green med kits, green tool box and keys but apart from that I just never use them lol 
---
I‚Äôm already prestige 3 on meg so no chance of losing them lol

I actually avoid basement hooks unless I'm next to the building holding them. Takes too long to get them and thats where I get the most toxicity from.

seriously wth is a sweaty killer, this term is so dumb "he tries to win, so he is sweaty" .. what? what do you guys want from killers? chase you until they would down you and then turn away? because hitting you would be sweaty right? whats a non sweaty survivor then? someone that doesnt do gens? no i think that's what you defined as a "useless teammate"
---
this game is full of entitelement, on both sides. Survivors expecting the killer to concede his fun and let them win because .. reasons? Killers expecting surviors to not use the tools they have at hand to win, say flashlights, loops, ds (\*shudders\*). Step off your high horse, this game is a pvp game like all others, one side wins, one side looses.
---
I have used plunderers in the past but not often. It‚Äôs mostly because meg is my main and I‚Äôve been playing since release with over 1.7k hours so I just ended up getting a shit load of items üòÇ

Fire away

Sometimes theyre looking for a lantern, totems, and sometimes theyre just assholes

Nice!!! Reminds me of Sin City comics
---
Thanks!!
---
I could but honestly the blood point gains suck and when I'm still trying to get most of my characters to level 50 and I don't see a large benefit to it. Plus I've played so much more killer my survivor game tends to suck.
---
Top rank is sadistic as fuck. I PS4 Killer Main and the bullshit at top ranks you get, man. Sometimes I get trolled with certain strategies that monopolize on the clunky controls of joypad. Can't do shit at that point but folk still try to rip you one. When things get that tough just take a break. Apex and Overwatch sound good!

There should really be a "top 100" rank tier.
---
did the math it's 3.2 seconds
---
I usually get survivor to start, but always get a killer one if I roll it. Usually Leatherface related.
---
Honest to god, with what type of people does everyone play in this sub? In all of my matches as killer i may have gotten salty idiots typing insults at me around 15% of the time, the rest either give a gg or even talk a bit after the match.
---
This tip, I like it.
---
&gt; Its just a bs no brain perk with too much power. Remove the MS% at least.
---
In that regard I agree. 1 shot ability is hard enough to deal with, not even Myers is faster at EW3 (just his lunge is "bigger). 
---
That only works if the killer is Nea.

Probably Nurse, I did all my survivors in solo queues within the first three tries at red ranks
---
That's because the  points system is fucking bad. Idiots who unhook you when killer is very near will get points for unhook where as the guy who got farmed gets nothing. 
---
Issa joke . . 
---
But I get what you mean , nice tip tho . 
---
Killers, in a nutshell, are the directors of a match. They alone have the biggest impact on how a game will go. So when any of the 4 other people is dissatisfied with that, they only have one person to blame.
---
Btw, pretty funny you made this post for people to explain why they find tunneling wrong, but with this response it seems you only wanted someone with the same mindset as you to confirm that what you are doing is not wrong (especially since you are rather dismissive of the other comments due to you not caring about a survivor's experience in your match)
---
By your analysis most RPG's ( mmo or single ) are also loading screens simulators since you see progress bar for your characters, abilities, etc... Are you high ?
---
The actually was very interesting thank you!!
---
I used to say GG and that was close but when streamers point you out in lockers or swf players hide in basement together playing hide and seek in lockers or noob streamer hides in basement locker all game for a "challenge" from their chat it's worthless to try and be nice. Everyone is gonna be a jerk end game so now I just call everyone sweaty and leave chat :^) 
---
Why play a game where you skill doesnt matter and legion can win even though he sucks ass and just decided you werent allowed to have fun and kills you cause you basicly have nothing that can vounter legions kit. This killer is cancer for the game and needs a fix more than freddy.
---
It's console. People are playing with controllers, killers can't turn and fall for all jukes etc ...

This game is loading screen by daylight sir and they will only respond to buffs and nerfs by adding new content! Weak killers like Freddy to make the hag seem good and killers like the Legion to make you forget about billy and nurse. 
---
Why don't you mind ya friggin business there Trapper-man?
---
Makes sense. LOL. But yeah, on pc, you only ever get killers who fall for this once in awhile. 
---
I never thought I'd ever see an Aqua Teen reference here. That show was my shit. I still have season 2 on dvd. lol
---
&gt; because getting punished for your teammates stupidity and not having a chance at survival isn't fun?
---
With all due respect but why should the killer have to care about the survivors fun?
---
Name 1 thing you can do in chase to counter legion. I will gladly wait ages. 
---
See I tried to be understanding of the survivors. But when I ask questions like: Why should I care about there fun when they don't care about mine? And then that question gets ignored. REPEATEDLY well I only really have killer related input to go off of. Hence the edit requesting actual responses. And yet still no responses to that question.
---
If I only get input supporting me doing what I want and not caring how do I think I'm going to respond? And if I'm told I should care about the other teams fun yet frequently if I play "nice" I get dragged through the mud post game, why bother?
---
&gt;NOED forces survivors to look for totem before saving.
---
Lol every man for themselves is the mantra in my group if NO ED comes up. Way too easy to go from a 3/2 man survival to 4K trying to get someone who was downed/on the hook.
---
and that's just normal heal. it's longer with self care. and considering that they're wasting *that* much time every time they're healing, it's worth it
---
Even I can‚Äôt see you for half this video 
---
Oh yes, there will be blood.
---
Ofcourse the killer is gonna camp, the bloody door was open en 3 people were walking around. What could the killer have possibly done in that situation. U just want him to walk away and get the free unhook? That's just borderline idiotic. 
---
I enjoy outplaying every survivor with Legion! I also bring a Mori every game since it heavily adds to the amount of fun!
---
Especially since they didn't teabag, class acts!
---
I'd say my normal end is no gg or anything. After that it's usually them flaming me. If more than 1 person lives I get flamed 9/10 times. If noone lives I get flamed 9/10 times. 4k's are silent 4/5 times.
---
My survivors are usually silent or salty. Nice ones are hard to find.
---
god i wish that was me
---
Yeah he can put people to sleep mid chasr. But you can't compare his ability to switch focus to any other killer. Other Killers just, you know, make a turn and get a hit
---
He can sleep them and get slowed, prolonging the chase he is in, or he can sleep them and wait awkwardly for them to fall asleep and buttfuck you with the closest pallet
---
Amanda is just the more memorable and tbh better character. I'd much rather her than Hoffman.
---
Exactly, people are taking it too personal and giving it too much thought
---
It's always a topless Bill who fails the skillchecks.
---
And then the killer finishes it with ‚Äúlol gg scrubs‚Äù
---
I was playing killer on game, I can‚Äôt remember who, but this person was on their last hook and just unhooked another survivor right in front of me. They were healthy, so I went straight for them. Chased them down really fast because they ran into a wall. Felt good.
---

I don't really care about a 9 year old I don't know may be insulting me. I like thinking that probably his life is so miserable that this is the only thing that gives him a little pleasure. This philosophy is for life.

‚ÄúActually, if you took the time to learn the person playing as legion‚Äôs play style, you can easily adapt to the way they play and try to make it harder for the killer.

Broken doesn't have to mean overpowered.

Legion breaks the mechanics of the game while still being a weak killer. If you abuse an exploit (moonwalking) or use frank's mixtape then he breaks the mechanics so hard that he becomes mid-low tier killer while being terrible to play against as there isn't anything that you can do to get away from them.
---
Yeah but you need to stalk a lot.
---
Unless you are playing against braindead survivors, youre not getting the stalk that easily, especially when they realize you are running tombstone because youre not hitting anyone and you keep running away from your obsession.
---
And if you even get lvl3, you need to tap at them and that means no pallets or windows nearby
---
I never thought I‚Äôd say ‚Äústupid rabbit bastard‚Äù in DBD but that perk would definitely make me say it

‚ÄùYou don‚Äôt get mad at children who need a booster seat to ride in a car do you?‚Äù You said this for DS althought that‚Äôs clearly for Noed lmao

sorry, i dont speak taco
---
Moonwalking refers to breaking the chase overall, it doesn't have to be by looking backwards.
---
Either way it's an exploit and you shouldn't be doing it, it's a shitty thing to do.
---
Oohhhh. Didn't knew that.
---
I've always thought the exact opposite, that it was like waving for attention like: "come save me pleaseee! D: "
---
Now it makes so much sense. 
---
That's not true. Killers can look to see if  someone is trying to juke but it's the fps that makes the whole thing annoying. If it was at 60 fps, console killers won't have a problem at all.
---
Nice post! 
---
Despite the other comments here it definitely isn't people trying to move. I've been in comms with friends who confirmed their hands are off the keyboard (I make sure to warn them "HANDS OFF KEYBOARD I HAVE WE'LL MAKE IT" before an unhook too) and I still get the bug where I have to start the process a couple times before I can actually heal them. And there still seems to be a tiny bit longer than usual delay after an unhook before you can start, but maybe I'm imagining that part.
---
You can do all of those things minus nurse and legion, you just aren't too good at the game if you think you can't.
---
Or just blood points in general.
---
Not to mention it can pump points into one of the emblems for ranking up if you care about it.
---
I started last year after Pig, and even I've noticed a massive decrease in the amount of Billy spamming.
---
That's good to hear. I mean, it's still 30 seconds and a good mood wasted, but it could always be worse :D
---
Or the ones that dc when they get downed first. Since, you know, dcing before you die means you win. 
---
This happens when the attempt to kobe brings your struggle bar below the halfway point. Even though you unhook yourself, youre technically into stage 2. It sucks and imho shouldnt happen but...
---
After returning to siege you don‚Äôt know how many times I say legion instead of lesion
---
thanks for reminding me of that heartbreaking scene. rip loki &lt;/3
---
Safe rule is to just run away whenever you see someone get the bleed timer and you're in the terror radius.
---
It's an urban-evading Nea
---
That would basically break the game though. It would fracture the playerbase and make it harder to fill lobbies... No killer would want to play against SWF and very few survivors enjoy playing without friends.
---
frank wouldn't like this
---
That feeling when you're playing a P3 Kate and you get the corn map.

---
They need to add a quitter bonus for survivors too though. The amount of survivors that DC because they were the first hit (not even downed - HIT) is insane! The remaining survivors are at an immediate disadvantage and results in more DCs. IMHO they should add a points multiplier for objectives completed after players leave/die...

Yeah probably ...  Bet he's a jealous one

Rank 2 killer, by the way
---
IKR.
---
Also, I just reached red rank. Not impressed. It's like every other rank but with a lot more SWF.
---
From a experienced killer: I hardly ever reach the point of no kills and gates open. However sometimes happenes. People forget thet the objective of the game is to make points, not to get kills/everyone surviving. If that huntress had hooked everyone twice, that would have been a rlly good game (I feel she might be rank 20-4; The easy ranks). In case you wonder how to manage this situations, I'll leave a Tru3Talent video where he shows how to, and how ppl can be greedy af https://youtu.be/PpD3Pi8HuHs

---
*badummtss*
---
It's usually from a shitty player somehow ending up getting the hatch.
---
Yeah when I reached red ranks I was proud of myself. Then every other game became a soup sandwich and I thought I was still at ranks 15-10 with how many disconnects and bad plays where made. 
---
NOED:
---
* Three counters (Breaking all the totems. Breaking the lit totem, not getting caught)
---
* Only activates at the safest time of the game for survivors (unless you specifically running a balls to the wall endgame build)
---
* Good chance it doesn't even activate at all
---
* Should only realistically get one survivor if it works at all
---
D-Strike:
---
* Only activates if you mess up
---
* Only counter is the survivor missing an easy skillcheck or getting lucky with a hook spawn
---
* Can extend a chase for a long time
---
* Can still pop if you aren't the obsession
---
Comparing the two isn't really fair.
---
NOED can definitely save a game, but plenty of perks can. the reason NOED is so much better then is should be is survivors. Don't get angry that the perk exists. Get angry at the people who don't want to play around it.
---
As a Medking, I praise your efforts, you are the kind of player the game needs. Reminds me of one of my own games, where I unhooked against a face camping billy who then did chase me after downing the unhooked one. I barely made it out, and the other survivor crawled out. Was a good day
---
Thanks, I normally look straight ahead unless I'm trying to blink into or out of a basement! I'll try this
---
Nah. If anything maybe an addon that gives you a crosshair if you hold the hatchet for long enough.
---
&gt; Whatever forums you've been frequenting must be occupied by rank 19 Meg mains.
---
What did you expect from people hanging around the official Dead By Daylight forums instead of having a constructive discussion with they upper class, the creme de la creme, the Reddit elite, in this subreddit.
---
C'mon man, I don't main Legion.
---
There is a gap in skill at a rank you can't derank from (i think its 13 or something like that). I suggest you look for some guides to help you get better
---
Yep I noticed the same and its definitly not about people moving,  I often play swf and we made sure we are not moving when healing, still it cancels.
---
So it will always be the same things then, it's not just randomly occuring (for example, one match I won't be able to blink through x wall, then the next one I will be able to)? THAT is a huge relief. My map knowledge, at this time, kinda sucks so that's just one more thing for me to remember, but it at least sounds doable
---
I hope they replace those with shorts instead soon, like the old skins. :/
---
I didn't know some of these werw unblinkable by design; I'll have to remember this as survivor!
---
There are 2 types of farmers from my experience. There are some that just expect the killer to chase them instead of the survivor on the hook and there are others that are just farming for points. If it's the first then of course I am mad at the teammate. But if it's the second I can be frustrated with the killer too. Sometimes they just save you immediately after getting hooked, you get hooked again, they save you again, you get hooked and you are basically dead. 
---
This is also why sometimes a hatchet downs a survivor when they're behind a corner. Best stay away from any ping higher than 120 whenever possible.
---
Dont forget his magic finger. 
---
Something similar happened to me. We were a Feng, Meg (guy playing), me also as Feng and a Claudette (I think). Claudette was already dead and the other Feng was injured. 
---
.
---
All gens fixed and since I was actually close to the gate, I opened it. In the meantime, while still opening the gate, Meg goes down due to trapper with NOED and got hooked (1st time). 
---
As soon as the gate opens I do the signal for Feng to come help me but she just leaves. Well, f*ck me, I won't leave anyone behind. I'm a suicidal biatch and always try to save everyone üòÇ
---
So I stepped aside from the gate and teabagged trying to signal I was looking for the totem first to at least have a chance. Lucky me I found it, close to Meg and the camping trapper. Cleansed the totem, managed to get him down and took a hit for him. In the meantime we lost the killer, healed each other and... We got out happily. Invited him to the party and he was honest telling me the second he got hooked and the other one left, he thought I was leaving too.
---
Well, naw, I always try to save everyone, even if that makes me lose everything and die. At least the other person has a chance‚úåÔ∏è great game! üòÅ
---
I don't know about the entity doing that. Most killers appearance can be explain in their bios. I know if survivors die enough the become shells and tossed into the void. My head canon is if the entity is displeased enough it tosses killers into the void too. Or posses them. Just imagine them all with spider like traits. 
---
Wait you didn't even make it out even after that. Feels bad. Cool trick though.
---
so to make this easy to understand, run around and hit people with frenzy, hit them twice then move on. keep doing this throughout the entire game and possibly get a hook to help with the score.
---
Am I understanding this correctly?
---
It's like night and day! If getting back into playing survivor is something you want to do, I'd definitely try it. This is just a personal anecdote, but I've been grinding a lot for the event and I'd say the Billy frequency at red ranks has been once ever 6 or 7 games. It's awesome!
---
I'm really happy that more killers are viable. Billy is a good killer but damn it got boring facing the same killer over and over. 
---
I'd quit too jeez that's a tough crowd. I have only been playing like 5 days and im only a rank 12 barely. I don't expect to rank up I'll probably rank down soon. 
---
It's because there isn't a David. You always go first for the David.
---
It's only her heartbeat but if I'm not mistaken freddys lullaby does count 
---
F to the guy I unhooked earlier today then.
---
I use a lot of the very rare/rare so I don‚Äôt have many left but still a nice collection ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I checked the VOD. He was SWF with a rank 15 and getting lower ranked killers (at least 5ish ranks lower).
---
His squad also got 4K'ed by that "Baby Billy" LUL
---
how does it reward bad players? You still have to catch people.
---
The spooky swinging cows are quite hypnotic. I wish my cows would swing for me, or just do something. But they don't. They don't do anything. They just hang there! They are the most boring fucking cows I've ever met! I feel like burning them dead and getting new cows.
---
I wouldn't wanna presume, but I think Nea's a woman...
---
Killer that can chain hooks really quickly and cause survivors to constantly go back and forth unhooking the killers that do it best in order are
---
Billy, nurse, huntress, michael 
---
Yes happened to me when trying I heal others, but I‚Äôve just always assumed it‚Äôs the survivor that holds shift. It‚Äôs pretty bad if that‚Äôs not the case :/
---
Out playing the survivors=exploit 4head
---
Which one are you? 
---
Facecamping is a bad strategy in this scenario and this comes from a killer main.
---
Its better to keep the survivors from getting to close to the hook and not give them time to outplay you like that.
---
Sure you might not kill the survivor you hooked in the first place but you'll probably down another one instead
---
Gotta know how to do it. Ignore it until you get your third or forth hook then make them shit their pants.
---
I know they are trying to get me to chase them or insult me. So i just kill all their friends instead.
---
I only know for a fact that pale rose is fucked, everything else seems inconsistent but pale rose is 100% consistently unplayable
---
The main problem is the 4% MS, IMO. You are by default screwed in a solo q game if you get into a chase. With 114% / 119% MS + Bloodlust, he doesnt need to use his brain at all, Press W and hard chase til he M1 you. There are probably not many pallets left at this point either, because solo q. People runs straight to the gates and leave once they see the Exposed effect, because solo q. If the MS was removed, it would be more manageable to deal with. Maybe more people would run the Hope Perk.
---
Agreed the only killer that iron maiden is useful on are leatherface and nurse cause you actually use lockers to avoid their powers 
---
Probably the trapper without game slowing perks he's pretty rough to play 
---
ALROIGHT. THESE FRICKIN SURVIVAHS HAVE GOT TO GO.
---
This is how I play survivor lol. I always go back for My friends. They don't do the same though. I'm guessing I am the way I am because I watch streamers and gameplay on the game. Also it just makes for a better story/more fun game to go back and try and save even if you die. We don't trade lives, captain
---
I agree with this fully, but as a Doctor main, i'd also like to add this: Be wary of his shock therapy. It stuns you from doing any major action for around two seconds (Vaulting, Dropping pallets, unhooking, ect..) If you have to enter a chase with him, be wary of the shock attack and try to juke it, also drop pallets early. Its better to have him eat a pallet than to let him stun you before you can stun him.
---
He has no counter play and requires no skill to play making the game vs legion just boring 
---
Same
---
Thank you
---
The hooks were glitched. Every time he got someone on a hook, they would teleport to all the hooks at once. Nobody could die. I have video of them stretching to other hooks too. Lol
---
The movespeed is not a problem if NOED doesn't even activate.
---
Even if it does, idk what to tell you. Don't get caught.
---
You're missing the point.
---
So she put so much effort in this but couldn't be bothered to make Michael shirtless.
---
Jkjk, happy birthday OP
---
Ok
---
Nice!  I do the same thing.  I only use up my bp offerings during x2 events. When I have a lot of BP I Dump it into my hoard character. 
---
Depends on the situation, if I‚Äôm the only one left, injured and don‚Äôt have a way to heal I‚Äôm either going to run out the gate if it‚Äôs open or camp the hatch until you die. Especially if I‚Äôve already been hooked twice. But if I‚Äôm fully healed, there‚Äôs at least one other person with me not on a hook and haven‚Äôt been hooked yet I‚Äôll definitely try it if the gates are open. 
---
Lullaby doesn't count as terror radius (at least for killer perks like Overwhelming Presence). For BT I'm unsure
---
I made this mistake in my first prestige. Lost about 200 items cause I maxed out on blood points and wanted to prestige üò™
---
Same! Those during events and I quite often use my map offerings because I love cold windüòÇ
---
In that situation camp yeah, but don‚Äôt face camp, look around for people trying to save the hooked survivor. You might even end up with a second kill if you play it right or even 3 if they are bad and you get lucky. 
---
Yeah definitely.  On PS4 at least I rarely faced nurse anyway,  but rank one used to be billy billy billytown. 
---
I see a lot of spirit, clown, leatherface, huntress, and trapper now.  
---
Sometimes pig, hag.  
---
Rarely Freddy micheal. Wraith. 
---
*Tap* *Tap* *Tap*
---
I lost it at that part xD
---
I use it on Hag. My logic is that she has a small radius even without it, and she's small, so she's easy to jump scare people with.
---
Honestly a solution for both sides:
---
If you have pig, just throw on ‚ÄúMake Your Choice‚Äù (or wait until it comes in the shrine) because it eliminates you tunneling the guy right off the hook, gives you a free insta down, and makes the savior stressed as fuckkkkkkkkkkk when he sees that exposed debuff pop up
---
So you all want to get rid of a killer that is meant to make it harder for survivors to bring around and distract for 5 gens? In my opinion, legion is pretty good. Of corse with purple and pink add-ons it‚Äôs gonna be bad but without those he‚Äôs pretty good.
---
I always stalk Tier 1 just to 99% before going right behind them just in case I can get a gen grab. If they let me go that far they're not looking behind, if they realize and I cannot get the grab I pop Tier 2.
---
How can he hit me? This makes no sence to me... I see 2 options on what could have happend.
---
1: If he hits me first and then the pallet hits him, then the stun should free the survivor (but it does not).
---
2: If the pallet hits first then it might be to early and the stun would not free the survivor, but then there is a pallet between us so he should not be able to hit me (and yet he does).
---
But no, instead he hits me and does not drop the survivor when he gets hit by the pallet...
---
F
---
*found survivor*

Me, an actual dumbass going to patrol a gen: Huh, wha??
---
Hag Tip #1- If you hook a survivor, always be sure to place a trap near the hook.
---
Hag  Tip #2- Just in case, you should put down a second trap. 
---
Hag Tip #3- Don't forget to place just one more trap
---
Hag Tip #4- Place a few more traps around the hook 
---
Hag Tip #5- Be sure to trap the sides of the hook in case a survivor comes from the side
---
Hag Tip #6- Place any remaining traps near the hook
---
Hag Tip #7- After placing fifty traps, facecamp just in case 
---
Tier 3 M&amp;A is also decent for hag because she already has a smaller terror radius (24m), and with the perk it drops down to 16m. Because the hag is a slower killer (110% mvmt as opposed to usual 115%), that decrease to terror radius can help you get the jump on survivors. Also, the expanded FOV can help find survivors faster after you teleport. Overall, M&amp;A is decent on Hag and definitely something you should experiment with. Hope this helped!

Watch the repair bar after the skill check is hit
---
DENIED!
---
My favorite part is I think she actually turned to look in its direction 
---
Haha this cracked me up. Thanks. How should I place traps near pallets? Never in the middle right because they can just throw it down after I teleport. So a meter or 2 after a pallet?
---
Also hooking a survivor in a basement seems to be gg
---
Oh. I thought someone just hit their very first great skill check and was so proud they were showing it off. I completely missed the repair bar filling up.
---
I think you email them and attach the link to the YT video.

Might be more to it though.

6. Dwight

I think Jeff and Tapp being at the bottom.  But no one knows if it's because the killers like them or because they are barely in the game and other survivors just annoy them more.

I think i worded it wrong. How would I get my clip from xbox to youtube

This is actually at rank one my guess is that this killer doesn‚Äôt play huntress a lot

---
The entitty needs some salt for it‚Äôs survivor pudding.
---
Gay.  Gay.  Gay.  
---
Oh wait, there's a girl and a straight guy.
---
Yeah its always a good idea to place them just before/past the pallet so you won't get stunned, but try to predict which direction a survivor would run through the pallet so you can teleport after they run through it. And yes if you hook someone in the basement with Hag its pretty much game over, whoever tries to save is gonna get messed up. I've gotten so many 4ks with basement hag it's ridiculously easy 
---
Wraith is amazing to start out for sure 
---
&gt;This is also why sometimes a hatchet downs a survivor when they're behind a corner
---
I feel like anyone who knows what "ping" is and has played this game for more than 10 minutes knows this

Written and directed by the man who brought you such hits as "Do not stop tunnelling the first person you see freddy" and the romantic classic "If you aren't kissing the guy on the hook you aren't facecamping hard enough"

Hi, Can Killers please get a Dead Hard like perk?

Lmaoooo. When I play Hag, I definitely place like 4 traps by the hook. Just in case. I usually only play her for 'teleport and hit a person' dailies though. Hooked survivors are my bait. GIVE ME THE HITS.

Exit gates were open, there wasn't much else for him to do.
---
I main Huntress and Billy xd.. mainly for the satisfaction of cross map chainsaws of cross map hatchets
---
As a solo survivor, it happens every single match now, both as the healer and the one being healed. It's definitely not a question of moving to interrupt healing, it's not the same thing at all.
---
It's been happening ever since the new patch... I feel like when they tried to change healing on the PTB, even if that change didn't go through in the end, they fucked up some code and healing is broken now. It's really annoying, makes you lose precious seconds, especially if you need to heal/be healed fast.
---
Make sure to report it in the bug reports thread on Friday. Maybe if we're enough to mention it, they'll fix it. Maybe.
---
All of you are crazy. Tapp and Amanda were the perfect fit. 
---
First movie can probably guarantee that most people would have heard these names before.
---
Also the Saw Video game follows up with Tapp as he is the main character of the first game. Unfortunately Pig head I and Pig head II (from Saw and Saw 2 video games) are nobodies and it really leaves it possible for anyone in DBD to be under the mask but from the movie standpoint and DBDs lore with the Entity Amanda slides in Perfectly. 
---
Hoffman is totally worthy of being the DBD Pig but I think people need to know the movies more to get that. Having Amanda is more of "Oh, hey it's that chick from the 1st movie" which matches better with Tapp as he is "That cop who was in the first movie" 
---
Yeah, but the Summer is way too far.
---
When I play survivor I try and herd the others out like fucking sheep. "Okay sweeties we won, time to go. Amanda doesn't want to babysit anymore"
---
Wait, did this legit happen? Haha
---
Not sure about that, it also happens when you've been injured without being hooked.
---
Only four? If at any time you have traps that can be placed you gotta put them all down on the first person you hook. Imagine them slowly losing hope as you keep placing, and placing, and placing, and placing. thats how you play hag nerd 
---
I‚Äôm what an average is, I just hate that there‚Äôs always a rank 2. Made another one of these for about a week ago, when I was rank 6. This event is the first time I‚Äôve had to wait more than a second for a match though, so you‚Äôre probs right on the second. Still annoys me when there‚Äôs a really good dude that loops me half the match, but I‚Äôm probs just bad.
---
And you may ask yourself, "This is not my beautiful map! This is not my beautiful Mori!"
---
Nothing speeds up or slows the timer aside from Legion‚Äôs addons. 
---
Yes the location names don‚Äôt mean anything in their files. It‚Äôs just the ‚Äúcode‚Äù name so people don‚Äôt find out who the killer is too early
---
That is really cool. What program did you use?

This is lovely! Really like the shadows, esp on those ears!
---
Haaahaha, then when someone comes &amp; saves them you can hear all 8 or 9 of the traps go off and they just have one small heart attack after another.
---
Am I the only one going to point out that you blinded yourself? I didn't think this was possible as survivor 
---
Make one for oinkers please
---
Yeah the firecrackers and party starters are the only items that do this I was taking a gamble on wether or not she would grab me or not
---
extra blinks needs to be deleted anyway... the only problem i have with nurse is people who use noed or ruin or extra blinks on her when she is already considered 'op'
---
Killer was Rank 2, you can see it at the end of the video. 
---
I run DH, empathy, stake out, self care
---
Nah man gotta use ruin noed make your choice and maybe even devour hope.
---
I hate it when this happens. Freedom was right there!
---
+ campbell's last breath + fragile wheeze + ebony mori
---
'i'm just learning her!!1!1'
---
My point is that the balance of the game is skewed heavily in favor of killers.  I'm not saying that, at the very highest level, killers are stronger... I'm saying that generally in red ranks, the killer is OP.
---
I‚Äôm a red rank pig so I‚Äôm helping
---
Yes, because allot of swf groups are so toxic and trashy. It's easier to just avoid them all together. It's would make it easier to keep swf lobby separate from the main lobby.
---
Oh god, no, don't give me nightmares...
---
Honestly I feel some people overreact about legion. Like yeah he‚Äôs poorly designed and not fun to face but dcing every time? Asking BHVR to delete them?

auto restart protocols you say? Aaaaand how do I make it not do that?
---
So be more careful or change the mapping??
---
Pretty easy solution
---
Once the skill check comes up try and hit for the middle, since you're new there's no point in going for a great skill check, not until the get good at the timing.
---
Have you played the tutorial?
---
Yeah but why would the killer go after the healthy, most likely harder to catch, teammate rather than the injured easy catch? To me that just doesn't make sense.
---
Beautiful
---
Ge out of here legacy all you do 8s attract the killer to my gen
---
Im not kidding

Agree, although I'm not the biggest fan of auto DIC DIC, this is a simple and nice lil buff for it.

Nope, just this one.

It's not them "doing it to you" in the sense that it's a lag switch. It's a desync bug. In my experience, it's worse on this map and on the big boat tile on The Pale Rose. The same thing has happened to me. To the killer, it just looks like you ran into that corner, so they down you easily.

Clown is better than Nurse? Clown can counter looping. Nurse IGNORES it. Clown is just easier to play.

Right next to a pallet?

also, before the skill check triggers there's a sound, so you know it's coming

*locker noises*

It's so good

Every 3 months is their current roadmap. 
---
End of August was Spirit,
---
Beginning of December was Legion
---
So we should be expecting the PTB end of Feb/Beginning of March. Nothing‚Äôs been delayed yet. 
---
So out in the open is perfect because it's not near any pallets?
---
I refuse to play against Legion until they get a complete rework (which will probably never happen). Most boring and unfun killer to vs.

I am almost always placed with people within my pay grade. Every so often a rank 5-1 will show up or maybe 2 of them but that right there is brutal. Brand new rank 19 killers in the mid season probably dont have what it takes to put down a pack of tea baggers like that.
---
When did I say that? It's out in the open, not hidden, right next to a pallet.

Because I like adult games that aren't sexualizing women.

Emphasis on ‚Äúcult-like killer‚Äù! On one of Jeff‚Äôs shirts, the title has ‚Äúcult‚Äù. It‚Äôs like in Adam‚Äôs ‚ÄúCanadian Tuxedo‚Äù

Okay, Mr. White Knight. That's a right of yours.
---
But this is a videogame. If you want to respect women and fight for their rights, that's great, but censoring an M rated game is not how you're gonna change the world, boy.
---
I don‚Äôt use ue but it is exactly the same speed at lvl 3, so you can move at walking speed while being stealthy
---
Because for survivors, being around you and in your terror radius being chased gets them extra blood points 
---
Legion is SWF üòÇ
---
There is no option to remap. Maybe read the post before posting snarky comments? 
---
But wearing thongs when you're fighting for your life is impractical. They crouch a lot around cold ground - longer underwear would be simply better.
---
I really like this one. https://youtu.be/2URAuDdiaRA
---
Did someone cleanse a hex totem before she hit you? Sounds like it was Haunted Grounds
---
If you're going down one way or another, might as well try to seduce the Killer with some sexy underwear. Maybe they'll have mercy on you that way...
---
Survivors are too OP. After an unhook you should have to t-pose in place for 45 seconds. 
---
Player level 134. Gets first 4k on rank 15. You must be one of those legendary fast learners, aren't you?
---
*neckbreaking
---
That was... gross.
---
That would only make us stronger you fool

Line of sight mind games are best. That would be faking your movements after you break Los. Legion is a lot like nurse in how you should escape him.

As a Dwight main my day is ruined

Dwight already has a MAGA hat
---
The real games are the swf.
---
It‚Äôs just at that point I‚Äôd rather them finish the gens and leave the game, but I don‚Äôt want to DC because I don‚Äôt want to take anyone‚Äôs points away. Ugh. Sometimes I feel like I‚Äôm too mentally ill for this game. 
---
Is 999 the max?
---
Do you tunnel hard?

I would say my hours but i play on ps 4 so flipers
---
Bop Goes The Weasel
---
Oh okay now it's suddenly not okay for one person to do something that ruins 4 other people's fun. Can you repeat it to all the Legion/nurse mains as well? I also don't hear anything good about clowns, doctors and Freddy got review bombed for a reason.
---
If you know when DBD was ps plus than since then and played it every day
---
Those are awesome!!
---
that's why wraith use NOED
---
I can‚Äôt believe people still use self care. They are way better ways to heal that doesn‚Äôt use a perk slot
---
Probably haunted grounds.
---
Console player, mid rank. I have been seeing a TON of wraith latley. Anyone else getting that?
---
If you know when DBD was ps plus than since than

Aqua Teen Hunger Force, absolutely hilarious show that I would recommend to everyone 
---
And what tells you that i haven't played this game much? 
---
I was able to get 6 gold coins. Got full Lunar outfits for Feng Min and Huntress. That‚Äôs all I wanted. :)
---
Yes. Jeff is a great survivor and he looks like Jesus. +100. Nah but seriously his perks are awesome. Aftercare is a great perk that although gets outshined by empathy and bond, is still super fun to run and viable. Breakdown is amazing for Sabo builds/squads and distortion is one of my personal favorite survivor perks. A straight up counter to bbq and chilli, nurse's calling and other aura perks.
---
The legion, although very controversial right now, is a super fun killer. It feels great to stab multiple survivors multiple times and I love their design and skins. Although very controversial, I have faith the devs will fix him soon. His perks aren't the greatest though. Mad grit is fun with agitation and iron grasp but it's situational otherwise, iron maiden is super situational as well because in high to mid ranks almost no one uses lockers. It's an okay perk with the huntress and doctor though. Discordance is the best perk of the legions perks but it's not that great. It's amazing combined with pop goes the weasel, surveillance and ruin. It's good but sometimes it won't really help you.
---
Overall I suggest you buy it if you're interested. Remember to also do your own research 
---
Sooooo how did that happen?
---
It's definitley and option for her more so than other killers I personally run it but lots of people might prefer enduring or sloppy butcher but it's definitley viable on her because itll take her from a 24m TR to a 16m TR which is the same as EW2 myers
---
It's arguably one of the most difficult maps for survivors, especially if you're against a nurse or doctor.
---
The last one depends on whether they hit a survivor or not. If it‚Äôs just you getting hit and you mend, then legion can‚Äôt see you unless they hit another survivor. I agree a tunneling legion sucks but to abandon your teammates because you‚Äôre facing a killer you don‚Äôt like is stupid.
---
So you're the one responsible for the reanimations my roomie had to perform on me after I died from shock because THAT FUCKING MYERS WAS RIGHT BEHIND ME INSTEAD OF COMING FROM THE LOGICAL DIRECTION AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
---
I saw them reply to a tweet about it on Twitter that they‚Äôre working on a solution for it.
---
Hardly ever see Bily - usually it's a Spirit. So much so in fact that now I use Iron Will and Calm Spirit.
---
that‚Äôs fuckin wild omg. toxic as hell 
---
The only times I'd say it's bad for survivor is nurse, doc, hag other than that it's got a ridulous amount of safe pallets one monkey survivor can easily loop for half the game if they know where the pallets are 
---
nobody was encouraging DC'ing, they were correcting frank. calm down, jesus christ
---
Well thats simply not true. There is not anything you can do to survive. Its just not simple palet looping/lose visual on legion. Sure its hard to lose good legion, but thats not impossible and ive done it many times. People will learn, same as at start all said legion is shit ...
---
Moonwalking is when you chase a survivor while walking backwards. If you don't look at the survivor, the game doesn't register it as being in a chase. Legion (and also pig) have abilities that don't tick down while you're in a chase. So they will moonwalk to trick the game into thinking that you are no longer chasing the survivor, forcing their timer down while still chasing them
---
3. More bloodpoints for totems
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even care about number 2 though if there‚Äôs a counter.
---
Haha, will agree with you there, but more often, you'd just hit someone who is bodyblocking their injured friend or something like that. That should not be punished
---
*cries in cloak* :‚Äô(
---
Trapper doesn‚Äôt have to wait 7 seconds to hit someone and with good trap placement throughout the game can get even the best of survivors.
---
Leatherface has already been discussed in a separate message in which I explained how dumb it is to suggest this.
---
I don‚Äôt consider legion a killer but I could argue him being better or worse, as in some ways he‚Äôs better and other ways he‚Äôs worse.
---
Clown has the strongest chase potential in the game outside of nurse and legion. This is something the community has agreed with since just after his release. You‚Äôve simply never met a good clown.
---
They should not be available year round for everyone to grab it, because once again it defeats the purpose of having an event with cosmetic rewards, and if you've bought the game and the DLC, odds are you're probably going to buy the event skins during the event anyway, or immediately after. So once again, the people who didn't have a chance to purchase with event currency still have the option to directly after the event ends, and the people who didn't do the event at all months down the road, don't have access to content that they didn't participate in/earn. 
---
I get where you're coming from, but once again it's just disheartening to earn something by turning in countless hours of time, when players who didn't participate in an event months back, have a skin that wasn't earned or bought around the event period. It's a win-win. It also gives incentive to actually be around for events in the game. 
---
IWAS JUST THINKING THE SAME, yes already looking into it
---
I never made the claim that you said she couldn‚Äôt be played on those maps. 
---
I said she is good on many maps outside of the ones you listed.
---
Did you just try to defend a point that wasn‚Äôt even made?
---
Yeah, I kind of tought about scrapping number 2, but tought I'd put it anyways.
---
Bloodpoint gain is something that should go up in general, especially the daily rituals
---
It's honestly too true 
---
You are actually allowing his power to do exactly what it is intended for. Clearing pallets quickly to make the map a death trap for the survivors. If you are camping pallets you remove dozens of seconds from each pallet that could be looped and making the game easier for the killer. This is no way, ‚Äúdeletes,‚Äù the clowns power.
---
Surprised that none of these 4 comments following this one is about how ‚Äúlegion is op and busted and not fun‚Äù
---
This subreddit is improving
---
You too huh? I don't understand why the started doing this in the first place. I believe it was implemented during/after the Halloween event, because players absolutely ate up the Hallowed Blight skins as they're some of (if not the best) cosmetics released in DbD to date. It was probably done as a quick cash grab, and then just stuck around since those skins were specifically so damn popular. I did buy the wraith skin one day before the event ended as I was short on time during that event, which I feel like is how it should be. The ability to purchase a skin with real money during an event if needed, and or at the end or directly after the event for a limited time. Cause what are these events now? They honestly might just be an excuse to release a bunch of skins that can only be purchased via auric cells, to increase revenue. 
---
R/inclusiveor
---
And if you only come across 1 person? Just allow them to escape you entirely?
---
Once you‚Äôve gotten multiple survivors you now need to go for one meaning that dream transition is now still in effect and can waste your time.
---
Most decent survivors don‚Äôt huddle up against Freddy to not allow this to happen in the first place. 
---
People love complaining about the devs but they don‚Äôt realize all of the great things they did for the game in 2018 (excluding legion, of course). It‚Äôs nice to see someone who actually appreciates the devs for once
---
Oh man one day one as lagging so bad I just couldn't hit the skill checks. It was so bad that I would it the button right before the skill check area even began and it would go right past it. I just hid in a corner and rescued people from hooks. At the end someone said something and I felt so bad 
---
I have actually been seeing a lot of michaels recently in red ranks
---
Because it‚Äôs rude? Like, good for you that you don‚Äôt care but other people are different and personally, I like to play games where people generally respect each other. 
---
I wonder if there are more killers played in different regions and stuff that could account for the variance we seem to see
---
It's funny because I always trap the shack when I play trapper 
---
What about people who get teamed up with the assholes?
---
Ooh thats gotta hurt 
---
I dunno man, the Huntress one is more satisfying. She's taking out her frustration on all those annoying survivors.
---
Hmmm, I feel like you didn't really get my point. I feel like if survivors don't spend some time looki g for totems, that they should be "punished" for it. For killers that don't use NOED and haven't equipped ruin, generators are done in no time if survivors don't do totems and there is barely anything you can do about it. The problem is that there is one killer that kind of makes it hard to balance the game: Nurse. 
---
Say that Legion is broken all you want, but Nurse makes balancing this game so much harder
---
Don‚Äôt play with him?
---
&gt; So wait, you‚Äôre saying that survivors should be punished for doing the MAIN objective? Weird concept. In all honesty, as a survivor main, I have no issue with not knowing because let‚Äôs face it, If you know the killer is a noob/try hard, he has NOED. It‚Äôs hardly a surprise no matter what rank you may be. NOED is literally a perk used for ‚Äúlearning killers.‚Äù More of an ongoing punishment because the Devs are usually killer bias and so are most the people on here.
---
This dude say's all this garbage and then hops online with his mic playing SWF and using DS. 
---
I use to only play Billy, stopped playing the game for awhile, when pig came out I started to main her and had a ton of fun. Now I frequently switch killers ever few matches, It is more fun to play a variety of killers than it used to be honestly. 
---
True. Bing bong boi is one of the scariest killers now imo.
---
But I mean, really, what are survivors supposed to do but loop you during a chasd? Cutting off loops comes with experience for killers, but unless the survivor BMs, I think it's fine. (yes, I get it, it's a meme) 
---
What buffs did he get? I don't remember because I don't play him often
---
They never used to do that back before they made event items available all year, but I wouldn't mind this. And if not this, I'd love for them to do what they did in the past and continue releasing new skins for the same event each year, but keeping their exclusivity to that specific event. I don't know why they stopped doing this.
---
probably on the edge and you think it hits but it doesn‚Äôt,so just try and aim more at the center

Been playing more killer lately and I got two messages saying it was a GG and they had a lot of fun, I had never received one of those! I even got a suggestion on where to check if i lost track of survivors :) It was a lovely change from the bunch of toxic swfs who would disconnect as soon as the game wouldn't go their way (pretty early on) and messaging nasty things because i let the random they left there live.
---
It's just hard when you have known the person for so long, and they are the only person you know that has been playing for a while.... Think I just need to tell him I can't handle the rage and blames if he is going to die, rock bond so you can see where I'm at lol

Hey watch what you say about Quentin.

His Add-Ons got an awesome rework and he has a speed boost everytime he uses his Bell to become visible.

*Furry Alarm*

**SLAMS BUTTON**
---
Yo did you miss the Ms. gash razor ????
---
Haha yeah I need to change them 
---
If you play LF/legion, expect the survivors to hate you. It‚Äôs irrational as fuck but it‚Äôs like this,just dc asap and let them wimp in their discord call
---
This is true, but Legion does this in a different way, where they quite literally follow you through these things, there doesn't feel like much of a counter is present since he's faster, and can pretty inevitably catch up to you unless the killer is new. You could argue that nurse and maybe Billy can do this, (that's a topic for another day though) but that's part of what makes Legion feel so annoying to play against. Kind of strips the sensation of choice during a chase, since he's going to catch up without much of an effort.
---
I agree with that
---
It makes her terror radius smaller so you can sneak easily, as for trap placement and tips there's a hag main YouTuber called space coconut which really helped me out at the beginning (i usually place traps on palettes and gens near the side of the map i spawn, also at random running places i cross when I'm a survivor) good luck, playing hag is a blast!
---
Why run no mither when  you could just go and bait a hit. No mither is 100% useless.
---
Also, you ain't gonna get a gen rush with that build. You'll get one gen maybe, but as soon as you get found you're done. Dead hard will only save you from 1 hit (with some skill) probably need another exhaustion perk.
---
I prefer it this way. I would never buy a cosmetic, but it's nice to know the option is there. I'm going to miss the entire event because of how busy I am, atm. 
---
I knew exactly what to expect from the title
---
At that point, are you even trying?
---
*Atleast he is killing humans and not animals*
---
When people use deliverance right when I‚Äôm about to unhook them for WGLF stacks...
---
Yes,yes,I don‚Äôt read the lore sry
---
I play Tapp almost exclusively on survivor actually hahaha, I find his perks really useful if you're able to switch between ballsy and careful well enough to not get hooked more than once
---
Yeah I had a game like this yesterday with a Huntress. We all circled the huntress for a bit and built chase BP. 
---
I appreciated the gesture but tbh I'd rather just play the game. Don't see why a killer would want to do that, at least go play the game, get some points and then maybe let them go at the end if that's what you wanna do.
---
Not gonna lie you make me want to purchase it and just give em a whirl.
---
I‚Äôm not being hostile. Hence the lol. Jesus you calm down. Regardless of nobody loses point, dc‚Äôing is for the birds. That‚Äôs all I was trying to say. Have a good day though my friend. 
---
wouldn't recommend no mither for solo tbh unless you're a really good and confident. personally whenever i choose to use no mither i also pick object. also with those hitboxes and broken windows, wouldn't run no mither until it's fixed. but that's just my opinion. 
---
Aside from toxic chat, how exactly are survivors toxic?
---
Play against rank 1 and you are getting murdered instead of murdering them
---
Put your controller on a flat surface rather than a bed or chair?
---
I just got them, so if you run into me it is because I am trying to learn my new killer. I got to say, the DC is real.
---
It's always fun when you manage to slug the other 3 because they keep getting too close without healing
---
Take my upvote.
---
For the pain.
---
It's disappointing for sure, but keep in mind that Up The Ante does absolutely nothing for chests. Luck only affects hooks and traps at the moment, so you don't want to use it on chest looting builds.
---
Thanks! I was confused for ages there haha

Thank you!!

Thanks!! 
---
Ah, good to know. Thanks 
---
I think the less you play one side the more dailies you get from it, when i do more survivor I'd get all killer dailies and vice versa
---
So I didn‚Äôt really understand the Dwight meme until last night. He unhooked me (orange min dress) and ran into a locker instead of healing. I ‚Äúhid‚Äù in a corner right next to said locker. Killer go right for Dwight  lol
---
Thanks! I've never had any luck with image hosting websites so I just uploaded the files to Dropbox.

I'm honored :P

Yet camping has only recently been slightly addressed?
---
Kinda unrelated to dbd,but ik some French youtubers/streamers (Wankil Studio) launched 2-3 times a ‚Äúwall of dicks‚Äù on someone‚Äôs profile and they got like 300 pages of a copied dick in character. The guy was blatantly streamsniping and damn it made me laugh
---
Very, very true
---
This bitch is so hard to play I don‚Äôt even get mad if they get kill everyone
---
It‚Äôs just a standoff of who wants to dc first. She‚Äôll just AFK until you guys dc, it‚Äôs just a waiting game. Probably should just dc.
---
I've got a fair number of exclusives in this game so I can see where you're coming from but I honestly prefer these things being available to more people. Better to please the many over the few.
---
whats a neckbeard?
---
Then just fucking leave when the gates/hatch are available. Don't fucking hook rush the assholes. Seems pretty simple to me. 
---
I always shake my head whenever I see autists doing everything humanly possible to save the asshole. Especially if it's a DS user that I dribbled or lucked out and countered their DS and put their ass on a hook. I'm like "Really? You know this asshole has DS and you're still going to mindlessly rush and try to save them with BT or whatever bullshit? Well, now you're going down with him."
---
Just leave. Stop playing like a dumbass. Leave the guy on the hook and do gens and just fucking leave. Done. 
---
yeah, but you can't gen rush when you're dead, right? 
---
The only way to win is wait her out. Other than that you gotta DC. Definitely a bannable offense. Report her and send your screenshot (and video evidence if you got it) to Behavior's support contact.
---
Yeah what the fuck
---
"Why did you do x? I'm just curious" Should be his tagline.
---
Made with memeatic
---
Ehh, I've already got all 3 outfits. Now I want the extra bloodpoints for simply performing actions around the map while carrying the lantern. 
---
Does any mod watch reddit? I have video and photo proof and I want this guy banned
---
Right you are, but I still think they should only bring back event items once a year for their specific event. It's a win-win then.
---
If someone DC's on me, I killed them.
---
gotta be prepared against the bing bong bloody dong boi 
---
Maybe but I wouldn't know. I think you're better off actually contacting behavior.
---
Yes?
---
You gain points for holding the lantern.
---
stop trying to put yourself on a pedestal, you're being downvoted because you're being annoying and condescending. 
---
Why? That makes it way easier for the killer to break them
---
Everyone always says "I hate bing bong boi" but no one every asks "how is bing bong boi?" 
---
You are better off contacting them with the video proof as needed. The guy will be banned for being a dick 
---
The problem isn‚Äôt what Legion does. It‚Äôs how they do it. If you‚Äôre the killer. You are holding forward occasionally hitting vault button/key and hitting the survivor. There is no potential to feel good about anything you do because there is a 100% chance for it to work out the way you want it to. If you‚Äôre the survivors. You can‚Äôt do anything to get Legion off of you. You will go down in a predetermined amount of time regardless of how good you are. It‚Äôs just unfun for both sides. I personally think as far as balance goes they‚Äôre just fine, but the problem isn‚Äôt that they‚Äôre unbalanced it‚Äôs that what they do is not fun to play as or against. I want more then anything to have all killers be viable, but I don‚Äôt want the viability coming from the fact that there isn‚Äôt anything the other side can do to survive. The reason we play games is to have fun right?
---
Or maybe buff thrill of the hunt so it also tells you what the hex they are working on does.
---
Kyf? In kill your friends killer has to be the host for ds to work
---
is that a lantern or are you just happy to see me OwO
---
Oh I read that as "Mr." Woups.
---
Barely developed? She's by far the most complex and developed character of the series, and actually adds to the film on a thematic level by confronting John's 'philosophy'. Hoffman is just... there. Like his entire purpose to the plot was "huh jigsaw and amanda are dead but we want more films, so lets makes another apprentice". He just offered the same perspective as John until he went supervillain in the last film.
---
I don't think you understand just how obnoxious SWF gets when they roll out the squad.
---
And people tell me I‚Äôm stupid for running Deerstalker
---
Ghost graveyard 
---
Bring NOED. I do. When I want everyone to leave after I AFK to make food, NOED helps.
---
Totem count would be really nice
---
Run a movement speed add on, then cut off their path to the pallet or window, lost track of how many survivors I've downed because they have to suddenly change course giving me time to recover 
---
I'm out here trying *hard* 
---
It's more that I revel in the fact that they act that it's my fault that their crutches didn't work for them.
---
i want bloodpoints and if i hold it, it cant be destroyed, so no thanks
---
If you don't have a red envelope your approach is correct. If you do have a red envelope you are missing out on tons of free points by doing that.
---
O my bad lol, yea Itd be nice to know if you got them all or not!!!
---
Yes and I can't thank BHVR enough for providing the community with multiple events and great cosmetic items, it's a great way to match in-game with real world events and allow everyone to experience a holiday or a real world event. I'm just suggesting a compromise to what I think could be a small issue, as other big games companies don't even do this. Event items in any game should and most do have exclusivity and are only available during that specific event, and reintroduce themselves along with new skins every year. 
---
I haven't exactly looked into what the developers bank accounts look like, or anything like that, so I only suggest this assuming that they're doing fine finacially without pricing event items with a prem currency. If I'm wrong about that, then I'll completely flip my opinion and be okay with however they want to market to the community. 
---
Update : he let us leave after an hour. 2 of us couldn't make it. 1 hour and a flame on each other for not blocking a hit resulting in not playing tonight anymore. This guy just made us hate the game. Unlucky
---
I've for sure started matches with lvl 1 characters because I accidentally hit LT just before the countdown finished 
---
Neither this sub nor the devs are sided either way. Saying that it‚Äôs one side or the other is just gonna get you various downvotes bc people don‚Äôt like those claims no matter what ‚Äúside‚Äù they‚Äôre on.
---
By this rate they will give the outfit to Meg.
---
Yeah, at the start of the game is the only time I find it really useful.
---
Sourceeee
---
I was more responding to the argument that "rank doesn't matter" that's propogated by "fog whisperers". I'm not saying that red rank means you're skilled either, but it's a good indicator of experience which tends to correlate with skill. 
---
Rank 1 has a combination of good survivors and survivors who were carried by SWF. I disagree that just playing a lot gets you to rank 1. While it may seem easy to you and me, casual gamers have trouble getting to rank 1 from my experience getting others to play DBD. If a solo can't pallet loop, run T-Walls, know when to save, etc. they're going to struggle getting past red rank killers.
---
&gt; Why are you so salty?
---
haha you're a projection machine 
---
&gt; because by the time I get there with 2+ people working on the gen. The gen is done.
---
That's just not possible. Arr you taking the scenic route?
---
Make the jacket shorter. Replace the hood with a bunny ears hat. As long as it has bunny ears, it's fine.
---
I don‚Äôt like to abandon chases. That‚Äôs probably where I‚Äôm going wrong lol. 
---
Gotta get commit to that chase.
---
Yah I‚Äôd like to see that.
---
In my experience of playing killer, the Megs and Claudettes are actually the least toxic players. They are either just people good or mediocre. I played against toxic survivors of all types but I seem to get the toxic Davids and Fengs the most.
---
I feel like this would have been better with a David with all of those perks.
---
Another trick to get tunneled to infinity and beyond is renaming yourself "Trying to do my daily", as I just found out...

This is how I imagined prove thyself being before it was made into a perk instead of a cry for help.

If you are on a gen with 1 or more people, then your skill check window is considerably/moderately/slightly decreased, hitting a great skill check grants 1.5/2/2.5x bonus progress, but missing a skill check would add 5% to the penalty, stopping progress gain for an additional .5/1/2s.
---
I wanted it to seriously punish you for fucking up, because **we told you we had it, Dwight!  It was 80% done, you dick**
---
Well that was anticlimacticüòÇ thought the cat was gonna run up the stairs with a knife üòÇüòÇ
---
If it‚Äôs not good then why do 60% of players use it?
---
This has been discussed many times already. The distance survivors get is already enough to run to a pallet so it would be better to just have a longer stun.
---
Freddy has joined the game 
---
Even then its still just M1 for 20 minutes.
---
She did, the camera cut out when she started to move üåöüôä
---
Would be interesting to see how that behavior changes if they make it so that the exit gates only stay open for 5 minutes maximum before having to reactivate them.
---
They could literally make the hoodie detachable, just slightly adjust the jacket so it makes sense.
---
Those are just polls/surveys with &lt;=100 people that participated out of the like 9,000 people that are subscribed to the sub. I‚Äôve seen polls with answers that go the complete other way where there are twice as many votes for killer than survivor, a couple polls with a handful of participants isn‚Äôt evidence.
---
Well this is a repost. The original was made a while ago probably when these weren‚Äôt nerfed. Don‚Äôt upvote this either.
---
I thought about Eric but he only cares about his son and he did have an pretty amazing send off. It would be pretty hard to top plus I wonder if physical appearance changes what the person looks like in the game considering he wouldn‚Äôt have a head. 
---
Amanda was the only one who technically played the game and ‚Äúwon‚Äù twice since she had the reverse bear trap and then she had the house in Saw 2 and she was a genuine devotee to John. She was John‚Äôs project. He made her need him. Hoffman would‚Äôve cared less about that since John just blackmailed him too.
---
 
---
Also, I stick to what I said about she inadvertently made John become Jigsaw. She pushed her junkie boyfriend into doing the robbery. She wanted that done. Hoffman doing his blackmail doesn‚Äôt change that fact; it just shows that he found out
---
Cutting off __certain__ loops comes with experience for killers. Not all loops can be countered, especially against a survivor who knows how to run good loops. Sometimes, a map will be generated in a way that completely favors survivors. The only real way to counter a loop, without a map control killer, is relying on survivor error. You can try to mindgame the survivor, but there‚Äôs no guarantee it will work. 
---
There‚Äôs a reason all these new killers coming out have perks/abilities that are in some way related to countering loops. 
---
&gt; out of the like 9,000 people that are subscribed to the sub.
---
average active participants are what matters, not overall subs. Because overall subs includes dead accounts, people who stopped using this forum etc.
---
&gt; I‚Äôve seen polls with answers that go the complete other way where there are twice as many votes for killer than survivor,
---
And those are where exactly? It seems to me I have two data sets that show a trend despite the relatively low respondent number. And you have... nothing. A possibly made up anecdote, I suppose?
---
I certainly have more than the parent comment claiming this is a killer sided community with literally no evidence and is being upvoted
---
hmm
---
As a killer main, this is extremely satisfying.
---
Killers decked out with the best perks and OP add ons who play like they are in E sports are what I would call sweaty. I don't fault people for trying hard but if you bring Iridescent Hatchets and an Ebony I'd call you sweaty. I'd say a sweaty survivor is one that brings all the crutch perks and a flashlight. I don't expect killers to concede their fun so I can have fun but Killers decked out with the best shit in the game who are try hards never care about me having fun either, so fuck em.
---
i see, thanks
---
I have to report half this subreddit every day. People don't know the concept of not stealing art here
---
running nurse‚Äôs on a m&amp;a hag is so much fun
---
Haha, anyway. My post asked what are your thoughts about discordance as a perk. It‚Äôs a good perk, I don‚Äôt find it particularly useful for my usual play style. 
---
If I‚Äôm running a gen protector build then it‚Äôs perfect.. otherwise it‚Äôs just meh to me.

Thanks, now I want bunny ears hat.

you dropped the pallet too early anyway

Well ya know, I am pretty sure the other people really don‚Äôt care if you have fun or not. I play to have fun for myself not others, sorry sir but it‚Äôs the truth 
---
I believe its 1920 x 1080? Something like that.
---
+1 for the Love Live reference.
---
not really, rank 1 killer main but ok
---
It's the only way trash killers can get their kills.  Try not to let it get you tilted that's what the hobgoblins that camp want from you.  Practice your chases and punish them for multiple gens to make them scrubs earn their babycamps.  Also run Adrenaline that way you get to zoom off like a healthy fingergunning racecar if someone farms you endgame.
---
I feel like the extra 8m repair audio surveillance grants would be a nice benefit for Myers.
---
Didn't on a dev stream one of the devs let it slip the range you can hear gen repair noises was like 16m?  If mike already has a 16m terror radius in EWII, then that extra range should come in handy for his creepy ass to stalk up.
---
Yeaaaah its not temperatures, I literally dusted my entire set-up last week. This only happens on the press space to continue screen and when a game starts and the offerings are about to be shown, makes me think there's a problem with some sort of loading.
---
Which one
---
I smell a new meme format.
---
&gt;get's called out
---
&gt;plays it off as a joke
---
I really wish the mods would take action on reposts
---
Yeah, other killers make a turn and get a hit, making it so they've probably just lost the first survivor they were chasing. Freddy can sleep multiple people, and if he sees their auras doing something he doesn't want them to do, or be somewhere he thinks is advantageous, he can just leave that chase and immediately go to the next one, without losing sight of the first survivor, until they wake up.
---
We shall never forget the bunny! **Where is our Bunny Feng Min, BHVR!?**
---
Where did you hear this? I haven't heard it anywhere.
---
I doubt it, considering Wraith and Hag are already African-themed killers.

Just 600 more points.

Lmao i would just take you out of the locker and yeet you on a hook and rely on someone saving you lol
---
We don‚Äôt really have many killers who can control the flow of a chase, however. Nurse has wallhacks and Clown can cut off certain areas and that‚Äôs about it. Every other chase is survivor dictated and with most killers it‚Äôs just going through the same motions of walking around walls and trying to mindgame the survivor to make a mistake. Legion ignoring/not respecting that is great because it forces survivors to not rely on a preset structure to try to ensure safety. It does make some chases frustrating especially if they tunnel too, but DC‚Äôing on Legion won‚Äôt change anything especially when people don‚Äôt make attempts to learn how to go against them.  
---
Everyone understands that, so don‚Äôt complain if people give you shit for being a selfish asshole.
---
Definitely hurting.
---
We never said it was a Bunny Feng Outfit, we said it was a Bunny Feng PASS.
---
This is why I always tunnel Claudettes when given the chance and never give them the hatch. People play as them because they‚Äôre practice invisible and so small that you can‚Äôt even see them even in a chase
---
Idk man there is a fair share of good nurses destroying everything on high rank PC
---
Coming from the person who DC‚Äôs no matter what, that‚Äôs hilariously ironic. 
---
Nope. It started the animation and then finished it with the hatch closing and my corpse lying on top of it. Post game we all had a laugh about it
---
Run double knife and stridor, if they try and mend near you they're screwed and on top of that it slows the game to a crawl If you can keep inflicting deep wounds 
---
IW doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre slugged
---
On PS4 we don't usually get to keep our points, I think out of all the killers that have dced on me and my friends, we have never been able to keep all of our points.

Thanks mate

Love you

No he doesn't what are you talking about?  True almost never camps I've seen hundreds of his videos.
---
Inbefore demi releases his next video
---
Had the same thing with doctors. I'm really bad at playing against doctors, so that sucked. 
---
He's still very weak tho
---
Damn, you got me. 
---
i don't get it
---
I mean like, I feel as if it doesn't really matter what someone is playing. It normally doesn't determine their toxicity, but I can see where it roots from, and normally people play certain characters when they first start for their first three perks, leaving Neas being more immersed in low ranks, and claudette's either more altruistic or confident, etc. 
---
But another thing that plays a key factor, is toxic behavior is attracted to toxic looking cosmetics, or confident players are attracted to flashy cosmetics as well. So yeah, the feng's who run all purple cosmetics, legacy survivors sometimes, Nea's with the bright hair or edgy looking pants, so on and so forth. I think that where these stereotypes mainly come from. Although, I will say that I run these looks because I'm a confident player, I always say "Ggwp", and "Gl in your next ones", after every single killer or survivor match, regardless of the circumstances or how the match turned out. This game has enough toxicity as it is.
---
Went against 2 insta heal syringes and a DS yesterday. Was not fun
---
Could you pass me the template 
---
Awww DON'T HURT MY BING BONG BOI 
---
I thought so I wonder if they'll have magic or are a cult killer.
---
I don‚Äôt have any other perks if that helps! 
---
But is your disappointment immeasurable?
---
Coming from a game like league of legends I don't really see it. I do encounter bullying but that really only happens when there's a large skill Gap between survivor and killer. At least in my experience. 
---
All it takes a little vision and an understanding of what you *can* do, and pieces of art like this are possible.
---
I tried to remember that pet but wasn‚Äôt hundred percent XD
---
He's new and he didn't know ,let him be ,he said he won't repost anything again and will link the artist work 
---
That‚Äôs just atrocious basically gives survivors so much more loop time and would make the game even more impossible for killer
---
I have another clip somewhere that‚Äôll have the opposite effect 
---
That's not a thong, and the entire Moonrise outfit is ridiculous in context.
---
At least we know why they haven't put it out. 
---
You're really expecting a serial killer (the characters in the game, not the player) to be ethical? Now I've seen everything. 
---
I've been playing for months, exclusively killer tho cause I liked killer and didnt really feel like playing survivor. Played survivor for the first time yesterday. This a meme based on how my first day as a survivor went. 
---
Why would I admit to something you‚Äôre wrong about? This is going nowhere fast...
---
That speed boat helps so much
---
Play Legion and just  deep wound people and keep survs off gens
---
have you played killer at rank 1? My record time for having all five gens done without ruin is 4 minutes 8 seconds and thats with two people getting hooked and unhooked in that time but without ruin or pop, if you don't run perks that enable you to go from chase to chase immediately you will get your ass destroyed in the big majority of the games you play. That described game was a nurse game btw. so not some weak killer. Survivors, i can't tell but seeing that not everyone runs ds/adrenaline/balanced landing and dead hard i'm quite convinced that you stand a good enough chance without those still.
---
&lt;Meg who runs We'll Make It and BT, also gets max Aultrism most games and dies for the team.
---
I‚Äôm rank 4 with killer atm and play mostly spirit and hag. Facecamping is a shitty strat since almost every decent squad of survs can play around it. If a survivor gets injured in the process of getting over to the hook they either have to leave to heal or risk getting downed. 
---
Keep in mind I‚Äôm not saying camping is bad just face camping like that is a bad strat against any decent squad.
---
I wish I had megs like you in my games. I saw a meg run the pebble park and nothing else and sandbagged literally everyone
---
Sure thing, if it‚Äôs about builds, I got answers for that. Or if you want tips while playing, it‚Äôs a bit confined to when I‚Äôm off work, but I can try to answer any questions you have, if I have the answer
---
If the killer wanted they coulda indefinitely 3 genned you. It‚Äôs a very frustrating build to play against. 
---
I probably worded that bad.
---
I meant remove Legions short missed attack cooldown so its like a pig missed lunge or regular missed attack and for the missing a feral frenzy hit, I mean if Legion goes for a hit and misses, they suffer the stun and have their power completely drained (add-ons can reduce how bad this is).
---
The 1st one is redundant with the 2nd one, but it's a proposed change that can give players a way to juke legion, since Legion negates the distance gained by using vaults or pallets
---
Mate you call clown the best killer in the chase and you say that leatherface is good because he can down multiple survivors and you say that I haven't touched the game? Sure camping pallets is what the killer wants, but there are SO MANY PALLETS that by the time that the survivor has thrown down them all the gens are done. I can understand why a lot of people think clown is good, I still get people who try to loop clown. But mate you are so oblivious to the problems of high ranks its laughable. I'm not even going to bother trying to argue with you any more as it seems like you get your opinions from TydeTyme.
---
\^This. And if his mates somehow get him unhooked. Tunnel him until he's back on the hook
---
I doubt it is intended I hope they change it honestly. I do not think anyone would complain really
---
7 seconds fedora man bad.
---
Mate you're just a meme at this point lmao. 
---
Also clown has the strongest chase potential LMAO ever heard of Hag and Spirit? 
---
&gt;This is something the community has agreed with since just after his release. You‚Äôve simply never met a good clown.
---
The communities wrong, like how its been wrong many many times before *cough cough* Freddy OP he needs a nerf *cough cough*
---
Why? It‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a daily thing, and [not everybody‚Äôs seen it](https://xkcd.com/1053/)
---
 Not camping only but playing the game in general. I only play for my own enjoyment as I‚Äôve pretty much played every videogame 
---
I usually play SWF, but half the time I'm not even with my buddy. We may just suck at teamwork.
---
You made an argument about how good huntress can abuse maps with trees. Sure they can, doesn't mean shes good on them.
---
&gt; No one had anything to say either.
---
If a survivor makes a cry post about how they got hit through a window, which is totally intended, they get a trillion points. That post described an insanely broken bug and it only got 3 upvoets and the comment saying that you don't have to play as LF got more lmao this sub is something else
---
No I didn‚Äôt, luckily I did break free and escape. But I wasn‚Äôt healed a state, and I didn‚Äôt get my sprint.
---
I mean a good timed pallet will make the gauge go down to empty, the. If they respect it wastes it. Then they barely run faster.
---
&gt; any killer can 4k if they're good 
---
Try that at high ranks when the gens pop in 4 minutes mate, sorry but this isn't the best the games been balanced. Spirit patch was when it was the most balanced, and even then survivors still have a HUGE advantage.
---
I‚Äôm struggling with survs doing gens so fast as hex ruin is gone very fast usually 
---
He said he wants to get to rank 1 not crutch his way up there.  Let him actually earn it, that first rank 1 climb should mean something.
---
There's a new killer coming out?
---
Too many pallets on the map to be able to break, long range bottle throws are eaisily dodgeable.
---
I try that at high ranks and I do that at high ranks every day I 4ked as perkless doc just 10 minutes mid tier killer 4k vs 3 rank 1s and a rank 4
---
How does it waste your time? You hold m2 on a survivors then they are basically doing nothing until they wake up?
---
Also 7 seconds fedora man bad lol.
---
That makes it even funnier and even more ironic. Cheers mate. 
---
He‚Äôs courting your girlfriend.
---
It beats running across the map for no reason.
---
What are you trying to say?
---
I did a game this morning against a Nurse. We ended up getting all the gens done relatively quickly, but once the exit gates were open, 2 people got downed and hooked. I ended up being able to save them both with level 2 No One Left Behind. All 4 of us escaped :0
---
Not sure which killer you're playing as but my build of Ruin, Overcharge, Enduring and Save the Best For Last is my go to for rank 1.  I run it on Trapper and Wraith, If I'm playing Billy I trade out Save the Best for Last for BBQ.  
---
Advice though that first climb to rank 1 should feel special so avoid using crutches like NOED or Frank's, 5 blink Nurse etc to get them.  It'll feel far more rewarding.
---
The speed bonus from hitting a pallet is unnecessary.
---
Yeah in March fam. New killer/new survivor every 3 months. 
---
...Bunny Wraith skin and I'll forgive BHVR.
---
Survive with friends
---
Yeah no leatherface legion and some other killers are worse than Freddy without addons, sorry.
---
I said this because you said she was bad at dealing with trees, which she is not assuming the huntress is good. 
---
I forgot to mention I‚Äôm playing the clown
---
Little did they know he had lightborn.
---
Brought in my only Commodious with Instructions and Socket Swivel the other day and of course I'm the first to be found.
---
Proceed to get hooked and camped before I've even used 10% of it.
---
Feelsbadman.
---
I guarantee you this was an oversight by devs and not intentional.  I'm sure it will be patched out of game in the near future.
---
I've made it my mission to personally hunt down people who do this in-game. I can't stand hooking someone I downed this way.
---
Same with sandbagging 
---
That's on me for assuming, though the conditioning is harsh when the killer just being on the map while someone is hooked is called camping. You can't reason with some people.
---
Except that addon that does aura reading while he is hidding, it will be okay if it was a red addon

---
The 7 second dream transition is a massive weakness of Freddy. Even hardcore killer mains know this. 
---
Hag is worthless at downing smart survivors in most cases as you can just run to the next loop while she‚Äôs trapping it and eventually you will make her start recycling traps, not to mention 110% movement speed making her traps the most viable thing she has.
---
Spirit is a hit or miss killer. Unless your a god spirit, (in which case you‚Äôre almost as good as a god nurse) she‚Äôs hardly a threat to even average survivors.
---
I only watch two DBD streamers and neither of them ever talk about killer balance. You‚Äôre a bloody moron mate. I honestly still can‚Äôt tell if this is a shitpost and you‚Äôre trolling me or not.
---
Thats... a whole other argument I'd love to get into when I'm not so mentally exhausted lmao
---
Leave it! Doctor is already weak enough. 
---
You can work around trees, but they still pose a problem for her. Its like LOS blockers for Nurse, you can work around them but they still pose a problem.
---
We now have a outfit option so they dont have to change anything, just make the individual parts dont appear a the customization menu
---
unless the rank 20 makes the SWF group then you get put up against a rank 20ish killer that gets his butt kicked by the 3 rank 1s they go by the rank of the one who makes the lobby they need to go by the best rank in the lobby on matchmaking but they don't at least not on ps4 and me and my friend have tested this dozens of times always same result
---
Lol yeah I play rank 1 killer so no I'm referring to camping trash that is either right in your face or so close that even if you were to be saved they are already back at your hook and looking to hard tunnel.  Games should be competitive for both sides and camping throws that completely out the window.  I get it if they were teabagging at pallets or something or if all gens are done because at that point there is no other objective to defend other than hook but short of that you're trash if you camp.
---
If you play at rank 1 without ruin you're probably going to get your ass kicked.
---
*Bunny Doc
---
I said they were better than Freddy. You are intentionally taking my messages out of context and it‚Äôs making you seem quite foolish.
---
The maximum amount of pallets is currently 15 on any given map, this is with good spawns and a lot of luck.
---
By your own logic, clown is amazing as he deals with pallets quicker than almost every other killer and almost every other killer can be looped. You should really think your arguments through before acting like I just set off your trap card. 
---
I have over 3700 hours in the game and have been playing since beta. If I don‚Äôt know the problems at high ranks then I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs unlikely many people do. 
---
You just claimed that clown was the worst killer in the game, ironically something tydetyme once said could be the case. 
---
There is no game where people respect each other. In which reality do you live?
---
Those are the worst jumping jacks I've ever seen
---
Happens on pc too
---
Definitely a lagswitch 
---
It ends on February 13th, 19:00 UTC.
---
"Mom push the button!!!"
---
The gens get done too fast for camping pallets to be a risky play. There are enough pallets on almost every map that you can just sit at them for every single pallet and the Clown can't do anything to stop it. The thing about Clown is that survivors will always sit at the pallet because they don't want to try looping, and survivors can make more mistakes looping than they do sitting at the pallet. If gen speeds were reasonable Clown would be good but they're not. Clown has no map pressure, no stall, no snowball potential with his power, no ambush, he is 100% chase focused and not even that good at it. Even better, if you window loop Clown, Clown can't do anything about it. 
---
Worst case scenario would be a safety pip but it's still possible to fully pip in that scenario 
---
Thank you mate
---
I'm pretty sure only killer has ultra rare offerings
---
Ebony mori for a killer would be easy to do that achievement 
---
Yes
---
Piggy is surprisingly good if you can use her dash at loops correctly
---
Ok but I need this IN REAL LIFE
---
Going by this logic every killer than can‚Äôt ignore pallets is complete dogshit as they can all get looped for lengthy periods of time and there‚Äôs no need to camp pallets against the rest of the cast so each one will last even longer than against clown. 
---
He cheated with lagswitch.  Hope you reported him with this video because that's a ban 
---
I once had a player call me pathetic after I won a 10 minute hatch stand off as a killer even though we had both been standing there the same amount of time. 
---
Yeah I want to be even cuter as Legion. Pink hair Susie is alright, but bunny Susie would be god-tier
---
Is that if I chase the last one though? Cause I messaged the fourth and told them "you can dc or bust out the last 3 gens but you ain't getting hatch up to you" and just went afk on the hatch while they did the last 3
---
Thats the point. Ruin is about the best perk killers have, so if you need the best perk to have a chance, how can using perks be considered sweaty?
---
Bro dont sweat it. Had some privileged streamers all report me with 4 different records of the so called lag switch. They just salty and didnt like getting stomped on. Lol so if im still not banned then your fine. Half the time it has nothing to do with connection and they lose frames from having a shitty computer that cant process the game. People are so quick to scream lagswitch when they never actually experienced one. 
---
Yah I can tell... guys a bit of a nut job 
---
Yep, that's dbd
---
Trappers story stated he was killing people with his father at their estate then he disappeared after they mysteriously found his father dead. I dont know. I think a survivor turned killer would be cool. 
---
HMU
---
I personally run devour hope.... even though it gets destroyed in the first 5 seconds.
---
I really dislike the Entity‚Äôs Touch perk idea, I think between Discordance and Survelliance any killer running all 3 of those perks could keep a game going indefinitely.  Having to waste 12 seconds to just stop a generator from regressing with no limit to how frequently the killer can use it sounds unfun. 
---
My only experience with a full squad of full P3 Claudettes, my game was held hostage for close to an hour after I got a non-camp kill. Anecdotally, Individual P3 claudettes are usually super toxic as well (Not game-mechanics-wise, literally hateful trash talk). So yeah, seems about right.
---
You sound like one of the guys when a killer says "gg" you mock them with "GEGE"
---
Wow that needs to be fixed I always run adrenaline and I'd be pissed if that happened to me
---
I play solo queue and I do fine. Bring medkits. Run bond.
---
That clauddette can‚Äôt aim...
---
Referring to people wanting to play with their friends as "Butt-buddies" just kinda nullifies any point you're making. Grow up. 
---
I play killer a little more than survivor and yeh you just gotta be able to laugh at it. 
---
I mean fk they throw shit if they win or lose. 
---
I even seen them throw salt on shit that never came into play like I had noed and ruin. The ruin was destroyed before I even found the first person and the proceeded to 4k with only 3gens done. End game I got hit with "wow bby doc needs noed and ruin!!!" Annnnd im like waaaat I 4ked with essentially 2 perks.
---
The tier list was popular before the Hag got buffed, and probably not many people have voted since the changes so she‚Äôs lower than she should be
---
The other cat is just feeding her tier 3, reported for toxicity smh
---
I love the Leatherface mori the most, the hammer to the head looks ridiculously brutal.
---
Game Over!
---
This will cost you games. 
---
The power of the mixtape in the palm of my hand 
---
Sometimes though iv seen survivors stand up for me(killer) against another survivor throwing salt. Or sit back with popcorn while they throw salt at each other. 
---
I'd recommend to have the last gen prepared at 99 and then finishing it after you unhook and run away. That way you won't get NOEDed trying to take a hit at the hook.
---
Is the cat making that noise, or is it just background noise?
---
Even though flashlight does not affect killer when looking away and if those survivors keep doing it for like 10 seconds they waste their flashlights?
---
Report him. Lagswitching killer.
---
Dude I was called a tunneling camper when iv hooked like 2 people before going back for the "tunnel victim". Lol though when Im playing massive tr doc I can see why they might think im near the hook. But honestly my heartbeats all over the map. 
---
Whenever I see concept art for this game, I wish they would do a graphics update/rework.
---
Feng Min looks nothing like that, haha.
---
It's not like the survivor could just ditch the loop as you take a minute to charge it
---
**D A R N**
---
Quality content
---
It looks amazing, Kraystall keep doing this!
---
X to doubt. I mean context is important if you play like a bby ochidos with teabags and flashlights then maaaaybe youll get more salt. 
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ The vent in the very beginning is for the heater that is on in the video, thus the background noise. Definitely not the cat üòπüôÄ that‚Äôd scare tf out of me if it was!
---
I miss Darkest/Brightest Moonlights.
---
Rip üòÇ
---
I do love when they call me a lagswitcher when Im streaming.. like bro that would mess with my recording
---
All Killer add-ons need to be like this, they need to all drastically change the way the power operates.
---
Well, you‚Äôre healing, NC reveals 2 survivors instead of 1. Or, you‚Äôre going to a survivor but it just so happens that the killer is heading in the direction of that survivor and he spots you both. Also, playing injured is absolutely doable. I think you‚Äôre confusing being unable to play injured vs being safe. 
---
I‚Äôm sure PC is a whole different ball game because of the in game chat but man console it‚Äôs way more killers it‚Äôs honestly annoying cause I love playing killer but when I see a killer being a asshole even more so if it‚Äôs a killer I use a lot I just get sad lol
---
This needs edited with the tier up sound right at the end to put the cherry on top!
---
U were slow because u had survivor on your shoulder. If survivor DCs while being on your shoulder, u still need to hook him/her. U also get points for that as if u hooked normal survivor
---
r/suddenlygay
---
Made with mematic
---
I like the Entity's Toybox perk, but I think it would be better if they were faced with 2 skill checks slightly/moderately/considerably harder, and if they fail the first one, the killer is notified. If they fail the second, they get injured.
---
I assume this is a type of cheat to do actions and warp away? Or just a bug? idk. 
---
Just so you know, it may dissapoint you now, but players with tons of hours value firecrackers often above any other item. They're a very good rescue tool and you never have enough XD
---
Aa a survivor main, I definitely agree with you. 
---
I let them go because I dont have a weird power complex and video games are supposed to be fun
---
We know the community is full of sociopaths and subhumans, this isn't even all that special, I've seen way worse. 
---
How was this meme made?
---
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED AN OPINION. PLEASE POST YOUR 1000 HOURS OR LEAVE.
---
jk jk of course.
---
Sorry, but don't blame killers. Some killers lobby dodge for a reason.
---
I lobby dodged yesterday because one game I had was a full SWF and I couldn't find anyone with the Spirit+Prayer Beads...
---
Until I went to the basement and each were crouched under a different hook. I was so tired, from a normal 8 minute game with 4k it went into a 20 minute farm fest because they let me hook them and they unhooked and ugh.........
---
I told myself...ok, no more SWF if it turns out to be this bullshit again, I was so bored, and it was my last game.
---
I only dodge people if I know they like using map offerings (or I just play omegablink and bleed them out) or if I see a key and not in a good mood (because fuck that item). 
---
Anyone who dodges based on cosmetics (including P3 clauds) is a fucking pussy tho. 
---
Easter üê£ 
---
Reinstall 
---
No one wins in a 10 minute hatch stand off. One person just doesn‚Äôt lose as bad. 
---
I think that's because they close the game from the dashboard, if they leave the normal way ingame you keep what you've earned.
---
Haunted Ground. Devour Hope?
---
I never claimed I made it. I just shared it as I thought the community would like it. :/
---
&gt; Well, you‚Äôre healing, NC reveals 2 survivors instead of 1
---
Don't heal in dumb spots at dumb times
---
&gt; Or, you‚Äôre going to a survivor but it just so happens that the killer is heading in the direction of that survivor and he spots you both.
---
And you don't realize this because why?
---
I mean, you can waste a perk slot all you want, but you're just describing potato plays to justify it
---
Apologies. I didn't mean to breach any rules etc. Just thought the community would like it. I'll be more careful what I post in future. 
---
how
---
When I first started playing it seemed like common courtesy to let the killer get hits at the door.
---
After a few months I remember seeing people on reddit screeching that survivors stand at the door "taunting" them and "bming" by not leaving and waiting for be forced out.
---
I mean not only do you both get more points for waiting, getting some chase, getting hits, etc, but survivors absolutely shouldn't leave instantly when the door is opened and just fuck anyone else in the game. Sometimes there is a lot more game to play out, with hooks, saves, chases, etc.
---
Especially in a world where I can repair 5 generators and depip, you better believe if you were AFK all game or complete crap as a killer for some reason, I'm going to come farm points off of you so I don't get penalized for your lack of ability..
---
There are so many reasons to not just open the gate and walk out instantly. lol.
---
WGLF no doubt
---
bing bong main here
---
bing bong is one of the most consistent bois i get 4k's with at rank 1. bbq - ruin - enduring - spirit fury, add-on windstorm + swift hunt / mangled thing. bodyblock, facetank pallets, murder bitches
---
do not underestimate bing bong.
---
Get WGLF. Self Care is a perk slot waste 
---
Pings have been abysmal lately so if I see that the survivors all have 300 or more I just get into a new lobby. It‚Äôs not fun for either of us when the connections that bad. In the past they‚Äôd immediately bail themselves but I guess given air times they feel beggars can‚Äôt be choosers. 
---
Don't forget healing the downed person and getting smacked for a stack. 
---
Ez repost, ez karma
---
&gt;  You‚Äôre a bloody moron mate. 
---
Says hag is worthless at downing smart survivors
---
*thonking*
---
id say it is pretty even cause even if you do not kill anyone you can walk away with like 30k 
---
ah yes... when all else fails use the N WORD
---
Over 3700 hours and still thinks Freddy is the worst killer in the game, thats just sad.
---
Also tyde said clown was a tier lmao.
---
reality is often disappointing
---
I love them :D She managed to combine my other favorite characters so well with the killers
---
Get the fuck outta here boy.
---
Best I can do is uncommon.
---
Hag does not excel in chases to the same extent of clown. 
---
And yes, I stand by that quote. You are a bloody moron.
---
Small Game sucks. I mean seriously, have you used it? Super short range but still a wide area. Combined with the spawn changes, I have walked around for more than a full minute just looking for 1 (one) totem.
---
With the new spawns, the arguement of 'just destroy totems' had lost its merit imo. I have spent an entire game looking for ruin and just not been able to find it. Good fucking luck if you are on The Game or any swamp map.
---
 James A Janise would make the best survivor change my mind
---
Big mittens
---
Kinda feel like i want to see it on ace now
---
And an even bigger foam finger at the games
---
ill even take a broken key
---
They aren‚Äôt swf. It‚Äôs just that there are so many people queuing that it looks like swf. You have no life if you dodge swf. Swf are way over altruistic, just beat the shit out of them lol.
---
I can't take you seriously lmao 
---
&gt; Hag does not excel in chases to the same extent of clown.
---
Lmfao
---
reality can be whatever i want
---
This is high quality, how do you do stuff like this
---
Source Filmmaker. :)
---
Woah man not cool not cool
---
Totems really aren't that hard to find. Also, if the survivors get a totem count, like I sugested, then it would be easiers for non SWF survivors to be coordinated at looking for totems. If it takes you 1 minute to find a totem if all 5 are up, I think you aren't looking for totems often enough. Totem spawns are quite predictable and you know that they can't spawn very close to each other, so finding totems really shouldn't be a problem. Also, small game does and amazing job at finding totems, don't you dare say that it sucks. Yes it takes up a slot, but not every perk you run should always be meta
---
Nurse is the killer equivalent to a swf in the game so it's balanced in that regard. Can be beaten with enough skill, just very difficult.
---
What show/media is the original meme from?
---
;-;
---
please forgive me
---
Survivors don't adapt? They are the ones that have taken the brunt of the nerfs and changes. They have been forced to adapt constantly. Just a couple off the top of my head that drastically changed survivor gameplay and forced them to adapt: exhaustion (and the several further nerfs that hit it), pallet vacuum, bloodlust, hexs, LITERALLY EVERY TIME A NEW KILLER IS RELEASED. Survivors adapt constantly. 
---
What's even better is when they chase you while you're chasing someone else.  I think that is toxic, but toward their teammates they're "trying to protect".  They're basically throwing the match by doing nothing. 
---
No idea, but it is a format that has been around for maybe a few months now.
---
Medkits &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Self Care
---
so WGLF
---
Self care is trash so get WGLF
---
Can we get a bunny Feng and Susie pls
---
***D  A  R  N*** 
---
Thanks Honey.
---
I personally feel that claudette with the brown outfit is the worst there
---
i dont think thats how that works bud
---
Wow, I didn't realize it was such a huge increase. 
---
i can relate
---
I've often tought about a problem with the way totems work as of now. There are no more than 2 perks that can have more than 1 totem active because Haunted Ground and 3 other hex perks already take up all the totems
---
Stop using "sweaty" and "yikes" and "toxic" and all these other gay memes then. 
---
I'm not saying that Legion is better than Nurse, I addressed this in the very first sentence, I'm saying Legion is easily 2nd best. 
---
Yes, thats bs, but I realised that NOED gives a secondary objective in the game that takes survivors time. I'm not saying NOED is a well designed secondary objective, but for now, it's the only timewaster we have
---
I feel like this a karma farming account. Goes for a popular repost and inserts a generic title of "it really do be like that sometimes". Next post will be a repost titled "weird flex but okay". 
---
This happens to my boyfriend all the time. He only plays as Jake and uses the Shrine to get teachables, so he hasn‚Äôt levelled up any other survivors. He doesn‚Äôt rely on perks, but I tend to get camped for running the killer around for a while, so him not having Borrowed Time is somewhat painful.
---
Ayyy Dead Meat
---
It wasn‚Äôt a repost
---
Ikr
---
When i first entered the tutorial after the clown update i was like, oh wow this is much much better but
---
N O P E
---
 Same fps
---
Also i'd say 25 fps 15 is too low
---
imagine trying to get the smart people in the community banned
---
I mean I played enough of both that Ive seen alot of stuff and most of the time Killers are either good guys or theyre complete douches. Survivors are almost always douches and go "What I do wrong!" Both are pretty stupid and the most active part of the community in the game is sadly toxic people. However, people like True exist  that are just nice killers and survivors.
---
I really like spies from the shadows now :) . Most survivors don't respect the birds/don't run calm spirit, so the birds give me a general direction to search in instead of whispers's vague "within 32 meters of a survivor". (Not trying to start of debate of how good spies, just that its a nice tracking perk option now)
---
Funny you say that I'm soft but you defend people who are cheating at the game. Voice chat is not in the game. Sorry to inform you of this recent revelation. It's not part of the game at all. So if you're playing with your buds and using mics then you're fucking cheating. The game wasn't designed with that shit in mind and it shows. End of story.
---
So yes, if you log in to play with your buds with mics (which again, isn't part of the base game) then you are being an asshole whether you are aware of it or not. And most squads and most Survivors are aware of this and don't care.

---
These are great! Keep 'em coming.
---
Streamers DCing because they feel the need to constantly deliver awesome gameplay is a whole nother problem imo..
---
I agree with you tho, I think many people are just too tired of legion and dc although they otherwise might play completely clean 
---
N R A D
---
Let's add some tentacles, just for him. ;)
---
Bruh i watched him make it himself
---
I am actually great with billy at maps like the game and lery's but at open maps I have trouble wtf
---
I mean when your job is to provide fun content that makes people interested I dont think legion plays fit that bill. It's either you're getting moonwalk tunneled or standing and holding m1 forever. I wouldnt sit there and keep watching if there was more than 1-2 games of that.
---
So I entirely understand their decision.
---
OMG I see her now. WTF brain why was that so hard to grasp üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Farthest I could go was rank 3, really thought I could reach rank 1 and die without regrets but its not worth the vast quantities of salt it will generate
---
Honestly, reading through some forums, I am probably wrong and the only thing they changed is how likely it is you get rarer items, independent of any luck perks or add-ons. So yeah, you should rather run it for the other things luck affects
---
A gen takes 80 seconds, a gate 20. They could be out in two to four minutes, with more points, if they just did the last gen or two, instead of staring at the Killers balls waiting for the freebie. Only one wasting time is a Survivor who waits to be given a win instead of taking it.
---
Pretty sure only auric cells but idk
---
more likely auric or shards only 
---
Oh shit. I forgot about that.
---
Lmao, what? Read my reply again, I clearly said in red ranks.
---
it do really be like that
---
oh no
---
Lol I wasn't thinking just panicking. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
You have been downvoted but huntress has a huge terror radius and shes slow. Micheal gains speed and with the right perks he can be down right op. 
---
every killer i have gone against as a survivor that had rancor always went like this: 1.) killer plays normally till 1 gen remains; 2.) when they see that 1 gen remains they go search for the obsession and proceed to tunnel them until the last gen pops; 3.) m1 and mori; 4.) others escape; 5.) "gg ez lmao" and insta dc; its always the same (for me atleast)
---
I‚Äôd say get Self Care first. I only really use WGLF during bloodpoint events to maximise profit.
---
So all a survivor would have to do is keep looking at him and he can't teleport. And those stacks still are affected by what makes Play With Your Food so bad.
---
If M&amp;A stacked with Shadoborn
---
Used to play them equally until my killer rank got higher and I started getting more toxic SWF groups. Ruined the game for me and just stressed me out/riled me up too much, so now I exclusively play survivor.
---
Yeah but I bet they had sweet add-ons.
---
Just got to rank 3 as well. Hoping I can get to rank 1 before the reset so I never have to do it again.
---
I swear killers are so sweaty in red ranks. Luckily it‚Äôs not putting me with those killers 24/7 since a lot of new players joined like a month ago and you get to play with killers that have similar play time like 70% of the time.
---
Doesn‚Äôt really matter if you win or die. They‚Äôll still shit on your head in chat after the game.
---
what's smart about DCing and leaving your team to suffer the consequences
---
all it is is that they realize legion is busted and aren't gonna put up with playing a boring ass match
---
**op uses microsoft word to make memes**
---
Not sure if killer will have a bad time or survivor will have a bad time. 
---
Best feeling ever, right?
---
Eh, kinda underpowered for an ultra rare. Maybe add 2 blinks too?
---
I think thats a good thing, you should only be able to see totems when you're actually looking for them, not when casually walking towards your next gen. At least thats better than seing a totem while working on a gen or even worse, when spawning.
---
If I‚Äôm the killer and that happens I‚Äôll just let you go. I‚Äôm playing to have fun and a 1v1 is not fun or fair. 
---
If his base mov were 105%, full stacked would be 130%, which is the speed of Legion's frenzy. Only after he downed 2 people (4 stacks) he would be below the highest base mov speed in the game, all that if nobody stack him up before that. So keep looking at him would be the worst strategy.
---
the ranking system means next to nothing
---
you don't understand that the fun of playing dead by daylight comes from beating the other side by using mindgames and outplaying them, and legion doesn't have almost any mindgames involved, or outplaying whatsoever
---
I would never blame a teammate for dcing against legion since why would you play if you know you aren't gonna have fun
---
Post the second panel without text
---
Step 3: bitch about legion on reddit
---
That‚Äôs not belittling in any way, childish, that depends on your viewpoint but I‚Äôd say given this scenario it is not. 
---
Aight
---
Hotel?
---
He has to trap it, they have to be asleep, and they actually have to touch the gen. It's a lot more than just simply being asleep.
---
And that idea would still fall into what makes PWYF so damn bad: you'd lose tokens on any attack, whether they hit or not. It's shit.
---
You made a subscribe to Pewdiepie post
---
She a mudshark tho
---
Idk what they were thinking sticking that in the back triggers like that LOL. Hopefully it'll get fixed soon \o/!

All of them, because they've never made it past rank 17.

In my opinion. Camping is defined by going out of your way to stay at the hook. I main survivor and I don't mind when a killer camps when their BBQ only shows 1 but there's 3 that aren't on hook. Its logical to stay and patrol. 
---
As well, I find alot of survivors don't understand that at the end game when all gens are on, it is literally idiotic for a killer to not camp. Since at that point their objective is just to kill, not prevent gens from completion. 
---
This is from a survivors viewpoint
---
Played a SWF match on a coldwind map. Was against the hag. 2 died and I was downed, meanwhile my friend is also downed after, but is the first they pick up. I recovered and friend tells me the general area they saw the hatch at. It was located across the map, from where we were at and near an exit gate somewhere in between a jungle gym. Hag couldn‚Äôt find me by the time they hooked my friend. I was THIS close to dying before actually being able to touch and exit through the hatch. Most intense situation I‚Äôve ever been through in my life.

Do people really dc against legion more than a huntress with a insta down hatchets? I need a source 
---
It's a real shame too. Legion's cosmetics are so good.
---
which cosmetics?
---
Right now I'm wondering how your previous comment got a downvote, I'll give you an upvote to make it more balanced 
---
I never thought that the fun of playing a survival horror game was abusing game mechanics and BMing. Hillbilly insta downs, the nurse teleports, huntress has ranged attacks yet your problem is a moody teenager who needs like 5 hits to down you. If he was as OP as you said, people at red ranks would have exclusively used him. Maybe the game needed a killer to counter toxic survivors like you.
---
The only perk in the image maybe?

Paulie Esther posted a hint for Chapter 11 that had the flag of an African country. However he deleted the tweet soon after.
---
Yes I did. Bit weird that you're looking on my profile for ammunition.
---
at that point I let them stay grab them d move on

How do you lagswitch?

What is lagswitch?

He‚Äôs played it on a few live-streams and has a small clip of Freddy at the start of one of his KC
---
Look at the other comments
---
My hunch is that Legion was made specifically to counter "death"-ball strategies (Every survivor running as a group to pop gens as quickly as possible), but the problem being that they didn't expect players to actually try to down people with Feral Frenzy and that they didn't realize it's much better in higher ranks to go after multiple generators at a single time.
---
He‚Äôs not that bad you guys are just mean
---
well sony is Bull Shit on so many levels, they dont allow Crossplay for anything, but Fortnite yet....
---
Yep. One of my first matches as killer I hit a survivor and he ofcourse got hatch. "Get juked bitch"
---
Make the whole outfit in one cosmetic slot (like the head slot) and have it overwrite the body and leg cosmetic slots so it‚Äôs the whole outfit no matter what.

Then they use their power again, or the power doesn‚Äôt run out and they just vault it. If you don‚Äôt throw it down, you get hit. If you do, you get hit. The problem isn‚Äôt that Legion is hard countering looping. It‚Äôs that‚Äôs they are hard countering everything the survivors can do to survive. While they are doing that they also suck at downing people without proper addons. It takes 4-5 hits to down them with your base power. Which means Legion is some how godlike in a chase, and useless at the same time.

You can't blame someone for dc'ing on a killer who's exploiting..

I labeled it "Shitpost" because mobile. Can only see like 2 things, Rip.
---
I agree in part. The exclusive items were really cool because if you didn't earn them, you couldn't get them. However, back then there were only 2 pieces of clothing of which only one was unique (as in not being a pallette swap)
---
Now, we get 3 full sets to obtain of which every piece is a unique piece. Would it be cool if they were only obtainable through the event? Yes. But I also understand, from the viewpoint of the devs, that work has been put in these items, and only having them being available during an event is selling them short.
---
A good way to, maybe, set apart earned cosmetics from bought cosmetics (speaking of just the event cosmetics) would be to have the earned ones have a part of the cosmetics that the bought ones don't have, like a subtle accessory or change in color of a small detail.
---
Except I can. And I will. Every time. Without apology. Fuck leavers.
---
And they're both on a bad path, so you can't even use one to wipe out half the bloodweb.

Don‚Äôt talk shit about Pizza Dwight

Personal favorite is the clown. He curb stomps you into the ground then steals one of your fingers. A true Chad.

wait until the 13th for the rank reset

If they come out with pink bunny feng I will literally cry. PLEASE. I need this. Maybe a V-day event award? Pls? üò≠

This shitpost is hella high quality... *wait, that‚Äôs illegal.*

Don't suck so much then

Easter is coming soon so better get ready BHVR
---
Doctor is worse
---
Remember teleporting to the pallets ? That was also an exploit
---
Yea and it got fixed. When moonwalking gets fixed than I will stop
---
Didn't they lighten up the screen after getting hit by mending, though?
---
dude yea, the generator goes a whole 4 seconds faster, so op.
---
I hope they don't change legion..if they do it just shows the dc'ers that they have power over the games development
---
Let me work on that üôä
---
Haha the n word is so fun
---
Yes! üòπüòπüòπ
---
An easy fix would be disable it once you ready up. 
---
Lies developers say "its not a bug, its a feature" 
---
I get the chase music is ment to obfuscate chase sounds, but that is obviously a sound glitch.  Havent had it happen that badly to me before.
---
It's happening to me, as well. Escaped with a lantern and everything yesterday and nothing. Kind of given up on the event at this point.
---
This made me laugh way harder than it should. This isn't so true anymore, but back when Sabo'd hooks had original respawn timers, this was totally real.
---
Walk away a bit, kill the farmer when they unhook. Now you have another survivor hooked and an injured survivor probably healing somewhere and not doing gens. 
---
I actually enjoy Doctor a lot, as long as he's not facecamping. :D 
---
Honestly, made me almost shit my pants. When it started it sounded like thunder. I was so confused! 
---
By unplugging your internet forever and never plugging it back in /s

They can go somewhere with their salt.
---
There are no rules to a game or any competitive event other than those that directly govern the game. There are no "moral rules", everyone should play to win. Calling things "cheap" and "toxic" are just defense mechanisms thrown up by someone who refuses to adapt.
---
What is the killer supposed to do? Pretend he thinks the survivors are at the gate when he has enough information to know that they are close by, just so that they can unhook their friend and not get their feelings hurt? Are survivors not supposed to loop a killer for 5 minutes straight if he refuses to change his chase path just so he doesn't get mad?
---
Play to win, that's all.
---
this is the most important comment. the tutorial is there for a reason and teaches you a lot of the basics.
---
 I don‚Äôt like being tracked all game myself
---
MYC, Enduring, Ruin, BBQ works pretty well, using Winstorm + Swift Hunt are pretty good addons with it.
---
Wtf Clown is huge,taller than Miguel .
---
*bunny myers
---
Do more! They look pretty cool
---
He already was a bad guy in the look-see series, he could be a killer as well.
---
This is so corny, but I fucking love it.
---
Not much of a correct way when they are loud as shit so it's pretty easy for a killer to just look up or turn around 
---
r/woooosh
---
When a killer is holding a downed survivor run up to the hook they‚Äôre at and crouch down in front of it.
---
Drop the firecracker right before they hit you then run away. The flash will stun them and they‚Äôll drop the survivor. 
---
Artad, I didn't say SWF was cheating. I clearly, very clearly said:
---
&gt;Voice chat is not in the game. Sorry to inform you of this recent revelation. It's not part of the game at all. So if you're playing with your buds and using mics then you're fucking cheating.
---
Key words: VOICE. CHAT. 
---
You stupid, vile, ignorant, trash human being. Learn to fucking read before you fucking think your garbage opinion matters you god damn waste of life. 
---
So true. So sad. 0 Games Enjoyed.
---
Boy do you have a wake up call when u depip to red ranks.
---
Why are you being downvoted? You're the killer and you decide who lives and who dies. 
---
I think Freddy is really powerful when you use him right. I am a red rank killer who avoided him for a long time cause of his reputation. I‚Äôve started leveling him up to get his teachable perks and started using to use up all the red envelopes I‚Äôve been getting. I‚Äôve never played a killer with which I get 4ks as reliable I do with Freddy. I really hope they don‚Äôt do a complete rework.
---
Honestly I'd agree that the pink and purple all seeing should probably be switched if I was being honest. If I'm being the tryhard wraith player I am, I think the purple all seeing is fine the way it is and should maybe have a better drop rate. :)
---
Not an issue I've noticed lately. Xbox if you care.
---
The only change is you can get ultra rares now
---
Rank doesnt matter also you cant be carried to a rank as you just playing the game made you rank up 
---
Lol voice chat is always implied with SWF.  If they're grouped up they're on comms.  Bro I've literally destroyed 3 4 mans at rank 1 since your original post today.  Quit crying like a toddler and use them to get better at playing killer.  Also holy shit bro you need to be on meds or something.  Dat anger though...
---
Because he IS (for both). Freddy doesn't do a thing in chases, and like Clown has abysmal map pressure. Thing is, Clown does ridiculously well in chases with his Afterpiece tonic, the only killer who does better is the nurse because she's utterly broken. What does Freddy do in chases? He's an M1 killer at that point. It's also SUPER easy to wake up so the aura reading is useless. What don't you get?
---
End result with using the build in my OP post against 3-4 man squads at rank 1 has been a consistent 3 and 4K. Shit, I think getting 3 kills against 3-4 man squad is an accomplishment because that shit is insane. 
---
Y'know, I was surprised, too. He's an *absolute fucking unit*.
---
I enjoy games against them sometimes. I hate going against leather face way more. He makes me scream lol
---
Gv it
---
You can hope all you want but I will take a fun game over a legion where there is close to no counter play 
---
Pretty sure the people who actually get offended by Tbagging are the same people who take it personally when they get flicked off in traffic. 
---
Like, is it meant to offend you? Yes. But it‚Äôs funny, doesn‚Äôt actually personally attack you, and just makes them easier to catch. 
---
"good enough" I take issue with that. As I've been rank 1 on both sides I know how it goes, there's so much a survivor can do to limit a killers information now. Half the time I go back to the hook there's already 2 people there swarming/I'm racing someone for the unhook. If there are no survivors to find away from hook, none will be found. It's not a fringe case is my point. 
---
*clears throat* ‚ÄúShitpost.‚Äù
---
They introduce an update to feng‚Äôs model that causes the game to crash when loaded in, and then promise to release bunny cosmetics one at a time in further updates
---
*sobs softy*
---
Probably a bug. I got linked to the killer somehow one time and every time they picked someone up/swung I ended up warping away from my generator, ended up a decent distance from it yet still doing the action and getting progress.
---
Don‚Äôt forget when he proved DS was turning all the frogs gay. Pretty sure there‚Äôs a high chance it‚Äôs actually just Ankle on an alt

I just do not understand how survivors that play this game do not understand that camping isn't reportable. Their either really new to the game or just don't pay enough attention to the new changes and rules of the game XD
