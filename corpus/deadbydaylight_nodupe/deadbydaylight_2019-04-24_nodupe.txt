A good nurse is absolutely viable.
---

---
Marth (and other elite nurses) will clean up in 10/10 of those games if they try to.
---
---
---
Thanks, and I definitely see it now. Hard to keep track of sizes like that during the drawing
---
BBQ was a game changer for me too. Especially for Nurse
---
Only 10 Pages? You should see my collection. I have like 50
---
Ikkkkk ü§£üòÖ
---
Your statement included the "getting a down is bound to happen." That is false and silly. The central mechanic of the game is that survivors can avoid being downed. They get downed when they make mistakes. When this happens, they deserve to get punished for it. Part of pig's power budget includes increasing the penalty for downed survivors by giving them an additional debuff.
---
It was one of the strongest parts of her kit and made her unique. It just seems foolish to to me that they've jumped through so many hoops, including nerfing a killer for a QoL change.
---
The survivors aren't screwed as in EGC allows free hatch if reopened.
---
If I had ten bucks I‚Äôd give you gold
---
Probably because any rbts that are put on if there's only one generator left are useless. The rule set addon is still not base kit, without this addon, survivors will easily just plan to 99% a gen till everyone gets their trap off. Unlike where the killer can open the exit gate and force collapse, the killer can't complete a gen that needs 1% left, making rbt's in the end game collapse useless anyway. Unless you're hanging on a hook and the killer is camping you, I don't see any way the end game collapse would screw you over with an active bear trap. You can get the trap off before anyone opens the gates, and opening the gates as the killer already puts killer at a disadvantage. Why do you think people keep 1-2 traps on them till all gens are done in the current meta? The rbt's are only scary then.
---
I have never seen ping under 500, it's tiring to see people complain about something like 200.
---
Because people don‚Äôt know how to read patch notes.
---
They read changes and assume that‚Äôs the ability in its entirety.
---
Example: Legion will no longer be able to see blood trails in Frenzy.
---
People read this change and immediately thought that Legion can no longer see targets without Deep Wounds through the walls (orange squiggles). 
---
They thought this part of Legion‚Äôs power got removed because it was not included in the patch notes.
---
People get extremely emotional and it hinders their ability to actually think. That‚Äôs why you get all these deranged Survivor and Killer main posts complaining about the most ridiculous things without any amount of critical thinking.
---
It is complete trash and they need to buff it. I only use it on my basement Trapper build with Agitation, Iron Grasp and Ruin. I probably could pick something better but considering my goal is to get them in the basement it fits well.
---
So now they literally may as well be in the store and wearable as a cosmetic because thats how useful they are
---
What does left behind do now?
---
No time soon would be my best guess.
---
If Legion is useless, so is almost the entire roster of killers.
---
I'm not, and I didn't even mean endgame chat because I don't do PC. It's more just commentary on the subreddit.
---
The fog whisperers are predominantly survivor mains, the whiny kind we always make fun of here too.
---
So Crapper confirmed as next killer?
---
Seriously this is unfair. She's one of my favorite killers and this is just ruining her, she was already weak there's no reason to nerf her.
---
I can give you some attention if your parents don't want to, it's okay.
---
From what I can see people like to pretend Billy is better than her, which is debatable at best, untrue at worst. Spirit is fine though, only OP killer is Nurse.
---
It also stops the scream from the clowns gas I think.
---
Really not surprised either, I find people always forget Australia exists. 
---
I was pretty excited to see if the server changes the state of my game, which isn't all that playable right now.
---
I repeat, you are doing something wrong as killer if you feel that way. If you feel as a killer that you have no options besides hoping for the survivor to make a mistake, you are playing wrong.
---
People can't just play perfectly as a survivor and never die, that's not a thing. The survivors are predicting you too easily or you don't have the ability to create opportunities and force survivors into places where they don't have much options. The whole game is about mindgaming, and if you can't do that properly you most likely just follow scratch marks until you catch up to a survivor for a hit rather than trying to read their intentions and force them into a tight spot to guarantee yourself a hit.
---
if you see no ruin, killer is the spirit and you still feel the urge to cleanse that totem...
---
Are you daft?  Most of his addons either fall in three categories:
---
1: Really fucking good:  Memorial, Flower and Journal, + EW III time (Rare), Infinite EW III
---
2: Complete poop: The stalk movement speed addons, + EW III time (all except rare)
---
3: Really niche. meme-tier: All the mirrors,  tombstone piece and tombstone, memo
---
All of stalky boy's addons enhance him but you can 100% play without them.  I do it a lot because I never have enough of the good ones.  Never.  So I save them for when I sense SWF asshattery.
---
Yay 150k BP for me
---
There's no way you can actually believe this.
---
The game has consistently gotten harder over time for survivors. If we magically got teleported back to 2016, 90% of games would end without the killer scoring a single hit.
---
Right this second, the game is harder for survivors than it was 3 months ago, and 3 months ago is was harder than the 3 months before that. Survivor perks constantly get wittled away into irrelevancy, while killer perks slowly get buffed. Could you imagine if a perk that every killer ran got nerfed the shit out of? That's what happened to self care.
---
This happens every time killers hit even a slight speed bump. Some killer main that can't remember past 6 months ago starts spewing bullshit about how survivors get easier every update.
---
If the devs cater to anyone, it's killers. Now, because of a PTB that won't even go through, you're acting like it's the apocalypse.
---
Crouch for 2 minutes? 
---
This isn‚Äôt Legion where the timer goes down in 15 seconds. 
---
That‚Äôs basically 2 minutes you are tunneling a survivor walking at 92% speed, slower than they can run. 
---
IF that happens, they will Nerf her more. Maybe the terror radius goes to 10 meters in a crouch. Or if the RBT times goes to 0 instead of killing the survivor, it gives them Deep Wound.
---
The only reason I wanted Nurse‚Äôs calling was for pig, but now that she‚Äôs getting fucking obliterated with nerfs there‚Äôs no reason to play her. Still gonna pick it up though.
---
If your making a point it has eluded me. People will still farm when someone dc'd after the game started? They farm now what is different?
---
I don‚Äôt think anyone saw ‚Äúblood stains can‚Äôt be seen‚Äù and thought you can‚Äôt see other survivors. But the point is they nerfed her traps too heavily to the point where they should have compensated removing a part of the rbt like that by buffing them somewhere else but they didn‚Äôt, they only nerfed them. If they had at least made rule set 2 base and remove the terror radius stopping the timer then that would be fair, but right now it‚Äôs too easy to get them off and they don‚Äôt have any substantial threat to them besides wasting a survivors time running to one box and taking it off since it‚Äôs a 50/50 chance to remove it.
---
The problem I have with mettle isn't the effect, its how easy the effect is to activate. Its more broken than decisive strike. You get a speed boost that cant be mitigated like decisive(enduring lol). This combined with adrenaline is the ultimate running machine, especially if you add instant medkits and know what you're doing.
---
The pig is doing a generator, it‚Äôs a joke about how hey can open doors
---
No Mither and Nurses... how ironic.
---
all killers use perks to be useful what are you talking about
---
1. The only time a survivor would be in your terror radius is if you were chasing them or chasing someone next to them and quickly would be gone anyway. Pig spends most of the game not even having one, so why does this nerf really do anything?
---
2. Traps were meant to delay the game, not create clutch end games. You can still hold a game hostage before generators are finished or the gates are opened, but that begs the question, why would you have most of your traps by this point in the game still?
---
3. The changes are coming alongside major gameplay changes that would cause the current Pig to be pretty insane. 
---
My interpretation of the traps was that they delayed the game and made survivors have to deal with something else, and that hasn't changed. The only time I've ever seen end game traps work out is when the pig waits for noed to kick in before using traps and that just seems like boring gameplay.
---
Enduring is an extremely good perk for chase oriented M1 killers.
---
Exactly. I was saying that the terror radius changes do not help with her tunneling trapped survivors at all, it only nerfs normal well-playing pigs.
---
I like BBQ on doctor. I like the extra tracking and with the railgun (interview tape and high stim electrode) you can often zap peoples auras to get some extra madness in and scare their pants off.
---
Every single top tier perk for survivors has been nerfed at one point or another, meanwhile ruin and noed are buffed from their release state.
---
It's unreasonable to imply that the game is getting easier over time.
---
not useless just less overwellming no killer should use only there power to down you with no counter play
---
How do buy? I want these
---
75% buff to repair speed instead of 25%
---
The last one made me laugh harder than I expected
---
Thanks.
---
Yes because ladies love a man who calls himself ‚Äúthe future ghost‚Äù and men who call people nerds and losers on his YouTube channel
---
Have fun healing this week, guys
---
Never thought Doctor was overplayed in my experience as survivor.
---
The claim was that the game and all updates are catered to survivors. If this were true, survivors power over time wouldn't be a downward trend line.
---
It drastically extends the tunneling time, though. 2 minutes is a lot of time to have no pressure on the map (basically like camping a hook). It will be easy to lose the pig when crouched too. One Lithe or sprint burst after a vault and you are gone.
---
I would agree that it was a strong and unique part of her kit, and one I even personally enjoyed quite a lot (going as far as utilizing a build consisting of NOED, Thrill, Remember Me and Blood Warden - keeping Thrill alive throughout the round just so it would protect NOED in the end game).
---
I do think the convolutedness of how they've tried to make Pig fit this "QoL change" is foolish, in that it would be much simpler to simply go about it the other way around. Her RBT ability is special for a reason, as it constitutes a unique way for survivors to die.
---
It happens to me quite a bit. I'll be running by trees and get stuck in one and then I have to wait for the killer to come find me. While playing with my friend though I've found you can free yourself if you hit the heal prompt on someone injured.
---
But yeah, they need to fix that with trees. It's been in the game since I started playing it in late 2017.
---
Honestly I'm fine with no nerf to noed, just give us a damn counter on the hub telling us how many totems are left
---
Snooze tbh, 4 perks belonging to the starting characters, 1 of which is useless, and the other 3 belong to characters you should level-up ASAP.
---
Not nescalry. Nurse and Billy can fuction without perks better.
---
Yes, but now its just useless as it littrely does not help them at all do anything useful. Its why Freddy is so bad.
---
This film predicted the future
---
I know how reverse psychology works lmao, but what would you benefit from him searching it up? It only further hurts your point of not posting it multiple times, because he proved you posted it multiple times. Proving someone wrong is not a sign of intimacy, sorry if thats how your love life is
---
I don't think the devs want more mechanics stuffed into the timed EGC. They already slow it down for downs and hooks, would it then slow down even more for traps?
---
I'm not here to debate how to balance Pig during EGC, BHVR has the data ti analyze and should be able to buff/balance killers based on introduction of a big new mechanic. We can only hope they can do it fairly.
---
Not sure, but doing nothing or sulking is far and away a worse solution.
---
I made an effort to avoid a chase with people with traps on their head because I'd rather they waste time getting away from me and find a box than chase them when I can chase someone else. Now I have no incentive to avoid them because their trap isn't going down anyway. Might as well bring them down.
---
i mean.....its not *wrong*
---
Doing nothing does not solve the issue.
---
Pointlessly ruining the pig isn‚Äôt the solution. And BHVR has consistently handled things incompetently and unfairly in the past.
---
No mither yass finally /s
---
Probably a rank 20
---
Yes but that is only if OCE has enough numbers that they decide to sustain it. If they don't, well congratulations the OCE community will now be running on 200ping+ lobbies everytime we want to play. This is exactly what i was worried about occurring.
---
There goes my Distressing impossible skill checks box build I was working towards.
---
&gt;Most likely internal testing showed
---
OMEGALUL, dude please
---
FFS. Should've seen it coming though, since all their tests just lumped us with Asia/south America.
---
What
---
"It was known that Deep Wounds would be used with Borrowed Time, making the timer not go down in a chase, so this was an indirect buff to the perk"
---
Can you elaborate? Unless borrowed time went down while in chase prior to this? I'm confused.
---
It's weird to me you compare it to survivor perks when shit like Beast of Prey exists.
---
- I expect it and I expect gens... but it's not that simple? Everything I listed would have to happen to put you in the scenario the other guy mentioned
---
- They gotta finish that chase and kill them, and find that hatch to close it... all the while you're working on getting that RBT off to avoid the situation listed from happening.
---
- how do you think the hatch spawns bro? They wont close that hatch and camp Jigsaw Boxes UNLESS they down the only other person
---
Old Borrowed Time would go down no matter what I'm pretty sure. It was just a matter of chasing
---
Yeah it was a pretty bad angle lol but it's just three sacrificed survivors
---
Good perks but a weak shrine tbh. These are perks I feel most people already have or they're on characters people have likely already levelled.
---
Nurse's calling? That will do finely against rank 15 self-carers.
---
I imagine one of her perks would involve using another survivor as a human shield to take a hit for her XD
---
See, going for 50/50 is a terrible idea. You have to consider difficulty, and how rewarding the game play is. Most Nurses are mediocre at best, and aren't going to be a significant problem. But a good Nurse can be nearly impossible to go against, no matter how good the survivors are. Meanwhile, Freddy requires a lot of knowledge and has different ways to play him, but you can still have very bad games even though you're an expert at Freddy, simply because the character is weak against survivors who know how to counter him.
---
Pig is a simple M1 killer, with a relatively weak and unrewarding power, and BHVR decided to make half of it slightly weaker, and slightly less rewarding. She runs chases like any normal M1 killer, and the traps are not particularly strong. At most, she can get a free hit on someone if they're not paying attention.
---
If you're saying the Pig deserved a nerf with no compensation, then I'm left with the impression that you think every single killer deserves nerfs, not to mention what should be done to some of the top tier killers.
---
They nerfed her p hard.
---
I think the reason that people aren't as mad about legion as about pig is that pig wasn't very good in the first place while also no being unfun to play against
---
I like my pork thick and juicy
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Sorry bud but it‚Äôs hard to tell if you were joking or not since there are actually people out there who believes she needed that nerf or worse
---
How do you get your flair like that?
---
"Shitpost"
---
Thank. üëè You. üëè
---
Feels like I'm wearing nothing at all!
---
&gt;pig spends most of her time without one, so why does this nerf even matter?
---
Wrong. Pig only crouches bear gens or to dash at a loop. However, when patrolling or in chase she has her terror radius
---
&gt;not create clutch endgames
---
True, but it made sure the traps always had a purpose. Now in endgame they‚Äôre useless
---
&gt;major gameplay changes
---
I have not seen these, what are you talking about?
---
Yes
---
I was just thinking about Enduring this morning, as I've just started levelling up my Wraith. Excited to give it a try!
---
What did they do?
---
Lol duly noted! I'll use this system from now on haha
---
No no, this solution is far too simple for BHVR to handle. It must be at least 10x more complicated and unnecessary.
---
Not sure if anyone is looking for confirmation on this. Keys do reopen the hatch if it's closed by the killer.
---
i mean i still say infinite to ironworks or laurie house bc theres no mindgames there so if you dont have bamboozle you better start bloodlusting
---
I think they meant to buff her on accident
---
Put it this way, look at release sprint burst, self care, saboteur, decisive strike, and borrowed time. These are all perks that fundamentally broke the game and received several nerfs. Ask yourself, has any killer perk gone through the amount of legitimate criticism as any of these? No, the only thing that comes close to that on the killer side was the machine-gun build, which saw both perks nerfed into uselessness within days, one of the perks is still unusable. Has any survivor perk that I listed been instantly nerfed to shit? No. That's my point.
---
Would a sound cue of a lit totem kinda like the hatch but obviously much quieter be to OP for the survivor side? That would be a pretty decent counter to NOED imo
---
If you're a real stealth focused player you laugh at such statements
---
The joke
---
^^^^^^^^
---
MarkGabdoas head
---
It formatted better in my head ok
---
Tbh I think that's too much. A sound cue would essentially make small game almost completely useless (unless playing trapper). I think just a counter would be sufficient imo
---
Literally every perk you have mentioned has been nerfed to shit lol.
---
Oh yeah completely forgot about small game but tbh i NEVER seen it run though [rank 13 here]
---
I mean crazy idea, they could look to fix and address these chase registration issues instead just blanket change the powers to obscure the problem, because jank chase mechanics also screw over your chaser emblem aswell.
---
Sad boi is sad.
---
Confounding variables
---
lmao speak for yourselves i'm gonna buy the game twice.
---
pig needed a buff if anything but i couldn't care less if we get all this good stuff. also i see a pig every 30 games so there's that
---
I sometimes run it when playing during rank reset since that's when noed is common but yeah, it's not a guarantee that you'll face NOED which is why most dont bring it. 
---
Plus there's more "essential" perks like adrenaline, SB, etc.
---
Imma yoink that nurses
---
yeah it stops the scream from clowns gas as well, and you dont cry out when you get hit. i imagine theyre making it prevent screams from things like infectious fright
---
Which would be fine but time and time again we getting patches with easy to replicate, often times game changing bugs that mean certain killer or perks are dead until fixed.
---
sad oink
---
FUCK WHICH SHKUKD I GET THEYRE ALL SO GOKD
---
I have never seen a pig patrol without crouching, even watching others play. Are you sure you're not the one playing incorrectly?
---
And her traps still have a purpose, they slow the game down, that hasn't changed at all.
---
You're unaware they are overhauling the end game to force survivors out after 3 minutes, locking trap doors powers all gens automatically and all that jazz?

Here let me break it down for you. Yes most of them are now balanced, but it took YEARS, and they weren't just unbalanced on release, they broke the game. Does ruin break the game? Does noed break the game? Noed was nerfed within a month of release. Ruin is only a nuisance, and that's only if it's not found in 10s or the survivors can't hit skill checks.
---
Its somewhat of a tricky bar to balance when the most effective killer ignores pallets, and the second best can fly across the map with a instant down. Everything starts to look more garbage in comparison because why play any killer who cant do those things. The Benefits of the other killers don't outweigh the benefits of the Nurse and Billy.
---
It's a 25/100 chance
---
i see theyre reverting the shrine back to the "perks everyone already has" format
---
So you're saying half the moonwalking legions weren't idiots trying to upset people? And who knows maybe they just want the trap kill for the fun of it.
---
I understand the reasoning behind the endgame chase, but I think it will just promote gen rushing against the only killer who made gen rushing somewhat dangerous, and forced survivors to make decisions in the endgame.
---
The change to make the timer stop in the tr is just stupid though, it punishes non tunneling killers while not having any effect on tunneling ones, since Amanda can suppress her tr.

---
Probably around the time you realize NOED is a pretty shit perk unless you're a really greedy survivor, at which point you will stop bitching.
---
People ACTUALLY care about others with the RBT on them?
---
The Clown is all about whichever finger tastes the best.
---
I do not know why you are asking me this question.
---
When I say win, I mean exit gates getting powered. If 2 survivors die but the other two get out by gate, I consider that a loss. And by that metric, a group of survivors that plays well enough to stall thru all 5 gens has won. 
---
And it seems you're either misinterpreting what I say, or not reading my responses at all. Forcing survivors into an area with no resources is a positioning mistake, as most maps have enough resources to chain together loops long enough to stall out multiple generators. The only exceptions are maps like Shelter Woods in which the entire map can potentially be a dead zone, but that's because Shelter Woods is a bad map. And if you force a survivor into an area where pallets have already been used because they've used large numbers of them on the map, that's a resource mistake. 
---
A good SWF has at least 2 people survive 90% of the time.
---
Honestly they can let you leave but perhaps have it be that within the exit gate zone the timer ticks down faster. So endgame wise you only have half the time on a normal beartrap if you want to escape, since running through the exit gate area will tick it down by half rapidly.
---
The timing is very precise to be fair, half a second too early and you‚Äôll still blind them and they‚Äôll be able to walk around.
---
Because you replied negatively on my post yesterday, and now you are insulting OP, which is completely uncalled for.
---
Wow... I gave this guy a follow just for that move lol
---
Certainly not every one does, but if you can get someone further in the match and all you have to do is hide till you see the symbol get off of them, you have a better chance of escaping
---
It was a scummy exploit but at least it wasn't a massive waste of time like Piggy moonwalking
---
fucking killed my late game pig build *cries*
---
ATTENTION ALL ARTISTS, WHY THE FUCK ARENT YOU FIXING BUGS, STOP SLACKING, GET IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER AND CODE!!!!!
---
For fun?
---
I really like the end game collapse death animation for survivors but the ending of it is really anticlimactic for me. After crushing the survivor and stabbing them in head, instead of just opening the claws back up and having the survivor disappear, I really want to see the claws violently pull the survivor into the ground.
---
When you get sacrificed on hook, the entity comes from above to lift the dead survivor away. Since the entity comes from below for the collapse, I really think it should pull them into the ground. It would also hint at the entity being impatient and angrily snatching a kill instead of popping, killing the survivor and calmly letting them evaporate.
---
It's both crazy to me how much it bugs me that this isn't how it is and bewilders me that they didn't think of the same thing.
---
Also a unique locker animation would be brilliant. If lockers could actually be lifted, crushed and then stabbed before having the locker knocked over and the survivor pulled out the doors and into the ground... :o
---
Very unnecessary nerf to any already mid tier killer. Really hope this nerf doesn‚Äôt go through. Also, the Remember me should not be adjusted.
---
115% movement speed is plenty enough to end chases in a standard manner. It's when you go lower than that, where you need the extra help.
---
[removed]
---
Yeah, man.  Gotta take those edge cases into account where the Pig somehow downs someone with 30 seconds left in the EGC.
---
Open the flair menu &amp; click edit flair, then type anything
---
The legion changes show how stupidly disconnected from the game they are. Legion clearly needed some changes, but they completely destroyed them. Straight to Freddy tier. What an absolute waste. 
---
I really want to enjoy this game again, but the devs are doing everything they can to prevent that.
---
This is an advanced meme
---
He‚Äôs making a joke about not being able to see the camo lol
---
My steam name is boop I've gotten comments on my profile like +rep booped my nose and it makes my day everytime
---
Do you want your inbox filled with spiked electric dildos? Thats how you get your inbox filled with spiked electric dildos
---
Enduring, not like that hasn't been in the shrine before.... Also, all base game perks. Yuck.
---
I did say without being too oppressing. I was referring to Nurse. Granted I dont think she needs a nerf but not all killers should be balanced around Nurse.
---
Ideally they should be balanced around Billy in my opinion. Once you have that then you will see variety at high ranks.
---
Dedicated servers will not magically remove lag. All it will do is get rid of lag switchers.
---
You'll still get as much lag as you'd get to other people, only difference being that the killer will lag too now.
---
These events really make me fear Freddy‚Äôs rework
---
Ah, I thought it was probably just my timing.

The only bad pig change is how it is handled when dealing with End Game Collapse and the REQUIREMENT to start it via generator. If anything all it does is force you to put on traps throughout a match over putting every single one on at the last possible second. 
---
Her radius change is fine I feel as a pig should be stealthed often instead of what we see where pigs just M1 normally.
---
Aww man I loved going against the odd pig, but this is just going to be way to easy!
---
I'm not a fan of legion, dont get me wrong, but whats the point of mend wounds if it only counts down outside of terror radius. On top of that hitting twice doesnt make it go down. Might as well get rid of deep wounds all together. 
---
(maybe making the timer for fixing deep wounds much faster would make it an actual killer feature again...)
---
Mad grit works well with basement builds
---
That's exactly why they changed her. I honestly don't get the complaints as if you actually think about it, it makes perfect sense and only counts towards the last survivor. Killer closes hatch and powers the exit gates which does not power the generators. It would just be a free 4k for pigs if they didn't do this and not fun to play against.
---
The other change was her trap timer doesn't count down if you're in her terror radius, it no longer requires you to be in a chase which tbh is just bringing in line with the legion changes and means you can't just follow a survivor, deliberately not letting the game think you're in a chase for free kills. Pigs can still crouch after survivors here.
---
She's still just as good in my view.
---
Been wanting this for so long now! Give it to uuuus!
---
This was by far the worst parody
---
But then the ones you pressure just pallet loop as well.
---
I always just get "Thos flair is not available"
---
Five blink nurse is absolute garbage. Survivors run faster than a nurse chaining 5 blinks so it's safe to say everything else you say is kinda BS. 
---
Most survivors psych themselves out and play like hot garbage as soon as they hear the first blink in the map. Like, literally give up and forget what it's like to play.
---
Yeah I guess Myers and Pig were doing *too* well on that map...
---
Sheesh, within the past weeks killers have had Ruin, BBQ, and Nurses in the shrine. What an amazing timeline to start playing during that time.
---
It is not an insult. I thought their house looked depressing and I told him so. It was a joke because the topic is not home decor but rather Dead by Daylight so it is irreverent to criticize his home decor and not the Dead by Daylight content. Clearly humor is lost on most people, haha.
---
And I do not like..ever look at the usernames of people. So, no offense intended, but I do not remember you or what I said.
---
They said it probably won't happen because they don't know how a hood would work as a cosmetic.
---
I love you devs. Thank you.
---
no freddy is bad because u give them a 7 sec head start
---
I can't believe anyone at all thinks bhvr is a good dev.
---
You have to type in it first
---
I wouldn't know. Killer are being so freaking tryhard that we rarely get to see endgame.  
---
They don't lose their add ons on their main account, so they're burning them in PTB to be massive douche bags instead of actually trying out the endgame.
---
The people saying BBQ isn't "that good" are killer mains who are full of shit and don't want to admit that it's a ridiculously OP, and dare I say.. "crutch perk." Auto wall hacks/GPS on hooks And double points every game? It speaks for itself.. Lol.. Still though.. Never leave home without it!!
---
Thank you entity! I was just working on the Nurse but I'm really bad on console with her or it's just to challenging. Nurse's Call shall be mine!!!
---
***Listen man you don't know how I live.***
---
Really? Just have her put the hood down when you equip another head cosmetic. Not that hard.
---
ok
---
Except me bc who cares about pig??
---
I think the pig needed more of a change instead of a nerf, i think that her pre traps might‚Äôve been a bit strong for end game but this is quite a lot for an already B/C+ tier killer.
---
What is happening to legion I like them
---
So? There are lots of near impossible to win scenarios for killer to, I don't see magic mechanic changes coming to hand them free kills. In fact, the only one that does is a perk that gets no end of hate.
---
God forbid the killer outplays an entire survivor team and puts the last one in an almost impossible situation to win, noooo we can't have that. Sorry if that sounds super biased to you, fwiw, I'd remove NOED if I were given the chance.  
---
But the Pig putting you into a tough situation due to RBTs is part of her uniquness and yeah, you might have some games where you will have to "just die". So what? Killers have games where survivors spawn next to ruin, then proceed to complete all gens in 4 minutes and get 0 kills. As many survivor mains have said: "gg ez baby killer, git gud".
---
while that is true its misleading because nurse and billy are the best killers in the game a plague without perks and a legion without perks are about the same and wrath and trapper without perks are still worse he needs add-ons to be good but thats the same with most killers they put out
---
I wish I could upvote this more than once.
---
Edit: no mither
---
Does any other cosmetic work like that, that would probably require a new system just for one cosmetic. Why work hard for one cosmetic or compromise and have the community enraged because they think they are being cheated.
---
Quentin and Ace easily. 
---
Tapp doesn‚Äôt have the best perks but they can be useful. Especially the one that gives away where the totems are. 
---
 
---
I think Huntress has probably the worst killer wise.
---
They won't know about the couple pallets you got the other person to use.  You cannot overcommit to chases unless you want to lose every game.  If you can't down them efficiently get them to toss whatever pallet you're at, break it then leave to pressure gens.
---
I know how to use her dash and I know traps are best for mid-game. Point is, the option to have the traps for end game is now completely gone and the rare chance of actually getting kills with it has dropped because survivors are gonna know as long as they stay in your TR they‚Äôre safe from the countdown. The new end game collapse would‚Äôve been a very nice buff for pig that still kept her very balanced but gave her a bit of an edge. The point is that she‚Äôs one of the only killers who didn‚Äôt NEED to be nerfed and she was given NOTHING to make up for the nerfs.
---
Survivors can just sprint from box to box while flipping you off and laughing because simply being near the killer stops the timer which was already plenty of time before this change and that included  time spent trying to to be found.
---
Now with this having a bear trap means ez loops and if the pig hopes the trap gets any progression the KILLER is now denied an entire area, and its super easy to removed the trap because you can hit up all the boxes in under  minute.
---
I think the attitude of "survivors can never be truly 'done'" is starting to ruin this game. As you point out; the scenario where it's going to happen is pretty specific and won't be common. And if it is....so what? Killer worked hard to get to that point and the survivors got outplayed. Deal with it and die to the trap or get hooked and sacrificed.
---
Yeah but people will do stuff like that that wastes a lot of time just to be scummy, that's why basement body blocking exists :/
---
You can't legally "own" a character that walks between dimensions. That's not how copyright or law works. Nothing was plagiarized.
---
I actually just played against a dev in the ptb lol. He was a legion. They do play their game in the public environment. You just want to talk shit because you're angry. I get it, but don't spew bullshit.
---
Well they could certainly add more cosmetics like that. Obviously I want them to work on the more glaring issues right now, but once that‚Äôs done, I don‚Äôt see any reason why this can‚Äôt be added.
---
Considering the survivors get nerfed in almost every other patch, I welcome this one.
---
Caboose for new killer.
---
Its allot to explain but ill try to shorten it their ma went up to base killer ms the frenzy must be full to use if you miss its over deep wounds dont go down in his terror radious that got upped to normall killer terror radious legion cant see the depletion of deep wounds hitting them in frenzy wont make it go down  their sprint is slower then before their vault is slower i think i got it all
---
If you think he's better you're objectively wrong. Sorry dude there's no defending this one. Normal movement speed does not a good killer make.
---
Hes bad because his power littrely does shit all and doesnt HELP at all. 
---
Legion's new power is the same. Every other power at least does something.
---
Nah that was 5
---
But it‚Äôs not that‚Äôs the thing. Another redditor did a study of 500 rbt 50% got them off the first box of the rest 50% got it off on the second box and so on and like 3% dc‚Äôed and very few died to it.
---
You had trust for the devs in the first place? Fool
---
Basically when the exit gates are powered on (or the Pig closes the hatch) to trigger End Game Collapse, reverse bear traps that weren't activated by powering on generators stay inactive.  It makes it so the Pig can't just hold onto RBTs for the endgame and force people to stick around in that state of the game where they want to push people out of the match if there isn't a Survivor on hook.  
---
So the Pig can still have RBTs on Survivors and have the last generator trigger them to turn on, but after that point RBTs won't be capable of getting activated.  
---
And people are flipping their heads off about it because it means the Pig can't secure endgame kills by forcing Survivors to stick around.
---
Honestly I‚Äôve been sticking up for the devs because Mathieu is a really cool guy and I‚Äôd like to believe he‚Äôs trying his best to improve the game, but I keep getting more and more disheartened. I‚Äôm gonna stick out a little bit longer, because I really do love this game and I want to see it succeed in the long run.
---
That‚Äôs why I defended the exit gate change, because that‚Äôs the only change for pig I thought she needed. She has always been, and probably will be, a lower tier killer, and definitely deserved some buffs to compliment her lack of endgame usefulness.
---
&gt;I have never seen a pig patrol without crouching
---
I mean cross map patrolling. I crouch near gens I know they‚Äôll be at, not around the map. It saves time.
---
&gt;traps still have a purpose, they slow the game down
---
Did...you even read what I said? I said they‚Äôre useless in ENDGAME not at anytime.
---
Also, 3 minutes is a lot longer than you think. All they need to do is slow the timer down when a surv has an rbt on.
---
Honestly if you want to be scummy as piggy vera a lot better ways than just mood walking someone with reverse bear trap.
---
Body blocking them until the timer goes off much more efficient method then moonwalking hell as I stated before outright camping them is more efficient method.
---
can someone confirm that the changes in the ptb aren‚Äôt final. until the mid chapter actually releases
---
Eww i didn't understand. That cost me 4 free downvotes i dunno why
---
‚ÄúNot my fault, someone put a wall In my way‚Äù
---
orphan niggas be like
---
√òink
---
I don‚Äôt care about legion. But I like piggy, she a lot more fun to play against :(
---
You can argue about it all you want but all the Killer mains see right now is "OMG PIG NERFED".
---
Probably because many of them relied on a lategame Pig build that forced folks to stick around.
---
Damn there‚Äôs a lot of killer mains fucking whiiiining üòÇ
---
This seems like such an obvious thing to me. I used to play both equally but for the past few months I've mained survivor and this just seems obvious, especially having played the Pig and knowing how key, end game bear traps can be.
---
On the one hand, I really understand it since the collapse puts a timer on everyone so it's not fair having the traps double up as a death timer with no way out while she just patrols boxes. On the other, could they not just freeze or severely reduce the end game collapse timer if someone has an active bear trap on their head? Make it a bit more risk/reward and letting pigs choose what kind of end game they want: collapse or bear traps.
---
never :) thank god
---
&gt; Being told to "stop gen rushing and cleanse totems" isn't really an argument.
---
It's a perfectly good one :) and you saying it isn't just because is what isn't an argument actually :)
---
Likewise, there is an obscenely high number of survivors who don't understand the optimal way to play against the Pig once a trap is on their head, which leads to the game unnecessarily slowing down in the first place.
---
Like I said, any good player gets rid of there traps long before end game cause that is what is best and also the rare occurrence of getting kills was indeed rare, they removed the randomisation to it, you should always be able to get them off as intended, which is good for survivors. Nothing about this change affects a pig wanting to play well and equally dish out a fun experience for both sides. She was also recently buffed like 2 patches ago to make her base kit much better, she is being tweaked to become a very balanced and fun killer to go against.
---
It‚Äôs logical but it‚Äôs so sad
---
Bubba is definitely not Freddy tier. Why you always lying. Not even Trapper is Freddy tier.
---
You'r pretty obviously at really low ranks. ofc it's better there. BBQ isn't nearly as good a Nurse's or Bitter Murmur
---
I‚Äôve done this but that was when the spirit was new and I didn‚Äôt know what haunted grounds did and I learned very quickly. My teammates we pissed!
---
Quit spammin your gay ass shit on Twitter. Put that shit in a shoebox.
---
He is super strong, but there is some counterplay to him. Maybe he needs a nerf, but I think he is a lot closer to the proper power level of a killer than Nurse is. Even if she is hard to play, those that are good on her are basically unbeatable while using good addons.
---
&gt; ridiculously OP,
---
lmfao
---
I don't even use it on my two main killers fammy fambam
---
Like I'm okay with dying for the greater good. But it isnt a worthy sacrifice if nothing gets done at all
---
The twist is that the Entity was working for Jigsaw the whole time!
---
Then the person you originally chased hops on a gen and then you're back to square one again.
---
Might work at low ranks but at rank 1-2 survivors will just repair gens right in front of you if you're chasing.
---
Upvoted sinply because of how critical and objective you are in discussion which is a breathe of fresh air. Please dont change.
---
Bye *waves*
---
Wait there isn't? Yikes, I'm not sure I'll even be able to play any more if that's the case
---
This is silk
---
apparently they arent known for paying attention to their player base...
---
otherwise you would be correct considering they JUST now released this today
---
Which is a rip from figuratively hundreds of games, movies, and books
---
This sub freaked out about the Legion changes though
---
Pig changes are unfortunate and need to be re-assessed. Legion is fine now. You can still get an almost free first hit, killers instinct gives you some decent tracking, you're 115% so you can play tiles normally. His power isn't special or exciting, but it isn't absolute bullshit. He's boring but fine now. A couple things weren't totally necessary, like removing the ability to see blood, but my \~6 hour impression is that he's fine.
---
Yeah, shes weak *now*, cant wait to see how she goes after this shit lol.
---
I made a Question thread on here 2 days ago about the same thing and these were all the responses I got, so yeah I DO have to specify this shit.
---
Just leave next time dude the sub doesn't need more posts like this.
---
Maybe it‚Äôs because EGC is useless. It‚Äôs a ton of survivor buffs disguised as a cool game change
---
Yeah no. Tell me what's the last major survivor nerf that wasnt a fix to a clearly not fair mechanic like pallet vacuum.
---
Well the problem is that she got nerfed and they didn't give her anything in return, it's just unfortunate because she isn't even a top tier killer.
---
They don't care they've proven that time and time again, as detailed by your post. Sorry dude you're preaching to the choir.
---
Lmao
---
So rbt is useless now.
---
That definitely goes for most other killers, but Pig was one of the few who had options at that point, she could use the trapped survivor as bait to put traps on more survivors, or just count on the trap to keep them inside while she caught other survivors. Now she has nothing to do but camp like every other killer.
---
How is Bitter Murmur in any way better? General rule as a killer is you should nearly always be chasing someone. If i‚Äôm chasing someone I don‚Äôt have time to look at completed gens to see where they are running to because i‚Äôm too busy. BBQ shows you your next target when you don‚Äôt have a next move.
---
Yup
---
yup. I remember writing a long statement about how players were gonna walk backwards, and use Bloodhound while playing Legion (during the PTB).  And i wasnt the only one. Im pretty sure I could find it if i wanted too.
---
These changes weren't even to the powerful killers though. Making RBTs less effective, nerfing Legion into the ground, etc doesn't fix any balance issues, it just means we see more Billys and Nurses, who are just as strong as ever. If that's what you want, okay, but as a survivor main I'm not looking forward to the lack of killer variety we'll be seeing going forward.
---
Plus I feel like P3 Squadettes will waste no time finding ways to turn it against non-tunneling Pigs, mostly just by BMing, flashlight spamming, and giving out ggez's in post-match because the Killer was sensical enough not to tunnel the one person not doing gens lol
---
Spirit - She exists fully in the "Spirit World". This means that she can't see survivors or generator auras, and they can't see her. Her power is to temporarily be able to see survivors scratches and blood. Once her power is exhausted, she's stunned for ~15 seconds, during which time all survivors can see and interact with her. If a survivor interacts with the spirit, they "bind" her temporarily. This bind means that all survivors continue to see her, and her power doesn't regenerate for the next 45 seconds. In addition, she stops hearing survivor actions, and all aura reading abilities are disabled. In exchange, she "enrages" once the bind has been lifted, which increases her movement speed to 118%, and she can temporarily see Wraith-style illusions of the survivors. This lasts 30 seconds, and damaging a survivor ends it.
---
Shape - Stalking a survivor now builds charges of "evil attention" on them. This "evil attention" draws The Shape's attention. He will refuse to attack any survivor besides the one he has fixed his attention on. One charge requires stalking for 15 seconds, and is expended when the survivor is damaged. Interrupting the stalk by ending the power usage or having the survivor leave his vision will reset the timer. Only one survivor can receive attention at a time, and the only way to discharge attention is through damaging them.
---
Clown - Removed the visual effects of being intoxicated, and lowered his bottle reload speed.
---
PlAgIaRiZeD!!1!
---
You're basically the entity
---
But she's special ); . I remember seeing the DLC and being hyped AF , especially that i didn't know any of the other killers before DbD .
---
I really hate that their idea of fun for killers means not playing well and not getting kills.
---
Somehow it makes complete sense their balancing for survivors that everything is targeted towards improving their chance to escape or improving their ability to fight against things they complain about like camping and "tunneling".
---
But when it comes to killers they think hitting everybody a bunch of times, getting 2 hooks per person, no kills, and likely looped around the entire match is "fun" because somehow that means you got lots of BP.
---
Their comment about not needing to make strong killers just made me quit killer as well, it's not worth it as it's better to play the side the devs favour.
---
Hmm didn‚Äôt know that, I don‚Äôt look at all spirit much cause I associated it with trash, Which yeah it still is pretty bad.
---
A lit totem alrwady makes sound though
---
Wow that looks awesome! How did you make it?
---
Dude there are nerfs for survivors in every single patch, get out of here üòÇ go read some old patch notes.
---
his power will show you every survivor in your your TR and will give you a free hit free hits are worth alot
---
I could go for a couple *Hazy Reagents*.
---
 You're damn right I have no faith in them. 
---
Survs get better, every killer that's not nurse/billy get gutted and nerfed to oblivion.
---
* laughs in saboteur * b
---
but really, it's awesome
---
She quit the hookers, shes a survivor now.
---
As a Trapper main I'm always thinking "where's the love for their poster child? ;-:" Agree though 100%
---
Legion is beginning to feel a lot like Freddy to me because of one issue: he's just not at all fun to play against. It doesn't matter how good you are and how bad the killer may be, these are not fun killers to go against. Having to mend or wake up all game is incredibly boring and then for Legion, the sprinting and vaulting is a bit annoying to go up against alongside that, especially when inflicting deep would reveals nearby survivors.
---
I think Behaviour are trying to see if rebalancing Legion can make them more fun to play both as and against. There's obviously things you can do to counter both but playing against them doesn't seem to make anyone happy and with how bad hitboxes are these days, these issues become all the more frustrating for survivors.
---
It's tough designing stuff to be fun for both sides and I think this is a big reason survivors have been complaining about Legion so much. For myself and everyone I've played with, we know we're in for a game that just isn't going to be fun as soon as we see a Legion. With other killers there's maybe a bit of dread or even an "oh cool!" but with Legion it's just groans. Every time we win against this killer, there's no satisfaction, just emptiness inside.
---
Billy and nurse are so so easy to counter and I enjoy playing against them considering I rarely see them.
---
So sad, I actually like piggy
---
that and ur flair lmao
---
Missed attack will instantly give ew3 tombstone ftoh to all survivors
---
I'm new to survivor, should I buy sprint burst or wait for another perk?
---
Making room for the crapper

‚ÄúI‚Äôm heading to the store. Y‚Äôall need anything?‚Äù
---
Legions Vault speed is a fucking joke now, it looks like the whole wold slows down while you take your time to drag yourself over the pallet
---
Can't they keep dedicated and p2p and people can pick which way they wanna play? That way they can get matched with close p2p players so everyone in Australia can use that, I'm assuming same for African countries.
---
This is against the movie did u ever see anyone escaping with RBT in their head in any part of SAW movie?
---
Just to clarify what I'm saying, here is an example:
---
If you play Legion in the PTB right now, and you are going around massacring everyone with basic M1s, that doesn't mean he's good.  That means the survivors are bad.  You would've won that game regardless of which M1 Killer you were playing.
---
They could even use the convenient Outfit button on the left to actually use full outfits that override most/all cosmetic slots.
---
Neat
---

You're stating opinions and calling them facts. Big difference.  A two minute check on Steam charts shows a much different story then the garbage you're trying to pander.  DbD population has always fluctuated right where it is.  We're actually up from last month.
---
That's not including console players.
---
So do us a favor, do and show the research or keep your fly by night "facts" to yourself.  Its disinformation at it's best.
---
Well they're too busy nerfing legion to the ground so they point out that opening a locker while in feral frenzy was a bug to be fixed while they forgot that legion is still interacting with gens when his power is active. Be careful what you call a bug, BHVR.
---
If you use it. You're going around walking all game, thus wasting time. Try Dead Hard, it's no the same, but it has at least 2 uses.
---

---
I would be fine with everything, until you see how long it takes for them to use their power, the discount nurse stun that is aweful, and always four seconds, and the fact that vaulting feels terrible.
---
not unless you're connecting to japan
---
thanks.  I actually really appreciate your comment.  
---
anytime I see something up for debate, I make an effort to understand both points of view and just keep my mind open.  plus when you speak about things objectively, it's easier to prove a point.  when you use opinions or emotions, things can get unconvincing really fast.
---
Why start the timer when the gate opens rather than when the last gen is done is beyond me.
---
It's not remotely, it's about the most backwards solution to the possible problems that would've needed fixing.
---
Pig's gonna be too good at keeping survivors from escaping during the collapse. Should we make the collapse slower while someone is trapped, like we do for hooks? Nah just make her traps useless if used at the end of the game, let's remove her ability to pressure traps at all while we're at it.
---
What about pig closing the hatch and then just tunneling a trapped survivor so they can't escape whatsoever, shall we fix that too? Of course not, just remove all strategy involving her traps so no one will play her, then we won't even need to fix that.
---
A free hit that does literally nothing
---
I agree completely and i practice this behaviour every day also
---
I think ur missing the point... they didn‚Äôt just change the pig, they turned her into fucking bacon. She isn‚Äôt just nerfed, she‚Äôs nearly gutted. How can u say this is ok when at collapse, half of her entire kit is fucking WORTHLESS! And that‚Äôs only at collapse! What about the Legion treatment to her RBTs? Those things barely killed before, but now they are just metallic hats! So yeah I expected a change, but to this extent? They only needed to tweak the timer mechanic at endgame to make it balanced. This was too much.
---
Thank you.
---
lol no. Decisive strike was nerfed, that's about it.
---
It promotes her to use her traps before the end game. Most pigs would just camp survivors with traps in the end game before the update, so its good to see it prevented. 
---
Fuck the pig.
---
It‚Äôs mostly about the power helping you chase. Any power that guarantees extra hooks and downs instantly puts more pressure on the map and allows you to get an early kill to snowball. The top killers are so strong because they get an extremely strong power that boosts kill potential immensely or either boost its enough along with base move speed to give them disproportional strength compared to others. Some of the powers are just inherently worse and only providing a movement boost wouldn‚Äôt solve really anything in the grand scheme of things. It would just clown and cannibal to be high tier and still leave the others behind since their power is lent just mechanically similar to the high tier powers we know already.
---
I mean when you consider that the top 3 are the only ones that are viable at that rank assuming equal skilled players...its not surprising that they get picked a lot.
---
All people are asking for is for a killer to feel strong without having to be massively better than the opposing survivor team to get that strong feeling.
---
If I were to get a 4k on Trapper because all of my opponents were potatoes and fell for obvious trap spots that doesnt tell me trapper is OP. That tells me that I knew placements and common movement zones way better than the opposing team. 
---
Killer requires a ridiculous amount of knowledge about the game to simply do "OK" and the devs seem to want to make killers pretty weak with interesting powers.
---
The latest example is the plague who honestly would have been fine with the PTB version. Right now she feels like a worse huntress imo because you have to run up and puke then puke again till they are broken, or you know you could just huntress hatchet it and end the chase quite a bit faster.
---
If a killer is not strong dont expect people to enjoy playing them because nobody likes to be stomped.
---
Killers: Endgame collapse looks good! Can‚Äôt wait to have a better end game. BHVR: But wait there‚Äôs more! How about a dead pig and a remember me nerf? Killers: Fuck
---
Freddy rework should be ready by 2023
---
I really hope we stay p2p too. My mates and I definitely won‚Äôt be playing nearly as much if we have to connect to Asia
---
Sure, the traps aren't built to kill, making the timer stop does not make them take the hat off any faster, if you really wanted to, you can push them off a box if you are near by, but you need to be engaged in a chase for that anyway so it makes no difference. I am not sure what you mean by her crouch not being a valid excuse, the crouch is her main power, if used correctly it speaks for itself.
---
You made the claim. Why dont you back it up and tell me what was the big change that was just totally unfair?
---
Fuck the what?
---
The main issue is how it works with perks, it‚Äôs just not in the games balance currently to work with that without an overhaul to pretty much any movement speed buff perk. Noed on these killers would be an absolute nightmare with that movespeed bonus, especially with people who do have a fundamentally good power such as hillbilly and clown.
---
Yep, I agree. Unless we stay p2p my mates and I definitely won‚Äôt be playing.
---
Amazing how nobody takes the time to break totems isnt it...
---
Now make a tiny leatherface to stand 6 inches from it
---
I can see the endgame change but at least give her something to compensate and not another nerf
---
IKR corn blindness is a real thing for Killers and its absolutely terrible, especially someone who relies on sight to know where to sling axes to make use of their power  #NationalCornBlindnessAwarenessMonth
---
I play on ps4, so nurse is pretty much unplayable, but on PC, everyone complains that it's pretty much always nurses who play at rank 1, so this nerf is just to reduce the amount that this killer gets played, while also still being welcoming to new nurses.
---
I thought about making figures but sounds tough for my skillü§î
---
Noed is a crutch perk that takes no skill and offers a huge reward. Survivor mains should just cleanse totems if they're so fucking scared of it, and killers shouldnt bitch when it gets destroyed quickly. Both sides are fucking annoying
---
I'm sorry, but I'm kind of confused about the point here. What exactly are you trying to say?
---
Ultra-rare offering
---
Yet good SWF's are still too much for every single killer but the nurse
---
If it lasts 3 minutes with hook delays it should most definitely start when the gens are powered.
---
If it happens as it does now why not just make it a minute after the gates are open? If a survivor opens it at the wrong time they punish the whole team and it's fair bc it was a bad play.
---
If they did it right it should give them a minute to escape.
---
Maybe if the hatch was closed it should be 2 minutes or if the gates were opened by the killer but 3 minutes to get out when you open the gates is so excessive it isnt even really a threat. I'm not gonna be panicking if the endgame collapse starts lol.
---
Honestly though, why can't the Pig's power be exceptional 1-v-1 death trap? Why can't there be a killer who's strength lies in the late game?
---
Don't worry. You can still be flashlight blinded through it.
---
How else do you expect the baby reddit killers to get kills?
---
That would encourage the kill to camp gates though.
---
Probably the type to report a Billy for using his chainsaw. Or bubba with BBQ for "wall hacking" or a nurse for "glitching through walls"
---
Literally all you have to do is go read old patch notes. I don‚Äôt have the time, nor the interest, to go and name off things for an argument with some stranger on the internet. It‚Äôs pointless. Lmao
---
I think u missed the point. If a survivor is NEAR regardless of chase, the timer STOPS. Meaning, any way of pressure or herding becomes useless. This makes the RBT way less threatening. I have seen the arguement of the crouch countering this nerf, but this is also false, as while yes u can move around silently while allowing the timer to tick, u move way to slow to herd effectively.
---
I think their "logic" is to prevent survivors from being doomed, and to always have a chance.  Considering how weak Pig already was, I think it's a stupid and unnecessary change, but what do I know?  I've only played the game since the saveme beta.
---
Pigs cant be stealthed often because her move speed is abysmally low.
---
I agree with low. You are a very stupid person for thinking people are sleeping on that legion nerf.
---
i had no idea about any of this, and im really upset now. i'm a pig main, and the pig isn't the best killer out there anyways. this is basically a small nerf. not a big nerf that ruins the character, but a small nerf that really sucks. they only listen to the survivors, and most of the time these changes only benefit them. what are they going to do next, remove all of the killer's powers because they're "too" op?
---
When you're watching porn and you look down :(
---
I just think it‚Äôs unfair that DS got reworked but NOED didn‚Äôt. BHVR listens only to killer mains
---
Yup lol. 2 hexes in one picture.
---
But Billy would be 115 movement speed still.
---
NOED I would just simply remove the speed boost or make it be a speed boost for a few seconds like adrenaline.
---
delete this
---
That‚Äôs my next goal
---
They may eventually add something to buff her.
---
They only removed her rbt power from end game, you can still ambush and use her rbt power to slow the game down.
---
What the actual hell is wrong with Legion being able to search lockers in frenzy?
---
I noticed this too, made a post referencing it earlier, [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bg6x2d/new\_david\_skin\_makes\_me\_want\_to\_tend\_the\_rabbits/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bg6x2d/new_david_skin_makes_me_want_to_tend_the_rabbits/)
---
You're blowing it off as if it's just "a small phase", the guy literally harrassed young girls for nudes. If a guy is accused of rape (of which that is an actual form of), it ruins his life, and that's only if he's ACCUSED, rapists rarely change, I doubt he has as well, and if I'm wrong, I still dislike his toxic behavior, he kills the game and makes people think that toxicity is good. He's put a huge dent in the community, and he will likely continue expand that dent. Not only is he a bad person personally, he's a bad influence for the game itself. He's the main reason so many people left the community, and if he drives enough people away, Behavior won't make any profit from the game, and without that, they will shut it down, and NO other game is like Dead By Daylight. Friday the 13th is comparable... but in the long run, isn't even close to being as good. Are we really gonna throw Dead By Daylight away because someone who is really good blinded a few people and made them think he's really cool? Or are we gonna stand up to him and stop his toxicity?
---
That‚Äôs super cool üòçüòçüòçüòç
---
‚ÄúBHVR listens only to killer mains.‚Äù Are u sure about that?
---
F
---
Its more of the fact they did nerf her for no reason.
---
The one who is providing the prizes is a streamer. We don't have confirmation yet, but we are looking into it, to see if he can stream it.
---
Real talk, the color of the ground cracks are too close to that of scratch marks, very easy to confuse the two (esp early on during the collapse because the cracks are much smaller).
---
They should've went with a yellow color, which would thematically match the Entity's influence such as on the legacy prestige skins, and wouldn't impact a core part of tracking survivors as killer, especially in such a crucial phase of the game.
---
The legion nerf was needed, but not at the extent it was done at. Legion quickly became one of the worst killers
---
Yeah, a lot of Dbd are in or have graduated High School, and Of Mice &amp; Men is still being read in High Schools.
---
They needed to change something for end game collapse, but the terror radius thing is pretty dumb though I‚Äôll agree on that
---
You realize that you are losing Emblem points right? That means you won‚Äôt be ranking up quickly.
---
It's not an argument because you can't just queue up solo and expect your teammates to cleanse. There is literally a 1/10 chance in having every totem cleansed when playing alone. There's also no way to keep track of how many are cleansed when playing alone. So again, "gen rushing" isn't a valid argument when it's the only viable thing to do. By the time you actually cleanse all the totems, 2 of your teammates are dead and there's probably 3-5 gens up.
---
If someone took a vacation on the BBQ shrine week, he will insta suicide
---
Literally nothing about the change affects her ability to tunnel, in fact it only reinforces it.
---
She used to be able to pressure the boxes while still not devoting herself to the survivor, just encourage them to search a box further away. It was the one way she could influence the traps to make them even remotely more threatening, still not likely to kill, but likely to make the survivor more pressed for time and less able to do other things.
---
If a pig wants to tunnel on the other hand, they're just chasing the trapped person and gaining no benefit from the trap besides the inability to leave through the gates. Because she can now close hatches, there's absolutely nothing you can do when you're being tunneled with a trap, and that's a whole 'nother kind of bullshit.
---
Determining how to pressure the boxes and whether to save the traps was a big part of the macro game with her. Now the only way for her to interact with her own power is to tunnel, which means entirely ignoring what her power actually does.
---
I wish they fixed trap tunneling as pig, I hate pigs that tunnel, it ruins the character for the rest of us. All they did though is ruin the power for the people who did try to make good use of it.
---
Relax dude it‚Äôs a meme.
---
&gt; hogwash 
---
heh.
---
hopefully we'll be able to choose on which server we want to play on, because i'm in colombia (SA) and if i get placed in the server in sao pablo i'll get 200+ ms instead of the NA server that usually gives me 90 to 150 ms
---
Another one bites the dust.
---
This is completely ignoring why people mostly play Billy or Nurse at rank 1....
---
Make sure when they release the PTB survey you bitch and moan as loud as possible about The Pig nerf. I‚Äôm talking all caps boys. 
---
All Piggies rise up! *Revolutionary Oink* üêΩ
---
I watched zubat play some new legion. He seems ok now but I don't think he was versing the best survivors when he was playing. I definitely don't think its the end of the world for legion like when the changes were announced but time will tell.
---
The unfortunate thing is that the devs likely wouldn't fix the power seeing as how long it has taken to get Freddy, the arguably worst killer, a rework.
---
And to be honest I'm skeptical of that rework, I highly doubt it'll actually be strong.
---
it wasn't a super serious suggestion either, it was more of "lol this might work or it might not".
---
They didn‚Äôt need to gut half her kit in the final moments of the game. They should have just tweaked the endgame timer while traps are in play.
---
Sure, concentrate on only that part of the sentence.
---
They haven‚Äôt gutted half her kit though, the changes aren‚Äôt live, the point of the PTB is to test things out and see how the community likes it. They will change her accordingly to how the community has reacted
---
I‚Äôm just saying, those Pig changes weren‚Äôt made by killer mains
---
An absolute shit version of Whispers which will most of the time be working with only one Survivor and is easily counterable because the timer is now immensely huge in addition to being easily taken off.
---
Do you really spend shards on BP? 150k BP is like 4 games of killer.
---
Is there a reason people don't like my comment, it means the same thing as the top reply here lol
---
Didn't they slightly change how cosmetics work specifically for Ash tho
---
Kind of a bummer that now the decision between using traps early to slow survivors down or the end game to keep them trapped in has now devolved into "use traps before survivors start end game collapse or else you lose your RBT utility".
---
I‚Äôll believe that when I see it... BHVR doesn‚Äôt have the best balancing track record...
---
Just due on the hook next time smh
---
"RBTs only become active whenever a generator is completed. Inactive RBTs will no longer trigger when attempting to leave via an exit gate. *NOTE: Initiating the End Game Collapse will not complete generators, but will block them. This means that any inactive RBTs will remain inactive. The RBT timer now stops if the Survivor is within the Terror Radius, as opposed to when in a Chase."
---
Directly from the patch notes.
---
What else would i do with them? I have both killer perks so why not get some free BP?
---
I really like how self care is out of the meta now tbh, better than any killer perk at making killers win.
---
What‚Äôs the source of this, for scientific reasons of course
---
I tended to avoid NOED as pig. 
---
Survivors would leave instantly when faced with NOED whereas without it survivors would be altruistic and if I played it right I could put another trap on a head, and potentially more kills.
---
All trapped Survivors gain a free RBT cosmetic when escaping.
---
*Survivors horrifically stabbed and maimed in front of your very eyes, screaming in pain*
---
"Beautiful."
---
Can you find all 5 totems in time, quickly, in the swamp map? Or do you think you‚Äôre jeopardizing your whole game by searching for 5 totems, and not rescuing your teammates or contributing in any way because you‚Äôre too busy searching for 5 totems on that map?
---
I'm tempted to do it myself for a suicide build.
---
Corn which also hinders killers?
---
How about this: Deep wounds go slower while in terror radius? Also the second one is good.
---
Freddy was alright before they nerfed him for zero reason on release. I feel like most of the killers are just left as gimmicks and they could really care less about balance at this point so I doubt we will really see any major buffs unless end game collapse makes them suddenly start caring more about balance.
---
Gotta use Make Your Choice and NOED
---
This is a little harsh but they do need to do something, rbts arent fair during endgame collapse
---
It‚Äôs gonna suck on console with the frame drops, although I think they buffed aim assist since my screen sometimes turns like 60 degrees to face a survivor, so maybe that‚Äôs what they did?
---
That‚Äôs cool too.
---
That's where Remember Me and Blood Warden come into play!
---
But yes, I understand, and that makes sense.
---
Not after the animal cruelty we have witnessed today
---
*steps in crap*
---
Oh crap
---
*dc*
---
Use it to run to BHVR HQ to tell them to stop killing pigs!
---
That's not a Claudette!

---
Okay I'm fairly new to the game and haven't played hillbilly or nurse, if I could get only one of either Nurse's calling or Enduring which one should I get?
---
&gt; I literally can't see the logic behind this change. 
---
It was done to remove a possible situation in which a lone survivor, after the hatch was closed, could have no chance of escape if they had an RBT on. Can't leave via the gates, no hatch, time limit until their death. 
---
Not necessarily a likely situation, but that's what I gather from it. Is it justified? Mostly still no since that's negatively impacting a large part of the character due to a fringe case, but that's why I think they did it.
---
I actually think it's be nice if there was a totem counter for all of the survivors. I'm normally not a huge fan if NOED but the end game is so boring and M1 killers have such a hard time keeping up with the game that I find myself using it more and more. 
---
It's even worse now because this pointless end game collapse just makes the gate faster and nerfs remember me. You'll see NOED more now and honestly rightfully so.
---
This is beautiful and true :‚Äô(
---
Enduring or Nurse's calling?
---
The closest we have is Asia Pacific, so still not close by any stretch.
---
No
---
Wow those are excellent points.
---
Don‚Äôt @me like this, my lvl 3 billy getting his chainsaws then running around hitting walls üòÇ
---
It's kinda an embarrassment that 3/4 of the killers they were given a license for are garbage now through unnecessary nerfs or overall were just designed poorly. What an absolute waste of good licensed characters.
---
If you‚Äôre gonna play a M1 killer that needs to eat pallets a lot I‚Äôd say Enduring. But, Nurses takes level 40 Nurse while Enduring only takes level 30 Hillbilly. So I‚Äôd probably get Nurses from the Shrine and just get Billy to level 30 for the teachable cause it‚Äôs less blood points to spend :)
---
I doubt it. Face camping has a wonderful counter. Skill.
---
can't imagine how shitty it must be for Oceania
---
What‚Äôs your rank and connection?
---
Its a little harsh but rbts need a rework for endgame collapse. Imagine endgame collapse is happening and you have an rbt on and have 3 minutes to escape but need it off. You get unlucky and have to check every box along. Hopefully you dont come across the killer, since you are panic running to every box bc youhave limited time. If yoy do run into them you are probably injured so gg. If you dont hopefully by the time its off you can get to a gate and the killer isnt by it, to bad you cant heal bc you will die due to your limited time. All this is without mentioning the pig could have add ons that make searching boxes take longer. So imo either way something needs to be changed
---

Ew normie meme
---
Okay... Okay
---
I get it
---
She might be too strong with the EGC because she can just use all of her RBT's at the end
---
That sure is a problem isn't it?
---
But really... Is that the best they have came up with?
---
Lemme try I'm not a game dev or anything
---
Let's see
---
What if she started the match with 1 RBT and she can't hold more than 1 at a time
---
When she uses her RBT she can go to jigsaw boxes and get another one(Each box has a RBT next to it) 
---
That way the pig has to use RBT's as soon as possible
---
Because you need to get to your jigsaw boxes each time u want to use an RBT which makes them more risky to use during end game 
---
So that encourages pig to use them when she has the chance which would fix the issue without killing off the character
---
The problems with that is
---
Its might be confusing to remember which jigsaw box still has a RBT next to it and which one doesn't
---
Different color auras would solve that tho
---
Another problem is there are add-ons that makes it so there are more boxes or make u start with more RBT's combining these might be too strong but pretty sure it's easier to balance an addon so I'm leaving that to the real devs
---
So was self care not that I ever used it. For no legit reason at all. Guess nurses calling was too hard to put on.
---
Probably Myers. With NOED, Haunted Ground, Make Your Choice and Iron Maiden.
---
yup

I watched Scott steamroll survivors for hours today with Legion on Twitch. The changes are find.

Nah. Nerf if it to at most 30 secs for tier 3 full stacks.
---
THIS! Thank you!
---
Remember, this sub is loudest when killers get nerfed. Lot of killer mains here. Everyone was fine with the DS nerfs but "no don't touch my NOED".
---
Yeah thats reaching. (I mean, BHVR, not you) 
---
What about the TR change then? Because she can moonwalk? It doesnt make any sense at all. Why would a pig spend 3 minutes moonwalking for a kill (where she could just facecamp instead lol)
---
I guess. But remember me, if unchanged, would dominate.
---
Lol you clearly hit the tree first this is more of an issue of hitboxes 
---
I would have dc‚Äôd too
---
Had this happen to me with a Wraith (he literally just stood there and watched me slowly die‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm grateful that someone tried to get me off‚Ä¶ but sadly all it done was feed them unsafe hook points‚Ä¶ so I rage quit for the first time in this game)
---
The in the end the person who tried to save me ended up making the killer rage quit right back (I‚Äôm forever grateful that I was avenged)
---
Singapore is pretty darn close though. 3hr flight from Aus.
---
A minority of survivors have always dc'ed. The recent rise in dc's is a reflection of how the game feels as a survivor atm. Stop spamming ruin, noed and camping and you'll see less dc's.
---
Use your shards and get spirit tf?
---
Agreed but the timer should be 2 mins at most and not slow down for downs and hooks.
---
I don't know how people are making this leap. It pauses within terror radius instead of in chase, it's not THAT not of a deal. Survivors usually don't just hang out around you with a trap on.
---
Seriously, what the fuck. She didn't need this nerf. The ability to keep survivings from insta leaving was one of the few good things Piggy could do.
---
The timer already stopped when the survivor got in chase, so I don't see how it changes the effectiveness of chasing a survivor with a helmet at all.
---
She might get looped now, but her combat straps allowed her to shutdown loops and safe pallets with good mindgame.
---
This is from a pig main. Get good at the lunge. I understand you are upset. This does not help. I was that way at first as well. Pig would of been overpowered at the endgame if it stayed the same. Survivors would of mass quit if that happened. All I hope for is that timers active when the collapse starts.
---
And this is where the game starts going to shit. Was fun while it lasted
---
I got enduring and nurses calling specifically for pig less than a week ago, so I might be part of that curse
---
Thanks!

Prb today

Legion is not gutted, he's in a better spot. Take the time to play him.

---
I like bittermurmur for when the last gen pops.  I always get someone with it nobody expects it.
---
I agree, this nerf was uncalled and unecessary
---
Add voice comms into the game.
---
SWF and Solo are now on par, so you can now balance without any need to take totally uncoordinated survivors into account.
---
Dedicated servers = goodbye to lag switchers
---
Have the devs forgotten how balancing killers actually works?
---
I main nurse. This character requires legitimately no skill to use once you‚Äôve got the hang of it. Only reason I struggle is because I have a really huge problem with getting disoriented easily.
---
Ok
---
Plague: If survivors are in your terror radius, you feel the urge to be polite and take a pill to reduce vomiting, and you cover your mouth as you cough.
---
Technically there's already a nerf, its "tokens" don't count on m2 hits and it can be used only once.
---
If I came off as upset at you I apologize. You seem level headed, and I admire that you can look at the bright side of things. I was once like you I think, but I guess time with this game wears one down. My ire is only aimed at the Devs. Survivors didn't cause this, it's not their fault. The Devs keep making these ridiculous decisions on their own.
---
And they've earned the ire. They've earned all the backlash they get from killers for the almost three fucking years of nonsense they've given us. No killer main should be patient any longer with them. Patience has an end, and three years is more than enough time. No more patience, no more "giving them the benefit of the doubt". No more. Just brutal honesty.
---
When I edited my first reply soon after initially posting it, it accidentally removed the part where I said it's now actually FOUR chances to escape via the end game because even if killers get to the hatch and close it and start the end game, survivors can reopen the hatch with a key. You close the hatch and still get fucked over in three more ways, I mean who can compete with all of this nonsense.
---
The end game is so ridiculously survivor sided that I can only be led to believe that this was purposely done because killers got upset at them for not including the hatch closing feature almost a full year ago when they initially came out with it (our feedback back then didn't do anything as well - survivor's feedback was all that counted - again). 
---
Even when the devs give us something we asked for they find ways to screw us in the process. All we wanted was to be given a chance to close the hatch if we made it there first - a more than reasonable request. We get there first, we should be able to close it and go after the last kill. But we were forced to wait an entire year more just for this End Game Collapse nonsense.
---
Freddy's end game was already trash and with the nerf of Remember Me it's less than trash, and now so is the Pig's. Now no killer has any sort of end game pressure unique to them that they can apply because.. reasons. Because no killer is suppose to be strong at certain aspects of the game according to BHVR. Certain killers should be good at the beginning of matches, certain should do well overall, some should do best at the end of matches. It's a crazy concept BHVR, but it just may work if you give it a shot.
---
During the End Game Collapse unless the killer has the Nurse, a chainsaw killer, an iridescent hatches Huntress, or NOED.. the odds are greatly stacked against you.. even more than before. Don't forget to stay at least 16 meters from the hook too or else you'll be punished in points and rank.. even if other survivors are near the hook waiting to save. Because it's not fair to closely protect your hook during the End Game. They don't get punished for being near the hook, but killers do. Sounds fair.
---
It's a 4v1 asymmetrica game, but the 1 has to keep fighting for things. The 1 role is the power role and it should 4 times as powerful as any individual survivor - at least that's the way it goes in every other asymmetrical game in history besides DBD. Being the sole remaining survivor left in an asymmetrical game should mean *slim* to **none** odds of escaping due to being *severely* over matched. That remaining survivor should be FEARFUL of being the last prey of the killer and should dread such a situation. But this game seems to want a solo survivor to be able to 1v1 a killer and WIN just as many times as they lose. How the hell can you balance an asymmetrical game if you can win a 1v1 vs the power role.
---
Everytime I even consider that BHVR is "getting it", they do something like this to make doubt that they ever will.
---
Cute üòÅ

that DC feels so normal

God dangit immediately after I just spent 1 million BP to get Nurse‚Äôs

I still complain, though.

I think he is fine now how he is, he is actually mid tier now
---
I am a very sad bacon üò≠
---
Oooh, i think i just got a cool idea. Here it is: 2 minute timer. When a survivor is hooked, the timer is only slowed down if the killer remains near the hook for a while. So basically i'm trying to make it faster but also fight the problem of people camping hooks the entire time.
---
Ok. On what are you basing this ‚Äúbetter‚Äù performance? Are there an abundance of streamers earning 4Ks with him on competent survivors? Or is this just another survivor main claiming that a 5% speed boost compensates massive reductive changes to every other part of his kit?
---
Seriously, why pig of all killers?
---
Honestly, the first 5 seasons were the best part. Once it is started to become bigger than it was and more story-oriented, it started to lose a lot of its charm. If that was other people's thing, I get it, but the comedy was always the strongest factor for me and most of my RvB friends. When they ended up stranded in season 11, we were happy to see them back to their roots.
---
What are you talkin' bout sport?  
---
The nurse needs that buff to her fatigue asap champ.   
---
It's not fair for the killer then bud.

You should strive to help all killers, they need it son.

The immediate reaction about the nerf was how inactive traps dont kill you if you try to leave. Suddenly *everyone* has been using pigs traps to kill people, not as a stall mechanic or anything. It was a pathetic overreaction and I called it out and then suddenly everyone was talking about how the stall mechanic got nerfed after I pointed out how the inactive trap nerf didnt mean anything.
---
The idea is you are supposed to find the hatch before the killer does. Whoever finds it first "wins"
---
Thank you soooo much! I honestly have been getting a little salty about all these posts about people saying pig didnt need any nerfs when she needs something. Maybe not this harsh of a nerf but definitely something.
---
all survivors gains RBT item, and can now instantly kill any killers they encounter.
---
Same thing on PS4 I don't think console is up to snuff on some things so I hope they fix it
---
Afaik, it wont trigger if it isnt already ticking down. If the trap is active and they try and leave through a gate, it should still kill them. But if you prematurely activate the collapse via closing the hatch before one activates via gen completion.
---
Traps are useless post collapse though :/
---
**I could be wrong.**
---
That being said, fuck the fact that the timer doesn't go down in her terror radius. I didn't like that it was happening to legion, and I sure as hell don't like it on the Pig. Not having mend/timer active during a chase was great, this is not.
---
I guess but I was in games where it ran smooth as butter. I‚Äôm hoping dedicated servers will help bc I‚Äôve had enough of this
---
let‚Äôs not mention that to Freddy
---
I like playing Hag right now, but eventually the next patch will roll out and probably nerf my sweet grandma too :(
---
Billy does not need a nerf. He can be looped as easily as any other 115% killer.
---
Name checks out.
---
Ahhh, a stand of culture as well
---
Hmm well that's a good point Fuck Me Right?
---
Fun is subjective by nature of course, and while fun is influenced by what killers people play fun is also influenced by what those killers can and cannot do, Sure you can have fun with freddy, does not mean you don't have situations or unfun games directly because of things Freddy cant do that other killers can.
---
Strong killers have less unfun situations because strong killers can usually counter unfun things, being looped to hell and back is unfun, but as Nurse screw it ignore the pallets. Having 3 gens pop because of a SWF team as clown because you have limited map pressure is unfun,but screw it if your Billy you can just whizz across the map.
---
While Fun is a factor of course, the fact of the matter is frustration is also a thing, and Nurse and Billy are 2 killer who can counter most things that make other killers frustrating. Thats why the bar is hard to balance, because certain mechanics are frustrating to killers, but killer who can ignore those mechanics are frustrating to survivors. So you end up with this negative feedback loop where in the strong killers cant be nerfed without making killer as a role more unfun, but you cant buff other killers up to their level because what makes them fun is ignoring mechanics that survivors use for their own fun.
---
They‚Äôd never do this, as they don‚Äôt get to force you to buy an extra piece of cosmetic
---
I would buy a balanced landing, urban evasion, stakeout, deliverance, surveillance, unrelenting, spies from the shadows, and Infectious Fright.
---
Not all of them, but some if they were cheap enough for my broke-ass wallet.
---
You ever wonder why we're here?
---
Very nice detail, the proportions don‚Äôt look right to me in this photo
---
Did you not hear about rbt not ticking within your terror radius because that's a massive nerf
---
Good things:
---
His base movement speed is increased
---
 The Killer does not see the deep wound timer progress 
---
 The¬†Deep Wound timer progress¬†is¬†no longer¬†reduced¬†by¬†regular¬†Feral Frenzy¬†attacks
---
 The¬†duration of Feral Frenzy¬†is increased
---
 The¬†Iridescent button addon¬†no longer requires The Legion to apply Deep Wound for the effects to be active.¬† 
---
Only bad things i can see is:
---
 Feral Frenzy is immediately and automatically cancelled whenever The Legion¬†misses an attack¬†while in frenzy
---
 The¬†movement speed of Feral Frenzy¬†is significantly¬†reduced.¬†The Legion moves faster than base speed while in frenzy, but not as fast as they did before.¬†
---
‚ÄúNimble teens who constantly receive physical exercise from gang related activity? Nah. They‚Äôve got Parkinson‚Äôs. Parkinson‚Äôs vault.‚Äù

Remember fellow Australians, (on PC at least) thanks to that lawsuit with valve, we have the right to refund the game when they make it unplayable for use by expecting us to use servers in Asia.

---
IMO, this seems like a kneejerk change to make endgame work with pig. If they are really gonna do this they need to rework the RnG for the pig traps or add more boxes to make then actually a threat during the time before the gens are finished. RBTs were only good in the end game for higher ranks (other than memeing around) if they take that away they need to be better for earlier in the game.
---
I wouldn't say everything thing they do for survivors is improving their chance to escape. Still plenty of perks that are fucking god awful and downright useless for survivors too :|
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, they did technically nerf the perk. I‚Äôm excited for it, but it‚Äôd be nice if it were easier to get stacks considering it only does bonus BP
---
Now they will,  now they can escape with them on, they wont work if collapse starts,  they wont even start till a gen is finished giving no sense of urgency and making it useless against swf.
---
does this actually happen? ive had games where a killer DCs and i lose a pip but its only a bug in the post menu lobby. when i leave my rank is unchanged
---
The majority of this community is toxic. Youre just more likely to find toxic survivors because theres 4 in one game, as opposed to 1 killer.

Sure, but refer to my connection to the pallets. They do the same thing and are a core gameplay mechanic. MoM equals free instant no skill pallet stun, or something.
---
I guess the main part is a bit shorterüò≠
---
Internal eating doesn't matter if you're playing against other spud devs

Left behind is still bad
---
WGLF was actually nerfed (a good change, but a nerf for an already bad perk)
---
Pig was actually nerfed
---
Devs please

Lol she is isnt she
---
Amazing work. I am working on my own drawing series as well with dbd. Constructive criticism here: I think the head is too small and something happened with those legs. Other than that holy fuck good job. I can't draw that good and am only drawing the character portraits because of it.
---
#SNROOOOOOOOART
---
I can agree with this
---
I mean... yeah?
---
Hey now, at least Michael is still Michaeling
---
I plan to get both but if I had to pick I would say enduring. Then you can not give a crap about pallets and force them to drop them all the time.
---
Hang on why is this a picture of the Master of Masters?
---
I totally get it, I know what being shafted time and time again by this kind of stuff feels like from other games. I wish there was a kind of balance that makes the game feel like it‚Äôs horror again like it was when the game first came out. I‚Äôve always accepted and wanted the game to operate in the way that the survivors hardly stand a chance against a good killer where maybe one or two people escape because the team was working in sync and people were playing well. While I‚Äôm playing the goal is never to escape, just to help the team in any role I‚Äôm given.
---
I know I should be frustrated, and to be honest I‚Äôm getting there; I really wish BHVR would look for more community assistance. I can‚Äôt say that it‚Äôd make the game infinitely better, but they need to start making some changes that let us communicate with them better. We have Fogwhisperers that to me seem like glorified PR reps; when they‚Äôre people that have large communities to discuss and talk about change that could benefit the playerbase as a whole.
---
I‚Äôm going to be very upset if these Pig changes go through because I think it‚Äôs a good example of how far the game has deviated from what it was intended to be from the start.
---
I honestly rate them equally. They are very different killers with very different strengths, but both strong.
---
S. S. King's Park? XD
---
You see, this started off as me wondering if you were a survivor main who wasn't happy about their team disappearing. then your true colors showed through. A killer main who's mad they got refused more BP's that don't actually matter since it's PTB.  
---
Well here's some perspective for you.  
---
Survivors want to test new features too! \*gasp\*  
---
But they don't get to because killer mains are bringing in all their crutch perks, top add-ons, and moris, and they're face-camping, tunneling, and slugging the last survivor in nearly every game.   
---
You want survivors to stick round only so YOU can enjoy the game but you aren't extending that courtesy back to the survivors who actually want to EXPERIENCE the endgame collapse.  Most survivors are happy to let the entity kill them too if you let them.   
---
No sympathy from me. If you tryhard, I'll DC and get to another game where I DO get to enjoy the new endgame.
---
Left Behind was always useless
---
Yeah, if you're not already at an exit gate it's now open before you can possibly reach it. Except Billy or nurse though, gotta make sure any killer nerfs don't affect those two as hard as any other killers!
---
No, he's right. You do know what burden of proof is, right?
---
That's not even  better lmao
---
never
---
It increases movement speed while stalking.
---
sameeee
---
I have already released 3 memes but I'm running out of ideas. I won't back down though, save the √òink!
---
Hol up double bloodpoints? When?
---
Please dont do this to the pig. She is fine the way she is.... plz. As a survivor main, it will be fine!!!!!!
---
Early May according to Not_Queen
---
But scratched mirror doesnt let u go past tier i so i dont see its use
---
I haaaate this game. jesus. these developers can literally ruin anything. but sure, keep giving us bright ass cosmetics and useless perks.
---
Beautiful
---
Wait what? That‚Äôs kinda bullshit. If they‚Äôre listening to survivor suggestions their not even listening to the good ones.
---
‚ÄúSalt/rant‚Äù
---
How the fuck is this tagged as that? Literally denying people from certain countries a dedicated server isn‚Äôt salt. It‚Äôs a genuine concern
---
Then just slow it down further when there's some one hooked. They've already built-in the solution to all of these problems they're trying to solve with the killer nerfs, it's the clock.
---
I love how stupid that 'fix' is, I always thought it was a really neat difference between legion and similar killers that Legion can check lockers. The amount of times a survivor has jumped into a locker infront of Legion, only to be yeeted out because why would they be unable to open the locker. I'm gonna miss that.
---
Gottem
---
Is this going to mean the pig will follow you crouched to wait out the BT time like bing bong does cloaked?
---
join us, amanda. joiiiin us.
---
Actually I play mostly Plague and Hag, but it's a shame to see a killer get turned into a clone, even if I don't play them.
---
there isn't much to see... if u try to reach endgame by normal play: dc and being called out tryhard.
---
all u can do is sitting there and waiting and wannabe farming, so people can see the endgame...
---
If you are a bad killer then the Legion changes will be viewed as a nerf but good killers can now down more efficiently with the increased speed
---
I wouldn‚Äôt recommend doing something that will get you banned again, permanent or not
---
Monitor and Abuse. It makes his terror radius nonexistent in Tier 1 and minuscule in Tier 2. Combine with Dead Rabbit for maximum EW2 jumpscares or Scratched Mirror for a Splinter Cell visor.
---
&gt; Why would a pig spend 3 minutes moonwalking for a kill 
---
Not because it's effective, but because it's spiteful. It's irrational, but some killers do it as a way to get back at survivors for perceived slights. They no longer care about "winning" more than sabotaging one (or more) player's experience(s). 
---
But yes, that's another fringe abuse case that they sought to address with a change that ultimately did more harm than good, methinks.
---
Nurse has the best skill ceiling but at the base she is on two ends of the spectrum one being where the killer doesn‚Äôt see or get any survivors or one who knows the nurse and destroys the survivors. 9/10 it‚Äôs the former.
---
5 make that 15 it has amazing craftsmanship
---
No amount of gitting gud makes playing boosted voice-comm squads as fun as playing in a match the game can actually balance for.
---
They probably could have easily gotten around this issue by just making the box always gives the key if in EGC. Slight nerf to Pig, but wouldn't have completely made her power worthless for the end of the match.
---
I will never understand why we don't have a totem counter,  especially for solo. Hell,  I play with one other person and we cleanse every totem we see,  and as you said the other 2/3 won't touch a single totem so the whole team suffers. Even if they attached it to small game,  so you'd have to use a perk slot for it like they have to do for the hex? It would even it out some,  I do think it rewards killers that aren't very good. I used it when I first started playing as killer,  or when I play as I killer I do not main as and just need to do a daily. But on my mains I don't use it,  because if I fail to kill everyone before they pop the last gen,  why should I get to one shot everyone and face camp someone to death? I personally don't face camp even at end game,  but 90% of killers do,  I go and after the people standing in the exit gate watching their team mate die or find the hatch for the person who has stood there since it spawned.
---
Urban Evasion is cool and all but it's not necessary to make Sprint Burst useful. Sprint Burst is pretty easy to utilize if you get some practice with it, just like most perks. Your exhaustion meter will slowly recover and when it is at about a sliver you can just run normally to keep it from fully recovering until you need it.  
---
You should not worry about using your Sprint Burst too much. Especially not to the point where you are walking around everywhere. It does help at the beginning of a chase but if you're not good at chases then you'll still get caught, Sprint Burst won't really change this. So utilize it to cover lots of ground quickly to scout the map a bit or a specific area around a generator or just use it to run to a generator/totem/hooked survivor real quick.  
---
After using it a bit this advice might make more or less sense.
---
i got downed almost immediately after the clip ends and facecamped to death on first hook so idk about that one bud
---
I said it once, I will say it again. Give The Pig an iridescent add-on that forces survivors to search ALL boxes before removing the RBT.
---
I'm just trying to understand the rules on bans better because I haven't seen them clearly outlined somewhere yet.
---
Uh oh. Looping time ü§£ü§£
---
Correct me if I'm wrong... but the part about the timer not going down being in the terror radius (instead of being in a chase) can just be easily countered the same way Pigs were countering it before, yes? In my experience Pigs have always just crouch followed people with active traps to counteract the timer pause. Is that not going to work for some reason with this change?
---
Definitely not going to. Didn't think I would get banned for messing around a couple games with the killer 2+ glitch either but eh oh well.
---
the funny thing is, people get really lax around me when i play pig. they expect me to ambush so they look around and listen for the roar que but i just uncrough and pluck them off generators, if they have a friend the friend often botches a skillcheck and runs away meaning i scared them both badly, pigs pretty fun if you know what you're doing, issue is you have to force game overs with her if you want them, Rules set No.2 needs to be a permanent base part of the power, without it the survivors normally get it off first try so i can go through all 4 before 2 gens are done. sure it slows the game but its not really stressfull until the gen gets popped and the timer starts, maybe replace rules set with a different ultra rare? maybe mute the ambush audio que like what wraith has?
---
Even if thats true, that wouldn‚Äôt change how toxic you are towards that killer...
---
Sad oink noises
---
People keep using this excuse but it's not one. We leave our feedback and it gets ignored.  They dont even bother to fix KNOWN bugs between ptb and release most of the time. I honestly don't expect anything to change.
---
I appreciated bbq but I just want goddamn thantophobia
---
But that's how traps always worked, the only difference in the first part is disabling trapping after all gens are done to maybe kill them going through exit gates.
---
It‚Äôs making something weaker like a power or an item. Think of it as a nerf gun is a weaker version of a real gun
---
A nerf is something that is basically a downgrade. While the opposite effect is called a buff.
---
Nea will not be pleased when she sees this.
---
He literally put it in quotation marks, and you're *still* unsure?
---
And that reason is..?
---
You‚Äôre welcome !
---
&gt; take from them everything
---
Chill your nuts it‚Äôs some seconds on the door. At that point of the game you just want it to be over, now you got a tool for that. 
---
Whoever sees a serious nerf in this lost their mind.
---
Actually it‚Äôs not taste it‚Äôs the prettiest
---
Idk man, these are what I can think up right the top of my head
---
Some of the best killer streamers seem to agree but lol
---
Huge surprise that terrible killers are tripping over themselves to say stupid shit about objective facts (that if you're chasing the survivor with a helmet on, you're playing Pig wrong), but this crosses over entirely into nonsensical so congrats I guess!
---

---
She was buffed
---
But now exit gates too.
---
You're kidding, right? Nurse is by far widely considered the best killer in the game. She can completely ignore solid objects, which most other killers have to abide by and walk around to get to survivors. Both she and Billy share high mobility and decent parts of their kit to help in the chase, which helps against rank 1 survivors, who are (or at least should be...) good loopers and who finish gens quickly.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable and my day is ruined
---
They're changing it in case the killer closes the hatch. They don't want a survivor to get stuck on one gate long enough for the killer to find them.
---
Lol I quit this game because it is soo one sided. You either play/go against an op killer, or you dont. I payed for every killer, and was brutally disappointed with the legion. Now the pig is nerfed?! Lmao haha GG
---
I saw the wrap and for a couple seconds was ready to slap someone with four streamer ebony because it looked like a cat tail

They did alright

Exactly, after awhile it's muscle memory and just trying not to be thrown off by Los

Reflects how I feel about the changes :L
---
used to sacrifice hamsters to the entity
---
Lol damn this got me good.
---
Agreed. If you look on the DBD forums they've even replied to a lot of threads about the PTB changes. They already said they're taking a second look at some of the Legion changes, so saying they never listen is just straight up false.

DbD forums are overwhelmingly against the changes too, although there is more buzz against the Legion nerfs than the Pig nerfs compared to here.
---
They nerfed a good pig
---
Speak for yourself I'm hyped for both.
---
Definitely put it on Etsy and make some easy money!! I'll be your first customer!!
---
Took me a while to spot the pig, nice job!
---
I'm a survivor main and I still think the game screws killers over.
---
So after testing new Legion I've come to accept the changes. Legion might very well be a top tier killer now. The map pressure is amazing, and as long as you don't play the scumbag way you'll destroy. I'm beginning to think the overreaction is real, and I was even one of the over reacting people. 
---
Actually doing a pretty good job so far BHVR.
---
Yes too familiar, feelsbadman
---
So what happens if the survivors or killer never open a gate and there's just one survivor in the end? The hatch spawns and the killer closes it and starts the timer. So what does the lone survivor do?
---
Bhvr bad
---
Why would you say something so controversial yet so brave?
---
He just licks it to clean the fingers from your filthy blood tainting its precious state.
---
If you think the RBTs are the bug part of her ability, you should learn how to play Pig correctly....that Dash pretty much destroys a majority of loops if used correctly.
---
Fucking RUIN WAS TWO WEEKS AGO!?  I now know what true pain feels like. 
---
Also yes these are some dope ass perks the past month.
---
Nurses is definitely the better perk. Both are really good, but you definitely get more payoff with nurses calling
---
I've just been told I was a survivor main becaise I dared to say that I was ok about the nerfs, according with the endgame collapse.
---
The truth is it's not the case, I play as much both and this person was just salty.
---
I posted this because I'm sure I'm not the only one to think that and actually enjoy playing killer!
---
Because no matter how hard they try, they can't get the game to distinguish when a chase is being had or not and since the TR/chase goes hand in hand in most situations with killers they did this so a Pig can't chase someone with an active trap on their hand and just screw with them until the thing snaps.
---
Pig better be buffed somewhere else if they go forward with this.
---
Monitor and abuse, spirit fury, enduring, ruin
---
Monitor and abuse, discordance, brutal strength, and ruin
---
The first one is really good but I‚Äôve been having fun with the second lately. Monitor is ridiculous on Mikey. I hope you try these out for yourself!
---
It's impossible to tell. Most people take a guess by assuming the obsession has it, also their gameplay style. If they are being reckless/provocative to the killer
---
You have some variation of this comment in like four threads... are those real tears? Be honest.
---
No wait. DO do step in his craps
---
...is that a scottish speaking Feng Min? The hoodie makes her look like Cammie from genLock
---
BHVR definitely nerfed her end game, they're forcing her to be played the way they want: trap the first survivor you down, leave them so their timer will tick down, and search for others. The logic might be that she'll stall the game early on and she's forced to not tunnel. I guess we'll see when she's played more.
---
The hookers meeting
---
Why would they nerf top tier killers...?
---
Thanks for your time, i'll use it for sure. Sadly skillcheck fps in game are unstable and usually laggy even with rock solid 62 fps all time, skillchecks fps feel always at 40-50 fps at best, sometimes at 30 :/
---
I would honestly like cosmetics of it and the Legion mask for everyone no fibbing.
---
Hey guys I cleansing ruin
---
*exposed*
---
It's because of the end game mechanic. She'd be too powerful with this now in the game. It's not like she's the only thing being changed to accommodate the endgame, lots more changes inbound.
---
Lol @Rancor, I see you being sneaky
---
Such a DBD ending to things. Chainsaw across the map and insta DC. 10/10
---
Amen to this, the whole point of the game is the unpredictability of each match, sometimes you get good and bad matches, of course you get salty or a bit frustrated but just move on to the next match or take a break if you want to. People need to chill out and stop taking this game so seriously, lol.
---
That looks so good!! Nice
---
It used to be more noticeable before the last PTB because they would be the Obsession (even if a killer didn't have an obsession perk). Now it doesn't reveal itself until it's used. I guess if someone's getting cocky and sticking nearby the Killer after being unhooked, it could be obvious?
---
WAIT SERIOUSLY? On the ptb?
---
personally I prefer hoodie down.

NOED, Iron Maiden, Make Your Choice, Haunted Ground, and Michael Myers with Judith's Journal and J. Myers Memorial. The ultimate instadown build.
---
No, she was nerfed. Specifically her movement speed.
---
Yes, but none of the progress you make on PTB will be carried over to your main account.
---
Idk, difference if they punish DC's is I'll just AFK on matches I don't like or purposely suicide
---
Game can be incredibly unfun
---
its a title I am proud of.
---
For context, the only interaction I had with this Jane was her getting downed in the first 20 seconds and refusing to recover (instead, just crawled around whilst another guy got basement-hooked trying to save her). I unhooked her when she was found, and then she refused to let me heal her.
---
I knew the other guy was on death-hook whilst I cleansed NOED, so that's why I didn't bother trying to save him and stayed with the gate, lol
---
I thought this 2-killer thing was a bannable bug now? :(
---
damn, I'm sorry. I guess my opinion determines if i'm a shit killer
---
I wasn‚Äôt here in 2016, but I‚Äôve heard about instagens and decisive working without obsessions and cooldowns instead of exhaustion allowing you to run various exhaustion perks at once,
---
And infinite loops, and I can say survivors have been very much nerfed since then. 
---
Also flashlight nerfs, faster pickup animations seem like buffs for killers.
---
I find he gets a shit ton of use out of three of them in particular--Rancor, Make Your Choice, and surprisingly Iron Maiden. The fact that his aura is completely obfuscated means that his obsession can't see him and doesn't anticipate the perk at all. Make Your Choice because his terror radius often doesn't affect survivors until the unhook is complete, and Iron Maiden... well, mostly for location awareness and faster locker actions.
---
No buff. just nerfs. I know crouching is good. but if you can show me it worked for you twice at rank 1 go ahead.
---
Pretty much
---
It seems that if a killer is camping the hatch, the LB perk would be a great counter to it.
---
IKR

---
no, it wasn't nerfed. They trialed it in the PTB for maybe a week and actually listened to player feedback and scrapped it
---
Lmao the fact that you used the term ‚Äúspayed‚Äù and ‚Äúneutered‚Äù shows me how immature you are üòÇ
---
Yeah, I‚Äôve seen a lot of these and honestly it seems like one person sees it and then makes their own
---
Got it. Thanks for the help, good sir/madam.
---
Billy only needs nerfs to his add-ons, they're not gonna change his base-kit. 
---
Btw carburator, extra blinks and omegablink are all getting nerfed sometime in the next few patches.
---
There are other ways to solve this too besides the devs having to play the game a lot. Take a group of players who plays pretty much everything at a high level (Survivor and Killer) and LISTEN to their opinions and feedback. They certainly don't need to implement every idea but the people who have had the time to put into the game and have the skill to know what is unbalanced or balanced should have a seat at the table.
---
I‚Äôm going on vacation in May (mostly for work) and I cannot believe I‚Äôm going to miss out on this event after waiting for so long. I‚Äôll come back to normal bloodpoints and nerfed killers :/

I originally was going to do a picture of four Bloody Party Streamers, and a Mori, but these ones were specifically requested.

Well, it's about damn time I'm not one of the very few who's lost trust in the devs. For me, it was Mettle of Man. For you, it'll be these changes. For everyone else, it'll be the upcoming Freddy nerfs.
---
They should have done something like leatherface for masks. Moto a survivor and be able to use their face as a cosmetic
---
Yes thank you so much!!
---
Yeah, because being 115 with the tradeoff of having no power is *sooooo* balanced.
---
Mom said it's my turn to be nerfed into Freddy 3.0.
---
Very specific scenario. Pig barely ever gets any kills with the RBT and the majority of the time they seem to take it off on the first or second box. 
---
Majority of end game ends are less than three minutes. I just don't see this being worth all the nerfs.
---
I like how she basically got what she deserved so good clip

Gimme that halloween event theme, good throwback

From what I can tell it's easy to....tell, sorry bad grammar, when you pick them up and they don't start struggling usually signals it.

I'm working on doing this my self. She's a little tricky to get used too, but I figured out a working (ish) pattern for my blinks

Except he'll be worse than them, because at least their powers are good at *something.*

Piggy main power, a Reversed Bear Trap, right now it will kill you if you if you walk out of exit gate with it on your head regardless of it is active or not. But changes are coming and it will no longer kill people if it is not a active trap.
---
My Etsy shop is in my profile if you wanna find out more!
---
What else is new?
---
Well I‚Äôm guessing from the numbers the first panel is about the endgame collapse thing when 3 minutes are up survivors are um penetrated by the entity. And the 3rd panel is about different perk changes and that‚Äôs why the killers aren‚Äôt as happy in last panel compared to the second panel. I‚Äôm guessing.
---
&gt;Game can be incredibly unfun
---
Especially when it's a 3v1 because someone didn't get the matchup they wanted.
---
thank you for explaining that have a good night
---
Something tells me that the people who main Pig know more about how the changes will effect her than you do
---
RBTs were already pretty much useless... now they‚Äôre completely useless.

I haven‚Äôt physically made any of the addons, powers/items or offerings, but I have a few of the designs.
---
Jigsaw (from across a realm and the afterlife): Game over....
---
Honestly they should treat the pigs traps like a hook, making the timer go slower when they have a trap on so it gives people time to get it off and get out, not this sad shit
---
I've been noticing this a whole lot more recently
---
They really shouldn't nerf top tier killers though, they're the only ones who can stand up to optimal survivor play lol.
---
If anything everybody who isn't top tier needs buffs because you will learn really quick that you simply can't play them at high ranks as you will just get stomped.
---
Like how everyone said that the sound was fucked in Plauge's PTB but the developers shipped it anyways and have yet to even acknowledge that there's issues with sound? Myeah, I guess.
---
Agreed, but it‚Äôs making a situational perk even more situational is how I saw it. Or maybe I‚Äôm just complaining for no reason
---
120% speed for killers turns this into hide and seek. Chases are fun. I'd honestly rather vs nurse than 120% killers.
---
You can very much beat 90% of lobbies with an M1 killer with no power, 115%.
---
It's not that the Plague was too strong, she wasn't "fun" enough to play against.
---
Dang dude. 
---
You‚Äôve got a lot of drinks to protect!!
---
It‚Äôs not a bad perk but I would wait for Balanced Landing, Dead Hard, or Lithe instead.
---
BHVR won't ban you but Steam will.
---
I was on-board until the Nurse wallhacks thing. I don't play Nurse since I'm still on console but I disagree strongly.
---
Actually I gotta say, I love this new legion. I hated playing as him before (extremely boring imo) but now they‚Äôve made it a bit more challenging while still being a decent killer (played most of the day. Red ranks. 3-4ks consistently)
---
Collapse is happening, right? Three minutes to escape, if pig was how she normally was, everyone would be yelling, kicking and screaming about how busted she is because of her endgame potential. If traps activated on exit gates powering then everyone would be calling for a nerf, it usually takes 1/2 minute/s to get a trap off, and with that timer the pig could be tunneling you making it almost impossible to escape in the three minute collapse timer. That's why I think it's justified. So Idk why everyone is crying about it, you feel me.
---
Unique themes?
---
nurse is kind of weak on console, but on PC she is terrible to play against. she ignores almost every boundary in the game
---
Emblems are the 4 'medals' you get at the end on the pip screen aren't they, with iridescent being the red one? 
---
If so, how does that relate to getting the adept achievement? I thought you just needed merciless killer which most of the time is 4K?
---
Devs : b-but.....we gave you endgame collapse.üòå
---
For sure, I watch a lot of streams and see her full power. It's wild. But it takes a ton of practice and work and she can still be countered by breaking line of sight specifically. So wallhacks is just incorrect.
---
As a curiosity, what perks are you talking about. I have had a terrible time with myers and I'm sure a bit of it is playstyle but where do you start with perks?
---
I would do quite a lot in order to make the game good. I hate the game in its current state, but what I hate more is that I've been driven to hate it in the first place. I'm a huge fan of horror, particularly 80's slashers, and also games where you basically play a horror game as the scary monster are normally the sorts of games I love, so I should be the easiest sell in the world on Dead By Daylight, but I'm just... not. Not the way it is right now, anyways.
---
I have never ever seen a Pig moonwalking for trap to go off. I've only seen them block boxes which is lol and incredibly rare
---
And Devour Hope.
---
Imo legion got buffed so he can be played normally, no more cheese. And he has the ability to run at 115% movement speed, making him more viable than most, not all, killer at loops. Plus he still has his "free hit" from frenzy, no matter if they decreased the speed, the duration is still strong and the vaulting mechanic hasn't been touched. So what I'm wondering is why everyone thinks its a nerf when all they did is fix the cheese...
---
‚Äúwallhacks‚Äù was a bit of a joke on my part. no killer has wallhacks, i just think it‚Äôs funny to say that. anyways, yes her skill cap is really, really high. but once you learn how to play her you are undefeatable
---
God damn, I forgot that was a thing and now I'm having flashbacks.
---
Oh some fellow nine year olds in the sub? Excellent
---
Your edit is what I‚Äôm referring to :)
---
uninstall the game
---
Lol fair enough. I have a tendency to take jokes to literally üòÖ Watching good players with her is horrifying.
---
The nerfs themselves were fairly minor, but considering that the Pig wasn't anywhere near the strongest killer and she got two nerfs with nothing to compensate for it, just makes me question the devs. Pig seems to have been hit just to prevent some edge case abuse scenarios, because the devs decided to implement Endgame Collapse, which is apparently supposed to fix some edge case abuse scenarios. The whole thing just seems so pointless and poorly planned.
---
You don't even have to report them. The devs stated that they get all the data and can figure out who is exploiting this glitch.
---
no problem friend, i‚Äôm glad we have come to an agreement
---
Yes, you can still use keys.
---
I mostly agree. As a red ranks pig main myself, I prefer to space out my traps so as to make sure that I have that game delay from beginning to end. But everyone has their own strats with her. 
---
I‚Äôm not at all worried about these pig nerfs. Pig should be able to finish up by mid-early late game when played using your traps as game delay. Anyone using them for lethality (imo) isn‚Äôt using pig to her full potential.
---
nobody is saying you can‚Äôt do anything
---
I'm glad you adressed ppl tunneling as pig had this happen today as we all questioned the point of using the trap if your just gonna tunnel while we finish gens also i am with you on the issue with this as I like using pig when I play killer even though it's hard to do now it's harder so I'll use her less than I already do
---
Damn you beat me to it!
---
I feel so slow now.
---
I saw this in the patch notes as well and this perk really serves no purpose now and really just waste a perk slot.  At best if there are 5 gens and everyone died you could do 1 of 5 gens  16.8 secs then the next in 20  the 3rd in 24 the 4th in 32 and the last one in 45.7 seconds which is just over 2 minutes. And during all this time of the killer doesn‚Äôt come for you I guess it works out if u can get the door open on top of that. Not to mention the killer gains nothing from camping the hatch cause all they can do is close it if they see you approaching now that killers can‚Äôt grab you from the hatch anymore. Yeah closing it will power the gates but if the killer guesses right they‚Äôll just find You within seconds of closing it if you‚Äôre on a door. This update was honestly all fluff and just a buff for borrowed time.
---
I actually think a gas gauge would be a great idea!  It would be interesting to have to strategically use their power for sure.

Was gonna say this, check out montos lastest basement build he uses mad grit so well in it

True. I thought the recollection (6-8) was cool in its own way too, it felt like they went way more serious and tried to inject a ton of lore into the series. I thought that was interesting but I know it isn‚Äôt for everybody. Personally though I still rewatch seasons 6-8 every now and then, Washington is one of my favorite characters.

Everybody is saying he's getting nerfed is because his power is actually doing what its suppose to, discouraging the survivors from being bunched up, not tunneling a single survivor
---
Don't be a jerk dude. Just move along.

As a 1.4k hour player who plays in brisbane and is real anal about ping(wont play a game with 200 or higher ping) this really concerns me :/

It‚Äôs fucking never good enough for this community, I get it the can suck sometimes but come on. If you hate the game and the devs so much just stop playing it.
---
They probably made this change to help low ranks who rely on stealth instead of being good at chases, the same survivors who dislike fighting doc.  This is the only reason I can think of.
---
Maybe if I calmly walk behind this try he won‚Äôt‚Äî *disconnects*

Okay, fuck off with that argument. Everyone hated Legion. The devs changed him, and the changes were shitty, so everyone complained about those changes. This is common knowledge, and has been said by literally everyone who's willing to be honest and not blindly defend anything BHVR does. And I *have* stopped playing the game, but seeing the constant stream of ineptitude and bad decisions made by BHVR still annoy me.
---
That's true in the scenes that one RBT wastes more time than one deep wounds. However, when you take into account that you can apply deep wounds over and over again, and apply it to multiple survivors in one go, deep wounds will end up wasting more time in the long run.
---
I mean survivors can teabag for two minutes and fifty seconds, while still being perfectly safe from anything the killer does. But if a survivor can't safely reach a Jigsaw box, or the hatch, for any amount of time, then it's obviously an exploit that needs to be addressed.
---
Well, did she know the killer was busy? I use self heal to take a hit and try to save the survivor so they don't get tunneled or worse
---
That glitch happened to me but it was on my end I was playing myers, everything was slanted except for my weapon
---
You can mock the devs all you want but the reasons presented in the comment still seem to be valid.
---
Imagine keeping: nurse, billy, hag and spirit (very strong killers), and proceeding to nerf a mid tier killer who would benefit from the new changes. Its like nerfing leatherface cause basement hooking would become meta.
---
OK WHERES MY BODY PILLOW
---
I don‚Äôt know how I feel about Nurse changes, Nurse is the only killer that can deal with the well coordinated SWF‚Äôs at high ranks where the game is over in three minutes. I guess it‚Äôs not a common thing but I need my Nurse in those situations. ;-;
---
https://www.twitch.tv/psychoscorpionz is a Pig main that's pretty competent.
---
https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMnXKxQcvdi7QIrC2XdQJsw - "MoviePlay" is currently holding a Russian-based tournament, and Pig is regularly being played in it (the current stage of the tournament is limited to Trapper, Wraith and Pig). Many of the players participating are multi-thousand-hour veterans, some of them some of the best in the game - so not only are you watching good killers play, but they regularly go up against good survivors, as well.
---
I have a variety of streamers I watch that then-and-again will play Pig as well, and I could go scour for their Pig gameplay, but I'm too lazy for that right now. There's some advanced stuff you will also see, but the basic idea is really rather simple: you crouch on pallet loops and try to connect dash hits. This is more effective on tiles where line of sight is broken, but also possible on regular loops. It helps crouching at the pallet part of the loop, so that the survivor is less likely to be able to get to it, but if the pallet is already dropped, it is obviously better to do it from the opposite end of the loop, to be able to reach either side of the pallet with the dash. There are not seldomly situations where this is pretty much a 50/50 of connecting a hit, which is good enough, since you don't really lose much time attempting ambush dashes - quite the contrary, often if you fail to get a hit you at least force the pallet down without the survivor having gotten loop time out of it. Enduring and Spirit Fury are obviously great for this. If the survivors however runs away from the tile preemptively, you can either dash after them or simply uncrouch, not seldomly landing a hit on them before they can make it anywhere else, especially in the latter case.
---
so oceania and the entire continent of Africa don‚Äôt get a dedicated server, and anyone in east Europe is going to not have a fun time. still good news
---
This is good - but it isn't a meme about pig nerfs, so probably wrong subreddit? :)
---
That's the one thing about survivor that doesnt make sense to me. They keep giving solo survivors a way out when really they should be making it harder to play without good teamwork.
---
Everybody playing survivor is just out for themselves and they only do altruism bc the ranking system promotes it and they get bloodpoints.
---
I 100% agree tbh...theres no reason I should go save my potato teammates when it benefits me more that they die.
---
Save that NAVY SEAL strawman for some one else, I didn't say they're insurmountable challenges or something, just *less fun to face*, don't do that weird trial shit.
---
The new update makes it  so the killer's corresponding theme is playing while selecting them. I kind of wish it was for all the menus instead of just when in the killer oriented menus
---
Why nerf LF exactly? He‚Äôs not even good
---
I literally made the same post an hour before this guy
---
The *gaming* community?
---
I don't have the saw chapter yet, and I was considering buying it, but the ptb nerf just makes me want to avoid it, even though I really want to play the pig.
---
Ok. Then. Please post high rank gameplay of playing a m1 killer at 115 movement speed without using their power at all and against competent survivors
---
Otherwise I have a have a hard time believing you can do well in 90% of games at 115 and no power.
---
But the ECG doesn‚Äôt turn on the gens, it just powers the doors and closes off the gens. Either way piggy wouldn‚Äôt be able to start it without all the survs doing the gens or her closing the hatch on the last one anyway
---
So did she message you afterwards?
---
Yea I‚Äôm sure she saw the blood that you get ontop of your character while she started healing
---
I love Agent Washington and recollection was honestly still pretty good, but I just refer to it as when things started to become bigger than they were and RvB started losing its charm because it was trying too hard to be serious when its backbone was comedy. I still enjoyed Recollection pretty heavily, in part due to Monty Ohm, but it was still that beginning that then led to Project Freelancer, which was my least favorite arch because it was mostly devoid of comedy or any real charm aside from Wyoming. Season 11 when they ended up all being stuck in a backwater outpost again really helped me to continue watching.
---
Devs definitely do not cater to killers, but I'll agree with you on mostly everything else.
---
It won't balance the game.
---
It will bring SWF in line with normal play, making it possible to balance the game.
---
The only other alternative it to remove SWF entirely, which is **not an option**.
---
/u/Huntsindreams, deleting your posts because you're afraid of downvotes is a pretty bitch move.

Monitor and abuse is a personal favorite of mine since it makes his TR ridiculously small and helps with stalking people on the edges of your vision
---
Ruin is ruin and BBQ is BBQ
---
Bamboozle is fun since he already has a ridiculous vault speed in T3
---
Enduring and Spirit fury Combo is really nice on him since he eats pallets like no other killer (Brutal strength is always nice)
---
Nurses is fun since the range is larger than your terror radius, especially with MAA
---
 SAME PS4
---
&gt;Fixed an idsue where Killers were alerted to survivors making mistakes. This is a change we believe will make the game more fun for ~~survivors, because this is Fuck Killers 2.0 season~~ everyone.
---
yeah I'm going to stop you right there, "baby killers" I mean come on! You didn't even defend your statistic of "You can beat 90% of lobbies with 115 movement speed killers and NO POWER" you didn't defend it, instead you doubled down and said "with enduring" but it doesn't even make that big of a difference. It makes a difference for sure but not enough to be a mouse 1 killer with no power and doing well. I'm going to really have to call BS unless you can show me a significant amount of games where you can do well with a 115% move speed M1 killer who doesn't use their power.
---
One change out of the whole nerf that was unnecessary, but at least they're trying to adapt, it's like the contradiction with the legion balance, "you can't see bloodspots but mend doesn't go down in the terror radius anymore" the cheese is neutralised with the terror radius change but they decided to nerf the blood spots anyway, one mess up but all around a great shift for the game. "The timer doesn't go down in terror radius but the trap doesn't activate when the gates are powered" same sort of situation.
---
the collapse is intended to stop toxic survivors from holding a killer hostage by hiding. In reality, if you're playing  survivor and you aren't doing ANYTHING to be tracked, you can easily hide for as long as you want by being safe.
---
If you aren't running around, fast vaulting, slamming pallets, starting generators, etc. As well as not being against pretty much I'd say Doctor who can just passively find people somewhat. You can hide for a very long time. Collapse forces people out or they die after 3 minutes, hence why killers can open the doors as well otherwise you'd just have these toxic survivors not opening doors.
---
I like it when someone says that I only got a 4K since I used Tombstone and Tuft
---
No I got a 4k because you idiots teabagged a Myers at pallets instead of breaking line of sight
---
That's what a mute button is for.
---
Also, voice comms tend to be a lot less toxic than text chat.
---
Source: Dota 2 is a cesspool, and only very rarely is voice chat used to be toxic.
---
I actually think that would be the best change as I think noed only needs a minor change for it to go from op to just a good perk
---

---
Dude...
---
Please show me when I said that.
---
That's not his signature. He was made to be a chase-heavy killer with the power to ignore window/vault blocking and faster speed with a trade off to either hit more often or abandon chases.
---
Rework ideas often included the deep wound change to not have it go down in killer terror radius, which BHVR did, and I highly support. It basically nullifies moonwalking strats. The idea to make the timer not go down while healing is also good, though to counter that I might argue you should have a slightly shorter timer.
---
Now, the spamming attack issue. There are several good solutions to this. One is that each attack would either increase the animation time or chunk off the timer. So a missed attack would cut off maybe a fourth of your timer, or only the first missed attack would have a short cooldown, then normal cooldowns after that. This allows the crazy 'frenzy' of Legion to still be thematic and cool, while stopping the issue of spam. However, BHVR made it so you CAN'T hit multiple times in frenzy. This used to be the trade off. You could hit much easier, but had to hit more. Now... you just can't. And it makes the frenzy power much worse. In fact,  in combo with the deep wound changes, frenzy is a useless power unless all survivors are super close. Even at moderate distances, you can't catch more than one in a frenzy, and the 4 second timer makes it useless in chases, because even though you get one hit, they're rewarded with 4 seconds of run-away time. It's not a good solution.
---
Its a shame it takes 2 perk slots and ideally makes it so they get your ruin 1/3rd of the time. Buuuut some games man, they get it immediately and know not to cleanse other totems bc they aren't feeling any other hex totem effects.
---
"Psst hey, whatcha doing over there?"
---
This comment did not age well, lmao.
---
You said that all game devs make mistakes, as if that excuses how shitty BHVR is. I pointed out that they are the worst when it comes to making mistakes, so comparing them to any other company is pointless. Please, I beg of you, show me another game company that fucks up as much as BHVR.
---
Oh fuck off. They don't "suddenly love Legion", they just expected a quality rework instead of a tinfoil covered shit. Nothing but nerfs and a 115 percent movement speed tin foil wrapped around it.
---
I'd rather not have EGC and avoid having a fun, mid tier killer broken.
---
Oh. My. God.
---
Not to be that guy but retardation doesn‚Äôt mean what you think it means. 
---
I agree though, this update seems really fucking braindead. I honestly don‚Äôt know what was going through the dev‚Äôs heads when they thought this was a good idea.
---
You are so defensive cause you know it's true.
---
&gt; you didn't defend it
---
Idk, it just seems common sense to me. Killers are in an incredibly strong spot; watch any streamer who has more than 300 hours and you rarely see a team that's competent.
---
You're right! He can be played normally... and no other way. His FF is useless but hey! At least he has 115% to make up for it right? Man, 2019, the year where you can spen $8 for a literal default M1 killer and people will defend the devs.
---
He was also one of the few good guys. He found out he was killing innocent people and it ticked him off
---
&gt;I'm glad hatch stand offs are gone, but I don't see why they've added this needlessly complex phase to the game that required so many nerfs and changes just to make work.
---
I feel like it's a classic case of over-engineering a solution to a problem. All we needed was a 3 minute timer that started the moment the gates were powered, paused when someone was hooked, and killed the survivors if time ran out. No weird opening gates early, no closing hatches, just a simple end game timer.
---
Comms for random ppl is an incredibly bad idea. There‚Äôd be tons more troll survivors, or survivors throwing the game bc of an argument.
---
Plus, it ruins the initial horror immersion that DBD has on new players, which I really liked when I started
---
I‚Äôll use my voice to scream 2 things.
---
**REVERSE PIG CHANGES!**
---
and 
---
Legion has been slightly over-nerfed, please consider re-evaluating your balancing policies at BHVR and don‚Äôt let the patch go live in it‚Äôs current state.
---
Truth
---
Just not include the fact that frenzy still exists or anything. Nice sarcastic point, appreciated.
---
So like when you select them or when they're on the main menu
---
I hate when people talk about nurses skill cap being high. Basically every killer has a high skill cap. Nurses issue is the skill *floor* is so much higher than most killers. 
---
Nurse doesn‚Äôt necessarily have a higher skill cap than all of the other killers just because she‚Äôs more effective at the cap. Nurse being good isn‚Äôt skill, it‚Äôs the nurse being good
---
How on Earth is this a killer nerf
---
I‚Äôm holding out hope that they‚Äôll respond to all the rage and just cancel the nerf. 
---
Doubtful, I know.
---
Lithe master race.
---
I‚Äôm really hoping they at least look at the feedback about these changes and consider withdrawing them
---
Oof, ouch... my rank
---
Seriously though, I don't think I would be rank 12-15 if it weren't for the de-ranking every month. I have hit rank 7 or 8 before, but it's just too much work and too many hours IMHO.

But they also increased Legions terror radius a lot. I'm not a legion main so it's really not gonna affect me but there's a nerf and then there's just a straight up burial. And it just kinda feels like they've buried the legion.
---
Yeah I don't know what he's talking about, this is straight from the devs
---
The current DS is a really good and well designed perk. It was changed in a very positive way and Its completely fine as it is right now. The pig was a decent killer. All they did was purge her from existence, like legion.

Considering most big streamers I‚Äôve watched (that are really good at the game) don‚Äôt have a problem with the pig changes.... probably means that y‚Äôall are just bad at killer. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Probably because I‚Äôm using a phone instead of pc? Using your noggin works wonders big boy.
---
How many languages are you fluent in?
---
WOW HAHA FUNNY LMAO, FUNNY JOKE LOLS
---
Another source: CSGO.
---
Someone liiterally trash talking your own team without reason happens every other match.
---
Is spirit the one that looks like she isnt moving but then pops up behind you? Its pretty fun to play against.
---
Good thing the developers are known to fully ignore opinions from killers. Protest all you like, Behavior is gonna go through with their changes because they're so disconnected with their own game to see the damage they do with their changes.
---
All of you people that are crying over this probably relied on this toxic play style to get kills. If you can‚Äôt down 4 survivors and use up your traps before the exit gates are powered, you‚Äôre probably fucking bad at the game. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Lol I just made a post with the same skill check idea before I even saw your post. Whoops. Except I didn't really flesh it out this much. Just threw the skill check and regression idea on failed skill checks and suggested that maybe the knife add ons increase frequency of skill checks and amount of regressi ok n on failed checks. But maybe add ons could also make the success zone smaller so there can be more build varieties. Like an impossible skill check legion. Maybe even some add ons making it so any survivor hit with FF perform actions slower for a certain period of time (except for mending, but maybe mending pauses that timer?)
---
I dont understand why people just dont level the killers or survivors to get their perks. Its much easier than trying to farm the shards.
---
Plus you can use the shards on cosmetics.
---
If any of your killers are high enough level to get Ultra Rares, you can unlock an ultra-rare Offering named "Glass Shard" that lets you play as Pig for a match. It's not the same as playing her with perks, especially her good ones like Surveillance, but it's better than nothing and lets you enjoy her somewhat before the nerfs.
---
Take the challenge!
---
what are you talking about? this is the freddy rework!
---
Give people the option to disable voice chat.
---
Why would you say something so brave, yet so controversial?
---
Learn how to speak proper English, please.
---
Yeah, that's an unsettling change.
---
Just make them activate when a gate is opened and, idk, increase the chances of getting the trap off after it's opened.  End game was the only particularly strong thing for pig.
---
Then just don't add collapse if it requires breaking the pig to function.
---
Just allow closing the hatch to power the exit gates, that is literally all they had to do but they add the pointless timer for no reason that makes it necessary to nerf the pig.
---
Those streamers use the killer powers. Your claim specifically said no killer powers. Plus you're using the baseline of incompetent survivor teams vs a good player. You get a good survivor team and most killers can do little to nothing. Much less if you do as you claim and never use the killer's power.
---
Again, your claim is BS and you keep moving the goalposts from your original claim of "you can beat 90% OF TEAMS WITH 115% MOVESPEED AND NO POWER" -&gt; "you need enduring" -&gt; "well streamers can do it" (except for the point that almost no streamer will go without using the killer power)
---
Traps slowed the game down even when saved to the endgame. It was a primary strategy to save them since it's most effective at that time since they are always active. The traps are laughably weak in the early game and only serve as a very minor slowdown at best and a minor inconvenience for survivors at worse.  
---
Remember that the average time to take off a trap is 30-40 seconds. Especially with no immediate Impetus to do so you are slowing down the game by roughly 2 minutes. This comes at the cost of having nearly zero trap lethality and survivors being able to take off traps at whatever moment is most opportune to them, meaning you have to be in a really good spot to take a decent advantage of that 2 minutes of time which is difficult when the Lunge power alone is not all that good of a power.   
---
Saving them to the endgame was effective because it forced survivors to remove them immediately giving the Pig more of a chance to turn that 2 minutes of extra gametime into opportune moments for her. This is completely undone by the Terror radius change (as there is less reason to remove a trap quickly even if it's active) and severely neutered by the fact that RBT's do not activate automatically after last gen, meaning that the primary strategy is to waste those 2 extra minutes when the Pig cannot capitalize on them efficiently.  
---
The EGC has a 3 minute timer but often runs about 5 minutes on average due to slowdowns. That means you have enough time to remove 3 traps and escape in the worst possible scenario for yourself. If she was kept exactly the same the EGC would have only been a very slight buff to Pig and only sounds scary on paper due to the possibility of an extreme (but unlikely) circumstance and it would be a fun and exciting experience in game for the survivors.  
---
Most of the Ire that people accrue from the Pig and Legion nerfs is that these killers are the ones who are "nerfed" and called "overpowered" when things such as Omega Nurse exist and literally break the game daily.
---
I mean it's just the pig so I'mma play someone else.
---
 [https://media1.giphy.com/media/1Z02vuppxP1Pa/giphy.gif](https://media1.giphy.com/media/1Z02vuppxP1Pa/giphy.gif)
---
Nurse needs more than just small changes but okay
---
egg game shell?
---
I think it‚Äôs cause the survivors are that bad.
---
besides Billy, Huntress, and Spirit, I'd agree with, yeah.
---
I didnt check main menu, but it definitely plays when selected
---
I meant bad as in bad to play against
---
Fix the face camping and tunneling, then we'll talk.
---
Are they ever going to do anything about DCs? I play on PS4 and the DC-ing has been horrible lately. I‚Äôve played several games in the last few days where all the survivors except me DC-d within the first few minutes.
---
I dont have a video, but I just mean if you select a killer that had new menu music, that theme will play while they are selected
---
endgame collapse
---
BPS time
---
Like I don't even play him but now I don't want to. But then again I look down when I walk so I guess I already know what it's like.
---
Legion got gutted as did the pig, survivors got buffs, all killers got indirect nerfs, haven't fixed infinite loading screens, haven't fixed audio being fucked and this new end-game actually makes following scratch marks impossible. Shit update.
---
They've nerfed the ability to cheese with mend and reduced the speed of frenzy, plus they got rid of the thousand swing legion because everyone felt it was unskilled. They listened to ALL the feedback from the community about legion and presented it to the game, yet people will come back and say its a nerf after the changes are exactly what people were asking for, the devs literally cannot win against this toxic pile of garbage they call a fan base. And a you think is that they do it for the money, WHICH COMPANY DOESN'T. Freddy re work is in a month and they added a crucial part to the endgame, why is everyone still complaining.
---
... how is egs an acronym for end game collapse? I would think it's just a typo but you did it twice.
---
At this point I feel like they're going to take the easy way out by saying, "It's hard to do and we're focused on core gameplay."
---
I remember you lol I thought it was going to be ‚Äúgg ez‚Äù bc I was on console... scared the shit out of me lol
---
Holding a survivor hostage in the end game was one of the pig's most powerful abilities. This change removes a huge part of her kit. Killers in general got majorly dicked this patch.
---
Because we took the dick out of our mouth and actually looked around us.
---
Most people I know who play the game says she's unfun to go against, which U don't understand, I love going against Spirit. All the higher skill killer even, Nurse, Hillbilly, Huntress. The more the Killer has to think about what they do, the more I find it fun to go against because I have to think more.
---
Would like to point out that Frenzy has no tracking, is barely faster than normal running, has a long-ass charge time, a long-ass stun time and vaulting is slow as shit.
---
They couldn't keep a 115% speed killer with a 24 meter terror radius, imagine running that with monitor and abuse. It'd be more sneaky than a crouching pig or wraith at that point. It's all thought out by the devs, they're not trying to bury legion, just make him balanced with the changes they've made.
---
Killer mains:
---
You:
---
It honestly wouldn‚Äôt surprise me. But with the amount of DCs that have been happening the game is becoming unplayable.
---
K dude...
---
Sorry to breal the bubble but they will fucking ignore any feedback.
---
JEEEEEEESUS
---
Heh... doo doo
---
i really dont get it. there are so many strong killers that dont get nerfed.. and suddenly they nerf pig? rbt werent that useful for killing and i only saw it one single time, that pig chased a survivor, without actually triggering the chase until the trap triggered.
---
did it suck to die there? sure, but pig literally chased me for 5 generators until my head exploded and all other survivors escaped.
---
No body was every sucking off the devs, "pretty good job so far" meme has been here since the beginning. They're always trying to improve and impress but unless it's super meta or blaintantly unfair we will protest to anything they try to implement.
---
Those changes are good, but there's far more terrible changes in this patch. The fact that they nerfed pig so much and other killers a bit as well just to add this ridiculously complex timer to the end game that does nothing except limit survivors to 3 minutes of dicking around in the exit gate is just so stupid.
---
NONSENSE. Its easier to make the perk worthless than it is to figure out a SENSIBLE solution like you just said. Man, what quality Devs we have. /s
---
A couple of good changes among a sea of shit ones.
---
Plus sound is still fucked.
---
Alright:
---
Rank 1 as baseline, against 90% of lobbies you can run bbq&amp;c, enduring, ruin, stand still for 30 seconds, and win if it's not haddonfield as Wraith and never cloak. IF you're good.
---
My point is two parts: 1, killers aren't that good lately, and 2 survivors aren't seal team 6 anymore. Maps play the biggest role in balance.
---
No cloak Wraith can't win on azer's and haddonfield, but on most maps he can if you play each mindgame perfect.
---
And even then, if something favors one side just that little bit too much BAM, crying and whining for daaaays.
---
Honestly I feel like RBT should slow collapse timer but still kill on gate
---
No one except Nurse or Billy are allowed to be good. If they didn't nerf pig before releasing this patch she made have been *gasp* not one of the worst killers in the game. 
---
Also if we don't heavily nerf end game collapse before we even release it survivor mains might complain.
---
As Billy there's a definite like between angles you'll keep going at when you do bump into objects and ones where you'll stop and get stunned. Glancing off the tree was as fair game as using any other wall or rock at an angle to keep the charge going 
---
rip in dc
---
you mean how they made Ashley's outfit?
---
They test it in the ptb.
---
That‚Äôs kinda dumb. Why be able to escape if you have a trap on your head?
---
The current ranking system is as complicated and in depth as what's being suggested. People who purposefully de-rank to bully casuals would oppose this.
---
People are mad because they didn't just nerf Legion, they crippled Legion.
---
Frenzy is utterly pointless in 2.7.0. 
---
One or two of the current nerfs would have been enough, but they just kept going.
---
In 350 hours of playing this game I have never once encountered this problem. And if it was one, does it really require this overly convoluted solution?
---
Which ones where are so shit? Besides pig.
---
July is pretty close to the technical beginning of summer (June 21). Worst case scenario would be near late September as summer ends on the 23rd of that month.
---
It's a viable perk against killers who camp the hatch. It's probably the best counter to it.
---
I just started playing again since beta/release.  Snagged BBQ for my first week back :)  Now to get Nurse's calling this week
---
Wait really? Shit, why not get players who play both survivor and killer at a high level and are not the scum of the earth?
---
I really want a list of their so called "fog whisperers" and if they really are responsible for all the bizarre changes that have been happening lately. (lol lets buff borrowed time a billion times bc legion)
---
If a Pig runs an end game build she's going to be much weaker during the main portion of the game. This means more pallets etc. for survivors to play with at end game, meaning more time for survivors to open the gate and leave.
---
It's also a huge risk for the pig, as survivors can just walk out of the gate before she gets a chance to down someone. She has no movement abilities, so if the exit gates are far apart it can be impossible for her to protect both.
---
This also happens with Jigsaw boxes. She can't sit next to all of them at once, and sitting next to one is giving survivors free reign to do anything they want.
---
At the very least they should have put her base kit on the ptb so we can see first hand what she's like. Completely negating one of her powers for the entire end game, with no recompense, seems like a bad idea.
---
I disagree with this nerf being big. You dont play pig with the trap kills in mind you mainly use them to slow the game down. Those changes killed late game Pig but i didnt saw that build in a year. As to the timer its main and i think only purpose is to prevent holding game hostage that's it.
---
Same here. Thought it was cause I play with a controller. Some maps I could get items other maps I couldn't.
---
That's because before it was each timee you entered the ptb it was a mirror from your live save. And some ppl used that like using infidelity Moria or other strong items / add-ons.
---
egc
---
well, Legion, yeah
---
It reduces door time by 20 percent, nerfs 2 killers severely, allows hatch to spawn regardless of how many gens have been done, and I'm sure I'm forgetting something. In return killers got basically nothing.
---
its sad how endgame collapse would've made the reverse bear traps good, but bhvr decides to make them trash.
---
traps had 2 uses. stalling by forcing survivors to do something else then genrushing and denying them escape after the gates are open, so you had a chance of getting them. M1 killers suck at securing kills with open gates unless they have noed. well, better widen the gap between high tier killers and the trash below. this will make the game way more fun, right? right?!
---
The Pig changes are tolerable, if they weren't an objective nerf. She needs a buff to compensate. Either a shorter trap timer or smaller terror radius.
---
Also, Legion got a longer Frenzy and 115% movement speed.m but paid for it with:
---
Slower frenzy speed
---
Slower vault speed
---
Can't down with frenzy
---
Longer stun time
---
No blood in frenzy
---
Can't open lockers in frenzy
---
Missed attacks cancel frenzy
---
Longer frenzy recharge time
---
Can only frenzy with a full meter.
---
How is this a buff?
---
Then you're just handicapping yourself
---
At this point, why can't I just open the gates while the generators are off and just let em go myself.
---
Well we can roll with good killers don't really have a chance against good swf or good killers don't even have a chance against a couple of good survivors thrown together.  Make your choice
---
As is there's still a massive disadvantage in the numbers for a killer to win and if we're saying that swf isn't required for survivors to meet that level of efficiency than there's clearly something wrong.
---
the killing them out of spite thing is too real, I feel called out...
---
amen
---
So is the legion now heavy with the holiday punch
---
no thanks I don't want to hear someone eating chips into their mic tyvm
---
\*smacks hand away\* im getting my ass on a gen .
---
So we shouldn't say anything?
---
Then how would BHVR know that current 2.7.0 is a bag of wet dicks?
---
20 -&gt; 15, thats 1/4th of the time to open the door, gone. 5 seconds is a long time in this game. There were a lot of times as survivor where if I had only 1 or 2 extra seconds, I would have opened the exit gate in time, same goes for killer where there were a lot of times where a survivor would have escaped if they had a few more seconds. Well, now they give those extra seconds. It was already inpossible to protect both exit gates without remember me unless you had a high movement speed killer, now it's impossible to do so even with remember me.
---
But his power is nothing more than a free first hit. And that's not a guarantee and it seems like there's no point in even using his power now. Mend timer is never going to go down, it doesn't even matter if it hits zero if you're in the process of mending. Honestly just seems like another basic m1.
---
See, thing is, you probably told that to someone who DOES speak "proper English". Is that the only comeback you have? Step up your game, bud.
---
Getting more variety in the killers making the game more fun and exciting? No thanks, I prefer to nerf an already week killer
---
Downing with frenzy doesn't matter because he has actually speed to catch up to surviros after he's affected them. No blood is fine? That was used to make the cheese happen, but I would agree that's a nerf seeing as they made the mend timer not go down in tr anymore. Frenzy with a full meter means you won't need to rely on using it constantly in a chase if you tag them the first time seeing as you can't down with frenzy, and on that downing with frenzy was upsetting everyone anyway so they took it out. Frenzy should be used to apply mend and get a free hit practically, it shouldn't be a crutch, and they've demonstrated that perfectly with the changes. It's only confusing now because of how everyone saw legion, now they've got a new playstyle and base ms. I'm just waiting until they fully release it for people to get some perspective on legion.
---
i literally never saw anyone complaining about pig other than some small complaints about her jumpscare potential, but even then: hag, myers and beads spirit exist.
---
Kinda wish they‚Äôd implement this change to a new game mode instead of just making it standard across the board. Idk man, I like it as is and don‚Äôt want to lose that. Why not both??
---
reason i stoped running ruin
---
And how do you know if that person knows English or not? The sentence was entirely correct so if that your only comeback, move along.
---
*-Really fucking angery oink noises-*
---
Yes, they take forever to release them.
---
I'm not sure playing her at rank 21 counts
---
Because the devs don't know their own game. Personally I think its better to have the end game timer slow down if someone has an RBT as if they were hooked
---
Oh
---
For
---
FUCK
---
SAAAAAAAKE
---
Like I said, you have the option to disable it. I understand that there will be many that wish not to chat, but in order for a better style of balance, I see this as a big stepping stone into properly balancing the game.
---
Pig with pink add-on literally has wallhacks. 
---
Js.
---
Legion is slighty above Wraith and below Plague tier and most importantly, he requires skill and actual knowledge of the game to be played, unlike before. And do you mind mentioning the survivors buffs and indirect killers nerfs? Perhaps you consider mindgameable coldwind tiles to be a killer nerf and a survivors buff somehow?
---
I'll say it again but if we make the game a more team-based game (tools for other survivors to have more communication options) to make solo experience more comparable to SWF we can more easily buff killers that way
---
It doesn't matter since Feng has a different system than them.
---
Not true. They already confirmed on the Forums that they are reviewing some of the Legion changes specifically to Feral Frenzy run speed and vault speed due to feedback.
---
The Spirit also underwent many changes during the PTB due to feedback. She ended up being a great killer since we shared our thoughts on her. 
---
Doing nothing or sulking is not a solution. This is your game as much as it is anyone else's and you deserve to be heard.
---
Forgive me to not have a source for this as I‚Äôm answering from mobile but the door times used to be shorter like a year ago, maybe more than a year? 
---
Sure, you get that one game occasionally where someone would get it/wouldn‚Äôt get it but that‚Äôs not a norm.
---
This sub just really likes to treat every change like an armageddon. It‚Äôs only in testing and every single one of us can test it thoroughly and express themselves in the surveys they will put up.
---
Well if part of her kit was to keep someone hostage then its even more reasonable to change it. She is a weak killer and this small nerf was not neccessary but i wasnt something to rant about as much as people do.
---
Can you make the original Hillbilly one? I‚Äôd definitely buy this for my desk.
---
GOOD. Finally.
---
I really dug Legion‚Äôs theme tbh
---
Fooking *wheeze* ded 'ard *sputtering laughter*
---
If he runs fatigue reducing addons + Iron Maiden you're in for some major ass whooping when you do this, my man. Do at your own risk.
---
i'd be pissing on that grave.
---
They literally removed half her fucking toolkit you fucking cheese cracker. Traps provide almost no pressure mid game unless you just use it to keep finding the guy with the trap on his head as he goes for boxes. Which is pointless. Hey, kinda like the Legion "rework"! I'm sensing a running theme here...
---
Hatch will spawn for the last person regardless of gens. For 2+ survivors it uses the same formula as always. 
---
I don‚Äôt see an issue with this as you can close it now. It gives for an equal footing.
---
You obviously don't play Pig. She doesn't have the strength to close most games out in the midgame. The way you will generally use her traps is you drop one on your first down, another one in the midgame and then save the last one or two, depending on how the match is going for the end game because it lets you turn around a losing situation. And you'll find yourself in the end game a lot as Pig because she is not a good killer.
---
Survivor: ‚ÄúWhy did you hook me/make me run away? I wanted to die to the endgame.‚Äù
---
Me, Killer: ‚ÄúI want to play the game, why didn‚Äôt you just hide if you want to see it so badly?‚Äù
---
Survivor: ‚ÄúNo.‚Äù
---
I‚Äôve had several of those today lmao.
---
If that would be true they would have done it already. I'm pretty sure they are better at predicting sales of their cosmetics and whether it's worth working on them or not than anyone in this comment section.
---
Before, they pushed out updates and then tried to fix as they went, now we have testing phases to try and catch stuff before it goes live so they can focus on their chapter and mid chapter cycles.
---
What I meant in my previous comment was that the amount of chapter's we've been getting isn't much different that what we got before, it is just a lot more structured and steady now instead of throwing out all those little updates they did before year 3.
---
Survivors are allergic to nightshades, pea soup only! üò°
---
It's definitely not the worst, especially for newer players. Getting 4 stacks will massively help with getting other perks.
---
Can you explain the nerfs? I'm out of the loop.
---
I want to hear survivors laugh, infact clown should get laughing gas as a new add-on.
---
What do you mean? That's literally the point of it. You put a trap on someone and they're forced to stay, while the rest of the survivors leave them behind or risk also getting caught to save them. This is far from a small nerf.
---
I those stickers.
---
These changes only affect late game mid game is till fine. You still use traps to slow game down untill last gen is done. If you have to relay on traps to get kills then good luck.
---
But facecamping usually gets you an entity displeased ending ü§î
---
You can't reduce the timer like that when you play with random people - you have to understand this. I know where you come from but I you should've known by now that to play a solo queue + rank resets + current pip system = shitshow. The 14 years old from random country will open the gate 10 of 10 times cause hes random 14 yo and has only so much brain and you can't blame it on him lol.
---
Also reducing the timer by the killer in the current state seems weird because the killes opens the door instantly - I dont know why. If they had to wait the same 20 seconds that would be another story. I think currently is way too easy to abuse BW by getting down someone around the door and go open it, or if you are Billy or Nurse you can jump across the map, open the door, go back  and still BW
---
They didn't kill legion, they took them off the short bus and made them sit with the rest of the killers that aren't braindead.
---
Unlearn Copy and Paste, please
---
That scenario is not the issue. The traps will also be inactive if they are put on after all gens are powered. If a Pig has traps left at that point they bexome literally useless. Previously if you downed someone after the gates were powered you could apply a bit of pressure with the traps which is now impossible.
---
no, the trap must be on a person when the generator is triggered to activate.
---
Yeah they leave him and he gets hatch. Now that you can close hatch there would be literally now way to escape as last survivor if traps worked.
---
Maybe try actually reading what I said: Her midgame pressure is nonexistent, even on live build. This "logical change" nerfs her end game capabilities and gives her _nothing_ to compensate. It is literally a straight nerf, to the one area she actually had some viability.
---
RBTs no longer activate when there are no gens left, inactive RBTs no longer kill survivors exiting through the exit gates, RBTs no longer work in the terror radius.
---
Tldr: RBTs are now a cosmetic item the survivors can bring home if they feel like it
---
There's a bigger , updated list from 1st March 2019.
---
The example you use for mid game, it is now the same case even before changes. Yeah traps itself dont apply much pressure but that is the shit design at base. The late game pressure was not huge unless you tunnel the guy who has trap on him. If you dont do it, then they take it off or use hatch. She is weaker late game but not as much.
---
They expect you to do 3 gens and be bored
---
.
---
Ww2 edition ps4 I see you‚Äôre a (wo)man of class as well
---
Well but we play the video game and its hard to coordinat with team of random people.
---
I just wish Nurses Calling would show up in my god damn blood webs.
---
Bravo, have my silver, ‚Äòit‚Äôs yours now
---
Speaking from experience, they don‚Äôt. They look at time played after you buy a DLC
---
I tought Legion changes would be ok, but additionally to the announced changes, they also increased his frenzy stun, they increased the frenzy cooldown from 15 seconds to 20 and they increased the vault times in frenzy
---
The gates *being powered* encourages the kill to camp gates though
---
They really didnt go overboard. Hes a mid tier killer who cant just mindlessly swing at you until you die regardless of what you do. Legion was a giant tumor of a killer that needed to change.
---
Alright, I'm done trying to reason with someone who doesn't actually read what I say.  Have a good day, maybe one day they will find a cure for you.
---
When you chase someone else the survivor with the RBT doesn't get any pressure as long as he does a gen close to the survivor getting chased and her endgame is dead. This has nothing to do with tunneling the trapped survivor. The trap didn't work on chases before, which was a good anti tunneling mechanic alteady
---
Hatch grabs still needed to go or the standoff would still exist.
---
The biggest nerf to Legion that is UNDOCUMENTED is that he loses 100% of feral frenzy charge when stunned, even when he is not currently using it. That one seriously rustles my jimmies, man. So not even getting the first hit is in Legion's favor when there's a pallet nearby. It's pretty much -&gt; get stunned before getting the first hit with feral frenzy, and you will be a normal M1 killer this chase, since it's not worth it to wait for feral frenzy to fully recharge.
---
The survivors are supposed to always have a chance to escape by design of the game. And I'd hardly call 2 down 2 to go as the killer clearly outplaying your team, especially since the killer can now choose to power all the gens early. 
---
That was just a specific scenario, plenty variations would exist.
---
Well then show me who does. You can tell me that you play vs Remember me and late game Pig every other game? Im basing my opinion on what i see because there are no stats on that. If you give me good source which will show that over 1% of community uses those then fine but if not then it looks like everyone cries about changes that does not matter.
---
It seems like they aren‚Äôt really listening to what their players want. Eventually the game could die off if they keep doing crap not a lot of people want
---
And what of this is confirmed to go live and worth a panic? These values can be changed in matters of  a hotfix. I doubt they are going to kill them that badly. The whole style changes which will need adjusting by the players.
---
since the RBT serves literally the same purpose as the end-game collapse which is "do something or die", the timer could just stop entirely when RBT is active and it would be fine
---
and the terror radius change is irrational and can't be saved in any way, just fuckin reverse it
---
Oh no they do. But they aren‚Äôt the greatest players (they aren‚Äôt bad but let‚Äôs be real they don‚Äôt really play it the way the majority does) and make changes based on their experience. Which is obviously shit coz as we once saw they couldn‚Äôt deal with insta blinds (not saying they should‚Äôve stayed but just saying a lot of killers didn‚Äôt have a problem with them) and then removed them because of it, along with double pallets (good change but still wasn‚Äôt necessary as killers still had an easy time winning). I just wanna vent completely unrelated but what I don‚Äôt get about their decisions is they remove double pallets, and then bring out more perks that make pallets a little bit worse for survivors (spirit fury, and also legion I guess but he‚Äôs not a perk). It‚Äôs weird but pallets are still fine at least.
---
Herein lies the crux of DBD's balance issues;
---
"Survivor who does well and has a shit team also should have a chance to escape".
---
This game is 4v1. Survivors' strength should come from the fact that there are FOUR of them, but this change gives too much power to the individual Survivors. 
---
Plus, if you're a good Survivor, you should know when to sacrifice your team to prioritise gens. There was a distinct thrill to desperately trying to get that second gen as your team is slaughtered. That will be lost.
---
Pig won‚Äòt be dead by any means.
---
Yet you waste your life puttin down other people‚Äôs play on a social media app. You‚Äôre cool.
---
Few months ago: It's weird that Legion can't see people mending, can you make it so nurse's calling works like Snap out of it and waking up. \*Takes nurses calling off both\* 
---
Now: It's kinda bullshit Legion can moonwalk you for 15 seconds and you go down. \*Suddenly thinks pig moonwalking is a thing\*
---
Man on his way in and on his way out, he just wants to bring every killer down with him.
---
I didn't see anyone say it was nerfed. It is just useless because all gens are blocked anyways if the killer closes the hatch.
---
Wrong it will not be refunded, and you forgot about the part where they buff nurse.
---
Have closing the hatch override a Survivor's attempt to jump through it.
---
Why should Survivors get an uncounterable mid-chase hatch?
---
Ehhh no. Like I fully understand the DC. You impacted and stopped and then the survivor goes down? I‚Äôve never understood why Billy and Bubba have such stupid hitbox hitting ability like this. Especially the pallet buff for them. A stun should be a stun and cancel the attack IMO. 
---
The amount of times I‚Äôve been hit through walls is infuriating, not just by Billy and Bubba. Hit boxes are seriously messed up and have been for months.
---
Yea I had many problems with legion and didn‚Äôt voice my concerns. One voice maybe wouldn‚Äôt have made a difference but with my friend group we probably could have. The devs still didn‚Äôt listen to a lot of the advice but maybe if there were less memes and more actual discussions about legion in PTB then we could‚Äôve had a back and forth discussion with the rest of the player base and ideally BHVR.
---
They should‚Äôve made the timer *decrease* for every Survivor hooked. 
---
Keep the downed Survivor thing the way it is, but when they get hooked it should chunk away like 20-30 seconds.
---
Tell me how they fixed pig?
---
Put a nerf gun aiming at it there
---
Unnecessary, yes.  
---
Threatening the killer's "viability" no.   
---
The main part of the Pig's ability is the dash. The traps will net you a kill in what, maybe every 10th game if even that? They are only meant to delay the game. The only shift in playstyle will be that endgame trapping isn't as good anymore so you will early game trap to waste time.
---
This was true 2 years ago. Its been almost nothing but killers buffs and survivor nerfs since then.
---
The problem is that they proposed the changes in the first place. It shows a startling lack of awareness for a game that they developed.
---
Him. Legion. Actually, it's multiple people, so them? But I was talking about the Legion. Wait. Is this post about the pig changes? It sucks, but I don't think it's worth it to review bomb a game we love.
---
They just gave him counterplay and a very different playstyle, removing all the exploits that were going on with the old kit (walking backwards and shenanigans like that).  
---
The new playstyle is: hit 1-4 survivors to apply bleeding, commit to chasing one while the others mend (pressure) and get that one guy you committed to.   
---
Survivors can actually play the game against a Legion now.
---
I agree.
---
I do aswell dude, i personally don‚Äôt think either legion or pig will be bad in any way, both will just require a new playstyle.
---
imagine wanting to quit because you don't like some visual effects.
---
there's so many reasons to quit.. and that's what you choose
---
Traps don't count down in TR instead of in chase.  
---
  
---
Traps only activate on Gen completion, so if you have any left after Gen 5 pops, they are wasted. 
---
Survivors can walk out the door with a trap on their head if it's not active.
---
"am I really gonna defile this grave for upvotes? of course I am"
---
I think he meant it more as, take a break from the game or dont take it as seriously.
---
Well doesn‚Äôt necesarily since they spotted a problem we didn‚Äôt especially now with endgame collapse, they‚Äôve tested it and we barely have.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the Legion nerf, but they will need to actually rework them eventually. The Pig nerf was an obvious lazy ‚Äúbalance‚Äù decision to AVOID reworking her to have her adapt to and match the EGC changes. And Freddy‚Äôs rework very well just could be another bullshit nerf. This dev team doesn‚Äôt know how to rework and is also too damn lazy to learn how or do it right. If they can‚Äôt fix it or ignore it, they break it more so people stop using it and stop complaining eventually. 
---
But if they ruin Freddy, AGAIN...so help me.
---
Wait how does the pig have whispers now?
---
Nea too OP, nerf her, not Pig!
---
is the 2x a confirmed event? they haven't done one forever..
---
Can you try rewording that? I have no clue what you are trying to say.
---
Considering you get a shit ton of addons from the bloodweb it doesn't really matter how good a killer is without addons.
---
Not only notifications, sounds are more screwed in this patch or at least it feels pretty inconsistent so far
---
It's unfair for anyone (aside from killers) to suffer for mistakes they make.
---
And the bunny hoodie would be specific to Feng. What's your point?
---
"THE KILLER IS THE POWER ROLE!!!!"
---
Is not an argument. It is still a game and needs to be fun for both sides. The killer is already in the advantageous position with the new hatch mechanics. Also I don't see how is the survivor rendering the killer utterly powerless.
---
If your suggestion would be implented, killers would still camp the hatch until the survivor shows himself, dragging the game out even longer.
---
Mostly pig. I can see where both are coming from in the sence that the legion was nerfed or buffed. (nerf because you need to put effort into playing them xd). 
---
But honestly there are way more killer nerfs than you see when you first read it. Gates faster (survivor buff), remember me nerf and assuming that borrowed time is still deep wounds that doesn't go down in terror radius either unless it doesn't count.
---
because when you finish a gen you have to run potentially across the entire map to get to an exit gate. then you have to wait for the killer to go to the other door so you can start opening it. but it could be a nurse or any movement killer that will be back in a flash so you'll end up in a chase before you can finish it.
---
the gate could also have remember me etc
---
then you'll probably end up being forced to die by end game collapse when you're in a chase.
---
it's just not enough time i don't think if it finishes on last gen.
---
i think you're all misunderstanding the point of end game collapse. it's not supposed to be some big mechanic that will help you get kills at the end. think about it like reverse bear traps, you shouldn't expect to get kills from it because it helps you in other ways.
---
end game collapse is simply to make survivors leave in the end game instead of staying to mock, search chests, farm extra points and waste your time.
---
Nevermind, I got it. And you are missing the point. Yes they "tested" it, but obviously didn't take how the game is into account. It shows that they barely play their own game.
---
Exactly. Wait, are you a dev in disguise?
---
Sorry but thats just not true. With a SWF, the gens go too quick, the survivors can waste the killers time for too long and the coordination helps to make sure everyone gets out.
---
the new update is just a big middle finger to killers
---
Just go for the bear trap then
---
Please don‚Äôt do this to the pig...
---
I love how Meg mains get hate...but yet no one ever bitches at the shitty Sandbagging, hook farming, traitorous Claudette‚Äôs out there....
---
Ye I can agree but if that is honestly what we have to do to get the devs to listen to us I'm really scared for the game.
---
Ah thanks for clarifying, still it sucks i didn't really see a reason to nerf the pig. I'll still play her tho i have fun doing so.
---
Review bombing isn't a good idea in an asymmetrical game. One side will review bomb when their side gets nerfed and vice versa resulting in the score to go down no matter what they do.
---
Wait was that not what WGLF was?
---
Then maybe stay true to yourself and don't use it?
---
Same. I play survivor because I cant enjoy killer anymore. It's way too stressful and simply un-fun unless you happen to be good at a top tier killer. Not all of us are good enough to do very well on a mid tier killer after all and that's just reality.
---
What‚Äôs been changed about my main? (Legion)
---
Then don't miss lol, it's not like it's hard to get close to survivors in feral frenzy; you're much faster than them and they can't use pallets or windows. The worst thing about legion before for me was watching them miss 30 times and not get punished at all like in this video  [https://youtu.be/6kl5sC8Y1AI?t=838](https://youtu.be/6kl5sC8Y1AI?t=838) .
---
&gt;The only shift in playstyle will be that endgame trapping isn't as good anymore so you will early game trap to waste time.
---
This shifts the total playstile of the pig to be honest. She was the second best end game killer. End game was pretty much her thing
---
Which change would you say displays this the most?
---
What‚Äôs sad is there‚Äôs a lot of people with this or at least similar logic on here that somehow get supported.
---
Oh my god wtf. I used to only use the traps after the gens were completed.... Fck you bhvr
---
Not many people were using the traps to kill people *or* claiming that they did. But the fact that the traps *can't* kill people means they have no reason to remove them.
---
Since traps could kill you if you tried to leave the gate, you had to remove them. So people removed them. This means that nobody (normally) dies to the traps but it *does* stop people from leaving so they can avoid dying to the traps. Now, they can just avoid dying to the traps by walking out the gate. No more stall.
---
Thanks bro, good to know someone‚Äôs got my back

Im waiting for every killer to be nerfed now man.
---
Use spine chill and you dont even have to look away from the gen
---
I don't think these nerfs are as bad as people make them out to be, because active traps still trigger at the exit gate, you just can't save all you traps until the 11th hour now (which wasn't that great of a plan anyway)
---
Hey I have that gun! I lost all tis all bullets though :(
---
Because her RBT had the potential to be a game changer at end game collapse
---
The Pig Terror Radius change. It actually does nothing to prevent a Pig from tunneling a trapped survivor, since her ability _removes her Terror Radius._ It would make sense if she didn't have that, but since she does it is almost like they don't play their own game.
---
Hope ya enjoy your stay
---
That's not even the point of this conversation. The point is that endgame collapse won't do anything and basically everything in the patch is a killer nerf.
---
How about shorten the timer as well. Leave the pig alone. Make the clock start after the last gen pops.
---
Hello fellow killer mains.
---
Agreed but the circle jerk doesn't agree with you
---
Imagine thinking the end game collapse is survivor sided?
---
Good. This sounds great
---
They updated all maps so that a minimum of 8 pallets spawn. If the map rng does not generate enough tiles to where it can place pallets you can get something like this. This however also means that you only have 8 pallets to play with.
---
Could just be a bug, it does say "inactive" traps in the notes
---
Doesn't change the fact that they had over a year for the rework.
---
+ Its now always hatch for the last survivor no matter how many gens are left, and with the changed hatch mechanics instead of being able to apply more pressure the survivor actually gets an entirely new way to escape. Essentially unless the survivor is braindead or very very unlucky the escape is guaranteed. You are last one alive? Good, find a gate and immerse yourself next to it. The killer now has to close the hatch to prevent you from using it. Once closed, the gate powers up. Now open and leave, the killer has 15 sec to check both gates, good luck with that even for a nurse.
---
They did this to fix an issue Pig players abuse. haHAA let's get a trap kill by following the survivors until they inevitably die. They try to get a trap off? you just stand up and force them to run away. Big fun. Oh and the bear traps at the exit gates? Because no one wants to be forced to stand in the map with a closed hatch and the trap active. Think about the other side before whining about why they make decisions. They didn't want to make this change but they had to in order to work w/ the end game collapse.
---
I can somewhat see where you're coming from, but the killer's hostility (at least it feels that way from the chat) makes it seem odd. I don't see how standing around while I spend at least 5 minutes doing gens helps anyone. Don't get me wrong, I like farming, but I also don't want to spend a lot of time just running around the map throwing pallets and cleansing totems.
---
(I don't mean to blow off your points or anything, if I come across like that I'm sorry I'm just really bad with words. ;-;)
---
Mid tier M1 killers can still wreck. See Wraith. Just learn to mind game since you can't rely on jumping over every fucking obstacle in the game anymore.
---
I can appreciate the idea, potentially as a rare, but it seems to be that the iridescent add-ons are the catharsis items for killers who've been pushed too far. Something so rare that you use it when you really NEED a win.
---
Yeah they are trying to balance/fix things to make the game fun to play not stressful experience. They fixed a lot of exploits that someone might not now about.
---
they all have their profile on private
---
I‚Äôm sorry but that doesn‚Äôt change much. They can still be harassed. I get they were dicks but.
---
What? you can get banned for that? It happened twice to me as killer, suddenly another killer appeared in my game, I didn't even know the guy... The second time it happend I just left the game. Fun to know I can get banned for doing nothing wrong?
---
Scratched Mirror Myers (AKA Jumpscare Myers) has wallhacks at 32m.
---
Please post the funniest 1s
---
Finaly someone else who calls for a Nurse nerf. Just because she needs a lot of skill to properly use doesn't mean it's OK that she's pretty much broken when you know how to play her
---
You have to consider camping and... Idk i would say that it is great how it is.
---
Much easier said than done. Besides, one of pig's best strengths was that she had the best endgame stalling of all the killers. This heavily lowers her ability to do that.
---
Don't hold your breath on it getting fixed before the mid-chapter patch goes live. In fact, the PTB patch is loaded with current AND new bugs, there's fun for everyone!
---
Everytime lol
---
What‚Äôs this picture from?
---
No no you‚Äôre fine. Like I said, he was probably just  annoyed you wouldn‚Äôt farm more because he lost a Pip. A lot of killers consider it fair to ask that you give them points as well for letting you live. Some are super aggressive about it too. But at the same time there are survivors who literally don‚Äôt want a pip if they feel they didn‚Äôt earn it. (And same for killers) 
---
There wasn‚Äôt a need to be angry or aggressive at you. It‚Äôs fairly easy to communicate that you want to farm or a survivor to do something. I usually grab them or down them and then take them to what I want them to do. Take them to a Gen and smack it until they get on it, or a door. Swing until they follow me to a totem, the hatch, Gen, etc. He clearly didn‚Äôt communicate to you guys what he wanted well enough and they‚Äôd hardly your fault. Neither of you is obligated to accept the farm.
---
Anyone able to summarize these nerfs for me?
---
What, did he kill someone lately?
---
I mean they should fix it... It's clearly a game breaking bug :/
---
Does it still happen on PTB?
---
It's the stun + having to wait for your ENTIRE gauge to fill up again before you can use your power. Their power is now incredibly high risk with a very low reward.
---
On the contrary to your beliefs, Dead By Daylight is a video game. Both sides should have a chance to complete the game. So in some cases, yes, Survivors deserve the right to think they can escape. As the same with a Killer, they believe they have the right to kill all 4 people.
---
&gt; The only annoyint thing is that I can't understand what they are saying in postgame chat, lol.
---
Most of the times you don't want to know. We're rude people
---
Not surprised after they made Jake's long hair look like fucking seaweed a while back.
---
Its ok if you dont get it, just wait until you get competitive online players and keyboard wizards playing nurse like its nothing.
---
Nurse isnmy least played killer, i miss like half of my blinks, maybe more, and in rank 1 before the bs rank changes against the best survivors i could still manage 4ks at times lol. I should be doing that at my nurse skill level.
---
Yeah, I figured :D
---
Remember Me needed one with the EGC. 30 seconds extra on a door would be 45 seconds.
---
***CAN YOU IMAGINE A 3 MINUTE TIMER WITH AN IRIDESCENT STONE TRAPPER BLOCKING THE EXIT GATES WITH HIS TRAPS***
---
It now makes the doors 31 seconds with all the stacks. Still a lot. still enough the get one trap re-open on the door.
---
1. Its only ptb now so it might not make it to live servers. The hatch closing a long ago didnt make it which made me sad. And now its back.
---
2. They are trying to make fun experience for players. Not having a trap on your head and a pig camping on the hatch with no way to get into a chase, getting rid of the trap or escaping through the hatch, because shes bodyblocking it.
---
I think thats why people like her, she isnt op, she isnt awful, people tend to be chill with pigs ( the survey that guy did a couple of days ago showed she had the lowest dc rate) and it allows for everyone invloved to have a good game , that and her sound effects are adorable
---
PS4 is so unplayable because of this. And since the report/ban system is fake on PS4 people know they can get away with it. Plus there‚Äôs literally no downside to DCing at all right now aside from losing your points (which you can earn in a different game later), items (Again not a loss), and offerings. You get rewarded with a derank that lets you then unfairly snipe lower rank and therefore inferior killers. Virtually no punishment or drawbacks. There has never been a more important time to take action, but the Devs are incompetent and lazy.
---
You know - developers struggle with balancing the game for good survivors and new survivors. If they rework NOED, they will help the new survivors who don‚Äôt know where totem locations are. I have played a couple hundred hours and I still have no idea where some of the totems spawn. Noed is fine with only really good survivors and rewards any killers - good and bad
---
I don't recall wglf working with safe hook rescues
---
Yea the totem wins when you go looking for it
---
I never used mixtapes as is ü§î maybe you just gotta play Legion differently
---
Happened to one of my friends when we were playing when he died killer went invis for us and he was spectating killer instead of us lot of bugs like that, and that was on PS4 I play on console and pc and it‚Äôs super buggy on both
---
Youre only going to walk around if you dont know how to use it. Sprinting eith it snd using it whenever you can is a lot better.
---
Because there are actually some nerfs. Such as Frenzy movement speed being slower, no longer being able to open lockers in Frenzy, needing the power bar to be full to use Frenzy, Frenzy being cancelled when you miss a single swing, Frenzy doing nothing to people that are already in Deep Wounds (without add-ons), the fatigue being longer plus worse vision when fatigued.
---
IIRC, the guy was not reviewing the game. I'm not sure if he was an actual game journalist. The point of the article was that you shouldn't feel bad for making the game easier if it affects nobody except you.
---
Game files i think
---
From a survivor point of view?! I can tell you didn't watch more than 10 seconds in.
---
This seems like a really, really simple solution but you've gotta take one thing into consideration here. It's BHVR.
---
They just announced there would be an Blood Point event early in may
---
They'll activate after a generator completes, and only if a generator completes. If you put a trap on their head after the exit gates are powered, it'll remain inactive and they can now walk out of the gates with an inactive trap on their head.
---
Ohhh, thank you very much!
---
&gt;Completely negating one of her powers for the entire end game, with no recompense, seems like a bad idea.
---
Her main ability is for slowing the game down during the game, not for saving for the end game anyways! So if you still have traps during EGC then you're not playing Pig right in the first place. The only reason to keep traps till end game was to troll/cheese and force survivors to go around to boxes before leaving.
---
Makes sense because the Devs are literally a group of Rank 20s on Killer AND survivor side.
---
Still, figuring out a reasonable nerf for Nurse is quite difficult without having to completely rework her.
---
If she weren't able to blink through walls or different floors, it would already make her somewhat *loopable(?)* but still, she'll catch you way too fast because of her long blinks.
---
I feel like shortening her blinks too much will break the Killer completely, althrough increasing her base movement speed a bit is an option. The question is, would she still be balanced enough for both the Killer and Survivors?
---
I can't think of any reasonable nerf that would make her balanced. Her ability doesn't really fit this game's mechanics at all.
---
Except the concept art was made by the Devs and they have added a community made cosmetic before. The Rogi mask for the Trapper.
---
Take my money
---
Don‚Äôt even joke about this, that Nea nerf actually went live.
---
To me, 5 and 6 were a bit cringy but overall pretty funny.
---
That's diFFerent though as from the start his head and torso are 1 part, due to having his hand having its own cosmetic slot.
---
I had a strategy where I got into a locker with head on and when a survivor got stabbed near me, legion would come to me and I would headbutt and run away.  Guess that is easier now.
---
Yes but tunneling in crouched mode isn‚Äôt very effective, so in my oppinion it‚Äôs a step in the right direction on that regard
---
Nurses that are rank 1 or 2 aren't bad on console.  They are impossible. Everytime one was encountered by my it's always a 4k. It may be less prevelant on consoles though.
---
Another licensed character being rumoured already?
---
Wont that be a while considering we just got plag.
---
It doesnt matter, the change literally changes nothing. In both the Live and ptb builds you can just tunnel while crouching. All the change does is nerf her for normal chases. It is just a straight nerf.
---
Yeah when thats what happen usually when you touch a survivor with the chainsaw?? If the survivor wasn't there he would have gone farther
---
Survivor main i‚Äôm taking?
---
I think the end game collapse is fine as it is, just a way to make sure that the game ends and that no one can take the game hostage.
---
I don't believe they ever intended it to be a huge buff for either side.
---
Nurse should NOT be able to get more than the standard 2 blinks. I am a nurse main, and I know how powerfull it can be. Unfortunatly, I don't know a way to nerf the nurse, without removing her ability completely...
---
Pig would be OP without changes straight up. If she rbts you at the end that's it. You might find the box but imagine having just 3 minutes to find the box and be out. If they didnt nerf her we'd all just be playing the game to survive against piggie everytime.
---
Oh ok
---
How immature is it to just put someone's twitter handle and not block it out? Now they'll get angry DM's and unnecessary attention just because they have a different opinion.
---
D A R N
---
Yes but as i said tunneling in crouched mode is ineffective and will honeslty lead to you only getting one kill that entire game
---
He kills Franklin tho. That's a 4k.
---
RBTs do not tick while in killer's terror radius, whether in chase or not. Survivors can walk out if their RBT is inactive. RBTs never activate if it's placed on a survivor after the gens are done.
---
Yellow Rarity, I wish
---
&gt; And facecamping is not as common a survivor mains make believe 
---
Seems to be subjective but it's definitely a fairly common experience for me. It may not always happen *to* me but I see it happening to others on my team.
---
&gt; And survivors have 16 meta perks and 4 items so cry me a river about how mean killer loadouts are. 
---
Troll builds exist for a reason. It takes decidedly less effort to roam around slapping people versus staying hidden and finding workarounds to various hexes and cheat-level perks like B&amp;C. I've had some of my best matches playing as a killer and it took me until close to level-cap to have a solid match without BP+ offerings as a survivor.
---
&gt; Who cares about your two friends? The vast fucking majority of people think it's fine 
---
I care. That "vast majority" are just the vocal majority who spend a significant amount of their time trolling or acting like a dick on Reddit.
---
&gt; farming is cancer 
---
Frankly, you should have led with this because it'd have saved me any further effort on you.
---
Plague isn‚Äôt licensed?
---
And you‚Äôre missing my point, their change does impact it, it impacts the killer a lot actually, the change changes they way you will play her by a lot, she will require a completely different playstyle now if you want a 4k
---
You may have a point but for what it's worth, I'd say about half of the folks that have sat on hooks had at least a hundred hours in the game.
---
to you as well. I'm not saying every Nurse is a god and can cancel like that, but once you get deep into red ranks at around the 1-4 mark, any Nurse you fight usually mains them and so they know the tricks of the trade as it were. You can technically juke a nurse, my dilemma though is that the skill cap is much higher for nurse, to a point that a survivor literally can't do anything about it. It's like a fighting game, where 2 people of equal skill can have an insane back and forth because the playing field is even, but when it comes to Nurse, there's a point where if they're good enough, there is no escaping it. The match is made null and pointless because their ability to ignore mechanics comboed with decent game-sense is uncounterable in every sense of the word. Not every Nurse is like that, but when you meet one who is, it's demoralizing tbh.

Billy is one of the most balanced killer in the game. The only thing that could be nerfed is the combo Carburettor Tuning Guide + Primer Bulb. (But I hope Devs won't change it since it's the funniest addons combo to play :D)
---
But it's worth to notice than this combo already got nerfed with the Tinkerer changes (introduced with patch 2.1.0).
---
Please keep pewdiepie out of this sub. It's a dead by daylight sub have some originality.
---
Yeah, if you consider walking around and just being an M1 killer as a new playstyle then yeah you're right.
---
Crapper mains rise up
---
It performs a function in that it gives BP.
---
The only function Frank's mixtape serves is to lose.
---
Take one nerf and replace it with another, even worse nerf?
---
Matchmaking should be off of weather or not you're getting lots of kills per match. If you let people live, that's ok.
---
This isn't a thesis, it's my personal observation. Attacking me repeatedly while attempting to assert perceived moral or intellectual superiority with shit sentence structure just makes you look weak.
---
I have much less respect for Reddit tough guys than I do for some cornball camping hooked survivors.
---
They downvote but I bet they are the same ones that way until the last second and turn. I've seen people do that a lot and if you have good timing you will never be sawed unless you get sniped.
---
Happy OINK
---
I don‚Äôt want to be on voice comms with random people. Yeah I could disable it but then I‚Äòd be at an even worse disadvantage if you buff killers based on voice comms.
---
Not to mention that even if you want to use the mic, at least here in Europe where many languages are spoken, and you end up with a Russian/French/whatever 3SWF who may refuse to switch to English.
---
My opinion on this has always been that based on my experience, really good solo survivors can be just as successful as an SWF group. I have been in a rescue mission against a basement camping Leatherface and it worked out so well even in solo queue that I was accused of being SWF scum and voice comm cheater.
---
I had other great coordinated plays in solo queue that felt so awesome exactly because there were no voice comms but really just good players involved.
---
So all that I would wish for is a better matchmaking that considers the players actual abilities and experience rather than rank, this would be the biggest buff that they could give to solo survivors, but that‚Äôs sadly not going to happen.
---
These things are just a reaction to genrushing. If you want to motivate killers to play the game your way, survivors as a whole need to be toned down.
---
Well yeah essentially that is what she becomes, a M1 killer which puts pressure on survivors and slows gen repairs with a RBT which will rarely ever kill.
---
I usually respect their gameplay changes but this pig one makes no sense, just make the end game timer slow down when someone has a trap, treat it like a down or hook.
---
From a business standpoint it only makes sense, killers can't see their cosmetic items while ingame, but survivors can. They must be selling ALOT more survivor cosmetics than killer cosmetics.
---
Reporting for freddy duty. This pig nerf is bull shit....ahem.
---
And which will rarely ever slow gens. The problem with RBT is that it isnt actually pressure, at least not in mid game. It was really only putting pressure in the end game, _but they removed it._
---
Most of the recent reviews are complaints about legacy bugs that still exist (disconnects for example), questionable matchmaking / pip system, etc. Don't be so presumptuous. It's not like BI just had a shit storm befall them like Campo Santo. These are earnest reviews by players with quantifiable experience in the game.
---
I used to main Pig before Spirit and people rarely dcd on me, nowadays its a daily thing
---
And from a business standpoint, it's suicide. Literally pushing away half your playerbase to sell cosmetics is a great way to kill your game fast. Hell just look at Apex.
---
Well that exsplains it, havent been lower than level 10, am now 14?..
---
I mean if a pig wants to waste 2 and a half minutes minimum chasing one guy to death who cares. You can facecamp a guy to death in two minutes
---
&gt; Essentially unless the survivor is braindead or very very unlucky the escape is guaranteed.
---
That was also true of the hatch but at least now you're not going to have a 30 minute hatch standoff over it.
---
For starters, I use them to unlock the characters I don't yet have, after that, I will be saving them up for the next killer and survivor and then I'd spend them on cosmetics
---
You are completely wrong in your last sentences. It seems you haven't spend much time in solo queue recently. Tha amount of times I've been left on my first hook to die without being saved, being unhooked infront of the killer, being left doing a gen while the other guy hides in 2 vs 1 situation, the first guy being downed in the first 10,15,20 seconds of the game, the second guy being downed the 40,45,50 seconds after the first one, seeing people who don't know the basic of the game like scratchmarks work or how to counter BBW, or how to hit skillchecks, or how the killer bility works  for example mirror myers/or myers in general/, or the corrupted puke of the lady or the traps of the hag or how to run the huntress propeprly with her range atacks and I can go on and on - is just insane.
---
Now back your statement that this was a team game. Well it is not or atleast it is nothing like ANY other team game. The devs said many times that they want to keep the solo queue really solo which means everyone to play for himself there. A team game which is for example WoW means you can talk to your team, see their gear and their talentsat any time, being able to check that even before you start whatever you want to do / a dungeon for example/ so you can decide if you want to play with them or not. That is what team game is. The ida of DBD for solo queue is NOTHING like it and you seem to be really out of you mind when we talk about solo queue
---
Yeah. That's what a smart Legion would do.
---
**So why does Frank's mixtape, an add on that does *literally nothing if you don't just spam frenzy* even exist?**
---
It‚Äôs not about the head popping, it‚Äôs about pressure and game control, it used to stop people leaving, now it doesn‚Äôt.
---
Cosmetics. New killers. New survivors. But you do you man!
---
Legion masks for everyone and legion cosmetics for no mask.
---
If all three would be true then any hit by a NOED Pig would be a guaranteed kill.
---
Please be a bug....
---
&gt;implying I think Nurse is fair
---
No she's fucking broken and even the devs know that.
---
&gt;Also implying Hag has 0 counterplay
---
She's strong but she has very exploitable weaknesses.
---
Killer*
---
I won‚Äôt be playing her anymore sadly.
---
Slugging is when the killer hits a survivor into dying state, and just leaves them on the ground without picking them up. (Making you crawl around like a slug, lol) 
---
Respecting pallets is when the killer hesitates before going through a pallet so that if you WERE to throw it down, it WOULDN'T stun them.
---
Cardboard, clay, and paint. There was an earlier reply below.
---
I saw after I commented.
---
Their point is that a purple addon which is quite expensive should be more viable
---
Right, but you have 2k hours, so you‚Äôre not a new player anymore. Reworking NOED will help exactly the new players who don‚Äôt know all of the totem spawns. And frankly, NOED is TOO good not to be used for both good and bad killers at the same time, whereas NOED is ok only for decent survivors who can escape without being downed, know when to take a risk, or have cleansed all the totems because they know their usual spawn locations
---
Nurse, yes! Billy... No. The chainsaw is the only thing that takes some time to perfect, but even then it takes less time to do so when compared to other killers abilities. Plus theres always the possibility of chain sawing/one hitting a survivor, no matter the skill level
---
They can only leave with them on if they are inactive at the time.
---
BHVR: Yes.
---
wrong game
---
don't forget that killers can heal survivors now and survivors can kill the killers.
---
Slugging: leaving survs down instead of hooking them, often very helpful but many killers don't realize when to do it or refuse to do it.
---
Respecting pallets: you know those leatherfaces that take 10 steps back at every fucking pallet because they're scared of a stun? Yeah basically that.
---
Well, I'd keep two things in mind:
---
- Seeing how bad they are at coding things, chances are most of your hooks will be safe even tho the guy goes down on the ground anyway. Deliverence is currently almost impossible not to activate when un hooking someone. Look at this [example.](https://youtu.be/9El4qi0LfZ8?t=144) So even tho they've introduced this change, chances are you can still farm people despite of it.
---
- It still discourages farming, which imo is a good thing.
---
You don‚Äôt have to buy a DLC or cosmetics lol.
---
Even though I‚Äôm a survivor main, I‚Äôd probably make a Claudette to hang on there... she suuuucks.
---
There is no point of rbt now, just rush through Gens while you have a trap in your head and BOOM! after the Gens are done end game collapse begins and the traps are deactivated.
---
He‚Äôs no longer unique, he‚Äôs just a trapless trapper now.
---
As a South African, it's good news for me. We used to playing on European servers for any pick of a popular game. From LoL to Overwatch, any survival game to For Honor. We get max about 180ms, which while isn't ideal - it's not that bad.
---
What makes it extra good for us... Assuming we get paired on Eu servers, is that we can actually play. I bought the game a year ago and the matchmaking is the worst I have ever experienced and it's paired us with Thailand,Argentina, Japan etc. for god knows what reason and 500+ ms and sometimes taking 15min to find a game.
---
&gt;surveillance would like to know your location
---
I'm all in favour of supporting behaviour but...this change just doesn't make sense at all!
---
Why would I ever bring a perk that MIGHT come into play in 1% of my games when literally any other perk gives more value?
---
It's not even a gimmick perk, it doesn't combo with anything realistically. Why would they bother changing it but leaving its uselessness intact? Just...what is the logic behind it?
---
Still no matter what addons you use Myers can only go to tier 3 like 3-4 times maybe where as with the other two there is no limit and they have addons to make the saws instant.
---
No, actually you need to go above and beyond 4k to get Merciless now. IIRC you need to hook people 10 times for Iridescent emblem for example, generator emblems have been harder to accrue as well as penalty-free distance from hook has been increased, so you need to not only 4K, you also have to completely crush them to get Merciless
---
When all  Gens are done, the end game collapse begins and then the traps become inactive,  it's a BIG FINGER to the pig.
---
*laughs in Carter*
---
Actually HybridPanda did that in kill your friends and it worked... He placed a trap on one survivor before the last gen was done and another one on another after the last gen was done and even if he was crunched the one that placed before the last gen start beeping when the survivor got past the gate and it popped while the other one left since the trap wasn't even active
---
tfw Ruin insta down
---
This is way too acurate
---
Imagine thinking that making it easier for survivors to escape is not better for survivors?
---
She also got a huge buff. Those nerfs are just ment to compensate.
---
Correction: *all traps get put on the floor, and all Amanda can do is stare at them and let out a sigh*
---
It hasn't been mentioned since it has been always like this
---
Gotta make sure killers dare not have any fun
---
If your looking at it like that then I don‚Äôt know what to tell you, it lets a killer instantly create map wide pressure and it will make survivors play way more reckless because they have a time limit, that‚Äôs how the killer takes advantage
---
It hasn't, it only got drained when you actively used it and got stunned.
---
These are very much needed
---
That video is HQ
---
The time lot only activates when the exit gates are opened, making it nearly useless for creating pressure. Even if the killer closes the hatch to try and stop them the exit gates are immediately powered making it still hard to stop them. It‚Äôs a direct killer nerf and has even lead to the pig nerf
---
Both sides already have a fair chance of winning the game, that is why there is no point in these pig nerfs that are only logical in fringe circumstances which could only be caused by survivor misplay early in the game. They don't need to balance these cases, because this way, the earlier mistakes of survivors don't mean anything at all.
---
The way the game is now, you can do well with any killer so long as there isn't a 4 man swf with voice coms and/or strong perks against you. Killer is the easiest it's ever been right now and you can make any killer work.
---
Im happy with the ones i own and have every character
---
This Legion nerf did nothing lmao, I decided to play a game and as long as you can aim your attack during frenzy properly he is still OP af.
---
Survivor mains needs to stop considering every death a loss. If 3k is a full killer win, then so are 3 escapees, no matter if you are the one who died, and a 2k is a draw. Not everyone is ment to escape, just like not every game has to be a 4k.
---
That‚Äôs not true at all, they gave survivors more blood points for doing things during the EGC people won‚Äôt just leave as soon as the gates are open, and if you don‚Äôt have any survivors being chased when the last gen is finished then that‚Äôs on the killers fault. It is in no way shape or form a killer nerf and if you think that then I‚Äôm sorry but that‚Äôs on you
---
Me: this no way he has noed, he's playing [killer that people almost never use noed]
---
Killer: *has noed
---
If the killer wins, 1 player of 5 is happy.
---
True my bad yet insta hatchet is enough to 4k / 4DC
---
&gt;Killer requires a ridiculous amount of knowledge about the game to simply do "OK" and the devs seem to want to make killers pretty weak with interesting powers.
---
Are you sure? Killer as a whole is in the most powerful place it's ever been at the current moment and the only time a good player will get destroyed is if they're against a strong SWF team or somehow a solo squad have very good coordination. I turn a corner in a chase expecting to get smacked with a pallet but nope there isn't one there and I get the hit. If you know how to counter L-wall/T-walls and the shack while also not respecting pallets then you can end chases pretty quickly, even as a killer that doesn't have much in the form of chase help.
---
Honestly LF wouldn't even be that broken if he didn't get slowed. However if his chainsaw rampage was infinite...
---
You‚Äôre a hateful human being. I hope you find peace.
---
1.) The bloodpoint bonus is strictly better for survivors, so idk why you brought that up when it contradicts your argument.
---
2.) Even if they‚Äôre in a chase, the EGC toner doesn‚Äôt go down when a survivor‚Äôs within the terror radius or in a chase.
---
Sad oink
---
Well you can just play your favourite killer and spend the BPs on the survivor you want to level
---
The point of the blood points is survivors will be less likely to just leave people behind because they want points so that gives the killer more chances to get more people down, and the timer does go down during that, it always goes down but when somebody is downed or hooked it slows the timer down. Chases and terror radius don‚Äôt stop the timer, the only one it stops now is deep wounds borrowed time and the pig helmet timer
---
Certain skins attract certain players and stereotypes exits.
---
Nea - toxic c*NT with flashlights
---
Meg - Running recklessly everywhere
---
Claudette - P3 Invisidettes
---
Dwight - Locker boi
---
And that just happens, blame the people who feed this stereotypes.
---
On that note, why is WGLF not merged with We'll Make It already? Make it more like a survivor BBQ, so BPs and actual gameplay impact.
---
The situation you presented was being facecamped by a Bubba and surviving for 1 minute. Even if the rest of the team escape that isn't a win for me. I would most likely depip and I'd get next to nothing in bloodpoints. The survivor side may win but that doesn't mean I did in that situation and there's nothing I could have done to stop that once I was on the hook. If its a situation where you die to let the others escape then yeah I would consider that a win. For example taking a hit at the gate when the killer has NOED so that the other 3 can run right past or save someone else currently on a hook or in the dying state. If I pip then it's a win for me even if I ended up dying because I know I did a lot for my team.
---
The extra blood points is still just a bonus to playing survivor. No one‚Äôs going to be playing killer after this patch
---
What did they change? I cant find the nurse changes in the PTB Patchnotes.
---
Can you give me a link to the changes?
---
That one rando on the hook rest in peace.
---
Thats your perception of the game, but due to its asymmetry its objectively wrong. Its not 1v1v1v1v1, its 4v1. If you do well enough, and if the killer only gets one kill (you), you should at least get the safety pip, so no problem there, right? The bloodpoints and the pip issue apply to killers too. Just like them you dont have any right to a mandatory "best run".
---
Besides, this has still nothing to do with "need muh 4k" and everything with how it works. Imagine, just like a 4k "isnt mandatory" a survivor 4 escape "isnt mandatory" and so if the killer fucks up hard a sudden quick time event starts forcing the survivors to make ever harder skillchecks on the spot, the first one to fail dies without chance to prevent. Thats the same. Exactly  the same. Just like the killer isnt supposed to 4k every time, neither are the survivors. Just like the killer isnt supposed to kill everyone, they arent supposed to kill none.
---
cute yet terrifying :3
---
You'll see plenty of killers at high ranks, Nurse/Billy/Spirit/Plague/Hag/Legion. 
---
Whenever I watch my friends play they also run to a crap ton of Trappers, for some reason. Weird.
---
Right it might be a bonus for survivor in blood points but it ONLY makes it better for killers since they‚Äôll come back in instead of leaving, I‚Äôm gonna stop replying because obviously you don‚Äôt have a clue what you‚Äôre talking about since you didn‚Äôt even know how the timer worked
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bgm6jd/the_ptb_in_a_nutshell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Don't forget about Freddy
---
I don't get it, she was in a good place, not outstanding, but not bad, fun. Why did they suddenly get the idea to start fucking with this killer :/
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bunch of whiny people on Reddit like it normally is
---
They bring up good points tbh. Did you even read some of the top comments? They‚Äôre worth it, especially for you who I think is stuck in the mindset that survivors are underpowered
---
Yeah I don't get it, nobody cried about piggy. Just legion cries. We get the Legion one and now they want to triger us again for some reason by ruining a good killer :c
---
I think it still isn't enough. It needs to be said on every channel they look at as often as possible and remain a top issue until they say something about it. Not just spring this unnecessary bullshit on everyone and claim it's "logical" right before the PTB is released.  Fuck behavior for this dumb shit. Her traps are already as close to useless as it is. Now there's no use for them at all. Without raising her crouch movement speed to remotely justify this garbage, who the fuck is even going to crouch walk the entire map looking for people just because 1 or 2 people MIGHT have a trap on them. Behavior can fuck all the way off at this point until this shit is fixed.
---
Yes, with all the buffs killers have gotten recently it‚Äôs way more killer sided now, coming from someone who mainly plays killer
---
# RECOVER
---
What buffs? All I‚Äôve seen is them nerfing Legion and Pig?
---
Yup, its not that bad geez.
---
Agreed with /u/_Keezo_ , Doc would be perfect for the role of the Cat here!
---
Maybe you're right, the base ms might have been a quick change they could implement without costing too much time to rearrange his functionality.
---
But then again imo the base ms and terror radius enlargement give him the oompf needed to actually apply pressure in a chase.
---
Frenzy shouldn't be a tool for downing survivors, it should be used for initiating a chase, and tracking other survivors in the vicinity.
---
Honestly I'm as skeptical as some of you, but this is real change that everyone has been asking for, if some things needed to be tweaked more than the rest, eg. Slower vaults, then so be it. If it synergies with the other balance choices when it drops on love servers then that's a bonus.
---
But rn I love the improved legion, maybe now the Dc stigmatisation around his character can fade due to the expulsion of the cheese.
---
Also I separated them for your viewing pleasure, no more text walls pinky swear.
---
Do all spiders spin a web to trap its prey?
---
fair enough
---
I feel like they should either A. Not touch her or B. Slow the RBT trigger time and go back to in chase it doesn‚Äôt go down
---
Refund? You're joking now, right?
---
If I had 5,000+ Shards, I could've gotten Enduring and Nurses Calling for my Wraith. 
---
Eh, Nurses Calling is good enough for now. I'll just grind like hell later
---
Dude you have no idea how much I had to fight the urge to LOL at work when I read this! Everytime I got control of myself I would rethink this and start laughing. My coworkers are looking at me in confusion because I'm the guy with the RBF and also almost silent for the 12 hours I'm at work. You made my day dude
---
Nobody gives a fuck about legion - he was abused and had an OP chase and ruined games and made them no fun.
---
Boo hoo he isn't as good anymore. Cry me a river. There are probably a lot less disconnects now which is way better for the game so I'll take that over the salty tears of unskilled killers anyday..
---
Killer mains: 'Literally bitching in every other post on dbd sub'
---
FTFY
---
Tunnelling out of crouch wasn't effective either. Need I remind you, traps take AT LEAST 2 minutes to trigger.
---
Of course Freddy is better with addons, but he still has to wait that small frame to hit someone, giving them ample time to reach a pallet or vault.
---
Meanwhile legion can catch up to you and vault the safety of a pallet or vault you put yourself behind. 
---
I'll give you credit for Freddy comparison when his rework drops in a month you feel. Because this current Freddy could be shafted or maybe better than most in a month we don't know. 
---
Freddy tracking is only as good as legions with the school photo, if we're talking singular survivor tracking then yes, Freddy is better, but there's no potential behind tunneling with shit tier killers.
---
Your first sentence already made this wrong. If a pig goes into crouch at a pallet you have multiple options, the smartest would be just leaving the pallet loop. By the time she‚Äôs seen you - because she‚Äôs so short in crouch - you‚Äôre already gone.
---
You forgot the part where trap doesn't go down in her tr
---
Killer mains are fookin idiots for thinking that the devs make decisions solely based on this subreddit. Now we just get to see them constantly bitch as they try to undergo a big balance patch. Great. Thats what I want to see on DBD reddit - killers complaining that they can't do X - not funny memes related to the game.
---
I probably see more trapper or myers than doctor
---
Nah, just no.
---
*hears the heartbeat for 0.00015 seconds*
---
I agree and I like all your suggestions. I like the endgame they introduced but most changes around the endgame were unnecessary.
---
I don't like taking the perks away though. I think it is fun if survivors/killer can choose to make a build more suited for endgame/1vs1 scenarios.
---
tbh this guy is right, even Bubba's speed limiter is better than Frank's right now
---
Careful, he might rant on twitter over this
---
Games die fast from listening to communities like reddit. People here act like they are 'the chosen few' who know how to make all games the best but they actually know fuck all. 
---
The backlash from changes the community want once implemented usually completely overwhelms the initial support the change. Don't be fooled by reddits popular opinion mentality. Let them balance their game. People cry so loud before they even test it out.
---
How is it not? If a loop is big enough yes, however most loops are small enough to use this strategy on.
---
Yes, you can say that the Killer deserves the kill, but this EGC isn't to favour survivors, it's to force them to leave, so Killers aren't forced to wait forever.
---
If you get downed while the exit gates are open, it's unfortunate, yes, but there is no way to say that the Killer deserves the kill, much like the Survivor isn't entitled to say they deserve to survive because they simply lasted long enough for the doors to open.
---
But you are also forgetting that Dead By Daylight is an asymmetrical video game and has no chance of ever seeing balance. The developers did this "nerf" (which it isn't really, just a sad decision to work her to fit with the EDC changes.) to make sure that survivors don't feel like they are completely fucked by a mechanic, the traps are to remain as a time waster, not a lethal item. Otherwise, they would've focused more on the lethality of the traps rather than her dash. Her dash is the money maker.
---
All in all, I don't believe she's being nerfed or this change will impact her more. Most likely you will trap early game for the deviousness points.
---
soooo you'd say it's kind of luck based? sounds fair enough
---
They might do that once dedicated servers come, hopefully
---
I think a good compromise would have been to disable the pig traps when the trapdoor closes, giving the survivors a way out
---
I've been reporting people who DC, but that does virtually nothing on Console
---
The time it takes to crouch and uncrouch is too long. Every second matters in this game. If the loop is small or unsafe you might as well just press W.
---
At least you do a sick backflip
---
Seeing this shopped in-game makes me even more desperate for Bunny Feng than I knew I was
---
Aye, that is true. But still, people do it. God knows why and I don't care for it, but I do care about being able to play the video game and not have some degenerate follow me about because they wished the Pig's traps were lethal, as I just put in another post - if they wanted the traps to be lethal, they wouldn't be focusing on her dash. The dash is what makes her so good.
---
It's not good enough to use if u want to win as many games as possible, but it can be very funny against a swf team
---
It just stops any perks of future perks tipping the balance too far one way or the other, it also stops them having to balance around the hatch
---
No, he is. Nice flair btw.
---
I most likely do, I haven't played DBD seriously since the Halloween event, too much NOED &amp; Ruin &amp; other shit to give me enjoyment. I do believe that players will commit to it if they want the kill bad enough, afterall this is the internet and you can't judge someone else's actions based on your own.
---
The Ormond map needs some changes. Especially regarding scratchmarks, blood, but also auras. For both killers and survivors, auras are incredibly hard to see. When playing killer, my BBQ is useless and when playing survivor, I usually have to squint to find out where someone got downed. It alsmost feels like this map has built-in Knock Out and Distortion.
---
I know it‚Äôs a preference but Mikey takes that spot for me. His power feels fair/strong and he‚Äôs still the only killer that makes my heart beat irl or makes me jump so hard that I get a whiplash in my neck when he‚Äôs in tier 1 and gets the jump on me.
---
What pig sticker? All I see is a friendly claudette on her way to help with my generator
---
I think it's bugged. I don't get any loud noise notifications at all, I can't tell if someone's unhooked already or not if I don't look at the icons
---
So wait, the promise of dedicated servers was a lie?
---
It frenzy made MoM activate it‚Äôd be a huge nerf to the perk, especially with how they‚Äôre chasing them. I agree on pig tho
---
The only nerf I agree with is the endgame nerf where the traps don‚Äôt work as it‚Äôs literally built into the game now (minus the dying while trying to escape) and it would be OP as shit if traps worked the way they did on top of Endgame.
---
Trap‚Äôs timer not going down in the terror radius isn‚Äôt really a big problem, considering one of your main abilities is to hide the terror radius.
---
1. So it's okay for something to not be fun for Killers, but unacceptable when it's not fun for Survivors?
---
2. Every Survivor has this endgame, not every Killer has those perks.
---
3. At which point the hatch can be a free out, since they removed hatch grabs.
---
4. Not it isn't. Killer has to chose between one fast exit or two slightly slower ones. Endgame still requires no thought from Survivors. Hell, since the hatch always spawns now, the you could do NOTHING all game and still escape! In the past you at least had to make sure 2 gens were repaired!
---
5. So now Survivor knows where the hatch is and can play around it. If Killer camps the hatch, do gens. When they leave, go for the hatch.
---
6. Gens are 80 seconds each. 3 gens means 240 seconds, aka 4 minutes. Put the aura reveal at 5 minutes and you can still get them done. Remember, gens still exist.
---
In a 1v1, Killer should pretty much always win, because the Survivors' power comes from their numbers.
---
Oh Michael is definitely a close second for me.
---
I get the intent but it would still kinda suck to have your devour hope etc. rendered useless. Since it would only occur once the hatch is closed I guess it wouldn't be a that big of a deal but I am not sure it is necessarry.
---
"They're the same picture"
---
There the same picture. ?
---
Yes, I agree with this one, is it ok if I edit my post accordingly?
---
Is this a personal atack?

&gt; Terror radius thing seems like a natural change given they went the same direction with legion. You can pretty easily trick the game into thinking you're "not in a chase." You can still stalk them to "chase" and get the tick down.
---
For 2 minutes.
---
If you do that to one survivor for 2 minutes and the other three can't get the gates open, your faith in Survivors is absolutely lower than most.
---
meg mains r crying rn
---
Far not everyone learn the lesson, and there are new to come
---
By small enough to mindgame I am refering to roughly 75% of the pallet loops in the game. A truck in autohavens is safe but the pig can use her power to counter it. Your talking out your ass about it takeing too long to uncrouch, it takes 1.3 seconds to uncrouch and during that time your accelerating back up to 115% speed. Please learn pig before you start saying she is more than slightly weak. 
---
This guide will be a good start:

---
Nah the next one
---
&gt;I meant to reply to this much sooner.
---
We're not in a hurry, don't worry.
---
&gt;To call it an issue or unintended interaction at this point feels strange because it‚Äôs been in the game since they were released
---
Nothing about Legion has been changed gameplay wise since released. They only made some visual adjustments to his fatigue. This chapter introduces the first gameplay changes to Legion, so I'd wager they've been holding up on everything they wanted to change/fix about him till now.
---
&gt;Frenzy Locker Grabs drains your power anyway
---
But at that point the chase is over, you have a guy to hook so the power drain is meaningless?
---
&gt;But hey ‚Äúlegun bed gib 3 karma plz‚Äù amirite?
---
I've never said that, I've explained why I think it was called an issue.
---
I have! A Feng was doing the exact same thing to me a while ago. I think it was a farming game, but I didn't really feel like getting downed over and over again, so I just did gens. The Leatherface and Feng cought on, and LF made it his mission to get me. After a long chase all around the map, he finally downed me, Adrenaline kicked in and our chase continued for another couple of minutes. I was close to one of the exits when LF lost me, but Feng was blocking the 99'd switch. LF suddenly appeared again and started chasing me again. I ran to the other exit, which had not been opened yet. After some looping, a random Dwight had opened the other door and I was finally able to escape. That match was wild from start to finish and I got a shitload of points.
---
Alright then
---
The nerfs only affect endgame playstyle Pig, and her active traps still explode at the exit
---
Don't really see how this makes her weak, just don't save your traps until the end?
---
I really dont like the faster gate opening or the killer perk nerfs either, the survivor perk buff is nice tho
---
Goddamn it why did they add so much shit onto it all we wanted was endgame collapse

Well on the DBD forum it's been said by the devs that they're looking into the issue trying to find different solutions
---
Should of said Ash, would make more sense.
---
i have a feeling this will get alotta upvotes, and that hurts me inside
---
Pig can't see if the timer stopped or not, that's only for survivors
---
Well as far as i'm concerned DC'ing has no penalty in the current state of the game
---
Just take legion, and remove about everything from his base kit and make it useless.
---
Yes ‡≤†_‡≤†
---
So if the survivors just do the Gens and open a gate will the EGC begin then they can just leave out the exit gate
---
The EGC is not a buff nor a nerf, but an Endgame Pig during the last 1-2 minutes of the EGC would have been annoying. Not the strongest ever but annoying. So I see why they did the change although I'm sad too beacuse RBTs after the last gen was my favourite thing to do with her.
---
"Bleedout time is no longer removed by Feral Frenzy hits (was 10 seconds per hit). " - from the patch notes
---
After the update there is no point in hitting survivors multiple times, it doesn't do anything 
---
(deep wounds also doesn't show the killer the bleedout timer anymore). 
---
The only point in legions power is to hit them the first time now.
---
You might have won your single match, but either the survivors don't know how to play against legion or you would have done just as well with any other base ms killer.
---
If they wanted that kill that bad THEY WOULD CAMP THEM.
---
Why would they follow for 2:30?
---
Maybe 1 in 500 pigs would do that
---
Hm, that's kinda cool. If I'm lucky, they could see this post. 
---
Btw, I love your Flair
---
*Nurse blinking intensifies*
---
You missed my point, that build is like an anti pallet build that most meh m1 killers use, it's just his power is basically deleted.
---
I don‚Äôt really care for cosmetics, plus I rather not level up a killer I‚Äôll never play. I hope the next few shrines aren‚Äôt that good though, purely for the fact that I want to save my shards for future characters
---
There are dozens of us! Dozens! *Yells from jorts*
---
You wanna talk about the bigger picture. here's the bigger picture. It isn't s "balance change" it's unneeded from the start. Here's part of the bigger picture, traps don't waste time anymore as long as they're in the pigs TR. Which means they can just follow pig around the map going from box to box without ever having an already long ass timer counting down. This problem is even worse on smaller maps where the survivors are generally in the killers TR more than half of the time. For example, her own map. The trap timer already stopped if she chased someone wearing a trap. Traps were meant to waste time for people since it's rare to actually get a kill with them to begin with. No time will be wasted if no one has to ever give a shit about a timer with gen roulette by following the killer around if they have a trap on their head. They can now just ignore the fact there's a trap on their head and leave as they please. That's balance?  Get real.
---
Nothing with pig needed to be changed, even in the last survivor scenario it isn't favored for the pig since she can only be in one place at one time as well as a survivor. the default timer is 2:30. It takes less than a minute to get the trap off your head the greater majority of the time.  the end game collapse timer is 3 minutes. You have more than enough time to get a trap off and leave normally. The change isn't needed and it isn't "logical."
---
Exactly ,I don't care it doesn't hurt or down survivors but if you can't slow down survivors because of a mistake then you get fucked especially on console.
---
It's because BHVR didn't actually want killers to benefit from this. It's nothing more than a tissue paper bandaid. It may look like a real change, but now that it's in you can see it's actually jack shit. The devs wanted to create the illusion that something is different but this does nothing
---
Pig didnt even get buried.
---
She got cooked and eaten.
---
How many BPs do you get for buying a perk you already own again? Nurse's was one of the first few teachables I unlocked; I'm considering whether or not I should spend the Iridescent Shards on BPs or save them in case another perk I want rolls around...
---
I mean, her traps last two minutes. So before the patch suvivors who got trapped after the last gen were forced to get it off with an even stricter timer than the EGC. So why nerf it.
---
if you dont think legion needed a nerf then you have NO say in balance ding dong fuck your opinion
---
Running across map takes a minute or less on the big maps, and gate open time was changed to 15s, so with Remember Me the open time tops out at 31 seconds. So survivors have 1.5 minutes to get out.
---
Now if you had blood warden to the mix it gets more crazy and the timer for that would need looking at.
---
I think the endgame collapse is more of the endgame nice guy entity bounced flashing the lights and telling everyone last call is done time to get out rather than something that threatens the survivors at this point. I'm looking forward to trying the PTB when I can.
---
They are in a good place, and they have far less bullshit to deal with in chases (infinites, pallet vacuums, etc.)
---
But that doesn't mean much considering survivors can finish gens and be opening gates &lt; 3 minutes. This isn't requiring super heroes, this is just people who can hold M1. 
---
The only thing to offset the gen rush is that BHVR said "Well, no pips for you!" if survivors don't play inefficient on purpose.
---
360's and console
---
Do you know how to read? I said legion didn‚Äôt need a nerf ‚Äúding dong‚Äù
---
if only you put the "They're the same picture" woman under it
---
Why?
---
yeah the endgame collapse seems dumb, and not needed
---
&gt; But they need to rework a lot of powers and perks that play into the end game.
---
What got reworked? Because everything the Killer has that is end game viable just got nerfed the to ground with the exception of Noed. These changes aren't in favor of the killers because the only survivors it punishes are the assholes who don't **get the fuck out of the game because they want to waste 10 minutes searching for the hatch or teabagging at the gate**. Meanwhile, an entire archetype of Killer is being nerfed to the ground.
---
Remember Me? Even less of a reason to take it.
---
Fire Up? Still not worth taking.
---
This sub wants to play Killers who aren't Nurse or Billy, why the fuck is that "Entitled"? The Pig's whole deal is that she can A) Pressure survivors with her traps, and B) force survivors to stay in the match for longer. Now she does neither, as she has to be on the other side of the map in order for her traps to work and survivors can just walk out if she didn't trap them soon enough.
---
What other killer loses half of their power (**the better half**) when the gates open? A Pig having a bad game can literally end the game with all five traps left, and now even NoED doesn't help her power.
---
These changes are awful for Amanda and they shouldn't be pushed through.
---
Hey, look at it this way, at least you won't have to worry about playing against the pig anymore ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Yes, unless people are playing with their friends (On Xbox it's far far far more common, I assure you) and they aren't using good perks (Fingers crossed every single game is full of memers) then you will for sure win.
---
Otherwise it's going to take a ton of effort and misplay on their part.
---
They're both top tier perks imho so you'll be good with either.
---
I find I get more use out of Enduring and it works well alongside quite a few other perks so that's the one I would go for.
---
Why are you so salty? Lol it‚Äôs just an opinion damn who shit in your cereal?
---
Myers is fun too but a bit boring when you don't have sprint burst to avoid his 'click to EW3' cheese
---
Why are you running
---
Heresy
---
Slow-Ass Mutha-fucking Jeff*
---
... WHY ARE YOU RUNNING??
---
Yea it's much better to wait over a year for it to show up in the shrine.
---
The TR pausing traps is fine. I like it, opens up new techniques.
---
The endgame change can go suck a dick.
---
Endgame collapse pig could be cool. Before you preemptively call it opens, **let it be cool**. 
---
Maybe you'll end up delivering on the Jigsaw concept.
---
If you got a timer on your head after the last gen was done, as soon as you were unhooked you had a 2 min timer. Adding an extra min to that and then nerfing them seems way too extreme.
---
i get where youre coming from, but even that can be abused
---
Solo queuers make up 4% of the population of the game. Balancing the game around assuming everyone is solo is insane and DBD is the only game I can think of that does it.
---
Because it objectively does, especially on console. 2.6+ has been killer nerf after killer nerf. It's tiring.
---
You have literal wall hacks
---
youre a fucking spaz lmao
---
Yeah I'm glad the god awful pallet vacuums are gone since that was an absolute nightmare to deal with. Never should have even been a thing for so long if you ask me. The exhaustion nerf was also a much needed change although I personally think Vigil should let you recover exhaustion while running since otherwise its pretty much useless.
---
Survivors *can* finish gens in that time but generally speaking if you can find a survivor relatively quickly at the start of the match and then end the chase within a minute and hook them etc, you have 1 survivor immobilised and at least another 1 to go rescue them. If you then manage to find another then you've got at least 3 not working on gens. Not to mention a lot of survivors will spend time healing for a while which also gives you more time. If you play like this then you should be able to get things done relatively easily not taking into account SWF teams, good survivor loops and strong items. With BBQ it becomes much easier to find the next person and with Nurse's you can catch healing survivors off guard etc, not to mention the countless addons to make the game even better. 
---
At the end of the day, if you don't apply enough pressure then you can't expect survivors to not do gens. With the lack of a totem counter for solo teams to cooperate, they aren't likely to go around cleansing all the totems as a second objective or to even counter NOED. That counter would not only lessen the negativity around NOED but it would also give killers more time while the survivors actually bother to cleanse totems. The whole 'you're not pipping if you don't play inefficiently' thing BHVR is doing just angers the player base IMO.
---
(sorry for so much I accidentally went into far too much detail to do with how I play and not your comment lol)
---
It's a meme.
---
But how can they know? Or have to already played pig with egc without the nerfs?
---
The auras are the worst part on that map.
---
This was like watching Usain Bolt run the 100 meters in 9,67 seconds but shooting himself in the head just before he passes the finish line. Four traps. She has four traps man. I agree with everything you said, and I'm glad you said it. I'm sorry to nitpick, but she's all I play.
---
I'm just happy that we'll get rid of hatch standoffs
---
That‚Äôs true. My past self would love to see Enduring and Nurses in the Shrine but I just got them both like 1 month ago.
---
Perhaps, but the problem is that solo survivor is getting less and less viable so people don't *want* to play without their friends. It can be very frustrating to play against a strong SWF group but at the same time it can be very frustrating to have teammates that don't play as efficiently as you would like.
---
That's the thing, you don't even need the survivors to be good for SWF to be overpowered. Communication and coordination are extremely difficult to overcome as a non-Nurse killer. The time you save simply having only one person get off a gen to make a hook save alone makes swf strong. Ignoring the litany of other benefits.
---
Every other killer relies on survivors making mistakes to win. Nurse isn‚Äôt based on mistakes and is just on her own skill. Nurse does to survivors what swf does to killers.
---
A truck in autohaven might be safe, but you fail to mention that you can loop both sides of a pallet. So if she‚Äôs doing the technique on one end the survivor can begin to loop the other side. You have to loop no matter what. That‚Äôs why pig is more than slightly weak. 1 second is more than enough time for survivors to gain enough distance to make their next safe decision. You clearly aren‚Äôt good enough at survivor, any game vs the Pig will prove this point.
---
Well I‚Äôm a survivor main, and I do see how sometimes the game can be unfair, but you seem like you had something crawl up your ass and lay eggs lol I was like damn what‚Äôs up with this guy went to your posts and they all are of you bitching about something üòÇ
---
Thanks man gg
---
TL;DR  
---
Suggested Changes:
---
\-Have the Endgame Collapse trigger when the Exit Gates become powered, not when a gate opens.
---
\-Reduce the timer from 3 minutes to 2.5 minutes
---
\-The Exit Gates now take 30 seconds to open.  If there is only one survivor left in the trial, they open the exit gates at twice the speed.
---
\-Do not nerf Remember Me
---
\-When there is one survivor left in the trial, that Survivor becomes the Obsession
---
\-Do not nerf The Pig's endgame
---
\-RBTs will still turn off when in The Pig's terror radius
---
\-Scrap everything about Legion EXCEPT:
---
	\-The Legion's movement speed is 115%
---
	\-If the Legion misses an attack in Feral Frenzy, they immediatly cancel Feral Frenzy
---
r/MildlyInfuriating
---
Bloodypalley69 thank you for the 20 bits. You get clamheads and lickage: thank you and welcome to the toontie
---
But she got also buffed by EGC.
---
Their point is that they's have 2 systems for Feng, whereas Ash only had 1.
---
They're not going to waste time on that for 1 cosmetic.
---
You shut your whore mouth.
---
I was just about to get pig
---
Welp maybe I won't lol
---
looks quite similar ***doesn't*** it?
---
1. By your logic, every match should end with 2 Survivors escaping. So why even let the Killer defend the gens at all? How about balancing the game around Survivors rarely escaping, but having the game be satisfying and rewarding even if you die. 
---
2. There are perks to make this easier, plus these perks can always be changed.
---
3. It is possible to escape in my scenario, it's just difficult. But I guess Survivors hate things being even slightly challenging.
---
4. The hatch should exist, but be more balanced for both sides. If they kept the EGC, but removed the hatch buffs, it'd be fine.
---
*"dont hatch"*
---
Now time to make ~~Nea~~ The Entity
---
Well, excuse me for not staying 100% up to date with everything. I do have other things to do, you know.
---
yeah, **cough** ash leaked **cough**
---
I won't be seeing any legions lmao
---
The test wasn‚Äôt meant for the survivors. It was meant for you Amanda.
---
Could have last will.
---
so youre saying that the majority of the community should quit dbd because you want legion to stay broken? wow what a smartass, go kill yourself lol
---
&gt; What got reworked? 
---
"They need to rework powers and perks that play into the end game"
---
This will be a process - they aren't going to know exactly what is the best way forward until they actually start testing. They have barely reworked anything yet. They key is in the 'Big balance patch'.
---
&gt;get the fuck out of the game because they want to waste 10 minutes searching for the hatch or teabagging at the gate.
---
You just described perfectly the problem they are fixing - for all killers. That is a massive fucking problem in the game - if you can't see that beyond your slight current nerfs of the pig that come with it then that is your issue.
---
Remember me, fire up, the pig, all of the things that are end-game related are obviously getting reworked to git. Stop having a fucking bitch-fit because your fave killer is taking a hit in a massive patch that is intended to fix long time issues.
---
&gt;This sub wants to play Killers who aren't Nurse or Billy, why the fuck is that "Entitled"?
---
No I encourage balancing. It is entitled because it is mainly the 5% of top players demanding that they know how to make a game better than developers. And it is not just specific to DBD, you see it on every game subreddit. Just because you don't like something you create a massive fuss and bitch and whine and flood the sub with posts until you get your way - when you are only taking into account your biased opinion on how you like to play. By all means provide feedback, but what you see on reddit is entitled as fuck. It shows no appreciation for the developers who actually brought you the game.
---
The very small amount of end-game things this effects is what is needed for them to make a more functional game - that can't  be abused and dragged on for an unlimited amount of time.
---
Have faith in the team that they will eventually find a way to work the powers and perks back into the game when balancing. But it doesn't take a genius to see that these changes would not work with RBT's killing instantly. (which is what happens if the survivors don't leave anyway).
---
I get it - people react to nerfs. But jesus christ let them balance their game. The way people are acting here is so fucking childish. "Guys we have to keep making a fuss and bitching and flooding the front page with pig posts (a day after the announcement) so we get our way because we know best and we have access to all the information.
---
Give me a break. Downvote away - I know what I'm talking about - I've seen this happen with many games.
---
The topics (pig nerf, gate open buff, timer delay, timer initiating on gate open) synergize to create this problem. It is hard to peel apart the biggest problem when so many changes were made at once.
---
The optimist in me feels that the devs went overboard in order to eventually turn around and buff endgame to make it more relevant.
---
Legion still strong, and better then he was, you guys even played ptb?
---
No one is calling it a nerf. There's just no point in using it anymore.
---
if the pig camps the boxes while croutched
---
Why's this tagged as a shitpost it's awesome. /r/miniaturepainting might dig it too.
---
She don't need a nerf. She need a rework. It's impossible to balance her power without her either being top tier or shit
---
You‚Äôre totally right. This really did show that Legion hadn‚Äôt been really reviewed until now where they decided to dump all the ideas in one. I think that‚Äôs what also caused such an initial worry for me like if most of these changes were gradual over the other mid Chapter/plague patch, it would feel like we could retain some semblance of the characters feel instead of hoping it sticks around after however many changes push through. 
---
Also that last part wasn‚Äôt supposed to be directed to you personally, it‚Äôs more about the overall feel this sub has been vocally about in regards to legion as a whole. 
---
Idk I wish I could be on the PTB to do more/something but I‚Äôm just holding out that we can have something that accentuates Legion‚Äôs role without having to force it into their addons, especially seeing how much better the Cooldown ones are now.
---
#ExcitedOink
---
#prayforamanda indeed
---
No, they exist. Just not one for Oceania
---
Exactly, thank you. That is all it is - people jumping to conclusions. They don't seem to understand how game development works - but everyone is an expert apparently.
---
There was an analysis done by a player, across 500 traps less than 2% of players died and players had a 75% chance of removal after two unlock attempts.
---
These pig nerf posts is getting out of hand
---
Figures that the only killer I bought got nerfed to shit for late game. I knew I should have just bought Myers like a normal person lol.
---
LMAO i would laugh my ass off, i hate meg too but damn xD
---
You're also playing this casual game for fun, so if you don't enjoy playing against a certain Killer or addons, you shouldn't be forced to play. Same reason I DC on Haddonfield as Killer, the likelihood of that game actually being an enjoyable experience is next to zero.
---
With agitation it isn't terrible, but unless you're going a basement build I can't see any point in doing it.
---
Why keep the dumb turn off trap in terror radius
---
I agree that legion needed some nerfing but shit man. You're one hell of an aggressive one aint ya? "Personal attack" someone needs a break. Take care, friend.
---
&gt;By your logic, every match should end with 2 Survivors escaping. So why even let the Killer defend the gens at all? How about balancing the game around Survivors rarely escaping, but having the game be satisfying and rewarding even if you die.
---
On average, yeah. It is also the balancing target of the devs and every killer is above it anyways. I think the approach is the most "fair" way/solution to balance the game around. 
---
How about balancing the game around the killers rarely killing but having the game be satisfying and rewarding even if you don't kill anyone.
---
See how stupid this line of thinking is? I bet you would be for your suggestion but against it if it were flipped on its head. Rightfully so though, because it is a dumb way to go about it. Both sides should have a decent chance of escaping/killing. They are the objectives of the game and achieving them is fun.
---
&gt;It is possible to escape in my scenario, it's just difficult. But I guess Survivors hate things being even slightly challenging.
---
Says the guy who is scared that it will be too difficult to catch the last survivor? I guess "Killers" hate not being handed the last kill for free? See how stupid these kinds of arguments are?
---
In your suggestion it would only be possible if the survivor beelines to every generator, immediately knowing where to find it, is never interrupted by the killer or perks like Ruin. I guess then he has a chance to complete all generators and even then he still has to go for a door or find the hatch without the killer doing anything.
---
&gt;The hatch should exist, but be more balanced for both sides. If they kept the EGC, but removed the hatch buffs, it'd be fine.
---
The hatch should exist but survivors shouldn't be able to get it in over 90% of the cases is your preferred suggestion though. Or how often on average should a survivor be able to get the hatch on average? What would be fair in your eyes?
---
&gt;This is the problem with Survivor mains: they don't think they should ever die. They want Killers to be dumb-as-shit AI that poses no threat. They want to individually be as powerful as the Killer. What needs to happen is all Survivors need to be as powerful as SWF groups.
---
Lmao, I am not a Survivor main at all. I play and enjoy both sides. I hate the Pig nerfs, I hate that exit gates will be opened faster, I hate the nerfs to Remember me and I even hate SWF tbh and wish it wouldn't be in the game. I know they wont be removed because a huge draw to the game is playing with your friends but still. I wish killers would at least receive buffs and more bloodpoints when going against them.
---
Someone is not automatically a survivor main just because he/she is against a super biased hatch suggestion. You could propose your changes to the most biased killer mains and they would be against it.
---
NOOOOO
---
They nerfed pig because her end game would have just been two timers instead of 1. If you‚Äôre trapped end game you would have been forced to run around the map in under 3 minutes and get back. A well known pig main even said it‚Äôs not that big of a deal considering that her main power is the dash and stealth. Stop complaining.
---
Agreed, it should be -10%
---
Survivors already bully killers. This would never work, and they will never add it.
---
It‚Äôs how they want the game to be.
---
Fuck paying for a killer I‚Äôll never pay and leveling that fucker up lmao. Rather just not have BBQ
---
wouldnt be a game without a boosted meg tbagging in the gates
---
maybe survivors arent happy with the game, thats just a therory
---
Bop BOP
---
Part of it is salty ass survivor mains copying toxic streamers who do the same thing. Part of it is also the sorry ass state of the game, and it's just as likely the piece of shit game kicked the player out randomly. Honestly I can't tell anymore.
---
yeah  you dont even need a fuck ton of skill tbh, you need a tad bit of game sense honestly. i never ever play nurse, did like 2 games prior to yesterday a very long time ago, to prove a point on an argument with a friend, got into a game (rank 5 killer atm) , got a fast 4k .... on rotten fields....  nurse is broken af, there is absolutely no counter to her. and also 95% of red rank games are vs nurses. that info alone should be enough to tell something is very very unbalanced with her,  imo its the killer that needs the most, a huge rework/nerf. my suggestion is, take away her lounge attack ability (which is VERY VERY broken on the hitboxes, seems like every game you get slapped 10 feet away), just make it so that she only has the short one, kinda like tier 1 myers.  she need to blink precise, not like how it is rn whereas you blink kinda there and it 'auto aims' you to the survivor nearby. also completely delete the stacking of her + x blinks add ons.
---
&gt; *Suddenly thinks pig moonwalking is a thing*
---
It IS a thing though, it's not as common as Legion moonwalking because it will only force a survivor to die slowly as opposed to moonwalking for "faster" downs on survivors.
---
Legion is better now
---
well who the fuck are you to act as a joke police? lmao, youre clearly just "sAltY"
---
Haha i was just tryna make a joke dude
---
I think this is how you make it harder for them to get the rights to other characters.
---
The entity forgot Amanda wasn‚Äôt a survivor and accidentally turned her into one
---
Why are you saying that she can‚Äôt slow the game down anymore? Her traps aren‚Äôt useless and still work when all the gens are powered, provided you put them on survivors before the gens were finished. 
---
Like, I feel they should have buffed her somewhere else to compensate, but people are acting like her traps don‚Äôt do anything anymore and that‚Äôs simply not the case. They still slow the game down.
---
I still don't understand how her patch is a Nerf tho
---
No changes to Nurse but some people want them
---
Well too bad, all licensed characters(except michael) are becoming useless, and since devs cant balance them they dont deserve more licenses
---
With the nerfs on the way how about we take away her traps, make her ability increase her terror radius, and also disable her ability to use perks
---
DONT do this, incredibly stupid idea, on point with what ochido did to the devs when he was banned, and if this is a joke dont put suggestion as the flair
---
I want one!
---
This isn't survivor Vs killer so don't even try it.  This is about IN GAME DCs. By the looks of the end of you paragraph it seems more like people don't want to get better at the game or learn how to counter certain aspects of the game so they just quit.
---
im on the dogs side, lmao
---
What did ochido do?
---
It's just funny how killers get nerfed again in like 1million years and they complain, not knowing that survivors have to go through that everyday. With that said, get over it really! Pieces of trash! Oh and btw enjoy your new pig
---
made his fanbase spam the devs that he shouldnt be banned
---
Please tell me how this is a stupid idea
---
Devs dont care about the community, our only hope is if the license owners put pressure on thr devs soo they can fix their act
---
1. Killers rarely killing doesn't fit the theme and isn't why ANYONE is here. People want Killers to be intimidating and hard to escape.
---
2. I don't want to be handed the last kill. I don't mind not getting 4Ks, but I want to lose the last Survivor because *I* fucked up, not because the game is designed in such a way as to hand an escape to Survivors. If it were otherwise, I'd be asking for a 5-10 second hatch escape time.
---
4. In 3 seconds, the average Killer can move just 13.8m, less than HALF their own terror radius. As such, if the Killer isn't near the hatch, the escape is easy. But then the Killer screwed up.
---
I think that's the real purpose of the game, gettin some twerk at the gate ü§î
---
Well sadly the dc ratio have increased sadly, not sure if the comunity has become more toxic or the state of the game is what causes this
---
are you for fucking real? wow i know there are some stupid people but damn
---
Yeah can you imagine trying to escape end game while dealing with an RBT? You‚Äôd have no chance unless you got really lucky
---
They usually do not make changes that make everyone disappointed pass PTB. 
---
Remember Self Care change in 2.5.0? I do neither, because they did not implement it.
---
And you are unable to e plain why its a stupid idea
---
Tell me more
---
What did he do to get banned in the first place? I hear only bad things about this ochido guy so im surprised he even has a fanbase
---
I mean someone's gotta give you constructive criticism if you ever wish to improve the sad excuses you call jokes! Relying on outdated toxic comments and trying to use a meme in the unfunniest of ways. Must get annoying to put so much effort on capsing every other letter. I just thought I'd do ya the solid. A "thank you" would be nice to have. But I don't think your ego will allow you to say it. I'll just say you're welcome anyways. You're welcome!
---
Why are half your ‚Äúe‚Äôs‚Äù are ‚Äúr‚Äôs‚Äù and it really bothers me.
---
Yeah but wouldn't the terror radius trap patch be in you're favor? When it goes off, and you don't see it ticking anymore, you would know that they're in you're terror radius right?
---
I‚Äôm sorry man but apparenly in this subbrdddit you get downvoted for having an opinion that isn‚Äôt in line with the majority.
---
We got Leatherface and Freddy basically back to back, so it isn't exactly impossible.
---
Killer mains: "We can't 4k and win 100% of games by being an idiot, this is broken waaaaaah"
---
Yes because the wraith, Myers, plague, and pig, have a completely useless ability that has no point now, yes because Myers loses some stalk when he‚Äôs stunned, wraith uncloaks when he‚Äôs stunned, because their power was completely nerfed. Should I go on?
---
STILL strong? He has never been strong, he was just cancerous and unfun to vs. Now he's not as annoying but still as useless.
---
I said all Survivors should be as powerful as SWF groups. How does that come off as me wanting easy kills.
---
As long as perks like MoM, Sprint Burst and Urban Evasion are in the game, kills will never be easy.
---
And that's fine.
---
I'd be fine with a Whispers rework, tbh. Most of the time, it's fairly useless. "Hey, a Survivor is within 32m of you". That's only really helpful in a 1v1, when it is too powerful.
---
I think I am overreacting. But after playing against the stupid-as-fuck hatch for 18 months, I was hoping the endgame rework would be a tad more impactful than this.
---
At the moment, I don't even try to fight the hatch because I know I can't win. Despite the Killer supposedly being the power role.
---
Skill based doesn't mean it should be so much above others when played right.
---
Grow the fuck up, try being a Jason fan you insipid child.
---
Maybe not only serious, but in majority. I'm tired of seeing 1000 memes about the same thing (for example Legion rework), and there are also suggestions and ideas that really make sense
---
Fook
---
I'll watch a video of his and we'll see...
---
But for your information, the other Youtubers (that I watch) WERE toxic, but they realised what they were encouraging and stopped, it took OchiDO to be banned for him to change, and he might've only changed because he felt like he HAD to... but I may be wrong about OchiDO, he might've changed...
---
If you open the steam store, scroll down for about 5 pages and look for the banner in plain text obviously mandated to be there, but as hidden as they can make it you'll find: https://store.steampowered.com/consumer_rights_notice/
---
Basically, Valve and Steam aren't allowed to make up their own refund policy that violates Australian law and still sell to Australians.
---
&gt;When you buy video games from Valve Corporation as a consumer located in Australia, the video games come with guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law that cannot be excluded, including a guarantee that the video games are of acceptable quality. You are entitled to a replacement or refund from the retail supplier of the video games for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage.
---
I'm not a lawyer or anything, but they've done pretty substantial matchmaking tests recently that have shown us that the game is NOT reasonable to play when we're matched with hosts from Japan, Brazil, etc. In a game of split second timing, delaying our games by half a second is essentially taking the game away from us, the only way we can continue to play is in a significantly compromised state that ruins all the enjoyment, and takes away our ability to perform skillfully as players. It's not an overstatement to say that I, and many other players, will be forced out by this change if no Australian/Oceanic servers are added.
---
So releasing dedicated servers that actively exclude us as players almost CERTAINLY constitutes forseeable loss/damage that would be grounds for getting out money back. This is not the game we bought and we don't have to have $80+ of base game and DLC sitting in an unplayable state in our steam library, they can have our money back when they fix their shit.
---
I had a dream Jason was added to DBD, and his power was kicking window vaults into doorways. It was glorious, and I was sad to wake up.
---
More like lmao, stop being dumb. Legion was weak, there wasnt even a discussion about it, any good player wheter killer or survivor main aknowledged as much. What was said was ranging from "he is bad for the game" over "he is unfun to play with/against" "his (addons, or rather, one of it, Franks mixtape) are busted" but what you didnt hear from anyone worth their salt was that he was op. On the contrary, if anything. And of course there are the double blades, but im not even noting them among op addons, cause they were simply broken, a bug to be abused by glitchers. 
---
Only idiots added "lmao Legion op" to the list.
---
You‚Äôre legitimately one of the worst aspects of this fandom, I genuinely hope you never play the game or visit the forums again.
---
Also...hatch standoffs weren't that bad too so just end yourselves if you arent ok with these changes. I deeply think that the endgame will make it easier for the killers and yet again...they complain. Its honestly very sad. You guys are pathetic. _I'll laugh my ass off with a reverse bear trap on my head passing through the exit gates_
---
Rank 20s*
---
Because Legion was fine before and didn‚Äôt need changed right?
---
In my experience yes
---
I wish gun would have kept with f13 instead of lying and running.
---
I want to use this time again to remind everyone that due to password breaches  existing and probably affecting sites you wouldn't expect, it's a good  idea to protect the accounts you care about (Steam, Reddit, XVideos  etc.) with Two Factor Authentication. Adding two factor will increase the security of  your accounts heaps and will help protect you from people who disagree with your opinions on Dead By Daylight balance. [https://haveibeenpwned.com/](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) is an excellent resource to find out if your emails and/or passwords have breached already, in case you are curious. 
---
I don't think I'll shut up about using 2-fac on memes I post anytime soon, considering a meme I made about NOED ended up with someone so upset they hacked my Reddit account, it's important to remind people to keep safe.
---
That said, End Game Collapse good, Pig changes not good but kinda needed to prevent certain griefing methods during the endgame, a small buff would be nice to compensate for this, Legion changes bad but at least he's not completely unfun for people that were trying to get into the game and had to face him constantly
---
It‚Äôs the extra chromosome
---
&gt; Blendette
---
A Blinkybill-tier or another Marth-tier Nurse is super rare, though.  Most Nurses aren't THAT good unless someone gets caught out in the open with no cover.
---
Legion changes are ok. They just need to buff him later
---
Why keep stupid TR change on pig?
---
Keeping RBT‚Äôs killing at exit gates requires them to slow the timer.
---
And I don‚Äôt think egc needs that big of a buff
---
&gt; Killers rarely killing doesn't fit the theme and isn't why ANYONE is here. People want Killers to be intimidating and hard to escape.
---
Most people are here because they like the thrill of escaping/killing. Having either of them occur to rarely is a bad idea.
---
&gt;I don't want to be handed the last kill. I don't mind not getting 4Ks, but I want to lose the last Survivor because I fucked up, not because the game is designed in such a way as to hand an escape to Survivors. If it were otherwise, I'd be asking for a 5-10 second hatch escape time.
---
I don't see how it hands survivors a free escape. Depending on the killer and gate positioning it can be incredibely difficult to open the gates (I hope they don't go through with the exit gate time nerf). Billy/Nurse by default because of their mobility. Trapper if he traps the gates in time. Plague can puke on them to see if it gets touched or not, any killer with bitter murmur etc. etc. It is not simply a free escape and I didn't get that impression on the PTB at all. There is some element of chance attached to it and even it it were a 50/50 (which it is not, depending on the killer) for the killer then it would also obviously be a 50/50 for the survivor. So again, not a free escape.
---
&gt;In 3 seconds, the average Killer can move just 13.8m, less than HALF their own terror radius. As such, if the Killer isn't near the hatch, the escape is easy. But then the Killer screwed up.
---
The 3 second animation idea is not a bad idea on its own (it just is dumb with your proposed wallhack after 3 minutes) I just think the changes on the PTB are more interactive and more fun than this.
---
A very known issue with no solution, sometimes you‚Äôre lucky and won‚Äôt have a crash for your entire play session and sometimes the game will be unplayable
---
Constantly repaired purple toolbox
---
No, no, no.  You don't understand.  BHVR is making those killers FUN(tm).  For the survivors.  Not for us.
---
Because it's a buff.
---
Pig can turn off her Terror radius by crouching, and she can see if a trap is active or not.
---
Therefore, if you play Pig and notice an active trap suddenly disable, it tells you a survivor just entered your terror radius
---
**It gives Pig "Whispers" on survivors with active traps**
---
That last one is so spot on. In the PTB feedback section of the forum, any thread being mostly critical - devs: .......  Thread sucking dick, "oh wow, such a good job, the only thing, maybe increase the endgame collapse timer from 3 to 4 min? devs. Thank you for the feedback! This is the type of feedback we are looking for!
---
It's the simple fact that this entire thing doesn't "benefit" killera at all. It's just a reason to buff survivors. The 3 min timer is too long for any killer to actually make use of and the timer and literally extends to 6 minutes by downing survivors. Most survivors would have long since left in that time and even if you do cath someone, the others can just leave if the timer gets to low, they have 6 minutes. For this
---
- pig was taken away one of her most prominent ways to use her power
---
- exit gates open faster
---
- bt got a buff again
---
- hatch spawns always and even if the killer finds it, the survivor is yet "again" given a chance to escape. Just camp one of the gates
---
- cannot hatch grab anymore
---
- legion is alt f4d instead of just reworked to not abuse his power anymore.
---
Pig is like the girl texting in the Slap 2
---
The only nurse change is that her blink hits don't ignore mettle of men.
---
Reporting people who DC? It‚Äôs not banable... because if someone has a good excuse to DC (has to go or idk) it would be stupid if they banned that person
---
She needs all the help she can get
---
Only works once per item, so it would be balanced.
---
It‚Äôs so realistic!
---
Get better at the game, most teams won't pose too much trouble against a killer that knows how to play.
---
Do you really have to? It's kinda rude.
---
I gotchu
---
Sure, you'd know they were in a ~30m(?) radius of you but considering most of the time Pig saves RBTs for endgame you're going to know roughly where they are/ where they're going so it's a moot point. Besides, there's a plethora of vision based perks which are more specific.
---
If the timer on the RBT isn't going down while inside terror radius and won't trigger when leaving the exit gates, they're effectively useless. Before they were a pressure tool to force survivors to try and get it off before they escaped. Can't really do that now.
---
No Hong Kong or Taiwan Servers?? What a fxxking joke!!!
---
If its so specific than this nerf doesnt effect anything, so why is everyone complaining so much?
---
&gt; Why keep stupid TR change on pig? 
---
Because it's a buff.  I explained why in another reply
---
I always thought this meme was a reference to Halo: Reach for some reason...
---
The sound is fucked anyway for all killers.  It's been like this for a long, long time (ever since the first time they updated the Unity engine).
---
Yeah and oh btw have you noticed that 9 out of 10 posts on the ‚Äùhot‚Äù list are rants about pig? Well cause i have, and it‚Äôs making me want the old days back man, with only 3 killers and people who actually enjoyed the game
---
Behavior is the Entity confirmed
---
Noone said it was meant to be a killer buff. It's just way to ensure that the game actually ends and that survivors aren't hiding in corners for 10 minutes, as well as removing hatch standoffs.
---
Pig nerf is harsh, yes, but all it means is that you have to place traps when there are 2-1 gens left instead of waiting for end game. I think people are forgetting that ACTIVE traps still can't leave
---
Have you played the PTB? They're not
---
WOW. Wtf.
---
You get the keys, the quiche
---
It‚Äôs a thematic way to make games arbitrarily shorter so there‚Äôs less load on the dedicated servers.
---
For a split second I wondered why she was holding a jiggy from Banjo and Kazooie.
---
Unless I'm missing something the point is they can escape with the trap on now. The timer won't start when crossing the exit gate whereas before it would be an insta-kill. 
---
Like I said, while you make a valid point with the ability to track survivors based on the status of the timer, it certainly isn't as useful as perks like Discordance and Surveillance. Plus at "higher" levels of play stealth isn't as impactful as confidence in your ability to loop. Even if you have a RBT on all but one person and the timer hasn't started, if the last person can keep you in a chase with them for long enough the others will be able to escape without having to take the trap off. Making it harder to trigger the timer is undeniably a nerf to Pig, the exit gate thing is even harsher.
---
Lmao fuck off outa here.
---
Legion is obvious why he was nerfed.
---
The pig is obvious why she is nerfed - it is a result of introducing EGC - which is generally a killer buff. But end game perks and plays have to be affected. They will sort it out - but the sooner you all stop bitching the better.
---
Why is there so much reliance on frenzy to down someone? To me frenzy is to stall the game and mobility. The four months of Frank's being "the" add-on has made it a crutch.
---
She hasn't been?
---
Pretty sure that's exactly what skill means
---
That‚Äôs the thing though, Legion was designed TO START the chase using his power. If he can‚Äôt even do that why would anyone play them except for the cosmetics. And plague is almost always using her power in a chase if the survivor isn‚Äôt injured, so wdym. I can kind of understand wraith. But Michael? Dude he literally stalks while chasing to get an instant down on the next chase. And Freddy is Freddy.
---
Point is, why make a power and then reduce it to make it so it has so little use you‚Äôd never use it. No other killer is in that situation except MAYBE freddy, because of the dream world transition time, but you HAVE to use that to chase people, so that just leaves legion.
---
Which one?
---
Legion won't ever be fine
---
&gt;Nightmare: no skillchecks in dreamworld
---
Actually that sounds like a well needed buff for freddy
---
I really don't think they ban people for that because there is 0 proof she rage quited. (Yes I know she did rage quit but "It can be a coincidence")
---
I know. We were testing it at full strength last night using the perk along with an Engineer's, Sockets, and a Rag. It was done in just under 20 seconds.
---
1. Most people's favourite part of the game is actually chasing. Plus escapes aren't nearly as satisfying if they occur 50% of the time. That they are unlikely is what makes the Killer scary. Example; would Alien have been as effective if Ripley, Lambert and Parker all got away?
---
2. My major problem lies simply with the unneed door and hatch buffs. Honestly, remove them and I would be happy.
---
3. If you look at ny original post, you'll note I said "3/5 minutes". I agree that 3 minutes isn't long enough, but 5 minutes should be the sweet spot.
---
Is this hey removed again they truly hate the pig.
---
Hes pretty much just an M1 killer, I don't see you need to go into frenzy now, just wastes time tbh. Before PTB, if I was against a legion it was a feeling of oh great, lets get tunnelled by a low skilled nurse with no really counter sept hoping the guy getting chased can waste some time while the others gen rush, but if he has franks mixed tap, then its gg, leave game ;-)
---
Now when I see legion - oh its a legion, easy game, can chill lol
---
Aaaaand they bump right into the killer with their sonic speed.
---
In this ultra-casual game, I couldn't give less shit about a challenge. I don't care to prove my skill to anyone. I care about enjoying myself.
---
Good luck getting 4k's with the new legion
---
Isn't they're path blocked? For the RBT users I mean
---
Uh.. he was never OP, he just had exploits because the game is broken.
---
&gt;Traps don't trigger when going through the exit gate and the timer pauses when they're in terror radius, not just chases.
---
One correction. If a trap is active then it will still kill when going through the exit gate. It just wont be activated after all gens are powered. So all traps must be used before the last gen pops or they are wasted.
---
If the playerbase was larger, then yeah, it'd be a nice idea. But then you have to take in ranking considerations, geo location (which is already a nightmare, as people are split between a lot of different countries so the playerbase in your region is much smaller than it may be)
---
You also have to take the fact that most people don't want an added challenge. Most people would take off SWF queues.
---
Also, you can already add players in the same lobby and VC with them. I've had it happen to me a couple of times already - it'll just be more usable this time since SWF is no longer as 'popular'.
---
It's a good idea, just won't work.
---
Spirit has no stun after using her power, she doesn‚Äôt get her power sapped when someone drops a pallet on her because you can‚Äôt. You don‚Äôt HAVE to attack anyone while phasing, and phasing is much faster and more reliable than the fluffy flurry that legion has now.
---
She can be stunned out of spirit walk but it seems fair to me.
---
Tracking is only good if you know how to use it
---
It's a straight nerf, especially on smaller maps. If the Pig hunts for you while you're trapped, she's not stopping other survivors, and as long as you remain in her terror radius, you don't need to try and remove the trap at all, you can just hide in obscure spots.
---
Also, if you use it like you describe, then that leads to tunneling trapped people, which is just lame. 
---
Also, also, and this is just a personal thing, but I already run Whispers on most of my killers, Amanda included, so it would be redundant. The perk feels almost mandatory at rank 1.
---
If anything, it encourages tunneling, using it like you describe. And looking at BHVR's recent decisions, it will probably lead to them hiding the progress of the trap, like they did with deep wounds, which would be yet another pointless nerf.
---
That's definitely true.
---
That being said, an argument that's definitely mostly perpetuated by killer mains is that "the game should be balanced towards the highest level of play", usually in reference to removing power from really good SWF teams. If they did balance like that, nurse would certainly have to be nerfed, as at the highest level of play she is unstoppable.
---
It should be punished but not as harshly as it is. I think a miss should drain like a 4th of the power bar.
---
Any offensive action will take a token away
---
Im not a game developer but i have a bsic understanding of how 3D modeling in video game works. First off all, no they dont have to create different animstion since the hoodie is linked to specific body parts in her rig. Her flopping ears are also pretty simple since you can make her react like normal hair to the programmed gravity and drag (yes the future is here, i know). Also putting a line of red text into the items description isn't that hard.
---
And what do do you mean by not worth their resources? It's literally an cosmetic item that just like Davids topless torso is wanted for months and people would buy the shit out of it.
---
Yeah, I guess it does make sense
---
"This one time a Pig player was mean to me so take away Pig's power entirely!!!"
---
They will not bleed while mending or in your terror radius, so you have a case of potato survivors my friend.
---
Why would I care about the trapped survivor?
---
I want their time wasted while I chase other people.
---
I hate how your not even wrong
---
I know that... I said it in the post but I was asking if it was always like that.
---
His gf is sexy asf though anyone else seen her? He must make bank
---
I could accept that.
---
"can i atleast finish 1 more gen before i die?"
---
Killer: no.
---
That's a far too aggressive appearance for the new survivor, Amanda. She needs a sign to say "safe escort to the exit this way."
---
#PrayForAmanda
---
\#PrayForAmanda
---
Because it‚Äôs the exact same thing. Just on the survivor side it screws over your teammates. Killer gets to decide the match their playing. Survivors don‚Äôt. It‚Äôs that simple. Again, not condoning DC just saying it‚Äôs the same thing as far as picking your trials
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter now. It should be scrapped. It is the definition of useless now. 
---
Also people liked frenzy downs because it almost guaranteed a down, but even then it was annoying at best. Now frenzy and franks is useless. Neat
---
&gt; The pig is obvious why she is nerfed - it is a result of introducing EGC - *which is generally a killer buff.*
---
What.
---
If they nerf Myers considerably I am going to weep
---
Exactly
---
Honestly, you're better off with something that puts more pressure on the survivors. Enduring, for example, is a great choice, as it helps her deal with loops. Killers that don't respect pallets are killers who win chases faster.
---
Well. I‚Äôm more scared if the one on the right
---
People currently don't want to play against SWF's because most killers aren't equipped to deal with them. If the queues were seperate then killers could be buffed in SWF and it would become more appealing. Nontheless you are probably right that the playerbase isn't large enough to support this. 
---
However I don't think adding chat is the solution either. Many players don't want to VC, and console players cannot use keyboard. Besides that, changing the game into one of perfect information removes a lot of the suspense that makes the game good. For example, you're doing a generator and suddenly you hear the terror radius. Do you run or continue working? Your preference may change dependent on circumstances, but if you know that your teammate is being chased then not only do you know you're probably safe, but you can alert your teammate to keep away. SWF is a different game, one that I am not interested in playing, and if chat were added in regular games, I would regrettably stop playing DbD. Just in case this is relevant to my opinion, I am a solo survivor main but I sometimes play killer into the green ranks.
---
I will OINK like I never OINKED before. FORAMANDA!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
They did nerf legion too you twat
---
In fact, they announced the pig nerf later
---
Well the new mixtape discourages people from playing legion the braindead m2, vault pallet, hit survivor till they die way and I can appreciate that. My question is why did they keep that mechanic in the first place? Franks mixtape shouldve been scrapped and reworked
---
\*Saw theme starts playing\*
---
Isn't it great? I love it.
---
Yes! More downvotes!
---
Myers
---
Have you read the EGC notes? It is designed to stop trapdoor standoffs and to stop killers getting fucked around with in the end game. The pig is literally the only killer who has taken a hit, because its current playstyle relies on the late game.
---
Are you telling me you really can't see why they are introducing the changes? You think they are just randomly nerfing the pig? It is obvious what they are trying to do - but pig players are just up in arms because in its current form it affects one killer (and like 2 perks). Quick spam the front page with bitching! That'll teach those evil developers!
---
Legion's being changed. You can untwist your pussy about them now.
---
I'm tired of writing a custom answer to every single fucking NOED thread, so just take this.
---
&gt;NOED has counters.
---
&gt;&gt;I shouldn't have to run perks(Small Game, Detective's Hunch) just to counter my opponent's, if he doesn't have NOED than it's just a waste.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;Yes you should, that's how balance works and you can't always prepare for every single loadout and circumstance.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;But it takes too much time to cleanse totems that could otherwise be spent rushing my opponent out of the match.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Right, that's the entire point. It's supposed to slow matches down on average without having to keep increasing generator repair times, which nobody likes. Killers who don't even run NOED still benefit from the fact that there's others that do. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Only bad killer use NOED, it's a crutch.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;You can say that about anything. You know what? Good survivors don't wipe to NOED. The perk is going to activate the same way every single time, whether the killer was trash or whether they're MLG, if you didn't cleanse totems than it's going to proc. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Why should I be punished for doing the objective...?
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Doing gens isn't your objective, escaping alive is. Repairing them are just a means to that end. So if you died, you didn't actually complete anything. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I just think the perk is too powerful, it's frustrating to make it all the way to the end of the match just to get one-shotted at the finish line.
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The killer was playing with a handicap for 95% of the match, only using three perks. You might not have even lived until NOED's activation if the killer had taken a perk that would have been relevant for the whole match. 
---
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Look I just think it's an unfun perk.
---
I think that about sums up every post that could be made in this thread, am I leaving any out?
---
Hahahaha Hahahaha haha ü§£ ü§£
---
Didn't wanna make people mad
---
I think end-game collapse unfortunately forces a hand where you probably have to nerf the traps in some way or else Pig becomes too oppressive. I don't know if being able to leave with a trap on your head if its inactive is the way to do it, but being put on two seperate timers before you get killed is too much at once, plus I think it adds too much pressure to the survivors and kind of removes some fun from them.
---
I'd rather have something like maybe all or more than one Jigsaw machine works if you try to get out once all generators are completed or something like that. That way there's still the pressure of trying to get it off before escaping, but you aren't hard punished for trying to not die one way but potentially sacrificing yourself to die another way. Just a spitball idea though.
---
Your opinion is survivor sided only, void opinion.
---
And then the biggest killer nerf in the past 3 months get's released. Sure kid.
---
You are clearly missing the point. Legion is aids to verse because he can use the m2, vault pallet, hit surv till they die method and the survivor can do literally nothing to prevent it from happening. Yes your solution would fix the moonwalking legion but that isnt the only thing that makes legion stupid
---
 Myers is always the killer to remind me that I havent been checking my surroundings enough.
---
Myers is probably your best bet. Or spirit but she takes practice. I main huntress and I also think this fits your wants
---
you seem to be misinformed, its not that the traps dont Go off in a chase, the Timer stops in the Terror Radius and Traps have absolutely no use after the gens are done, which makes them pretty useless
---
LMAO I AM DYING HE SAID THE LINE
---
Wow. How about no? Just - fuck no. 
---
It's too early for this level of stupid.
---
i think he is solid mid tier with the right perk builds
---
But Spirit and Huntress are both High Tier
---
So should every killer have their Power down a survivor? Maybe even instadown like Billy/Bubba?
---
Frenzy was, imo, meant to get survivors off gens. Chase and annoy so the game slows down, just a little bit.
---
I was the killer both times
---
Fair point
---
you don't see people who are in deep wounds but you see anyone who isn't in deep wounds
---
They massacred my girl!!
---
I mean I never said easy, I said simple. There is a difference. Also the game in general is simple in concept. What isn't are the mind games and use of perks that one must use to achieve their goal. My main point was that "tunneling" is a dumb ass complaint because of course a killer is going to try and get you. What do you want them to do, smack and say peace out? It's like calling a killer sweaty, of course they are it's a 4v1.
---
&gt; Her flopping ears are also pretty simple since you can make her react to the programmed gravity and drag (yes the future is here, i know)
---
Hey, no need to be sassy.
---
&gt; Also putting a line of red text into the items description isn't that hard.
---
It's not really about putting a text in the UI. It's about having an established system for something then suddenly adding exceptions for it. It just creates confusion. I've also experienced countless times that people don't read texts. Even when red or when that's the only text on the screen. So a group of players will be confused and of course you can say "Well, the text was there, not my fault" but that's not a good thing to do as developer. They should keep things as clear as possibly is one way to do it is not flooding simple and established systems with exceptions.
---
&gt; And what do do you mean by not worth their resources? It's literally an cosmetic item ...
---
This whole topic is about the fact that this hoodie is different than any other cosmetic item. It needs extra time compared to other cool cosmetics which can be as successful as the hoodie would be.
---
Pretty sure it's never happened, don't worry.
---
Plus if the anti cheat detects the custom icons (it won't) you'll just have to verify game files, your game just won't start. It won't ban you.
---
They really shouldn't Nerf the baretraps like that. They should just stay the way they are it'll make the endgame even more interesting
---
Yeah, a coordinated team will just wait for teammates to free themselves before completing any gens.
---
They are higher tier yes but in no way are they OP
---
Legion is far from better now he doesn't bring anything to the game now lol
---
Ok but again in that system you can still trick it to go against newer/not as good players.
---
By killing trash survivors who think that part of "getting better" includes bitching about perks on Reddit.
---
I actually agree. People saying that no voice chat is good for immersion are right but because you can use 3rd party software to add voice chat, balancing becomes an impossible task.
---
Your not seeing half of the changes of this though. They nerf killers 500 times, and have useless addons: they‚Äôll produce more useless addons and put no effort into making powers and addons even usable. And this is the reason you only see nurses, Billys, and Spirits.
---
They‚Äôre power wasn‚Äôt good enough before to use it as BHVR intended, so people abused exploits and broken addons to make him rediculous. now they‚Äôre power is not just INEFFECTIVE but also damn near USELESS. Extremely low effort to ‚Äúbalance‚Äù the legion.
---
Just look at Amanda. Her traps would‚Äôve been OP in EGC, so instead of changing mechanics, more nerfs...
---
Have you played legion, do you play killer AND survivor? I‚Äôm not being mean, just asking. Because playing against him is going to be a joke, but playing him is no longer fun, even with addons, it‚Äôs just a boring ‚ÄúM1 killer, just what we wanted, right?‚Äù
---
This game is somehow getting worse every update. It bums me out. I really love this game but it‚Äôs quickly becoming unplayable and/or unfun. 
---
It‚Äôs like BHVR is begging killer mains to uninstall lmao
---
LMAO I had to laugh hard
---
No you obviously can't see the bigger picture. Basically players can exploit the whole game in any form to make the game last an unlimited amount of time. Similarly the player and the killer can have a stand off for an unlimited amount of time until one 'gives in'.
---
They are probably the biggest issues for the game, obviously. They are massive holes / exploits in the way the game functions at base. Balancing and tweaks come after that. I'm not exactly thrilled with how much they are changing things - but it is obvious why, so i welcome the devs solution to these problems.
---
&gt;I think that's exactly why there's so much negative feedback. BHVR is trying to fix non-issues that arise from irrational players not getting over their egos and whining about it on social media. The changes seem forced, and they're having unintended negative consequences.
---
No there isn't negative feedback, there is people bitching and trying to intimidate the devs, by flooding the front page with pig posts. This clearly isn't about the pig - but the pig has been affected due to her end-game playstyle.
---
You are the issue thinking the devs are just idiots playing off of reddit opinion. That is not how they run the game. Have some respect. They have obviously spent a lot of time planning this for the benefit of the whole community - not just the people who shout loudest on reddit who probably make up about 5% of the playerbase. People haven't even had a chance to try it out yet..
---
The bigger issue is, that this is heavily removing a lot of the tension you had during an entire game with a helmet off, a survivor if they really want to can crouch around a killers terror radius/outside their vision range and keep themselves from having the timer continue. Yes this would be pretty dumb to do and waste time, but effectively a survivor CAN do this to prevent themselves from risking a head pop.
---
Meanwhile, as a huge fan of the SAW franchise, I never once saw a person just leave the room with an inactive RBT on their head, it's like taking the fear and meaning out of the object that was meant to be scary in the first place.
---
The fact that they gave the RBT a mechanic to literally kill the survivor, is what makes it unique most of all, and they're removing that uniqueness because I promise you, even now I struggle as someone with at least 600 hours in Pig to get a good Head pop, it will basically not exist after this update.
---
Those are my complaints, and I'm hopeful the devs will change this and make things better cause I've literally spent so much time into this killer that I feel like I'm better off just swapping to someone else after these years of just playing Pig.
---
Tr?
---
Works for both side
---
depends on the Definition tbh, Spirits Mindgame Potential is pretty OP and Huntress Ranged Hits are really good
---
Yeah but nobody can hop on first try and do well with them. They take practice and mastery.
---
I meant the timer
---
Most people want to break them but OP is making more like wtf
---
I mean they got a lot of negative feedback on Legion, but then still brought him into the game as he was
---
Exactly, this is what I feel about this update, it's silly and makes the RBT's head pop practically non-existant, I've been playing Pig for years and I can already tell I'll basically never get a Head pop, and definitely won't ever see one again unless I make it my main focus..and then I lose the game because I'm trying too hard to force a head pop.
---
just like Nurse
---
Sorry I wasn't clear my bad. If you weren't doing the glitch then you're fine. A lobby with 2 killer will look like this
---
Random survivor 1
---
Random survivor 2
---
Glitched survivor queued with glitched killer  
---
Normal killer
---
Glitched killer queued with glitched survivor
---
Only person getting banned here is the glitched killer(s).
---
Correct me if im wrong, but if the entity feed on hope  and you playing super toxic reduce the survivor's chance/hope of surviving would'nt it feed the entity less?
---
ATTENTION CITIZEN THIS IS AGAINST THE CIRCLEJERK, PREPARE FOR MASS DOWNVOTES.
---
That has always been the case.
---
So am I understanding this correctly, traps put on after ALL the gens are powered won't work but traps put on before still do? Seems a bit extreme to call that a nerf rather than a meta adjustment.
---
That's not true.
---
I understand why they made the changes, but they made one of her major powers useless after the gens are done. RBT have no purpose in the being applied in the end game. Can you think of any other killer that is the case for? 
---
If they felt that change was needed, they should have added some other modification or buff.
---
I‚Äôm confused. Are you saying spirit and huntress are as good as nurse?
---
I mean you shouldnt tunnel or camp. Its so unfun to play against that type of killer. If you are the type of killer that gets tbagged then im sry but bro chill its just a game. As Cote said go play another game if you are stressed playing dbd. Have you watched HybridPanda or Tru3talent.? These guys are so chill in the game, i like how they play. You should try it too. And for the main point killers are getting punished for camping and tunelling so im glad. Its not fun for me or for the others to die in the first 180 sec. I like to play a bit i dont care if i die after, but i just want to have fun both as killer or survivor. And if there is a guy with a trap following the killer then he wastes time... I mean if the survivor is following the killer with flashlight, its hard to get a save (looking into a wall or the pickup timer went from 5 to 3 sec)  so whatever... Try to enjoy the game not blame the devs or their stuff. Like they cant make everything happen, they do what they think is the best and after all they make a good thing out of that. We should support them and have some respect...
---
I don't agree with the changes she had but jeez, the people on this sub...the nerfs aren't as horrible as they say they are. They act like Pig went through some Freddy or Legion-style nerf...she hasn't. Relax a little
---
I think hes most fun to play against because you're always scared if hes watching you.
---
I know but as an game developer you can't just simply follow your normal formular by shreddering out cosmetics that aren't unique in some way. Davids topless torso is the best example for this and with no doubt their most selled item. 
---
And when players don't read a fucking red line in the shop that tells them to dont buy that shit if they want to keep wearing their p3 head than they deserve to be bamboozeled. Even as a game developer you can demand some kind of brain activity from your playerbase.
---
The community wants something special and would pay buttloads of money for it.
---
not as good, but pretty close
---
Pig nerfs are complete crap. Why should I fear the pig anymore? Great another killer to wreck. Welcome to even more Billy and nurse matches.
---
Nope. I‚Äôm the one saying they‚Äôre necessary and that the only reason you don‚Äôt agree is because you‚Äôre a killer main.
---
I strongly disagree.
---
&gt; You mean literally right now, this very moment? Yeah, I‚Äôm very much aware.
---
yeah hold that pedantic attitude. You are smart enough to know I am talking about pre / post patch notes, Asshat.
---
Survivors won't have time to 'bully' they will have to escape. That is the point. You can bitch about perks and certain abilities late game all you like. But it doesn't change the fact that the devs are aiming to remove one of the biggest BASE problems with the game - that players can exploit killers to make matches last an unlimited amount of time, and hatch standoffs to last an unlimited amount of time until someone gives in. That is obviously not how hatches were intended.
---
Sometimes you have to fix the base issues - then work bottom up and fix the things that the first fix impacts. If you keep re-balancing small perks and individual killers when these exploits exist, then the game will never be truly fixed.
---
It is pretty simple if you ask me.
---
because?
---
why the hell survivors would stay on your terror radious and following you? u dont think thats stupid, and well, now the traps are useful on early and mid game, so just use traps there, i think the pig is still the pig, just people cry when they see the nerf word nearby their name
---
To be fair he's sexy asf
---
Agreed and then I turn my camera, spot him, jump a little in my chair which means he catches me lol.
---
Lol they finally brought us together!
---
Can't you trap the survivors then start endgame? I thought the nerf was to traps applied after all gens were lit not before?
---
AND AGAIN, NONE OF THE CHANGES TO PIG ADDRESS CAMPING OR TUNNELLING, THEY SIMPLY NERF HER POWER IN ALL SITUATIONS.
---
I agree, but now you can‚Äôt really do that. I never like being so critical of a change. But come on. Your vaults are dog shit slow, you only can hit people once, the power is longer, but too slow to really get people if they‚Äôre spread out. You lose it if you miss your first hit, you lose it if you get power stunned EVEN if you aren‚Äôt using the power, and then there‚Äôs the 20 second cooldown.
---
I don‚Äôt want every killer to be billy tier, no. But I want every killer to be able to be mastered and be made strong. I actually fear it‚Äôs going to be the hardest with new legion, but we will see.
---
All that was really necessary was the pause in mending when in terror radius, and paused when your mending, and the removing of franks. But instead BHVR took a mechanically broken killer to a mechanically terrible killer, with his *BRAND NEW* ineffective addons.
---
It's just the format and this format is almost never used
---
Nurse has the best map pressure in the game. Huntress moves slow as shit and yes she can throw hatchets from a distance but any survivor using their camera can dodge those. Spirit is hard to go against at first but pretty easy to counter as well. You can‚Äôt counter a good nurse at all.
---
honestly if they just removed franks mixtape or changed it then he would probably be about as good as everyone thought he would be at first.
---
May 7th is likely. April 30th is possible since they made the PTB so short.
---
true! also nerf  Trapper, remove some traps (4) and make them yellow or red so they are easier to see and when he steps into them, they should get broken, then he is finally on Legion Level
---
HAHAHAHA GOODBYE PIG. What a shame, what a killer, what a mistake that has been added to the game xD fuck u pig mains
---
Again,  this is bullshit and exactly what I'm talking about.  If someone isn't playing who you want or how you want you just quit. Instead of tweaking your play style to get through a 10-15 minute match and move on to the next,  you'd rather just abandon causing the rest of that match to go into the trash for the other 4 players.
---
No, I'm just confused to why you think that End game collapse benefits killers in any meaningful way... 
---
It's designed to push trolling immersed survivors off the map... Extremely rare situation to happen, and doesn't really help killer to win the game - juts to end it after he already lost. 
---
You can close the hatch, avoiding the standoff... Exept it immediately powers the gates. And the time it takes to open gates where reduced. And remember me was nerfed. And hatch spawns even when no gens where completed. 
---
You can open gate yourself, immediately initiating end game... Yeah, that's just throwing the game.
---
End Game Collapse itself gives survivors more than enough time to win the game, especially since hooking people slows down the timer. 3-6 minutes after the gates are already powered? I wouldn't even call it a pressure, more like an afk timer. 
---
How exactly do any of theese additions buff killers again?
---
That's funny that you downvoted for this
---
*Panics and starts running towards the hatch*
---
Any decent survivor would agree pigs traps are piss easy to remove. The nerfs will only appeal to low ranks.
---
Enduring, Nurse's, No Mither and Sprit Burstoo.
---
True, but imho they should never be inactive,
---
I have a habit of immediately blocking anyone who's a bit of a dick lol, so she didn't get the chance.
---
It was an experimental change that they even mentioned would maybe not make into Live, depending on feedback during the PTB. But this time.. it ain't some experimental change. They're dead-set on going through with the End-Game.
---
I do that to take the aggro when I know that the killer will come over, so that the other survivor can continue on that Gen
---
He literally hit the tree, and it stopped his momentum before it registered a hit on the survivor. Crap like that happens all the time in games against Billy‚Äôs and Yet they somehow go through entire walls and land the hit a second later. I could understand if it was a ping issue and looked as such, but he literally HIT THE TREE FIRST.
---
Basically nurse is op Billy is really good and the rest are mostly controversial.
---
Ah ok thx.
---
This. They‚Äôre not even waiting for the endgame collapse to release before they start hobbling Killers. It‚Äôs like they‚Äôre looking at everything that might make a survivor‚Äôs life harder and cutting it out. How about we let the community play around with the mechanic a bit before we start making hard decisions about what‚Äôs fair and what‚Äôs not.
---
Mikey is by far the most fun killer to play. You can be ultra try hard serious with tuft and tombstone to ultra memes with Burger King Myers.
---
wrong, if you are able to counter Spirit (cant counter prayer beads), you are also able to counter nurse quite a bit by staying close and 360'ing her.
---
Also a good Huntress can get a free Hit at every unhook or pallet
---
It is tho
---
I should send this to BHVR, they'll know what to do
---
you don't need to see the timer the only point of deep wounds is keep survivors off a gen for 8 sec
---
In theory. In practice, active traps don‚Äôt stop you from escaping either. I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôll get fixed in a hurry. üôÑ
---
Your second to last sentence was accurate. But I think we can agree NOT A SINGLE SOUL wanted another boring killer. I, for one wanted a rework for legion, maybe a cool power, or something different. Nope.
---
ye
---
I‚Äôm not going off addons. If so Myers could be considered s tier. And yes you can 360 a nurse pretty easily and change directions to cause misses. But someone who has mastered nurse that doesn‚Äôt work. Nurse is In a league of her own
---
imagine this. Survivors trap is 90% done. They just start a box, but their not gonna make it, unless they get 5 skillchecks in a row and hit greats on all of them. You, as the pig, chase another survivor, and u happen to pass by them 31 metres away. The timer stops. You werent tunneling, camping or exploiting. You were doing ur job, chasing and trying to kill other survivors. See the issue?
---
Oh boy a whole 8 seconds, Pig's takes up to 2 mintutes, Doctors takes longer, Hell even FREEDY wastes more time.
---
These nerfs suck. Now I get to face even more Billy and nurses. Yayyyyyy less variety
---
I agree. I mainly play Survivor and I think these random killer nerfs are really unnecessary. I have my complaints but that doesn't mean I want the game to be super easy for me.
---
Meh. I'm sure no one cares about the other 4 when the bring Iri Heads and Ebonies to end their game as quickly as possible. Same with 2016 4 man BNPers.
---
m a d e  w i t h   m e m e a t i c
---
Regardless of how she‚Äôll be more or less effective, this change is still a nerf. They are nerfing a already low tier killer and making her power less usable overall. 
---
These changes are Unnecessary to begin with and the fact that people are being so accepting of changes to a very weak killer‚Äôs only usable power, regardless of situation, is baffling to me.
---
Are you telling me that you cant knock down each survivor before they finish the 5th gen?
---
What have they changed? I can‚Äôt find the patch notes
---
My biggest problem with the new legion is that he loses his power if he gets stunned even if he is not using it its pretty stupid tbh
---
EGC should start when the last gen is powered, not when the a gate is opened.
---
Yeah, it was supposed to be dropped to 50% since you need a full meter now and it recharges more slowly.
---
yes, it does work on good players, you just need alot of practise.
---
but even without Prayer Beads Spirits Mindgames are pretty OP and you didnt respond to my Huntress point
---
Terror radius
---
I think the nerfs are overblown by the community but they still are pretty harsh nerfs. If behavior is going to tweak her kit at least give her buffs in other areas to round her out.
---
The legion is good and really fun to me I hope they didn‚Äôt make any bad changes
---
I hope you are joking, what wraith needs is a buff if anything, i would like if they put a higher movement speed when cloaked
---
Not all legion players used exploits and were bad. I‚Äôm damn tired of people acting like this because I like the character and play them. It‚Äôs annoying. You mentioned longer duration. See slower speed, like, not really noticeable from 115 slow. Hey but at least legion won‚Äôt get shit from people anymore, right? Now just a M1 boring killer, so survivor mains can be happy and killer mains can deal with it, right?
---
&gt; Few months ago: It's weird that Legion can't see people mending, can you make it so nurse's calling works like Snap out of it and waking up. *Takes nurses calling off both*
---
As someone who plays a lot of Doc I'm still salty about this.
---
As someone who hates the pig more than anything in this game (including legion), I love and hate the changes.
---
I love them because this killer I hate facing is getting a big old nerf and it makes me happy to know that her power does nothing now.
---
As a killer main however it‚Äôs a little ridiculous that this low tier killer is getting a pretty substantial nerf in order for her to work in the new endgame.
---
They arent the worse map as killers, I think its either Plagues mape or the game., 
---
Fuck the Game map.
---
ugh, yes. the nerfs are stupid and i don't even play Pig. facing her was awesome every time as survivor. any good Pig even with a noed has my respect.
---
if you ask me, i want them to buff her, actually
---
Don't be mentally deficient; just learn English! Just because someone doesn't speak English doesn't make them an idiot (or a carrot, either). He tried. Helpful pointers help way more than being a dick waffle, so keep that in mind.
---
well, a hatchstandoff was a win for a survivor?
---
Agreed. Better in terms of not being cancerous to face. From what I‚Äôve seen from gameplay, the power is riskier and only serves for easier first hits, tracking and time wasting. The 115% really helps secure downs. It‚Äôs a good groundwork for further changes to refine their power and make them better. I don‚Äôt think this is be end for them, more so the beginning. People always overreact when a new killer or big changes are implemented so it‚Äôs best to give people time to calm down.
---
Finally a post that acknowledges Legion‚Äôs nerf is also BAD because that killer is already WEAK!!! Thank you op!
---
doc tire 3 snap is the same amount of time pig's trap is rng it could take 10 sec or 2 min and freddy gives you 7 sec head start legion dosn't
---
I shouldn‚Äôt have to. Don‚Äôt drop the pallet when she winds up and she can‚Äôt do anything. The only time huntress really shines is thru double window jungle gyms or windows in general. And I have plenty of experience in this game to know a good nurse can counter anything you do. That‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt like her bc she bypasses mechanics of the game. But I think you‚Äôre missing the point to this thread. He basked for good killers to play and I have 2 suggestions for him.
---
No they aren't. I think I played a total of 10 games last night. First one, my gf got face camped and died on her first hook. There were 3 gens to go and she was third to be hooked. The killer's excuse was that she didnt see anyone with bbq. I later got face camped even harder because the gates were powered. 
---
The next 9 games were similar. Killers were tunneling survivors off the hook before we even found the ruin totem. Survivors were DCing in droves. We had a slugging nurse with noed. A freddy who tunneled me so hard off hook that I died from getting hooked 3 times before we even finished one gen. Lots of good shit. I had one fun game in that whole thing.
---
But yeah, keep thinking that it's a reaction. In my experience, it's just bad killers who can't win any other way.
---
Please, you sound silly.
---
if u get tunnelled by a pig, its a 3 man escape, even with the trap on, coz its standard tunnelling and the trap doesnt go down in chases. If shes preventing chase and still following you with ur trap ticking, 2 gens could be done and completely lose her another 2 kills. These nerfs were completely unnecessary, the ability didnt need a change, the EGC timer when combined with her traps did.
---
I use $$ for that
---
I need BP's
---
yep, i've faced 3 Billies in a row on a god damn ptb. assume it's due to frustration from former Pig mains :c
---
They arent better, they are sightly worse. They feel slow and clunky now, Deep Wounds doesnt really DO Anything, and it just feels bad. 
---
With a few changes it could feel better.
---
Yeah that may be true. But you know they think it is right so... And they just put it in the PTB so there ia a chance to it is not making in the live servers. And because of that there is a PTB survey so if you dont like it then just write it in there. And dont be like: "I hate it." put some reasons for it to not publish it to the live servers, add some advices what should be changed otherwise and dont be rude or bitchy about what's happening...
---
Yes, But Freddy reducdes action speed by a shit ton while they are sleeping AND forces them to use Skill checks which make noise and waste time. 
---
You also cant do anything while your in Tier 3. There is also plague who wastes more time.
---
I've seen too many Nea's try to act like our Lord and Savior Noob3 and they always fail miserably.
---
There's nothing as funny as triggered gamers. I bet you took a big part of the outrage towards Diablo Immortal.
---
and to hell with your opinion, community must rise! we can't let these changes happen for live version. they're ridiculous. i hate that devs only consider the opinion of low rank casual players. they don't buy as much stuff as dedicated high rank players, like what the hell, man
---
Spirit
---
&gt; Davids topless torso is the best example
---
No, it's not, it remained in the established system. Also most of the cosmetics are unique in some way without fucking up the current head-torso system.
---
&gt; and with no doubt their most selled item. 
---
Do we have data on this?
---
&gt; And when players don't read a fucking red line in the shop that tells them to dont buy that shit if they want to keep wearing their p3 head than they deserve to be bamboozeled. Even as a game developer you can demand some kind of brain activity from your playerbase.
---
It's not like the people who don't read text are dumb or don't have brain activity. It's just part of how human attention works. I will now also make a wild guess and say that even you haven't read any texts in the ingame store, have you? But see, that's the thinking I'm talking about that should be prevented. When your playerbase is unsatisfied when they bought something they didn't want to, you shouldn't think "Haha, bamboozled, they deserved it" but "How do I prevent this?". Because you also want to keep your playerbase and not handle them as braindead people.
---
&gt; The community wants something special and would pay buttloads of money for it.
---
I'll also have a wild guess here: I think they are better at predicting their sales than any of us and if it would worth the hassle then they would have already worked it out.
---
Uh yea.
---
Pig got nerfed, for no darn reason.
---
So we make heck ton of posts to show DBD why pig shouldn‚Äôt get a Nerf.
---
i dont know what im looking at but i think i like it
---
This might be a good idea (others prob thought it first tho)
---
You can‚Äôt place traps on after the countdown starts
---
If a trap is on before the countdown starts it‚Äôll stay activated, but after it starts no can do
---
It‚Äôs a good combination of not making it too overpowered for pig but also not just entirely fucks over the pig
---
deep wounds blocks everything that uses m1 expect unhooking same thing with snap the only thing doc has on legion is that survivors cant use flashlights
---
If you disconnect just  beacuse of the type of killer thats in the match, then you are a little bitch, sorry/not sorry, but its the truth
---
A gaming PC lasts longer than two console generations and is cheaper than 2 consoles.
---
And if you get a gaming laptop, it's portable.
---
Bois help me out here, how much time to get  2000 shards, I just purchased nurses and want enduring too. 
---
I am at currently 222 shards right now
---
Did you tried it?
---
It's a nerf since if you trap someone and go after someone else the person with a trap has no incentive to really take it off if your engaging another person within a chase since it won't go down so you'll probably get rushed down even faster than before also you go way slower when the pig is crouching so if your planning on following them like that outside of specific box placements your going to lose not to mention if you put trap on before the last gen pops they can bait you into a chase and then leave since you can escape with inactive traps which is dumb
---
I would make a Hex totem as my nightlight, but it would probably end up being broken before I fall asleep
---
..Um no it doesnt.

I was always of the opinion that you might as well just let them have it. You‚Äôre incredibly unlikely to grab them jumping in and they can just go do gens if you actually camp it. Really easy for a survivor to get out either way. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever even lost a hatch standoff as a survivor. The thing is, I didn‚Äôt want the fix for that to be, ‚ÄúYeah, you might as well just let them have it. They‚Äôll likely get out either way.‚Äù
---
being "tunneled" by a Pig your timer stops, man. she doesn't need nerfs, she needs a buff.
---
It always happens to my friend (the Meg t-posing) and no one else
---
I will fully admit I didn‚Äôt. But other people have, and it looks terrible, and boring. And we have brains me and you, and both of us can see that the changes have made legion into the worst killer imo. Even with addons
---
I was scared too when i was read upcoming changes, but when i tried ptb it was even better then it now on live
---
The amount of DC's have risen ever since the last update where they included the Plague.
---
The game simply removesa random survivor or the survivors DC the moment they see a legion.
---
Ive been playing killer and a lot of people DC if i take them down before a gen is done.
---
Idk if a streamer has been promoting DC's but if they are the guys that are following in his/her footsteps are just little pricks that want to be cool but they are just being assholes.
---
both those maps are easily playable as killer if you cant do well on those maps you got an issue, but a map where one of your main ways to find survivors is no longer usable, kinda make the map completely fucked.
---
True..Those maps are annyoing because of the levels they have.
---
A 90% trap is really rare. You passing them by while chasing somebody else is even more rare. So I wouldn't say this is a big issue and "completely evaporates" any tension.
---
I meant ‚Äúout of‚Äù as in when it ends, sorry for the misconception
---
He said not high tier
---
this game is dumb in a way that everything uses space or m1 and deep wounds has priority over everything that isn't unhooking because  unhooking is top priority
---
You made me switch to live version to confirm. I haven't played Legion in like a month, so I wasn't 100% sure, but I never read this change anywhere and I played Legion quite a lot the first 3 months. 
---
You're actually right, this is already the case in the live version. Must have been a shadow nerf at some point, or I just didn't see in some patch notes? Anyway, thanks for commenting, I stand corrected.
---
This has been the most overwhelmingly negative feedback I've seen from their patch notes. This was meant to be a really positive change for the end game and instead they nerfed SO MANY killer perks, and mechanics and there's almost no change for survivors except you're only allowed 2:59 of teabagging before you have to leave.
---
Nerfing a well-liked mid-low tier killer (who according to that stat guy's recent stats even has the lowest DC rate for survivors) into the ground is just completely unjustified, especially when they still refuse to touch Nurse and Billy who are so far beyond other killers it isn't even funny.
---
That...what? What are you even saying i dont even understand what your trying to say at this point.
---
It's hardly extreme. No matter how you slice it it's a nerf. It's a nerf designed to adjust for the meta, but still. Inactive traps won't trigger at the gate also. Between that and the terror radius adjustment they're definitely nerfs - absolutely no upside to the changes or buff to go along with them. Unless you count the ability to use active traps as a ghetto version of Whispers now, encouraging tunnelling of the trapped Survivor. But I'd hardly call that a good thing or healthy for the game considering how much people hate it when Pigs do it.
---
And honestly I don‚Äôt know what people want. They are outraged at the oof getting changed, but if she wasn‚Äôt then everyone would DC as soon as they saw a jigsaw box. They‚Äôd know exactly how the game would go, they‚Äôd get stuck in the endgame, and they‚Äôd have to change her anyway. Even if the argument is that there was a better way to do it, they still had to do something. And if people are angry about the terror radius thing, it‚Äôs won‚Äôt as big a change as everyone is making it out to be. I think the reaction is totally blown out of proportion
---
oh ye looks like im getting downvotes too
---
yeah, RBT timer was always paused if you were tunneled. perfect balance! i don't see why in the world a low mid tier killer needs any nerfs. 
---
and frankly, i think the op here is a low rank casual player who only meets trash killers who know nothing better than tunneling, any GOOD Pig player will never waste time on a person with RBT cause that is the whole point of RBT. means that person is not doing god damn gens. simple as that, holy hag. 
---
and seriously, how the fuck Pig gets nerfs while Billy and Nurse don't, that's ridiculous. these two tunnel and camp on high ranks SO MUCH. they slug, they camp they tunnel, they play dirty cause these two are strong killers that are made to do 4k so naturally only those who aim for full victory no matter the cost choose them. i am Freddy main on rank 1 and i play for fun. and i play Pig sometimes because it's fun. i don't care for kills. anyone on red ranks uses mid/low tier killers because they like fun, god dammit.
---
This.
---
You know what I'd consider a trash match? An omegablink ebony Nurse. You think that player has any regards for how much fun we will have? They have none, so I'll return the favor.
---
dont worry guys im upvoting posts that have been downvoted by uneducated potatos. i like how everyone was like "LEgIOn BaD nERF legion" but now everyone is like "Rip legion, we will miss you :("
---
Well that was to be expected....
---
All others, I think is a bit too much. There are still plenty of QoL changes some killers would gladly appreciate. 
---
Also I hope we get a big killer addon rework because the glaring shift of power on some addons vs the absolute necessity Of others is just a headache.
---
One time I was in a bad mood and I was playing trapper. I was chasing someone who was good at looping. I got pretty salty and BMed after downing him but then I realized that I was being a dickhead so I sent him a message and apologized. It felt really good too(apologizing, not BMing). I learned from mistakes
---
Pig isn‚Äôt getting obliterated. The nerf was still a lazy ‚Äúoptimization‚Äù though.
---
Oof!
---
But i tried and now he is way better then he was, i played him like a 1/4 of my games, and was scarry about changes till they relised on ptb, then i tried and it the same legion i played because i was like running around split up survivors, way easyer to hit without using power, survovors still wasting they are time for mending or healing, and cheasing with power hit +spirit fury/enduring rushing pallets it is a free down
---
you can't do anything that uses m1 while your in deep wounds other then unhooking a survivor like repairing gen opening doors healing anything that would use m1 normally gets blocked
---
NANI?
---
I‚Äôm sorry but are we reading the same patch notes? These changes are completely destroying an already mediocre killer. I hope to god these changes don‚Äôt go live but knowing BHVR they probably will.
---
I understand that. I‚Äôll wait until the thing is released for console and try it.
---
Yes, thats why i know what i talking about
---
Pepega
---
But then the killer lets you complete a gen and escape. thanks, kind killers
---
Yeah. I noticed it a couple of months ago when I was memeing with a full exposed legion build and survivors were camping pallets. It's just sad how one guy has like -6 karma for saying the same thing, and yet he is right.
---
EGC is a killer nerf.
---
Harder to see scratch marks
---
Gates open quicker
---
Hatch spawns with any number of gens
---
Remember me nerfed
---
Pig traps nerfed
---
How does it help killers? Stops AFK survivors from holding the game hostage. Three minutes minimum is a ridiculous amount of time when the gate is open. I can't think of any times I have been around longer than three minutes. Any time I am around is because someone is on a hook, where the timer would be further slowed anyway.
---
I never said they were better all i wanna say is people are overreacting and has become a hypocrite. 
---
Reddit: ‚ÄúDELETE LEGION REEEEEEEEEEEE‚Äù
---
Bhvr:‚Äùfixes the main issue‚Äù
---
Also reddit: ‚ÄúREEEEEEEEEEEE YOU KILLED LEGION HOW DARE YOU REEEEEEE‚Äù
---
While all they did was remove the cancer in his kit and made him a basic m1 killer with the first hit for free. Stop overeacting and stop the hypocresy. You guys cried for this and you got what you cried for.
---
No, I do like your flair. The devs are ducking up my girl so I‚Äôm not very happy with them
---
Yup, I've had this issue since Friday, haven't played for a couple of days because of how frustrated I was.
---
Everyone here is brushing it off because it doesn't affect them and the devs are probably 100% focused on the PTB, so I think we're going to have this bug for a while. Nevermind it's a game-breaking one, clearly the endgame collapse is more important...
---
If I can't play for the bloodhunt I'm going to be *really* pissed haha.
---
I never cried for a legion nerf or delete acaullty, so yes i can complain. 
---
He is worse in every way and they arent fun to play and they are boring to fight agasint now.
---
Yea and I‚Äôm still pissed because she did need changes because she would be stupid OP during EGC, BUT these were just lazy ‚Äúlogical changes‚Äù in the form of nerfs. She will definitely be worse but not post PTB legion tier, just use the traps before all the gens pop.
---
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, it‚Äôs builshit, nerfing an ‚Äúok‚Äù killer, and the road DBD is taking is a terrible one.
---
I can agree that PCs are better but still, some people don‚Äôt have that amount of money.
---
It was there before Plague, for sure. Very possibly since the new year event, but my memory isn't good enough to be sure of that.
---
Dang this looks a lot like mine but wraith, isnt drawing like that so satisfying? For me it's only after it comes together, when I first started jesus christ it was SO BAD

I'm glad to have made your day funnier in some aspect.
---
nurse really isnt skill based you playher for 4 hrs and you 4k all the time thats it needing 4hrs to learn a killer does not mean the killer needs skill
---
Yeah but he was really poorly designed and had no skillsealing counterplay or interaction they had to fix this and they did and now all reddit are crying cause they got what they wanted
---
They are too lazy. Lazy and incompetent.
---
Davids Torso was for months the top meme here on Reddit and like anywhere else related to Dead by Daylight so yes, i can surely assume that is their best selled item (fight me).
---
And yes it is a good example for a good cosmetic, since its revealing parts of Davids body we haven't seen yet. And thats how cosmetics should work (dont take that ouf of context), they should make the community to buy them, regardless if they have the attidue of not being stuff in an already paid game or if they just dont like cosmetics in generel. That makes a good cosmetic and Feng Min's hoodie would be just like that or even better. 
---
I also read every items description that i bought since it genuinely interested me. I also would read these "item-warning" if they were put there but sadly Bhvr only follows their standard cosmetic formular to shredd out these cosmetics instead of actually making one cosmetic for each character that has some kind of special effort put into it, that surprises the community and makes them buy it.
---
150k. And you should save them. I almost spent mine but then BBQ came out..
---
You know these changes are horrendous when Peppa Pigsaw, the most hardcore pig main I know, won‚Äôt play pig after the changes.
---
DAMN. You serious?
---
It has happened to me a handful of times, mostly when spiteful SWF survivors sought revenge for their fallen teammates, I guess. I would also not say it is an issue haunting the game, but the fact that it is possible for a survivor to hold the game hostage that way, and generally grief by staying around for long as possible taunting the killer, is an obvious error in design, and remedying it is long-overdue.
---
What does this mean??? When does it play?
---
Is this easy mode?
---
Do you hear the default music in the menu now? It's my favorite
---
On hit: Deal mini-crit damage, lights opponent on fire, disables buildings.
---
On miss: Get headshot. Idiot.
---
I'm crying because they just made another problem by trying to fix another by making Legion unplayable and useless instead of balanced.
---
I already have enduring, actually by the time she was level 5 for me she already had enduring 3, pretty lucky bloodweb
---
Yup. Said he‚Äôs not gonna play pig when she‚Äôs getting fucked this hard.
---
Maybe I never pay attention but there are multiple pallet models? I thought it was just the horizontal right one
---
pig can't see it because she'd know when someone's in and out of her terror radius
---
I can understand that. But at least mettle of man and adrenaline aren‚Äôt going anywhere though, right?/s
---
True facts
---
Before it was in a Chase though not Terror Radius before the PTB.
---
It really depends on how much you play. I think you level up faster as Survivor because you don‚Äôt have to play matches as long as Killer. I personally get 1500-2000 shards per day, but that‚Äôs cause I play an average of 10 hrs per day. I can‚Äôt really estimate since everyone plays differently, but if you play 2-3 hours per day you should be totally fine.
---
Nice, now pair that with Spirit Fury and you're unstoppable.
---
‚ÄúUnplayeble‚Äù the hell you talking about he is just a weaker killer he still beat lf and trapper cause his power can still be used in a match for the free injury. Trapper and LF are m1 killers whose power never get used cause they are that weak agianst decent to good survs
---
As a pig main, the dash is the worst part of her toolkit. With sprint burst being so prevalent it's almost always better to go for a gen grab by uncrouching.
---
Lickage
---
No it hasn't just nerfed killers - it has nerfed anything related to the end game - To stop the game being held hostage - the biggest problem with the game. What other games do you know that can be held hostage?
---
The only killer truly effected is the pig for obvious reasons. Having a hissy fit isn't going to solve any issues.
---
Hatch spawns with one player left ffs. That means that the hatch cannot be found before this, That is way better for killers than before, it becomes a race. Many of these points are buffs for killers and survivors alike and nerfs for killers and survivors alike, in different ways. It is because the game is changing somewhat to stop killers being abused. Sure it sounds bad if you only focus on the negatives affecting you.
---
Three minutes is currently unlimited minutes lmao...
---
It is truly amazing me how dull (or maybe just young) most are being on this subreddit not being able to see the bigger picture.

---
&gt; haha sure buddy, thats why the pig gets nerfed, the legion destroyed and everyone just being totally happy about the changes they make in general...
---
What does this have to do with cosmetic sales?
---
Thanks! Just finishing John's work!
---
Nope, explicitly tested the TR change already on the PTB on her own map. Traps constantly paused for seemingly no reason giving survivors more time than they needed or deserved to check the 5 boxes (I ran +1 box and +1 trap).
---
It's a big nerf and even if it was small, it's 100% unjustified. Her power is weak and she is weak. 
---
As for the end game change, so what? 3 minutes is more than enough time to find the key (considering traps are 2 minutes, people already find keys no problem), and if you get downed a trap put on you with only 20 seconds left. Well, that sucks but I guess you should have left when you had the chance. You lost and are done. There's nothing wrong with a killer under very specific circumstances being able to corner a survivor. The whole idea that survivors "always need a way to live no matter how many mistakes they've made" is getting old. 
---
It's that attitude that makes survivors mad at killers who camp someone in the end game, they can't accept that the person who was caught is probably dead and they can just leave. Everyone always says "killers shouldn't expect a 4k every game", well survivors shouldn't expect 4 survivals either. /shrug

Every time he misses ‚ÄúDead Hard‚Äù

Every time a pallet is put down ‚ÄúNice‚Äù

I saw that response and just didn't have time or crayons to refute it. Thx for taking one for the team.

And now youre calling me a nerd? Aight bro i see

Haha jokes on them, they will have to live out their lives with a reverse bear trap on their-
---

---
Excuse me.. the fuck!
---
Thanks, and yeah I'll save them; BBQ will help me with BPs from here on out.
---
I would think i would rather just have to the pig back to normal rather than some shitty cosmetics to calm the angry storm
---
Cool! Not sure how stable they‚Äôd be for cups lol üòÜ
---
How do you check your hours?
---
Oink.
---
you could somewhat tell if someone leaves your terror radius too (but it also stops when they mend so that wouldn't work as well)
---
I was under the impression that if there was 3 gens left and 1 survivor alive, the hatch would spawn. If the killer closed the hatch, the gates would then be opened, thus activating the exit gates and activating noed. Is this not the case?
---
No he doesnt. The problem with Legion is Franks mistape and the moon walking. Fixing those is the first main thing. 
---
Then you can juke them more to make the timer go down faster, and even not let him get more hits to lower deep wounds if needed. 
---
They shouldnt have at least lost the speed and stabby part as that is what there power was meant to be.
---
thx bhvr all ready unlocked tihs perk :D
---
Piggy V best girl... So sad, patch notes broke my heart
---
Lol the vault speed on Legion feels like they're on acid every time you do it. That nerf was unnecessary as fuck. The rest are fine but Jesus Christ. You nerf every aspect of their power. Looks like they need spirit fury and enduring.
---
It has something to do with selling their game lol. You shouldn't need to know how promote or how your cosmetics would sell if your game would be so good that the community just buys them regardless, but with them fucking up in like every major update they are producing, its kinda hard to believe they know what **we** really want**.**
---
What? Did a Pig down you and make you DC?
---
Just look into your steam library before lauching the game, it shows you how many hours you've played a game
---
The vertical one existed for a time. Haven't seen it in ages though.
---
No the issue was him lacking counterplay an interaction making him unfun to fight
---
Implying he did before.
---
Fair enough. I can‚Äôt really enjoy their content since it‚Äôs repetitive, at least for me.
---
Good riddance legion, you won't be missed.
---
too late. they are pretty much removing his power.
---
And just nerfing him to the ground was the fix? No.
---
You'd be surprised what tools can save a life. &lt;applies suntan lotion&gt;
---
Yes but it's a dead by daylight subreddit keep that format in a pewdiepie subreddit
---
Alright honestly you‚Äôve changed my mind. Those are pretty good points. So basically, her traps are only useful during the game when there isn‚Äôt really a threat of them killing you off. So it‚Äôs pretty much another  way of slowing the game down. I think people are gonna have to solely capitalize on the extra time that the traps give, like another ruin
---
How did they massacre my girl? Please tell me
---
I only play Pig occasionally and I don't really understand the logic behind these nerfs. Would Collapse make her end-game stronger? Absolutely. Would it be to such a degree that it's gamebreaking and in need to some sort of immediate drastic change like making her TR halt trap progress? Absolutely not.
---
100k of a player base can indeed make a difference.
---
[Quote from the FAQ thread:](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/comment/427488/#Comment_427488)
---
&gt;ILL THE HATCH STILL SPAWN IF THERE'S MORE THAN ONE SURVIVOR LEFT?  
---
The hatch spawning rules have not changed aside from scenarios where only one survivor remains. The hatch will spawn under the following circumstances:
---
&gt;4 Survivors alive: Five generators must be powered. Hatch is closed.  
---
3 Survivors alive: Four generators must be powered. Hatch is closed.  
---
2 Survivors alive: Three generators must be powered. Hatch is closed.  
---
1 Survivor alive: Hatch will spawn regardless of generators completed. Hatch is open.
---
You can't close the hatch if it's already closed. The hatch must open first.
---
Also:
---
&gt;CAN THE KILLER OPEN THE EXIT GATES AT ANY POINT IN THE TRIAL, OR ONLY ONCE THE GENERATORS ARE POWERED?  
---
The Killer can only open the gates when the generators have been powered.
---
You can't open the doors in advance, so you can't trigger NOED manually except by closing the hatch.
---
new animation is better than mori's agreed?
---
you can't hit a second time with feral. i what i've been hearing.
---
I just give up on hook instead. It makes no sense to DC.
---
Survivors nerfs: -1% to 1 good perk
---
Killer nerfs: -200% to multiple perks, add ons, and powers
---
It really makes me laugh when people complain about survivor changes when most of them are pretty balanced, but when a killer gets nerfed they're nerfed in the ground.
---
a wholesome killer
---
Right? If you just extend the chase or fake a swing, the dumbasses waste it every time.
---
That would hurt killers way more than it would hurt survivors.
---
Besides Nurse.
---
Unpopular opinion atm, nurse doesn't need a nerf. As is shes is the only one that can deal best with the bull swf dish out at top ranks. If they nerf nurse the community will go back to this recent legion update saying they hate it and that they nerfed the killer too hard.
---
I have 500 shards.. how much Nurses is? And can I make enough shards in 1 week if I only play a few games/day?
---
Do you not pay attention to what gens are being worked on or what's happening around you? It is not hard at all to know where to go next. At all.
---
Murmur is better because it tells you how many people are on what gen, and what they all are planning on doing next, and if anyone decided to get into a locker, and you CANNOT counter it as easily as BBQ, which is insanely counterable
---
Yep, it does wonders for BP
---
But if I‚Äôm chasing I‚Äôm not gonna randomly crouch to ‚Äúsee if there‚Äôs a trapped survivor‚Äù
---
Oh, I'm on console :(
---
I love translating their post-game messages
---
2000 shards. If you play a bit every day you should be able to get enough. Might have to play a bit more near the end if you don‚Äôt seem close enough.
---
#AmandaDidNothingWrong
---
I don't think anyone is intentionally downranking right now. It's just stupid hard and time consuming to rank up
---
Good luck making sure they don't remove the traps. You're talking like RBTs are permanent once placed.
---
Ah ok.
---
They dont have the power to do that unless the Saw frnachise says otherwise. They didnt to begin with, i'd doubt they would now.
---
I'm also saving myself the headache, which is more than enough justification, in my opinion.
---
I don't think this is possible. The actual head is usually a different mesh. This might cause problems with hair clipping and animation for the head and hoodie.
---
Beats me. I enjoyed the game the most at the beginning levels whether I was playing survivor or killer.
---
Clearly opinions &amp; ideas aren‚Äôt allowed though given the above downvote.
---
But what about the Freddy Rework? I thought they said it was gonna be for this kid chapter update.
---
This was really well made, good job man. I‚Äôd love to have this as an official chapter
---
Yeah it's a complete fucking turn around.
---
It may not make sense from a points perspective, but it does make sense from a fun perspective.
---
Ehh. Survivors should have a chance to save and be saved. It wouldn‚Äôt be right for someone to be on their first hook, and you only have like 35 seconds to save them as opposed to the usual 2 minutes.
---
Oh, sorry, can't help you then :/
---
all hail the almighty entity
---
&gt; You shouldn't need to know how to promote or how your cosmetics would sell if your game would be so good that the community just buys them regardless.
---
It's funny because it seems I'm more happy with the game's current state than you are ("them fucking up in like every major update they are producing" is not at all true in my opinion and I also think the current changes aren't as tragic as this subreddit reacts to it) but I still don't by any cosmetics yet from your comments I assume you have purchased some. So the cosmetic sales are not that dependent on the updates.
---
It won't be as bad but you can't escape the issue no matter what mm system you use. People always find a way to abuse it.
---
Eh, red ranks is extremely boring. Same killers, same perks setup.
---
I'm gonna say this despite the downvotes I'm ready for but I'm happy the RBT doesn't kill you when you leave now at the end of the game. It was annoying as hell when you had to get the trap off end game where the pig would just patrol all the boxes and you're pretty much guaranteed to not make it out. I know it's her gimmick but it felt really unfair a lot of times considering there's no other way to get it off. So being saved off the hook was a death sentence regardless.
---
I guess i truly dont care if they revert it bc the pig can still just tunnel you down anyway and you wouldnt have time to get to a gate or search a box.
---
&gt;It's nothing more than a tissue paper bandaid.
---
As sadly expected.
---
The main part of her ability is the dash??
---
Are we playing different games? The main part of her ability is game delay from people needing to search the boxes. Nobody gets hits off dash attacks, people just stand up and run at you since the ambush mechanic sucks.
---
Yeah these posts won't see more than 2k upvotes... Of course it can make a difference.
---
But there is a difference between constructive feedback - and thinking you know the game better than the developers and bullying them into making or reverting changes - based on your initial biased backlash that something isn't what you are used to.
---
When game developers run their games based off of the loudest and whiniest people circle jerking eachother on reddit (that probably make up less than 5% of the player base) - then they are doomed to fail.
---
Run the killer around with it on a pixel of exhaustion so when you slam down a pallet and you can sprint burst away to a new loop
---
You still lose them.
---
Free Saw‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Reverse Bear Trap cosplay item included at exit gates
---
They do ban survivors who consistently dc \*apparently\*
---
Mh that makes sense, but i can't think of any other idea than just blocking off the head.
---
Is it like you lose all of them when the obsession is killed?
---
By simply making Rule Set built in and maybe an ultra rare add on to silence her dash roar, or some small buffs to that extent, I think the changes would have been much more accepted tbh
---
He‚Äôs got an ego thats for sure. It‚Äôs like Kaplan from Overwatch. Christ!
---
Sexy time has begun
---
I agree pig is F, but the worst killer in the game? Not even close. She still has more utility than Freddy and leatherface. We‚Äôll have to wait for Freddy‚Äôs rework to see if he‚Äôll be shit or not.
---
&gt; Hatch spawns with one player left ffs. That means that the hatch cannot be found before this
---
No, it spawns just like it did before, but if they do no gens the hatch will still spawn. Before the killer could wipe the whole team so quick that they still have to do the hatch, now he can wipe the whole team and still have a person get the hatch.
---
The only good thing for the killer now is that they can close the hatch.
---
&gt; it has nerfed anything related to the end game
---
Gates opening quicker only help the survivors, Remember me being nerfed only helps the survivors, the red marks everywhere on the floor only helps the survivors.
---
Only thing killers got was the ability to close hatches, but by the same logic of the EGC, that is just to stop hatch standoffs.
---
&gt; Three minutes is currently unlimited minutes lmao...
---
How many games do you have which have gone on for more than three minutes with the exit gate open?
---
In what fucking world is pig F-tier? She literally has a built in ruin in her kit.
---
every pvp game has this issue, its nothing new.
---
The pig needs a way to activate the traps in end game...maybe being hit while wearing an inactive trap activates it?
---
Everybody has an ego and artists need to keep theirs to make the work they are producing special.
---
Please tell me this is satire
---
Well done my dude. I like pretty much all of it. Give us these poppets please!
---
The RBT is barely lethal though, like out of 200 or 300 survivors only 4% die from it. It's entirely useless now but before it wasn't a very effective tool until the endgame where the traps automatically start AND automatically trigger past the exit gate. Now that they removed that entirely, well, there's just no fuckin point in the pigs ability. She's just a Wraith without the cloaking now.
---
So, I'm still not understanding this nerf being such huge negative. If I trap 4 people then flip the switch does that not put them in some serious crunch time? I feel like the traps not working after the flip is logical as it would almost ensure the survivors struggle for nothing.
---
Spirit is lower than Hillbilly and Huntress just because her power is more based on mindgames than it is on actual skill..a good survivor at rank one can usually outplay a Spirit, while there's no outplaying a huntress with godlike aim.  
---
It's based heavily on personal experience/streamers I view.  
---
As for Legion I feel like these were buffs for Rank 1 players, but nerfs for everyone else..these are my personal opinions after all, and from what I feel, I'll be playing Legion more and getting more 4K's than I did before just due to the new changes able to really benefit someone at higher ranks.
---
Doesn't it would be wrong too. Doesn't = Does not, just as Isn't = Is not
---
The correct wording would be, "Looks quite similar, does it not?"
---
This is just being nitpicky though, people still understand the context.
---
I seen this face before this and laughed lmao. I don't remember why he made it tho..?
---
Just my personal opinion, I've never thought Freddy was the worst killer, and feel like Plague is more or less worse than Clown, Doctor and Myers.
---
They either have something that gives them a really good chase tool, or in Doctor's case, can prevent a survivor from even using pallets or windows, while also being able to find them rather easily with his power.
---
These are based off Rank 1 gameplay, nothing less, so in this case, my opinion is based on what will come from this, Pig will be the worst killer IMO, Legion will be B tier..for me. Others may disagree but it's all an opinion.
---
P3 Clauds are free points. Every time I see one in my lobby I feel bad for their team.
---
u/not_Queen_bhvr
---
Have a look at this and please think before you make these changes into the live build.
---
Wait I don't get this post. You say it's too much but your solution is to double the penalty?
---
To the people who have been asking why I hate pig. Everyone uses her power to crouch camp me on a hook behind a tree (and I mean everyone), tunnels me after I've been unhooked (with a trap on my head of course) and makes sure to crouch after me again to make the bear trap pops. And no...I have never dc'd, I dont even have a reason to do so. I am the king of never dc'ing btw. And I'm also never gonna lose that title
---
if they do then this game must have had millions of players before all those bans happened cause I get at least 2+ DCs every damn game
---
Nurse main here, and I completely agree with you.
---
One thing I suggested was to make it so that her lunge range is reduced to just as if you tapped m1, and you just swiped. It would bring a lot more skill into play for her, I feel, since you would have to be a lot more precise with her blinks.
---
There is no actual banning system on co sole unless you‚Äôre caught using the exploits they have actually mentioned banns for. The Devs do not have the ability to take action against console players otherwise. I‚Äôve reported people for exploits and lag switches and have been told by Devs they can do nothing about it.
---
You should make more stuff like this, totems, maybe even gens, etc. and start selling them, you could make some good money with this! &lt;3
---
It‚Äôs PTB this stuff is probably gonna get changed. I know they probably won‚Äôt, but I don‚Äôt want to believe that this pig change is gonna last.
---
Pig will absolutely not be the worst killer because her traps never even killed anyone to begin with! Have you even played her? She is around c tier because of her ambush + ability to slow the game down which are still a thing. All these nerfs do is prevent end game pig from being as effective.
---
The nerfs ARE unnecessary but they won't change her tier at all.
---
A lot of her lategame power will be gone, which is what I feel she was best at, making lategame a bitch and basically forcing a kill, thus why she was C tier for me before.
---
The only reason I dropped her down so far was because she'll rely more on using crouch, which at Rank 1 will basically be useless for me, since everyone sees me miles away before I can reach them, then begins looping.
---
RBT's will be basically useless lategame, sure midgame they will be okay, but they have basically removed the ability to head pop someone.
---
Which is why I feel like it removes a lot of her power, with Freddy you can mindgame people hard and slugging becomes godlike with just having sight on them, and his add-ons I've found just really make this more of a concrete thing, for leatherface it's more or less the camping/basement potential that he has that would make him better than Pig.
---
Delete this, dont give them ideas
---
As far as I‚Äôm concerned legion had no other option. But Amanda, she was just a bystander. She didn‚Äôt deserve this.
---
Save our pig
---
wraith got a buff and addon's rework on spirit update
---
spirirt is top tier, same with hag
---
freddy its still sad
---
legion is better on the new ptb, altought people would say he is worst, but he is actually better
---
new maps are big
---
The old pallet model gives me PTSD
---
I'm pretty sure you can't grab a survivor out of jumping into the hatch once the end-game has started.
---
Once the Obsession is dead you can‚Äôt gain anymore stacks but you won‚Äôt lose any. The only way you lose stacks is to hit the Obsession but if they‚Äôre dead how can you lose any?
---
Xbox?
---
Why is this difficult? Because she smol?
---
ok i agree with SAB and C, but then... pig and freddy should change tiers, but ik its opinions so its fine.
---
Pigs ability is to slow the game down during the game. If you hypothetically have traps leftover in EGC, you are playing her wrong. The changes made hurt the troll/cheese builds where killers save traps to force survivors to have to run around to boxes when gens are done. That is all. Whining that you can't troll/cheese anymore is the worst killer argument I've heard to date.
---
Stay out of shock mode when you're in chases, unless you intend to actually shock in the next few seconds. It's fine to be in shock mode when you're just walking around, because this keeps your madness ticking. The moment you've shocked to your satisfaction, begin to switch into smacking mode immediately - you can often get a hit while someone is still screaming.
---
I like playing with Distressing (bigger terror radius and more blood points), Unnerving Presence (more skill checks while in terror radius), Overcharge (hard skill check the next time you kick a gen), and usually BBQ (double blood points). The last one is just for the bloodpoints and can be easily substituted for a chase perk that makes up for getting slapped with pallets.
---
He has a _lot_ of good addons that you'll want to explore. The most fun I have is with High Stimulus Electrode (+75% shock range) and Iridescent King (every single affliction), but all of his afflictions are fun. His Calm addons extend your radius in shock mode and mess around with the survivor's perception of the radius, which can screw up even experienced survivors. Discipline is hilarious, since it puts a bright red dot on the survivor that can help you during chases.
---
But really, just play around with them. Having fun with the Doctor was, for me, the key. He giggles. You should too. If you're playing him sweatily, you'd be better off on another killer.
---
Try to protect three gens that are close together, so that your terror radius continues to apply to them all. Sacrifice gens that are difficult to patrol. This is usually not terribly fun for survivors, and you will get stomped by well-coordinated groups, but you probably would have anyway. Even when you're not winning you'll still get a decent amount of blood points, often more than you'd get with a decent game on another killer. Your games will be long and you'll fill up a number of BP categories. You will get hate mail, but when don't you? You'll become better at chases by necessity.
---
To be fair, P3 does not determine skill at all. It is honestly incredibly easy to get and can be done by anyone, even those with a small amount of hours.
---
ohh and tomorow its the ptb for dedicate servers
---
Did you read the "2 seconds" part?
---
&gt;if they do then this game must have had millions of players before all those bans happened cause I get at least 2+ DCs every damn game
---
There is a threshold people need to reach to get banned for DCing. 
---
If you play 100 games a week and DC on 20, you won't get banned.
---
Im aware. Its fucking amazing and tbh is quite fair because of myers speed
---
Missed attacks will instantly eleport the Legion on hook and sacrifice them
---
Amanda wanting her traps to be inescapable doesn't mean the Entity wants them to be. The Entity makes the rules here, not Amanda, and it wants there to be at least a chance the survivors will escape. If there isn't one, the survivors won't hope, and the Entity doesn't get fed.
---
No I did not. My brain said 2 minutes. Back to bed with me
---
Pig
---
I put around 600 hours into Pig and have mained her since release, I've managed to get plenty of headpops just by abusing mechanics.
---
Most of the time they were spent at rank 1, so either the head pop happens because I keep survivors away from Jigsaw traps while still chasing others/preventing others from doing gens, or they DC before their head actually pops.
---
The Ambush doesn't really work as well as people think unless you're below rank 1, this tier list is purely based on rank 1 experience and that's about it, these changes will prevent a lot of ways I can abuse mechanics and make the killer basically F tier for me and me alone.
---
ding dong bing bong  that  opinion  is fucking wrong!!!!
---
Initial reaction: Oh, Claudette. Miss cloak into the map herself. 
---
*Actually reading the description* Wait what the fuck
---
You must be fun at parties, oh wait
---
What did they change about the ‚ÄúLeft Behind‚Äù perk?
---
I don't know if this is old news or anything but I was implementing custom icons and found this under Survivor Items. Any ideas as to what it means?
---
But that's the things dude. Playing a MOBA means usually there is a very good ranking system that resets every season not every month and it is system that puts you in games with and vs similar to you skill level players. Here we have some half ass system that they can't balance cause they cant made their mind if they want the game to be balance around the SWF or the solo players and that cause so many problems in the end. I agree if your teammate feeds  you ass off you are going to lose but in LoL you may actuallyget banned for that if its intentional while here if you die on the hook /which is very intentional feeding in DBD in my eyes/ you just continue to the next game no problem / while the rest of the team is getting fucked/
---
This has been in the game as a red herring for years.
---
"I want to play a game..."
---
   "Oh, ok Mrs. Piggy I'm boutta head out."
---
Yeah i see the resemblance. Urs is very good too!
---
And yes for sure it coming together is the best. It was fun on wraith too bc as it was partially done it looked like he was cloaked
---
Wow so this nerf really isnt that bad honestly she can still stall out your time in egc
---
I play a lot of Freddy as well, I go freddy whenever I swap from Pig, and feel like after these 2.7.0 changes, he'll be stronger than Pig at Rank 1.
---
Only personal opinions tho, take them with a grain of salt.
---
I say reduce her lunge range to a swipe (tapping m1), which would make her take a lot more skill to play, and her counterplay would be much easier since she has to be very precise with her blinks to hit you.
---
rip my opinion sry fam.
---
You know what I hate most? The fucking wink he used in the post. like he knew she would die.
---
It needs a nerf-BHVR
---
I've seen multiple people thinking that the killer's ability to open gates is counter intuitive (It's not a good tactical decision unelss you've got some kind of 9001 IQ plan behind it but it helps prevent griefing with the new system), but more common is people that think the ability to close the hatch is pointless because "a survivor can just hide near an exit gate and escape" which in my opinion completely misses the point of the end game
---
It's okay just don't let it happen again.
---
4 tokens is nothing. You can get them by unhooking others and *tanking hits* for other people (specifically when they're getting carried). You have to put in a little bit of work for those 4 tokens, just like the killer has to chase and down each individual survivor on the map.
---
he was nerfed waaaaaaay too hard.
---
Already? Awesome news thx man
---
To clarify about the end game thing: I'm saying that at some point survivors being put in an "unwinnable situation" is fair. I agree with the hatch existing and even opening no matter how many gens. I think NOED is a tad ridiculous and that tunneling an unhook is a bit unfair.
---
But all that being said, if you get caught with a trap on your head with 20 seconds left on the collapse...I mean, I don't see anything wrong or OP about that situation. Yes, you are almost certainly dead no matter what you do. But I think it's fair that the killer can have some situations using their power and other forms of pressure to cause this.
---
So by saying "survivors have to have a way to escape" is old, I mean that a lot of people (not necessarily you) think that no matter how "low" a survivor falls, there *always* needs to be a mechanic to let them save and escape. Idk if I'm being clear tbh, it's kind of hard to convey what I mean. 
---
I guess look at it from the killer perspective when you lose. Survivors within a certain distance of an open exit gate and you have no insta-downs, you are done. Period. There is nothing most killers can do at that point. And that's fair, the survivors won and shouldn't have their effort undone by some kind of "second chance" which is why I dislike NOED even as a killer main.
---
Survivors get the hatch since they can't control their teammates and are more reliant on others but I think it's fair in return to say "well, I am dead no matter what I do" in some situations, especially at the very end. And I think the Pig's old traps fall under that category.
---
Having said all of that: I can probably get over the end game nerf. I was never a big fan of end game builds, I prefer to win by not letting them finish gens in the first place and forcing a hatch escape. But it's the Terror Radius nerf that is so...blatantly obnoxious. It's the change that made me go "wtf are you thinking?".
---
Anyways, thanks for hearing me out, lol.
---
Thing is, if pig can actually manage to down and trap all 4 survivors, then flip the gate before even one of them disables their rbt, I'd say she deserves the crunch time. That takes a lot of hustle. Otherwise the rbt loses their bite completely.
---
Why is Legion in the same tier as Spirit? Is he getting a buff or something? (Haven‚Äôt read the patch notes since I can‚Äôt find them)
---
The changes give legion normal killer speed, removes the ability to remove Deep Wound meter without Frank's Mix Tape, most add-ons got shifted or completely reworked.
---
Missing once with your stab while sprinting will turn it off, can't use power unless you have full meter now, slower vaulting speeds for both pallets/windows.
---
They buffed the duration for sprinting by quite a bit, and made buffs to a bunch of add-ons to compensate.
---
and also made it so terror radius/mending pauses the deep wound meter now.
---
The add-ons are really why Legion will be stronger, so I'm mostly talking about a fully geared Legion at Rank 1 for why he's B-Tier, as well as normal killer speed now.
---
There is definitely an issue with involuntary DC's right now though. I keep getting disconnected from host a whole lot. It shows me the killer DC'ed, while my friends are still in the game and see me as having DC'ed. When playing as killer, I have had all 4 survivors DC several times, all at the same time, which I'm pretty sure they did not do on purpose.
---
Between the two totems? None :/
---
I HATE this post. not because it is bad, but because I love Saw and now I have to watch my favourite thing be used to kill my second favourite thing. Great post tho.
---
There isn't a better tag, and it has to be tagged
---
good point she should be FFF- tier.
---
That's my point. You're completely ignoring why those two are the top picks for high-ranked play. In order to change it without nerfing those killers, you'd need to look at what inspires people to pick them at high ranks: good loopers and gens that pop too fast.
---
Have you even played against legion? He's fine now. He was just BS to go against before, but his power is now fair.
---
Dude have you seen BHVR's track record? They have no fucking clue on how to balance. They nerfed Freddy, and now he's been dead for over a year, they're nerfing Legion into Trapper with no Traps, and they're destroying the most viable use for RBTs. How in the fuck is that "balancing"?
---
Get off your high horse. You don't know what you're talking about
---
Christ man it‚Äôs a TEST BUILD. You‚Äôre not even giving them a chance
---
everyone would disconnect against doc if nurse calling would still work on snap out.
---
I live this idea for freddy. Like Laury could like have michael come up from behind her and gut her. Or Tapps throat just slashes ooen and he bleeds out on the ground. Quentin gets the current mori for obvious reasons.Jane drowns above water. Ash just gets overun by the everything he has won against. There is si much there.
---
You don't play much piggy do you? The dash is useless. Her strongest ability is traps for making players do anything but gens, and her 0 TR while crouched. 
---
I can easily say that I have played more games with her than not, where I never used her ambush once.
---
If we do that without addressing the gap between solo and SWF, we will almost certainly hurt SWF.
---
True. But it's still a pretty intimidating thing, at least for me (not really used to play multiplayer games). Same goes when I'm a lobby with players who played hundred of hours
---
&gt; The only thing that bugs me about the hatch is the massive gates buff for survivors that is coming along with it
---
That's fair, though in my opinion it's so much better than the hatch standoff, which I don't think is much fun for either party.
---
Generally I think killers will adapt well to this new system well and maybe even resort to slugging less in the late game to avoid situations with the hatch. It won't make killing the last survivor too much easier and will generally improve the quality of games for both sides.
---
Survivor: Its free real estate
---
rage quitting is a reportable offense though, apparently
---
Nobody said anything about ignoring the gap. And SWF deserves to be hurt. We need to give ideas as to how to buff killers against SWF as well, and not ignore that part.
---
Its super niche, eiter last person gets hooked and you are already working on the last get and have the killer have to find the hatch/guard both doors. 
---
Or once hatch is open, killer is camping it with NOED, so you are forced to finish the gens.
---
But yeah still garbage, hell it could be 200% faster it would still be garbag imo.
---
this + traps are beeping if they are active, so hiding in the terror radius is not really an option.
---
Ehh, I feel like if they weren't supposed to kill survivors that the mechanic should have been removed entirely instead, because of the sheer fact that from my experience I could get a head pop once every 1 in 3 games, and have managed to abuse the mechanic heavily to enforce my power over a game.
---
One death changes things, and if you manage to pop someone that hasn't even been hooked once, the game is basically a loss for survivors, that's how heavily it affected my games at rank 1.
---
Nerfing it also just in general removes most fear/the point of SAW, especially if they want to stay accurate to the films and try to make the trap actually mean something for the killer. Yes Pig is amazing at pressuring survivors and controlling the game, but the issue is that she becomes another trapper or wraith without any fear for dying to a RBT, for me.
---
There are thousands of ways to play pig, but in my personal way of playing, it will make the Pig the worst killer for me.
---
Why is everyone busting a nut over these deep-fried perks? They don't look that good.
---
Don't worry man, the Derank Victims Anonymous group is here to help you.
---
I do the exact same thing lol I'm getting that gen done and you can't stop me nerd
---
I DON'T GET WHY PEOPLE ARE FUCKING COMPLANING ABOUT PIG NERFS, I GET THE PART WHERE THE TIMER ISNT TICKING DOWN BUT THE FACT THAT INACTIVE BEAR TRAPS CANNOT TRIGGER AT EXIT GATES IS PERFECTLY BALANCED, WHY ARE PEOPLE COMPLAINING? IF IT WASN'T CHANGED PIG WOULD BE OP AT END GAME COLLAPSE WITH THE RULES SET.
---
Tbh just the fact that they buffed his base speed is already good news. In the past he was useless because of the base speed and the inefficiency of his special power (in terms of downing/hooking people).
---
Pallet loop central. His power only works on noobs. He's too slow with his power, one hit and his power goes away. He's just like freddy now. I wouldn't call that fair, it's one sided. It's BS that the dev's keep breaking the game.
---
Then don't miss the skill check Kappa 4Head :D
---
&gt; IVE NEVER PLAYED AGAINST A PIG THAT STILL HAD RBT'S TO PLACE AFTER ALL GENS ARE DONE.
---
SOMETIMES I'LL SAVE JUST ONE. IN THE ENDGAME, SLUG AND RBT SOMEONE AND THEN WHACK THE FLASHLIGHTING CLAUDETTE WHO THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO HOOK HER FRIEND. NOW YOU HAVE ONE WHO CAN'T LEAVE AND ANOTHER IN A CHASE.
---
WITH THESE CHANGES THERE IS LITTLE REASON TO NOT SIMPLY FACECAMP. WE LOST AN OPTION AND PIG ENDGAME HAS BECOME MORE STANDARD AND BORING. THE HOOKED SURVIVOR, WHO PREVIOUSLY WOULD HAVE HAD A CHANCE AT BEING HEALED AND REMOVING THE HAT, WILL NOW JUST SIT AND STARE.
---
"Yes, hello?" "Ribbit."
---
in the midst of being slaughtered, legion pointed at the pig and they sprint bursted at her
---
RIP amanda, you will be missed greatly
---
I don't think there's really anything to even adapt to. It's not a significant change at all. Maybe getting used to reading scratch marks on the new ground markings
---
Why should they? When the gates are powered the game is essentially over. It's the survivors game to lose at that point, the balance of power has shifted significantly in their favor.
---
In order to start the collapse, don‚Äôt you have to close the Hatch? The patch notes said that the Hatch interrupt has been removed, meaning that there is no more Hatch grabs. If you‚Äôre chasing a Survivor and both of you find the Hatch, it‚Äôs a guaranteed free escape for the Survivor.
---
what game is this meme from?
---
Dude, you really gotta stop trying to spread this lie that a 3 minute timer that is nerfing 3 killer perks, buffing survivors 3 times, destroying the best use of one killer's power, and *ONLY* giving the killer the ability to close the hatch is an overall plus for killers. Nobody is buying it
---
SHAME ON YOU, IT‚ÄôS PIG. NO LOWER CASE CRAP ALLOWED.
---
I question what you mean by enforce. SWF will still use Discord, that's a given. But it's disingenuous to go and say that no one would use internal voice chat with there not even being a PTB with it as a function. No one is saying to enforce players to not use Discord kr other 3rd party communication apps, so I don't know what you're talking about.
---
I‚Äôll do you one better: there needs to be something that rewards selfish play. In F13, you can absolutely drive that four seater car out all by yourself and you get the same number of points as if it‚Äôs full. Get those hits and stuns on Jason: it doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre just pushing him to rage faster, they‚Äôre likely the only points you‚Äôre going to get. But DBD constantly rewards altruism. You get points for saving your teammates and a point multiplier if you have the right perk. You get a bonus if everyone escapes. ‚ÄúScrew you, I got mine,‚Äù isn‚Äôt even a feasible play style. 
---
Although, with these new changes to the hatch I can absolutely see more selfish play becoming viable. Do just enough to pip up then hunker down and wait for the rest of your team to die. The only problem is that I can also see forty minute matches where the last two players are just creeping around the map waiting for the other person to die.
---
yeah the base speed is the hugest thing really, being able to get a free injury on someone then move at them at Trapper speed just makes it really easy to abuse survivors, especially if you throw on Sloppy Butcher, cause they already have to mend after you're done chasing them, so adding that on just wastes so much time.
---
Close the hatch or survivors finish the gens and open the door. I think you only can't interrupt a hatch grab after the EGC has started.
---
That‚Äôs my next project for sure.
---
I like how everyone all of a sudden is butthurt about the fact that Legion got nerfed, even though you people were crying everyday for him to be nerfed
---
This is bait.   
---
ALSO THE CRAPPER IS OBVIOUSLY IN NEED OF A NERF
---
Credit to someone on &gt;!another website!&lt; for recreating these from screenshots.
---
THIS LINK DOESN'T WORK.
---
It's best to just hope for the best with them! P3's often are in a group and get cocky (Note, not all, but a lot of them do) and you can easily exploit that, or play in a way you can form a plan to get around. Plus in general either way you'll get BP and experience with the game. Get them by the throat and you'll have 'em on hooks in no time. Good luck out there!
---
I'm still new to the game so it's common when I play killer for the gates to get powered. Something like 80% of those games both gates will be open and whatever survivors are left will be in the gate area waiting for me to come see them. They'll sit there for minutes just to act like shits.
---
I TRY TO PARTITION MY TRAPS SO EACH SURVIVOR GETS AT LEAST ONE. IF I BRING AN EXTRA TRAP IT IS EXPLICITLY FOR ENDGAME TO KEEP THAT SURVIVOR IN THE TRIAL.
---
Thank y'all for looking out for us ;w;
---
I CLICK ON IT AND IT LOADS A NEW TAB WITH A PAGE NOT FOUND ERROR.
---
I like that idea but I also was thinking (copy paste from another post on this) If they are really gonna do this they need to rework the RnG for the pig traps or add more boxes to make them actually a threat during the time before the gens are finished. RBTs were only good in the end game for higher ranks (other than memeing around) if they take that away they need to be better for earlier in the game.
---
I'd be happy to see either change, I think this current change was the easiest/quickest for them.
---
So you made a mistake by putting SWF when you meant to put solo. That makes more sense. 
---
We shouldn't ignore killers going against SWF by focusing on just the solo vs SWF discrepancy.
---
That's rough lol
---
For me they always run to my gen with ruin up fuck up the skill check run and then go down about 15 seconds later. Gotta love dbd
---
Hahah I love how he turns around like ‚Äúyeah ?‚Äù
---
Omfg dude so right, occasionally some trapper but no other killer is being played
---
Remember me when this post comes to the front page
---
It was for the teacher killer but was never added to the game
---
it won‚Äôt :( but okay
---
I'd call it a nerf. So many unnecessary changes were tacked on like a longer recharge time, longer cooldown, and slower vault speed. Even if they wanted to take Legion in the "quickly injure everyone and then chase them normally" route this many nerfs to their power is completely unjustified.
---
There are so many things that were tied to the moonwalk exploit that they didn't need to remove after moonwalking was removed. Why can't Legion see Blood in Feral Frenzy? Why does one missed attack instantly end an ability with a 20 second cool-down?
---
Thanks! Even playing as a survivor it does feel a bit weird falling into a lobby full of people who played so many hours. I just gotta get used to that. It's like being in a room full of Schwarzeneggers and just being Steve Buscemi
---
DbD: The Boardgame
---
HAS ANYONE PLAYED PIG A BIT ON THE PTB? I'M CURIOUS HOW SHE HANDLES BECAUSE THOSE CHANGES TO HER LOOK LIKE A DECENT NERF.
---
MOBILE LUL
---
What map pressure? The timer stops in TR. Survivors literally don't give a fuck about RBTs, especially in smaller maps, like her own goddamn map. And don't say she should be crouching around, because she has 92% MS when crouched. That's a guaranteed way to lose all map pressure.
---
These are straight up nerfs, and foh calling RBTs a crutch. If they're a crutch then why is Amanda still only mid tier
---
It's actually fun to play against a pig and not that hard! Why crush the killer with this nerf
---
Timers do not count down on active traps while in Pig TR, but Pig can also eliminate TR by crouching right? So the pig traps someone and then stalks them.
---
This patch looks a lot like the devs trying to make the power more viable/necessary to success rather than just letting pig be an M1 type of killer. I don't think she was that way before anyhow, but the changes seem to imply the direction devs want to go with Pig.
---
Inactive traps not triggering is a dubious choice. Would rather see the EGC timer slow down with a trapped survivor, like a dying or hooked survivor.
---
Well i think its a good maimai you got my updog
---
Console Nurse here. Don't do that. That is all.
---
They won‚Äôt stop playing, but they may be less inclined to buy cosmetics for weak killers/killer DLC and just stick with what they have. Maybe I‚Äôm just speaking for myself, but I haven‚Äôt paid a cent after buying Legion, even though I think the cosmetics look cool I‚Äôll never buy them because I rarely play as Legion now.
---
i personally think the main music is the best because it fits the violence
---
wHaTs uP dOg??
---
This is a stupid argument, there wouldn‚Äôt be survivors without killers, and vice versa. They do what‚Äôs best for the health of the game, they may not always be 100% right, but everything they do is for a reason.  It‚Äôs not to piss off/ or please a certain side.  Wtf is a main anyway, if you don‚Äôt play both sides, you‚Äôre selling yourself short on the game.

YEAH BECAUSE YOU'RE BROWSING ON SOMETHING THAT ISN'T COMPATIBLE WITH REDDIT CSS LOL
---
PUH
---
Hmm nice simplified description of the things only negatively affecting the killer. Get the fuck outa here with your biased logic. Read the notes again.
---
People will 'buy' what they want in this discussion. I am speaking what i believe is factually correct. I don't need to state 'Nobody is buying it' to try and convince anyone of that. Sure the current circlejerk is 'HURDUR I LIKE PLAYING PIG AND NOW SHE WORSE' - but if you can't see the real reason for the change then I truly am amazed.
---
It is nerfinf killer perks as well as survivor perks - it is changing the end game - in no favour to either killer or survivor. It is introducing very and things for survivor gameplay.
---
Again... It is changing the end game. The whole of it. It had to change for the benefit of the killer not being held hostage. Maybe you don't see it as an overall buff for the killer - that is fine. But it is a fix in favour of the killer that had to happen - as it is one of the biggest problems in this game. Sure they are going to put tweaks in that make sure it balances and is neither a big nerf of buff to either side. 
---
But the whole purpose is to stop killers getting abused, survivors holding games hostage, and killers being pinned to trap doors. It overall will give more control to the end game phase for killers   (by shaking up a lot of gameplay we are used to). Currently the killer barely has any map control late game. You see many killers practically giving up when the gates are opened. It will literally sacrifice survivors on the spot if they take too long, or if they try to abuse the killer.
---
I'm trying to explain this objectively - but this incessant "the pig is nerfed, they want to nerf the pig, they are killing the game, why god why, lets shout as loud as possible" makes it sound like I am just supporting pig nerfs, which isn''t the case. I want the pig to be as fearsome as possible. But it seems very few are capable of using their brains to ask why the changes are happening, without instantly reacting to the things directly affecting them...
---
I reread and didn't find the place where you were talking about SWF instead of solo, just found a typo. In the end what I want is for killers to be balanced to the swf level, and giving survivors comms brings them very close. Then, we can open the platfom to balancing and buffing killers to where they need to be.
---
God it would of been a different story had she had noed.
---
I would love to wear that gas mask, as he bent me over a generator and had his daddy way with me.
---
I do like this concept, but there is no way they would add a negative scoring action, and I think calling it "coward" is a bit harsh, lol. Aside from this, the griefing possibilities would be too immense, as survivors would almost get to play executioner with one another. I do wish RTBs were better at actually slowing the game down, but I think this is too drastic, and the control of whether someone dies to an RTB should ultimately be in their hands, not the other players. Also, as a counter point to how it wouldn't be that bad because people can already get farmed and tunneled, just because there's already bad mechanics in the game doesn't mean they should add more, they should instead be working to add better mechanics in the future and fix the old ones (although this is BHVR, so that is unlikely).
---
You lose the game if you do that with pig. Her timer is 2+ minutes and you apply zero pressure while doing so. Legion was a guaranteed down and he could use it On anyone he chases, while pig has to at least catch one person first.

"We will almost certainly hurt SWF"

wtf lmao
---
I mean, I literally just told you their name.
---
Bruh... Have you actually seen the patch notes? RBT timers *NEVER* count down on the smaller maps. Pig can't live in crouch because she moves at 92%, but if she's up and walking around, the RBTs are no threat to anyone. They provide 0 pressure now.
---
Stop blindly praising BHVR. You're wrong. Admit it
---
"it looks quite similar"
---
it [ **does** ]look similar **doesn't** it?
---
Does the game seem a Little bit different than it did in 2016?
---
now my post has 0 upvotes, epic man
---
Crouching removes TR, doesn't it?
---
Crap list
---
Leatherface and Wraith bottom tier?  You lost me right there.

Ez dc
---
Legion mains after the nerf be like
---
legion mans are triggered lmao
---
Not using it to get to gens is a waste of time. I'd rather use up sprint burst than potentially waste more than 40 seconds walking to a gen. But each to their own I guess.
---
Convinced this entire thing is a joke/troll list to make us all laugh and smile after the terrible Pig changes.Thank you, OP. Mission accomplished! I laughed!
---
Dude "doesn't" it's just a contraction, Just like (Its)(Can't)(wont)(isn't)(haven't) ecc.

Cool

Oof I was reading the wrong message. .-.

Toxic? she seems nice. However, I don‚Äôt watch streamers often at all other than Noob3

Not Trap Daddy Maximus!

This is great but I just can't unsee this one when I look at this Clown cosmetic:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bgpkar/leaked\_images\_of\_in\_game\_models\_of\_pulcinella/](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bgpkar/leaked_images_of_in_game_models_of_pulcinella/)
---
Now they cant exploit the game and abuse chase mechanics anymore Reeee
---
Myers, Hag, Spirit
---
And why exactly do you think they're necessary? Obviously when pretty much everyone else other than you thinks they're stupid there's gotta be a good reason, right?
---
A main is exactly that - something someone primarily plays as. I play killer more than I play survivor but I do play both. I never said I only played one side. 
---
Did I ever say killers would stop playing? No I didn‚Äôt say that either. You implied that I did with your first sentence though, unless I misunderstand. 
---
I don‚Äôt think BHVR‚Äôs intent is to piss off killers, but to please survivors because they likely get more money from survivors, for the aforementioned reasons.
---
HEAD ON APPLY DIRECTLY TO 4HEAD
---
HEAR THE TERROR RADIUS SO I SPRINT INTO A LOCKER, MAKING A LOUD NOISE. KILLER GOES TO THE LOCKER (OBVIOUSLY) AND I JUMP OUT, **SEE THE FUCKING STUN ANIMATION** [**AND STILL SOMEHOW GET GRABBED?!**](/intensifies)
---
100/100 WOULD BUG TEST THE GAME AGAIN. FIX FUCKING HEAD ON INSTEAD OF BRINGING AMANDA INTO A BACK ALLEY AND SHOOTING HER. JESUS FUCKING CHRIST THE PERK HAS SO MUCH POTENTIAL TO BE AMAZING BUT IT'S SO FUCKING BUGGY RIGHT NOW AND YOU ASSHOLES HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT IN FAVOR OF NERFING WEAK KILLERS JUST FOR THE GIGGLES.
---
P.S. RUNNING OBJECT OF OBESSION MAKES ME WANT TO DIE INSIDE BECAUSE I GET TO WATCH MY ALLIES COMPLETELY IGNORE THE HOOK WHILE THE KILLER SCRATCHES THEIR ASS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE MAP.
---
I already got your account suspended on twitter man, quit bothering me
---
Do you realize how many people would be complaining if they kept her as is with the new end game collapse? She would be too OP.
---
The gas mask is worn to deal with Meghan's toxicity, along with an executioner's axe to sweep her legs out from under her.
---
&gt;In all my games in PTB, I‚Äôve seen ONE pig. Period.
---
Probably because of the unfair nerf that we were discussing you chose to ignore. Atleast new Legion is quite enjoyable but Pig just sucks now.
---
I don't want to say it's true but... judging by how fast they nerfed Freddy when people went "waaan nerf Freddy" and how heavily they nerfed Legion after all the "waaan nerf Legion" posts...
---
Yeah you're probably right.
---
She‚Äôs not. People right now are just exaggerating the nerfs that they made to her. Now I don‚Äôt agree with the nerfs at all but I think some folks are just trying to fit into the circlejerk.
---
Last I checked EW3 doesn't force survivors to run to boxes to take off a hat before they are allowed to exit the gate so I fail to see the comparison you are making. Saving traps for end game pig is a cheese strat no matter how you try to spin it.
---
Remember when I got downvoted to oblivion for suggesting end game collapse wouldn't be that great?
---
Yep.
---
&gt;It should still pop on the exit gate
---
But the killer can close the hatch now
---
Your argument is weak.
---
A ha! Not laughing now uh ? you moonwalkers bastards
---
The taste of a Survivor
---
*Trap Daddy Maximus Intensifies*
---
I also saw a suggestion to just make it 100% guaranteed you'll get the trap off in any jigsaw box during the EGC. You still can't leave with the trap and its still ticking down, slowing down your escape overall allowing for Peppa to capitalize on it, but you won't enter an impossible to survive scenario.
---
I mean it was a long time ago so nobody will be particularly upset, when I said old I mean like a whole year ago...
---
Camping is OP I don't care if Decisive Strike and Borrowed Time exist I just want to be angry and demand nerfs.
---
You'll be surprised what lengths people would go through in order to get an edge.
---
sounds really good i like this idea
---
Well there's your problem, don't put a trap on in Endgame
---
Part of me is laughing but [the other part is screaming.](https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/43561/trapper-is-still-garbage)
---
I'm on my phone now so not bothering. Read my past comments if you want my argument.
---
&gt; AN ENTIRE STRAT ASSOCIATED WITH HER
---
AND SO MUCH FLAVOR. AMANDA'S ENTIRE THING IS THAT SHE LETS YOU THINK THERE ARE RULES, AND YOU PLAY ALONG, AND IN DOING SO YOU THINK YOU'VE SAVED YOURSELF. BUT IT TURNS OUT SHE ISN'T INTERESTED IN REWARDING OR INSTRUCTING YOU AND IT'S GOING TO BE A LAST-SECOND SCRAMBLE FOR SURVIVAL PRECISELY WHEN YOU THOUGHT YOU WERE FREE.
---
MAKING HER NICER IN THE ENDGAME IS AKIN TO REPLACING LEGION'S TAPES WITH FOOTBALLS AND POMPOMS.
---
&gt;Toxic? she seems nice.
---
Lmao. Jendenise is scum .
---
I don't think Chat is a good idea, no, I just want more ways survivor can communicate some sort of strategy to other people. I said 'tools'. Like pinging systems, gestures, perks like after-care (but not actually shitty that resets on hook for """balance""" reasons).
---
Making Kindred actually linger and have more usage than just being on hook for example is a nice start. How about if the killer is chasing you, it highlights your aura and the killer?
---
Stuff like that. I don't want chat, I don't want VC. I just want more tools to communicate so that we can buff the killer in ALL ranges.
---
Besides, at the moment, good survivors don't need much communication, let's be honest. The meta has always been "rush gens". If some guy is being chased, everyone will do gens, even if they hear terror radius. If someone is injured, obsession, they'll know they're being chased.
---
Chat is not the solution, but adding separate queues will add different problems. Even if you do somehow buff the killers, there will always be dwindling playerbase. Also, what about people who queue 3 man? What'll happen to the last 'player'?
---
You should buy Micheal and watch the reaction then.
---
Trapper disliked that
---
Will you make me one? Haha, Love it!
---
&gt; Since I'm not against the nerf, you guys know the drill, downvotes to the left
---
oh shut up
---
I can't believe people are still bitching about the Legion changes. Do you REALLY think the other way was better for the game?
---
BHVR: *Nerfs every Killer but Billy and Nurse.*
---
Also BHVR: *Wonders why the only Killers played at high ranks are Billy and Nurse.*
---
I know that. I'm just saying they're not because the ranking is bonkers
---
Wow you beat some total noobs. Impressive.
---
Makes me think of my bloody valentine
---
Yup! Made it during my art classüòÜ
---
Found the guy who dc's on the first down
---
I haven‚Äôt ignored shit, kid. People are bitching about pig without actually trying her. 
---
RBT is a time waster ability, we all know that. You deal with it, or you die. Now they‚Äôre just giving survivors more time to deal with it. Exiting chase means you don‚Äôt have to immediately reveal yourself by going to the nearest Box where you‚Äôll clearly be seen. And in case you forgot, pig can tone her TR down to ZERO, which is a counter to the change.
---
Sorry but to me I looks like he hit the tree first, then landed the hit on the Survivor. This personally happens to me a lot too.
---
Shame on me for using my power
---
The only thing that Legion needed was a removal of their exploits. Without the Moonwalk exploit they'd still be unfun to play against but would at least be weak and would still be fun to play as. While they removed the "uncounterability" of their power it also came with a ton of completely unnecessary nerfs that were only related to how Feral Frenzy used to work. (Why does missing an attack end FF? Why can't you see Blood during FF? Why do you vault in slow motion now?)
---
When a gen is completed, the RBT becomes active. Therefore, if you wait to put a RBT on until after all gens are done, they can leave through the gate. If the trap is on BEFORE the last gen pops, it will be active and they cannot leave through the gate.
---
Naw he like slices the survivors back a few times. It's pretty lame
---
I have, ridiculous weak. You strawman and ignore everyone's point, then insult them like you know what's best and everyone else is wrong.
---
I really can't see myself playing if they require Australian players to use servers outside of Australia. I doubt they'll give Oceania a server, but at least let us keep the P2P system.
---
So lucky that i never go against nurse. Same with clown. Fucking terrifying i hate clowns.
---
I AGREE EGC TIMER SHOULD STOP IF A SURVIVOR HAS A TRAP ON NOT JUST GIVE A SURVIVOR A FREE PASS, WHILE ALSO BEING FAIR.
---
no you are just bad at the game i hate when people like you tell me to stop using my power when playing lf or billy boi its just annoying and pathetic its how you use them. and besides good survivors can force billy boi or leatherface to use their primary weapon by pallet looping so shut your face
---
You are just fundamentally wrong...
---
Why would exit-gate killing be part of her kit if it‚Äôs not ‚Äúhow she‚Äôs meant to be played?‚Äù
---
And if someone plays a killer a certain way and gets kills that way, who are you really to tell them they‚Äôre ‚Äúwrong?‚Äù
---
For me, that's okay if you disagree. :)
---
That‚Äôs stupid as fuck
---
I personally like where legion is. Though that makes sense i only really play legion cause it‚Äôs fun for me.
---
NOPE, DESKTOP.
---
#PrayForHerOnYourKnees
---
Quit spammin your homophobic shit in 2019. Put that shit in a shoebox.
---
Legion has been buffed if anything you dumb shit
---
Thats kinda what they did. If the last gen is poped, then putting a trap on them does litteraly nothing. Your proposal would do the same thing but with 30 seconds more leway for the traps to activate.
---
PIG NEEDS TWEAKING FOR EGC , MAYBE NOT THIS HARSH BUT SHE NEEDED CHANGING REGARDLESS
---
My opinion at the moment would be:    
---
SS - Nurse (nothing changed for her, doubt it ever will)     
---
S - Spirit, Hillbilly (these two are always interchangeable)      
---
A - Huntress, Hag (all provide insane pressure. Also Hag has been buffed for EGC as long as nobody has a flash light)     
---
B - Myers, Trapper, Plague, Clown (Myers makes it shy out of A tier. Trapper has been buffed for EGC, even more so if there‚Äôs only one person left. Plague and Clown provide good pressure as well)    
---
C - Legion, Pig, Doctor (I guess this is the ‚Äúslow the game‚Äù down tier. All of these characters are interchangeable at this tier, I couldn‚Äôt really decide who was worse or not. They aren‚Äôt higher because of their slow play style)     
---
D - Wraith, Leatherface, Freddy (these three are pretty much interchangeable)
---
You get an anticlimactic scene where pig is like "wtf, I had to go through this shit and now it doesn't even work."  
---
Meanwhile dwight is like "Thanks for the hat and all..but I gotta get back to the campfire."
---
dude rip legion, I know that he need rework and potentially some nerf but not this much lol.
---
It would be hilarious if turning off the nightlight would play the kaboom effect.
---
I LIKE THE LEGIONS NEW COSMETICS BUT IM PRETTY SURE THEY CANT BE PURCHASED WITH SHARDS ALSO LEGION GOT NERFED HORRIBLY WHICH WAS NEEDED BUT MAYBE IN SMALLER DOSES RATHER THAN JUST DESTROYING THE CHARACTER IN ONE FELL SWOOP
---
Now i feel bad for dropping $10 for a new body and weapon on killer...
---
Not my fault you can't see the reasons behind the changes
---
Pig needs to be worked on for egc balance on both sides. What is happening is harsh but she cant just revert to ehat she was with the new mechanic
---
It's rare to see them I mostly go against Michaels and camping leatherfaces cause that's my luck :&gt;
---
This can be the difference between a +1 and a safety pip now.
---
I really like yours too, it's a good tier list and pretty much reflects comparitively to how I feel, I mostly decided based on min-maxing each killer at rank 1.
---
Thanks for the opinion without being a butt. &lt;3
---
He got shat on by the depip squad with huntress
---
I mean you clearly read the changes, why would you still wait to use the RBT?
---
I mean, yeah, but that's not the problem a lot of people are angry about. The biggest problem I have, since I don't play Piggy, is them shortening how long it takes to open the gates / nerfing Remember Me. I had two games in the PTB against a Hillbilly where I shouldn't have escaped, but due to the changes I was able to run out before he chainsawed me. 
---
If the EGC was just to reduce the time survivors can grief and get rid of hatch stand-offs then they shouldn't have touched these other apects of the game (i.e. Pig, Remember Me, gate timer, etc).
---
I HATE BEING AN ALTRUISTIC SURVIVOR BECAUSE PEOPLE GET EVEN MORE MAD AT YOU IF YOU DONT WANNA RISK SAVING THEM, LIKE YEAH IM ALTRUISTIC BECAUSE I WANT ALL OF US TO SURVIVE BUT IM NOT GONNA GET *MYSELF* KILLED TO SAVE YOU IF THE KILLER IS ‚ÄúSOFT CAMPING‚Äù.
---
I‚Äôm mostly up against pig. Not for long...
---
**WHERES OLD MAN MYERS**
---
No need to be a dick.
---
It actually is impossible because Claudette is so immersed 2 seconds is too long üò§üò§
---
... What?
---
Cause of the update?  Kind of sucks cause I just got her but I don't really mind about the change.
---
It's not that big of an issue for Doctor. He still has excellent tracking without perks and has more tools to choose from now.
---
Yeah killer mains have gone on strike before, and it had gotten so bad that surv mains had to play killer just to play.
---
Good one.
---
I bought legion first, before that i refused to buy dlc. Now i have 3/4 the killers, i‚Äôm buying more soon, and i‚Äôm gonna drop a ton of cash on cosmetics. Idc about survivor cosmetics, just killer.
---
As a claudette main i find this offensive.
---
True, but offensive nonetheless
---
I saw and got it ^_^
---
Yeah. A ton of people hate it so at least i‚Äôll be against more diversity. Really want to play against more trappers but never want to see another doctor.
---
DURURURURURU
---
That's a way better idea
---
the miss is what scares and now with the increase fatigue its a death sentence. Legion plays crawling on all 4s cause hes getting fucked hard. Get juked in frenzy and GG you lost the survivor.
---
I never understood how "all generators are done" equals "you're a trash killer" There is not a single person out there who can win 100% of their games; failure is a necessary part of competitive multiplayer.
---
I do think it's worth bringing up though, because for as long as I've been in this community, seemingly anyone that tries to bring up any form of discussion regarding any aspect of the game will be down voted for it if their opinion doesn't allign with the general consensus of the subreddit, it doesn't matter how they word their arguement or try to discuss things, this will happen. This is literally the opposite of why the downvote button exists, it's supposed to be used for things that don't contribute to the discussion, not to bury opinions people disagree with.
---
I wouldn't mind this except comments that get enough downvotes are hidden from obvious view, which just makes having actual discussion on this subreddit a bad time. I'm fully aware the "reddit circlejerk" exists and all, but it just sucks that you cannot have a open discussion about various Dead By Daylight topics without people going "I disagree, better downvote that comment" (Or even outright trying to hack you) and ultimately I think it makes the overall community worse as a result.
---
Feelsbadman.mp4
---
I‚Äôm a survivor main and it‚Äôs painful.
---
How adorable
---
It already was a lackluster ability,now they're making it pure shit. It isn't even fucking deadly anymore as long as you follow her and stay in TR.
---
&gt;And in case you forgot, pig can tone her TR down to ZERO, which is a counter to the change
---
Haha, no it isn't you fucking toaster. Yes she can have 0 TR, but at the cost of speed and vision. And stealth is only good at the start of the game to get a stab or grab, after that they'll be more cautious.
---
&gt;People are bitching about pig without actually trying her.
---
Excuse me, but out of my 950 hours at least 200+ were put into pig. And I was playk g A LOT of pig on PTR from when it came out(which is only one day but I didn't have work so I played at least 12 hours of pig). And I'm sure there's people who have tested pig on ptr and have more hours put into her than I do.
---
The nerf is unnecessary and stupid, you can't argue with that.
---
You would only get a trap kill in like 1/20-30 games if not more. In the 12 or so hours I haven't even gotten 1 kill and I've played a lot of games.
---
25% chance and 2:30 minutes was definitely enough to get the trap off in 9/10 situations. Most survivors who die of traps either didn't do syary doing the boxes in time or the boxes were REALLY spread out(it doesn't happen too often)
---
Your argument is pointless, and obviously there's more people who agree with that. So please "kid", shut up about things you don't know shit about.
---
Now the doctor he I have a few opinions on him but I don't think it matters anyway
---
But what I'm confused about in the end game collapse I head that a killer can open the door
---
It's like they want killers not to play.
---
Don‚Äôt give them any ideas
---
If it takes you two minutes,  you're dead from the trap, not the collapse. Don't try and pretend that it takes survivors the full two minutes everytime they are trapped  because if that were true tempered timer would get WAY more kills than it does.
---
Yeah because the devs don't know what they're doing apparently. A 3k is still a win as killer.
---
I won‚Äôt lie, i screamed the first time i got hit my him and spirit(different matches).
---
Can you just make sure that the Middle east will be connected to the European servers and not Asian servers? Thanks. (Ik that the middle east is mostly in Asia but by Asian I am referring to Western Asia.)
---
Yeah that was truly fooken beautiful
---
Nice picture
---
I would cop. Would also be a good trapper skin.
---
Then you realize she has rancor, ruin, noed,ebony mori,and 3 blinks. That‚Äôs when you know some survivors just hurt her emotional, mentally, spiritually and y‚Äôall are about to receive her rage in full force
---
MOVE YOUR ASS DUDE
---
''abused'' x'D
---
I WAS PLAYING PLAGUE AND WAS HITTING A TAPP POINT BLANK WITH CORRUPT PURGE AND IT DIDN'T DAMAGE HIM AT ALL WTF.
---
ALSO THE HATCH OPENED WHEN THERE WAS 1 GEN LEFT AND 2 ESCAPED THROUGH IT, BUT IT STAYED OPEN FOR LONGER THAN 30 SECONDS (FOR THE REST OF THE MATCH UNTIL I FOUND JAKE HIDING IN A LOCKER MINUTES LATER) AND THE SURVIVORS THAT ESCAPED WERE CARRYING MEDKITS ETC SO THEY DIDN'T HAVE A KEY? WHY DID IT OPEN??
---
Downvote because repost
---
Gonna keep going and hope they hit wraith. I want them to feel pain.
---
Yeah but (if I remember correctly) they got rid of it all when EGC occurs, this at least would allow for the trap to be viable
---
It's a good thing I don't play on pc then again I want to cause I'm stuck with matches with noed Myers and somehow I'm toxic for looping him and then get camped that's how my matches are on console
---
lmao wtf is that showing through windows of oppurtunity?
---
i have legit never gone up against a trapper
---
A good pig will still be a good pig. Helmets make survivors get off gens. Now NOED and Blood Warden are even stronger. You can play a great killer still friend :) 
---
(And make awesome pig dash noises at the same time)
---
Urban downvote
---
Looking to improve this build. I prefer a stealthlike approach, but I feel like I could add a speed boost here or there. But what would I remove? Open to trying things out!
---
&gt; pipping was easy but had dumb criteria with low thresholds
---
&gt; increase the pip thresholds while maintaining stupid criteria
---
Pretty good job so far.

true true

---
Wow. I would be embarrassed as all hell if I put 200 hours into playing her without understanding what a ‚Äútime waster ability‚Äù is. 
---
In short, the ability is only meant to kill IF YOU DON‚ÄôT WASTE TIME TO DEAL WITH IT. As in, it‚Äôs. It MEANT to secure kills, it‚Äôs meant as a distraction from of objective, the punishment for which is death, if you don‚Äôt deal with it. 
---
If you can‚Äôt understand that simple concept, you‚Äôre not worth talking to.
---
Good to hear your opinion but that has nothing to even do with the post.
---
Pretty much. 10/10 work devs.
---
Are you the artist or where'd you get these btw?
---
Can you list ways in which people who are good at killing, 3k's or 4k's nearly every game, can abuse a matchmaking system that is based on kills and based on juking abilities/flashlight saves/ pallet stuns/ body blocking/ etc?
---
What did they do? I just bought her :(
---
this change was needed because now you can actuall;y mindgame on corn maps
---
It just sucks that THIS was their fix to the super strong endgame Piggy would‚Äôve had. On this sub alone I‚Äôve so many better suggestions than this RBT gimp they decided to go with.
---
You could up the amount of boxes a bit AND/OR spawn them further apart so it‚Äôs harder to just sit next to them and camp at endgame.
---
I saw someone else suggest 100% chance of getting the trap off after endgame starts, idk if that‚Äôs enough on its own but maybe after endgame the boxes progress a bit faster as well?
---
The point is there were a lot of cool things they could‚Äôve done to rework Piggy and Legion (throwing them in there cuz rant) but instead they‚Äôre just getting ready to send them down to buns tier and worry about it later. Big disappointment. 
---
Not to mention this mythical ‚ÄúFreddy Rework‚Äù they keep bringing up which, honestly, I have no faith in at this point.
---
Nah, Wraith will get nerfed and DS, Flashlights  and,  Borrowed Time will get buffed.
---
I SUCK INCREDIBLY HARD AND I HATE MYSELF. I GOT 2 KILLER ROUNDS IN A ROW WHERE EVERYONE GOT OUT AT A RANK AS LOW AS 17. SELF DEPRECATION NOISES!
---
I didn't even think about that.....
---
Once again, I think the people who are saying "Legion is dead" are in for a rude awakening.
---
Monto just uploaded a couple games where he dominated players by running them down after getting the free hit with feral frenzy. Legion is very effective at stalling as well since players actually have to heal against them now.
---
EVERY TIME A SURVIVOR UNHOOKS OR DISCORDANCE POPS OR ANYTHING I CAN'T SEE OR HEAR SHIT AND I DON'T KNOW IT'S ACTIVE UNTIL THE GEN HAS ALREADY BEEN RUSHED FASTER THAN MY HOPES AND DREAMS TO THE MORGUE

I think it's so fucking funny that you think enough people care about your meme posts that you can post a PSA.
---
Like... jesus, you certainly think big of yourself don'tcha there bud.
---
Yep
---
I USE BACON READER
---
It's not fun when red rankers lose or have equal level competition huh? So they just go slaughter casuals day in and day out.
---
ooof, so with the new update her Reverse bear trap will only start the timer when they FINISH a generator, the timer for it stops when they are in your terror radius, and the trap won't kill them if they try to leave with it on, she has lost the ability to slow the game down in a meaningful way
---
She has kind of a blunt personality which rubs some people the wrong way. I like her but a lot of people are sensitive to the way she talks to people, and many people dislike her playstyle, but I dont think playstyle is a valid reason to personally insult her like those 2 are.
---
Make sure no Claudette, Jake, or Nea tries to steal your work. :P
---
[deleted]
---
Didn't know :/
---
&gt;It is NOT designed to make your job as Killer easier or to allow you to consistent get Entity/4 kill games
---
Ah yes, because letting Killers close the hatch after killing three survivors, limiting the last survivor to a three minute timer and only the exit gates/a key as methods of escape, is ***totally*** not designed to let Killers more consistently earn a four kill game.
---
Wait.... yes it does... huh.
---
No need to avenge legion.
---
&gt;75% buff to repair speed instead of 25% (when you are the last survivor)
---
AKA 200% better then before and prob even more useless than before lol.
---
MAYBE THEY FOUND A KEY INGAME AND THE HATCH STAYED OPEN AS JAKE WAS THE LAST SURVIVOR
---
Dont be dramatic. Plenty of fun killers to play. You have nurse, billy, dr, hag, huntress and plague to name several. I personally play Spirit. Legion was a mistake by design. Killer victim mentality is stupid considering they've been nerfing and buffing both sides for a long time now.
---
No I play Spirit and Trapper, killers who use gravity, but also a bit of cunning to outplay their survivors. I'm not gonna notice this change :p
---
How are you supposed to stall the game with an ability that only causes 12 seconds of downtime *eventually*? There's no pressure on the survivors to get deep wounds off them until the last second, especially if they're near a gen that's close, or you're chasing a survivor that's remotely close to them
---
I FLIT BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN RANK 8 AND 9 NOW BUT I'M ALWAYS GETTING MATCHED UP WITH YELLOW RANKS. SINCE THE RANKING CHANGES WERE SOLIDIFIED AND THE RESET OCCURRED I HAVE HAD ALMOST NO MATCHES AGAINST ANY OTHER RANKS. I HAVE SEEN 3 RED RANKS, 5 PURPLE RANKS AND A HANDFUL OF GREEN RANKS MIXED IN WITH A DELUGE OF YELLOW RANKS. THIS ISN'T OKAY. SOME OF THE PLAYERS ARE PERFECTLY GOOD AND JUST DON'T PLAY OFTEN ENOUGH TO GET OUT OF YELLOW, BUT THE MAJORITY ARE BABY PLAYERS. RANK DIDN'T MATTER BEFORE BUT AT LEAST NEWER PLAYERS STILL LEARNING THE GAME DIDN'T HAVE TO GET SMASHED BY EXPERIENCED PLAYERS AS OFTEN **AT ALL**
---
ALSO YELLOW RANK PLAYERS ARE BETTER SPORTS THAN HIGHER RANKS
---
How are killers constantly nerfed?
---
To be fair,
---
Sweet boy Myers is also good. What a beautiful man he is.
---
Also, yeah no, not sure why killers are getting shafted again on PTB and hopefully,  won't make it into the live game.
---
Granted, when it came to Freddy, just about all the changes they said might not make it, did make it when it came to his release.
---
PS4
---
The game needs a skill based matchmaking system. When you can purposefully de-rank/rank reset then it contradicts the whole point. Matchmaking should be based on skill, always.
---
CAMPING ASS FUCKING KILLERS!!! DONT WRITE ME AFTER A MATCH SAYING GG EASY, YOUR A DUB MY GUY THE ONLY REASON YOU GOT KILLS WAS BECAUSE YOU CAMPED LETS BE REAL!!!
---
It's 75% now. The problem is that there is no point in doin generators if the hatch spawns even with 5 gens to do and then you can open the exits if the killer closes it.
---
No need to be a cunt, but ok
---
True, but it‚Äôs just an animation, you can be happy but jeez... üòÇ
---
Nothing special, you could use no perks and no add ons, and with a general understanding of how to play killer, you should have no problems. It takes like 2 games to get used to him so just go and have fun, and use perks that help your playstyles.
---
THAT'S WHY
---
LOOK IN THE OP. I'M USING THE SECTION WHERE IT SAYS
---
&gt; IF YOU REALLY WANT TO GET YOUR RAGE ON USE
---
BUT WHATEVER BACON READER IS DOESN'T SUPPORT IT
---
huh that's odd. I see a good number of plagues. Not a lot but more than say Clown. I also play Plague a lot
---
You don't have to be big to get hacked, you just have to say the wrong thing at the wrong time. I didn't get hacked because I'm popular or that my meme posts are amazing or anything like that. I do genuinely believe I was likely hacked because someone didn't like the opinion I presented in the meme though (essentially: "If you're not actively preventing NOED, it's likely your fault when it activates")
---
Regardless, that happened was a pretty decent reminder of how important two factor (and just general security practices are). I think there's nothing wrong with reminding people that they should be taking steps in place to secure the accounts they care about
---
they also said they may have found a workaround and that is the last we heard about it
---
Now do one of Jane Romero
---
Same. Pig was one of the killers I was most interested in (after getting bubba to 35 for bbq n chili of course) but now I‚Äôve gotta play nurse I guess
---
Man I'm having as shitty day and reading this makes it a little shittier... What are the devs thinking?
---
is this a fresh ass Jojo Meme?!
---
\*vigorous applause\*
---
CORRUPT PURGE IS REALLY BUGGY
---
THEY FOUND A KEY IN GAME AND JAKE WAS THE LAST SURVIVOR SO THE HATCH REMAINED OPEN
---
I love Saw memes. Keepi t going.
---
dweet
---
I disliked NOED for a while, but all that dislike disappeared when 3 survivors can body block for someone opening an exit gate, and you have to just sit there and watch them win.
---
Nothing is better than a cocky survivor getting in your face at the end, hooking them, and trapping everyone else inside with Blood Warden.
---
I was one for a while too, don‚Äôt worry, I get it.
---
This game is only pandering to the survivors and the devs are actual ass holes, i don't even think they want people to play their game
---
AH YES I FORGOT THAT THE OTHER SURVIVOR DISCONNECTED SO I THOUGHT IT WAS STAYING OPEN WITH 2 PEOPLE LEFT. THAT MAKES SENSE (I AM A KILLER NOOB)
---
You are pretty bad at Pig then, as her Dash pretty much cancels most loops if done correctly.
---
More like trying to get tunneled then complaining build
---
&gt;I deleted my comment because I wanted to get things off my chest and have a civil conversation about these things, maybe get some actual advice to break this habit? Idk.
---
Really don't understand how you're expecting any sympathy when you are literally the scum of the game. Guess you're that entitled about it. My advice? Don't do it, that's it. Shouldn't be too hard?
---
&gt;When you responded, raging like an angry 13-year-old who didn't get a Nintendo Switch for their birthday, I saw no benefit with continuing this conversation any further. In fact, your comment only made me want to DC more.
---
Funny to hear the person who ragequits every other game talk about maturity. People like you are literally ruining my gaming experience but I should treat you with respect?! Hell no, that time's up. You stupid. Fucking. Cunt
---
&gt;I thought I mentioned how I hate myself for DCing so often and I don't do it with purpose. It sounds stupid but it's true. I don't want to ruin anyone's matches, but it's like a reflex. ALT+F4 and Enter is a pretty quick combo to press and it has become a habit. A huge problem, infact.
---
Again, 0 sympathy from me. That's your problem and you should/would get banned in every other game and you know it. You don't do it on purpose?! What kind of a shitty personality do you have? At least be honest with yourself honey. Maybe make an actual point why you DC. Oh wait, there's no justifying that
---
&gt;I simply pointed out how I wanted a better reward for escaping and a better penalty system for DCing, to prevent myself and others from DCing. The reason people DC is because they don't lose anything from it, and the reward for escaping is such a low amount of blood points it literally doesn't matter. 2 pips are worthless, and I can easily gain them back in 2 games, 1 if I'm lucky and don't end up fucking DCing again because of my stupidity.
---
Again, giga entitlement. Basically what you are saying is "I need a damn good reward not to ruin other people's fun"
---
This game is not about rank to me. And if the only other reason you play is character progression then gtfo. Maybe try playing to improve, or call me crazy, HAVE FUN?!
---
&gt;Have you never DC'd from any game (dbd or any other game), like ever, after getting tilted? Well, imagine that feeling but every time I'm in a game. Have some fucking empathy. How about you give some actual advice before jumping into occlusions and being a huge toxic cunt face about it.
---
How about no? I dc when someone already left and the game is ruined, moonwalk legion and farm games. That's it. It is not my job to come up with any advice to make you not behave like a stupid cunt. What am I, your mom? Basically super giga entitlement again, since what you are saying comes down to "it is not my job to fix my fucking horrible personality"
---
The very fact that you think you deserve any sort of empathy speaks volume to that
---
&gt;That's exactly the problem. I feel like they're worth nothing.
---
Rank means nothing in this game and you are garbage tier stupid to play for pips
---
&gt;&gt;gtfo out of my game
---
&gt;
---
&gt;Smh my head
---
RIP in pieces
---
&gt;Oh I have and constantly do. It's just, I get a huge dbd motivation every day, but it all goes a way at some point. In a blink of an eye. Then my fucking DC reflexes activate. I can't help it. I tell myself "I'm not gonna DC" before every game but I still fucking do.
---
Really? That is all you got? Don't even start the game then. Take a break for a month or two. Again. Not my job to come up with a solution and idc how you fix it. Doesn't matter if you uninstall, switch games or kill yourself. Only the result counts to me, which is not having fucks like you in my game
---
&gt;Believe me, I know. Kinda pointless having you tell me that. I've had (and still have) people DC'ing matches so I know what it feels like. It only encourages more people to do so. The devs need to do something about it. I don't wanna DC either but it's just like a reflex.
---
Big. Fucking. Oof
---
Dash is useless raq morfO
---
Don't get downed by a Pig in the endgame then?
---
Well why are you judging the add-on but it's ability to down someone? It shortens their timer, and puts more pressure on them to mend. Hit someone with a couple Frank's, then get a hit on a different survivor, and come back for the Frank's guy because they couldn't have made it far.
---
"logical"
---
not sure if I should laugh or mock this guy
---
Hasnt Monto also not ranked up yet? I remember him saying it the day before PTB. In which case I can 4k with Freddy at Rank 12 guess Freddy mains are in for a rude awakening
---
If you can drop the firecracker at the beginning of a chase, a Quick &amp; Quiet coupled with Dance with Me and Lithe would make for a perfect getaway. You‚Äôd you‚Äôd get so far away from the sprint speed boost, all while leaving no scratch marks or noise notifications.
---
The ability to totally shit on the majority of pallet loops is her main ability, yes.
---
That's fine, won't have to worry now with the changes.
---
You missed the key my guy. Gotta have the broken one though cause you don‚Äôt need the hatch /s
---
Hmmm, mostly ends in my teammates complaining tbh lol
---
Her traps don't stop survivors from leaving through the gates anymore.
---
You‚Äòre a pretty bad pig main then if you ignore the one tool that can give you hits on almost every pallet without being looped if done correctly.
---
you should get two gens done and then hide if everyone is dead if the killer is camping the hatch just complete more gens
---
Missed opportunity IMO. I never really noticed traps slowing the game down all that much. Unless you get tunneled with a trap on your head or there‚Äôs only 2 boxes, you literally run around for like a minute then you‚Äôre fine.
---
Reworking the traps instead of gimping them could have added a whole different play style for her, either slow the game down (just a little bit ;) ) and whittle survivors down or let it get to endgame and become a powerhouse.
---
Instead we have a very sad oinker
---
Don‚Äôt camp. Camping is actually bad for *you*. Firstly it detracts from your score. Secondly, if survivors are actually smart about they‚Äôll just work gens while you‚Äôre camping. Bare minimum they can get 2-3 gens in the time it takes a hooked survivor to die. 
---
Feel free to ‚Äútunnel,‚Äù though. I put that in quotations because what people call ‚Äútunneling‚Äù isn‚Äôt actually tunneling. Tunneling, in gaming vernacular, refers to overcommitting resources on a hard target. In this game, tunneling would be chasing a survivor you can‚Äôt catch for two minutes. Don‚Äôt do that. What you want to do is focus. Focusing is exploiting a soft target. If you find a survivor is really easy to catch take them out of the game ASAP. That‚Äôs one less pair of hands working gens. Especially now that the devs have made it crystal clear that Killers have no counter play in endgame.
---
Surely everyone realizes Pig as she is now wouldn't work. But everyone seems to agree the changes are too extreme.
---
hey i live under a rock
---
whats wrong with end game it looked cool
---
Legion wasn‚Äôt underpowered
---
They changed the pigs RBT in two ways.
---
1 - They made it so that if the trap is inactivated, the survivor can leave through the exit gate without the trap killing them. This means that pig players are forced to apply traps on to survivors heads before the last gen is complete for any effect to happen. It means that survivors have time to remove the trap from their head before the end game starts which removes the pigs ability to force survivors to stay in the trial.
---
This drastically impacts the pig's ability to utilise the end game collapse &amp; removes or makes end game builds on the pig a lot less viable. 
---
2 - If a survivor with an active RBT is in the pig's terror radius, the timer does not tick down. This effectively means that survivors can extend the time with the RBT by staying near the pig. Its quite strong as that can easily add an extra 30 seconds to the timer without the survivor trying making head popping near impossible now. 
---
It also removes massive terror radius builds for the pig as having a massive terror radius will make the traps a lot less lethal.
---
hey buddy... no one thinks your cool or tough drop the act.
---
Trapper's traps can now cause him to be stuck. Yes, a survivor will have to free him. He can't get out on his own.
---
The Wraith's Bell can be heard all over the map, and directionally too. To compensate for this ~~nerf~~ change, we will be remoiving the Coxcombed clapper add-on.
---
The Hillbilly's chainsaw is slightly dirtier.
---
The Nurse's breathing is slightly louder.
---
Michael Myers can no longer gain EW3 if he downs a survivor in EW3 once.
---
The Hag has a chance, during the trial on either Backwater Swamp maps, to be abducted by an entirely different set of cannibals. On any other map, Leatherface will do the honors instead.
---
Huntress' hatchets can be sabotaged via the lockers.
---
The Doctor has a chance to shock himself, revealing his position to all survivors and forcing him to scream.
---
The Cannibal no longer can use his chainsaw unless in the basement, because that's the only time it was useful anyway.
---
Freddy.
---
The Pig.
---
The Clown now has a **moderately/moderately/considerably** increased chance to have a heart attack and die during the trial**.** Increased if using Pulcinella skin, reduced if using Santa Clown.
---
The Spirit now has a chance to lose her paranormal gravity and fall apart. She must then complete a channel to put herself back together.
---
The Legion has been killed by a drug cartel ring full of Ghostface fans. May they rest in pieces.
---
The Plague has a chance to have a diarrhea attack, causing such embarrassment she will instantly DC.
---
Neither nor should, the game should introduce more mindgame-able pallets. They chose to simply delete most of them sadly
---
I'm not saying that you should only activate the perk when interacting with the killer. I'm saying that dedicating a perk slot, and an exhaustion perk at that, to reaching the next generator 2 seconds faster is wasteful.
---
You're only handicapping yourself by not using a better mobility perk.
---
Don‚Äôt use discordance then
---
Well, he was a miner. I'm actually surprised if took this long for them to give him this outfit.
---
:(
---
When you say sniping do you mean spectating and giving info?
---
&gt; SWF could see what the killer had the second they died for years.
---
This is not an argument for allowing solos to see it now
---
&gt; SWF sniping each other would not be a viable stratagy other than to tell if the killer had NOED because after a SWF would die, the game is almost half over anyways.
---
Blood Warden is the bigger issue. Or other perks like Discordance and Devour Hope where survivors may not figure it out during a trial on their own
---
&gt; Not to mention that sniping each other has got to be difficult (I havent tested it).
---
If by sniping you mean spectating to provide info, lolno it's easy af
---
Look at it this way:
---
If X person is bored of high rank gameplay, they‚Äôll just go and ruin Y person‚Äôs fun.
---
Love love love
---
Mindgames, yes. Giving the killer one free kill is a no-brainer. Actually, you should be agreeing with me here. The last kill should not be gifted to the killer.
---
No real point to this post.
---
I'm not saying it's a good perk, just that if you're using, run to a generator with it instead of saving it and walking. I personally use dead hard or BL.
---
Rank 15s are trembling everywhere because of "sarahnator6000".
---
I‚Äôm rank 1. Never deranked.
---
Boo fucking hoo
---
EVER SINCE THE PS4 SERVERS WENT DOWN LAST WEEK, I KEEP BEING DISCONNECTED FROM GAMES. THE GAME IS *LITERALLY* UNPLAYABLE BECAUSE I GET KICKED OUT OF 80% OF MY MATCHES AND I KEEP LOSING PIPS AND BLOODPOINTS. 
---
NO ONE IS TAKING THIS ISSUE SERIOUSLY BECAUSE EVERYONE IS FOCUSED ON THE FUCKING PTB. ENDGAME COLLAPSE MY ASS, MY GAMES DON'T EVEN LAST 20 SECONDS.
---
[I WANNA PLAY DURING THE BLOODHUNT SO FIX THIS SHIT !!!](/intensifies)
---
I jus got a Glass Splinter :(
---
Lery‚Äôs isn‚Äôt bad with most killers unless you get fucked over by luck.
---
I've played this game for 1500 hours, I'm pretty sure I know what good pigs do. Most don't use the dash at loops, it doesn't work on all but the smallest ones (e.g. some crates on macmillan maps), and even then, only semi-consistently. People use crouch to sneak up on people and then stand up to get grabs or free hits while her TR is gone. Even post-buff her dash is pretty meh.
---
Also you said it works at "the majority of loops," obviously you know I'm asking which spots in particular. Douche.
---
*Oinkgasm*
---
I just picked random one from already existing and then edited it
---
P.S.: everybody loves shirtless Kate
---
&gt;  This is literally the opposite of why the downvote button exists, it's supposed to be used for things that don't contribute to the discussion, not to bury opinions people disagree with.
---
Yeah but you're literally making a ridiculous 'argument' and then immediately dismissing everyone who disagrees with you as being some hivemind who can't think for themselves. Just because your opinion is unpopular doesn't make you right.
---
Well of course there needs to be balancing. I was speaking to those that complain about tunneling like it's a simple act when it's not. If you tunnel incorrectly you're going to cost yourself gens or totem cleansing or whatever else. If you do it correctly, i.e. using mind games, then you're going to get that hook/kill. Complaining about a killer tunneling is like complaining about survivors gen rushing. It's a basic part of the game that can be done correctly or incorrectly so get over it.
---
It's kind of sad when people talk about Freddy being so worthless, but everytime I face him around rank 9, we all get stomped - every time..
---
Then run dirt or a Button that gives a debuff. Seriously. Why run a nurse with anything but a watch?
---
Is this the first nerf for Pig? I stopped playing DBD shortly after the Pig came out and it was OP then so everyone was playing her. I‚Äôve played probably 30-50 matches since coming back to DBD the last few weeks and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve played a SINGLE game against the pig. I assumed she was nerfed ages ago.
---
They made left behind way better for percentages, 100% now being the level 3 perk while it used to be 25% iirc. Basically they made her traps worse. For instance the traps only tick when a gen gets done, but they made it so they won't snap if someone escapes with one if it's not activated. So all traps used after the 5th gen are useless. Also they made the requirements for the ticking harder. For instance the RBT stopped it's timer during a chase. Now it's stops if you are in the killers terror radius in general.
---
You would be surprised the shit survivors do like 360's and also console-__-
---
Verbally throwing some banter on stream is a lot different from attacking the killer though.
---
I think the power Bar depletions have always been there.
---
Oh, I didn‚Äôt even know about editing flairs
---
For real lmao
---
#_"WHO DARES DEFILE MY DOMAIN?"_
---
I see a lot with DC in their usernames also
---
It's not hard to hit 360s
---
I AM FUCKING TIRED OF HAVING TO SPEND HALF MY BLOODPOINTS ON PERKS I WILL NEVER USE, ADD-ONS I WON'T USE AND OFFERINGS I FUCKING HATE!!!
---
They‚Äôre buffing Freddy by making everyone else worse than him
---
Of course it doesn't work on the really big obstacles but most obstacles are fine.
---
I can only recommend you to watch some actually good pig streamers, biggest recommendation would be PsychoScorpionz. The way he uses the dash will make you want pig nerfs.
---
Let‚Äôs just establish why you paid money to main a killer. 
---
You want to disregard the survivor‚Äôs only two ways of escaping the killer, and run around swinging as many times as you want. 
---
That‚Äôs lame. Your killer got better and more fun to play against. Be happy over it.
---
God speed you funky little nurse main
---
&gt; immediately dismissing everyone who disagrees with you as being some hivemind who can't think for themselves
---
That's not what I'm saying, I'm saying that people use the downvote button for the opposite of its intended purpose if they disagree with the opinion, even if it's contributing to a discussion.
---
I'm curious, what parts of my argument were "ridiculous"
---
How much????
---
Whaaaaat! I love this idea! Playing killer totally helped me understand so many things! Lets make this happen!
---
best thing i have seen all day
---
You do understand that the trolls who hold you for twenty minutes are the exception and it‚Äôs far more common to get trolls who hold you their for five, right? Yeah, those assholes are going to eke out every single second of that timer and still get out just before it ends. And it‚Äôs going to feel even worse because ‚ÄúOh, you almost got them. They almost didn‚Äôt make it.‚Äù And, no, I don‚Äôt think the collapse is going to kill anyone who isn‚Äôt trying to get killed by it.
---
Dey say you, have the ear of Mcote?
---
I pray we chose our killers well.
---
Freddy has dream transition mindgames which he can actualy down with and the dream world itself can create a heavy stall.
---
I wanna boop that snoot
---
WHY DO I KEEP RUNNING INTO YOU HERE?
---
Definitely. The explosion of protest is largely because Pig was considered on the weak side already (not terrible but not strong either), and these changes are just significant nerfs with no compensation buffs.
---
Retuning her kit to be stronger in other places probably would have had mixed reception, but nowhere near this level of protest.
---
We get it, you didn't like the legion. Now will you present a good argument or keep answering like a third grader.
---
I wouldn't think about making fun of other players when your name is ''OchidoIsBestDBDPlyr''.............
---
Has it? Never played Legion enough to have known. In that case, considering things like the increased length to replenish Feral Frenzy and how it can only be used when the bar is full and how it can only be used once on each survivor it should not be now
---
Thats why i said Myers doesnt like it.
---
Sometimes, the pain was so incredible i stopped playing for a week
---
That‚Äôs true too. But most of the DCs I‚Äôve seen have looked more like rage quitting because they usually DC as soon as the killer downs them, on their death hook or it‚Äôs a killer who DCs with zero kills after the last gen is done.
---
It is complained about a lot because it is just shitty to play again. There is no chance for a killer semi-patrolling a hook to come back and just smack you once. It doesn't take skill, on most occasions there won't be a mind game either. 
---
Going for the healthy player might even be the favorable strategy as the other guy will surely heal, not wanting to go back on hook that quickly, which means you know the location and actions of 2 players already.
---
Ruin is a must on him, you gotta somehow compromise for the time you've spent on stalking, especially on the beginning. Monitor &amp; Abuse is also extremely good on him, 0 meters TR on tier 1 and only 8 meters on tier 2. If you know how to use the surroundings and landscape to your advantage you are literally a wraith that doesn't need to uncloack. Other 2 perk slots can be spared for enduring+spirit fury, since you'll be eating pallets for breakfast and nurse's calling+bbq, since NC has a bigger radius than your TR and bbq really helps to find people and get that juicy bp for high tier addons for him. You can slap on bamboozle too if you'd like to, on tier 2 and tier 3 he already vaults faster than other killers, adding bamboozle makes his tier 3 vault speed almost instantly and makes his tier 2 as fast as his tier 3 without bamboozle.
---
Isn‚Äòt this photo from No0b3‚Äòs last video?
---
I have, not often, but some will warn people about things like NoED. Rules are made because of the small percentage that needs them, not the majority.
---
It's not too hard to hit with it, I've played around with it in the ptb and it has a very large lunge range
---
&gt; destroying a pallet doesn't remove the whole bloodlust progress
---
Please no....... That's the *entire* fucking point of pallets in high levels of play.
---
Without as many true infinites, nasty amounts of pallets to bolster strong tiles, double pallets or easy saves involving flashlights, sabo being useless, and more restrictive fast vaults, killers definitely aren't as helpless as they were in the past.
---
Idk- from my experience SWF are not people looking to set out to bully killers when they are queuing purple or red ranks. They're usually just friends goofing off, showing another friend the ropes, and the game is usually very easy for the killer since most of the time the survivors are throwing themselves into altruistic plays over actually doing gens.
---
Thats why i just play killer :0
---
Did you read everything? I don't care that he got better. If I wanted better I would have played nurse. My problem is he is not fun anymore. What good do I gain from FF? Nothing. I don't want another M1 killer I have enough.
---
Thanks for the support!
---
Devs have officially stated that NOED will not be reworked and is balanced. DS was uncountable. NOED becoming a hex perk made it counter able. Totems aren't in hard to find spots.
---
OH MY GOD FUCK OFF NERD IT'S BEEN NEARLY A FUCKIN WEEK
---
I feel like PS4 is just getting really bad in general. I‚Äôm constantly being farmed off the hook and face camped. Never had a big issue with this until recently. I‚Äôm thinking about switching over to PC but I‚Äôve invested so much time and money into my PS4 account.
---
Twice the amount? 
---
Try all game long!
---
This is nothing new.  Piggies are scummy tunnellers.
---
Nurse is imbalanced, her lunge needs re-work, if you're half decent you can quickly win the game.
---
No wonder [per stats](https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bgggig/my_third_survey_the_dc_rate_against_each_killer_i/) she has highest dcs from survivors.
---
We need the same meme but for the pig, and mr  krabs smiles at the sight of pig being dead. Like honestly why her.
---
Yea especially the precentages :p
---
you are setting the premise that the killer will always find the hatch first.
---
This is not the case.
---
For me it's annoying and i only land the hit if they suck at it and if they know how to do it i land it on my second or third hit
---
A lot of people talking about Pig Nerf, I'm a pretty active but new player to Dbd. But where do I read the patch notes for this? It's not ingame in the "update blog". And the only thing that comes up when I search for the patch notes is the "two new exploit" earning. 
---
Where do I read about the pig nerd and other stuff?
---
Your fun comes from abusing the game at the expense of 4 other players. 
---
You gain a free hit and your ability to apply DW.

sounds good but i would probably replace the fireworks for a flashlight so when you blind the killer at a pallet you can get away faster
---
Aw man. You mained a killer with absolutely 0 counter play and now can‚Äôt get an EZ win. Time to become a real gamer. 3k hours on DBD, former nurse main (not anymore, because I realize she‚Äôs busted). Play something that takes skill. Try huntress, you‚Äôll actually feel accomplished and have the respect of the community.
---
Its like a teletubby
---
In most games that I played ranks 10-18, Plague won most of the time. Even bad players had it easy with that killer.
---
Confirmed Behavior is actually the Entity
---
Yes that too, it's like he wastes a ton of time on chances that may or may never land
---
IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE USING NEW REDDIT AND NOT THE NP OR OLD URL SHORTENER. REPLACE WWW WITH EITHER NP OR OLD AND YOU'LL SEE IT PROPERLY
---
.....what. You people love throwing SJW around for anything.
---
Wait bigger than before?
---
Then dog that's a personal problem that the majority of killers don't face
---
I would put tombstone piece on the really fucking good tier tbh, with memorial it doesn't take that long to reach tier 3 and it doesn't have movement speed limitation like judith's. Instantly deleting someone from the game is really strong.  When you mori someone while there are 4+ gens left game is basically over.
---
Should've, even!
---
Myers and plague
---
thanks for the downvote/no reply, OP lol
---
Use it now, updates not live yet
---
White knight spotted
---
&gt;If it takes you two minutes,  you're dead from the trap, not the collapse.
---
Not if the trap is inactive. We are talking about traps put on during end game so there's no gens to activate the trap anymore. Now, survivor has 3 minutes to evade killer while trying to do RNG boxes before he is able to leave the gate. Cheese strat no matter how you spin it.
---
I SURE HOPE DEDICATED SERVERS HELP WITH QUEUE TIMES, BECAUSE DEAR LORD AS MUCH AS I LOVE LISTENING TO THE KILLERS BREATH OVER AND OVER, I'D SURE LIKE TO ACTUALLY PLAY THE VIDEO GAME
---
I'm aware that no one cares when someone claims they stopped playing a game, but BHVR seems to have a really weird track record of making really awful changes, and letting them sit for months on end where everyone is slowly losing their shit.
---
Then they seem to make a change that actually excites the community that the balance of power won't swing wildly in favor of one side, and then a month after that they're like "JK, now players who play (insert survivor or killer) can go fuck themselves".
---
I honestly just haven't had fun with this game because they keep "fixing" things that aren't broken, like nerfing Fire Up... honestly, why the fuck did they target that perk?
---
The us vs. them mentality is fucking up this game big time. Radicals from both sides keep whining about non-issues. The devs make changes that no one asked for, but we have influenced them to make those types of decisions in the first place. You can‚Äôt understand the core issues of the game if you don‚Äôt play both killer and survivor OR you don‚Äôt have an open mind to the actual problems that the other side is experiencing.
---
I agree. The mob mentality has only gotten stronger. And it really sucks because in reality the community does not know what it wants. Apart from a proper ban system, dedicated servers, DC epidemic, what else can we find common ground for? Barely anything. And the devs see this. I‚Äôve criticized them a lot in the past but on this one I have to cut them some slack. You can‚Äôt really make proper change if the community keeps bringing out the pitchforks with every tweak.
---
I would be on my knees too (;
---
Firecracker is mostly just there for show, although I do love it haha. Using the flashlight is definitely something I need to get better at though.
---
Hey not everyone is a pro killer
---
I don't think that frenzy needs to be used up every Single time it is used. Like hit one survivor, no one around cancel and chase. H√≠t survivor and someone close, h√≠t th√™m And either find another or cancel to hit someone M1.
---
I think people are forgetting that in live without Frank's it is around five Hits (Initial plus four) to down with at least two stuns. With Frank's it is four Hits (Initial plus three) with at least two stuns.
---
Are these the perks she comissioned an artist to make?
---
You can, it just doesnt decrease the time left.
---
IT'S NOT INTENTIONAL YOU JUST HAVE A VERY RECOGNIZABLE USERNAME!
---
The Collapse does benefit killers in meaningful ways. The situation of survivors staying in the game, however rare, is absolutely atrocious. And an a lot more common occurrence are survivors standing in the exit gates or at the hatch waiting for the killer to come, only to leave at that point. Now the killer can simply go browse the web for 3 minutes and the survivors will either have left, or died. As someone who despises looking for immersed survivors, this change is very meaningful to me.
---
Closing the hatch is a direct killer buff, rewarding the killer for finding the hatch first, and getting rid of another undesirable situation that are hatch standoffs. It does power the gates, because otherwise the survivor would simply not have any chance whatsoever to survive anymore, which is not good game design. As killer in this scenario, it will usually result in you being able to spot the red lights on a gate switch from afar, and then finding the survivor around that gate, getting into a chase that guarantees the kill. Whereas in the hatch scenario currently, even if the killer finds the hatch first, the survivor can 1. go into the hatch standoff which they cannot lose, 2. do generators and power the exit gates, forcing the killer's hand, 3. hide indefinitely trying to make the killer just quit, 4. wait for the killer venturing out to try and avoid a hatch standoff/hostage situation, thus getting the hatch for free, 5. stand at the hatch waiting for the killer to approach only to then jump in.
---
I do agree that the global gate timer change is an unnecessary nerf. It should apply exclusively in those closed-hatch situations. The Remember Me nerf was also unnecessary. The Collapse itself does not require or warrant these changes however, so these nerfs are not part of the EGC, just of the patch, that BHVR for some reason thought necessary. Same for Pig's terror radius-stops-RBT-timer change.
---
Hatch spawning without 2 generators having completed is actually a good change. Again, currently in this situation, the survivor would have no chance to succeed, if the killer is patrolling generators. So what this incentivized survivors to do, is hiding indefinitely, trying to make the killer give up, either quitting or stopping to patrol generators. With this change however, the survivor still has a chance to survive, yet the killer has the ability to actually be proactive, finding and closing the hatch. Besides, if you do want to avoid this scenario as killer, you can do so just as well as you always could have, by slugging for the 4K. Furthermore, complaining about a "killer nerf" in a situation where you just wiped the floor with a group of survivors so hard they were not even able to complete two generators is an a little... let's say privileged level of complaining. And again, if you are that hungry for the annihilation, just slug the second-to-last remaining survivor.
---
Opening the gate yourself is not strictly limited to situations where you concede the game having lost. For one thing, it is a necessity to prevent the aforementioned obnoxious game situations of holding the game hostage, since survivors could just 99% the gates. For another, it gives the killer the ability to initiate the Collapse timer, which can work in conjunction for instance with already-active RBTs. It can also be used to force Blood Warden. And it just gives killers the ability to make sure the game is over at a certain point, which can be beneficial if you are just tired of the round, or the game, and just want it to end.
---
I'm not sure that prolonging the Collapse timer on downs and hooks is something working against killers, in and of itself. If the timer was more restrictive, it would only make survivors play unaltruistically in the end game. *A lot* of kills happen because in the end game, survivors try to make saves happen. And this is not a bad gameplay aspect either, it's pretty fun and intense for both sides - certainly a lot more so than simply catching one survivor with the rest instantly leaving.
---
The Collapse is a welcome QoL change as far as I am concerned, though there are some unnecessary other changes in this patch that come with it. RBTs should work just like they always have, the Collapse timer should simply slow down if any survivor has an RBT on. RBTs should only stop working if the Pig closes the hatch. They should also keep ticking in terror radius, sure. The Remember Me nerf should just be scrapped entirely. Opening gates should still take 20 seconds - perhaps unless the killer closes the hatch.
---
Congrats on having more hours than me. It means nothing. Does nobody bother to read everything? If I wanted an EZ win I would have played nurse or billy. I played legion because he was fun and now that fun is gone. I couldn't give a flying shit about the respect of a community that I doubt even deserves it most of the time. pLay sOmehtTing ThAT tAkes Skill my ass. I have billy for that.
---
As someone who played in usual ranking games, I can assure you that killer players win almost all the time, like if we take the minimum of 2 survivors getting killed, the rest escaping, and at max everyone escaping, then that range accounts for at least 90% of games. Yes, I'm not joking. This is how it is, it's way unbalanced for average players.
---
Survivors suffer greatly from having strangers play with each other with poor coordination. Whereas killer doesn't have this issue as he plays alone.
---
Found the guy that got tunneled once out of 10 pigs and can't let it go.
---
I disagree. I think if they do troll then it be a lot easier for the killer to secure the sacrifice by zoning them.
---
Who hurt you, Nurse? *Who hurt you?*
---
Why would they follow you? 
---
You can see that their beartraps aren't ticking when they are in your terror radius, so it's built in whispers. 
---
The most optimal way to play survivor is spread around the map and work on generators that are far away from each other, so that the killer has to waste a lot of time moving around the map and only pressuring 1/2 survivors.
---
Actively following the killer goes against that, that survivor is wasting their and their team's time.
---
shhhh people arent supposed to remember that
---
How am I abusing the game? I don't moonwalk, I don't use franks, I chain my attacks instead of tunneling one person. I'm playing as the devs intended. That's like saying you are abusing the game by looping.
---
Fair point. I brought up the fragmented community causing more issues during the conversation actually haha.
---
OH
---
SORRY
---
People camp and tunnel anyway even with top tier killers. Nerfing or buffing killers are not going to change people‚Äôs playstyles
---
I HATE HOW GOOD THE GAME IS OPTIMIZED ON PC COMPARED TO CONSOLE.
---
I'm fairly certain its controversial because it's illegal fam
---
I‚Äôm on PC and I DC every two games or so. Not on my own, but because the game is bugging out. I hope I‚Äôm not getting reported bc of game bugs.
---
i dont know if you play on console bc if you do thats the reason no one play nurse and pls just try nurse play her for a day with the same add ons or no add ons at all. i will confidently say you will win 90-95% of your nurse games after that day of only nurse
---
Yea this was way over tuned but of course the survivor mains are satisfied.
---
perhaps better but is not fun?  haha yeah more like because he was busted, especially with addons.  At least they didnt delete him/her like most people wanted.  I still want refund
---
when does end game collapse start for ps4 users ? anyone know ?
---
For no reason? üòÇüòÇ that's funny.
---
Pig got nerfed so it wouldnt win every single game in existence. The reverse bear traps keep players hostage ingame. What does EGC do? It kills hostage players. Do you not see ANY problem with that?? Please tell me you see a problem if they left her as was.
---
Then how could I have Self Care, metal of man, D'S, and Andrenaline (or lithe) (or deadhard)? I'm not a survivor main, I'm just saying, as killer, this is all I've been facing :p besides when I play killer, you'll never get a chance to use borrowed time ;)
---
"RBT isn't getting for kills ure bad"
---
well, no shit, it's to put pressure on survivors and force them to do a side mission before leaving, and now there's no pressure
---
Alright thank you
---
Look at the Patch Notes Post then, a lot of people saying it
---
You can‚Äôt heal with No Mither and Nurses lets you see survivors auras when they‚Äôre healing within  a certain range.
---
Lol sometimes I do that as a way to let the other person keep working on the gen if I know the killers coming. But typically it's my friends that run straight to the killer unintentionally and it's hilarious
---
Objectively bad game design will bring out anyone with half a rain.
---
Her power is designed to delay the game, not keep people hostage post 5 gens being done.
---
This change only nerfs tunneling people once the gates are powered, since you can just tunnel the trap for a free kill.
---
Are you asking because you genuinely don‚Äôt know or are you trying to say it‚Äôs not?
---
The best kind of stat
---
You can leave the exit gates if your beartrap isn't active, beartraps won't activate until after a gen is fixed, so putting them on after 5th gen is powered is useless. Timer does not decrease on beartrap while you are in terror radius (previous it was when you were in chase)
---
Mostly cause pig isn't top tier yet is very popular. People were hoping for a buff when end game was announced and they dropped the nerf outta nowhere
---
Neesh so much dependence on frenzy Hits to down. Guess Myers Power is useless in a chase since it can't down. /s
---
Seriously Legion looks more balanced than before. No spazing lunges, no more nutty infinite mending (not the fault of frenzy), no more looking down or moonwalk to end chase (still can do it but less reason to). T·ªõ me these are good. I Main the Breakfast Club and I am still happy for these.
---
i personally never like trapper that much
---
And when Bloodshard events come, the Doctor comes to play.
---
IT'S GETTIN' REAL BAD. HOPE THE DEDICATED SERVERS ACTUALLY HELP WITH THIS LIKE THEY SAID IT WOULD. BALL IS IN BHVR'S COURT!
---
It can be argued either way. On the one hand, there are perks to help with the issue of comm-blackouts and SWF exists for a reason, but on the other hand, killers can often be bullied by good players at higher ranks. If you play solo at lower ranks, the games will be a lot harder, but at higher ranks even solo queues can be easy for certain survivors.
---
(I play both sides of the coin.)
---
and SWF comms coordination is way stronger than killer
---
Okay, thank you so much!!
---
I‚Äôve played enough of each side to know that this is what the community needs to try 
---
So many people don‚Äôt understand what the other side goes through
---
Lol u right only good thing is one of his add-ons applying broken for one minute now
---
Yeah, its not always a mistake to run at the killer at that point for like me, its a way of admitting it was my fault and going to deal with consequences so the other person can keep working unchallenged.
---
U can afford it buy it all!
---
just blind them when they are breaking a pallet
---
Don't forget debuffs with buttons. My only wish for those is the debuff start after the mend is healed.
---
I HAD THIS HAPPEN TODAY WITH PLAGUE AND MY TEAMMATE ACTUALLY SAID IT WAS COOL IN THE LOBBY AFTERWARDS AND THAT I DESERVED TO LIVE.
---
HOORAY, NOT EVERYONE SUCKS!
---
Again, how is that irony?
---
After I got stunned by the first one, I respect the shit out of those coasters.
---
Legion should have definitely gotten nerfed but pig did not deserve a nerf what-so-fu*****-ever
---
dont fall for the jebait.
---
Agreed. I feel bad for the devs. They get so much abuse over everything they do, but keep trying their best!
---
5 feet away cause he is not gay..
---
I FOUND OUT TODAY THAT IF YOU TRIGGER A SKILLCHECK AT THE END OF YOUR MEDKIT AND IT RUNS OUT BEFORE YOU CAN HIT THE SKILLCHECK THE KILLER GETS A NOTIFICATION.
---
I MEAN WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK
---
I'm not entirely sure, but I have gotten hits that were very questionable
---
some of us who do play both sides get totally ignored
---
That cosmetic is *badass*!!!
---
What do you mean like she not top tier cuz whose gona take down nurse spirit and billy but shes deffinitelly fine. Her power is useful in chase and she can slow the gen rush down and also sneak up on people. I mean pig is fine look at freddy wraith leatherface myers doctor and plague
---
Video?
---
At the same time people complain and bitch because they care. As much shit as they get the devs know this
---
It's called dead by daylight, not "Tbag til the Sun Rises". F****** Claudette mains :p
---
Precisely. It looks cool.
---
But games are shorter. Survivors sticking around could net the killer enough points to pip but with the end-game, survivors are told to leave early.. or else! The end-game event itself is just a 3 minute countdown (or 6 if someone's on a hook) and.. like.. what else? Killers gain literally nothing from this.
---
To make it worse, end-game killers like Pig and Freddy got fed even more nerfs to rob them off their end-game prowess because God forbid them using their power to the fullest of their design.
---
Oh alright I‚Äôll do that
---
Never
---
WHY AM I SEEING MORE QUITTERS ON PS4 LATELY? IS IT BECAUSE OF GREEN RANK?? WTF PISSES ME OFF SO MUCH
---
Infact, wouldn't that make it worse because it would be a sign that people with rbt are close to you?
---
Honestly I think it's just going to make things more annoying anyways. Survivors don't really like killers camping in the endgame, and it isn't really fun for either side. But like, once a gate is open leaving is pretty much guaranteeing people get out. With RBTs Pig could leave survivors on hook, because she knew that they'd still have a delay before they could escape.
---
Ya. I'm not saying shes terrible by any means jus not high enough where a nerf would be justified.  I like most enjoy playing as and against pig
---
Imagine saying somebody deserves abuse because they didn‚Äôt make changes you wanted to see.
---
&gt; Imho "toying with people at the endgame" was extremely toxic pig behaviour
---
Using the killer's power for what it's meant to be used for is "toxic behavior"? Wow.
---
It's not fun when red rankers lose or have equal level competition huh? So they just go slaughter casuals day in and day out. When you can purposefully de-rank/rank reset then it contradicts the whole point. Matchmaking should be based on skill, always.
---
Nah, it will be more like: Traps break after being triggered/disarmed
---
Same here.
---
That's not true :p everybody has been begging for legion nerfs. Likewise end game changes and dedicated servers have been a dream of everyone that plays this game. On top of that they have done a good amount of balance changes to maps which have been much needed. They even resized a couple maps that were hard for killers besides Billy. Not every update is gonna please everyone but you are just making crap up. That's the kind of hating OP is talking about
---
I'm not allowed to argue for fairness just because I'm not a killer? Your argument is literally ''All pigs tunnel. All pigs tunnel.'' No they don't. Grow up.
---
Because that's the only "use" of the add on.
---
They don't bleed until you've already left the area completely and they don't lose HP while mending.
---
You can continue to level up after level 50
---
Almost got me.
---
I've gotten a 4K as Freddy, it doesn't mean Freddy is strong.
---
hell yeah he is
---
i also wonder if the canister on his back counts as his head piece
---
There is pressure, if you are chasing different people you will be out of their terror radius.
---
Unless someone is being an idiot and just following you, but in that case they aren't working on gens and can be easily found so it's still a lot of map pressure.
---
No, the hatch standoffs definitely needed to go, too.
---
I love how she pretended to be a survivor even though we can clearly see her pig in sheep clothing nature. 
---
Now she got caught red handed,she shows her true nature.
---
I agree. I see what the devs are trying to do for the pig but the fact that they didn‚Äôt give her anything in return makes this way to harsh. If traps aren‚Äôt meant to secure kills in the end game ok cool I can live with that but they can at least make the traps more viable for stalling the early game or mid game, but the terror radius change also screws with that as well.
---
Gamers think videogames are like sandwiches made by slaves; they are made to order, perfectly, or punishable by death :p
---
Negative criticism isn't abuse as long as it's not attacking the devs directly.
---
This might be a stupid idea, but I think they should change it back to 25% and make it activate with the last 2 survivors alive.
---
DbD was released back in June 2016.  That's plenty of time.
---
I dont need to tbag. I run them thendip into the grass.
---
No one give a fuck.
---
This is fair to many of us. Killers are due for some nerf. Especially the tunnelling ones.
---

---
Pig: If I'm going down, I'm taking Tapp with me!
---
I up vote all my replies unless they are dacist or sexist. It wasnt me who downvoted.
---
Yikes
---
Roflmao. Yes the killers get buffed while poor Mettle of Man, DS, Adrenalin, (fill in perk) perps are being crushed. Hopefully next mid Patch all killers become Mr. Stab. N√≥ Power just a sharp object to stab survivors but no matter if it Hits or missed Stab is stunned for 30 seconds, walks at 25% speed (becuz killers are slow in horror movies), and no perks or add-ons. Oh yeah gens start at 50 percent done and all survivors can fix th√™m at 300% speed. GG EZ
---
Those positive changes you speak about were done more than 3-4 months ago, the time period I'm exclusively talking about.
---
People wanted Legion reworked, not gutted.
---
People wanted Endgame without gutting Pig RBTs and Remember Me.
---
In context to the devs getting abuse. 
---
You said: ‚ÄúAt the moment, they absolutely deserve.‚Äù
---
Great criticism, mate.
---
Our killers must show BHVR de wae.
---
Okay
---
Ots not really a nerf its change hows a trap working to prevent abuse
---
1. Survivors never really die from traps unless tunneled. It's been this way since pig came first out and hasn't changed, traps are mostly for slowing the game down by having survivors waste time.
---
2. Here's a scenario that's way more likely: You're in a chase as pig, come somewhat close to a box and suddenly see someone elses trap stopped ticking down. That means that survivor is likely on that box right now, and is an easy hit/down for you. This is infinitely more useful than the few seconds shaved off of their timer that wasn't going to kill them most likely anyway.
---
They absolutely deserve the shitstorm they have created. I've mentioned my direct criticism of the changes on the forum already.
---
Clearly you haven't seen the DBD reddit post-board then. You're literally stating things that aren't even true I can't even.
---
I'd like to think he knows the in and out of mining techniques. Hard labour explains how proficiency in trap creation.
---
WHY DID THEY TOUCH THE PIG ? LEAVE AMANDA ALONE GOD DAMNIT SHE DOES NOT DESERVE THIS
---
WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE VISUAL SOUND CUES ? I KINDA WANT TO PLAY THE GAME BHVR
---
LEGION PALLET VAULT( ALSO SOME OTHER CHANGES BUT I CAN TAKE THIS)
---
WHERE IS FREDDY REWORK? HUH? WHERE IS IT BHVR ?
---
They're remade from screenshots, but that doesn't make them fake... They look the same in game.
---
Cry some moar then.
---
Yeah but if they ignore killer mains, they won‚Äôt have a game

---
Your taking this way too personally. I love this game and I want to see this game get better but the devs keep doing stupid things to the game. Instead of making the games fair they give us unnecessary changes and making a killers useless. Honestly, They haven't earned any respect from me. Also just insulting people because we have different opinions. If you continue like this people will lose respect for you too. If you would like a respectful agreement then please don't insult me.
---
Especially since this is a killer people paid real money for. Making her shit is MAKING IT LESS LIKELY PEOPLE WILL BOTHER BUYING PAID DLC IN FUTURE. How do I know i won't shell out real cash only for them to be made shit, too?
---
There's no harm in Pig being very strong while they spend time carefully thinking about things.
---
You hear this BHVR? DON'T DISINCENTIVISE PEOPLE FROM BUYING PAID DLC.
---
Play a bit of survivor and get tunneled 8 games in a row with nothing you can do to stop it and try asking that question again.
---
Why is Trapper available in Shards but not Meg? I struggle to understand BHVR's pattern with pricing their cosmetics.
---
a meme killed the game for you? sounds like a you problem, pal.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll get reworked to mayyybeee be viable in 2021
---
Wait can you just leave out the gate with a RBT on in the PTB? I just played against the pig and went trough all 4 trap boxes to get it off. Still escaped but that would have saved a couple mins
---
If their main reason for putting in EGC was to stop survivors from BMing then that's pretty pathetic and totally unnecessary to majorly overhaul an aspect of the game for.
---
FUCKING WHAT?!
---
THE FUCKING PIG NERFS!
---
A good spirit never mind games.
---
&gt; IT'S NOT LIKE BEHAVIOUR DIDN'T PLAYTEST THE ENDGAME WITH PIG 
---
IMPLYING THEY EVEN
---
wow, I wanted to go back to the game after a while with the endgame stuff, but since pigu was my favorite, I just don't want to anymore, that's reaaaally bad.
---
Lul they are not ment to kill.btw when survs managed to get 5 get done its gg already no need for traps to carry killer
---
Why do you need to spin your camera during 360?
---
SUGGESTED CHANGE, NOT A REAL THING.
---
As long as it's not ticking. Literally no reason to use a trap in the end game.
---
IDGAF THOSE KIDS
---
ACQUIRE FUN
---
TUNNEL
---
anti-fun and too hard to deal with for people who don't play a lot
---
I just wanted more lore :(
---
Well, I‚Äôm convinced 
---
Jokes aside, IMO the only reason for the pig nerf was to prevent her from becoming an absolute monster when collapse comes out
---
There is no threat to them anymore. They did slow down the game, but now they don‚Äôt. Also it‚Äôs not over until the end game screen
---
The point is that the change is bad and shouldn't make it to live. End game pig is the most interesting and thematic way to play her.
---
 Now that entire playstyle is worthless.

Downvotes are to the right dummy.
---
THE COMPLAINS EXIST BECAUSE THIS "FIX" WAS POORLY THOUGHT,
---
IT'S EASY TO THINK ABOUT ALTERNATIVES THAT AREN'T THIS SHIT WHICH WOULD BENEFIT BOTH PARTIES WHILE KEEPING THE GAME GOING AND FUN
---
I havent noticed it yet myself
---
Given the number of perks and effects that apply to injured survivors, going after the injured survivor will almost always make sense, even if it's shitty to experience.
---
With stuff like Mettle of Man and the exhaustion perks that are on the healthy survivor you're now chasing, though, you're probably shooting yourself in the foot and dropping all momentum by not going after the limpy gazelle. Not tunneling is giving the survivors a reset, which probably throws the game.
---
For the individual survivor that might be neat, but over time it will erode the game.
---
SO MANY FUCKING DC'S

---
&gt; 9/10 piggies are tunneler cunts.
---
this is as absurd as saying 1/10
---
Firstly they will slow the game down as they did cuz when exit gates are powered there is nothing to skow down anymore. Secondly yeah it is over because when 4 are allive to this points 95% of the time 4 will get out
---
SURVIVORS WHO ARE BEING CHASED BY THE KILLER WHILE ANOTHER SURVIVOR IS ON THE HOOK, DON'T RUN TOWARDS THE HOOK YOU FUCKING POTATO!
---
LET OTHER SURVIVORS GET A SAFE SAVE INSTEAD OF YOU LEADING THE KILLER BACK
---
Yeah cause I'm really sad enough to do that even though there's evidently some made up accounts in the comments against me most likely made by you.
---
AGREED ! PAST 3 GAMES, 3/4 SURVIVORS DC ON FIRST DOWN. I LET THE LAST SURVIVOR FARM BUT IT IS GETTING BORING.
---
IT IS NOT, TRUST ME, I CHECKED EVERYTHING ON MY END AND EVERYTHING WORKS FINE. MORE AND MORE PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THIS ISSUE SINCE THE PLAGUE PATCH AND THERE IS A THREAD ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS ABOUT IT. I HAVE SEEN OTHER PEOPLE IN MY GAMES BEING KICKED OUT AS WELL.

Outside of the nerfs to killer it's not a nerf.
---
French, Spanish and multiple MFLs are taught in most English schools, however not everyone is fluent in any of those languages. Most people in the world only know one language fluently lmao.
---
No they won‚Äôt. The terror radius change. And no crouching doesn‚Äôt justify this change! Also u can slow the game down with traps to keep them from leaving via gate. Also if the game was already over, why do survs bitch about NOED? It shouldn‚Äôt matter if the games already over.
---
I'M AWARE THAT IT STARTED WITH THE PLAGUE PATCH. IF IT'S **THIS  MUCH** IT 100 PERCENT IS YOU.
---
spirit is fun... plague is fun too, myers is also fun, but i find hillbilly and spirit the funniest killers so far.
---
WHEN THE FUCK IS DBD ENDGAME COMING OUT?
---
Real question, does using the iridescent pin to break pallets count towards spirit fury? If so I‚Äôm going to absolutely devour pallets when the changes drop
---
Maan i Just bough the pig last week üò•
---
You are sad enough to angry response everyone who disagree with you so yeah, I can see you being desperate to be right. 
---
Or is it for attention? 
---
#sad
---
Agreed
---
imo he‚Äôs now just a worse plague. 
---
If plague didn‚Äôt have her corrupt form then legion would be better.
---
It doesn't help that by the time you've found the next person their mend is already done since they watched you leave after hitting them. Mend needs to take longer if they want their power to apply pressure.
---
The most notable change (and the only one I can remember) is the decisive strike change, 
---
If I remember correctly it gives you a 60(?) second timeframe where you can use it after being unhooked, turning it into an anti-tunnel/farming perk 
---
Which, IMO, was a well deserved change since it was essentially a get out of jail free card before
---
"Its my opinion that the earth is flat"
---
Wrong.
---
Ya, if suvivors can be bad, so can i!
---
(Nurse main if i didnt makr myself clear)
---
Yeah, god forbid a tool used to murder people might kill someone
---
Maybe because they don't wanna argue with ape-brained people like you.
---
still tho now survivors can ignore the RBT at the last gen and keep working.
---
Right...
---
Keep being weird I guess. Pig nerfs are staying L O L.
---
If ur facing a stupid pig yes. I personally like to spread my traps evenly. As a 2nd trap likely means they‚Äôve been hooked already once, so they‚Äôll probably die soon anyway
---
So, nerf normal, fair Nurse, and make 5 blink Nurse even more OP?
---
Its almost like they could have used ptb and player feedback to judge whether pig was in a strong place or not and tone it back as necessary. 
---
In all fairness the main issue I would understand is her ability to stall players from being able to leave by trapping then patrolling boxes but this is something she has been able to do since release. 
---
People have suggested a lot more mild changes like slowing down the timer while a survivor has a trap on their head since the end game collapse was ment to prevent game griefing not stalling out survivors until death. I don't even care about the terror radius change so much as her power literally not being able to activate once gens are done, that is what I don't like.
---
Was picking some of the most used perks. Nothing on what is op
---
One time I actually counted and out of 10 games only 2 the survivors played until death/escape. The other 8 were DC's, so that's 80% xD. But then, that was probably a bad day.
---
Nah,it's because they know you imagine shit.
---
Being correct*
---
God forbid we use a device intended to kill people to kill people.
---
So why would they commit if they would be dead
---
Had this happen when I was killer. Two survivors and myself were all stuck there. I managed to hit them off, then I lunge attacked to get off
---
THINKS ABOUT DBD, DC
---
Yeah, I just feel i'd rather get perks for the killers I don't play and spend the bloodpoints to get them on killers that I do play, Oh well since i'm starting to play more I should be able to build BP easily and now I can play these new killers when I feel like.
---
I am so confused. Where did he get the idea of a niche situation where 4 survivors need to be alive with all gens done? The same can be done with 3 or 2 survivors left and all gens done no?
---
I dig it.
---
I play survivor sometimes, and i get that feeling sucks. But that's like killers who complain about flashlights, or  Pallet looping. Both sides doing the optimal thing hinders the other side, making it less fun to some people.
---
Too bad the in game models don‚Äôt looks this good.
---
Except it does nerf every killer. Escaping is easier for survivor at every stage in the game.
---
I feel the exact same way! x) Hence this picture! I'm a pretty anxious person overall and I'm not really comfortable with playing multiplayers game, even more when I'm surrounded by people that looks like they know all their shit by heart and won't make any mistakes. Even if it's not true, that's what my brain decides to think
---
I think that maybe if the fatigue weren't so bad and stabbing a survivor that has deep wounds didn't drain the timer all the way it might be much more useful. Maybe after each stab it only goes down like 25% and then fatigue but in it's current state it's almost as bad as ultra rare mix tape.
---
&gt; Youre actually disabled m8.
---
Ad hominem to start your message, an excellent choice!
---
&gt;Her WHOLE POWER is game hostaging. Its just how it is. She stops you from playing the game.
---
No, her power delays the game. The moment your trap starts ticking you need to go look around several boxes to take it off, which delays your progress on your main objective. 
---
She doesn't prevent you from playing the game, you can still unhook people, get into chases, if gens haven't been popped yet you can even work on gens and just 99% them so you can pop them fast when you do get your trap off.
---
&gt;her power allows a lot of fun play-counter-play
---
Give an example of the play-counter-play.
---
Not being able to hostage people post 5 gens and just tunnel someone who can't get away is a good thing. You can still put a trap on them prior to 5 gens and it will still prevent them from getting out.
---
Oh I forgot about that change, I got Remember Me, Sloppy Butcher, Tinkerers, Brutal Strength, Lite, Calm Spirit, and Left Behind, does that sound good or am I missing something?
---
I guess all of our expert balancing testers should have been more specific with their memes :p
---
''Imagine shit'' ''9/10 pigs tunnel'' Okay then.
---
BHVR: Would you look at the time? Clock: Killer Nerfs
---
Why you need to spin your camera during 360? I'm new at this and don't know how it works.
---
HAHAHHAHA WHAT A BUNCH OF NERDS
---
The terror radius change was fine by me because I understand they can't really fix the moonwalking exploit without it (even though pigs didn't do it as much as legion) also pig has crouch which gets around that. 
---
My main issue was with traps not being able to activate when all gens are done making them useless if you have any left in the late game. It took away the strategic choice of spacing out traps to stall out the game or saving them for late game and changed it to use all traps before they become useless hunks of metal.
---
Good luck with your campaign. But I know no one gives a fuck as this thread shows.
---
you're saying this like endgame can't trigger with 1 person left. Imagine trying to escape with a trap on your head, escaping the Pig then removing the trap and then dying 2 seconds later due to the collapse... Seems fair
---
from a pig main......this is absolute bullshit lmao
---
As far as I remember you‚Äôve got them all
---
I dont mind that actually!! its part of the game and there are ways around it. Its frustrating but it drives me to get better. Both sides have moves and tactics that are really good and are frustrating to the other side. All you gotta to if find ways around it, get better, and move on to the next trial. Complaining does not make you better at the game.

Then why comment lmfao
---
&gt; You just tried to be an edgy contrarian
---
It's just my opinion man, not trying to be an edgy contrarian, I just think while the nerf kinda sucks, it's better for the overall health of the game. The devs have made it clear in the past that they don't consider every killer to be usable in high levels of play (suck as the infamous "If you want rank 1 play nurse" comment)
---
&gt; Literally no one said this. 
---
The meme isn't talking about the pig nerfs, I've seen people make that argument described in the meme in regards to the end game collapse, if you want to try and tell me that I didn't see these things being said you're more than welcome to, but that doesn't mean I didn't seen people say it, the conversation is mostly focused on the pig nerfs (even in this comment section) but some people have been discussing the end game collapse itself, with some going as far to say the 3 minute time should be reduced.
---
&gt; Guess you missed the part where the Pig has literally never been good at slowing down the game at high levels of play due to the incredibly flawed mechanic of Jigsaw Boxes. The one thing that kept her as an average-ish killer was her ability to control the end game. You also must have missed the fact that RBTs have been gutted at ALL points of the game, not just in the end game.
---
Personally I consider the use of RBTs to be similar to Hex perks such as Ruin in the sense that you're not guaranteed a specific result, it can either go really well or really badly and generally you're relying on a lot of luck when using them. Generally that survivor is going to be spending time trying to remove the trap, the amount of time being determined by how lucky they get. 
---
&gt; So Pig should be gutted for that very common scenario in which 1) the exit gates are opened, 2) all other survivors have left, 3) the last survivor has an RBT on, 4) the survivor is injured, 5) while the Pig is chasing them, and 6) the Pig closes the hatch. Yeah that definitely sounds like a common and problematic scenario that warrants gutting an already underwhelming killer. 
---
I personally don't see the situation as gutting the pig, which may be where our opinions on the change fundamentally differ. 
---
3 and 4 in your example go hand in hand, many survivors (not all, but enough) at various levels of play forgo healing if they have an active RBT on their head. 1 in your example would exist in 100% of the situations effected by this nerf. 2 and 5 also work together. If I'm getting chased by the pig I would ask any SWF friends still in the game to leave so I can at least attempt to get the hatch. 6 I'd have to ask you two questions: Can a killer close the hatch during a standoff? Can the pig grab jumping survivors in her crouched state?
---
I genuinely don't know the answer to those because I've not been extensively testing the PTB but if they're yes then there's nothing that survivor can really do. 
---
That scenario I described has been relatively common in matches I've played (even randoms have been taking the hint and leaving to allow the hatch occasionally), I personally removing all chance of escape from a survivor isn't fun. Making it hard to escape is good, but in that situation it's not really hard, it's just "guess I'll die"
---
&gt; Yeah fuck enjoying the game or wanting a competitive and balanced game. Better just get used to it instead of trying to make a difference. Why speak up and try to improve anything when you can do nothing and scoff at people for pointing out this kind of egregious behaviour.
---
Honestly I think you should calm down a bit. The end game collapse update is going to be a huge step in making the game more competitive and balanced, while also making matches more fun for people learning the game, mostly on the killer side but also for the survivors too (IMO this update is amazing for the health of the game as a whole).
---
The pig keeping the ability to have RBTs auto-activate with this new update would've just been a completely unfun situation for survivors in my opinion. I think (and hope) the pig will get some buffs to compensate for this in the future. 
---
I want the game to be balanced for both sides, but with this massive change to the endgame, something should be done about the Pig's ability specifically to keep the game fair for both sides.
---
I am not 100 percent sure but I think the pallet power drops are in live. I would want the mend timer to drop when they are healing but eh.

(mild nsfw warning)
---
Is she though, I‚Äôm not a great killer but I don‚Äôt enjoy playing as her
---
It's never too late to save Amanda.
---
I agree. Should be fun to play as, though I always had fun with the Goonies.
---
At that sucks ass to be on the receiving end of, but I dont blame anyone for going after the person taken off the hook. I personally like to go get the farmer, but you dont have to give pity at times.
---
But that‚Äôs something that has been proven factually incorrect with exploration and scientific data. This is an opinion about a video game character. There‚Äôs a very large difference.
---
Your name made my day
---
Because I thought you are rational person and not crazy lunatic. 
---
Piggies tunnelling because of nerf. Hah!
---
It‚Äôs smart to go after weaker targets. However, there are perks and powers that reward going after different targets. DC, Make Your Choice, RBTs. Yes tunneling sucks, but sometimes it‚Äôs also necessary. If someone is super toxic or very coordinated, it‚Äôs probably best to take them out. I try to avoid tunneling as much as possible, but sometimes u would do yourself a disservice to go after someone else.
---
I wish they revert pig nerf during PTB so people might see how OP she might be without the nerf.
---
it's p bad but thankfully that's what the PTB is *for*
---
Deliberately following someone with a trap on their head so they can't do anything except watch the timer tick down until they die is what I'd call "toxic behavior" personally. Some pig players would specifically target one survivor to die in a slow and annoying fashion during the end game.
---
Hey. Take a breath. Chill out.
---
Once all gens are done RBTs that have not been put on yet offer 0 pressure because they don't activate and survivors can leave with them on their head. RBTs put on before still work the same but it is the first sentence people have a problem with.
---
Is the new stuff out?  Jane, Meg, and Kate cosmetics?
---
Does anyone see the changes in We‚Äôre gonna live forever‚Äù perk? Isn‚Äôt it the same as before?
---
I think that survivors currently have free roam and no pressure at the end of the game, unless the killer has people hooked or downed. With the update they have to act. It means they will generally have to be more exposed and go for the exit. I think this gives the killer more certainty on where to be and zone areas. 
---
I think they have been testing this and come up with what they think is balanced to the new end game and will now test and tweak more.
---
I think the shorter door opening time is a bit strange but I think this is maybe meant to be in favour of the killer opening the gate too which can trigger certain strategies and plays. But will have to see.. nobody usually wants to just run and escape instantly just incase a teammate needs help.
---
Most importantly it stops abusing killers and game time, and hatch showdowns. These may not seem like direct buffs but they need fixing for the killer because exploiting it is equivalent to a glitch in the way the game is meant to work. Even though sometimes it produced humourous results... Once they sort out issues like that it will be way easier to balance the game features that cause survivors or killers to win or lose. It is a shame the pig has taken a hit because of her endgame mechanics, but I believe its for the greater good, and that they will look at tweaking things.
---
right, the pallet power drops need to be gone
---
It is probably Barbecue and Chilli!!!
---
Sorry for bad quality, but it says   
---
"I saw your dreams. It's pretty gay"
---
It‚Äôs sad that I wrote this 4 months ago and it‚Äôs still not happened.
---
That contradicts your post then because tunneling is something someone who isn't good at the game does because they're not good enough to let them go and still get everyone plus earning more points. Tunneling is the easy cop out.
---
I can confirm, yes.
---
U r gonna give the preacher a heart attack. Assuming he doesn‚Äôt know who that is
---
I would put this on the forums too, if you can.
---
Nah.
---
**_When you can't play the game because of trash PC, but know how to play better than people who have played more_**
---
I can not tell if you are being sarcastic
---
Well when it comes to looping there's really no other way to stay alive in a chase u know that right? If survivors don't loop wut are they supposed to do? Run in a straight line and hop u don't catch up to them? Looping is pretty much essential if a survivor wants to win a chase since it can either cause the killer to leave them or gives players time to do gens. As for flashlight, yes that's optional but it also helps survivors escape chases and save their teammates. Tunneling on the other hand is VERY optional, yes it's a strategy but honestly it's a bs strategy. Not only does it ruin the fun for the tunneled survivor but it also doesn't allow them to get blood points. Idk what KIND of tunneling u do, but to me there's 2 types. 
---
1.) Douche Tunneling - When a killer leaves another chase just to go kill a survivor they have been chasing and hooking all game even if someone else runs in front of them to take aggro but they ignore them anyeay. For example: u hook a survivor and go find another and hit them (or not) and when the person gets unhooked u abandon ur current chase just to go hunt for that survivor and hook them again to kill them. This is a really dumb strategy and very annoying to survivors. Depending whether or not they are new it can also ruin the game for new players.
---
2.) Easy Kill Tunneling - Just like before u hook someone but rather than leaving the chase u keep going HOWEVER if that person was to somehow be seen by u or u accidentally chase the new survivor toward them, u hit the freshly unhooked person and ignore the new guy just for an easy kill. This way isn't AS bad but still if u know someone hasn't had a chance to play just let them do a gen or rescue someone for some points THEN kill them lol it's not hard. Chances are if u caught them before u can do it again.
---
There's probably more types of tunnellers but these are the main two. Ik there's some tunnellers out there that go for certain survivors just cause they don't like the character they are playing as or just cause they looped them all game/a couple gens. 
---
As much as I disagree towards tunneling there's only two ways I agree with it. Either killing a toxic survivor (flashlight clicking, tbagging, etc) or securing a kill after gates are powered.
---
Hatch spawns at any point. Punishing the killer for doing well. Also quote me on this. Blood Warden will still never be used a month after the patch.
---
plus won't most pigs just be crouched anyway to make the terror 0 anyway? or did they change that
---
You're digging yourself in a whole I need my popcorn x'D
---
I mean it. So many Pig mains honestly believe the point of the trap is to kill the wearer and not act as a time waster.   
---
"Her power is USELESS now!"  
---
Does it still waste a lot of time and force the wearer to get rid of it? Yes? Then stfu.
---
I have to politely disagree, as up until recently a lot of things in the game have been killer centric (as in gives them more advantage even if only slightly so). Side note most of the devs are killer mains, don‚Äôt get me wrong though it‚Äôs definitely fucked up how they ruined the pig but at least they are they are attempting to make it balanced. They aren‚Äôt doing it well, but they are doing it.
---
Every once in a while we get double bloodpoint events. Doctor is great at farming bloodpoints without much effort, so during these times he becomes very common.
---
It was impossible to have fun as survivor vs the old legion. 
---
You would spend your entire game A) Running away in a straight line because it's impossible to get away using pallets or windows B) Doing generators C) Mending D) Unhooking teammates
---
All of the fun in dbd as survivor is in the chase, so they can't have a killer who has such unfun chase mechanics for the survivors. I understand that if you're a legion main who plays them legit it sucks, but it's a pretty clear decision for the devs to make legion (arguably) less fun for the killer and (objectively) much more fun for all 4 survivors instead of leaving them in their current state.
---
Legion changes will stand. He is still on a similar power level as before just less annoying.
---
I personally hope the revert the Pig changes.
---
so suggestion on how to improve?
---
They need to drastically reduce the timer. The whole point (I thought) was to generate further suspense and pressure the survivors to leave.
---
...Why is she holding a Jiggy?
---
Another thing to add here. If see an unhook, then run over to down the savior, but only see the injured guy, what are you supposed to do?
---
So there are  players with actual iq left
---
They do if the trap is active, inactive traps will not however, traps are activated by completing a gen and dont activate auto.atically after all gens are done anymore
---
I guess I'm just unlucky but they are not easy to get off for me it's always the 4th or 5th box I check
---
It's almost as if people don't want him to be healthy for the game.If they reverted the changes to legion I'm almost 100% sure people would still be upset
---
Fixed an issue that made it possible for The Legion to search a locker while in Feral Frenzy.
---
Ikr
---
sometimes getting a down vs having to wait 7 seconds before doing anything everytime you find a survivor. I wonder which is more important
---
Slugging is tactic used to down as many survivors to slow down generators or prevent the last person from getting the hatch. Pairing it with Hex the 3rd seal, Knockout, Deerstalker and Nurse's Calling works well.
---
Respecting Pallets is when killers don't swing through pallets for fear of being stunned. Hit boxes are so wonky i always swing through pallets.
---
I‚Äôm still confused why
---
Well right now there is very little they can do because if you dc by force closing the game, rather than through the pause menu, they have no way of telling if you dc'd or the killer dc'd because it is peer to peer.
---
But with dedicated servers, that will change!
---
That‚Äôs just bad luck. Each box has a 20% chance of having the key. For most cases it‚Äôs under three boxes.
---
why‚Äôd you have to do my boy true like that
---
Patently and demonstrably false.
---
Totally agreed tbh. I think most changes were fine. The decreased vault speed wasn't neccessary imo but good changes otherwise.
---
A sensible reply. Yeah, I understand it was not fun for the survivors and there is nothing really I can do to stop the changes from the PTB coming to the live servers but atleast I hope they understand that the killer is losing most of his fun aspect and they balance him out somewhat differently so it's fair for both.
---
THE WHOLE EMBLEM SYSTEM! WHY SHOULD I GET PUNISHED FOR GETTING TUNNELED
---
THINK OF IT THAT WAY, YOU'RE GETTING A CRASH COURSE ON NOT GETTING CAUGHT BY THE KILLER. EVENTUALLY, WITH PRACTICE, YOU WILL GET SO GOOD THAT YOU WILL EITHER GO THROUGH MULTIPLE-GEN CHASES OR JUST STRAIGHT MAKE KILLER GIVE UP AND GO BACK TO PATROLING GENS.
---
So brave.
---
I RELATE TO THIS SO MUCH
---
I thought he was asking if it were possible to have 8 tokens permanently. My bad.
---
He wasn't even very powerful before. They could have changed the way the chase mechanic works so that you couldn't exploit his power and he would have been fine. But nope, they just made his power useless.
---
The Killer is already encouraged to patrol the gates once they're powered, if Killer camps a gate then you use the other one.
---
* Censor all usernames for posts and screenshots or video featuring other players in a negative light.
---
I mean...this is the point of the ability.
---
I just became a pig main because she‚Äôs the only killer I enjoy playing and the nerf gets put up I think it‚Äôs a sign from the entity that I‚Äôm not meant for killer
---
Played Legion on PTB at rank 6, not bad at all, his new base movement speed makes up for it. Missing an attack in Frenzy ending it is kinda bad.
---
If it's already active it will still blow up. Only inactive traps won't prevent escaping.
---
Crazy and can't spell. But eats popcorn to alleviate her sadness that no one likes her.
---
I think you're just trying to justify tunneling like it's some tactical, non-toxic strategy and it's really not. Anyone who thinks that going after someone who literally just got off the hook is reasonable is lying to themselves. I never said anything about survivors doing gens? This proves my point that you're trying to justify tunneling by pointing the finger at things I didn't even mention. So what are you going to point the finger at if there is no gen rushing and you still tunnel? Survivors throw themselves at killers all the time but they still go after the unhooked because they aren't skilled enough to go for someone else and get them later.
---
Why? Correct me if I am wrong but don't most killers with a Power Bar lose it getting stunned by a pallet?
---
You can have 8 tokens permanently though. You keep all tokens you have when the obsession dies. Ive grabbed an injured obsession off a gen and death hooked them with 8 tokens. You only lose tokens when you hit the obsession. You can also tombstone them, since that doesn't deplete tokens either. Its not often but its possible.
---
Not all of us hate the new Legion, just a vocal minority. Those who loved the new Legion can't be bothered to reply in every single thread that people create complaining about his change. 
---
As a survivor I love the new Legion. I couldn't stand any more moon walking legions or Frank's Mixtape. 
---
As a killer, I don't care about him because I don't play as him. He was weak before and this rework won't change that but at least he isn't as annoying.
---
No. Even if they did,
---
HILLBILLY WILL NEVER BE FUN TO PLAYA AGAINST
---
AT LEAST NURSE DOESN'T SAY FUCK YOU YOU DIE INSTANTLY
---
&gt;Hatch spawns at any point. Punishing the killer for doing well
---
So, it still only affects end game? Alright
---
Also, the strat is still open to camp hatch until you see the survivor and then close it, it's not like your forced to close it immediately. 
---
Having hatch open at any point is also a lot better than being the last alive with 5 gens and giving yourself to the killer, it definitely sucks to just sit there fast vaulting windows because there's no way you can do 2 gens and not get caught.
---
I'm not saying Blood Warden is going to be Meta, but it's definitely way better now.
---
Could the rework entail perk changes? They're all pretty shit and now Remember Me has even been nerfed. They might not fit with his power anymore tbh. 
---
Actually nvm, why bother nerfing a perk if you plan on changing it completely in a couple of months.
---
115% MS killers and powers that make it so you're better off/just turn you into, an M1 killer
---
Name a more iconic duo
---
The nerfs are just very unwarranted especially the TR one, they can find another way to make her power work during the EGC, I thought they were just gonna have it slow the timer
---
Imo it takes way too long to heal yourself. In solo que it's a good perk, but in SWF it's completely useless. Much faster to run to a teammate to get healed
---
This is not a fact. Sometimes it will be true, sure. But she has a standard radius and some maps, like her own,  are tiny.
---
Tunneling means going after someone that just got off the hook though..
---
*Oink*
---
I think the last one should just say ‚Äû People who disconnect against any Killer‚Äú
---
Don't nerf Pig, rework her addons. I will wait for Freddy rework to judge him more. LF it say make him quicker when charging his saw. Also I am still mad about Pig, so it might just apply to her.
---
OKAY?
---
I honestly think it‚Äôs because Self-Care hasn‚Äôt been as popular now that the addition of no-healing-Meta Killers came out (Legion, Plague)
---
The most annoying part about Freddy for me honestly was the fact that people would wake up in front of you mid-loop because *everyone* was using Self-Care at the time. It made his power super underwhelming because you‚Äôd only sleep people for maybe 10 seconds if they were injured, before they proc a Skillcheck and go back to what they were doing.
---
I played Freddy a few weeks ago (Rank 11) and 4K‚Äôd easily.
---
That‚Äôs what makes her so good and she has multiple add-ons for her passive phasing. In my experience it doesn‚Äôt happen too frequently unless you use the add-ons. It‚Äôs also why she doesn‚Äôt have a window vault animation so you can‚Äôt tell whether she actually is vaulting or has Phased around.
---
He got lucky. There are only 2 lockers in the killer shack, if he doesn't know where you are, it only makes sense to check the lockers. He had a 50% chance to choose the correct one on the first try and he did.
---
I don't know any statistics about that (I'm not the person who replied to you earlier), and I also don't think that info is public. But she does have passive phasing in her base kit. And those add ons that you've found increase the frequency and duration of it, so it's assumed that it exists in the first place because it is something to be increased.
---
I do know that and I addressed it in my comment by saying: "If you haven't hit the survivor yet you'll almost always be using your power". If you haven't hit the survivor you should use feral frenzy 99% of the time, it just makes sense. Therefore if you aren't using your power, the survivor is probably already hit and you won't need to use your power again for a little bit- this means that it being put on cooldown on the off chance you get pallet stunned isn't a big deal. I hope that is more clear :).
---
It is not your fault really. I don't think the passive phasing is mentioned ingame at all which is an oversight to be honest.
---
I am not sure if anyone has actually put effort into statistics about her passive phasing, sorry.
---
Yeah, bro.. this is an exact repost.
---
Try again, OP.
---
That's true but in swf a ton of perks are useless, likes that bond perk goes from hella amazing to worthless. This game should have made the whole game feel more swf and then balanced it around that. Instead they balance it around solos, and then swf breaks everything, either one way or the other :/
---
Is that yours work?
---
Yeah but legally if they removed him you'd be entitled to a refund
---
I hope they make them different not just revert to how it was
---
Legion: üòí
---
Pig: üò≠
---
Yeah, really. It's to accommodate the endgame change, not rocket science. And traps always should have been paused when the Pig was near you or chasing you. It's just like the stupid shit with the Legion and Deep Wound that was changed so they couldn't harass you while letting your timer go down. People are just pissed they can't tunnel with the Pig anymore.
---
Lol üëç thiccen up booyyy
---
And it also causes *you* to have 4 seconds of downtime.
---
&gt;This sub doesn‚Äôt seem to care though
---
Dude are you fucking kidding me this sub is absolutely FLOODED with garbage memes and cry posts about the pig nerfs go back to the front page and open your eyes.*TRIGGERED*
---
THE NEW RANK SYSTEM IS DUMB. I LIKE THE OLD DAYS WHERE A 4K MEANT YOU DID A GOOD JOB. NOW IF YOU DONT LET THEM GEN SUCKERS RUN FOR A BIT AND GET UNHOOKED, YOU CAN GET A DISPLEASED RATING EVEN IF YOU 4K. IM A KILLER. MY JOB IS TO KILL. WHY ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED.
---
You explained it perfectly how this nerf is unnecessary.
---
Moreover we have the SWF factor, a good SWF team can very well manage to give support to a trapped survivor while they go try to remove the RBT, they can bodyblock Pig, bait hits, blind her, take hits for their friends or a combination of the four, giving enough time to search the Jigsaw box...
---
Also, even if more than one survivor get trapped, Amanda can't be guarding more than one box at a time, she would have to patrol boxes, giving time for survivors to complete the search and escaping
---
There is always a counterplay, even with more pressure from EGC or perks like Bloodwarden, NOED and Remember Me
---
I see. Hmmm
---
The hatch spawns when there's one person alive, it's not punishing you for doing well, it's giving that last person a tiny chance of escaping. I can't tell you how many times I've gotten 1.5 gens done and all my teamates are dead, and now I have no shot because I can't open the doors and the hatch hasn't spawned.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve seen 4ks from Freddy before, I said in my comment he still seems playable as in he doesn‚Äôt feel like a trash killer
---
There aren‚Äôt really any detailed descriptions about her passive phasing but this is from the DBD Gamepedia:
---
The Spirit occasionally performs a passive phase, leaving a trail of "still images" behind her, confusing Survivors about her movement.
---
Susie is bae
---
Yeah because missing a t is the same as confusing one word with another. I guess this is what you do when no one likes you.
---
I can‚Äôt tell if the second from the left is from absolver or deathgarden
---
Art
---
Your Nerf gun has been nerfed.
---
''Kate''
---
I would say the traps are meant to do both because that is literally how they functioned up until the recent changes. Also at high level gameplay pig never efficiently applied pressure because the jigsaw mechanic is flawed with rng. The only consistent power the killer has had is her ability to control the late game with her traps. Not to mention on smaller maps her pressure with traps got hit a bit too.
---
She definitely shouldn't be balanced around her ability to tunnel. Realistically if she manages to get a survivor trapped just before last gen is done she can still tunnel them to the ground in the exact situation you described. 
---
A lot of killers can tunnel in the late game with their insta-downs or strong chasing abilities but I don't believe they should be nerfed for it. Yes those killers can't physically keep people in the game like pig can but if they tunneled off a hook that was a mid sized distance from the exit gate they could easily just tunnel a survivor to death too. The only situation that doesn't work for is one where the survivor is hooked right next to the exit.
---
Exactly. Besides, her traps were never meant to be endgame users either. Sure, you could save one or two for that if the flow of the game dictated that but they were never meant to be things you never used until the gens were done. All of these people complaining otherwise, bullshit, rarely do you see Pigs use all of their traps at the end of game.
---
Heh I've been pallet stunned many times as Legion in frenzy and out.
---
You aren't the brightest, are you? She was already dead, Pig just decided to play with her a bit. She already lost; pig could just kill her right there. You're exaggeration is not relevant in any way shape or form and just shows that you are immature.
---
If it's a frog phone I'm actually okay with this
---
See and that's part of the problem that killers come across all the time especially on console.
---
Which why I as a killer will tunnel especially when I know survivors are running Mettle of Man and Borred Time
---
We don't use logic in these parts.
---
Yup. I get that old legion was a problem, but this ain't the way to fix it.
---
I really do feel like Frenzy as a concept is just a bad idea, and they need to change his power wholesale. Something like that locker teleporting idea that was floating around when he first came out
---
WHY THE FUCK WASNT MORE THOUGHT PUT INTO THE END GAME?! ALL THIS DOES IS FORCE SURVIVORS OUT AND ELIMINATE HATCH STAND OFFS. IF YOUR THE LAST PERSON CAUGHT WHEN ALL GENS ARE DONE YOUR STILL GOING TO GET CAMPED. THIS CHANGE DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO MAKE THE END GAME MORE INTERESTING AND FUN.
---
You wouldn't be. The TOS protects them from having to refund you anything for any reason.  It's mainly so they won't be 20 √ó X00,000 in debt when the game is discontinued, but it would go into effect here as well.
---
This post just made my heart hurt. It's ok Pam, I still love you.
---
The issue isn't *that one survivor* tho. This affects Legion's ability to target switch which is a part of their kit. If someone who was previously outside the range of Feral Frenzy entered it to work on a gen or something, and you got pallet stunned trying to down that other survivor, you have to wait *forever* for no good reason to use Feral Frenzy to target switch over to that other player
---
Frankly, it's just indefensible to not change this. It's not going to be a broken or OP feature and it'll help Legion with their now gutted ability.
---
I didn't say 1/10 were tunnellers I said he probably got tunneled by 1 in 10 pigs and now acts like they all do it.
---
FUCKING üÖ±Ô∏èEESECHURGER CHIMKEN NUMGET
---
NO BUT ACTUALLY I'M PISSED ABOUT HOW BHVR ALLOWS THE NURSE TO CONTINUE EXISTING IN HER CURRENT STATE DESPITE BREAKING FUCKING THE GODDAMN FORMULA OF THE GAME AND MAKING WALLS AND PALLETS IRRELEVANT, AND INSTEAD GOES AND FUCKING BACKSTABS THE PIG WITH SOME UNNECESSARY NERFS JUST BECAUSE HER POWER WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN A SORT OF BUFF WITH THE END GAME COLLAPSE AND THEY WERE ALL LIKE 'NOPE GOTTA CHANGE HER, BUT IT'S OKAY GUYS, IT'LL BE A "LOGICAL" CHANGE.' LIKE WHAT FUCKING RASPBERRY CUNTMUFFIN HAD THE AUDACITY TO MAKE THAT DECISION, AND WHAT KIND OF HONEY-ROASTED FUCKNUT DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO HEAR A COWORKER COME UP WITH THAT IDEA AND THINK TO YOURSELF THAT IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND WORTH THE TIME AND EFFORT IT TAKES TO IMPLEMENT? WE HAVE A KILLER LITERALLY TELEPORTING ON COMMAND, WHO IS COMPLAINED ABOUT CONSTANTLY AND FUCKING DOMINATES THE TOP RANKS, AND A WEAKER MID-TIER KILLER NOBODY EVER SAYS IS ANYTHING CLOSE TO OVERPOWERED, MAYBE EVEN UNDERPOWERED IN SOME CIRCLES, WHO IS GENUINELY FINE AND IN A GOOD PLACE WHERE THEY ARE IN THE GAME'S META, AND JUST BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE PROSPECT OF BEING MADE BETTER - NOT EVEN TOP TIER, JUST A STRONGER PICK - BHVR THINKS THEY'RE THE MORE MEANINGFUL FIX, AND IN TURN GIVE HER THE LEGION TREATMENT AND FUCK UP HER POWER. BUT WITH LEGION, IT WAS AT LEAST LITERALLY ASKED FOR AND NECESSARY TO INTRODUCE COUNTERPLAY OPPORTUNITIES, WHEREAS THE PIG'S POWER WAS ALREADY IN A PRETTY SOLID PLACE. IT'S LIKE SOMEONE ORDERED A STEAK AT A RESTAURANT AND INSTEAD THEY WERE GIVEN A VEGAN BURRITO. YOU DID SOMETHING NOBODY ASKED FOR AND MADE SOMETHING ALREADY FINE WORSE OFF THAN BEFORE YOU FUCKED WITH IT.
---
Hatch changes, sure, but the exit gate changes aren't.
---
IF QUITTERS DON'T WANT TO GET HIT EVEN ONCE,  THEY SHOULDN'T PLAY THE FUCKING GAME!!!!!!!!
---
Why wouldn‚Äôt you just down them? It just risks a them getting the hatch to let them keep running with a trap on head. Other than trolling I just don‚Äôt see a benefit, and if they are trolling they can still crouch in the new situation. 
---
I did a pig game last night, and in it I was carrying a Dwight to a hook, and nea got head popped between me and the hook. I realized that wouldn‚Äôt happen with the ptb changes. In no way was I influencing her ability to get it off, but somehow being next to the killer will be the safest place. Especially since they increased her terror when plague came out.
---
Will anybody in Westboro even recognize Freddy though?
---
I love how he does it when he gets hooked too.
---
Evil Within 69
---
Iron Will is great for stealth, but I left it off since she wants a distraction-themed build. I listed three perks, and the core perk is Diversion, so I didn‚Äôt want to drop that. Of course, you could substitute Lithe or something for Iron Will. It‚Äôs a good perk
---
What a strange decision to make! Hm. Well I hope there's some consideration for endgame pig play in the works.
---
Jesus 7k shards for the mask? God.

I didn't even tell you what level I am beyond 50 buddy.

I can see why people are saying my bloody valentine, but honestly with the axe, vest, giant muscles, and gasmask all I can think of is Krieg
---
Listen here Susie wears leggings like a basic white girl while Julie wears all black and listens to depressing music because she‚Äôs a rebel murderer
---
Right now, all this does is nerf an already weak mechanic. If the devs are gonna keep these changes and make the bear traps less viable in endgame then at least give Pig mains more incentive to use the RBTs in the early game.
---
Since it only lasts for a minute &amp; survivors have 3 minutes to escape the trial, there is nothing game breaking about it. 
---
Even then if the killer hooks someone, the timer slows down which usually gives the survivors enough time to escape. 
---
There is nothing game breaking about it unless the Devs decide to make the EGC like 1.30 &amp; BW is activated for 60 seconds. Even then the survivors have 30 seconds where they can just leave through the exit gate. More so if a survivor is hurt or hooked. 
---
If survivors have stayed in long enough for BW to activate &amp; trap them in the game long enough for the auto-sacrifice, it's not game breaking its the survivor's misplay that they decided to waste their time running around for 2 minutes instead of leaving the trial like they should be doing.
---
These ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù are not worth the nerfs. Also, knowing BHVR, these are unintentional and will be ‚Äúfixed‚Äù like how Legion can‚Äôt see the deep wound timer, Pig won‚Äôt be able to see RBT timers
---
But she doesn‚Äôt have a thicc ruler
---
Billy chainsaw hitbox is still insane. It's no longer the aoe nuke it used to be (anyone remember people saying the flick was some high skill ceiling move when they got rid of it?).

---
The "survivor can't be grabbed from the hatch" is only true during the collapse. In a chase without the gates being opened, the killer would close the hatch or if the survivor risked it, they get their grab.
---
Maybe you shouldn‚Äôt have been relying on the traps to compensate for not playing well during the match
---
but are you thiccc?
---
You can still easily counter BW by 99% a door in case someone is being chased and finish opening it as soon as the person gets hooked.
---
There is nothing game breaking about BW let alone EGC.
---
But he has been through at least 150 blood webs and still no bbq. Maybe you‚Äôll get it this time.
---
That‚Äôs right she needs a mans, while susie is a stronk independent wahmen
---
Used to be a nurse main until I got bored of the game and started using different killers. I never use any addons or offerings with her because I already feel like she's so good. Having ONE extra blink is overkill but getting up to 5? Survivors have absolutely no chance if the nurse is experienced. Once you have the ranges down and memorized it's almost a 4k every game.

FUCKING FREEZE MISSILES. IMAGIBE A KILLER THAT COULD THROW FREEZING MISSILES. THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING TO RAGE ABOUT. LIN KUEI KILLER WHEN?!

I agree with you on that, they definitely seem to be cutting some corners by just nerfing her rather than changing her. Hopefully they come up with a better solution than what's currently being implemented.

No she didn‚Äôt, she manipulated frank to do her dirty work because she a bad biotch

Yeah because you're seeking affirmation from other comments and feeding them false info about me so I'm correcting you thank you very much. Go back to complaining about spelling because you got caught out in an argument. I never said ''No I'm right'' so don't lie and pls leave.
---
I played Legion and thought they felt much weaker personally, im not agreeing with the "they're dead" trend, they just feel worse and boring to play
---
DLC go on sale (30% usually) on every major Steam sale, around every chapter release (every 3 months) and on free weekends. So, quite often
---
I do think that they should work on gate spawns, though. In almost every match I had last night, the gates spawned within view of one another. If killer finds hatch first, he just camps the gates for three minutes until the Entity kills the remaining survivor. I haven‚Äôt played the EGC yet because I‚Äôm a console player, so I‚Äôll try to refrain from actually judging it until it‚Äôs out.
---
Listen here thanos has nightmares about susie, and he prays to the entity that she doesn‚Äôt yeet his ass

I think you should look at what you just said. He's not that powerful but he's powerful enough to be seen to have multiple exploits. However, I do agree with you with the change that should of been done.

OVERNERFING YOUR MID TIER KILLERS JUST RESULTS IN PEOPLE WANTING STRONG KILLERS NERFED. BVHR. SERIOUSLY. AT THIS RATE THE COMMUNITY JUST WANTS EVERY SINGLE KILLER TO BE LOW TIER.

Two, German and English and quite frankly there's 0 reason to learn any other language besides English. Chinese is only used in 1 country, Spanish/Portuguese are only used in shithole countries and the same goes for French (enjoy getting raped and killed in Africa).
---
English is used online and that will never change.

If you wanna be fancy you can learn more than 2 languages and get a job that involves those languages, but that aside learning more than 2 is pointless since you'll never get to use them on a regular, basis making them trivial.

On a side note I find it funny how assblasted people get when someone's "rude". Calling someone a moron is pretty tame and you guys all get riled up over it, it's pretty hilarious.

NURSE IS FINE
---
Uuuuuuh \*- \* I love it. Especially the Image in my Head, of the hooded killer with an old, rusty lamp approaching through the shadows.  
---
But that Hex: Illumination seems to be way too strong, as it not only punishes survivors for doing the things, they should do, without any tradeoff the Killer has to take, but even guarentees a hook, if someone cleanses the totem. I honestly cant think of something to improve there right now. But i have an other idea:  
---
Hex: Illumination  
---
The Light bends to your will. Upon completing a generator, every survivor nearby gets blinded for 2/3/4 seconds. Once all generators got completed, all survivors get blinded for () seconds.  
---
Additionally, i think the idea with the puppets is just great. I find the lack of new, interesting items very disappointing. And i have one puppet to add:
---
Vodoo Poppet (Rare):
---
"Something you made out of wood and grass found by the campfire. Someone put needles in it, for whatever reason. In the trial, give it to another survivor, and it will transfer two hits made to that person to you. After that, it vanishes."
---
Fixed
---
The knife is better
---
Lol I agree. These guys are so hive minded with concept of the Pig. I think your take is the most accurate but no one is mentally strong enough to accept things they don't like.
---
do they still think he's unfair or is it just their habit now?
---
The main issue with the Pig nerfs is that A: the option of having a late game is gone and B: some of these changes have NOTHING to do with EC. They just legion‚Äôd her RBTS for no reason
---
I appreciate you understand that Killers have no counter play in the endgame. Please understand that a lot of the frustration about these changes is that Killers hoped any sort of endgame rework would add that counter play. The fact that it seems designed explicitly not to is distressing. The fact that it comes with nerfs is infuriating. 
---
Here‚Äôs the thing: no matter where the door spawns it inevitably spawns in behind some sort of jungle gym in order to break line of sight. As such, it‚Äôs not terribly hard for survivors to hide especially if they‚Äôre running urban evasion or any other good stealth perk. Even now, the Killer can‚Äôt afford to make an intricate search of the area around the doors because performing any sort of search would be tantamount to surrendering the other door. It‚Äôs also not uncommon for survivors to open up both doors to maximize their points ‚Ä¶ or perhaps just to *make* a point. Furthermore, as long as survivors are healthy and the Killer isn‚Äôt running NOED there really isn‚Äôt incentive for survivors to leave until the last seconds. 
---
I understand you seem to think these mechanics were tested but to me it seems like they‚Äôve just finished the assets and are rushing to implement them into the game in a way that least upsets the present meta. Any sort of testing would have brought to light present problems in the game and forced them to be addressed. The Endgame Collapse as presented on the PTB addresses almost none of these problems.
---
It wasnt that legion was strong, it was that his ability to moonwalk broke the game. If you didnt exploit moonwalking legion never was super powerful. Everyone was asking for a fix to moonwalking, not a nerf bat.
---
You should be doing stuff in the dream transition to mislead the survivor, thats your problem. Still even after 3 years healing infront of Fred is still a thing and it's silly.
---
I JUST THERE NOW FOUND OUT WHY PEOPLE RUN FLASHLIGHT, FUCKING CLAUDETTE CAUGHT ME TWICE TRYING TO PICK THIS GUY UP AFTER HE RAN INTO A TRAP I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT WAS A FUCKING GARBAGE ITEM AND NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY PEOPLE ACTUALLY RAN IT, KILLED TWO OF THEM BUT STILL LOST A PIP CAUSE OF HOW QUICK THEY GOT GENS DONE FUCK DWIGHT YOU TEACHING FUCK GO BACK TO SCHOOL YOU DICK
---
this art is really good
---
In theory. In practice, active traps aren‚Äôt stopping survivors from escaping either.
---
Ok guys, it's time to be honest.
---
WE are The Entity.

Who else is forcing the killers and survivors to run around for amusement? Who else feeds on the hope of survivors!? IT IS US! IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN US!!!

oh no 5 seconds im quaking in my boots....

I mean don't get me wrong, the change is really random and weird and I don't quite understand it, **nor do I agree with it** but some people are acting like it's the end times for killers...
---
I liked the old version :(
---
TELL THEM TO STOP BEING EASY TARGETS. TUNNELING, ESPECIALLY OFF THE HOOK, USUALLY HAPPENS BECAUSE SURVIVORS ARE DOING CHEEKY UNHOOKS AND BEING OVER CONFIDENT. THE YOUNGER SIDE OF THIS PLAYERBASE IS REALLY FUCKING ANNOYING.

UNDERRATED COMMENT. YELLOW RANK PEOPLE RAGE FAR LESS THAN RED RANK TRYHARDS.
---
Its because she wasn't top tier and felt balanced. She was just a fun killer at times with a decent end-game.
---
I find the lithe, quick and quiet, dance with me combo only hides me from the killers sight. Iron will just makes me invisible to the killers ears too. I‚Äôd say 4/5 times I vault, the killer loses me, I just gotta be smart about line of sight after a vault. But with the core being diversion I suppose there isn‚Äôt a need for iron will if you run one way and pebble the other way. (Quick mention, best way to use pebble is throwing it directly in the killers face after a pallet, the first time someone did that to me was one of the funniest experiences I‚Äôve had in this game)
---
That is true.
---
My Haddonfield games where they spawn literally 20 feet from each other on the same side of the map beg to differ with you. RIP me.
---
Lmap imagine these devs listening to player suggestions and feedback, the only apparent group who knows how the game plays.
---
then there's no reason to shorten the time required to open exit gates, nor is there a need to nerf The Pig, or Remember Me. yet that's what's happening.
---
Lool you want to think that you're being downvoted by one person don't you?   Sad.
---
Laughing?  I think you're crying. That's why you're repeating the same thing over amet over again.
---
&gt; I think what they could do that wouldn't nerf the pig and make it fair would be to stop the egc timer altogether 
---
This is the obvious solution
---
She moves very slowly when crouched so you lose a lot of time moving around that way and her view is extremely lowered so it‚Äôs harder to see people around you.
---
In Glen0ck's post, which I linked in my rant above, they ran the numbers for the number of survivors out of 500 who got the trap off on the first attempt, second attempt, etc. The total number of RBTs removed on the first try, out of 500 applied, was around 237, IIRC. That's just under 50%. And the percentage of people who got the trap off on the second try was around 25%, half the percentage. This trend follows down the line to 4 tries, failing to escape, and even DCing (50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, 3.125%, ~1%). Each percentage is around half the previous percentage, implying that if you fail the first try, your next try has a 50% chance out of the remaining chances to be the one that frees you (100% - 50% = 50%; 25% is half of the remaining 50%, etc.). So if my knowledge of statistics is what I feel it is, that does indeed suggest that it depends less on the actual box you go to and moreso on a 50/50 chance as to whether you are freed or not. The sample size of 500 RBTs applied to Survivors is by no means small, so it's unlikely that 237 of them just so happened to be so lucky as to pick the right 'pre-determined' box first time. It looks like the whole 'pre-determined correct box' thing isn't true at all, and that's what Glen0ck's little experiment seems to suggest. 
---
TL;DR Based on the evidence from Glen0ck's experiment I linked above, yes, it appears that there is no guaranteed correct box, rather there is just a 50/50 chance to be freed or not (without addons that affect the boxes; Glen0ck specifically said they took the Last Will addon which merely grants an extra RBT). As to the minimum number of boxes, I'm not entirely certain; the DBD Wiki doesn't mention any number, let alone minimum. But either way, the statistics show that 50% of people escape on the first box, while ~6% of people have to complete all 4 boxes to escape, so presumably it is a default of 4 boxes unless one takes Amanda's Letter, Jigsaw's Sketch, and/or Jigsaw's Annotated Plan.
---
This has nothing to do with the game
---
Or have two different timers. When the killer stops the hatch you have 2 mins, but when the gates open you have 1 min
---
THE PEOPLE ON THE OFFICIAL FORUMS ARE SO HORRIFIC THAT THEY MAKE THE SUBREDDIT LOOK WELL-ADJUSTED AND LOGICAL.
---
How often do u see a moonwalking Pig?
---
I FEEL LIKE THE GAME ENCOURAGES TUNNELLING TO AN EXTENT, I MEAN SPLIT YOUR TIME BETWEEN CHECKING GENS WHEN SOMEONES ON HOOK BUT TRY TO STAY CLOSE ENOUGH YOU CAN CATCH UP WHEN THEY GET OFF HOOK, SO MANY PEOPLE JUST HANG AROUND HOOK AND WAIT FOR YOU TO FUCK OFF SO WHY SHOULD I RUN ALL THE WAY ACROSS THE MAP TO CHECK ONE GEN WHEN THE THREE OTHER SURVIVORS ARE JUST WAITING FOR ME TO LEAVE THE HOOK AND NOT DOING OBJECTIVES
---
"U mad?"
---
Thank you for bringing this to light. They very well probably tested this and it mustn't have worked out for one reason or another.
---
&gt; She can very very easily exploit the egc mechanic for free kills if she was by simply putting active traps on people and just following them(not chasing) until egc kills them.
---
She has to chase and down them. If she's able to chase and down them, then she could just facecamp them to the same effect, and nothing's been done to prevent that. In fact, because the RBT no longer keeps a person in game, she will have more incentive to down and facecamp folks.
---
Stage 1 and 2 on a hook take two minutes. RBTs expire in two and a half. If she is absolutely intent on that kill, then it's in her interests to sit and stare.
---
Putting an RBT on someone does free you up to chase down other survivors, but they ought to be away, working on doors during the collapse. If they present themselves to her blade and get an RBT, then they do deserve a difficult escape.
---
I dont wnat it myself, but i wish you all who wants it that they get it, i would 100% give every ming with the bunny the hatch, no strings attached ! Literaly pay to win !
---
All the "second chance perks" and one exhaust perk that speeds you up, in some way

Or at least basically what I thought I said

Completely agree

So a toxic af build..?

How about the funny joke of reworking his pin add-ons to apply status effects to survivors with deep wounds, but hitting them brings them out of Frenzy and depletes their bar.
---
Yikes. That insecure about how you look to others?

You can't make me do anything. You are free not to respond if you want. But I'd continue responding as long as you do.

Oh wow you mean someone has to look down before sticking their hand in a bear trap ow OWIE what a nerf Oof ow. Go cry elsewhere.

I always run Adrenaline, Balanced Landing/Dead Hard, Hope and WGLF, but IMO a stronger build now would be Deliverance, MoM, DS and Dead Hard/BL

Balance Changes:
---
THE TRAPPER and THE HAG-
---
Traps will no longer trigger on survivors if they are within terror radius. There was no room for counter play for a survivor if a trap was placed at a pallet and the survivor was in the middle of a chase. This change has been made accordingly.
---
Of course it had to be a Leatherface. :)
---

I AM MAD ABOUT THE THE PIGS UPCOMING NERFS. WHY THE FUCK IS THE PIG BEING NERFED? THE UPCOMING UPDATE WAS THE ONE CHANCE SHE HAD TO BE HIGHER TIER AND NOW ITS GONE.
---
Imho traps shouldn't have been changed for endgame. At least if we're talking about gens being powered for endgame, you get three minutes to check boxes after the exit gate is open+The timer practically doubling when someone is downed/hooked. I also don't think they should have had it so that the timer stops in her terror radius, especially with how tiny some maps are as it encourages nothing but crouched Pig. (Which, don't get me wrong, I don't think people actually use crouch to it's full potential most the time, but if you're in the chase with another survivor, it shouldn't start effecting everyone's RBTs.)
---
But you are right the terror radius trap thing won‚Äôt stop people who really want to follow a trapped survivor they‚Äôll just crouch and follow.
---
Like i get the distraction part of a build but why do people just love being toxic dude i dont get it
---
R.I.P Pig hopefully all these posts will make BHVR reconsider these changes.
---
I want to throw what you did

Grab is gone. Can't pull people out of hatch.

---
Because it was a freaking mending simulator, he sees you, he's gonna hit you and there was basicly nothing you could do about it except pallet in the face. So even in the games were u steam rolled legion, the games simply were no fun.
---
Well u said u wanted to taunt the killer in the post title so naturally that raises some red flags
---
It's a team game. 2 gens is a stupid easy thing to accomplish. So yes.
---
Weird way to spell frank
---
You say toxic, I say just playing the fucking game
---
Adrenaline - Allows you to insta-hela when all the gens are done. Amazing perk that you can never go wrong with.
---
Dead Hard - Allows you to significantly extend a chase with a killer. Allows you to recover from mistakes during loops or to extend a loop further with the killer.
---
Balanced Landing - Great exhaustion perk for making the chase last longer &amp; allowing you to use loops with heights to extend a chase. Think Meat plant drops area. You have the potential to use that as a looping spot due to 75% reduced stagger. Can be a good substitute for Dead hard.
---
Bond - Allows you to avoid running to gens that teammates are working on so the killer is not encouraged to peel away from you during a chase. Also allows you to find someone to heal you if injured.
---
Mettle Of Man - Allows you to tank an extra hit during a chase. Will need someone to heal you though if you do not want to be hooked. Great perk for extending chases against most M1 killers.
---
Legion is fun if you enjoy ruining others day
---
&gt; they either 1. Didn‚Äôt even try to test changes to balance her without making her traps and power useless.
---
It's almost like that's what the PTB is for?
---
So, not being fluent in a second language is a third world problem in a group of 1st world countries? Just saying mate, you gotta take your head out of your arse and realise Britain doesn't have an empire anymore. I'm British myself you utter wanker, and I'm ashamed to have anyone like you represent the country or our language. I'm sure anyone of your nationality feels the same.
---
Imagine if they escape with traps on they carry the trap on their character and next game they play they start with the trap on. Finishing a gen starts it like usual but there's no jigsaw boxes to take it off unless they're facing the pig. Guaranteed sacrifice. If you D.C. The trap is spawned in all your survivors and it won't leave until you play a full match with it.
---
Frank is Julie‚Äôs bae tho so he‚Äôs good
---
I'm not looking to be toxic, I just want a build that is designed to get and keep the killers attention so my teammates can complete gens.
---
So teabagging is a ‚Äúnormal part‚Äù of a game where ur being hunted down by a deadly killer?
---
When the generators are powered...  
---
Trapper - Traps will disarm and turn into healing stations .   
---
Doctor - Electric field now charges players' flashlights .   
---
Wraith - The charge of the generators prevents invisibility . 
---
Come on BHVR, don't stop now!
---
Why is Legion so high ? Missed attacks in Frenzy depletes his power, pallets stuns depletes his power, M1 hits depletes his power, everything depletes his power now. Without stacking cooldown add-ons, he is useless, and even with cooldown add-ons is not that good if survivors don't messed up. 
---
I would say that Spirit is higher than Huntress because Spirit has more mobility and counter looping better than Huntress, but, with Mettle of Man being a thing, I can understand why some people would put Huntress higher than Spirit ... because Huntress can counter it and Spirit can't. But again, Spirit still have more utility than Huntress and she can take advantage of aura from Mettle of Man.
---
I would put Clown, Trapper and Doctor lower and Wraith and Plague a little bit higher.
---
You gotta a point there, team Frank and Julie
---
Not exactly. If you play against competent and coordinated survivors without a top tier killer, you can be whoever u want but they still gonna do gens :) ofc this does not apply with a nurse against potatoes
---
I DON'T PERSONALLY MIND NURSE OR THINK SHE NEEDS NERFED OR REWORKED BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT IF ANY KILLER WAS SO STRONG THEY DESERVED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF NERF IT WOULD BE HER. AS BRICKY ONCE SAID, "THE NURSE IS THE PRODUCT OF EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG WITH DEAD BY DAYLIGHT." SHE LITERALLY NEGATES THE SURVIVOR'S MAIN LINES OF DEFENSE AGAINST KILLERS BECAUSE SHE BLINKS RIGHT THROUGH THE TERRAIN, SAME AS HOW THE DOCTOR NEGATES STEALTH WITH HIS STATIC FIELD AND MADNESS AND THEN STILL HAS THE ABILITY TO PREVENT THEM FROM DOING ACTIONS LIKE VAULTING, DROPPING PALLETS, UNHOOKING, ETC. I'M A KILLER MAIN MYSELF BUT YOU HAVE TO ADMIT, NURSE IS STUPID STRONG IN THE HANDS OF TOP TIER PLAYERS.
---
The not virgin gang üòé
---
Just playing the game would be hitting me with a pallet and continuing the chase rather than stopping and tbagging for no reason whatsoever lol, its called have manners and respect for one another
---
What the fuck are you talking about? The article mentions nothing about the tutorial or not knowing how to jump.
---
THE PIG ADJUSTMENTS ARENT EVEN THAT BAD
---
Propaganda
---
Talking about grabbing off of gens and hooked people, you will start the animation to grab them off the gen, and then not, for some reason.
---
If your playing Nurse and you blink to someone to grab them, you will do both the wipe and fatigue animations
---
Y‚Äôall mind if I waddle around
---
Avengers has me freaked out anytime I see the word "endgame" on reddit.
---
Who said anything about teabagging...kiting the killer isn't toxic
---
So next time just say distraction build, there is no need to be toxic to be a "distraction"
---
It also makes sense lore wise they the entity would let Amanda play her... "Game"...
---
But, thing is, if you have Ruleset 2 or annotated plan (Or both), you can have everyone with a bear trap before the last gen goes off, then the traps all trigger
---
Then, you can open the door to trigger the collapse, and focus on crouch chasing them away from Jigsaw boxes, ticking down two death timers at once
---
True and being facecamped and tunneled suck in there own right but she could potentially use egc to exploit and kill 2 active rbt survs if she is good enough, not to mention just following someone until the game itself kills them for you seems like it would be on another level of toxicity. There is counterplay to being facecamped, there to some extent is hope but having an rbt and no way put with a killer following you until the game kills you and rewards the killer for thag kind of play is just not good.
---
Flashlight. Dead Hard, Sprint Burst.
---
Repost day opd stuff nice
---
Never said that. I was talking about his qualification as a gaming journalist. But you don't seem to want to talk about this, ignoring my whole post, lmao. Goodbye.
---
And yet killers keep having their main advantages over the survivors degraded. At this rate BHVR is going to make it so that the clown no longer slows down survivors that get hit with the tonic.
---
Killers get all the buffs to their perks every patch. All the changes always benefit killers. Yet somehow mongoloids still cry survivors are OP. What do survivors have that‚Äôs OP exactly? Body blocking is a detriment to your own life. Flash lighting is risky and easily countered with a simple head flip. Gen rushing can be countered with perks or actually knowing how to play the game. Looping is easy to stop if you don‚Äôt mind game yourself and keep swinging early. Killers are faster, have tons of aura reading, and a simple hard counter to everything survivors can possibly do. BUT SURVIVOR OP NERF PLS DURRRR.
---
You trusted the jedi, that is your problem.
---
It‚Äôs rare to go against a clown
---
imo I bet they feel like stopping the timer entirely defeats the purpose but I think it would be fair to leave that decision up to the player
---
Flashlight spam? I would argue that‚Äôs toxic when every time you down someone, another runs up with a flashlight. U can only dodge so many
---
Meg has a super masculine jawline in this, wow.
---
Oh yeah, that shit has been busted forever. It seems it's especially bad on Nurse. No worse feeling than making the read and blinking to the other side of a pallet. Then starting the grab animation then it stops and you swing, but hit the pallet somehow.
---
Doesn‚Äôt resilience do something similar? But I would love it if it was reworked like that. I‚Äôve had it for a while and didn‚Äôt get a chance to try it out.
---
SHE JUST REQUIRES A DIFFERENT STYLE OF JUKING.
---
It's meant to stop standoffs, and make hatch no longer HEAVILY favour the survivor
---
No, I misunderstood. Read my edit, I thought you were talking about the sekiro dude, not the cuphead dude. I agree the cuphead journalist is a giant idiot.
---
Well I read somewhere that sabing hooks is a global against the killer, so I would assume that anything that "Taunts" the killer would make them more likely to target you.
---
Have you seen the double jungle gym pallets tho!?
---
Yes, it has exploits. But it's not powerful at all if you don't use said exploits.
---
Dude if they looked this good with the current optimization Our Computers would blow up and BHVR will open a black hole in the universe due to how much Energy there pcs are creating

---
THEY SAID I WAS CAMPING A HOOK, DUDE, THERE IS ONE OF YOU ON IT, ONE OF YOU IN DYING STATE AND I AM FREDDY WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO LEAVE? AND I WILL "TUNNEL" YOU IF YOU ARE OBSESSION AND I HAVE REMEMBER ME.
---
Lol i could less than 15 shits about sabing hook...they come back now and if you dont run some type of grip perk which is very rare for at least me welp sucks to suck is my viewpoint about
---
Idk about that though someone did a study of 500 rbts it showed it was a 50/50 chance on each box.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/agpne1/feb_5th_we_will_all_work_together_beause/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
I agree, bc it really isnt fair to the pig that her power is literally useless at endgame. I feel like the trap terror radius change was done bc of their broken chase mechanic, and they were doing it to legion so they figured the pig needed it to.
---
Speaking as someone from Michigan this is GREAT news for me!
---
&gt;True and being facecamped and tunneled suck in there own right but she could potentially use egc to exploit and kill 2 active rbt survs if she is good enough
---
How is it an exploit if two survivors got downed and neither, apparently, is intent on removing the hat? The Pig can't be in two places at once. She can't patrol the boxes in such a way to keep two folks permanently off them.
---
If half of your team has been downed and hasn't dealt with the hats, then your team deserves sacrifices. They didn't magically get that way.
---
I GOT A 3K WITH 1 MORI ON COLDWIND BY SHEER STUPIDITY OF MY ENEMIES AND I BLOODY DEPIPED [SALT LEVELS CRITICAL](/intensifies)
---
Damn, why my pp hard
---
&gt; I feel like the trap terror radius change was done bc of their broken chase mechanic
---
What do you mean?
---
I still hate how most of the time people get the trap off the first box, like, you get 4 without addons the entire game and it takes them one box for the most part? That‚Äôs a stall of one person losing like 15 seconds.
---
Did.. he just say that good pig players... don‚Äôt rely on her crouch and RBTs... as in the only reason anyone would play Pig?!
---
On big maps, Hag really struggle, especially without Dried Cicada. Even Hag mains says that Rotten Fields or Shelter Woods are horrible for her, because they are too big, with very few choke points, they can't patrol gens and most of the time, they end up being a M1 killer with 110%.
---
People really shouldn't be playing Pug as an endgame specialist though. She is a far better stalling killer than endgame killer. Traps are best used to increase game time to get more hooks. When I play Pig, I rarely have games with 5 gens completed. I usually 4k the team before they can even get to the endgame.
---
It's part of the game... I mean Idk what to tell you.  People use the flashlight for what it's intended to be used for
---
Yeah but when your entire game looks like it‚Äôs trying to give u an eye exam, it gets really annoying
---
I haven‚Äôt had the privilege. The end game collapse seems awesome, and I‚Äôm loving how it will change the game form simple hatch stand offs and survivors who refuse to leave (killer main here). I‚Äôm just disappointed in how they‚Äôve been nerfing killers...especially the pig.
---
Ohhh so I wasnt crazy when I thought I saw a weird bubble-thingy walking through the generator aura
---
I'm actually cringing and shivering from that picture. Unsettling
---
somehow i didn't run into that, not yet at least
---
Sometimes I'm disappointed in the player base
---
and a rock 8 inches away with a nea crouched behind it
---
No, you said there's a ton of people who do not speak English so I said "there's also a ton of people who still shit in buckets, etc.".
---
Also fuck Britain and fuck your  shitty spelling for certain words. Also it's "ground floor" and not "first floor", Muhammad.
---
That‚Äôs like saying good Nurse players don‚Äôt rely on her Blink. Or Huntress doesn‚Äôt rely on hatchets
---
Hook everyone 3 times and land a total of 20 hits or something like that. but pretty much if you hook every one 3 times and kick a lot of gens you will get it
---
No no one said that.. You're weird af get some help.
---
He is not. Legion went from being the worst Killer to face as a Survivor to being a 115 Killer with a power that does nothing. That is not "pretty good". That's worse than most Killers. That's worse than even Wraith, because at least his power does *something.
---
That sounds so excessive....for what?
---
Frenzy is useless now. Feel free to tell me why I'm wrong.
---
Facts
---
&gt;Good pigs don‚Äôt rely on traps and crouching. 
---
lol what
---
Ah yes lets rely on these precisely average stats
---
It‚Äôs not gutted holy shit.
---
Ok so the 2 exploits would be a very niche situation where the boxes the 2 survs need are one the same side of the map. But there is potential there, she wouldnt have to down anybody just scare them enough to not get on a box until egc sacrifices them. Again very specific situation but i could see it.
---
you said it right you don't quite understand it. I am not a killer main but I know there were a lot of times where if I had 5 more seconds to open the door I would escape instead of getting hooked. So I see where people are coming from. Are they exaggerating with the amount of complaints like it is the end of the world? Maybe
---
I didn't say that but you clearly did make that account just to back yourself up it was literally just created you sad little boy. Cry laughing that you tried to point out someone else's spelling while spelling it wrong yourself lmfao
---
Is this a Shitpost?
---
Assuming he‚Äôs got the third tier of every perk aside from bamboozle on both pages that‚Äôs still only 89 bloodwebs you incompetent fuck xD
---
I don't blame people. Just because legion is weaker now doesn't make them more fun. Still a profoundly unfun killer to play against.
---
wait it was an actual comment lmao
---
Leatherface
---
PLAYING THE SHAPE AND HAVING EVERYONE DISCONNECT. I ONLY HAD TWO PERKS AND ONE ADD-ON THAT IS COMPLETELY BULLSHIT I SHOULD BEALBE TO PLAY WITHOUT GETTING PEOPLE DISCONNECTING FROM MY GAMES
---
Dude, are you refusing to talk to me? Alrighty then.
---
Tbh I‚Äôd say going after the injured person isn‚Äôt tunneling for most cases. Tunneling to me is when a killer targets a single survivor in a way that makes the killer do worse, I once body blocked a doc with a rando to help someone get away from the hook, the doc goes around (the path he was using was completely blocked with the two of us, despite the fact hitting either of us, would be better since even if we sprinted away we‚Äôd still be closer than the first person.
---
What if he was tie new killer coming out in a couple of months
---
Like legions nerf where the mend bar doesnt go down if you are in his TR, it used to be it only wouldnt go down if he was chasing you but this was broken, bc he can just moonwalk, stay far back or look down and it wont count as you being chased. It was a common exploit and wasnt very fair, thats why i think they changed it from a chase to being in the TR, Pig could also exploit this, however they usually didnt because it didnt pay off. I'm guessing it was just QOL they did to her at the same time as legion.
---
I wonder what killer will die next
---
SAME HERE BUT I ONLY SAW SOME ONE AND THEY WERE LIKE "FUCK THIS I LEAVEING YOU BUTT SAGINGTON.
---
It only kills if you get trapped in the last stretches of the EGC.
---
Sure, at that point the survivor is doomed, but they kinda deserve it at that point.
---
The gates were opened 3:00 ago, shoulda left then Claudy.
---
Completely possible, but the files have been in the game since 2016, around the time the Nurse came out. Not likely, but possible! It'd be interesting!
---
If you don't see the importance of a custom mori for Ash I can't help you, my dude.
---
I love survivor mains. They make the community so great.
---
True, but the fact of the matter is that it still severely hurts the Endgame playstyle, and combine that with the nerf that RBTs don't tick down in Terror Radius and you actually delete Box Master Pig from the game.
---
All that's left is Ambush/Stealth hybrid Pig, and as a player that likes to vary my builds that's pretty painful.
---
If a survivor refuses to risk the boxes, they deserve to die. That's not an exploit - that's a decision to die and a refusal to play The Game. Straight up Jigsaw right there.
---
We're really nerfing her powers so that two scared survivors who've already been downed at least once and haven't worked on their RBTs - and furthermore _refuse_ to work on their RBTs - can escape?
---
i dunno man i try and spread out my hooks equally and never use ruin so i often cede early game to a certain extent and thus can end up with a good number of people still alive near the end, good or bad game. that's just a shit metric you're using
---
Brilliant
---
FUCKING KILLERS IN RANK 15-16 WITH LEVEL 3 BBQ, RUIN, NOED AND NURSE'S PLUS PURPLE/PINK ADDONS
---
YES OF COURSE YOU FUCKING WON HEAVEN FORBID BOTH SIDES HAVE FUN OR ANYTHING RESEMBLING AN EQUAL CHANCE
---
ALSO GETTING A FARMING GAME WITH A HUGE AMOUNT OF POINTS AND STILL ONLY A SINGLE PIP THIS NEW RANKING SYSTEM CERTAINLY IS FUCKING GREAT AM I RIGHT
---
Legion's rework wasn't about getting better or worse though, just getting into the games playtime better. Which they are now.
---
Why are the thinking of lowering default time as well? 15 seconds just sounds like a bad change cause gates are really easy to get open safely.
---
EGC in all ways except the hatch closing mechanic is a nerf for killers. Reduced gate opening time? Lul.
---
I like your Legion ideas
---
Yeah, poor idea doing this, feels bad for all thoses. Was kinda dumb, especially since remember me doesn't affect the new mechanic.
---
Except Legion one. Fck this one.

She's more common on PC.

Good call on the title, a lot of people (myself included) would‚Äôve felt like you were criticizing the outcry.

If you can run and then dip into the grass then why are you bitching? Complain when they nerf the tall grass.
---
Myers is intermediate at mastering and I would say that Huntress and Spirit are very hard to master.
---
Mending simulator means nothing gets done and if nothing gets done then the killer benefits by killing survivors. This makes him strong.
---
It requires a safe unhook now, as opposed to just an unhook. Keeps people from farming their teammates.
---
JUST WAIT UNTIL THEY REALIZE THE PIG NERFS HAVE REMOVED HER INCENTIVE TO AVOID TUNNELING.
---
Welcome to DBD 2019.
---
You're a meme machine, sirrah!  The Entity thanks you!
---
The fact that you have to look down when you grab a trap isn't even what this thread is about, it's about the camera moving jankily after collecting a trap in PTB when before it was fine...
---
People who go full on try hard on any ptb*
---
100% This.
---
A good feeling in your tummy
---
they're just making shit up. scummy pig players don't try to cheese out the timer, they intentionally tunnel down trapped survivors, and tunnelers are gonna tunnel, pig or not
---
Honestly, I would find Franks Mixtape a possible add-on to increase his movement speed to the way it was prior to the nerf. Would allow the Legion to cover more distance with the Frenzy at the expense of using a very rare add-on. This makes Frenzy more useful.
---
Since Frenzy isn't lethal, I don't see the harm in having an add-on that increases movement speed. 
---
Personally, I think remember me should be reverted but instead have its effect disabled if the hatch is closed. It was the only perk really that allowed end game builds to be possible for killers.
---
Left Behind should allow survivors to open the doors faster if they are the last survivor in the match. Hell, even allow them to see the killers aura for like 10 seconds after the last survivor has died so that they can prepare for the end game.
---
Would make it a powerful but situational perk which is its purpose.
---
What‚Äôs that? Nurse is OP? Let‚Äôs spin the wheel
---
I complain bc it doesnt work past like rank 8.
---
Ye old af this bug but devs dont give a damn about
---
lmao, the trap has to be inactive for it to not kill them, aka you trap them after 5 generators are completed. once again, idiots on this reddit overreact and dont actually read patch notes.
---
Tbh I low key enjoy playing LF, I play him with "oingo boingo - no one lives forever" playing in the background and I cant help but smirk at his cute little dress shoes when hes breaking a pallet.
---
List of survivors who could totally beat the shit out of The Legion if The Entity weren‚Äôt coddling them, in order from highest to lowest level of shit beating:

Ash Williams

Bill Overbeck
---
David King

Laurie Strode
---
David Tapp
---
Jake Park
---
Nea Karlsson
---
Ace Visconti
---
Meg Thomas
---
Adam Francis
---
Oh, I see. I don't think moonwalking had anything to do with it. Everyone knows that scummy Pig players don't try and cheese the timer like scummy Legion players would
---
They nerfed the mobility. It's slower, takes longer to recharge, and fatigues you longer. Frenzy's only purpose is to get a surprise initial hit. Assuming the survivor is brain dead and doesn't see you coming.
---
Teacher killer? Tell me more
---
Well i think this emblem system was designed for long-fun-intense games. Killers screw themselves over when they slug a guy, hook another, down the next, and find the last guy. When a killer mows a team it hinders their bloodpoint gain and their emblems. You didnt give the game long enough to develop on the emblems. I like this because it encourages every one to play in a way that's fun for both sides but there are downsides
---
One of my favourites are on crotus prenn asylum. In the main building at one of the entrances there‚Äôs pallets around one loop it‚Äôs awesome
---
What even is the Nerf?
---
Ok the 2 survivors was more of a what if scenario, a very real, very toxic scenario however is exploit one survivor at egc. Like you said she could just down and facecamp and the outcome more than likely would be the same. But at least there is a chance. If she just stays far back following you when you have an rbt on and egc is counting down, you cant work on getting it off(well i guess you could and force her to down and facecamp you) basically all im saying is if you have an rbt she can exploit the game by psuedo-chasing you and letting egc get her a free kill, you have no option of running towards a gate or anything it is just death
---
To be fair, the guy has been streaming DBD for 5-6 hours a day, 6-7 days a week for 2+ years. There's only so much commentary left in the tank. I feel like people who highlight this are just looking for excuses to be rude/disrespectful.
---
Frenzy allows you to get an easy hit on one survivor and with killer instinct (which is now stronger due to increased terror radius) you can easily injure multiple survivors in quick succession.
---
I don't see how that is useless. If you don't want to here to from me you can watch good killers like Zubat/Marth or whoever you want really and they will tell you that Legion is still decent.
---
Setup traps in heavy traffic areas, via windows, unbroken pallets, and try to chase them towards traps.
---
awww this is cute
---
Why do you think Remember Me was a necessary change?
---
GETTING A LITTLE UPSET WITH PEOPLE DISCONNECTING WHEN THEY SEE IM DOCTOR
---
Your opinion. But I can't relate with a lot of this.
---
Dirt was nerfed along with base fatigue time. Cool down legion is dead.
---
No witch hunts
---
Distraction is an entire role in DbD, that's why we have beef cakes like David and hotties like Laurie. It's not toxic, it's the only other thing to do besides hide or fix gens. As a killer main I wish more survivors had an in my face kind of playstyle :)
---
wat
---
Putting a Survivor into injured state doesn't mean jack. If it did, Plague would be top tier.
---
Ohhhh yea! Drop chases as soon as they last longer than 20 seconds without you getting a hit and proceed to put down traps along common looping routes and gens! For example, if you can break a pallet during a chase, particularly next to a gen, do it and drop the case and trap the gen once more. Now they have to work on an "unsafe" gen! You REALLY want to avoid chases with her and surprise them with your traps as much as possible! Easier said than done, since it's a complete shift in killer chase mentality, but once you got it down the survivors will have a ROUGH game... No matter the rank!
---
I tend to hate playing against swf cause somehow I, as a bad rank 15 killer, constantly get matched against greens and purples when it‚Äôs a 4 man with only one person near my own rank.
---
On hit: bleed the target.
---
On miss: hit yourself.  Idiot.
---
Well obviously you would remove the timer reduction with feral frenzy
---
Wot? Nobody‚Äôs gonna be able to find this guy he‚Äôs not the only person with that name
---
So they push you to use her traps the way they were intended to be used as a slow down mechanic, and not a last minute death sentence, and it's not logical? Before the change you'd be able to wait until end game if you were losing and suddenly score a 4K if you get lucky.
---
It might not be popular, but it is most certainly logical.
---
thats rlly hot except whispers on nurse üòî
---
What if it were left how it is now where they could still escape from hatch, and if the killer chose to close the hatch, the trap deactivates? Or make the trap slow down the timer a bit?
---
That wasn't really a joke though...
---
The one that this cosmetic is based off? You know?
---
The idea that you can‚Äôt remove or even attempt the lock boxes until your RBT has started is a really nice idea imo. If you can get it on 2 survivors in between gens, then that will slow the game down considerably allowing for her to gets RBT on the other 2 surv. Creates a situation where you can down one surv, the other 2 are trying to remove the RBT and then the last has to go for the unhook or one of the RBT has to consider risking their timer. 
---
Also instead of removing the progression in the terror radius just slowing it down would be enough
---
yeah wow BHVR wtf???
---
IF SOMEONE UNHOOKS AND YOU GO OVER TO OUT SOMEONE BACK ON, AND I INLY FIND THE INJURED ONE, WHYDO PEOPLE GET SO MAD?
---
I see you've never played on The Game.
---
MY GAME KEEPS FUCKING CRASHING. ALL I WANNA DO IS LOOT SOME CHESTS AND A FEW MINUTES INTO THE GAME IT FREEZES UP. ALSO IF THE CRASHING STOPS I CANT WAIT FOR DEDICATED SERVERS SO I CAN START PLAYING MORE FREQUENTLY
---
I said it. You don't like it when others think negatively of you. That's why you are freaking out when people don't agree with you.
---
I try to but most of the time they either disarm the traps or see them and move to the next loop. Thanks for responding!
---
Well yeah, like i said maybe just a QOL change due to the chase mechanic kinda being broken honestly i dont get exactly why they did it
---
#PrayforAmanda
---
He's afraid if he looks up, he'll get nerfed too. So he's trying to mind his own business
---
Yeah a rework and a nerf are not one in the same.
---
At most you‚Äôre at level 87 (assuming everything is tier 3 aside from bamboozle and enduring) which I doubt quite a bit, so let‚Äôs go with 70. This guy was just trying to be nice, you got defensive, and now look like a bit of a douchey idiot lol. I hope you spend a million bp and actually lose count before you do get that bbq m8.
---
I still think the majority of distractions come from toxic survs.
---
I absolutely love playing as Freddy and, I'm just gonna say it, I don't really have any problems with him. He's a little add-on dependant, you wanna lower that transition time, but otherwise I have a blast and do well ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No. They don't. This would be like Trapper dropping his traps on the ground if he gets stunned. Or Myers dropping from EW2 to 1.
---
Uhhh did you read the notes? Unless they just changed dirt is up to a full second.
---
Not gonna hop into the argument, but you‚Äôre literally ignoring what OP is saying. He‚Äôs flat out said that his problem is that he doesn‚Äôt find PTB Legion fun, responding with ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a solid mid tier killer‚Äù refutes that in no way.
---
It works both ways. Period.
---
Wow, great job man. Can u do one with sad spirit?
---
Oh alright. I thought you intended to be rude. Its all good!
---
I don't be teabagging and still get camped lol
---
IF I CAN'T SEE THE UNHOOKER BUT THE INJURED SURV IS JUST RUNNING AROUND IN FULL VIEW YOU BET YOUR ASS YOU'RE GETTING BACK ON THE FUNTOWER
---
UM
---
We will carry you, brother. Because all P3 players are wonderful team players ;) jk have fun
---
Injuring survivors does mean something. It wastes a lot of time if they heal and if they don't they are 1 hit K.O.
---
&gt;If it did, Plague would be top tier.
---
Plague is a decent killer. Certainly not top tier but not bad either. Legion is also better at injuring multiple survivors at once and better at mindgames due to his small size.
---
Why can't she use her power to patrol? Also, yes, she is better on indoor maps because hillbilly can't move around the map as easily. Also, why the passive aggression? I thought I was very reasonable.
---
Same thing happened to me when I talked about Mettle Of Man. People seem to just not think ahead or analyze anything until they really feel the issue. There‚Äôs no foresight.
---
someone said this at the very beginning and got downvoted to oblivion for not having a "fuck the devs" opinion at the time
---
Haha this has never happened to me but it sounds hilarious
---
Ah yes, how horrible to cancel a Power and chase.
---
Ok, well aside from exploits or what have you there is also the limited time you have to search boxes, and actually escape. Egc was added to stop toxic bming survs from trolling the killer, also to answer to hatch standoffs not to nerf or buff the other side. Rbts as they were are a direct buff to pig with egc. As i said what they did to her is too much but to have it go back just wouldnt be balanced for this nee mechanic
---
Wasn‚Äôt there a Jeff outfit too?
---
... Wraith does uncloak when he's stunned. My point was that you shouldn't expect to constantly be able to use your power in a chase. Wraith certainly can't use it to any practical effect, and Freddy and Pig are literally M1 killers in chases.
---
False. Fuck the pig. I‚Äôd be perfectly happy if they nerfed her out of the game for good.
---
No they won't because there are two windows so you can interchange forever.
---
OH, THAT‚ÄôS BECAUSE EVERYTHING ON CONSOLE HAS I BE APPROVED. IT WOULD TAKE LOTS OF EFFORT JUST TO DO THAT. IT‚ÄôS BASICALLY SAVING TIME AND RESOURCES IF THEY DON‚ÄôT
---
Don't hate the players, hate the game! Literally! Haha. Matchmaking is fucked I'm afraid. You'll get better someday &lt;3
---
You don't have to heal as Survivor, it's a waste of time. If you're healing, you're not playing as well as you can be. And having Survivors be a one hit KO also doesn't matter, because you can be looped for days in any case.
---
I have a slight **inclination** that these survivors had a build that **tilted** Myers, and it was probably a SWF
---
Hey, at least if you die early you can spectate and maybe learn from them.
---
Also, I've played a couple hundred hours and I'm still just awful.
---
What exactly changed about Coldwind?
---
Cute tho ;)
---
u/ROC-1
---
This is normal?? One of the two is unsafe anyway. The worst ones are the rare double pallet jungle gyms that have been popping up recently.
---
That's funny I didn't know everything you say about other people must be true.. No one is freaking out here bud think you're losing it.
---
This is due to a variety of reasons. 
---
Karma doesn‚Äôt matter in the first place. 
---
However this sub hands out upvotes and downvotes inconsistently. A comment that wouldn‚Äôt get DV‚Äôd three days ago gets praised today. Stuff flips like a light switch here.
---
Any idea how swf matchmaking even works rank wise?
---
No the remember me changes are not okay.
---
I agree with the first part. You just gave up though and I thought I should point that out.
---
Seriously BHVR remove the nerf, the pig was the one killer i enjoyed playing against cause she could come out of nowhere. Don't weaken an already weak killer. As a survivor main i mean this.
---
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT BUT IT MAKE SENSE. THANKS FOR THE INSIGHT
---
Is it possible to make the EGC effect extend outwards to region outside the exit gate? Now it looks aesthetically inconsistent.
---
Try to avoid the "obvious" placement. Instead of right outside the shack window, set the trap halfway between the window and the corner, where the survivor will run after vaulting. Don't set a trap under a pallet, but along the loop where the survivor will be running.
---
Oh really?  Clearly?  Do you have proof?  You know I can sue you for defamation if you are wrong. So where's this proof? 
---
I think you are on the verge of breakdown. If you are this neurotic about people not liking your online post, you'd have difficulty in actual life.
---
Fail
---
tbf most of this subreddit has
---
1. no idea what they're talking about
---
2. way too reactionary responses to everything that happens 
---
so i get it
---
i agree
---
Wraith I didn‚Äôt know, (never happened to me) and pig still has decent abilities, the rush is like frenzy (but better in certain situations) and she has RBT, while legion had essentially nothing.
---
Plus I ain‚Äôt talking about Freddy, we all know he‚Äôs shit and needs the rework.
---
Nurse with Ruin. I'd quit too.
---
I think that is too fast because you can out-speed survivors and follow them with traps on.
---
I would but Nurse's and getting Billy for enduring because Billy is super fun anyway
---
WE MAY GET THERE SOMEDAY.
---
High priority areas include but are not limited to, low wall loops, main set piece windows (like that one window in Groaning Storehouse.), loops near gens, and  if you do all of this, make sure to have a few traps in tall grass. Places where you *know* survivors are gonna go. Places like Haddonfield alleys. Survivors can‚Äôt move forward without disarming it. Sometimes traps aren‚Äôt gonna be used and that‚Äôs fucking great. Sometimes traps are just used to close off areas. For example, you are chasing a survivor and they run into the Haddonfield alley. They see the trap but since I‚Äôm right behind them they can‚Äôt do anything about it. They have to get downed or l take the hit.
---
Grass. Grass is your friend. Hide traps amongst the grass.
---
Also try to get a easy patrol route towards final gens. "If it reaches that far in" so you can walk a triangle to gens rather than across map. "can't quite force that." Another tip maybe try to get a close quarter map from a sacrifice thing.
---
I think it's a huge improvement personally
---
I'd be fucked if I know haha. Logic dictates a rank 14 killer? Nah, rank 2. Logic dictates rank 15-13 survivors? Nah, purples/reds lmao.
---
Dude, camping and tunneling isn‚Äôt gonna stop, the same people are just gonna play other killers until they all get nerfed and all the normal players, who make up the majority tbh, are gonna suffer.

why i love the billy boi
---
Frank's Mixtape could make it so that hitting someone in Feral Frenzy actually reduces the Deep Wound timer, but obviously not by as much as old Frank's did. I can't believe I'm saying this, but it would make the add-on actually strong again, and restore the old dynamic, however now with the new Frenzy mechanics that make it harder to consistently land hits and open actual counterplay possibilities (and lockers might be somewhat of a hard-counter right now, actually...). Other than that, yeah, the vault changes are pretty stupid. Depleting some extra Feral Frenzy for vaults sounds more reasonable. Ending Feral Frenzy on missed hits is a little silly as well, I feel. Maybe make them cost a third of the Frenzy duration, or make them actually have a cooldown like regular missed attacks.
---
Agreed on Coldwind and WGLF, but disagreed on Pig's end game and Remember Me. Slowing Collapse timer for RBTs is better than disabling RBTs for Collapse, and Remember Me is only somewhat and situationally problematic in closed-hatch scenarios, but even then not really. Giving a perk slot for RM to be even-more-favored in a situation that already favors you is eh, especially because you can just slug in order not to need to end up in that situation to begin with. Unnecessary nerf, as is the global gate timer change.
---
Imagine you are on a hook at egc you get saved with 2 and a half minutes to get out and you have rbt. That is major crunch time and the killer will probably tunnel you. Now imagine they dont tunnel and you get away, ok now by the time you get to a box and search it you have 1 minute 45 secs left, you better hope the next box gets it off bc otherwise you wont make it to an exit gate. All this while you are still injured and if you accidentally run into the pig it is gg for you. I get you shouldnt be handed the win, but that is a lot stacked up against you and it would especially suck if you did well and only got hooked at the end bc of NOED or something.
---
Good
---
So we kill ourselves?
---
Wasn't trying to offend you man, just chill out lol
---
COLDWIND OFFERING COUNTERS NURSE
---
Rope
---
The last point is quite ironic too, considering The Game is literally her map.
---
&gt;You don't have to heal as Survivor, it's a waste of time. If you're healing, you're not playing as well as you can be. 
---
You don't have to but it depends on the situation. Healing is valuable in certain situations and isn't in others. You can't generalize like this. 
---
&gt;And having Survivors be a one hit KO also doesn't matter, because you can be looped for days in any case.
---
If you seriously think that, I don't know what to tell you.
---
The looping time of a survivor is cut in half if he is injured. 
---
According to your logic it wouldn't matter if all survivors would start in the broken state by default in every match, which is laughable to be frank.
---
Do you not know how it works? It doesn't matter if you use a different window before using up the three vaults one window gives you. It *will* get blocked off if you vault it too many times within a certain time.
---
I mean, what were you expecting when playing on the test server lol
---
I remember laughing at what he said while making that face
---
‚ÄúOh...it‚Äôs the unfun one...‚Äù
---
Two people turned up on Steam when I searched for that name. Only one of them plays DbD.
---
maybe decrease the amount of boxes
---
Let me explain why the Pig changes are bad:
---
Firstly, I see what they wanted to do with the Traps not going down in terror radius. The chase mechanics are inherently unreliable and we saw that with the Legion. It also helps prevent the pig from tunneling someone and forcing the RBT to go off. However I think this is a poor way to solve the issue. I, and many others have never encountered a scenario where the chase mechanics caused us to die to a trap due to moonwalking or otherwise simply because the traps take too long to kill for this to be viable. It was a problem on the Legion due to how quickly the Deep Wounds ran out but The Pig in this scenario needs to moonwalk chase the survivor for two minutes minimum before the trap has an effect. Thus making it a completely non-viable and asinine strategy due to the other survivors just escaping or doing gens in that time which it is very uncommon to see it (same logic for why no one facecamps in high ranks). Even then this change doesn't fix the issue as the Pig can simply crouch follow the survivor until the trap goes off or bodyblock the jigsaw box.
---
On the trap changes, traps being saved till endgame was a big part of the fun on both sides for Pig. It was a primary strategy to save them since it's most effective at that time since they are always active. The traps are laughably weak in the early game and only serve as a very minor slowdown at best and a minor inconvenience for survivors at worse, but in the endgame they are an exciting and blood-pumping element to the pig and always make me enjoy facing a Pig. They felt completely fair even in the very rare circumstances that you were tunneled.
---
When only relegated to early game usage, the average time i've experienced to take off a trap is around 30-40 seconds. Especially with no immediate Impetus to do so you are slowing down the game by roughly 2 minutes. This comes at the cost of having nearly zero trap lethality and survivors being able to take off traps at whatever moment is most opportune to them, meaning you have to be in a really good spot to take a decent advantage of that 2 minutes of time which is difficult when the Lunge power alone is not all that good of a power.
---
Saving them to the endgame was effective because it forced survivors to remove them immediately giving the Pig more of a chance to turn that 2 minutes of extra gametime into opportune moments for her. This is completely undone by the Terror radius change (as there is less reason to remove a trap quickly even if it's active) and severely neutered by the fact that RBT's do not activate automatically after last gen, meaning that the new primary strategy is to waste those 2 extra minutes early game when the Pig cannot capitalize on them efficiently.
---
Technically you can still save the Reverse Bear-traps until the last generator, but this puts all the control into the hands of the survivors. They decide whether or not you can use the Pig optimally rather than you. This makes this strategy not only unfun for the killer but also unfun for the survivors as there is no pressure to avoid the traps in the endgame or work together to make sure everyone gets out alive, not even to mention the unreliability of it in a competitive sense. Of course you could always open the gates and add more pressure with the EndGame Collapse (hereby referred to as EGC) but that is not as powerful as it may initially seem.
---
The EGC has a 3 minute timer but often runs about 5 minutes on average due to slowdowns. That means you have enough time to remove 3 traps and escape in the near-worst possible scenario for yourself. If she was kept exactly the same the EGC would have only been a very slight buff to Pig and only sounds scary on paper due to the possibility of an extreme (but unlikely) circumstance that someone is caught late into the timer (in which not only is that a sufficient punishment for staying in the trial too long but if they were hooked they would likely be done for anyway due to the other survivors not wanting to risk the save).
---
Even running perks like NOED and Blood Warden (which keep in mind are useless before exits are powered) the thought of someone being locked out of escape would be rare in normal gameplay due to how easy it is to take off a trap. Even adding on addons such as Crate of Gears or extra boxes to make searching take longer, it is an extreme circumstance that is unlikely to happen.
---
But if you were worried about it still, i'd say the logical change would be having Pig the way she was but that the EGC timer slows when a survivor has a RBT on their head. While I still think this change would be unneeded I have seen many people on both sides of the nerfs agree that this would be a good middle ground and most people would be fine with this change. It is likely the most logical as the RBT state is very similar to the Dying/Hooked state in that death is imminent and it fixes the issue of RBT's forcing a death without any nerfs to the Pig whatsoever. 
---
The current iteration of the changes is definitely "A big deal" and I am not just complaining.
---
Or hit th√™m with M1 because you are 115???
---
It's puzzling. Someone the other say was saying they like to use Distressing on their Pig so it really sucked for them because now a unique innocent build lost viability
---
Well you sound angry when others don't like you so got sound like you name some self confidence issue. Plus being mental.
---
There is counterplay to both of the things you mentioned.  There is practically nothing a survivor can do if you decide to babytunnel him off hook to death.  That's the difference.  Flashlights in particular are only a thing if you as a killer allow them to be.  Stupid easy to counterplay.  I can't remember the last time I allowed someone to flashlight save against me.
---
The jungle gym walls are not seethrough anymore which is great for killers.
---
"Now he'll get a free first hit and then just tunnel you." 
---
That's not tunneling, thats called *chasing.*
---
Yeah if someone still wants to chase someone with a trap and get it to blow up they still can do that. 
---
It's just way slower so you are guaranteed to get heavily punished for it, which is a good thing.
---
Ive been doing that for a couple of games now, it indeed helpt alot.
---
Works for me. You console or pc?
---
I pretty much agree with everything you said.
---
I didn't see it in your post but the exit gate opening buff was unneccessary as well IMO.
---
Where did I say that I wanted people to yell at the developers? Of course I want people to legitimately discuss the issues they have. The reason I put out the PSA is because I know a lot of people are going to just say "BHVR are shit and don't know their own game" and do nothing. So I wanted to motivate as many people as possible to discuss the PTB and make the game better.
---
We play the game so we get a say in how they balance the game. The community and BHVR create this game together, not separately.
---
If you want to waste 2 and half minutes doing it sure. As it is now her crouch is pretty bad. She needs to know exactly where people are to use it.
---
But then you didn't apply Deep Wounds to them nor activate Killer Instinct. We're literally at the point where you're arguing in favor of Legion not being able to use their ability at all
---
I know it hides them really well
---
yea hilarious...
---
Wait I just realized
---
If the killer closes the hatch, couldn‚Äôt someone with a key just open it again? 
---
I haven‚Äôt read the patch notes so I‚Äôm not sure if they addressed that or not but this jUST popped into my head
---
Kinda hard to do but ill try.
---
I mean we've done a pretty good job of it so far
---
Im curious. Slugs can stay alive for 3 minutes right? And then it counts at regular sacrifices?
---
Propiganda*
---
Nope since downing survivors takes far to much time, other can just speed trough gens, but his powers just made every game tedious and a chore.
---
&gt;Every game the killers have hex:ruin, irongrasp/agitation, and noed. 
---
lol what now
---
I haven't seen IG in YEARS
---
I have, it still tells you that the person is around you.
---
And might I point out that even if you think that it's bad on The Game, isn't that exactly 1 map out of 28?
---
I also like leaving one in a random ass spot. Everyone expects traps at traffic points, but who would expect one in the middle of nowhere? It works more than you‚Äôd expect
---
I would have the crouch run at maybe 95-100%. I just don't think it should move faster.
---
If you've been allowed to RBT everyone simultaneously and they decide to finish a gen in that situation, then the survivors deserve a horrible endgame. Yes, absolutely, we can engineer situations in which Pig will see disproportionate successes, but that requires either godlike play from the Pig (which should be rewarded) or questionable play from the survivors (which should be punished).
---
RBTs, I've been repeatedly told, are meant to slow down the game. If survivors ignore them and power through gens, but we suddenly take away their bite, then they have \_no\_ purpose.
---
FUCKING HITBOXES
---
Really chose the worst template for this
---
I literally only use it when I'm memeing lmao
---
*ranks 20 survivors be like*
---
You really have something wrong with you. It's quite obviously you now go away.
---
Have you ever played Killer? Loops last for fucking hours no matter whether you have to get two hits or one hit. Why do you think the only Killer in the game that's viable is the one that can ignore loops? It's because looping is too powerful. Even with one hit downs, you can loop for a super long time, throw down the pallet when you see that they're too close for you to run around it again, if it's a safe pallet, you can continue to mindgame the Killer there. If it's not, you just make a beeline for the next loop, which is not difficult to do considering how close loops are to each other in this game. Rinse and repeat. All the while, the other three Survivors are doing gens. GG EZ baby Killer
---
"Now that we have a killer that vomits, my cousin The Crapper would like to join..."
---
Monitor and abuse myers
---
I get where you're coming from, but using anecdotal evidence doesn't really have a whole lot of strength that speaks to the rest of the community.
---
Thematically speaking, I get it; gens aren't going to activate, so the traps remain inactive. My issue, and the rest of the community I'd argue, believe that the pig deserves some sort of compensation. Using RBT as an end game took is very common, more so than you believe. 
---
The community just expected one or two small buffs to make up for an already weak power that got nerfed.
---
It's just Ruin man.  I'll never understand why people complain about that shit outside of rank 17 play.  Greats are not hard to hit with practice.  Hell even if you miss and hit the great just do the TydeTyme trick.  Stop repairing for like 5 seconds until sparks disappear.  You're not getting progress on gen repair anyways so why continue repairing when you can trigger another skill check.  Combine this with hitting greats and Ruin ain't shit regardless of killer.
---
No, I am just saying that getting stunned isn't the end ya know. If you are worried about pallets, Enduring and Spirit Fury with Irre Button. Or some add-ons that help boost recharge speed?
---
You're the one raging about a fucking spelling lmao xD
---
pc
---
True. Legion's changes are not that terrible balance wise but they feel like total garbage to play. I think that's what most people mean when they say "Gutted Legion" as he only needs a few tweaks to be balanced really, mainly just the unfun nature of his kit now.
---
What rank do u see IG?! I only run agitation on a select few killers. Also ruin and NOED have counterplay to them.
---
Yus
---
Who the hell complains about DS in 2019

actually though does anyone know what he really says
---
They must have some reason, but yeah that does suck :/ people have mentioned you can use the fact the timer stops as a worse whispers though. So that could be interesting

The terror radius is kind of the biggest deal tbh

i personally dont see how thats fun. its not even intense its usually, t-bag by survs. or flash light spammed. or i get rolld on by 4swf.  i dont even see this as fun anymore i guess.
---
&gt;So you're admitting that it's not hard to not get downed by the Pig unless she has NOED (which can be easily cleansed, and still requires her to beat your looping).
---
Lots of pigs run NOED so your point doesn't make much sense here. Cleansing totems is always the same killer stance but incredibly hard and time consuming unless you have SWF comm coordination.
---
&gt;You're kind of admitting that Pig sucks, but arguing that these changes should stay so she can continue to suck, so you can continue to win without effort. Hrmmmmmmmm.
---
Pig is ok at best but this is far from a nerf, this wouldve made an unintended buff to end game Pig builds. So your point is?? Hmmmm
---
I feel like you're severely missing the point and I don't know how to bring you back
---
Don't worry, the changes to Pig were ones that they deemed "Logical", so it's fine, Pig is fine /s
---
I enjoy the spirit, but it takes a bit to get the hang of her
---
I don't need to make shit up. You're crazy enough to do it yourself.
---
Except what if one survivor is in a chase when the timer starts and gets downed and the killer just slugs and camps their downed body the whole time? Other survivors have no way to save that person. That‚Äôs not the survivors ‚Äúrunning around‚Äù if they‚Äôre trying to help them. And what if the killer hooks the person right near the end of the timer with those other survivors who were trying to help still there? Now all they can do is wait to die.
---
&gt;buzz words
---
I mean that's what a lot of people uses them for post gens getting powered, they catch one person and tunnel them so they can't get the trap off and can't leave the match. There is nothing the guy can do to play around it.
---
&gt;i dunno man i try and spread out my hooks equally and never use ruin
---
So you are making a point to play nice and not use a perk that would help you out, you are purposefully making the game harder on yourself. And you get punished for that by having a weak early game. I don't think that's a good argument.
---
A Nea t bagged after landing a pallet stun on me while playing as hillbilly.
---
She died 15 seconds later and dc'ed
---
I‚Äôm glad they nerfed her. If she was left as is, she would be stupid op during the end game collapse. Funny how huge streamers that are amazing at the game say there‚Äôs nothing wrong with it, meanwhile, Reddit is in a crying breakdown over it.

---
I mean the killers are the ones getting screwed by the devs, Yes there is a new Endgame on the way Witch would help Killers but with Legion and Pig getting nerfed as well it‚Äôs not looking great for killers (btw I‚Äôm survivor main)
---
Exactly. Give the community a chance to play around with it. You clearly have a fix in mind so if it turns out poorly you can implement it in short order.
---
Closing of the hatch...that mechanic shouldn't be an automatic 4K and Remember me with too many stacks guarantees that shit.
---
I was getting dislike bombed in another post and those killer mains were talking about it.
---

End game builds exist for a reason. Using RBT with NOED and maybe Blood Warden/Remember Me is a common strategy.

Yeah they will

You're missing the point which is not surprising *at all* knowing you

To spin faster and make the 360 possible
---
What‚Äôs 50 + 50 + 50
---
Imagine instead of putting a RBT on you, she's actually a Wraith and just facecamps you.
---
Sure, you can string out series of bad luck events and insist that you should still be able to somehow survive, but this does nothing to address the fact that you were dead the moment you were downed, if she wanted you to be. The moment you got an RBT and were allowed to move again, you had all the chances you ever were going to have.
---
&gt;Have you ever played Killer?
---
All the time but I enjoy playing both sides.
---
&gt;Why do you think the only Killer in the game that's viable is the one that can ignore loops? 
---
Billy doesn't ignore loops and is top tier. Spirit is top tier and ignore loops to some degree but it doesn't work everytime.
---
Again, having a survivor injured is a huge advantage for the killer. If you don't want to acknowledge that fact I don't know what to tell you.
---
Killers are in the best state since game release right now. I don't want to be insulting or anything but if you have that much trouble I just think you need to practice more.
---
Gotta block the names my dude.
---
Downvotes are further right than upvotes.  
---
^restoration ^100
---
Adam saved a woman's life in a train crash. He knows when it's time to move.
---
Not great for me, I use the seethrough walls to loop effectively. Then again, I can see how it‚Äôd benefit killers
---
If anyone is triggered it's you tumblrina. Who used the word triggered these days?
---
IG+AG is something I only break out when I'm screwing around and am taking you to Evan's bait shack (LIVE BAIT SOLD HERE).
---
There are so many hooks and *sabo-meta* has been dead so long that almost never are those perks taken
---
This is 100% the Truth ( i am another survivor main btw)
---
Eventually, but the timer will take so fucking long most of them will likely either crawl out or bleed to death.
---
And I'll keep doing it
---
I dont run into legion nearly ever. I always go against billy doc feddy and plague.
---
Habit probably
---
Yeah but I the joke was about similarity of something completely unrelated
---
Legion and Pigs have nerfs on the way, Spirit is hard but when ‚Äòmastered‚Äô can be a fun and effective killer which can make games fun for both Killers and Survivors (unlike Legion).
---
The timer takes that long??
---
its make it fun because long games are usually the most fun. and if every one is hooked 3 times that means every one got 3 chances and you won every time. Plus this usually means no camping/tunneling
---
Not really. More chances for them to fuck up. I have very little faith in BHVR at this point
---
Yeah there's something wrong with traps rn. If I can find it i'll link you the post but the odds of getting traps off aren't 25/25/25/25
---
&gt;It's just Ruin man. I'll never understand why people complain about that shit outside of rank 17 play. Greats are not hard to hit with practice. Hell even if you miss and hit the good just do the TydeTyme trick. Stop repairing for like 5 seconds until sparks disappear. You're not getting progress on gen repair anyways so why continue repairing when you can trigger another skill check. Combine this with hitting greats and Ruin ain't shit regardless of killer.
---
&gt;Edit:accidentally typed great again instead of good.
---
Don't know why you wasted time typing that. I know how to play against ruin, I just rather not because its boring.
---
Some times you get 10 skill checks before 50% progress and thats enough of tolerating this annoying perk. I wouldn't mind if they kept the flat regression and removed the 3s~4s progress prevention after hitting a good skill check (or vice versa). 
---
Nurse on top of that, is overkill. I rather just leave and get in the next match.
---
Doesn't in this case is "does it not?" because this is a "retoric" question a question that only expect a yes or nonas an answer
---
They can do that now. Explain where the fix is.
---
Billy is top tier, but he's only viable if people make mistakes. And yes, Spirit is top tier, and she can ignore certain loops. Your point?
---
jokes on you, i always check that spot
---
&gt;  Or some add-ons that help boost recharge speed?
---
You literally just made them add-on dependent lmfao
---
You can still only close the hatch when one survivor is left right? So you're saying if you kill 3 before gens are done, you shouldn't be able to close the hatch and guarantee that last kill by patrolling the exit gates? I mean, I think even with the nerf, that perk will still guarantee a kill in this situation.
---
this is the latest noob3's video,i am pretty sure!
---
And let out a sad oink
---
Player shaming is against subreddit rules
---
Probably so it would fit with the latest changes meanwhile
---
üòê
---
This has been explained over and over and over and over but if they just stop the timer when there's a hat then it's no different than before
---
I dont agree. If you died by the trap or collapse thats due to your lack of skill. Its smart strategy trap one at end game. And the team wants to see them live so they stay. I think the nerf is dumb.
---
you need to level up a character three times to level 50. It unlocks 3 bloody outfit parts and normally increase a bit the droprate of good items in your bloodweb.
---
Alright, thank you for adding her to the list of killers people aren't allowed to play! Updated list of banned killers:  
---
\- Hillbilly  
---
\- Nurse  
---
\- Doctor  
---
\- Legion  
---
\- Pig  
---
\- Spirit
---
Of course the killer that you play matters, I was just arguing that when you get all of the gens powered you are not a "trash killer" overall. 
---
In a lot of matches even a good player will make mistakes that will cost them a game, that doesn't make them a bad killer/player. Everyone has bad games, and that is what my comment was about.
---
they can its very fair 
---
/s
---
It's awful on all of the maps, it's the flaming pits of hell on The Game.
---
You're the same person who was celebrating teabagging a couple weeks ago, so you'll have to forgive me for expecting you to have the most basic understanding of the game.
---
No I don't you're like a fucking 12 year old.
---
&gt;Every game the killers have hex:ruin, irongrasp/agitation, and noed.
---
Ruin and noed? Cleanse those damn totems its not that hard just learn most common spots. 
---
IG and Agitation? Those are not op/toxic/strong or even usefull in most games.
---
They timer would slow down so much that they would die of blood loss.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if, despite the massive amount of backlash, the devs decided to keep these changes on the official patch. Maybe just a watered down version of this nerf.
---
The only way this nerf could be acceptable is if they were planning on reworking her addons to make RBTs actually decent during the mid game.
---
I don't have tumblr and a lot of people soyboy.
---
And you sound like you're 5.
---
I read somewhere that he‚Äôs supposed to receive some changes. Looking at this patch it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if that change is if he looks at a hooked survivor for more than a second he goes blind.
---
&gt;  there is a new Endgame on the way Witch would help Killers
---
It doesn't do anything to help killers at all. It just makes scratch marks harder to read lol it's a super neutral addition to the game
---
I get this reference.
---
For everyone saying that RBTs aren't meant to get kills, you're absolutely right. It's meant to slow the game down, and if you ignore the RBT, you get killed for it. However, if they no longer prevent the survivor from walking out the exit gates, they stop being a threat when only one or two gens are left. The timer is two and a half minutes before they go off, and if you can just walk out with it on, there's no reason to worry about it unless its early in the match because you will have plenty of time to escape before your head explodes.
---
A typical survivor main would say that.
---
Ohhh ok then it‚Äôs good, I thought you meant that exit powered=bad killer which is completely wrong
---
I typed all that because the vast minority of players that do work through it know to stop repairing the gen when they hit a good.  I watched the streams when Tyde taught Puppers, Noob and Monto individually about this strat and they have countless more hours in the game than almost anyone reading this here.
---
Oh my god I stepped into his crap
---
Don't name tumblr but use the word triggered. Liar liar
---
Ooh, is that gendered insult?  Now we're getting somewhere.
---
I was just dispelling your notion that only one killer is viable.
---
Infact, I would go so far to say every killer is viable. I guess it depends on your definition of viable but every killer is able to reach rank 1. There is a guy on Twitch who only plays perkless Pig and has no issue going to red ranks.
---
&gt;Your point?
---
I just answered your question. I think I made my point clear enough already.
---
WHEN YOU TAKE A HIT FOR ANOTHER SURVIVOR AND THEY BODY BLOCK YOU FOR A 2ND!
---
I saw one from Glen0ck with his 500 sample size and that half got it off first try if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre talking about.
---
&gt; What rank do u see IG?!
---
The point of their comment was that no one uses this
---
Wait until the next patch when they make it so you can‚Äôt tell what traps are active.
---
The spirit seeing thats its the only one that didnt get nerfed.
---
You didn't answer my question, you reinforced my point that the only Killers that are good are the ones that can deal with loops.
---
The 4th perk usually will complement them.  Also i didnt mean to say they were op but just that they were common
---
I'm not lying it's all over youtube you literally just change the argument every time you lose one..
---
So maybe don‚Äôt implement that deep wound change? It‚Äôs overkill anyway.
---
This is a bad faith argument. Removing the exploits was necessary, and giving Legion a greater level of counterplay was necessary. This does not mean every nerf nor the extent was necessary
---
Oh yeah where is it?  Of course got don't have it, you dingbat.
---
*killers who lobby dodge
---
Best strat in The Game for memeing that still works is evil within I and M&amp;A to have a pretty much nonexistent terror radius and then just grab people off generators.
---
I‚ÄôM THE CONDUCTOR OF THE POOP TRAIN
---
No one is triggered these days except well,  crazies like you.
---
Well they are only in Brown ranks even in green ranks or below i see them like once every 15 games.
---
No I don't think a killer is entitled to a 4k by closing the hatch.  It's why I was wary of the change at all.  I still think a survivor should have a shot at getting out.  It's the same reason pig who everyone is raging about required the change to her traps where exit gate becomes an option for them after she closes hatch so she can't simply camp boxes guaranteeing a 4k.
---
OH MR LA DEE DAH SOFT CAMPER OVER HERE.
---
WELL WHAT DO YOU CALL IT?
---
CAMPING.
---
I suppose in that situation then that survivor is dead regardless. 
---
If the killer camps their body while everyone tries to save him only for BW to activate when there are 30 or so seconds left in the match, its still the survivors fault for trying to save this person for the past 2 minutes when they could just cut their losses &amp; leave. 
---
This is no different from a killer camping a survivor at the end game. The only difference is that survivors risk being trapped in the game if they are baited into waiting for 2 minutes for a killer to not camp the survivor.
---
Definitely not game breaking. Survivors have ample time to simply leave the match if the killer refuses to not camp the slugged survivor. Its the survivor's fault for being baited into staring at a camping killer for 2 minutes.
---
I don‚Äôt even know about stop maybe slow just like when a survivor is hooked or down gives plenty of time to get it off but doesn‚Äôt negate the collapse till it comes off.
---
F for Amanda
---
Well I like him
---
I can agree that noed is a bit gimmicky. But have you ever tried a killer game without ruin? Against a bunch of singles who know what they are doing, it is *possible* to have a decent killer game. Against a SWF, it is almost impossible to have a good game as killer without ruin. This is just my personal experience it I definitely have much worse games when I can‚Äôt slow down the first minute or so with ruin.
---
As for tunneling/camping, this is commonly construed as the killers fault. But think about it like this. If a killer is sitting there watching someone die on a hook, if it is a first hook that is an entire minute the other survivors have to do what they want. A killer sitting watching a hook when there are 4 players still in the game can translate into nearly 3 complete gens. It is up to the survivors to capitalize on the killer‚Äôs mistake of camping. Yes this might ruin the game for one person, but as killers get better they realize that camping just makes space for everyone else on the team and they start to shy away from it.
---
It is similarly up to the survivors to prevent tunneling. When I play my killer games, the most common thing people like to say is that I‚Äôm tunneling. They try to blame me for taking advantage of survivor mistakes. If your team mate is unhooking you and the killer is less than 50 meters away, they are making a mistake. Put yourself in the killers shoes: You hook someone and begin to walk away. Just as they are about outside your terror radius, you see the ping for an unhook. What do you do? You go to that hook because that is the closest place where you know for sure people have been. And in that scenario you see both players, the one who was hooked previously and the one you unhooked. Which one do you chase? Obviously you go for the one who was hooked previously because they are probably still injured and will be a 1 shot down, and they are either about to be second or 3rd hooked. As a killer, the #1 goal is to get sacrifices. The fewer survivors on the map, the easier it is to pressure the rest of them. It only makes sense to go for people who are closer to full sacrifice and who are easier to down because the less time you are chasing one person, the more time
---
You can spend on the rest of the team.
---
As for getting lunges while pallet dropping, it is on the survivor to learn distancing and timing. A good survivor won‚Äôt get hit by a killer lunging through pallets. The big thing here is that your goal should not be to stun the killer with the pallet. The ultimate goal is to get the killer to kick the pallet down. Kicking a pallet removes bloodlust and resets the chase. Don‚Äôt focus on stunning and start focusing on suing pallets to make space to reset the chase.
---
If you do a proper fast fault through a window you will pretty much never get hit through it. The trick is to hit the window as close to perpendicular as possible. Hitting the window straight on while sprinting gives you a true fast vault. When you hit a window at a shallow angle you get what is commonly referred to as a ‚Äúmedium‚Äù vault. It‚Äôs a bit slower than a true fast vault and leaves you open to getting hit.
---
Overall your complaints are valid but really revolve around improving personal play. I would also recommend playing with at least 1 other friend as this greatly improves your chances of doing well. I hope I explained everything clearly enough, good luck in your matches to come :)
---
Then with that logic you would be a tumblrina too seeing as you know the word too fucking idiot and I'm not ugly either this is like the 30th assumption and accusation you've come up with why don't you just kys.
---
Doesn‚Äôt she have a somewhat viable terror radius build where she can stack distressing, unnerving presence, and razor wire to make sure people have a really hard time removing their traps? These changes completely remove that option.
---
Isn't more like " I can't loop the shit out of you without getting closer."
---
Lil backstory: I'm solo queued and for about 2 minutes, I dont see the killer. Then I hear the Mike music. Then someone *immediately* DCs... I get chased, evade him, and so he grabs a guy off a gen. Great. Now I'm trying to get him BUT Mike sees me and begins the chase. As soon as that happens, the hooked guy kills himself. Cool. I manage to escape the chase a SECOND time and the last survivor gets into his first. Did ok, looped him for about a minute but then went down. Immediately DCs. Here I am, injured, just trying to get the last gen done to hopefully get hatch and then..... Killer DCs. What is going on!? Its NEVER been this bad before, the game is basically unplayable this way and is more of a meme at this point. It's not meant to be played like Counter Strike, where everything is usually hyper-competitive, its meant to just have fun on. Theres not even rank based rewards! Guess I'm just sad and venting about this new "norm"
---
No, they are an option. You could run cooldown add-ons, or buttons, or extend frenzy duration.
---
Idiot, ugly, kys, yeah that's enough to report you.
---
Crap! Take two is coming up!
---
Dont bother with Pig anymore, the nerfs were insane
---
They're gonna look at your message history too genius.
---
SURVIVOR SPENDS ALL GAME TEABAGGING IN WINDOWS, PALLET LOOPING, AND BAITING, BUT COMPLAINS TO HIGH HELL WHEN THEY'RE PLACED ON THE HOOK WHEN BOTH EXIT GATES ARE OPEN.  YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED, I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE EIGHT RANKS HIGHER; YOU PLAYED WITH FIRE.
---
I own dbd on PC but almost never play it, but I've got thousands of hours on console. 
---
First time on PTB I was a rank 20 with nothing on my account. I loaded in and the survivors I was going against all had flashlights, exhaustion perks, instaheals, etc. None of them were even playing Adam.
---
I'm a Billy main so I just slugged them all, which was easy because they weren't trying to play the PTB, just bully.
---
Of course they cussed me out in post game chat for slugging with on PTB with Spirit. At least I was playing the content the PTB was meant for.
---
For me they feel much more fun to play. I can actually mindgame and outplay people as Legion, as opposed to just waiting for my frenzy cooldown to get a guaranteed down.
---
There isn't any counterplay to frenzy hits, so for me playing Legion felt like a singleplayer game. The input from the survivor didn't matter, as I could ignore pallets and windows and even if I missed a hit it wouldn't matter, I could just swing again.
---
There wasn't even any interesting stuff you could do with him, imagine playing Huntress around a pallet and playing Legion around a pallet.
---
With huntress you can throw over the loop if it's low enough/has gaps, you can wind up a hatchet before a pallet so they will get hit if they drop it, you can fake going for the hatchet and instead m1 them because they didn't drop it, you can run enduring and take the pallet &amp; still hit them with a hatchet because they started running away from the pallet and assumed you'd be stunned for longer.
---
With legion you activate frenzy, respect the pallet so they drop it and vault it to hit them &amp; even if they don't drop it and keep running you are fast enough in frenzy to still catch up to them and hit them. Then you wait for your cooldown and you hit them again. Brainless and 0 engagement.
---
Agreed but this is the ptb for a reason. Not all of this will go live.
---
Plenty of people do I'm afraid to burst your bubble.
---
Ok, thanks a lot !
---
I agree with your points, just trying to clarify a little. Thanks for your response and level-headedness
---
By all means sweetie
---
Because 1) she can't see survivors when phasing, 2) her power will be down at the beginning of any chase if she finds someone. She can patrol with her power but she has to deal with downsides ol' one-shot doesn't have to. She has to decide if it's worth it to use the power to patrol but he doesn't because there's no reason not to. 
---
&gt;Billy can't move around the map easily.
---
115% Ms vs 110%. She can't go through windows while phasing either, so she doesn't have an advantage at all, but he has more move speed. You're thinking "Billy is worse indoor so spirit must be better" without knowing anything about sprit. Billy worse on maps like hospital, but so is spirit for the exact same reasons.
---
I think a cooler MORI for Hag would be all of her clones taking a turn stabbing the survivor
---
Data or you're full of shit. Using low ranks for data also isn't acceptable because potato survivors would die to a pallet if they could.
---
But it no longer explodes when they walk out with it. Even if you put it on with 1 or 2 gens left, they still have enough time to get gens done and just walk out without being bothered by the RBT.
---
Sad Oink
---
yeah you're not willing to have a good faith conversation here. There's no game balance reason for a pallet stun to remove Legion's power, full stop. And it inherently limits Legion's ability to use their power for no reason, full stop.
---
I was talking about your last comment being evidence of you being a 12 year old you can't even stay on track bye now.
---
Daddy
---
How much killer do you play?
---
These are killer mains
---
And don't forget the people who are try harding on the ptb. I hate those guys.
---
Is The Legion really that bad?
---
I dunno if i‚Äôm digging this while loooong timer thing
---
no she wont sadly
---
ive had one of those spawn once, meg panic dropped one and then dropped the second before the killer even broke the first one
---
Like 2 seasons ago i was a rank 3
---
You mean you and your imaginary friends?
---
I didn't call you ugly you called me it wow I'm not sure how much further down you can dig yourself xD
---
Which question did I not answer? You are just shifting the goalposts further and further from what we were originally talking about which was you saying survivors being injured is no advantage for the killer. This is obviously wrong or do you think that if every survivor started the match broken they would be equally strong.
---
Honestly, saying that survivors wouldn't be weaker if they had one less health state is such a dumb take I don't know why I am still replying to you.
---
&gt;you reinforced my point that the only Killers that are good are the ones that can deal with loops.
---
Obviously a killer that can ignore game mechanics such as windows and pallets completely is going to be one of the stronger ones. You don't need to be Einstein to realize that. That doesn't make other killers weak.
---
Don't let the door hit you on your way out!
---
Can escape with a trap on your head
---
How is it more OP? 5 blinks give more options, but to hit them requires more precision. You can't normally use a single blink to hit someone anymore, you need to use 2 most of the time.
---
5 blinks allows more chances to get to someone, but the fatigue time is still long af. A 5 blink nurse is forced to use more blinks to precisely get to you. This is what reducing lunge range would do. You need more skill and game sense to hit somebody.
---
At least you guys aren‚Äôt getting your people Nerfed into oblivion
---
No one is man. I feel its should be 1 minute to a minute 30. And only slow down for slugs and reset for hooks. So when hooked tine continues.
---
Thanks ill watch it later
---
Unless you are Billy with Enduring, Pallet Fury and BBQ
---
If the changes actually go through as is I probably will be too. I had to stop playing F13 because loading up the game just made me sad. Just loading up DBD is starting to make me angry. Maybe I‚Äôll give White Noise 2 a try. Or just hold my breath until Secret Neighbor or Last Year is out on console.
---
Edit: Blocked out usernames.
---
Have you tried not slugging and just sacrificing?
---
Ive had a couple people step in random doorway traps in lery‚Äôs and its fun as hell when it works
---
So you must have had a big problem with the current setup then. 
---
If these changes are justified, then it should be possible to justify a nurse buff. /shrug
---
If you are the last guy in the trial and get downed by a killer then it is GG anyways.
---
Billy still feels the genrush... because he gets looped. Sure he east pallet fast but he gest looped
---
Scott's a typical survivor main, he cried like a little bitch when DS got changed.
---
Oh you can call me whatever. But telling me to kys is just nasty.
---
If there are 1 or 2 gens left it will activate, no?
---
How much time we talking?
---
She probably could have a solid one... but honestly that‚Äôs nothing on Doctor Terror Radius build so I don‚Äôt think they nerfed it to deal with that. I almost never see that build
---
Ok...so nerfing things isnt the solution on either side. DS needed a rework not a nerf. Legion and Pig needed a slight rework not a major nerf. Survivors have kinda gotten their way with perks and certain tools throughout the games beginings we are now seeing reworks toward survivor based things.
---
I agree it's literally what's happening now it's ridiculous. I wouldn't listen to that guy anyway he changes the argument every two seconds.
---
Self care was destroyed when legion came out just as a quick answer
---
It will, they will only not activate if you put them on once 5 gens are powered.
---
Ah I see you've edited your post. Don't worry I screencaped it just in case you do something filthy like this.
---
Yeah they play all sweaty and then when you tell them to chill they go "it's just the ptb calm down" as if you're the one being a try hard
---
I would like to clarify that i meant the change wasn't all bad and they introduced new things to her kit so it was like 80% nerf 20% buff imo
---
Not gonna lie i dont get it? Both the nerf and this joke.
---
Have I tried it?? Uhh nooooo never tried that before
---
If solos get voice chat, survivors might get unneeded nerfs. I'd rather SWFs use third party comms than survivors get an ingame voice chat. If the game was meant to have voice chat, it would already exist.
---
Possibly but the killer could easily find you maybe. What if the box that takes your teap of glows durong egc?
---
Is he good?
---
What? No, the traps will activate when you do a generator and will explode if they walk out with them on.
---
The traps won't activate if you put them on with all 5 gens done, because they activate when a generator gets popped.
---
I didn't say it was the end times but what you said was factually incorrect. A nerf is a nerf and faster gates DOES affect every killer.
---
Low skill.
---
We're going to be keeping an eye on the situation and see if we need to make changes. The data centers we have listed are not set in stone and can change if need be.
---
Thank you. This always happens when there is a change of some sort, everyone comes up with scenarios which occur about 1% of the time and the game gets adjusted around those. 
---
It's technically possible to run tombstone Myers with infinite EW3 and I've seen it done by a couple of streamers but it's damn difficult and very risky. That's no reason to nerf those add-ons and I feel the same applies for the Pig. Most of the cases sited would require a good deal of luck and a decent amount of skill. Rare scenarios will always happen and if you get caught in one then I'm sorry but it's just bad luck, the same as hitting a facecamping killer 
---
For me EGC was a great quality of life improvement for killers with little to no downside for survivors (yes I play both although more killer). I'm at a loss to see why it's suddenly become a series of backdoor nerfs.
---
Thank you comrade

---
I hunky he Merlot should be a little less tall and the flashlight body needs to be thinner, but it‚Äôs really good!
---
Reverse bear traps no longer trigger when survivors attempt to escape. Basically she‚Äôs losing all of her endgame counter play.
---
Honestly, this game community is filled with so much more weird people than I could ever imagine when I started to play it
---
Crapper next DLC pls take my money
---
I mean, you get more points in deviousness for survivor DCs, so be happy you got a selfish moron that instantly gave you three hooks.
---
Yeeeeees, 100% this
---
I've already reported you they're gonna see what you said too and considering it's you harassing me on my post it's not gonna go down well for you.
---
Becuae now legion moves in a 115% movement speed, and if he runs m&amp;a, he is 24meters of terror radious, if u dont heal against that, ur playing literally exposed
---
Streamers seem to love the pig nerf, even calling the late game pig strat (which was the optimal way to play her) scummy. It wasn't scummy, if you used traps early game they got them off on the first box anyways.
---
yep that's the one! I'm just going to link it on the post in an addendum
---
Well two of those were kind of needed...
---
Zubat is one of the strongest killer though.
---
And calling someone an ugly, insecure person that no one likes isn't ? Good luck with your report xD
---
No i know the vine. I dont get the context. Are you saying that because they were weak you dont care.
---
score a 4k if you get lucky... LUCKY... are you honestly implying that downing 4 survivors trapping, before they can open the gate and keeping all 4 of them away from boxes is LUCK! The thing that really bugs me is that in the ptb the way it seems to be working out is that if the hatch is closed and the killer manages to find you before the exit gate is open YOUR DEAD ANYWAY they don't need to risk anything they only need to follow you around to see if you go for the gate and pull you off if you do. There are people talking like if this didn't happen pig would be too strong but all these situations require ether excellent play on the part of the pig, downing several survivor rapidly, or terrible play by survivors, activating last gen with multiple people trapped, and i just don't get it man.
---
The terror radius thing is just dumb
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure it slows the timer down by about half the normal speed.
---
Lol it's peel forum, not your house plus you're the one who responded nastily to begin with. 
---
But why worry about me when you need to worry about yourself?
---
The only killer I don‚Äôt report is Bubba with speed limiter imho tbqh
---
$50 says that a lone survivor can find and open an exit gate more often than they can find the hatch. Unless, of course they've been hatch camping which renders the whole argument moot anyway.
---
The endgame changes are fine, but the traps pausing in her terror radius? No.
---
That does solve anything, since she can just crouch, and also punishes her even when she's chasing other Survivors.
---
That wouldnt be so bad actually.
---
3 gen strar legion is probably more dangerous... because he can injured you so easy, and if he come backs, you must run
---
Uhm... I'm afraid to ask, but what is that blue thingy in the middle?
---
Keanu Reeves would make an amazing killer in dbd
---
Honestly while they trashed the legion he did get a buff in terms of movement speed. But the pig was just straight up killed, no upsides.
---
A big thing is that 3 minutes, assuming nobody is hooked or downed, is a really long time. There‚Äôs plenty of time to get the trap off. And if they thought it so much of an issue they could make the traps act like a hooked survivor in regards to how fast the EGC timer ticks down.
---
Been playing since release, a 2 matches a week, never knew this lol
---
It‚Äôs not even that much of an issue tf
---
Of course they do. If you made a skin (survivor) or a badass fun to make and every one is different (killer) which would you prefer?
---
Honestly I like that I get Legion now. I got them only once outside PTB (all escaped - they were lagging pretty hard) and then poof! Gone with the wind! Now at least I can learn how to play against them.
---
Hata puta whota muta Scooby-Doo
---
oh shit so its only a temporary ban the first time?  I might actually just go ahead and use those for a bit
---
You're the one calling me ugly. And you insecure. Most of all, I don't tell you to self harm like you did to me.
---
something like that but it's not supposed to be taken as anything more than a joke
---
I wish endgame were just a separate mode tbh.
---
It also stops a regular scenario I encounter when the gates are open and there's a single survivor who spends 10 minutes looking for the hatch instead.
---
Yeah, either one of those is an enormous gutting. Both? Fucking RIP.
---
I wouldn't say its totally unnecessary. Hatch battles were whatever but taking games hostage is extremely toxic and often lead to killers being forced to DC and losing all the time and rewards spent in that match. All the other nerfs are way too out of hand however.
---
Please delete this
---
&gt;Rare scenarios will always happen and if you get caught in one then I'm sorry but it's just bad luck, the same as hitting a facecamping killer
---
I think that's what folks aren't getting about this - if RBTs become "fair" in the manner advertised, then facecamping will become more popular than it already is, either because the Pig can no longer assume the survivor will be forced to hang around on the map, or because the Pig has switched to some other killer.
---
With these changes, if I down a Dwight after the last gen is completed, I'm far more interested in getting to know him personally, 'cause my collar isn't keeping him around.
---
Survivors really don't have anything to complain about. They've just been getting buffed nonstop at this point. Gens go way faster. Alert is OP af.
---
Sure, hit boxes are wacky, but aside from that and camping, it's a cakewalk to be a survivor.
---
Pavlovian disconnect
---
TFW you just realized you've been reading this format wrong and it's actually saying
---
" I can't beat you without getting closer"
---
instead of 
---
"I can beat you without getting any closer"
---
Survivors who dc are profoundly unfun to play against and with
---
You should remember that the rank disparity in the PTB is *far* higher than it is in the live game. Rank 6 killers being paired against rank 18 survivors for example (Happened with me). Out of the 5 matches I played as Legion, 4 of them were with 4 kills but I don't think it's because Legion is good, I think it's because I just faced low-ranked survivors as Legion, and against low-rank survivors, *any* killer would do well
---
I like the idea but what would it‚Äôs ability be
---
Gsus
---
I agree with trap not going after last gen is powered, but the TR change was unneeded
---
I do every time I play survivor though and never bitch. If my teammate was stupid and unhooked me infront of the killer I am mad at him not the killer. Why should I let you run away and heal that's just stupid.
---
Yes the situation is "rare" if you didn't specifically play Pig to her strengths. This change will force Pig players to completely change her playstyle, and also deletes half of her abilities if she's gen rushed which means that she becomes another killer that's countered by gen rushing.
---
And even if you exclude the traps popping when people leave through the exit gates why don't they tick while in the terror radius? There's literally zero reasonable reason for that change.
---
I gave no fucks about Legion before, but nerfing Remember Me and Pig pisses me off big time. no more paying for DLC til they undo it.
---
&gt; but its not like the killers dont have op perks that make them even better. Every game the killers have hex:ruin, irongrasp/agitation, and noed.
---
these are your exact words lmfao
---
I think that if you do nothing all game and only count for getting someone at the very end of the match, you are doing a bad job as killer. I get the appeal of a late game build, but it honestly doesn't work for me.
---
&gt;If they're all two hooked you could be in a strong position, even
---
Well of course that makes a difference, what I meant in my comment is that if all you do is bank on attempting to get everyone at the end game then you have a bad mindset. It's bad to assume that you will lose the bigger part of the match and try to recoup your losses at endgame.
---
And all of them being at death hook once gens are powered does nothing for the pig discussion, since bear traps won't make a difference there. If they had traps prior to the last gen popping, they will become active. If they are all on death hook then why put traps on them then? Just hook them and get them out of the match.
---
Because it is a balance issue. I do believe spirit loses her power guage from being stunned so it makes sense with Legion.
---
I feel like it gets worse as people rank up. I‚Äôm rank 19 and I don‚Äôt get half as many DC‚Äôs as I see other people do. Whenever it happens, it really bothers me too.
---
&lt; to be continued
---
It is not impossible for survivors to hold a game hostage. As long as you don't do anything too noticeable and play extremely safe you will NOT be found unless the killer has some kind of way to find you like Doctor. Even then it will still be hard and time consuming. Going from locker to locker is allowed without a crow stalking your head and if you're playing claudette you will also have to strain your eyes to even notice a hiding, crouching claudette in the distance.
---
EXACTLY!!!
---
That actually sounds interesting... but that‚Äôs way too hard to implement into most maps. The only map where that would work is The Game, where the lower half of the map could be flooded
---
Ds delays the inevitable. Idk much about mom.
---
 Adrenaline is a clutch perk. No one i know runs it bc you still need to escape the killer to make it worthwhile.
---
Ig/a are common not really op.
---
 And yes clean totems but thats as long as we arent getting chased aways from them before the fact.
---
Amanda survived hers in the first one, and if she didn't, there wouldn't be a Pig at All, explain that :p
---
With Tampered Timer and Crate of Gears, it's pretty clearly possible to threaten death. With Slow-Release Toxin and Utility Blades, it's clearly also definitely consistent with tunneling. Everything we're told they're not meant for, they can definitely do.
---
I'm not sure there's a clear vision what they're meant for, regardless of what's been said. Hell, one of her ultra rares essentially removes them from play.
---
I've been saying this... Just make it like you will die no matter what if you go out through the exit gates, that's it that's all I could ask for
---
The threat that there is a trap on your head should remain.
---
The timer slows by 50% if there's a hooked or dying survivor.
---
go watch him and find out? lmao what is this
---
Just bc theyre common. I couldve said sloppy butcher bc thats also common. I chose them bc they do give the killer a better advantage along with if they use the legion perk
---
God damn better do. My most intense DBD memories are when you have to remove the trap to leave after the gates are open.
---
Oh I see! That‚Äôs awesome! So many times ppl just unhook me while killer was camping. And I got tunneled down again
---
Oh yeah #PrayforAmanda
---
No, she doesn't. She had a bug after a recent patch where she did and the devs reversed it. 
---
And you have to explain how it is a balance issue. That's how this works.
---
Yes agreed. Im a littme worried bc the community is only saying to revert her but she would be to powerful at egc with a timed trap and a timer to get out
---
The only person I trust for any DBD opinions is TydeTime
---
Oh god
---
Just is. Easily best killer, so great one each killer.
---
Wait for the next update to see if PTB changes transfer over to the live build
---
Cancelling the cloak animation (not de-cloak) no longer prevents you from attacking for a few moments after, meaning you can use it effectively during chase to partially cloak and 'flicker', a bit like Spirit or Freddy. It's not a lot but it adds some options, like flickering when you change direction to delay people's reactions, or flickering while moving past a window, or to conceal your stain. Previously when you tried doing that you weren't able to attack right after canceling the cloak, so you couldn't really take advantage of it.
---
That's funny true
---
I believe it's to slow the game down, like ruin, by adding an extra objective. It has to threaten life or you wouldn't go do the objective, but if they were meant to kill, then they would be like a no skill required kill, set trap walk away.
---
Amanda survived hers because she played the game like John wanted, but Amanda isn‚Äôt John and even admits her games were rigged to kill people regardless of their choices. Ergo, if you wanted a fair test, you should have hoped for John to be chosen by The Entity, not Amanda. 
---
Checkmate, atheists.
---
1) they're not common except at yellow ranks where killers have like 5 perks to choose from and even then, *eh* not really
---
2) You clearly made a list of perks you think are OP evidenced by the inclusion of NOED, and you have Iron Grasp in it

---
I don't care about the timer not going down on TR, I can just chase Them and down them while patrolling but making it like after the EGC begins traps are useless, it hurts my soul.
---
Both. I'm sure everyone agrees he sucked to play against, and I certainly didn't see the appeal to play as him either
---
I don't really get it. Is it just the new helmet thing that people are upset about? 
---
As a Pig main, I don't put much weight on the RBTs anyways, I rely heavily on the crouch and dash attack. Helmets were really just like "meh, adding a helmet might slow them down, but I have NOED...SO".
---
I play for fun not points, if someone dcs and ruins the fun for me and the other survivors it pisses me off even if I get points
---
I hate this tseries war shit it's annoying everyone I know won't shit up about it and it literally not even joking caused some kids I know to start hating on some guy ony street because he's Indian
---
You‚Äôre right. Like I said do what you want but it‚Äôs not their fault either their teammate is stupid and unhooks in front of you. üëçüèΩüëçüèΩ
---
Everyone's in the PTB, took me about 15 minutes to find anyone. Ptb took probably 60-70% of the games population by my guess
---
Just revert the vault speed to the previous ones on pallets then we Gucci
---
What rank are you?
---
You're totally valid.
---
But they said they would implement a mechanic to slow the game down, and this isnt that.
---
Im aware. But i find that needing 3 perks when your already at 50 is a bloodpoint intensive grind. Where as starting over the grind from 1 to 25 is cheap and quicker.  I got everything i wanted from the grind up after prestige 1 with the Doc
---
A dedicated server in the south america, and in Brasil? Fuck yeah, never 250 ping anymore
---
As opposed to going full tryhard on live which is obviously way more legit because... rank matters or..... yeahhhhh, why exactly? Honestly dude we're testing shit, if you wanna go sit in a corner fingering yourself to myerspictures do that in a KYF or something.
---
OMG OMG OMG I got 1000 updoots for the second time! I wanna thank my mom, BHVR, the Russo Brothers, and Kevin Feige!
---
Yeah but is that an excuse for ruining your teammates game, no gens where even close to being done before she dc‚Äôd
---
Do you not understand the concept of losing perks after a prestige?
---
Dude twitches are narcissistic fucks in my opinion, legit people who get a decent followings on twitch just maks it like they're better than you as you're in that position to say anything you want and you have your followers on your side LIVE and mods who are on sight to take you down
---
Just leave them be
---
after watching people play her on the ptb i dont think of it as a nerf it pressures you to get survivors before the endgame and stops people from cheesing for kills
---
But why? Why would you do that?
---
WHAT RANK ARE YOU?
---
As a Killer (usually r1, currently r7), I see *at least* 1 Adrenaline every match.
---
DS is admittedly fine now. MoM is cancer. Your fourth hit just doesn't count.
---
As a Survivor, I can't remember the last time I even saw IG/A combo'ed, since hooks are so close together.
---
As a person with 250 hours in dbd, I still get the same felling when I see p3 team mate (by the same reason)
---
So just.... trap with 1 or 2 gens left?
---
They didn‚Äôt say that the dedicated servers would include a dc penalty.
---
There's a lot of simple minded people who jump on any bandwagon.
---
isn't this the guy who revealed he was a Nazi, or was that someone else?
---
How is that relevant?
---
I'm not complaining about Legion now. I think there are only two things that need to be tweaked and it'll be perfect. It's just a bad faith argument. Some of the nerfs people have expressed concern over *have nothing to do with what Zubat is talking about in that tweet* so framing it as a bunch of people mad they can't get free downs is bad faith.
---
How is it a strategy lol. If your ambitions are to make no points and be an asshole then sure, I guess.
---
True and he knows that you need that unhook if you wanna pip. It‚Äôs not about points, it‚Äôs about playing the game and playing it as it was designed, but nooooo camping is allowed and it fucks over the hole team and you hardly get any points because your just banging out gens and nothing else and then you depip. 
---
Plus the poor bastard stuck on the hook who hasn‚Äôt done anything he gets it the worst. 
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and when the devs greenlighted camping and tunneling as not being a bannable offense, they opened Pandora‚Äôs box! If your rank 14 or lower 8-10 games will be a camp fest, then before the new pip system rank 2-4 had some serious campers. But again this is on PS4 where allot of kids play.
---
&gt;survivors realize they are now likely to play against a smaller pool of killers.
---
That's my refrain in all this - if Pig's RBT no longer leashes a survivor to the map in the collapse, then I'm very likely better off just facecamping (the doors open faster and everyone else is probably safe), and there are other killers who do that better.
---
RBTs were an alternative to facecamping in the endgame. It's no longer on the table. This doesn't mean killers will just go "oh well!"
---
Yeah and how are you gonna check if that person rage quited ‚Äòbud‚Äô?
---
Sure, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't have a skill based matchmaking system. If killers are getting 3k's or 4k's 4 out of every 4 matches, they should always go up against survivors who have skills.
---
does anyone have a in game pic of daddy trapper?
---
Not their fact if you cant see facts.
---
Living in a fantasy world where your wrong information is true wont take us anywhere.
---
So what exactly is the difference between the nerfs he received and ‚Äúgiving counterplay‚Äù
---
Yep, they are.
---
Nah you're an asshole for tunneling. Fuck you. That's why I run decisive
---
I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a strategy, that‚Äôs what all the killers spew out there dick suckers as one of the reasons to facecamp. But your right about them being a asshole and that‚Äôs about it.
---
You know, out of all of the legion, Suzy still looks the most evil to me.  She's the only one that actually looks like a serial killer
---
Now they nerf someone who really wasn‚Äôt known for making people DC *facepalm*
---
No. 
---
True skill matchmaking means that killers lose every game. Four good survivors will always beat one good killer, excluding Nurse.
---
I look at it that way:
---
If it's my first chase with someone, I can get a fast hit that they can't really avoid (so you're a better Wraith) and either go after someone else thanks to Killer's instinct showing them to me, or if there is no1 around I cancel the power and engage in a 115% ms killer chase but I only need to hit them once.
---
On my next few chases with them they are either injured so I only need 1 hit (effectively making me a t3 myers or plague without her danger beam) or they have wasted a lot of time mending and healing and I can quickly injure them again.
---
Legion mains beat you to it rip
---
I‚Äôll nut istg
---
Amanda can‚Äôt see timers. Which sucked even before the nerf.
---
Looks like Hagrid
---
I completely agree! At first, no one minded Legion... And for good reason! People were still figuring him out and had him barely leveled. Then everyone got his good add-on's... Which, if were being honest, made him a broken and not fun killer to play against. That still doesn't warrant an *immediate* DC, ya know? This Legion could be playing extremely fair and without any cheesy add-on's... *Sigh* Whatever, moving on to the pipping changes was, as you mentioned, the tipping point. You're completely correct. Ever since then, it's been... Well, like this...
---
I dont know much because they never released it or its perks u can still see its name in dbd wiki but there aren‚Äôt pictures
---
I just dont feel like egc is meant as a way to kill survivors truly, imo its moreso the answer to hatch standoff and toxic survivors taunting killers. And I feel like the rbts can really exploit egc if they were active at endgame in a way that is very toxic. No other killer can force you to stay in the trial for the game to kill you itself. If you are decent at running around killers you always have that chance at escape. Rbts completely would deny that and it would be more based on luck whether or not you escape. I think thats why they nerfed her, they have playtested  they have probably seen how powerful she truly was.
---
"Here comes the crapppperrrrr, You better watch out for his..."Samination is just good
---
I was just pointing out that your scenario was flawed.
---
The spirit is a really good killer especially if you master her. She's a mind game queen and can cause some jumpscares. So if that sounds like something you'll enjoy then pick her.
---
The pig is getting nerfed. She used to be a really strong end game killer. She can place traps on survivor's heads that forces them to go play a guessing game otherwise they die on the spot. But you might want to wait before buying her since the nerfs are coming.
---
I'm a legion main so I might be a bit biased lol. Legion has nerfs coming as well, but they're really necessary so its ok. Legion is a killer that does chain attacks and do chases really well since like a survivor you can vault pallets and windows.
---
Plus you get to pick your gender with legion lol
---
I'm not saying people will follow the Pig around. I'm saying that this TR nerf will, in all but the largest maps, add at least 10 seconds to every Trap, if not closer to 20 or 30 seconds.
---
That's a substantial nerf to the pressure traps are supposed to provide.
---
All for what? To avoid that one asshole Pig player who will apparently moonwalk for 2 minutes for a headpop? I've never seen this, I've seen crouching Pigs do this and if you try to get interact with a box, they'll stop you. But they will still be able to do this since it's TR based. This killer also forfeits the game and is bad. I guess it sucks to be that one guy but are we really going to nerf every killer when a somewhat obnoxious but inefficient strategy rears its head? The difference between her moonwalking and Legion is quite large. Legion's timer was super short and he was doing it to cover a weakness in his kit. Pig's doing this are being incredibly inefficient and I wouldn't care about this nerf if it didn't also destroy the pressure of a Pig who is chasing a survivor around a loop and the other guy is hiding in your TR waiting for you to leave so he can do the nearby jigsaw box. He should be feeling the pressure to do it even when you are nearby. If he never has to do it when the Pig is nearby because there's no timer ticking down, then why would he ever take a risk? 
---
I played a round on The Game and I consistently saw timers pausing all over the place while chasing healthy survivors because they were above or below me. Sure, it's probably one of the smaller maps but that's still a problem.
---
Spirit may be fun when mastered, but it is not fun facing her.
---
I hope Remember Me  is only disabled in the event of closed hatch, but I still find the nerf to exit gates by default as annoying.
---
That's good. But there are many high skilled players tormenting low skill casuals in this game. A skill based matchmaking system would nullify this.
---
Welp no need to quote that bUd fAm
---
Jeez
---
Games usually have data if the game crashed on its own or if the player intentionally quitted the game, doesn't matter if you dog is bothering you for a walk and you had to quit, you intentionally quit the game while you're playing in a team
---
You get a timeout in that like cs go when you suicide enough times you get a 30 minute timeout.
---
I‚Äôll probably use legion now that he‚Äôs a 115 killer. Before, I just had 0 desire to play him. All in all I think the changes were positive. To gain 115 over 110 is actually in insane buff.
---
I think the ‚Äúrework‚Äù was extremely lazy, but the bar is set so low for BHVR at this point, any change is pretty spectacular. And no, that‚Äôs not a compliment.
---
Whatever you pick don‚Äôt choose legion.
---
I have probably 10 hours play as a killer. Seriously PM me and teach me how to win a game never going after the same survivor in a row. Please anyone.
---
I like them.
---
You need to re-write this comment because it is barely comprehensible, but I'll reply to my understanding of it.
---
Again, you are missing the point. ***This is not about continuing the chase against Claudette***
---
Until you grasp that, this conversation will go nowhere. I have no idea why you are so hung up on the totally wrong thing. It's bizarre.
---
interesting. theyre in the files somewhere? or is maskless legion actually a thing in game
---
Nah dude that's her default outfit now.
---
oooh, sad that's not mechanical hunk david (nice job btw)
---
Gee thanks what did I win?
---
You give me hope, my boy Frank better be ok
---
&gt;Rbts completely would deny that
---
How did you get one on your head?  If you're decent at running around killers, then you're decent at avoiding RBTs. You keep pretending that the traps aren't the result of the getting caught, after which the killer could have just facecamped you to death.
---
How does this nerf not incentivize facecamping in the collapse?
---
not just in EGC, either; now that the traps dont count down in her terror radius, instead of just during chase, survivors can stop it by urban evading at the edge of her radius. Pigs will learn this, and therefore decide its so easy to prevent the countdown, that the trapped survivor isn't pressured any more, so she might as well chase and down them again anyway, rather than the other survivors who tries to distract after unhooking.
---
He said not good but not bad, spirit is only high tier because she has a very high skill ceiling, but can be difficult to use
---
If he uses sloppy butcher and you're a decent surv. you shouldn't heal, imo.
---
No-one:
---
BHVR: We nerfed the pig, no need to thank us.
---
Hard pills to swallow, my friend.
---
Yup.
---
&gt; But what I'm confused about in the end game collapse I heard that a killer can open the door
---
Yep, if the gates are powered the killer can choose to open a door. I doubt it'll happen a lot but it's basically meant so the killer can force the game to end if there's like two survivors left and they both hide instead of trying to open a door.
---
Why DC because of shit like this. You know there are hit box issues, you know there are lag issues and you know killers will eventually tunnel or camp. This shit isn‚Äôt a surprise, it‚Äôs stuff you should expect to happen. So why do you get so mad when it happens? 
---
Honestly, you guys that DC are petty AF. It‚Äôs a game. If this game upsets you so much you have to rage, you need to go exercise or find another hobby.
---
Good killers should always go up against good survivors. If you're looking for easy kills or jukes, you're part of the problem.
---
Blows my mind. I dont think I've faced a Pig in... 30+ matches? Now I may never see her. It was such a beautiful way to set up a lower-mid tier killer and transform her into an upper-mid tier killer. Instead, they went the opposite direction... Making her a bottom tier killer...
---
I used to play Pig a lot when I first started playing (Didn't have Hex: Ruin and those traps slowed the game down for me) but haven't played her in a while since I played her so much back then I just took an extended break.
---
I forgot the exact number of traps, though I did use the add-on that gives an additional one alot.

*ENDLESS LOOPING INTENSIFIES*
---
As thorough as your reply is, your still wrong. Its not disingenuous to say if its a buff or a nerf. If theres 10 buffs and 1 nerf, then she was buffed. Balance is balance. If the nerf was like remove her power, then it wouldnt matter how many buffs she got, it would overall be a nerf. You have to assess each individual change and asses the net result. My net result is that shes overall better. If you disagree you have every right too. Id still think youre assesment is wrong of course

If I remember correctly, Spirit also lost her power charge when pallet slammed, but that was confirmed a bug by devs, havent played her in ages so not sure they fixed it yet..
---
Honestlt just the headpiece icon looks like a Pyro cosmetic
---
They can DC if they want to
---
I do agree tunneling is very frustrating as a surviver. On that same note, survivors are very much in control of the game. If a surviver makes a quick save and then hides, as the person who just got off the hook runs. And I see there scratch marks and begins chase then is that tunninling?
---
 Cause I've been called out for tunninling and camping, even when I walk away right after a hook. Is it really the killer who's at fault when it's the survivors who make a mistake. And keep in mind that these are the same games that i have survivors tbaging every chance they get and flash lighting at every moment. Yet I'm toxic.
---
On this regard, I feel tunneling is justified. Survivors need to get good and learn from all of there mistakes. It is my job as a killer to secure a kill regardless of how its done.
---
Ps. I also play alot of survivor too so I've been on both sides.
---
I live for merlot.
---
This is what I have been saying and I always get downvoted for it. Give survivors communication so we can buff killers appropriately without it being straight up hell on earth to play solo survivor against a competent killer 
---
SWF Has made this game a balancing nightmare but taking out SWF would be the devs committing suicide for this game.
---
You don't need to explain anything, you need to understand what the issue is, which I explicitly explained, and you cannot grasp for some unfathomable reason
---
That's why I play Ps4 üòé 
---
My frames ;-;
---
Good stuff! Out of interest, how do you actually go about getting the characters and their animations in Blender (I presume)?
---
There is no benefit, it's primarily done to troll.
---
Umm 1. I just remember you from commenting on my other shit. As recently as yesterday I think. Your dumbass name is kinda hard to forget ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. 
---
Anyway I mean I‚Äôm not the one who said thousands of people should die because of what they believe but sure I guess I‚Äôm deranged
---
I can't believe you were downvoted for telling people to not be sheep lol
---
You could do the meme with the same person and the truck
---
In the files, but we might get something that exposes their faces in the future since they‚Äôve put so much detail into each face.
---
obsession confirmed
---
Oh hey man. How are you? Yeah remember i told you that happens i didnt even tell a lie.
---
That's for when they murder my hope
---
You're looking at this really in a real one dimensional way.
---
1) End Game Pig is a build just like Tombstone Myers or any other end game option; in order to make it work you have to sacrifice the entire early game (1 gen left usually) in order for a chance to actually function *after* the game is almost done, but *Before* the game is actually over.
---
This means that such build is high-risk, high reward because you can legitimately lose the ability to get a kill solely based on if you can find people during the final moments of the game; A Pig who can't find or down anyone after the generators are done is a Pig who can't trap people.
---
2) It's ruining Build Diversity; Myers is widely considered one of the most fun Killers to go against because you never know if you're going to get Tombstone Myers, Jumpscare Myers, or "normal" myers, and all three have vastly different playstyles and ways to fight them.
---
The Pig losing the ability to actually be relevant after the doors are opened kills off one of her builds, which means everyone loses due to less game diversity. It's not like Gate Keeper Pig is a toxic build, and it's not like you run into a ton of pigs in the first place.
---
3) Her power is literally worthless after a certain point in the game. No other killer has that problem, not even Freddy. If Freddy has a bad game, he can still put someone to sleep when the Generators are done. If Pig has a bad game, putting a RBT on a survivor after the fact is literally a waste of time. 
---
This is literally a "Didn't do good enough to bring your power to the forefront before the gens were done? Well fuck you!" being built into her character. You can't plan out when you want to use your traps because with how fast Gens get done you might have three gens left, be chasing someone, and all three pop meaning your remaining 3 traps are worthless.
---
People like this make me want to hurt people
---
I'm a survivor main who's playing pig without ruin or noed on ps4 and I think adrenaline is kinda b.s. especially when everyone runs it I want noed to get nerfed too to make it fair d strike doesn't matter at least to me since I run enduring maybe extend the active timer a bit for it. Lunging at the pallet is kinda wonky since it's a coin flip whether you'll hit people
---
Also I only see camping after gates are powered is justified since the killer effectively lost at that point or if your patrolling a hook since survivors are swarming around it
---
Legion is still incredibly annoying to play against. Get an easy first hit, end frenzy, and get another free hit with your 115% movement speed.
---
Lol ok, but you know what‚Äôs pretty obsessive? Commenting Enough_Bernie_Spam enough that people legitimately recognize you. Lmfao
---
Like Hell she can‚Äôt. She‚Äôs a lower mid-tier Killer. Survivors have three minutes to get the trap off. That‚Äôs more than fair. God forbid a Killer actually use their power to secure a kill.
---
dude why are you fixated on me lmao and that in particular it's so fucking weird
---
this sound always makes me uncomfortable
---
Thank you so much! Lazerbot team said there would be more tgt in the future, but that was years ago and they're working on other independent projects. I hope they return to this series again one day.
---
She's not hard stop patting yourself on the back. She's easy af and one of the, if not the most powerful killer(s) in the game.
---
Why is this even such a big deal? No survivors run to the gate with an active rbts anyway, so egc is going to make them start doing it? No its because everyone knows pig would have been very powerful. Thing is before you at least had the option of the hatch if you were getting tunneled or what but now that is gone, so they needed to rebalance her. Like i said id be fine with keeping everything as it was for pig, IF egc timer stops when someone has a trap on there head.
---
CANT HEAR SHIT GUYS, CAN YOU SPEAK UP?
---
See, this is confusing because most people who know Naruto hate Sasuke.
---
Unless you equip franks mix tape.
---
Every survivor should read this post before making any of those complaints post game. A well explained post good sir.
---
I like how anyone who doesn't agree with you is labeled a troll.
---
I had that experience too, it just felt besides that first hit his power has to many hindrances. Like the first missed swing being a stun is fine, but draning the entire power vague is a bit harsh
---
Iky iky iky ping tang zoom boing *maybe she will quit*
---
Isn't there also a way to do it on console?
---
Perhaps via using PSN invites instead of Steam invites?
---
It‚Äôs a joke.... I‚Äôve been watching Tru3 for 2 and a half years. He‚Äôs been full time for longer than that.
---
*\*Places traps right next to your ears\**
---
He probably couldn't beat Ash Williams, but Ash is normally armed, and has a chainsaw, then again, Ash also has a hand made out of metal so it's kinda arguable how much experience Ash actually has in "surviving".
---
&gt; Also at high level gameplay pig never efficiently applied pressure because the jigsaw mechanic is flawed with rng.
---
I mean, I'm not trying to argue that Pig is a good killer. I recognise that she's based on rng. 
---
I actually had an idea that instead of random % chance of rng key spawning, you should have to search x number of y (x&lt;y ofc) boxes to get fragments of a code to open them. That way she's not rng based anymore, she will always delay by the same amount (sure some boxes can be closer/further away, but you won't get it off on first box or at 5th, always the same x number). Don't show the pig which exact boxes you need so that she can't just camp 1 and get you killed.
---
I don't like that they have focused so much on the boxes with Pig's add ons, I'd much prefer more add ons for the dash instead.
---
&gt;Realistically if she manages to get a survivor trapped just before last gen is done she can still tunnel them to the ground in the exact situation you described.
---
Yes so that doesn't get completely taken out of the game, just if someone managed to evade you before the gens got powered you can't guarantee that they will die no matter what they do.
---
&gt;A lot of killers can tunnel in the late game with their insta-downs or strong chasing abilities but I don't believe they should be nerfed for it. Yes those killers can't physically keep people in the game like pig can but if they tunneled off a hook that was a mid sized distance from the exit gate they could easily just tunnel a survivor to death too. The only situation that doesn't work for is one where the survivor is hooked right next to the exit which pig would be stronger because the trap won't let them leave even off unhook.
---
Sure any killer can tunnel, but the exception with Pig is that you don't have any hope of escaping against her. If you play better than the killer and manage to avoid them well, you can escape. With Pig you don't have that hope, so it's not down to who's playing the chase better, the survivor can't win.
---
Doesn't mean she wouldn't tip the odds in her favour, otherwise add-ons wouldn't do anything.
---
Should have used Sans or Papyrus.
---
Lmao not fixated on you or your stances I just thinks it‚Äôs strange that one person could be so hypocritical
---
I can‚Äôt get a lobby for shit in the normal game or ptb. Normal game only give me killers from McDonald‚Äôs on the moon after about 8 mins. Ptb I got in 1 game after about the same amount of time and it was an ultra try hard huntress, not laggy tho... so there‚Äôs that.
---
and I'm requesting an elaboration on how this fixes your view of the scenario.
---
This is an inconclusive statement, *everything* has a price.  Money. Blood. Terror.
---
^^^Everything
---
-E. MacMillan
---
Not necessarily 3 minutes dude. What if you are hooked and get unhooked with only 2 minutes left? What if the pig starts chasing you when you are on the way to the 4th box you have to check with only 1 min left in the game? Egc+ old pig = free unfair kills and dont even get me started on the toxic exploit she could do
---
I found her hard, personally I found her hard to play as. I know she can be a great killer but most people agree she is hard to master, like the Nurse in a way.
---
You have to know how to read play well and learn how to mind game your opponents. I‚Äôm a survivor main so I found this hard and I know I‚Äôm not alone.
---
And when tf did I ‚Äúpat myself on the back‚Äù
---
Not Dream Time, range. Range add-ons are his best add-ons.
---
Oh man. Will never get that
---
What's an "oldfag"?
---
On paper, pig is still the same killer. You just cant force kills in the endgame anymore with her traps.
---
Dude your name is edged into my soul as "that moron legionplayer", honestly bro nothing you say adds to the conversation, everything you say is low IQ dumbfuckery, you realize that right? I bet it's the same with you IRL you just say stupid shit constantly, you vote sutpid shit, you eat stupid shit, stop it just let someone control your life and you'll see massive improvements.
---
Counter logiced
---
You will no longer gain Madness in Doctor's Terror Radius. If Doctor shocks you while you are in his Terror Radius, you will no longer gain Madness.
---
You‚Äôre right. Tbh there are some awesome add-ons for Freddy‚Äôs power. The ones that lower skill check chances in the Dream World are nice too.
---
I'm not on the dev team
---
I agree, it's very much overkill for legion. I dont think people really had a problem with the being in a chase bit. It just makes him so weak
---
Don't bother lowering the transition time. Nancy's Masterpiece does basically the same thing, while letting you snipe people from farther away. The Green Dress add-on (the yellow add-on) makes it harder to wake up. I barely notice the 7.5 second transition anymore. These add-ons allow me to do other stuff more comfortably while not wasting as much time chasing after people to put them to sleep. I can sleep a group of people, even if they're all fleeing, very comfortably.
---
I love this flair
---
People really don't run alert I've seen spine chill ran more often
---
Yet you have people here who will defend it and don't understand there is just simply no winning against it even if you get out. If they don't play like that I have no idea what they have against punishing this type of players.
---
&gt; There is no hatch standoff...Killers can't grab Survivors out of the hatch anymore. If the Survivor finds the hatch in a chase they get it 100% of the time now. The ridiculously convoluted situation you describe is becoming more Survivor-friendly in the patch, and yet you are using it as justification for your nonsensical argument.
---
If only I stated that I wasn't 100% sure if a mechanic worked a certain way or not, the only thing it changes is that the killer is racing to find the hatch while trying to keep an eye on the survivor.
---
In that situation an Active RBT survivor would be completely fucked unless they won the race. 
---
&gt; I mean this in the most courteous way possible: you have absolutely no idea what you are talking about. 
---
I don't think courteous means what you think it means.
---
&gt; I stand over it because the last survivor undoubtedly will be hiding at an exit gate waiting for me to power the damn thing. I force the survivor to get into my line of sight before I close it - boom. Game over. No recourse. No counterplay. Just waiting like we did before
---
This is flawed, I was just pointing that out. I'm not weighing in on if this is a fix, I can't play the PTB so I'm not weighing in on that. I'm just saying that your example isn't completely accurate.
---
That mean "old players". Maybe i take wrong word, in russian we sometimes using "newfag" and "oldfag" words (green and experienced)
---
Yeah it (at least shouldnt have been) isnt supposed to make the survivors escape easier either.
---
&gt;3) Her power is literally worthless after a certain point in the game. No other killer has that problem, not even Freddy. 
---
First, after all the gens are done, the game is pretty much over anyway because Survivors can open the door in 15 seconds now. The game is pretty much over. So it's a bit disengenous to suggest that this cuts out a big portion of her play book for a significant portion of the game. Yes it remove cheese end game strats if you play her like that.
---
Second, you need to learn that her best skill is the ambush lunge, not the traps. Hardly anyone dies to the traps and they will still work like normal during pretty much the whole game which is to **delay the game, delay gens getting done**.
---
With a nerf currently in the ptb and a toxic play style causing survivors to dc and and endless frustration for the killer , I would not recommend
---
To be fair, Ash lost his arm literally the first *day* shit started going down in his life. As in, he survived all his friends dying one night, was passed out/possessed during the day, and then lost his hand that night.
---
To be extra fair, he cut off his hand himself because it was possessed and was going to start trying to kill him with a knife.
---
He has a **ton** of experience with surviving.
---
The plan was there all along.
---
Ah, a player of culture, I see. You use STBFL on Freddy as well.
---
No shit? Thanks for the heads up, chief.
---
I don‚Äôt either. I don‚Äôt support DC-ing but I at least can understand why some people DC when someone is using an exploit or being super toxic. Why DC just because you‚Äôre losing? Seems like it‚Äôs better to just lose and collect your BP.
---
u mad bro
---
See Daylight, DC
---
No u :p
---
It *is* unfortunate we have such a petulant child in our ranks.  He lacks dignity, esteem, and foresight.
---
Were I to act as such, Mr. MacMillan Sr. would have tanned my hide with a phone cord &amp; ordered me to work in the mines with the... proletariat.
---
*shudders*
---
- E. MacMillan
---
It's easy now that they're an M1 killer, just look out for that 115 movespeed
---
That's what happens when everything you address as a problem in survivor gameplay gets shut down by "lmao git gud baby survivor" because morons can't differentiate between the lack of objectives and the rest of the game.
---
Soon^^TM
---
Currently I run remember me, ruin, haunted ground, and BBQ. My go to add-ons are blocks and drawings for shorter transition and longer range. 
---
The key to Freddy is keeping multiple survivors in the dream world. A chance to pull another survivor into the dream is more valuable than the second hit.
---
\*Sad oink\*
---
If you prefer that playstyle, good on you. doesnt mean the option should be removed from those who prefer another style.
---
If it stunned but didn't drain the power then you wouldn't really get punished for missing.
---
The only changes to new Legion that I'd implement are:
---
- Pallet stuns don't drain the power if you are not in frenzy, as they currently do
---
- Button add ons don't require you to hit someone with frenzy twice (and stun yourself out of the power), you can just tag multiple people with mangled/broken/blindness.
---
- remove the vaulting speed penalty, for some reason you now vault slower than you used to in the current version
---
Sorry don't talk to people who downvote in a 1on1 conversation.
---
I need me some spirit fury
---
If its inactive. Dont forget that.
---
Semi off topic but why was the old pallet model removed from the game?
---
You are saying that because of the recent changes on the ptb to Legion that losing the power guage is an unneeded nerf.
---
So where's Kate on the list or jane
---
No. Stop crying
---
*insert LazyTown joke about Stingy‚Äôs treehouse*
---
Why wouldn't you run alert? It's free real estate on knowing exactly where the killer is.
---
Zubat didn't say that.
---
It wasn't Zubat's tweet.
---
As Paulie said, you can have both.
---
I agree with you, but these changes don't actually address that. You can still get trapped before she closes the hatch, and there's nothing you can do about it.
---
Thanks, someone called me that post game (with a few more profanities) and I just had to adopt it.
---
So removing the Pig‚Äôs traps ability to stop a surv from leaving essentially removes its sole purpose. Don‚Äôt even start with Legion or Freddy. 
---
You can still pallet loop to infinity as a survivor, always staying out of range if you‚Äôre good. You have SWF for God‚Äôs sake, no defense against that. ‚ÄúKillers are faster‚Äù. If they were slower than survs the game would be unplayable. There is no flashlight counter, only a delay perk. There is no multi-window vault block perk. No pallet block whatsoever. 
---
Also survs have aura reading too, a couple perks actually. I run Kindred and sometimes Dark Sense when I play survivor. 
---
No such thing as gen rush, that‚Äôs just playing the game effectively as a surv.
---
Nope! I don‚Äôt think killers should be rewarded for survivors completing the generators, it works perfectly as it is now because there will still be pressure if somebody is in a chase, which they usually are.
---
One part of the nerfs was removing the moonwalk, which should not be a thing. The other part was making it so you can't just brainlessly m2 which also should not have been a thing. You also can't just smack indefinitely which also should not have been a thing. The only need was the frenzy movement speed but he got compensated by 115%. I guess Reddit killers are a thing after all.
---
thankfully he's back on his bread and butter of fighting games.  Been doing mortal kombat 11 the last two days and he seems a lot happier with it.   I like seeing when streamers move on from things they were getting burnout on, but are afraid to move on and losing views.
---
Actually, something I‚Äôve always wonder is how loud the basement chest is to open. I never risk opening it when the killer is upstairs but as a killer I‚Äôve never heard it being opened either.
---
You lack... girth, Sir.
---
Oh.
---
It's not zubat, it's someone using his emote as avatar.
---
Nah, my money's on Frankie if he's against Meg or Ace. Ace is a charmer, not at all a fighter. And I'm pretty sure Frank and Meg are about the same age, and Frank seems the tougher of the two.
---
Yikes.
---
I mean you said I was patting myself on the back which is BS, and presented an opinion which is widely disagreed with, as shown by the fact you had at least 2 downvotes. Am I not entitled to downvote. It wasn‚Äôt even a one on one conversation you wasn‚Äôt originally involved you replied to my reply to someone else.
---
When I‚Äôm in a bad mood and want to be toxic, I run doctor with puzzlepiece offering on a terror radius build.
---
Agreed and is the exact same for me. The fact that we can‚Äôt transfer our accounts over is infuriating.
---
I feel like if Ace were to go after Frank he would basically use Benny's speech from New Vegas
---
I'd let you chloroform me and then smother me to death with those bare thighs, no homo.
---
From what I remember he said that he doesn't mind the change as he doesn't tunnel/can just slug so it will never affect him.
---
I don‚Äôt mind the changes but there should definitely be a compensation for them since the pig is already not that strong.
---
yes daddy
---
Have you ever seen his stream, lol.
---
There's no pallet towns anymore, so you very rarely will be looped for long
---
That would only be the case if she traps you a gen is popped activating said trap and then the hatch was closed afterwards.  If the trap wasn't yet activated the act of her closing the hatch doesn't activate the trap so a gate escape is possible.
---
How many percent did they say will be available by shards? If they gonna keep it that way the least they can do is give us way more shards. Boom, question of rank rewards is (partially) solved.
---
Lol which part of I don't talk to people like you did you not understand?
---
I think the community focus should be on keeping the devs from ruining the core mechanics of a killer and a perk, rather than on cosmetics.
---
Huntress‚Äôs Lullaby makes me feel relaxed
---
This game is relaxing
---
As opposed to the survivor walking out with no consequences? As opposed to hooking you and camping you like most Killers will have to do? That doesn‚Äôt sound unfair at all. That sounds like *counter play.*
---
I started following Tydetime after he started talking about how killers don't have to follow any made up survivor rules. I tell people when I stream DbD that I'm not here to appease the whims of survivors...I'm here for points and to win. 
---
Tydetime did a good job showing the disparity between the two types of DbD players.
---
&gt; The game is pretty much over.
---
Pretty much over is not actually over. Pretty much over means that the Survivors still run the risk of being caught, trapped, and forced to run around looking for boxes. Actually Over means that the Survivors got out and the Killer killed those who didn't.
---
The ability to trap Survivors endgame isn't a cheese strat. It's a way to force the Survivors to stay in the game to give you a second chance. It's no where **near** the point of Moonwalking Legion, which is an actual cheese strat. Trapping a Survivor still requires catching and downing them; if that's a "Cheese Strat" then you just called the entire Killer playstyle cheese.
---
Second, while her Ambush Lunge is great for mind-gaming and the various Parkour leaps you can do with it, her Traps are her vastly better skill, because they don't need to kill. **They need to force the survivors to stay in the game longer so that you get the kills**. In the early game this means survivors get off Gens, so you have more time. In the late game, this means that Survivors can't leave. **Both of these delay the game**.
---
In all my time playing the Pig, I got maybe a handful of kills using the Traps, usually because the Survivors 3-gen themselves and the box with the key was right next to me. I got one kill because the guy tried to leave with it.
---
**No one is arguing that the traps should kill. We are arguing that her power shouldn't be worthless after a certain point in the game and they should function how they always have; forcing the survivors to stay in the game with the Pig for longer**
---
Lol I get you. I just never played legion cuz I wanted to play  4v1s not 2 or 1v1s cuz people disconnect. I also didnt want to be an asshole. But I'm happy that at least legion is 115 movement speed now.
---
Ruin isn‚Äôt op at all lmao
---
Lol that‚Äôs the point of the perk.
---
true. I mean, I picture him just using all of the F13 and MK fatalities for Jason. Dude may not be the biggest or the tallest (anymore...) but he's without a doubt the strongest.
---
&gt; when playing on smaller maps like the game map
---
its funny how pigs power is useless on her own map lol
---
Yeah, idk, the remember me nerf was somewhat uncalled for. Maybe they could disable the perk if the hatch is closed or something, but even if they just completely left it as was, and you had 6 stacks, you do deserve the kill if only 1 surv is left. But that's just me.
---
LMAO, YES LETS LOOK AT NERFS FOR FREDDY FIRST BEFORE EVEN LOOKING AT FIXING HIS ABILITY TO KILL
---
&gt; Why is this even such a big deal?
---
Primarily because it's wrong thematically. Why does it matter if a door is open across the map? Which SAW traps temporarily stop ticking if someone's too close? In most cases, someone's watching from the other side of a wall. Who in the SAW franchise gets a Jigsaw trap that doesn't eventually start ticking? How many escape with a dud trap?
---
These changes are solely based on balance, are counterintuitive, will confuse new players, and aren't consistent with expectations. In Amanda's case they go against the driving force and habits of the character. It'd be like the Hag suddenly going vegetarian and refusing to mori during the collapse - even if it satisfies some balance issue, it's just wrong. The Plague suddenly takes antibiotics because it's fair.
---
But it's just weird. Why choose to stay near a killer if you've been given a hat or stabbed in the gut? Why does being near Legion stop someone from bleeding out? New players especially won't grok these changes and even for older players it'll be weird and chaotic.
---
Furthermore, it's because she really didn't need nerfs. People get their hats off all the time. They really do. This idea that she'll be able to patrol boxes is ludicrous. If she's in crouch mode, you really will be able to escape her, especially with all the exhaustion perks at your fingertips.
---
And finally, because they incentivize facecamping. They make a pre-existing problem worse. Every fix to the Pig can be avoided by running Cannibal. They haven't fixed Pig - they've just moved toxic behaviors to another killer.
---
&gt; No survivors run to the gate with an active rbts anyway, so egc is going to make them start doing it?
---
I mean, some definitely do. Especially on high rank players, I get pops at the gate. But even in-the-know survivors will know they have hats on and the impulse will be to remove them, whether or not they're active.
---
They recently gave an update about Freddy rework on forums.
---
I PLAYED 3 GAMES YESTERDAY, 2X 3KILLS AND 1 FULL CLEAR WITH 4K.
---
FOR THE FIRST TRIPLE I GOT 1 PIP, FOR SECOND I GOT BLACKPIP AND I DEPIPED WITH FUCKING 4K. HOW
---
IS IT MY FAULT THAT THEY DON'T SAVE EACH OTHER AND ARE REALLY BAD AT LOOPING? LIKE SERIOUSLY  WTF
---
One wrong mindgame like that and they are on to the next loop wasting more time. To be frank in this rank system unless you make it to red ranks you are versing mostly mediocre survivors and some good ones at best so pig can work and will do ok but in red ranks like most killers she gets clobbered and this won't help. She certainly wasn't oppressive enough to justify this nor was she even close to good enough to justify a nerf.
---
It's not super difficult to get traps off unless they bring crate and timer or jigsaw's sketch and timer on a big map because that's guaranteed death
---
I don‚Äôt know why survivors think their perks should be as good as killer perks. You realize there are 4 of you right? Because it‚Äôs 4 against 1, your perks should theoretically be 25% as good. This concept seems so repulsive to survivors, but that‚Äôs balance my dude. You get every survivor playing with faceroll perks like MoM and the game is over before it even started.
---
Drop nurses
---
For?
---
Ah. Still don't really agree but that's better
---
This shouldn't have been added to the game, and Henry Warden shouldn't be a killer.
---
This game is rated M for Mature. That means no Miners.
---
I. Fucking. *HATE* *PIG!!!!!!!*
---
Legion's in a weird place on the ptb. The 115% is a nice change, but all it does is make them into another mediocre C tier m1 killer. (Still stronger than they were before though)
---
Gg bruh
---
Omg they literally disappear with that build
---
This dumb ass Meg crouched to my gen at 85%, failed a skill check, then ran away. I hate when people jump on my gen, fail a skill check, then run off. Like wtf

Rofl not this shit again.
---
Lol probably, they‚Äôll pretend that he‚Äôs still super useful since he can hit multiple survivors that are near each other; even though that never happens because survivors always run away from each other and you are slowed down when charging chainsaw.
---
Oh God, not TydeTyme please. He literally bitches about anything he could. He bitched about 3 person games not being a thing anymore! Like, is he delusional or something?? If you want proof, go to his first dev update(the new weekly thing where the devs say what they're working on in the game) video.
---
I dont agree with the nerf just an fyi, i think egc timer should just stop if the rbt is on someone, i dont think its fair for the pig to be useless at endgame.
---
?
---
Traps don‚Äôt work at the end of the game after gens are done.
---
I don't like the pig, so I'm happy
---
I heard the legions leather sound today and it triggered my ASMR
---
Maybe if they other person takes them off like not long after being hooked in front of the killer I hate when survivors do that to me unless they're new.
---
**Inactive** traps won't kill you if you try to leave. RBT placed *after* all Gens are completed won't activate, but if you trap the survivor before the final gen is completed they still have to go around to look for a key.
---
Oh i wasn't aware, first time RUIN has spawned there for me haha.
---
That's only if everyone on the survivor side is running WGLF. I didn't forget anything, much less that this is a 4v1 game. You're forgetting that not everyone runs WGLF every match. 
---
The problem is that people both don't want to risk themselves and don't realize what they can do to gain tokens. You can tank hits by being very close (read: almost on top of another survivor, like when you're healing them and around that range) to another survivor, when they're being carried, and when trying to unhook them/being very close to a hooked person. It doesn't take that much work to get all 4 tokens, and "optimal" play includes being altruistic to your teammates. The 4 token requirement can stay.
---
Funny part is that in the end he falls down and it turns out not to be a very big fall at all, just like pigplayers will realize it's not such a big fucking deal either.
---
Same applies for cosmetics. That does not correspond to actual skill.
---
I use pink hair Nea. God, there are so many killers that are either not even trying to chase me thinking I‚Äôm gonna loop them for hours or facecamping me thinking I‚Äôm the main threat.
---
... and I actually just waste palettes and go down in first few seconds.
---
Let's go KYF, I'll hide in a corner and you try to find me. See how long that takes when I'm literally crouchwalking around with urban and not making any noise.
---
I agree that Ace is more of a talker than a fighter, but as a man who‚Äôs racked up enough big debts with people you don‚Äôt want to owe a nickel to, I can‚Äôt imagine that he‚Äôs never had some scrawny punk draw a blade on him before.  He may be way more talk than tough, but I don‚Äôt think you get to live as long as he does being ALL talk.
---
You got downvoted, but I feel this. Haven't been able to play survivor without the game disconnecting me since the Plague update.
---
Letting someone bleed on the floor is equivalent to a mori,  I think
---
(Scroll to the bottom.)[https://forum.deadbydaylight.com/en/discussion/57097/developer-update-april-2019]
---
His whole point is to instantly down someone. Choose a perk that can help you find fully healed people, as most of the time survs are self healing and self healing wastes a lot of time.
---
This is literally the lullaby my mother sang to me when I was little (I'm Russian) so it makes me sleepy every time
---
I'm a killer main, and so are Scott and Zubat sooo...
---
People like this make me want to hurt people like this
---
This the biggest reason why I disagree with lowering the time. EGC isn't designed for kills.
---
This is true I mean there are two chainsaw killers that are similar.
---
Love it. That‚Äôs what I usually run. I substitute ruin/nurses at times though and I use sloppy butcher and discordance. Discordance is amazing for gen pulls/seeing two at once. Surveillance is nice as well.  
---
Play with what your comfortable with, but for me I never take off monitor and abuse as that‚Äôs a staple to any good Myers build and I just can‚Äôt get rid of BBQ.  I just love double BPS and a free peek at players who don‚Äôt hide in a locker, etc.  bbq is easily replaceable though just not for me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
---
Do you not understand most people prestige so they can get a perk. Newsflash buddy those bloodwebs still happened. Unless you‚Äôre too stupid to understand this simple concept.
---
I'm keeping my Hope's up for scream as chapter 12
---
Wtf are you on about.  How much of a toxic survivor main are you?
---
-I don‚Äôt need to complain about hit boxes, everybody knows how bs they are. I was complaining about a selfish af dc.
---
-I don‚Äôt camp, I don‚Äôt tunnel, I didn‚Äôt even pick up the Claudette before she dc‚Äôd. She was selfish and deserved to get called out in a team based game
---
-I didn‚Äôt try hard. I played casually. I let the last survivor go and played fair. What was I meant to do, let them all go and de-pip because one person is a selfish asshole?
---
-Do you know what Sympathy means?  It means feels bad for someone, I didn‚Äôt want people to feel bad for me. It‚Äôs a bit annoying sure but I still got a pip and blood points. I wanted people to have sympathy for other players who are messed up by that one selfish teammate
---
-And how tf was that dc my fault, a dc is never really the killers fault. Even if the killer is playing toxic or you get cucked by a laggy hit box you shouldn‚Äôt dc because your wasting time for your teammates to gens and get the save. If you think survivors should leave a game just because it‚Äôs not going their way is right than your just delusional
---
Same with me and shirtless David. They know i have dead hard, but what they dont know is that I'm bad at remembering that I have dead hard :)
---
That's me when I waste a trap on the first downed survivor and forget I only had 1.
---
i'll switch nurse's for bamboozle, or both nurse's and m&amp;a for enduring + spirit fury
---
Well, they're morons. Playing a powerless m1 killer to the end only to start playing when the gate is powered is apparently scummy? Yea... who were you watching btw
---
Really someone actually said that? :l
---
End game as in the End Game Collapse. If it's triggered, putting a RBT on someone is literally a waste of time because it won't activate even if they pass the exit gates.
---
The least they can do is revert the nerf to her terror-radius, anything else would be a flatout gutting.
---
Timer starts when all gens are done I thought?
---
People who like this format...
---
Jokes on you, I play even more and am even worse 20 FPS gang rise up
---
Ok plague is not the same tier as Freddy but go off
---
To be fair, most updates the past few months have been heavily favoured towards killers I find. Many perks got cut down and some killer ones got improved. It was a scale tipped heavily to one side. Now these changes here in this update, most seem to be tied around the endgame so seems bad. But honestly think it encourages more strategizing with the endgame in place.
---
&gt; I agree with Scott that review bombing the game for ptb content is silly.
---
Oh yeah. And this happens always. That's why I didn't say anything about it. Glad to hear that wasn't Bat.
---
That's just one night though, Bill survived longer than him, and he was in a war, he also survived at LEAST a week and a few days in a zombie apocalypse with fucking awesome special zombies who can do all sorts of insane shit, what Ash can do with a double-barreled shotgun and a chainsaw, Bill would probably be just as good, if not better, iirc, Bill fought his way out of a hospital on the first day of infection using only two bonesaws, so if that doesn't spell out what kind of person Bill can be, I don't know what does.
---
Again though, no matter what the case is, I doubt the Trapper could beat either of them without being coddled by the entity, hell, I don't think the entire cast of killers all together could beat a group of Bill, Ash, David, Tapp and Laurie together, they're all pretty much legends in regards to survival.
---
dude get off me lmao
---
IT'S ACTUALLY DISGUSTING THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE ACTING LIKE WGLF IS GETTING NERFED. NO, IT'S GETTING A QOL CHANGE THAT HOPEFULLY RESULTS IN LESS PEOPLE HAVING TWO MINUTE GAMES BECAUSE SOME SELFISH PRICK KEEPS YANKING THEM OFF HOOK FOR STACKS WHEN THE KILLER HASN'T EVEN LEFT
---
IF YOU THINK IT'S BEEN NERFED, PLEASE STOP PLAYING THE GAME. YOUR TEAMMATES ARE MORE THAN JUST POINT SACKS. EVERYONE HATES FARMERS. EVERYONE HATES YOU.
---
Ok.
---
If legion‚Äôs timer doesn‚Äôt go down in terror radius then pig‚Äôs shouldn‚Äôt either. Get over it kid.
---
You have earned all my respect you brave, courageous soldier! Good luck at rank 1 with no ruin! I hope you destroy all those toxic survivors.
---
Kate just screams at him until his existence shatters and Jane gets him arrested for violating the restraining order.
---
A true surv main would say no and cleanse the poster.
---
Yes i have the same issue. Had 3 stacks but only got multplied for only 1 stack.
---
Thanks! I‚Äôm not very active on that forum.
---
Awwww this is so cute
---
lol look at this bad faith shit. It's like you're not even reading what I'm writing and are just screeching the same mantra over and over regardless
---
&gt;  Removing the exploits was necessary and giving Legion a greater level of counterplay was necessary
---
This is what I said. Your insane fucking comment seems to imply i didn't say this. Some of the nerfs Legion received *has nothing to do with what you listed there*. Holy fucking shit
---
Lmao next is they‚Äôll be making it to where if you‚Äôre sick and in Plauge‚Äôs TR you won‚Äôt go into the broken state
---
Yes, but the fact that it can happen at all is a problem.
---
I think the same, i mean, trapper is worst than PTB legion, same with LF, same with Doctor and same with probably the new Pig
---
His name is JonTron, he made some controversial statements and got alot of backlash for it. I think it was something about "black people commit all the crime" or something like that.
---
Thanks for the PSA but surely no one thought my shit post was an official announcement of anything.
---
"Lets see you smack your ass into the ground from up there, fucker"
---
You should buy perks for common killers like Billy and Nurse
---
You know what I just noticed? That necktie is way too short what is Bubba thinking?
---
same old same old. [dealing with people plugging their ears and screeching for no reason at people who mostly agree with them](https://np.reddit.com/r/deadbydaylight/comments/bgzgcp/really_though_the_nerfs_are_necessary/eloyyby/)
---
True tho
---
Survivor mains: maybe killers shouldn't rely on cheesy kills at the end of the match.
---
Killer mains: maybe you shouldn't feel so safe when the gates are powered like you're entitled to escape at that point.
---
Use your brain for both sides, pig is a weak killer as it is, at least it has counterplay unlike getting rancored.
---
No camping, no tunnelling, nerfed killers, a silver spoon up their ass and they'll still rage quit when they die because at the end of the day it's because they suck.
---
YOUR RIGHT! However others were banned for exploiting and abusing new players etc and now their back and no one cares its only this scape goat who they pretend is the only one who did wrong and ignore the rest.
---
Sure, but he was also running sub-optimal perks, so I think that kind of makes up for it. Replace all the crappy end game perks with Ruin and Discordance and you would have a nasty build, even without dirt.
---
It's a Leatherface, she knew what was gonna happen as soon as she saw him. **And so did you.**
---
How? Pig changes aside, I'm not seeing the problem. I guess the hatch always opens for the last guy now, but the hatch is usually open by that point anyways. You don't have to open an exit gate or close the hatch as killer if you don't want to. You can just opt to have the game play out as before until they open the gates and the timer starts. What's going on with griefing?
---
No, it's not. It's just the Pig mains are stupidly vocal, it's the same half-dozen folks making all the post then circle-jerking around them.
---
Might get downvoted to hell for saying this, but the legion nerf is really only a nerf if you abused moonwalking and Frank's. From the ptb he's much better to play as and against and his power works as it was originally intended. Breaking up survivors and forcing their time away from gens. It looks bad on paper but the way he plays now is a million times better.
---
Taking the game hostage is making the game impossible to end, not making the game unfun.
---
That sweet sweet 20 fps on any corn map. Unf.
---
I swear that keeps happening on PTB whenever someone is Legion. I had a Legion dc because the 2 i was playing with and a rando kept running over to heal me when i was downed
---
I know that they made it so Legion can‚Äôt see survivors‚Äô mend times in 2.7.0 to exclude built-in whispers. I expect them to do the same to Pig.
---
The part where you ended up speaking to them anyway dumb-ass.
---
Its not here to get you free kills though its the answer to the hatch standoff and toxic bming...
---
He's going to slow the dance down, just a little bit.
---
Wasn't zub, zub doesn't use his Twitter ever
---
I didn‚Äôt know it was Leatherface until that moment but it didn‚Äôt surprise me. I went and did gens while the other 3 traded basement time.
---
I am blind, I can't find the changes to her mechanic and I can't look at the news in game, got a link ?
---
thanks dadi
---
Then why doesn't she just use her assassin creed hidden blade if she wants them dead so bad? (This is the funniest lore debate I've had :p)
---
I think Shadowborn is a somewhat-viable choice on her, just by giving you more potential stuff to see and notice, as you say. She doesn't need chase perks as badly as some of the other killers, so there are some slots to play with there. I would not say it is as good on her as it is on Nurse however, since it improves vision during fatigue on the latter, which is extra-valuable.
---
Personally, I really prefer Predator on her over anything else. Tracking scratchmarks can be so frustrating, and she relies on it to a significant extent, especially with how inconsistent sounds in this game can be. Predator cleans scratchmarks up so much that you can actually precisely judge survivor movement based on them, and not only that, but it is very easy to identify double-backs with Predator, since the more grouped-together scratchmarks will naturally overlap a lot more noticably than usual scratchmarks, when the survivor retraces them, creating a very obvious dense patch.
---
Save The Best For Last is another great perk choice on her, since you can phase more quickly directly after landing a hit, which is rather effective because survivors will usually not try any fancy stuff with the hit sprint, but try to get as much distance as possible with it, making them easier to track. Obviously pairs well with add-ons that decrease the activation time.
---
Eh. Everyone can make their own decisions but I'd always at least hear out what people that play this game for a living have to say. Hell, if ochido came out saying "the new legion is actually broken because xyz" I'd still evaluate his points before going lol you don't know what you're saying because you're BAD.
---
Seems like that guy cant read.
---
Legion just needed his/her endless mend bug and his moonwalk fixed, but largely didnt need any other changes.
---
Pig having a trap on a survivors head should slow the endgame collapse like a downed survivor or hooked survivor does, but needs no other changes.
---
Change my mind
---
"I don‚Äôt need to complain about hit boxes"
---
- You don't need to complain about DC's either, but here you are.
---
"I didn‚Äôt even pick up the Claudette before she dc‚Äôd"
---
- Highly doubt that. Are you actually saying you WOULDN'T have picked her up? The fact that you haven't said it, and that fact that you say later that it's robbing the teammate of a hook-save only tells me you would have taken advantage.
---
"I didn‚Äôt try hard. I played casually."
---
- Highly doubt that too.
---
"I let the last survivor go"
---
- Oh, you MUST be a king. /s
---
"Do you know what Sympathy means?"
---
- Did you know it has more than one meaning? It also means "understanding between people; common feeling". So yeah, my use of the word is correct here.
---
"Even if the killer is playing toxic or you get cucked by a laggy hit box you shouldn‚Äôt dc because your wasting time for your teammates to gens and get the save."
---
- Gotta love the hypocrisy here. "It's A-OK for me to take advantage of a broken hitbox that I know is unfair (aka: bad sportsmanship), but it's not okay for the survivor to DC in return (aka: bad sportsmanship). Fuck that noise. 
---
"If you think survivors should leave a game just because it‚Äôs not going their way is right than your just delusional"
---
- Nobody wants to waste their time in a laggy game if they're likely going to be on the receiving end of more laggy hitboxes. It just means an easier time for the killer, whereas they'd rather go onto to a game with less lag.
---
i would dc if i saw the killer with the best map pressue using ruin
---
well maybe not because im on ps4 but i have still seen many pro ps4 nurses wrecking my ass so
---
I care where the killer is. It helps to know if I need to be ready to run lmao.
---
Completely agreed.
---
I laugh when i see a billy/nurse with ruin
---
Sure Legion is functional, but boring as hell to play now.
---
IDK I've been in a war and I still think Ash could take me, he has toonforce levels or durability.
---
Too real.
---
F*%# Bevahiour!
---
No thats my point make your own conclusions and then compare but dont just change yout oponion because a popular streamer said it was this way thats how they get these tweets. Yes if people feel the changes are bad then they should voice them and if streamer feels theyre bitching they shouldnt listen to him because he has a lot of hours on the game.
---
Thanks for the reply. I agree that predator is viable on Spirit, however a lot of people have critiqued it saying it can actually make scratch marks harder to see in some situations, like in cornfields. I also love STBFL on Spirit, it‚Äôs a great choice.
---
I dced against legions who exploited. Now that that‚Äôs impossible there‚Äôs no reason to dc against them anymore.
---
They can, it won't stop the collapse though because the exit gates are already powered.
---
That s exactly my tier list, XD.
---
This!!!
---
My personal addons are Class photo + Range addon. You can slow the game down to a crawl even without ruin
---
I laugh when I see a player complain about ruin.  It is barely a hindrance unless you're trash at the game.
---
Hell, David King could probably beat the shit out of the entity too.
---
Ace would just seduce them.
---
Nah
---
No. I kick ass and take names. Salt optional, but appreciated.
---
Twitter for android smh scott
---
I don't know what you're talking about.
---
The leather pants make me uncomfortable i love it
---
yeah, hitting great skill checks isnt even that hard past 50 hours. I only hate ruin because i play in console and most survivors there are absolute potatoes that will go explore the whole map after a ruin skill check pops.
---
fps on console is like between 10 and 20 fps and you can't turn fast after a blink with a controller even if you have it at 100% sensitivity so she's C tier at best on console
---
You don‚Äôt think pig should have an endgame build, but why?
---
Endgame build exist for variations on gameplay and game style strategies. NOED, Blood Warden, Fire Up, Rancor, STBFL, Hex DH, Adrenaline, Hope, Keys and other perks/Adonis exist for those kinds of builds. That was a unique feature of Pig‚Äôs power. This takes away a play style that hurts everyone. 
---
It‚Äôs also not like it has no counter play. If you see not many traps being used, you should go immersed or get a good looper to distract when the last gen pops. If someone did get a trap on their head, the others could distract the person so you can get it off. Similar to your statement, it is 4 vs 1, so it should not be easy to just escape by yourself, it should require teamwork.
---
I understand changing SOMETHING because the hatch can be shut, but all they had to do was make it so that if you are the last person any box will remove it.
---
Or OP can start The Revolution Of Smol Billies 2
---
I only feel anxious at the end for maybe the wrong reasons?? I main Trapper, and when there's one or two gens left I get so worried about laying traps around the exit ways. Time worries me more, but I also worry because half the time I'm not hunting survivors, just laying traps for them to fall into, and I feel like they'll always finish before I can lay them all down. Also just feels like other players get bored and annoyed because my traps seem to never fail, and I don't chase to down them, I chase them into my traps and just get them that way.
---
oof ouch that hurts my nurse main soul. def not getting dbd on switch now
---
No not really.
---
Real life barely makes me nervous, anxious, or scared so no a video game isn‚Äôt going to make me anxious either.
---
If you have anxiety issues I hope they get better.
---
Also practice makes perfect, find the killer that clicks with you whether it‚Äôs Hillbilly or Freddy learn the killer and you won‚Äôt feel scared or anxious.
---
The amount of survivors who hookdive , while they are obviously still in my terror radius would surprise you.
---
I run a full basement build if I want to have a good laugh, Agitation, Iron Grasp, Monstrous Shrine or BBQ (depending on offering)  and Territorial sometingsomething.
---
Quite often I don't make it 3 steps out of the basement before I turn around and see scratch marks leading down.
---
There are games where I struggle to get one kill, but more often than not I get a 3k or 4k.
---
You don't get showered in blood points (or pips since the update), but it's a living.
---
No need to die because someone has mcdonalds wifi
---
Your memes has the "test server" part wrong. The meme is: "People who disconnect against Legion".
---
Is this a motherFrAcKiN JoJo ReFeReNcE
---
Why don't you just buy them up to prevent them from appearing again?
---
Lol I guess I worded it wrong. Even though you don‚Äôt matter I guess, you can‚Äôt really change anything so by that same logic it‚Äôs nothing apparently
---
I think you're mistaking not tryharding with not playing the game. The point is that most of the people don't even test new or reworked stuff, they just jump into the game with their meta build they used for last few months, changing it only when one of the perks is nerfed and a new one rises to top 4 for a few months 
---
do you want me to believe that you're thoroughly testing if self care, sprint burst and adrenaline still work as intented? and you need to do it like minimum 15 times before you're really really sure? 
---
it's cool to test 'the usual' build sometimes, but its about % of people actually trying the reworked stuff which is kinda low for ptb
---
for most people PTB is just a place they can play new meta/new content faster and with unlimited items, so they bring out their pink/purple items and addons and go on a tryhard spree, because its ptb and you don't care about your loadout anyway
---
if you're playing to actually test shit, then these accusation were obviously not pointed at you
---
its about people who go to ptb just to use all the pink stuff they have without losing them on live servers
---
Been saving shards and praying this one was buyable with them. So happy !!
---
The way using is spelled in the meme makes me uncomfortable.
---
 5 seconds is a 25 percent decrease. Pretty significant. They already open too fast on live.
---
This is based off min-maxing add-ons and playing at rank 1, and the sheer fact that in my playstyle I'm very tryhard and will never really miss an attack on a survivor, or be hit by a pallet.
---
With Survivors it's a lot easier to mess up than it is for a killer, especially with how much leniency they give legion in the first place besides the missed attacks, the fact that you can outrun sprint burst/balanced landing/lithe even more than you could before, makes this power much better for me personally.
---
So thusly Legion, for me, is that high on the tier list and I'll be abusing them at higher ranks just because they feel pretty darn good now with how little mistakes I already make.
---
As for Huntress being better than Spirit..it's based on aim, really, you can mindgame and hit people further than Spirit's power can travel. I've watched a streamer who only plays Huntress and makes it a goal to snipe   players across map and lands 95% of their shots, it's just all about your aim and patience, really.
---
As for why Plague and Wraith are so low, it's again just personal experience, what I can get 4K's with consistently while trying my hardest and using the best add-ons at rank 1..with Plague even if I try my hardest, my power isn't nearly as strong as a huntress for having good aim, for it takes a lot longer to get that injury and a good survivor can make a plague mess up harder than a huntress main.
---
with Wraith it's just because his power at rank 1 is kinda pointless if all survivors are always paying attention, and also makes for turning him into a pure pallet eating champion due to the delay, you're usually better off not using your cloak mid-chase, so because it's not useful mid-chase, he's basically powerless for those moments and can sometimes sneak a free hit from it, similarly with Pig's lunge, but better.
---
No but they shouldn‚Äôt be able to message you anymore.
---
Its whatever man...im not the biggest fan of the way bhvr nerfs anything in game.
---
They just add it to their collection at this point
---
Hell, this is all just the set-up to BHVR releasing a RBT cosmetic for the survivors.
---
He didnt  need nerfs, he was a worst doctor back then, and now its SHJ
---
&gt;yall
---
Wait. You're not American?
---
I expected DbD character in Smash alongside amiibos but not this deadly trio.
---
My favorite and least favorite ones are the immerses ones. That‚Äôs how you truly counter nurse.
---
Probably yea
---
What about a 4 blink nurse with red mori in a 3v1 game
---
It's based on personal experience with both killers at Rank 1, as Plague I don't have the map pressure I would with Freddy by being invisible and being able to mindgame, since Plague is so tall mindgaming with her is basically impossible unless you're at killer shack.
---
And then her power is easily counterable with survivors playing certain ways, like never healing and just preventing you from actually getting your shrines, since being sick doesn't slow down repairs and at most just gives away where they are if they're hiding, but usually they just go for looping as much as possible.
---
With this I feel like her power CAN help her similar to how Sloppy Butcher can help you, but in this case her power is permanent and sloppy butcher is not. There are rare cases where I find Corrupt Vile to be what can make her stronger than Freddy, but again based off my experience at rank 1 it just feels like she can be easily abused with the players that know how to.
---
TRUE BUT EITHER WAY THE ABILITY TO LITERALLY IGNORE WALLS AND PALLETS IN THE CHASE IS STILL UBER STRONG REGARDLESS OF HOW GOOD YOU ARE AT OUT-JUKING HER
---
I sure did:)
---
Michael myers has always been amazing, legit think hes the only one thats perfect, clowns slighty below him.
---
Honestly, some people man
---
Unless you're Tru3 who never shuts the fuck up about it.
---
I always figured that choice was made by the entity with the key in boxes.
---
I have never once encountered survivors holding a game hostage in hundreds of games I have played on ps4. The worst is they just tbag at the gate, in which case all a killer has to do is charge them to force them out. The killer has quite a variety of options for catching survivors and on ps4 killers are very strong. Its a shame people on both sides would want to purposefully lengthen a game just to grief though. I had a wraith trap us in the basement once and caused us all to dc because we couldnt move past him.
---
Reeee
---
make one everyday until this game doesnt make me want to slam my head into a wall

Noob3 posted PTB legion video today on YouTube
---
I understand that. So why not just put on traps with 1 or 2 gens left? That does the same thing
---
I mean it isn't a hitbox because they clearly were shown as capsules but I did noticed the same "lumps" visible through auras of like hooks and such as killer so it could be potencially exploitable
---
Exactly, meaning her ONLY argument to being useful is basically invalid
---
I'd rather they mess with one of 57 current Killer perks than fuck with one of only 15 Killers (unless I'm forgetting one off the top of my head), especially one of the ones that doesn't deserve a nerf like Pig.
---
YOU KOBE LIKE A MAN!!!!!
---
Whenever I play him he just follows survivors around all game and stalks, and sure you can loop him and what not but u can‚Äôt do it forever.
---
This is probably why you think he's op. Just practice your looping and you should find going against him easier.
---
From the sound of it you quote on quote "kill rushed" lmaoo. You gotta let the game play out a bit... you gotta get more chase and destruction.. just because you get a 4k doesnt mean you automatically get a pip I guess you gotta put work in..
---
_Laughs in disconnect_
---
&gt;Gets BBQ and chilly
---
Maybe wear a jacket?
---
Fuck yah she is it took me a few weeks to be decent with her and depending on what map I land on it can still be a bitch and I‚Äôm on PS4
---
You deserved it...
---
That makes sense. Its that I killed 4 people, that all pipped and I pipped once too. If killer kills all 4, it should be a automatic double pip. 32k points and only 1 pip? Cmon
---
Tier 1 is 2 stacks, tier 2 is 3 stacks, and tier 3 is 4 stacks.
---
See, I don‚Äôt agree with that but I can come to peace with that. That‚Äôs at least somewhere in the realm of fair. Disabling the Pig‚Äôs traps when survivors already have a very generous window to escape isn‚Äôt.
---
Just play it at least it will be over quickly
---
As someone who suffers to this strategy regularly, I can only hope its because they think I'm coordinated. Sucks to be targeted because I do survivor objectives almost every game though.
---
Game was 18 minutes long, broke almost all rhe pallets on the map and won 60% of my chases
---
And that always sucks. I'm torn between just dying on the hook and getting it over with, or dragging it out so my teammates can get as many gens as possible done. Whats it gonna be, giving the asshole killer as much stand around with thumb up his ass time? Or help some team mates out time? &gt;_&lt; Either way, it sucks. Sorry about your bad killer.
---
I want to but sometimes you friendly messages and find people you can play with again that you know aren't toxic so I guess I'll just try remember the toxic gamertags for now :s
---
*sad oink*
---
It's in the ptb change log at the top of the sub.
---
Can you elaborate how it favors survivors more I'm interested in your though process.
---
Maybe. Idk he always follows survivors around and then one hits people. I try looping and all but you can only do it for so long before he gets you.
---
Too busy making new killers to fix a survivor problem. 
---
I‚Äôm still waiting for the grass to stop moving when walking under ground below it...since beta....
---
Then don't whine when killers slug/camp/tunnel more than ever going forward.
---
Also something about fearing white people will become the minority.
---
Thats the sweetest little sad oink :(
---
I just hate the extreme miss penalty
---
Man, sometimes I stay there just to let the survivors run their mouths after a game and some people just want to spread the negative energy they accumulated while being salty during the game. So they choose the killer to shit on and feel better. Unload and off ya go. Try not to mind it, because they will always be sweaty and upsetti.
---
You're going to get a lot of Freddy answers since he is agreed upon as the worst killer in the game by everyone
---
Yes you can thats why myers is a mid tier killer he can stop pallet looping he can cut distances. He gets vaulting speed increase and thats it. Only rank 20s think myers OP. thats the whole reason he has stealth hits because he has to try in get a free hit in. How long have you played the game?
---
If it's active you can't leave with it on
---
Brilliant idea.
---
That was a joke bud. I'm not actually accusing you.
---
Yea it's not like they play the game for a living and have 1000's of hour invested and probably understand the game better than the average player but what do I know.
---
Not sure maybe 6 months or so
---
Don't waste the toolbox on the first gen
---
What? The nurse is the most difficult and burdened killer in the game, why would she need to be nerfed? God all this whining, complaining, and unsolicited "how to improve the game" bullshit is exhausting
---
I get you, fam. I ran into waaaay to many beefy ass Survivor Team 6 SWFs that derank to wreck new players and now I as well have anxiety making things entertaining too.
---
That is why I now practically solely play Farm Doc and focus on getting BPs. Makes the game less stressful, you get to learn how survivors move and stuff in a "lower risk" game and you generally just get to actually have fun, and get a fuckton of BPs for it.
---
Don't forget those juicy DC points when they figure out what you're trying to do
---
Sorry I know I re-read and was like ''well fuck.'' :l
---
Oh...thats why. Just wait a little long before calling any killer OP.
---
E
---
Do survivors not understand how the egc works?? It doesnt even occur untill AFTER THE GATES ARE OPENED. then you guys have a full THREE MINUTES, to stand in the exit gate and t bag the killer. And even then! The egc meter SLOWS DOWN when  there is an INJURED SURVIVOR AND IT SLOWS DOWN MORE WHEN PEOPLE ARE HOOKED. LITERALLY NOTHING IS CHANGING. BHVR is a steaming pile of shit and they are all survivor mains.
---
The amount of posts I've seen wanting to nerf her and billy atm is disturbing :/
---
Where does it say that here?
---
https://deadbydaylight.gamepedia.com/Barbecue_%26_Chilli
---
Lmaooooo you right... I save mine
---
And what does that have to do with anything?
---
Siiiiigh, let's just nerf the game. Let's just make it SO easy and SO dumbed down that you win by logging in
---
As a survivor I love maps with corn, but I can‚Äôt see shit as killer so I don‚Äôt like that one. It‚Äôs really hard to see through corn while playing as pig, and she‚Äôs my main so I hate those maps for killer
---
That's the entire point of the change. Even on maps where you can't see through the walls, jungle gyms are already some of the strongest structures for survivors (outside of certain main buildings with strong windows or drop-downs, and some unique tiles like cow tree and god bus). It is straight-up gamebreaking when these already-strong tiles have a built-in advantage for the survivor running the tile that makes it impossible for them to be mindgamed as long as they are paying attention. See-through walls literally make L-T walls force m1 killers to spend like 45 seconds just to get a single hit on a survivor that plays properly, and the killer isn't even able to force the survivor to burn a pallet in the process.
---
Hopefully it doesn't sound like I'm mad at you in particular or anything, but I hope that explanation helps you reframe the change in your mind a bit. The change isn't so much about "buffing" killers, but it makes it so they at least have chances to outplay survivors on coldwind maps, where previously, the outcome more or less rested only on the competence of the survivor running the tile.
---
Me too I like to keep responding with ''Ok'' and let them make a fool of themselves xD
---
Welcome back
---
No one said she was OP..
---
What add-ons/perks do you use and what do you do when farming with doc?
---
So I AM blind, thanks. &lt;3
---
Tho I disagree on the hard punishes if you miss
---
Holy shit these are nice.
---
Thank you for this üòç
---
i hope we still get the bloody valentine dlc because it would be awesome
---
"Newest Patch: All killers are reduce to just one named Thunk. Thunk has no powers, add-ons, perks just fists for a weapon. To down a survivor Thunk must hit the survivor ten times. Each hit or miss results in a twenty second stun. Thunk also moves 1.0 m/s.
---
Survivors now move at 8.0 m/s and no longer become exhausted. Any haste perk grants an additional 500% speed increase. All generators are repaired at the start to 90% and repair speed up 700%. It now takes 2 seconds to open the gates and the hatch is opened at the start of the match. Point emotes now result in triple pips and killers forever at rank 50.
---
Pretty Good Job So Far."
---
Edit: /s incase
---
#prayforamanda
---
Roflmao. Monto has to voice Jake.
---
Nurse is not burdened at all, she completely negates the strongest tool survivors have (looping) while maintaining high mobility? She‚Äôs not nearly as difficult as some people say. If any killer is in need of a nerf, it‚Äôs her. Atleast her addons, anything more than 3 blinks is waaaaay too much.
---
I like but hate the changes on Legion but I kinda understand were ppl are coming from on both side.
---
On the survivor's side, Legion is just no fun with ez kill and exploits. Legion players over do it with his power.
---
On the killer's side, the nerf is unfair because survivors can't beat a legion player. They dc instead of loop or come up with newer tactics. They send hate mail no matter if they win or lose.
---
When I face a Legion my goal isn't only to just get the gens done but to have the satisfaction of beating him. No nasty message after because he used Legion but a legitimate GG for there effort and a well played match.
---
&gt;24 hours a day it seems given by how often you post lol.
---
What's wrong with being active on the subreddit? 
---
&gt;You're right you just complain about anything that makes killers strong.
---
I have expressed my opinion about things I find too strong/problematic/badly designed. If you want to discuss them I'm free to talk to. I might just have different opinions than you, sorry.
---
Trapper. Without. Traps. Come at me.
---
Nah they look like a good match honestly.
---
Pretty much, and the type of players that opt-in to PTBs tend to be less casual anyway, obviously you're going to see a lot of players that play to win.
---
'most difficult'. No. She really isn't. It's what killer mains say because they're scared that the nurse will be nerfed to the level of Freddy.
---
She needs a few tweaks. Get rid of all addons that add extra blinks. Make it so the nurse has even less visibility when blinking and a slightly longer stun.
---
I say this because at the moment we have a killer that can literally teleport through walls, pallets, can have up to 5 blinks and insane mobility. She is also the best killer with many perks, such as NOED and BBQAC (although you could argue hillbilly is better with BBQAC.
---
Yeah, that's the thing with dedicated servers. People think it'll fix lag problems
---
You can see the stain through walls on low settings
---
If we get Ghostface I‚Äôm almost certain he‚Äôll talk to some extent.
---
Trapper has by far the best cosmetics. Might start maining him because of it
---
Is it? I find it pretty common and i‚Äôm fucking terrified of clowns.
---
Nurse and billy aren‚Äôt OP, if nurse and billy were OP I could get easy 4ks every game. Do I? No
---
Thanks for the advice! I sent a ticket in and they said they will be crediting my account with a ‚Äúconsiderable‚Äù amount of bloodpoints for all the times it hasn‚Äôt worked üòÇ BHVR you have redeemed yourselves.
---
Different opinions or constantly arguing in bad faith? Because that's all I ever see you do.
---
Tbh, I‚Äôve never played against a Freddy. I‚Äôm usually stuck around rank 18 cause I‚Äôm trash lol 
---
I see more Trappers and Billies.
---
i swear every lobby with russians as the killer in it for me have 1000+ ping  and they tryhard with that bad connection too
---
Intentionally missing a skillcheck to draw agro away from a hooked survivor  =  Universe Brain
---
I‚Äôve yet to have this happen to me, why does BHVR dislike me?
---
Whatever you say
---
That‚Äôs really bad logic. Like if I said, ‚Äúif old DS was overpowered, I would‚Äôve survived every game.‚Äù
---
Again I don't see how is that relevant to the topic of this thread.
---
Give me some examples, we can talk in private messages if you'd be up for that instead of going off topic in this thread.
---
Sure thing
---
i dont fully agree with this but i like the first half. the time i feel, as monto said in his latest video, the time should be decreased because it still gives PLENTY of time for survivors to bm the killer at the exit gate and teabag and shit.
---
It‚Äôs true that the nurse requires skill to be played, but it‚Äôs also true that when played well, she completely breaks DBD‚Äôs mechanics. Pallets, windows and structures are completely useless against her. She shouldn‚Äôt get a nerf, but a rework.
---
Survive with friends
---
I can't help but read your comment with the heaviest Russian accent my head can come up with... :D
---
Yeah billy is one of the best in the game, trapper is common since he's the "default" killer. 
---
Freddy is very rare for people to buy since Freddy himself is trash, and Quentin is also very lackluster
---
Pretty much. Those asking for servers just think they fix everything lag and hitbox related.
---
Just make it so that any box can remove a trap if you are the last person. That way if the killer closes the hatch, you have time to remove the trap.
---
I'm glad I have Reddit to think of all the questions I would never dream of

---
It was exactly the same with For Honor. 
---
Dedicated servers came and the lag was the same. The only change was that the game wasn't over when the host DCd. But here if the killer DCs the match is over anyway.
---
Them being killer mains doesnt mean they are good or an authority on what is or isnt balanced as a killer. It just means they play that side internally and it seems fine to them because they all seem to play at mid or low ranks.
---
If this is their attempt at balance I would hate to see what happens if they decide to "Address" the fact that Billy and nurse are the top picked characters in red ranks. Chances are only spirit can possibly take their place but knowing the devs I would say they would just never buff any killer who was mid tier and nerf the top then expect people to continue playing killer as they climb the ranks then feel useless at red ranks.
---
Had to tell a newer player this yesterday, envious of my bloody clothing. No dude. I'm fucking terrible, please don't rely on me
---
Have you tried checking out any content creators who are good survivors? You can learn a lot from watching how they deal with certain killers. The other good way to learn is to play the killer as it increases your understanding of what they need to do to win so you can counter it.   
---
If you can pallets are your best friend with him. If you loop right then stun him you can waste his tier 3. With Myers he has limited amount of stlk he can get off every survivor so wasting a tier 3 with no downs is pretty big. Obviously this doesn't work if he has a build for infinite tier 3 but you will know this because he will stalk for ages and not tier up, if this happens you need to gen rush and try to stay out of his sight as it could mean he has a tombstone too.
---
Jesus you‚Äôre too much of a brick to reason against.
---
Oh ok. Thanks for the reply.
---
Less pressure to remove your RBT even during normal gameplay, since the timer now stalls within her terror radius.
---
It‚Äôs not entirely useless it‚Äôs just more about getting an easy first hit now
---
You have the best arguments. I bet you're the kind of person that thinks if they don't get a 4k every game it's unbalanced.
---
I‚Äôd love to hear your dumbass illogical self explain how exactly getting a prestige will increase your chance of getting the perk you want.
---
2 things 1 how are they buffing it and 2 you basically just explained how it is now minus the totems. You repair gens 15/20/25% faster for every gen left when you are the only one alive meaning with 5 gens left you do gens at 75/100/125% faster 4 gens 60/80/100% faster etc etc
---
It's PTB dude. I didn't care what I brought in, when I used it or whatever. I just wanted the entity to kill me at the end.
---
I like the lmao. Like what i said is ludicrous. Youll understand eventually
---
i don't get it, did that survivor forget that the main big things about the PTB are the Endgame Collapse and Legion changes? did he go in, expecting to NOT go up against a single Legion? and why did he DC anyway? Legion is fair now, you won't get cheesed to death with his power anymore.
---
as for why the Legion DCed, i have no idea lmao. best case scenario is that the killer didn't want to play a 3man game
---
Not really, if a killer were op then most people should be able to get easy 4ks. If they require skill, like nurse and billy, and people just get good with them then the survivors should find a way to combat their play style.
---
Everyone seems to be jumping into nerfing killers they don‚Äôt know how to play against because it leads to their death. For nurse run back at them after they‚Äôve held a blink for a little bit. For billy run behind objects, move to the side, or just get lucky and he misses somehow.
---
Killers need more options for playstyles, not less.
---
Increased base movement speed. It‚Äôs a very big deal
---
Ok real talk I am cool with them getting rid of 3+ blink nurse, there's really no need for those, but people here are talking entire rework, honestly what bothers me atm.
---
You‚Äôve got to let your friend know he has bad fashion sense
---
Oh then let me clarify-- What you said is ludicrous.
---
AHHHHHH
---
A massive speed boost. Now not only does he break the rules of the game and remove survivors ability to escape a killer, but also can catch right up and down someone right after his fury is gone. 
---
His ability to double hit a survivor during fury is removed. Oh no how bad (/s).
---
They'll now stay 2:55 just live dangerously and watch the Entity take over, even the ones who would normally have left immediately.
---
just taking a quick pish!
---
You can pip, if you somehow catch more than one survivor
---
Old sprint burst with old balanced landing plus all these new exhaustion perks can now have the 20 second cooldowns as well
---
Whoa wtf. No, none of that. Jesus Christ man relax. I just don't want to argue with you. Your response was very terse and it seemed like you have your mind made up.
---
I figured as much but I just wanted to be sure. I know this game has some stupid ass made up ethics but I've never gone too far into it so I didn't know if I was breaking some unspoken rule
---
i still debate launch legion was stronger than freddy, now its way easier to tell
---
I love Yamaoka's as survivor but I can't see shit there when I play killer. Same goes to corn maps. 
---
Aesthetically my favorite one has to be Mother's Dwelling. Rainy, foggy forest is my landscape of choice
---
Nah. They made a lower-tier killer unarguably weaker. It's not the end of the world, just a completely asinine nerf without corresponding buffs, and we're vocalizing it.
---
Pretty much. If you have mashed potato ping you're still going to lag no matter if it's p2p or  dedicated servers. If you get frame lag it's still gonna happen.
---
Spam ambush while playing pig and make a song from the growls or whatever it is
---
Lol what a fun strawman.

I cannot believe that they nerfed DS. It really did take a lot to master... and because of that it wAs aBsOluTeLy fInE

Had this happen last night. Just wait until you get hooked oh boy do those auras get attracted to you
---
Also she isn‚Äôt getting nerfed because it‚Äôd probably kill the whole concept of the character and leave her too weak. I think she‚Äôs past that point, the only viable solution might be a rework.
---
after so many hours. So many teabags, so many body blocks, so many flashlights.
---
it‚Äôs time to get back at those plucky little shits

don‚Äôt know why this is getting downvoted. if it‚Äôs a 3 player game it‚Äôs fine if you leave. waste of fuckin‚Äô time unless it‚Äôs 4 players.

don‚Äôt disconnect for any other reason tho. if you‚Äôre on a time crunch, just don‚Äôt queue. don‚Äôt ruin other people‚Äôs games.

Wish it was a full miners suit this cosmetic kinda sucks imo the only thing cool is the mask
---
Ah, so no argument again. Great discussion going on here, really made me change my mind!
---
Wtf happened to him?
---
I enjoy the maps like Haddonfield and Elm Street just because of the houses. Even though the houses are built for ants, I enjoy the idea of running from a killer around a house like in classic slasher films.
---
I THINK IM FINALLY OVER THIS TRASH GAME. EVERY GAME IS FULL OF DCS, CAMPING, LAG, LAGSWITCHING, BUGS, CAMPING, CAMPING  AND CAMPING. EVERYTIME A PLAYER DCS A GEN SHOULD AUTO POP. YOUD THINK THE KILLERS WOULD GIVE YOU A BREAK IF YOURE SHORT SURVS BUT THEY JUST GET EVEN MORE TOXIC. ITS LOST ITS NOVELTY. IT WILL DIE. AND IT HAD SUCH POTENTIAL. ID RATHER BULLSHIT AROUND FRIDAY THE 13TH AND RP THEN TRY TO ADAPT TO THIS BROKEN DISASTER. AND THE COSMETICS ARE TOO MUCH AND HONESTLY SUCK. YOUD THINK WE COULD ATLEAST HAVE THAT.
---
Im a console pleb so i know nothing about icon packs except that they exist...do the devs like em or dont like em? Because i would honestly love to get one officially on my console

Holy shit dude, RELAX.

Survivor update: all medkits contain some tums. No longer vomit or enter broken state.
---
DID YOU JUST CALL ME SOFT?!?! You can‚Äôt say that man, I‚Äôm fragile
---
New cosmetics
---
Even without perks and toolboxs gens can be done stupid fast. Also, all gens being done isn't survivor victory. To me, it's when the game gets interesting. (on survivor side, and you have to hook save)
---
Ugh, i would love to use these but with the amount of time and money I've sunk into this game I would be too nervous of being banned.
---
C? She wasnt C. Shes decent. Solid B
---
THIS BULLSHIT HAPPENED TO ME TWICE. POP OUT STUN AND GRABBED.
---
I think shit like this is inevitable in an asymmetric multi-player game. Regular games are hard enough to balance, but assymetirc ones are almost impossible to get right. Evolve went through the same shit. Unnecessary balance updates one after the other until all the people that gave a shit stopped playing.
---
Omg that killer would be really cool in DBD
---
&gt; normal amount of skill and give normal results,
---
Yeah but playing against an optimal af swf group fucks up that balance. Nurse isn't a killer to deal with the new players, she's a killer to deal with the experienced ones. She requires more skill for better results to help us against the 4 man swf that can play extremely optimally. By all means get rid of her addons that add extra blinks, that I agree has little to no counterplay and ins't needed, but she doesn't need a whole new rework.
---
I agree with the other poster. Can you link to several videos of M1 killers at Rank 1 who get 4Ks without using their power?
---
I have a really hard time believing your statement. Else you would see many Trappers at high ranks.
---
aah too bad. They don't ban you for it, but the EAC system can ban you. They say: use it with caution
---
I'm really worried about dedicated servers. Ping won't change, killers will now be affected by lag (if it's the same as it is in kyf if the killer isn't the host then it's gonna be dreadful) and I can just imagine all of the bugs that will be happening.
---
We get tons of bugs when they update the engine, imagine what will come when they rework their entire network, lol.
---
To be fair, I downvoted you for the strawmanning, the idea that killer players are frustrated that BHVR didn't make it easier to 4K instead of them actually responding the nerfs. I don't feel you're posting in good faith, and so I don't believe your posts are contributing to discussions here. IMO people are using the downvote system correctly ITT.
---
I never understand these arguments that devs favour one side or the other. Literally makes no difference to them, they'd obviously want the game to be balanced  so more people buy and play the game.
---
