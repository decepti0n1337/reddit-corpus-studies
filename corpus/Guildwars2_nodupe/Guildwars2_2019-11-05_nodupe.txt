---
i seriously dont know why they do this. just make people type DELETE like every other game.
---
ooooh, interesting!
---
Why do poeple think that they don't like what i like so i shouldn't like it.
---
?
---
Thief is fine in all of the above.  In raids and fractals you need to be on point due to your lower HP, use your evades well and stack with the group to receive boons/get revived.  But you do good DPS, and people like good DPS.
---
except you don't get to buy any subs, because every Quiznos within 150 miles went out of business a decade ago.
---
Well, when I gave my earlier advice saying you don't need to go to the expansion zones if you don't want to, I did mention you'd need to deal with that annoying message. ;)
---

---
You'll have no alternative beyond running through the intro mission for one of the expansions as dak393 says.
---
loolks like you didnt even start
---
There’s a few Quiznos where I live, and they do a fair bit of business. But I must ask why? Why of all places to advertise your game you choose a sandwich shop to promote it.
---
I can faceroll on reddit just as easily.
---
&gt; You're the one talking about "everyone who wants and item to have said item." That implies that acquisition would be available to the lowest common denominator of effort level, which is, essentially log-in reward, if even that. These aren't hard concepts.
---
I think that's a bit of a leap. They should have the items *eventually,* through a *reasonable* amount of time and effort. I never implied "log-in rewards."
---
&gt;Any price that both a buyer and seller agree upon and transact upon is fair and reasonable by definition.
---
Lol, no. That's not how ANYTHING works. 
---
This is *especially* true in a game, where supply is entirely constrained by the systems developers *choose* to put in place, as opposed to the real world in which supply is at least nominally constrained by the nature of reality. 
---
If an item in the game is super rare, and a person who has it will only except a high price for it, and a person who wants it is willing to pay that, then I can't fault either of their choices, but that does not mean that the situation is "fair" or "reasonable." The customer should not be in the position of having to accept that deal to get that item. The item should not be so rare in the first place. 
---
&gt;Your main issue seems to be that you wish there was a deterministic way to acquire X items without RNG or without being required to trade either on the TP or grey market.
---
Among other things, yes, that would be a good start.
---
&gt;From a game design perspective, you have to realize that a variety of rewards obtainable from a variety of acquisition methods, some deterministic and some RNG is actually good for an MMO because player tastes vary widely within the community. 
---
No. 
---
Yes, people's tastes vary, but that's no excuse. The thing is, tastes vary not only in acquisition methods, but also in goals. If you have item A, which is like some sword skin that can be earned through a steady collection process, and item B, which is a hammer skin that can only be earned through extreme RNG and a secondary market, you seem to look at that and go "good, everyone's happy, the deterministic guy can get the sword and the RNG/market guy can get the hammer." Except it's never worked like that, because odds are that while *some* people will be fine with that, there are also likely plenty of deterministic people with no interest in that sword skin that only want the hammer, and RNG/market people with no interest in the hammer and only want the sword, for various reasons. 
---
When you have a system with so many moving parts, it's unlikely that they will all match up in an ideal configuration.
---
That's why I believe *all* options should be on the table. 
---
If you prefer RNG, there should be RNG methods of getting *every* item. 
---
If you prefer deterministic paths, there should be deterministic paths to *every* item. 
---
Choose the one *you* prefer. 
---
Some paths can be easier than others, favoring one approach or the other so that people pursing things "the right way" have a quicker route to the goal, but the worst path should still be a reasonable one, not excessively onerous just to spite the people who pursue it. NO player should be left at the whims of what *another* player is willing to charge for the item they want.
---
All the above is true. I would however recommend you make a character in every character slot because characters accrue birthday gifts every year and these give we very exclusive rewards. If you think you'll ever try a different profession or even if you don't, make alts for the gifts at least.
---
That what we need, another person trying to justify time is money in a MMo.
---
I think you should stop buying entertainment products and go back to work if you think like this.
---
This so much. Marketing is great, marketing without taking 2 seconds to google the company for your promotion is absolute nonsense. I’m sensing a cheap deal made.
---
I just got back from Quiznos with my tasty meatball sub! (much better than Subways).
---
So they had a small GW2 poster at the register, and the screen on the register kept flashing the GW2 add.
---
Once you pay, they give you a business card with the codes on it. I thought it would be on the receipt, but it's not.
---
So you may have to ask for the card if they don't hand you one. Free stuff, I'm not complaining!\~
---
Darknest, probably. Not sure if it's one word or two.
---
Maybe certain.. uh... roleplay adventures...
---
They've done some dell and other similar ones that went well to be fair.
---
I always feel like these marketing promos only help the ones anet partners with, but not really anet themself.
---
They were able to with GW1.. so much so that they were in such good shape they developed a GW2. Lol
---
I deal in actual words, not perceived words. It's comes from years of being an editor. If someone says to me, I need to face reality about something subjective, I'm always going to say something. I don't care if you personally think what he said was okay. That's your prerogative. I don't and said so. And that's the last I'll say on the matter. Feel free to get the last word.
---
But 1 USD &gt; 1 CAD in value. Don't know the exact prices in CAD but still.
---
Haha, same. It's a testament to how good some of the mount skins are, because I have no problem spending money on character slots or bag slots, but when skins came out I was like "I will never drop money on THOSE things."
---
Now I'm that person that gets irked I missed the fox skin for the raptor and wants it to come back. XD
---
There is legit no quiznos less than an hour drive from me due to subway being better at marketing and promos. And guess what, anet partners with them LOL.
---
If they start putting Spongmonkeys minis in GW2, I'm out... :p
---
Just discovered Quiznos still exists in my area. Legitimately had no clue until now, so I’d chalk this up as a marketing “win” (for Quiznos).
---
lol cool, there isn't a single one within miles of NYC

It’s either this or monthly subscription fees. Personally, I like being able to pay for little things I want here and there, rather than $15 a month whether or not I’m actually logging in.
---
The name isn't even the problem. They could call it gems if they want to, just make 1 gem = 1 currency. Still there is the problem of different currencies. So let's say you make 1 gem equal 1 USD. What if someone doesn't pay in USD? Will they still see credit? If I pay with EUR (1 USD = 0.9 EUR) then 1 credit = 0.9 EUR. So this again would be a so called "fake currency".
---
why do you think we're getting a mount
---
isn't it obvious
---
P2w kind? Which dbag gave you that info. I'm not the biggest fan of anet and how they've been pushing out content in the last couple of years. But there is NO pay 2 win shit at all in the gem store or the trading post/market. Anything stat wise to make your character best in slot on every gear, you can acquire by simply playing the game, having the expansions(obviously), and not having used $1 on the gem store. So you can buy the game fresh for $30 and be as competitive if you play enough in any game mode than any whale who has dropped $10k+ over the years.
---
It might be obvious to you but not to me. The mastery was already announced to be spirits of the wild related and will be raven this first episode (which I'm pretty hyped about because my main is a Norn who chose Raven as his wild spirit). 
---
Not sure where you pulled that one off.

I'll add a third one:
---
* Not in every country can you just stay longer at work and get paid more. If you cannot then the equation changes from spending time to get either money or ingame gold to spending money or spending time to get ingame gold.
---
   * Moreover, you may not even be allowed to take a secondary job to fund your gaming hobby either in that case.
---
It's okay compared to the B-tier classes but falls behind DH, Weaver and Soulbeast.  It's a super solid class for plugging, but when you start playing with better players it's value gradually drops.
---
A food chain promo to bring in new players is not a bad idea. The problem is...it's Quiznos. Quiznos has shut down in many states. It's a dying brand.
---
cuz why would subway want anything to do with gw2? clearly they cannot afford to pay that much, given their partnering with shady, small and unknown brands like kft and brands that have seen better days like quiznos.
---
What the fuck is Quiznos?
---
LOL
---
If those were listed at dollar amounts they would be $9.99, $24.99, $6.99, $4.99
---
twitch promos work for games that have something to offer, especially if that game is something people enjoy watching (not gw2). all they have to do is pay for some trailers on youtube and some normal ads on the sides of websites, that's it.
---
Oh... oh no... That's really sad and seems plausible.
---
How is it obvious?
---
&gt;fun fact, the only reason the gold-&gt;gem and gem-&gt;gold prices stay somewhat stable is because the same amount of people use both. So saying people should just do gold-&gt;gems instead of paying is very naive.
---
Yeah. This is "Everyone should go to law/medical/STEM/trade apprenticeships/whatever" school. The advice is inherently flawed because it becomes untrue if any real number of people follow it.
---
I'm making some ground beef for dinner as we speak. I'll think fondly of this moment while I eat it.
---
It sounds exactly like a basic "rewards" or "loyalty" app that literally every chain restaurant, coffee shop, gas station, etc uses these days.
---
In case it wasn't clear, this promo doesn't require any app download, account creation, or any submission  of information to get a code -- you just walk into a shop, buy a sandwich, get a card with a code.
---
Just finished Cooking 500 last night. This will be handy. Kudos!
---
If they use custom audiences based on account e-mails (illegal in EU) they could easily run some cheap reacquisition / upsell campaigns which I can guarantee would run efficiently. CAs can cut your spending by 90%. That being said, you're probably right about gaming being very influencer heavy because of the hype culture.
---
Stop promoting healbrand for fractals. Go quickness/condi firebrand and have the rev heal.
---
&gt;Its completely optional and its only for QoL, like most bought stuff in the store.
---
All "optional quality of life" features in Guild Wars 2 are really just examples of designed inconvenience that ArenaNet then sells you the fix to.
---
&gt;You're all complaining about what Anet is selling for $5, have you seen what other games out there are selling? $12 for a single champion skin that can only be used and seen every other 20min. 
---
"Something else is worse, therefore this is good", classic fallacy.
---
Yet another marketing facepalm
---
Looks for quiznos around me...10 miles away. 
---
Nah I'm good.
---
That's very, very true.
---
I checked and two locations in my town are closed and so is the one in the nexr town over but there still one left 25 kilometers away... so im getting a sub when Im in Niagara Falls next week LOL
---
I am getting this sub so hard
---
If you're planning to play both raids and fractals, you should learn both. Druid is taken in nearly every raid encounter due to its ability to provide might and spirit buffs to all 10 players. In fractals, though, a renegade/firebrand combo is much more efficient at buffing a party of 5, and both can be played as a DPS-support hybrid or a healer as necessary.
---
Here's the other half of that I feel like people are missing - I'm a "lifestyle" whale. I don't drop money in the game because I must have the new skin, I want that legendary super quick, or I need to gamble 1,000 Black Lion Chests on Youtube, I simply spend money in GW2 instead of doing other more extroverted things. I don't go out with friends a ton, since many are overseas or in other states. I don't have a club scene, I rarely go out to movies, and I loathe waterparks and other big events with massive crowds of humanity.
---
**I'm not saying any of those things are bad options, they're just not what I would prefer to do with my limited free time.** So instead of spending money on those things, I spend money on GW2. Not a ton, maybe $50-100 a month, but it's "fun" money I'm not spending on other things, and I would rather say, buy half the mithril and wood to make a legendary and spend 2-3 hours of my paycheck than spend literally hundreds of hours farming those same mats. So yeah, it's money spent that I'll never see again, but so was that pizza you ate last week or the beer you had on Friday watching the game. As long as we all had fun, who cares?
---
I'm also partially disabled, so GW2 is a way to explore on days where my pain is really bad and I can't get around as much. For me, I still love playing after four years because I only ever spend time doing what I want to do in game. If I want to do story content, I do that. If I want to chase down mastery points, I do that. If I don't feel like doing the dailies, I skip them and do something else, like finish an achievement, experiment with builds, or run a meta I haven't done in a while. Sometimes I just take a new character and explore a zone and stop to listen to random NPC dialogue and find cool vistas to screenshot (there is some HILARIOUS dialogue in the Metrica Province area right by the gate to Rata Sum). Sometimes I'll do fractals or WvW when I want to, sometimes I do world boss trains. Raids are sadly impossible with my 300+ ping rate and occasional DC issues, so I save the hardcore 100% achievements stuff for my non-internet dependent games.
---
So yeah, I totally understand why some people would rather grind every last item and never spend real money, I'm just not that person. (That being said, even being a mini-whale of sorts can't induce me to buy some stuff; build templates NEVER should have been monetized at all. I had that stuff in FFXIV for free and I spent far LESS money on that game every month when I played; why would I pay for it here?)
---
Because this sub is mostly filled with PvE casual players by far than anything else.

Firebrand is way more fun to play. You spam aegis, quickness and stability, boons that can hard carry the team depended on the boss. With the trait purity of purpose allies that block with your aegis get healed which is really strong. You also have access to reflects, projectile blocks, a lot of different pulsing heals, good condi cleanse with a mantra, a good rezz skill with Mercifull Intervention, decent might, resistance which is quite unique. Cc can be dependend on your build either really good or pretty garbage and if you don't use staff you might encounter lack  of swiftness.
---
never heard of Quiznos be4 clicking on this post.
---
Well almost every hobby expenses can be likewise terrible if you find the wrong kind of spender. Lego and Magic did not build their wealth on fair prices either. And don't ask me how much some of our grandparents spent on miniature trains. And that's only for gaming hobbies. Ever wondered how much money you spend if your fun involves night clubs?
---
If it is your hobby and you have money you are bound to spend a fair amount on it. An amount you won't necessarily be comfortable with if you ever do the maths.

i thought about destroying the golem part drops @ sandswept isles... but with the "IX20893 left templete blabla" i kinda dropped that plan and have them occupying bag slots instead of suffering through this.

Yeah, atleast i can get any traction there though for discussion.
---
and made ascended crafting mats the most common thing on this planet... every copper ore is more precious than bloodstone dust and the other two ones. i got some thousands of them saved till i find out what they really are for, and probably about 10k of them destroyed yet, if not more.
---
still, sofar no use for me.
---
Because Smite is a game focused on gameplay, competition and improving. This is the most casual an MMORPG can ever get.  
---
Most people don't care about builds, build discussion or anything like that; people who care about these have other places to discuss it (or at least used to have, when the hardcore playerbase still existed, not sure anymore).
---
Obviously, I'm talking efficiency and value.  If one doesn't have money to spend, then it's moot, you only have one choice in that equation.  Just realize everyone's time has value.  If that time means 0.88$/hr, and you accepta that, so be it.
---
Any game does that, so what ?
---
League Of Legends, the biggest game in the world, uses "Riot Points".
---
It's a business tactic.
---
Remember when this game was B2P for the first few years? While yeah there were some super costly things on the cash shop I don't recall it being nearly as fucking desperate to milk everyone as it is nowadays. I said it back then and I'll say it again: F2P was a mistake.
---
Exactly right!  Some like the grind, and thus they are playing in a way they like.  In which case, as I mentioned, my OP doesn't count because it's then "entertainment."   I'm only refering to those who hate the grind, but are doing it anyway (like a job).
---
I wouldnt call it fine but is defintely viable. it just falls behind really hard in tryhard groups unless you exploit heat resets hard.
---
its stronger in raids than fractals for sure.
---
Nah, they're just promo emails. I'm not worried, it's just weird.
---
[removed]
---
I agree.
---
it has heal pulsing, a -40% dmg barrier and further barrier stuff plus can tank dmg for other players additionally.
---
it's just a bit confusing since here in this subreddit even, the opinions seem to highly differ. another thread even writes about berserker scrapper variants, i've not gone into all options of the character to even give any own input to this finally.
---
 i still didn't even try the hammer, since i got ascended pistols and no suiting hammer for my scrapper yet thaha. mine is a semi-offense healer-condi-wall hybrid... and it really works fine. bad against fast moving melee and high oneshot dps since u have to activate the defense always again and in time... but compared to my main warrior, it's quite easy to play and doing its jobs well. against mediocre players it can even 1v1 bring rangers and necros down, struggles against holos, warriors and thiefs... but yeah its mainly a wvw build. 
---
without a good  guild there is no sense in doing raids i think. i don't even understand how they work. some people said you can bring even 50 people to a raid, but the LFG ingame always only writes x/10, which makes it look as if 10 people are the max for raids?

I'm dead lmaooo

I have a hard time understanding this "if you buy it, there is no accomplishment."  So a person works a job, that is probably contributing to society, in exchange for money.  They use that money to support the game/developers, which allows continued development, which again contributes.
---
Sadly, a lot of RP happens in guild-halls, and in /party private chats.
---
Shard warband RPs out in the open, going on patrols twice a week, and there's a few other warbands that RP in public.

But trolls are always a thing, and given GW2's crappy chat system and terrible filtering, it's no surprise so many have retreated.

---
When you purchase the fake currency, or gems in our case, you're buying "the ability to access content" according to the gem store ToS provided by Digital River (The money people for Anet/NCSoft).  
---
Ultimately the real goal is to separate people from their money irrevocably.  While you may be able to get your money back in some cases, you're also pretty well guaranteed to lose and accounts you have with anybody doing business with Digital River at the same time.  
---
I'm not sure where even to start after that...  One would think the system would have adjustments for real life currencies or other such, but it doesn't.  My understanding is that according to NCSoft/Digital River 10 USD == 10 Euro, which it is absolutely not.  This is a pretty massive red flag on the whole system right away as somebody (Euros in this case) are already paying more for the same thing *without any real explanation*.  If there were taxes and/or terifs somehow applied to account for this it might explain it, but I've never heard of that being the case anywhere.  
---
For the system were to be made truely fair it would first need to reflect the differences in value of real life currencies;  Considering the number of lawyers involved in coming up with the current asshattery, that is something that would pose no problem at all to any company such as NCSoft/Digital River.  
---
Remember also that the entire gem store exists in what is essentially a web browser within the game, which means Anet staff are not necessarily the only ones who can touch whatever is in there, and by extension a true-to-IRL currency exchange is perfectly doable by Digital River who handles the money. 
---
But they won't because they know by years of research/experience that people aren't inclined to complain about it if they're not the ones being screwed, and that they have the backing of all the game industry legal dipshits to tweak their ToS, back them in delay-tactic legal proceedings, or some bad 1980s movie plot dystopian government-by-corperation propoganda wars if any nation's government does decide to take a stand on their BS like Belgium whose laws are being obeyed by game companies while those companies in turn rub the Belgian people's noses in it.  (Seriously, this kind of crap from *computer game companies* wtf?)  
---
I can't even keep ranting on this without spirals and spinoffs everywhere, the whole thing is a gigantic mess and solving it is going to require a lot of governments writing treaties in order to force multi-national corperations to color inside the lines.

I always do this little math when I'm buying gems. Do I want mount skin X? Kinda. Do I want to spend $36 on it? Hell no. But sometimes.... yeah.

At least they got their alienware promo where I got a free PoF account and got upgraded with HoT later on.

Ffxiv's really good in quality. But I has a high barrier of entry, with it's prices, sub and the fact that the first 60 levels sucks balls. I don't enjoy ESO and WoW but obviously many do. Gw2 lost me a long time ago.
---
Gw2 is still somewhat popular because as long as you arnt a veteran, the mounts, maps, combat and metas and really fun/unique compared to other games. Being b2p with optional mtx, it's also very attractive to new players and people who refuse to sub.
---
Don't waste your time, 9 out of 10 players in the game will think heal FB + power rene comp is better than dps FB + heal rene comp no matter what you say. And it is strange, don't know how community came to the that false conclusion.
---
I think that's the main reason there.
---
I could argue, for some,  having to excessively farm (effectively a 2nd job) destroys any fantasy illusions.   I want to escape, for a certain amount of time, without feeling like another job.   That's why I left WoW...   If it doesn't feel like that to you, and reinforces the fantasy, then great!      
---
 I'm also not saying "work overtime," only know what your time is worth.   If you know, and still decide to do so, then you've accepted such.  Nothing wrong with that.  I just want people to think about it.    I'm no spring chick myself, and the older I get, the more of my time I wish to spend enjoying life....not working more.  Once I retire, that will be another story :)
---
Wait, this is real? All our Quiznos shut down, they're still open somewhere? Wow.
---
But at least you can buy gems with gold.
---
Everything I have ever bought in GW2 from the gem store I did so with gold.
---
I don't do real money micro-transcactions in any game.
---
but quiznos is.. dead?
---
NYC doesn’t even have any Quiznos...
---
dude you owned him epic style
---
The thing that always bothered me most about "microtransactions" is that they aren't micro. $25 ain't a micro transaction, it's how much a full game costs. It's just a transaction. If you wanna call your shit microtransactions, shit better be priced like 5 cents for a BLK, 50 cents for a character slot, $1 for a set of infinite gathering tools.
---
Closest to me is 1039 miles away... cause apparently there's one in London's periphery. Dunno, at this point I truly think that Anet doesn't know there are players outside NA. Or even outside Seattle.
---
And with all the problems they had in the past with Kung Fu shit and the other promos... why do they keep doing this? What do they get from this partnership? Why, among all the possibilities they have, did they choose to spend their time and resources on a pointless promo with a random US-only sandwich company?
---
Because that is the status quo of these days. Not only here in this subreddit but in a lot of areas and topics :-(
---
I like ffxiv more but you can't compare the work output and quality like that.
---
I think the main reason is that (1) Japan's work culture is fucking nuts, I won't accept less than a 100k a month to work there and (2) anet management does not care for gamers anymore.
---
(2) is incredibly obvious with the templates. Ignoring the price, the implementation is WORSE than arcdps. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE WHEN YOU HAVE A GOOD WORKING EXAMPLE RIGHT THERE? 
---
The truth is Anet's management just doesn't give a fuck anymore. On the other hand, FFXIV's director is known to be rather passionate about the game itself. It's even rumored that Black Mages are better designed than most classes because it's his favourite class.
---
When the overall vision is crap, it's always the management's fault. But of course, the grunts doing the actual work got the axe first, as is custom.
---
Because that would be a reasonable topic - in times where people want to be unreasonable.

I literally wasn't discussing the merits of such a system or otherwise. It was only explaining how it'd work, based on the comment I replied to. I never said "they can't provide this because of how deferred revenue works" - in fact, if anything, I'm saying they could, to correct the person I replied to who thought that the scenario they were saying (money on player accounts) was legally muddy therefore they could never. I haven't said literally anything about how viable it actually is as an option compared to others because that's not what I'm talking about and you're "arguing" with me about something that I was never talking about.

I've been questioning this very thing albeit in-game since the start of HoT. Why are they offering common and masterwork items from vendors when it's an endgame map and you have to be 80 to live most encounters? 
---
It's like they're afraid to sell exotic items as normal along with 20 slot bags 7 years into the game lol.
---
Is there a single mmo that has an actual dollar value attached to store purchases? Pretty sure every one of them does this.
---
Thanks, I was beginning to wonder what the hell I had said if this person is continuing to try and argue with me about it.
---
We can all agree that this templates are to over priced. At this point I feel like they are trying their hardest just to milk as much money from the players before the game dies, the price would have been fine if it was account wide but the prices are for each character which is insane.
---
Sadly the out cry wouldn't be that strong to lower the price

a couple of days ago i was leveling a sylvari necromancer in queensdale and kept getting disconnected. i logged off after the 4th disconnection
---
Just chiming in, I can confirm the two EBs near me in SA (Firle and TTP) have them. :)
---
Thanks guys for all of the tips! I was able to complete it barley lol
---
So why are there so many dicks on here then.
---
My guess is that Boneskinner is an intermediary between Bangar and Jormag, or a construct of that intermediary. 
---
And I don't expect that this story will result in Jormag's death. Jormag wants to survive, since it didn't get polluted like Kralkatorrik did (oops). It's seen Dragons die, and a new one rise, and will want to settle into a new balance to replace the one we upset. And if Braham didn't kill it with an army of prophecy- drunk Norn at his back, I don't expect Bangar to be any more successful.
---
This is correct. I don't care about theoretical maximum speed clears with stat comps, I want to get my gold with whatever pugs show up and be done for the day instead of waiting around for the Ideal Meta Comp to do things maybe 10% faster. Maaaaaaybe 10%.

I wanted to check this out so I went to a quiznos, when I asked them about the promotion they asked me what guild wars even was
---
They partnered with quiznos...IN 2019.

Wow! Grats!
---
Quiznos filed for bankruptcy 5 years ago and is basically dead at this point. This is a fucking marketing failure and deserves to get shit on.
---
GW2's original class, gear/stats/build, weapons and utility skills design was meant to be simplistic so that people would focus on situational awareness and generally *moving in combat* which is probably still the most stand out feature of GW2.  The skills and stats had absolute ceilings so from there you were required to improve yourself to get better at the game.  
---
But their SPvP and esports dreams floundered, and PvE was a godawful mess of mostly stationary fights that still are more about showing off artistry than game mechanics IMO.  When game design turned away from its original SPvP focus and went completely PvE is when weapon/utility skills, gear, builds, counting cooldowns, skill rotations and the other things started to take precedent, then the game became all about stuff that bots are perfectly capable of and even better at than most people.
---
We get it, you're a vegan.
---
&gt; Its completely optional and its only for QoL, like most bought stuff in the store. 
---
This is why we are now paying for red dot sights in games now instead of unlocking them by PLAYING THE GAME! Because people say stuff like this and proceed to buy said red dot sight....
---
Well hell, I would have gone there for dinner.  Wish I'd seen this earlier.

---
Honestly. It is perfectly fine to dislike templates. But if you check the posts when the Bound by Blood episode was released versus now, it's like people went from treating anet like CDPR to EA
---
Quite a people in this sub just loves to downvote new stuffs and it's been that way for years. Not sure how that started and how it is still going on, but eh.
---
run away as in, $25 for that???? thats 2 lunches from the work lunch truck, no way i'd pay that....
---
where as its obfuscated in gems. i say i need this many gems to buy this shiny, paypal it, then see the real world cost and by that time i'm committed to the purchase.
---
i'd run away from the tp if i saw exactly how much i'm paying straight up
---
what's the point in offering thought out criticism when anet just ignores it? people tried that, for years. did it work? nope. i'm here to warn people away from this game because it's not worth getting invested in.
---
The real content was the friendships we made along the way.
---
Closest open Quiznos is 1500 km away.
---
Ah! Another US exclusive mini.
---
There was a time the rest of us dreamed about having complete collections of minis and other things.... nice to equally share the opportunity.
---
It's not even available in my county...
---
Holy cow! I didnt realized it cost $6+ for each build and equipment template. Im scared to see how much real money did i actually spend for others BLTC stuff.... no wonder i had a hard time saving for christmas trip...
---
You are mistaken a bit: it is Quiznos advertising with arena net, they are desperate of getting some of these loyal customers who despite all the fuckups still hang around and support the company.
---
&gt; Instead of paying a youtuber or streamer to promo their game to their target audience,
---
They do that a lot though, but they don't pay them. Plenty of youtubers and streamers get attention from ArenaNet through the partner program.
---
It is Quiznos advertising not arena net’s, they are desperate of getting these loyal customers who despite all the flows still support the company.
---
Doesn't exist in my country.
---
Welp. F you Anet
---
Yeah but the ff sub has waaaay better art and a second sub
---
&gt; I mean, aren't the two comps going to be pretty close? 
---
No they're not.
---
Power fb does about double the dmg of power ren and if you play condi fb the difference is gonna be even higher in pugs.
---
That's normal. Happens to often.
---
Of course, what this is ignoring is that even if templates are fine *for you*, that certainly doesn't mean they're fine *for everyone*, including those who were most vocal about wanting them. So when people are suggesting improvements to them, including largely things that would also benefit you even if you don't mind the current state of then, you have to wonder what you're trying to do by coming in and saying there's nothing wrong with them.
---
Everything gets downvoted into oblivion first, I saw posts that later reached hot with like a 30% upvote ratio at first because some people just downvote anything that's "toxic &amp; elitist".

Greece has euro and is nowhere close in wealth to Germoney. Why am I being lectured by a diletante again?

If FFXIV content sucks then GW2 must be lower than dirt.
---
This is a horrible analogy. Your opinions can fall where they may, I have no problem with preference. But compared to WoW, GW2 has little to no evolution. I love the game but it still has ancient mechanics and Anet seems to care more about shoveling out cosmetics and micro transactions than evolving the game play and QoL. Just look at our options for PVP which have remained near stagnant regardless of the games criminally underrated combat. Whether or not you feel this is a good thing (I certainly do not agree with all the choices) WoW has evolved to further meet current standards of the gaming industry. GW2 still feels ancient.
---
I wish they out More effort on hellfire and radiant they are so outdated and ugly
---
What clock
---
Actually I think episode 1 will be more focused on Norn (namely Brahams guild from season 3) and dealing with Jormags domain maybe even setting up a base in the EOTN. I thing Bangar will be a part of the patch but this will likely be a norn focused patch.
---
Since when did they add the pearl weapons to drop tables? I just got a knight's pearl conch from ascent to madness, but I always thought they were crafting exclusive.  Kind of a dumb random question, but it surprised me.

I guess. King Fu Tea shop is 6600 km from me, and the sandwich thingy only 1500 km.

This will get lost but there is one for twitch streamers they've been dishing out.

From my perspective it's a big step up in comparison to the Kung Fu Tea action.
---
  
---
The closest Kung Fu Tea shop to where I live is 6600 km away, and Quiznos only 1500 km!
---
Kinda like a devilish sneaky manipulative dragon.
---
I really wish we got a daily achievement point catchup system. Doing dailies just for AP is the least interesting content in the world, but missing out on AP rewards just because you don't do 3 inconvenient and arbitrary task is a bit eh, especially from a game that's all about playing your own way.
---
Tbf I'm not really sure that Reddit offers enough tools to compensate a situation where people abuse the down-vote button. And also not really sure it's the role of moderators to remove/mask posts of "white knights" because it's kinda hard to justify removing those kind of posts "because you don't like them or think those people are foolish" cuz that's kinda hard to describe properly in a rule where it neither be abused too much, nor disliked by many people, nor based on a lot of subjective/personal interpretation.
---
This does not feel like a problem that moderation can influence too much on given the tools they have access to and them (already?) being in a "doomed if they do, doomed if they don't" kind of situation.
---
Thanks!

There's Quiznos in UK too! And in Arabic Saudi! (1500 and 3000 km from my town)

&gt;learn to play by yourself
---
If you're exclusively playing solo that's mighty fine. However my daily fractal/raid clear being a shitfest because you want to "learn to play by yourself following no advice at all" and are hampering the group isn't
---
&gt;repeating a rotation you're told to be the best
---
Half the thread is telling you it's not efficient anyways.
---
&gt;Imagine you are playing crosswords, and then everyone is telling you to go to a website to find the solution and using it would make you gain time and make your game session efficient. Sure it will. Except it will also remove all the fun and the first reason do to the crossword in the first place
---
Websites people tell you to go to give you the method, not the solution. They also include guides on how best to alter the rotations/builds/gear they give you, aswell as encounter specific information and tactics, aka what people expect you to do.
---
Gw2 is a team game. What you explained is fone if you're by yourself, but in instances, at least 4 people depend on your performance to succeed. Noone asks you to pull godlike dps with perfect placement, they simply ask you do your best and that includes being able to do what you're queueing as. If you queue as DPS and you're doing less damage than the supports because of your inability to prioritize skills properly, you're not doing your part. If you're queuong as support but don't give boons because you'd rather play your very own creative build with so much variance, you' re screwing over the players who expect those boons to be present.
---
Btw you're always free to put on your own lfg with your own strategy, and have people going around in suboptimal builds, that's fine. But don't be so entitled that you expect 9 people to adapt to your way of playing just because you couldn't be assed to spend 1 hour training your class.
---
there is literally no place in the game where scrapper is good, well, healing scrapper is pretty alright in wvw I think or at least it was when I still played, but no, there are 0 reasons to play scrapper
---
Maybe we just have different interpretations of what "a solid damage skill" is? In my opinion being slightly better than an auto-attack doesn't cut it, especially when focus 4's alternative for that slot is a 9x2.97 coef. Of course that doesn't come with the defensive benefits of shield 4, but it's a *huge* difference in the damage department and definitely makes me scoff at shield 4's damage.   
---
That was really the only point I was trying to make, but shield discourse:
---
I'm not coming at this from a raid perspective (for whatever it's worth, I tend to dislike the "it's not good in the one type of content I play so therefore it sux" mentality too), I only mentioned the cooldown to consider the cleave potential maybe helping the "solid" damage statement, but that's a reach.   
---
I *want* to like shield for assorted stuff, and I keep one in my inventory for when it feels useful, but that's pretty rare for me. Mixed damage+support firebrand for pve zerging is one of those niches, but that's for the support parts (as the damage is still negligible). PvP is another, because the defensive utility of it is so much more valuable there than in PvE.
---
On the 5 skill note, it is one of the clumsiest options for CC in the guardian repertoire (and guardians have so many CC options) unless you *want* knockback for regular mobs, which, if so, is fair. It can definitely do that.   
---
Defensively speaking, I'd take a wall of reflection+focus most of the times shield might be useful in pve. That's me, though. If the way it functions works well for you, I can totally agree to disagree, but to me shield is at best just okay. Not *bad*, just outshone in a lot of ways.
---
Nice. Pretty sure this is my next chest. Just his gotta head back to Grothmar and get going again I suppose. Good luck on your quest for the back piece!
---
But Anet has quiznos surely thats better, right......... right.
---
Well it is true, paying box price for skin is bad. Do not remember where, but they actually stated that there is actually no difference how expensive it can be. People who buy them, buy anyway. Witch is true to some extent, since if you can dispose several hundred USD on entertainment a month you do not really care.
---
And yet every time it will create "movement" on reddit, forum and probably even generate some extra searches of this elusive businesses. I believe that those kinds of promotions involve a super low amounts of money, less that's what they would have to pay for Google/Facebook/twitch advertisements.
---
Dailies have 15k AP cap. That's basically 4 years and 6 weeks of dailies.
---
If you are wondering.. yes they partnered with [THIS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZrks-BPeLQ) same Quiznos ... pretty sure the company went to shit after this nightmare..
---
lmao, 8k, maybe 8.5.

Release as well.  I feel ya.

Currently i am at nearly 9.5k hours and 2618 days :)
---
Hell I'm well past my cap on dailies but I still do them.  You get 2g for going and looking at a vista, harvesting some wood or something and killing 3 people in a pvp daily room.  Well worth the 10-15min it takes, imo.  People have done harder stuff for less.
---
Grats!
---
Yes 13958 dailies and 1042 monthlys. So im capped. Even though it says i get 10 everytime i do dailies still XD
---
i have a bit more, but still, we just don’t do achievements. That’s basically it. We get them accidentally when we do stuff we are interested in. At least this is how it works for me (I did several collections tho)
---
Im missing alot of raid and some pvp. Once i went for the PvP backpiece the ap came flying so i guess theyre mostly grindy. Fractals are great because they can be done lower level. 26k is alot for not having stepped into those things! Best of luck :)
---
i just dont go out of my way to do achievements unless they give me some kind of reward that i want.
---
I think they actually look pretty good - just not quite enough for the effort they require
---
If you define good as speed clears, yeah.
---
If you/your group don't care about that, every class is good for the end game. Player skill will always outperform 'better' classes.
---
I don't think people down voting that easily are people you would like to exchenge dialog and arguments with.
---
The problems listed above are problems of scale and location. Comments about how ANET SUX or ANET ROX that are flooding irrelevant posts turn every single post into the same repetitive, meaningless argument, and allow the most vitriolic voices the most exposure. Someone who is pissed (either at ANet or their detractors) is going to post more, and less usefully, than someone who is content.
---
Moderators should constrain discussion about particular problems (in this case, the build templates) to a single thread. Their position about megathreads is exactly wrong. Or, if they are dead-set on ensuring the front page is full of nothing but spam about a dozen small variations of the same issue, they should at a minimum be much more harsh in their removal of (as the rules state) "Low-effort / low-value posts). It's right there in the rules on the side-bar.
---
Times of drama and disquiet are exactly when moderation needs to be strictest -- not to silence either view, but rather to ensure that expressions of those views do not push the rest of the conversation about the game out of the subreddit. Put up a megathread, crack down on posts and comments which aren't on-topic to their parent posts, and have the balls to do what's best for the community. At present they're either tacitly on the side of the worst elements of the subreddit, or asleep at the wheel.
---
Yet another proof, that ArenaNet does not believe Europe exists.
---
Did you try once every 15 min or something?
---
Yes it is, you're wrong.
---
He explicitly is stating that exact scenario.
---
Grats, well done. With the next release (or Wintersday, if not that) I will probably reach my long-time final goal of 39k and the radiant back. It certainly gets trickier once you cap dailies!
---
For many of us it isn't a toxicity thing. I'm personally happy with downvoting posts that don't add any discussion or are objectively incorrect.
---
In the case of this subthread, it really doesn't add anything so the downvoting is being used correctly to moderate. That isn't always the case of course but in an ideal world it is how it should work.
---
A wider issue is that the community has, largely, become polarised. You can see this earlier in the thread with two individuals respectively blaming toxic and salty players that don't play anymore (a definite issue) and the other blaming "white knights", a pretty shitty term but something that is also a problem. Both of those posts have a high number of upvotes yet the post pointing out that moderation is at fault has comparatively little.
---
Moderation here is definitely an issue. I know people like to dump on the official forums, even though it absolutely allows reasoned critical input, but at least that isn't a flood of meme. Or posters being borderline racist and using terms like "monkeys". Or a place for streamers to rile up drama. Or a showcase for guilds claiming world records using UI bugs and exploits. This subreddit becomes ever more unusable and that wouldn't be the case with quite selective and lax moderation.
---
True. I never considered BL chests as something any sane person would buy without realizing that it is gambling. And yes, a form of gambling without a proper age check and  addiction prevention. The Mount Adoption Licenses for me were much more dangerous as it contained something many players would want (a mount skin) and could not get in any other way. ArenaNet added later a very expensive option to buy a mount skin but that option is so expensive that it should be considered theft. 
---
I would rather see the removal of items that you buy for real money but don't know what is in it (like BL chests), but some items are more dangerous than others. Mount Adoption Licenses were a biog step in the wrong direction. And the moment I decided not to spend any money on gems any more.
---
&gt;Check back in 2 years when the value of gold is half and 10k then will be worth what 5k is now.
---
Yes, that is exactly what he said.
---
5k now becomes 10k after 2 years. That's exactly what the discussion is about.
---
Emails from ANet usually reach me in English, so yes, I get foreign emails from them too.
---
Which specialization Soulbeast drops to bring Spotter?
---
Why are you skipping over the fact that we're getting a new ultimate in 1 week? This is months of progression content for the midcore static - almost certainly at least 7-14 days of progression for groups alarm clocking it daily seeing as how it's supposed to follow UCoB levels of difficulty.
---
24 man bosses are not designed to be challenging, they're supposed to be open-world level because they're designed to be accessible to the entire playerbase, regardless of skill level. Hades is a decent fight, not the best because of all the cutscenes and I personally don't care for the glamours, but many people will farm it many times just for the mount.
---
MSQ is well known to be one of the most compelling reasons that casuals stay in FFXIV. I don't care for the story in any game I play, but if you just compare the story to fighting the elder dragons in GW2, there's a reason that most people would agree that FFXIV has a deeper story.
---
I'm slowing down on playing the game because I'm really bored of the savage tier and I really don't care for much in MMOs other than raiding, but to say that the vast majority of the content is shit with that amount of firmness is pretty crazy. I mean, I don't enjoy the content that they put out, but there's a reason that so many people are doing it man. I don't craft, I don't farm open world, I don't enjoy doing story, I don't do side quests for completion, and I don't run old content other than UCoB and UwU, and yet I know that the content out there is great just because of the sheer number of people that enjoy it.
---
How many hours played?
---
I'm at 12,700 with 2700 hours to date. ( since pre-release )

But that's not all! If you're interested in trying out the game before purchase, you can get a demo copy at Blockbuster! Upgrade the demo to the full version for in-game rewards!

idk if you realise but that "vegan burger meat" is made from heavily processed grain on an industrial level too. That industrial processing requires plenty of energy and a long supply chain to bring it to a high end consumer like you, which isnt really climate friendly either. More than half of the nutrients in the grains are also wasted in the process, so it doesnt really combat world hunger too.
---
Even you manage to feed the whole world population with porridge at some point, it will just result in those who couldnt feed themselves or their children before to produce more children, leading to a faster rise in world population in areas that cant sustain themselves. And we are back at square one, once we run out of farmland for all that grain for all the extra mouth to feed.
---
Nobody likes someone, especially their kids, die of hunger but in the end, its survival of the fittest and natural selection, which will determine that fate of humanity.
---
No soy bean burger will change that.

[I clarified the intention of my post here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/dqdlxv/with_the_recent_chak_infusion_post_lets_not/f63ebk8/) Too many people seemed to be misunderstanding my point. TL;DR, I was responding to the same post that the person in that link was responding to, *through* him.
---
No people are speculating this because the Icebrood Saga trailer has an underwater part with the line "the prison in which all races of Tyria suffer".
---
Marksman since it gives significant, but less dps than Beastmastery. Still, if your team is a bunch of power classes it can be worth it.

Take an accounting course or start your company and learn it the hard way :)

Thanks for quick response. Do you also know which Grandmaster trait is used?
---
Oh, it's just 5 min only? I'm not from the NA, but EU. It means I have to walk all the way to the zone where the quest starts, and the real question is - can I survive those 5 minutes? because I heard PoF content is pretty hard, and I just dinged 80.
---
And yes - I already have your shorter season recap on my bookmark waiting for me when the personal story is over :-)
---
I think you need to replay the prologue story. Bangar is not going to even try to kill Jormag.
---
Viscous Quarry, since it's the greatest DPS increase and doesn't require you to relearn a rotation.
---
No, it's an incredibly weird thing to do.
---
Obviously a joke you meathead
---
Ah, makes sense. And the free crit chance from it must be nice.
---
&gt;No, it's very clear that he did understand that, and is saying that having a gold cap on transactions is a problem that gets worse over time because of inflation.
---
That doesn't really apply to the point the person before him was making though. He was saying that items that are 10K now should cost less than that. Now if there *is* inflation in the future that would make existing items more expensive, then *again* forces need to come in play to further reduce the cost of things. It should not be allowed to run rampant. All raising the cap does is condone the runaway inflation, give it room to exist. 
---
&gt;You then directly stated that you'll stand by that and got the before/after switched around.
---
Again, I was stating that I was standing by the point bnha was making, not the one Pwadigy was making.
---
i think he was referring to the outrage about his own opinion, when he said there is no controversy, cause he thinks its unjustified
---
Raid tanking is a bit quirky as the mechanics aren't consistent between raids, but chronomancer (mesmer spec) and various guardian specs tend to be popular.
---
I looked them up and I'm pretty sure there are like 3 in Atlanta. 2 hr drive for me though, so not happening.

Same, I used to love it. At 29.8k and its just hard to keep pursuing these +1,3 achievements anymore.
---
Mornings are a problem for me because I'm working and free only around 9PM. I can do early morning like 8:00AM. But based on what dak393 says, It should be pretty possible to do on my own without bothering you? :-)
---
I don’t agree that because he’s had a longer time than other people he’s got a more valid opinion than anyone else.
---
I’ve been playing guild wars for 13 years and really not happy with the build templates and I’m sure there’s a lot of people that think the same.
---
I respect that he feels he doesn’t need to jump on a bandwagon but insulting other people’s intelligence or opinions is not cool.
---
It's not *too* hard. I found the boss battle a bit tricky but did it.
---
Oh, It's starts from Lion's arch? I was sure it's starts on any of the new zones. I'm already hanging in Lion's Arch. Well, in that case, I'm already spec mostly exotics (Halloween Exotics), so I might be able to do it. If it's just 5 minutes, I think I can do it. IF not - I'll bother gulbasaur :-)
---
Tell me what are you going off of? I've been around from the start and I've seen the game get better and things worked on. This game has become huge and to say it offers nothing to new players is just dumb and an unfounded. It's worth getting invested in, just not to you. Instead of offering real critique you just spout some nonsense because you feel jaded, slided, I don't know what. 
---
And lets talk about Anet listening to players. Right off the bat, players and Reddit we're talking about how they would pay for build templates cuz they wanted them so badly. That's number one. The UI/UX is a whole other discussion.
---
 Let's talk about all of season 1 and why we don't have it. It was because of the players. Am I the only one who remembers polls asking people exactly what they wanted in game at the start of GW2? How the players voted to have all data to be dumped and it to be one time events for living world. All for the feeling of prestige. I was the one there nobody else was.
---
Their biggest fault was listening to players way too much at the start and not listening to the business aspect as well. Now they're stuck in a rut and stuck with an unapologetic fan base. Who like a bad EX even when they don't play the game s*** talk it instead of wishing it well. Hoping to drag it into the same dispear as themselves. To me you sound like a bunch of whiney children. 
---
This is no White Knight as I give real critique them as well. But it's actual critique. It's not some Fanboy obsessed whiny bull s***. 
---
With all the faults Guild Wars 2 has it is still hands-down the best MMORPG on the market overall. And that's a matter of opinion. What's not a matter of opinion is that it definitely ranks in the current top 10 MMORPGs. It has nothing to offer? Bullshit. 
---
Stop acting like you're obsessed bad ex.
---
Man the cajones it takes to go against the mob like this my respect for Woodenpotatoes grows again after years of decline. He is right though with everything he says. But this community will go after him because he doesn't share their views.
---
Gonna give it a try then and will only poke you if I can't make it :-)
---
By the way, can I reply this section later on? to check what I missed? or like personal story it can only be done once?
---
i have no idea why people are even mad about it.

we had nothing before  now we at least have something.

hell i don't even need it much since i have like 1 character for 1 build already
---
the p2w thing is totally bs btw ....  i'm plat 2 spvp player.
---
Orrrrr an active community manager from Anet. That is also a big demand.
---
**TL'DW**: "They're not great"
---
And he thinks it's very very clever they monetized them. And honestly I agree on that. It sucks for the players, the game's systems, arcDPS development, everything really **except** the penny counters. From a company perspective it's damn clever, they know their addicted whales will gobble it up like crazy.
---
I considered Mesmer, but I hate the clones and it's a core mechanic of the class. But for the last sentence :) It helps !
---
I considered Mesmer, but I hate the clones and it's a core mechanic of the class. Still, thanks for the reply.
---
That’s just something pve players say to make themselves feel special.
---
No amount of AP makes you special or even good at the game.
---
Cheesy JP and running around pve like a BA doesn’t make you bad. 
---
Want to show off something of value... show (or better yet come and earn) champ gizmo or something actually rare in game.
---
You guys cheesy all that AP without barely playing the real game (gw is designed as pvX and most of the AP hunters never even play competitive so they are NOT close to top players in the game, skills wise.. NOT close at all)
---
AP is just a measure of how long you play... that’s basically it and they give you free AP just for logging in.
---
So maybe you believe the skins are worth something because anet artificially locked them BUT to the rest of us (millions who play the game) only and I do mean ONLY the back piece is even rare enough to talk about.
---
Its 2019 guys.. just because you can buy a legendary doesn’t make you legendary (and a lot of those AP especially from raids, fractals, dungeons... people PAY for)
---
That alone has reduced the value of the item since nobody earn it.. they paid for runs so the item overall is worth “less” then items you can’t pay for like... “several sets of legendary WvW armor” (lol that takes actual dedication and years of playing... not years of festival 50ap freebies. Years of actual playing!)
---
Why are you still here? Every time I see you here you write the same bullshit over and over again. If its a dead game why do you bothering this subreddit with you bullshit? Just walk away and let the game properly die already...
---
You seem to think it's ANet advertising at Quiznos.
---
Why isn't it the opposite, that sounds far more likely. Like how Mountain Dew does CoD ads, Quiznos does GW2 ads.
---
To be honest loving games tend to be more p2w or have progression locked behind rng.
---
Gw2 is none of the above.
---
The issue right now is that there is a huge separation between players in what they play. the largest part of the playerbase is mostly engaging in open world and casual content, which for a company with limited resources they tend to focus on the broader audience. Leaving veteran players that are into competitive content high and dry (WvW, PvP or endgame PvE).
---
I mostly back Anet on their decision making, it's not easy to keep a.f2p game going without harsh monetization, and yet they have kept away from p2w, some of those decisions I was against (mount skins in rng lootboxes or 2k packs for a set of skins for the same mount for example).
---
There is also a lack of in-game rewards, even tho I disagree that mount skins should be farmable in-game (in practice you can farm gold and convert to gems) but having one or two locked behind a collection would not hurt I would like to see more in-game rewards to look for, even if recolors or retextures of existing assets like infusions or armor/weapon skins (kind of what they did this Halloween with the Royal flame weapon set).
---
What I do not understand is why they are ignoring the fact that there is such a split between players instead of promoting that players engage in all the content types. to be honest I think that would solve the greatest issue in the game.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply. It helps ! :) I don't like pets, so if I choose to play Necromancer, I would play it without them.
---
I have friends who are leaving the game after disappointment again and again that causes arenanet with their actions. acts or lack thereof. And that should worry arenanet. They lost the community competitive in PvP and wvw, hardcore players are leaving the game. And disappointment after disappointment is causing veteran players to leave too. 
---
And who is to blame for all this is arenanet. There is no excuse for failing players over and over again.
---
if only i had said what you accuse me of saying. i'm not bother going to bother arguing with you because you clearly have an axe to grind and probably are incapable of viewing this game objectively, you lose your credibility with your ridiculous statement about gw2 being the best MMORPG on the market, i've never seen a man so wrong believe he was so right.
---
What you say is missing is the reason why I play gw2. I like having multiple characters and getting them easy. Also what you are saying that it is hard to find a class at a decent level is just in the beginning of games, soon there will be many bards to choose from
---
Lady Kasmeer.
---
He didn't really explain his opinion.
---
He's reinstated that his opinion is personal and doesn't have to conform with others ( which is fine ) but also that his opinion is better than most people because he spent lots of time in the game  ( which is not fine ).
---
I kinda thought that he was a little overheaded on some stuff, but not this much. Yikes.
---
I'd respect AP more if you couldn't get 15,000 from dailies.
---
Yep, renting that theatre was expensive.
---
That's just something WvW players say to make themselves feel special
---
Guild wars 1 &amp; 2 were never about leveling, but about personal skill. Which, for me, is one of the main reasons I like both a lot.
---
Why not partner with McDonalds, Starbucks or KFC for a change?
---
I'm italian and I assure you that I've never seen spaghetti that tangled.
---
Knowing Quiznos it'd be at a worse markup than the reset of the industry. &gt;.&gt;
---
Yeah...no.
---
“Tripple monetization sucks and there are many flaws but there is no controversy“
---
...what?
---
Wait I want one too
---
Thanks for the pdf warning!
---
Who?
---
6.5/10 not enough comeback mechanics.
---
But there was also Whispers in the Dark which wasn't exactly lovecraftian - about Tybalt and stuff. 
---
So either you are right, or we will get to meet some old Order of Whispers friends :)
---
These are all valid points, and even tough I still make more at work per hour than in the game, the reality is that most of us are not able to afford *additional expenses* on top of your regular ones. Farming the game like a job is not fun either, so the whole point of this is you shouldn't treat it like a job, but if you farm you shoudl enjoy it, it's a game. (that's why I still do dungeons and other suboptimal money/hour content in the game because I *enjoy* it).
---
Ohhh. I see. I didn't know about the prologue. So I probably need someone to help me with it. How does it work exactly? he "set" the mission to be the first chapter, then invite me into group and I go into the instance and that's it?
---
I like them, I have a character with each.
---
[Here are a few pictures](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/6bg7be/after_all_those_years_i_finally_got_enough_ap_for/). I had a more recent post with the backpacks but I can't find it.
---
let's say you started this game back in 2012 right when it launched. 7 years of monthly payments of ~$12.50 comes out to $1,050.  Add in both expacs and buying the game at launch for another ~$140. 
---
To buy all the build templates on every class, when they inevitably expand it to the datamined 10 slots, will cost $690.  All you'd have to do is spend another $500 on this game and you'll have met your dreaded monthly subscription fee.
---
dak393 mentioned that I will be forced to do the prologue when have tons of spoilers. So I might need your help setting the first mission for me. Once I'm inside the instance, I probably will be ok alone I hope. So yea, I'll poke when your online :-)
---
Both, as people say, take firebrand for fractals and druid for raids. Firebrand is a good tank or off-healer in raids but it does not replace a druid.
---
Yeah must be really hard doing all those jumping puzzles oh and don’t forget your fashion war collections!
---
What was I thinking... 
---
Props to the real gw2 pro’s!, right?
---
&gt; This game has become huge and to say it offers nothing to new players is just dumb and an unfounded.
---
go back and find where i said it :) the great thing is we can all read back to find out. this is why there is no point arguing with you, you can't even get facts in this thread straight, much less outside of it. goodbye.
---
&gt; Ive played for 1000's of hours,
---
&gt; I have zero legendaries because it takes so much time.
---
???
---
People enjoy different things man, just because you sank a lot of time in something different doesn't make you any better than anyone else
---
Oh, you're one of THOSE people...
---
After playing mesmer a while, you actually sort of tune them out as just another spell effect. 
---
I probably pay more attention to the clone counter for shatters and mirage ambushes than what the clones are actually doing.
---
You never what could be called "an acid shit" ? Well I did and it actually burns.
---
Honestly, this is just typical for most americans, no need to even be maga. They just think too much about their country. In ages of their youth, it maybe was like that, but it is not so shiny anymore...such is hard to change mind about.
---
The [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Exposed_(effect)\\) seems to suggest it does.
---
&gt;Increases incoming direct and condition damage
---
GZ for subbing to a dead game
---
I agree, which is all the more reason to do it. A detective who can only solve 30% of murders is not great, but it's better than zero. And if they can keep clearing out bad guys and keep pushing that upwards, someday it might get pretty close to 100%.
---
Solutions don't need to be a binary all or none. It's okay to chip away at a problem slowly over years.
---
i disagree when he says they're "not that important"
---
on their own? sure, not hugely important, but when you look at them alongside the ascended cooking and legendary runes/sigils updates? it just keeps looking worse and worse tbh
---
legendary runes/sigils: overpriced, annoying to use
---
ascended cooking: boring/unimaginative implementation along with another shitty cashgrab (the garden is stupidly limiting unless you buy more slots)
---
build templates: three layers of monetization, stupidly limited even at max unlocks, other various issues such as them  being loadouts and not templates
---
idk these are all updates that should have been praised as great additions to the game (remember when we used to get feature packs and they were the best fucking updates ever) but instead the reception has been widely lukewarm or negative
---
I mostly play off-peak as well and I unlocked it without too much hassle. A little ad-hoc squad of about about 5 people should be able to do pretty much all you need.  
---
Peak WvW is something you either love or hate. Grab a few boosters (check the wiki) and you can pretty much roll through the whole thing just by paying attention to chat and grouping up now and again with other roamers.
---
&gt; leveling and creating progression for your character and new character is gone on GW2.
---
Well, it was NEVER a thing on gw2, you could level a char to lvl 80 at launch in a couple of days without even knowing the game at the time.
---
I’d probably have about 5k since pre release where most of it was put in between 2012 and 2014, after that I dialed down and pretty much by now stopped altogether :(
---
Why does it even matter what he thinks? Anet won't change anything.
---
He invalidates most opinions by his own fan club because those people are not as conntected to the game as he is but then calls templates not a big deal although it was among the most requested features before release of the game. And in the next sentence he takes a dump on redditors. I what his own subreddit things about that.
---
Why so salty tho?
---
There is a need for an alternative system that lets you reach the cap without doing menial and mundane tasks every day. We had a system like that, called the monthly achievements.
---
As it stands now, if you don't enjoy doing dailies, you are either locked out of 15k AP, or you have to play the game in a way you don't want to. Both are bad for the game and the player.
---
Poping here because summoned too :p
---
I'm usually available anywhere between 18:00 CET to 23:00-00:00 CET if you want  /u/Tall-Guy  and the other person is not available.
---
That's kinda the idea, PoF has been relatively good with the way they implement big checkpoints and instances so that you can replay more easily replay just the part you want to get some missed achievements instead of having to redo bigger chunk of a story steps every time.
---
Your 250 page long "paper" is a collection of slides that are clearly meant to go with a series of presentations by different people. You should probably link that as well, assuming it's publicly available.
---
Your second link says literally nothing on the scientific literacy of people who defend MTX and is instead all about how those people are perceived by others. Which, while interesting, isn't really relevant. Maybe you linked the wrong thing?
---
Your last link talks about, primarily, gaming/media addiction. I.E. people who spend too much time in games and online. I see them talking very briefly about the idea of variable ratio being more addictive than the alternatives (fixed time, variable time, fixed ratio) which is already well established with regards to gambling. (I'm sure you remember the famous pigeon study)
---
It only briefly touches on the abstraction of digital currency (the current conversation) and, since I'm unfamiliar with the bibliography method it uses I was unable to find what works they were referencing. Seems to be you would have been better off linking directly to those themselves, given that the rest of the report is largely irrelevant and it does no primary research.
---
&gt; The literal definition of fair price is a price agreed upon by both buyer and seller under no compulsion. 
---
In the real world, perhaps (although there are abstract exceptions to that too), but in a game world, you not only have to consider "fairness" between both participants, but also "fairness" between each player and the game's design. Is the game designed to provide an experience that each would find fair? If the game is designed to make it harder for Player A to get what he wants out of the exchange, and easier for Player B (such as by allowing market trading to be far more profitable than the alternatives), then that is not presenting a fair scenario to Player A. 
---
I think where you get hung up is you keep trying to apply real world economics, rote, into a game world where those roles don't exactly apply. You don't account for the differences.
---
Ok, thanks for the info.  A little weird, but doesn't really impact the game that much.
---
Nah bro, he was serious lmao.
---
healers are not meta in fractals but if you need them cuz of reasons, renegade healer is the best choice
---
Practise. Next time you will get it in 20..
---
What kind of device are you on that it doesn't show titles in Youtube embeds?
---
Yeah, but that's close to a gold.
---
Even though, it's not "in the middle of a new Living Season". It's at the beginning.
---
I have honestly never seen such a load of bullshit stuck in one comment before, I'm impressed.  
---
SPvP failed because the dev focus was completely misplaced and wasted in dumb stuff like Stronghold mode instead of highly requested automated tournaments and GvG.  
---
PvE is mostly dead because raid cadence is far too slow, Arenanet is capable of making good and fun fights, albeit way too easy. Skill rotations are actually fairly complex in this game compared to the other MMOs in the market - I have no idea what bots have to do with it, but suit yourself I guess.
---
This is not entirely correct. The reason that power soulbeast performs better is because it burst extremely hard so if performs super well on short fights (where power is BiS) making it superior to power holo as well which bursts lower
---
&gt; legendary runes/sigils: overpriced, inconvenient/annoying to use
---
With the recent gear customization window I would say that now Legendary Runes are pretty nice to use, especially if you don't need any weird stat mix on the armor: you can click on your helmet, select the new stat, the new rune check  2 boxes and it's applied on the rest of the armor.
---
Also they kinda are the only ones on the list that are not more or less related to something from the gem store (gem --&gt; gold exits but by that metric kinda any new thing could be counted as linked to the gem store).
---
The price is surely debatable but it's at least not really  annoying (can't say about leg sigils though, haven't gotten any).
---
My wage is around 4.5 dollars per hour. I still spend some on gems. Fuck it.
---
What is it with this scrapper fairytale? I've never seen one running around Tyria. Do they even exist?
---
not really fucking himself over since they mentioned that they don't grind silverwastes 24/7.
---
gold accumulates overtime really quickly actually when you do content that you like, even open world what with all the mats and stuff
---
You are confusing the value of currency with the value of rare items.
---
Rare items being made more common and therefore becoming cheaper isn't deflation. The value of the currency does not change.
---
That's one of the things I like most about GW2.  I don't want to spend weeks or months leveling up and only getting bits and pieces of my character unlocked only to spend even more time gearing it out.  I still like the progression but I don't want it to take longer than it should.
---
he had the same stance on the game before he accepted donations for his mastery streams.
---
Here is the part of the argument I don’t get. 
---
Why is having all build templates unlocked the gold standard of what people expect for free?  I keep seeing this held up as the proof but it is a luxury item and people are upset they aren’t able to buy them all.
---
Congrats
---
the fuck even is quiznous
---
After so much work you can't even buy yourself 1x build gear templates tab. :(
---
hmmm weird - just fixed it - thanks for letting me know
---
Yeah, that's fine. I tend to play more in the morning if I play, but I'm happy to hop on for half an hour to open up the mission and stomp though it with you. I can't do Thursday or Friday evenings this week. Anyway, send me a message and we can sort something out if you want to.
---
But I do enjoy doing achievements, I just don't enjoy going out of my way to do menial tasks every day for five years. *Every day*. The issue is entirely gone if you remove the arbitrary 24-hour period you have to do the task within. The 1-month timeline back in the day was perfect for me. The dailies are a chore, and I've got enough chores in my home to ever consider spending time on them in a game.
---
At the very *least* Kung Fu Tea is a growing boba chain in the US of A. Definitely not big enough to be partnering with a company with the size &amp; scope of ANet, mind you. But they aren’t an actively floundering chain like Quiznos that runs effectively a pyramid scheme system to bleed money from franchisees.
---
Such batshit decision making I swear.
---
Now show Empower!
---
The nearest open restaurant is 600 km away from me (a 6-hour train hourney), and I'm pretty sure they don't have any vegan sandwich options 😅
---
Lol do u even know what p2w means??
---
everything is on wiki, i would start on googling "damage formula gw2 wiki"
---
No she doesnt? Like, at all?
---
Is there even a chubby female model? Afaik they go from unrealistically thin to stick figure thin....
---
Some people are just generous and don't really mind dropping feast for others.  As far as I know, a feast feeds unlimited amount of people so they can get nourishment from that one gold.  It is totally up to you whether you want to plop it down :D
---
GW2Efficiency has [user stats](https://gw2efficiency.com/account/player-statistics), and 56% is playing on EU servers, 44% on US :)
---
(And as the other commenter said US also includes South America, Australia and Oceania.)
---
Video evidence please? Thats like a super bold claim...
---
There's Quiznos in the UK and Arabic Saudi too :) according to Google maps anyway
---
Don't give them ideas! Good thing HoT has already been released, otherwise they could totally make some cauliflower promotion for a sylvari expansion.
---
Why, he's entitled to his own opinion.
---
It was a giveaway for a watch.  
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/win-a-guild-wars-2-mtm-special-ops-hypertec-watch/
---
Yeah... 3 of them, with another opening soon. I've never heard of them until today.
---
I love the fantasy realm you live in... You speak like if LFG isnt a thing that exist and everyone can check...
---
And as if noone here ran fractals for years...
---
"Yeah we're clearly capable of beating this fight very soon here, but I can waste a ton more time finding another group that can do it in two pulls instead of four, so I'm just gonna do that, instead."
---
&gt; and they will do so at place that is mostly out of buisiness
---
Sound pretty fitting for GW2
---
Weeden Potatoes amirite?
---
Well, there's one problem: "*Only available at Quiznos located in the United States and Canada.*"
---
Source at the bottom of [https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/news/get-an-icebrood-saga-heros-bundle-at-quiznos/](https://www.guildwars2.com/en-gb/news/get-an-icebrood-saga-heros-bundle-at-quiznos/)
---
I think F2P brings in many players, many of whom later turn into paying customers. (Eg. I would have never tried this game if it wasn't F2P, since then I bought both expansions.)
---
Didn't even realize Quiznos were still around before this promo. I thought they went bankrupt years ago. There used to be like 4 in the town I live in but they all went under a long time ago.
---
I think the point stands at ArenaNet are, and always have been unable to market themselves appropriately. 
---
The EU seldom gets to partake in any of the other *promotions* that ArenaNet have put into place. Even if "Quiznoz" exists in the UK, it's only open to the US/Canada or w/e. 
---
Perhaps someone should point them towards Twitch, I hear that place is pretty popular with the gamers nowadays. Can't say for certain though.
---
Do you know how many times I've wasted 15 minutes waiting for stealth-skipping in dungeons to finally go well just to avoid 3 minutes of fighting trash? There's something about GW2 players in particular where, if there's even a *hypothetical* way to do something faster, no matter how unlikely to succeed, it *must be done*. It's so bizarre.
---
Well, i registered in the app using fake UK phone number just to try to glitch it like Kung Fu Tea.
---
App looks like a total garbage made by 14 years old kid, but i think it has solid security regarding the codes. I will try to mess around it on android emu with access to root.
---
Besides that, i would rather just buy the outfit on gemstore than getting that sandwich. I live in minor town, so if Quiznos was somewhere in closest major town, i would still overpay for it, since taking a ride back and forth and buying that sandwich would cost me almost the same as 1k gems
---
Judging by one very old leak, It name also based on Lovecraftian lore.
---
That leak was right about Balthazar, so, I guess he is also right about Shav- well I wont spoil you the second half.
---
Time will tell.
---
They should do a promo with KOHLER. It’s the perfect brand for a tag team who likes shit and smells like Ass.
---
So they don't have a salary? Are they paid per items they have developed for the gem store? Regardless they are getting paid for their work
---
you again? ...
---
Lord Faren IS Jormag.
---
This basically.
---
Though he does resort to derogatory and snarky remarks a bit too easily.
---
Yeah WP stop having opinions and share ours. I'm sorry but a lot NOT ALL of the people complaining are whiners. He said that some people had actual issues and grievances but that doesn't mean he agrees with them. I think he did the right thing. Of course he does that same when people disagree with him he on many occasions when that happens points out how hypocritical he is being when he complains about something but that doesn't mean he isn't right to attack people who do the same thing.
---
In about 3 and a half hours. 4pm UK time.
---
I live on a tiny island called Bahrain which is a very close drive to Saudi, might try to go find this Quiznos 😂
---
Why? How does it affect you?
---
I totally understand where he is coming from, as he seems to be focused on the hyper criers that are complaining about the fact they even cost money. 
---
But he thinks the build template system is not something important for the game. Yeah .. it only had the potential to be the most important QoL feature since **EVER.** Not sure how he think the system is not that important for us to be so mad about it.
---
&gt; The dailies are a chore
---
Most people I know treat dailies more like something that will automatically complete itself while they're playing. For example, if you're into PvP at all it usually takes just one match to get the whole daily done.
---
What you're describing applies more to the daily system before the cap, when people were forced to complete all 13 tasks to get the maximum amount of AP each day. Now THAT was menial drudgery, but applying the same term to what we have now? No way
---
This reminds me: wasn’t there a VW bug they gave away? Who is won that?
---
Anet can't use Twitch. What if someone posted The Forbidden Frog? It would be the end of the world as we know it.
---
I pretty much agree with him. A] Not that big an issue. B] No objection to monetizing it. (Price is another issue.)
---
Well done!
---
As someone who started in 2015, according to GW2Efficiency I could only go up to 33,610 AP atm 😅
---
What? No. There are normal weight options.
---
&gt; Do you really expect me to pay for visa, take a flight to US, find that Quiznos, buy a sandwich, throw it to trash can and claim my code?
---
If you are really desperate to have it then, yeah.
---
The thing is, those marketing deals will always have some restriction on the location because A) Try to find some company that wants to make a deal with you and B) are available all over the world.
---
The larger those companies are the more money you have to pay because, most of the time, those big companies don't really profit from players of a game...
---
I still don't get why they don't do any promotions in EU at all, isn't the game most popular in Germany , put some promo in Kaufland or Lidl and you have covered the continent. All these dumb US promotions do nothing, they gave a freaking car for the roller beetle thing and and in the end no one gave a shit about it. Most of these dumb things just piss off the Europe people.
---
Someone else Diagnosed it pretty well on twitter :   
---
The marketing team is really, really detached from the rest of the world.   
---
They don't know how to look for BIG franchises to attach themselves to .   
---
So they use whats' local and easily available *To them ,* While simultaneously forgetting that, Oh I dunno.   
---
It's really bad publicity to partner with Dying companies.
---
Or even worldwide McDonalds
---
No, everything isn't. That's why there are useful tools and external websites, like gw2efficiency and the likes. Also, you have to know what you're looking for to actually look for it. Searching for "dps simulation", for instance, does not come anywhere near the stuff that was suggested to me for my calculations. 
---
Forgive me for offending you. I honestly hope you never have to ask for help on any subject, and that in the case that you actually do, you never come across someone as helpful and understanding as you are.
---
https://youtu.be/g1eBCP27EHI?t=569
---
kiter doesnt have to be a druid tho
---
Anet should really hire u as a marketing lead with such constructive critique. 
---
/sarcasm
---
WP has 40 alts on one account. So it isn't surprising about his view of Templates. He did unwittingly come out in support for buying more character lots.
---
Highest AP in the game is Eil with 40,979, anyone who hasn’t played since day one, will never catch this person as a lot of the AP is no longer available to get.
---
widepeepoHappy
---
Quiznos? More like QuizOhNoThisGameIsUnderBadManagement
---
Where's my Blockbuster exclusive ingame Outfit?
---
Anet promotions are one of the 'murican things on the internet.
---
I dont disagree but anet and this sub have never been concerned with supporting gw2 content creators. The streaming and YouTube content for gw2 has for the most part died out.
---
You can pay influencers but isnt it a bit... late for that?
---
Its hilarious to see people defend a business model based on new players casually showing up every few months , yet most people that arent invested dont know the game exists.
---
We don't even have gem codes in our stores.
---
&gt; things are just made to kill you one hit just cause you couldn't avoid an attack
---
Other MMOs' raiding would like a word. The number of times I've gotten OHKO in XIV, for example, rivals similar mechanics in GW2. And depending on the fight/creature/boss, the conveyance is occasionally about even...   
---
The difference between the two is XIV relies on either playing Floor Is Lava or taking the auto-hit and relying on healers to recover, but most of the GW2 experience is rooted in (skill-based) active mitigation and managing defensive resources.
---
WP having his own opinion was never an issue or real point of contention; like I said in my previous comment on the other thread, it is perfectly fine for WP to dismiss every issue or concern that anyone here has solely on the basis that they don't apply to him. That's fine.

What *isn't* fine, however, is dismissing these issues on the basis of "I've played the game longer so I know better." Opinions are not sacrosanct, contrary to popular belief: the reasoning behind opinions can be examined and criticised. The first reasoning presented is understandable, if selfish. The second is pure, patronising, nonsense.
---
I used to think WP was a cool dude who could see issues from different perspectives before presenting his own, usually rational, opinion, but I can see this is no longer the case.
---
Damn nice, what build did you use?
---
When I realized that Big B was indeed involved, I start looking for old comments, but it was very old ago. Could'nt find it. Take it with grain of salt.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You realize that bigger MTX companies hire PhDs in psychology, neuroscience, behavior, etc. to actively wage war against the human nature of their own consumers, right? 
---
I'll be copying this in the future because I haven't read it that well put before.
---
Too bad. And I can't seem to find a fiting connection between 'shav-' and any mythos entities. Am I searching in the wrong corner?
---
Companies only have certain amount of cross-promotion campaigns they can run per year. And each company will look for a partner that will grant them the most new customers in their target group.
---
And Anet simply isnt an attractive partner for global behemoths like McDonalds or Starbucks, who rather partner up with Disney/Marvel/Star Wars as those are companies/franchises that also have a huge global fan base similar to their customer base.
---
&gt;Not strictly speaking, exactly, but it's not inflation either.
---
The person who brought up inflation was talking about the value of the currency, which is the correct way to discuss inflation or deflation, and was raising a valid point.
---
The proposed solution is to increase availability of the rarest items such that their price decreases. But since currency continues to inflate overall, those items and any other items which are worth close to the cap will continue increasing in price until they hit the cap again. Because that is what inflation does. The currency is less valuable, so without another market force changing the price of a good, the price will rise.
---
And then, by this proposed solution, you make them more common again, as well as any other items that are worth 5k or more today and which end up at the 10k mark in a couple of years.
---
And then a couple years later anything which costs 2.5k today.
---
And then everything which costs 1k.
---
A solution which only affects the expensive items and doesn't prevent the inflation of the CURRENCY will fail because 10k gold becomes less and less valuable over time, making the limit more and more restrictive.
---
    They can, trust me.
---
Do you have numbers and proofs so we can trust you?
---
Yeah what happened to the car thingy? Any winner after all?
---
Shav- mentioned just once in one of books. Ah screw it, here is the page - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu\_Mythos\_deities#Great\_Old\_Ones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cthulhu_Mythos_deities#Great_Old_Ones)  
---
Its on the end of list.
---
Honest question is there another way to get that mini or is this it for now?
---
...yes, but you are far better off for it.
---
It should have just been 3 templates per mode. It feels like they just retooled an existing system instead of making a new one and it seems really lazy on their part.
---
Looks like you have a mule now.
---
As a law student: usually legislators are just so slow that the world around them evolves past the laws. In this case it's more a "we need to avoid the law to cause huge headches" (as to refund actual money) that also has the bonus of protecting lootbox markets and such.
---
Scrapper is good in wvw as both healing and dps. It's also still good in pvp(obviously if you're trying your hardest and want to be as effective as possible then tools or prot holo are strictly better but that doesn't mean scrapper isn't good or viable if you just want to have some fun but still be effective)just troll side nodes with it all game and take some 1v1's until you have to bail.
---
I noticed her belly bounce while doing that swirl . I dont know why ppl dislike my comment so much :/.
---
minor? 20% is minor? lmao
---
I recently returned to the game and have been achievement hunting like crazy, in about 3 weeks of work climbed from 3K to almost 6K just running around like a madman doing stuff left and right... These kinds of numbers from others tells me I just need to work harder to complete achievements!
---
FAAAA-BUU-LOUS
---
there is very hard to make dps simulation because some abilities have unknown cast time. And if u want to measure impact of those things i would just assume some basic dps lets say 30k as combination of power\*critchance\*critpower and then would take away some stats probably
---
I love my toxic green flames that you get with the green infusion;)
---
they have ranger and guard, both use full zerk gear in their meta fractal builds which are easiest to come by and to join groups. so i would advise that over doing the healbrand meme
---
They can't do it anything against it. It doesn't interact with the game at all. It's made into an overlay for ease of use but it could be an independent application if needed. It just gives you the string code of the build you need.
---
It's not just that it cuts the anet's profits, it just put's in evidence that trying to charge people for the capacity of the account build storage is a very bad idea because you could just use a simple notepad with the build links on it.
---
It was there before in other mmo's, it is gone in gw2. You're agreeing with this man even if you don't realise it.
---
They went throw a massive downsizing during the recession. There used to be several near me too, and they all vanished around that time. There's only two Quiznos stores left in my state, nowhere near me.
---
the dps loss to bring spotter isn't that minor
---
it also requires you to adjust your gear with the new crit chance
---
most people gear their fotm chars without considering spotter so it will probably be wasted on them anyway
---
such a bad idea
---
we're already in the middle? damn, that was fast.
---
The Anti-Defamation League identifies symbols used by hate groups, but people do not understand how that information has to be used, so whenever a hate group wants to keep a symbol for themselves, all they have to do is use it, the ADL will identify that, and fake 'woke' fools will act as if that was like the bible and go apeshit crazy whenever someone uses the symbol again, context be damned. 
---
4chan got the OK hand sign added as a hate symbol as a joke to prove this point. 
---
https://www.adl.org/education/references/hate-symbols/okay-hand-gesture
---
Even when the ADL clearly explains not to take the symbol too seriously and not to jump to conclusions, those who are unable to reason without dogma addling their mind and consider the context will overreact to such symbols.  
---
Pepe the Frog was originally just about feeling solace in mundane daily activities that feel good, like taking a piss or hugging a friend.
---
Selfish dps weaver. Yeah true, I also wish conjures would be ammo based. Or buff d/wh fa.
---
they're worth exactly what they pay for, so maybe NCsoft can shell out a little bit and really advertise something. of course that would require Anet to make some actual changes or expansions instead of just tiny unexciting incremental changes.
---
Yeah some female norns are fat.
---
Everyone but you is ignorant.
---
It's not like the Pug meta started with heal Ren and then swapped to HB because it's more effective...
---
OH, WAIT, THATS EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED...
---
I find any sort of partnership deal like this, where the two parties have nothing to do with each other's industries, to just be off putting.
---
It's like a tacit admission that you can't stand on your own merits.
---
Well i'm on my phone and can't read the numbers but if the support does the same DPS as the DPS like it seems someone there is terrible
---
Meanwhile I'm sitting at 5k for months because I got tired of AP and collections so stopped bothering with them long ago.
---
Marketing went to NCSOFT after the layoffs, if i'm not wrong, funnily enough it might be even worse now.  
---
One would think that the Korean Overlords would try at least Korean memes.
---
that's not what i said but lemme rephrase
---
"people should not adjust to whatever SOME(maybe most since you're a nitpicky cuck) believe to be true"
---
nice appeal to majority lol
---
bad? having 250kp and needing a healer in fractals like you do is bad
---
i lfg almost daily with 100kp requirements and accept pretty much everyone lower too! yes, even the "i got 3kp but know mechs"
---
and yes, i don't play with healers of any kind..if the lfg is up since forever i might reluctantly take one of those leecher healbrands but i digress
---
it's really sad many people are like you, insane kp requirements but still insanely bad at such a casual videogame
---
yeah ofc but that one of Nsoft have taken over the CEO position from the old CEO.
---
I find it hilarious that Quiznos located 1km from anet HQ is permanently closed.
---
&gt;It's really bad publicity to partner with dying companies
---
Anet is dropping every hint they can, but we're still blinded by irrational hope that our game is headed in a good direction.
---
Well first of all.  There isn't any franchise that's large enough to encompass everyone and will take an Anet promotion seriously.  Someone is always going to be pissed off they can't get the money 
---
Second.  I would not be at all surprised if this was more to benifit the franchise than it is Anet.  It costs Anet nothing to hand this shit out and if they pick up a few new players cool.  Companies like Kung-fu tea and Quiznos. They might actually be paying Anet for the privlage.  People didn't even know they existed.  Now you do, and GW2 players that are able to, will go buy/use thier products for the promotion.
---
Didn't know Quiznos still existed?  Me either.  Did this prompt alot of people to see if one was still in thier town?  Fuck yeah it did.  Promotion goal met.
---
Sorry, Anet doesn't give a shit that you want this mini.
---
&gt; privlage
---
Check your privilege.

I respect him but I don’t agree with him at all. Templates are a slap in the face to all players alike.
---
I'm talking about condition Weaver as it completely outclasses condition Holosmith. Power is its own beast. Condition Weaver doesn't use any conjures
---
never said all runs go perfectly..they don't with healbrands either cuz slower phases means more damage taken
---
what is so hard to understand? i post my own lfg, ask for "power firebrand" or "dps firebrand" or whatever
---
if people want babysitters they can simply not join
---
Zowie!
---
&gt; Twitch drops  
---
Why would I want to associate gw2 with spam?
---
&gt; I'm always amazed by how many people don't want this.
---
Why are you? MMORPG is a genre that is historically based on gear advantage trumping skill. It's the same as if you would suggest chess players to upgrade their bishops to queens after they have played 5000 hours of chess. Obviously people who would be in favor of such ideas would not be playing chess in the first place.
---
Step 1 - find a friend in the US that can go there and get one for you.
---
Step 2 - Friend goes to... Oh, wait, the nearest Quiznos for everyone is closed or 100+ miles away looool
---
The comments are validation that everyone on reddit, thinks out rage is justified even if it makes no sense.   Your all basically boomers.
---
What's most amazing is when I read a reply from someone I know to someone I know XD . Good Pun.
---
The more casual players are/will not use templates that much. And the more casual players vastly outnumber the veterans who do use templates. So, nope, it's not as big of a feature as people pretend it is.
---
That said, and given that it is kind of a niche audience, they should be cheaper and unlimited (and I think WP agrees with this). To put it into math, it's more efficient to buy a character slot than to buy the same number of equipment/build templates, and this is ignoring all the other benefits of buying a character slot. And that's not right.
---
He is right when he says "it's a flawed system and it's not perfect, but it's not reason to be so upset about it". Specially when you can still use third party alternatives.
---
extra spirit coverage, mobility, ranged healing and might stacking, extra condi cleanse.  honest question, what is a better pick?
---
Quiznos isn't a dying company, it's a formerly deceased company that has been brought back from the dead.
---
if anyone plays whatever and anything goes what's even the point of having a discussion about it?
---
healrev is superior to healbrand which was the main argument of this comment chain..it devolved from there because the person i'm replying to is clueless about everything
---
stop the whiteknighting pls
---
Definitely appreciate the bi-weekly cadence of catch-up, instead of just going back to the standard scedule.
---
Because the ADL is monitoring 4chan so they can put memes on the hate symbol list.  People do use the upside down okay asa hate symbol.  I know you don't think so, but that's the whole point.
---
So healbrand isn't actually "more effective".  It is a better carry and allows for a lot more fuck ups which are likely to occur in pugs.  If you want consistent clears in pugs that is what you take, but it isn't better in general, it is more consistent for less organized groups.
---
^ I hear that place is pretty popular with the gamers nowadays. Can't say for certain though^
---
You dont know event when you are using twitch?, and what should they do at twitch? adds?  Google chrome has about 310 million active users or 71% of all web browsers users, ublock origins adblock has more than 10 million active users , 6710000 use AdGuard AdBlocker, adblock plus having passed 100 million active users back in May 2016 (The Adblock Plus for Chrome™ ad blocker has been downloaded over 500 million times and is one of the most popular)

Don't know, but don't we have more global players? I heard Aldi is getting bigger in the States and in hasn't the reputation it had 30 years ago in Germany.

Hey some people are always down for some ass play, not judging.
---
Well associating it with spam is still better than associating it with a graveyard or not knowing that it exists in the first place.
---
https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/facebook/000/018/467/1355331549061.jpg
---
Yeah, the first mount license was when I stopped buying gems and I haven't bought any mount skins since.
---
At this point, I don't think Anet is worth much to NCSoft either...
---
And then there's the part where he called you an idiot for being angry about it. So there's that.
---
The option to gat a promo code maybe? As a European I feel punched in the face....again....
---
This.
---
And, if the fireBrand is healing, the alacrigade will have the "flexible legend, mallyx for boon removal, jalis for extra stab, shiro for damage.
---
Don't get me wrong, Healgade is super good and is valid option for pugs.
---
If you are going for straight up DPS, yes, it's more meta to take the quickbrand+Healgade comp. But even better is to take no healer at all.
---
Back to topic, build both, if you need to prioritize one i would say healbrand, most fractal pugs will want one, and youll also find a slot as a secondary healer in raids.
---
&gt;slap in the face to all players
---
No they're not. They don't affect 80%+ of the playerbase.
---
They do use it, yes.
---
But there's people who will flip out when someone use it normally or as a joke.
---
The ADL themselves clearly tell people not to flip out before seeing the context in their own site. Yet there's people out there who will flip out regardless of context. 
---
[Context is very, very important](https://youtu.be/q9y-IT_ibIA)
---
But the promotion doesn't cover those.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
okey, then its like the The Boy Who Cried Wolf fable for me
---
Gulbasaur is mainly up in the morning. So this might work better for me. If you can help me, that would be great. I'll send the details on private message :-)
---
Well, I was talking about pre-cata wow as a whole. It worked fine, providing both low lvl vertical progression and a good stream of high lvl endgame content. So it can be combined very well, but gw2 didn't even try, really.
---
&gt;if anyone plays whatever and anything goes what's even the point of having a discussion about it?
---
Because OP asked what's meta and that's why we're here?
---
My point is, you don't have to shit on other comps to make your point that heal ren is "superior". Not everyone is a Perfect Player like you are and insulting them for playing differently does not make you more credible. In fact, you never even gave a reason WHY heal ren is better.
---
Oh cool. That's true for every Living World chapters/HoT (Except Season 1 ofcourse)?
---
Also - I'm assuming the Personal Story can't be jumped back?
---
My runs are definitely super smooth. They are never perfect (i always make tons of mistakes) but we never wipe, because all mistakes are healed up :)
---
Slower phases mean nothing because people don't die. Because i heal and "babysit" as you say (i don't think i'm a babysitter because i don't look down on other players like you seem to do).
---
Damage taken means nothing since i pretty much block/heal everything and people only (occasionally) die because they stand inside skorvalds hitbox and... And thats it to be honest.
---
Keep posting your lfg i'll keep posting mine, i insta fill and finish before most 1337 pr0 playurs even start running...
---
Sure. BacklsBachus can also perhaps do it, I'll add both and poke the first one I see online when I do :-)
---
Thank you!
---
Same thing happens with ranger pets if you mount in mid-air.
---
Well, it exist still... recent update oct 26 2019... wtf.. I wonder if my first email still works there o_o.
---
Maybe ^^
---
it does... it blew my mind.
---
That would be a good way to text whether the check is in the map or in the station. 
---
Crafting stops if you move away from a station, and vendors close when you move away from a merchant, so there has to be a check for "talking with x" or "using x".
---
Thicc.
---
A large part of the problem with that system though was the completely bizarre choices - tons of minor traits were locked behind stuff like killing the risen high wizard in arah, so people had to play for most of the levelling experience with significantly reduced build diversity. 
---
Add to that the really poor variety with the activities that locked traits which meant the process felt identical with every class.
---
I think the system had a lot of potential, but they implemented it really poorly and abandoned it very quickly.
---
For people out of the loop, this was Quizno's commercial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZrks-BPeLQ
---
Ahh well the more you know...but im assuming the guy made a joke about it not existing anymore xD
---
They can run an ad for any of their lineage mobile games and generate way more money probably
---
Ok, I'm not judging the campaign or being facetious here, but I'm legit trying to find a Quisnos near me so I can grab lunch and get the free loot.
---
There are 3 within a 5min drive... each one is permanently closed. The closest Quiznos is 77 miles away.
---
hahahahahaha
---
Except he really didn't.
---
Except Gw2 does not have anywhere close to 250 developers on it.
---
&gt; but they implemented it really poorly and abandoned it very quickly.
---
Which can be said about a lot of Anets releases.
---
Exactly. After I realized how easy you can complete daily doing PvP, I started doing it everyday again.
---
yes stop being at phone and go at pc so you can check the video evidence of fb doing twice the dps than rene.
---
benchmarks are irrelevant for fractals because fractals are using bursts not rotations
---
Because if the focus on the content and gameplay, they quickly demonstrate they don't have much to say there.
---
I mean, with pugs I want smooth runs so the healbrand is def the best for that scenario, but it isn't meta.
---
[This seems like a good idea.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz-PtEJEaqY)
---
&gt; Kung fu Tea Thing, never heard of it here, it is US only. Quiznos? Uh, same.
---
I've never heard of Kung fu Tea..and I live in the NYC metro area..  
---
As far as Quiznos, yeah there used to be a lot of them here in the US..not so much anymore, pretty much all of their stores were shut down like 7 years ago. Though apparently Quiznos is a world wide chain. http://www.quiznos.ie/
---
There is almost 5k subways in EU
---
But a big part of Twitch use it a lot and they are not racist, it's just a funny looking character.
---
The point I was trying to make is focusing and bringing more attention to the downvotes will just get you more downvotes from people.... even if they agree with you. No one likes the people obsessed with karma.
---
&gt;The fact that both my comments above are -20+ proves that this place is toxic and downvote happy really.
---
And many of those can just be(probably are) people trolling you because its sounds like you care to much about having positive karma on everything.
---
I've kind of understood anet's(NCsoft's?) aversion to partnering with Steam, but at this point in GW2's life I think it would be a great boon. In this sub, we constantly get topics from new players stating how they love this game and it scratches their MMO itch and how they're surprised they haven't heard about the game before, and that has a lot to do with the poor marketing. I'm sure there would be lots of people who would try out GW2 if they saw it was free on the largest digital distribution platform for games. 
---
 If I had any authority at anet, I would be trying to form some sort of promotion with valve. I know they've done cross game promotions in the past with TF2, but dota2 shares a lot of the same fantasy elements. Give players who link their accounts some dota2 skins and vice versa. Maybe add a few cross-game achievement unlocks(IE, you account bind a Bifrost in GW2, you get a Bifrost skin in dota2. Extreme example but you know what I mean)
---
Also, valve has created an entire virtual economy out of thin air and I'm surprised more companies don't tap into that. Make a gemstore item that'll transform a non-accountbound GW2 item into something that shows up in your steam inventory that can be traded/sold. Anet gets their premium, valve gets theirs, and the player gets some value for a decently-priced item they don't need/want outside of GW2. Not to mention the idea of being able to buy and trade gem packs within the steam UI. 
---
I'm sure the taxes steam takes on every sale would be insignificant compared to the benefits it brings, which at the very least would be visibility for the game which it need desperately.
---
That made me giggle I'm not gonna lie.
---
with the exception of the gen1 greatswords no. however a certain bug in templates allows you to unbind them again. not that you should use that, but i find it worth mentioning nonetheless.
---
You're saying if I made my already soulbound Sunrise into an Eternity I could unlock the skin and sell it afterwards?
---
xD but still, I remember ICQ was stalker/childpredator hunting grounds on the 90's.
---
&gt; I've tried really hard to forget Kung Fu Tea.
---
Unlike all the people who got their accounts permabanned for taking part in it.
---
You will unlock Twilight skin in addition to Sunrise and will be able to sell it (Eternity) afterwards. You will not unlock Eternity by itself.
---
By Crafting Eternity, you get both GS skins, but not Eternity. You can then sell Eternity.
---
Unfortunately not, the only way to unlock a skin is to account or character bind an item/unlock with a guaranteed black lion reward. Those dont unlock Legendaries, either, though.
---
ANET: Community hates us for monetizing and screwing up build templates. 
---
Also ANET: Lets make a shitty marketing deal so that the community forgets about build templates and starts hating us for something else that is completely irrelevant. 
---
Community management 101.
---
Everything makes him uninstall. Just 3 days ago he uninstalled cause build templates.
---
Sure, whatever you say :)
---
So, let me recap... 
---
OP ask if he should roll DRUID or HEALBRAND. Clearly he pugs and is not very experienced.
---
Your reply is "power quickbrand or heal rene". It's funny not only those are not even in the table, but would also make it very hard on OP to actually get a team...
---
Man gotta love this community, when talking down others and recommending what top 10% players in static groups run to newbies is cool.
---
I see, tyvm both.
---
Meta fractal healer is:
---
Healbrand for pugs
---
Nothing for statics / tryhard pugs.

Already I am not going to argue with you.
---
yeah my recommendation is to play neither of what he asked and roll slb or dgh/qfb instead, btw being a newbie doesnt mean you should start with with shit builds, you get a good build and as a newbie learn to play it well. see i dont want new people to get stuck on healbrand laziness and forever be a whiny leecher like you are.
---
I actually started playing BDO again after a few months of break because I saw some posts about the recent update. It works!
---
WP is the perfect representation of the casual player sucking up to their corporate overlords. Perfectly conditioned into mindlessly spending money. This is the ideal customer, even defending this bullshit.
---
Disco Stu sends his regards.
---
Well it may not be a popular opinion but fully decking out nine characters in triple-dipping loadouts/templates is still quite cheap if gaming is your only expensive hobby, if GW2 is your only paid game and it is your only GW2-related 2019 purchase. Quite cheap for a hobby for a year I mean.
---
Lots of 'if' of course, but it seems still relevant if you are 'that serious' about the game and don't care about fashion wars.
---
Dude same the quiznos here went out of business like 2 years ago, man I loved eating there too
---
&gt;certain bug in templates
---
$\_$
---
Well, the one I know I was there a year and a half ago, won't be surprised. (didn't went inside but went to the sushi bar, =L)
---
Ademas conociendo como se pasan cosas el gobierno alla, no me sorprenderia un loop legal como el asunto de las maquiladoras durante la Presidencia de Fox.
---
Meanwhile, a quick Google maps search tells me all 4 Quiznos in Bellevue (where Anet is) are permanently closed. As are all 4 in my town. 
---
This is the death rattle of this game.

They also made this  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60TCwX11PVw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=60TCwX11PVw) 
---
But come on this one is just pure gold.
---
"It's not important to me" is different from "It's not important to me, so it should not be important to anyone."
---
Dismissing objective criticism based on subjective opinions has always been a problem in this community, this is just another one of those cases. I think some people just don't have a gag reflex and can deepthroat this anet cock easily.
---
Maybe they finally listened to players' complaints that gemstore stuff is always better than in-game rewards :)
---
They're not going to name the dragon after a property someone else invented. That's inviting trouble.
---
80mi to the closest one from me. None in Columbus, Cleveland, or Cincinnati Ohio
---
jfc
---
I would rather they build on the system they already created rather than create a new system to support for a year and then drop.
---
I don't think that's the case either tbh.
---
What the fuck...
---
The "shit build" is considered good by dt. Stop being a condescendent asshole.
---
Also i'm most definitely not a leech, kindly stfu.
---
Just a comment on GW1's weapon-specific skills-
---
Warrior has the most skills with weapon requirements (since they have axe, sword, and hammer mastery), but other GW1 professions get quite a few weapon-specific skills. There are bow, dagger, spear, and scythe skills, too. Ranger actually rivals Warrior with 54 bow skills. (Warrior has 63 weapon skills across Axe, Sword, and Hammer.) Assassin, Paragon, and Dervish don't have nearly as many (37, 23, and 17, respectively).
---
Spells, however, aren't limited to specific weapons like they are in GW2. All Elementalist spells, for example, can be cast with a staff, or a wand, or even a sword, or daggers, or a scythe. (It may not be a good idea, though.)
---
And if you really wanted to, you could put 4 different weapon skills on a single skill bar and swap between all 4 weapons in combat. (This would be on a character with Warrior and either Ranger, Assassin, Paragon, or Dervish as their two professions.)
---
Being able to preview them would be nice but Anet will likely never fix any of the chairs.
---
&gt;I live in like one the big cities, it's on the top 5 biggest cities in the US. I checked the Quiznos site and we only have like 4 Quiznos in the whole metro area.
---
Thats actually a great many Quiznos for 1 city.
---
K they are a slap to the face of 20% of all players, the 20% who actually wanted templates. Better?
---
Kinda like some of Anet’s choices
---
That barely counts as armor. It barely counts as clothing.
---
Omg how can it be so ugly
---
Burst and utility.  It's also slightly more difficult to consistently manage kit swaps.  The presence of break bars, fast breaks, and the exposed debuff cab slingshot burst classes well beyond their benchmark dps in short windows.
---
this outfit is extra extra but bright side it does make your characters ass look really good so ya know...
---
I'm sorry ANet, I'd love to buy your chairs and outfits, but I'm too poor to afford them after buying those build template upgrades, which didn't even help considering the implementation itself is borked.
---
Now, I live in a cardboard box on the side of the street. Send help ANet. Perhaps a VW Beetle so I can go on a road trip instead.
---
I actually wanted this because I wanted something more revealing, which I don't typically dress my characters in. But in typical ANet fashion, they've got the dye channels all fucked up. This is probably the worst one I've seen in a while, too. The paint on the legs is in the same channel as the metallic necklace and earrings. And the buckles on the leggings don't have their own channel but the tiny little crystals in the middle of the chest do, and even some of the brightest dyes hardly change how they look.  
---
It's a small and insignificant thing, but this is literally my biggest pet peeve with this game. How fucking hard is it not to tie two completely different textures ( eg. metal + cloth, body paint + jewelry etc. ) to the same dye channel? There are only a handful that actually have it right, like the Arctic Explorer outfit or the Jungle Explorer outfit. The vast majority of the others are such a bitch to dye in any satisfying way, you're pretty well guaranteed to end up with severe clashing.  
---
I realize this is a silly rant but holy lord, ANet. We've got plenty of wonderful weapon skins. How about putting some of that effort in to armors and outfits?  
---
Do not buy unless you're only interested in how revealing it is. Otherwise, you're going to have a hell of a time making it look good. Wish I could refund mine &lt;-&lt;
---
No idea why you are getting downvoted for that. Tbh its simply a bad game design, that there are permanently unobtainable AP which are being considered in the leaderboard. Honestly there isnt much change in the top ranks, beside the first rush on getting achievements, when there is a new living story episode.
---
If someone, who started today, could still get to rank 1, with enough time and dedication, that would be a huge incentive for new players to actually collect achievements, which simply is a big part of the endgame.
---
Inb4 im just salty, coz i missed some historical AP. Coz I am :(
---
They used Shoggoth already. Surely they add "r" so its a Shoggroth, but its not a big problem.
---
[deleted]
---
They list it as good on the website, i couldnt care less what you say happens in the discord you use to look for dick to suck.
---
Also: you have a static, you don't pug, stop speaking about stuff you do not know shit about.
---
Last (but not least) i'll respectfully decline your offer. I know you love to eat shit, but most of us don't; we rather eat your girlfriend...
---
Just kidding man! We know you don't have one, but don't be sad, there are a lot of other incels like you :)
---
i mean $5 purchase? sure! i would buy that. $10? maybe, i'd have to weigh that up. $25 for that skin????? run awayyyyy!
---
So in a weird way, this was a successful tie-in for Quiznos, since literally everyone forgot they were even a thing since those sock monkey commercials from forever ago.
---
Whenever I see weird partnerships like this one, I always wonder about the behind the scenes deals.  Maybe anet’s actually *getting* advertising revenue from Quizno’s from this—and not the other way around.
---
is that a swamp monster? it looks like the person that made it knows Mossman
---
Its not late. As I said, the Lazy Peon vid was very recent, happened in 2018 and it had a great impact on this reddit and on the game.
---
Besides, this game has a very short leveling curve so anyone can be in endgame content in under a day.
---
&gt; EDIT: you are worse

ArenaNet, the only company that can screw up chairs, one of the oldest inventions ever.
---
For NA at least, it's WAAAAAY harder finding no healer runs or pQB + heal ren.
---
pQB + pRen &gt; cQB + pRen &gt; pQB + hRen &gt; cQB + hRen &gt; hQB + pRen
---
Let's be honest, if you pug (at least on NA), player skill level even on 200-250kp groups is GARBAGE, and most people don't carry bundles, don't know how to stack, don't know how to dps and actually need a healbrand to carry through everything, it's pretty fucking obvious no healer or healren+pQB is a bit faster but it's not worth if it takes forever to fill a party and if you wipe once all the time you saved clearing faster is lost.
---
I'd run no healer if i could but i rather fill a party in 2 mins and finish CM/T4 in 45-50min than wait &gt;30min (and risk not filling/people leaving) just to clear 5 min faster.
---
Even if you do get the perfect comp you can still end up getting clueless players, seen plenty pQB's doing 5k dps/20k burst and struggling to upkeep 50% quickness so yeah, it's a player issue but most people aren't even at above average skill level.
---
I mean, I was just chalking it up to difference in how we perceive the word meta.  I just felt like we both had different opinions so there wasn't a point in arguing.  Not sure why you're being an ass?  It doesn't bother me at all tbh.  You clearly think that meta can be used in different contexts like you did above.  I just think it is applicable in a specific sense.  Like, meta healer for pugs doesn't make it a meta class.  It is the best healer for pugs likely, that doesn't make it meta.  Anyways, I am actually done talking to you because you clearly don't want to have an intelligent argument, you just say things and when people disagree you are an ass to them.
---
This looks so muppety I can't help but love it immensely

---
Nice.
---
Drat. No worries. Maybe someone else will come along. Thanks for other races though :)
---
Magnificent. Magnificent, Uutz.
---
Oh you are arguing semantics!!!
---
META = 0 HEALS, with different class composition according to boss (and you don't even bring a FB at all except for preboon, as shown in several speed kills in this very reddit)
---
Of course theres firebrigade 0 heal with weavers and occasionally other class like dh or slb, but thats kind of outdated and there isnt a single meta comp for all bosses.
---
PUG composition = alacren, hb, bs, 2x dps
---
So it boils down to " I came up with this 100% on my own therefore its good and fun" I still find that confusing because this is a mmo so unless there is a way to play the game with out interacting in anyway with other players its impossible to come with things 100% on your own.
---
So thats how you get the pinnacle skins....
---
Or his literal words just after the timestamp in this thread.
---
Why would you do that to yourself
---
nobody wants to partnership with a dead game so thats why they partner with kung fu panda and fake subway.
---
If I recall correctly, the instance of the map you land on is affected by your party, home world and guild.
---
They already added the downed skill [Signet of Agony](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Agony) as part of the HoT mastery track. 
---
I think it's a great idea but an elite skill needs to be much *much* harder to get. Make it a medium term goal similar to crafting a legendary weapon, and force players to participate in all game modes including raids.
---
Well... yes. Thanks, I guess.
---
The gameplay is fine imo, the battle system is very good for an MMO and the exploration and jumping puzzles are top notch.
---
The game just lacks things to use the battle system and the exploration, since open world is braindead and anything that's not the living story has low priority for ANet... Ultimately, "buy our game for the jumping puzzles" just doesn't cut it.
---
What is  Quiznos?
---
I'm an equal opportunity employer, let me edit my post then :)
---
Where it says Dick it should read cunt.
---
Where it says girlfriend it should read boyfriend.
---
There you go!!! Colors for everyone.
---
Also... It's funny you want me to eat shit and i'm the nasty one... Although now that i think about it its probably not nasty for you since you enjoy it so much.
---
PS: do tell if you are bi, i can fix it too!
---
Could this also be one of those cases where the order of ingredients is necessary? I've had mf recipes that didn't work until I changed the slots the ingredients were in.

I feel that this is two separate cool outfits which got, for some peculiar reason, fused together to look fugly instead.

\*Puts on tinfoil hat\* What if this is just the marketing counting on people to go "wtf" to other people thus spreading the word. I mean all the marketing really has to do is spread the word and somehow get to people to talk about the product  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
This promo is the essence of their understanding the player base.  You couldn't find a more fitting description of how short sighted and oblivious management is at Anet.  The irony is palpable!
---
We need to stop trying to do their jobs for them.  We've given advice over the years and have they listened?  It certainly doesn't appear they do at all.  Stop spending time trying to fix their mistakes and either enjoy the game "for what it is" in its current state or move on to another, one that both understands and respects its player base.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My rant:
---
When GW1 launched there wasn't as much competition out there.  Now, 7+ years into GW2 there are so many competent games out there that the lore and aesthetics of the Guild Wars franchise can only carry it so far.
---
Add to that the rabid "fAnBoIs", who drive away players with their absurd mental gymnastics, will claim that the only "criticism" worth merit is from players who still play \[particular game modes\].
---
Any criticism that can be said has been said.
---
I hang around because I cling to hope that someone within the company, one who has integrity, understands the two-way street that is "loyalty", and isn't wholly short-sighted, will start addressing the litany, the fucking conga-line, of mistakes that management has made and continues to make.
---
Devs: Unionize.  Keep making amazing games.
---
Management: Get your head out of your asses.  You continue to fail upwards, not realizing that you are destructive (or maybe you do realize it and simply don't care about any casualties left in the process -- "casualties" meaning property sucked dry and left to rot as husks).  You are delusional, desperate, and clearly have NO direction whatsoever other than "sell more mtx and bullshit... HAVE YOU SEEN OUR FUNKO POP DOLLS!  THAT IS STILL TOTALLY RELEVANT RIGHT?!  WE'RE GOING TO ANNOUNCE SOMETHING ***HUGE*** IN SIX MONTHS THAT WILL CHANGE THE WAY YOU PLAY OUR GAME... **WITH SYLVARI THEMED BEANIE BABIES!!!!!!!!!!**".
---
Is your "company strategy" 1) lose vet players, 2) get new players to spend some money, 3) new players become vets and lose interest, 4) repeat steps 1-3, E) WHALES LOL...?  Great business strategy.
---
&gt;It's really bad publicity to partner with Dying companies.
---
Birds of a feather...
---
Still think dyes should have their colour swatch as an icon instead of the bottle... Would make everything alot easier :/
---
They partnered with Razer and Alienware when beetle races came out. And that was after Kung fu tea. Selective memory at its finest.
---
Watch your back son... REWE GANG represent
---
Well said. Some people here seem to expect Anet to partner with Coca-Cola or similar, which will never happen. 
---
Partnerships are exactly that - both parties benefit. Quiznos was probably excited to have Anet run a promotion because they are hurting for advertising themselves. 
---
A large company, that is relevant globally, and that feels they'll get a mutually beneficial response from a mmo community talking online probably doesn't exist.
---
WHAT KIND OF GAY HEAVEN IS THIS!??!
---
YES BITCH WORK!
---
the only reason solo druid is hard on dhuum is because you are not able to be on the group most of the time. if you can be in the stack all of the time healing is easy.  scourge can heal itself more than enough to deal with the bombs with decent positioning also can run a marshals/shamans mix so it can deal with the spiders on door.  Just needs to run scepter. Speaking from experience.
---
Thats like... Not very impressive?
---
Btw you can't even 2x the damage of the ren while they spend half the fight doing mechanics...
---
The problem with almost every mtx story is that the m is not micro, the stores are targeted at so-called whales and anybody else is not designed for. This is why I kind of disagree when I hear that it's fine to sell cosmetics. The cosmetics are not designed for people who enjoy that, it is designed for whales. If you like cosmetics as a gameplay feature and are not a whale, you are out of luck in many games, as you cannot earn them ingame either.
---
I don't think gw2 is the worst there, but it's also not great, despite the official gold -&gt; g(other games do it less safe, inofficial ways).
---
Anet.  Do a promotion with Popeyes.  Free skin or something cosmetic with a Chicken Sandwich purchase.  Win.
---
but i do have a boyfriend, so your insult doesnt even make sense now, you embarass yourself
---
I haven't done it for a while, but it should still get done.  It's required for a lot of things, and the general loot it gives is still nice.  Dragonfall would've stolen some of the thunder from Dragon's Stand, especially because you can drop in on it whenever you want rather than being tied to a specific start time, but most people are going to want some variety.
---
And if you're just waiting for an LFG to appear... sometimes you have to take the initiative and start one yourself.  Go to the map when the meta begins and start your own LFG, you might be surprised how many people flock in!
---
Ah, I see. But there's a difference between stating someone is an idiot as a fact as opposed to an opinion. WP did the latter, and I didn't choose to get offended by it, even though technically I fit the description. 
---
I mean, why would I? Should I care about what everyone thinks about any position I take? That way I would never, ever, take any position at all. People are free to disagree with me and to express that. Usually I would consider it a bad taste to resort to insults, but I've listened to the guy. Tell you what, when I'm pissed off like him, I tend to use stronger language. So... it's simpler to just shrug that particular line off and focus on what he had to actually say. He's not wrong, you know.
---
also if you buy eternity and bind it, you get sunrise and the other skin too aside of the eternity skin.
---
You've never listened to [We Like the Moon](https://youtu.be/I9MZNEXrElw)?
---
Those shitty songs were all over the internet back in the day.
---
I've suggested giving new life to racial skills by making them all available to all races.  Similar to the faction and reputation systems in GW1, there would be mastery tracks added for each race requiring activity in their particular territories.  Add an additional F-skill slot for only racial skills and voila - some reasonable replay value with ..probably?.. minimal coding.  (Not to mention some love for Revenant)
---
F2P can still buy gems with real money afaik
---
well subbed to the channel = no ads
---
I really hate GGGs mtx strategy. It doesn't even try to hide that it only targets whales, and absolutely not the average customer. It also uses people's loyalty to them in the founder system, but at least that is more openly using the cost. Still, a whole lot of design only going to a very small amount of the playerbase, but since it's still lucrative everybody else just gets a crippled visual "balance of design" in the game.
---
Shut up idiot
---
I just want to know who asked for this lmao. Who approved it??? Shit looks fuckin ugly haha
---
Imaginary friends don't count!!! XD
---
&gt; The only difference is I'd be spending time doing something I dont enjoy, which leads to burn out, and potentially abandoning the game.
---
Yes, but that should be A.Net's issue, not yours. You should be willing to drop the game at a moment's notice and it shouldn't be up to you to throw additional money at the game to bypass its intentionally poor design.
---
Is creating issues so that you, as a consumer, are expected to throw additional money at the product to fix it really something you wish to support?
---
Wat... Why? How?
---
[Wedding attire for Norn dyed blue.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Wedding_Attire_Outfit)
---
And majority of viewers are not subbed to the channel.
---
This is pretty much the comment that made me uninstall.
---
&gt; Why is having all build templates unlocked the gold standard of what people expect for free?
---
I think the problem is this: no one here is getting anything for  free from this.  They (ANet) took your WvW and PvP templates that auto swapped before this update and then turned them into the slots that exist now.
---
In fact it's true lol, they made more styles for PoF and also when the olmakhan chapter was released
---
That one is amazing!
---
Deluxe offers nothing beyond what you've said.
---
PoF is very worth it, as are the living world seasons. Some of the best map design ANets ever done, and the mounts are extremely fun. The PoF expansion maps don't have big repeatable metas like HoT did, so you'll return to em a bit less, but they are great on the first trip, and for achievement/collection completion.
---
Do pick up the living world seasons 3 and 4 too, great maps there, and some additional mounts are in the Season 4 episodes.
---
Next one should with a napkin maker.
---
Mounts alone is worth it. Deluxe gives the pass if im correct? Which is only really worth it if you´re a pass hoarder like me/ no pass already. Otherwise you can probably pass on it
---
Sunspear Outfit is subpar imo, identity repair kit doesnt doo too much either unless you have a prepared use for it already.
---
Well technically we have this via achievement points. Just you can't do mindless grind, you have to do specific things to progress through it.
---
They get their first attack in, and then... they aren't invisible anymore and you can beat them?
---
Or they sneak past everyone and... they're at the enemy team's spawn point, where there's nothing for them to do?
---
If they want to capture a point, they can't be invisible.  If they aren't invisible, you can fight them.  I really don't see the issue here.  There's a lot of classes that players would be right to complain about having to fight five of them.  Thief just isn't one of them.  Barring a great skill disparity between teams, a team of five Thieves is going to get stomped badly.
---
Oh no, watch out the REWE gang is here ! They'll throw stale Ja chips at us !
---
Its a bit frustrating. I am at 39,4k and I can get another 1041 according to efficiency (500-700 of it pretty easy since I almost never sPVP).
---
But since it is not enough to beat the No.1 I don't bother to get those pvp points.
---
Are you saying...
---
...that this...
---
...is them announcing the next Necromancer elite spec?
---
Holy shit.  I can actually see them doing this.
---
"Thank you for joining us for this announcement in Madison Square Garden to a roaring crowd of 23.  \[Insert generic ~~lie~~  statement about company health.\]
---
We're excited to bring you the next set of ELITE SPECIALIZATIONS!
---
\[Crowd of 23 shouts and claps\].
---
The first of the announcement is the Necromancer Elite Spec: "Quiznos"!  Yes, that's the name.  No.  That's the whole name.  The elite icon, which will now replace your name in the game world is: \[shows picture of a Q with what appears to be some kind of aquatic vessel... with meat on it?\]
---
We're super duper excited to show off the first skill of the new elite: the healing skill, "Delivery please!"
---
\[Shows off the necro pressing 6.  A portal opens and an asura hands the necro a sub sandwich.  The necro eats the sandwich and recovers 15% of their health, gets regen for 3s, and immediately removes all boons, including the regen that was just granted.\]
---
We'll be revealing the other skills over the course of the next 6 months.  Afterwards, we'll be showing off the rest of the elites over the next 5 years (as we continue to develop relationships with failed food businesses or places that are within walking distance of our offices).
---
We hope you're as excited as we are!"
---
Other elites:
---
* Engineer: Radio Shack
---
* Warrior: Menards
---
* Mesmer: Toys 'R' Us
---
* Elementalist: Compaq
---
* Ranger: Pets.com
---
* Thief: Enron
---
* Guardian: Blockbuster
---
* Revenant: Tower Records
---
i guessed so but flamethrower engi is a pretty basic build that almost every engi used at some point, they usually switch it out for better builds as they get better at build craft.
---
but my point is that ppl who are interested don't tend to post here (don't ask me where they do post because i don't keep up with the buildcraft community) and the few who do are usually new to buildcrafting and post very rudimentary builds
---
Good bot.
---
Reminds me of a certain subreddit banning a fish emote.
---
Just a note in case you might've missed it, but a while back they did a pass on the Sunspear outfit and improved the cloth effect of the skirt, so it flows much better now.  If you got the outfit at release and shelved it because it was boring, it might merit another look now.
---
Yeah, though over the course of the years, there's a real good chance a majority of players have paid over the average monthly cost of a sub.
---
and majority of viewers use pc :)
---
Hi,
---
I'm Lyssaroa, staff member of [gw2community.de](https://gw2community.de) and I like to introduce our activities and features around Guild Wars 2 to you.
---
Please let me explain some of the key elements of our website which is targeted to all player groups: Beginner, Farmer, Raid-Experts, Night owls and more :)
---
We maintain some timers (German Language) at our website like:
---
\- the Boss-Timer (with chrome notification) -&gt; [https://www.gw2community.de/event/boss-timer/](https://www.gw2community.de/event/boss-timer/)
---
\- or the Maguuma Day/Night-Timer -&gt; [https://www.gw2community.de/event/maguuma-timer/](https://www.gw2community.de/event/maguuma-timer/)
---
In our Calendar all our recurring events are announced (currently German only) : [https://calendar.gw2community.de/weekly/](https://calendar.gw2community.de/weekly/) (LW means Living World, HoT = Heart of Thorns required, PoF = Path of fire required)
---
We also offer some events in English like the Triple Trouble (Worm) on multiple times per week in the evening.
---
If you're not able to speak German we're welcome you at our Teamspeak [gw2ts.de](https://gw2ts.de) as well! Many of our Commanders are able to speak English. Even if this is not possible usually one of the squad member can help out. We're perform a "everyone can join" concept where you can "follow the commander tag". No speed runs (except specific announcements before) but the perfect event progress for everyone.
---
You want to be a part of our public guild missions? Please look into our calendar and search "Öffentliche Gildenmissionen Communitygilde \[DC1\]". Just join our Teamspeak at the specific time and you can be part of them.
---
Regarding to your "World Boss" question: You can suggest a world boss train at our "Night program event" where YOU decide, what to do.  If some people like your idea we provide you a Teamspeak channel where you can perform your world boss business! :)
---
Any questions? Feel free to answer or send me a short message!
---
Best regards,
---
Lyssaroa

So we are still talking about millions of people who would get the ads, I don't know what you are even trying to say anymore.
---
It's only been [half a year](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/comment/897144/#Comment_897144) since they said they'd do EU promos...
---
POF is a wonderful experience. The first thing you’ll notice is that the maps are less content dense, but that doesn’t mean that it has less to experience. They just spread it out more due to mounts increasing transportation speed. 
---
The story arc in POF is also my favorite. It gets into some long time unanswered questions from even before the games release, and brings out new enemies with motivations that are at least a little more interesting than “I want to destroy all intelligent life”.  The best aspect is the approach taken with the Awakened. You get to see multiple aspects of an undead horde and how it can, in some areas, be something very humanitarian even when it’s an irredeemably evil guy doing it. 
---
The mounts of course are the main draw.  Not only do they open up exploration in the new maps, but they also change how you go about original zones. There is nothing more satisfying than navigating Heart of Thorns content with the Springer. The jungle was always a pain that I hated navigating, but now it’s enjoyable.

The elite specs are also worth considering. I’d say it depends on your play style if they are for you. I haven’t tried them all so I can’t comment on each. The ranger one provides a versatile build that seems like it’s meant to be a strict upgrade to the ranger without changing its general play style, but it increases your ability to customize your character. The necromancer spec lets you be a stronger support by my understanding. Thief is more of a gimmick than anything, you just get long range shenanigans. Revenant spec gives some nice options that can be used for condi or support. The support was already covered before with herald so it’s a bit redundant but it’s a different kind. It needed the condi help. 
---
I think that’s all. So if those don’t interest you don’t get POF.
---
Different servers? lol
---
very fortunately not. literally everyone would have every legendary skin. Youd unlock the skin, and pass the weapon onwards. The price would plummet.
---
Megathreads is exactly what anets wants to delude criticism and drama for the poor decisions of their upper management....
---
There where many post wish had the right to stand on their own when build templates patch hit.
---
I agree that certain amount of low effort post should have been removed, so they dont take away attention to post with more worthwhile discussion.
---
It's got to be beyond spaghetti at this point. More like some sort of quantum noodle that is a superposition of tangled and untangled states, served in a manifold marinara with probabilistic parmesan shavings.
---
The point is this is instant swap.  It's substantially more powerful and  prone to abuse than even the 3rd party hack that was made.  The more templates they had, the more shit they could precast before getting into combat.
---
EDIT: And this could very well break encounters more than they already are.
---
If you enjoy the type of game that GW2 offers, then PoF is 100% worth the money. In fact, it is an insanely good deal. Deluxe edition is a bit more complicated story. How much you value the perks that come with it will vary per person.
---
Hey man, you can always eat the sandwich, why throw it.
---
No, never happy to help. 
---
Grudging, bitter help in exchange for that GoE.
---
I've been lagging the past week on occasion and I'm on 1 gig fiber through Ethernet. I honestly think it's the first time I've ever really seen lag on the game.
---
I wish I could up vote this more than once.  You are so right about the dye channel issues!
---
You can ask for a refund, though.  I'm pretty sure I've done that on other outfits with issues.  Won't hurt to ask.
---
Likewise here, but there's usually also an Aldi (it's called Hofer here, for some reason) and/or an EuroSpin in a 500m radius of the Lidl. There might even be more than one Lidl per city. It's becoming quite ridiculous.
---
Just do daily meta rotation, which cycles every 2 hours. Wyvern Matriarch in Verdant Brink at xx:10, Gerent in Tangled Depths at xx:30, Octovine in Auric Basin at xx(+1):00. The "bouncy chest" you get at the end contains a lot of the currencies. 
---
You can also do events on the maps before the main metas (pylons in AB, pact events in VB, lane events in TD). There are often squads advertising meta events in lfg, so join them and hop to their map.
---
These events give you the currencies themselves plus keys for chests which give additional currencies.
---
&gt;you guys really need to get rid of invisibility
---
or you need to get good.
---
if you see someone stealth, you can expect them to attempt an attack within the next 2 seconds. there are a few exceptions such as  elixir s or some elite skills, but the classes that are able to frequently stealth can usually only do so for 3s at a time. if you don't know what they can do, then try playing those classes, or at least read up on the build. if you're not willing to invest the time to learn, then there's nothing else to say here.
---
tl;dw
---
Well FFXIV actually needs those, that game is pretty ugly and stiff compared to GW.
---
This looks terrible :o
---
I don't know whether a powerful tide-turner elite skill would be interesting. Sure it would be good for the user as an 'I win' button, but it wouldn't be too much fun to play against. 
---
I think 90 seconds should be like an upper limit for the cooldowns of elite skills.
---
Just what market are they targeting?
---
Increasing the amount of available skills (utility AND weapon) without even touching the "specializations" would breathe a lot more life into the game, but that's not how the game designers have been thinking about the game for several years now. Having 15 different skills instead of 5 for each weapon for every profession could be really interesting for build-crafting, and by now we could have easily been there. After a while it becomes something that ANet could do on a cadence, the way WotC releases M:tG sets (just on a smaller scale).
---
More elite skills would also be welcome, and yes locking them behind meta events or something could be OK as long as the work is not super oppressive or grindy. Having a tough dungeon boss that rewards you with an interesting skill? Sounds like a good reason to actually play the damn game!
---
Apart from a promotion, apparently...
---
Out of the loop here. What's going on with GW2 and Quiznos?
---
Well done.
---
Whisperer in the Darkness.. Like Nyarlathotep?
---
Coming in a season focused around Charr...
---
Bangar's forces are ultra nationalists who believe in Charr Supremacy...
---
LS5Ep0 references "One Nation, One Fuhrer"...
---
In Persona 2, Nyarlathotep is Hitler.
---
LS5 is making both references to nazis AND references to Nyarlathotep.
---
Hitler confirmed new antagonist for GW2.
---
As someone's who's worked in a few catering places... How do you not make profit on food?! 
---
Standard mark-up for food is about 300% the cost of ingredients! That's astoundingly bad management.
---
There is a Quiznos one block from my place. I stop there periodically, although they aren't very busy. The parking lot is usually empty and anytime I go in there, the most I've seen is 4 or 5 people.
---
&gt;Should I care about what everyone thinks about any position I take?
---
WP as an individual? who cares?
---
As one of the largest creators for the game? *kind of* an issue to call people idiots for their valid grievances with the game
---
Oh no, you Piranha-don't!
---
This seems to be the case for all of the donation drive items like True Mettle. It's an oddity, and I'm not sure why that's the case, but I think it's to do with the flavor more than spaghetti code
---
Lay offs, CEO leaving, projects cancelled... The company is in bad condition currently. It doesn't affect you as new player, however, because even if Anet gets shut down next year the game will be maintained for at least few years. As new player, for 30 bucks, you're getting at least solid 18 months of fun.

Four reasons for me to never participate a swepstake.
---
You know, marketing with them would make sense if there were active businesses in their area. But even it still doesnt make sense sending an email to everyone. Anet, quiznos practically died in the last recession. Alive no more. Pining for the fjords. Dead.
---
Yuppppp I’m inclined to agree with this
---
When a Pug says meta we refer to the optimal PUG composition to easily farm stuff, not what speedrunners use.
---
Also, running fractals with complete strangers of varying skill levels is arguably harder than with a minmaxed team of top 20% players.
---
You know, those same players that complain and cry every time they have to Pug... While people that Pug every day just run the thing without breaking a sweat.
---
I agree, every time I go back to starter zones for world completion I always discover something new and interesting, no matter how many times I've been there before.  Try just listening to some of the ambient dialogue for a change.  Some of it is really funny.   The core game is much more rich with content than the new zones IMHO.
---
Man, ours only existed for 3 years. And that was like 15 years ago. It's that bad.
---
Dungeons liquid gold nerf, dungeons dead content, fractals, fractal rework, dungeons too easy, dungeons too hard, dungeons too elitist, hot too hard, hot too easy, Raids can fill up an entire post. Nullification sigils (hello requiem armor, they are sub 1g now) X is broken for Y years, Z is OP A is nerfed I to the ground, B isnt viable, theres been no balance patch. We hate/want/love/never again want/bring back desert BL bring back/kill Y map, no tutorial, EOTM is a karma farm/best place to learn/needs more/less rewards etc. Etc. I could go on and on and on. there is basically outrage since the start of the game, especially on this subreddit. This is par for the course well before HoT launched.
---
Calls people trash, garbage, etc.
---
Gets unsettled when they get downvoted
---
Pikachuface.jpg
---
Also there is no such thing as a meta comp for fractals, every boss is different, but lets not go there, it doesnt work so well if we want to trashtalk people thinking we are better.
---
I checked the other day for the Extra Life associated skins &amp; there were only 3. Old Ascalon, another pingable/sellable weapon, and Salvation which is account Bound and no code was there to ping it. Would link it but I'm at work and no game wikis, start with Old Ascalon, Commander.
---
I still come to the reddit but since August 30th (the announcement) I've started hiding toxic posts mainly cause I had only discovered the hide feature a few days before the announcement.
---
I would have been happier with a good answer, but nobody seems to have one.
---
This is not even remotely true, people were ecstatic here when PoF was releasing. The subreddit is generally positive after any release, the negativity trends upwards the longer we go without a release, because ANet rarely communicates outside releases. This means the longer we go without a release, the longer we go with hearing effectively nothing from ANet, and in the absence of any information, negative feelings grow as uncertainty grows.
---
I don't know. I know a Harley fan and $25 for an ornament he can use for his hobby? He'd laugh at the paltry sum. Everything is at least three digits there (and having that motorbike in his life is a significant part of his budget concerns - he is not rich).
---
Sure a motorbike gets you around for real while a mount is all virtual travel but let's get real, he didn't buy a Harley just to 'get around'.
---
So I can only guess that if you want to show off in a videogame instead of on the road then $25 for a prestige mount skin is laughably cheap too.
---
I don't think $25 mounts are aimed at regular people, is what I mean. So I won't run away from them, I will ignore them and buy, maybe, one of the 'birthday gift random' $5 ones.
---
Just like I am eagerly waiting to know the real price of these templates -that is, their on sale price. I can wait (and my sincere thoughts go to those who cannot afford to wait due to their being separated from their beloved app).
---
I think they just have different target audiences. IMO gw2 is targetting players with limited time while WoW is for players that can sink as many hours as they want.
---
And back in the pre-HoT days (I think), they partnered with SteelSeries to make a GW2 mouse. Great idea but the mouse that they made wasn't great for playing GW2...not even the best in the SteelSeries lineup for it.
---
So I guess it's another point to support your argument but also another point in the argument that GW2's marketing team struggles to really hit their mark.
---
Even in this case, it's a weird promo on both ends. Quiznos is kinda well past it's prime, but it might be a good promo for them if ANet would have the code unlock *your choice* of the largely newbie friendly package they actually offered, OR a more vet friendly package with maybe 2-400 gems. Or an exclusive armor set or weapon skin. Or a mount skin. Or BL statuettes. Or 25 gold. Or some ecto.
---
There's just so many things they could offer but there's just no incentive for a random sandwich eater to use the promo code nor is there much incentive for a GW2 vet to go get a sub.
---
ArenaNet's marketing team just leaked.
---
Their next advertisement will be at the seniors' knitting club.
---
Because we have no vertical progress (grind levels and gear) but horizontal (you can be anything). And if you think that it's easy to just change build and gear then you are mistaken. You need an actual skill and game understanding so you always learn.
---
You can max 20 classes easily bit you will suck hard at them even having BiS gear.
---
I can see his point. Basically he is copping a lot of flak from some people because he disagrees with them on the build template issue. I am in a similar position to WP in this regard. My play style means that I will only ever make fairly limited use of this feature (unless something changes dramatically) so it really doesn't affect me.
---
The difference between us is I am nobody and he is a content creator with a profile in the community. He has a right to his opinion and a right to express it however he wants. No one has a right to expect him to agree with a particular view, and/or publicise and push that view if he doesn't share it.
---
I dont think anyone is laughing at how useless it is to current players, people are laughing at it because its Quiznos. A company that went bankrupt like 4 years ago and closed most of their stores and are pretty much nowhere to be found most places.
---
&gt; " I came up with this 100% on my own therefore its good and fun" 
---
I'm more seeing the negative of that sentence : "Others are forcing me to play that way, and I dislike to be forced" which inducing "i find my way of playing funnier". It's basic psychology encountered anywhere else. It's a game, not a work, you don't have to learn to play perfectly or even remotely great. 95% of people usually in mmorpg (even in games with an heavy raid presence) doesn't care about really min maxing. Most of it because it requires being forced to play in a way dictated by others or just to need too more focus. That's why lfr exists in wow, and that's why strikes are being created in GW2. To play without caring about following a pattern sequence and still killing stuff. With the time passing, i'm more considering that way personally. Even ten years ago I was like min maxing gw2 dudes in other games (wow, rift), but now smashing buttons and seeing sparkling effects while watching a video on another screen is good enough. At the release of the first strike, i disliked pretty much the jumping part, the poor basic combat difficulty and only did once. Since I knew the tp at the end existed a week ago, i'm doing it daily. And the more i'm doing it, the more i feel the difficulty is adapted to the majority of players and makes that instance great and interesting to do because it's toxicity free.
---
Optimization has its own appeal although that is assuming you are actually doing it yourself and not following someone else's guide but that also depends on context. I would happily follow an optimized route for something like the Skyscale collections because there is no value in running around scrutinizing every nook and cranny.
---
Nah, they were decent warm and toasted sandwiches. They got into a few scandals and had a weird add campaign with mice which didn't help.
---
Me in New Zealand surprised to see gem cards for the first time in my local EB games. Then sees Quiznos partnership and goes cool wish it was MacDonalds or subway.
---
lol i wish pug rens would do that much dps
---
My friend does that (Ive seen 11k too).
---
Or different drop tables altogether. This is a very important question.
---
What for? Herald gives you all you need. But you can never have too much might
---
I loooove these skins. It has a neato effect. I think this is the 3rd or 4th skin of the set i have now.
---
Wow thats impressive in itself lol
---
Probably because other games have much more specific strengths.
---
Yeah, I was wondering if they'll ever do anything with that kid when I played it. Has only been a couple years though and I doubt they're old enough yet.
---
Lmfao
---
Some people just dont play for achievements. 
---
I got the game shortly after release and have been playing on and off, sitting around 13k.
---
AP just dont matter to me. I didnt even bother doing dailies for quite a bit when I didnt feel like it.
---
So are we talking about your friend or pugs now?
---
And are you talking about boss or cleave dps?
---
100% someone in the office was eating Quiznos for lunch and another staffer said "I have an idea how we can get free Quiznos, AND make money at the same time!"
---
The main difference is that IIRC, Ranger, Paragon, Dervish, and Assassin only each have *one* specific weapon type. You've got Bows, Spears, Scythes, and Daggers. Warrior's the only one with multiple types iirc. And yeah, the only real reason to use Staff or Wand is that those have bonuses for certain spell types, but I can and HAVE used Sword &amp; Board on a Monk (it was a Stupid Idea, but that's what's nice about GW1 -- there's so many Stupid Ideas to try!) and there's plenty of reason to use x/W with Warrior weps.
---
ye this is just average daily run, world record without double dh is around 1:10?~
---
still i don't think its possible to do 2x damage on fb on any boss, it will be around 15k vs 20k, 
---
and rev spend only 3 seconds doing 1 ball in 3rd phase
---
That's actually a great idea! It'd give people a reason to use racial abilities, and it'd mean Anet wouldn't have to keep them basically useless to discourage people from playing one particular race because it's "meta." Basically, each race *starts* with their racials, but you can go and learn the techniques / magic from them, just like in GW1. Humans could learn Bear Form in GW1, I think? (I'm still doing Nightfall, haven't gone to EotN yet)
---
Is it really that much more of a nightmare than balancing elite specs though?
---
Er...can I just get the Wolf?   Please?
---
We dont do Fullclears really. We usually just do 2-3 wings per evening and all the Videos you see are usually records/speed killls that are obviously grinded and faster than our daily kills.
---
It looks like Sonic after puberty
---
How long would 2-3 wings take? I just pug and it takes about an hour per wing
---
Yea...the issue is that they are still NCSoft's bitch.
---
Considering it took an OP PvP build and instead of nerfing it, doubled-down on what makes it OP?  Not a minor hotfix.
---
“Hey, GW2 partnered with Quiznos”
---
“Quiznos still exists?”
---
“Apparently”
---
“Well that’s stupid”
---
“Yeah”
---
“Also what’s a Guild Wars 2?”
---
“No idea”
---
End of advertising influence
---
Name me a company that went through lay off because they were doing great.
---
See how that works?
---
No, but do you really need one?
---
What a joke.
---
The plain bodysuit alone would look nice, but they have to go and tack some weird feathers on it
---
It's amazing 😂
---
I want to officially offer my servies to ANet for their marketing and advertising needs. ANet, if you read this, I'm available for a consult.
---
People say this, but forget without ncsoft you would never play gw1 or 2
---
If most of the playerbase for GW1 had already quit, the monetization wouldn't have been enough to do anything other that delay maintenance mode for a while. 
---
While GW2 was a chance for a fresh start, where they could draw some of their old players back while also pulling in a bunch of new ones.
---
It's the same reason that SOE made EverQuest 2, because the original game had bled off a huge amount of its players and they needed new blood to replace them.
---
It's also why there's never been a WoW2, as their playerbase has never shrunk to the point of needing a big  hype boom like that to attract new people.
---
Classic virgin.
---
No, it's pretty hilarious how clueless you are.
---
Come back when u actually run some Pug fractals
---
But this is what you do in a lot of MMOs, face tank the mob while your friend dishes out DPS.
---
depends how old the norn let their younglings go I guess, I assumed by her height she woulda been around 14-16.
---
I did only say the campaign would get people to talk about the two items mentioned, and nothing about actual conversion rates.
---
No it wont effect the game in near future unless you feel that it is gambreaking for you to only have 2 template slots and that you have to buy more for more builds (were you can exchange ingame gold to gems as well and buy for that). This is what the whole civil war is about here on reddit for now. 
---
The game have tons of content for open world, story, fractals(our dungeons), raids, wvw, pvp, and lots of other things. If you are a veteran and have played everything for years then yeah you might run out of things to do, but this is not your problem within the next few years. 
---
So try it out, see what you like, but remember the endgame is not the leveling, that is just were you learn how to play the game, so you will run in to harder conent when you reach endgame.
---
Oh yeah yeah, I hear ya. Wasn’t disagreeing or anything. Just joking about how stupid this whole ad campaign is
---
What are you even cleaving at skor he has no adds :/
---
I'll be honest, that part of a legendary is completely worthless to me.
---
I'm right with ya!  Played since Beta but just under 9500.  AP hunting was never really my thing, and going after them now is a struggle.  For instance trying to get story achievements in pugs because all your guild mates are long gone.  Fortunately good folk like AyinMayden and Duffy have spent a lot of time on helpful vids.
---
Does that also mean anything is fine as long as a possible work around exist? Are there any constraints on what can be considered a workaround?
---
As a more extreme made up example, if there was a bug that deletes items would the fact that the item can be repurchased be considered an acceptable workaround(this would also imply there are constraints)?
---
There *are* some ludicrous posts but personally I just ignore them anyway so they are irrelevant to me. What is the point of paying attention to those? On the other hand off simply dismissing any issue as long as there is some sort of workaround isn't great either.
---
I really don’t think the outfit is that bad, everything else not being too great right now definitely makes it easier to not like the outfit.
---
Anyway, that chair thooooo
---
Every time I do story now, I feel a little stressed cause of the achievements. I’d see those little yellow icons disappear and go, “WHAT DID I MISS???? Will I ever find a group to replay this with so I can get achievements faster?????” 😭
---
There's nothing else that can be done then, you're our only hope.
---
Plz gib codez /s
---
made a post a while ago saying that you can't buy gem in a physical store in europe anymore. This problem is definitly old
---
The mods are POS on this sub they just want the game to die
---
To add to this, all you have to do is attack the gerent; you still energize the spirit thread even if you dont kill it!
---
Hey, returning player here trying to finish up some Maguuma Masteries. I'm at 4/6 with Nunoch and Itzal and was wondering the best way to get the rest of those done. Stuff like running specific events or farming certain mobs, etc.
---
I mean, you can't really blame people tho?
---
In 1.5years anet didn't really improve on any of the major complaints and keeps making mistake after mistake after mistake and keeps putting up a big middlefinger to  certain communities.
---
They said they don't want hard raids anymore, even tho raiders were incredible unhappy with the latest 2 roleplay wings which were way to easy. Even the CM's are way to easy for being called a challenge mode and then they refuse to make CM's repeatable for rewards because of the fun excuse "It'd split up the community".
---
Last stuff added or reworked to fractals were incredible badly received by the community because they were incredible unfun and the reworked fractals were made into a chore. And they said They'd never add another CM again, even though the dedicated fractal players loved 100CM. Oh and they reduced the Fractal team and raid team to one team and moved the others away to other stuff like 1.5-2years ago.
---
PvP players keep asking for a new and good mode for PvP for ages and anet just refuses to try and come up with a good mode with the help of the top PvP players, which resulted in the vast majority of good PvP players bailing to the point being in the top 100 is lowkey meaningless. High plat can be matched up with low gold because incredible low playerbase, which results in no fun for anyone and it's filled with bots that ruin even more fun. On top of all this, there is literally no punishment for people who just afk at start and anet doesn't even bother doing anything against bots and griefers.
---
WvW got promised alliance for 1.5years now and all they got was no more language borders on EU servers, so now u can be matched with people who refuse or are unable to speak anything but their native which is incredible fun to have as linked server. And we still don't have any progress news on alliances other than "Uhm we're still working on it, no need to worry at all".
---
Like I'd say the hate towards Anet increased unjustified, but Anet is literally the cause of getting more and more hate. You can't expect a company to get equal amount of praise as hate when they deliver more bad stuff than good. :/
---
Right, which only matters if you play all three modes.
---
If you play all three modes, you "lose" one template. If you play two, you get the inconvenience of having to remember to switch. But if you only play one mode, it's a lot better than nothing, and quite a bit convenient.
---
Just saying - it's not "literally worse than nothing" for everyone.
---
Well goody for people who only play one mode.  Maybe they should have designed something that was good for all players and that worked well within their current system instead
---
I either knew someone or read about someone who used to own a Quiznos. Apparently iirc they're ran almost like a pyramid scheme where it's cheap to get in, but in order to stay with them you had to buy Quiznos direct food that was incredibly overpriced so it was impossible to make enough money to buy out of your contract
---
I will do it. Just send me money for the sandwich.
---
Is this real?
---
Anet does plenty to be critical of, wvw, pvp, raids, fractals are all in various states of severe decline and people have every right to be loud about it when these are/should be major selling points for the game. The only bullshit here is this awful attitude where the criticism is dismissed as being bullshit spouted by a tiny vocal minority when in reality its entire game modes crying out for some support from anet. By dismissing this criticism and hiding in your "these game modes don't effect me so the game is great" bubble you're only hurting the game further tbh. It's great that you like gw2 and enjoy but if you like it so much I don't get why anyone would dismiss the complaints when they're really just people who want gw2 to reach it's full potential and are voicing opinions on areas that anet is failing in and could improve the game as a whole by addressing.
---
To add to this, the cultural helms don't fit some of the faces (iirc some of the masks don't scale with your character's head, so some of the newer faces can't see out of them) and the t3 light helm removes charr hair despite being a mask that doesn't actually cover the head.
---
I didn't say Anet don't have anything that shouldn't be criticized and when I say vocal minority I mean it. Do I mean someone who makes a critical post explaining their problems with a game type and how they'd fix it no. Do I mean people who every time they post something its to complain even when there is nothing to complain about. I'll use my example from earlier people complaining about Anet using the release date for episode 1 to raise money for charity people who complained about this are the toxic ones. If you have problems air them but be respectful to the devs who put hours into making this game but I'm not going to apologize for calling out the toxic minority who aren't trying to be constructive like 99% of the community the 1% of this community who are trying to drag it down should be called out and challenged.
---

---
Maybe you should try to be less agressive?
---
Haha welcome to anet mate
---
This isn't the first time a subset of players has been shafted in favour of another
---
Doing the meta events is usually a solid source of XP
---
I'm not saying they should I'm talking about the 1% who have either quit the game but hang around the reddit attacking it every chance they get or people have never played the game. Thats the vocal minority I'm talking about. The issues you raise are good ones and I see many posts on these that aren't toxic and are constructive but theres that mob who decide to bring the reddit down and that who I'm talking about.
---
Hm.. not quite similar. Wave self give you a limited time to use 4 attunements, then enables the Perfect Weave right away. 
---
I mean something that t would have to be shown with an ammo counter that enables the skill when reaching a large number like 100, or with the skill filling up like adrenaline in GW1. Something generally much slower to fill up, to keep the skill from being used again too often unless under heavy pressure that fills it faster.
---
Reportedly, corporate mandated all product and equipmeny be purchased through them for brand standards reasons, but it was all sold at high markup. They also fixed the sale prices. So, according to these reports, corporate did well, but each individual franchise went under quickly.
---
yeah i tried being creative by avoiding calling vag a vag
---
all jokes can't be winners people, lessons - learned, vagina - glued, ooga-booga - achieved, hotel - trivago
---
No its true Anet needed a publisher I mean they could possibly joined Activision or EA.
---
Maybe if we made a gofundme for anet so they could hire a proper pr agency, that knew how to do actual pr that work, they wouldnt do shit like this over and over again?
---
Technically its not 7 years of content if you count season 1 as a year.
---
For people out of the know, it is one of the top 5 commercials of all time....in my own list of commercials at least.
---
Did Quiznos know that GW2 isn't a mobile game?

It was in danger of being too overtly sexual so they put a bunch of random shit on it to make it seem not so.

What is that.

WHAT IS THAT!

&gt; force players to participate in all game modes including raids.

They should do this, just so I can watch the firestorm that would follow.

Virgin, how original. Going to make a note of that sharp burn. What a epic journey you've taken in the last six months by going from clueless thief to clueless firebrand. Soon you'll be good enough to carry my used jockstrap.

Kodak failed because of market changes, and failure to predict and adapt to the future (the world of smart phones)...before layoffs. Kinda like how Blackberry's been failing.

Yes...1...yes...2...arguable.

I got it after opening 1.

Pretty much my experience from ......2012

No need to get defensive. Its 18 to 24 months of content,,including profression.

OMG i got a stalker!!! Who are you? Another butthurt scrub?
---
By the way i have 3k+ hrs on guard over the past 2400 days, maybe you have the wrong person?
---
Tack!! First of all i just made full ascended loadout for my mirage, second of all im two maps away from making a bifrost, thirdly I just bought a character slot plus a bank tab for gold converted to gems, fourthly I have about 300 gold invested in stuff and lastly I have not really farmed the labby.

Well, if I can have max stacks of might without the sigil, then what use would that sigil be?
---
Huh, that was an interesting rant. Seems like he's pretty tired of the 24/7 outrage of the mob.
---
Yea but you won‘t have max stacks with the current build
---
Sure, I totally get what you mean but I thought someone might enjoy reading it
---
 FFXIV does.
---
3k+ on guard but can't hit 80% of benchmark, doesn't understand when to take sword vs scepter, doesn't understand symbols, etc.
---
Can you make it even easier to mock you?
---
&gt; I still have some faith that A-Net isn't as incompetent as everyone keeps saying they are
---
My faith has dwindled quite a bit compared to how I felt in the GW1 days. I've started looking into other games to play.
---
I am doing world completion number three and it's the first time with mounts - so wonderful! Same observations as you. Example: I had forgotten how many quaggan villages there are! Yesterday I just enjoyed checking out their lanterns and their huts and dialogue and... all of it. A key part of it for me is also running into the random other players exploring, doing events and hearts, and helping out, etc. It's not entirely solo and running into different people who I don't know  is a key part of the fun. 
---
The goal part - I totally did a speed run of all the stories and tasks to get all mounts during the summer. That focus was fun too. I like the variety.  That's what I love about this game - so many modes, so many options, and a lovely place to do it in. 
---
Anyway - also enjoying world completion again, and heartily second your encouragement!
---
Cleave dps is frowned upon because you inflate DPS by aoeing adds.
---
That doesnt happen in skorvald. There you actually have an artificially lower dps because you are not fighting the boss.
---
The adds there do not alter DPS at all. Without counting them you are just lowering your DPS for no reason. (Also, cleave in stuff like arts is actually good to have, because, you know.... You are killing stuff instead of taking free damage).

Quiznos corporate apparently makes most of their money by bilking their franchises until they go out of business.  They've been [sued multiple times for it](https://www.mashed.com/132827/the-real-reason-why-quiznos-is-disappearing-across-the-country/).

Took me five seconds to search for "Kung Fu Tea" on this subreddit and then sort by  "top" and "all time". Boom. Dozens of threads about all the issues and happenings.
---
Found em:  https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=Shetsa+guild+wars+2&amp;sp=EgIIAw%253D%253D
---
Wow, is there a write-up on how to do this? That's nuts.
---
Thinking back about this, I actually wonder how Kung Fu Tea thinks about Arenanet now, I wouldnt be surprised at all if they really dislike the company now because they got their App destroyed by the promotion :&gt;
---
The chance of getting it in the exact UG I did is just as low as it is in the very first
---
I typically have a specific playstyle in mind and try to make it optimal, even if the playstyle itself isn't
---
I've been running my rifle Deadeye for as much content as possible and having a blast with it. Not sure how much success I'll have when I start running fractals, though
---
That's what im planning
---
Would be nice if australia could get some attention for once.
---
Same answer for all these cross promotions in general.
---
1) lack of interest in the other product
---
2) other business may not even exist where the player is located
---
3) NA only which is like a variation of 2)
---
KFT had the additional problem of technical issues. I think the promotional period was for a month and the technical issues basically covered around a quarter of that.
---
you see, but the whole point of gemstores and their ilk are to confound the actual prices
---
Sure your half right there. I never used arcdps which had an addon for build templates before being asked to be removed 2 weeks before the build templates came. Sure I wanted build templates, but I dont need them. It makes switching builds and gear easier for sure. But it does not give you an edge stat wise to be able to be more superior than someone who doesnt use them. It is pay for convenience, but def not p2win. Gw2 has been operating the gem store as pay2look cool and pay4convenience since 2012, it hasn't changes, sure there are lootboxes, but no reward in the gem store ever gave best in slot items that are better than what you can get in the game normally. People have different definitions with the word p2win, imo p2win means just as I said, paying to get best in slot gear, that makes a player superior(statwise) compared to another player who has decided not to support the game.
---
Im really out of the loop here..  what is happening??
---
&gt;I encourage you to understand that other people have different perspectives than you.  
---
Take your own advice and stop being a hypocrite.  Thanks.
---
Yes that is why a couple of weeks ago you posted that you are mediocre DPS dragonhunter.
---
Aww, did I hurt your feelings? Please tell me more.
---
At first, start doing story and try to do dungeons story as soon as you can. Whenever something catches your attention simply wiki it. This could give you a nice pace to learn everything as you go. 
---
Do hearts, read in game books, pay attention to details in story mode.
---
Horrible - the ONLY thing that makes Scourges viable in WvW and they are nerfing it. It's like they don't understand the game at all. Basically this will result in 1 of 2 things: either zergs will have MORE Scourges, to make up for the loss in effectiveness, or they won't have any.
---
"I complain [...] but i'm still playing after seven years." 
---
Well said. (-:
---
"Qui aime bien, châtie bien." End of the story. Complaining doesn't mean dislike.
---
They make plenty of money and the sheer lack of content delivered elsewhere in contrast to the effort put back into the store whilst neglecting other aspects of the game is precisely why the gem store hurts us all. The idea for buy once and optional purchases is just that, you don't need to. Not everyone is expected to pay and not everyone should. 
---
I've spent plenty on the store but they're just taking the piss now with items that really ought to be paid for. I actually think this game would have been better with zero MT and a £11.99 monthly subscription. At least then ANet could work within what they knew what they were going to earn as opposed to relying on gem store frequenters. I'm still pissed about the lack of bug fixes over the last 7 years.
---
It's the official forums. You'd get less censorship in China than over there.
---
Well according to the dictionary, this is the definition of obtuse:
---
1.
---
annoyingly insensitive or slow to understand.
---
I'm assuming that either of those things could be construed as insulting. Not sure why people can't answer a question without throwing in something that belittles other players myself.  I try not to do that personally. I just don't see a reason for it.
---
&gt; ...whataboutism...
---
If you're going to try use specific terms to further digress from the topic (as you've already attempted to do so), make sure you understand them first...especially when you're already failing an argument against someone more knowledgeable than yourself; else, you look like a fool.
---
I knew both of those meanings...
---
The context was "slow to understand" - in that he was totally missing the point of the argument being presented. Not just my point, but ones by others as well. It was quite a circular argument that seemed to be getting nowhere.
---
I'd suggest asking on the GW 1 sub. r/GuildWars
---
But asking if someone is being "obtuse" isn't an insult. It simply, in this context, was asking if he understood the point being made. What's insulting about that?
---
you called other people dumb
---
It's for ritual prostitution. Or maybe ritual drinking at a cheap bar.
---
Rofl, these two comments are basically the ESSENCE of WvW.

&gt;At  least he understands Boons will become dominant and might become a  problem. I do find it funny he thinks its not like that already. Its  already nigh impossible to peel buffs and keep them off. Its much easier  to spam them and have them up 24/7.

---
I think what he's saying is that right now it feels like boons are irremovable until your entire group gets shade bombed and you lose stability and get swept, but if you only nerf scourge then the boons will just never go away and nothing will ever happen.

&gt; The person who brought up inflation was talking about the value of the currency, which is the correct way to discuss inflation or deflation, and was raising a valid point.
---
Ok, but again, *the point of the discussion was not inflation,* so the person who brought up inflation may have been "using that term correctly," (even though he didn't actually *say* "inflation" so he wasn't actually using that term at all), but he was not *applying* it correctly to the topic being discussed, as "altering the value of the currency" was not at that point a part of the discussion. You're just defending a pointless non-sequitur. 
---
&gt;But since currency continues to inflate overall, those items and any other items which are worth close to the cap will continue increasing in price until they hit the cap again. 
---
One, this game has not experienced significant inflation overall, a least not enough to project a long term curve of significant ongoing inflation. 
---
Two, even if there is inflation and the price of those items continues to increase, that just means that measures need to continue to be taken to decrease them so that the price continues to remain low relative to gold.
---
&gt;And then, by this proposed solution, you make them more common again, as well as any other items that are worth 5k or more today and which end up at the 10k mark in a couple of years.
---
&gt;And then a couple years later anything which costs 2.5k today.
---
&gt;And then everything which costs 1k.
---
I'm not understanding your point here though. You're saying that if there is runaway inflation, that things will get more expensive, and your prposed reaction to that is to just permanently increase the amount people are *allowed* to pay, so that it can keep up with when every item in the game costs thousands of gold. Ok, but. . .
---
why not just *not* have runaway inflation, and *not* have everything cost thousands of gold? 
---
I mean that seems to have been working so far, why stop now?
---
What do you see as the benefit to runaway inflation?
---
&gt;A solution which only affects the expensive items and doesn't prevent the inflation of the CURRENCY will fail because 10k gold becomes less and less valuable over time, making the limit more and more restrictive.
---
The solution proposed is not *about* inflation. It doesn't reduce inflation, but doesn't cause more either. It is irrelevant to the sort of inflation you're talking about. If there is a risk of inflation then it would need to be addressed, but using methods that have nothing to do with the point being raised. It's like someone says "I don't like how the current build templates work, here's a way I think they could be better. . ." and your response it "but how does that solve inflation?!" Not everything has to be about inflation.
---
&gt;Do not accuse me of pedantry when your entire argument is about ignoring the actual point the person you replied to made in favour of trying to score points with the language used. 
---
Again, I did not ignore what he said, I was just addressing a different portion of his comment than you were assuming. I was not addressing the pointless diversionary aspect of it, and was only addressing the portion that was relevant to the post *he* was responding to.
---
Lol. I assumed I was under a microscope, and anything I wrote would be examined closely.
---
Too funny. You'd think they would be less apt to piss players off - especially ones that buy gems fairly regularly - now that the game seems to be in some sort of...flux(?)...in terms of the number of players.
---
All we get is blablah and no release...
---
Mom jokes, you are a intellectual giant. Obviously you are a top tier player given how you run healbrand for strikes and hard carry everyone there. I can't wait until you manage to clear your raid wings soon for your legendary trinket and armor. I'll be sure to send you a present for doing those mighty feats.
---
Why cant they just copy the Dhuum throne for Charr sit animation?!?  It is also a great size.
---
What!? ANet and useless decitions? Such pair has never been seen before..
---
This kind promos are so goddamn useless, it blows my mind how they even come up with this shit..
---
And I will say it again once more, amazing game, but goddamn its run by a dumb company
---
Its nearly 2020 and we go for a sandwish promo intead of actual Twitch or YouTube, things that would actually help the game grow..
---
Pathethic once more
---
Better late than never.
---
There are probably almost as many people who solo MMOs as there are people who play it to group. Saying that the core experience is driven by social interaction and working together is true for one demographic not all demographics.
---
There are plenty of people who like the changing world of an MMO without having to interact with people. There are plenty of people who have challenging lives and jobs where they have to get up suddenly, or they can't get on voice because of kids/noise in the background and they don't really coordinate with anyone.
---
If every solo player left this game right now, I guarantee you the game would be in trouble.
---
Scott Hartsman who was the head dev of Rift said straight out that game devs who ignore solo players are putting their games at risk and even this game had a question in the FAQ before launch about whether you could solo it.
---
Sure there are is a demographic of people who play MMOs only to interact. But there are others who play MMOs for different reasons. I suspect it's a bigger group than you believe it to be.
