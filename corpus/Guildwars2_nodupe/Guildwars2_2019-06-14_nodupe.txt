This is a big FUCK YOU and SPIT IN THE FACE to the people who counted on exchanging their LI to LD. Thanks anet. You didn't want to "force" people to play the old and much easier wings for their armor, so you'll force them to play the new ones for 10 LDs max a week, which will be more like 4-5 to people that don't or can't do full clears. No, I don't enjoy your new wings, fuck dhuum, fuck statues, fuck largos and w6 qadim i don't care for that shit. Let me mindlessly grind w1 and w4, it's enough we waited 2 years for the ring with a shitty effect which I only want just to complete my aurora &amp; vision
---
---
---
Fair, to each their own.
---
It is there. The issue is the OP didn't take into account that people may not be interested in this, and as such they let the questionnaire carry on instead of ending it when we answered "I'm not ready to subscribe to a cloud gaming service If no, why? &gt;I have no interest in cloud gaming".
---

---
At which point, maybe an open-ended question asking 'why we have no interest in cloud gaming' to finish the questionnaire would have been an appropriate way of ending it.
---
Legend hahaha
---
So now i am mad? And Legitimate criticism, you claim something to be in a way it is not and yet you feel entitled anyway and if you get questioned you throw the "you mad bro" which have zero relevans, because the fact is you can get leather in many ways but the most easy one is through salvage gear you get as drop. Gear as drop you will be drowned in as long as you play. If you want to farm those bags then by all means do so, but don't try and tell us that you have legitimate criticism when you have nothing on the kind. You simply did not know, and could instead of throwing a fit ask is this the only way or is there other ways. 
---
Either way i spent way to much time on you and lost interest so w/e.
---
just saw the forum post as I logged in to cry about it lol
---
This seens to be a bug and it's affecting a lot of bosses, even world bosses. 
---
Hell, even dead bosses. I did a TT run today and i still couldn't properly use my ground target skill on top of where the portal on amber wurm spawns (it's where his body is on first phase).
---
Obviously this is super irritating but it is worth mentioning that there's literally no use in the game now (and probably ever since they'll most likely invent another "Legendary X" token for future raids) for more than 150 Legendary Divinations. I feel like them initiating this "you can turn them into LI (which are more useful because you can always make more armour)" thing is admitting that they kinda fucked up and had no idea what they could use all the divinations for (I mean they literally let you gain more LD than you'd ever need) once  they realised it was just gonna be just one ring and an aurora clone at that.
---
Is the far left one an actual miniature, and not an effect like the tonics?
---
Yup! buying trophy crates. Great way to get mats imo
---
*Daaaaaaamn* I get the frustration now, thanks
---
Happened to us, when the sacrificed player in CM gg'ed while still up.
---
Don't know if it's reproducible
---
Yep. I'll \*take\* Grace Period if nothing else. But nope, we had \*\*\*official word\*\*\* that there was no time limit. I \*expect\* both options permanently.
---
Ah nice ty.
---
tbf, I don't want GW2 to be anything like FFXIV. Still, better content would be nice.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
My opinion is that they should hold off on working on wing 8 for now and properly implement good CMs/CM rewards for the existing raids. 7 raid wings could actually be a lot of content if done right.
---
Would that be like if the GW2 data included Bounties or something? lol
---
Wait longer and ask for 5 more ppl, 10 is already enough for the boss if you all focus all dps on him instead of those stupid cells.
---
Do you think it’s fun to play a game if you can melt a boss in one second? That’s not a game.
---
Don’t just complain.
---
Yep, this is my opinion on it as well. Aurora and Vision, its alright if they're identical and stack together. Accessory + Accessory and Ring + Ring imo. I do think Rings should have a different effect (Coalescence floating above your head for example).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-kSAaQ3-QA qadim
---
LOL, ESO
---
Yeah, that's what I've started doing, and it's been super lucrative.  Did a full run of the world bosses earlier today, sans TT, and made around 17 gold after TP fees. It's not Silverwastes or Dragonfall-tier, but it's pretty darn good for something so chill and mindless.
---
I sadly have not been very active for the past few months but would guess Vabbi is still going strong. 
---
Other than that I think guilds just love to transfer to matchup servers for easy fun, causing mass transfers from whoever wants easy wins.
---
If there is a train that doesn't fit on rail tracks.  That is absolutely someones fault.  Someone designed a train incorrectly, or someone else didn't standardize their railways.
---
Again, in the context of this legendary trinket, it doesn't matter how hard it is to code.  Not being able to dye the aura or turn it off is shitty.  Anet's difficulties isn't going to suddenly make people happy. 
---
Additionally, I find it hard to believe Anet couldn't at least find a middle ground.  For example, perhaps it is too difficult to fully incorporate the trinket's into the wardrobe system.  However, you could have a vendor that allows you to exchange the trinket for free for another trinket identical in every way but with a different color.  Anet could then make 8 or so colors available.  We have even seen Anet do things like this, for example crafted ascended weapons have several colors available that are all technically different skins.
---
Of course, but there is more FPS to be had and more multitasking ability to gain by upgrading too :)
---
This is fantastic. I copied this to r/elderscrollsonline sub if that is okay. Genuinely I love this kinda data and the visualization of the data
---
Ah right duh... my mind got mixed up there, my bad :)

---
My charr's left eye does that too.
---
Ah, i guess that's one way of putting it. I had thought better just meant better stats.
---
Is there another achievement with the karma reward? Or do you get the maximum AP already before the event is over?
---
That pet name. Wow.
---
It's worse than that.  We can make as many sets of legendary armor as we want.  As best I can see, we only have 1 single ring we can make.  There is no long term sink for LD.  Talk about under developed.
---
To be honest. I am still not happy about this. 
---
"The team is now looking into temporarily bringing back this conversion option via the vendor."
---
what happened to "This is not a limited time exchange. It will exist until you decide to utilize the exchange 168 times." ???
---
there are probably thousands of people that assumed they have all the time in the world to exchange their shit and just do W1-W4 raids to get more LD. Now suddenly we get the big ol' **EFF YOU** Bitchslap? Why arenanet?
---
I mean... I don't really care. I can get into raiding and farm the few LD I need to get the ring. But this is still just a dick move.
---
Yes! I purposely made my scourge this pretty pretty princess in white and pink. All I saw were brooding green characters and I wanted to look like a walking cupcake.
---
I didn't "just complain" I offered a solution. Not sure where you think 5 more people are just supposed to appear from. I never wanted the boss to be melted in one second, I just want the entire event nerfed.
---
Not a bad idea though
---
If you read the post, that's want I've been doing, I even try to time so that when lots of people are on the map for Dopple there's a higher chance they might come for Deadhouse.
---
While you are at it, it might be advantageous to put a real calendar comparison rather than just releases. I know its easier to compile based upon the releases, but that jars content in favor of more frequent patches over passage of time.
---
I just want the event scaled down considering its \*Mandatory\* I'd hope they'd at least take into account.  
---
People need to complete this for Griffin.  
---
A majority of players have griffin.  
---
A majority of players now have \*no\* reason to do the event.
---
I feel like this would help, the event has a very small timer. You have to beat him before Erra(?) gets awakened.
---
Weaver has higher maximum DPS, but dragonhunter is a lot more reliable and still has good DPS (I just finished setting up dragonhunter dps today and hopped into the training area. Got to 30k DPS in a couple of minutes (during the burst)
---
SC benchmarks are near perfect rotation execution on a golem
---
[](/twiheehee) Necros get Wells not Traps.
---
Have you watched the 500+ box opening videos? not a single hit, thats fairly terrible odds, and given that most players won't hit nearly 1/3rd of that, it seems like its just there as a metric game to them across the board once again.
---
So you're a weeb is what you're trying to say.

Repetition is not a continuation.

Referencing events is not a continuation. The Key of Ahdashim has Goren's grave. Does that make it a continuation of Goren's little side quest about Shiny? No.
---
&gt; Yes I raid. I'm sitting on almost 1700 LIs/LDs with lots of pretty titles. Thank you for your concern. 
---
I'm sitting on 1/1000th of that, yet I seem to know more than enough of the raid story to know that there is nothing in the raids that gives an upper hand in understanding the main story.
---
It gives more lore for the world, and the overarching White Mantle situation, yes, but not everything about the White Mantle is part of LS3. Otherwise you might as well complain that 1 of 15 paths and a dungeon is required to have played through to understand LS3 (again: it's not).
---
This is really good! Art-wise and Meme-wise
---
WoW's aesthetic is part of the reason I can't stand to play that game anymore. It is, and has always been, super ugly to me. GW2 is beautiful... but I agree, WoW runs better for far more people.
---
This whole conversion idea was a mistake from the start. They shouldn't have gived the opportunity to exchange 168 LI to LD in the first place, unless they had a way to confirm that these LI were awarded for w5 kills (they clearly didn't).  But I guess they were afraid of some kind of backlash or something. OK.
---
Skip forward to w7 release. The current maximum amount of LD is either 444 or 448 (I don't remember if I postponed w5 clear to tuesday+ to get LD frim it's bosses). Even without converted ones this is almost twice as much as needed for the ring. And you can only make one ring, so as for now extra LD are useless. Would it be a problem for any half-dedicated (literally) raider to get 150 LD out of 276 possible? No. 
---
So who is complaining then? People who farmed their LI on escorts and such and didn't even bother to convert them in LD, despite      being warned      multiple times     in advance      that ring is coming with w7 release. And now, when the new shiny thing is dangling before them, they suddenly need in NAO!111 (as per usual).  This could have been a nice incentive to play a new raid (which is piss-easy) and maybe get into harder w6/w5 for more LD per week. But instead a-net yet again bends for them. 
---
GG a-net. This Is Why We Can't Have Good Things, volume 34.
---
It may be less than 40 gold now since price of mats have gone down. But even then, 40 gold is cheaper than if you use mithril ingots (would have cost more than 60 gold)
---
If they belong together they should be part of a collection series where you unlock one and work towards another but, your investment in the first is later used in the second. Let’s be honest, with build templates and the ease and low cost of ascended Legendaries are mostly there for aesthetics.
---
I agree and like I said I don’t begrudge the bonus but, that’s just it, it should be a bonus not a replacement.
---
I'll be honest, I'm disappointed that the **raid** legendary is a requirement for open PvE legendary effects (and vice versa) when there's been so many complaints. At this point, I feel like another backpack would have been better for the second set of raids instead of a singular ring. Or better yet, two rings.
---
I'd rather that the accessories be their own three effects, and rings have their own three effects. Basically having it like this:
---
* Aurora: 1 effect; Vision: 1 effect; Aurora + Vision: new effect
---
* Coalescence: 1 effect; 2nd ring: 1 effect; Coalescence + 2nd ring: new effect
---
Rather than having all five trinkets having the same tiering effect. That way if one of the upcoming effects are what players like, they don't have to make four or five legendaries to get it, but only one or two. And with a top of 3 auras, it wouldn't be so insane either.
---
Though perhaps giving the second set of raids a non-trinket would have been better. Could have added the third tier to a LS2 legendary trinket. But I guess it's too late for all that now.
---
Yeah that's not far enough into the game. That's one fault I'll say about its rotation/skill system. Is if you aren't to 40 at least, things tend to be much slower and simpler. Cause outside the rotation itself, you also got positionals that let you do more damage. 
---
**Example:** 
---
    Heavy Thrust (flank), Impulse Drive, Disembowel, Chaos Thrust (rear), Wheeling Thrust (rear), Fang and Claw (flank), True Thrust, Vorpal Thrust, Full Thrust, Fang and Claw (flank), Wheeling Thrust (rear)

[removed]
---
It was always limited to the maximum amount of LI obtainable from W5 prior to the change over to LD. ANet had promised that it was not a time-limited exchange option for people who qualified, and since LD was *literally 100% completely useless* until this current patch, many people just sat on the exchange since it offered them more options to keep their LI as LI for the time being. I personally never acted on the exchange because LD was worthless, but I have enough LD that it wouldn't matter even if I had the gold to splurge on an annoyingly shiny ring.
---
Suddenly ANet gives LD an actual purpose and removes the LI to LD exchange at the same time.
---
The situation is a lot more nuanced than how you're describing it.
---
I work in IT, the attitude of "you need to fulfill my wishes because your job is to service me" is counterproductive. It's like going to a cop and saying "I pay your wages, do my bidding". It absolutely is something that happens, but it also doesn't help the situation in any way.
---
To put it more bluntly, just because there is a janitor doesn't mean you should leave your trash on the ground.
---
Fuck arenaNet
---
Oh cool I've never realised you could do that. Thanks
---
Coolio I can live with this. Thank you :)
---
Warned about what? They told us we could convert a specific  amount of LI to LD with no time limit on it. That’s literally what they said so everyone assumed that whatever was needed for the ring or any other thing could used for LD could be done. They never gave us specific numbers so those of us that waited to see what they were were screwed over. And the reverse exchange makes it even laughable because you could literally exchange 168 LI or whatever to LDs and after the patch convert 18 LD back to LI with no penalty. And that’s what makes this laughable. Also they never said the ring was coming with wing 7 and that the vendor exchange was going away that’s why they’re fixing the situation because they know they fucked up. We all assumed the ring was coming sure but let’s not make things up. There’s no mention of it even in the press release or the patch notes.
---
Ok but where is the actual screenshot?
---
i feel like i see more necro's trying to be the  contrarian than necro's fitting the stereotype.

---
Bonus event around Dungeons would be awesome!
---
I'm not sure why people aren't able to see it by now after companies have been using this tactic for decades, and not just in the gaming market. "Loss leaders" is another tactic that's similar in exploiting the, "well, while I'm here" mentality of spending extra since you're already in the store and you have to walk by it anyway to get to what you came in to buy.

I once used my xera portal device to portal a random guy to a mastery point in TD.
---
Why? Idk, but he was happy after it I assumed
---
Have you done it yet? If you're NA server I can jump on now and help, let me know.
---
Now I'm tempted to do this next time I go key farming. (My level 80 necro is a charr, I don't think she can pull off the magical girl look...)
---
My necro doesn't fit either of these molds. I'm now confused as to what I should be doing with my life.
---
Thanks
---
I think it might be referencing crafting it. Its thr only leggy I've started working towards so idk
---
My necro looks like an army guy
---
No can do, my jimmies are rustled and the post is gone. I'm sorry.
---
Is there a link to how to do this?
---
My necro is also one of those pink ones. I originally had her in a different colour scheme but I ended up getting the pink Valentine's wings so I had to switch to matching colours. [Here](https://imgur.com/a/05oiZ9F) she is in all her pink glory.
---
It was a CM raid, I didn't know it at first but the commander let me join. But then later kicked me because he thought "I didn't know that we would get this far" and then kicked me and found a replacement.
---
but that's an air djinn
---
What role? Were you performing?
---
Still a dick move, but maybe the comm was just getting frustrated and cared more about that slight gear advantage than what you felt.
---
If he only kicked you because of the gear even tho you pulled decent numbers he’s a shit commander. If you pulled shit numbers you don’t need new gear, you need to go to the golem. Half of my raiding characters are exotic, the difference between exotic and ascended really only makes the difference in speed clears, not in normal clears and especially not in pug clears. He was an asshole and sometimes that’s how commanders are, it’s part of the raiding experience sadly :D
---
I don't think that conversion was ever intended this way. It was mean to give "back" the divinations when they introduced them because W5 used to drop LI's.
---
I was the Pylon anchor and I was doing a pretty good job with the help of a tempest getting the orb for me. She was really helpful.
---
Because, even for a moment, it makes other happy.
---
This is honestly one of the most nonsensical decision they made. Raiders cant show off that they have coalescence unless they do hundreds of hours of open world. Open worlders are locked behind the raid barrier. Not to mention the ring itself requires a ton of open world despite being a raid trinket. They've somehow managed to target nobody as the ideal audience.
---
My Necro is guilty of the left. I do all lich with reaper hood, chaos gloves, and ad inf.
---
But I got 8 winter’s heart, the winter shoulders, and 8 snow diamond to go with the chilling theme.
---
Winter’s hearts and snow diamonds are really cool when stacked bc the effect they make isn’t very glowy, so it just looks like a fucking reaper bordered in snow (that you can still clearly see). When I go in reaper shroud and use shroud 2, you just see this massive stream of snow go at the target before chilling Nova and Executioner’s scythe drop.
---
I guess that's it. I would love to know actual friendly raiding groups that don't just kick players after hours and hours of work. If you have such a group yourself it would be great if I could join as I am a beginner and would probably not get into groups that actually cared.
---
Slimy yet satisfying!
---
I see you guys don’t do puns
---
Yeah I've gone 2 kills normal and CM with the buff on, nothing. Did you have people dead on your kill? I had people dead on both mine, maybe everyone needs to be alive at least.
---
Sadly, I don’t know any active friendly guild that does trainings. I can’t help you with that sorry. LFG would be your best shot, or if you can find someone who can help you in general.
---
Go join training groups, as everyone else does. Or look for guilds in the guild recruitment sub. And dont beg for gold.
---
You're necro is so scary ! A character who "drinks" life essence with these clothes... I really think she's dangerous. Pretty sure she should meet a psycholigist too. Does she want to kill her mother ? O.o Did she already killed her ?
---
Ps: really good drawing skills by the way !
---
I currently got my own training group to lead on mondays that is full already, but Tuesday and Wednesday we usually raid and Monday maybe some other people from my guild and we always take complete noobs along that stumbled into our guild, so feel free to shoot me a message in game: Bunz.5789

"necro is just a really late healer" -a friend of me

I did it to troll someone asking for tips to use a teleport on friend on them. So I started mesmer portalling for free, and kept copying their commander tag colors. I also set my bell instrument to autocast on the most annoying, highest note. Eventually they left the map.

It seems to be a common perspective with most people. I personally enjoyed most of the skyscale unlocking but there were something's that I didn't enjoy. I'm not big on collecting all the map currencies and some of the time gates were annoying but Anet has made some of them better. All in all I would do it again to unlock the skyscale if I had to.
---
That deeply disturbs my CDO.
---
misleading title
---
I guess you could say Asurans drew the SHORT straw.
---
Gw2 has custom exchange so leftovers are no big deal. But op said that there is no bonus if you buy for higher price. That's a problem?
---
This shit is the worst thing and that is what I call predatory. The pressure to buy more 3.5k gems for 35eur is better than 800 gems for 10eur, although I needed only 800, I will buy 3,5k just to be prepared for next days. And look! I saved! 
---
Stupid people don't realize they didn't save a shit but they SPENT the money. 
---
Even the stupid shops. I buy the 2l Coca Cola because 0,5l is almost the same price. GJ you amazing person! Now you paid 30 cents more just because you think it is the best deal! 
---
It is just 30 cents you say? Let' s look into Shopping car. Ouch lays family pack.. 6pack of beer.. 2kg of fries.. I think the price is adding up.
---
You just been screwed by companies that make smaller products for you to buy the bigger ones. 
---
You think that this is some common knowledge and then.. 
---
And then you read how having same gems/money ratio is bad.

EU here, it’s still at 50%. Don’t know if NA has a separate bar. Maybe they stall it intentionally so everyone can grab it...

How will I know if its happy and can feed it?
---
No. How would you justify using skimmer on land? I like my skimmer new hummingbird skin. When I am not in a hurry, I use that mount, cause it looks frikin cool!
---
What's worse is I need to make a full ascended set for it because there's no way I'm running exotics like a fuckass.
---
Of course it's a hyperbole, for goodness sake, but people seem to be a little bit too blunt.
---
Raid rewards were always prestigious, and when it comes to prestige, it's definitely no about quantity. also, yes, while LD directly are used for ring only, there is a reason why they can be converted now.
---
Small thing to be sad about so no big deal. It's not like missing the whole living story episode.
---
And to be honest I am more angry about working atm and not being able to play than missing achievement.
---
Just as you need to buy HoT to get downed by Pocket Raptors

Unfortunately, there's nothing that really affects this to a degree that people want.

Have you even read my comment? The boxes are not main reward of this world event. It's the skins you get access to. It's not ANet fault that some idiots thought that boxes are going to be valuable enough to pay 3+ gold for them.

What does difficulty have to do with anything? A raid is a raid
---
No solution for *actually seeing the boss* over spell effects but if hardware strain is the issue consider more aggressive player culling:
---
    Character Model Limit
---
and
---
    Character Model Quality
---
in Graphics-&gt;Advanced really affect performance without sacrificing ambient visuals. The "Limit" is simple, effective and won't degrade those characters who *do* render so that should be your first stop if the game starts chugging in a zerg. Note you need to set it to Low or Medium (or higher) in raids or some ally-centered mechanics won't render properly.
---
These are like the two most common types of characters, necro or otherwise
---
Not sure why it's downvoted, the LI -&gt; LD was never intended as a mean for people to get the PoF raid legendary by farming HoT raids.
---
I don't understand why people feel so entitled to a legendary from a content they're not really into anyways.
---
I don't think there are many people who:
---
1) cleared w5, w7 and qadim 1. (required for the collection)
---
2) has less than 150 LD
---
3) want the ring immediately
---
4) yet can't farm PoF raids to finish their LDs.
---
5) feel entitled to the PoF raids ultimate reward.
---
6) finished their legendary armor(s).

Technically I don't have 44 characters. I have 44 characters I play on my main account. I have storage characters as well, and alt accounts that I'm not really counting. I've finished season 3 for example on 30 characters, including story and zone. I've completed every zone and story in the game on 13 characters and working on 14.

I also have 23 legendary weapons, 2 legendary back pieces, and a legendary trinket (soon to be 2).  And I've got over 36k achievement points (almost 36,500.

Yeah, mate, not a typo. lol
---
Achievement Points
---
Coming soon Minions Skin at Gemstore.
---
shouldn't have destroyed like 20 stacks of auric dust then, huh? 
---
Not to mention the countless stacks of Bloodstone Dust/Dragonite Ore/Empyreal fragments, wouldn't be surprised if i've destroyed like a few hundred stacks of those combined by now, guess I should have wasted the bag space all those years,
---
... just to get some crappy grab bags that bait people into thinking they can get something of value in there, while the chance of dying from a heart attack and simultaneously getting a precursor from the included UNIDGears while opening those grab bags is probably much higher.
---
When is anet going to stop with this ridiculousness? 
---
"oh look we make fun community events where you can get super nice cosmetic infusions but actually not because the chance is so ridiculous that in the past events no one has actually gotten one" 
---
Is this the standard now? Aren't BL Chests enough of a bait in one game already?
---
Do we always need this fucking "super rare" tab in these shitty events to make it even more obvious that the devs are hell trash who only know the literally worst way to make content(RNG)? I mean holy shit Step your game up for fuk sake, if you are using these events for experimental Purposes (which I assume you are), then I hope you fucking know its not Good, because 99.9% of the people doing it are getting extremely baited. I am really sad so many people fall for it, giving the Devs the wrong idea of doing something right. I'm not saying this because I didn't get something, in fact I haven't participated in this madness at all because everyone who went through 6th grade math class should realise they aint gon get jack shyt even if they spam this for 10 years straight. Oh my god this game is going downhill, I wish they didnt go this route n fkin kept those infusions where they belong without much attention. What a fking mess.
---
TLDR: RNG to a certain degree might be okay but Anet is pushing this waaaay past the point where it could be considered good game design at all just to bait people n push their imaginary numbers for their shitty events. 
---
SMH really
---
Just by eye the slope (i.e. the *rate* of new releases) looks pretty much the same once you discard FFXIV Alliance Raids. I don't know about ESO but in my opinion the GW2 graph should start at t=0 for HoT's release date (or maybe the earliest raid promo) regardless because the base game was never intended to have raids in the first place.
---
Then again the graph for *dungeon* releases probably looks a lot more depressing...
---
Why? is that no what normal necros do?
---
Thanks guys.. Too bad then. Back to Scourge Necro I guess. Reaper was fun
---
I'm not worried about bogging down the gfx card (1080Ti) just about the visual clarity during big fights..  
---
I wish we could get a solid 60+ fps during big boss fights oh well
---
Yes it's WAY too much to ask for. What do you want next? Crafting stations? Here's the thing, anet wants people to have a reason to go back to cities. If literally every map had these services then there would be no reason to go to them and most would have zero activity unless it's festival time like SAB in Rata Sum. Even though a decent fraction of the player base have vip passes, the cities are still full of people without them! 
---
Bank I can only barely understand. Maybe you can't deposit mats anymore and want to withdraw the full stack to sell but why the hell do you even need to buy anything while farming in Dragonfall?
---
Don't want to sound like a dick but you haven't even justified your request and I don't think you could even if you tried to.
---
I mean just let people chose  what ever goal they want to progress after their weekly clear, is so in the line with gw2 philosophy
---
A cute innocent looking magical girl going around raising the dead is more terrifying IMHO...
---
Anet shoots self in foot because of needlessly poor communication. Sounds about par for the course.
---
I don’t think you understand what entitlement means. 
---
Players asked Anet specifically if the LI to LD was temporary. It was very specifically clarified that it is a permanent conversion up to 168. The amount  of LD you could have acquired if it had dropped with W5 upon W5’s release. The players still worked for it, they would just be converting because LD didn’t get pushed out at the same time.
---
If Anet had communicated, this wouldn’t be an issue but they tried to pull a fast one on the players and once again it backfired. They didn’t even bother to put the reverse LD to LI conversion in the notes.
---
10-15 weeks of farming for a SINGLE accessory. It costs as much as an entire legendary set in currency for a single item.  What does this artificial time gate do? How does this create good faith to the playerbase? 
---
Please, tell me why you have an issue with players being able to use something they were told by the devs that they could? They already worked for it.
---
I mean would you be okay if your boss gave you 20 days of vacation. You wait until your schedule is clear and plan your vacation around those 20 days you confirmed you had. You go tell your boss and then he comes back and says, “Actually, you only get 10 days of vacation, I was going to get around to telling you but I forgot, but it’s okay, be patient you can accrue more days in the future.”
---
Would you be okay with that?
---
#lifegoals

I change my necro’s theme every now and then. My fallback is mostly feathered vestment pieces with different gloves and shoulders (don’t recall the names now) with the glowing horns and dragon wing backpack. My colours are green, gold and something like stone because it matches Xiuquatl. 
---
My support scourge has a firey theme - shoulders and gloves from hellfire, dry bones and primitive mix and match with IG-6417 backpack and glowing horns headpiece. 
---
Currently her cdps set is rocking a hippy look - snapdragon and orchid cultural pieces with the birthday sylvari backpack and glints gaze headpiece. Lots of blue, green and gold. I kept Xiuquatl as it is because the green footfalls go nicely with the hippy look. 
---
She has a pdps set as well that’s purple and black, I think carapace set. Pretty and girly. But I don’t really play pdps so it’s collecting dust in my bank. 
---
I’m starting to run out of transmute charges because I’ve been hopping between my alts trying to decide what to play and I muck about with their looks too much. :’D
---
&gt; Because people use that setting to reduce the strain on their machines and increase frame rates.
---
Yes, but at the same time I would assume that this does what it says: reducing the quality but still showing everything. I do agree that such "optional" stuff would also help here, but it should be a separate setting. Otherwise how would I be able to see them at all on a low-quality setting?
---
And another question, is there any way to see on the reports on  [https://dps.report/](https://dps.report/)  the quantity of strips out?
---
You want a cool looking mount which is a dragon but you don't want to work hard for it. What can I even say...
---
Sandswept Isles! The Specimen Chamber pre will give you houndreds of mobs. You can make 30k Karma in those 5 minutes of the event with T3 Karmic Retribution.
---
Would be cooler anyways if there was no money involved at all. Everyone can just use real money to get everything with the exchange from gems to gold, so I barely have respect for anyone with nice stuff. This really disappoints me (just startet to play a while ago) since it's really a great game and I like in games like this, when you look at a player and you know if he's very experienced or not.
---
I am the same. I like helping, sure. But tge silver/gold tips some players give, is nice too xD.
---
just buy gem codes, they don't just come in 2000's or 4000's but they're also cheaper than the ingame prices most of the time. Problem solved.
---
Finally we have to work a little and not get it for free when the patch drops. If you don't like it you don't have to
---
How do you think mount skins work?
---
lol what.
---
Lol idk i’m just scrolling through fp
---
That's a stretch.

[Something like this is what is expected of an Elementalist.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8igthZdAPg)  
---
https://snowcrows.com/raids/builds/elementalist/weaver/sword/
---
You need to mirror the stats and practice a competent rotation that scales in effectiveness with boons.  The reason you were given a boss specific role is because they probably saw your mediocre DPS via ArcDPS and realized, "Hey this guy isn't running a good build," -- (real time) statistics don't lie -- and stuck you where they thought you would be most useful to them.  
---
The problem is you weren't doing a normal raid.  You were doing a Challenge Mote -- completely out of your depth.  You may have understood the mechanics well enough, but the truth is that DPS is a core mechanic of GW2, and without being practiced and running a proper build you're liability in normal raids let alone challenge motes.  They aren't "toxic elitsts" for kicking you.  
---
You came unprepared and it sounds like they were pretty generous with their time.  Make no mistake here.  I've played with people that do sub-par DPS -- everyone has -- and it's one thing when, objectively speaking, you're getting carried and another entirely when someone is inexperienced, unprepared and lacks the ability to reflect on their play relative to others.  
---
I'd suggest installing ArcDPS and playing the game for a while.  You'll see raiders in the open world occasionally in squads.  They'll be doing double, triple, sometimes even quadrouple the DPS of casual players.  It might look something like 20k+, 15k 10k and then the bell curve shifts down towards the lower thresholds where the majority of people, like you, are doing 3-5k DPS or less.  The content you were doing is designed for people that care about their builds and individual gameplay and want to push it to the next level.    
---
You don't need full ascended to raid, but you do need exotic armor ascended weapons/trinkets (ideally), and the ability to survive with minimal survivability gear -- modern builds seldom run toughness except in support roles as it sometimes interferes with aggro.  It's frustrating feeling like you did nothing wrong, but the truth is, by your own admission you're clearly unprepared for the normal raid let alone something like this...  Surviving and understanding mechanics is a baseline expectation not to be confused with thriving.
---
You have one quite scarring Necromancer... its almost as if you try to mutilate the very souls of those around you...
---
&gt; This isn't even to mention that very few people I know actually like the 3-trinket look, or the fact that coalescence costs so much more than the other 2 trinkets to make in terms ... of gold
---
That is actually wrong, believed that as well for a short time before I checked. Right now Aurora is slightly below 1.5k, Vision is around 1.6k, and Coalescence is atm around 1.7k gold if you do not consider the Balls of Dark Energy.
---
Yup, people often fail to understand that altruistic people are egoistic people that takes pleasure in helping others
---
My point exactly
---
The only thing we're still missing for the perfect look is a cat tail backpack :3
---
I think they're fine as it is. I don't think they deserve any more dev time. Could they be better? Yes. Should they spend more time on them? No.
---
Make ticket, you might get them converted
---
My Necro is doing a [Rihanna](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/222312290073051138/575625294686453790/unknown.png) cosplay 🤔
---
Plays during wow vanilla. Takes a break. Comes back in battle for azeroth and makes a rant because everyone else got cool stuff and you don't *thinkingemoji*
---
And she's absolutely valid all the same
---
Trinkets have more stats than most items. Swapping all your trinkets isnt a minor change. Its changing about half your base stats from gear.
---
Full trinkets and backpack isnt "some" crit. Full zerk armor gives about 50% base crit. Removing the trinkets leaves you with 28%. A pretty big amount. You also lose a huge amount of fero.
---
Take a reasonable staff weaver spec. Full zerk does 2% more damage than zerk with marauders trinkets. That's great. You trade this for 20% hp over zerk. Abit of damage for a big chunk of hp. Good stuff, wonder why its M E T A.
---
Take your option of full soldier trinkets. Zerk does 36% more damage than your suggestion. Marauders does 33% more than your suggestion. This gets worse if you get better at the game and get better buff uptime. You gain some hp, but the cost is HUGE compared to simply using marauders. Wonder why it's off meta?! The losses are this big because your stat distribution is terrible.
---
Getting a balanced build requires you to understand how meta functions and what you're doing. Most off meta geniuses dont. They simply do random stuff then defend it with excuses because hurdur I'm different and special and allergic to math.
---
The wvw meta sites do and always have recommended builds other than full zerk for power, and same for condi with viper. Those are the survivable options. So you know what the options are. If you want me to say soldiers is almost as good alternative, sorry it's not. Truthfully soldiers mixed with berserker is almost ALWAYS garbage. Its that simple.
---
As usual the same is true for condi and heal builds.
---
Well for me if I'm already up there may as well give people a port, I mean it doesn't really take anything extra from me to do it.
---
It's because they want more money. The skyscale is 2000 exactly for that you reason. Gotta buy a bigger pack.
---
Now you got leftover gems. But not enough to get another shiny thing. You are thuss incentivised to dump more money on gems since "you already got em right, might as well".
---
It's an underhanded trick to get more money.
---
If i am honest, i wasn’t going to get this mount at all. However, it is required for the legendary earring, so I did it. Was it fun and worth it? For me personally, not at all. I don’t even like that mount. But since it was required for the new legendary earring, then i sucked it up and did it.
---
Pretty much. I dont really understand why it needed to be removed in the first place. At some point, there wouldnt be anyone left who could still convert LI to LD and the problem would have solved itself. I was also waiting for the coalescence LD price tag before I would prolong my next armor progression in the firm belief that it wouldnt matter. My LD count is high enough by now already but I can see why there would be plenty of people being pissed now because they need to wait more weeks now only because they dont raid as frequently and wanted to make sure they need the exchange.
---
This meme is almost as old as GW2 is.
---
Buy 1600, convert the remaining 400 with gold.
---
So it must be dead, right?
---
&gt; Spending more money does not give a better rate of gems received.
---
I'm actually glad it's not like that. Feels like a cheap way to get people to buy more gems.
---
What have you done
---
Doesn't mean they can't buy the 1600 gem with money, and convert the rest.  Instead of converting all of it from gold.  While it might not be ideal.. its an option for those that don't want to over spend, if they have a little bit of gold to convert.
---
You have to kill wind djinn first, then earth.
---
In a similar vein of "information not everyone might know yet", on the earth boss the determination of who gets targeted by the 5 pillars is based on proximity to the boss herself, the 5 people furthest away get targeted.
---
I see no problem with your screenshots.
---
Its 3 PM on a weekday. Fractals are easy enough to do with a random pickup group, and you only need 4 others.
---
For raids you need 9 others. Most (semi) dedicated players raid in the evening where the pool of players to pick from is at its largest (other than maybe reset). So they do fractals earlier in the day, if they can.
---
The way to change this is to take the initiative. Start your own group, start your own guild, start your own discord server, or join any of the existing ones, and talk to people. It's an MMO, these players are other humans, with their own lives, their own schedule and their own goals. Talk to some of them and figure something out, that fits yours.
---
Im not sure why this comment was downvoted for stating basic truths of the game.  
---
Progression in gw2 is not vertical. 
---
If this thread is advocating for more traditional mmo gear proggression-  You can voice that opinion without downvoting or making passive aggressive comments.
---
Because I personally don't like doing JPs and when I do get through the pain to finish it, I wanna at least take the pain off others. :D
---
I'm one of those people, and I just don't enjoy w5 and w6 to clear them more often. I can farm the gold needed for the ring in a week, remaining LDs would take me 7 weeks if I do full clears on w5,6,7, which is not what would happen because it's fucking summer and I have better things to do than sit and grind content I hate, then feel burned out and disgusted with entire game by the time I'm done.
---
The ability to change the visuals of skills and summoned things for all the classes (even just the colors) would have me throwing money at Anet in a hurry - the character slots alone would probably keep them in business for another five years. XD
---
Yes, it's the first time ever, this is why i'm extremely disappointed and kinda angry i'm not gonna lie to you, it feels unfair.
---

---
So why even respond in the first place? You seem to be blaming the game and the community. 
---
You got baited to argue and you probably said something not allowed, hence a ban. 
---
You could have just ignored and blocked.
---
Yeah... bad choice if you want to use Druid staff 3 to heal people and charge to the boss. Or use CA skill 1-3 to heal your group and put them all on the boss or on a hand, where nobody are even able to stay.
---
I just really love PvP, what can i say ...
---
Most people complain they see abusive behavior, report it and nothing happens, which is why I ask. I'm extremely surprised this is the case, considering I've not heard a lot about people being banned for something soon after it happens. Usually it takes a long time.
---
Yo, I won't be devils advocate, but banter wasn't probably what happened. As long as you don't insult racially or tell people to kill themselves, it's extremely hard to get banned. Especially such a long temp ban.
---
Just block whoever you are arguing with and move on, it's basically the same you do in a MOBA. It's through a screen where anyone can type anything with almost no repercussions, so why take it serious?
---
Viper is less “half and half” and more “condi but maxing overall dps”. Even condi builds will hit with a decent amount of power damage, so you need power to increase that, and precision to crit cap. It’s also worth mentioning that a lot of condi related traits are tied to critting your enemy.
---
Right-click.  Block.  Move on.  It isn't worth arguing with people in competitive game modes.  Let them shout at a wall.  It'll frustrate them more than providing them with engagement.
---
Welcome to the internet where men are men, women are men and children are fbi agents
---
Well yeah, but in the 40-20% phase I hope you have enough cc because youre like 6 people at least that can cc at the same time. If you dont have enough for that I dont know man
---
Mesmer in a hood, reporting in.
---
As i said, shit happens, sometimes they get to you and i would start doing that if i received some kind of warning first ... i was caught off guard but i'd never ever say anything extreme.
---
So the whole gaming industry turns into a kindergarten just because you got (rightfully) banned for a week in one game?
---
Okay so do you want to be a the top of the list of people who have said "if GW2 doesn't x or y or both it doesn't have a future". Bloody hell GW2 must be in a time loop the amount of times its had no future.
---
You could always slot in 1 different rune onto one of your armor pieces, so you don’t get the 6th tune bonus
---
You should see mine, looks like the classiest carnival owner/riskiest friend to have ever.
---
"WvW" / "soon" - pick one
---
Maybe?!
---
PoF was only really about Balthazar trying to destroy Kralkatorrik and we stopping him the last cutscene after the epilogue was the transition to Season 4 and Season 4 was all about beating Kralkatorrik and establishing Aurene as his replacement. Those stories are completed.
---
But that doesn't mean there could be more stories in PoF related content.
---
We don't know what Season 5 holds, except for the snippet Kralkatorrik says in the fight there isn't really much to go on that could hint what will happen next.
---
And furthermore, we don't know how ArenaNet plans to tie season 5 to something. So far Season 3 was bound to HoT and Season 4 to PoF. We also know that there is no Expansion right now so Season 5 could be standalone and be something completely different.
---
I mean, currently we have no real threat, Primordus and Jormag are sleeping, Bubbles/Steve has not yet been revealed. But this could be established in the first episode or over the course of the season 5 which then leads to an expansion?!
---
We also have a lot of plots that are still open, Charr Homeland, the other Pale tree, re-discovery of Cantha, Origins of Mursaat and many more I can't even remember yet.
---
What we also have seen is that we can "deal" with an elder dragon in a Living world season and that we don't need an expansion format for that. So Maybe we go after Primordus, Jormag or Bubbles/steve in Season 5.
---
I'm challenging any game master to bring up my chat having racist insults or such, i would never do that, that's why i'm surprised too
---
&gt; I don't see a bright medium term future for GW2 if it's another year of living world with no raids, no elite specs, no big content dumps like an expansion.
---
plenty of people claimed this a year ago, too.
---
Then turn off map chat on don't act like a 6 year old.
---
(rightfully) huh ?, any proof or facts ?
---
What does count as raid for you then?
---
If its just how hard it is then every mmo can add more players to dungeons and give bosses more hp and attack, is it a raid then?
---
A raid doesnt need to be instanced. It can be a big boss spawn in the open world
---
You insult, you get banned. How is that unfair?
---
So words don't hurt, but i got a week ban for saying something back. Okay i guess.
---
Block. Report. You act like they were about to shoot at you in real life and you had to defend yourself.
---
one of the most fun JP's , the skritt tunnels make it a fun gamble too
---
Maybe turn off the map and wsp chat while playing PvP. You will still able to communitace with your group through group chat.
---
Sorry to say but It's not like they see if you are right or not before giving a ban. 
---
Insulting people in general is against ToS, and can get you banned if reported, that's a fact.
---
Doesn't matter if you start it or not.
---
And very useful in fractals.
---
Yeaaaah, it's keeping relevant content alive. With Necro. Who are AFK 25/8 on spots where mobs who drops it alive. But yeah. Totally keeping alive.
---
Just smile :)
---
These pages gets updated so fast after patch that it sometimes looks like an automated system :D thumbs up for all editers!
---
Well it's not like i was about to shoot them IRL as well and yet i'm the one who got suspended, your point of view doesn't make sense.
---
That's one of the more unsettling things I have seen in my life.
---
&gt; the goal is to get an idea of gamers feelings/reactions/behaviors .
---
The gaming industry is in a downwards spiral, because companies (and investors) get rediculously greedy and my reaction to it is to stick with the "good old games" and some very few exceptions of newer games.
---
I hate the direction in which the gaming industry is leaping (not just walking) to. I feel lucky, that I was a child in "the golden age of gaming". And I feel sad for the younger generations.
---
Ok, I give up. You don't get it. Good luck not getting banned again next week.
---
not really, no
---
Were they wrong considering that the focus on side projects and lack of expansion revenue led to NCSoft ordering layoffs? That didn't really seem like a bright moment for the company from my perspective.
---
Yeh im a woman playing all females too. I also like to joke that g.i.r.l = guy in real life. And that there are no girls on the internet😂 i've had some other women/girls get kinda upset in mapchat with it. Making them go, no but im rly a gurl. Cracks me up.
---
Looking at [the map](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/images/a/ac/Tyria_world_fan_map.jpg) it could really go in all directions. The Isles of Janthir are north of Kryta which is pretty much in the unending ocean. We don't know where Steve is so we could stumble upon him by doing some sort of mission for the shining blade exploring the Isles of Janthir.
---
Or we could go South of Istan to Cantha or even to the West to Arid and the Wetland.
---
My necro also uses Cobalt, the best budget skin in the game by far ahah
---
&gt; though I can't see it doing much of that since most of those low level new players are free to play and can't sell on the TP.
---
Considering the amount of topics on this subreddit by new players who just bought at least one expansion in the last couple of weeks/months, I think there a plenty of full new accounts running around.
---
&gt; Most of the low level materials is gotten from Silverwaste farmers, no?
---
I think at this point we have to differentiate about which low level mats we are talking, basic (wood, ore etc) for ascended gear or trophies (claws, bones etc) for legendary equipment because they have different faucets.
---
Basic mats have plenty of additional faucets from end game content, for example the unstable salvage items in lake doric or the leather etc. shipments bought with volatile magic from LS 4 maps.
---
I think Anet has done a fine job since PoF and even before that, introducing additional faucets for lower tier mats from end game content. There are plenty of containers that contain these mats.
---
Couldnt have said better..
---
&gt; There's a lot of pointless back-tracking and warming up to the Skyscale as if it's a household pet like a dog or a cat.
---
But it literally is... 
---
The point of the collection is to raise your own skyscale. if you say "it's like a pet", it's exactly what it supposed to be.
---
They might speak German as their first language... or then just autocorrect
---
&gt;no raids, no elite specs, no big content dumps like an expansion.
---
Why would they stop making raids?
---
We really don't need essentially 9 more classes added to the game, they should just make a base class with S5
---
Content dumps? Like PoF core maps? Looking forward to more of those! Hahahaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ye no
---
&gt;I thought I would treat this as an immersive, fun, native collection to earn my mount.
---
I thoroughly enjoyed doing my collection.
---
&gt; Coalescence (and Vision for that matter) were going to have distinctly different visual effect
---
For one, the icon for Aurora matches the visuals; Coalescence matches the 3rd tier effect, but Vision is, like, whaaa?..
---
They get tips I guess
---
Apparently, the end of season 4 was supposed to be the end of the game overall if NCSoft didn't intervene and put Arenanet back into developping the game. We know this from devs that got fired, so trust it as you wish, but that's why it all feels concluded. It was supposed to be the end.
---
While content delivery is better QA seems to be slacking.
---
What's the name of the staff?! It is so cute!
---
&gt; If you want the ring, do PoF raids. Having a limitless conversion from LD to LI deincentivizes HoT raids.
---
In this case, LD should have more use. Like, a full set of stat-swap trinkets without special effects, 25 LD each 50 for repeats. If they're ONLY for a single ring with an effect that many people don't want, then the LD-&gt;LI conversion is needed.
---
In regards to content delivery I haven't noticed any marked improvement. Content that was already in the pipeline to be released was the least likely to be affected by Anet losing a third of their staff. For instance, the layoffs were about four months ago but it takes about nine months to create a living story episode from start to release. Possibly closer to ten months or more considering how consistently recent episodes have been pushed back past their release windows. The full effect of losing talented individuals like Ben A, Josh Foreman or the many other skilled employees likely still remains to be seen.
---
Within a single game/franchise/publisher I would either simply go by their own terminology **or** if there is enough context expect the community to agree on a definition - for example raids in GW2 are 10man instanced PvE but no one here would call a 10man GW1 mission a raid.
---
Comparing across multiple IPs I would try to nip strawmanning and "no true Scotsman" in the bud and reexamine/rephrase the actual point of the discussion: fractal CMs are "challenging group content" while by others' accounts FFXIV Alliance Raids are not, on the other hand GW2 has **ZERO** 11+ participant instanced PvE content.
---
I am pretty sure the OP is intended as a response to complaints about GW2's raid releases being too few and too slow. So ask the complaining parties what their core interests actually are and apply those to the other games where possible. I doubt allowing fractals will work in GW2's favour but those who want to dps down a mechanics-heavy boss certainly *should* add Ensolyss and Arkk to the list instead of whining about Twisted Castle.
---
&gt; If its just how hard it is then every mmo can add more players to dungeons and give bosses more hp and attack, is it a raid then?
---
This for example. What exactly do you believe distinguishes dungeons/fractals from raids in GW2 other than being 10man? (and dungeons suffering from power creep, which would not be the case if they still were actively supported by the balance team)
---
Personally the only defining features are being 10man and ANet explicitly calling them "raids". Cut in half the headcount requirements (especially on explicit mechanics like VG greens) and you could easily make the "raid" bosses fractal CMs. Add more trash mobs and make the optional lore stuff part of the clear itself and you basically get what I would expect from a post-expansion dungeon release.
---
Plus as others have said gear treadmills change the entire meaning and motivation behind "raids". If you define raids as "any group content providing BiS gear" then GW2's stats will blow almost everything out of the water.

Because sleep deprivation. Fixed now, thanks.
---
Yeah I know but even though it's so cheap it still looks really fitting and cool.
---
Please stop spreading misinformation. As others said, according to Jessica Price it was designed as though it *could be* the end of GW2 because they didn't have plans for how to continue the game after, yet. This is the same as saying "we wrote it so there wouldn't be a clear continuation" - which is how other things like the personal story ended.
---
It should be noted that during the Guild Chat 85, Tom Abernathy says something that contradicts JP's comments (basically saying they knew of S5 before the timeframe JP says they didn't know of anything). And JP has a history of bashing ArenaNet unprovoked since her firing.
---
It was **not** supposed to be the end.
---
There is a build called "Spectral Onslaught" on metabattle which I believe is the same as Hollts (perhaps some small differences exist, not sure) -  [https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper\_-\_Spectral\_Onslaught](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Spectral_Onslaught)  
---
I've tried both Hollts' build as well as "Vampiric Greatsword" ([https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper\_-\_Vampiric\_Greatsword](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Reaper_-_Vampiric_Greatsword)) and I can say that the latter is much easier to play well with. Hollts' build, while probably having more potential is a bit squishy and therefore harder to execute. If you are new to pvp I would highly recommend the vampiric greatsword build to start off with, as your skill and knowledge progresses you can switch to the spectral onslaught build.
---
Think most just assume it'll be a raid every 9 months - which will be cleared in 5-6 hours.
---
It's the final section of the jumping puzzle.

My account name is a female name and my character names are usually a random phrase or female pop culture icons. So people usually refer to me by my account name, as 'She'.

Then every time I swap to my very macho- looking Latino chronomancer, they are deeply confused at my identity.

Look at lfg &gt; Open World &gt; Squads &gt; RIBA (or at least VW)

Join the map, wait till they do full cycle. RIBA kills Vinewrath 24/7
---
Took the words out of my mouth for that arguement.
---
Because Digital River does transactions in those fixed amounts.
---
The same reason why I can't charge my buss pass with any amount other than multiples of 10.
---
Go to LFG, the squad section, join a "SW RIBA" farm, the squad will progress the map and kill Vinewrath.

I hope one day you learn to enjoy life.
---
of course they're not worth it, are you surprised? just like boss rush chests. only thing that made the meta event rush last week worth was that the chests dropped t3-4 materials, and quite a lot of them. your chance of getting an infusion is lower than getting hit by a car, i just got the AP and stopped donating after that
---
for ruining the fun of the jp from other ppl

I mean, I had a lot of fun with it, it had a lot of callbacks to the raising and bonding with Aurene.  The only part that was obnoxious was that tedium of the 4 days to feed ot.

Had to sleep, but it should only take about 2/3 times at mostl, it was a 0retty much go in the instance for less than 3 minutes for 4 (apparently  3 now since they upped how many tines you fed him) Iunno if I'm missing something you are or srent doing. Only thing I can think of, cycling through the toys [ Spamming 1 essentially) dumping the bucket of water on the Skyscale to clean the area (item that's right next to the nest)  throw the ball a few times at most (next to the nest once again) then you have the food unlocked (making sure you have the crafted or bought food in your bag, you need 12 overall, I just crafted them all first day)
---
Let's look at the raids team, for instance, it's my understanding that it was already quite a small team then it lost Ben A and another employee whose name I can't recall at the moment. Losing someone like Ben A is a huge consequence not just because you can no longer access his personal skillset but because if you intend to continue on with raids then you need new personnel who will need to be trained up for that role.
---
You're correct that companies have to deal with issues like this quite often, but it's a concern in this context considering how slow raid content was already shipping prior to the layoffs and the negative effect that had on the raiding community. When you have prominent raiding guilds leave the scene, the same guilds who do build benchmarking or publicly release clear strats, then that has a knock-on effect to raiding scene as a whole because they provide a valuable service. There are players who might have great mechanical skill, but they wouldn't know their way around effective buildcraft or are straight up terrible at progression. In addition, the higher end guilds need new blood coming into their ranks to counter-act natural attrition. So if you have chunks of the raiding scene quitting or burning out because it's been nine months since they last got new content that's not going to lead to a healthy community.
---
So personnel changes in this context aren't likely to solve the issue in the short or medium term. The changes might even cause new problems due to the financial and temporal expense that turn-over and training bring with it and the way that will affect development time. Content delivery in this area of the game has already been affected but we likely won't see the full fallout from it until we're about six to twelve months down the road from now.
---
My necro is so shiny that it can be confused with a mesmer
---
That's how supply and demand works though. There are lots of max level players, so of course their drops are worth less. That's not an imperfect system, that's just an open economy. Lower level characters can't farm t4 fractals, or clear weekly raids.
---
Thanks- it took a while, but the goal was to make him look as indestructible as he is in game. As a Valkyrie reaper, that's a high bar!

Hence my original suggestion of a season pass. We really don't have a clue at this point. I'm getting tired of repeating myself here.

Fully unlock Reaper.

Ok so no big pro guild wars tournament recently

It's so pretty. Makes me a bit more motivated to actually get the skyscale now.

Does anyone know if you need to own all LWS4 episodes to even begin the Skyscale collections? We completed the Epilogue last night and I received the mail from Gorrik, but my friend did not. He doesn't own all the episodes, is that it?

It's a well known bug for now and isn't exclusive to raids, it's happening pretty much anywhere with a boss.

I'm not emotionally invested in Soldier's. It just seemed like a sensible and easy option.
---
So you advise against Soldier's and suggest that the WvW trinkets/back that I swap for some defence should be Marauder?
---
What would you suggest I use as my more defensive WvW trinkets for condi builds though?  Dire? Carrion? Something else?
---

---
4 of the mounts have 4 masteries, and one of them is a shared mastery that gives powers to the other mounts.   
---
The other 3 mounts with masteries have 3 masteries each and no shared powers.   
---
So I'd be nice if they gave new shared masteries to the mounts that have 3, and use them to improve other mounts in different ways.
---
For example, the Skyscale can do burning, so its mastery could add a DPS condition to the engage skills of the other mounts:
---
* Raptor, springer, bettle: Confusion 
---
* Skimmer: Poison.
---
* Jackal: Torment.
---
* Griffon and Warclaw: Bleeding.
---
* Skyscale already has burning.
---
Since this would reduce the Mastery Point leeway, they could also put a extra few mastery points in achievements people often have trouble completing, like Junundu Whisperer.
---
Wanna gift some gold so I can buy some gems so I can buy some character slots?  
---
I'm stuck at five, but I'd like to level another couple...
---
I think it's a cool idea, poorly implemented. First off, the collections you have to do at the start are just way too excessive. Why do we have to do three scavenger hunts, on the same map, back-to-back-to-back?  Surely one would have sufficed?  Why are there *so many* rifts to do at the end?  Why could that not just be a collection for AP and a mastery point that could be done after getting the mount, like the "backpacking" achievements?
---
I like the idea of raising the Skyscale like a pet, but I think they just went a little too hard on the collections, and crossed the line from fun into tedious.
---
\[T]/
---
What class / spec matters a lot. 
---
Defensive options for condi are trailblazer and dire for pure condi but neither are very good atm. Celestial viper or celestial grieving are also defensive mixes for "condi specs" with a power dps aspect.
---
Trailblazer or dire depends on howmuch you need condi dura. Celestial leverages hybrid stat spread and power dps versus pure condi tank. Viper and trailblazer or viper and dire mixes are almost always garbage, because the power and prec from viper is wasted when combined with pure defensive stats.
---
I'd say invest into trailblazer to combine with dire or full trailblazer and celestial trinkets to combine with viper. Those stats are most likely to be wvw relevant imo.
---
Okay that makes sense. I apologise for my previous post.
---
I don't know how they will solve this LI -&gt; LD removal though. My guess is there's 3 possibilities:
---
1. They are able to bring it back with no issues and people can exchange it exactly like before the patch.
---
2. Not bring it back because there may be issues with implementing it again thanks to spaghetti code.
---
3. They bring it back but with some kind of issue like everyone who was eligible last time can exchange the full 168 LI -&gt; LD again even if they exchanged some before thanks to spaghetti code. Maybe they just give everyone a free 168 LI -&gt; LD conversion option.
---
I've been portaling since early gw2.  The girlfriend had a potato PC and a REALLY shit connection.  So many JP were difficult for her to complete.  I do it so those who have potatoes or horrible lag can get those rewards as well.
---
Just stack in the *cardinal* directions.
---
I think they need to monetise the game more not less. GW2 is already doing revenue numbers similar to Aion despite probably havinga  much larger player base. Anet has higher operating costs than Aion too.
---
I think they should monetise the enxt season. Personally though I wouldn't pay for the living world myself, unless elite specs are included. Lots of people would though, and it is only similar to what ESO does with their DLC.
---
Free players are basically playing a trial for the full game, they already get a very generous amount of content for free.

Can also be distorted, or "leapt" over with Revenant Sword 5. I'm sure there are tons of other skills that work too.

---
I'm not interested in it personally but think the cost should be x y or z. Doesn't make sense to stop the survey.
---
Haha whine about it all you want, the devs have already embarked on this design path and there's nothing you can do about it
---
The what now
---
Friday morning at work, 10:20 EST.....I'll just go ahead and assume I missed out on this one as well.
---
Yeah I dunno, seems the easiest would be just reenable the LI -&gt; LD conversion as it was for a period of time with existing numbers accounted for, but yeah spaghetti code and who knows what they did taking it out lol
---
All you need to do is go to metabattle and see open world builds. There's also guide on gearing up.
---
If you don't know what to do, story is always a good way to go through new content.

It hasn't. I'm as clueless as you are.

It's like any invisible disruption in landscape = invisible "wall" for targeting. You can't even click on players from the side -- like they are behind invisible wall :(

The people: give us means to obtain items in our own ways. We don't like to be forced into game modes we hate. I only play wvw and if it wasn't for wvw I would not play this game. 
---
Anet: what's wvw?
---
It's still active - the bar is a little more than half full
---
There were layoffs all around the tech sector for a few months. It's not just ANet that suffered. The higher ups in the tech sector believed that there would be less profit in 2019 which lead to the mass layoffs

Thief is not even close to being a good class for this encounter, except maybe for clearing the adds with IP...if you're clearing them in the first place.

Doing hearts and map completion on different characters, is the right answer.

I've yet to see anyone actually use their Warclaw against a gate in WvW.  If it happens, it doesn't seem to happen often.
---
I often do stories to help out guildies, or with my wife for fun. I sometimes repeat them for achievements, which I like to get. Sometimes it takes a few tries to get an achievement, but if you do them on different characters through, you don't have to replay the same character. Most achievements you can get the first time through now.
---
I'm not the kind of guy who looks up guides, I like to figure stuff out, or find a way. Unless something is just ridiculous, I'm going to work through it myself.  It comes from a long history of being an adventure game player. 
---
It's also a way of farming currency, just as completing the zones is a way of farming currency and keys. 
---
Finally different characters have different challenges in getting through the story. It's sometimes harder on squishier characters and I have to adapt. I play every class and often different build of each class. Beating each boss with different skills and abilities helps me hone my skill over all. 
---
But like I said, I'm almost never alone when I do it. Someone needs help with an achievement, I bring a character that's never done it before, because why wouldn't I. I spend a disproportionate amount of my time helping friends and guldies get through content they're having trouble with.
---
All of those professions have some place in all game modes. Holo is good at pvp and pve, very versatile class, easy to get into. It's usually built with Power, tho, not condi (as far as i know). Deadeye can be good at pve and pvp as well, but in pve the rotations are unforgiving and being rooted in place is dangerous in this game. In pvp, thief is a  hard class to play, but can be very rewarding if you master it.
---
Firebrand is meta in all game modes. They are really powerfull in pvp and wvw as supports. In open world pve, any of the quickbrand builds from metabattle (can be Power or condi) are really strong. They deal High damage while giving good group support.
---
I cant comment on chrono stats because i don't play one, but note that chrono and firebrand support overlap a bit, they are not usually run together in endgame raids as far as i know. But that is only a concern for raids, really.
---
Why not? You could go all in on the "magical cat girl" aesthetic as a literal cat girl.
---
Yeah definitely seems like they've abandoned it, which is a shame! I remember a dev saying it was extra work that they had to find time to put in to update it.

I don't get it. How does your squad doing ppt bother them, can't they do what they want at same time? What did they want to do btw?

or giving it 3 dodges like in wvw and making the distance much better. making sniff skill a self-stealth for the mount and player. easily anet could make this mount the stealth mount

The Grenth hood, Primitive Shoulder piece and the rest Dry Bones is what mine is running. The skull shoulder looks better to me than the spiky bone plate.
---
In a raid, you shouldn't need to for most encounters - apart from Qadim kiter or somewhere you need big sustain without a healer.  
---
Open world/dungeons it's a huge amount of sustain/selfheal, assuming you are at crit cap and not poisoned (even poisoned it's decent).
---
Taking your time is fine, even if you do PoF raids once a month, you'll eventually get the LD's.
---
You don't have to get the ring "right now".
---
Any game, even fucking Fortnite, is always declared "dead" by some. Honestly, by now I consider someone proclaiming a game is dead, or dying, or will die if X or Y, to be one of the biggest red flags when discussing games.
---
Everyone gets these recipes unlocked even if they werent aroudn to participate right?
---
is this a loss reference ?
---
Reading your comment was optional.
---
sPvP/WvW players will tell you that all of that stuff is optional, apart from elite specs - which you can get with proofs.
---
But to which mastery tree? Would probably fit under PoF, but technically the mastery points should be in WvW since the mount is obtained there?
---
&gt; the other Pale tree
---
I think this one is fully done. The perfect occasion to touch on it was HoT, now that it's behind us I don't see Malyck's tree being a big thing.
---
Didn't like it, i really suffered some steps
---
It's not misleading though, you follow a tag you are implicitly agreeing to be subject to where the tag wants to go. Don't want to follow the tag...just...don't follow the tag. Or even better, if there's a comm doing PPT and you want fights throw up your own tag and get a group to go do fights, literally nothing stopping you.
---
Your expectations are not my obligation.

Perhaps the dev that updated it got laid off and forgot to pass it on to someone else? Feb 25th is in that time frame.

That's along the lines of what I was saying.

It's an infusion gamble. That should have been obvious

They don't want the responsibility or effort of tagging, so they demand the tag do what they want. Lazy demanding entitled people.
---
I got about 15g in 30min doing portals for an annoying JP for the Skyscale collection without asking for anything.
---
Unfortunately a lot of the flashing effects in melee range come from on hit effects (e.g. the splash effect of fireball) which for whatever reason seem to be scaled up on big targets and you cant hide them. Adding to this is all the visual vomit from melee players all being stacked on top of the target with giant backpieces and flashy legendary weapons that cannot be hidden.
---
I wrote that there is no reason to repeat AFTER you got the achievement points.
---
that the infusion drop is a gamble is clear. 
---
My question was only targeted on the exotics since some of them have some value around 20g. And if it would be reasonable to continuing the repeatable achievement and break even or have a minor loss. That's all.
---
\#DECEASED
---
No. Some people like it, some don't, but it's not "wrong."
---
According to the people trying to kill the mode with their elitism, yes. 
---
But fuck em, they are assholes. 
---
Recent ANet changes imply they really expect WvW to be the casual PvP with PvE elements mode and we clearly can't make them change it so you do you. 
---
For real PvP, also a joke with this balance, they have the PvP mode.
---
I don't think so, since Sylvari originated from Mordremoth it could be that the other pale tree was too and seeing and meeting other Sylvari free from him could be a very interesting story. They could even be a new villain since we killed their "master".
---
I think I'd wait a bit longer. Outside can be dangerous you know
---
i dont see the whole better loot part being different than other glyphs.
---
sure its replacing the gatherings for other items while the others  just add something on top if it.
---
in the end its still just more gold per gathering node.
---
that being said i dont like the whole convert part, especially since in some cases it ends up giving lower value. i would prefer it being changed to something like: gathering a tier x item gives a chance for a bonus tier x+1 item.
---
Where does [mine ](https://i.imgur.com/MYkdlx6.jpg)fit?
---
because informing everyone else every 10 min. what you're doing is a colossal waste of time? 
---
should commanders who do "tactical wvw" or whatever also inform everyone every 10 min. what they are doing?
---
The other cupid?
---
Playing the game is mandatory. Other than that, all is optional.
---
Also mandatory to see everyone's retina-bleeding glow and sparkle auras.
---
Yep, a lot of the other glyphs aren't great either. Imagine if ancient would was worth 10s again though? That's 15 extra gold each day for those who bought Alchemy.
---
It's not just t5&gt;6 that's in issue though, if the cooking rework happens, and niche cooking mats are suddenly valuable, is HUGELY problematic for any affected mats. Node farms suddenly have 2 resources instead of one, and there's no daily limit on gathering them.
---
Same here, which is odd because I feel like I've met more women who play when I've been exploring than men.

If the server crashes your account can get stuck for a few minutes and won't let you log in while some time out occurs. I suspect it's for making sure account data stays in sync across multiple servers.

If you do the math, it actually is worth taking
---
&gt; just that the next plot won't be a world-ending threat plot.
---
How do we know that? I didn't see that in any interviews or anything.
---
Bad example.
---
Here's a more accurate one:
---
You see an ice cream truck playing music, you go up wanting a Klondike bar, but the truck has 40 other types of ice cream it just doesn't have klondike bars.
---
You: REEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Your example would fit if we were talking you join a tag and he's just trolling people to see if they'll follow off a cliff and die (which some do and I would certainly call that misleading), but if the tag is leading in any capacity that fits how the mode is intended to be played you have no grounds for calling it misleading. We're talking about a tag going around capping and fighting over objectives, which is more accurately the intended gameplay, not the just blob v blob some people want.
---
I'm not even going to call those wanting BvB wrong for wanting that, capping the same towers over and over can get boring, I get that. But you don't get to join a tag and then tell the tag he's playing the game wrong because he isn't playing how you want.
---
You having bad assumptions and unreasonable expectations is, again, not my obligation.
---
Is the gate CC an engage skill? Or do you perform it while mounted?
---
Now that we have so many mounts, I wouldn't mind if they continued to work on them and we ended up with a sort of mounted combat situation where you can either use your engage skill and fight on your own, or stay on your mount and use the mount's combat skills until the mount takes too much damage.
---
Ton of work, never going to happen, but it would be interesting imo.
---
What? This was in the patch notes when w6 came out. Pay attention bro
---
From my understanding, your point is all the more reason to not get rid of it. Only a few people could use it, what's the harm in letting those few keep the option if they want? Moreover, ANet's push to get people into newer raids is incredibly dumb. They should be encouraging old raid clears, not punishing people for doing them. I'm sick of this feeling like they're cranking out disposable content. I want to go back to the old wings and keep feeling like they'll be rewarding.
---
From a PvE perspective:
---
Holosmith is great for DPS in all PvE content (both power and condi builds are strong), plus it has a lot of CCs. The power build has decent burst damage, not as strong a burst as Dragonhunter, but respectable enough. The condi build is more difficult to play, but deals slightly better DPS on bosses who can't be CC'd / don't have a burn phase. Run Berserker's stats for power, Viper's for condi.
---
Rifle Deadeye is pretty niche, but also very powerful. When you get the chance to stand miles away and pew pew, it does the best damage of anything in the game hands down. Run Berserker's gear and you'll be able to swap between rifle Deadeye, dagger/dagger Deadeye and staff Daredevil without having to change armour/accessories.
---
For Firebrand, there's a burning-focused condi DPS build that deals pretty great damage while it's with a group, and there's a support build which excels at providing aegis, stability and quickness, as well as having solid healing and condi removal making it a great all-rounder, especially when paired with Renegade who provides the boons Firebrand can't (mostly alacrity). You want Viper's for condi or Harrier's stats for support (some Minstrel's is fine too, but not too much, if you have highest toughness many raid bosses choose you as the tank).
---
Yep, Chronos buff. They give quickness and alacrity together, they're the defacto raid tanks, they have objectively the best utilities (see: portals), they remove boons, they have strong CCs and it's really easy to learn the basics. There's also a really damaging power build, but it works best in groups since you need more slowness application than you can reasonably provide alone. I would recommend Diviner's gear with a splash of Berserker's gear, especially if she's new to the build.
---
By the way [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/) is the resource for meta fractals and raiding builds. For open world just do whatever you enjoy, most of it's not hard enough to worry about best builds, but [metabattle](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World) can be a useful guide. Good luck!

3 seperate loops over Dragonfall to collect items, and often the in-game hint was extremely vague (IE, "Somewhere in The Skein")

In my experience, on both ends of the transaction, it really depends on the puzzle.

Not So Secret? I offered the mesmer that helped me get the diving achievement 50g. They refused it, but I offered it with zero hesitation or regret.
---
Grenditch Gamble? If I see one I'll take it, but I'm not tipping. Even if they came down just for me. Sorry, it's just a really easy one to do myself.
---
When I port, I'm usually either running them in what I think of as "host mode"...with a commander tag, posting in map chat, and hanging out at least an hour... When I do this is because I like to help but also because I'm feeling kinda lazy in-game, and hope to make a few gold in tips. I expect nothing but am thankful for anything. I've received tips as much as 5g, and as little as 2s plus two blue weapons (from a newbie, which was returned, with thanks). Average is between 50s and 1g.
---
Or, in a more localized, individual help mode, like yesterday. I went to the top of the wall for my Skyscale egg, and on my way passed someone who was clearly struggling and clearly headed the same way. Once I was up there I could see them close behind but stuck at one point, so I swapped skills and whispered them to stay put. After the port they thanked me and sent 2g, which again, I returned with thanks, because I wasn't doing it to get a reward, I was doing it because I've been frustrated with JPs before to the point of taking months off from playing, and I know how much a port would've meant to me at that point.
---
I'll add some context to what everyone is saying here about people getting angry at ppters and all that. Ppt is what wins matchups hands down. If your allies are trying to lose, then they'll get mad at you for ppting because it's directly interfering with their goal.  
---
"But Tatersalad, why would anyone be trying to deliberately lose?" Well, it depends. If you're in T1 on SoS or FA, you're trying to get 3rd place in order to move away from the Blackgate blob that only runs 50 thick or more. If you're a smaller havoc guild or a mid-sized (15-25) fight guild, having only giant blobs of 40+ people to fight gets old fast and it's fun. If you're on T2, same thing, no fighters want to win the T2 match up and go to T1 to fight the BG blob.  
---
I don't agree with them sending you hate PMs, I don't agree with being toxic with ppters, I don't think it's right to be mean to people who enjoy ppt; but I'm a FiGhT gUiLd player so I get where they're coming from. It's still not right, but I get it.
---
There’s nothin good out here so just stay in a while longer. :)
---
well. i disagree w/ your example and contend mine is more accurate
---
That would leave low level zones completely deserted.
---
What I'd like to see would be a combination of things:
---
First, an assortment of enrichments for amulets, for each of the 4 primary material types. So, "Enrichment of leather/cloth/ore/wood" which would, when equipped, provide the material type at a certain rate on kills. So like, I need rugged leather. I buy the Enrichment of Leather (for laurels), slot it in an amulet, and head out to Dredgehaunt. Now, in addition to my regular drops, every kill I make has, say, a 10% chance to drop an additional rugged leather.
---
Second, a Mystic Supply agent. A travelling merchant like the PSNA but themed around the mystic forge. Maybe a djinn themselves. They offer a Mystic Cache with a certain account limit (maybe 50x?), selling a container in exchange for the typical "bag" of that zone, plus spirit shards. So again using the rugged leather, if the Mystic Supply Agent is in Dredgehaunt, he'll sell a "Dredgehaunt Cliffs Mystic Cache" for a miners sack (dropped by dredge) and a spirit shard. On opening, the cache asks which of the mats you'd like, from any the map typically drops. Or to avoid item bloat, maybe the merchant just offers the mats themselves at cost, so instead of having a bunch of identical items that are "zonebound" you just buy a mat for a cost, and it's all listed in the merchant dialog.
---
This method would sacrifice some chance at higher end rng drops from the bags, but overall be a safer, faster way to ensure you get the materials you want, with a guaranteed drop of that material from the cache. This would also drive traffic to older maps whenever the agent was there.
---
&gt;Don't you have heavy animation locking?
---
Depends on the class. But that's the same with GW2. Druid's 3 staff skill is an animation lock.
---
&gt; Does it have anything like stunbreaking and then dodging a power mesmer spike or else you die? 
---
Yes. The boss may knock you off a platform and you'll have to use your anti knockback ability to not get knocked back for example.
---
&gt; I am used to Smite and Gw2 and any tab target slow GCD combat ive tried has been trash PvP in comparison, recently tried WoW again and it's ugh. 
---
I play smite too. Aphrodite can basically target who she wants to heal and then heal them too. On GW2 there is no way to use a spell just on an ally.
---
&gt; Skillshots&gt;autotarget. 
---
Targeting allies&gt;having to position myself around allies.
---
while we are at it, is there a [playlist name](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Customized_soundtrack) for race music? the Tyria race music is boring.
---
This chair, and the title they are using - Eternal Ally of Ahdashim - are rewards for doing all the Challenge Modes and all the other achievements in the new raid, The Key of Ahdashim.
---
That’s almost 23% of your time spent in GW2.  Do you play other games?  No judgement here, I’m just as bad but it I play a large variety instead of just one.
---
Reminds me of my Ele. I also picked the bloodstone staff and cat ears for her over Nevermore
---
&gt;	this is a good ass necro aesthetic
---
But is he really an ass necro? Or is he an ass reaper? Could even be an ass scourge? 🤔
---
Looks good
---
Oh I see, I guess that would make it more fun.  As a single-char story guy it's just hard for me to imagine haha.
---
That actually looks really cool
---
I did the whole thing without mounts, just for fun. It took me a while, but I didn't fall.
---
I was half tempted to just clear out the existing table of Known Issues and just put a single one that said "Known Issue Tracker. Status: Broken."
---
Since one one answered you, cm mechanics are 3 instakill tornados around outer platform, and a shield phase ala Deimos that instakill at 40% . He will also grab someone up in the air at that phase and players have to collect orbs to free him. Oh and the lightning attacks leave a high damage lava trail if the person didn't dodge or block

I suggest you read the comments below. GW2 is the same way. Don't get high and mighty kid when GW2 has the exact same issue. 
---
In-fact it takes longer with GW2 cause until you get passed Zhaitan. It far simpler and auto attacks just about kill everything really fast. So get off your high horse and stop looking at things so biased driven.
---
:3
---
It's just a waste of supply which is better spent on rams
---
Aaaaaaaaa-oooo-woooo  
---
Ma-taaaaaa  
---
TAAAAA-TAAAAA
---
I wouldn't mind seeing the sacrifice mechanoc added to the normal mode...
---
Gathering tools have been skirting the line to P2W for a while now. It's really too much.
---
I recommend you rewatch the Guild Chat. You're confusing it with Jessica Price's Tweets.
---
Type /age in game, in your chat box.
---
Hullo friend!  
---
I think that because so few people (comparatively, when looking at total population of the game) actually experience raids, and that one of the largest stumbling blocks for many is the increased difficulty when compared to other PvE activities, that the normal mode being "easy" is a great way to encourage new raiders!
---
It's swell that you like the mechanics of the CM, and I truly do hope they continue to make engaging mechanics in the future, however I disagree with your point. Having an "easy" mode and a "challenge" mode for the people who seek something harder is exactly the kind of balance ANet should strive for with raids!
---
It seems to me less like your issue is that CM should be normal mode, and more that completing CM each week should continue to be incentivized. Perhaps with a reward above that which is received for completing it on normal. That would be a compromise which would allow more people to raid, but still incentivize people looking for a challenge to continue to do CM.
---
Personally, I play activities that I find fun regardless of the reward (so the only incentive I need is the activity itself), however I understand that many others feel differently.
---
I would just like to ask you to consider things from others' points of view, and realize that asking them to make normal mode harder can restrict people from playing them at all. Also that calling the current normal mode "brain dead easy" can be trivializing to people who do not play at the same level as you and are still struggling to complete the raid.
---
Have a great day!
---
No. PPT is the right way to play WvW. Just look at how the game mode organizes information.
---
Lets see how they stack up.
---
His example stats that something is being advertised, and nothing even close is being provided. i.e. an ice cream truck selling burgers, something totally unrelated to ice cream.
---
To fit this example, someone in WvW would have to be running a tag but not doing anything WvW commanding related. Since his example is in reference to someone running a commander tag to run a PPT squad (one of two common squad types) his example invalidates itself because the tag IS running a WvW function, just not the one he wants.
---
In my example an ice cream truck is still selling ice cream but not the one the customer wants (hmmm, sounds familiar). Compare this to the WvW scenario where there is a tag running WvW functions, just not the one he wants. Because the commander isn't running the squad how he wants he declares the commander to be misleading people and wasting their time, REEEEEE, instead of getting off his lazy entitled butt and making his own squad, something anyone is free to do.
---
So, you're wrong ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

I do it to pay it forward. I've gotten a lot of portals to help me in the past so it's only fair I do it for others. Also in rare instances people will tip you some money or an item.
---
The game really doesn't need multiple cores, as most of the non-rendering heavy lifting is done on the server and most of the rendering heavy lifting is on GPU. The main benefit would be streaming in assets from disk and that probably is drive speed bound. The game usually uses 30-50% of a single i5 core on my desktop and 40-60% on my i7 laptop (it has a worse GPU - guessing more rendering tasks done in software)
---
So many of my characters are now using Chaos weapons...
---
I've been using Rivatuner in GW2 for years without issue.
---
Same! I don't know what that's about. My account name is feminine, and I play cuddly, pink asura almost exclusively. I thought it'd be obvious...
---
No, I'm explaining to you that there is a reason for the sentiment that you deem (sarcastically) constructive.
---
I want one of whatever Anet is smoking.
---
Having done a lot of mythic raiding, I disagree.
---
Sometimes, simple and punishing mechanics make for a well-designed fight. The best example I can think of is Mythic Star Augur in Nighthold.
---
There's a lot of things going on in the Heroic version of that fight (stack/spread moments, tank swaps, having to position puddles of crap on the ground, having to get to the edge of the room, to avoid an AoE). It's a hectic fight, but none of the mechanics are particularly punishing - you can just brute-force through them.
---
Mythic introduces one major new mechanic. Grand Conjunction. About 30 seconds into the fight, every person in your twenty-man raid gets a green, or orange marker over their head.
---
If a green and an orange marker touch, everyone dies. If two same-color markers touch, they clear. If a marker doesn't get cleared within 15 seconds, everyone dies.
---
A minute later, Grand Conjunction happens again.
---
But this time, there are three colors.
---
A minute later, it happens again. With four colors.
---
The counter resets every time the boss phases, but in the later phases of the fight, you have to position ground puddles, avoid ground puddles, avoiding AoE fears, and one-shot-kill ground slams, all in the middle of dealing with Grand Conjunction.
---
That one mechanic turns a relatively uninteresting, brute-forceable fight into the most fun raid boss I have ever progessed on.
---
The leather glyph provides much better value than this ...
---
Had to actually log in for this haha.  
---
It's worse than just 2 resources. For example right now passion flora, the node that is abundant on southsun cove, gives you some of the most sought after and meta food items tied to crafting atm.
---
Not just one or two. 
---
Snow truffles, Orrian truffle, see weed, Ghost pepper.  
---
I've been casually gathering some droprates and if that tier acts anything like the tier 1 conversions its not an equal droprate either. Sofar ive been getting 2 strawberries and beets for every 10 of the others. But i need a bigger pool size to be sure.  
---
Anyway, because of this its the most profitable route to take if you really want to use the alchemy glyph.
---
I'd also like to point out that all the glyphs are pretty much extra silver per harvest.   
---
Leather has a 27% chance to give the associated tier in leather and 6%(maybe 28%/5% again need a bigger pool) to give a tier higher. That means stuff like iron and plat are stupidly good with that glyph.
---
I'd just loved to see that glyph changed to something that is actually QoL. Like a rotating conversion so you could possibly get soft wood from ancient nodes during one of the rotations. 
---
The bounty, industry, flying and reaping ones IMO are good examples of glyphs as they should be.  
---
The only flat drop glyphs they should have had should have been something akin to 33% chance to get Season X material.
---
Is the forum the best place to report bugs? I've tended to use the /bug feature but the categories have never really been updated to fit the current state of the game and I don't know if it's even being looked at!
---
Isn't that the case with all of the glyphs though?  Volatile glyph in a gathering sickle gives an extra 3.6 silver per swing.  Last I looked, bounty on a high value plant or coral node is even higher.
---
I could see alchemy being a specific issue if there weren't ways to get t6 mats other than gathering and thus the glyph would let gem shop buyers earn more supply.  But since there other ways, it seems to me that it fits in the broader economy more or less like all other glyphs.
---
No because they are playing for the server. And not for them self and what they personally need. 
---
I mean i would join a CM fractal with a minstrel ele because i want the stuff from there. I am not experienced enough but i am sure entitled to waste other players time because i can and i want this stuff. Oh wait i can not because you guys would kick me as soon as i joined because in fractals you play for the group, right and don't waste other players time and hard work?  And somehow it is different in WvW, just because you can not kick them?
---
I tried outside, overrated game, the graphics is nice though.
---
Wait, aren't you supposed to skip timegate with elegy mosaics? And they raised their amount from bosses sky-high, I'm practically swimming in them right now.
---
I don't enjoy most of the LS4 maps for repeating and would rather play other maps I like better.  So I didn't play them that much.  I did explore the maps fully (or close to it) in the process of deciding this. I also don't like the zerg events (do not like zergs) so don't repeat them very much like Istan.
---
 
---
Didn't do all the achievements or anything on those maps either.  I also don't log in every day to play.
---
When I do play, sometimes I don't farm my home instance, depends on my time and interests.  
---
With that all said, from what I had explored on the maps and from when I do my home instance farming, I had pretty much all the ls4 currency for the skyscale.
---
And charged quartz?  I have hundreds left over after skyscale and selling them (for the food).  How?  Very easily.  When I do home instance farming, I charge quartz.
---
On a side note, SoS will beat BG this week in VP.
---
We got a situation where in dhuum cm it is just black boi grabbing guys and it takes people weeks and months to complete, while quadim2cm adds not one, but three and a half aoe instakill mechanics to an already bloated boss, yet still gets cleared by pugs on a second day. 
---
I just don't think that quadim2 is a very good encounter and it's cm doesn't improve on that. Instead of throwing everything they could have come up with, a-net should have focused on fewer more engaging mechanics and tightened dps  checks (to make chainlinking mandatory and kiter job not so afk). Adding just more circles to walk in/out like they did in cm just doesn't do it to me aymore.
---
Air guy CM would make a nice normal mode tho. Just a slight bump in difficulty. Would still be w4 tier easy.
---
Yup and if you are seige cap make golems
---
Points Per Tick. It means you're focusing on controlling objectives rather than finding fights.
---
Yes but again. that wasnt the case when i posted that :D
---
Oh alright, good to know. Thank you for the reply!
---
Thanks,  I'll check it out.
---
&gt; In pvp, thief is a hard class to play, but can be very rewarding if you master it.
---
Disagree. Strongly disagree.
---
Thieves have a hard time in group fights, and are not good 1v1 duellists. Their role in PvP is to run away and decap nodes. It's not exactly *rewarding* gameplay.
---
I'd guess it's an NVIDIA issue, tbh. Give Nouveau a go and see if there's a change :)
---
Hullo friend! I have absolutely used this mount to pull on gates in WvW. And then I got the achievement for doing it enough times, and never have again. So what I am saying here is, the skill is pretty much only useful for a one-time achievement you can get at spawn tower.
---
I'll take things Dr. ~~Zed~~ Ned would say for $800, Alex
---
I would just find a guild that focuses on ppt.  Personally running a karma train capping everything you can is not fun for me and is not rewarding for the people I'm driving.  When I am commanding 20-30 people I want to fight the other servers and see who wins.  Usually when I get ready for a run I look at all the maps, see something like a T3 bay or hills can go "We're going to cap that."  It leads to fun fights and a group goal for everyone.
---
Hello friend! This is absolutely fascinating information, and I am extremely intrigued to see a large group try this out, though it sounds entirely unintended for it to work that way.
---
Just play the way you want as long as you respect other people playing the way they want.  
---
In my opinion WvW is such a open and diverse gamemode that there isn't "one true way" to play it. As long as people respect each others playstyle and preferences it should work out for everyone.
---
&gt; If you tag up on a border then it is up to you to make the choices that benefits the server. If there is room for ppt then by all means go and do so. But if a blob comes in and shave off your border whilst you run away and take camps instead with the message hey it is ok we take it back later. Then that tag is a selfish prick.
---
This is hilarious because it's the fight focused tags that abandon or don't care about objectives or what gets lost because all they care about is blob v blob fights PPT be damned.
---
People express gratitude in many ways. Thanks is enough imo. It takes a couple seconds out of my day, having already done the puzzle and knowing others may want to skip it. But some people go even further and send gold. That 10-15 seconds gamble is far outweighed by the fact that Ive gotten as much as 30 gold for porting someone up a puzzle without any pre-agreed price.
---
Regarding chronomancer... They're a solid DPS class and two of the wells do heavy damage. They have support options, but you can take exactly none of them and go full DPS. Very easy to solo as they have a balance of offence and defence. 
---
I think you love mesmers or hate them, to be honest. I don't think they're complicated at all once you realise phantasms are just damage over time and clones are just landmines that taunt enemies off you.
---
Gw2eff has accounts with 36,287h 56m playtime and
---
16h 4m 49s playtime per day.
---
You're just a dirty normie, get out.
---
I'll give two answer: first oneshort and direct... second one, more ellaborated.
---
1.- No.
---
2.- PPT (Points per tick) and PPK (Points per kill) should be balanced in the final score. One of the big mistakes that WvW fell in, since time ago, was giving a non-balanced treatment to both scoring methods; most of hate between both sides ('cos there are sides, we want or not to see/admit it comes from this mistake. The WvW that should be settled should give a balance weight to every rank of points, so a) haters wouldn't have arguments for their injustified, absurd and meanie attitude, b) guilds focused to PPT and PPK would be forced to split, instead of merging in "sides" in certain servers and c) it would "invite" to the players to learn to fight and score at once. This is a must in a gamemode like WvW, where siege and combats should be valued in same way.
---
True! But 750 isn't as dramatic a number. :&gt;
---
I do not even want to know how GW2 compares when it comes down to PvP/WvW patches OMEGALUL
---
There's not a right way to play WvW. If who won/"the score" meant something then maybe it would be the proper way to play. 
---
They've improved the scoring system a lot, but its still about coverage and doesn't reflect much of your own personal actions. It's hard to do that in a week long match.
---
I would say that fighting is more fun than PPTing and it still can reward plenty of points for your server if you're good at it. (At least until the other servers stop fighting.)
---
fucking casual.
---
I love raiding, but there is nothing wrong with the normal mode of the raid being at the current difficult levels. Most PUGs still struggle anyway. It's hard enough for them to do that, and then challenges just increase the difficulty for better players.
---
The whole place is made out of wood, but we have to take down the only metal gate at the entire place. I love the logic.
---
Same for me! I've been helped by friends or other kind mesmers who ported me when I was struggling with my terrible lack of jumping skills, so now I leave my mesmer at the daily JPs for a while to pay it forward and help other people who might've been in my situation :)
---
Wait, so you lvld to 80, Played PoF until you get Raptor and Springer, filled the masteries until the higher charge jump and played through the last episodes story within only one hour? That's pretty amazing. :P
---
I’d honestly like to see a little more use for the warclaw in PvE. I was disappointed when they removed the bleed and my reaction was “so now it’s just a worse raptor with gryphon damage that hits less targets?”
---
So, you want reasons to repeat CMS. Yeah. So does the rest of the raid community.
---
Our group doesn't even use a kiter. Our pylon people get their own orbs. We just send the BS to handle anomalies. You can prob kill it faster and make it harder by removing that unnecessary element.
---
Yes.
---
Fucking yes. Fuck. 
---
The fuck is wrong with you?
---
I still use that Watchwork pick axe on the daily.  Wish sprockets were worth more but it's nice to randomly get to sell a stack.
---
The only bright side is that the thing is a beast when it comes to health when compared to the others. A good 10k while others struggle to hit 6k. But why use that when you can get the jackal’s shared evasion and use the skimmer to avoid pain?
---
&gt; [Damage—report: minimal. Error: damage—report—systems—have—been—damaged.](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/A_Sparkling_Rescue)

&gt; If my calcs are correct, you've spent roughly 5hrs logged into GW2, every day, since release.
---
I'm at 1,2600 hour total, playing since release and it's 4h 50m per day. You are pretty close. :D
---
looks like a rainbow alien...
---
I would just like more local conversion currency rates, as it’s annoying paying in USD when I use CAD
---
I use my glyph on the consortium sickle so now I get sprockets even with the useless plants.
---
Is this even still active?
---
Agree, but the earth djinn CM..... SO MUCH FCKIN FUN!
---
Thanks I hate it
---
Nice! I was really hoping they would do something like this. A lesser threat will be very interesting. Like Helmut Zemo from the MCU.
---
Or in other words, "my server wants to go down a tier so we can farm the lower servers that has less people.."
---
Ah I see, nice!
---
34 FPS? I'd *kill* for 34 FPS.
---
The skins will be edited to this comment later, sorry for the inconvenience meowth might bring you. /Nook
---
Just make a joke and put them on ignore, that will tilt them out of their lifes.
---
This is similar to needing to fail events to get achievements or maximize rewards in PvE. To lose the match creates the best situation for you, but that’s a symptom of bad game design. It’s not the player’s job to compensate by losing on purpose. If winning is fun for them, they should still do it, even if it kills their server.
---
What you're describing is much more elaborate than the person you're replying to is describing. An example of a simple mechanic would be 'boss applies a buff to itself that makes it do 50% increased damage'.
---
That's the whole point though, the hard mode here isn't hard and it barely changes how you fight him.
---
Aside from the fact that that Meowth is going to give me nightmares DAMN great cosplay!
---
So, anybody has ANet and Reddit's phone numbers to give them a call and have them erase that toon and this picture? Pretty sure they won't want the nightmares either
---
If you do the specimen chamber event in sandswept you’ll hardly have karma problems after that
---
You would be wrong about that, but I fully agree with that person.
---
gear is tiered, from worst to best 
---
white(common) blue(? ) green(uncommon) yellow(rare) orange(exotic) pink(Ascended) 
---
purple(legendary) have same stats as pink, but you can change them for free. 
---
Dungeon tokens is a currency awarded for completing dungeons, you buy sets of skins for armor and weapons with them. Not really that important. 
---
Laurels is a currency that you get from daily reward chests. You can buy Ascended trinkets, rings, amulets with them. 
---
Daily achievements give you two gold coins, if you finish three of them in a day. They change daily. ;) 
---
Apologies if I messed anything.
---
This game has been around long enough for there to be an overwhelming amount of endgame content. I can understand your frustration. Honestly it would be impractical to give you a complete list of what you could do here, but rather I could ask what do you want to do? You said you like the story and play alone so do you want to continue to do that?  Do you like completing collections, crafting, exploring, or PVP? Do you think you would enjoy any group content? Let us know and we can help point you know the right direction.
---
If you just wanna play alone and do the story though the next step after the base game is living world season 2 I believe. 
---
Laurels are a currency you get from your daily log in rewards. If you open your inventory and look at your currency tab you can see how many you have. Certain items can only be purchased with laurels like recipes, ascended trinkets, and certain upgrades.
---
Ascended is a level of gear. The name of Ascended gear shows up in pink. The order is gray&gt;white&gt;blue&gt;green&gt;yellow&gt;orange&gt;pink&gt;purple or junk&gt;basic&gt;fine&gt;masterwork&gt;rare&gt;exotic&gt;ascended&gt;legendary. The higher the gear the stronger it is. Ascended and legendary have the same stat values so they are equal in power but legendary equipment has the benefit of being able to swap the stat distribution of the item to whatever you please whenever you want. Legendary gear also has elaborate visual effects and takes a lot of resources and special achievements to make. 
---
Let us know what more you are interested in and I'd be happy to tell you more. This game is a blast at endgame.
---
Thing is, there is a difference between playing the game and skipping playing the game. What's the difference if someone does twice the damage? Gathers twice the materials? Runs twice as fast?
---
The difference is, that they're twice as good at something they're participating in as someone who isn't paying.
---
Gems-to-gold lets you *skip* playing the game. While shit like that glyph makes you *better* at playing the game.
---
I think that's an important distinction.
---
Dailies exist now, they give you 2g and are super worth it. Dungeons are dead. Endgame PvE meta is shaped around DPS, healers, and boon granters that can upkeep permanent Alacrity and Quickness. HoT is really hard, people grind its metas for gold. PoF is empty, but the mounts are SUPER good, and actually transform the way you play the game. Both expansions can usually be bought at one or another official retailer for 50% off, just be careful you don't get fake serial numbers. Speaking of, Specializations are largely far stronger than core builds, I'd recommend working towards the Hero Points required to fill out a specialization you think sounds cool. Masteries are kinda like...post 80 levels, and they're SUPER annoying. In PoF I recommend using the glowy orb chain over the ice floes in Thunderhead Peaks to grind EXP, in HoT getting gold on every adventure is the fastest way to level.
---
Only cringe is the edge lords on the right.
---
It's too hot, maybe next year.
---
&gt;It’s hardly call it “split” as the ability is practically the same in both game modes besides the masteries affecting it.
---
So it's the same in both game modes, except when it's not the same.
---
Shit game, bad graphics and full of hacks.
---
"you'd straight up be getting better loot for paying gems."
---
Ok so honestly what is your point? You can buy gold with gems.  
---
What massive advantage is someone buying with the glyph of alchemy?
---
First off, you don't need to do too much to your gear just to do the story. That part's easy. So long as you have Exotic (Orange name) gear you'll not really face any issues that Ascended/Legendary would help you overcome.
---
For some of the terminology you referenced...
---
* *Ascended Gear:* It has a pink name. The stats are numerically equivalent to Legendary (purple name) gear, but unlike legendary they can't swap stats on the fly.
---
* *Dungeon tokens:* Each time you complete a dungeon run (explorable mode for the dungeon, not the story mode) you receive tokens as a reward. The tokens can be used to purchase special exotic armor from a vendor.
---
* *Laurels:* For laurels, it's probably best if you just read the [wiki page](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Laurel). In short, though, they're an account-bound currency you can use to get things like Ascended gear.
---
* *Daily Challenges:* Each time you log in you can find daily challenges. You can see them in the associated tab under achievements in the hero pane. They reset on a 24 hour cycle, thus daily.
---
*THE MOST IMPORTANT THING* is to not panic and overthink it. GW2 is designed so that you can choose what you have  fun doing and keep doing it without worrying too much. You can ease into all of these things. I would suggest you find some friends/a guild to run with as it's always easier to learn that way, but ultimately just think about your next step. Don't think about what step you SHOULD be taking because there isn't any such thing. Think about the next step you WANT to take. 
---
Maybe complete central Tyria map 100%? Maybe unlock story missions you don't own yet and enjoy them? Maybe buy HoT or PoF and start chipping away at the new story content in them. Or maybe you want to get full level 80 gear, and so you can start looking for people in the LFG or in map chat to run the explorable dungeon modes.
---
The real question is what do YOU want to do? What is your next goal for the game? Do you want to progress the story, your character's strength, your personal understanding of a profession, gain some specific reward, complete the map?
---
They need to change it so that the Agents swoop in on their own Skyscale.
---
If you lacked the raptor t4 mastery, then yes, they’re the same :p
---
World completion gives you two tokens, which are a requirement for making first generation of legendaries.
---
P2W for what exactly? getting to a skin quicker?
---
everything is viable, stop using that term in the wrong context.
---
&gt;I don’t even know if SC is up to date
---
it is for most of their stuff.
---
I once saw a contortionist, but this is the biggest stretch I've ever seen.
---
A very phallic thing for which to sit upon, set on top of a chocolate mousse cake.
---
As long as you follow the game's rules there's no way to play it "wrong". Just do what you think is fun.
---
i dont think simple mechanics are necessarily bad,  
---
but if a fight only has a very limited amount of mechanics and theyre mostly simple, then ramping up the difficulty by making the fight more difficult doesnt make the fight more fun.  
---
the quadim mechanics dont really interact with each other, they dont result it a complex web of mechanics.  
---
its just a few independet mechanics which result in a arguably boring fight.
---
please do tell now that i am on skyscale flight why it tells me to unlock masteries, i know its hidden but at what point will I see my progress?
---
how?
---
"you can never have too much treasure"  \*has full inventory\*
---
Yep, since PoF launch people have been posting this lovely TLK homage on reddit every now and then, and I'm glad people still discover the joys of these easter eggs throughout the Crystal Desert and Elona.
---
However, that trio is not the only The Lion King reference in game. Once you travel to the Sandswept Isles in Living World Season 4 Episode 2 and do the Honorary Olmakhan achievement of hunting various prestigious animals around the Hunting Grounds, one of these targets is a nasty sand lion called [Skaa](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skaa) (referencing Simba's lovely uncle Scar from the film). ;)

That meowth looks like he wants to die.

---
Not what I like about WvW but to each his own.  Without PPTers, the game mode would be even more dead than it already is, so I can't hate them.  My opinion is that there is no real point in winning other than getting a matchup you prefer, so fights are more important to me.
---
A one time purchase that grants you significantly more income generation than other players. Not only does this mean that someone who paid is getting similar rewards for less effort, but it's also reducing your own personal purchasing power. That's a problem.
---
When someone else buys gems&gt;gold it's actually *increasing* your purchasing power by removing 30% of the gold involved from the economy. Alchemy on the other hand is *reducing* your purchasing power by increasing other people's material yields but not your own.
---
My favorite was “on a tall tree”.... umm... thanks.
---
Honestly? You couldn't have done them more justice
---
"I wAnT tHat"

No you fckn don't

---
Not sure if amazing or amazingly horrifying.
---
Exactly. And I don't care about his reward. I care about my enjoyment of the game. And that isn't being diminished by him buying 50 legendaries and sparkling in LA. It gets diminshed if he runs as twice as fast as me because he bought Shoes of Running in the gemstore.
---
Skipping directly to the reward is no issue. Participating at the content and outperforming is the issue.
---
Now that glyph we're talking about isn't playing in the same league as my hypothetical shoes, but it starts to get pretty damn close. That's why I said that glyphs have been skirting for a while now, and they inch ever closer to that highly subjective line.
---
I enjoyed the journey and it felt rewarding to me when I was finished. No problems with the grind for me.
---
&gt; Depends on the class. But that's the same with GW2. Druid's 3 staff skill is an animation lock.
---
That is a movement skill, that is not what animation lock is called, you can freely move after the dash, it doesn't lock you in place for a sec amount of time with a GCD.
---
There is a different between 1/2 skills and almost all skills too.
---
&gt;Yes. The boss may knock you off a platform and you'll have to use your anti knockback ability to not get knocked back for example.
---
I am not talking about telegraphed encounters, just general gameplay. If i screw up twice in Gw2 i am dead, warrior reflects my rapid fire? I gotta cancel or i die, mesmer opens on me from somewhere i can't even see? I gotta stunbreak and dodge or i die.
---
&gt;I play smite too. Aphrodite can basically target who she wants to heal and then heal them too. On GW2 there is no way to use a spell just on an ally.
---
Her heal is a skillshot, the actual heal effect is literally a bonus effect for being linked, you can't just target an ally and heal, it depends on the CD of your 1, compare this to things like Hel her 1 or Ra's 3. 
---
&gt;Targeting allies&gt;having to position myself around allies.
---
All you are saying is lower skillcap/ceiling&gt;higher skillcap/ceiling.
---
Positioning is one of the most important aspects.
---
&gt; In GW2, the effectiveness of defensive stats is intentionally much, much lower than the effectiveness of offensive stats
---
That was different during the release, and got progressively worse over the years.
---
Just a quick FYI.
---
since hes tied to cantha, I guess we have wait for the cantha add-on :P
---
Shiny is dead there is tombstone in the new raid
---
oh my god the pictures of the skill icons makes this so much easier ty
---
Shiny died for our shiny weapons
---
They did say trying, no guarentee they succeded
---
My Berserker is outfitted in all Dire gear (Toughness, Vitality and Condition Damage) with Sword/Torch. I only use it for random open world PvE, and she tends to melt things quite fast, while having amazing survivability. 
---
It's not a build for most situations, but for for open world PvE she does great. She is what I play when I am in the mood for being tanky, but still want to see things die fast.
---
What to do? If you are after regular end game content, we have dungeons, fractals and raids. Each has their own mechanic and joining a guild that does them can help you understand them.
---
If you like to explore or challenges, take a look at the achievement panel. Think of it as a quest log where you can choose what to complete. To many, myself included, we take achievement points as a form of prestige.
---
If you'd like to look better, take a look at your wardrobe (3rd tab in the bank). It shows every skin in the game and you can search the style you want and /wiki the items. Some are bought with gold, others are crafted, some come from achievements, and a few are only bought with gems.
---
If you like pvp, we have WvW and sPvP. 
---
In any case, you'll want gold and specific currencies to craft or buy stuff you'll need. Learn about RIBA farming and meta events at https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/et
---
The game is no sandbox but no roller coaster either. Is more like an amusement park, full of rides and stuff to do, but no guide to tell you where you should go.
---
My image loaded in from the top down and when I saw Jesse and James's faces I was like "Oh that's not bad". When it loaded to Meowth I wanted to die.
---
Later: it's getting cold again tho and the sun is gone most of the time... Better wait till summer.
---
[This color combination is quite nice.](https://i.imgur.com/XRMbtpG.jpg)
---
Players being players doesn't invalidate the quality of the game's content.
---
People handle those attacks by not getting hit at all. If the attack one-shots you, that's a clear sign that it was an attack you were meant to dodge, or avoid via positioning, or avoid via a defensive skill like a block.
---
Generally, attacks that you are meant to avoid entirely will have an indicator on the ground, usually as a red or orange circle or line. These attacks will generally one-shot you, so the indicator is intended to telegraph the attack about 1 second early so you can dodge.
---
Also, some one-shot attacks, especially in the core, non-expansion zones, won't have indicators, but instead the enemy will visually "wind up" an attack animation. For example, if a hammer-wielding enemy raises their hammer slowly above their head, you can be sure that about 1 second later they are going to hit you HARD, so watch for the attack and dodge it.
---
In WoW it was important to watch the battlefield, but it's even more important in GW2. You have to always be watching the ground at your feet for dangerous red/orange areas, and always be watching your enemy's attack animations for stuff that looks big and dangerous and telegraphed. Don't fall into the trap of staring at your skillbar, or you'll miss something crucial. Similarly, don't click on your skills with your mouse, as this also forces you to look at your skillbar and take your eyes off the battle; instead, use the keyboard 100% of the time to activate your skills.
---
Glad to be of service:D
---
It absolutely does when you're required to play with 10 players lmao. seriously?
---
That disables things like Copper-Fed, not player *character* chatter. That is disabled with "Disable Player Chatter"
---
Except that the step with the s4 currencies is literally a daily chore. I've been doing that part for almost a week.
---
Blursed cosplay
---
List them: make one with the ones you are complaining about.
---
Actual GMs are MIA. The rules are haphazard and enforced on you by other players through the pvp system.
---
I've been on servers that mainly want to fight and were toxic against anyone wanting to ppt.  But. As I was newer to wvw I didn't mind fighting but I also wanted to progress my wvw abilities and you cant do that very fast in fight only mode.  On a k-train with Xushin it was easy to go up 25-30 levels per hour without trying.  And, the goal wasn't to actually hold it, just take it and move on.  I would love a server that supported both k-training and fighting, but right now I would prefer the k-training.
---
If I were him, I would too.
---
It would cost you nothing to not do that
---
press v to dodge. use your blocks. use your cc. get your combo / rotation on the trash rolling and kill them before they do any damage to you.
---
Cool
---
How soon can we blast them into space so we never see them again?
---
This is approaching r/imsorryjon material
---
Anet dev explicitly said in an AMA that they couldn't do that story at justice so that cut until they can.
---
So it's on the table but nobody knows if they'll ever have the time and resources to do it justice. 
---
I'll add link if I can find it.
---
Maybe you were helping joined below average groups.
---
10% dhuum is the dps check I was referring to and I didn’t say it was hard but hard for a lot of raiders on release to deal with.
---
The orbs were only “bad” for high ping players.

The gate skill is not an engage skill, warclaw gets 3 skills (engage is the pounce, #2 skill is basically a detection pulse that shows enemy dots on the map in a radius and #3 is the gate pull that costs supply).

Where do I uninstall?

There's builds that trivialise bosses even more. How can people not realise that you can do certain raid bosses with as much effort as on tequatl?

[ARENA NET] [Daniel Snider.6241 posted on 2019-06-14 00:51:44](https://en-forum.guildwars2.com/discussion/79524/api-updates-june13-2019):
---
&gt; Hello all,
---
&gt;I added some missing content to the API: two home instance nodes, some missing novelties and the latest mount skin.
---
&gt;I have also added a new quests endpoint so you can see all the finer-grained details of the quests available in the game (completing the trio of `/v2/stories`, `/v2/stories/seasons` and now `/v2/quests`)
---
&gt;I also put in a `/v2/characters/:id/quests` endpoint to let you see all the quests you've completed per character! This also means you can automatically track which paths of the personal story your characters have completed (I hope someone writes an app for it :D)
---
&gt;# Recent API Updates
---
&gt;---
---
&gt;Here is the change in list format:
---
&gt;* `/v2/novelties` has previously missing data.
---
&gt;* `/v2/mounts/skins` has previously missing data.
---
&gt;* `/v2/quests` and `/v2/characters/:id/quests` have been added
---
&gt;Thank you to those who have been pointing out issues with the API. If you notice any more, please let me know
---
&gt;Thanks!
---
&gt;Snider
---
downvoting?
---
ok, thanks
---
in a game where the end game is intended to be cosmetic and where highest stat gear is handed to you and where the best cosmetic items are mostly push through a cash shop, its already P2W. yes, its pay to look pretty and none of it is required to complete any actual content (when they do release actual content over gemstore skins anyway). but by their own definition of gw2's endgame and the content they push through the gemstore the game is already pay to excel in anet's ideal endgame.
---
Nouveau is not good, I do play games other than GW2.
---
please delete the middle one it’s horrifying.
---
Do you know how average works?
---
FIIIIREEEEEE
---
That's some quality meme!
---
Logging in/character creation/ game intro sequence? To be fair if you are playing the game at all those ones arent exactly optional.
---
even if CMs were normal modes, they'd be a joke as it took like 4 hours to full clear :)
---
What is the name of the repeatable achieve? I donated extra but got nothing to show up in my achievement panel?
---
She looks a lot like my [Mesmer](https://imgur.com/a/2T34z1Z)!
---
No
---
I was told a few months back to not report bugs via CS Ticket and go to the forums instead.
---
this absolutely belongs on r/cursedimages. having said that, i love it
---
We had George debuff he finished patching after we already had 3 tries on the first boss
---
Do you just have tons of makeover kits lying around for whenever you want to make these cosplays?
---
Obviously there's a much higher density of t5 nodes, so the glyph harvests much more in a much shorter amount of time. Them selling that drives down the value of any t6 nodes you would have harvested, that extra gold from selling t6 mats is then used to purchase other items that you have to compete with them for, reducing your own purchasing power.
---
I unironically need a load of these and have been farming them for months.
---
the name is ironic, but don't tell anyone (:
---
If you want to skip straight to the footage of the #first kill it starts at 1:31 (not related to the 1h 31m it took to clear)
---
Me-ouch. That's right.
---
From the thumbnail I'm guessing its a good update?
---
Well said. I took one look at the Metabattle page for Mesmers and said, “Maybe I should just quit while I’m ahead.”
---
I’ll look into finding a guild. It is nice to play with friends 😁
---
rookie numbers
---
&gt; where does this build shine?
---
Open world since mobs can barely fight back, you dont have a timer to kill them and you can do all that with blindfold while spamming buttons.
---
In wvw it's only good in roaming and small scale fights (with different weapons and gear though) because it can burst with a lot of conditions and then have constant pressure with autos and ambushes. In large scale fights it's beyond useless because of projectiles which get reflected, conditions which get cleansed fast and non existent aoe damage which is very important part of zergs.
---
It has very strong use on certain raid bosses, but again, with different weapons. Check snowcrows for detailed guides and builds.
---
Know I will get world first since I saw that video, don't need to practice something, only the video improves me as a player
---
You also get legendary in pvp by reading metabattle all night and testing 6 draft-builds
---
For PvE you should be good depending on your build (linking your chooses would be great).
---
For PvE farming trains you need to use a great sword to tag efficiently.
---
For WvW you are not fit for large groups, but roaming or small groups with good comms should be doable.
---
I run one of my mesmers as chrono condi and I find it just fine for PvE.
---
trait discipline, defense and spellbreaker with some defensive skills like healing signet and endure pain. There is no need for defensiv gear in pve
---
Everyone who is up for mercy killing meowth say aye.
---
It really depends on what you are reporting. 
---
If you are suggesting a change to the game, then we direct those to the forums immediately. 
---
However, if you submit a bug our process will usually be to escalate it to the programmers in charge of the issue (if they don't already know,) provide the users with a temporary fix or workaround (if we have one - sometimes it's not possible,) and then let you know we're working on it while the programmers get to work.
---
I dont have a single peerless infusion on....its me in the chair
---
THIS WILL BE POKEMON IN 2014 😳😳😳
---
You have a lot pumped into Power, so I wouldn't call this a condition build, not a dedicated one anyway.  A true condition build would utilize Trailblazer's (ascended: Pahua's)  gear:  tons of condition damage and expertise, and lots of toughness and vitality to keep you alive while your conditions are ticking.  And, it would decrease the frequency in which you get steamrolled in WvW.   It's win-win-win.
---
You can try before you buy by going to the PvP lobby, equipping a Rabid amulet, and dumping conditions on the practice golems.  Alternatively, you can purchase exotic Dire-spec gear from the TP for 20 - 40 silver per piece.
---
Honestly? Because I'm expected to.
---
If I complete a JP for whatever reason on my Mesmer, I start getting people bugging me to do it for them.
---
Normally it's just slightly rude impatient people who then say thanks after. That's whatever. During the Skyscale step that requires jumping puzzles people got real pushy and over the line with it.
---
I don't think even a casual raiding group would take 9 months to complete a raid wing
---
GW2 raids really needs its own subreddit. :\\
---
I just gave you a example that happens fairly often and you still feel that is playing for your server? Really? Because that person do not even do ppt properly becaue ignoring that you loose a tier 3 keep means you loose tons of ppt and gain nothing by taking a camp that someone else take back 4 min later.
---
Do you realize how much you have to use the glyph to reach the ~220g difference you could have aquired just exchanging the 1000 gems to gold. any only AFTER that can you consider any of the harvesting mats profit. (Also, any "profit" from each node, has to be calculated in the value lost from not obtaining the non-alchemy items you would have aquired) 
---
if you want to complain about glyphs go with bounty, leatherworker or logging because they can actually turn profitable very quickly.
---
Do people not even read? I gave a perfect example and you answer on something totally different.
---
Again, it's not a problem now, but if ancient wood or any of the convertible mats near 10s again... 2 weeks.
---
Um no? Are you arguing just to argue or just stubborn. Anet told players they can convert 168 LI to LD and that it’s a permanent thing. Players were ready to convert those when the legendary was fully released. 
---
Out of nowhere Anet went and pulled those after they explicitly said they wouldn’t, they didn’t communicate or anything. 
---
So now those players that were ready, have to grind another 10-15 weeks of wing 5-7 clears to get what they were originally able to.
---
It uses supply? That's so stupid.
---
I regret taking the effort to read all of this.
---
Your grawl impress-- SHUT UP
---
I imagine that'd be for the Heroic Dragonsblood weapon achievements.
---
As someone who enjoys Mesmer, I feel very attacked! (Or maybe I was just the illusion all along)

---
The punctuation thief struck again.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Used to play WvW a lot. There is no wrong way of playing WvW in that regard. The entire goal of the gamemode is to help your realm (server) win the matchup in any way possible. PPT-ing is technically there to achieve that goal.
---
Big but coming here.. it's also incredibly boring to play, or play against when you like action in your WvW gameplay. Personally I prefer fights open field 1000 times over siege fights. They allow for a lot more combinations of outcome and testing your skill, whereas just running around capping camps, towers and keeps just gets repetitive quick for me. 
---
Point of what I'm saying is: play it the way you enjoy it the most, as long as you don't afk in there it's all fine with me, and you shouldn't let people talk you down because they think their way is the best.
---
What kind of argument is that? There are tons of new systems and reworks coming. You said it yourself things change, very possible any of the Alchemy mats will blow up in value and it will be a problem.
---
oh god, i've had player chatter turned off for so long i forgot it existed
---
This is the best I’ve seen.
---
That’s a cool bot trick!
---
Huh...Color me impressed AND horrified. Good work.
---
Thank you!
---
I hate and love you, there must be something wrong with me.
---
Yes indeed :)
---
no i think this looks intresting nice work m8
---
I got marauders for my first set because I’m bad at the game and I wanted more hp than berserkers gives.
---
Sounds like you just haven't taken the time to learn Mesmer skills and are getting clowned on by players better than you. Learn to counter them or just learn to outplay them.
---
if you are constantly getting put against the same Mesmers you can't beat then maybe you should stop playing ranked for that time instead of constantly trying to requeue into people that stomp you.
---
Probably this. Quartz isn't hugely expensive, so you will probably get more quartz faster if you farm gold or valuable drops (fractals, silverwastes, meta train) and simply buy the quartz outright, than if you run around and farm it on alts.
---
Stealth mount is a really interesting idea! I do wish they'd do something to make this mount viable in PvE. Giving it a viable place in PvE can help continue to attract more players to WvW as well.
---
&gt;  If they did, then pve players would cry about not getting the mount in pve 
---
Let them cry. Teach the toxic casuals need to stop acting entitled. inb4 "bUTIoNlYhAvE3hOuRsToPlaY!!!!!!!"
---
The other day there were several thousand people online, lol. CoH is back, baby!
---
Man this guy uis a clown
---
It was fun while it lasted :(
---
I wish there were something significant.  I can’t play melee in this game.  Thank god for scourge.
---
&gt; We can even fly now.
---
Sure; my point being, you don't even need the flying ones, the second jumping one would be enough.
---
* Berserker, power builds.
---
* Viper, condition builds.
---
* Diviner, boon support builds.
---
* Harrier, healing builds.

MOAR DOTS
---
What does the text on the right side of you screen say, the hatchling only likes to eat things, when it is happy and the nest is clean.
---
Once I played with a dagger/shield spellbreaker running full signet build, who started kicking people because we didn't have enough dps
---
They are still in my inventory and all I have done is the ball and the legs
---
He just lived in another plane of existence, we can't comprehend how superior he is with our inferior meta builds
---
&gt;25-30 levels per hour
---
You mean per day, right?
---
The fact that you don’t have any sense of punctuation, sentence structure or spelling, it makes it REALLY hard to assume you’re even average at this game. How can I trust someone to dps, disengage or rotate in any meaningful way if they say shit like “memdium” 
---
Next time you get mad, think about what YOU could to do improve the outcome.
---
3/10
---
Real good, but Meowth was a cat not a rat.
