*Deep breath*...

.
---
...SCRAPPER BUFFS!
---
---
---
Gamechanger for stealth blasting in WvW though.
---
Triple Trouble is 3 heads, Bubbles might be a hydra... Worms definitely are the eyes of the Deep Sea Dragon.
---
&gt; Revenant is pretty fun. I mean, you can play it as braidead alacrity bot, but there are a lot of things that can be done on top of that.
---

---
I play Revenant now since it's the closest I can get to playing Chronomancer in Fractals, but it just isn't the same.
---
&gt;People keep saying this as if it were fact, "the game needs 'replayable content,' 
---
That's because it is?
---
&gt;No it does not.
---
Yes it does. Replayable content is what keeps players playing a game accross literally every singe game meant to be played more than once.
---
&gt;The simple fact is that most players do not engage with ANY of that content, EVER, so if the game "needed" that content to survive, then it would already be dead.
---
Like 100 people got canned, the lead designer for PvE bosses quit, the lead designer for open world quit, the founder of the company quit and 90% of the gamemodes haven't been updated in nearly a year if not longer.
---
&gt;As did Whisper in the Dark.
---
You do realize that even anet said that whisper in the dark was not meant to resolve anything right? They've said that the reason the episode exists is to open up future plots.
---
&gt;Not typically, it depends on how they roll out, but even the longest seasons only take up half the year, so either they release all episodes and then take half a year off, or they release ~8 episodes, take 1-2 months off, ~6-8 more, 1-2 months off, ~8 more, and then a 3-4 month summer gap. And that's not even considering the shorter 8-12 episode seasons.
---
A single episode out of any bundle of episoides from any of these serials is longer than a whisper.
---
&gt;I'd like to know the answers to these things. I actually believe the Saga system is the best way to answer them. These were always tricky to tackle using the old episode system, since they had to be too focused on "advancing the plot" of the moment,
---
Um. You do realize that saga is literally the exact same thing as living world but with a new name yes?
---
&gt; but I think it's overall quite good for an MMO that has to handle all the varieties of player choice in an efficient way. 
---
What player choice? No choices you make actually mater or affect the plot in the slightest. They briefly tried that in the personal story (which only led to branching paths, not branching endings) then completely ditched the concept alltoogether.
---
&gt;True, This would be "monster of the quarter."
---
&gt;Otherwise the same though.
---
"Except for this overwhelmingly massive difference that literally makes or breaks the concept its named after its otherwise the same."
---
&gt;And it is your opinion that it containing those elements is a bad thing. 
---
No it isn't. Writing has actual rules and standards that have been cemented over centuries from the best stories that make the most cohesive narratives.
---
&gt;Nope.
---
You're playing a game not reading a book. 
---
You don't even have the excuse of this being bioshock because the story here is shit.
---
&gt;According to my own personal opinion, just as your position is by the metric of your own personal opinion.
---
Except my position isn't based on my own personal opinion. Its based on the objective factual ammount of content that was released.
---
&gt;That was basically how I expected them to solve it, so that didn't bother me. 
---
Bad writing not bothering you doesn't stop it from being bad writing.
---
&gt;In the past 12 months we've gotten eight story episodes, each with their own maps,
---
Which are completely superficial and vapid and after you do map completion there is no reason to return to them ever.
---
&gt;two new mounts, a new raid, 
---
In a vacuum? Good. In a year? Bad.
---
&gt;and several returning festivals. 
---
You mean already existing content that we've already played?
---
&gt; People come and go from companies all the time, 
---
Ah yes, the lead designer for living world which is literally the only thing anet is currently focusing on meaning the saga is going to be without a him, leaving? Completely normal.
---
The CEO, Lead Open world designer and lead boss designer all living with a month of one another? Also completely normal. 
---
People in high ranking positions do not jump ship en mass from successful companies.
---
Also JP claims that the decision to make LS5 happened during the LS4 planning. Its just that they started LS4 planning with that being uncertain, came up with a skeleton story that could work either way, and ended up mostly keeping that.
---
A "Lead" doesn't mean the same at every company. Either way it's not a management or even a leadership position. Many times it's simply used to denote someone who is the team SME or p picnic face of a team. Sometimes it's a technical lead. Rarely, if ever, is it a true leadership position.
---
The other thing being discounted here is reason why someone leaves. The Gaming and Tech industries are extremely competitive when it comes to hiring. If someone is good enough talent, it's usually not hard for another company to poach taken by simply giving a better offer than the existing employer can match.
---
Sometimes people also just leave because they want to do something new or they are better at starting companies than running them. The team behind Torchlight left Runic Games to start a new company, yet they are still working on the new Torchlight game for PWE.
---
There's a lot we don't know.
---
What happens when you're in game and try to access the HoT content / start the HoT story? The website may just not reflect what's going on in game.  If it's still giving you issues there I would contact support and ask them.
---
The kernel of truth? is that she did claim that when they first started planning LS4, they were not sure if there would be an LS5 or not, which guided them to come up with a story that could work if the game happened to end. That they weren't sure if there would be an LS5 (let alone an expansion) tells you exactly how "invested" they were in ongoing GW2 content at the time.
---
No one really had the 200IQ of just using a chrono for not only pre, pre, pre nerf SoI but also any kind of fractal skips.
---
So pugs would swap to a Norn for the Bear Form racial and solo heat room that way.
---
As far as mechanics go, having a dependency clause on the skills makes this a good fit for glyphs! Elementalists already have a couple glyphs that summon things, so that works out.
---
I kinda forgot about them until this thread
---
It's just one dev leaving for probably a better job, chill out
---
only 90s kids remember
---
&gt;Yes it does. Replayable content is what keeps players playing a game accross literally every singe game meant to be played more than once.
---
Again though, the "replayable content" they're typically talking about raids, fractals, WvW, PvP, are *not* important to GW2, because *most* players do not play this content *at all.* The "replayable content" that matters to GW2 is open world map metas and festivals. 
---
&gt;Like 100 people got canned, the lead designer for PvE bosses quit, the lead designer for open world quit, the founder of the company quit and 90% of the gamemodes haven't been updated in nearly a year if not longer.
---
Most of the people that were fired were working on non-GW2 projects. And again, **there is no need for, or benefit to, updating PvP, WvW, raids, or fractals,** since these modes are *irrelevant* to most GW2 players. complaining about these modes not getting enough attention is no more relevant than claiming that GW2 is in trouble because Anthem didn't do well. They are a completely different product to most GW2 players, and their success or failure simply does not matter at all to them.
---
&gt;You do realize that even anet said that whisper in the dark was not meant to resolve anything right? They've said that the reason the episode exists is to open up future plots.
---
But it *did* resolve the immediate storyline, just as a book might even as part of a larger saga. Whispers resolved what happened to the fort, where Jhavi and Almorra went, and you took out the muscle responsible for this specific attack, preventing him from continuing forward. This is plenty of plot resolution for one episode.
---
&gt;A single episode out of any bundle of episoides from any of these serials is longer than a whisper.
---
It took me longer to complete the story portions of this chapter than any TV episode I've watched.
---
&gt;Um. You do realize that saga is literally the exact same thing as living world but with a new name yes?
---
That's not how they've described it. Again, we'll have to see if they live up to that or not. It's impossible to judge at the moment.
---
&gt;What player choice? No choices you make actually mater or affect the plot in the slightest. 
---
You can choose to be a Norn for this story, which should impact how your character relates to things. That's what I was talking about, it's tricky in an MMO to write a story around the main character, when the main character can be many things. It means you either shallowly interact with the player character directly, or it means you need to craft significant divergences in the plot to account for alternate possibilities, which add time and money to the project. I think that within those limitations, they've done a decent job of it. 
---
Going back to the beginning, I think the way they handled the personal story was a pretty interesting one, since instead of the traditional structure of a branching narrative where you start in a single place and then shift further from players based on making different choices, their system started you out very different from everyone else, one of dozens of possible states, but then slowly started drawing your choices closer and closer to the other players, until by the end of it they'd brought everyone to basically the same place, so nobody would be left behind. 
---
&gt;"Except for this overwhelmingly massive difference that literally makes or breaks the concept its named after its otherwise the same."
---
No, the "monster of the week" formula does not rely on the "week," after all, when there are gaps in the airing schedule that monster has to last 3-8 weeks until the next one. The core element of the "monster of the week" is more that "it is the monster born in this single story that dies by the end of this single story, regardless of the release schedule." The "week" part is more just an artifact than a defining element, like "flavor of the month," or "fifteen minutes of fame," neither of which is necessarily chronologically accurate. You're engaging in semantics again to avoid addressing the core principles at play.
---
&gt;No it isn't. Writing has actual rules and standards that have been cemented over centuries from the best stories that make the most cohesive narratives.
---
Lol, no, there are no rules to writing, and any writer who thinks there are is an idiot. There are guidelines, best practices, but these are all just intended for "typical" situations, a way for amateur writers to avoid common problems, but which talented writers can actually use to advance. Any "rule" in writing can be broken under the right circumstances, and there is no objective point system for determining the quality of a story based on how many boxes it does or does not check. 
---
&gt;Except my position isn't based on my own personal opinion. Its based on the objective factual ammount of content that was released.
---
Nope, still your personal opinion, you just elevate your own opinion to the realm of fact. There are certain factual metrics about the amount of content released, like how it is a fact that they released more content over this past year than they have during most years of the game's existence, but it's still a subjective matter how much this *matters* to you, whether it is a good or a bad thing that they released this much, and not more, and not less.
---
&gt;Bad writing not bothering you doesn't stop it from being bad writing.
---
That is *exactly* what stops it from being "bad writing," as that term is nothing other than subjective. It's like saying that the flavor of a food not bothering you does not mean that it doesn't taste bad. 
---
&gt;Which are completely superficial and vapid and after you do map completion there is no reason to return to them ever.
---
That's your opinion, whereas I, and hundreds of thousands of others, spend many hours on those maps after completing them once. This is the "repeatable content" that has driven this game for the past seven years, the content *you* insist is absolutely necessary, even if your attention is misplaced. 
---
&gt;Ah yes, the lead designer for living world which is literally the only thing anet is currently focusing on meaning the saga is going to be without a him, leaving? Completely normal.
---
Again, I don't know the guy. I have no idea what he contributed to, or how much, and I have no idea who is replacing him, and whether I'll like that person better. This is the problem with game design, so many cooks, it's rarely easy to tell who is responsible for what. I can't judge any person's coming or going as an issue unless I have a good idea of what, specifically, is being lost. 
---
&gt;People in high ranking positions do not jump ship en mass from successful companies.
---
Sure they do.
---
the game is still good so it's pretty easy to remember that
---
Why don’t you people get this?  He left. He is being cool about it and not posting about it. He’s gone!!!
---
But this is new, right? I don't remember seeing it before.
---
Kill things faster than they kill you. As well depending on your weapons, Ranger Greatsword autos give you evade frames on the 3rd hit, Sword offers evade frames on Sword 2 ability. 
---
But pretty much kill things faster than they kill you.
---
Ya seriously. Dafuq is wrong with this guy?!!! :O
---
I want a bone principle chalmers
---
Now, the most important question: was this a screencap from a video or a true screenshot hunter's shot?
---
-I'm running on Linux/Wine. Most of the time it's smooth, but it does get a little choppy at times. Anyone else experience that at all?
---
The game runs choppy and slow in windows even on the best PC's adding linux/wine might further affect performance.
---
its so that it still deals damage so that a warrior/thief can’t just stealth stack a warrior that then goes into rampage and CCs you from stealth
---
GBoard does that for me... What keyboard are you using?  I never click suggestions except for the rare occasions where it doesn't know what my random letters translates to.
---
Huh. Maybe that’s what’s causing the frame rate drops for me too. I’ll need to check that next time I’m online. Thanks!
---
GW barely touches the GPU and i9 should carry it just fine.
---
Revive traits are basically pvp nerf collateral for wvw. In fact, these chanegs are pretty much to nerf rezzing and escaping by jumping off cliffs with fall damage traits.
---
Ok. So it's not just me. I will stick with my Ranger!
---
Thanks
---
&gt;change my mind
---
Instabilities LOL
---
Nah it's true. Have to incorporate it when you down any time something glances in your general direction. &lt;11k hp light armor life.
---
Nope! The nice thing about Rangers is at least they have a ranged option! I rolled Guardian as my first class, and jumped right into PoF story content. Let’s just say I won’t do that again!
---
I'm chill. Just voicing my opinion. It is worth noting that the "one dev" is responsible for a lot of the game. I know at the end of the day "it's just a video game," but it's where I made a lot of my current friends and have made a lot of memories.
---
I have a bank full of exotic gear. Endless possibilities. Although I am guessing there is some new stuff introduced since then
---
I played d/d ele before the expansions, I stopped having fun long before 2017.
---
They've also forgotten about the fact that Aurene is the new god of war.
---
If you go into gfx settings and set render sampling to super sample, that renders the game at a higher resolution and then downscales it, if your system is struggling with that, its not going to do well with 4k. GW2 is also pretty cpu intensive, if you are at 100% cpu while playing the game (or even over 70% if you have hyper threading enabled) then you are cpu bound and getting a new cpu will get you higher fps.
---
I have been 4k gaming for 5 years now since the RTX 295x2 came out. That card is as powerful as the GTX 1080 is (which I now have, 295x2 broke).
---
You are not going to get 60fps in a lot of games at 4k with a GTX 1080 (And from the looks of it, your gfx card is a little slower, not too familiar with it). You need SLI right now to get consistent 60fps in highly demanding gfx intensive games, however, GW2 isn't a demanding game. I get high fps, often times 60fps at 4k (and I only play GW2 in 4k).
---
When I first got a 4k monitor 5 years ago, it was like the monitor was a window, looking outside, the detail is definitely there if you are not used to using one, find a 4k resolution background and you will see the difference.
---
If you are going to get a 4k monitor I would recommend not skimping on screen size and getting the biggest you can afford (you will have this monitor for 5-10 years), the bigger the screen the more you can take advantage of the high resolution. Windows is going to scale the UI so everything looks just like your 1080p monitor but things will just have more pixels and be sharper. The bigger screen you have the lower you can comfortably set that scale in display settings so you can have more screen real estate (down to 1x, so its like having 4x 1080p screens). Personally, I have pretty good eyes so I can tolerate 1x scale when writing software for work on my 28" monitor but for general web browsing the text is too small and I zoom inside browser to 150%.
---
If you are going to get the 4k *just for gaming*, I wouldn't do it if its going to push your budget because realistically, you need a pretty expensive GPU to power 4k 60fps in other games, the real benefit of having a 4k screen is having more screen real estate for getting work done, a 1440p screen is going to be good enough for gaming and if you can find one with a higher refresh rate (120+) in your budget I would personally get that instead. If I didn't write software, I could do with a 1440p screen.
---
Ascended weapons are cost efficient through collections, and ascended trinkets are pretty easy to get too.  Have a look at wooden potatoes open world build series.  They are specifically made for open world and story.  There is one for each class and a hearing video too.
---
Something that these exists as another means to track bots. B/c the bots can see the nodes via their programming and searching, while a real human would just use their own eyes or game interface which doesn't show them (often).
---
I honestly think they should just go ahead and compile the LFG maps like they did with dailies. No reason to have an entry for each LS3 map when nobody even organizes groups on them anymore. Should be Classic, Heart of Thorns, Season 3, Path of Fire, Season 4, and then Icebrood Saga can stay up for now until we've done enough on those maps.
---
What multiple other MMO's put out significantly more content at a significantly faster pace? I've played many MMO's over the past 15 years, and GW2 hasn't ever felt like it stood out as particularly slow compared to the rest. Even WoW has content droughts as long as 1.5 years leading up to expansions.
---
A lot of it just comes down to knowing the enemies
---
Many players are getting a buff with this update...
---
&gt; Necromancer
---
&gt; Added an additional health cost of 50% of base health to this skill. 
---
I'm tired of skills that cause self damage. I'm sorry to all my fellow players, but if we're in the middle of a boss fight, I can't justify sacrificing a huge part of my health just to revive someone.
---
I don't PvP but if you're arguing for buffing the gyros for my Scrapper main I'm all for it.
---
&gt; "Dodging is a DPS loss."
---
When I play healer I hate these players with a passion. Sooner or later I’m gonna give up and let their ass die.
---
The reason Engies &amp; Eles received this weapon-swap buff was probably to equalise the spaces took up by each class across the board for the sake of balancing build template usage as to not appear as an unfair disadvantage. Probably.
---
My Sword/Shield, Rifle Holo is now extremely pleased. Now if we could get a second condi weapon set.. (and perhaps make it potent enough to be meta..)
---
Hell yeah :)  The update no one asked for but everyone wanted.  See?  - ANET cares &lt;3
---
&gt; Druid lost their ability to provide consistent stability. 
---
This was the second reason I learned HB. The first reason was for quickness spam. In Druid only or HB only groups, there’s a significant difference in speed run time. 
---
That being said, Druid is still ok for first time healers learning healing provided they have a spare set of equips lying around. They’re much easier to play compared to HB. HB is still ultimately the better choice though.
---
I don't know why in-combat movement speed is even a thing. If it were the real world, you wouldn't slow down just because the muggers were trying to catch you.
---
I agreed with it though because Elementalists have 4 attunements that mean 20 skills on weapons where as with weapon swap other classes have 10. Engis have kits maybe the argument could be made for weapon swap on engi. I think they made the right choice making it out of combat.
---
Necros really need a good ranged weapon. (staff is trash unless you just want to mash 1 while you're waiting for your niche wells to cool down)
---
Honestly better off reviving them normally
---
Ah, good point.
---
The problem is I don't have to talk about a game to enjoy it. And I think both of the last two episodes were exciting. They were exciting to me. They may not have been exciting to you and that's okay. But saying there's nothing exciting going on?
---
I'll go out on a limb and say that far more people get excited over living story stuff than a new raid.  Just a guess, but it's a pretty good one.
---
Who knows? Maybe Jon starts his Druid at level 1.
---
Could still use a portal like the one at Silverwastes-&gt;Verdant Brink or Divinity's Reach-&gt;Lake Doric that prevents access if conditions are not met. It's just kinda frustrating that the world is feeling more and more like instanced dungeons instead of an open world.
---
Meanwhile, at the release of the episode, the Boneskinner's HP was scaled so low that you didn't need to break his bar, you could phase him from 75% to 50% before he'd kill an NPC, which reset his breakbar and his "kill an NPC" timer back to the start, at which point you'd phase him from 50% to 25% before he'd do it, and so on.  The achievement was very easy to get then...
---
With over 6 years of playing GW2 i can probably consider myself a veteran.  
---
And i don't really see a reason to be a doomsayer.   
---
Yeah, templates were implemented not in the best way possible (or in good way for someone who used 3rd party tools), but they still were implemented. Things promised in April - legendary runes and cooking 500 were also added, i agree that they're taking too long with Swiss tournaments and Alliances, but at the same time the living story was still nice, even though the last episode was kinda small, but the map, the story, the soundtrack, the achievements, the new strikes were great, and if they will keep up with the pace and will make a single chapter every 2 months like they did between the prologue and the episode 1, i'm absolutely okay with that.   
---
So yeah, if people tell me that the game is dead or dying now, then while Season 2 and 9 months after, when there was almost no content for 9 months, until HoT came out, it probably should have been, at the very least, in the purgatory.
---
Scepter is one weapon that needs an elite spec, yes. Along with pistol, focus and mace.
---
Good class choices for scepter:
---
Engineer - shock mage. Scrapper is a bruiser, holosmith is a true DPS. So this would HAVE to be a supportive spec or ranged lockdown spec.
---
Revenant - any magic legend. Revenant already has most niches filled, but a proper range power DPS would work.
---
For the other classes that don't have scepter, it's a bit harder:
---
Ranger - nature mage has been done with druid, perhaps a nature summoner class could work.
---
Thief - shadow mage? This would mechanically infringe a bit on Mesmer so it's not an ideal weapon to add over something like axe. I disagree with adding ranged weapons to thief anyway.
---
Warrior - smackdown mage. Just beat people with the scepter lol. Tbh, scepter belongs on Warrior the least.
---
It finished downloading this afternoon, that seems to have helped. Got another suggestion to lower a character setting, too. Thanks for your response.
---
Perhaps at a high enough mastery, you'll find yourself able to throw yourself at the ground and miss.
---
There is 1 time its spawned infront of me and i got 1 hit :)
---
This is exactly right.
---
Easiest is to keep the group small. It's actually very similar to Vinetooth Prime.
---
First I've heard of it, will investigate, thanks!
---
Thanks, much appreciated.
---
Still very easy with a small group. That is how I got it on my second account. Just happened to be doing it late at night.
---
They are literally "just number changes".
---
The functionality is exactly the same. The difference is the number.
---
"Out of combat only" means not while match in progress, no?
---

---
Guardian is currently the best dps but ok.
---
My point was that they added a main and offhand with that spec. Up to that point all specs had only given a weapon in one spot even if it could be used in both. For example, firebrand and mirage got axe mainland but there are classes that slot this in the offhand too. 
---
I do get your point about warrior but it doesn't negate my point about them being able to add a main and offhand weapon with an elite spec if they want to.
---
The passive does look nice though, just never use the signet and you're good. But there's also better skills to equip so rip
---
What stats do you use? If more damage run Berserkers for damage on Power and Maruaders for damage + HP again for Power.
---
I haven't really gotten into raids for this reason. I can't afford it and I'm usually too busy at work to have a set time to play with a training guild. I've just come to terms with the fact that I'll never see them, or get the legendary armor, and will just have to watch the story on youtube or something.
---
It actually applies only to the runner adventurer where you go to different points. The griffon adventures do NOT count
---
Im hoping if they are planning on adding more elite specs they would give mesmers warhorns and it would be something like a siren. Music related and draw in foes and stuff like that.
---
So which one is the easiest?  I did Refugee Supply Run in Crystal Desert, was not hard, but was somewhat lengthy.  Anyone have any others they like to do that are quicker?
---
Zerkers
---
Yes sorry. Understandably you're likely thinking of power vs condi.
---
I'm speaking thematically. Revenabt already has hammer as a ranged physical/power weapon. And mace/axe as a melee physical/Condi weapon. It also has magic themed support/healing power physical/melee weapon (staff)
---
Renegade added ranged physical/Condi weapon
---
Looking at it's archetypes. Shiro is a quick assassin melee. Jalis is tanky support and dps. Mallyx is Condi melee dps. Ventari is melee support healer. Glint is a sort of hybrid. Renegade is a ranged condi dps.
---
What it doesn't have thematically is a spellcaster archetype. More dps focused spellcasting (either condi or power) with a magical theme.
---
It's not april wtf
---
Wait. Elementalists and engineers couldn't swap weapons while _out_ of combat?
---
I’m willing to bet that fall dmg reduction will be back in form of of some future mastery.
---
What great advice? I posted and got 3 responses,which I replied to. Kill faster,gear and reroll because melee is tough. Then I went out.
---
I do fine on my Ranger. It's mostly from range. All I was asking is how do pure melee do it when it's constant pbaoe .
---
Severance, this is my advice after reading some of your comments.
---
Admit when you're wrong and stop doing drugs.
---
Patch next week :P told you so!
---
Next week patch! I told you so ;)
---
&gt;which were caused by NCSoft intervention
---
Months later and still people are saying this lie.
---
NCSoft intervined BECAUSE ArenaNet was diverting funds and resources into whatever their side projects were and allowing GW2 to fail more and more. NCSoft had even given ANet near complete control of the game, NCS was pretty much just a name while Anet was allowed to do as they saw fit and THEY betrayed that trust in the end by moving so much away from the game.
---
&gt; More revealed skills could use being PBAoE. For example, "Nothing Can Save You!"
---
Soo fitting, damn.
---
Costs are going up, income going down. Investors want their money back, owners want a retirement. Game is getting harder to get profit from, workers increasingly want more then can be given.
---
Actually not at all hard to see how we got here from there.
---
They'll still drink it. The fanbase for games like GW2 and Warframe are extremely deluded.
---
When the game closes, what are the "this is completely normal" guys gonna say? "It was an old game, this is still normal!"?
---
I will never understand the hard-on developers have for removing layers of gameplay.
---
I wish he never stopped making videos...
---
There are two types of core Rangers in WvW: those who barrage into my reflect and those who shut me down at 1500 range and curbstomp me before I have a chance to realize that they're actually competent.
---
I think easy to learn, hard to master fits the class perfectly.
---
I always liked warrior scepter as a support option. Warlord empowerment.
---
Rangers already stole from eles when they got glyphs and a form change
---
&gt;but it seems abundantly clear that story releases with maps is the only thing GW2 has to look forward to once the WvW update lands.
---
And now not even that since Jason was one of the leads and he already left.
---
I mean...Wells are more a Chronomancer/Necromancer thing. I'm mostly going for the storm theme here.
---
It used to give personal credit for the bugged version (open world) even after the instanced one came out, but at some point that changed.
---
Guild missions are very buggy and exploitable.
---
&gt;For those who believe the game is dying: Just wait and see. I do believe we are going to get great things in this saga. 
---
This is delusion to the most extreme level right here.
---
play reaper and never be defeated because no one will let you into their group :(
---
There are more reasons to use Shortbow than 5? :p
---
Rather see this premise with a Short bow they hold like a harp, floating about and playing their siren chords. Call it a Dirgecaller, haunting plucking of strings that ensnare the hearts and minds of their foes
---
GS for everyone :D
---
That's far from true.
---
There are more than a handful of specs that require support from allies to be strong.
---
At launch I was zerging in WvW and I was the noob that traited for fall damage. Apparently so did the commander as he and I and a couple others survived jumping down the cliff. The rest of the zerg on the other hand...
---
There won't be anymore elite specs, man.
---
But, if we're speaking hypotheticals, the only spec that it would make sense for would be like a Ritualist specialization for Revenant with a Master Togo Legend Stance.
---
&gt;Icebrood has only been out for a week now, but already at least 10% of players have Eternal Ice in this account on Efficiency. Meanwhile, PoF Raids have been out for over two years now, and less than 10% have any Divinations 
---
to their account. 
---
So, the same 10% of players that do raids are those that have eternal ice? You're not raising a compelling argument here. Can you give me population numbers over time?
---
Diivinations provide replayable rewards while eternal ice is one and done.
---
&gt;And of course Efficiency would tend to skew more in favor of raiders than casuals.
---
Why?
---
&gt;I answered that question in the same paragraph you snipped from.
---
So, random irrelevant bad guy of the week that was introduced and killed in the same episode.
---
&gt;I was referring to hour+ dramas. It took me about an hour and a half to two hours, start to finish.
---
I mean sure, if you want to finish the story by autoattacking only go ahead, but don't be fooled into thinking most people won't use their skills.
---
&gt;Quantity of content is objectively measurable.
---
&gt; Never.
---
&gt; Only quantity can be objective
---
I think its actually very important that you learn what you type and what you reply to. 
---
&gt;Mature.
---
Changing the name of something doesn't change its inherent qualities.
---
&gt;Again, subjective.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2y8Sx4B2Sk
---
 There's entire schools of thought, institutions and universities devoted to studying and quantifying literature throughout history. I don't know where you heard this bs that writing quality cannot be quantified.
---
&gt;Yes, it is.
---
I legitimately find it funny that the only way you can call gw2's plot good is by pretending birdemic is equal to citizen kane. Really says something about how bad it is.
---
&gt;Some of them can be quantified, such as "number of jokes per minute," or whatever, but the value of each quantity is subjective, just as you can measure how much sugar to put into a cake, but whether the cake is "too sweet" or "not sweet enough" is still entirely a subjective position.
---
A cake filled with shit is a bad cake. It doesn't mater if you like it because you're a coprophiliac. Its still a bad cake.
---
&gt;Again, the people canned were mostly not working on GW2.
---
That explains why content releases for gw2 have gotten smaller and slower.
---
&gt;It was a studio re-organization, not a change to the game itself. We still don't know exactly what they were working on. And again, personnel changes happen all the time, there isn't necessarily anything crazy going on, unless you really want something crazy to be going on because it validates your biases.
---
The 3 biggest people for the game, including the founder, and the lead designer for the living saga you're so adamant on defending have quit within the same month. This does not happen all the time. You'd have to be delusional to pretend that everything is fine.
---
90% of the gamemodes have never been updated, the recent two releases were starved and expansions are cancelled, several lead devs have quit the game, hundreds of people have been fired and you still want to pretend that everything is fine.
---
Whats so bad about Anet? From how i have seen, gw2 is great. Plenty of things to do. I been playing on and off since gw2 was released. I did quit for about 2 to 3 years before going back to it casually. I have no idea how raids works and i cant even do cm fractal. But thats ok, i spend about 1hr each night just catching up on story or doing map exploration on different character. I have a full time work which requires me to go to bed early and wake up early. But im still trying my best to have fun in the game. 
---
Please educate me as to why Anet is doing bad.
---
It sounded like you were saying that an argument could be made to change it, no that you thought an argument could be made as to why they changed it. Your wording is ambiguous
---
So, the same 10% population of players that do raids are those that have eternal ice?  Can you give me population numbers over time?
---
Neverminding that, divinations provide replayable rewards while eternal ice is one and done, because after you do it, grats, you're done! See in 4 months.
---
You're not raising a compelling argument here.
---
What about an egg?
---
I’ve played since launch and played lots of fractals but never heard of that bear form thingy before 😄
---
Neverminding that, divinations provide replayable rewards while eternal ice is one and done, because after you do it, grats, you're done! See in 4 months. Like you know. The difference between an MMO and a singleplayer game. Which is gw2 again?
---
So, the same 10% population of players that do raids are those that have eternal ice? Like, you do realize that its possible to do both raids and open world right? Can you give me population numbers over time?
---
Neverminding that, divinations provide replayable rewards (like an mmo) while eternal ice is one and done (like a singleplayer campaign game), because after you do it, grats, you're done! See in 4 months. 
---
You know, the massive difference between an MMO and a singleplayer game. Which is gw2 again?
---
I thought those were only for the icebrood saga hero? The discount is included as well?
---
lmao yes I got that a few times in caledon forest, mostly. So strange.
---
I roleplay as a pirate so I've always wanted to have a sword, specifically a rapier, on my necro.
---
Literally no  bot exists in prime na . Trust me I understand what you're dayin but that's anet problem game is dead because no pvp updates few no new modes nothing. Of course it's just gonna be bots eventually in something not supported
---
The game has gotten so content starved that people now consider a balance patch content.
---
I’m the same as normally I can only play mornings ☹️
---
But Warframe is growing not drying up. GW2 to an extent is, just very very slowly. Like the Ottoman Empire of MMO's.
---
I use a period when I want to indicate a full stop.
---
Wow 350g?
---
As was already suggested Wooden Potatoes has some great (though lengthy) content. Here is his current [PvE build playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdxmChRD2epfS9j4gS8D-tdQbPAajODOv) I'd also suggest watching his movement of the world videos ([part 1](https://youtu.be/g35ug27Iz34), [part 2](https://youtu.be/O4c02x0h2U4), [discussion on it](https://youtu.be/49pm8FX9858)) the discussion part has some story spoilers spoilers (season 2, HoT, and 3) in it though. If you're interested in PvP his second channel has a bunch of [gameplay](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuEuQiXhSXllCvOU-TtRJLaBuLI7m1V8) and [guides](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOuEuQiXhSXkqgAcMlEnLHowr96zzxipv). I also have [a guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) that you might find some use in and now that you're level 80 I do like [Nike's video on End game content](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsZApZ-JV-o).
---
&gt;I was mostly railing against the idea that the whole spec is garbage enough to need a ground-up rebuild...
---
Aye. TBH it's the only thing I enjoy on the regular. But yah, function and sneak gyros need a new focus.
---
Elementalists had multiple weapon sets, through attunement. Engineers had multiple weapon sets only through kits, which were completely hit-and-miss.
---
I'll PM you one.
---
If anyone reading this needs a code as well, I have 3 more
---
T3 is the trench... Be strong friend. Try to ask your guild for help to get your fractal level high enough to skip to t4.
---
It is the same as having weapons in inventory and trading them, except now you have a slot for it. Its a very good QoL update for one of my favourite classes.
---
Why doesnt guildwars2.com link directly to this?
---
Spot*. Singular.
---
And who are they to decide where it was useful for players and where it weren't? What about WvW? What about PvP? What about instances? What about every other JP that prohibits gliding and/or mounts?
---
Yeah, I want one now.
---
Isn't this is the same mini as the alienware giveaway?
---
condi chrono
---
Yep. Eles and engis always run the first weapons they ever equipped because they can't unequip them, which is why never see them running elite spec weapons.
---
Warrior slapping stick let's do this.
---
Okay, so you totally unaware of how the MMO market works and worked in the past: the customers of 2012 are not the customers of 2019. This game outside of reddit and some vg portal is not well known, and since as I said the game is 7yo, usually the softcos won't spend much money on marketing.
---
And, before you jump to any conclusion, I'm probably one of the most active player in the game.
---
ArenaNet? Tracking bots? Haha, you must be new here. Next you're going to tell me is that they're banning bots too? Hilarious!

These are not the expansion (the ones that are purchased through the website or official retailers), just the "deluxe upgrade" (that can be bought inside the game, through Gem Store and require a standard edition already purchased).

---
This is an amazing write up. Your knowledge of the lore is really impressive and I really like the ideas you’ve put forward!
---
the spawn locations are actually identical to normal nodes (also rich ore -&gt; rich candycorn)
---
With the number of groups going on LFG, they can just shift everything into a few categories
---
1: Open World - Parties (Include mentor) 
---
2: Open World - Squads
---
3: Festivals / Achievements
---
4: SPvP and Tournaments
---
5: WvW (Seperate lists for worlds) 
---
6: Fractals (All, don't seperate t1-t4) 
---
7: Instanced - Parties (includes dungeon)
---
I rather shift through maybe 10 groups than to see no group in 90% of categories.
---
It’s always been odd that a class can use greatsword but not sword.
---
Ooooh, so that's the reason patch is early Dec instead of end of Nov
---
lol
---
Has that been soaking in a stagnant pool of water filled with rotting corpses as well?
---
&gt;So, the same 10% population of players that do raids are those that have eternal ice? Like, you do realize that its possible to do both raids and open world right? Can you give me population numbers over time?
---
The point is that players have had a year to do ANY of the PoF raids, and 90% of players have not done ANY. The HoT raid figures don't look a lot better, with almost nobody having any raid mats at all. 
---
&gt; Neverminding that, divinations provide replayable rewards (like an mmo) while eternal ice is one and done (like a singleplayer campaign game), because after you do it, grats, you're done! See in 4 months. 
---
But it doesn't have to last forever, it only has to last until the next patch, which it does for most players. I mean, there's only so much time in the day, even if ANet somehow managed to design a game in which there were 40+ maps that were each equally "evergreen," nobody would have time to do more than 1-2 of them per day, so there's nothing wrong with players tending to gravitate towards a few of them, or mostly farming the newest one. 
---
All the new content needs to do is provide enough of a player experience to keep players engaged until the next content comes along, in this case Wintersday. If it's done that, then it has been successful. 
---
&gt;Why?
---
Because *true* casuals would not bother with attaching an API to a site to track their account data, or even know what any of that means. People who do so are at least slightly less casual than the casual end of the graph, so any results on that site should be considered "a bit more serious than most." 
---
&gt;So, random irrelevant bad guy of the week that was introduced and killed in the same episode.
---
Yes. This is how an episode works. You resolve the small, self contained issue of the moment, whether that is a villain, a mystery, a strategic objective, etc., while setting up the larger conflict. Again, I have faith in you that you fully understand this, but continue to argue it for petulant reasons because you want to pretend there are "objective" reasons to not like this update beyond your own personal opinions. Don't answer this one, because I don't expect you to agree, and doing otherwise would just make you look bad at this point.
---
&gt;I mean sure, if you want to finish the story by autoattacking only go ahead, but don't be fooled into thinking most people won't use their skills.
---
I used all my normal skills, it's not like the boss fight itself is what took the majority of that time. I just listened to what everyone was saying, read the dialog presented, explored the areas around me at each step, explored the map and did events during the more open world portions, I started around 6PM and finished around 8:20 or so. I imagine I could have speedrun it faster, but I wouldn't want to, at least not the first time through.
---
&gt;I think its actually very important that you learn what you type and what you reply to. 
---
Then I hope you achieve it some day. I'm rooting for you!
---
&gt;There's entire schools of thought, institutions and universities devoted to studying and quantifying literature throughout history. I don't know where you heard this bs that writing quality cannot be quantified.
---
Rating anything is not an objective process. It is a subjective one. The film that wins "best picture" at the Oscars is not *objectively* better than Charlie's Angels, it's just the movie that a few thousand people working in the film industry agreed that *they* thought was better. It's a consensus of opinion, which is still opinion, not fact. A cake can objectively have "the most calories," or "the highest chocolate content," but it cannot objectively be "the best tasting" or the "worst tasting," those are purely subjective experiences, no matter how many agree or disagree. 
---
&gt;I legitimately find it funny that the only way you can call gw2's plot good is by pretending birdemic is equal to citizen kane. Really says something about how bad it is.
---
I figure it's somewhere in between. It's not the best game writing out there, but it's good enough, better than many others. I mean, it's better than WoW, at least.
---
&gt;A cake filled with shit is a bad cake. It doesn't mater if you like it because you're a coprophiliac. Its still a bad cake.
---
I mean, it would be objectively *unhealthy,* I suppose. And the vast majority of people would likely not enjoy it, so if your goal is to make a cake that most people would enjoy, then you would have failed at that goal. I'm by no means suggesting that anyone *should* make such a cake, *subjectively* I wouldn't want to eat it, but no, *objectively* there is nothing good or bad you could say about the taste. 
---
&gt;That explains why content releases for gw2 have gotten smaller and slower.
---
Again though, 2019 had the most released of most previous years. The only ones that were compeititve would be the actual launch of the game and *maybe* the years that included expansions (although outside the actual expansions, those years tended to see a slowdown in other content).  
---
I don't think there's anything sinister in a game studio splitting their focus, most studios of a certain size do work on multiple projects at once, and there's no harm in that. The amount of people they had working on GW2 before the layoffs seemed to be an acceptable amount, given what they were producing. From reports at the time of the layoffs, most of those removed were the ones working on other, then cancelled projects, and the staff assigned to GW2 actually went *up* after that. Also, you only talk about people being fired or leaving, but they have also *hired* new people, which is the nature of game development, people come and go all the time. Again, if you could pinpoint for me "this person was personally responsible for writing this scene, or building that jumping puzzle," then I might be a bit sadder to see them go, but when most devs are only broadly responsible for wide systems, I just can't work up the energy to care.
---
&gt;"We don't know what they were working them."
---
&gt;"Them being fired doesn't mater and didn't affect the company because what they worked on wasn't important."
---
&gt;Pick one.
---
The point was that *whatever* the fired devs were working on, it wasn't GW2, so the loss of it is irrelevant to GW2 players. I am *curious* to find out what these games were, but it wouldn't impact GW2 any.
---
&gt;The 3 biggest people for the game, including the founder, and the lead designer for the living saga you're so adamant on defending have quit within the same month. This does not happen all the time. You'd have to be delusional to pretend that everything is fine.
---
Again, it does happen all the time, especially to older developers who get tired of working on the same project all the time. 
---
&gt;90% of the gamemodes have never been updated, the recent two releases were starved and expansions are cancelled, several lead devs have quit the game, hundreds of people have been fired and you still want to pretend that everything is fine.
---
The "gamemodes that haven't been updated" were the ones nobody was playing, and it's **better** for the game that resources are being directed elsewhere, so *yes,* that is a very good thing.
---
The recent 2 releases, I liked, and we'll have to see what the next few have to bring. 
---
And the next expansion was taken off the table before any of this internal drama hit, this was not a "panic mode," it was the plan for this period in time. You don't agree with their plan, but I like it. In theory. The execution, we'll both have to wait and see how it plays out. 
---
&gt;Like, let me re-iterate. The lead designer for the SAGA has quit the company in the middle of the saga's development. And you think this is completely uneventful and unimportant. This is beyond parody. The lead designer (i.e. most important person for this phase of the game) for singular thing anet is putting all their eggs in just quit and you want to pretend this isn't bad news.
---
Again, we don't know how much he contributed, or who is replacing him. It's not like he was single-handedly doing all the work, he was in a *management* role, coordinating many *other* people who were doing work. Now *maybe* he was a very hands on director, and all the great (or terrible) decisions were entirely his own. Or maybe he was very moderate, and most of the actual content was produced by people lower in the chain, and his contribution was more in coordinating them and keeping them on task. That varies entirely company to company, person to person. It's impossible to tell which was the case based only on publicly available information. This might turn out to be a bad thing, with the replacement person not doing as good a job. It is equally likely that it will turn out to be a good thing, with the replacement doing a better job. Time will tell.
---
Sorry for the number of players actually raiding and playing it is not. This screenshot is a very common occurrence. 
---
The flowers can down vote all they want but that won't change the facts. I play daily and monitor the LFG frequently.
---
Peak Performance would like to have a word with you
---
Just get legendary armor from PvP/WvW and call it a day. Won't include "fancy" skin but hey, who cares about skins when pursuing legendary...
---
The previous user's point remains though, the world picks a certain percent of nodes to make into normal ore nodes, and if it is time for the event the script runs when nodes respawn and will glitch them into being flagged as "make". Your client will catch this brief input, and display the node for a little bit before the next tick comes along and corrects it.
---
They theoretically could, but that's not how it works.
---
A program (bot) would move towards the node, then stop when the node respawns and continue it's scan for others -- just like a real human.
---
I totally forgot how good this video is 😄
---
Well living story is shit so maby hire someone who isn't uninspired and boring
---
Yes, bonus items is the same, interesting is, in oficial announcement was not mentioned that 10% discount code, not sure if it was added later or was there from begining
---
Guild Wars 1 had Health Sacrifice as a resource for Necromancer. It’s in there for thematics.
---
Also Spam buffed curses and send your condis using plague signet.
---
Click on the second dialogue option when interacting with the instance-portal-banner. They forgot to update that one with HoT, and it still starts the event in open world.
---
Engineer would be awesome with scepter (or mace), some kind of lightning / electricity based skills.
---
Time for you all to learn to jump. Portals to many endchest of JPs are now not longer posible.
---
Yeah but it **said** it grants revival speed. Since no one, apparently not even the devs, ever **checks** whether something does what it says, clearly so far it improved revival speed! 😂
---
No it's not. A two-handed Sword works like a long, sharp Lever where the Handle is the short End which you want to turn as fast as possible to maximize the Effect of the "long Part". A one-handed Sword works more as an sharp and pointy Extention of your Arm and therefore uses other Techniques.
---
Falling damage traits too complex! New players were being confused by this concept of falling by walking of a ledge.
---
Next up:
---
* Removal of falling damage.
---
* Still too complicated, all corners now have invisible walls to prevent falling.
---
* Players still die from falling, cushions added on all grounds.
---
Thanks. And bik is sorta returned, because I saw this video in his gw2 stream 2 days ago.
---
I too am going to miss something that hasn't been happening much for a couple of years.
---
Itll be ran in pve more than in wvw because shroud generation. You just wont use the active unless actually necessary. 
---
It couldn't be buffed more because heal scourge is already the strongest revive spec in the game, literally advertised as the way to carry bad players through content.
---
And I dont really see the issue. On heal scourge you can get 50% of your hp back up before your barrier runs out... 
---
On dps scourge (if the lifegen can be used to increase dps at a level comparable to other dps utilities), that means the dps scourge build gains more utility at little to no cost. 
---
This change might make bad scourges use transfusion, well of blood and F key instead of signet first. Clearly this is a change to help bad scourges l2p. Ty EAnet.
---
What it should be? Who gets to decide that? 
---
There was a lotro dev that, after he left the company, said that only 10% of the game's population ever PvPed or raided, but those people accounted for 50% of all forum posts.  
---
When Lotro decided a few years back to move away from raids, people said what you're saying. This is dying so the game is going to die, but it's not what happened.
---
The fact is, living world isn't actually one thing. It's story sure, but it's also open world stuff, metas, new maps, achievements and collections.  You have no idea how many people are into those things, and for that matter neither do I. 
---
But you know who does know how many people play those areas of the game? Anet. 
---
It's possible that the hard core PvPers and WvWers only represent a small part of the community, as well as raiders. I don't know for sure but I suspect that's the case. Keep in mind this game didn't even have raids for 3.5 years, or roughly half it's existence. It wasn't dying before raids were released, why would it be dying now if they weren't being updated?
---
People who don't play the content I play see it as a couple of hours of story and maybe a meta event, but it's a whole living world that some of us are here for? How many of us? I have no idea.
---
But Anet apparently feels it's enough people to drive the game, or they wouldn't be doing it.  
---
The game may have never been as strongly PvP centric as you think it is, and it certainly wasn't raid-centric for the first 3.5 years. No one really gets to decide what the game should be but Anet.
---
This game may cease to exist for you as the game it should be. But if they added raids and fractals and more PvP and WvW, it wouldn't change my game much at all.
---
There are still casual players that jump into WvW or PvP and have no clue that that game is dying either. You might think it is. A lot of people here might. But I've seen threads right here on reddit with people saying the love the PvP. 
---
It's dying for the top 5%. They're called the top 5% for a reason. I doubt it's dying for the bottom 50%.
---
Try CLL, I heard they are the best Kappa
---
I've been using the gear templates as a keybound OOC weapon swap for ele in the absence of actual weapon-swapping, so it'll be nice to free that back up.
---
The same was true for the fall damage aspect. These traits were noob traps more often than not. Chosen by people who want to be unique and special even if they arent useful. Because the fall portion of the traits wasnt useful unless it was bugged.
---
Yes, fractals are peak endgame content and so are raids and big "hard" worldbosses like Triple Trouble and Tequatle (before nerf).
---
But one can only do them 100, 200, maybe 300times before they get stale and lose their thrill.
---
So as long as Anet does´nt bring new CM´s or other things of that kind, even the "peak endgame content" dies down eventualy.
---
Peak endgame content needs to be developed to stay peak endgame content. Anet just doesnt do that since 2017 (Releaseyear of 100cm)
---
But thats just a grumpy veterans perspective i guess...
---
What I meant is that they don't even try to optimize their engine to use something newer than dx9 on windows why would they "optimize" their engine to run on mobile phones ?
---
While I could find the Boneskinner more challenging, quite a few players do. I've had to explain what CCs are pretty much every single time I tag up during that event, because people don't know. I've seen it fail quite a few times. The game just does not explain things to players well.
---
It's not? You go back to what you had in October but without aoe around you. It's the same as before
---
That the game isn't complete shit like people like to write.
---
valve would just make a new ui that uses up 3 times the ram and looks like it was designed for mobile in 2010 :D
---
Yeah but instead add 100% recharge rate increase for WvW.. the only thing you gain from this is a 120 radius increase.  It is not worth going for after the change.
---
What about mace or hammer ?
---
stop sniffing glue
---
Dota2. Completely no gear/lvl progression so only your skill and team matters, all heroes permanently unlocked, only cosmetics in store. You're welcome.
---
whats wrong with them anyway, bought some at the beginning
---
I made my personal guild to be able to decorate stuff there :D would be cool if gathering nodes were there also
---
Like I said, make your own. I'm on EU too. I'm doing daily fractals across different tiers. It is *not* an issue.
---
Make a party and describe want you want. Dailies + recommended always works, at any tier. Tier 1 you can open a noob friendly group "Casual fractals any welcome". I'm running achievements for ad infinitum right now. That's what it says in my description, I still find people.
---
&gt; to cheese it :p
---
I see what you did there.
---
MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA MUDA
---
Open your own squad.
---
They are no next elit specs dude
---
Im PvE player, patch almost didnt touch me. Also great part of changes impact fall dmg traits. So its minor balance. True balance patch will appear on January/February, with far longer list of changes, impacting also PvE
---
* All ledges have been removed from the game.
---
Idk maybe I played at a time something new came out and people were gone from fractals for a bit. Well doesnt matter anyway since I stopped playing a while ago and its looking like the game will reach its final stage soon
---
And as a larger balance patch, that will be the -only- large PvP patch of the year. It’s still not quarterly.
---
The skill category is called corruption. You can't seriously compare 50% heal sacrifice with some conditions that you can transfer. Ever played gw1?
---
Yes, dual skills are on slot 3. Rifle, shortbow and staff don't have dual skills.
---
Several professions have skills that let them take 0 damage from hits for a few seconds like [endure pain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Endure_Pain) (or the trait [defy pain](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Defy_Pain_\(warrior_trait\))) for warrior, [signet of stone](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Signet_of_Stone) on ranger, or even mirage's [mirage cloak](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mirage_Cloak_\(effect\)). It would help to know what you were playing against but most of these options only last a few seconds and in the case of the first two you can still apply conditions and CC them.
---
You should probably stop trying to communicate using internet in general. I don't even know where to begin lol
---
afaik you couldn't use the tokens
---
They're still both MMOs
---
they did fix them
---
Hey man, I'm not Vallun and I share this here as people on his discord happen to often do for his videos. You can probably get more people to discuss with you on the video comments, or on his discord.
---
But yeah, it looks pretty fun! Vallun is probably the only dude insane enough to try off-meta things for memes in a Ranked season, at his rating.
---
Hans runs his site with a very strong opinion on what is "meta", and that is what is probably keeping the build list on the single digits. Not going to comment on his opinion - I haven't tried P/D myself.
---
I did, but to no end. Let's get serious, raids are no longer what they used to be. More and more players are quitting. Even fractals started to die.
---
That kind of sound like the ridiculous hoops to jump through like I had to do for an old Shatterer achievement, breaking crystals or whatever that was. It was more or less impossible to do when you got a full map of people because those things just died so quickly, and I had to resort to do this at 4 in the morning during a vacation at some point to have a dead enough map to get that done
---
I feel ya here, but like, Scrapper was PvP top tier just a bit ago. Also, "the only class with an invulnerable that doesn't let us do anything"? \*Cries in Herald\*
---
you bet! I would love to see it one day
---
that would be quite risky at many encounters:D
---
definitely:) I was thinking that maybe even sword could have some long-range attacks
---
Yes, that is exactly what I was thinking of. It is similar to concept of Firebrand's Tomes, just here you need life force to use them.
---
thank you so much! appreciate it! I have more ideas in the drawer so they will be out soon:)
---
nice!
---
I didn't make the name :')
---
that Is interesting. you got some links where I an check it out?
---
Streetlights, quaggans.
---
Another one of the great travesties of the game: Not updating and expanding guild missions and activities.
---
no worries, I get that! I know that people don't expect new things such as this and Arenanet is probably busy with other things:) Despite that I still like to share what I make and have discussions about what could be created.
---
I miss the no cap minion days when necro's were literally gods.
---
agreed. I would love to finally see necromancer in some action.
---
Has anyone managed to mine it?
---
&gt; Chaotic Interruption: Added additional visual effects to this trait to show when it activates. 
---
Mesmers, the disco globes of the game...
---
This remind me of the change they made to make skill runes in Diablo III, giving them different elements. It made many skills much more fun and created many new possible combinations.
---
To be honest, it started falling apart much much earlier than that, it seems like everything went to south right about PoF when they moved their expansion team to work on other projects. When they announced that there will be no expansion after season 4 it was already fucking suspicious. The way they did that, in an interview that almost nobody read, with no news about it on their official website was, too. I mean, if they were so sure about "expansion level content" in their new season, why hide it? Why not speak of it loud and proud?   
---
So no, I don't think it's a recent change, it all came to this piece by piece.
---
If you play a healer build as I do and the WHOLE team leaves you alone on an uncapped point, don't stay to cap. It's not your purpose, and you'll not often walk away alive from that point.   
---
If you have a healer on your team, just keep an eye out for them. It's easy to get distracted when a fight starts and they'll usually be a priority target for the ennemy.
---
Are u on NA? I had no problem pugging W7 on EU when it released.
---
Bots are way more common than afks nowadays :l
---
So negative posts filled with hyperbole or even outright misnformation are okay because you agree with them, but positive posts should be downvoted because they're bootlicking rather than positive. This is precisely what my post is about. This double standard. You're allowed to not like the game, but you're not allowed to like it.
---
But I thought Human Waifu was meta.
---
Hmm I don’t have trouble with my scrapper in PvP. You forget that Sanctuary rune exists and provides barrier equal to 20% of healing you receive. With the “damage grants barrier”, the bonus barrier trait, and the damage dampening trait, I don’t have any trouble staying alive and kiting 2-3 people. The problem I have with Scrapper actually is if you get caught without stability, you get stun locked to death. With the changes upcoming to elixirs (6s of stability nerfed down to 1s), that is going to be what actually kills scrapper.
---
As it currently stands, I have no issue bunkering with hammer.
---
AP is the only point
---
I'm still waiting for the longbow or shortbow to be useful..
---
I think we found the common denominator here.
---
Sunspear Staff looks alright too imo.
---
Except that gameplay impacts the lore. Or perhaps how players view aspects of the lore.
---
Nop. EU. But I am not talking about it when it was released. I am taking about it now, 4 months later.
---
I got celestial axe out of it /flex.
---
I haven't said it didn't happen in the past, literally listed servers which died because they stacked too much.
---
After I got the items for the last ring collection I've stopped stepping in the aerodrome anymore :))
---
The reaper necro is a good choice for wandering around HoT as a melee. I have mesmer, necro, thief, guardian, and ranger leveled up. Necro is the best bet for soloing things without having to worry about getting gibbed by a missed dodge or block. I've been spending a lot of time in HoT getting the specialization collections done and it really is easy mode compared to everything else.
---
Fa Ele PvP and FA Tempest in PvE.
---
Guard Power dps(sword slowey get the alternativ)
---
Necro WvW
---
or hammer, or rifle, or long bow, or mace
---
I think that WvW is the endgame content, or better said, should have been!
---
&gt; The point is that players have had a year to do ANY of the PoF raids, and 90% of players have not done ANY. The HoT raid figures don't look a lot better, with almost nobody having any raid mats at all.
---
The stats you gave said 10% have ice and 10% have done the raid. And yet again, the 10% who did the raid have a reason to stick around and do it again.
---
Those who completed the episode have no reason to stick around and do it again.
---
&gt;But it doesn't have to last forever, it only has to last until the next patch, which it does for most players. 
---
Except it does not for most players unless they're only auto attacking. The map is only finished once and most people do not mindlessly sit and grind the same repetitive piss easy events over and over.
---
&gt;true casuals
---
The fact that you made "true" in italics makes me really wonder whether or not you're an incredible elaborate troll. Either way, if those "true casuals" aren't even invested enough to hook up the API what makes you think they're invested enough to bother with the gemstore?
---
&gt;Yes. This is how an episode works. You resolve the small, self contained issue of the moment, whether that is a villain, a mystery, a strategic objective, etc., while setting up the larger conflict. 
---
Except in shows that do actually do this the next episode comes out the next week not the next quarter.
---
&gt;Again, I have faith in you that you fully understand this, but continue to argue it for petulant reasons because you want to pretend there are "objective" reasons to not like this update beyond your own personal opinions.
---
There absolutely are objective reasons to not like this update and I've given you several, but you're at the point where the founder of the company and multiple lead developers quiting after a dissapointing announcement and the cancellation of an expansion pack is considered "normal" so, I don't have high expectations.
---
&gt;Don't answer this one, because I don't expect you to agree, and doing otherwise would just make you look bad at this point.
---
Anyone with half a brain cell can see why this update is a joke.
---
&gt;Then I hope you achieve it some day. I'm rooting for you!
---
Lets check past statements:
---
Me:
---
You replying:
---
&gt;Never.
---
Also you in the same sentence as never:
---
&gt;Only quantity can be objective
---
Did you forget what you were replying to?
---
&gt;Rating anything is not an objective process. 
---
You're free to like shit but its still shit. Quality can be quantified, how much you like something in spite of its flaws is up to you, but whether or not the flaws are there is not up to you.
---
&gt;I figure it's somewhere in between.
---
Like I said, I can actually bring up multiple reasons why the writing is awful that are universal accross writing. Can you rebut any of them without having them with "I don't care about it, ergo it doesn't mater."
---
&gt;Again though, 2019 had the most released of most previous years.
---
Vapid and superficial content with no replay value. Its functionally dead content.
---
&gt;The point was that whatever the fired devs were working on, it wasn't GW2, so the loss of it is irrelevant to GW2 players. I am curious to find out what these games were, but it wouldn't impact GW2 any.
---
It shows that the company is not in a good state.
---
&gt;Again, it does happen all the time, especially to older developers who get tired of working on the same project all the time.
---
Multiple lead developers leaving within a month of each other after mass layoffs after expansion cancellations is not something that happens all the time.
---
&gt;The "gamemodes that haven't been updated" were the ones nobody was playing, and it's better for the game that resources are being directed elsewhere, so yes, that is a very good thing.
---
Its better for the game that resources are directed toward gamemodes with no replayability that players abandon after 30 minutes?
---
&gt;Again, we don't know how much he contributed, or who is replacing him. It's not like he was single-handedly doing all the work, he was in a management role, coordinating many other people who were doing work. Now maybe he was a very hands on director, and all the great (or terrible) decisions were entirely his own. Or maybe he was very moderate, and most of the actual content was produced by people lower in the chain, and his contribution was more in coordinating them and keeping them on task. That varies entirely company to company, person to person. It's impossible to tell which was the case based only on publicly available information. This might turn out to be a bad thing, with the replacement person not doing as good a job. It is equally likely that it will turn out to be a good thing, with the replacement doing a better job. Time will tell.
---
You are literally the only person who can spin multiple lead developers leaving within a month of each other after mass layoffs after expansion cancellations is not something that happens all the time as a good thing.
---
im gonna burst your bubble. im still playing and enjoying some of the content, yet im a black knight. DUN DUN DUUU
---
Mesmers giving all boons is an ancient technique.
---
 &gt; With a larger competitive-focused update on the horizon
---
Something to look forward to.
---
Anet can easily limit the transferring pandemic, but they won't, because the revenue they make from it is simply too sweet.
---
What is the point of re-links and "population balances" when players just transfer straight after to be with their bandwagon?
---
But anyway, none of this really matters because things are just going one way at this stage, it is merely a matter of time.
---
Passive condition removal are not that useful since you don't get to decide when to use them and may get wasted on a blind that you can easily lose with an autoattack, and downed health degen is counter-productive on PvP as it helps the enemy to keep you downed wasting time, in WvW it basically does nothing and it helps the enemy to use you to lure allies who may go to revive you and burst them, and in PvE it's always faster to just kill an enemy and rally.
---
Personally, I'd rather have no traits with effects while downed, and have players focus on not going down, and at most have skills and traits to support downed players to get them to leave downed.
---
What? In the picture you see the [UI at 4k](https://i.imgur.com/YEyeGM5.jpg) at normal scaling. This is perfectly readable.
---
Guild Wars 1 was not a MMO. Anet called it a corpg. It was a lobby game. You could only party with people in cities, but when you went out into the open world (end quote) you would only ever be with the people already in your party. It was a very different type of game.
---
you get out of combat inside a match if you don't engage with anyone, what.
---
NA raids lfg what a joke.
---
Big words for a dead content. I can bet that in 3-4 months we will see only sellers registered.
---
Or spike damage the necro and haul ass whilst the horde turns on literally anything that moves.
---
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't wiped my entire team a couple of times over the years. If I'm going down, I'm taking everyone else down with me.
---
&gt; Destroyer Wurms
---
Primordius makes whatever he wants with stones&amp;lava. Destroyer are not corrupted afaik. He just didn't think making wurm-shaped minions would be useful I guess ...
---
Sorry if anet does good things we will happily say so. 
---
See the last balance changes for wvw and pvp. All previous ones got shit on because they were awful. Cmc proposed simple things that were an improvement and they are generally well received. Praised by various decent players that do know and care for these gamemodes. E.g. see angels' posts.
---
Dont confuse anet being incompetent having consistent fuck ups with hating everything. There just isnt much to be excited about unless you're desperate for fluff and positivity.
---
You talk about "what does it help"... Anet has failed pretty badly for 7 years straight and is effectively driving both the game and their company into the ground. You think they'll magically fix wvw or pvp ever? Anet going bankrupt and the gw2 IP being sold off bas better odds than anet being competent and investing into the future of this game.
---
:)
---
As soon as LFG will let you enter T4s, do it.  
---
T3's diffculty ramp presents a ceiling for many players.   Progressing through T3 was a long hard slog.
---
So playing any female character that isn't an anthropomorphic cat, a gremlin, or a silly plant elf means you're subscribing to "female meta"? Lol.
---
Hammer and rifle are so useless you didn't even think about them.  
---
Pistol is also a weapon that would need a few more classes, so does mace
---
My golden rule is to never join a fractal pug that says "exp" or "fast".  It will be neither.
---
&gt; Due to the general, um, let's say, "ineptitude" of the average joe on the new map, I just keep running into the problem that no matter how much I ask, there will never be enough CC there to continously break the Boneskinners Breakbar
---
I was lucky : my 1st account got achievement before they fixed scaling. My 2nd account *somehow* got the achievement when I first played through the story and did it on the way.
---
After that, I tried very hard to explain cc, seen some breakbars being broken but never enough to save all survivors.
---
Open world breakbars have been an issue and extremely frustrating for competent players for several years now, yet anet keeps doing them and doesn't fix scaling that assumes everyone has a brain. They should either fix scaling, or (stupid idea, I know, just had to spit it) prevent people from playing LS5 before they went through core, ls2, HoT, ls3, PoF and LS4, and passed a breakbar challenge along with an iq test.
---
Unless you're terrible at it like me and you're always hitting the wrong attunement buttons.
---
Which is great because the opposite was true for years. Thats why so many are tired of the pretense that there was "conversation" or "discussion". It was the exact same except only fluff and positivity was permitted.
---
Now that the side with criticism or concerns simply responds the same way, it's an issue. Or perhaps it's because it's not your preferred side that comes out on top. REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Oh great now even more buttons to press while might stacking.
---
I was never going against your ideas so don't take offense :) I feel mace needs more love in game just like hammer
---
But you can keep them in combat.
---
Gw2 source engine? Your hats have hats.
---
Was the music box necessary?
---
Its lovely and stuff that this game is ideal for you. Unfortunately it doesnt appeal to enough people for continued investment compared to other videogames.
---
That is why investment and resources going into gw2 is in a steady decline. You're simply not enough of a target audience to commit to.
---
Obviously they wont shut the game down, or even outright say it. That would heavily decrease their income. Nobody would do that.
---
They'll simply keep on reducing investment with less and less output as a result. This has already been ongoing for a while.
---
Are there more casuals that would likely love gw2? Sure! Too bad they'll never hear about the game.
---
Plenty of small subs have reasonable discussion. Heavy moderation also helps.
---
The more people use a sub like their social media, to either feel good without effort or critical thought or to echo their opinion, the more it goes downhill.
---
And gw2 doesnt is kinda about feelgood fluff more than critical thought nowadays... yet people on this sub act surprised the state of the sub reflects that.
---
Upvoted.
---
Well I highly recommend trying the game out again, it really has changed a lot even with just the first expansion and I didn't even mention things like mastery which includes gliding and mounts. If you need any help feel free to ask and I did [make a guide](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide) with resources that may help you out.
---
I agree any useful wvw and pvp discussion has been happening on discords for years.
---
Mostly because this sub is too full of people that dont play either mode but still have their opinions to validate.
---
Wouldn't say the general opinion of the pvp and wvw discords I'm in is a lot more positive than this subreddit tho :). There are a lot less whiteknight in modes that have been neglected for years.
---
Same for Focus
---
What is this, 2012?
---
I don't think every sub is filled with malcontent. Criticism happens, but not to this level.
---
I think you confuse causes and effects, even when they are always intertwined.
---
It's a legitimate assumption, but whether or not it's "safe to say" that's an entire different debate tbh. We only have one perspective to the whole thing, ours, and there are still 250+ employees at Anet. Who knows what is really going on.
---
Yeah, all this means is that ele's and engis dont have to run around with their inventory window opened and minimized on the side of their screen for those quick swaps. It's a QoL change, but not really *that* exciting.
---
Bdo competition isnt exactly skill based. Same for AA. Same for eve. Same but less bad for wow. Ffxiv neglects its pvp entirely.
---
I did not take any! I just agreed:)))
---
I once held a keep in WvW by jumping on the ram and its would be users with the warrior fall damage trait that would launch them away and then quickly scampering through the gate back in, so some very niche combat uses are possible.
---
&gt;waiting to be turned on
---
Oh my....
---
I dont consider things as BDO where effectiveness is heavily gated through gear / levels / gold, which further than be influenced a LOT by gemstore, exploits or constant grind to be skill based.
---
You dont fight players on an even footing compared to actual competitive games.
---
Same goes for eve, eso, ...
---
There is a reason the top pvpers in these games often spend thousands of dollars or thousands of hours grinding pve over pvp.
---
There's a happy medium in 1440p 144hz.  
---
High refresh rate 4k usage is still a pipe dream at this point, even with an unlimited budget on both developer and consumer end.
---
&gt;"defensive are so low" ... it is clear you have no idea what you're on about.
---
What the fuck are you on about? I never said that.
---
&gt;Almost everything you wrote is a consequence of powercreep, not part of the original game AND screams that you're fairly noob at pvp.
---
A good PvP system ruined by power creep is still a **ruined PvP system**. If the numbers fuck up your game then your game is still fucked up, it’s not “good but the number are bad.” That’s not how games work.
---
&gt;The reason for this level of damage is because of the huge amount of active defenses available that entirely negate most of the outgoing skills done by enemies.
---
This makes for ultra fast paced combat that doesn’t involve almost any strategy whatsoever, which again was my main criticism towards this game mode. It’s kind of mindless and winning is super easy if you know what to do. **It’s not fun.**
---
Congrats on contributing nothing to the conversation.
---
I'll agree theres issues with the gaps in gear in some games that affect how much skill plays a part which sometimes renders skill almost irrelevant.
---
If they feel small when using mounts they weren't developed with mounts in mind.
---
But it does not require certain times to do. You know, repairing SM wall can be done in off hours same as during peak hours.
---
I do agree the complains sound repetitive. What I disagree is that I don't think there's that many people telling others that they are not enjoying the game as you think. By saying that you sound just as hyperbolic as the same players whose hyperbole you're trying to fight.
---
Imo, most of the negativity in this subreddit is directed towards the present and future of the game.
---

🤔just turn off anything not related to the collection you're currently working on then? tekkit's markers are pretty well labeled in the menu.
---
"The bridge is out..."
---
"Fuck..."
---
"... We rebuild?"
---
"Nah, man, let's just heli in from a thousand miles south"
---
Kinda not answered my question :S
---
I’ve been wanting to run a reaper build at some point. I main scourge condi MM and it’s fun. I also don’t have to worry about dying too much.
---
i belive you'll want S4 &gt; Dragonfall &gt; Skyscale Scales/Fever/Eggs/Flight Lost, and probably also Skyscale Roosts below those under exploration.
---
Read your last paragraph. I agree that is sad.
---
But you ask me to empathise with the group that tells me its fine if a game isnt around anymore. Just leave and play something else. It's just a game lol.
---
The very group that didnt only not support us when this happened to wvw, and pvp, and raids, and guilds and guild missions and... but they cheered and supported it. Asked for it. Repeatedly told us we weren't welcome and our playstyle was awful.
---
So tell me again why I would empathise? Because I get it but surely they can go play a mobile game :) 
---
Would I like gw2 to be fun and playable? To have a considerate friendly community? Of course.
---
But that isnt reality and it isnt going to happen. Gw2 imo is all about selfish playstyles being asocial towards others while being friendly and polite on a superficial level at best. So hypocrite its comedic.
---
So I enjoy the soap opera that is this community. It undermines itself 24/7. Let it!
---
There used to be a viable condi scepter mirage for a while. (Replaced by gimmicky condi Chrono we have now).
---
Europe is the same. I don't see the point defending a content which was managed poorly and which was never meant to last. 5 wings and it was already been abandoned.....pretty bad.
---
Defenses are so low. Second line in your wall of text.
---
Well I like to explain it in a nicer way of saying that they probably overestimated how much people actually pick up on the whole mastery mechanic or breakbars in general, but essentially, yes.
---
The very basics of the game are more or less here but since you stopped quite a long time ago you can probably assume that it's a brand new game because most of the bigger part of it have evolved a lot.
---
they are just as old. I know because fractals were sold in the past way before raids existed. Remember the time when you had to complete 3 instances before getting the "good reward"? I remember myself sometimes purchasing the last big reward for, how much it was it?, 40 ectos maybe? It was a good deal for both parts. I saved myself the time of running 3 instances (there were a few that took very long time) while i was doing whatever other content while certain sellers spent their time speed runing the entire thing to charge some people those ectos.
---
If you're willing to spam F on sm walls for 15 hours a week, every week for over half a year...
---
You're really hardcore and committed mindlessly grinding just to avoid a possibly challenging hurdle.
---
I thought casual players had too many commitments to be able to find any raid groups. Interesting how they can literally spam F in wvw as a part time job :)
---
So the part of you shit talking the game well ok i still don't agree on it, it is not healthy for the game and will likely make the game die faster. And why people who love the game want it to die faster is kind of a weird way of thinking. But tbh i think you missed the point. I am not even placing you in to the group because you still have a passion for the game. The people i talk about are the people who join the pitch fork horde for fun on something they don't have a clue about. Many of them have not even played the game. It is the Internet and you probably seen this ugliness in other situations were hordes join because they heard about it. Those i talk about.
---
How ever the rest of your post and i know this will come as a shock to you but yeah i agree. There is a shift in the MMO today. In the past when MMO was born you could release a game that was not done yet and build on it when moving forward. There was nothing else to compare with and we were playing what there was. 
---
Some where on this road other game catched up. Moba games was born, which was 100% focused on PvP. All ballance stuff, maps, gear, anything had only one purpose, PvP. People playing it realised how much better and more fun it is to play PvP in moba game because it felt ballanced towards the game mode.
---
MMO started to fall behind, and not only GW2 but all MMO because they have at least two game modes to ballance around and then usually ballance inside of a game mode. Like in GW2 we have S-PvP and WvW. And in PvE there are raids and fractals and open world and so on. All this need to synergy and obviously it is a task that is impossible in the long run and why there is tension between the game modes and ballance pretty much in any MMO. 
---
In future i don't really think there will be that many MMO games. There are a few new on the horizon that looks solid. AoC, Cyberpunk 2077, Pantheon all appealing to to different people. 
---
AoC i belive will stick around the other two i hope will have something to offer but we see. 
---
So yeah looking at those MMO and some others too it is obvious that the old MMO genre is falling behind. They still have a lot of fans who will keep on playing but in the end the step has to be done, the old will be replaced with the new. Combat is so much more today then it was in the past and the reason GW2 still is good is probably the combat more then anything. 
---
Anyway i am floating out again. But yes on your second point about MMO i am totally with you on that. The first one not so much, or rather i still belive jumping in the pitchfork train will rather short the life of the MMO. Not only GW2 but if one of the giants falls it will be a lot of worry going on in the game industry over all.
---
Well good for you then. :)
---
I remember getting a raven guild decoration as part of an achievement. Is it that one or is it just an smaller one that can be upgraded to that shiny one?
---
This is were i am a bit baffled. You love the game and enjoy playing it and yet you want it to die faster and there for you are on the pitch fork train... ok.
---
Baby padding added to all sharp corners in the game
---
I really like those ideas, I don’t really get why they went with instanced missions in the first place. You can share guild race credit with other guilds, why not others? With the state of missions / guild content in general at the moment, it just makes them feel even more isolated than they already are.
---
We at least got our cheese triangle 🧀
---
Hope this wakes up people so they can see how bad this game is going.
---
Can't believe people still defend ANet and everything they do, we have such a hollow game, updates are pretty meh,  
---
but apperantly people still are happy. On top we have key Devs keep leaving the company and important projects and everyone is still hyped about " OMG they added a new cat you can interact with" . Come on guys... this game is ruined and its only going to get worse..  
---
Good luck Jason and hope he finds better projects he can work on and improve himself!
---
disagree, poe has one of the worst communities ive come across. full of delusional and mentally ill people, nevermind the amount of scammers youll be metting in game or the global chat.
---
Ah I see, you misinterpreted that as meaning that I was talking about defensive skills, which is why you said “defensives” in your comment and went on to talk about that. No, I’m again talking about numbers.
---
Competition where skill is irrelevant isnt really competition imo. Similar for having skill gaps so big one side can't compete.
---
Farming players can be enjoyable and rewarding and trick players into believing they're good at a game...
---
But it's not genuine skill based competition. And this is very typical for mmorpgs (gw2 is actually great and tried to fix this), and would NOT be tolerated in any modern competitive game.
---
If league scaled your stats with the rarity of your skin or the level or age of your account people would be outraged... and for good reason.
---
Go ahead
---
FACE THE LEAD!
---
... w t f
---
Outsiders could troll the events.
---
For those that are trollable, they would still need to keep them instanced or have some sort of control to prevent trolling.
---
I remember the old fractal system but I can't relate to pay someone to play the game for me.
---
Pretty sure that's what he asked. I think you need to go read again.
---
Ahem, the 980 is slightly dated. 1060 4GB and up will carry GW2 in 4k without being the bottleneck.
---
xD
---
I kind of see were you comming from because we share the passion about WvW and there are a few of us that been vocal about WvW on reddit for years but got the cold hand from the other players. 
---
I get that you feel why should you care about PvE people who only now realise that it is not fun to be the black sheep game mode. 
---
 
---
I agree with the people who is voicing the issues and then move on until there is something new about it and then accept the change or don't but they do not overflow the sub for months and months being a parrot.
---
I don't agree with the pitchfork train who have a group of people who don't care at all about the game they just want to sink it because it is fun and they can and then move on to next target when they feel they succeeded which can be another game, a streamer, a company well anything really because this is what they do, they have no connection with it they just do it for what ever reason.
---
Just revert PVE scourge own shadow mechanic as it was before the dumb WvW nerf.
---
As far as MMoRPGs goes, the sad answer is no.
---
Your you jump to MOBAs or you play gear PVP.
---
Good question.
---
Thought it was implied, my bad. Yes I did, owned a 4k monitor for a few days and going back to 60hz felt terrible after years on higher refresh rates.
---
Yeah and all necro builds are very simple, let us trasform into our pets and give us abilities tied to those
---
Oh thank the 6 gods it's not just me! I saw one in core Tyria, mined it and for a moment wondered if it was time to change my meds...
---
I generally agree with you, yet as a guardian I spend most of the game in downstate anyways. Might as well add more utilities to the down state while I'm down there.
---
I don't know, every time I get letter sometimes it's my main, sometimes other chars I played lately.
---
Well reaper use a scythe actually as it's core weapon
---
They let you try out the boosted character in a trial that you can reverse before committing.
---
You can still find few groups in EU server lfging it is just non-existent in NA.
---
[removed]
---
Thank you very much for your thoughts. Much appreciated.
---
IMO the cast time reduction was what make it actualy really strong now. 3sec was way too long and you are just better to go get them up. With 1.5 sec cast time you can now save someone from death. In PvE, you could save someone crucial to the group that would have die without it.
---
Sure you lose 2 potential rez but I prefer being able to save 1 person than maybe save 3 if I didnt get interrupt or they die before the 3 secs...
---
With those change, It bring back Scourge Dps a good class that bring nice support has a Dps class.
---
I've been gathering the corrupted weapons for my Norn guardian, she's finally move on from the plant theme she's been rocking since HoT came out.
---
Though for which class to pick I can vouch for Mesmer. I haven't tried any other class really but I love it a lot.
---
i'm always of the opinion that if you have to boost something, boost a necro, because they're the most boring to level and require the least learning of the base class. all the good stuff is in the elites
---
You know what, I have a perfect icy character Norn condi zerker with snow diamond and ghostly infusions, pharus lege longbow, glacial gauntlets, Jormag's breath sword... in short, I've invested in fashion wars to make him look like a svanir renegade boss. And with this icebrood saga this character's time has finally come. AND I STILL DON'T HAVE AN ICY BACKPIECE SKIN. Wtf anet?!! And don't even suggest that ugly looking icehorns from Bitterfrost Frontier map. 
---
Even if it's gemstore only, I'll buy it at this point. Fimme Anet pls.
---
Same rig = same thing, now that's a new one
---
GW2 isn't the same type of treadmill as other MMOs. You can't really do it wrong. Personally, I would just follow along with the story, but any order that suits you is just as good.
---
You've played for 7 years and don't have a Norn char on your account? You racist, very very bad man :D 
---
I bet all of your chars are those tiny Asuras :P
---
&gt;Is there anything I should absolutely do right now?
---
Honestly I think you should go back, finish HoT, and continue as it came out from there.
---
You can hop around the stories if you want and get caught up quickly since it's not exactly Dostoevsky, but one story does lead into the next one so your experience might be as disjointed as going from Zhaitan to assaulting Verdant Brink with a crew of *Who Dis?* because they didn't think to future-proof S1. 
---
*Whispers in The Dark* will still be there waiting for you when you arrive.
---
I loved the GW1 format. I mean, i loved being able to do every content by myself knowing that if a team had 8 spots i could fill them with computer controlled NPCs that i could micromanage to a certain degree (i was personally able to complete every hard mode PVE content just by myself with NPCs). Of course i could always play with other people if i wanted.
---
So if GW3 was ever a thing i would like it to have a format more similar to GW1 while retaining many of the GW2 additions.
---
&gt; In what order should I do them? Does it matter?
---
GW2 has a continuing story so playing them in order would make sense...
---
Personal Story -&gt; Season 1 -&gt; Season 2 -&gt; HoT -&gt; Season 3 -&gt; PoF -&gt; Season 4 -&gt; Icebrood Saga
---
Well, no one will really answer that for you. Some can play it out of order and still be able to know what happens in the order it was released, others, like me, can't.
---
&gt; I'm doing Path of Fire storyline right now, should I drop it and go do Icrebood Saga so I don't get 'behind'?
---
You can catch up to the story fairly quickly in comparison to the next release. If you only play the story without getting sidetracked then you can complete them each in 1-2 hours. which is about 6-12 hours for each season. PoF might be a bit longer but also won't take you a few weeks if you only focus on the story.
---
The releases won't run away and there is absolutely no reason to feel "left behind", if you have them unlocked then play them as you see fit.
---
So in short, **I** would play it in order, play the story until you have caught up and then you can concentrate on learning the masteries, gathering mastery points, map completion and maybe even some achievements.
---
Guild wars is fashion wars. If it looks average it won't be used :/ 
---
Fite me :P
---
i’d definitely go revenant. it’s the profession i enjoy the most out of all of those and if you ever get into fractals / raiding is a super fun and competitive pick for those as well
---
chrono sort of fills those roles minus the ‘fun’ and is also less relevant these days (especially fractals)
---
Im sure they must be some players or even just reddit users who are here only for the laughs, but im completely sure they are a minority
---
All the backlash you are seeing here is a consequence of what anet has been doing the last 2 years, maybe more, so stop blaming this community for all the hate anet is getting, because they got it well deserved, people don't waste their time writing huge posts calling them out for nothing after all...
---
Maybe if you stop calling them "parrots" you might see most players that repeat what other post they do because they are too angry customers who agree with what most of us are saying and they downvote because they can't belive how stupid some people can be defending anet after all of what they done to their most faithful customers
---
And if the bigger part of players doesn't mind that anet:
---
. Neglects the whole community, and even entire game modes
---
. Lies constantly asking for feedback to then ignore it making wild changes that usually bring more trouble than solutions
---
. Tries to monetize everything even if what they release is pure shit or breaks the game completely (cough.. templates... cough...)
---
. Lies again promising changes they aren't even working on (cough... alliances... cough... soon TM)
---
. Doesn't know how to balance, manage or change their own game because they lost all of their starter devs and now are running a code new devs don't even understand
---
. Focus completely on a SINGLE PLAYER story mode in an mmorpg, which sucks because it's the same old shit over and over again only they change dialogues, cinematics and place, and even the whole plot of the story gets weaker year after year
---
. Put more effort into selling cosmetic crap in the cash shop than fixing all the shit we see day after day, or even releasing new quality content and not the piece of shit little map we got last ls episode you could finish in half an hour, or that stupid strike mission were the boss dies in less than 5 minutes
---
. Starts side projects with our money, taking resources out of gw2 to make whatever the hell they were trying to do, in complete silence to later don't release a thing and lose half of their staff.. you know the one "in charge of making gw2 better"
---
. Dumbs down combat to catter to new players meanwhile ruining the whole combat experience vets got in love with 
---
Thats their own problem, and let's see how many of those players are still here after they realize the game has no endgame content except farming constantly the same shitty maps for currency to later buy cosmetics, or do a stupid single story mode, as another redditer said before me "if i want a single player story mode i'd be playing the withcher 3 anet"
---
meanwhile supporting them and buying gems showed us how shady they are and how incompetent too, so thats not a solution, at least warning players who like quality in their games about all of this shit is doing them a favor
---
Holy shit the core ele build was already annoying chaining blocks and invuln and mobility skills to get away in wvw now it will be even more cancer.
---
&gt;The game gave me a 80 a boost
---
As others have said, you can test out your boosted toon on the RIBA without needing to commit to eating the boost so you can give all of the professions a try. The gear they give you isn't optimal for most builds but it gets the job done.
---
&gt;I’m looking for something easy to pick up
---
**Guardian**. Both the elites are pretty good as well if you decide to commit. 
---
&gt;Revenant, Engineer &amp; Mesmer all look cool but will I be way out of depth?
---
Personal opinions but;
---
* Rev has fun combat with the swords but I was never able to stay on top of the energy mechanic so I never got into the groove of it. 
---
* Engi is a slow and steady type of class that is good to solo with. You can build it to play brain-dead or you can come up with something that needs an Elementalist level rotation for it. 
---
* Mesmer never clicked for me. It can be ridiculously expensive to gear up optimally unless you got gold to burn.
---
I loove my scourge. It's fun solo, it's fun in condi dependant end game content, it's fun in open world, it's fun in metas... but it requires viper gear which might be a bit more expensive to craft.
---
Whatever you decide you're gonna have all classes soon so don't worry :P
---
Hey y’all so I’ve been tinkering around my PVE Scrapper Open World build and wanted to have a balance of damage and sustain. 
---
I tested [this build](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PeQAIlRwsYQsGWKOsKvteA-zRJYiRBfZEYBURCo2A-e) on the raid golem and got an average of 7k DPS. 
---
Any suggestions to improve damage?
---
As someone who sold raids since early 2016... I can just encourage everyone to try them themselves ... 
---
Raids are extremely fun and not as hard as you might think.
---
If you can dedicate maybe 1 hour a day for it or let’s say 3-4 hours a week in total you will get into it and have a way better experience when you actually get your desired item, than if you bought.
---
The feeling that you get when you finally kill the boss on which you were trying for quite a time cannot be bought with gold or Mc
---
There isnt even an official CEO as far as we know. They said they put Mike Z in charge but that's just words. I dont think there's any true leadership at all atm, just chaos.
---
Seconded. I got into raids after starting Strikes and working with the other newbies to kill Soulless Horror was so much fun. We managed to get the kill in two hours and I got a unique ascended drop. Best experience I have had in game in a long time. So much fun.
---
That's okay. Once it's falling, ANet will mount their griffon
---
I do wonder why they don't add several little instanced nooks throughout the edges of the known map, occasionally adding new ones with releases of LS episodes. Just, small(er) instanced areas that are mostly open other than possibly a gut or cabin depending on locale. But they'd let you decorate with items generally reserved for Guild Halls and double as a personalized home instance so you can also place/use any nodes you own (but then can't go to a racial city home instance and double-farm, they're shared nodes) in any pattern or position you want within the area.
---
They have these tools within the game (to freely place and adapt parts within a set space) and yet the content is locked to most people unless they get their own Guild Hall, or if they are granted creative freedoms/rights to decorate by their respective Guild higher-ups.
---
I love the look of many of these Guild Hall decorations, but honestly hate that until I get a group together to get my boyfriend and I our own personal Guild Hall, collecting them is effectively useless to both of us, and so we just...don't. Same with Scribe as a crafting class, why would I level it if I am not permitted by my guild to decorate with the things I make?
---
It's such a missed opportunity and would make many players happy to utilize, more than Guild Halls truly allow for. I'd imagine these would be restricted to 5 people parties at most, and would be maybe half the size of Rata Sum racial home instance (but larger than The Grove). They could even add new structures that replicate houses and buildings throughout the world. I'd love to see the types of jumping puzzles some people would develop in these instances
---
Worst trait? Current iteration of Lost Time v3 is awful and a grandmaster.
---
I hope many many players follow your example and actually go that road... everyone could benefit ... since more ppl in raids equals higher chance for new raid content.
---
Glad you liked it
---
Can we get another section for raid sellers? It's obnoxious seeing 10 sellers clog up the lfg
---
well.. i love the parts, that anet seems to abandon. and have you ever tried to replace gw? i tried it with ffxiv for raiding buuut.. the Story is shit, the fighting system feels like its from 2003 and i didnt even reach the max level for free trial cause it bored me to death.
---
if anet didnt sacrifice the old raidteams for LS (during w1-3 times) i could have tons of fun instead playing 5 hours per week because i raid a little bit with friends. ir just sucks to see how everything gets so easy that you can autoattack it down like strike missions
---
No
---
The shiny one is the default and can also be purchased pretty cheaply from a merchant. The shine can be toggled on and off.
---
I could do that in Pokémon 25 years ago.are you telling me it is too hard? Then content is not that easy as this subs claims
---
Eh, I would say its good on its own but its competitors are OP. You get some interactions with other traits which allows it to give you Alacrity on interrupts, f3, Time Warp and Arcane Thievery.
---
There's no specific tank class in gw2. Though with my characters my guardian would be the most tanky.
---
He's not wrong, the more consistently you play the game the more you drive yourself in a corner. No1 cares if you had other responsibilities in life that kept you away from the game but by your own words you barely played the game on a standard basis which kept things kinda fresh. This is becoming a pattern atm, most people who are pleased with the game are those who play 1-2h per week or quit and come back every few months/years.
---
If everyone played at this pace there wouldnt be a game as servers would have shut down due to little revenue.
---
I like that you chose the flying mount with less vertical ability
---
One more fuckup before christmas from ANet, and I'll be dedicating the time I'd play the game daily to shitpost about it.
---
So, 30 seconds to grab a daily reward and that's it.
---
Not a cliff, but off the edge of a table.
---
No, you could tank on any character. Just some characters are better at tanking than others due to the skillset and toolkit they possess but also depending on mechanics and moves of the bosses. That being said, a lot of bosses do not require a tank.
---
Chrono usually is the tank because it has access to lots of personal blocks with a long duration and a distort on a short cooldown while pumping out boons for your squad.
---
Firebrand is also a viable tank on bosses such as VG, gorse, KC,Deimos since it brings: Sustain from boons/heals and blocks on a fairly low cooldown meaning that you can double as a healer while being a tank leaving basicly 1 slot open for a dps (in theory)
---
You can do the same thing on revenant (renegade) but it is a bit more trickier and is not as viable on every boss. You still have lots of sustain and you bring alacrity for the entire party.
---
Healscourge can also tank on some bosses, while I would not recommend it, if you really lack another tank and the party is some rag-tag group scourge can be a tank/healer on some bosses (mostly wing 1)
---
Then there are som niche picks I've seen with varying success such as scrapper and healboonthief  which can work out depending on boss.
---
The thing you need to keep in mind when looking for a tank is: What does the boss do that tank X can mitigate? What else does tank X bring to the party? How does bringing this tank affect our squad comp? is this really the best tank?
---
Often the answer to these questions result in having a chrono or FB as a tank.
---
Then they will switch to complaining that it's the fault of all the toxic people on reddit.
---
very nice idea. I also made my own guild hall just to be able to decorate it my way so no one can ruin my effort making it. I spent a lot of gold for just buying those decorations but I love the outcome and it is mine :D
---
It's the Master of the Forge (or something like this). You have to complete the Restored Boreal weapon collections and bags (along their recipe) are awarded at certain tiers.
---
Edit: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Master_of_the_Ancestral_Forge
---
Master of the Ancestral Forge.
---
[deleted]
---
&gt;  Why do you guys think none of the builds, at least on MetaBattle or Snowcrows, use the Water vs. Fire traitline 
---
Because all your dps skills are fire or air and forgoing either traitline loses 20% cooldown reduction. The gain from the flat modifiers is simply too small to offset that.
---
The NA raiding community did exsist, but it's dwindled significantly from what it once was.
---
I lead a raiding guild and at the height of raids (for us between w5 + 6) we had 3 full statics. 
---
Sadly nowadays we only have 1 and that's even a stretch as they have like 4 slots open and I don't lead anymore so I can't say how successful they've been in recruiting new raiders.
---
thanks mate, i haven't started that one but sounds worthwhile!
---
yep, gw2 at it's core... great systems, terrible management and decision making.
---
Yes I know I often outdo the DPS people while on my banner war
---
That's a fair point.  I suppose if they started doing minion skins, then four or five years down the road your elementalist has 15 different skins for his fire elemental, a pvp opponent might not necessarily be able to recognize what creature it is quite as readily, especially if that player is new and doesn't know what the skins are.
---
Conversely, I think they could probably just disable the feature in competitive modes, forcing minions and summons to default appearance.
---
I wouldn't mind having numerous different skins for undead summons, and the option to choose which skins my minions would use, or to shuffle multiple skins.  Again, it'd be worth ANet's time to figure out how to do it, since it'd be a monetized system.
---
There is also the fact that the pack just used tech to instsntly add holo bridges to the middle of a war zone two patches ago in drsgonstand.
---
Except for all of the episodes that do come out every few months?
---
Ohh, I definitely think I've seen ranger and warrior do this before. I feel like I also say guardian have this ability as well but this gives me somewhere to start looking. thank you!
---
with them still being susceptible to CC, does that interrupt the effect altogether or does it just fear/stun/etc them but you still can't do damage?
---
It's too...perfect? Like every creature, every character, every building looks too perfect. Ruins look as if they were "built" that way in the world and intended to be ruins, not that they collapsed over time. Character faces are too smooth, monsters are too uniformly perfect. The textures make everything feel a bit porcelain to me
---
I like a lot of the designs, I just wish they'd let imperfections into the design. Not everything has to look so expertly put together and intentional.
---
You do know that living story and festivals are not the only content that exists in the game, right?
---
Bitterfrost fronteer and lake dorek connect to core Tyria but yes it was nice to have living story maps connect Maps connect as well.
---
I would love it so much if they went back to old maps and added ways to walk into bloodstone fen and other zones.
---
Doesn't the dog change from time to time as well?
---
The closest I've managed to recreate the feeling is a berserker's staff herald. It's not quite the same, but it's managed to fill the void a bit for me.
---
&gt; The only MMORPG which let you to play PvP similar to MOBA games.
---
actually FF14 literally has a moba pvp mode with towers and minions. It's not very popular, but hey neither is stronghold.
---
The passive is 4-6% life force per tick. That us less than one auto round for dagger. The only spec that needs a lot of LF is heal scourge, but even there, dagger auto is more than enough to be maxed constantly.
---
I mean, the whole point of the no-weapon-swap for those two professions was because they already have access to so many skills as it is.
---
This change just makes it that you don't need to mess with your inventory anymore to swap weapons between encounters.
---
Some people just don't understand wanting to do X in Y game and just say nonsense like "If you like X, go back to X game."
---
Seems like a bunch of barren owls..
---
Well... it looks like a picture taken with a spinning cellphone... what do you want us to notice?...
---
The actual glitch in the matrix here is your horizontally recorded vertical video
---
Pretty sure there are no tracks.
---
Why do you post this here and not official forum?
---
Imagine comming to gw2 for a single player rpg story and get this trainwreck.
---
* Big Boomer is better because more health and more damage which applies to every hit
---
* Glass cannon is flat 7% buff and youll always have barrier to keep your health high; 120 power is way less than 7% of your power and might is fine anyway
---
* Battering Ram, grenade kit, throw mine, or elixir gun are better than blast gyro: grenade kit has ranged pressure and utility through chill and blind application, and allows permanent fury if you run short fuse instead of big boomer. Battering ram is easy to use and satisfying. Throw mine is huge damage and a blast finisher. Elixir gun is mobility, cleanse, a blast finisher that also does ridiculous damage, a little range pressure, a stun break, and some healing
---
* consider firework runes: 6 sec of fury per 20 sec rather than 8 sec per 30 sec, so higher uptime, and you can run around more with the movement speed increase
---
* with the firearms traitline + fury you gain 45% crit chance, so swap marauder pieces back to berserker until you hit 55% and that's crit capped. Pay attention if you opt to run firework runes, as they dont offer precision like pack runes
---
An owl migration.  
---
Until you killed them all.  
---
Shame on you.
---
&gt; schienenersatzverkehr
---
"rail replacement bus" :-)
---
&gt; I'm tired of skills that cause self damage.
---
Then why are you playing a Necromancer? That's kind of their thing, especially when it comes to conditions. That part of the reason why they have by far the most condi transfer in the game.
---
The revenant was a mistake, imo. They pushed too hard with the nostalgia bullshit, and they didn't even capitalize it well. I mean, imagine this alternate scenario:
---
* Revenant has no legend mechanic. Instead, it's a mix between GW1's dervishes, ritualists, and monks. The core profession would use spirits as the core mechanic, and include a dedicated healer option.
---
* Legends could still be a nice theme if done right, so what if we made them integral parts of elite specializations instead? So instead of each elite spec coming out of nowhere, each could be inspired by some legendary character instead.
---
Just my two cents. It's just sad revenant got wasted like that :(.
---
Thank you :)  you were very helpful. I was sincerely trying to ask for an answer but was downvoted... :( anyway, i hope this game gets better for everyone!
---
This is new. Welcome German language!
---
Since shadowkeep FFXIV has added a 8 man raid wing with 4 bosses that have a normal and savage mode, a 24 man alliance raid based on Neir Automata, NINE NEW dungeons,  an ultimate raid, 3 trials (basically what strikes are trying to emulate) that each have an extreme mode, This is on top of some of the best story  content in the genre and there is more of all of this still coming.
---
Its almost night and day compared to gw2. Look I love gw2, I have thousands of hours into the game and it has some of the best combat I have played in any mmo but its CLEAR that anet has mismanaged this game. The content anet is putting out is not sustainable.
---
They should have made minions the necromancer core mechanic, instead of the Death Shroud. Big mistake there, imo.
---
Empty Guild Hall with Double/Triple decoration limit... man can dream.
---
So basically "we were so bad at it that we're just not going to bother at all". And some people are somehow framing this as a good thing? How is it anything but an abject failure?
---
I remember monthy salvager
---
I think that "at a glance" goes out the window when all the gem store outfits look the same.
---
It's still a bad change. 75s and 50% base HP cost for one rez is utter shit and you can't justify that as a good change. Even with the now doubled life force passive gain. 
---
This signet is now like every other signet. A stat stick, though in this case it's not a stat but a regen.
---
I did. I used it a few times to actually save people. And yes, I am a heal Scourge.
---
&gt; Except that gameplay impacts the lore.
---
Only for people who keep forgetting that mechanics aren't tied to lore. That's like saying people in the lore can never cast spells unless they equip a weapon just because we can't.
---
Or how anyone can just teleport at any given time freely because we can.
---
Is there any way to get Selfless Potion/Thoughtless Potion novelties?
---
i can remember the pairs, it's badly designed because you have to make detour to get strength against enemy type you want to fight.
---
refrain from putting words in my mouth and assuming things, it makes you look like a moron
---
It's not just the skyscale. Non animated skins are better than animated ones, if your pc has problems with fps/lags. Animated skins will most likely cause lag/lower fps.
---
Uuu a detour but hey map is small isn't it ?
---
I assumed nothing you were extremely clear
---
It would be bad design if a mob would drop power up against itself.
---
Jesus you complain for everything
---
I think most game developers would admit that most game dev is like this.
---
oh yeah and make 25might base too ? No need of support in any gamemode would be so better /s  
---
At this point just go play a solo game.
---
Um, I play everything but I stay for the story.
---
The main reason T3 are difficult isn't because the fractals themselves are that much harder.  It's because 90% of the players are sub-par.
---
Now I want this as a beetle skin.
---
Dervish is 10th class in the next expansion. And its elite will make it a Paragon.
---
You want that?
---
it will just be a permanent up and down until we see the light again:D:D (enough optimism for today)
---
Ha. You can't seduce me with your LIES.
---
Too bad it runs like shit (talking about performance)
---
Once in a while the season 1 memory box comes up for sale in the gemstore. There's a decent chance of getting sprockets from the chests there. Anywhere from 1 - 31 can drop. It's 10 sprockets for each potion. They usually return to the gemstore like once or twice a year.
---
Downwards.
---
 or even Focus mastery if you happen to be using a focus then you could use 5 for the blast finisher more often for an AoE cleanse :p
---
(Talking in relation to FractalCMs/Raid perspective mostly, since I never put much thought into PvP/WvW, and Open World PvE is very different than the rest)
---
I think GW2's boon/condi system is strangling itself, as well as what professions can do when it comes to 'metas'. The 'meta comp' is always the one that can keep the most important boons/condis up 100% of the time the easiest, while providing the most damage, and it's because boons/condis in GW2 are extremely powerful.
---
Currently, you get 25 might, which gives you 750 power/condi, which corresponds to about 35% extra power if you look at the value you have with a full zerk + scholar rune set.    
---
Then you add in a 20% critical chance from Fury.    
---
Then you add in 25% extra damage received on the target because they have 25 stacks of vulnerability.    
---
Then you add in the fact that your actions are now 50% faster due to quickness, and that your cooldown is now 25% faster due to alacrity.    
---
Also 33% extra health due to Protection.
---
If you add all of this up, you get a laughable increase in power by upkeeping just these things, which is not hard at all since historically, 2 or 3 professions can upkeep these boons 100% of the time, and it's extremely easy to do so.
---
I do believe that quickness/alacrity boons are a big part of the problem in forming a 'meta' comp, but I also think that having these other orange boons/vulnerability be *so* powerful makes it impossible to give power to unique boons. 
---
Professions like Warriors and Druids were and are still to a certain extent sought after because they can add a thing *on top* of the 'expected', and there are very few professions that actually have anything like that. If anet were to reduce how much these boons/condis give and the rate in which they are given, they could share more power into other unique modifiers to give relevancy to different comps.
---
***TL;DR:*** I really think boons and condis should be made weaker, and different unique modifiers should be given the power that's being removed and spread across different skills of different professions/specs.
---
As it stands, the meta will always be whoever can output quickness, alacrity and 25 might and fury the easiest.
---
It’s worked on all the Adamant Guards, Iron never breaks, only bends aye?
---
Ya'll doing it wrong. Just get a job that lets you do that and watch a movie on another screen. Best of all worlds.
---
Thats because it is my friend.
---
Cheers, happy to help! Over time, you might consider swapping to more and more pieces of berserker, to promote a prevailing approach to this game of "if you kill it before it can hit you, that's the best defense."
---
Scrapper in particular gets rewarded from this approach because the more damage you do (from changing marauder to zerk), the more barrier you have. It's a pretty unique aspect of the class. Feel free to discuss further, I enjoy engi stuff :)
---
Yep. If you open the wiki pages for Alacrity and Quickness to try and theory craft a new group, you'll see that only 2 things can output Alacrity 100% of the time, and only 2 others can upkeed Quickness 100% of the time (outside of the Boon Thief Boi, who is mostly an OP gimmick to cheese some bosses, tho it's always fun), so you are already locked into using 2 of these by default.
---
And since there are no other unique modifiers on other classes, the rest is just fluff that doesn't make that much of a difference other than it being a condi or a power class.
---
Sad that you have no reason to go there.
---
Sadly yes. I just can’t make medium armor work on charr.
---
Why are you blaming community for developer's faults?  
---
Their mistakes led to this reddit going complete 180 turn in community's opinion. If you check the posts 4-5 years ago they are like "one of the best MMO" "I like this game" and so on.
---
Dropping support for a failed system is often the best choice. Letting the sunk-cost fallacy set the agenda will often end in disaster.
---
Is it a failure? Yes. Is stopping a good thing? also yes.
---
That's not what OP is advocating for. If there are pitfalls of the system OP is suggesting, why not discuss those instead of jumping to the logical extreme of maximum stacks of a different boon becoming baseline?
---
&gt;Again, living story and festivals are not the only content that exists in the game.
---
No but it's the only content that matters.
---
Living world/general large scale open world PvE is what separates GW2 from other MMOs. It's the *only* thing separating GW2 from other MMOs. If that goes away, the game is *sure* to die, because people will just go play literally any other MMO that does everything else better.
---
Shjjjjt, made bank running Gate of Madness!
---
No, but I want to.
---
No.
---
I realize I may be in the minority on this, especially given the downvotes you're getting, but I genuinely think the game feels more fluid and fun to play with quickness specifically. Long cast times are an outdated method of balance from the old days of MMOs, probably implemented initially to make up for server lag in early 'massively-multiplayer' games.
---
Alacrity feels less noticeable, but quickness just makes the game more fun to play IMO - I'm not spending so much time waiting for my abilities to do something, and autoattacks feel much more responsive.
---
As much as I would like for quickness to be baseline, people tend to assume that would come with making their support builds less necessary, which they don't like. The actual reason for that necessity in a game that, at its core, was meant to eschew the traditional MMO trinity at launch, is rarely discussed or questioned.
---
In short, I think the game would just all around be more enjoyable to play for the vast majority of players if we didn't have to spend so much time waiting for abilities to finish casting - even if such a change might upend the current and seemingly inescapable support build meta in high level content that only a fraction of the playerbase actually sees. Apart from those players, the most negatively impacted would likely be those with high ping in PvP and WvW - something that is already a death sentence most of the time in those modes anyway.
---
Post deleted what's goin on
---
I see the post and the user (who had an extensive history mind you) are deleted.
---
Because I have not seen any actual mistakes. I see only a community of unpleasable people that demand more than than is feasible from a game that charges them nothing... and isn't even charging them for their next round of expansion content. You get everything you want and then bitch and whine when it's not what you built yourselves up expecting. You expect to be able to play an MMORPG for free but bitch about the whales, the only things that can keep modern games running. Raider locusts that came to another game and drug it down into the pit of unsustainability.
---
The GW2 playerbase is just a bunch of spoiled brats that don't know how good they goddamn have it.
---
That's basically what I first said :/
---
&gt; But, I disagree that creating these especs would be simple and easy. 
---
Anet had since PoF to do it. Like what were they doing this entire time?
---
&gt;  They also need to be connected to their expansion lore-wise. 
---
The vast majority of HoT specs didn't so this is by no means a requirement.
---
Banner warr still has some quite respectable dps, although a proper dps player obviously shouldn't be beaten by the BS. But as I said, some people managed to get below the heal druid, which does ... dunno, at most 2k while doing the usual healing stuff. The skill bottom of the GW2 community is quite astonishing at times.
---
Nope. That would not do. Because "these people" are not really an uniform group, but a bunch of people who want a lot very different specific things, and no one thing will make all of them happy.
---
It'll be like trying to use one of those tiny cloth squares to clean glasses as a blanket, there's just no way it'll cover the whole thing.
---
I would guess graphics: models and textures?   Maybe they would even add content that would link to where GW2 is heading (though hopefully nothing about midichlorians)?  /shrug
---
GW2 is like those unfinished Mcmansions from pre-2008.
---
Everything looks great, there's some quality structure, but shit just stopped.
---
Tagging, short bow is one of the strongest weapons for general PVE, being able to provide a strong damage output while tagging basically every enemy even in large fights. It has always been the number 1 choice for loot whores. 
---
Frequent hits also means you get healed a lot through your signet.
---
I dont feel it a bad change. Before the active was unuseable. It might not be well balance with 75secs cooldown and 50% health cost but it's a start in the right direction. 
---
With the traits Signet of suffering, Undeath became really good on Power Reaper. You keep the passive effect when on Reaper and recharge the signet in ~20 secs by staying in Reaper without Alacrity.
---
But the best is the cast time of 1.5sec that make it strong for a full revive. With quickness, you can litteraly revive someone before someone notice or before someone complete the finisher. If someone is mid cast of finishing someone you still rez him faster than the finisher complet...
---
My upvote for Gromit.
---
At the very least your skills should prioritice your fields first, then from party members, squds, then other players.
---
But a better solution would be something that makes all fields good and welcomed even if stacked.
---
Thank you!
---
I wouldn't mind a Guild Wars remaster. In fact, I would LOVE it! BRING IT ON!!!
---
I think GW1 is actually due for a remake for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the moment system is often cited a reason for the game feeling sluggish. They could not fix it in a simple update, but could fix it in a new game. Not only can they fix the sluggish movement and rubbery feeling, but they could add jumping too.
---
Secondly, and possibly most important: Population. As great as GW1 is, we can't revive the game unless there's a new product to bring the population. Releasing a new expansion for the original game 
---
Third, and this is the technical side: The current GW1 client itself has size limitations. This means that ArenaNet cannot fully give GW1 the graphical polish it deserves. While Nightfall and Eye of the North still look beautiful to this day, Prophecies has aged very badly, and is time for a graphical revise.
---
I'm a bit disappointed because I know this post is fake. But I do want a fresh coat of paint for GW1.
---
But I can be disappointed with GW2 while playing it, something I can't do with Half-Life 3
---
If only it played as nice as it looks.
---
But you have seen it.
---
You can buy a lot of them on the TP for gold, if you have 400g burning a hole in your pocket.
---
Regarding the conjures, I'd rather have them gradually remove them to incorporate them into new elite specs.  They can reuse the same skills as the conjures for that element, and we get new weapons!  Doing this with GS first would be nice, but weaver got sword, so bow would make more sense in terms of weapon variety.
---
That would be rather crazy. It's better to go in the opposite direction, making alacrity and quickness impossible to upkeep 100% of the time by making them stack in intensity rather than duration.   
---
If people can't upkeep a boon, they won't feel like they have to do it, and that'll free them to do other varied things.
---
* Alacrity reduces recharges by 25%, it could be changed to 2% per stack, and replace the current durations with shorter durations of about 5-10 stacks across the board. It would be possible to reach 50% with 25 stacks, but it would not last long and it would not be doable often, so it would be used more to get your ally skills back and ready for a burst. 
---
* Quickness speeds up attacks and action by 50%, it could be changed to 2% per stack too, and the current durations similarly reduced and the skills would add stacks. It would be a boon your party pops up when their skills are ready and you are going for a burst all at once.  
---
 * In addition, some skills that give attack speed like Dual Wielding would be changed to give quickness instead. Letting a warrior with the trait build up attack speed that they can keep at 50% while they keep attacking, and go down over time when they stop. Kind of like "Frenzy" in diablo games. 
---
 * Another example of a trait like that could get a similar 'build up speed' trait would be Air  Magic. Imagine if "Ferocious Winds" make you get stacks of quickness as you hit with autoattacks (double with air attunement autoattacks), and then imagine a Dagger elementalist with a lightning whip and that effect whipping around like a madman.  
---
But it'll hit hard people accustomed to stacking alacrity and quickness permanently.  The game would feel too slow for them. If done, it'll have to be done along some huge change to 'shake up the meta' and pull back players to compensate for the backlash, and that'll have to be something to the level of new elite specs.
---
It is kind of like f2p Eve extra light.  Sort of a Guiness vs. Coors Light in the comparesen.  There is enough of a sandbox to play in without too much of an on rails experience.  There is enough of a variation in how you play your role in a group to keep things from being stale but the min/max is way lighter and there is no need to HTFU.
---
I join random pugs through the LFG almost every single day. Just because it's not constantly overflowing with groups doesn't mean it isn't used regularly.
---
Same. I downloaded it again a few weeks ago and found my account exactly as I had left it years ago. Honestly felt like coming home. I'm having a blast just running around exploring, making new characters, checking out the new "meta" team builds, etc. If this was true, I'd absolutely love it, but there's no way it is, unfortunately.
---
you understand that if those 2 boons were base stats,every boss/mob in game whoud need +100% HP to balance it out?
---
Undeath changes are going to guarantee you are never out of life force.
---
What *is* expansion-level content anyway? Elite specs, game-changing mechanics (mounts, gliding etc), a massive map... and what else? I can't think of anything else that we would expect to only get from an expansion.
---
Elite specs are not likely because that is the kind of thing that you would expect to be announced, plus the logical time to release them would be at the beginning.
---
Game changing mechanics are not likely because they are also the kind of thing that you announce, plus you would want to release them at the beginning so that you can design the maps around that mechanic.
---
A massive map is possible but it won't be in episode two, and I would be very surprised if we got more than one.
---
That kinda leaves us with no expansion-level content to expect unless I am missing something else. In fairness though, Anets astonishing communication skills means that we won't know about any expansion content until 5 minutes before the patch.
---
OH It comes 
---
The train just has the wrong destination written on it and you get on
---
Sometimes the difference is only walking distance, sometimes you have to take the train going back
---
3. Fractals can be interesting, Anet decided on not making them that way.
---
Which trait or skill would you consider to be most garbage?
---
What the heck would "continual play" mean? Open world? No zones? Either of those would be a complete rebuilding from the ground up of *everything*. I.e. *at least* as much work as making a new game.
---
If instead it just means continued development that would be marginally more realistic. Still about as likely as them announcing gw3. (extremely unlikely)
---
You won't give me diabeetus with your sweetness!
---
I have [the antidote](https://youtu.be/XFkzRNyygfk)!  
---
Ah...   
---
Much better.
---
Its hilarious how accurate this is.
---
It scale just fine.  Do you actually have a 4k monitor?  I am guessing you don't.  I max my shit out just fine with a 2080ti and an i7 9700.  Shit runs great and looks great on it set at max setting.
---
holy shit record like a normal person what the fuck
---
While it is getting changed (a bit) in the next patch, some appreciation should be shown for [Blinding Ashes](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blinding_Ashes): A single application of blind on an 8s icd on a class that will constantly be applying burning and thus has no chance to use it tactically. Not only that but it's a *grandmaster* trait.
---
&gt;Dropping support for a failed system is often the best choice
---
Ah yes, abandoning systems and shitting out new ones, something ArenaNet has extensive experience with.
---
&gt;Is stopping a good thing? also yes.
---
It's only a good thing if A) you buy into the narrative that the dropped systems are "failed" to begin with, and B) if there's anything even remotely comparative to replace them with. I'm sorry, but strikes are not good enough to replace raids, fractals, WvW and PvP. They're just alienating anyone who wants more than a handful of hours of singleplayer story and open world every few months, and trust me, that's not a good thing.
---
Hey now, turrets were meta for leather farm :p
---
FALL DAMAGE WARRIOR BUILD
---
I mean, I'm fine... Help when you don't have a 12 years old potato.
---
Blizzard has alerady discarded remastering D1 and D2. They'll have to basically remake the game, and it'll likely take a chunk of players from D4, so they prefer to have the Classic team just do standard maintainance for DII, extended maintenance for DIII, and then have the diablo team focus on D4.
---
Also, there's a very healthy modding community doing great things with both D1 and D2, and there's just no way they can do something better without a considerable commitment that there's just no way their Activision overlords would allow.
---
Well forgive me for not wanting to cry about maintenance mode 24/7 like every discussion in here evolves into nowadays
---
&gt; Dervish 
---
So, reaper?
---
Already buying a new character slot!
---
No, that would do...because majority of these people don't have anything occupying their time in the game, and the things that they do have are stale, because nothing changes. Especs change every single gamemode.
---
If you don't know what majority means, then look it up; because it's most certainly not the same thing as all.
---
New launcher :)
---
But in all seriousness, look at Draconis Mons. Nice movement mechanic mastery that is actually useful on the huge map they introduced and lengthy story with better events and meta. Whatever we got last release is just sad.   
---
And before you say that there is going to be 2nd half of the map... It should be twice the size of Draconis. Bjora should be more packed with events and story since the map is small - which did not happen.
---
Uh....excuse me? Plenty of MMOs have it, living world/sagas/whatever are literally just story updates that every successful MMO has done for years. They are nothing new.
---
People been shitting on p/d since vanilla. You think your comment triggered me? Lol.
---
so they killed dungeons, fractals, raids, allegiance, what other trains are their? extremely basic and boring train that comes every 3 months and shows nothing exciting?
---
Oh yeah that trait is definitely garbage, I remember other revs talking about it. The only theoretical situation you would pick it is while wielding Mace, but you wouldn't go for ferocity while wielding Mace so its pointless.
---
On Strength of the Fallen, the cleanse it gives is automatic meaning you have no control over it and it can afaik trigger and go on cooldown when  you have no condis, not to mention competitor trait offers on demand cleanse with same cleanse per second. The downstate degen decrease can actually be counterproductive as well, especially in competitive setting as you want to die and respawn as quickly as possible and it would be in the enemy's best interest to keep you in downstate for as long as possible (if you are not capturing).
---
Where do you get the restored ones for free?
---
Yes please, we need good mmo's :)
---
Imagine being able to jump in gw1 :0
---
They do.  It is good that they have artists working on the gem store.  I would be fine with them continuing to use some of their budget on artists working on gem store stuff.  I want more new content more than new shiny stuff. I think 90% of the player base thinks this.  
---
I have fuck all luck with any RNG much less dice and card games that have less to do with player skill.  I have spent $0 on gemstore stuff and spent very little time grinding.  the idea of the legendary scavenger hunts is cool but I have yet to grind a legendary of any kind because I really can't give 2 fucks about building one at this point.  Since launch, 3484 hours played with no precursor.  I know that the craftable legendaries have been a thing for a while but by the time that occured I have given up and the lack of player count in some of the maps makes the scavenger hunt a long grind so whatever.
---
Sorry, back on topic; There is a need for more gem store updates.  The gemstore could use a little more creative thinking and could add different utilities.  I think there is plenty of room for the gemstore to grow where it would not be detrimental to the game.  Focusing more on delivering good content in all other aspects of the game should be the top priority.  Bringing different events to older maps would be pretty fucking cool.  Just like the craftable legendaries, bringing new content to the original maps and HOT maps would be a good thing to do.  Tripple Trouble is a great example of fun challenging content.  Even without a loot pinata at the end, people will do them because they are hard to do.
---
There was 400 staff not including HR or Accounting but Admins, coders, game testers, and the like but they were part of side projects that got cancelled and the game has be reduced down to like around 200 people removing around 100 of the people working on said projects. 
---
https://www.geekwire.com/2019/guild-wars-2-developer-arenanet-confirms-layoffs-canceled-projects/
---
Actually 257 to be exact, so I was wrong so they have around 255 people working at Anet right now as we know of (I am counting the recent departures of lost devs. We could also count Mike O' Brien leaving, also including Tirzah Bauer and Isaiah Cartwright so that drops it down by three to 252 people we know of left.
---
Edited: My bad did the math wrong looked at something else.
---
It’s a possibility. We will likely never know thpugh :(
---
Except it is simple and easy...unless they are rushing...which would mean poor time management.
---
Remind us all again how many months it's been since PoF...
---
The sword trait was changed years ago to work on all weapons, not just sword. Sword just doesn't need to crit to stack it up. But if you're not critting, then you're not using the ferocity either. 
---
When it was actually used, vicious lacerations only increased sword damage.
---
And I'm not arguing that SotF is good, just that it's not outclassed at the same thing by another trait that competes for the same spot in the same line.
---
So their staff is actually half of what people keep memeing. Got it.
---
Picture a scatter plot, with all the dots and the line.
---
People assume most players are all uniform in their opinions, and would be concentrated in one point for what they want the most.  As if there was a clear majority. Something like this:
---
https://davidcarslaw.github.io/openair/reference/scatterPlot-1.png
---
In reality, it'll be more like something like this:
---
https://www3.nd.edu/~nancy/Math30530/Matlab/Demos/Chapter2/chapter2_demo_01.png
---
All over the place. Some agree in some things, but hardly any real common points.
---
These people don't care about facts, unfortunately.
---
Every time they tried to change WvW, the entrenched playerbase rioted.
---
Fractals and Raids are tacked-on additions to a game that never wanted or needed them.
---
Ah yeah I remembered that version then.
---
As you progress in the achievement liked above, they are awarded in the tiered rewards.
---
OK boomer.
---
You have to click on specific sigil slot when you try to insert the new one.
---
The new map has a really good meta?... Its unengaging, way too long, and the final construct fight is anti climatic as hell. Its one of the worst one Anet has put out. Most chain event are also very anticlimatic, especially the boneskinner one, its a real joke.
---
A new profession, guild halls and elite specs are the only expansion exclusive features up until now.
---
A VR game yeah. Problem is I don't have a VR headset, let alone the space to use it. 
---
There's a reason it's not called Half Life 3.
---
As stated before, for the number of players actually raiding there are few that actually use the LFG. 11 million strong yet only sellers stay up contstant... I don't know you guys are trying to prove. Is this screenshot not a common occurrence? Yes, yes it is. 
---
People use LFG but it is not common for the majority of raiders to use this unless absolutely necessary. What veteran raider wants to deal with pugs?
---
Well my laptop maybe isn't god tier but I think i7-7700hq and gtx 1050ti should be able to run a 7 year old game smoothly
---
I mean... mine is...
---
Low effort meme gif ... La sigh.
---
To be honest Bjora has a lot of events spawning pretty fast. However, they all have difficulty of level 20 map and most of them are just killing a champion that has no meaningful mechanics and dies too quickly.
---
People on forums constantly ask for builds specifically made to solo champions, but I find it kinda easy in zerk/mara gear on a sword weaver on a good amount of LS maps. Not to mention that getting an extra person or two makes is too trivial.
---
Makes me wonder if people are playing gw2 with legs so they struggle so much with open world content.
---
I sell with a few of these groups and here's my advice: if you are in NA, join the Raider's Academy discord and learn raids. \[ https://discord.gg/gw2ra \] Most people who buy raids feel like they have no time and/or don't want to put in the time for it, but the time requirement isn't a ridiculous amount. You don't need to commit a full 24 hours to it, but maybe 1-2 hours. If you can't do 1-2 hours a week for training, that's understandable too (I don't want to come across as condescending).
---
We should all want more people in the raiding community, because even I want there to be more groups in the lfg besides just sellers.
---
owo thats me
---
EU isnt much better either, aside from Monday and Sunday
---
Open world is important to keep the big open world casual crowd. Neglecting community content results in a lack of core- and hardcoreplayers. Which are usually "the core" of your playerbase, which form communities and keep each other active ("I need help").
---
For what do I need a guild in Guild Wars 2? Dungeons, fractals, raids, guildmissions, WvW. That's what guilds are advertising with. Content neglected by Anet.
---
Singleplayer games struggle to keep players invested for years. More of the same is at some point not good enough anymore.
---
It's mostly anti-epicstore rhetoric with "red scare" (anti-China/tencent) sprinkled on.
---
I would imagine a much larger uproar from the [250mil+ users of Epic Launcher](https://www.statista.com/statistics/746230/fortnite-players/) (based on Fortnite players) if it was as bad as they claim.
---
Eanet cult
---
Saying "We need to put out the fire" while the house is burning is not being negative and cynical, its being realistic.
---
Saying this is "fine" while the house is on fire however is being a white knight.
---
What?
---
Oh, are you implying I'm just part of an "anet is perfect" cult?
---
Did you consider that I enjoy something you don't and you enjoy something I don't? I'm not happy they appear to be abandoning you, but that doesn't mean I can't be happy that they are producing the exact content I want from them.
---
Yikes
---
So you... Do think it's wrong of me to continue enjoying the parts of the game that are still getting updated?
---
Yeah this is why people think you’re a cult if you are asking me that.
---
I'm sure its nothing. Yep, nothing.
---
you forgot about rocket (god) boots
---
I have played some training raids, but I wasn't criticizing them, I was criticizing you for mocking a gamemode like that. I radicalized my opinion to reflect your tone as satire.
---
Raids in this game are fine. I can't do them due to time problems and personal preferences, but my criticisms of the gamemode are very similar to what a lot of raiders have, but the details there are pretty much off topic here.
---
What you listed is all content from like 5 years ago. As for what WoW has that is like that are the OW raid encounters, which dont happen even 20 minutes like in gw2, but are far more difficult and rewarding to complete.
---
What table tho....
---
There needs to be more Gadget skill types, you could even just add that skill tag to existing abilities such as the Shield Skills, Rifle 5 or Hammer 3 . 
---
Another buff they could add is additional toolbelt recharge rate to bring some insane cool downs to more reasonable amounts, whilst keeping spammable traits relatively the same (Percentages can only affect so much) and allow a choice between Kinetic Battery.
---
you too friend.
---
Yeah... I see him asking you legitimate questions with reasoning and you are just trying to weirdly not answer and just hurl insults.
---
I don't think he's being the unreasonable one here.
---
8 new dungeons with 3 explorable paths each and nice bossfights...one can dream.
---
Where did he even remotely say that? You're coming across as unhinged, my man. Slow your roll and READ what he is typing. It'll make your answers look a lot less petulant.
---
You're making vast generalizations. I don't reply to every thread. I don't start threads that say the game is thriving and everything is peachy. I see hyperbole and misinformation and I react to it. Because I should. Really everyone should. Seeing someone say something that is misleading isn't particularly making this subreddit better.  If you don't like what I have to say feel free to downvote it. But suggesting I stop is a waste of your time, because it's fairly unlikely that will happen.
---
You still can't damage them till the effect ends though it only lasts a short time in PvP/WvW. Engineers also have [Elixer S](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elixir_S) to evade all attacks, Elementalists have [Obsidian Flesh](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Obsidian_Flesh) (though focus isn't common), [Mist Form](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mist_Form) / the [downstate version](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Vapor_Form) where they turn into mist and can move away, or [Fortify](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Fortify) if they have an earth shield. Also players inside their spawn in WvW are invulnerable till they get a good distance away and NPCs that guard structures spawn with 5 minutes of [Righteous Indignation](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Righteous_Indignation) giving them invulnerability.

EU, 250-300+. The problem with kp is that 100cm was released more than 2 years ago, and people can have 200+kp even if they cleared it once a week,  or farmed it even way before the current meta, or somehow else aren't quite up to the standarts. And if you ask for a hure amount of kp, you lose people who are relatively new, but decent and those who sold essences. Normally we would have another CM with new, more actual kind of kp, just like raids did, but I guess it won't happen.
---
So because kp isn't as good at ensuring that you get the kind of people you want to pay with, a lot of players prefer to do fractal with people they already, so maybe you should do some networking too and get a list of such contacts.
---
How do you know how many people it appeals to?  The simple fact is you don't. You're making a guess. And people have mostly heard about this game through word of mouth anyway, not some great advertising campaign. People have been saying that for years.  I know you're disenfranchised and I know you think there aren't enough people like me to keep the game stable for a long long time to come. But that's just it. It's what you believe. 
---
The fact is, even with all the bellyaching, the dollars that are coming in are still fairly stable. The quarterly report is a better barometer to me than what you think.  I'm still doing all the stuff I want to do in game. Still people all all the metas I go to, even if there are more metas than ever. 
---
I think hard core players will leave, they'll be slowly replaced by casual players and live will go on.  You believe something different, but it's not a fact. It's just what you believe.

Most of the current playerbase don't know the pre nerf thrill

The thing though is that we cannot put out the fire. Calling the fire department who can (in our case, ArenaNet) is a good initiative but when it devolves to the hundredth 'yeah good luck they never answer'... yeah we know you know?
---
Also in this case the house being on fire is subjective so there is bound to be multiple views on the subject. Hanlon's razor and all that.
---
I'd take that wager and very sure you'd lose. Sure for you and your friends that's probably true. But the number of people who farm every achievement, every weapon, every skin, every mini, who run the metas over and over...do you think a single raid has ever attracted more people over time than say Palawadan?  I'm not thinking so. But I still find people running around even older LS zones. Not in big zergs obviously but constantly and continuously. 
---
No I think you misjudge the amount of time someone can spend in a new zone, even a small one like the current zone. There were full full maps doing the meta last night and I had to go on a fifth map. Sure it's new. But it's being played by a lot of people.  WHile this is going on people are still running Dragonfall. The meta in Thunderhead Peaks is still getting done. 
---
Obviously there's no way to judge who'd win this wager, but I'm pretty sure those that play the content I play are far more numerous than you think.

Well. Anet not only said it's not an MMO (and they'd know better), but when Guild Wars 2 came out they said they wanted to make a true MMO and it was one of the reasons they moved on from Guild Wars 1. 
---
Your consensus is just not true. Most people I've talked to over the years that played the game know it's not an MMO, because during it's heyday, MMO had one very specific definition. It had a persistent world. You played in a persistent world. Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a persistent world and is thus a lobby game, not an MMO.
---
The biggest complaint people had coming to Guild Wars 2 to try it from say WOW was that it wasn't an MMO.   Saying that Guild Wars 1 is the same kind of game as Guild Wars 2 to MMO players who came from actual MMOs would be misleading.

SERPENT'S TOUCH
---
This Thief trait is at the start of the Deadly Arts line, and it's a minor trait, so you have to choose it if you want anything from Deadly Arts. It makes Steal poison the target, which puts you in combat. WHY WOULD A THIEF GO INTO COMBAT WITH STEAL unless they CHOSE TO MUG. I hate it. Lemme steal and shadowstep away from passive critters as I will, please. It's not even remotely noticeable damage.
---
GW2 open world stopped being group content a very long ago. Gone are the days of LW1 and LW2, and HoT was the true last *real* open world group content we got.
---
And don't even get me started on hardcore world bosses like the reworked Tequatl or Triple Trouble. Such a wasted opportunity.
---
I didn't explain myself properly, I meant applying the "legend" concept to all elite specializations, not just the revenant's.
---
So each necromancer elite spec would be based on some famous necromancer, living or dead (or undead). Reaper could have been Desmina, and Scourge could have been Joko.
---
&gt;The thing though is that we cannot put out the fire. Calling the fire department who can (in our case, ArenaNet) is a good initiative but when it devolves to the hundredth 'yeah good luck they never answer'... yeah we know you know?
---
No, but we can keep calling until they actually respond, which they are fully capable of doing.
---
Anet still refuses to actually give us a meaningful awnser on what is going on. No they cannot develop a new expansion out of the blue if they already weren't developing it but they CAN communicate and tell us what the future of the game is.
---
Are we ever going to get a new expansion? What are the actual plans for the full saga? Do they plan to give out elite specs or any meaningful new mechanics like gliding and mounts? Does the game have a future?
---
Tell us what is going on.
---
&gt; Also in this case the house being on fire is subjective so there is bound to be multiple views on the subject.
---
Ok, let's check:
---
* Dungeons - Dead, abandoned and burried.
---
* Guilds and Guild Content - Dead
---
* Fractals - Abandoned (last one was a year ago), Lead Designer quit
---
* Raids - Dying, Lead Designer quit
---
* PvP - Dying, Swiss tournament status? Unknown.
---
* WvW - Dead, Alliance status? Lmao as if
---
* Expansions - "~~Living world~~ Sagas are replacing them"
---
* Elite specs - Status unknown
---
* New legendaries - "On the table"
---
* Balance - lmao
---
* Living World - 30 minutes every 4 months.
---
Subjectivity only takes you so far.
---
Hard agree. Especially because most of the Elite Specs have so many meaningful choices, it really makes all the boring numbers in Core Specs stand out. I wouldn't mind having minor traits be relegated to +numbers, but even then, it begs the question why level 1 players can't just have those numbers to begin with.
---
&gt; singleplayer 
---
sure. i play them too. but a single player game as good as it can be has a limited map and a ending. a single player mmo (plz accept the definition) has gigantic maps and they keep on adding quest on quest. single player has that too : they call it dlc. no tx
---
that's why i play gw2 as a single plaer game and it's perfect from this point of view. belive it or not i have multiple friends in real life (40 years old more or less) who do the same with gw2.
---
And his is why you treat the game as a service instead a product, and make accounts and the characters in them personal and nontransferable.
---
We already have whales
---
But im here for great combat system.
---
Runescape story quests are fully solo as an MMORP and it still has one of the best questlines for story and amusement. GW2 isn't unique in this and especially not the best.
---
And who the fuck cares about wasted resources on maps that people neglect after a couple of months? There is a reason other MMO's don't do this, they rather put the devs on stuff that lasts longer and/or increase quality on existing stuff (which GW2 doesn't do).
---
Another low effort meme post. Not constructive criticism... La sigh, for sure. Anet has no content? This post has no fracking content.
---
&gt;gw2is the only mmo which can be played as a single player game since u can do everything without speaking a single word with others
---
...That's the way I play ESO and FFXIV.
---
Sure, but you usually had to give up *something* to get that, whether it was a utility/elite slot or having to take a specific weapon set. I can't even remember if any classes got a traited speed boost at launch, but if they did it probably wasn't in a line that gave DPS stats because trait lines had stats attached back then and you only got enough points for about 2 and a third lines instead of getting a full 3.
---
Everyone has permaswiftness or the equivalent nowadays, of course, but that's after the better part of a decade worth of power creep.
---
If you click show details it would help considerably. It could be anything with that error code
---
&gt; but this is something simple 
---
Nothing is ever simple with gw2 engine...
---
WoW-like flying is a cancer for MMORPG. Shouldn't exists.
---
WoW griffon masters, GW2 waypoints, and ESO shrines are much better in that regard.

It doesn't take a genius to realise that what one sees in game informs how one thinks about the world. That doesn't mean that the lore can't contain things which aren't shown, but they're certainly more likely to make it feel like the two are actually part of the same world. Nor does it mean that everything one can do in game has to be part of the lore.

---
1. Locate your **Gw2.exe** file.
---
2. Right-click on the file and select **Create shortcut**.
---
3. Rename this new shortcut to **Guild Wars 2 Repair**.
---
4. Right-click on **Guild Wars 2 Repair** and select **Properties**.
---
5. Locate the **Target** line and add **–repair** to the end. (*Example:* "C:\\Games\\Guild Wars 2\\gw2.exe" -repair)
---
6. Click **OK**.
---
Best of luck!
---
The message should be much longer than this. Can you try again and make sure you copy all of it? 
---
Usually though, the problem is that your video card's drivers need updated or Windows needs updated.
