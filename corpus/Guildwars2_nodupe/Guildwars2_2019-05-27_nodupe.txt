There's two kinds of playing solo. You'll find it hard to solo because there are usually other people around. But they don't cut into your rewards, neither loot or experience, nor do they hamper your game play. You don't have to talk to them or group with them for most content.
---

---
There's a looking for group tool for harder content, which also doesn't require much more than reading the group you want, and joining it. It's easy to solo.
---
---
---
I'd recommend going p/p and sword in your off hand as sword pistol brings great cleave for trash mobs and p/p brings a lot of damage. If you get the daredevil spec, swap out the sword for the staff as it brings more damage and more mobility, and keep p/p as your ranged swap. If you get deadeye, play around with rifle and see if you like it more than p/p and choose one of those and equip sword/pistol in your offhand.
---
Makes it sound like all the Elder Dragons are just fighting for superiority of Tyria with each other rather than us - as in they need to stake a big claim and their territory with minions or face getting consumed by another ED that's has a better set-up.
---
Interesting. That makes me think of some bigger end game to all this, the cycles just being a convenient way for us to surmise their behavior but perhaps we have it all wrong?
---
Are the LS tomes / pages worth the investment?
---
If you have access to the map events in the dailies, just do it. Those scrolls help me get the last few level to 80. For some reason I get tired on leveling past level 71 then I just use tomes to 80.
---
Is assassin's promise and norn shouts still most comfortable build?
---
As a corollary to this: the value of a set of tools is in the convenience.  You're paying for the convenience of never having to worry about one character's tools.  Whether that or the 2700 gems worth of gold is worth more is up to each person.
---
The exceptions to this are the tools that provide extras.  The Watchwork Pick, for example, will pay for itself much, much more quickly.  The Consortium Sickle has a slightly faster gathering animation, so you're getting even more convenience with that one.  And obviously the unbound/volatile magic tools potentially have a lot of value depending on how you spend your magic.
---
Actually last teatime was very good, it had INKs, Deroir and Wooden potatoes and had lots of intelligent discussion. But when there is nothing to talk about and the guests are idiots (Bik), it is shit.
---
Requiem light pants are fishnets?
---
I'm actually astonished by the engine of planetside, but already the one of PS1 was able to  handle hundreds of players.  
---
For GW I guess it is a combination of bad netcode and bad CPU-/multicore usage that causes the troubles when players come together.
---
Heeeeeelp!
---
If it is about map completion and not leveling, doing HP solo has never been easier than with my boon chronomancer, which needs you to have HoT, be lvl 80 and a shield with decent gear, which may not be the fastest solution.
---
Playing core thief with Invigorating Precision and a zerk gear (Citadel of Flames armor) has movespeed, sustain and DPS a lot
---
Reaper / warrior are great alternatives (also core Necro minion master, the summonings will tank everything)
---
You can check more builds here: https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World/Soloing
---
&gt; Ill wait til the the copper salvager goes on sale.
---
Don't bother. Just go buy it at full price. Life is so much simpler once you have it.
---
Tell me more about staff mirage please, how do you play it?
---
Right, I was referencing how "Domain of Kourna" (for example) went "&lt;noun&gt; of &lt;adjective&gt;" instead of the standard "&lt;adjective&gt; &lt;noun&gt;" such as "Sandswept Isles"
---
It's no Game of thrones but it is interesting enough and the world is quite cool. I personally don't care much for the characters though.
---
Ranger can use their pet to keep things at a distance.
---
Thank you for this guide, I used it from day 1 &lt;3
---
Deadeye has really bad AoE / mobility so I'd recommend Daredevil (melee staff) which has better cleave and huge mobility
---
Dragonhunter has also huge AoE dps, plus decent mid-range dps (greatsword/scepter). The quickbrand power alternative is a huge bliss in open world as well, bringing quickness on top of the rest
---
Zhaitan's pretty cool that they foreshadow him throughout the personal story. Orr has good atmosphere. Final fight is lacking. Minions are pretty neat, bit of a standard zombies and some more crazier designs. "Curse your eyes" way too good of a line for cheesy the vanilla story writing is otherwise. The ships look kinda stupid, though.
---
Mordremoth's final form was pretty lame but the final zone is really good in atmosphere. Mordrem are hit or miss in design. The wolves are great. Relationship to Sylvari was pretty neat.
---
Branded Ascalon is pretty eerie and good in atmosphere. Somehow loses atmopshere as it goes to Elonia. Many of the branded zones feel like they might as well be Jormag zones if you palette-swapped them from purple to blue. Aurene storyline is great, his introduction after Balthazar was great, the latest part was a bit on the nose by humanizing Kralk. The thing is that I can't remember a defining music for Kralkatorrik and the branded zones. There's the humming ambiance in Ascalon, but beyond that, nothing. For the minions, could've used more of that molded, metallic look for advanced models. His presence on the world map was really neat.
---
Primordus barely got any presentation. There's something cool about the shapes of his minions, but beyond that nothing really sticks. Apparently had a bit of a war with the Dwarves and the Flame Legion has some affinity him, I guess that's cool.
---
Jormag, the deep frost is cool and the fleeing Kodans are cool foreshadowing world-building.
---
--------------------------------
---
Bottom line: I think that the brand in Ascalon is my favourite dragon-corrupted zone aesthetically and he had some good story involvement, but I think Mordremoth had much more oomph overall.
---
Renegade is also a solid choice because it's the only other class providing Alacrity.  
---
Don't worry too much about META. Player skill account for 80% of the effectiveness because ANet keeps classes relatively close in balance.
---
Do you happen to know if this bug affects the Skyscale Flight collection? The Jahai Bluff rift didn't give me credit even though the achievement text says I did it. Happened yesterday afternoon and got frustrated that after the grind I was screwed out. Decided to see if reset maybe would fix it but nope. https://imgur.com/a/6hiYYKt
---
Don't worry too much about playing a META build.
---
Player skill account for 80% of the effectiveness because ANet keeps classes relatively close in balance.
---
cool, ill start with dailies and dugneons and go from taht
---
Look, in the water!
---
Oh man those old cardboard boxes were amazing, I still remember the smell of the factions box!
---
I feel like my strength in GW2 comes from my skill at the game rather than my gear. I spend a lot of time doing raids and fractals, so most other PvE content kind of just falls over and dies from my perspective.
---
Classes are very different at level 80 when you have better gear, 3 trait lines, and elite specialization.  
---
Mesmer struggle while leveling the most, especially if you don't know how to build it for leveling.
---
Brothers, sisters! Ready yourselves!  Tequatl is here!
---
Mirage is an elite specialization, which requires you to be 80 and own the POF expansion.  It's a condition damage build (uses Viper ideally, can use cheaper options like Rabid) that uses staff.  Most of the damage comes from the DOTs you and the clones apply with auto-attacks.  The build is really survivable due to your clones distracting mobs and the range/mobility of the staff.
---
Just get the highest one your character can use. Copper pinching doesn't make up for all those "ruined ore/plant/lumber" you get by not paying attention. Even the most expensive tools are only 8 copper per use.
---
Better technique does get you higher numbers with the same gear, tho.
---
That's untrue. Same gear, better technique gets you more damage. If you get your rotation right, with buffs and everything, and you do it perfectly all the time you'll have more damage than if you don't do it perfectly. If you dodge  better, you won't be knocked down or downed and you'll do more damage. I do more damage with the exact same gear now than I did a year ago.
---
No idea why you got downvoted, we need some kind of "dismount and send your mount to hit some mobs at long range" option to cater to ranged builds. At the moment it's better to dismount normally than to engage if you're playing a ranged build.
---
I don't think so. Soulbeast can do some pretty good damage.
---
It's based around infinite horizons copying ambush skills like the axe version, but you're ranged and have a lot more leeway with avoiding damage.
---
They never nerfed dungeon rewards. They reduced rewards from repeating a single path over and over, then from repeating the same few paths over and over.
---
Now to get full rewards you have to do at least 8 different paths. If you do that, you actually get more rewards than before.
---
So quit GW2 and stick to FFXIV. Got it.
---
Hey man, hope it's fixed but if not could you let us know the specifications of the PC? 
---
CPU/RAM/OS all that juicy stuff, also and I assume it is based on the 1080, is it a desktop or a laptop?
---
I mean, what's the maximum resolution possible for the monitor and or TV you're using, it would be weird but it could be trying to force the Fullscreen mode into a wonky resolution. Also when you say "He predicted this would be the problem based on other games" I take that to mean he's had the same exact issue with other games? Suffice to say this is not something that should ever be happening on a 1080.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Also... I don't know your CPU which could make this next question utterly stupid and pointless but it's worth asking anyway and please don't take this as an insult because it really isn't, basic mistakes are the majority - are you sure you're monitor or screen is plugged into the graphics card and no the motherboards HDMI or VGA port? You'd be surprised how common a mistake that is and it'd be a far better explanation as to your resolution issues, especially if you're playing in a fairly high resolution as most integrated graphics will struggle with it or not do it all especially were games are concerned.
---
Is this the same build as showcased in places like metabattle? If not, is it possible for you to share a link?
---
Any point to doing unique fractals vs just spamming jade maw?
---
Neither, do the fractal dailies on T4 for the most bang for your buck.
---
Since op is not 80 yet, I'm not gonna suggest any HoT or PoF spec; As core class for open world(solo-ish content) necromancer and thief shines big time, both with life steal potential from damage that you do, both have a very strong weapon for tagging and soloing! Strongly recommend u.u
---
What a retort! Good points made mate.
---
the rewards are fine. The rewards are still limited to Exotics &amp; Core Tyria Stats; so for post-expansion life they are primarily for skins and gearing alts in exotics (at leas that's how I see them)
---
People got this "nerf" pretty wrong. 
---
Before, you got 1g cash for each path daily, 1,5g for Ascalon and 2g(?) for Arah. 
---
After the "nerf" you get ~35s cash for each path daily, 50s for Ascalon and 1g for Arah *plus* 5g cash after finishing 8 different paths.
---
So after 8 paths without Ascalon and Arah it's 8g(old) vs 7,8g(new). With Ascalon it's 9,5g(old) vs 8,5g(new). And with Arah it's 11g(old) vs 9,75(new). 
---
So at this point we see that the cash rewards were way less nerfed than most people think. 
---
But that's not all, there are three more points. 
---
1.) The achievements, where you got the 5g for 8 paths, reset after it's done, it's *not* bound to any daily resets. So if you want to farm dungeons massively, you will be able to get way more gold after the "nerf" than before.
---
2.) Not only the cash reward has been "nerfed", also the Dungeon Token gain were doubled. Actually the chest token were doubled, so now you get 100 token instead of 80 (20 are not in the chest but given after finishing a path too). This means 40 more tokens for each path. 
---
Regarding to [GW2 efficency](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/dungeon-tokens) you can get ~30c or ~4s per token, depending on how you use them. Thats ~12s or ~1,6g more than before the "nerf". So this bonus equalize the less cash gain (more or less).
---
3.) And last but not least together with the 5g, you also geht a Chest of Dungeoneering from that achievement, where you can pick a bag of 150 tokens of your choice. That means another ~45s or 6g in addition. 
---
So all in all you get even *more* gold after the "nerf" than before, it's just a little less cash. The "nerf" was actually a buff (and even without tokens, only a small nerf), but people sadly got it wrong. 
---
To answer your question, no they didn't change the reward since then, but dungeons are more worth doing than they were before the "nerf".
---
&gt; "You could have all the legendary armor and weapons in the game, but you're marginally more powerful than a level 10 in the same zone. "
---
You're marginally more powerful in these zones so you're not dominating the field for the new people who have Basic gear so players feel involved and more importantly, equal.
---
Discuss.
---
Firstly, they are not economical (they will take around ten thousand uses per tool to pay for themselves), just convenient. And then mainly if you spend most of your time on one character. They are much less useful if you play alts as you have to remember to swap the tools to your bank or shared slots every time you switch characters.
---
A free way you can get some of the benefit is: if you run out of tools go to your guild hall, find the master scribe, click "I need scribe supplies", buy tools, then exit the guild hall from the guild dialog to go back to wherever you were. You can also use the PvP and WvW lobby to similar effect, or to get a free gate to Lions Arch. And you can use the scribing station in your guild hall to access your bank.
---
Personally I just carry a spare set of oricalcum tools on all my characters.
---
If you have the gems to spare, I would look at the copper fed salvage o matic, extra bank tabs, extra character slots, and shared inventory slots as higher priorities.
---
There are soulbeast builds that let you delete people in PvP within a second or two. For PvE it hardly matters if you can burst or not, you'll be more busy with cleaving or aoe to tag enough things fast enough.
---
Throw some holo cheese for chrono and desert coffee for gathering, then this list is what op is looking for u.u
---
You think so? To me, my character feels like some Avenger surrounded by a bunch of red shirt extras.   
---
I mean, any story mission, event, fractal, etc has my lone guy + maybe a few fellows stampeding through an armada of mooks that have absolutely no hope of breaking us. Also is it canon that we can throw flaming swords, speed up time and do all sorts of Dragon-level sorceries when everyone else apparently only knows how to basic attack + red circle smash?   
---
Outside of PVE, that "level 10" is also supposed to be the Commander in their own story so it still feels natural to me that they'd be powerful like me. No matter where we are, we are all always *"The Hottest Kid on the Map"* and I am okay with sharing that title.   
---
My wish for the future of "Endgame"? Some more polish on the different directions you could go.   
---
* Make WvW more attractive and add to the mechanics a bit. New mounts that support your WvW campaign (Dolyak/"Elephant" type mount that can carry excess supply to-and-fro, etc), a mechanic change that buffs roaming parties/makes small groups feel more impactful vs zergs, and whatever else. 
---
* "Buff" Dungeons and give players more incentives to run them. Maybe randomize some parts of them -- like add "special surprise bosses" that have a chance to appear in an instance, rewarding players that find and slay them with great loot. 
---
* Advertise PVP more? Continue to balance and smooth out the interface experience for players? Like allowing them to queue from the PVE world, possibly (if that's what the community wants) so that they can hop in and out at their leisure. 
---
* More raids! Make them fun, make them bigger. Also - more content like Dragon's Stand in the world. It feels like a good/inviting experience before players feel confident to queue for Raids/etc where others want everything done **perfectly**. 
---
* And my biggest dream -- revamped Guilds! Make them more exciting, streamline the application process, advertise more Guild vs Guild game modes and maybe create Guild/Commander abilities that can be used to help position/buff your guild in battle. Also find a way to make the player's invest in guilds without feeling like they are throwing away money/valuables to someone that may fail them in the future? I'm holding all these guild boost items feeling like a goof because I have no one to spend them on. oO
---
&gt;  but you're marginally more powerful than a level 10 in the same zone.
---
When I’m in a DPS build fully geared &amp; traited I destroy a level 10 in the same zone, and do it faster than a leve 10 player would because with downscaling I’ve got maximum stats.
---
I don’t think I have the same issue as you.  I’m curious about what makes you feel underpowered.  Unless you mean you want to 1-shot everything in a sub-80 map.
---
I’ve said it before.  It’s a really nice torch skin.
---
It will appear after 21 daily resets.
---
"Quick Fox! Do a barrelroll!"
---
Huh. Maybe I'm having the bug too then? I thought this was normal
---
bathroom breaks must have been troublesome.
---
It's one of the more...longer, to say the least, collections by far. 
---
FYI: You're going to need 250 of each map currency from each LS4 episode to get the mount. Best to start working on those as soon as you can since those are time-gated.
---
Hi, even i had the same issue just play around with graphic settings, main culprit is depth blur.  try this link 
---
 [https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk/issues/21](https://github.com/Joshua-Ashton/d9vk/issues/21)
---
Well the brand in Ascalon (~10 years old?) is already quite a bit less potent than the brand in Vabbi, (*brand* new at the time Vabbi is stuck in, so I imagine the Brand will decay similar to that, only faster.
---
Just do the wvw dailies, you can be done with them most of the time within ~15 minutes (unless it's a combination of keep + 2 levels) and you get free reward track progress.   
---
PVE dailies, unless you can do them incidentally, don't even bother.
---
They haven't been a problem for me either. Especially compared to the Flesh Wurms in Dragonfall.
---
For fun:
---
 \- ranked PvP. Yea I know most people think its bad, but I have fun with it just going for one or two games and not caring for the drama, be it wins or losses.
---
 \- WvW. I'm in a semi-organized fight guild that provides me with great fun on medium and large fights. If things are too laggy or crowded for my tastes I can still go on roaming/havoc. Roaming is still viable and fun even with Warclaw, the only thing warclaw made bad is ganking people that don't want to fight.
---
For Profit:
---
 \- Daily CMs+T4s. I do this if I can get a decent group. It gives really good profit and it can be fun with a good group.
---
 \- The PvP and WvW can be also quite profitable if you use the right tracks.
---
For achieves:
---
 \- Living world stuff. I run story and map achieves to complete certain things
---
 \- I choose the reward tracks from PvP and WvW based on what I'm trying to achieve. Got all HoT armor and weapons with the reward tracks, dungeon tokens for legendary weapons, etc...

5 seconds of quickness on dismount. A Godsend if you're planning on doing any sort of node farming especially the skyscale collection
---
You can get runes that increase poison or bleed duration, that way you can run bursting and venom or agony
---
I kinda wish that this was actually a thing.
---
Power Reaper (Necromancer specialty). As for levelling, Warrior was my first 80 as was the easiest.
---
I think that this ability should be a hold to show area of effect and the release to use the engage skill
---
\#kralkDidNothingWrong
---
Adult Swim
---
Yeah thats my whole point, if you plan of farming they end up being worth it but otherwise, they arent, 3k gems for 3 slots free in your inv and not having to waste 1 min each hour is a huge price. 
---
Its a matter of opinion, because if you plan on making them pay themselves, its kinda foolish, the numbers are crazy it takes like 2000 use to become worth it money-wise.
---
If your lv80 is only doing marginally more damage than a lv10 in the same zone I don't think you really know how to play the game, brah. You don't even need exotics for a lv80 to one hit in a lv10 zone.
---
Are you one of those players who only press '1' and nothing else?
---
Brings a tear to me eye, it does!
---
100% yes.
---
Making a new account would mean I'd have to rebuy the expansions though, wouldn't it?
---
"Levelling path" is an odd term for GW2, since exp scales (more or less) to your level, such that you can stay in the same place for 80 levels and get increasing amounts of exp to match.
---
I went to the levelling guide that you linked and it's pretty awesome! I'll concur with other posters that condition damage gear will be slightly harder to come across at a low level, but on the flipside, I'd argue that &lt;80 content is easy enough for you to play a bit slower. Do what's fun!
---
Since you've got a skill build laid out for you, I'll try to give you a levelling "route". Take note that while all activities give exp, the most exp will always come from events and event chains. I'd go to your starting area and "hang around" the first few hearts - early events and event chains tend to spawn there frequently for new players (e.g. firefly essences and mosquitoes in the first area of Caledon Forest, bandits poisoning the water in early Queensdale). Once you've run around the beginning map for your race (and maybe finished your first story step if that's your thing), go to your racial city and look for a purple circle on your map. This is an asura gate which will take you to Lion's Arch, where the gateway hub will have asura gates to ALL racial cities. This gives you access to all of the different zones (Shiverpeaks, Ascalon, Maguuma, Kryta) for dailies and for further exploration for more exp.
---
Lvl 1-15: Your beginning zone - explore, do events, get Hero Points! Maybe do hearts.  
---
Lvl 15-25: Brisban Wildlands (which all your characters will need to walk through eventually, if you intend to do the expansion content) - there are many ambient boars and moas in this area that people don't usually kill, so they store a lot of bonus exp.
---
Lvl 25-60: Start to aim to map-complete a region, like getting all of Kryta, or all of the Shiverpeaks. I find that having a goal like this makes my levelling pass a lot more naturally. Wander, do events, let yourself be distracted by champions and world bosses, keep moving until you've got a satisfying chunk of world map cleared up. I recommend either Kryta - which is relatively manageable and ends up in the north with the Modniir Ulgoth boss chain - or Shiverpeaks, because it ends in a max-level zone and includes beautiful, sprawling maps like Lornar's Pass and Timberline Falls.
---
Lvl 60+: At this point you'll be familiar enough with the game to be getting impatient. Start clearing through your personal story, which provides huge chunks of exp for each instance completion. Go for world bosses - Taidha in Bloodtide Coast, Tequatl in Sparkfly Fen - and between world boss events, farm the defense events and ambient creatures in those areas (plenty of Zintl defense events and Krait defense events in Sparkfly Fen, for example). If you levelled through your earlier levels with power gear, but you really want to try out those DoTs you mentioned, Level 60 is the point where you can start to have fun with condition damage all over the place.
---
Even in the early levels, events marked on your sidebar as \[Group Event\] will be much more rewarding than smaller individual events. If there's a group event that's happening but no one around, call it out on mapchat (e.g. "champion bandit up at \[shift-click the nearest POI\]"), and people will usually arrive.
---
Is there any way to tell whether I have that free transfer? I should have it, pretty sure I never transferred.
---
yeah, you're right that nouns can act like adjectives to modify other nouns (like bus driver), but the rules are a little more nuanced, so I thought I'd as a little more.
---
  
---
but I think if you understandthe what and when, that's ok lol. the why as how aren't as important
---
I think a sneak peak for season 5 would be possible and definitely appreciated since they just more or less concluded a long running story arc. Might be a bit too early but it would be possible.
---
This is fucking amazing lmao
---
Pick a world on the character select screen and click transfer, then look at the confirmation popup and see how much it costs
---
Start with fractals, It has a nice progression towards full ascended and the dailies will earn you quite a bit of gold (30+ daily at tier 4). I am playing right now if you wanna message me in game. Cooper Of The Sands is the toon I'm on. I'll run some fractals with you and teach you the basics.
---
yeah, can we open the pass now?
---
If I had to guess, it's specially hard coded for Skyscale in order to allow Bond of Vigor to work while stuck to a wall. Without Bond active, sticking to a wall, energyRegen = 0; multiply that (the way other mounts regen) it's still 0.
---
Congratulations on finishing the campaigns.
---
Now you're ready for the living story releases. I suggest starting with season 4 since it's still recent and alive. Then go back to season 3 and then 2 as a kind of a history lesson. 
---
On top of that, your can:
---
* do your 3 daily achievements for 2g
---
* star clearing fractals
---
* farm guild hall nodes daily
---
* farm home instance nodes for materials if any of your friends or guild members have one
---
* work on achievements
---
* start doing PvP
---
* start doing WvW
---
are we sure this is about tequatl?
---
doesn't seem to be enough Rs in the title
---
Don´t know if is still working, but server transfer used to be free if you deleted your chars (I´m not joking). It´s a good option if you started a few days/weeks ago.
---
if your build is correct, you can go straight to raids, also assuming you know how yo play your class. earn gold, get ascended gear then you can do t4 fractals. do not waste time on t1 fractals. you need ascended gear. getting gear in low level fractals will take you...idk months at least.
---
Diarmid was a Sylvari bro.
---
Yeah I love that you dont need to win to complete it, it helps but you still get some freebies completed just for showing up
---
YUP.
---
Guess yu should farm fractals and Sw for gold.
---
What functions does entering the API key in GW2TacO allow for?
---
Thank you, I'll focus on PoI/Events/Hero Points, picking up heart quests along the way. As u/[notanothergrammarbot](https://www.reddit.com/user/notanothergrammarbot/) suggested, I'll try to finish a region once I get to 25-30ish.
---
Great post! Just one thing I wanted to add. 
---
There are actually surprise bosses triggered by events in dungeons. Wooden potatoes just had a great series describing everything that exolorable mode dungeons offer.
---
I'm a casual player and only successfully completed less than 10 raids (with like 30+ wipes under my belt before I gave up) but holy shit, these guys are a whole new level noob.
---
I don't blame people for wanting the best builds and specs. Seasoned players just want to finish weekly raids asap and competitive ones want to WIN (duh). It's just common sense.
---
Wanting the best builds and specs for end game content are obviously a given in ANY online game. The author and commenters are obviously playing endgame content in an MMo for the first time year. If people complain about only having exotics fine, they are assholes. But your build better be as close to viable as possible.
---
These guys should just play core tyria only since they obviously are only able to deal with easy content.
---
Plebs!
---
If you're on a US server, hit me up in game. I can take you around to some of the farming hot spots. There's a lot more to explain than I could type in one post.  My in game name is Vayne.8563. I help a lot of people learn the game.
---
Is it a sin if I haven't watched GoT? :^)
---
Okay sounds good, I'm busy at the moment but I'll add you. Thank you. I've tried to go to where people do raids and fractals and I like am so confused. I did a hero point run earlier with a bunch of people (I just saw a ton of players chilling around so I asked what they were up to) and it was like the most fun I've had in the game lol.. but yeah I'll hit you up when i get on :)
---
&gt;Please community, either tell me what I'm doing wrong or spread the message.
---
While this fight and fractal is lengthy the crow fight does not need a nerf imo.
---
The wind and crows slam attack infront of her are the big threats. When you get blown off the ship you get lots of condis and is just an all around bad thing so focus on avoiding the wind. You can walk out of the wind gusts 95% of the time, for that other 5% use a dodge. The Chill aoe should ideally be dropped in one of the corners of the ship or at the bow depending on there you are, with that far away from the team its a non-issue. The green needs to be shared with at least one ally to spit the dmg, more allies inside the green the better. Her slam attack infront of her dazed for a long time so either move a couple feet to the side to avoid it or have lots of stab (stability is broken af in fractals). The adds spawn as the crow losses % hp and the stop spawning around the last 10-15%. To deal with the adds you can create bottle necks at the tops of the ramps, cc/ blind, reflects, more stab, cleave them down, and boon rip. Having boon rip means you dont have to deal with the protection on crow and no quickness. If your team cant kill her while mostly ignoring the adds it is a wise idea to clear some/most of them out when crow is between 50-60%.
---
There are really only 2 attacks that you need to worry about dodging, the wind and the chill aoe. The wind is one, getting knocked into the water is bad and slows everything down so either just walk out of the aoe or dodge if needed. The chill aoe because well it chills you and makes it so you can just walk out of the wind gusts, so letting it drop far away from the team and you dodge at the last second out so you dont get hit is ideal (just like flux bomb). Everything else should be taken care of with extra stab, projectile hate, boon rip, and decent positioning.

After finally getting to unlock the saddle portion of this achievement and realizing ive wasted my time as it is unlikely i will ever get the material needed to purchase the components i am more then pissed off. 250 of some of those will take me about a year to get. I dont have endless hours to farm that shit. And the little amount you can get for each one per day is a joke. Meanwhile i have an inventory full of bloodstone dust and other crap that does nothing but take room. So sorry if i am a little pissed about this but screw you Devs.

In TA, is there anything behind that one vined-off area to the right of the entrance to Aetherpath?

I really loved the design and presentation of the mordrem and how aggresive they were at trying to stamp out all resistance in the jungle.Mordremoth's generals that you fight during the dragon stand event  had some really amazing design but it was a shame their characters were not expanded on well.
---
This is so satisfying to watch
---
Griffon is still the speed demon it always was. Skyscale is basically a way to get through heavily mob infested areas without pulling aggro, an afk platform,  and a super-versatile glorified springer.

Happy cake day!

Are you on NA by chance? I'm looking for people that are 80 but still newer

None of the mechanics are hard to deal with its just that there is too many things to pay attention to and they all happen quite fast. The adds themselves also litter the ground with less visible AoE indicators.
---
All of that goes out of the window if you play Scourge though. Its pretty much the best boss for them.

Apparently, according to the lore dev stream, the Torment has been with Kralk for millennia, long before the Human Gods (including Abaddon and his Realm of Torment) came to Tyria.
---
It's related to the Elder Dragons' hunger and greed; the Elder Dragons can only process and use one type of magic, but they consume raw leyline magic which includes the full spectrum of all the different types of magic.
---
Why Kralk seems to be the only Elder Dragon with this level of torment caused by all the other non-compatible magics in the spectrum, is unclear. Maybe he's just especially bad at handling other magics. Maybe he's just especially greedy and doesn't purge the non-compatible magics from himself. Maybe all the dragons have some level of Torment afflicting them. This hasn't been covered yet.

If you look at the floor plan, they have a couple small booths next to each other near the entrance. They're not gonna be presenting anything new from a booth.

Well. Start is having a lot of money. Step two is buying Fashion Wars.
---
My guess is "Highly" sought after + not long in gem store combined with the fact we haven't gotten really good green dye(s) in years (jungle, forest, nightmare to name a few).
---
I would imagine after most people got lucky rng or bought off TP is when TP barons/hoarders acquire the remaining ones thus the demand is in the crazy thousands?
---
This is why if you got the gold you may as well buy them as soon as people start putting them on TP for like 100g or so. The more expensive popular ones go for 300g and it only gets worse as time goes on... just my experience with collecting dyes.
---
Broadly speaking, almost every class has both Power and Condition-based ranged options, and almost all of them are at least viable for open-world play (although ranged weapons are generally avoided in harder content), although different ones play in different ways. I would personally say that Greatsword Mesmer is actually one of the best options for the playstyle you're looking for, although Rifle Deadeye would also be a good fit.
---
I think that if people took a cocktail of powerful condition classes like Scourge, Mirage, Renegade or Firebrand she'd probably just melt to torment confusion and burning. Everything attacks super often and Crowe herself never actually shrugs off conditions or phases.  Just pile on the conditions, epi bounce and win.
---
From what I have heard, you should email support, and try to have access to as much information as possible proving that you spend the money on the account, eg. serial numbers, receipt numbers from gem purchases, etc.

if I'm not mistaken, it's less that they "use" it and more like it's biologically necessary to *exist* - that is to say, just about everything *needs* magic to exist in corporeal form (i.e. plants, humans, the air, etc.). like, aren't djinn made entirely of magic?
---
races use magic, sure, but even if they didn't throw fireballs or conjure phantasms the Elder Dragons would've tried their hardest to gobble them up regardless.
---
thus, the extinction of past races is an unfortunate yet natural consequence of magic's effect of Tyria and perhaps even the Mists, and that dynamic's relationship with the Elder Dragons. Tyria as a "realm" can't exist without magic, and it apparently can't exist with *too much* magic.
---
You can delete all your characters to transfer I did this and I **regret** it till this day. You can farm gold for 500 gems pretty easily though.
---
Zhaitan done in the current mindset that story is done in now would be a much more compelling story. I really think there could have been a lot more done to make the threat more real (A shambling army attacking a pirate port city just doesn't work for me) but everything leading up to Orr was done well enough that it never felt cheap or terrible. I still think they could have done a lot better given what they do now, but it worked well enough. The boss was just utter dissapointment.
---
There is no dragon that had a better buildup than Mordremoth, and I don't think they'll manage it again. Given how long everything about him was spread out and just how crazy it all got it really felt like we were building towards something absolutely insane. And then that clip at the end of season 2, teasing at our loss, was just masterful. I think they had things going well for them until the very end, with the reveal of chubbs mchogany and the deus ex machina of "oh we can kill him in his brain would you like me to open a portal right inside".
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
In my experience, Ranger is very optimal (or it was for me, at least) while doing map clearing. Your skill 3 while downed is insanely helpful, as it has your pet revive you. Your ability to survive is higher than any other class, imo

Skyscale gets you height, but the Griffon is what you want once you have the height. They make a great one-two punch. The Skyscale is more of a replacement for the Springer if anything.

Skyscale allows you to stay in air and you will not be attacked by some shitty flying cabbage or other bandit/zombie/wolf/crazed sylvari.

This makes Skyscale a "powerfull" mount.

If anyone is on EU and wants to have a crack at it this evening, after 5 CET,  feel free to message me in game. Akachi.1352
---
but the questions is "can someone explain how it works"
---
I only really agree with your second point. Yes this should have been "fixed" a long time ago in which you don't get anything from earning EXP when you have a locked or not enough mastery points to spent.
---
But the other ones I still think this is a player made issue.
---
I would agree with the first point if the skyscale would have been used more for the story or even on the map but any point is accessible through any other mount. It fulfills a niche application in which you don't have to have it right from the start. 
---
There is nothing in GW2 that would make you fall behind, the whole point of how GW2 is structured that you don't have this at all. Since the skyscale has, as I said above, a niche application there is also not really an incentive to have it right now other than your own need that has to be satisfied. I mean, this is like rushing to get a legendary and then not playing anymore because you burnt out.
---
I don't know, maybe it is just everyone who thinks that they have to do it in the shortest possible time instead of just taking it slow. You don't lose anything really.
---
I pay attention to story even if I'm doing it tenth time. Maybe the story is not the best and voice acting in core story is often... bad, but it is still a story. In Hot, LS3, PoF and LS4 they did great work.
---
Not really understanding hte problem. Did you buy one of the expansions. What do you mean by a starter account? A free to play account? Did you buy the game years ago before it was free to play? How long has it said 4 days for?
---
The way it works is when you upgrade the game from free to play to a paid account (by buying the expansion), you have a 4 day delay before you can use the trading post, just in case there's a charge back. Some gold sellers use stolen credit cards to buy accounts. Usually 4 days is enough to determine if an account has been legitimately attained. After those 4 days all the features you don't have unlocked should unlock.
---
oh wow, I'd love to see a response with your progress :)
---
I didn't think your use of the phrase was obnoxious or negative in any sense, I just wondered if it came from a context like WoW or Diablo where there's a certain route or tour of locations that someone can take to level a character, and it matters there because different places would be optimal for exp at different levels.
---
Don't feel constrained to do things the way I've written them up! I tried to think of this as a guide for people who are used to WoW, but because of exp scaling, you should feel free to let yourself be sidetracked by anything that catches your interest! Just set medium-term goals for yourself (e.g. map-complete core Kryta) so that you're always making progress while you level :)
---
low effort shit post.
---
I would like to hear similar breakdown about other class or place where I can read it. Cause that type of information about classes can't be found at least by me (maybe I am just bad at googling). Amazing description.  Thank you!
---
A quick Wiki search shows me that you have access to the TP, but with only limited items that are allowed for a free account. Basic items and materials seem to be available—enough for you to play the game. If there are locked sections or items, you need to purchase an expansion to activate a non Play-For-Free account.
---
Getting the home nodes for just this reason is kinda a bad decision, since each node costs 50g+ 1k VM, all this times 5 (since kralkarite is easily obtainable a whole stack in just 2-3h of gameplay) will net you at around 250g and 5k VM, which is kinda alot, and you have to geather them daily for 3mo to get a stack.
---
Better will just be to go do the hearts and geather nodes in those maps, you need the currency. Would suggest using more toons to speed it up a bit. You can get all 6 stacks this way, in just 2 casual weeks, logging in evenings for 2-3h.
---

After youre done with all of that you can farm the new map meta or some other map (silverwastes, istan).

Honestly the best place by far to learn about the different professions and their elite specializations is the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Profession#Professions). Guild Wars 2 wiki has a wealth of knowledge about literally anything in the entire game, and it should totally be bookmarked on your browser, especially if you are a new player. 
---
If you have questions about any two professions (base class) or elite specializations (level 80 sub-class), you can ask me here. You can ask me in-game (CadeRG.4508), but I’ve been very inactive lately due to connection (ping) issues I’ve been having recently.
---
I like this build a lot. I saw it somewhere on Reddit about a half year ago and they suggested Superior Sigil of Force+Severance (switched to Force+Impact after the sigil update). This is the first kitless Holo with superior sigil of air that I've seen in a long time. Is there a particular reason you chose it over impact?
---
I never paired up my GW1 account with GW2 when it was easy. After support demanded my GW1 serial to prove I owned the older account it took me a year to find the original installation media, then they said this wasn't enough and kept asking me continually for proof of purchase - which after about 10 years I don't even think I had any more. I eventually got my accounts paired by telling them how far along the story I was in GW1, which proved I knew the account.
---
Might be worth giving that a shot. If you can actually describe a relevant detail about where you are in the game progress.
---
i would REALLY love to turn off the friendly floor spam. this is what Anet should do.
---
Considering the Pact members recognized Diarmid, I wouldn't be surprised if the Mordrem Guard were supposed to be characters we knew(either from earlier story missions or LWS2), but were another part of HoT that got cut for time. 
---
I'm always going to reminisce about the HoT that could have been.
---
If you do a whole lot of gathering, yes. It's very nice not to have to worry about vendors and buying picks and swapping glyphs. If it's an occasional thing, though, and you get your gold by other means, it's not really worth it. I'd also recommend you pick up a shared inventory slot for those, since clearing the same route with multiple characters is the way to go when farming basically anything.
---
Is it true that you can constantly farm the map currency of every other LWS4 map other than Sandswept Isles? I thought all of them were timegated.

Short answer: Yes. 
---
Say good bye to ruined nodes because you accidentally used a low level tool on a high level node. Also no more running out of tool and can't equip a new stack because you're in combat. 
---
Longer answer: Yes, but do your research. 
---
No two tools are created the same. Different animations, animation speed, gathering interval, efficiency via animation cancelling and of course which glyphs are pre-installed in the tools. 
---
Personally I like Unbound Tools. I also bought an axe that came with Glyph of Industry. Consortium Sickle is another favourite. It's fast and behaves differently from Unbound Sickle. Unbound is slow but does multiple gathers simultaneously whereas Consortium Sickle is super fast but gathers one at a time. Molten Sickle is as fast as Consortium Sickle too. 
---
I have two sets of unlimited tools in my Shared Slots: Bounty set and Fast set (Industry). Bounty is for open world while Fast is for WvW, for obvious reasons, just to give an example.

The reveal was obviously their way of "adding depth" to an antagonist that was previously devoid of personality, a primal force of nature.  [https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder\_Dragon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon) 
---
What should have made Kralkatorrik come across as more sympathetic becomes undone and inexplicable if the explanation for the torment is due to their consumption of "conflicting magic" from the leylines because consuming magic is the entire raison d'etre of the elder dragons!
---
If leylines harbor the most magic, and if leylines harbor various forms of magic, and if their madness is due to consuming different forms of magic and if consuming magic is what they have to do, then becoming evil is inevitable. And if evil is inevitably what they are going to be, then the delivery of this reveal is completely contrived.
---
volatile unlimited then yes. the skinless trio ehh not so much.
---
I can't count the times I've wrote the same thing. LFG in GW2 is trash. Why? Because:
---
\- can't edit it often because it will get bugged
---
\- can't join and leave (instance switching) because it will get bugged
---
\- instances being full doesn't automatically remove squads/groups or show that they're full so I actually don't have to waste time on them
---
\- no real filtering options
---
\- can't block ppl from the LFG interface (all those raid sellers)
---
\- crap way to LFG when it comes to raids (for fractals it's fine)
---
So yeah, how hard can it be to actually create a LFG system...  And let me remind you that we're talking about an MMORPG where team play is essential almost everywhere in the game...
---
After having it for a couple of days I started using it way more often than the griffon for most everyday things. Even with small distances where you'd usually just mount a griffon I rather use skyscale because his double barrel roll propels you quite fast+ can go on higher ledges than griffon. I need to swap the mount way less often.   
---
When you have room for dive griffon is faster naturally but with mixed terrain the skyscale out-performs imo, a recent example I tried is Lornar's pass which I completed last night. I actually tried both just to see how it goes for a same path (get to a PoI then across another mountain for vista then down for a heart) and the skyscale was way faster especially for the flight to vista. Double barrel roll, bond of vigor, 1 barell roll, clinge to ledge and I was up at the vista. All took a few seconds and no mount swapping.  
---
In the end probably comes down to personal playstyle but for me the skyscale is where it's at, it's simply extremely versatile.
---
fine medium effort, cuz photoshopped
---
Cool. Sounds good! Ima grab it

you are disciplined to not click on the spoiler tagged posts. thankfully i didnt get spoiled by any of the posts as well.
---
like yourself, i have definitely enjoyed this ep too.
---
few questions come to mind after this ep.. are there even more greater threats that we really need to address??
---
is aurene the new elder dragon going to consume all magic of the eternal alchemy and become the one magic for all tyria?
---
&gt; The reveal was obviously their way of "adding depth" to an antagonist that was previously devoid of personality, a primal force of nature. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Elder_Dragon
---
Let's be honest here. The Elder Dragons was this whole "devoid of personality primal force of nature" for all of two seconds.
---
Edge of Destiny gives both Jormag and Kralkatorrik emotions and nature. It outright states the same damn thing as Kralkatorrik's Torment for his motivations (consume or destroy everything); it also outright calls Kralkatorrik cold and **calculating**.
---
In the core game, we again get personality delivered to Jormag through [this NPC](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Khrigar_Ripjaw) and a few others. Similarly throughout the personal story - and in Sea of Sorrows - we have a personality delivered to Zhaitan through his minions.
---
&gt; because consuming magic is the entire raison d'etre of the elder dragons!
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; If leylines harbor the most magic, and if leylines harbor various forms of magic, and if their madness is due to consuming different forms of magic and if consuming magic is what they have to do, then becoming evil is inevitable. And if evil is inevitably what they are going to be, then the delivery of this reveal is completely contrived.
---
Not quite. They're intention is balancing magic, but balancing *their specific domain of magic*. What happened to Kralkatorrik is what happens when they don't filter out other forms of magic (this alludes back to Season 3 and Spencer, the chak organ that filtered out death magic which didn't sit well with chak digestive tracts).
---
The Elder Dragons, at some point in the ancient, unknown, past, became too greedy and consumed magic that wasn't of their domain - most likely by not filtering out the magic from the ley lines like chak do. This caused conflict within them, causing them pain and driving them mad.
---
If they had filtered out that magic, then, they would never have conflicting magic within them, wouldn't become pained constantly, and wouldn't go insane from that pain.
---
Here I disagree because I am the kind of person who likes grinding it out if I really want something. I had 0 issues with the 250 map currency since it's my own fault I didn't have it, it's a natural timegate.   
---
But having them say "no, fuck off and come back tomorrow" is entirely on Anet.   
---
In other words the timegate pleases nobody, so why have it then?   
---
It's fine if you don't care, but both grinders and casuals didn't like it because one group couldn't do it in their own time and the other felt pressured to do it faster because of the lockouts, also not being able to do it in their own time.   
---
It's a loss for both types of players and having less options is never a good thing for stuff like this and anet is fixing it tomorrow, so obv it isn't just the players ;) I mean tbh I don't know how you can argue the artificial timegate is a player made issue. Just because they want to do it faster? Why is this any worse than wanting to do it slower? It's player choice and playstyle, the mount isn't any sort of gear or stats so there's no reason to gate it artificially since the natural timegates that are it's giant collection and currency gathering (both gold and LWS are more than adequate.   
---
If only they told us we needed the LWS currency people wouldn't complain at all and take the feeding time to gather the currencies, instead of pressing F 3 times a day and doing nothing. It would be a very natural decision and thus would save anet and the players a lot of headache.   
---
All in all glad the gating is getting nerfed so others don't have to suffer for no reason.
---
If you have cancer instabilities, this might be annoying, so just run a healer and faceroll it, if not, just do good damage and he'll die quickly, maybe tell your diviner renegade to run either mallyx or ventari for some extra support.
---
Speaking of the spearmarshals plea, is there a way to get it back?
---
It's basically the Aurora of the mount roster.  
---
If it WAS like Aurora than I fully expect that shit to actually be LEGENDARY. But it isn't in the slightest ofc because mounts can't work like that, goes against the entire spirit of GW2 mounts, that's the whole problem.   
---
It ain't no better than the griff so dumb move to make it a way worse acquisition.
---
I'm hoping those guys will look up the guide on how to do it, if they don't yikes. They'll be in for an unpleasant surprise.   
---
They can then take the feeding timegate time to do hearts and stuff with without having to rely on meta.
---
Every ingame minute spent to acquire any mount is an ingame minute spent well ;) as many stated before, skyscale does not invalidate griffon because its a lot slower.. if anything, its an upgrade over springer, but even the springer can be faster on certain terrain, whereas the skyscale is abit more confortable..
---
No idea tbh, I learned the hard way before to keep teleporting items so I had it stored on a parked alt. Try going back there and talking to the spearmarshal again
---
Indeed, you are right. Seems kinda wasteful that they steped back on delivering more JPs that can be farmed daily, with even greater ease. Got a few stacks of LWS3 currencies, even tho I have no solid use of them atm ^^
---
&gt;I would call the Griffon the Rollerbeetle of the sky
---
This really ye. Wouldn't be the case because of his double jump but now that the skyscale is in town I can comfortably say it really do be like that for me now.
---
The reasons to start with LS4 instead 2 or 3:
---
* They have completed HoT and PoF already. They know about Balthazar and how LS3 would end.
---
* Unlocking the roller beetle and Skyscale mounts is going to make some LS2 and LS3 maps much more enjoyable.
---
* There's currently a huge surplus of players in all LS4 maps and it'll last a while since some people can only start working on their Skyscale late.
---
The reasons to do them chronologically:
---
* Story continuity (LS2-&gt;HoT-&gt;LS3-&gt;PoF-&gt;LS4)
---
&gt; Since their approach has shifted into the living world producing "expansion-like" content
---
That was pre-layoffs. I would'nt be surprised with the refocus back on GW2 that they in production of another expansion.
---
Arachnia wasn’t a god of the underworld. None of the non-canon lore suggests it was, and none of the canon lore has suggested it existed at all. From what I remember Arachnia and the other insectoid gods where going to be gods that abaddon had hunted down and killed - hence why the domain of torment has a giant gross spider and wired insect carcasses making up its land masses. If anything Arachnia was more likely to be a god of the realm of torment.
---
Is there an invisible wall over those mountain ridge? I'm asking because you did that climb there just before you reached it.
---
you can run the game in [32 bit mode](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments#-32) maybe that helps.
---
Yes, and it goes pretty high over the ridge.
---
Yes, I had that issue for the longest time myself, but I then found [Ninja Ripper](https://gamebanana.com/tools/5638), which works with Gw2 (also 64bit). If I remember correctly, it comes with a 3DS Max plugin to import the extracted models there, but I (somehow) used blender and tried to add a skeleton rig to it, so the result was [this](https://imgur.com/AFeZzqX)
---
Not quite. It treaded very similar ground to one of the other paths, so when they had the chance  to add aetherblade path they chose to replace o e of the other paths rather then adding a fourth
---
Do you have season 3? In the first episode you get something that lets you collect unbound magic, if you don’t own episode one you have to buy the ability from a merchant on one of the season 3 maps.
---
If fractal groups want a healer, Healbrand is probably the most commonly requested one.  Healbrand uses the same armor/trinkets as heal Renegade, so you can share between them when you et bored.

That's strange. There is a story requirement to gathering unbound magic, described here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Unbound_Magic#Acquisition
---
well i dont even know what season 3 is? i dont have hearth of thorns, im new to the game. i bought the unlimited gatherer sale that lets me farm unbound magic. it gave me the 3 tools + unbound magic gatherer. im able to gather the unbound magic but my wallter doesnt have the currency.
---
To be honest, Guild Wars is more of a solo experience, than classic, 'social' MMO. Ofc guilds and friends play very important role (or rather CAN play - if you want them to), but are not mandatory to completing 90% of the game content.    
---
All the story missions, living world episodes, exploration, most of the achievements - everything can be done solo and can be extremely satisfying.    
---
I have spent almost 3500 hours in this game - and I am solo player all the way. I played dungeons with random people from LFG, I play t4s with randoms as well. You can even clear raids with pugs from lfg if you know what to do (and other people know what to do).  
---
PVP and WVW follows the same pattern.    
---
This game is build that way - with LFG menu, construction of open world events and story instances. You can play solo all the way and only sometimes 'use' random people from LFG to help each other to complete any problematic segment of content.
---
well i purchase the unbound magic unlimited gathering tools. thats why im able to gather them through the tools. but do i need the hearth of thorn expansion to actually get them on my wallet?
---
That screenshot resolution though
---
That's a general mount bug not exclusive to the Skyscale. It's been around since mounts have been a thing.
---
If you don’t own HoT or season 3 unbound magic has no uses. It is likely hiding it until you get the ability to collect or destroying it.
---
I guess you need hot or Living Story3 unlocked, because you can spend the currency only in hot or LS3 maps.
---
I'm, not sure if LS3 without hot works.
---
&gt;Save
---
how do i get LS3?
---
i have the ability to collect it. it just doesnt have the cuirrency in my wallet.  [https://snag.gy/XpNErZ.jpg](https://snag.gy/XpNErZ.jpg) 
---
How do i get LS3?
---
I wouldn't, had they not reaffirmed those notions and facts with Descent and last week's Guild Chat.
---
After all, Edge of Destiny says Kralkatorrik had emerald-colored eyes, and emerald-colored blood.
---
Question is why it even does work that way - the Skyscale regenerates endurance with three different rates. Slowest when stationary while airborne, faster when on the move while airborne, and the fastest when mounting up until pressing spacebar for the first time. I sure would like to know the reasons behind that. Seems oddly specific to just be a bug - being able to carry the fastest endurance regeneration into flight is a bug in itself.
---
some are supposed to be this slow. my advise is to do something else like achievements
---
Eh, this series didn't really get good until the third book: *The Wall's Down: Strike now while it's Stunned*
---
I expect Elonians to incorporate them on their jewellery crafting, also other glass items. They will become an empire of luxurious glass for years to come.
---
Of course it's safe to use. Just don't drink from it, or stay near for too long.
---
It is a once per account progression thing and just playing the game almost whichever way you want nets you progress. It is not meant to be grinded out by players, rather as a thing that comes by as you play.
---
You can certainly speed up the process by using various XP boosters (there's a page on the wiki explaining the details), but there's absolutely no need to rush it.
---
how much VM will it take to get back the gold in term of 2700gems ?
---
Wat
---
It does take a while, but if you have access to season 3 or 4 maps based on the mastery you working on PoF or HoT the main vendor do sell permanent exp boost. That you can buy three time and they stack and it’s for your account wide.
---
But in general, doing event, meta events, bounties in the area you need and you will have full bar so fast.
---
dungeons have been replaced with fractals in end game. secondly it's best to make a group in LFG with your intentions rather then just blindly join one and if you get downed in a dungeon you can use the waypoint to respawn if you're allies are out of combat
---
make your own lfg with adding that you're watching the cutsceens
---
on EU it happend some of these lfg pop on a regular basis. otherwise, play with firends/guildmates.
---
Generally speaking, dungeons are a very small part of the game's content. They are in abandoned state because the devs like their next iteration of 5-man instance content better (those are the fractals).
---
That doesn't mean that dungeons have to be played that way ! They are often ran by experienced player that only want to get through it as fast as possible for rewards. Some of them won't want low level characters, some of them won't care to teach beginners.
---
Your best bet to enjoy dungeons, especially story dungeons, is to create your own party in the LFG tool specifying that you are playing it for the first and want to watch cutscenes.
---
This way you should lure in players in the same situation as you or veterans that feel like lending a hand and will actually let you watch and try to help you. Ofc grievers may happen but you should be fine more often than not !
---
To be honest, Guild Wars 2 doesn't have a distinction between tanks/healers/dps. Sure you can build your character around one of those specs but it's not something strongly needed (at least not until high level fractals where guardian healer is a blessing). This is just my opinion to be fair.
---
As for people rushing - I would suggest creating your own group on LFG with the description  that you want to do story mode WITHOUT skipping. There is high chance that you will find a lot of people with the same need as you, or veterans who will want to help you.
---
Alternatively you can always join a guild and ask them to run story mode without skipping with you :)
---
Well, there is a sun's refuge portal scrol from an achievment... can be added to the s4 tome, but then it is 6 vs 7 entries!
---
this is correct, did it a few weeks ago (RiP my old Ele)
---
Now that I think about it... basically we kill the Claw by making it feel like it hits his pinky toe against a furniture multiple times...?
---
FWIW you keep your wallet &amp; bank contents even if you delete all characters

Dungeons exist for over 6 years now in this game and are somewhat deprecated content. That doesnt mean people are running it but most(!) people are kinda used to it by now and just want to get it done with for profit reasons.
---
Those people wont know if you are new or just an alt account by just your Achievement Points. If they dont know whats up, they'll just proceed with their general dungeon run and thats it for them. Mostly they dont mean harm, they just have different expectations. Common communication error. Dont worry too much about it
---
From here on you have two options:
---
1. Go to the LFG tool and start your own group with this text "Dungeon Story, watching cutscenes". Its a sureshot way to tell others that you didnt watch the cutscenes yet. People who will join will accept it.
---
2. If you join a group which doesnt state speedrun or level 80 or so, you can write in the chat "Hey do you guys mind if I watch the cutscenes? First time here" 
---
Also dont be afraid to say you didnt do Thing X before or you dont know where to run to. Like said, after almost 7 years, people have some expectations with dungeons. But after knowing you are new, most of them are rather helpful.
---
tl;dr using chat or lfg tool helps your experience
---
I played GW2 at release but not since then. Some friends are planning to start playing again and ask me to join them. Since it's been a very long time, I have a few questions :)
---
I remember being very disappointed by the lack of trinity / support class. I tried with the guardian and elem (both max lvl at the time) but with no success ...
---
Is this still the case? I also heard of a druid class (requiring a DLC ?) : does it feel like a support ?
---
If support is not an option, what class would you recommend ? Ideally something not to squishy and not to technical to play. 
---
The DLC ... are they mandatory ? Appart from new classes, what do they bring ? Increase level cap or something ? New content ?
---
Anything you'd like to share with a returning player ?
---
Thank you !
---
XP booster and/or killstreak booster, if you have one free. Celebration/birthday booster. Food and utility item with 10-15% xp boost. Fireworks xp buff, if any. Guild banner xp buff and guild hall xp buff, if you have access.
---
With all this stacked, run around and kill mobs in out of the way places (yellow mobs too) and hope for high experience bonuses from mobs that haven’t been killed in a while. 
---
Change places if they aren’t giving high bonuses - e.g. avoid hearts, and commonly traversed routes. Go for the filler mobs on cliffs, away from POIs, in tunnels/caves, etc.
---
Some context would be nice...
---
starting early development now for post S5 would make sense timeline wise
---
S5 goes for max 2 years, then some downtime, then expac 3 ~2-2.5 years from now
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bsn9xf/summary_guild_chat_skyscale/
---
The community in-game has been pretty good about this.  Even my guildmates have reserved discussion for Discord.
---
It was shown on the Skyscale Guild Chat, they also showed some alternative horn concepts for the skyscale. A summary can be found here:
---
Lol, what page??
---
Almost everytging is doneable solo, or with random groups from LFG system. Only for Raids and high rating PvP Tournament you should find a stable group. Ive played for 2,2k hours straight solo. Mostly pvp, open world pve, story and fractals.
---
will try that, I thought joining parties that said "story mode" would be enough, but apparently not :(
---
will try to explicitly tell them that I want to watch the cur scenes.
---
The best way for you to do dungeons is to make your own group in the lfg-tool. You go to the ascalonian catacomb tab and then add your group in to it. There is a part were you write a message and yours should look something like that. Story mode, watch ALL cut scene, chill run all welcome. (or anything else you want to add too)
---
The reason for this is that the dungeons been here for 7 years and most of us have watched those scene and at this point they feel like it is just a time eater waiting for people to watch them. It does not mean that you should not watch them, you are new but there is no way people can know this until you say so. There for making your own group will make that much easier.
---
Being kicked from a group is very likely that you joined a group without readin their message. The lfg-tool is made by players and each group decide what they want their group to be. Some want only lvl 80 players and make a speed run. This must be as ok as it is for you to wanting to have a group chilling and wacthing stuff.
---
Inside of a dungeon if you die you wait for them to kill the boss or the mobs and then you can respawn and run back. This is what most expect and they probably got a bit annoyed that you didn't. Ressing you through out a fight might very well have them killed as well since there are no tanks or healers just each person taking care of their health and sharing the buffs you can. Mostly you ress downed players, fully dead and you wait until boss is deand and they are out of combat and you can wp and come back.
---
How ever again, if you are new you do not win anything by not telling that. If you say nothing people will assume that you know what you are doing. People have a lot of alts due to how easy that is, so running in to low level players does not mean they are new, you just voice that. And also tell them hey i am new and not sure where to go and they will ping in the chat were the closest wp are to them. 
---
As for dungeons over all this is abandoned content and something you do eveyr now and then for some event, for gifts to legendary weapons, farming skins and so on. The real dungeons are fractals in which you make at lvl 80. So use the dungeons to learn how to play in a group and how to use combo fields and movements and so on.
---
There's a lot of elite specs (expansions required) that can be played as supports/healers in end game, core gw2 just lacked more challenging content so those heals were wasted in semi decent groups.
---
Expansions bring new story, maps, raids, masteries (something like secondary level scale,  mostly tied to traveling features like gliding and mounts, but include more options as well), legendary weapons. Expansions make core game look like a trial.
---
I'd suggest reading some guides for new/returning players on the sidebar of this sub.
---
Selbbub obviously
---
Train all weapons in the beast! Bring it down!
---
&gt; (at least not until high level fractals where guardian healer is a blessing)
---
guardian is a healer too?
---
I made a Ranger because I heard he is the "main healer" later on with his druid specialization.
---
Which on of both is more of a "main healer"?
---
If you do not own Heart of Thorns you can not play the season 3 anyway so yes you need to have HoT first.
---
Tried that top on my Norncromancer for a minute and the chest skin tone not matching the rest of her prompted me to try something else.
---
Time for a second female norn, then. :3
---
42 preferably
---
A 90-minute VoD? Who even has time for that?
---
If my calculation is right about 1.6 million.
---
Why can't you play through season 1 anymore? Did I miss out on story by not playing when it was current?
---
Not at all, power Sb with GS deletes shit fast, but no pet your merged with it.   
---
Since druid is healing spec SB is the only dps option and you don't have a pet out for it.
---
I build legendaries to make quite a lot of gold.
---
Needs some capital and a lot of time tho
---
Thank you.
---
Can you tell me what you want exactly?
---
That's great to know, thanks!
---
Rightfully so
---
On those they rotate in the gem store right?   
---
Also how do they work now exactly? Do you get runes that give you volatile magic much like the faster gathering or other buffs?   
---
I bought the basic-looking ones because I prefer the no-frills solution and I'm wondering if I can make my non-flashy tools get me the volatile magic.
---
1) Look for a guild   
---
2) Be nice at guildmate and state you are beginner  
---
(#Optional# Pretend you are a girl (voice changer?) so they will be more suitable to you)  
---
3) Find a guildmate who always says he already did everything, the guy who is better than everyone and the most experienced of all, the one for who lore is all his life, this guy love to help people who /Clap him for his virtual bravery.  
---
4) Show him a blind respect and ask him for more cool story about his gw2 life.  
---
5) When he is fluffing his skins and rare things at Lion's Arch ask him to show you the story mode ! (the trick in there)  
---
Warning : It's important that you ask in /guild so everyone can see, better effect if you are on discord.   
---
6) Now the trap is done, he cant refuse !   
---
7) Any other content to do ? Repeat 4)
---
It is not how dungeons play in this game but how the players do after 6 yrs.
---
Open up your own group and write it in the title, but you might wait pretty long...
---
rare unid. gear has nearly the same price as one ecto atm. so it doesnt really matter if you sell or open it.
---
Dungeon LFG is a crapshoot.  I had *really bad* experiences using the dungeon LFG so I shelved the content as a chip on my shoulder until I encountered a player recruiting for a guild that specialized in dungeon content.  I recommend doing the same - a guild will (or *should*) *teach* you the content.  Fractals handle somewhat similarly and raids build on elements of both, so it's good experience to get... you'll just need to do a bit of guild-related legwork to get an optimal experience.
---
You'll be told dungeons are "dead content" a lot, both in game and out.  This neglects the fact that several dungeon currencies are required for specific class builds, and several are required for the construction of Legendaries.  Players tend to form static groups and run dungeon content in groups of 3 to 5 without using LFG - I've rotated through *every* dungeon this way, as recently as a couple of months ago.  So dungeons aren't updated (they're "dead" in that sense; Fractals are their replacement), and the players that run them the most are privately organized and don't use LFG, so that can give the impression that "nobody runs dungeons."  And yet every time the static I ran content including Aetherpath and Arah with decided to LFG to give a random player some easy currency, the slot filled in less than a minute.
---
In my opinion it's better to sell them.
---
And if they don't give, there'll be a riot. :D
---
New specs is what keeps many players like me excited for future content.
---
There is no real progression in other games with a gear tread mill it is only shuffling of numbers. What really happens is that the new gear have more stats and the bosses have more hp and/or toughness, you are still the same, nothing have changed.
---
Probably Mordremoth just due to sheer amount of build-up and I felt that the HoT campaign started off on a very strong note but ended a bit weaker than it started. 
---
Maguuma really did feel like you were in enemy territory, much like stepping into Orr. Verdant Brink really does show off how devastating the attack on the fleet was. 
---
I thought Mordremoth's story boss fight was a bit lame. Mechanically pretty alright but visually not a fan. Not big into the whole "Attack his mind" while it makes sense, it's a bit too abstract for me personally. 
---
Dragon's Stand as a meta perfectly supplements it though, and that is easily the best portrayed Elder Dragon battle in my opinion. 
---
Zhaitan's build up was also extremely good. Best visual design. Orr felt appropriately difficult, albeit a bit too annoying as well. Zhaitan's battle was just too big of a disappointment. It was extremely deflating to just press X and he's dead. Everything prior to that moment was also pretty damn good. I like Zhaitan as a force of nature kind of thing as well. 
---
Kralkatorrik felt most intimidating in his actual splendor. I loved how he was protrayed in S4E5. Not a big fan of episode 6, but the whole deal regarding flying through the mists with Kralk ahead was truly awesome. 
---
Episode 6 felt a bit too rushed for me personally. I played through LS4 in one go, so having Aurene die at the end of episode 5 and *immediately* ress up in Ep 6 and *immediately* fly into the mists to catch up to Kralk, was not very well paced.
---
huge nostalgia hit. How on earth did you come up with using Spore for that? I loved that game!
---
chest circles
---
&gt; like remove pet 
---
I mean... that's literally Soulbeast's gimmick
---
To know what this image is about, what the problem is with it, and why it's suddenly possible to be in game.
---
But don't worry, others have given an actual answer by now.
---
just got my achievement \~  
---
here some tips/bugs to do that more easy and safe\~
---
begin part:
---
* stay far away to that 3 Ley-line 
---
* (Suggest) stay on RIGHT side of enter spot those big stone and slowly RANGE DPS finish it
---
* if u not close to Aurene u MUST not get trap
---
second part:
---
* stay far away to Kralkatorrik at the end of the platform
---
* **\*\*\*\*blind and use your Special Action(Dragonsblood Spear from 1500 range)\*\*\*\***  
---
that super easy to kill small one with 1-2 hit only,specially at miniboss walkway
---
* at mini boss walkway
---
1. make sure u always stay at "second small branded area" (u kill it before)
---
2. use Special Action to attack mini boss from 1500 range
---
3. mini boss will keep run back to their spawn when they come too far to u *~~(bug warning)~~*
---
4. if u dead ,don't respawn .Aurene will rez u and that not influence your achievement\~
---
5. it is slow but it is the safe way to do it \~
---
let me know if this work for u =)
---
Do people still AFK in Lion's Arch? I thought everyone was either in Mistlock, DR or the Grove??
---
You could have just kept this to yourself, you sadist.
---
RIBA, silverwastes - istan when its up
---
You are GW2 sub summarized.
---
Unlimited tools are primarily a means of convenience. If you're looking at it in terms of gold:gems it's almost never going to be worth it as you need years of use before they break even 
---
If you have a permanent port to somewhere where you can pop in and out to buy new tools if you run out or you're vigilant on keeping yourself stocked up then none of them are ever going to be worth the cost in terms of gold.
---
But if you've ever walked up to a cluster of trees and run out of axes on your very first swing and your whole flow was ruined, well unlimited tools can fix that.
---
But you do have a tank, support, healer, dps in Raids and in T4 fractals. In PvP there are also different roles and plays like any point capture PvP mmo tho. High End PvE &amp; PvP content isn’t really all that different from FFXIV or WOW. They are actually very similar in the bigger pictures, even mechanic wise they have a lot of overlap.
---
Do your 2g of dailies every day, hoard up every little material you come across and don’t spend gold on anything except the jackal. Use gw2efficiency to help you craft your first set of ascended armor, find a meta build on metabattle.com or snowcrows.com (second one there is more reliable) and copy that build trait for trait and gear for gear, don’t get innovative quite yet. Once you’ve done that, you can start looking into higher tier fractals and raids
---
&gt;reducing the Steal range by 600 in trade for ~~an "unblockable"~~  more endurance and different dodge mechanics
---
Personally, I'm not expecting to hear much news until the 7th Anniversary. That seems like the perfect time to announce or release the start of S5 and establish the new direction of the story. I'd hope they've started working on or towards an expansion for post-S5, but it doesn't seem wise to announce something like that so far out. And while S5 may be a bit of a shakeup for the story, I am doubtful that would be worth an E3 announcement of any kind beyond mentioning it is coming around the Aniv.
---
There's no guesswork involved. It always lands just in front of you. The problem is gauging the distance accurately without a marker.
---
Tanks and healers are not needed except for Tier 4 Fractals and Raids. And even then not necessarily on all encounters.
---
Make your own group for dungeons and mention that you're watching cutscenes in the LFG. Mention that you're new to dungeons (or doing a dungeon for the first time) as well, that way you'll get either other people that are new or experienced people that are patient and willing to help out.
---
My main is Necro
---
Necro with minion for levelling is amazing
---
At 80, reaper + minion on solo, with group you can run scourge with condi viper build or support
---
Yesterdat i try for the first time warrior (i like ranged classes) dual axe, and is a beast levelling 😮
---
You notice I was talking bout the steal change? Not about a Spec that was introduced with HoT? 
---
There was no reason to nerf Steal for Daredevil.
---
Nobody needs Core spec that keep up with elite specs. They are supossed to be ELITE, not core.
---
Well actually Berserker spec now became more powerful if you’re good and it added diversity to the playstyle since now both condi and power setup have pretty good dps builds and you’re not locked into just being a BS anymore.
---
Yeah perhaps, but I see it as a reward for investing time into the game and the mastery system. Why not allow players who got the mastery and mount necessary to be retroactively rewarded by having a faster way to reach an old location. Kinda like learning mushroom bouncing in HoT, gets up to places quicker and saves times. 
---
Though yeah it's probably not intended, but that's just my view on it.
---
Anyone who plays PvP regularly is no stranger to reward tracks and can get the gift of battles and obsidian shards super easily... WvW off hours roaming is a cake walking body farm for pvp’er (and stupid fun too)
---
It takes around 2 minutes to do this. Anyone who's gotten gold on any griffon time trial can do this first or second time (maybe). Waiting for the events work too. I'm just showing another option.
---
&gt;k did not seem evil at all when his Torment wasn't speaking. The way he spoke about and to us was not exactly "respectful", which just confirms he never really cared about "lesser races" if not as tools to be made into minions, thing that was proven wrong to him when Aurene showed him that she was stronger because of us, as he recognizes as well.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;I wrote more about this perspective in other posts of the thread, if you care.
---
the general answer to "i'm not afraid" doesn't convince me too, just say "i'm super cool I'm never afraid" sounds lame
---
I'm not sure if I'll welcome the water dragon being introduced. Water combat really sucks for some reason, I don't even bother to equip my alts with underwater gear now that I've stopped playing fractals. If it comes I hope a water combat overhaul comes with it.
---
I'm betting this skin is revealed tommorow with the patch
---
Yeah. It seems a missed opportunity not to. 
---
And if I’m allowing wishful thinking, maybe day/night could get different footsteps, particles, etc. :P
---
Yikes. Way too overdesigned and busy. I'm glad they didn't go with it.
---
So instead of 27 playable classes you prefer having only 18. Sounds pretty bad to me, I personally love having more options.
---
Advanced technology implants

Book of Awakening to Light just opens up the collections to get [The Funerary armor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Funerary_armor). Fun and worthwhile is subjective. Do you like any of the armor pieces? Do you like doing random events and gathering collectables to get pieces of gear? Take a look at the collections for each piece of armor and see if it's something that you would find fun. If it is, go for it! If you don't care for any of the armor it offers, you can skip it :)
---
I just wanna point out that people don't need to do the LWS story arcs, just have the maps (xcept for the one where you need to unlock sun's refuge).
---
wiki is your friend
---
If you're looking for Elisa - check on wiki. You can also double-click on Ley Line Infused Sand to get an information if she is or not in current map. Other items required for collections are sold by Volatile Magic Collectors.
---
After finishing the collection - return to Gorrik, he will be waiting in Jahai (not in Sun's Refuge). You will see a small icon with crown on you mini-map.
---
Is there anything you can buy with unbound magic that you can actually turn into profit directly?
---
Same here. Some things. which I can't skip, I sit throught, or go to the toilet and read it later.  
---
until HoT the story was nice, but I have to agree that since than, it became more "family friendly" and, yeah, generic. But! Sometimes the story has some nice highs, like the last one, but the lame finale kinda destroyed it for me :/
---
Congrats. Simple amazing!
---
If that's the case I need the name of her surgeon

TacO stands for "Tactial Overlay" and it's a program that puts markers and routes on top of Guild Wars. ANet advertises TacO things on their twitter and talk about it openly, so it's something that's legit to use. 
---
http://www.gw2taco.com/ - is the website for TacO. 
---
http://tekkitsworkshop.net/index.php/gw2-taco/download - is a very popular content creator for marker packs. 
---
You download and install a marker pack (super easy to do!) for the map of your choice, eg, Sandswept isles. And you get this yellow+blue route to follow from the first Waypoint. You just zoom around, gather when you come across stuff, and when you reach the end of the route it will either tell you where to WP next, or that you're finished. It cuts down the amount of time you aimlessly run around a map looking for nodes. You can offer to be a tour guide for friends / people on the map which can be kinda fun if you're into that sort of thing :)
---
ohhh... what a pleasure to watch...
---
@Anet: gimme the ring + another ring + amulet + 2nd accesory thanks bye
---
Magic Warped Bundles
---
No because copyright, why is this even a question?   
---
Probably not even blizzard could afford to pay the rights to something like that
---
Which is also the case with every other mount.
---
&gt;  It's like saying the branded raptor should have been the original and not the one we have.
---
Except it doesn't.
---
"Here's a common native animal we've been riding in this region since forever, before Kralk came here and branded some of them." =/= "Here's a completely new creature who formed moments ago because two crystalline-themed magical entities tore through the fabric of space and time."

Does your character also match a yellow cutesy fluffy fatty Springer? I doubt it, yet it's different so that it presents a unique theme, and if you don't want it that way, you can buy the goat skin, the jackalope skin, the lizard skin etc.
---
I'd love to discuss the matter with you since I have a very different opinion and I play many core and elite classes mayself but your aggressive tone and your downvoting kinda makes me want just leave this be. Have a nice day, friend.
---
I can understand those people - when I want to get story mode done on another Character to unlock explorable mode, I would'nt want to watch the cutscenes aswell.
---
Sure, they could've stated they wanna rush through though.
---
Power berserker is less than 1k behind condi warrior in the hands of a good one.
---
AUrene shares a skeleton with the griffon. The fact remains that they are all quadripedal winged creatures. NOT reusing the skeleton would be a huge waste of resources.
---
i still think a giraffe mount would be good, just imagine those long legs darting about the place :) :)  
---
(just a joke) ,buuuut.  
---
towering Indrik mount? ;D  
---
Indrik city sieges in WvW? that'll be the day
---
Second this. Mesmer was really weak compare to my other characters, then after getting Hybrid Chrono...oh boy what a difference.
---
Upvoted everything in this thread. Hope anyone from Anet would notice your topic. I did create a similar one quite recently (... [Eternity](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bpq91u/why_we_cannot_use_only_a_half_of_the_eternity_as/) ...) tho it was not noticed and not given any response.
---
They aren't made from crystal or brand, that has nothing to do with them. If that was the case they'd be literal offspring from Aurene and Kralk. Like what?
---
 Not to mention emphasis on the word BUY which a lot of people don't like and won't. Thus the original should be lore and looks-friendly to the general populace and whoever wants it to be more fancy or themed has the option to buy it. 
---
How do you not see the point of this? Are you upset you'd have to buy it as a skin or something? Cuz I'd be upset if I had to buy the original as a skin if it was crystal for no reason at all.
---
Um, actually if you are running a strange team composition you can pretty much fail any fractal. Try to understand mechanics and all will be good. (Note: Sirens reef with bad fractal instabilities is sometimes very tough but not impossible)
---
It's by far the worst 5 men content
---
Part of the "problem" is that it's more-or-less impossible to NOT have elite specs be power creep. Core specialisations will generally have to cover defense, power damage, condi damage, support, and personal sustain, making them very generalised. Elite specialisations focus on one or two of those specific roles which inherently makes them an improvement at those roles.
---
Hell yeah! Can't stop won't stop. Goating is the best endgame content of GW2
---
If you happen to find the recordings send me a message, would be curious to know if we did it the same way and got to the same places ^^
---
Ah okay. Thank you for clarifying that, had no idea aetherblade was a rewrite over it.
---
You had a much better chance of getting a positive reaction from devs before you said:
---
&gt; maybe day/night could get different footsteps, particles, etc.
---
That immediately moves the entire discussion into doubling the work involved for footsteps and particles, and then leads to the question of why there aren't different footsteps on every legendary. 
---
With your first suggestion, all they really need to do is unlock the day and night skins individually in addition to the current skin that automatically switches. That's a pretty simple change, so don't bury it under an additional suggestion that would be a ton of work.
---
Omg the bees part sounds amazing. Why on earth would they remove that? Sounds like a true meme.
---
Where can I find wyvern to kill apart from verdank brink? Trying to get the treats for skyscale.
---
I like the view of this fractal overall, interesting area, but I have to admit, I skip this one cause it's more about being too long, than being difficult.
---
 Skele, maze, triple event boat, before the last champ. Meh.
---
&gt;It's also a species with a long, season-wide collection that still shares the skeleton with griffon.  
---
where is the problem with this? you know what a rig is right? something that nearly all humanoid characters already share since ages for example, just modified in terms of scaling.
---
Good god this is probably the best spore creation I have ever seen haha. Nice work!
---
I think this will be a thing as soon as we get (under)water-mounts.
---
Siren's Reef is probably meant as a condition fight for classes like Scourge, Mirage, Firebrand &amp; Renegade to excel.  The problem is that the current Fractal meta is glassier than ever and is generally ill-equipped to deal enough cleave to keep adds manageable.  It's pretty safe to say that it's pretty much a flop with the "average" T4 player and pugging it is **not** fun in the slightest.  
---
It wouldn't be so bad, but being unable to counter-play the gusts with stability and having to deal with afflicted, we bleed fire and social awkwardness makes this Fractal feel really messy and frustrating.  The meta tends to be based on single target boss DPS with minimal cleave which works great for 99/100cm and is solid for when GS5 or temporal curtain can pull in mobs for cleave.  
---
I'd love to see a group speed-run the boss itself and just torch her down with burning, confusion and torment.  I get the feeling that she would melt pretty quickly, and I think it'd be fun to see conditions destroying everything in sight.   None the less, Siren's Reef is a divisive Fractal.  It's manageable, but it can't be stripped down to a high-octane break &amp; burn festival.  I respect ArenaNet for trying to deviate from the "norm" but they've played into it a little too much to make Fractals that are *this* different. 
---
Again, it's not that you can't pug it.  It's just that it's a fight that spirals out of control and becomes very messy very quick.  It's never particularly fun seeing that your Fractal pugs decided that today was the day to break out the single-target DPS classes.  So everything has boons, everybody has conditions/debuffs like chill and then you've got instabilities like We Bleed Fire making everything *terrible*.
---
Skimmer Ranch Waypoint — [&amp;BGcKAAA=] — South, on the various cliffs. [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Skyscale_Treats)
---
That's way more than just 500 gems for transfer lol
---
Yeah no one would rush through the earliest content in any other game? 
---
You're doing the oldest content in the game that people have done literally hundreds of times. If you don't want to run with an organized group, why not create your own LFG with watching cut scenes, or join a casual guild with people who wouldn't mind watching cut scenes.
---
Harder core players are always going to prioritize gold for hour but not all players are hard core. You have a data set of two runs and you're drawing conclusions. But I'm in a casual guild and I almost never pug dungeons and I've never had a run where people just leave people behind, maybe because we're all guildies.
---
LFG is a random community and you're going to get random people. But you can make your own group with whatever requirements you want.  Obviously everyone else is going to want the kind of experience they want.
---
All the runs I do are more casual, because I'm not a hard core player.
---
There's a wyvern nest in Dragon's Stand.
---
Current good way is farming the last map meta.   
---
Sell all the stuff you get then buy with gold and volatile magic leather bags and sell those. Do this and your daily and you should be good in a week's time
---
You're better off contacting the creating of the tool, /u/megai2. Their discord is [here](https://discord.gg/zqeHCEg).
---
&gt; what are you on about
---
The person above thinks that everyone and their mother want shiny base version for this mount. In reality some people sincerely want to have the neutral version as a base. An if that person thinks that the simple solution is to add the "plain" skin as a gemshop skin... then we will still have a lot of annoyed players thinking that this plain skin isn't worth 2k gems. And these players may not be interested in neutral skins as a whole, they just like to complain about anything and everything.
---
Dat crystalline wings + purple branded raptor look my go to for all my chars
---
gz, I'm almost done myself, just missing 1 fractal page (somebody wanna carry my ass through 100cm btw?) for ad infinitum and aurora
---
I'd love a slimmer skin, kinda like they did it with the raptor in the recent adoption license
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Primordial_Raptor
---
Oh, so that's why so many people were there during that time slot while I was working on the final Chunka and Champawat collection. You managed to get me in that screenshot, just to the right of the three apple tags near the top.
---
&gt; the rig has nothing to do with the topic.
---
Making both aerial mounts similar 4-legged, 2-wing beasts is the issue. If it was using some skimmer or spider rig or whatever, the second aerial mount would've been different, yet they went the easy way and it shows.
---
When you bought the package you should have gotten the ability to gather it. I dont know if it autoconsumes the item or do you have to activate it yourself. Check your inv just in case.
---
it would not have been different, because those rigs also exist already. everything else still has to be made.
---
You can reach the endgame on a free account. Try it.
---
It was great
---
You can get to the end game with the free to play version and still enjoy dungeons, fractals, exploration, etc... some of it will be locked to the expansions though, like the living world stories and the new maps and stuff. You also won’t be able to raid.
---
The skyscale is my new default mount. Makes springer obsolete in most situations and regarding flying speed, while it can't be compared with griffon it can be considered the raptor of the air since it behaves the same (mount ability 2 on skyscale behaves like the raptor leap but on air).
---
Something that makes it look more like a dragon and less like a jackal.
---
Map border limit.
---
i try, many people downvote me daily. :(
---
Interesting. Do I sell the unidentified gear to TP or salvage them?
---
Looks like what animal thing if I may ask because we've had NO dragons apart from elder dragon offspring and wyverns? 
---
And as stated before, they have nothing to do with crystal dragons or the brand.
---
But you won't need to wonder what maps are currently busy, or if you're hunting a specific achiev and that map has a (1) next to it you'd check, rather than clicking through every lfg map the way it is now. I think it's a good idea!
---
&gt; I had the exploration star in gw2 without any extension. I assume that to have it again I must clean every new area, right ?
---
Nope! The star next to your name is just for Core stuff. There's maps to clear in HoT and PoF but they don't affect your star from core Tyria, and there isn't a new one to gain for the expacs either. 
---
&gt; Speaking about the exploration star, is there an easy way to track the progress of the task ? Is the star shown on the screen when achieve ?
---
Not really, no. I know a lot of people track their mapping progress with a spreadsheet. There's no API backend for map completion so companion-apps/websites can't track this. You can't see your own map completion star either, only other people see it. 
---
&gt; Are the masteries capped to a maximum number ? If yes, is it still possible for me to reach it given the fact that I own the two extensions but miss a lot of open world seasons ?
---
Current max mastery rank is 295. This goes up with new LS chapters. A chunk of those points comes from Living Story 3 and 4 content. (38 from LS4, 24 from LS3). Most of those masteries are tied to the content within the LS chapters but there's a few exceptions like "Counter magic" you'll encounter things in the core maps that need this mastery or you'll blow up pretty fast. You can always get the LS chapters for gold -&gt; gem once you're back into full swing with the game and can put away some gold for these if you don't feel like dropping more cash :)
---
By that brain dead logic every videogame in history is pay to win because you have to buy the system needed to play it. Even more so for computers where your performance is based on the power and therefore price of your system.
---
Pay to win as a term was created to describe micro transaction payment models and their effect on the health of the game. Including game expansion packs into that is reaching real hard for the sake of supporting your argument, not something a reasonable individual would believe.
---
I have 8 characters max level but always thought node farms to be very dull and not profitable at all, specially iron.
---
So why are you trying to make the gemshop as this Big Evil that stands in the way of everyone's hopes and dreams?
---
Aurene
---
Free to play is enough to reach end game, although a bit irritating since you can interact with other players, or swap maps at your own pace.   
---
Heart of Thorns &amp; Path of Fire expansions give access to specialization at max level. For most classes (Professions) these specialization are better than Core version. This would not be a huge problem in Open World, but if you want to do Raids/Fractals/WvW/PvP you will need those specializations.   Heart of thorns is almost a must if you want to play any condition (think of it like magic damage, which ignore armor, but takes time to reach its potential) because of a specific stat combination called Vipers is only available in Heart of thorns or if you want to play Healing class, you might need Path of Fire (since most healers use a specific stat combination only available in path of Fire)  
---
I never managed to get to max level in ESO, so I can't make the comparison sorry
---
the wiki has sheets that update to the current market prices via the api. they should be linked somewhere in the individual packet's pages together with droprate research.
---
Yes, ever since HoT the game has been powercreeped to shit. WvW and Pvp in general is way more spammy, amount of boons are way too easy to gain. Sustain is broken since PoF, dps and CC is also too easy to achieve in PvE. Just imagine if there were no elite specs for the pve and wvw raids. It would have required way more skill, coordination and knowledge about finishers rather than just holding 1 button throughout the whole fight. I would say something for pvp but for once it’s actually kinda balanced which it hasnt been for ages. But old days with core specs will always be remembered in all modes.
---
Wow, your character looks suitably legendary!
---
I'll give you an upvote haha
---
you can throw an API key into https://gw2efficiency.com/ and see if it shows up there. to use unbound magic as a currency you're still gonna need HoT and season 3.
---
Thank you it’s clear ! Thank you for taking your time to write a response. So if I already got the « already seen, already done » title, I still must have the star. I will just check with someone online on my server to be sure. 
---
Hope someone will have some up to date elementalist guide to help me on the last part.
---
More classic-style dragon, maybe horns going back and a longer snout.   
---
This is the first mount where I'm excited to buy a skin if it fills that niche
---
True, but if you don't use teleport to friend you have to do at least a first mission anyway:-)
---
Even when I was enjoying PvP, I didn't enjoy WvW.   
---
To me it feels slow, and if you die, you have to walk back. 
---
To be fair , I would say they are completely different.   
---
Anyway, my suggestions is to work on potions if you don't enjoy WvW as they will add up over time. If you do, then you will finish the reward track anyway.
---
If you play at a resolution equal or higher than 1440p ultrawide, you will see a change.
---
&gt; By that brain dead logic every videogame in history is pay to win because you have to buy the system needed to play it.
---
No.
---
It is about buying something with money that gives you an advantage over other players of the same game. If you don't own a the system how are other players at an advantage?!
---
Just by definition it would be BUT we don't see it as that because we get more from the expansion than just the advantage. But still, this wasn't the point of my argument in the first place at which you get too hung up about.
---
A fix is not a nerf just because someone exploiting a flaw feels that it's a nerf.
---
Peopleexploited the original system doing CoF1 over and over. So they had to fix that by moving the intended rewards to a daily cap.
---
Then people instead did the same 3 quick paths daily. So they had to fix that too.
---
An exploit doesn't have to require a bug or be something punishable to be an exploit. As long as it's an unintended consequence with undesired outcome, it'd be an exploit.
---
Sometimes just fixing the issue is punishment enough for those exploiting it.
---
have been using taco for the skyscale and its very nice! you can quickly check if there is anything on the map as well
---
Discussing your opinions about what is exploit and whats not is not part of this thread.
---
"Dwaynnnnnnnnnnaaaaaa!!!!!"
---
*Splash*
---
GTX 1060 it's more than enough imo, wait for the new Ryzen 3 CPUs and upgrade to the best single core power cpu they have in store, that's how you'll see the best upgrades.
---
Even more because upgrading the video card with gw2 will probably bring the smallest performance upgrade, like 3-6% at best.
---
well, at least we know that runes are coming
---
It could be changed to simply enabling unbound magic to act as volatile magic and recharge mount endurance as soon as you get the ability to gather unbound magic. It'd be posblably easier than what I'd like to see, but that may be a bit simple and boring.  
---
There's an idea that I think could be more fun: Cross expansion masteries.
---
I mentioned the idea here and there before. Let me copypaste one example:
---
&gt; This is one of the things that could be done with the "cross-expansion" masteries I always wanted to reward players for getting all expansions.
---
&gt; They could all go in a single list, and require to have unlocked a certain mastery from each expansion to unlock, and cost 1 single point from each expansion to learn, and they'd be fallible with exp from either expansion. For example:
---
&gt; * Soaring Winds (Updraft Use +  Aerial Prowess) : Griffons quickly regain their endurance while in contact with an updraft.
---
&gt; * Magic Jolt (Leyline Gliding + Aerial Finesse): Griffons instantly regain all endurance while in contact with a leyline.
---
&gt; * Soothing Winds (Updraft Use +  Air Rescue) : Skyscale slowly regain health, endurance and flight juice while in contact with an updraft.
---
&gt; * Perpetual energy channel  (Leyline Gliding + Rift Repair): Skyscale no longer lose 'flight juice' while in contact with a leyline.
---
&gt; * Life Saver (Exalted Assistance + Rejuvenating Revival) : Skimmers will automatically mount when stepping on dangerous terrain such as Sulfurous Sands, Lava or Branded Spikes. (This effect will have a 60s cooldown)
---
&gt; * Tactical Retreat (Exalted Assistance + Any mount-related mastery): Can now mount while in combat. Mounting in combat disables the engage skill for 30s. (This ability will have a 240s cooldown)
---
&gt; * Stalking Sands (Nuhoch Stealth Detection + Adroit Evasion): Jackal can use the second mount ability to spend endurance to gain Stealth temporarily. 
---
&gt; * Muddy Sands (Nuhoch Wallows  + Shifting Sands): Jackal will now use Nuhoch wallows without dismounting when jumping on them.
---
&gt; * Ancient Bond (Any Ancient Magics mastery + Volatile Magic Resonance): Mounts will now regain endurance when touching Unbound Magic like when they touch Volatile Magic.
---
&gt; All those surplus points can have some use and make masteries learned in one region useful in others. And the costs would be low, so it won't use all of them and still keep some leeway.
---
now it was possible
---
[deleted]
---
Well from my perspective your argument is hung up on the wrong spot because you fixate on the idea of pay to win.
---
Core came out 7 years ago, if you choose to only have access to ancient content that's your decision. People who are playing newer, better, more polished content should absolutely expect to have a better quality experience.
---
At that point its not a fairness thing, its a you had 7 years to figure out to make 15$ thing so don't try to drag other people down because you couldn't be bothered.
---
there are to currecies with close name: volatile magic and unbound magic.
---
in your screenshot, you show volatile magic
---
i think you might be mistaken between both currencies
---
The maze and beach don't even take 5 min if people pass the orbs. There's nothing stopping people from sitting where the beach orbs spawn before the ghost pop up.
---
The wind itself is fine though, but in combination with all the other shit you have to dodge AND all the conditions from the adds on top of that makes it frustrating to deal with. The fairly small area doesn't help either. The entire fight is one big clusterfuck.
---
You don't need to be lvl 80 to get your mount. You can join the story instance of other players.
---
r/TIHI
---
That is really helpful, I appreciate it!
---
There's a fairly decent amount of limitations from what I can tell, but I guess it's still enough to get a feel of the game.
---
I'll try it out for a couple of hours and probably end up buying the expansions to get the full experience.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
Murder the Elite that gives quickness and itscessf
---
the registration page needs to run scripts. i ran into this issue when i tried to create some alts, and noticed that the account name field was unable to display any numbers after the dot, which usually get generated as you type out your name. so check if those number appear, and if not, then something is still blocking scripts.
---
If only they would move the no-fun box 2 meters up so you can still use roads with raptor/beetle. The north-east part of Hoelbrak is annoying.
---
Okay, mabye timelag betwenn arenanet Account Verification and guild wars
---
Even if you get blown off you can angle your body so that you just slide down the ramp or land on the island. It's all about being mindful of your position.
---
It's not opinions. It's fact. Read u/Kiroho's comment.
---
There's no 'nerf'.
---
Claiming there's 'nerfs' is disingenuous when there's none.
---
First there was fixes to solve issues, then there was a bonus to make them more rewarding after the fixes.
---
It's not so bad if you practice. Of course YMMV with pugs but our guild has been one shotting it regularly between our two fractal teams even with nasty instabilities like Social Awkwardness (which is up today), Last Laugh, and Outflanked.
---
&gt;Siren's Reef is probably meant as a condition fight for classes like Scourge, Mirage, Firebrand &amp; Renegade to excel.
---
Ahahah, no. 
---
&gt;The problem is that the current Fractal meta is glassier than ever and is generally ill-equipped to deal enough cleave to keep adds manageable.
---
Ahahah, what.
---
Okay, so. 1) This fractal is designed perfectly for a bursty fractal meta, all  bosses get much easier if you kill them fast, before adds swarm on you.  2) By "cleave" you probably mean just epi, because all current  classes that are good for fractals have pretty decent aoe damage. Ele/pslb/warrior have smaller range, dh/reaper/fb a bit larger, but cleave is there, a worst you need to assist it a bit with some pulls and positioning. 
---
&gt;It's pretty safe to say that it's pretty much a flop with the "average" T4 player and pugging it is not fun in the slightest. 
---
It is not about fractal, mostly. It is about  "average" non-cm t4 player (because I'm pugging it with typical cm 250+kp groups, and I would totally call people like these "average" fotm pug players) being utterly incompetent. Ofc it isn't fun failing in the company of drooling glassy-eyed condi scourges and w/e. Don't be a bad player, avoid bad players.
---
Where did Berserker become worse than what it was? Less build diversity? The spec straigth up got 2 extra builds for high end play, how is it less diverse now than what it used to be?
---
And weaker than core? Is OP serious or just bad troll? 
---
Post makes no sense, and for you claming to be a Warrior main it looks like you dont know anuthing about Warrior
---
Try that with the Young Skyscale tonic.
---
The stuff of nightmares.
---
The main point of that section was that you should be breaking that stuff down for materials for the last stage of your legendary crafting rather than selling it for gold.
---
&gt; "Curse your eyes."
---
I believe it's "damn your eyes," and I agree, one of my favorite Risen lines. Honestly pretty chilling.
---
&gt; Mordrem are hit or miss in design
---
I really prefer Mordrem during LS2. They were colorful and strange and exotic-looking. Entering into HoT, there's more focus on the ones that just look like dry bark.
---
&gt; Branded Ascalon is pretty eerie and good in atmosphere. Somehow loses atmopshere as it goes to Elona.
---
Now that you mention it, I see what you mean. It might have something to do with the difference between branding forest versus branding desert, and the design decisions they made to make a distinction between them.  Also, I don't think Elona's brand ever uses the same "wall" when entering the Brand (the one seen mostly in Fields of Ruin). Despite being a bit too obvious, it did make crossing over markedly daunting in Ascalon. Whatever the reasons, you're right. It's just not as impactful in Elona.
---
&gt; Primordus
---
I hope we get some more designs from GW1 to carry over when we do eventually get around to Primordus. There was one destroyer design that was like a bladed wheel, really cool and pretty scary. They definitely can do more than what we've seen in GW2 so far.
---
Yes for example, Scarlet, a sylvari was an engineer and Rox, a charr is a ranger
---
Ok perfect I’ll take a look. Do you have the issue on the website for image loading or am I the only one ?
---
I honestly think underwater combat is good enough to be a *supplemental* part of gameplay if we should ever need to fight the DSD. But I don't get why people assume that has to be the entire expansion.
---
If I were to imagine a Deep Sea expansion, I'd imagine something extending from the shores of a continent to the depths below the depths. Imagine one map with the corruption of the dragon finally reaching our shores. It'd be some territory by the ocean that got flooded, so only the rooftops and a few tall hills are above the water, making a unique area to navigate. Monsters come from below, and the water itself is a hazard.
---
Other maps would take us to Largos civilizations, which are (for the sake of mixed gameplay) like giant air pockets within their buildings.  From there, we could find ancient caves leading to the Depths of Tyria even deeper than the sea floor of the Unending Ocean, where we can travel undetected close enough to the dragon to strike at its heart.
---
I imagine themes of "drowning" would be common, but not always within water. Darkness would be a big thing, engulfing us and making our surroundings feel suffocating. Pressure would be another theme, not just with the water weighing down on us but also the mechanics making us feel vulnerable.
---
There's a lot they could play with. It doesn't just need to be "underwater combat" all the way through.
---
I have made the experience, that when you got a good healer, decent condi cleanse and don't get wooshed off the ship by every wind blow, it is kinda fine.
---
\^ This.  The design of leveling up is so that you get used to all of the abilities on each class.  I started with an engineer and mezmer and I know those very well because of it.  I went straight to level 80 with an elementalist and I still don't really know how to play it. Metabatlle is up to date, and it gets you the 'best' builds, but a) it may not be fun for you and b) you do need to know other skills so that you can do things in different situations.  If you solo alot, Metabattle may not be the best for you, because it's optimized for team play.  It will do for 90% of situations, but if you want to solo a Group Champion, then you typically need something a bit tankier and probably condition cleanse. My engineer is a dedicated flametrhower for PVE, which is sub-optimal, but so much fun to see everything burn!  I can solo anything but the bounties in the expansion.
---
Hi there, so the routes, where to jump, where to glide, etc, are all them done by hand?
---
There's also the stuff how vanilla brand has all this vegetation and buildings twisting into curved, unnatural shapes, eerie glows in random places, ground that has melted into metal, formed bubbles and then frozen again.
---
The only particularly striking branded area in Elona was the shattered pyramid. There's also like that one shattered and curved stone pillar asset that I like, that they had in couple places, especially in Jahai Bluffs. Otherwise it's just slightly darker desert with purple crystals sprinkled around. It's not bad but it never had quite the same feeling of "this is evil and unnatural place". As you said, the lack of a veil when entering the zone might be part of it.
---
I was using the royal "you", I assume nothing about your personal spending habits, chill.
---
I simply believe that elite specs SHOULD be vertical progression. The idea of advanced classes have been a part of RPGs and MMORPGs for decades. They give you a goal to aim for, they make you feel rewarded when you reach that destination, and they help you specialize in a game play style you enjoy.
---
If the base class is as good as the elite class, why even bother unlocking it to begin with? This is one of the reasons why people feel Warrior is so underpowered right now, because it doesn't have that clear role identity that most of the others do.  
---
None of that really matters though, cause Core classes don't make money, and I'm not super confident in their balancing team anyway so I'd rather them just leave it alone lol. Imagine if they brought Chrono and Mirage down to Core Mesmer's level, instead of bringing Core Mesmer up... would that be healthy for the game?
---
Please don't. If you play mainly GW2, upgrading from a 1060 (which is a fairly decent GPU already) is really not gonna improve much on your gameplay, unless you are not playing on 1080p. You didn't mention that in the post, so I assume you are playing on 1080p.
---
Keep the money, and save up for a different processor instead. You are gonna see a BIG improvement if you upgrade to for example a 8600k or 9600k. Your processor is not overclockable and if you get a new CPU that is a "k-version" that you overclock: that is gonna be the big difference for you.
---
Depending on your motherboards though. You have some really good RAM which you are probably not using to the max aswell. Your CPU only allows RAM for up to 2666 MHz in speed. You could overclock that through your BIOS aswell, again: depending on your motherboard.

Math is not opinions.
---
Math is always right.
---
Right! I forgot about the bubbles and everything. Yeah, Branded Ascalon definitely felt *wrong* in all the best possible ways.
---
Pretty much how I play at the moment. Maybe 30-45 minutes before work to get my Daily done and after work I play something else and at the weekend maybe something more when I feel motivated to do something.
---
Though, I have done a lot in this game already and what I can do is limited. I would take it slow, find what you like or just get your feet wet again by doing the Story.
---
[There's something in the water!](https://youtu.be/JERptrt3qW4?t=4)
---
It's not really a hard encounter even with We Bleed Fire.
---
The thing plays out like a typical fight for survival encounter except the only danger is getting knocked off the boat. From a druid perspective the thing you have to really do is go full on condi cleanse to deal with the all the slows/chills that make it harder for the group to dodge the winds. Aside from We Bleed Fire and someone not knowing the green mechanic; the only real spike damage is getting knocked into the water so healing is ironically pretty chill.
---
Things quickly go to shit when the DPS can't avoid getting blown off, getting separated and picked off.
---
There's just more pressure on the healer to do their job and the DPS to actually be competent with their positioning.
---
I wouldnt play to be efficient, I'd play to relax and living story/expansion maps provide enough content for that.
---
It is not that low... lets say, more bursty, dependand on avatar 😋
---
It wouldn't be a ton of work. For one you only use theday effects and the other you only us the night effects.
---
Since you didn’t read the whole thing I’ll provide you with a portion of the FAQ:
---
“... pay-to-win is defined as downloadable content that, from the perspective of an individual user, eases progression through such content, assists in accomplishing the game’s goals...”
---
Tha could affect a shitload of GW2 things in the marketplace. And it covers the “pay for convenience” argument I am reading all over the place.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
The silverwastes.
---
The desolation
---
There's also examples where the 2nd word is just 'the', like the Desolation, Silverwastes, and the Grove. Then there are the three domains in the desert as well: Vabbi, Kourna, and Istan.
---
I don't share that sentiment towards single-worded map names though. Queensdale just happens to have the descriptive name worked into the rest.
---
Instead of “mobs won’t attack” I think it would make more sense to just block all attacks while being unable to move. 
---
If it could swim as well, we’d finally have an underwater mount.
---
Since when are the JP chests not balanced? They sure as hell aren't worth farming... and the only times I grab them after completing the JP once for the achievement is for dailies or if I can use a mount to cheese it and it happens to be somewhere I'm already going like Troll's Revenge in Lion's Arch.
---
Wow, didn't know about that, always thought it was a sum of both skins in one weapon.
---
&gt; volatile magic for trophies
---
What do you mean? What trophies?
---
Thank you for all you answers guys ! I didnt think that 1060 GTX already enough to hit the top of what graphic card can do on GW2. I won't waste money upgrading it
---
*laughs in german*
---
If done right, it'd give bonuses for getting masteries on each expansion without making the individual masteries less useful.
---
For example, in my example griffons would regain endurance on leylines, and skyscales would regain flight, but  that would not make the griffon follow better the leyline than gliding when it has ups and downs as gliders automatically track them, and gliding on a leyline would still work better than a skyscale to get to the end of the leyline as leyline gliding is pretty fast.
---
Thank you for your answer. I won't get a better graphic card if 1060 GTX can manage. I play effectilvely in 1080p  
---
When you talk about "big difference" with upgrading from I5 8400 to 9600K for example, what are we talking about ? 5-10 FPS ? Or even more ?   
---
I am not a big fan of non-K processors but i got it for almost nothing thanks to a friend of mine selling it
---
That would make Bloodstone Fen SO much fun to play in!
---
What do you do if you need a vendor that's not near a wall for you to stop? Just ignore it?
---
The real pro tip is aaaalways in the comments.
---
The Gods have left. Time for New Gods
---
I'd be cool if skins that have alternate day/night versions unlocked the day and night versions separately. 
---
You know, like how you get the bloodied and clean versions of the medium halloween armor, and how you get the luminous heavy helmet with the visor up and down.
---
I stop autowalk by pressing the 'walk backwards' key. (S)
---
Last episode for some reason they couldn't get a handle on spoilers. Mods did great this time around.
---
While I personally think HoT is the better expansion, PoF will offer better value to new players as it is required for the current (and presumably next) season of the Living World - if you've been playing for a little while you may have already unlocked a few of these episodes already!
---
Uuugh... the german translation of this games texts/names is sometimes very odd.
---
I have english audio since day one with german text and at somepoint I got annoyed to swap text back and forth to be able to use the wiki so I sticked with english. Last week I decided to do a raid full clear with german audio and it was horrible. I had to change back after Xera.
---
I just want something more down to earth, maybe charr/norn and without deus ex asura.
---
still works. i usually use some fountains.
---
Even my GTX 960 is underutilized by the game in 1080p and 1060 is a lot better.
---
HoT offers more maps that are focused on mapwide meta events that people farm and gliding (along with some other types of masteries that appear every now and then). The downside is it's not as long of a story as PoF and the maps aren't as large as PoF's (though there is more verticality to more of them).
---
PoF offers mounts, more story focus, and larger maps than HoT. It's downside is that it doesn't have many map metas, so it leads to things being more empty than the HoT maps usally are.
---
Personally I'd go for PoF cause I'm more interested in the story, the mounts feel more useful than the HoT masteries (though gliding and the HoT masteries are nice too), and new episodes require the most current expansion to be able to play them (ie; you'll need PoF to play new episodes they add until they decide to make a new expansion).
---
I'm pretty certain I've never transferred and I don't seem to have a free transfer, unless it only works within your region or something.
---
Everything in German is one word anyway.
---
I am all for this, it breaks some weapons that i don't want the skin changing and resultingly looks bad 50% of the time for the look i'm going for.
---
Somewhere entirely new and different.
---
Silverwastes.
---
Drytop
---
Step 1: reflects
---
Step 2: stability
---
Step 3: move from orange stuff
---
There you go!!! I'm sure you can do it!
---
I think it’s “ The Drytop”
---
Erection intensifies
---
I was having more of a problem with the voices and pronounciations themselves.
---
The story is predictable but its not the issue.the fact that aurene is resurrected immediately after she dies removed any meaning from that story point.
---
Yea none of that happy ending was earned. However, I’m hoping they won’t make the same mistake again with whatever comes next, whether it be a new villain or another elder dragon. This episode somehow beat out the end of episode three in terms of “what the actual fuck” factor.
---
Nah, it's just the thing that we put everything together to one word. 
---
Glutbucht -&gt; glut bucht -&gt; 1:1 EmberBay
---
Blutsteinsumpf -&gt; blutstein sumpf -&gt; 1:1 Bloodstone Fen

At least we need the "-". ;)
---
For real the german translation abuses the poor "-" as hell.
---

For me its

Asura: Engineer, Elementalist

Charr: Warrior (Blood legion), Engineer (Iron Legion), Thief (Ash Legion)

Sylvari: Mesmer, Ranger

If you think your thread should be allowed to stay or if this was a mistake do report this comment or send a modmail and Pact commander will come take a look.

Pterodactyl would work better on Skimmer though
---
I would love for us to go to blazeridge/blood legion homelands. And I hope the charr there will be super rascist to my human characters.
---
Yeah, I knew that wasn't that long, usually taking 40-60min CMs/T4 including what I consider long one. The fact there not much blink portal skip, might be the reason why I feel this one is long. :/
---
I use drive also and don't pay for extra storage. I came up on my 15GB cap and didn't realize I wasn't receiving email until my lawyer called me about a message he sent me that was time sensitive. Believe it or not, those warning messaged Google sends you about not having any free space left and your mail not coming through once you're maxed are not bluffs!
---
Unless you run a business and your mail is stopped because you run out of storage. Happens fast when you also use Google Drive and don't pay for the extra allotment.
---
Wow, you are still mad about your failed post? xD
---
Seems like you really can't get over me. ;)
---
However, math is math. There is no opinion. Just like the other comments already said.
---
Wow, that's generous :)
---
For sure!
---
It is (or at least was) a fairly common issue. Since I got the achieve there’s no need anymore. Unless they add a collection which needs me to redo it
---
Charr Vs Asura space race.
---
yeah when all the drama of the layoffs happend one of the twitter posts from a dev mentioned that they still have at least 1 major project currently in development with is planned for 2020  to release (could be 2021 too dont know it so well anymore and cant find it)
---
Also to add to the achievement stuff, it was weird they didn't do a collection achievement for the Blossoming Mist Shard armor. I mean, they don't always do one for every set, but it seems odd to not have one here. It's the final episode for Season 4, the final map is a meta map that's meant to keep people coming back, and they've done it for the past few episodes (like the Requiem armor and Dragonsblood weapons) it just feels strange to not have something like that here.
---
people still dragging this shit out???
---
I gave up on living world the moment scarlet died, after that bastion of the penitent got me hype as fuck and then everything went to braindead again. And I don't expect the next season to be any different really.
---
Yea. More than a wrong move, it was also a missed opportunity to delve deeper into the characters and see how they respond to these sorts of thing, see how they react in the face of a hopeless situation.
---
I really want to like charr, on paper they are awesome, but in game the voice acting kills it for me. The females are constantly screaming at a 10 and the males voice grating is like nails on a chalkboard to me. An expansion full of that would drive me up the wall
---
Reflect makes the fractal pretty easy, but apparently stability is useless at the final boss. You still get stunned by her aoe and thrown off the ship by the wind.
---
Yeah when all the drama of the layoffs happend one of the twitter posts from a dev mentioned that they still have 1 major project currently in development with is planned for 2020 to release (could be 2021 too dont know it so well anymore and cant find the tweet now).

Glint's plan is done and dusted. It's over.

Damn. What typo gets you banned this long?
---
Just give day/night items an option, either on the item itself or at an NPC  
---
• Auto  
---
• Day  
---
• Night
---
Well that’s understandable, but given the quality of the other releases this is an undeniable step down in terms of quality
---
Welp you gave me an idea how to do my fullclear this week and how to even make it a drinking game.
---
What did you say?
---
Must be an interesting typo if you got banned for it? Care to share some interesting details with your Reddit family?
---
That cursed moment when you're passing by an anime in your main language.

Thank for correction, I edited my text. :)
---
Yea, and have us work for reviving Aurene too, not just have it so that it happens randomly and everything is fine after.
---
I sense there’s more to it and you’re hiding something.
---
Wait for next month when tehy drop a legendary accessory that needs 1000 from each. That would be so evil. ^^
---
We've already established that the material rewards are so low as to be meaningless. That leaves the only reward as an intrinsic one. Fun is not an objective thing that is constant between all people. Different people enjoy different things. You've claimed this, but it isn't true. You're still trying to dictate how other players are allowed to play and enjoy themselves. And while you try to turn this back around on me, my original point remains, you could always just not use a mount. Other people would be able to play any way they want. So, again, I'll ask: Why are you so concerned about how other people would have fun if nobody would force you to take an action that you wouldn't enjoy?
---
I like the jumping puzzles in the game. I can't even tell you how many times I've done a daily JP instead of taking the easy Mesmer portal because I like playing on them. I know many other people who feel the same way. Many of them would also have more fun if they could use the jumping puzzles as set pieces on which they can play their own way. This would not affect anybody else. Why does your ability to have fun depend on everybody else being forced to play the one specific way that you would like?
---
A wild u/Dornsinger apears.

u/SpectralSolid fainted!
---
If it takes 8 days, and those are turned into 2 hours per day, then you can "technically" Do it all in a single day, assuming you own all the timegated materials and other stuff.
---
The way I judge "realistic feel" in a game is a long chapter :) but basically anything that feels logical and plausible. I don't mind magic as long as there's a decent fantasy explanation for it, what annoys me the most is when physical laws are blatantly broken. Like a small character spinning around with a sword or an axe that would clearly weigh half as much or more than the character. Or when a heavy plated class does acrobatic dodges or ride a tiny mount. Basically I prefer logical/realistic &gt; cool and not the other way around.
---
Anyway, thanks for the suggestion will check that class out some more.
---
I use a can of steak and asparagus for most of my lower classes because I'm lazy lol. There's also +expertise +Condi food in there too. The wvw portable provisioner is wonderful so that you don't have to hold up your squad if you forget something. Sadly you can't get any decent utilities from it but you can slap something on if you're in a jam.
---
Cantha
---
Because as for now there is no way to get skin by playing the game, like you can get Glider by completing leg backpack

And the rest of the story is?

* Dragonjump
---
* Dragonflight
---
* Dragonsit
---
* Dragonlaydownandrestforabitbecausehegettingtooldforthis.
---
So true, friend.
---
Only Scourge and FB would be fine in that fight, probably. But I agree that this fight is OK for condis, because it takes enough time for them to accumulate (different from many t4 bosses with &lt;10s phases).
---
Classic Anet.
---
There is this concept of 'the canopy' for skyscale. Imagine frustum cone above and around your mounted character while on the ground. You can fly freely and even stop mid air as long as you're inside of this cone. If however you move past boundaries of the cone, the mount will start to forcefully descend into the cone boundary where it would stop. If you move past the max radius you will be put to the ground. When you touch the ground the canopy resets and it is measured from that position.
---
It's obviously going to be Dragonborn or Dragon Reborn
---
It's not necessary, but having 2-factor authentication is good general practice that can help prevent your account from being hacked or stolen (not just for gw2 but for any service that allows 2FA)
---
he wanted to tell he's from Nigeria
---
Start with PoF to unlock mounts, which are some of the best content ANet has ever made, and which you can use on all the vanilla maps and HoT maps (when you eventually buy HoT).  
---
PoF also puts you into the current content most players are doing, although HoT’s content is more replayable on average and lots of people are still doing it.
---
If you're from WoW, you'll probably want to remember GW2 is a *very* different game. You'll see once you get your first mount(s)
---
Dragon's Rise
---
Amá-la fight is really good. It rewards positioning and knowing the phases and reading animations (i.e. when to use special action or dodge). I’d be thrilled if all t4s had a final boss like that.
---
It took me a while and I certainly haven't mastered the class as I just hit 80 and killed Zhaitan but I do find greatsword with illusions/clones survives rather well.  I found it is important to learn the max distance and staying just inside that so the illusions and such are closer to the baddie.  As a note, I only solo PvE with her.
---
I am still figuring out my alternate weapon.
---
This game is terribly optimized, there is no argue about it. Anet once had a staff made bold claim that dx12 would not improve the game performance despite how many people firmly believe otherwise. Today, we have a player that made a dx12 proxy which proved that dx12 does improve the performance further by removing significant amount of cpu overhead. Your only best option is to try the dx12 proxy also known as d912pxy. If using it doesn't further improve your fps, it is likely your gpu limiting you.
---
&gt;but what you’re saying is they aren’t simple flying mounts like in World of Warcraft ? You get on them and can just fly up and down for as long as you want?
---
The simple answer is "no"; GW2's mounts aren't like that. They have gameplay mechanics based on stamina.
---
from the sea
---
&gt; ...is the DE only a high learning curve char or is a waste of time?
---
Thief in general is a waste of time when you consider how ANet treats the class, and the amount of effort and commitment that is required to perform anywhere close to the other classes' performance...with less effort and commitment.
---
There leaving the map open-ended.
---
No, no! Not LS5! There must be a pause, like it was between HoT and LS4 (LS3) so this will happen with LS6/Next expansion.
---
Don’t forget to add a link to this in the subreddit wiki, or it will just fall below fold soon and be lost except to the occasional search.  /r/guildwars2/wiki/guides

No, she lays an egg and we have to do the collection over again..
---
bruh...
---
Oh no! People are expressing their opinions and criticism about the collection! Oh horror! /s
---
running a few diviner's pieces open world isn't actually too bad for the self buffs. it is more than adequate for your needs.
---
IIRC one can't do Gold &gt; Gem conversion on free accounts. I would assume to combat gold sellers making and upgrading accounts with no real currency cost.
---
I almost exclusively play zergs.  If you want to be useful in a Zerg, don’t play thief.  It’s really only good for getting some cheeky kills on overextended people.
---
Elite specs have been made much easier to acquire since HoT launched. They aren't too bad, but they'll be a lot faster and easier if you can find a hero point train, since many challenges in HoT are hard-to-solo champions or in places hard to access without masteries.
---
I'd say PoF isn't necessary. It does have a lot of good content, and the mounts are a joy to use, so you'll probably want to pick it up if you stick around in the game. I'd suggest playing around in HoT for a while to see if it sparks your interest again, then picking up PoF if it does.
---
The Top of Dry
---
Congratulations! You're in the endgame now.
---
Pick between day to do stuff like LS3-4 open world map , Day to do dungeon fractal and sandwich them between daily.
---
If you are doing map completion  on PoF expansion , LS3, LS4 it help to keep a notepad file recording your heart quest so you dont have to do it again or can pick a map that match the daily.
---
Metas. Fractals. Doing your Dailies.
---
any advice for farming legendary?
---
Well, if you are mindful of your positioning, you will Not be blown off ;-)
---
Deadeye has decent aoe(tagging potential) if you build it right; It's not very useful in zergs because you bring just ranged dps(not even that high).
---
In all dialogues, individual hatchlings are referred to as female. Commander's skyscale is 100% female (dialogues + sidebar notifications)
---
Just kill the ads first so you don't get overwhelmed. They only spawn when the boss-health reaches a certain amount, it's either every 20 or 25%. Then you can concentrate on just avoiding the AoE without having 30+ mobs around.
---
It's really not a hard bossfight as long as you don't try to bruteforce your way through.
---
&gt; if you choose to buy an expansion, you can convert your in game gold to gems and buy expansions if you want.
---
You can not buy expansions with ingame currency.
---
The two expansions are the only thing you can only buy for real money.
---
You can get for in-game currency the deluxe edition upgrade once you own the base expansion however.
---
And the other main thing you get from buying any of the expansions is the ability to freely use the trading post. This makes the experience a lot more enjoyable.
---
Translators just dont give a shit and throw their words into google translate.
---
Most bad translation are too literal and relay the original words more than the original meaning.
---
Staff Daredevil I'm Zergs using Marauder is very very powerful. Unfortunately it's not more popular.
---
It's just a question of people getting used to that part of the meta. Eventually you'll have a hard core of people who do it constantly and will have little-to-no problem dealing with the time-limit, just like in the other popular metas.
---
You said you have money, so I take it that you are ok with spending money for gems.
---
Having this said, then you clearly have no need of being efficient in farming as you can buy gems and trade them for gold, and buy whatever material you need.
---
With this in mind, if ascended is what you want, you can easily buy the materials for it and just craft it. It costs anywhere between 50 and 100g per piece. But you can enjoy the game in full exotics just as well, so I don't recommend it.
---
I would suggest that you do whatever you like and relax and have fun with the game. 
---
Play through the story and get the mounts (griffon is 250g and a bit of running around, so keep that in mind). This will help you navigate through the world a lot more easily.
---
After that just pick a goal or achievement or achievement reward that you like and play for it, or just do whatever keeps you entertained.
---
My point is, have fun. You don't need to burn out from trying to be efficient in anything. if you set yourself on a goal, then you will naturally start scheming on how to make that efficient in itself, but that's part of the fun :)
---
Let me set the scene. Im on a 4k monitor, I haven't received bound my keys for my skills cause I'm used to the 123456 etc for them. I use the mouse to click and target air skills and such. I'm usually pretty quick with it, however when moving to a 4k monitor you can change the UI to scale up but it doesn't scale the mouse cursor so. I asked " does anyone know how to make my mouse 'bigger' "
---
I won't get my hopes up.
---
There is no reason to try and min/max your game if you have very little time to play around with. Imo play through the stories and the seasons, get the mounts and the gliding, do some meta events, unlock your elite specs, do some fractals (first 20 levels don't require any ascended anyway), some collections, so WvW and/or some sPvP. 
---
Just play what you enjoy the time you have to play and pick things that you like for the day. If you get some extra time here and there, then have a list of what you want to focus on. Like grinding for some gold, getting some ascended or legendary or what ever you feel you need more time to get. 
---
Through out time you will realize what you enjoy and can focus more on those things, even with very little time.
---
I really hope Lews Therin Kinslayer doesn't make an appearance...

You can unlock all the skills and traits at lvl 80 without collecting a single Hero Point. Get those HPs on your way to lvl 80 just fastens things.

You can buy quartz crystal from the tp (not the charged ones). You can also buy skyscale food too.
---
you only really benefit from that though if you swap frequently *and* have an upgrade extractor.
---
Im on a 4k monitor, when you scale the UI in the settings the cursor doesnt change size. I asked "Is there anyway to make the cursor 'bigger' " in map chat. 1 hour later I was banned for 168 hours.
---
lol that would be.
---
Obviously, we should go to Cantha and kill 2 more gods and the rest of the dragons. I don't see what else could top our current supreme commander achievements.
---
Ugh....more crystals.
---
&gt; I'm, not sure if LS3 without hot works.
---
It won't work. LS3 is tied to HoT like LS4 is tied to PoF. Same with raids. You can't get into W5 and W6 without PoF.
---
The only exception are GH. You can visit them if you are guildmember but you won't be able to conquer them if you don't own specific expansion.

&gt;"Luckily we don't even need the forge, just grab a paint brush and pour blood on the shitty knock-offs, now they're just as good as the original! Why? Because SCIENCE!"
---
&gt; Char- Engineers (scrapper)most definitely. Its basically part of their culture. Rev's- Rytlok is the first Rev so deff race first profession award there.
---
While Rytlock was the first revenant, charr are still suspicious of magic users and casters, and I think revenants wouldn't really be seen with good eyes by the charr society. I think warriors, engineers and thieves (ash legion) are more fitting professions for the charr.
---
&gt; Norn- Guardian (dragon hunter) Braham becomes one of the first dragonhunters when he seeks to recover Eir's bow after her death, and makes it his primary focus to hunt down the dragon that killed her.
---
I think warriors fit norn a lot too, and rangers because of the importance of the hunt in their culture. Also, revenants also fit a lot with norn, even more than with other races i'd say, due to many of them having a strong connection to the mists.
---
Isn't that just the Skyscale collection, almost?

You do know Tegwen dies in the PS... Right?

as long as they never give us main characters as rideable mounts, that would ruin the game

Looks like it should be fine. For comparison, it's weaker than my system (GTX 1080, 8700k), which gets varied FPS from 40 to 120 depending on the area, or during meta events, I'll get 20-40 fps. These are at the highest settings at 1440p, with character model quality set to medium.
---
I was put off by the pronounciation of “Kryta“ in the German version of GW2. If I remember correctly, it’s just the English one which felt weird and wrong since I always thought of it like “Krüta“.
---
(And it was in fact different in GW1, wasn’t it?)
---
Anyways, I also changed to English for better audio and a much smoother experience when using websites like the wiki.
---
Yeah. Jennah gave it to the charr after she commisioned the Vigil to retrieve it. 
---
Nobody has claimed it yet.
---
There's Imperators, but no Khan-Ur.
---
Is that a prebuilt PC? How much does it cost?
---
I play GW2 on a potato laptop. 4gb ram, an intel dual core from 2012, integrated graphics, and a HDD. I get framerate drops, so I typically only play solo (which is all I like to do anyway) but, I can do everything proficiently (I just get pretty serious about group content, so while I don't need to be carried, being just one of the group and not the top player annoys me, so I don't bother, still, potato lets me do everything in the game).   
---
So you should probably be fine.
---
We really need a **good** new fractal. Deepstone is decent and Siren's Landing is painful.
---
Trading post. The chance of charged quartz from a swing is low anyway
---
weird, I just ran an 80 alt to drytop (first time there) and no nodes...
---
It's not like I added "EDIT" to the only substantial change I made...
---
Either way, you are only repeating what I already said: Mesmers already provide the opportunity to cheese JPs. However, instead of hammering down on what makes them different to mounts (which I believe is important) you double down on what makes them just the same as mounts and therefore arguably makes the mount ban superfluous.
---
And instead of actually thinking my arguments through, the only thing you do is repeatedly stating that I should not speak for others. Yet I've already explained thoroughly why I do. And yet we BOTH speak for groups of people. 
---
You speak for the tired veterans that have enjoyed and done every JP a hundred times and want to cheese them with mounts because that at least creates some new opportunities for fun (though that is the best-case scenario). 
---
I speak for the concept of JP's in general. Which are meant to be jumped, which were designed that way, and which should, at least on paper, still be dedicated to that purpose. Think of it like a legal system. Some players may break the law and it can be fun, but once that law is abolished, even those elements that were fun become boring, and no one remembers these laws (which were what defined JPs in the first place) were even there once upon a time.
---
For every tired vet who may rightfully cheese a JP on a mount and may even find some fun in it, other people will use them as a lazy cheating tool. They will not see JP's, they will just see chests, and they will feel like the game is to blame for that. 
---
You want to know why I take offense with that? I already told you in detail, but okay...
---
It's the same reason why I dislike the idea that everyone who wants their skyscale immediately can have it immediately, and everyone who wants to work for it can work for it. The majority would not work for it simply because they don't have to, and the game would be less rich and active for it. Those that work for it anyway would feel annoyed and discriminated by those that cheese it on mounts and eventually, many of them would give into the temptation as well. 
---
I don't want to see a less rich and just and active and social game that shits on its own features, and to me, mounts in JPs will cause exactly that to happen. Even mesmers would be useless, and I've already explicitly stated why I think that culture does have merits even if they offer shortcuts to the willing. 
---
I have said everything, really. We can just agree to disagree here.
---
Well, Jormag certainly cares enough to put in the extra effort to try to convince people to join his ranks as opposed to just corrupting everyone in his path. And Zhaitan cares enough to play mind games using enslaved friends and families of his enemies, while Mordremoth cares enough to seed in plans of uniting enemy factions and sending the Shadow of the Dragon to hunt down the Commander.
---
They certainly show interest in mortals. And a lot of it is malicious interest.
---
And a lot of people like to throw about the whole "humanizing" mentality when it comes to adding emotions and interests to things, but a lot of animals have emotions and care about other species as well, just as there are plenty of humans out there who care for - or actively hate against - animals. I'm not applying "human morality", I'm applying **living being** morality.
---
This is wrong. The ending to LWS4 was written several months ago.
---
I’ve read all the GW2 books and played this game since launch so here’s my personal opinion:
---
Human: any of the professions work.
---
Sylvari: any of the professions work, even Engineer and Necromancer (Scarlet was an engineer and Trahearne was a necro - both high profile Sylvari). Sylvari are very in tune with nature, so thematically ranger and elementalist would fit the best, but there are also numerous Sylvari warrior NPCs as well.
---
Asura: engineer fits this race thematically the best since Asura are all about technology and golem suits, but any of the other professions are fine too.
---
Norn: ranger, warrior, guardian, and revenant fit the theme of the Norn the best imo. They’re all about communing with the spirits of the wild, nature and balance.
---
Charr (if Blood legion is chosen): Guardian, Warrior, Revenant.
---
Charr (if Ash legion is chosen): thief, ranger. 
---
Charr (if Iron legion is chosen): engineer.
---
Side note: Charr in general are still getting over the huge internal war with the Flame Legion where they basically enslaved the other legions and thus the current legions do not easily trust magic users, which is why you won’t see hardly any Charr NPCs that use magic (elementalists, necros, mesmers, etc).
---
I think the deep sea dragon was best presented so far. All of his minions are deep under the sea, exactly as his name might suggest. So deep in fact that we haven't seen a single freaking instance of them (a point of some annoyance for me, btw)
---
600 euro ish
---
Yes. CPU has pretty neat single core speed, GPU is more than adequate and I have never been close to maxing out 8GB RAM in this game minus when using the unofficial DirectX12 addon thingy (which isn't improving my performance either way)
---
Keep in mind that no PC will give you smooth 60 FPS everywhere. I have i5-6600 which seems to be pretty close to i3-8100 on paper and in word bosses the game drops to even below 30 FPS when character models are set to medium. My other specs: GTX 960, 8GB DDR4.
---
You're right. I was about to edit but you answered before.
---
We gotta spend some time back at home.
---
We never really got to see sylvari culture after Mordremoth's death, and the Pale Tree technically hasn't been shown to have recovered. And the attack by the Shadow of the Dragon was over four years ago.
---
We never followed up on cleansing the Foefire, a thread I am *highly invested in.* Not to mention the upcoming charr civil war. I want to see endgame Ascalon content, dammit!
---
We have made leaps and bounds in discoveries and I'm sure it's affected the asura back home. It'd be nice to see how they're handling things.
---
The norn had a huge moment of chasing after Jormag and seeing him slip away. There's plenty more to explore there.
---
We still have Bloodstones to uncover. In this time of reasonable peace, maybe the Tengu will at least *begin* to consider opening their doors.
---
And the gods have plenty of reason to visit us now.
---
I'm kind of in the boat where *they could go just about anywhere and I'd be cool with it,* so long as they actually start to follow up on threads that have been dangling for way too long. If we ship off for Cantha now, I fear we'll never address the major events happening in Tyria.
---
For FPS increase in GW2, focus on single-core performance of a CPU first and foremost.
---
SSD should be the 2nd priority since the amount of loading time it cuts is tremendous.
---
Appreciated as always. Keep it up.

---
You mad man
---
That's a pretty mediocre deal all things considered. Are you getting it right now, or can you wait a few months?
---
The idea is good, but it would work only if they added extra mastery points as they did for Tyria. We would need lots of new points to complete all of them, considering they usually cost more than the previous level.
---
Man, good thing they didn’t go with that. The skyscale we got looks much better. The crystal look might be an alright skin, but it definitely shouldn’t be the default.
---
Lol, this thing isn’t nearly as good as the model we got
---
Infortunately they keep fixing it and it happens again. I ended up logging in after the reset and finally dod it. If someone is leather farming in lfg in an unbugged instance you can join their squad and see if you can fight him there.
---
If you like that sort of thing (a bunch of people just chilling, or running around a map together) you may not like raids or fractals since those are structured for groups of 5 (fractals) or 10 (raids), and raids at least are hard to get started in. World Boss trains and map meta events may be more your style. 
---
You can add me too if you want, mummefied.4680

While a gift is not a loan that doesn't mean it's okay to stop being grateful for it and forget who gave you what/ who was there in the beginning for you. His friend sounds like a total leech, played it nice and all until he didn't need the benefits anymore and dumped his "friends" like they're nothing as soon as he found something new and better. Such people should not be having other people make excuses for them, unless of course you find that behavior relatable.

I mean they could still be active and a threat in the Charr Homelands. I don't think we have information to conclude they've been defeated there too. After all, the whole cult originated there.

Broke: Pale tree would make a perfect replacement for the Elder Dragon Mordremoth, she's his daughter after all

Woke: My Sylvari PC would make a perfect replacement because she's a granddaughter of an Elder Dragon just like Aurene.

Tagging deadeye build deals a mediocre dps, never said that it is good enough to be required in zerg squads; only said that it is a thing that deadeye can run with(and get a lot of loot)
---
Don't know about OP's country but here GTX 1650 costs 200€ and i5-8100 150€ so that's 350€ for just those 2 alone. Then add SSD, RAM, motherboard, case... I'd say that's not a terrible price for a prebuilt.
---
Playing same build for years can be boring. Nrw rotations usually aren't much different from old ones and gearing up is pretty easy if you've been doing end game content for a while.
---
If it was it makes no sense and makes writers look stupid. 3 dragons are alive and magic isnt stable. We saw glints plan during PoF Vision and its still not fulfilled.
---
930euro

It's less about the price of the parts and more about what the parts actually are.

Oh hell no. Are you only looking at prebuilts? If so, why?

---
Okay, I was focusing on the usage of the word "deal". It's not bad for the price but sure, by investing a bit more you could get a better PC
---
I play guardian and my builds only change cosmetically between patches.

That doesn't make deadeye a good pick, which was the point of this thread.
---
Literally no one is going to believe you without a screenshot.

I am actually pretty experienced I used a level 80 boost like 2 years ago to get the 3 mounts I needed so I could create a new character and complete everything quick. I just realized I did complete PoF before lmao.. I have memory loss.. and I did play Guild Wars 1 for a couple years. Damn I miss that game. I just really want a cape lmao. I do get my builds from meta, but I kind of upgraded all my exotic gear with random shit. I just but an ascended necklace too. I am training soulbeast. I guess I'm mostly confused about the crafting mechanics and obtaining gold. Shit I might just convert gems to gold.. and doing fractals, raids, dungeons, etc. Whenever I go to lions arch I dont know where to go and how to get into parties with people. Thanks though.
---
And I live in Scandinavia, so it’s quite pricey
---
I'd still try to. A custom system would be much better value than both of the options you've linked. If it's absolutely not an option you'd consider, go for the 1660/9400F build, at least it has more than 4 cores.
---
only more ram usage should happen, not disk
---
maybe you accidentaly installed full debug version, check what you selected in installer
---
Very few players do and that’s why god created elitist raiders, so everyone knows it.
---
Nothing like doing the walk of shame while bringing more attention to you
---
well, yes, that’s what i was leading to..? do raids because it is laughably easy to get asc gear from raids. (faster than fractals, cheaper than crafting) You can only put AR infusions on asc gear... so raids THEN t4 fractals... to answer your question in 1 word though: yes.
---
I don't know about you but I find it infinitely more tiresome and irritating to have long periods of time, imagine **all the time**, doing the exact same thing with my characters.
---
Changes often make me learn new things about the classes I play or make me play builds I never played before and that's absolutely great.
---
I completed every daily collection before reset, and I got my skyscale on the eighth day since I began the whole collection. Mind you, I had all required materials and didn’t need to spend any extra time farming.
---
Of course, this will change as of tomorrow’s patch, but all it will reduce is the feeding time in the Raising Skyscales collection. It will still likely take around 6 or 7 days from start to finish as long as you don’t need to spend any time farming.
---
learning rotations is very easy if you know your class and is no work at all... and gear I dont even change for years, beacuse running an okish build is enough for all the content in the game, there is no need to be meta all the time.
---
If i could make everything chaos, i would gladly throw my wallet to anet
---
I ... jus feel lik I never "get good" at them unless I spend hours grinding a golem n where is the fun in that...?
---
It's obviously gonna be Dragon(')s Sleep.
---
The ones in Crystal Oasis can be gathered by each character a day.
---
The ones in Dry Top are once per account each day.
---
One character running to the three nodes in Crystal Oasis gives 16 quartz, so just do it with two characters for the daily limit and you're fine.
---
I actually wish changes were a bit more extreme to prevent the boredom of the same rotation. I know that sucks for getting gear, and can be a pain for those who crunch dps numbers, but I like when the meta has a fresh feel to it.
---
Try that path on a griffon. Record it and show the difference. You can't stay at the same altitude long enough on a griffon to reach all of the magic spawns. 
---
Plus a skyscale isn't a griffon so it's like saying springer is better than raptor...
---
Silverwastes would like a word!
---
No survivability, it has way better survivability than any current meta frontline build aside from FB and Scrapper. You have 3 dodges with the Endurance Regen increased by 40% food, your Staff 5 is an iFrame and it's AoE is pretty big for a Melee frontliner that it hits just as hard as Herald Hammer 2, the DD Staff 5 also lets you move in aggressively while avoid everything. You do damage while trying not to die unlike the other builds, your defensives are your 15k critting machines in an unorganized group.
---
Have you tried DD Staff in Zergs? If your situational awareness is good and you know where to stand at all times then you are an unkillable god on DD. You have very few things that can kill you unless you yourself mess up and mismanage your endurance and initiative. As you're iFraming and Dodging you're doing ridiculously high burst damage than can take out people in droves. You have the capability of easily and quickly hopping ahead of your Commander and taking out the delicious squishy backline while still having the endurance and initiative to hoppity hop right back to your commander and buff bots. You don't ever switch to a ranged weapon unless you need a slightly longer distance dash after your team wipes or to pepper walls/bridges.
---
You don't use Staff 2 for damage in Zergs unless you land on their backline, you use your 5 to do damage while avoiding nearly everything. Every once in a while you use your disengage to get out of the CC it clears.

Charr civil war. Rumors or a Blood Legion Warlord causing trouble in the Blood Legion homelands leads us to investigate. We learn this warlord believes himself the true Khan-Ur and cuts down any who disagree. Obviously this warlord is not a fan of the charr-human peace treaty that the story has forgotten for too long. We push back against him but this warlord continues to grow in power regardless.
---
Yadda-yadda we fight more and Rox leads the Olmakhan to work with the Black Citadel. Black Citadel charr come to respect Rox and she rightfully earns the Claw of the Khan-Ur. With the remaining char united under Rox she leads a final assault to take down the warlord.
---
In a cinematic and surprise twist the warlord tries to run after Rox's forces take his fort. As he tries to escape he gets cut down by his own soldiers for showing such weakness. The a good amount of the Warlord's forces pledge themselves to the true Khan-Ur and rejoin the Black Citadel. Pockets of Blood Legion still resist the the conflict for the most part ends with the Charr more united and powerful than ever.

Do raids with meme builds just for the fun of it. Start a meme build only group in lfg. Clear VG with condi scrappers and power core rangers.

---
Unlike what some people are saying you can start raiding now. Just got to snowcrows.com and copy a build from there and practice your rotation on the golem. If you can't get the right Stat combo just use the closest alternative in exotics. 
---
Then go to the community section of their website and join a training guild. While you raid train you'll get tokens and drops to get an ascended set of gear fairly quickly. I'd avoid joining regular pugs until you've trained however. Checking out boss guides in between will help to speed things up. 
---
I'd also recommend getting Arc DPS addon for build templates and monitoring your DPS. TACO is also a great addon for boss timers.

I think the problem/ difficulty with raids is more about getting into a group to do them than actually doing them honestly. To me they feel like slightly harder fractals, they're so hyped up but they're nothing special really. I don't get why the small community that does raids do the most to gatekeep new players from doing them. Perhaps to charge them gold/ mystic coins like they do/ have done for a long time now? Probably but who knows.
---
It bugs me the Skyscale collections refer to it as "Drytop". It's two words, not one! 
---
Plus I think it makes very little sense as one word. Who names a place "Drytop" with no space?!
---
Assuming this is the south side of Dragonfall, I'd say Cantha, because we'll probably never end up getting there.
---

I think part of it is that in Guild Wars [1] it actually was "Drytop" but in Guild Wars 2 it is Dry Top.

Path of fire. I absolutely HATE the HoT maps. Awful. Plus mounts are a game changer.
---
Meh, I get why you're upset, but its like a week right?  Find something else to do for a week then keep playing.  You stated in the OP "rip gems", "rip skyscale" etc.  Like, I get it's a mistake, but it was a slur and you got banned for a week.  Even though it was unintentional, ANET doesn't know that and it's a one week ban, get over it.
---
Just join a guild that fits your needs. You absolutely don't need to run the same cookie cutter builds out there to do even the hardest content. Only if you want to complete them as fast as possible
---
Personally, I find I can't get good grinding on the golem, I have to play in the open world. 
---
If you want to get good at a build or class and are anything like me, just go out in to PvE, do some meta events or world bosses, and just get a feel for the class and rotation. If you know what the rotation should look like, what skill synergies there are and how they should be pulled off, then you'll get there in the end with practice. You can then used the golem to benchmark how you are improving. 
---
I'd also recommend dungeons. They're pretty easy at this point, but the practice is useful, as is the financial reward. 
---
And playing open world stuff is far more interesting than grinding on the golem.
---
doing dailies for dragonfall actually give you 5 per daily completed.
---
Treasure hunts in Dessert Highlands. Best if you gather a squad and do it like a SW chest train
---
My Trash is your Treasure or your trash is my treasure.

It's one week minimum right now. Aaaand then some more if you don't have ls4 map currencies and/or charged quartz crystals, but they will address some of the timegating issues in tomorrow's patch.
---
Don't worry about builds while leveling; just pick what looks fun/good, early game starts very easy. You're meant to try out different things while leveling. Maybe glance through some of the PvE/open world builds on Metabattle if you want an idea of what skills, stat combos, and weapons are popular, but having a meta build before Lv. 80 is absolutely not expected of or realistic for anybody.

The Mists... with all the disruption that Kralk and the planet of Tyria has caused. Basically tearing holes in reality, leaking massive amounts of magic everywhere and ripping chunks of the mists out of the mists. Id like to see a threat come from the mists. Then we have to attack it head on in the mists.
---
This could be a tie in to the Six leaving. Remember Humans are basically refugees from another world. The Six sheeparded humanity through the mists. But what or who destroyed the humans home world? What or who was powerful or catastrophic enough to even make Gods flee? I would love for this to be explored, how the gods became gods. Make a invasion, a race from the mists find Tyria.

Rifle deadeye is exceedingly OP for open world content. This is my open world build:
---
http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQFAEnsMhNGDGOBUGjFaCj/XmMfmaBgJUEYLPNcqQA-e
---
It varied from meta build a bit since it's optimized for normal mobs.
---
Rotation (vs many mobs in range):
---
5 &gt; F1 &gt; F2 &gt; 3
---
Some mobs are a bit more resilient and you may need an extra auto attack.
---
Rotation (vs singled out mobs)
---
F1 &gt; F2 &gt; spam 3 (while standing).
---
This spends more initiative and it's not sustainable. For grinding this way (not good against some sturdier mobs) replace Deadly Arts for Trickery (down, and  whatever you fancy on the other 2).
---
Rotation (vs vets)
---
Kneel &gt; F1 &gt; 3 &gt; 3 &gt; F2 (this will stealth you) &gt; 1 (deaths judgement).
---
This should kill most vets. If the thing is still alive just do spam 3 and stealth attack when you have 4+ Malice.
---
Pro tips: 
---
Kneeling 2 instead of 3 inmobs, use to avoid vets reaching you if needed. Spam this instead of 3 if you need to break a bar.
---
Kneeling 4 has a barrier against proyectiles.
---
Standing 4 shadowsteps back, it's super nice to gain some distance.

Gear: if you wear exotics, any combo of berserker/Assassin's/marauder is fine. For ascended go full berserkers since it's all you will ever need (it's better).

In story logic this means that there will always be as many knock-offs as the plot requires to progress. By making the functionally infinite number of knock-off spears roughly as effective as the original spear, it removes all consequences of the forge being destroyed.
---
It's not important for the story going forward given that Kralk's dead and all, but it still really rubs me the wrong way. The two consequences of our failure in episode 5 were Aurene being killed and the forge being destroyed. Those were both completely nullified in episode 6. Aurene wasn't even *weakened*, she came back STRONGER than before. And we now have as many dragonblood spears as we would ever need for the plot to move forward. Why did episode 5 even happen?
---
Dragonflight sounds awesome tbh
---
Looks like the dragons are transformed by their own magic as they are corrupted by it.
---
Zhaitan looks very different in his final form than in the cinematics. He looked more like a classical dragon in those. 
---
This could be seen merely as a change of style between artwork and the model redesign before release, but I like to think that after we sank his ships, killed his eyes and mounths, and cut his supply of magic artifacts and the magic of the artesian waters, he was so hungry and consumed by his own magic that his body ended up decaying, and he had to patch himself with body parts and magic by gobbling up several of his risen dragon minions, turning him into the dragon composite we meet in Arah.
---
As far as we know Mordremoth's original body was like a pan lung or t'ien lung dragon, and the 'plant' magic within him made it grow vines that spread all over.
---
Primordus also had a considerable change, from a more slim dragon to having a huge lower jaw. We can't see more of his body, and there's many differences between models in GW1 and equivalent modes in GW2, but he is clearly larger and his head is clearly different. 
---
Kralkatorrik also looks more rocky and crystalline than what we can see of his body in GW1.
---
Judging by Sons of Svanir totems and emblems, Jormag could be something like a legless winged wyrm. What some call an "Amphiptere".
---
We can only speculate about 'S'. I would not be surpised if 'S' had turned into something kind of like a jellyfish, or even if she became virtually invisible while underwater because having the same refractive index as water. That would certainly make sure nobody ever sees 'S', keeping the mystery, and it'd also go with the rumors about tentacled horrors made out of water. 
---
So at the very least the shape of dragons can greatly vary, and there's problably an original race to which they all belong to.
---
Together you'll be able to successfully do more group content like dungeons and group events while gaining levels. Technically that's extra rewards?

It's kind of funny, this feels like the end of PoF.
---
Like, HoT continued LS2 but the end of HoT felt like the end of HoT. And LS3 was this weird chasing prequel to Path of Fire. LS4 has felt like the actual remainder of the PoF campaign, like now we're done the story. I'm not sure which version I like better, but LS4 has definitely been more memorable than LS3.

Enough with collections Anet, please, they are beyond boring. I'd rather do the dishes AND laundry than having to unlock ANOTHER sub collection to get a mount, A MOUNT. Want to do more end game content? Enough with raids and stupid time gated collections, something long doesnt mean its hard, it just means its boring and you are limiting players, giving them an idea of accomplishment and or difficulty,  just give people World Bosses that actually require strategy and have Raid type of difficulty.
---
You have THE best combat mechanic on the market, and you've managed to ruin PVP, you wanna have a go at PVE as well?
---
What's wrong with them?
---
It’s kinda of the fact the entire time we’ve been looking for beings to replace the elder dragons she isn’t brought up. The Aurene shows up and everyone’s like “hey, aurene is the granddaughter to kralkatorrik. We should totally just replace kralk with aurene.” It’s like they forgot that the Pale tree is basically the daughter to Mordremoth and was able resist his influence until he send a champion to attack her and even then he couldn’t corrupt her.
---
Dragon's Ascent?
---
I don't see the video. Is that a new reddit thing?

where is the precursor ring?
---
the B abd N key are right bext to each other, i might give you the nenefit of doubt here
---
Except that dragons stand actually had a nice climactic fight with the dragon whereas in dragonfall you pop kralks pimples.
---
As much as I love the dragon stories, I want to chill with that on the sidelines for a bit. I'd love to see more Zojja or Rytlock-oriented stories, as well as some sylvari stuff (I don't think we've seen anything from the pale tree at all since s2, so it'd be nice to get some closure on that arc). I'm also interested in where they were going with that desmina arc. She's ruler of the underworld now-and what about the rest of the gods' realms? Will we learn what the deal between Lyssa and Balthazhar was? Also if the theme of the story is going to be 'Dragons aren't fundamentally evil, their enormous power has corrupted them and they're suffering,' then we might see more stories about the dragons where we don't have to fight or kill them.

Dragonfloat
---
With more people many events spawn more mobs which means you can complete hearts faster and get more XP.
---
Some events are also designed for a group and you can take on champion mobs.
---
If you're in a party and everyone is participating in an event you are more likely to get Gold-level Participation instead of Bronze or Silver, which have slightly lower rewards.
---
For most events this isn't a problem, but there are a few where it can make a difference.
---
Haha indeed
---
If you do dungeons, everybody gets his reward at the end, no matter if he just joined, did nothing or anything else. I think that's an advantage, if someone have to go afk for whatever reason. 
---
For open world, you basically have to do a certain amount of dmg to a mob to get exp/loot. If you play in a group, this amount is lower for each player. It helps alot when you run with a big zerg.
---
There are a few benefits to playing in a party. For one, you have to get less hits in to "tag" an enemy for xp and drops for when it dies (you usually don't need more than a hit or two even when not in a party, unless it's something big like a world boss, but even that doesn't require much more). You also get party chat and the ability to enter instances (story missions, home instances, etc.) as a group. Plus you can point out things to the party, like targeting enemies with CTRL+T, as well as marking points, pinging, and making drawings on the map. You'll also usually be placed in the same instance of a map (unless the map is full) as party members, friends, and guildmates, and can join map instances your party members are in by right clicking their name and clicking "join in X." And of course you'll have more help to kill enemies and complete tasks and events quicker. 
---
Making a guild is also a very good idea. You get a shared bank, guild chat, and extra bonuses that you can upgrade. You can also get a guild hall if someone has an expansion, although the zones (the first and second areas in HoT each have a hall as does the fifth area in PoF) you have to go through to get it are level 80. Finally, you can take part in guild missions, which reward loot, gold, xp, and guild commendations, which are a currency that can be exchanged for different things at the guild commendation vendors, including ascended items.
---
weird I put the youtube link there but its not embedding. I thought reddit auto embedded just with a simple link?
---
I would also love some cross expansion masteries.  Mounting in combat would be amazing, but I think Anet wants to force us to fight boring trash mobs that tag us for some reason.
---
where are you shopping link me can see prebuilds and see if there is any good one
---
The old reddit needs a "link post", no idea about the new reddit.

Took a long break after that incident
---
Traveling all over Tyria finding new dragons/creatures and collecting them like Pokemon to store magic sounds like a fantastic idea, not gonna lie. So many possibilities and lands to explore.
---
This must be one of the most convoluted/long/ridiculous process I've ever seen in this game. By comparison, griffon is a walk in the park - might just stick with him.

So a few weeks ago I bought a Catmander tag. I had the regular Commander tag before that for ages + think the default was the Green triangle.

Isn't Dragonflight the name of the instance when you fly on Aurene?
---
&gt; The remaining adds from canon defense phase before she spawns should disappear when she does. Why start with a handicap we can undo with a /gg reset ?
---
That one I find to be the silliest. Either don't remove them ever or do it automatically
---
&gt; I agree with those two points and I’d add a third: Stability should cancel that wind gust knocking you out of the boat. With these 3 changes, it’d be a really good fractal imo.
---
More generally CC that bypass stability shouldn't exist ... but ANet is sloppy so this will never get a general fixed

---
Debatable. There is enough stuff to do (and thus group around) outside of story, things both instanced and open-world, and story is indeed regarded by many to be mediocre compared to proper single-player games. It's just that story is the best thing to discuss on places like reddit.
---
The only story i enjoyed was the vanilla, that feeling at the last instance when the fear not this night starts playing is gave me chills, I've played all of the hot story, this I didnt enjoy as much and the pof story just feel long and a waste of time in my opinion I would really want to story like it.
---
Yeah, I have to press faster than I was pressing, just found out. Thanks!
---
What makes you think that everybody likes it? I think it's garbage since they introduced Scarlet and that it has improved a bit as of late but it's still bad, and nobody is gonna change my mind. If you don' t like it,  you don't like, period.
---
I'm skyscale farming too... The struggle is real.
---
Here's [good guide for playing the story in order](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8wq6aj/play_gw2_in_story_order_guide/), including extra short stories, videos, and other lore.
---
I don't think I'd be interested in any movie that I skipped half of, so maybe make a cup of tea and/or some popcorn and settle in.
---
Also, over half of Tyria's lore - including some of the best stories - takes place in the open world.  Pay attention to events, read text, and follow NPCs to really immerse yourself.
---
People already skip the content (which isn't very rewarding) with parked mesmers waiting to skip players through the JPs. I'm all for opening jps up and being less restrictive with mount movement. It's kinda apparent the majority of players just want to do the content once or just be ported and be done with it.
---
Funny thing is Morgan's spiral still has a couple close by areas where you can still use mounts bypassing the JP.
---
There's an area in Lion's Arch on the East side that has a ridiculous range for disabling mounts...yet you can still get to the end JP with mounts.
---
Instead of restricting mount movement I'd much rather JPs be tied to the Adventure system where the end chest only becomes active (or has better rewards) once you hit the start button. Could have a leaderboard system and disable powers and a reset button like other adventures do.
---
that wasn't reallt the answer I was hoping for -_-
---
For me, S4 feels like the end of the plot that began with S2. S2+HoT felt like "act 1" while S3+Pof was "act 2", and Season 4 was "act 3" of the story.
---
Probably feel this way since we haven't had an ending without ominous doom on the horizing since the PS, and Aurene's plot began in Season 2.
---
the next season is most likely gonna be a buildup for the next expansion, that's my two cents
---
Not in the way were you make hearts faster or that you can kill for others and they gain xp or you go to higher levels and they gain more xp, in fact they gain less when they try to do that. 
---
All hearts are personal and everybody have to do their thing. But with a group you can take on champions very easy, do story dungeons and normal dungeons without having to look for pugs, later on same with fractals. A guild is not a bad thing. If you own the HoT or PoF expac you can take a guild hall and start upgrade that together. It is a long term project for a guild and you can also do weekly guild missions.
---
Shhh, quiet down with that or they'll make the mats to make the next meta build JP exclusive
---
&gt; While a gift is not a loan that doesn't mean it's okay to stop being grateful for it and forget who gave you what/ who was there in the beginning for you.
---
That would be the ethical thing to do from the perspective of a person receiving a gift.
---
What I was saying is for the perspective of a person giving gifts. If you can't bring yourself to give gifts without expecting the other person to reciprocate in some way then just don't it. It would only set yourself up for regrets down the line.
---
thanks I hate it
---
Imo it was worth it.
---
It took me one day of farming hearts to earn All currencies.
---
The feeling of having a dragon like Mount is awesome. Beeing able to fly straight 'unlimited' even way more.
---
But in fact only worth it if you get all your mounts.
---
Just dont rush yourself if you are not into grinding.
---
You can get stuff from home instance, daily vendor and do some hearts. This will bring you to 250 of each within not to much time without grind.
---
But as mentioned. You can finish the farm within one day of Hard grind. Since you have a time gate spread it over a few days and its pretty relaxed.
---
In the end you have to decide yourself.
---
I would have gone for it even for 500 currency or more and a month of time gate.
---
I’m in a similar boat of more money than time. If you haven’t finished the stories, I’d pick up all of the seasons (2-4), and finish the stories in order. This is great bite sized content that will keep you busy for a long while. You can finish the first mission of PoF, then unlock everything up to the Jackal, without spoiling the story. While getting mounts, you can play the earlier stories, and work your way towards the newer content, unlocking masteries along the way. You’ll get some decent gear as you make your way through (definitely get the free ascended weapon after HoT), and S3 offers opportunities to farm ascended accessories. By the time you finish the story, you should be geared enough to run fractals, play WvW, and start on a legendary.

The I3 is fine, but a 8350k would make more sense for GW2, its needs a good CPU.

Hmm ... Stand -&gt; Fall -&gt; ... I think the correct action here would be Roll.

Mmm Dragon Roll .. didn't they say there were changes coming for Chef? We'll also need some fish for the sushi and sashimi which synergize well with the undersea dragon and more underwater content
---
Sounds awesome :)
---
Oh wow those prices are really bad. So i'd say get "complete gamer a35" if those are your only options. And later you can just upgrade your cpu to something better and that pc will be good for a long while for gw2 and other games. Assuming you play on 1080p 60fps.

---
I've had similar thoughts to Kossage's for a while now, and the more time goes on, the more threads planted in the game are found that could tie into it as he's shown.
---
But all the while, I've seen that such a plot needs to be paired with a separate, more distant plot. I think that if they do go the "charr civil war" route for Season 5, pairing it with "replacements for Z and M" would be a good move, similar to how Season 3 paired the White Mantle plot with "Primordus and Jormag both become active".
---
One of the subplots for the replacements storyline could involve, and finally settle, Malyck's story. Last year around April, we were told that Matthew Medina was drafting a story for Malyck. At the same time, ArenaNet had finished drafting the end of Season 4 and was in beginning devleopment of the final three episodes. Matthew unfortunately was among those laid off earlier this year, but he had a full year to develop that Malyck storyline and work it into future content. If others took it up, we could see Malyck returning either as part of Season 5, the raid after the upcoming wing 7, or an upcoming Side Stories. Season 5 seems most likely.
---
I'm also not really sure they could - or should - scrunch an entire charr civil war into two episodes. I'd say three are needed: First to set it up (perfect for a Foefire cleansing-focused episode with minor foreshadowing). The second would see the conflict begin and escalate (if we go the assassination route, then it could begin with an attempt on Smodur's life, succeed or fail, and focus on tracking down the assassin, discovering who it was, ultimately ending with a full out breach of conflict), and the third episode dealing the death blow (fighting out way to the enemy and killing Bangar at the very end).
---
Since that's only half a season (if they keep up the 6 episode rate), we could get sidetracked after the first of those three with the replacement plot, coming back to it for two back-to-back episodes, before returning to the other plot. Or Episode 1 could be beginning the replacement plot, Ep2 is Foefire cleansing, Ep3 is replacement plot part 2, Ep4-5 is the charr conflict, then finally Ep6 ends the replacement plot, and seeds us into the next expansion.

Weren't most of the layoffs people who were working on unannounced non-GW2 projects that now (presumably) got cancelled? I get that some GW2-devs ended up leaving voluntarily so other devs could keep their job, but has it actually been confirmed that GW2 is being majorly affected (outside of the tumultuous period of the company reorganizing after the layoffs)?
---
I for one would have been ticked at a spider-bat mount over a dragon.  A dragon is exactly what I have wanted.  If they had made it not quadrupedal and winged it also would not have been a dragon.
---
Thank you!
---
Dyes would be enough for mounts if the base skins were more than a single channel. Half the reason for getting a skin is to get those three extra channels tbh.
---
They're locked behind an expansion
---
Go right into HoT and give it a shot then. Also, take the advice you get here with a grain of salt. The people here LOVE the story bullshit, it's seriously like garbage junk food to them. They have a hard time comprehending that someone could dislike the story, and they assume people who do dislike it are just trolls. Look at how my comment is already downvoted.
---
&gt;...it's weird we don't get a basic sky mount along the lines of the first 4 you get for 'free'?
---
Nope its not weird at all.
---
The first 4 mounts are all that is needed to fully traverse any map since PoF release. The griffon, beetle and skyscale are there for flavour and speed. Now if maps were released with important sections of the map only accessible by griffon or skyscale there would be more reason to have a flying mount for "free".
---
There should be a song "Dragonstand unshaken, amidst a clash of woooorlds" with a coughing dragon galopping through a swamp.
---
Yes rather than fix the problems we should delete them. 
---
That will work out.
---
But it's not a huge loss at all. Before the patch it was 7% increased damage to enemies in range, and only 10% damage increase enemies with Staff Master if endurance was not full. 17% increased damage.
---
In addition, the change to Weakening Strikes means DDs now do 7% more damage to enemies with Weakness. And because of Weakening Charge - the skill we have to spam weakness - they almost always will have weakness.  On average you'll probably have two bars not full, so you'll have 17%. With no endurance bars full, you'll have 22% increased damage. 
---
Daredevil did not lose, it *gained*. The damage modifiers got swapped around between traits and if anything, played well, Daredevil is even stronger now.

Tl;DR, OP has a version from the ancient, long gone days of a [PvP Locker](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/PvP_Locker), which was basically a PvP-only version of the wardrobe that existed before the wardrobe did. The locker was basically another material storage - minis had similar setup.

The OP's skin **should** have converted to a wardrobe skin, but for whatever reason, didn't.

Well we found out that they banned players based on [hashes of running programs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8c2j0y/a_technical_analysis_of_the_spyware_arena_used/)  And about 3 months ago we learned that some of the accounts were falsely banned for [the empty string/file hash](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/).

If you think your case falls under this then I'd recommend you either escalate your past ticket or open one if it's not applicable and inquire about it.

I don't think a balance shift has ever made me need new equipment. Balance in gw2 isn't meant to invalidate the existing options, just to make other options viable as well.

You should probably level up your current / first character to level 80 and then make a new one and start the story over from the beginning. Maybe try to create a self-insert, a character that feels most like you, and try to watch all the cutscenes. The personal story, unfortunately, aged poorly IMO. But I still find it enjoyable if I care about my character and make a simple backstory for them
---
Dungeons also give insane amounts of exp
---
For me, Mordremoth takes the crown by far. His design, the way his influence was described, the sudden weakness of the Sylvari, and GOD the Mordrem!! Mordrem are honestly so cool, and they kinda feel like an extension of the Nightmare Court in a much... wilder(?) way. I really really wish we got some extension on the Mordrem generals in DS, specifically about who they were before they became corrupted. Really, NONE of the corrupted Sylvari were ever really elaborated on in terms of backstory, minus Scarlet and that one guy that tried to kill the Master of Peace is LS2 (Aerin??), but even then they didn't REALLY become Mordrem as we know them. Not to mention the fact that no one we were familiar with was corrupted (minus Trahearne, but he doesn't come up until the very end), so it wasn't particularly heartbreaking that Sylvari could suddenly turn against their teammates (though I do love the portions of the story where, if running a Sylvari commander, you have moments where you are overwhelmed by Mordremoth's voice, ESPECIALLY the one incident where you black out while your team is ahead of you and a Mordrem actually TALKS to you and makes you think you killed your friends for a hot second. Probably my favorite moment in the whole story- it shows that the commander really isn't a brick wall unfazed by all these challenges.) 
---
The writing team definitely missed an opportunity to make the 3 commanders in DS emotional and bitter- something about them that really makes them ALIVE rather than cardboard cutouts. Maybe someone in the Pact could mention how they knew one of the generals? Maybe we could chat with them about who they were before Mordremoth? It's nitpicky, I know, but BOY am I thirsty for the little bits of lore that don't mean much in the long run, but make the world breathe more. And I gotta say, good on the writers for HoT, because they DEFINITELY made the world breathe there, despite some letdowns in the plot. I cried more than once during the duration of it, and I absolutely SOBBED at the end of it- and maybe it's just me being a sucker for GW2 in general, but HoT was a HUGE improvement on LS2 and the personal story.   
---
Also, I do wish that we'd get something on what happens to a dragon's minions after said dragon is killed. Like with Joko- we got a really strong view of what happened to Awakened after he died, which I am ENDLESSLY grateful for. They are free-willed once more, but lost as well without the guidance of the one who essentially used to own them. As far as I know, we never get a look into what happens to dragon minions after their master's death. Risen? Mordrem? Hell, Branded? On that note, what about the Forged? I really really wish we got more on that, because HOLY SHIT wouldn't it be cool to have dragon minion allies!?! Mordrem tending to Sylvari, Risen helping out the Awakened, Forged going through the same struggle as the Awakened, Branded taking Aurene as a new master, I don't know. Even an answer as simple as "they die after their master dies" or "they become mindless husks with no directive" would be satisfying enough. 
---
Anyway, I REALLY need to shut up because I will absolutely ramble on all day about how cool the dragons are and the complexity of everything that surrounds them because GODDAMN do I feel like a kid in a candy store with all this lore we're getting.

Propably one or two weeks after the start of the next bonus event week.
---
1) Mesmer. So much confusion
---
2) Each race gets special racial skills, but outside of role play reasons they are pretty much never used
---
The musical cues in that original story were pretty good. I suspect that you wouldn't be so fond of that story without that music for the ending though. The new stuff has a couple musical elements that are good (choral bits in war eternal are awesome) but lyric-less and therefore, forgettable. As for PoF it really does feel like filler thanks to recent events. It has some very cool moments worth seeing but you're not going to feel the build up if you skip scenes. Best you can do is give it an earnest shot. Watch the cutscenes, use the in game music, pay attention. If that doesn't work for you it's just not your jam, and that's ok
---
Kidney ssttooooonesss reverence?
---
Oh no. You actually have to play the game to get something good. What a shit company Anet turned into. Where are the times where you logged in and recieve a 100% unlocked game. I mean come on. I pay full price, so why am I getting locked out of content?
---
I have no memory of torment but it sounds like another thing I've be interested in! Looks like I'm rolling up a Mesmer in my first journey in ages &lt;3
---
thanks!
---
... try not skipping it then?
---
Confusion cause damage each second and more on skill activation, and torment cause damage over time and more while moving.
---
Mesmer has good access to both, I think necromancer has good access to torment but I haven't played condi necro in a while :)
---
Torment was added later (June 2013)
---
That doesn't seem any better based on https://api.guildwars2.com/v2/items?ids=38474&amp;lang=en
---
Still only usable in PvP/PvP Lobby
---
&gt; The OP's item should have converted to a wardrobe skin
---
it did, the skin is unlocked
---
I wanna get in on that deep sea dragon lore pretty bad, but I am opposed to anything to do with Cantha. People always suggest the two together for some reason, but I really hope that's not on the horizon.
---
We have spent far too long retreading GW1 grounds, and the only thing that is exciting me at this point is the prospect of stuff that is absolutely new to us. Totally uncharted territory, regardless of where it is... I'm stoked.
---
Let's take a break from reliving the old for a little while.
---
Get a guild and some people to play with. It's the whole point and a necessarity to enjoy guild wars 2. It's a nightmare to rely on lfg'ing and "pugging" in this game. The abysmal LFG options are often not very friendly for trying to enjoy this game just with randoms.
---
I've been suggesting a rework or features for/of the LFG since we got it way back.
---
It's just you.
---
But if you want a minimalist look you can just hide the gloves?
---
Afaik, consuming mistborn motes and using the volatile magic for trophy shipments nets you the rest of the gold you feel like you're missing.
---
I’d love to see what the Tengu are hiding in the Dominion of Winds.
---
Cantha.
---
Maby just maby coz not everything is written and ppls need to watch and learn mechanics. Not just read up on stuff to do it. Thats actually what makes a game like this interresting.
---
Plot tied up? Pfffhhh!! Theres still one more dragon out there... Bubbles... Were going to cantha!
---
Jokes aside, cantha is the logical next step for the game (expansion wise) Season 5 will likely be a sidestory/wrap up of everything's that has happened starting likey in either elona or ascalon with aurine mending kralk's brand. Afterwards we check in with each main character before getting an invite to steve's pary through an assassin or disaster. Aurene will be too busy cleaning up kralk's mess to worry and it will be our job to go to cantha. Cantha's ministry will say "no we got steve under contol" and we'll park the pact fleet's airships off the coast showing that isolation has made them technology stagnant and they'll open trade again just in time for exp3.
---
Nah, converted as in literally converted into, not just unlocked something else. The old PvP items get auto-consumed, I guess you can say.
---
The green circle mechanic is obvious one you get hit once and read the text under her name.
---
ANet's general idea for mechanics is that red/orange=bad and green=good, so when you see a green mechanic, you should stand in it to succeed the encounter. It mostly plays out in raids on encounters such as Vale Guardian and Dhuum, though it's present in some open world situations. For example, the Unbound Guardian in Bloodstone Fen spawns a green circle; if players stand in it and use their special action key when it goes off, it gives them a temporary damage buff. There's also a green mechanic on Arkk in Shattered Observatory CM.
---
The green shark circle in Siren's Reef is technically unique though in that it shares damage. The other green mechanics usually just need one or more people inside them to 'succeed.'
---
Thanks. Didnt know she was a normal thing
---
They would have begun development on Season 5 back in last November or so, a few weeks after A Star to Guide Us launched. Drafting its plot would have happened before then, closer to when Season 5 was announced. So Episode 1 should be mostly done (over halfway at least) by now, so it'd be weird for them to suddenly cancel.
---
Especially given the whole layoff situation as said.
---
Thread removed: Do not use this subreddit to try and contact the customer support.
---
See full rules [[here]](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/rules)
---
Said spyware was removed from the game after that incident.
---
How can our Toymaker's Bags be real if our eyes aren't real?
---
That's why I gave it such a long recharge in the example. It'll help getting out of a pinch, but if you use it fribolously and get dismounted, you will have to fight again. At least for another 4 mins. Killing the enemies will often be faster.
---
I would like to see the story go underwater - not necessarily to deal with the underwater dragon, but to get an underwater mount that will make submarine travel less.. well.. slow and kind of bad.
---
Like I said in the beginning, ArenaNet canceled those projects because NCSoft forced them to, in order to make ArenaNet focus on GW2 alone, because they wanted profits now and games in development don't produce immediate profits. ArenaNet wasn't the only one who suffered this.
---
As it currently stands, in this quarter of the year, ArenaNet would have to cut ties with NCSoft to cease development of GW2 and make Season 4 the finale of the game.
---
Turns out Dragonflight already exists. It's the one in which you do you know what with you know who while chasing you know who.
---
Dragon’s Grief would be a good one.
---
With a timegated collection to raise these Scions, involving collecting 1000 of every currency in the game.
---
I dont think it will, they want people playing more than anything else and it seems ectos have stabilized around 14-15g for the past 5+ days
---
Am i ok with Aurene being resurrected? Yes
---
Am i ok with how soon it happened? Nah.
---
They could've at least had a story step or two where you discover a way to resurrect her, but you literally just walk into the first instance and within 2 minutes she is back. 
---
A lot of people are upset with her being resurrected in the first place though. I'm fine with this. I've seen this a lot in storys in games i play in he past 10 years. I call it 'Game of Thrones' syndrome. GoT syndrome is when you insist every story must follow the game of throws formula - if someone makes a dumb mistake, they pay for it. If someone is in a life or death scenario, they die. This works now and then, but it can't be applied to every single story, which a lot of people seem to want to be the case since Game of Thrones blew up.
---
Imagine for instance Pokemon, the very first episode Ash and Pikachu are rushed by like 100 of those bird pokemon. If that was released today, there'd be people saying that Ash and Pikachu should die because if they don't "ITS UNREALISTIC."
---
Listen, theres more than one way to tell a realistic story. It is okay to resurrect a dragon that is infused with god energy and lich energy.
---
Just did them 2 days ago, they are still working with a bunch of people running through them. You might want to look at [Dulfy's guide](http://dulfy.net/2019/04/09/gw2-helpful-hero-current-events-and-riftstalker-weapons-guide/) for pictures of the locations instead of just markers on the [wiki](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Catch_Brand_crystals_and_use_them_to_disrupt_the_rift).
---
Mist warden quartermaster after you do his unlock achievement or literally any of the other volatile magic vendors.
---
Charr would get vehicles into space first. Asura would get vehicles into space that actually keep breathable air in them and survive re-entry.
---
I picked this up in Divinity's Reach and there were like 4 people on Springers jumping into the air then killing themselves. Took me like 20 seconds to finish it all.
---
That's not a 2k gem store. That looks like a 1200 gem select licence skin.
---
It would be nice if Aurene visit the pale tree and give her Mordremoth and Zhaitan power (half of Balthazar's power too, so both can use mist portal), meanwhile Aurene keep Kralkatorrik and Joko power.
---
Why should we go bother Steve when he/she/it/ramen noodles hasn't been making any waves?
---
Its completely unknown, any rough estimates are speculation. All we know is its apparently before the next LS release, which if they're still doing their normal release cadence, 3 - 3 1/2 months after this last episode's release.
---
Wants something fresh, but wants to go to GW1 places - literally the antithesis of "fresh".
---
What's wrong with cantha and china?
---
Or you just work around it and pay attention to your placement and the rest of your team, like in any other fractal with that instability.
---
TIL the spore creature creator is pretty rad. Nice work!
---
timegate is being nerfed from 24 hours to 2 hours.
---
there's no "must obtain by [date here] or *else*" clause to the skyscale or the griffin. only the "must have PoF/LWS4 to obtain" clause, which is reasonable.
---
this isn't the Chinese client where you can (apparently) buy legendaries from the gem store. put in the time, feel proud of your investment.
---
what class are you using? 
---
Could you input what build you're using [here](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/) so we can take a look?
---
Also, how are you playing? Are you using your dodges correctly? Is your gear up to par?
---
Welp, now that's going to be patched.
---
It's about to go *much* higher.
---
&gt; I'm just showing another option.
---
More like
---
"I'm just showing ANet where to make their next set of invisible wall adjustments."
---
Dragon Beach:  We trick Bubbles on to the shore and he/she dries out and dies.
---
Spellbreaker to be specific. Berserker has none of this (lol).
---
What are stolen items exactly? Hacking someone's account and giving away their stuff?
---
you know that people routinely check everything inch of any given patch nowadays? just because it doesn't make GW2 headlines doesn't mean that people aren't watching for anything weird/unnecessary/suspicious.
---
The core is fine, but the crystals are too much imo.
---
Git
---
Gud
---
If you're looking for a tanky melee power PvP spec, Scrapper is all of the above + crazy CC.
---
Which pants are you refering to specifically? Like do they actually exist or were you joking?
---
Deadeye isn't bad, but there's no reason to play it over broken-ass-hell Sic Em' Soulbeast.
---
Deadeye is just a direct downgrade in comparison since Soulbeast does everything the Deadeye does but better.
---
that doesn't change the fact that Anet banned legitimate players simply because they weren't batting
---
Some tips
---
PvE in GW2 is a bit different than on other games. Active defences are overall better than passive ones. What I mean by active is things such as dodges, blocks, blinds etc while passive is stats such as toughness and vitality.
---
Because of this, gear wise is better to spec full damage allways (unless you are playing support builds, but those pretty much only for organized content, open world you go full chad full berserker). Kill things before they kill you
---
Now a build is not only made by the gear, the traits and specs you use are very important and those can help you survive even with full damage gear. Now I can't really help you with Ranger because that is one of the few classes I never got interested in so Idk about it, but what I told you applys to any class.
---
As to where get gear, the 1st set of exotics is easy. I would recomend dungeons. Its fairly easy content and the dungeons that give you Berserker stats are still run nowadays (depending on the hour I guess). I recomend dungeons because they will also give you nice amount of gold while you farm them for the gear. There are also collections related to them that give you ascended trinkets, but those you can do on the long term and the stats the trinkets give you are not that usefull anyway (aside Assassins, there are classes that use assassins trinkets)
---
Dungeons that give you Berserer gear are Citadel of Flame and Crucible of Eternity. I think Arah also give them, but I'm not sure, and you will problably find parties faster for the other 2 anyway so I would focus on those. The maps where the dungeons are Fireheart Rise and Mount Maelstorm respectively
---
You do realize China's list of prohibited things and SJW talking points are entirely separate and don't have a lot of overlap, right?
---
Am I the only one here that's noticing the full frontal plant nudity?
---
Thats fair. I’m hoping with them having planned for S5 after 4 instead of an expansion that they have some plans for it, and with others being cancelled it means they’ve got more people actually on the game instead of spread out. It was pretty apparent in S4 that they were spread thin.
---
You have to sell everything you get if you want compare your income with the numbers of other players. Only selling / opening the gear and selling ectos is not quite the whole picture. Volatile magic, every material, unique skins. Everything.
---
And than - of cause - rotation matters. During a full map cycle you can open around 54 coffers. Without a good event / boss rotation you will run short on keys and time. The most lucrative rotations will net you with around 60-ish keys per cycle but that is something you have to work for. It will not work every single time. And in the end there is also quite a bit of luck involved how events are falling in order - not to mention players who are unexperienced or simply unwillingly to follow. So yeah it can be the most lucrative zone ingame but it is significantly more harder to pull of than istan was where you had only one given path.

I like how Jormag is more about manipulating for an ice creature. It’s always been more about whispering people into following him and is like the only one having living flesh creatures willingly following it.
---
Kinda sad to see it asleep since Jormag was the one I was most interested in seeing.
---
I'm confused. But aroused.
---
Sounds like maybe you should just... not do Siren's Reef?
---
Fun fact about the Bloodstones, their magical potency were increased using Zhaitan's magic. The Human Gods at that time didn't know they were tapping into the sleeping dragon beneath their feet.
---
You said that china tries to hide things suggesting imperial china/the mix of chinese and oriental cultures.
---
Have you ever seen ANY shadow warrior game? Its such a clusterfuck of oriental cultures not even the developers know whether or not the main character is japanese or chinese, you do realize that this fits your criteria, right?
---
gw2efficiency can tell you whether it is more worth it to craft or buy
---
In general, crafting first gen legendaries might get you some other small gizmos of note, or some interesting lore points, and it might just be interesting to do the collection
---
But other than that, the second generation legendary weapons (HoT onward) require crafting, and cannot be purchased off the trading post
---
People do pay others to craft the final step (gift of battle, gift of exploration, other minor account bound parts) for usually 400-600g. For me personally I enjoy the collections so I want to craft and complete them (and sometimes get a minor savings doing so). If you're just trying to get it for as cheap as possible you can save a little by avoiding the TP on big ticket items or craft the precursor and pay someone to finish it.
---
Well I guess this is getting fixed now. GJ OP.
---
Largely, the benefits are:
---
* People may have the gifts readily on-hand, negating the extra time cost.
---
* Personal satisfaction of having done it yourself (your mileage may vary)
---
* Being able to work on it incrementally, especially for players with chronic spending problems who might otherwise spend the gold before they save enough to buy a whole Legendary
---
* Because you want a second Gen skin that isn't tradeable
---
Sounds like you're looking for WoW. It's over there ---&gt;
---
Crafting a profitable recipe that was implemented and left in the game
---
ive tried other races but asura personal story and going with the durmand priory has been the most interesting story ive read on a mmo
---
i dont know about hot or pof tho, dont have the money to buy them.
---
Damn, I always spent my badges so I didn't have that issue :D.
---
Well I did sirens reef for the first time today, and got nuked out of nowhere and instantly downed. Wondering wtf happened, I opened the combat log and saw a shark attack hit for more than all of my health. I read the description of this crazy skill, it claimed it split damage among nearby... I ran to allies the next attempt and survived.
---
It's still stupid, but I managed to find it at least.
---
Also you actually have to play the map to get the keys, not like all the other maps where yoiu just have to play 15 min for the meta.
---
We still didn't get any Skyscale skin, so... What is the complain about?
---
Away from the dragons for the next LS season.
