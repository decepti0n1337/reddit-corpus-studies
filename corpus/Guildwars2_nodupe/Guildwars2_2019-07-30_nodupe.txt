Back when Anthem came out I was often called a White Knight or Shill purely based on being hopeful that Bioware was doing things. Not everyone is "White Knighting" they just have much more patience. There are those that do, but they're more of a hivemind.

---
Except that isnt true. Its never been 100% consistent.
---
He REPEATEDLY said he would never quit GW2 unless they turn off the servers.
---
Gold is hard to come by
---
while some people might be crying in the sub about the game dying. but really if you play the game no matter where you go you will find people there. The game has evolved from back then and there is way more lvl 80 content there than at launch so you can look forward to a bunch of content and two expansions as well as the living story seasons which are all worth to get.
---
Oh yes, I know that 10 isn’t anything compared to other games. Which makes my struggle real sad. But I’m better now!
---
This is correct.Of course, they certainly had stuff in the pipeline before the prolonged period of organizational upheaval. I’m not a fan of pooling ignorance and feeling angsty while doing it, so I’m dual-gaming it for a few weeks until we get word. 
---

---
If I’m excited, I’m just a dirty causal white night hype fool, so...
---
Run away. Run away.
---
Nice troll ;d
---
They haven't had one for seven years, what do recent layoffs have to do with anything? You people are amazing at making excuses out of thin air every time.
---
Nope. It used to be possible around the beta/game release, but they removed it for some unknown reason.
---
Someday, Pacmander will meet Snargle Gutslurper.
---
Sorry, my mistake. It's in Ebonhawke. In a house next to the vista.
---
It really is, and obnoxious to acquire as well due to the pain of grinding/farming boring, repetitive metas and the hassle of material trading, with the biggest faucets of liquid gold being high-end content, which pay out rather little.
---
Imagine being wrong on every point you make.
---
To be honest i didn't read all of it but fuck yeah the combat is just incredible. I looked into other MMO's recently and my god do they feel shit once you are used to weaving skills together in gw2. Same goes for mounts. Once you did a griffon dive through a cave into jumping off the griffon gliding into an updraft and getting back on your skyscale midair to fly on and everything of that in a matter of seconds you can absolutely not be satisfied by sitting on a clunky "movement-speed-skin" in other MMO's.
---
Yes, but current new players will be veterans too. Sooner or later. And what then?
---
Maybe someont about tomorrow's patch. Maybe they found out something in beta and are unable to fix it before patch gets released.
---
&gt;With that being said, make sure you're willing to adjust the way you play, rather than just expecting to be able to learn WvW. If you want to be able to play WvW at a decent competency, it requires you to be flexible about what and how you want to play. 
---
Laughs at scrouge/fb, tank scrapper and condi mesmer roamers
---
I think it looks like a 3 year old in a bad wig. Some people may find that cute.
---
If your might generation leaves you with 15 or fewer stacks i believe rune of strength outweighs it yes. So youd run scholar in group pve but strength for solo open world
---
The only thing stopping me from completely quitting GW2 tbh...
---
Not exactly what you are looking for, but I love hanging out on the prowl of Havoc's Heir (the airship lounge above Vigil Keep). It's very peaceful, and not a lot people are around.
---
Uh, elixirs?
---
For good Shiverpeak music, I recommend in front of Wolf(or Bear, will check and edit later) Lodge, in Hoelbrak. I have even 2 files of 2 hours of in-game music recorded there. I will edit with a screenshot of the exact place
---
And we never will
---
I want absolutely every mount skin in the gemstore, a bunch of outfits, and so many black lion skins. And I'm working on a legendary weapon (Eureka), and legendary medium armor (via PvP).
---
I also tend to do unrewarding stuff, like derp around the maps away from the hordes of players making profit.
---
Broken as in very good? Ir Broken as not working?
---
Also PvE, Open World, Raids, sPvP, WvW?
---
Just an FYI for later. HoT is designed and focused on doing the map META and the whole playerbase pushing it to farm treasures and what not. And Yes everything on the map **is* trying to kill you. Path of Fire is more free form exploration and small groups, e.g. 5-10 ppl as opposed to the whole map. Monsters are still tough but not as punishing as the Jungle.
---
Haha I'm still thinking the pre-patch version of them.
---
My point was that WoW Classic is bad and that it won't be propped up solely by nostalgia.
---
If OSRS is a fun game then it can survive on its merits rather than rose tinted nostalgia that ends in disappointment.
---
Precisely for that reason I don't want to see them as outfits.
---
Swimwear should be for leisure areas, and certain adventures and activities, not something people equip into battle.
---
That's also why I call it "swimwear customization" and not "underwear". We are using underwear as our default swimwear, and that's all the underwear we need.  
---
Whoever wants to see a macho male norn in lingerie can request a commision to an artist willing to do so.
---
If only we can have slot swaps, that would make life easier then :)
---
As a programmer, I'm always triggered by the term "spaghetti code".
---
It's terrible code that was poorly thought out with a bad technical design. Improper use of OO principles can lead to some disgusting messes. But most just blame it on the language.
---
Afaik, however, GW2 uses an HTML overlay for its UI.
---
\&gt;  Also TiL what an eggcorn is.
---
Me too! I guess we both taught each other something.
---
[removed]
---
You're right about this, but it shouldn't matter. The company should still be more upfront about it's plans. There are always going to be whiners or people who say they lied. It's absolutely not better than what we have now.
---
No. It’s trash.
---
SMC.
---
I don't disagree with everything you say, but Season 4 was well received. You say it like there wasn't a lot of praise for it but there was. Probably as much as there was praise for Season 3. In fact, I actually prefer most of the Season 4 zones to Season 3 zones...but of course that's just personal preference. 
---
But there's still praise for both the sky scale and the beetle and those came with Season 4.  
---
I think you're underestimating the relative popularity of season 4 here.  Sure people want other stuff as well, but that doesn't mean Season 4 wasn't popular.
---
Could be something as mundane as it being able to use equipped items as an ingredient.
---
Probably several tickets from people who "lost" their equipped gear.
---
Assnet is trash.
---
Let me run this by you, then: what about Basketbrawl? They had it finished, in the game, all set to go. I remember me and my group of friends going crazy over it.
---
And then it just vanished. Hasn't seen a return since.
---
I mean, it was basically a reskin of Keg Brawl, so there's your low investment. It was a fun new game mode with unique flavor and (at least from what I saw) a lot of excitement from it. So there's your high reward.
---
Where did it go, then? Why did something as simple as a fun little arcade-style basketball game get scrapped even after it was basically finished?
---
If putting in something stupid and fun for the players isn't low-investment-high-reward enough, then what would be? If they really decided to throw it out, that sounds like perfectionism to me, because it didn't meet their standard of *prestige* or it didn't fit neatly into an existing system. So it's not worth the hassle.
---
This won't end well.... *for you*.
---
No. It’s still doesn’t have any charm. It’s garbage Barbie dress up.
---
Okay I'm generally pro road map and I wish the company would communicate with us more than they do, even though there are members of the community who see every word as set in stone and complain if what is talked about doesn't happen. I'd still like to see a road map.
---
That said, we have a situation where people also complain Anet never promotes the game. They don't do anything to promote. So they save an announcement for a big weekend, Pax West, have a live event and as a result, our "road map" or some of the info we seek at least is delayed until that time.
---
Now, instead of saying, oh look at that, Anet is doing something about promoting, we say, sure they're just holding us off trying to buy some time. I've seen that comment. Think about it. They're renting a theater and having a live demo to buy some time? People are nuts.
---
The truth is, they've probably had this planned for a while, they're going to give us some information at that point, and they're likely saving whatever news there is for that, because if you reveal stuff before your reveal, the odds are you're going to hamstring the reveal.
---
I'm happy they're still promoting the game at a convention.
---
If by Paladin you mean Guardian, then check [this](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Polyluminescent_Undulating_Infusion_(Teal)) out.
---
/r/suggestalaptop could help you better
---
You clearly don't watch anime.
---
At this point, I'd be satisfied if ANet simply gave us a small building that was canonically "our house."  Nothing too flashy, but after the events of War Eternal, to return to Central Tyria and have *someone* (I don't care who) say "Hey, you've done so much for everyone.  Here's a place to call your own.  It's not much, but it's got a decent view."
---
And then we could have a humble place for our characters to chill if they're feeling like they just want to watch the clouds or something.
---
Back when I played Spiral Knights, long before guild halls got completely redone, guild halls just looked like a big rectangular room with an elevated stage on the far end for guild leaders to address the members. Behind that was a small protruding ledge that looked out over the [Clockworks](http://i.imgur.com/LBV8mPj.jpg) stretching deep below the planet's surface. It was simple, but sitting there was relaxing. It added depth to the game's experience that I feel ANet often overlooks in GW2.
---
I've had to reinstall/update the Build Templates portion of Arc like one time max in 9 months.  That aspect of Arc doesn't change and it works with previous versions of arc.  Not to mention that Arc has gotten a lot better about not breaking your game every patch, so updating the main aspect religiously isn't something that you have to do nearly as much as previously.  There have been periods of time where I haven't updated it in months and my game was working fine.
---
Also the updates are easy and take less than 1 minute, you literally just replace a file in in your GW2 Program Files and bam, you're done, nothing else
---
Ah, that's good. When I tried it I had to update like three times in a row. But often when those updates happened I was in the middle of stuff with guildies and it was massively inconvenient.
---
Thanks just caught that my self, they are essentially the same thing in general terms but went and fixed it.
---
And yeah a guild makes a big difference in game play and enjoyment, I was in a guild of about 40 people for years and it was nice to get on and see someone doing something and people just chatting away, we would do low tier fractals once a week and grind story when ever it came out on every character we had. But the majority of use were just SOLO only players and over time we kind of drifted apart, but those were some of my funnest parts of LW1 was grinding through all that as it came out, probably faught scarlet and her minions 20+ times
---
Maybe you watch the wrong ones.
---
I think you can benefit greatly from a very specific survey with broad responses and absolutely no open-ended input (open-ended input means one can submit their own response, see "Other:\_\_\_"). Design a survey about a particular aspect of the game that directly effects development, like Open-World design, Meta-rewards, or monetization. Let's pick monetization. Monetization can directly affect how (quickly) a game can progress, but I think is different enough from your own purposes that I'm not doing your homework for you :)
---
Some example questions with follow-up questions, responses in parentheses:
---
* You are content with the available cosmetics in the gem store. (Strongly agree to Strongly disagree)
---
* You would purchase more outfits if they were sold as individual armor sets. (Strongly agree to Strongly disagree)
---
or
---
* Should ArenaNet release expansions and future living story content bundles for a price? (Yes/No)
---
* How likely are you to purchase an expansion if it doesn't include new elite specs? (Very likely to Not likely)
---
* How likely are you to purchase an expac if it greatly expands the available raid wings, at the cost of new elite specs? (Very likely to Not likely)
---
etc. etc.
---
Since it seems your purposes seem to focus on elucidating which area of gameplay is of most interest to your survey responders, perhaps you can make a survey about PvE only, ask questions about the current state of PvE content, and make sure to hit the multiple areas of PvE content (open world, metas, collections, raids, fractals, dungeons). As jackbobevolved mentioned in another comment, try not to include bias into your survey by adding your own opinion in the responses.
---
Nobody forcing me as I want to, but genuinely want to play with others who do as well and don't treat humans poorly. I think you may have missed my mentality, but happy cake day!
---
I mean if he isnt critcapping its a big issue. Because thats the reason we swapped to thief runes anyways.This is in no way minmaxing and you should probably adjust your gear if youre planning to raid with your Slb. If that is by taking more precision in your gear or by swapping to thief runes
---
&gt; Swimwear should be for leisure areas, and certain adventures and activities, not something people equip into battle.
---
They could just be made a Novelty.
---
Yeah it used to be worse, but it's much more consistent now.  I was super against using Arc Build Templates for ages because I wanted Anet to add them, but honestly after I started using them 9 months to a year ago it was the biggest quality of life update for me.  They're not hard to use once you play around with it a bit.  For me, I swap builds probably 1 to 3 times an hour, depending on what I'm doing, so it's super helpful.  I would totally recommend it!  
---
But it may all be irrelevant soon anyway, given that Anet is planning to add them at some point.  It's probably more a case of "do you want the QoL now or later."
---
Great reply, only thing I'd mention is that you can avoid infusing the back piece altogether, as it's far too expensive.
---
No offense, but it didn’t really work well in SMITE and basically became abused as all heck.
---
I was considering making a more, on a scale of 1 to 5, style survey covering the 3 main points of Gw2, Solo-able (open world and story), Group challenge ( fractals and raids) and then PvP aspect ( pvp and Wvw) but my test survey came out to being about 40 questions and took about 5-8 mins to complete. If i want more people to respond then i need to keep it under 60 sec for the general response and wanted to keep it broad. 
---
After some brain storming I figured i should stick with my main point of comparing what people are currently doing/enjoying vs what they want more of and how they go about consuming this content.  Thus I settled on my current Setup of two main question, what do you enjoy and what do you want more of, and give an open ended entry at the end for those who wish to say more. 
---
I do a agree that the use of a more targeted and specified survey would be nice and be able to eliminate alot of my required speculation for the next step but i doubt anyone would be seriously willing to answer questions such as: While playing as a Mesmer what do you like to do? (A) Open World (B) Story (C) PvP .... 
---
but much of this  information can be distilled from a large enough sample group, as i hope to reach with a shorter survey, essentially the problem is quantity vs quality.
---
2 expansions, a few seasons of Living World episodes which included new level 80 maps, some new events, a new profession (Revenant) , Elite Specializations (which are basically sub-classes) ,  Fractals (dungeons which increase in difficulty ) and currencies... so many currencies...
---
Is it possible to move GW2 to another drive without having to re download everything? My SSD is near capacity and I need to move it to my 1TB hard drive.
---
Windows 10, for reference.
---
2 expansions, 4 dlc seasons in between (1 is unplayable now, 5 is coming up next with info coming out next month), 1 new class, 2 elite specializatolns per class at max level which give you access to a new weapon, a new set of traits, and 5 new utility skills per specialization, along with changes to class mechanics, gliding, mounts, raids, fractals, mastery points...
---
Most of this, besides the fractals, needs you to buy the expansions. Keep on the lookout because August tends to have sales. The 4 seasons (called living world) are split into episodes, which are free at launch, and paid if you miss the 3 month launch window.
---
A really easy change would be to just ask about the game mode and not it implies / entails in your opinion - e.g.
---
* Open World exploration/mob killing
---
* The story and development of the characters and world
---
* Raids and Fractals (or other instanced endgame pve content)
---
* Structured player vs player
---
* World vs World (including gvg)
---
Would probably also be good to include an option for the economy / crafting aspect of the game.
---
&gt;The weird thing about this is... I'm  pretty sure I didn't choose "Let an innocent die" in my personal story.  Dafuq did I do to deserve this treatment?! O.o I think I chose "Make  another suffer" and checking in my Journal, a largos named Sayeh al'  Rajihd is mentioned, which - I believe - appears in your personal story  only if you chose "Make another suffer". Am I missing something here?  Why am I so hated? Could it be that I helped a friend of mine in their  personal story which involved Demolitionist Tonn? But even if so, it's  weird.
---
There's two possibilities for how you'd be treated as if you met Tonn when you didn't.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Possibility 1: You went through the personal story during the time period in which the Greatest Fear arc was removed and chapter 8 got restructured; or you at least went to Battle of Fort Trinity. This was a change done mid-2014 as part of a NPE that prepped GW2 for the China launch; for some reason ArenaNet thought it was a good idea to remove one of the best chapters and restructure the ending in a manner that made no sense. Either way, I heard reports that the game treats you as if you had chosen "Let an innocent die" if you played during this time.
---
Do note: Sayeh al' Rajihd shows up in chapter 8 (Orr arc) as well as chapter 7 (greatest fear arc) so you might see her mentioned in one of those story steps. During the time in which the PS was shortened and restructured, the final third of chapter 8 was counted as chapter 7, iirc, and Sayeh does show up in that restructured portion.
---
Possibility 2: If you really did do a different greatest fear arc, then it's possible you countered the fun personal story bug. That bug is pretty much exactly as you guessed: If you join a friend and accept credit for a shared storyline, the game adds some variables onto your character.
---
For example, if you joined a friend during Battle for Fort Trinity, you did Make another Suffer while they did Let an Innocent Die, then your next story step will be the finale of Let an Innocent Die, and the game will treat you as having done both arcs; similarly, if you joined during, say, a racial sympathy storyline with a friend who's in a different order, your character will be considered as a member of both orders.
---
I said you "may" be a raider, which is not the same as saying you are. And I was talking about the plural you not you specifically anyway. So much for prejudice.
---
  
---
I read a lot. And I see what people say a lot. You can deny all you want that season 4 was well received, but people don't remember what happened 2 months ago, let alone a year ago. Most of the season was well received.
---
intentionally feeding or "inting" is when you run straight into the enemy, and die constantly giving them points.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Release
---
You can deny it all you want. But it wasn’t well received, which is why people are begging for an xpac. 
---
Your feelings about things mean nothing.
---
People always want an XPAC. Doesn't have anything to do with how well received something is. It's like saying I liked a Star Trek movie, so I don't want a new series.
---
paladin (technically guardian) does have quite a few skills that apply burning, so flaming armor isn't completely incompatible...
---
Thats not my Point tho.. "farming" was sololy thr term for getting the Gold together.
---
[No.](https://media.giphy.com/media/9ZJAlJmvW4uEU/giphy.gif)
---
You know, thinking about this.  It makes a lot of sense why people are dissatisfied with the new maps and content.  If combat is the big draw then most of the other stuff would be less engaging and people would get bored with it faster because irregardless of the new place to explore, they've gone through all the ways to fight in it.  And not having that fresh experience and not being able to pin down exactly *why* it doesn't feel fresh would turn the exploration sour.
---
Thanks OP.  That's a pretty significant bit of insight and I hope it gets to the right people.
---
Meanwhile gamers continue to complain about the lamentable industry practice of studios releasing unfinished/buggy AAA games...

I could probably keep going, but I don't feel the need.  The point isn't that good work isn't important.  It's that a team is only as good as the people leading it.  They can either lead it in the right directions or the wrong ones, but the ultimate responsibility lies with their guidance.  They rightly get credit for successes, and conversely get the blame when they screw the pooch.
---
What steps have you taken so far? Have you redownloaded ArcDPS? Have you checked your PC's  firewall settings?
---
Your next line will be: "Now that's quality armour"
---
&gt;  in reality there's no obligation or even need to share a roadmap with players. 
---
There's no obligation to be a player, either. See? We can all just ignore each other and go our separate ways.
---
Also, don't touch tactivators unless you know what you are doing. Don't pull invuln if a wall/gate is above 30%, some people pull it at 50, but when a wall or gate is above 50% health, invuln is wasted.
---
Someone crafted with legendary rune socketed armor?

If you have access to the Lava Lounge via the gem store scroll , I recommend that. I love the scenery and glow of that place.

This not way to list this quickly, game is so different since release , time to read up wiki

Absolutely. That's why they ignore this sub and ban people outright in the official forums, if it suits them. Every bit of communication and interaction of a company is intended and planned.

For some reason i did the event and did the dance moves and nothing. It wasn't until I watcheda  video and did what you already descibed and it finally worked. Talk to NPC transform, untransform glide to the rock and /dance.

Can you use any part of ArcDPS or is it a problem only with Build Templates?
---
You need to find a semi-large group of people who use voice chats on a regular basis. Otherwise it’s boring as hell
---
Not needed, I just added back the )
---
Just was weird is all. Definitely looks helpful for OP though!
---
ArcDPS works fine. The problem is only with Build Templates.
---
if this helps...
---
Additionally:
---
Team chat is used for talking to people across maps when you need to call reinforcements. Such as when your T3 garrison is being attacked and you have no people on map to defend and need to call for more bodies. It's also used to report large enemies movements so people can prepare for the enemy's strategy.
---
As much, spamming in team chat is generally frowned upon as it can cause you to miss important info very easy.
---
Map chat can only be seen by those on your map and in general it's more chatty than team chat. You still do callouts on it, but since it tends to be more small scale or uncertain in nature ('bay is contested, can anyone check?') ('we got 3 roamers heading to north camp') people are much less srs business on it.
---
That's not to say that nonsense talk in team chat never happens, but it's generally only in downtime, and trolls are more likely to harp on people asking newbie questions in team chat since it's more apparent that they don't know how the game mode works.
---
Laughs in Signet of Malice while I spam death blossom for days. TEEF!

Do you have Chrome? If so, could you open a new tab, right click anywhere, choose inspect, go to the Network tab, make sure the circle in the top left is circle (meaning it's recording) and then in that Chrome tab go to  [https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/dev1](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/dev1) . After that, something probably called 'dev1' should appear. If you click on that what does it say under General then Status Code. For example, mine says "200 OK"

---
Or maybe they just happen to have different opinions, man. Chill. People who still like the game aren't demons who are out to destroy all that is good in the world.
---
I think all this uproar is a fart in the wind, a bunch of entitled players that do not understand what it takes to make such drastic changes in just a couple of months following the layoffs plus there is game fatigue,  people want to play some of the other games out there and what better time to do so than between major content updates...
---
You can also count on existing activities being further gutted. Last Festival of the Four Winds, almost no one played Aspect Arena bcause there was basically no reward associated with it. And during Wintersday, Snowball Mayhem now givs less of a reward than it ever has before; not even the standard PvP win/loss coin.
---
Jagex puts out a yearly roadmap at Runefest for both its versions of *Runescape*: what their plans are for the game for next year. At other Runefest presentations they even show more long-term plans. Sometimes it backfires, yes: they had a problem with announcing stuff before they were sure it was technically feasible to make.
---
But I do wish Anet would be as communicative as Jagex is.
---
Good point :)
---
But from what I recall, that only offers access to the item user. Same with permanent TP tool, or merchant.
---
Lmao, holy shit that was wayyyyy more over the top than I expected it to be when I clicked it!
---
Trust me, we know.
---
For classes, you can just tell from the squad UI. And if you're not in squad, how you position yourself, your animations, and your weapons will give you away. If you're standout odd, people will even click on you to make sure. Yes, we notice. Also, if anyone play ranger, all LB skills stick out like a sore thumb.
---
For what you do in fights.....I've spent an inordinate amount of time sideeyeing people who run magic find or DPS food on healing classes, and I don't even check these things a lot on a relative scale. Those people will use arc. So even if you run meta classes, if you....say, run a roaming build in a zerg for some reason, people would notice that you're not doing the heals/damage you should have.
---
Also sometimes the animation differences between for zerg build and roaming build are just that stark. /stare at all those people who play sw/d weaver in a zerg for some ungodly reason.
---
Well the way the OP suddenly turned on the guy toward the end is what I thought was funny and why I posted. From "Oh, this is just the feeling I get from the players when I read the forums" to "fuck you the content and story are garbage! you're just a white knight or Anet employee!" out of nowhere lol.

Hog Hunt? Mate, that quest had everything:  [https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hog\_Hunt](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Hog_Hunt) 
---
 **Nehdukah**: *"Listen closely, Yapono, for I am about to tell you my famous tale. There I was walking through the* [*Echovald Forest*](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Echovald_Forest)*, when suddenly I found myself face-to-face with a* [*Black Moa*](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Black_Moa) *bird protecting her clutch of eggs...."*
---
**Beastmaster Yapono**: *"Nehdukah's telling the Black Moa story again... doesn't he know that we all think he's a fake?"*
---
**Nehdukah**: *"It was the most amazing creature I had ever seen... a Black Moa as dark as the nighttime ocean. Behind her was a nest full of eggs...."*
---
*"While I was in the bushes, another hunter emerged from the forest. I can only assume she, too, was in search of this mystical creature."*
---
*"But this Black Moa was canny. It heard her coming and yet didn't move a muscle! She approached, and out of nowhere the beast attacked her and knocked her to the forest floor."*
---
*"Of course, at this point, I had to act quickly. I ran out to save the other hunter, despite the danger to myself. Sadly, I was one heartbeat too late. The cruel bird got in one more vicious peck...."*
---
*"And it pecked one of her eyes right out of her skull. Terrible! I will have nightmares of the horrible sight for years to come. She was so grateful to have survived that she gave me two of the eggs from the nest."*
---
**Chitundu**: *"Tore out her eye? I bet she didn't see that coming. Ha! I mean, that's terrible. Where are these eggs now?"*
---
**Beastmaster Yapono**: *"I know this part of the story well. She lost her precious eggs, isn't that right, Nehdukah? All lies I tell you. Nehdukah is no hunter!"*
---
**Nehdukah**: *"I am a mighty hunter, Yapono, you'll see. I will go and bring back an impressive pet to prove it. You'll see!"*
---
**Beastmaster Yapono**: *"Don't hurt yourself trying, Nehdukah. Pets are for real hunters, not for tale-tellers like you."* 
---
And during the middle of the quest there's a plot-twist!
---
 **Nehdukah**: *"It's awful. Perhaps the others are right; I am not a great hunter. But I want to be. and I did see a Black Moa bird!"*
---
*"I used to have a way with animals, but I lost it. I think my fear of the Black Moa bird, and the fact that people don't believe me, has really hurt my self-confidence. Animals can tell, you know. They avoid me."*
---
*"The truth of the matter is... the other hunter saved my life, not the other way around. The Black Moa attacked me, and she drove it away. In return, that Moa took her eye."*
---
*"I never thought that a creature would make me look over my shoulder everywhere I go. But that battle with the Black Moa has really affected me. If only people believed me, maybe I wouldn't feel so alone."*
---
**Nehdukah**: *"Aieeee! What was that?!"*
---
*"Oh, thank* [*Melandru*](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Melandru)*. It was just a* [*warthog*](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Warthog)*."*
---
*"Stay close and make certain nothing disturbs me while I charm this beast."*
---
 *"Ah there you go little one, don't be afraid. You're the best warthog in the entire world, aren't you?"*
---
*"Have some of these nice tubers... there you are. Don't eat them all at once. We're going to be good friends, aren't we?"*
---
*"Let's head back and show everyone my new precious little warthog."* 
---
And when he heads back he impresses everybody:
---
 **Nehdukah**: *"Everyone meet my warthog. I'm going to name him* [*Pork Chop*](https://guildwars.fandom.com/wiki/Pork_Chop)*, a name fit for a champion warthog! I told you I would find a real pet and bring it back with me."*
---
*"See guys, what did I tell you? I took on your challenge and succeeded! Pork Chop and I are friends for life, and I am the mightiest hunter of all."*
---
**Chitundu**: *"Wow! Yapono, what a wonderful warthog. Did you see him? Nehdukah is so brave!"*
---
**Beastmaster Yapono**: *"I would never have believed it. Well done, Nehdukah. It looks like I may have underestimated you."*
---
**Nehdukah**: *"Maybe now they'll believe me about the Black Moa bird! Either way, I don't need them anymore. I have Pork Chop, and he's my best friend."* 
---
That quest had tragedy, rivalry, humor, companionship, and a redemption arc. If you're trying to say something in GW1 wasn't well-written surely you could have picked a different quest.
---
I'm going to look into this, thanks :)
---
So I stared GW2 in windowed mode, opened on my second screen "https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/dev1" with the Network tab/ General &gt; Status Code and waited until the Template overlay doesn't work anymore... but nothing changed about the status code anytime. It is every time "200 OK" or did I misunderstand something?
---
Ofcourse, but unfortunately not also a trading post tab :)

Quaggans master race now 😁

&gt; Not everyone is "White Knighting" they just have much more patience
---
I think this way of phrasing it is really wrong. I've played GW2 since 2012, we're now in 2019. Me being done with their lack of improvement on communication does not mean I have less patience. People come in the game in different 'eras'. I'm done hoping for things to change and your phrasing with that sentence implies virtue and I'm not down for that.
---
Then we rely on the other final good boon in the game, Resistance.
---
The funny bit is I can't tell if you're serious or not. It's incredibly outlandish, but through spaghetti code anything is possible.
---
Elite specs bring new weapons, utilities and even profession mechanic changes (berserker and spellbreaker are good examples of that) All of those extra things a elite trait line adds makes them more potent than just what the traits do. To take your example of DH, would the DH be better than core guard if they didnt use traps and the spear of justice? The point is its more than just the traits to consider. The added utility skills and changes to profession mechanics are equally and in some cases more important to why elite specs "outclass core" as the traits are.
---
Not sure why I have to post for graphics card help here since my post was deleted. Making a post to get help on this subreddit is so difficult compared to any other subreddit but anyway. 
---
I have an i7 chip and an AMD Radeon HD 6800 Series graphics card. This game is unplayable for me with the low settings and it doesn’t matter if I’m doing dungeons/open world, it’s just so slow. If anyone can help I’d really appreciate it!! I just have such low FPS no matter what I’m doing and it sucks because I really want to get into this game again.
---
Heritage Leggings are okay.
---
This game is like a plate of spaghetti that is secretly just three extremely long noodles coiled together.
---
Yesn't
---
It would be nice.if we got a roadmap just once.
---
I mean there are enough shitty novels that also have "tragedy, rivalry, humor, companionship, and a redemption arc. " That sounds like pretty much every cliché story out there.
---
Have you tried Alt + Shift + H?
---
Usually people have arc installed correctly but it gets accidentally hidden so it doesn’t seem to pop up.
---
I do love Lornars Pass, just above the lake on the hill where its snowing and look down and see some greenery.
---
It would be fine if they were weekly/monthly, rewards won't matter much since people will do them for the AP.
---
And if you toss in crazy rewards to get people to do them then it will become a mandatory grind and not just another thing to do.
---
Tybalt, Recap!

Yes, commander.

I like loitering at the end of jumping puzzles when it's a daily as the chest tonic - the amount of people that run up to me and try to loot really brightens my day
---
&gt; So they save an announcement for a big weekend, Pax West, have a live event and as a result, our "road map" or some of the info we seek at least is delayed until that time.
---
We don't know yet what the announcement will fulfill but I actually feel like this is a bit naive. I don't think this event is officially part of Pax West but near it? I even went to the website for the theatre and they don't even have this event listed there D: But it feels like this is an easy way to be buried by the sea of other games and studios on that weekend AND is literally 3 days after WoW Classic release. Like them trying to tie it to a big weekend like Pax West feels like an actual fauxpas rather than help it promote the game unless they were actively advertising there. It feels like a bad move to me.

It's been 3 years since the last time it was around 300g.

https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character
---
Bladed armor from Verdant Brink has all stats now too.
---
Easy answer for you is CRAFTING, you can craft everything you need, and you can get all mateří you need in the world, but ofc its quite expensive max your crafting, but its worth it
---
Depends on your playstyle and damage preferences, tbh. 
---
PvP is an excellent way to get armor sets that fit your stats.
---
Also, don't just sell your old gear - salvage them and then sell them on the Black Lion Auction House to earn more gold and use it to buy yourself dope gear.  Remember - KEEP SALVAGING!!!
---
Yeah I wasnt very active in those years either, only doing dailies and logging off, didnt bother checking.
---
Some of the week long events have also dumped some lower level materials into the market which should have decreased the profit from opening bags on lower level characters a bit.
---
While it was good at first, constantly spamming that potions is just kinda flawed to me.
---
If 6 months is a long time (Spring Quarterly fixed HoT) in 2015 then how do you think people feel after 2 years before PoF was fixed? If 5 months is an eternity to bored gamers, 2 years ... yeah? =/
---
For the set stuff, when I played other mmos some of them had set effects (for having a full set of gear). So should I aim to get a full set to get the "full effect" or get multiple sets with part of the effect. Idk if this makes sense lol
---
it doesn't work in most games
---
Which regions are you playing on?
---
NA and EU can’t interact, though they can form a party.
---
Yes i have , nothing happens.
---
In your home are some stuff too, for example for humans, if you save quagans in shiverpeak, they move to your home and are outside near forge, where is pool with orian pearls
---
This may surprise you, but it's not that uncommon for devs to play their game on stream when new patches come out.
---
Depends.
---
If you play the long game, you want every infusion slot for stat infusions.
---
Also Mawdrey II is almost free to infuse.
---
But yeah, I should have mentionned it, thanks for the input.
---
we never got a real roadmap for the last 5 years (or 4). also the last time they gave us a roadmap we never got some of the listed in the same year anyway.  
---
now i don't know what exactly you want. later this month they have a special event just watch it first and if you are not satisfied whine later. but at least wait first to see what they have to tell in that event.
---
*Me wasting my stun break on thief for that juicy swiftness*
---
Alright cool just what I was thinking. So is it common to get all the runes for the set or get parts of it?
---
forget dungeons. it is waste of time. any gear set can be bought like for 10-15g total. and even f2p player can get that money in hour or two just with gathering iron/platinum/logs.
---
What is the exact filename of the arcdps file and what folder is it in? It seems it didn't get loaded.
---
I've never seen a salad sprint so fast before.
---
don't think so. The transaction really happens at the very end.
---
If you want my opinion of what's the issue, specially since it only affects weapons/armor is that once you click the craft the button you equip the item in question and then the program is unable to delete it, so you get to keep the item and be able to exploit it since the item in question is probably the most expensive part of the recipe.
---
Cheer up buttercup, we got pavement this time!
---
haha...
---
in the twilight oasis fractal, if you gg after fighting amala (where you get in a forced downstate) to speed things up and then respawn, only females can move.  
---
male characters are stuck at the respawnpoint of ~7s.
---
Worse. You press one button and a group of enemies dies.
---
But it is not bitchy at all. People are rightful to ask for more info. The company was in deep shit earlier this year. Since then we got told, "no problem boiz, we give you QoL improvements the game is not dead!". Besides that there is no proof that the game will have meaningful and improved content in the next 1 year to come. If the fractal and raid releases stay in the same cadence and Season 5 will have the same layout as seasons before then the game can be effectively called dead. In practice, it's not dead but the more invested people will slowly go away and people who aim for shiny gemstore skins and easy story steps will remain. If that's the goal then it's okay but still sad to see the unused potential.
---
He comes across like the shittier sort of dragon.
---
is it just me or did they increase the rocket turret f-skill distance
---
Still 10 buttons, just every 10 seconds. You can't interweave them, so it's not that difficult to remember or manage.
---
hi neighbors hope your doing well
---
More likely than not, you won't notice much of a difference going from 3600 to 9600k or vice versa at stock. Once overclocked 9600k might see slight fps advantage in less player populated areas.
---
You said you are primarily playing GW2, but if you won't upgrade in the next several years then the extra 6 threads that 3600 provides will help a lot with achieving higher minimum fps in games that can take advantage of high core/thread count cpus (there are already a lot of games like these, and more to come).
---
Go with 3600 and use the price difference for a beefy cooler.
---
I think plenty of people would make Tengu (especially all the people dreaming of Cantha), but I'm not optimistic that they'll add a new race going forward because they'd have to re-record all the dialogue for the base game, two expansions, and three living seasons. 
---
If it was a typical oldschool MMO they could get away with just having it as a new starting area/story, but one of the things GW2 does well is referring back to old story content and the choices you've made. If you started as a Tengu and Tengu didn't go through the core story like the other players did, every reference to you killing Zhaitan just became obsolete, for example. They could charge for it as a "race pack" addon or something, but then it becomes a matter of correctly predicting how much they need to charge to ensure their costs for it are covered but the price won't turn people off.
---
It sucks that there's a business side to gaming. I'm sure there's a ton the devs would love to do (like adding a race) that they just don't have the resources for. :(
---
Doing the collections also give achievement points, which is sadly the true endgame content, so people rather go for those, or buy the gen1's right off the bat to bypass the hassle.
---
And Revenants would only be able to use green colors on their armor, unless they are in Jalis presence.
---
holds hand,....we can do this together as
---
the last of our kind.
---
True. No GCD in the games you're talking about ?
---
no world chat, you can't spam for cheapest golds if you don't buy the game.
---
The only way 3600x would be worth over the 3600 is if its price would be only 10% higher than that of a 3600 (currently it's 25% higher MSRP price).
---
You pay 25% more to get 2% more performance and a bit better cooler.
---
It's absolutely not worth it. You are far better off going with 3600 and using the price difference for a much much better aftermarket cooler that'll keep cpu boosted higher for longer while keeping temps lower (which in turn also leads to less noisy fan).
---
How can you dislike Stephen!
---
as soon as there are investors involved the people playing the game stop beeing the customer 
---
the customer is the investor
---
Uhh... no? No we didn't. The information we wanted... was a roadmap.
---
Makes me think of Aziraphale from Good Omens.
---
Crafting is by FAR the most expensive and boring method.
---
I see squads farming sw on a daily basis... Are you online at really odd hours?
---
Best roaming class is necro because it hits really good and has very good survivability.
---
Guardian is also very good. Dragon hunter has very good dps and also a little survivability.
---
If you have pof you should try condi quickness firebrand. Really love to roam with this class (:
---
Ps: wasn't sure about whether you only talking about core classes or not and if you have the expansions
---
uhh, UI changes. Bad, very bad idea in gw2
---
Sorry, made an Edit :D
---
So like the 7th and onward account wide iventory slots?

Quote:"Ahhh wait...your talking about wvw... My bad sry.
---
Forget what I said... ^^"
---
I just woke up and mixed it somehow with pve solo "roaming" in open world.
---
Shit happens, happy now?
---
Same. If I ever go under 50% HP I feel like I'm doing something really wrong. This is also why I never run with glasscannon builds. The fuck likes to go down from a single unmissable attack (hello, Mouth of Mordremoth wyverns).
---
Tbh I run a full minion build, *except for that one*. I found its healing really low and unreliable. Usually when I want healing I want all of it, right now.
---
Necro is worst possible class to choose for solo roaming in wvw.
---
You'll be more successful with any other class.
---
Soulbeast is still very strong, holo, herald, weaver.
---
Guard has some interesting builds, but maybe not the strongest roamer.
---
And mesmer,thief are roaming kings.
---
No it’s more like you’re confused with what Nike is actually saying. 
---
He refers to how the vast majority of the playerbase just don’t communicate at all. No one talks in say/map chat really. Even in metas everyone is in their own little bubble. And you may feel that the game doesn’t, but the game really does push towards you not having to interact with anyone at all, unless you make the deliberate effort to which most wont. Open world is so easy that it doesn’t require communication for the most part. You can sell stuff on the tp without interacting with players, alongside all the other convenience. It’s why the phrase “playing together alone” comes into play because well, there’s just no reason for most people to interact because nothing forced them to, whether it be challenging content or simply social mechanics. And this, this is a real problem.
---
Zooming into Rytlock’s face on the final panel has me in tears ;)
---
Sometimes it just feels wrong to leave my character with a big chunk of missing HP for several *seconds* longer than necessary :P
---
Hm. Not necessarily. Yes - there's alot of content in Guild Wars 2 and when you look at it as a new players, usually you think that you won't get bored. But sooner or later people often notice that all of this content is meaningless. And they don't feel the need to do this at all.
---
My point, if you missed it, was that failed releases from well over 1.5 years ago isn't worth factoring into decisions.
---
I dont wanna get into a fight between intel and AMD.
---
Both userbenchmark and passmark are very generic views on the cpus performance and shoudn't be used.
---
No matter how much you agree or disagree, nothing will change at ArenaNet. I can't shake the feeling that many employees are horribly unqualified to work in the gaming industry. Whenever I think of ArenaNet, I see a [pink haired woman](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EAXp634UYAECVIH.jpg) (she's the global brand manager at ArenaNet, which is why marketing has always been dreadful or nonexistent).
---
I never got a chance to buy Tybalt a round of cider. 😿
---
Must be feminist, lesbian and liberal, ya know.
---
The people actually running the game's overall direction don't care if 1,000 players are happy and spend $1 a month in the gemstore, or one player is happy and spends $1,000 a month. In fact, better the latter because it's easier to find something to get that one "whale" blowing wads of cash on than it is finding something for the 1,000 players to all spend money on.
---
If the former was the case and the game was developed around that, you would see content aimed at keeping large numbers of players in the game, in whatever form that took. Instead of things like "legendary upgrades" which will only effect a very small number of players, and I daresay more than a few of those will be converting $ to gems to gold to buy the QoL change. Enough that it makes it worthwhile instead of doing something like a small new piece of content that gets lots of players back that are unlikely to spend any money in the cash shop.
---
I feel bad for the developers caught in the middle, on one hand passionately wanting to make a game that is enjoyed and loved as much as they love it, on the other hand constantly being pressured from "above" to put things in the game that they know aren't going to be liked and they will be the ones getting the flack for it instead of the faceless investors.
---
1. He said it feels like it he is forced.
---
when I do my daily meta event chain there is lots of talk in squads and map chat. this "zero communication" argument is BS.
---
Looks great, but shouldn't the Ash legion (stealthy one) give +1 dex, Iron legion (inventive one) give +1 int and blood legion (fighty one) give +1 con?
---
😂😂😂
---
nice, looks so gothic
---
Come back in about 6 months and ask the question again :)
---
We'll hopefully find out on the 30th of august. Based on that I'll know whether to quit the game or keep playing.
---
how far up your ass do you have your head? the game or IT industry (or every other industry that attracts young employees) is full of ppl like her.
---
The answer won't satisfy you, but: nobody knows
---
I really hope Anet will communicate a bit about their competitive/hardcore-gamemode future as well during their announcement, but let's be real....they won't.
---
Unlikely
---
Oh boi, are those items real or fake?
---
Dungeons give you liquid gold, mats and tokens to buy gear with, how is that a waste of time?
---
abused in what sense? in league of legends at least it works very well.
---
Thanks, Tybalt! Have an [apple cider]!
---
Ahh, that hit the spot.
---
&gt; because I respect your valuable time
---
Pity you aren't respecting people in game on map chat with your spam.
---
This could have been pretty useful for the guild weapons as there is two variations for the upgrade that require the Base item
---
&gt;
---
Developers have legions of shills, fanboys, and white knights defending their bullshit.
---
all ive been seeing here the past couple of months is the opposite
---
There are builds to solo shiro in factions but can't solo a mission if you aren't highly overleveled.
---
Crazy, these racial skills actually have some weight to them lol
---
the most optimal way to play the game is basically clearing the whole screen before you even realise where you are. if you have the chance to recognize the enemies before they die you are basically wasting time. you could theoretically play difficult content where you don't oneshot the whole screen every second but the rewards for that are usually way worse than just rushing easier content when it comes to rewards (in game currencies).
---
i like the general premise of the game but i personally find that the extremely fast paced playstyle gets old really fast.
---
You drunk again?
---
Sooner than you might think. Legendary runes/sigils are jsut another milestone to get the templates, and those arrive today. They are gradually working towards it.
---
On the other hand, wvw alliances are unknown, but I think that last what we heard was that they do work but they lack GUIs yet, and that is at least 4+ months ago as well....so it might not be that far away as well, *hopefully....*

I'm using a Ryzen 3700x. The performance improvement compared to my old is i7 3770k is incredible. You can except also a huge improvement with a 3600. 
---
But maybe you should wait a bit, because AMD Bioses and Microcode still needs to be patched properly. They're plauged by bugs right now. In it's actual state I can only recommend you the more stable Intel system

Overwatch has an endorsement system. Not a single player cares about this except for the free 3 lootboxes you get for being level 4.  
---
My endorsement level.

1.2.3.2.3.4.3.4.3.4.3.2.3.4. ??????  So what?
---
The same thing happened to me when I started to play again two years again. But my bank and money were unaffected. Just the character I had was gone.
---
That would never be removed from full bags then complain about lack of inventory.
---
But of the 20 buttons:  
---
• 4 can only be used out of combat  
---
• 4 have 5+ minutes cooldown  
---
• 4 have 1 to 3 minutes cooldown  
---
• 4 have 15 to 30 seconds cooldown.  
---
• 4 have no cooldown
---
This is why im a main staff water ele, cause im too scared of getting hurt.
---
Combative nature is required if you want to play the game at an above average level. And since most of the wvw vets have been bullied out of the game, the average level nowadays is far lower than what it used to be.
---
The truth is communities and pugs fared better 4 years ago than they do now. The "stacked" servers are small remnants of groups back then with few new players, and most other servers wont even try to match them and play entirely avoidant.
---
Divide is simply a consequence of how the game has moved to being far more carebear over time, with no option for guilds and experienced players to play as they wish.
---
Nah, better learning now how to be called out.
---
E is my healing skill, A is my elite skill.

You don't have choices if you actually play for performance. Balance state is atrocious.

If you do fractals regularly, what's fun about face tanking mechanics without trying to get better? I guess its relaxing to smash buttons until you look at the numbers and realise its not very effective.

Would be better if the sand barrier was shown in front of your health, like a protective layer on top of your health. So you still see that your health is full.

I don't understand why you're so surprised. I'm not saying it likes it's a ton of effort but if I'm playing a game, I'm playing it to play the game. Not give imaginary internet points to a stranger. So no, I'm not going to open that shit up.
---
Don’t worry there is a phase 2 coming, still deciding how to handle it :-)
---
I love how creative you were into defining racial traits, i like asuras a lot ( thought i agree with others making somehting "indestructible" is too much, just give some hp and make it so when it goes to 0 it's merely "decommissioned" but easily repairable).
---
That said, i have some things to pick on, some are subjective and other probably less so:
---
\- I dislike that each race has a "subrace" that really isn't a subrace but rather a background with stats involved. it just makes it far too much easy to just pick the subclass you prefer for your class, rather grant a flavour to it, with little to no consequence. I know Inquests aren't like the others, for example, but this variance hardly helps describe it or set a compromise involved for it. The only subrace i like is the norn since it has a very specific impact. If you want them to be better, i suggest to not use ability scores but proficiency or similar traits.
---
\- ... however, about the norn, make it so the ability score increase while in spirit form isn't tied to spirit form but is permanent once chosen it. It saves a lot of paperwork, really, and it's not an absurd power increase.
---
\- I don't get the warband heirlooms. For a martial class for example not being able to swap weapon and armor when necessary it's doom, and it feel very un-charr like.
---
also, there is no stated "out of combat" state in dnd and you should recode it more appropriately.
---
\- Silvary's Photosyntesis is extremely, extremely, extremely powerful if in the right scenario. But also it's extremely hard to track, and can be source of heated debates on the table, which i think it's the biggest offence. I suggest you to make a more consistent trait, or a more limited one.
---
That said, i love how you managed to keep it simple int erms of features list and in terms of resource management, without abusing too much short or long rests. Only norn and silvary use them, but i'd say it's required for their race fantasy.
---
Looks nice. One thing and maybe it's just me but the way the copy and images are laid out right now makes me want to connect them vertically vs. horizontally (Asura column is aligned to Charr image, etc.).
---
asura wouldn't get wisdom, they are smart but not wise. they are more the type to wonder if they can do something rather than if they should do something.
---
This comment cannot be upvoted enough.

---
Based on my work experience (software, but not games) I did not find this especially outlandish or surprising.
---
Please send help!
---
Can I get the "The Desolation: Hero's Choice Chest" and "Domain of Vabbi: Hero's Choice Chest" once per day per account OR once per day per account PER META (aka once for junundu rising, once for maws of torment or only once for junundu rising OR maws of torment?)
---
and alot of orbs for them amalgamate gemstones
---
You need to be lvl 10 to get in to the racial city were there are portals to Divinity Reach or you simply move to DR and use the portal entrance there. Getting to lvl 10 do not take very long so you should have not issues to get to the festival.
---
The event have two locations. The one pavilion were you fight mobs and bosses and the event starts over with like 10 min reset. If you use the ramps and move up to an area above there will be mini bosses for you to fight were they are simple at first and becomes challanging the higher up you get. You might have to adjust your build and skills to overcome them.
---
Then there is the Labyrinthine Cliffs, the fluff area were you do events, mount races (you can hire a mount for 10 silver if you are f2p) and a sort of PvP event that is for fun.
---
Thanks so much for the review, I like getting this kind of feedback:
---
- For subrace I mostly draw from the character creation choices making a new character, and they don’t have much effect on actual gameplay, I was trying to mirror that while giving you a choice on playing into it or not.
---
- The Norn one is probably just bad formatting, the stat boost is constant on. Just the additional option in spirit form was from the subclass choice, will try edit that language.
---
- Warband Heirlooms should be more powerful for Gish classes rather than martials. Comparing a paladin to a warlock: Paladin already has Prof with martial weapons and heavy armor, but now can start with a great sword and breastplate. While a Warlock Gish can too but he doesn’t actually have proficiency with heavy armor if they ever find a plate armor, or magic greatsword. 
---
- Finally Sylvari I agree is powerful but takes a full action to start, then takes your potential BA, and immobilises you. So a opponent could just move out of range and focus someone else, even the range usually means if someone wants to get to you then can still get in melee before you can grapple.
---
Hope that helps explain, will check and make adjustments for the next version! Thanks!
---
I’m talking about solo play! But with a tag, finding four players isn’t so bad either.
---
All those chests are "Once per day per account" (once per map if you will) it's just that you can chose which meta you will do to get it.
---
Honestly I think they failed big time in management of project after 2012 release.
---
1. While season 1 was a disaster, Living World S2+ is single playthrough content with no value for and MMO. Done once, no reason to do it twice. For that matter it is not really better for game than LWS1. Amount of content produced and gone to waste pool is just staggering (maps, boss fights and assets). Meanwhile game development pace struggles to even be on the maintenance mode with endgame content like PvP, WvW, raids and fractals.
---
2. Technical debt and developer retention is so bad that we still to receive build templates, just got our HoT legendaries, and would not ever get any new gamemode, SAB w3-4 and etc.
---
3. Community management is awful. Tech support that lags 2-3 week behind is the worst that I ever saw in gaming. Twitch coverage is non existent and was mismanaged badly on 2012 release. Partner program is just awful mess that makes people quit content creation all together if you compare it with successful games like Warframe. No memes allowed. And if you still not got your official forum ban for any random reason, we are coming for you.
---
Cool, thanks for attacking my career, I was just stating that ultimately companies answer to who pays them. Although people think it's the consumer, it's not, it's the Investors, and Investors just want money.
---
Luckily most game Devs take pride in what they make and want the customers to enjoy the product. Since GW2 is a "live service" they can make changes and improve the service. Things do take time, but like the OP mentioned, there's too many hands in the  jar making things take even longer.
---
To be honest you will succeed most on the class that you know the most about, as in knowing every little trick there is to your class and your skills and how to bend it in your favor. 
---
Ofc there are classes that are better choices but if you know nothing about the above then they wont do much use for you until you get to the point were you know everything about it and can bend it in your favor.
---
I actually did use this: 
---
The idea was a +2 main stat, choice of +1 off stat, plus a minor feature worth about 3 points like Tool proficiency or darkvision. 
---
Making each race ~ 16 + a major feature which should be around 10 points which is causing the discussions below about overpowered or underpowered as they are hard to judge.
---
In GW2 being a MMO there isn’t much focus on different languages so I didn’t want to include.
---
Also I wanted to make sure they don’t feel like normal DND races so specifically removed sylvan from sylvari.
---
Resistance can be corrupted too :)
---
Yeah. "Outlawed discussion and tyranny". Blithering idiots.
---
I think to align with (5e, I haven't played 3.5) dnd the asura movement should be 25ft not 30. Halflings, Dwarves, and Gnomes are all 25 movement speed due to size.
---
Only took them half a year and some comps are still bad
---
Yay! :D
---
3600, nobrainer.  
---
6 extra threads. same single core performance.  
---
There is absolutely no reason whatsoever to get an Intel CPU at this time.
---
"Help with x hero point" doesnt count.
---
True enough i guess.  I was thinking more DnD for the languages then GW2.
---
The biggest issue I had was Pact Tactics for Norn Wolf. It's equal to bear for any class that doesnt get an extra attack. 
---
BUT its just so much better than any other bonus. Similar Idea of why people pick Variant Human all the time only because of the Feat.
---
F2P have limited access to the TP. They can only trade items on a whitelist. So gathering mats and selling them is a possibility. However, buying devona's armour off the TP is probably not possible.
---
I do that with my Soulbeast because it's fun to roar like a bear after finishing a fight. =P
---
I logged in my friend's account, chose the character that I helped with her personal story, went to Auric Basin to talk with Ceera and... she has normal dialogues with her! Which disproves both possibilites. She started the game at the same time that I did, so if she also skipped those steps, she should have the same dialogues with Ceera as me. If the game treats everybody who didn't play through those steps as if they chose "Letting an innocent die", why does she hate me but not my friend? For the same reason, it can't be that I have that dialogue because I helped my friend, when my friend has a normal interaction with Ceera. 
---
With this, the only option left I can think of, is that Ceera's dialogue is bugged, like it happened to another user in this thread...
---
Thanks that actually does make sense, maybe I will change to advantage on first attack each turn. Good feedback forgot to reconsider that part.
---
Norn ingame models are about 1.5 times as tall as humans, which puts them at around 8-10 feet.
---
F'real this is a combo of my 2 favorite things.  I'd be down as well once it's all done.
---
Nani?! That Asura must be a stand user!
---
You should level up your crafting for two reasons only : 
---
1. You want to craft ascended/legendary/exclusive gear.
---
2. You want to speed up the leveling of an alt and you don't have tomes lying around.
---
For anything less you are better off buying on the TP.
---
Nonsense. SSD decreases loading times significantly and won't do shit for frame rate and frame times.
---
The answer from /u/NFSokol is 100% correct. However, there's also more to the story.
---
&gt; I am planning to upgrade my CPU
---
You're also going to have to upgrade your motherboard. With the Ryzen 3600, take note of the fact that for your usage, the X570 motherboards provide no improvement over the B450/X470 motherboards. You can save yourself quite a bit of money without sacrificing any performance. For example, the MSI B450 Tomahawk is a solid motherboard with great VRMs and it's currently $115 versus the least expensive X570 motherboard at $154. For only $160 ($6 more than the cheapest X570), you can get an MSI B450 Gaming Pro Carbon AC which is a fantastic motherboard.
---
Also, remember that the motherboard you purchase for the Ryzen 3600 will work for the Ryzen 4xxx series CPUs with a firmware update. The Ryzen 5xxx CPUs will probably use a different socket, but the Ryzen 4xxx will be very affordable about 2 years from now when the Ryzen 5xxx CPUs start to ship. 
---
Any motherboard you purchase for the 9600K will need to be replaced in order to upgrade later.
---
It's okay, I finished the thing ages ago and it made me sad.
---
Uhm, mace is used for any kind of healing fb (pve or pvp), as an obligatory secondary weapon for pve warrior as long as any CC is involved (and warrior uses two of them) and for condi renegage. So it is used it pretty much every case where it could be used. 
---
On other had these 3.5 instances are literally all the cases, so mace isn't nearly as widespread as, lets say, sword (11 cases). And Moot is a very *special* mace anyway.
---
You will be fine with ANY laptop of the suggested laptop's pricerange.  
---
GW2 will run 60 on mid everywhere but heavily crowded zones.   
---
You mention a monitor at home to play with. What resolution does that run on?
---
^ This
---
Or at least they give you a mystic coin for doing 3-4 Pact missions
---
This. I saw EARTH magic IN THE AIR around Tequatl's head.
---
Folks have already covered gear, do you have a build? Which class do you play now and what content are you gearing up for?
---
~2,75 according to GW1 &amp; 2 wikis. Which sounds surprisingly small to me, I always assumed them to be 3+.
---
Yeah, thats what I wanted to know. If its once per map or not :P Thanks for the clarification!
---
Keep up the good work!
---
There are only 3 possibilities.
---
* You deleted your character and forgot you did it.
---
* Somebody else accessed your account and deleted your character. Could have been a hacker, could have been a pissed off EX or sibling.
---
* You created the character during a beta weekend event in 2015 and it was deleted at the end of the beta weekend just like all of the other beta weekend characters.
---
According to https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/gw2/Norn-height-GW1-vs-GW2, "A max height male Norn in GW2 is ~9.7 ft measured using in-game coordinates. According to lore, Norn average around 9 ft.". That's a maximum of about 3 meters and an average of 2.7 m.
---
Well, not every dungeon token has every attribute combination on this equipment. So if you want to get a specific attribute combination then you need to do that dungeon to get those tokens.
---
if you want to farm exotic just for the exotics then I wouldn't recommend it because there are probably much better ways to get money out of it.
---
Though, for fun sake, you can always do 8 different Dungeon paths and complete the "Dungeon Frequenter" achievement and get 5g each time.
---
So basically you are saying Asuras are Ferengi? HA! i know where you plagerized this idea from.
---
The only thing that comes to my mind is how they gonna improve story. Back when playing LS3 I thought it's super cool. Then PoF was better. Then LS4  came out and it was epic. What now?
---
This might be useful: http://i.imgur.com/kIo9z.jpg
---
That section of the story has been kind of buggy the last few times I ran it, skipping a few instances around the krait orb part of the timeline. They reshuffled the middle parts of the personal story a bit a while back as part of a new player experience, and it messed up more than it helped. It may be related to that. However, Sayeh appears in the story for everybody eventually, so that's not solid proof one way or another about which path you did, unfortunately.
---
One important thing to take into account, most of those B4xx/X4xx boards won't start if you plug a new Ryzen on them, they need a BIOS update before. That makes it a hassle, so be sure to either buy a mainboard that's already been updated (more and more sellers are offering such service for a small fee) or, worst case scenario, get one of those upgrade kits from AMD.
---
i use that as a finishing skill too x3 i scream "your soul is mine!" as the enemy falls lifeless to the ground then proceed to sheath my weapon and  laugh :) also any shout heals me, so i just scream at my enemies to feel better ;
---
At some point, probably. Raiders refuse to share their content and Anet has raid's priority somewhere at Zojja-level.
---
I am just still a little bit disappointed that firebrand tomes did not get the lovely old guardian elite tome book animations back, but instead just have pages floating around them...
---
Ah, so it would be harder to change the one's I mention than I expect.
---
Still, moving forward, I'd love it if Anet leaned a little bit less hard on "say byebye to your weapon, here's a new cool thing" for elite specs.
---
­&gt; E is my healing skill
---
Hell yeah! 🖐️
---
&gt; A is my elite skill
---
Hello No! 👎

1920 x 1080. How do you think it'd do with higher settings? I'd also get a cooling pad to help keep the CPU in check. I wouldn't be playing Guild Wars 2 on the go, just at home. The go part of mostly vevtorworks, Adobe, audio, that sort of thing.
---
Would be a balance change
---
Meanwhile, **Guardian,**
---
_**''SHOUTS AT YOU BACK TO HEALTH''**_
---
Because balance state, yes. 
---
If you dont play for that you have choices but they are meaningless and increasingly more negligible as you play with performant players. You can have few meaningful options or many meaningless options because the options arent balanced.
---
&gt; hope someone updates a written raid guide where not to put the damn buble
---
Do not put it not on the group.
---
I’m more annoyed by not having the actual book float in front of you anymore.
---
Ryzen 3600.
---
Well the idea for the upgrading is if a sorcerer gish starts with a greatsword and puts up a lot of fuss about never wanting to change, he will either have to use a non magical weapon or convince the DM to make it a +1 /+2 over the course of the campaign.
---
The sylvari one I am open to more balance suggestions, I do want to keep the benefit in direct sunlight to harden the plant theme. It is kind of like the reverse of Drow feature.
---
I do think it would be rare for a party to both short rest in the morning and in the evening, I find they just use spells and long rests, but agree it should be balanced for all forms of play. Maybe a limit of prof hit dice etc but that is already kind of inbuilt as you are likely to have half your hit dice already from long resting. 
---
Sorry open to more suggestions :-)
---
He's serious, but he's also a GW2 NPC...
---
_**''Another day, another gold piece''**_
---
Ahh but the sorcerer does not have proficiency with greatswords only with heirloom greatsword, as a balance method otherwise I think it is just tooo powerful for Gish, no Gish would use any other race, currently the effect diminishes as you level as it is left to the DM if they still let the character keep its martial weapon and heavy armor.
---
I like your first suggestion the most thank you, rather than time spent in direct sunlight, it is the actual act of resting in sunlight that gives benefit. This feature will hopefully balance to just around the strength of a darkvision or 3 Tools. Thanks again for the feedback, will link a draft 2 here sometime later.
---
I feel like silverwastes is the one map that I almost always see a LFG for lol. Maybe just my playtime hours being EST nights
---
That is true I kind of imply you have to research the difference between Inquest and College of statics if you are interested. 
---
But I think having nearly no difference is not too bad, it is how GW2 does it and the features are generally based off the elite skills of the MMO which don’t vary by your College except for Norn(kind of)
---
Happy to help :)
---
A correction: in the first case let it recover 2 hit points per dice spent. There's math behind it, so you can trust me u.u
---
CDPS Revenant uses one also
---
The awkward neck rub is fitting.
---
 So after a brief experience with GW2 at launch i fancy giving it another go to help my scratch that MMO itch.
---
Now i know the likelyhood is i won't make it to end game, so i want to make sure i pick a class where i'll get the most out of the leveling experience. I really enjoy doing dungeons and will be queuing at every opportunity while leveling. I would want to tank or heal, so happy to hear recommendations for both roles.
---
As for solo play, i really enjoy playing something that has high sustain and high complexity. I hate feeling squishy and i hate only pushing 2-3 buttons every mob I kill.
---
With the above in mind, what would you recommend as a class and to fill what role in dungeons? I currently don't plan to buy any of the expansions, unless there is a specific class unlocked through those that you really think would meet my criteria.
---
Thanks in advance!
---
That was the single best thing about old tomes.
---
I know, but interaction with those NPCs was limited to the spawner.
---
Don't get your hopes up at all. There are people who had 500-250 amounts of chests. Did not get a single infusion.
---
Anything that has infusions as a drop chance is stupid low as in all the players just 1 may get an infusion. It's not worth the gold/time sink unless you literally have nothing to lose.
---
Easiest way is to use the Black Lion Tradepost to purchase some exotic gear. There are filters for gear and stats, just make sure you set the item level to 80 and quality to exotic. You can get weapons and armour on there too, usually about 1-2g a piece for most things, though some weird stats are expensive.
---
Buy an ascended amulet from the laurel vendor in north west Lion's Arch (and other places) too, that's cheap to get and it's a big chunk of stats. Berserker stats are good if you're a power damage build, Viper stats are what you want for most condition damage, but Carrion will do in a pinch.
---
This is great!
---
They are dead wrong. SSD's never impact frame rates unless you've got a dying HDD bottlenecking load times to the point where feeding information to the GPU is limited. In which case it's no longer a bottlenecking issue but a hardware failure.  
---
CPU, GPU and RAM are what's required to push high framerates. The rest is irrelevant 99.9% of the time.
---
Charr have never had a desire to emulate humans. Literally any amount of reading about the race from official sources or research into the topic from content creators (as much as I don't personally like WP, he's arguably got some of the most in-depth videos about the GW1 story, for example) will dispel this head cannon of yours, with no debate necessary.
---
While in locomotion they can and choose to move on all fours, the reason Charr are upright is because, you know... they're a race of originally warmongering cats that use swords, axes, staves, throw magic fireballs and you *can't do that* if you walk on all fours all your life. It has literally nothing to do with human beings in *any* capacity. 
---
You also seem to have forgotten the bit where Charr, for a very good portion of their history, are *mortal enemies* with humanity and at war with them. There's no love lost between these races and Charr are certainly not spending their days trying to "emulate" humans.
---
I think I would have swapped the bonuses for Iron &amp; Blood, but otherwise that looks like a great conversion to P&amp;P.
---
That reminds me: The new Lizzo song is pretty good.
---
This is the vendor that sells dungeon gear: 
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Dungeon_Armor_and_Weapons
---
Look through the "items offered" list of dungeons, find a dungeon that gives gear that looks good and has good stats (if you're using a power build, for example, find one that gives berserker stats (power/ferocity/precision)). Then run that dungeon.
---
Mesmers are more viable in end game PvE but almost no end game PvE builds are ranged. Even if the build is ranged, you will be stacking within melee range of the boss anyway.
---
And the rest. People bought hundreds and thousands of them and in the ultimates sod's law, I bet you some guy who hadn't played for years, logged in and got a decent infusion after a few boxes lol 🤣
---
Flame legion elementalist charrs in gw1 were standing uprigth though.   
---
So I think they can stand like this(or at least some of them).
---
Honestly I have nothing to lose. I quit the game a little under a year ago and invested everything I had into ecto when it was about 15s each. Sitting on about 90 stacks. I reinstalled just for this update, lol. Love me some gambling. I'm sure I won't get anything, but it'll give me some dopamine tonight when I sit down to open them all
---
The chances of getting an infusion from them is less then the chances of winning the national lottery when it is in the billions.
---
To date only a couple people got them.
---
Its barely above 20k.
---
Even if it did get a numbers buff it still wouldn't be worth using as every healer has protection covered &amp; GS/scepter pulls nearly 10k ahead in benchmarks.
---
Hence why it and sword should really just get some changes.
---
Which times are you looking to do this at, relative to CEST? Just out of interest since it sounds like you aren't EU based currently?
---
It is also worth considering checking out The Crossroads Inn discord if you are looking to find people for helping with training.
---
My favorite spot is not yet in the game. It is very close to Lions Arch and is called Bergen Hot Springs. It is the spot which I went to in GW1 to tinker on builds.
---
 https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bergen_Hot_Springs
---
Afaik sword does more damage than scepter now?
---
Where human?
---
Wait, you can see the album?! i thought it was private! :O
---
You also gotta look at the clock speed of that benchmark.  The 9600k is only at 3.7Ghz.  When you are gaming it’s going to be at the Turbo boost speed at not at the base clock speed.
---
Phase 2, won’t be disappointed in number of options.
---
Look forward to it. Love the layout thank you :)
---
Ok I'm down to go all in with a sword Mesmer has the better spells and more of them?
---
Yeah I miss"spoke" by not at all. Meant to say for extended periods of time.
---
The fact that you can't even see how your comment could be interpreted sarcastically by the people you disagree with is a reflection of how narrow-minded you are.  Unreal.
---
alternate title: Mouse Child with the Moon
---
Community builds player retention. After a while, killing Tequatl for the 300th time, or killing Vale Guardian every monday, gets old. What keeps it fun is playing with your friends and joking on voice chat and guild chat. When the game tells you "community is pointless" you have a vast amount of players who don't join communities, and float away from the game with ease.
---
Lore wise or in game ?
---
In game they are quite a bit smaller then they are described in the books.
---
yea, the government is gonna jail them for like 10 years or something
---
good thing they abolished the death penalty in '96 or OP would be looking at a firing squad probably
---
Did the revolution of the earth change recently.  Or I'm missing a reference here ?
---
It'd be more accurate to summarize gold/hour as something like material/profit per hour.  You get X materials, and if you sell X materials later then you'll make gold.  Ectos, Wood, Leather, Trophy Crates (T5/T6 mats) etc etc

Well.. when using it specifically to bypass a limitation in the game I do have a feeling they might be more trigger happy.
---
I Wouldn't say fat.
---
Norn lore is supposed to be based on northern indo European lore and ideals so they are supposed to have much greater muscle mass &amp; much thicker bone structure.

They are basically the ubermench
---
I've sent you a message on reddit with the Discord details and also how to contact me in game. While I plan to be somewhat drunk after chasing Ralts in Pokémon Go and watching bad super hero films this Saturday, I can make myself available to help out on Friday as things stand.
---
I can't promise other people but might be able to magic up some if they are about and happy to help.
---
Other than that, I'm more than happy to come with you for a bit so you guys can get that kill! While I'm much better off staying on my Deadeye main as DPS, I can heal in a pinch if that helps your group.
---
Big if true.
---
You put such expressive details in this, I love it!

NCSoft: big layoffs and cancels all other ANet projects to refocus them solely on GW2.

&gt;	I think the wisest thing right now is to take a month off and invest in some other games
---
Its about his friend situation. Just VPN could'nt do that.
---
How on earth could this be a balance change
---
Then the recommendation is harder. Core game mesmer is kind of underwhelming in open world, while core game necromancer is still kind of viable. Neither class has viable core spec end game builds.
---
Then what's a good class to play without the expansions?
---
a lot of your problems aren't actually problems
---
trainings? there are discords for it, you can just post your own lfg, find a guild that does trainings etc.
---
not wanting to go through kc and escort again? "need xera opener 2g" there you go OP
---
placing the bubble? on..the..group..obviously
---
cmon
---
Yeah. But I think they already had the actual big talk planned/have already been planning it for a while (these things take a while to plan and refine, after all).
---
Where is this?  Don't recognize it even though I'm sure I've been there before.
---
ok.
---
How about if the products that are built around consumer exploitation simply fail instead?
---
Say what? Items in those slots aren’t consumed when crafting? No way.
---
My guess is that someone figured out a way to prevent the item from being used by keeping the right click menu open and clicking 'equip' before the recipe completes or something like that.
---
It won't matter now since it's disabled until fixed.
---
The problem is whether they properly punish those who exploited this, otherwise they won't inform through the proper channels instead exploiting it the next time someone figures out something like this.
---
Yeah was on the group, but at a point we had to move, didn't know it couldn't be in the middle.
---
We didn't plan on doing it so never actually watched a vid, just remembered what was in some of the written guides (watching youtube at work is a nono, reading text with diagrams seems to impress your boss).  
---
Anyway excuses probably make me seem like more of an idiot, if there was a GW2 TIFU I would be on it.

That's some hardcore twerking alright. The kind is measured in rpm.
---
_**This changes EVERYTHING!**_
---
DOUBLE HIGH FIVE! 🙌
---
probably a mesmer would be good for it, its got stealth, blinks, etc for getting around at to the places without encountering mobs and quickness for gathering quicker so you can move on sooner.
---
I like using my Daredevil Thief for this.
---
Any that can spam Quickness, like Firebrand.
---
It won't matter how much extra time you spend from kills, you'll save way more than that with +50% gathering speed.
---
I would happily pay for content. But Anet doesnt want my money.
---
I get that the 3600 and 9600k might be close in single thread performance \*at stock speeds\* 
---
But the whole point of a 9600K is that you can overclock it  to 5.0Ghz (or very close) 
---
That's a 20-25% performance boost over stock.
---
I have a 3600, with an RX580 and 16GB of RAM and the game barely skips a beat in heavily congested areas. In lions arch I am seeing between 45 and 60fps. Which is a tremendous improvement from my old R5 1400.
---
good summary, but it’s only sometimes a good idea to convert T5 to T6, [depending on market rates](https://gw2efficiency.com/currencies/spirit-shards)
---
Anet: We could either release an expansion, charge 30 dollars and be in the news like all the other games releasing expansions  or we stick to our silent and ree living world episodes. Hmmmmm...
---
That explains things a lot more thanks. I understand warrior is a bit simple so I'll give that a miss. If there's no point worrying about tank or healer then the only other thing I mention was complexity. If solo and leveling is less about face tanking, is there a class that is particularly mobile while also being quite complex?
---
Lootbox addicts provide more stable income
---
pls track your drops and post them here, its always interesting to see
---
Where is the drama tag? This isn't a question post.
---
I've never heard that.. but then again.. I used to do an emote dance to Lord Zomorros in hopes that he'd bless me with the shiny. :S
---
I really hate this tagging mechanic ala SW instead of something that promotes completion of the events cooperatively like in dragonstand
---
One of the big issues with GW2 is how little story-episode content actually makes it into the outside world.  If you go back to GW1 and pay attention they recycle textures very well.  In GW2 it feels like everything is unique and it probably adds a fair amount of development time (obsessing over perfection).  One of the main problems is GW2's choice not to recycle quality content.  
---
For example, you've got Istan &amp; Sunspear Great Hall vs. the Twilight Oasis Fractal.  Thematically, it makes great sense to bundle similar bits of content together.  It should save on time, energy, art-development -- but it's such an extremely rare choice for them..
---
yep
---
I once asked about a specific program and they gave a [very good answer about VPN](https://imgur.com/iTiLy4r).
---
yes, they're safe to use.
---
But they have been communicating lately. We can't use that as an argument unless we know about upcoming content that isn't being communicated.
---
Thieves, Elementalists and Mesmers are fairly mobile, and Elementalists and Mesmers are pretty complex. All 3 of these classes can be quite squishy and may bit slightly frustrating for people for people not prepared for it.
---
Even better, photon forge is a transform. Combat tonics are a big no-no.
---
There is also no reason people need to read or pay attention either. There is literally a window telling you it will become the base item if you lose it thats your fault.
---
Maybe have them earn it?
---
I think using a vpn for that should be fine..but there were cases were people got banned because they used a vpn used by other people who used cheats etc. the bans were of course lifted but is is an unnecessary hassle
---
I enjoy these. Not that I would ever run a GW2 themed campaign, but it's neat seeing the cross over.
---
People have to fundamentally enjoy the content to spend money on cosmetics though.
---
DF is better overall gold per hour but at the same time the loot comes in bursts, at the champ train at the end of the meta. And you have to farm keys during the pre events. SW still has the benefit of doling out loot slowly but steadily. So if you have limited playtime, SW is probably better.
---
90 stacks? That's 22500. My personal tip would be that you might be able to get 1 or 2 infusions of highest tier. There is a couple of low tier infusions and those drop pretty often (but are worth about 50-100g only).
---
Also try r/GuildWarsDyeJob
---
&gt;Bosses in the Boss Blitz group event have been rebalanced. **Their maximum health amounts have been reduced,**
---
Lame. I don't like when events are trivialized.
---
Well as per what they said near launch, they value players who don't spend a cent in the game as much as those who spend their money there. Because it makes the game alive enough for the paying players to come and stay.
---
So technically merely playing the game is enough of an incentive for ArenaNet to add more shinies for the paying customers that we help keep.
---
Should we stop playing then? Or maybe ask that future content is gated behind a paywall because we want to pay too?
---
not at all, the subrace abilities only apply when transformed - which only lasts 1 minute or when you no longer have temporary hit points (which isn't that much, only 25 at level 20).
---
They still need to be completed for you to get loot though. The only difference between DF and DS is 2 hour time limit to complete all event chains. Without it even in DS would be better to run around and tag events or do 1 lane at the time instead of all at once.
---
Doesn't this devalue the chests?
---
Actually, Thief with the right equipments are far better. Tekkit made an useful tutorial about it!
---
&gt; Bosses in the Boss Blitz group event have been rebalanced. Their maximum health amounts have been reduced, and they now have unique defiance bars that give boons to players fighting the other bosses when their defiance bars are broken.
---
Health bars are red. Break bars are blue. What's a CC? One,one,one,two!
---
Do not stand in front of the brainless loot train!
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Really? I'm pretty sad about it. That was like 50% of the reason why I key farm. Now we will just get more repair canisters...
---
Watch shit pugs try and break cc bars.
---
I'd add engi as another option that's potentially complex and has decent mobility.
---
Just desummon your minions and slot something else, I have no idea why anyone even uses them in open world. They keep you in combat forever.
---
inb4 raiders pretending they care about open world and claiming game is getting too easy
---
Would actually be:
---
a) fairer: Everybody contributing instead of a few "whales" (that btw dont even have to be rich, you know, just addicted)
---
b) more predictable: instead of hoping for the less reliable gemstore income, a subscription or DLC business model offers more stable income, making planning ahead easier - though imo thats a rather minor point, since MTX are prone to bring in more money
---
c) less predatory: the reason why MTX is such a popular business model is that the overall income is higher. Usually thats because you need way less developement costs for MTX (skins just arent content). At the same time, everybody is a gambler, thats just how humans are, how our brains work. Its not just lootboxes that activate the "reward, yay!" program in everybodys brains. Its also every skin you buy, especially those on "discount".
---
But its way faster to just insta-buy them than hoping for a drop from a chest no?
---
First of all, we are dealing with a game where the endgame should be in gathering vanity. By reserving the vanity for the cash shop, the endgame is certainly diminished.
---
Having said that, A.Net certainly hasn't been selling the vanity in a way that justifies the dismissive tone you are using.
---
Key farming is free
---
\-2/10 beyond the lowest effort to look like superman, at least get the colors right.
---
Oh shit I didn't know crown pavilion was also coming back, I love this event.
---
#Health bars are red. Break bars are blue. What's a CC? One,one,one,two!
---
Laser's Edge: Increased the maximum damage from 15% to 25% in PvE only.
---
Glass Cannon: Increased the damage bonus from 5% to 7%.
---
:feelshangman: ??????
---
&gt; claiming game is getting too easy
---
They aren't wrong
---
&gt;raiders
---
Nice targeted assumption lol
---
You can only have one action per click or it is not allowed.
---
lol
---
Yeah I know, but they are still not a certain drop. It seems faster to just farm the gold and get one when you need it.
---
Exactly, they're so high I feel like if someone got one everyone in game should be transported to them and forced to bow down.
---
I mean, not trivilized. Last year if you just dropped in a map I never got gold after the first few days. Even when people got tactic down.
---
It's a gift of condensed magic + might each too
---
i mean at that point you pretty much have to stand inside it regardless of boss position..the mistake is salvageable(assuming your timing was right)
---
it's just i have this overall idea you approach the raiding stuff in the wrong way, xera is considered a medium tier boss
---
Patch Size is: 218 MB
---
&gt;The Self-Style Hair Kit and the Total Makeover Kit are no longer available as drops in the Black Lion Chest
---
B-but... that's where I always get mine!
---
That's what's keeping me skeptical about this. There has to be a PoF route for these too.
---
That is funny.
---
Honestly i have like 100 of them thanks to keyfarming... why bother
---
Loooooooooooooool holy fuck omg
---
You can get legendary armor from pvp?
---
ah sorry, edited it in the post!
---
looooooooooool how out of touch is anet fucking lol
---
Bear Norn has double damage potential at lower levels, leopard has one of best rouge benefits, even if one minute it is a great power boost. All Norn subraces tower over any other subrace in combat potential.
---
Oh ye. You are not the only one :).
---
Chronomancer was released way back in 2015 with heart of thorns. I would recommend you try that expansion if you haven let yet :)
---
At least the wvw chestpiece has some effect to it.
---
Images hello?
---
Ah another daily gate stuff. I wish A-net did it like Skyscale collection and make it 5 pieces a set/ day so you dont have to carry too many stuffs.
---
i just sat in twitchchat with about 20 other skritts and we wondered when it would start
---
I’m not surprised. Anet has been going that direction with this game for years.
---
[This outfit wtf](https://i.imgur.com/5d2BJfm.jpg)
---
I don’t disagree with B, but A is not fair to the players who either can’t afford a sub or just don’t play enough to validate having a sub. One of the things I like about guild wars is that it is accessible. It is what got me into GW1 when I couldn’t afford a sub to WoW bc I was a teenager with no money. 
---
Also I don’t see how QoL items and skins are predatory, and I don’t see how other people’s inability to keep themselves from buying skins should lead to forcing other players to get subscriptions. that isn’t fair to players who are capable of not spending any money in the gem store.
---
&gt; New Faction Provisioners have arrived in the major cities, and they are seeking additional components and materials. Several items they offer have had their prices reduced.
---
From late notes
---
Thanks.
---
I thought that’s just how Bolstered Elements worked and I was like “why tf is this considered a good trait in all the PvP guides”
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/join-us-for-a-special-live-event-on-august-30/ was posted 3 days ago.
---
Your poor bastards...
---
Eh, I won't.  It was hard as hell to get on a map that kept going for awhile and did decently.  Maybe it can be more festivalish.  Chill and relaxing murder.
---
so does the pvp counter part. and for clarification: it's simply the T3 armors that have additional graphical effects, the upgrade to legendary has nothing to do with that.
---
Yeah, make not fun to play for rp reasons. No kits while in forge (which is fine) and no toolbelt skills AND damage to yourself when overheat. Sounds like fun.
---
How fast do you gold farm? Depending on the exchange rate it will take ~100g per total makeover kit. I know a lot of people brag about insane g/hour, but an average player would be doing great at 20g/hour. So we are talking ~5 hours per kit.
---
Key farming is 10 minutes a week, and you get a steady supply of kits, along with other useful things.
---
Overall, this change is a value lost for people like me.
---
We Breath of the Wild with that glider now?
---
Why fix it? When you can make $$$$$ instead.
---
Yes, the specific rule is that if you press/click one key/button then it should perform one action. But that rule was probably meant against bots and with gaming mice being much more wide spread they've probably eased up a bit on it and like I said if the mouse does the macro properly then they shouldn't even know. But a rule is a rule so you decide. Have you tried key binding skills to different keys?
---
Brb grabbing popcorn
---
I feel dumb
---
Oh I wasn't aware of that. I always thought it was only the legendary ones that had the effect. Guess I'm off grinding pvp then because I'm not going to spend like half a year going for the levels for wvw.
---
Where do you go to see what gifts are required?
---
Well what you said makes sense and I agree with you in that case but the way the guy I replied to worded it made it seem like he meant the word joke in a different context.
---
That's quality updates!
---
ohhh boyyyy. the first time i tried griffon challenge was on this map. I lost last event since i wasnt able to beat it, 
---
now im an expert griff pilot. HA!
---
You're helpless; continue living in that delusion.
---
Yup
---
You can get Legendary Armour from PvP.  The functionality, not the skins.
---
...there's a burger joint in Tyria now?
---
Anyone can link the new outfit and skins???
---
Well that sucks ass if true
---
You are right, they should also sell legendaries and ascended armor in the gem shop, much better to pander to sell gems, what could go wrong?
---
Skritt Happens! xD
---
From late patch notes
---
Same, I could never stomach buying them.
---
They really know what we like!
---
New Faction Provisioners have arrived in the major cities, and they are seeking additional components and materials. Several items they offer have had their prices reduced.
---
i see, well thank you for the info. i guess il change it to z,x,c then and use my thumb, hehe 
---
thank you again
---
Is the full recipe known?
---
You can already bypass most og gameplay by buying gold with money and then required components from tp. Its already happening, old news buddy.
---
Thanks. Just checked though and the craftsmanship gift is still 50. Bloodbound weapons are 10 now, down from 250.
---
You can also it get from WvW.
---
I'm sad others don't retain the opportunity to get them from chests, but it's a relief to not get hair kits. Still wish I could sell mine to those who want them.
---
Yeah I also put in milk before cereals and that other stupid crap. I kinda wanna see the world burn.
---
You are not alone in feeling this
---
&gt;The Self-Style Hair Kit and the Total Makeover Kit...
---
HAVE A NUMBER OF NEW HAIRSTYLES AVAILABLE?
---
&gt;...are no longer available as drops in the Black Lion Chest.
---
...
---
Its been a four years since everyone got new stuff...
---
It was a terrible mechanic when it was added to the game. It was worse when it was required for PvE legendary armour without any modifications to the system. And now they want to use it AGAIN for an already overpriced, non-cosmetic, minimal utility upgrade.
---
How do these decisions get past a studio of allegedly professional game designers?
---
Are they limited per-day purchases?
---
And we got one.
---
You can't buy ascended with gold only buddy, you need to play the game one way or another.
---
We meet again [Charged Quartz Crystals](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Charged_Quartz_Crystal)
---
That is a lot nicer than buying green itmes for the currency.
---
You can buy all tier 1 legendaries for $400 or less.
---
interesting. thanks
---
&gt; unique defiance bars that give boons to players fighting the other bosses when their defiance bars are broken.
---
Is it odd I find this curious enough to check out the boss blitz? Not sure it'll change the zerg tendency, but I like where that's going.
---
Different skins though.
---
There would be less confusion is people got used to the ISO 8601 date format: 2019-08-30.
---
Yes. You need to play ranked during season, though. Tha will give you season tickets that are for buying one of the gifts, then you need some of the pvp shards, do the reward track , then it is about having T6 materials and clovers (that's standard for legendaries though), and buy ascended version of armor as precursor. Grandmaster marks for it also drop from pvp. [All parts there](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Legendary_armor#PvP_Components)
---
However, it is timegated as you can get just certain amount of tickets (110) if you do all the pip chests in a season. So you might need multiple seasons to do whole set (you need 300 tickets), if you start from zero. Seasons are for like 2 months so it might take even half a year. But if you already played decent amount of pvp, you might have good chunks of tickets already. Mystic clovers are easily to get from reward tracks as well. Overall whole cost is like 350 gold per piece, but if you play various content you should be getting most of materials accumulated in your material storage. 
---
WvW armor needs tickets from WvW pips, there if you get all of them each week you still need 25+ weeks. So ye, it is definitely taking more time than in raids, but it still is viable way to go, especially when many players just play a lot and don't know what to do with those currencies yet.
---
And who are you now? The downvote police?
---
Start a discussion and one or both sides always getting downvotes. Votes doesn't mean anything here. ;)
---
Groups. And usually there’s old vets running those for fun and you can just tag along they never mind.
---
Now that's just hilarious.
---
To the top with this, not having to do the nonsense running around thing after crafting the weapons makes these much easier to deal with.
---
C O C K    A R M O R
---
Too obvious bait.
---
&gt;I'm sure there are casual/semi casual players who are also going on break or leaving the game entirely.
---
Das me.
---
On behalf of Anet.
---
Thanks for support us and keep the server running.
---
&gt; You are right, they should also sell legendaries in the gem shop. 
---
Well... gems to gold, buy eternity from the tp.
---
of course it is, but someone took it deep
---
tf you have waited for a good raptor skin for almost two years and u still haven’t got it 
---
why is it always raptor
---
That's a lot more reasonable for the weapons. Almost makes me want to get one, if I had any sub-80 classes any more
---
absolutely, unless you don’t use them
---
Probably not. It really depends how many keys you'd need to get a perma kit. If it's more than a dozen keys, and it is, the 150g is faster.
---
I don't have unrealistic expectations , I understand thep roblem with syntetic benchmarks.
---
But I can check any old review of hw from major websites ( guru3d and simillar ) and numbers will be "ok".
---
I check passmark numbers and they were since it's inception completly upside down.
---
It's a "value" gained for anet. More people converting gold to gems, more whales spending that $$$$$ on gold.
---
why didn't you wait for some previews on youtube?
---
What the fuck is this shit lmao
---
Yeah one of each. I'm curious if they switch on reset. Black Citadel offers one for an obsidian shard for instance, which seems pretty good compared to other offers.
---
looks bad on male
---
What if i want a backpack or trinket?
---
They used their staves to balance themselves tall.
---
It's glowy
---
looks like unused assets from upcoming Marvel's Eternals movie.
---
A couple times a year, everyone in the community is shocked and appalled to discover that charged quartz is still valuable and worth making.
---
Is it normal that I have already unlocked all the achievements? Aren't they supposed to be reset?
---
Intergalactic chastity belt
---
Can you please post here the female version?
---
Anet, if you must have the Pact Provisioners timegate these tokens, then at least scrap all of them except 1 merchant, who trades for the *materials* these crafted items require, and let us buy a week's worth in one go or something.
---
No charms or symbols. Okay thanks
---
I think it's a great change. After all, you can still get them with statuettes
---
this is beyond idiocy anet...
---
Don't get me wrong, I really like the look of it - that's why I immediately bought it. However, it's not that different from the regular (cheap?) skins, and I think it's technically inferior to the other 2000-gem skins.
---
I was just pretending to be retarded XD
---
Looks like they're just selling an infusion with some glued on armor pieces.  Pass.
---
Subjective, I love Dreadnought, Primordial, salamander, bog hunter, and luminous prowler.
---
You most likely need them to make motes.
---
Bullshit. You are arguing semantics to justify standing up for an subject that is much more powerful than the consumer and they have been using that power at the expense of the consumer.
---
Of course A.Net is allowed to do this: THAT'S THE WHOLE FUCKING PROBLEM.
---
&gt; Bloodbound weapons are 10 now
---
Took them only almost 5 years.
---
Maybe in crafting the Mystic Motes/Aspects. I haven't found a recipe for them yet. And as they are rare drops from the Satchels (which will be a limited time item I assume) and you need 75 of them there must be a recipe (or will be soon), which will probably include charms/symbols.
---
what about 2k beetle skin? the pangolin? I think it's similar in design, low on flashy effects, but still changes the model of the mount
---
Still no update to the mini claim tickets :(
---
https://imgur.com/a/xZUNPle
---
Is that what we call diapers now?
---
no
---
if you craft a legendary sigil you're gonna need somewhere to put it, wouldn't be fair charging you another 250 tokens :^)
---
&gt; Yeah, make holo not fun to play for rp reasons.
---
Without going into whether the change was good or bad, this is wrong. It wasn't for RP reasons, they've been rebalancing elite specs to make them all give something up compared to core specs so they're not straight upgrades anymore.
---
Soo umm, we cant give you nice textures on your celestial infusion.. but wait, here sex space man outfit! Skritt will love you!
---
I know it's not a great answer, but the one upside is adding new provisioners reduces the timegate directly...  :/
---
where's hint and why hasn't he benched yet :feelshangman:
---
You will get 300 provisioner tokens before you get the money for 6 upgrades.
---
Super bummed about this. I should’ve been farming before! I really want some hair kits. Is the patch already live or is there any chance I’d be able to find some when I get home this evening?
---
Weird here both the 3600 and the 9600k had simillar singlethread cinebench scores.
---
But I woudn't be surprised , 3x00 is really a step up from AMD.
---
Once you finally can fully customize them there will be no more reason to carry 27 axes and greatswords in the first place.
---
Choices.
---
I admit that looks nice for female characters. It's just very weird for male characters then.
---
Key farming doesn't even guarantee a drop.
---
Next time preview it in your hero panel
---
30 clovers for ONE FUCKING RUNE? Haha hell no. That’s twice as much as armor!
---
Just opened 50 BLC and got 1 rare.. FeelsBad
---
I have never purchased a 2k mount skin. But I'm stupid enough to spunk gems on keys lol
---
Just bought 50 BLC keys and got 1 rare with was soaring hammer FeelsBad
---
Oh sorry I'm blind :x
---
200-250g for the might/magic, 50 provisioner tokens (around 5 days time gate), and 30 clovers (plus whatever the other mats cost) for one rune/sigil. The gold, ok; but reusing the worst HoT currency (provisioner tokens) and 30 clovers per? WTF.
---
Looks good on female characters. Too bad it's not an armor set.
---
Dealing damage to yourself isn't much of a straight upgrade imo
---
but nowhere has ever said it was on 30th July o.0
---
Looks like a metal diaper on a Ken doll for males. Also that helmet...
---
Some recipes are locked till the donation-event is done, guess you need this recipes to craft the items.
---
fam i feel like you played yourself here
---
Daily account bound items are unlimited. Meaning Charged Quartz, Mithrillium, etc.
---
You can only craft one per day of each, so you only benefit if you already had some beforehand.
---
So how much gold are we looking at per piece?
---
looks like it's time to take the furnace again...
---
You can buy as many as you want with charged quarzcrystals,  Spool of Silk Weaving Threads, Lump of Mithrillium,  Glob of Elder Spirit Residue.
---
I just hit lvl 80, what city are they showing in this video with all the flags and such...it looks cool!
---
I wish I had that much dedication for a single character, props :D
---
Anybody have pictures of the new decorations yet?
---
In lore they are taller than ingame. Like closer to 4 meters taller.
---
Star Porn outfit.
---
Porn star outfit.
---
theres still an undisovered gift that will most likely use them.
---
Yeah, and people didn't give a fuck about it since they still wanted to clear it, and figured out they could autotarget aoes on self to get around the bug.
---
Time to wait for Hobbs to unlock the Mote/Aspect recipes.
---
Neat, "my hands are on fire" is going to be a skin.
---
The new raptor skin looks so damn cute.
---
I'm fine with it, fight me
---
"Boss Blitz that failed despite a massive coordinated zerg because one person went to the wrong boss. you'll not be missed."
---
Fixed a typo in that title for you.
---
Oh god, I hated this mechanic so much. I can't believe they're doing it again.
---
holly shit thats retarded
---
thats like what? 300g for a rune?
---
The damage was negligible enough that it did not make a difference, especially not in organized content with a healer who had your back, and the meta trait even reduced that damage and encouraged you to overload as often as possible. Plus, overloading is optional, so if there were ever a situation where you were under too much pressure to overload, you could choose not to, it's not like the spec forced you to hurt yourself. 
---
It was a straight upgrade. Now, overloading has a consequence that is real and important. I don't play engineer much so I can't really say if it's a good change or not, I said that from the start I wasn't defending the specific change but just arguing with the idea that the change was for "RP purposes". That's just nutty and wrong.
---
I don't even...
---
I just hope I don't get this when I open a Black Lion chest. I only ever get rares/uncommons of items I don't like and will never use, and this outfit falls under that.
---
You never played holo did you? This change is garbage and single handedly destroyed holo in raid due to dps lost
---
So you need 50 Provisioner Tokens for a [Gift of Craftsmanship](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Craftsmanship), which seems to be needed for each Legendary Rune and Sigil.
---
I wonder how many idiots are gonna make these :^)
---
Lol that's probably true. I dunno, people in this sub have been saying gw2 just functions differently for some reason. Dunno why
---
Heh... fixing ingame rewards, that's funny.
---
We can finally leave the gw2 starter zone.
---
You're right, I never played holo in raids. Note how that's not at all relevant to what I said. The change was not made for "RP purposes", period. By all means, argue with someone else about how they should have gone about making holo less of a straight upgrade compared to core engie, I don't know and I didn't say that I knew. I just said that your characterization of the reasons for the change were ridiculous.
---
I get you're upset about it. I'm sorry your build doesn't feel as good anymore. Doesn't mean lies are going to help you here.
---
Anyone has an idea where you can get the recipe for mystic motes?
---
But...perfectionism...
---
To be fair it has to be ridiculously expensive or else regular rune market just crashes.
---
Don't expect this feature to be a target for anyone other than the top 0.0001%
---
I'm genuinely not arguing about the pros and cons of the nerf, I do not see why this is a difficult concept to understand.
---
NEVER!
---
This isn’t a city. It’s an special area which you can enter via hot air balloons in the capital cities.
---
&gt; Note how that's not at all relevant to what I said.

It is. In raids there are cc bars that you have to break asap.
---
Cant buy the Stachels of Loot? With craftsman you mean the npcs next to teh crafting stations?
---
Why would they ever? Within an hour I already see at least 7 human females in Mistlock strutting around in the newest shiny bikini outfit.
---
Money talks.
---
&gt; [&amp;AgF2ZQEA] 	Satchel of Loot
---
hmmm
---
will probably be unlocked, once we donated enough lucents
---
What limitation would a vpn bypass other than a region lock though? It's not giving you any special advantage over anyone else.
---
And it doesn't have a search bar.
---
And they missed the opportunity to allow multiple items to be changed at the same time.
---
And you have to confirm it EVERY TIME.
---
And it is more scrolling than before.
---
And...
---
I solve practical problems, for instance: how am I going to stop some mean mother Hubbard from tearing me a structurally superfluous be-hind? The answer, use a gun, and if that don't work... Use more gun.
---
Could have pushed for 1:23 or even 1:22 if I cleaned up my movement.
---
Also, if you can, don't race during boss bash. Fps sucks and you'll get knocked around with their special abilities
---
It’ll take about nine months for just the armor, due to the off seasons in between. Took just over a year to finish full PvP armor and backpack.
---
thanks
---
He's talking about being able to exchange 60 Black Lion Statuettes for certain skins. In all honesty, being able to get skins without RNG just by doing your keyruns every week is actually a good thing and probably the most from predatory it could ever be.
---
7 years to add build templates
---
7 more years to unlock the gear for it : )
---
2457 called and wants their look back girl! 💁🏼
---
Those skins will rotate into the Black Lion Exclusives chest anyway, and the 60 statuettes is just a failsafe for if you don't get them within chests. You also don't need 60 chests to get 60 statuettes in the first place.
---
&gt; Where will I go now when I want to verbally abuse people in map chat for not instantly knowing mechanics that I've spend seven years mastering?
---
How about /r/outside? You could get an education, a wife, start a career and family, buy a house and start paying the mortgage.
---
Please come back in 7 years and let us know if your desire for a challenge has been met.
---
What market? There are only like a handful of runes that are worth using and half of it is untradable.
---
Yes
---
900? Oh sweet summer child...
---
Ok you're the Heavy after he stole the Engineer's wrench.
---
ITS NOT ALPHABETICAL, I spend like 2 minuits lookin for diviners before a static in voice went "its at the bottom dude" like wtf.
---
Because they aren't mandatory. If they made us get them sure but its a choice players make.
---
Satchel of Loot code is actually a legendary Superior Rune of the Soulbeast
---
Nice try market mAnIpUlAtOr.
---
It has to be in Lion's Arch too.
---
Well they were all available before. They are bringing them back for 60 statuettes. And for that matter you can get more then 1 statuette per chest, bad odds but can happen. And has far as the weekly key farm that's over a years worth.
---
Have you ever played weaver in raids?
---
Would be nice if they added LS4 vendor too.
---
to be fair my holo is the biggest size available for a norn so, not wrong
---
9600k can't even compete with 2600 when it comes to 1% and 0.1% frame rates even OCed due to 6c/6t nature.
---
9600k: Higher TOP frame rate, frame drops all over the place, a lot more expensive because you need to OC it to benefit from it and buy a cooler too.
---
3600: 2-3% lower top frame rates, stable and better 1% and 0.1%s, less expensive due to mobo prices + comes with a cooler easily enough to OC it moderately. And you won't be afraid to keep a program open on background :)
---
9600k is really bad for your money unless you are already on the platform and have a mobo+cooler.
---
That sword look CANTHA!!!!
---
&gt; Mystic Forge Stone
---
Finally a use for my 500+...
---
I see no wings.
---
This is a weeklies vendor, not a LS3 one. It will reset every week. And we do have an LS4 vendor at Dragonfall that doesnt reset. You can get LS4 currencies daily there.
---
Of *course* we're getting a high resolution space effect on an outfit before they fix the super-compressed one on the Celestial Infusion.
---
Really sad that the expansions didn't go on sale, was really hoping to pick them up.
---
Schick :D
---
Oh crap, forgive me sempai
---
LWS5 prediction: We're going to space!
---
People wanted swimsuits so they just got shiny ones!! Lol
---
it's seems to be doing that weird thing where it lists the stats in order of core game-HoT-PoF. PvP does this too with the runes and it's so annoying. at the very least alphabetical would be easier to navigate, but I'm assuming it's 3 different databases that got smushed together into an interface
---
&gt;Laser Edge Buff
---
Appreciated, but still, please fix Photonic Blasting Module, Anet. If I take this trait, its because Overheating is intended as a part of my playstyle. I exchange the ability to passively lower my heat (and gain Heat Therapy) without Overheating and intentionally locking myself out of forge once I go over the threshold... in exchange for the extra damage, locking Laser's Edge and keeping my toolbelt active while cooling down.
---
Please and thank you. :)

Thanks for this!!

You don't get that from loot boxes though.
---
Sadly it's once a day.
---
Yep, aren't you glad that's all behind you though?
---
&gt; If it's more than a dozen keys, and it is
---
[At maximum it would be 10](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Total_Makeover_Kit).
---
Where are these?
---
So they remade the Zodiac armor as an outfit, but you can dye the blue parts.
---
But we can't dye the blue parts on Zodiac armor. Really Anet?
---
I got really confused and checked again too. I felt like an idiot, lol.
---
Gotta keep those log-in numbers up somehow!
---
I mean, should every event in open world always award gold?
---
EXPOSED
---
You're telling me you have a legendary water helm
---
Not for Dusty-buns and Suzie.
---
Why fix something people already paid money for, when you can double dip?
---
Why fix something people earn ingame, when you can get people to gamble on BLC?
---
And you know the reason why - cause it's only been an hour and there's already a ton of people running around in the new shiny micro bikini.
---
I also disagree, it's not dumb, it's smart - they know exactly what they're doing.
---
Opinions are completely irrelevant. We are completely irrelevant. They will make a shit ton of money.
---
I hate the outfit, not so much aesthetically, but what it stands for.
---
You can completely ignore the legendary rune/sigil mail, it's of little consequence except for very few rich people that already basically have everything.
---
As for the event, just go to the queen's pavilion and to the labyrinthine cliffs and hang out, look around, do some events (check achievements). It's fun for a while at least :)
---
So its currently available for purchase with bl statues right? I cant get into the game right now to check. In any case the skins was first introduced as only attainable via rng from bl chests (like many skins) so if you get lucky sweet if not you gotta wait until it rotates in a couple months after its initial release to buy it with bl statues.
---
ya, i just found that out the old fashioned way :(
---
Whether or not the rewards are "good" is subjective, but many of them are unique and fairly cool so it's probably worth your time. You probably don't have to worry about the legendary stuff just yet, and if you're new you likely don't have the Masteries required for them regardless.
---
&gt; zerg tendency
---
Really? Nearly every time I checked the people were splitting into 3-4 groups that only zerged up near the end.
---
Everything looks great....except that fucking helmet looks atrocious. Good thing you can disable head pieces.
---
Faceless teletubbies O_O
---
This reminds me of saint row 3 [dlc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmE5J6yj360).
---
Why not?
---
Fun fact, the 900 pack of ten keys and ticket scraps they just had in the gem store wasn't banned in belgium
---
100% pass
---
The decision to lock out the utility belt really messes with holo rotations. Classes aren't just DPS, it *feels* bad playing an engineer and working these skills in to really any style of play is very akward.
---
That's the main complaint engie players have, similar to the chrono shatter change, it just messes too much with the mechanics of playing the class - with no real balancing rationale.
---
It's like if they locked berserker out of weapon swapping until berserk mode is off cooldown.
---
I like his star diaper
---
Oh I am glad that they are gone..I have to much..I hope someday we can exchange them for statues
---

---
ignore the legendary stuff. its to early for you to even bother.
---
you can find the rewards and what the festival offers here: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Festival_of_the_Four_Winds_2018
---
its mostly cosmetic and novelty stuff. its also good for getting a good amount of achievement points. its just something to break the circle of just leveling and grinding.
---
 Starborn Outfit you can get this from chest now!  
---
mayve next week on tp?
---
Many minion builds are good for low effort gameplay as you are tanky af with all the little minions running around holding aggro for you. Plus you can pretty much afk while the minions do most of the work killing things. Ofcourse it does come with down sides like you pointed out.
---
Pretty sure that'd be almost 4, not 5.
---
Not a single charged quartz ? Oo
---
Those are basically free.
---
Seems like they added expensive ways (daily crafted things from t5 mats) for the impatient and basically free ones for the patient.
---
Especially the Auric Ingot. I used to farm Tarir so have like a stack of them... And even to make them is easy.
---
I mean... Idc about stars, have you seen the 2012 armor sets??  They have like 1/4 of the amount of polygons other armors have! Like the acolyte set, to name one.
---
Star porn porn star outfit! ^(diaper fetish included)
---
Too many people making the same mistake. I am pretty sure we got Mandela Effect'ed on this.
---
Thanks, I haven't been able to take a look yet but another sigil/rune sink sounds great!
---
Charrbucks
---
Materials sink of less used materials. This is good! THIS IS GOOD!!!
---
Props to the economists and designers who came up with this.
---
the downside: krait weapons go down on value.
---
GW2 is about all I play.  I’m looking to upgrade my CPU too and was waiting for Ryzen, but after looking into it I’m going to go Intel now that the prices are coming down.
---
New hairstyles incoming so they want to burn whats left in our banks before.
---
?
---
&gt; ITS NOT ALPHABETICAL,
---
Maybe sorted by release date?
---
These items were perfect to have since this game really revolves around having multiple characters. Having to purchase gems each time for something under $5 is quite silly and these gave us altaholics something usable out of all the other useless BLC drops.
---
9600k oc to 5.0 means 250 (cpu) + 100 (on sale atm!) (mobo) + 60 (good cooler) = 410 USD
---
3600 is 200 USD, can easily be moderately OCed with base boards that cost $70 and stock cooler is more than enough for it too. = 270 USD
---
That 140 USD difference is big and at that point makes no sense to compare the two. That said, 3600 still gives better frame rates when it comes to stability in gaming than 9600k @ 5.0. That is of course unless run your computer as a benchmark unit so nothing else really uses your CPU.
---
Mithril cockpiece
---
Can't dye legendary armor glow though because "IT'S TOO COMPLICATED!!!!!11!1!!ONE!!!"
---
Each of those are only 100g each? That's really not that bad lol
---
https://gw2efficiency.com/account/home-nodes
---
About 6,5 k Gold.
---
Consume to add them to your wallet
---
Runes are used in sets of 6. Assuming 300 per rune, that's 1800 for a full set.
---
Remember that there are no visuals associated with legendary runes, only QoL. Literally selling QoL-only features at the cost of *days* worth of grinding.
---
Consume them. They were converted to wallet currency some time ago.
---
&gt; There is something FAST, invisible, that can go in/out of buildings and gather nodes/chest/anything without the need to engage?
---
Dont be afraid to engage mobs first when node harvesting or getting chest or w/e. Being stealthy can work but of you get in combat you still have to kill things or run far away to get ooc which depending where you are trying to cheese things with stealth can just net you more mob aggro. Also if your goal is to move around quickly drop the minions learn how your class deals dmg so you can quickly grp up and burst down packs of mobs.
---
Oooh, new guild decorations?
---
Did you put them in your wallet?  Because they're walletable as per an update or so ago.
---
Neither tokens that I deposited in the wallet. Guild NPC unable to see them as well, I reported about it before the patch. Like 2 weeks prior..
---
Where we droppin', boys?
---
Finally, a premium raptor skin that I like.
---
I'll probably pick up a staff for by key running guardian.  Sometimes I only run the first key, sometimes I'm in the mood to all of them.  But, I can't think of any other niche.
---
well memed
---
How can you get the outfit? Chest or tp?
---
Maybe next week on tp?
---
Let's not be any more hyperbolic than strictly necessary - there's certainly room for improvement here, but it hardly qualifies as "really horrible." All it really needs is a search function, and maybe some sorting options and/or a way to collapse the various categories of Stat set/upgrade for easier navigation. Everything else seems perfectly serviceable to me, maybe even an improvement over the old system in some areas.
---
Five! 
---
Five posters who can't read! 
---
*Ah! Ah! Ah!*
---
Agreed.  Intel only has a small advantage now on the high-end with gaming.  For everything else Ryzen is better.
---
Thanks!
---
Any have/found a compiled list of all the different things you can trade for them now?
---
Anet heard your complaints and shoved it into the gemstore
---
It's a YMMV issue.  I'd rather get items with value, and I hated getting kits.  I'd rather get the 1g trash item than a kit because it's always a hair kits and who is the madman who doesn't need a face change or eye color?  Ten hair kits that could have been dyes, minis, etc...
---
Glad that I'm not the only one. On the other hand I completely forgot about Pavilion/Cliffs.
---
Lol ripped from the headlines  😂🤣
---
2019-2015 = hard math
---
Just wanted another option to farm LS4 materials aside from doing same hearts every day.
---
It's just hard to justify farming gold when 10 minutes of real world work is equivalent to 10 hours of grind
---
BL chest drop only for now since it's brand new
---
girl bye
---
I have 174...this is a good change.
---
Closest one we have. LS3 was also long ago, they realize LS4 is more recent and fresh and they still want people to play those maps (ideally play all maps including LS3) but yeah. Thats all there is for now.
---
I know the males of Tyria are ken dolls and most armor shows no bulge, but come on.
---
They only announced the first few days of anniversary sales. There are different sales every day. Give it a week or two.
---
I never attempted to cosplay as Superman lmao I was just pointing it for the way he was posing
---
Need ingame pictures!
---
I know. I meant what's sarcastic about my post?
---
It's a thing of beauty how they managed to break so many things in the last 2 patches XD
---
the only thing it needs is a fav option
---
It's not just a single character sadly :eyes:
---
That would be nice as well, yes.
---
Yeah... too bad that the Endless Upgrade Extractor is still more expensive than a full set of legendary runes. And that you still have to carry a bunch of runes in your inventory to be as flexible as with the legendaries. ;)
---
PS. Don't take is too serious, both ways are expensive
---
There was no attempt to look like superman I was referring to the way he posed.
---
Saw tPot open 4 or 5k boxes on stream (roughly 1k gold), he lost 90%.
---
You're thinking of dick sponge
---
You're assuming anyone aside from the 2 PvP devs loked in the basement know that PvP exists at Anet
---
The Extractor in a shared inv slot is basically legendary runes/sigil for all your characters.
---
No shit, I'm just pointing out that the guy you originally replied to has a point and that your comparison is useless. This festival weekly vendor is only comparable to other festival weekly vendors. I wish we had a season 4 vendor in addition to - or instead of - season 3 as well.
---
You can buy more as long as the currency is daily capped. So if you have stockpiled things you can unload them. Like charged quarz or asended crafting components.
---
I tend to need the TMK more often, too but now that I can't get my hands on them.. feels like a really low blow.
---
Now if only they got rid of the even more useless thing like the repair canisters.
---
I think I missed something. What is this?
---
and all your exotic runes will fit into your shared slots as well?
---
You can open it by double-clicking the item.
---
I will ask about Malyck. This guy is one of the only interesting story parts and they left him for dead.
---
I am wearing the cone of shame on our discord for being hyped and talking about it non stop today...
---
Not at all trying to be a jerk, just curious what word on it you're waiting for?
---
If it's about undoing some of the damage from the last balance patch, history with balancing suggests we might not see a change til the next balance patch rolls around unfortunately.
---
But you still have to have all runes (you use) on every char, which is a lot of inventory space. 
---
I mean you could take the legendary runes in your shared slot too, right?
---
 Your collection is worth 5,415 *g* 11 *s*, and you would need 1,333 *g* 24 *s* to complete it.  (Only missing the enchanted treasure chest).
---
Better than the current interface for sure.
---
i hope derpy moa has an above average day
---
rip derpy, ur in a better place now.  ^^^^^^FF14
---
If only!
---
I'll join the club
---
What about the piles of lucent crystals from a few days ago?
---
and it seems like items within the same rarity doesn't have equal chances so all of the drop rate increase could have been shifted to something else that is just as bad or even worse
---
It's worth it...if you suffer from OCD.
---
[2 dye channels. example is in full white, red, blue, green](https://i.gyazo.com/aadf4e376812457444c0fd79b27b98e0.png)
---
&gt; A player who has the resources and expansions to buy them probably has a good supply of experience scrolls and tomes to skip the level-up process entirely, and these weapons have zero use once you're at max level.
---
Or the minimal amount of total Gold to just buy Masterwork/Fine gear off the TP ever 10 levels and skip this hassle all together. Buying items at 11/21/31/etc actually saves you in the long run as those are cheaper than the on 10 levels on everything but breathers, which don't exist and you get through leveling up anyway, and accessories of which there are cheap on 10 versions.
---
Plus why would you ever stat swap them to begin with? Just go straight Zerker and then just ignore the weapons all together as you'll only need other things once you get to 80.
---
Is it available for purchase? They need to release a boot version!
---
This is easily my #1 question. I would LOVE some resolution here.
---
Looks like to get more Satchels you repeat the "Legendary Benefactor" infinite achievement. [This guy did 1000 openings](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/cjusk0/1000_satchel_of_loot_drops_value_spreadsheet/).
---
1:24
---
You want more nerfs?
---
yeah thats gonna be a nope from me dawg.
---
Maybe anet could add those runes and sigils to be obtainable in wvw then that would be fine. Im not gonna run around hot maps like a fucking reeree for a month....
---
Distinct Teletubbies vibe going on there.
---
celestial in general. both version are like 144p
---
Home nodes guarantee 3 map currency. Wild nodes don't guarantee even 1 per three strikes.
---
If you mine a home instance blood Ruby you'll get three, if you mine one in bloodstone fen you may get anywhere from 0-3
---
If we go by the less armor = more protection logic this will render you invincible!!
---
First a pass on Coalescence and now a pass on these runes/sigils. Feels like the game is simply just not offering much for me at this point.
---
That's the point of gambling.
---
Oof
---
Thanks for saving the rest of us from making the same mistake!
---
$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$
---
you need to let go, man
---
Don't worry, they'll update it as QOL change in 2023 and everyone will shower them with praise for it!
---
Cosmic Codpiece
---
Dye it flesh colored, then you’re just a sparkling stripper.
---
Do you buy celestial infusions with gems?
---
Black Lion Chest exclusives are never on the TP or gemstore.
---
Half of everything Zephyrite does. Half of them are literally of Canthan descent.
---
This is old news. 6 years old news.
---
*laughs in legendary armor dye channel fix*
---
Something tells me anet needs money, and quick
---
Yeah, because Cantha was confirmed 6 years ago when the Zephyrites, half of which are of Canthan descent, were introduced to the game.
---
The greatsword confirms Cantha as much as the Ancestral Outfit or Imperial Outfit did.
---
That is because firebrands are ripping pages out of tomes use those skills. The tomes aren't there because those assholes destroyed them during the casting process.
---
&gt;I was pretty shocked at how worthless everything already is compared to last year.
---
Well I'm shocked that you're shocked, expecting Anet to change anything.
---
It's funny how people haven't learned their lesson yet when it comes to the rewards system here.
---
Given the image by op, they'll be gemstore. Likely added next week alongside the greatsword.
---
The point is that celestial infusions are a really cool infusion that requires you to either play the content or pay a ton of gold for. Or do gems to gold but that’s expensive irl. That’s the trade off. It promotes you to actually like...play the game. This doesn’t. It’s celestial infusion and zodiac skin combined as a cash grab because, why play the content now when I can just buy this? It’s stupid.
---
https://imgur.com/a/CTZ8cAF The ship is fairly impressive, not a fan of the water pot because of the way you apply it on a surface :/
---
Ugh, I don't use my raptor, I don't want to spend 2k on a skin, I don't need it ^Idon't^need^it
---
My God your version is so much better than the one anet implemented. How on earth did they make legendary stat swapping worse than before?!
---
The new backpack from the BLC has literally the same model as the jade rifle, but with wings and a tail.
---
There are also new tabs at the 3 usual Provisioners with the following items as currency (1 of each/day max.):  
---
* VB: 1 Reclaimed plate
---
* AB: 1 Auric Ingot
---
* TD: 1 Chak Egg
---
Welp my first question about possible tengu playable race and future involvement in the living world got deleted in record time xD
---
One thing that I have learned about GW2, there is a lot of content that gets created and then never touched again. I still don’t understand why the dungeon system and fractal system were ever separate systems, especially since they put all their love and attention into fractals and dumped dungeons.
---
I hope not. For a game that's really into fashion wars I'm disappointed how hard it is to change even just hair color without a kit
---
It's all for fun! \\o/
---
In reality those people are just more likely to make posts about their drop.
---
But this time lighting your hand on fire really isn't a torch!
---
Take that Ozzy!
---
Yep. At most they end up in the black lion statuette rotation.
---
Buy it from the Trading Post, it will run you around \~12-15g or so.
---
Soldier's gear is probably better if you die alot, it is +Power, +Toughness, +Vitality, focused on helping you survive
---
Filter by Exotic, and 80-80 level range. If it's too expensive run lower level exotic gear 75+ or rare 80 gear
---
I knew things tanked pretty hard before for other festivals, but man these crashed hard and fast.
---
&gt;it's NOT WORTH IT.
---
It is if Anet's plan was to reiterate what happened with the mithril ingot event.
---
And with that I leave you this;
---
https://youtu.be/oTLD-OJJ1Vk
---
How do you get these? I can't find them in the shop
---
There is
---
It'll take 6 months though, minimum.
---
I saw a 1:24 for the one in the pavilion, but the skimmer one? That's nuts. Pic?
---
&gt; they also cannot be bought and require commitment to SAB
---
Except for when players exploited both SAB and support. You could join trib at the end for a few seconds and get the tokens before it booted you out. Also had players send in fake tickets saying they deleted their SAB infusions and got replacement ones. I haven't checked in awhile but some players had 2 sets of SAB infusions which is clear abuse of support.
---
my best https://imgur.com/a/xKjjet6
---
What does that mean? Will it come as a regular gem price outfit later on?
---
This whole game is just gemstore.
---
Casuals genuinely find enjoyment just logging in and buying gemstore skins.
---
It's actually a huge accomplishment for arenanet. They've somehow made spending money fun for those people.
---
The intent is to provide players with a sense of pride and accomplishment.
---
Every single response that you get is utterly hilarious. Some people are seriously dense.
---
Damn its time to get grinding again then lol
---
There is ONE improvement over the old system and that is actively seeing the stats each prefix gives at a glance, but it could definitely use a re-sort either by primary stat or alphabetical by name and a search function.
---
If you use both the celestial infusion and the Starborn outfit, and then disable your helmet, do you have a super blurry celestial-textured head?
---
So you want an "honest" trailer that is full of incorrect bullshit?
---
chaos glove 2.0?
---
they have a neat effect + 2 dye channels. chaos is static and has 1 dye channel
---
it feels like a spit in the face to have endgame fractal reward be flat out worse than rng lootbox drop
---
Didn't he quit?
---
For those of us with a Permanent Hairstyle Kit I wish they would allow us to exchange the piles of one-time use hairstyle kits into others types of boosters. The temp kits, they mock me!
---
So then really the fourth panel should be the extractor, perma bank access, and a bank tab full of rune sets.
---
So in your eyes its fair to smooch of people that either can afford it - or cant. All because you arent willing to fork over the costs of one cinema visit, 2 starbucks coffees or 1 pizza?
---
If you CANT afford a sub, then Im sorry, but you really shouldnt look for video games as a hobby, since its a rather expensive one to begin with. Or stick to games you get in lending libraries.
---
And ESPECIALLY teenagers shouldnt play reward driven videogames like mmos, because impulse control is something that goes haywire during hormonal changes on the way to adulthood. Its incredibly bad what is happening atm with Fortnite and co, and mark my words, we will see the results in 10-20 years, when all those addicted little fortnite kids grow up and become a drain on social systems. So, no, teenagers not being able to play sub mmos is actually a good thing, and they should be banned from ALL reward driven video games, which nowadays means pretty much all AAA games. 
---
Also, it doesnt matter what items are sold as MTX, its the purchase itself that is problematic. The animation during purchase, the pseudo currency etc. All the things to make it more "inviting" for you to spend money on something without any value at all.
---
Well if they were available anywhere else then they are no longer exclusives so there is no way for that to be false.
---
If we ignore that bit of pedantry, some of the mount skins have been available in the chests and available for direct purchase.
---
Oof, member how this ended up last time
---
They were better before repair costs went away and armor repair became easier to access in challenging content
---
Edit: and masteries removing armor damage
---
&gt; Getting a Self-Style Hair Kit or Total Makeover Kit was a dud roll -- especially the latter, since they were uncommon rarity
---
I understand the perception, (correct me if I am wrong) but I don't think that's how the RNG entirely works. Removing the Style Kits will not increase your odds of getting something of greater value, it just means you have a higher chance of getting a different dud item.
---
This would have been cool but it's never going to happen so I've been deleting mine as I get them.
---
Let's all ride the new train.
---
The Chrono nerf train is moving rather slow...it's all about the new outfit and legendary rune/sigil train now.
---
Straight up robbery just like last year
---
Well that's to be expected at this point.
---
His dare you suggest something like this then the OP can't bitch about Anet doing what they said they'd do with unrelated questions.
---
Not sure if missed the joke or if playing along...
---
The real MVP asking the real questions
---
Hey, I can finally sink my piles of auric dust somewhere useful.
---
Yeah that one is pretty decent.
---
The 50g ones I'm guessing OP is referring to are the ones you can buy from vendors -- like the mistborn node which is 50g (plus like 1000 volatile magic iirc)
---
Yeah, just woke up a while ago, but I stand by what I said
---
Mesmer portals change color based on if it was friendly or not, but the most useful place for that is WvW which no longer uses mesmers in group play.
---
F

I have about 70, waiting for them to update

PSA: Don't make PSA posts, unless you have your facts straight.

There's always exceptions. . but not many
---
One two three BITE
---
He’s a caffeinated skritt
---
It's a very different role so comparing them is rather hard. Elementalists are good 1v1 sidenoders. Mesmer and thief are more like +1 bursty specs. But overall they are in a good spot right now i guess. so yeah they can "compete".
---
recipes for  legendary runes and sigils
---
I just gave you a very detailed account as to why they are not fine. Thank you for addressing them.
---
Which ones are missing? According to the wiki averything is in there. https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Home_instance
---
ahh, that sounds...dumb.
---
I Just wanted the frequency of the hairstyle kits to be lowered, not removed entirely....
---
Well 10k magic plus 50g each doesn't exactly seem like a sound investment if you're aiming for blood rubies considering a sweep of the easy dailies takes about 2 minutes for 3 and they buffed the nodes so you should get at least a few from mining them.
---
Na it's the same for men which is how it should be
---
I like how equal the nakedness is
---
Nothing.  Mini claim tickets haven't been updated in over 6 months and I'm sitting on 50 of them to use.  I was hoping they would rotate in some of the old Zephyre related minis from the gemstore into one or two of the categories.  Gives no motivation to farm for the Mount Miniature collections if the reward (Mini claim tickets) aren't even updated lol
---
What did he die from?
---
Tell me, how much did you payed for this patch?
---
Funny how there are people in 2019 thinking Anet would do anything that the (loyal) players actually want. Money talks louder than loyalty.
---
Yeah I'm sitting on 50.  I have been holding off on using my Unid. Dyes on the Mount Minis until they update the mini claim tickets.  No point in finishing the collection if the reward isn't used lol
---
Why the ghost of Gwen look like she was at the end of GW1? She did not die right after.
---
The answer is [Yes](https://i.imgur.com/toqTR45.jpg)
---
Hell they weren't even worth it when we did have repair costs. No one wanted to get one from a black lion chest even then.
---
I wonder how people got so confused. Every source says August 30th, not 30-8/ 8-30
---
Can someone enlighten me?
---
This is why I wish they would change the "rare" and "super rare" section to have account bound items. By making that change they can increase their drop rate so players have a better chance at getting them. When you tie value to ultra rare items you have to make their drop rate so low that they basically never drop. If you want players to make gold have that be in the "Common" and "Uncommon" section. 
---
The game is about cosmetics and when you put them in rng boxes you only piss your players off.
---
Unfortunately what happens when your financial model competes with your major endgame rewards.  If the better rewards are in the store, people are less incentivized to do skill related content for rewards, but you will still have people playing for the game itself.  If the skill rewards are better then people won't buy from the store and the game dies.  Gotta choose the lesser of two evils.
---
Apparently, I’ve seen like a dozens posts about this all formatted or saying the same stuff over the last couple hours.
---
Ingame rewards OMEGALUL
---
So glad to hear this, I ordered a 3600 yesterday to upgrade my system with a 8350. :)
---
Got all shinies for free from keys I got from map completion. So G FUCKING G
---
Exactly. Pay up.
---
Wait disabling the “helmet” on the outfit renders your face back to normal instead of just removing the god awful looking helmet?
---
It's so much more than gemstore.
---
What class/spec would have the easiest time with Turai Ossa?
---
It wasn't the first time and it won't be the last.
---
Nothing at all....nothing at all....nothing at all....Stupid sexy Flanders!
---
Hallelujah! Finally you can use Golden Keys without getting a guaranteed Makeover Kit
---
I wish but besides this picture by the art team and gw1 no clues its coming. Think its just supposed to show how the zephyrites use the crystals to zoom across the map.
---
&gt; Still, I feel like it takes the black lion chests, which have always been an optional part of the game, and makes them mandatory.
---
It would be better if like the other skins from bl chest you could trade them on the TP.
---
They should stop releasing outfits and instead release sets of armour that can be EARNED in game. That is if they continue down the path of cosmetic endgame.
---
I'm just a simple cat that wants my Charr to be as naked as possible without sacrificing performance, and I don't care how I get there
---
For Charr...  
---
Dexterity +1 to Blood Legion.  
---
Intelligence to Ash legion....
---
This doesn't sound right. Blood Legion is a group of fighters. They don't hide, they don't focus on grace. They just hit things very hard. A better fit would be strength or con.  
---
Ash Legion... I guess I could see int being an option. But given they rely heavily on being secretive I'd imagine Charisma or Dexterity being better suited for them.
---
And ash legion being a technical legion, Wisdom or Intelligence.
---
Ah ty
---
black lion chest exclusive drop. So gamble away with those keys, or wait 6+ months for them to be available for 60 Black Lion Statuettes.
---
Again and again the devs release outfits that are miles above any armour set in game. Why would you work towards legendary armour if you can barely dye the particle effects it has and it looks very mediocre, just fork out $10 if you want to look cool :) !
---
Gemstore is where the most significant and exciting "rewards" go.
---
We just had that with Dragon Bash :/
---
Not really.  For the hair kits, yes.  For the makeover kits, no.  It first rolls for rarity and THEN rolls what to give you in that rarity,  So if it rolled an uncommon, and there is one less uncommon to roll, then yes it improves your odds technically.
---
Dailies and logging off?
---
Here is something that nobody said yet... Every race got a female and male version of the outfit... every race but Charr. Female charr lose their fluffy tail and just get the male version of the outfit. Kinda unfair and sad if you ask me :/
---
The whole cosmetic part of the game is just one huge disappointment after another. And even gemstore content is pretty underwhelming - timid mixable designs? hairstyles? multiple head item slots? swimsuits? undershirts? naaah, all the same huge flashy overdesigned lootbox crap every time - from one meta-item-of-the-week till the next one.
---
Just like when we saw spears on land in the Heart of Thorns reveal trailer.
---
&gt;Some profession skills now use different effects depending on whether the caster is an enemy or an ally.
---
So....
---
Custom skill animations (gemstore) might be a thing?
---
&gt;  There was a guide a few months ago how to get 4 or 5 keys in like 
---
 2h from personal story instances only.
---
&gt; Yeah this means nothing without a source.
---
You mean like on the wiki?
---
30 more days till we roast :^)
---
That's a good Contender for non argument of the year. This patch was crowd funded by "us". Or is anet non profit now?
---
Keep your trumpet bullshit off the forums. It's not funny.
---
Historically the outfits should eventually appear at the Black Lion Statuette merchant. That's typically where I'll save coin and scoop any outfits I like after some time passes and the outfits/novelties get changed. I don't know if every outfit cycles through, or how often that change is made but I know that this method is exactly how myself &amp; a few friends get the outfits when we don't have/want keys to gamble.
---
Because they wanted her to be easily recognised by the GW1 players. That's all.
---
All it needs are some toggle buttons for each stat type, and a search bar.
---
e.g. Click the Power button, list shortens to only include prefixes with power. Click the Precision button, list shortens to prefixes with power AND precision, etc.
---
Add a search bar so you can quickly type "ber" to get to Berserker's.
---
They've got the graphic design portion nailed, but the UX needs a little work.
---
/r/ISO8601
---
Why do you care?
---
BL chest scraps I would assume, unless thats what it is now.
---
Still Anet has committed to the whole "particle effect dying is not possible" even though the foe fire set was release (for a small real world money fee) around 2 years ago with fully customizable particle effects, while legendary armor isn't afforded the same luxury.  Cosmetic end game does not function when all the best skins are PAID CONTENT. Even people interested in cosmetic endgame wont stick around when anyone can just give over $10 and look BETTER than the guy who spent 10k hours in game to look exactly as he wants to.
---
Storm gloves aren't new.
---
look forward to it in gw3
---
and  one reason they don't go the compliance route is because it's not a big enough market share so all those people cheering every time a new country looks into passing similar laws is cheering for nothing.
---
If a big enough portion of their market is impacted then implementing compliance becomes worth the investment.
---
Although I think companies are more likely to go the DOTA2(?) route before they go with gambling law compliance where they show you what you will get before you consume your key since gambling compliance will probably apply age restrictions. If that happens I have to wonder if anything actually got accomplished.
---
turns out the one with quartz is bugged?
---
maybe 3.0 will allow 3 dye channels :p
---
That's 4k gold more, so you are ar 6600 gold. xD
---
However I have the Banke Access, it's the best item ingame imo!
---
Its a forum Q and A on the forums not on here.
---
Not gonna lie ide buy em...
---
Damn, that’s either laziness or another reason their framework/engine could be showing its age. Optimistically that art work could still be in the pipeline to be implemented later due to weird bugs/glitches/etc, but knowing their history I doubt it.
---
Whatever do you mean, I was just casually explaining why his post was removed and that it might not be related to content of the game.
---
why would you want any of them anyway? skin changing infusions are a cancer. I am ready for downvotes, they wont change the fact that these infusions are still ugly as hell
---
I guess new content can make everyone uncomfortable.
---
Since you missed the point: the term "timed exclusive" is already used to mean something else for video games. Please don't create a mess with meanings.
---
I don't think you neither understood ANet's business model, nor the principles of crowdfunding
---
Or just let PBM go and use ECSU and actually manage your heat.  Sure it doesn't feel as good, but obviously PBU is bad now and not worth even looking at anymore so move on where ECSU could actually be decent DPS now.
---
Because people cant believe that they make an announcement that they will make an annouuncement more than one month away
---
What about dev's attack on condi scrapper? 
---
No, really, what about condi scrapper build, losing 3k hp and gaining nothing is just unfair. Same with healing scrapper.
---
First, Im not assuming that people that cant afford a sub go watch a movie each month. Hence the new paragraph. 
---
But here it is explained to you in detail: If you cant afford those things, you cant afford a sub, you shouldnt have playing videogames as a hobby. Those are all LUXURIES. Not everybody has access to them. And there is ZERO reason why something like playing videogames should be made accessible to everybody. There are less expensive hobbys, pick one of those.
---
And again, what you are doing when "playing gw2 for free" is you are smooching off others spending the money on the game.
---
Secondly, what other adults do is their problem. They are ADULTS. Children however, are to be protected by society. Part of this is not letting children go gamble (or even just visit) casinos. Now why should it be okay to let children into the online equivalent of a casino?
---
Thirdly, there is no 'perceived' value. Either something has value, or it doesnt. Everything else is just your reward-center jumping up and down in joy. And btw, just something to think about: you dont even purchase those skins and 'qol items', you just pay for the privilege to use them. So its actually even worse of a rip-off. If anet decides to close down GW2 tomorrow, or remove the item from the game, you have zero chance of stopping them.
---
Oh, and as an addendum: Im a part time student, part time lowly minimum wage worker. Im pretty much at the bottom of "economic situations". The only ones having less than me, are single moms without a good paying fulltime job and nanny, and teenager/children. And still I can twist my finances to fit in 1 sub each month and a few single player games/expansions each year. So you saying Im discriminatory against those of "lower economic situations" is really quite comical. Single moms absolutely do NOT have the time for videogames. And as for teenagers/children, Ive made my stance pretty clear. Theres nothing left to discuss really. You dont want to accept you are smooching off addicts and rich people with your 'no sub' attitude, and thats fine. Idc.
---
Give me a link then, Wiki says nothing about farming 4-5 keys in 2 hours.
---
It is possible the worst ever.
---
Thank you but Im gonna keep my mystic coins and my precious clovers that I have hoarded up through WvW reward tracks. I dont need legendary upgrades!
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Faction_Provisioner this one?
---
i love how rewards are consistently shit in this game
---
then could you tell me what's your favorite Quaggan, please?
---
Hello (little) Satans.
---
Some insiders really made a profit on these changes.
---
Agreed, this is a good change.   
---
&lt;has enough of both to last years.
---
I mean.. we just got a free festival with plenty of fun things to do, new skins to earn in-game, and lots of enjoyable content that has no cost or charge.. but sure, they're greedy for designing a gemstore skin to bring in some revenue for their company.
---
When you open a chest, you get one Statuette, one seasonal item (currently the Gnashblade Zephyrite Supply Box) and two rolls from the Common rarity of the chest drop table.
---
The game also does another roll for a potential fifth item. There's a large chance that it doesn't give you anything, a small chance that that it's an Uncommon item, an even smaller chance that it's Rare, and a teeny-tiny chance that it's Super Rare. If you get lucky and get one of these bonus items, it does one more roll inside of the rarity that you got to determine your actual bonus item.
---
To my point about the Total Makeover Kit: prior to today, it was in the Uncommon category, meaning that you won that fifth bonus roll, but then your roll within that category netted you a Makeover Kit. For some context, often the newest 2000 gem mount skin is included as a prize in that same Uncommon category, and there's always at least one weapon skin, armor skin, or outfit in there that isn't obtainable anywhere else.
---
Removing the Total Makeover Kit just flatly increases the odds that people win an expensive mount skin or an exclusive skin.
---
Nowhere near enough infusions, and your weapon is not even legendary??? Casual /s
---
Never Ever
---
you reap what you sow. you thought that because eye cancer became so popular that it would just stay the same way? everything that has even the slightest chance of making money ends up in the gem store with shitty alternatives available from actually playing the game.
---
You madman!
---
Wouldn’t the second tree basically be the one in verdant brink? Maybe he woke up early as a non afflicted sylvari and wasn’t turned into a Mordrem.  
---
I doubt they’ll ever truly answer it now that we’ve crossed the Sylvari are dragon minion thresholds.
---
But people have requested a rework of the infusion so its higher res. They never delivered and instead released an outfit that uses the same effect with the aura but with higher res. 
---
Fractal Ben even promised to update the auras but he is no longer working with Anet.
---
Yeah I opened 50 chest and no outfit. I hate rng...
---
(╯°□°）╯︵ :)
---
if you look at this only from short term gain perspective, sure
---
Gratz! My first ascended was a +1 agony infusion. Yours is much better.
---
My thought exactly. I’m pretty fashionable in game, but I’ve got WAY too many of these.
---
If that's all you do, then YOU should probably just stop playing then. The new Metas, Raids, Fractals, Map completion/exploring. Soloing champs/ perfecting your builds?
---
Introducing: one back item that clips through 80% of gear.
---
you can dye it on the outfit too
---
Bad timing, new vendors got added today :\^)
---
u cant get this outfi for $10 its RNG u could spend $1000 u still might not get it !
---

---
Problem is people have short term memory too
---
Is this a unique ascended?
---
Capes aside, I'm getting some serious Aiel cadin'sor vibes here. Land spears when?!?
---
Ran out of geyser
---
You mean any Charr?
---
Q&amp;A is already 42% of QuAggAn.
---
You said it's free, so I used simple to understand phrases.I apologize. 
---
Each patch Was indeed payed by "us" in one or another way, or created with future projected income resulting of said patch in mind. So in fact, it's not free. Disproving your "argument". 
---
*if a product is free, you are the product*

how else do you think anet look at it?

It takes you 20 minutes? Slow poke.
---
Jea im just retarded and didn’t see the rest
---
i wonder who at anet thought it was a good idea to make it so the list of stats for legendary gear swapping is arranged by release date instead of alphabetically? not only is going through that list already a huge pain since you can only see like 5 different options at a time, since there is no search stat swapping legendary gear is now cancer
---
Yeah it fucks it all up. 
---
 
---
Doctor Manathan is so much cooler than a cochaella attendee.
---
Chrono it was last year. But with the recent nerfs it probably isn't anymore
---
It was not, the character had a spear and a shield at the same time
---
But... that's why /u/MorbidEel said chaos gloves **2.0**. Implying these were an upgrade. 
---
Unless I misread the tone of your comment and you are not in disagreement.
---
It could be the order in which stats are stored in a table somewhere, in which case it would be a programmet logic error when the UI is populated by iterating through the stats list table
---
Oh, I know, working in QA makes you really feel for the devs. I just let my sarcasm stack and overflow (hope you get the pun ;) )
---
permanent ones are SUPER CRUNCHY ULTRA RARE drops from the black lion chests. if you have the gold, you can buy them from the trading post (but they are pricey af which is a given since it lets you change on the fly).

[Keybinds 2019 by Wooden Potato's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRcmh5vrpu0) This guy is the one of the most active spokesperson for GW2 in general. He has huge amount of experience playings GW2, including the competitive modes like pvp and wvw. This video is about his personal keybinds. He starts out saying though this is just his personal ones and not -best/optimal- more of an FYI.
---
Also GW2 can be played like a TPS if you turn on [Action Camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y2czD6BREw).
---
Most likely you get that issue when there is a lower population of active players.
---
&gt; 1 obsidian shard for a provisioner token
---
fuckin sold
---
Turn that frown *upside* down!
---
Handy if you are making the leggy armour tho. Get those tokens faster.
---
Because there is no party leader system and blocking someone out of spite would be a good way to restrict their access to lfg groups for certain content by joining them, which would prevent them from doing the same.
---
Makes you learn your class ? what ? you have like 2 things to dodge and the fight is over
---
It's not that you're complaining.  That's fine and dandy.  It's how you go about doing it.
---
Tell it to Chronomancers. 
---
Hey Mirages and Soulbeasts, you're up next on "ANet gonna fuck your spec so people will pay for next eSpecs!"
---
\*laughs in soulbeast\*
---
The point is the same.
---
I bought it when it was cheap, the hair kit.
---
:)
---
There are in fact 2 options that don't force you to overheat.
---
Statuettes would be perfect as a substitute. And while we are talking useless drops,they could add some more options to the drop that lets you pick minis... I have exhausted all their current options.
---
BenA, person working currently on Minecraft, wrote, this is quote, that  "[changing the resolution of infusion] is on the list of requests. I hope we can [do it] :)". Not "I'm gonna replace this thing personally, or someone else if I leave the company". Nobody ever "promised update to aura". [Yes, I got my facts straight.](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8bzhtk/red_celestial_infusion_on_a_dark_skinned_character/dxavtof/)
---
They had no opportunity, they literally reused the assets other than models of the armor pieces in the outfit. They did not changed any textures working on this.
---
They must have metrics of how many kits are used vs how many kits are bought in the gem store so they saw all the money they were losing by giving them away.
---
I was making a comparison with items that are still widely used because the QoL, regardless of costs. Everlasting styling kits will always keep that. Since they would have no limitations or costs. They would not unlock the styles, but just like with stats in legendary gear, you'd have them all anyways without having to unlock them first. 
---
But If analogy escapes you, you can just try to realize what's wrong with your actual problem: you'd rather not have improvements other players would enjoy. Improvements that would also make more valuable makeover kits and encourage more people to get gems and buy them to get a servizable collection of customziations unlocked, and that would also eventually allow for 'customization slots', and help support the game.  
---
And for what? So something that you have, which would still work just the same, maintains a more apparent value in your view? 
---
Or maybe  you are talking about tradable makeover kits, and you want to keep them as valuable as possible to make as much profit as possible out of them?   
---
In that  case that only deserves a smirking shrug as a response.  That's the risk of speculation and investment. Many changes in the past have changed the value of items, and every time is a neat positive for the playerbase as a whole. Those who were profiting from bad designs will always be a non-issue. 
---
In any case, you are completely ignoring the upfront cost. Before you could apply a hairstyle again at a stylist NPC, you would have to unlock it first. And that would cost gems or kits. Unlocking every single style would cost  quite a lot. That cost would not affect a permanent styling contract.
---
Funny how people in 2019 think Anet bothers to alter old content.
---
Diffrent? with so many other people who use these celestial things? :)
---
right click -&gt; add to wallet...
---
you gotta add them to your wallet
---
Agreed, it's the main reason I haven't done all Gambit Turai. I have zero interest in the faceroll festival content to be able to do all gambits.
---
Must be hard to read those item descriptions
---
no, it isn't. i own neither and my original point was that i would be okay with such a change to character customisation *if* i was reimbursed for my purchase of a permanent hair contract. regardless, the point is moot. anet are highly unlikely to make such a change as they presumably still make money from selling customisation options in the gem store.
---
The Celestial Infusions aren't really 'visual diarrhea' nor is the new outfit. Skin texture infusions and armor sets are, imo, perfectly fine.
---
It's shit like Phospholuminescent Infusions or Ice Encasement Outfit that are visual diarrheas.
---
I think it's more outrageous that we can't choose whether we want the chest plates with every characters regardless of race and gender.  
---
Armors should not have female or male versions at all. If a male wants to go with a dress, they should be able to do so.
---
The mastery XP bar will only fill up until 100%, there is no overflow. So yes any xp above 100% is gone.  
---
*When you have all masteries in an expansion unlocked, the xp bar turns into...spirit shard xp bar. And then do just rolls to the next progress bar for the next spirit shard.
---
inb4 why druid no heals
---
So they can nickle and dime players even more of course.
---
Faolain didn't have a shield. She only had one staff.
---
listen here *you little shit*
---
You mean the timer that drags the bar will stop ticking if we don't donate?!
---
They made an announcement on the start date and the 3bd date is in the patch notes.
---
If you really wanna try and guestimates you can check the release dates on the wiki and plan around it
---
I'm sure it's just one guy working part-time.

---
This is very reminiscent of the old Transmutation Stone UI. It's a step backwards, but at least that means it's not unfixable.
---
yeah, that does make sense, but... i mean, would a programmer then go on to just splat the statsets onto the screen like this and call it a day? if there's one thing i know about programmers it's that they sure love their lists and cluttered ui:s, that is, as long as they're organized. this seems like a proto if anything.

Basically all but 2 (Mystic Forge Stone &amp; Obsidian Shard) of the new Provisioner Token vendors are worthless.

Best outfit we got so far.

Kinda sucks that's it part of the blc.

Guess I'll wait for the statuettes update.

fine just deleted it.. fucking assface

Question, which reward track are you talking about? I’ve done a bunch of them and scour them for useful stuff before I commit to one but I don’t recall seeing anything for crafting legendary armor. Granted I haven’t done ranked
---
I am so excited for this.

...I understand that. My point is that hasn't changed, right? The only thing that's different here is you can't get kits randomly from the chests themselves, which was the thing that I was referring to when i said that you'd need to open a ton of chests to get one of them randomly.
---
So, oddly enough, this change doesnt really affect the availability of makeover kits at all.
---
Well I was talking about a guy with a spear and a shield at the same time, but yeah it was not Faolain
---
Good thing I've always got a few of both in my back
---
These are the same tokens we used to have to trade gear for in HoT?
---
And the Zodiac armor
---
you triggered libtard?
---
what does you having to be at your mom's house have to do with anything?
---
You bought the permanent hair change contract from another player who found it via RNG though, its value wasn't set by Anet, it was set by the market. So who exactly should reimburse you?
---
By your logic, I should be reimbursed for all the Globs of Ectoplasm I bought when they were 40 silver instead of 17 or whatever they're at nowadays.

If a person lacks RAM they might be writing to the page file often. In this case a ssd would increase frames. But it would be cheaper to just get more ram. Also you do not know anets engine and they could have some bad code that is bottlenecked by disk loads. The engine is from early 2000s before dual core CPU's exist.
---
Why would they put 5 minutes of work into something, if they can sell an outfit a year afterwards that looks like the updated infusion you can get without gems?
---
I mean, why would people who pointed out that issue when star mount skins were released with a much better looking high res optic be mad about anet stepping on ones already damaged toe a second time.
---
Username checks out

I opened 2 boxes during Boss Blitz and got an Invisible Boots Box !
---
&gt;Last time I checked nobody wanted them on asuras
---
I did
---
Don’t give people hope lol!
---
Only if you give us the option to disable it.
---
Is that a bug or intended?
---
The raptor skin looks nice although it doesnt look like a premium skin worth 2k though.
---
Exalted shoulders on statuettes is nice, I missed it previously.
---
Will definitely be getting the new outfit
---
this is CREEPY AF
---
I get mine out of black lion statuettes.  Hopefully they're still available that way.
---
At least it kinda work in raids.
---
Join, state your role and experience... Can't hear you? Oh, blocked? Then kick.
---
It can drop from bl chests fortunately
---
Should be patched soon
---
ow... :(
---
wtf menu is this?
---
Do you need to make 6 of them.. or does 1 work for all 6??
---
No it's a single guy but he lives in a closet that doubles as his office
---
If you are good enough to jump in on all classes with all gambits on and beat Ossa with just a couple dodges, hats off to you.
---
ngl this implementation just makes me laugh.
---
This grinds my gears more than it should honestly, but it is not the outfit itself, it is the sentiment that they didn't even bother to update the textures of the in-game reward before they released it!
---
Now if only the base models looked better...
---
it doesn't have any kind of extra "legendary" effect when equipped does it?
---
For goodness sake, GW2 players needs to read patch notes.
---
Everybody is pointing out the cost of mystic clovers and might/magic but no one has yet realized that it's peanuts compared to the cost of **Gift of Runes**. Each of those requires 50 [Mystic aspects](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Runes) which at current prices cost 1K gold (buy price), 1.5K gold (sell price) each, and you need 1 per rune so 6 for a whole set.
---
I guess those will go down eventually when people start dumping their lucent crystals for satchel of loot (don't do it, sell them now instead), but holy fuck.
---
Well its actually precisely what "people" have asked over and over again lately
---
You probably get questions like this all the time, so I apologize ahead of time. I'm considering returning after not playing since, well, launch. My highest level character is a 37 Elementalist if I remember correctly. I'm just tired of WoW, it's pretty boring now and looking for something fresh. 
---
I'm thinking of rerolling from scratch a class that's interesting and has some challenge to it. I remember Mesmers being kind of different and engaging. Still true?
---
I'm interested in mostly pve content but never have done any dungeons or anything. Is this a game where I'd you're not one of the certain "blessed" classes you can never get into a group?
---
I don't have any expansions right now. I'm not opposed to buying them later if I'm having fun, I just figure it's not necessary yet. Will that be a problem for any reason?
---
Also, is a guild necessary? If so what's the best way to find one? I love any group content (dungeons, raids, etc.). I like being part of a team. What are my options here?
---
Thank you in advance, sorry for nub questions.
---
Noice
---
As a fan of both, I salute you
---
Maybe you have not understood the post. I haven't talked about rewards, I just want to be able to fight Ossa with all gambits without having to pay more than without gambits. Gambits are added difficulty, having to pay more to add difficulty is a bit backwards.
---
Have you never heard of the term "escapism"?
---
Isn't it cheaper to spend gems on the kit itself instead of the keys?
---
Or you might be talking about the free weekly keys you get at lvl 10, 40, and 60. And if that's the case, it's been quite obvious for a long time that anet doesnt like those. First, the NPE forced you to get to lvl10 to even start the story, conveniently fucking up keyfarmers. Then, the keyfarmers figured an efficient way to use cooking to level up (strawberries were pricey then), but anet added a weekly cap.
---
My point is : we've known for many years that anet despise those keys, why getting overly outraged now? You are just salty.
---
When I read it the first time, I had to do a double take since I thought it was strange that they'd place it so far away.
---
So much this. My Necro is eternal ice dye on her zodiac armor
---
&gt; I guess those will go down eventually when people start dumping their lucent crystals for satchel of loot (don't do it, sell them now instead), but holy fuck.
---
Or rather when the recipe is released by Craftsman Hobbs. I don't think the recipe will cost 20g per Aspect.
---
I've done 18k boxes so far. 215 rare drops(didn't get the new backpack), 3 super rare drops. Only expensive thing being the invisible boots box, others were the recipe and a poly infusion. Got about 50k festival tokens and 73 stacks of quartz crystals. 
---
Guess I'll start saving up for next years event now.
---
it's a non-issue, imo, 'cause you shouldn't run out of tickets, unless you ignore every other aspect of the festival, which is what anet doesn't want you doing
---
Just make it so gold keys don’t drop them, this is stupid as hell.
---
Thanks for the quality content :)
---
After a few hours u still need organization for gold. Nothing rly changed, it is ezer now but that all still not mindless when u want gold.
---
Just do it Anet. Please. there are like 5 post on this. I dont have the infusion, but I think its only right since it seem like a quick enough texture swap.
---
It is the same principle at play. Online games, and prices in online games, change all the time, there's no reasonable expectation for any item to remain the same price or value that it started out at. And investing that much gold into ONE item is pretty much the worst thing you could do if you're then gonna complain about it.
---
&gt; Or just let PBM go and use ECSU and actually manage your heat. 
---
   
---
Yes, definitely a good idea. Just use the other trait. Which is just stupid because Anet has not been able to get any the &gt;100% heat threshold for its Exceeds since Holo release, as it even stands in the tooltip for that trait! 
---
\+ This change literally makes PBM useless shit and not worth beeing a grandmaster tier trait at all.   
---
Nobody said they should revert the change complely but just for PBM, as a 3 year old can see thats just bad game design. Just spot defending bullshit just while the class doesn't interests you. -\_-
---
You have to consume them
---
Consume them
---
boycotting :/ dyable zodiac skin section thread made not long ago on forums, THEN they do this! nty.

---
Wow, here I am, didn't touch the game in a while and thought "Nice, celestial stuff! I'm a sucker for that so I have to get into the game again and farm that gold for gems or buy gems and get it for myself". Then I read it's rng garbage again and just uninstalled the game again. Back to POE i'll go then, cuz they at least want my money for their celestial stuff instead of anet with their rng bullshit.
---
Yeah and i set my keys so, that i can play with own hand for 9skills, F1-F4 and movment keys. The F5 and the elite on the mouse. Tottaly possible without any macros.
---
Hard to say without video of game play but if I had to guess some common issues. You don't press your buttons enough, you don't have a feel for what 1200 range is, you're not focusing your damage with the other classes and your positioning needs improvement.  
---
People seem to forget, this isn't PvE, swap in some maraduar. Yes, zerker *can* be more damage but if you are spending more time trying to stay alive, you aren't doing damage so the extra damage stats are pointless. Tank up, put in a ton of hours, then swap the zerk back in. But in the end, Hammer Herald is 90% positioning, 10% just pressing your skills.   
---
If you have more specific questions, I can try to help.
---
but you did get a form of compensation when f2p was added, it might have been a shitty outfit but you still got it. when you buy an item in a live service game, especially one of this nature, you buy it with the assumption that that item will continue to hold the same or similar value, it is a live service after all. your argument might work for a singleplayer game but this is a live service and hypothetically, decisions such as the one you suggest would create market instability and player dissatisfaction, both of which are harmful to the game. either way, it's still never gonna happen. it's a bad idea and it takes away from monetisation methods already in place, replacing a potentially infinite source of income to a finite source of income.
---
Everything.
---
And the next, and the next
---
Yeah and Weaver, Tempest, Deadeye, Daredevil, Mirage, Chrono, Soulbeast etcx aren't upgrades to core. I get that. Just only give Engi drawbacks, nobody plays it anyway.

Anet's solutions to player retention gets worse every day.
---
prices in good online games change *organically* as the supply and demand rises and falls, that is fair and that is to be expected. the suggestion in this instance would drastically reduce the price of an item and that's not how anyone should assume it works. if i think the way you seem to be suggesting, i may as well think that the RoW version of gw2 will follow the chinese version of gw2's example and start selling legendaries on the gem store, it's simply asinine to suggest that anyone could foresee such an event happening in reality.
---
DPS whise ESCU-Sword does fine. But rota is cancer, cc is shit, heat management a pain (exspecially if you want A.E.D CC). So Draghon Hunter still is a straight Upgrade. Easy as fuck Rota, good CC, more DPS, no heat management, ...
---
But to be fair: More DPS than Reaper now. Still would choose Reaper main over Engi in PUG Raiding. Because Reaper has better survivability, doesn't die instantly if he fuckes up its (non existing) heat and has its dps with face rolling over the keyboard. :D
---
Still :feelshangman: i guess.
---
same

That comment went to +4, then -8, then -2

It's a ride
---
Where we have to both pay and wait to get different beards. And even then, half the population can't use them anyway.
---
I guess people who think auras and effects are ugly are finally happy.
---
If only people like you knew what the hell PATCH NOTES ARE.
---
Any reason those two videos are now unavailable 3 months later?
---
Because if they do it, they won't really gain money from it.
---
So a typical broken korean MMO?
---
I have so many that when I was so lucky to drop the endless hairstylist ... I selled it. I once wanted this so badly.
---
I mean I’d rather wait a few weeks than a few years. And you can maintain them yourself instead of having to get them out of an RNG box ;)
---
So i opened 10k boxes and got 
---
1x Aurillium  
---
1x  Polylumi Infusion (Orange)
---
Things like these (Outfit vs. Infusion effect) would be easy ways for anet to at least make it look like they still care for stuff thats not purchased through the gemstore :( Even if their priority is the gemstore, making prestigious or expensive infusions/armor/items at least on par with gemstore items wont break their sales.
---
Same reason you can join other people's party, when they have you blocked
---
Nice! My time only took 5 tries, so definitely can be improved. Gotta get the perfect jackal -&gt; skimmer transitions
---
Time for a Virgin "Endgame" Player vs Chad "Gemshop" Spender meme!
---
You mean the one that, for a brief time, was available from a nightmare CM chest? =P
---
I mean ummm, yeah, nothing to see here.
---
xD
---
why not both?
---
Oh baby
---
Well yeah that's what it says in the patch notes.
---
I like it. I just wish it wasn’t gambling to get it
---
You would have had a point before PoF released, but we've got four (2 set w/upgrade) complete sets of armor in this last season, and the same for weapon weapon sets.
---
Sure, it'd be nice to have more, but acting like there has been nothing is stupid and hyperbolic.
---
Nothing stopping a revamp of that view.
---
I realize we don't know the full cost for the Gift of Runes yet, but as an educated guess, do you think the Gift of Runes cost is roughly the same cost as the Gift of Upgrades or did they listen to feedback and make it cheaper?
---
I'm not aiming for anything I was just curious. I do farm the areas daily but I was just curious why the home nodes are so expensive and etc.
---
I have a perfect home instance and it's accounted at \~6.58k gold (incl. the AB ones.)
---
I do all those things already. I was just curious why it's so ridiculous
---
Not really.. I've been doing daily fracs for a month and only gotten to t2. I can't play that long.
---
That here is missing on efficiency for example:
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Season_4_Expedition_Contract
---
Well , there you go , you just pointed out your own problem. The other half of the equation is that you're not using up VM on trophy shipments , which makes up a big piece of the profit.
---
Why in the world do this on the forums instead of reddit? It’s near impossible to follow the flow on the forums.
---
Ohh.. yeah... whoops. xD Why you need differents icon I guess xD
---
If you like that, check out this horrible miscraft I made: https://i.imgur.com/MDwAmZu.jpg
---
Been playing a year ish. I have ascended all but 2 trinket. (Just need earrings I think) I have ascended mainhand weapon. The rest is exotic. I am also stuck on t2
---
You can instantly craft gear with core stats or PoF stats (using stat swap in mystic forge). HoT stat gear requires some account bound mats for stat swapping iirc.
---
&gt;yeah the less than 1% of players who are impacted by this are totally a good reason to change something.
---
Lol.  My autocomplete on my phone is retarded.  I'll just leave it because why not.
---
The last hairstyle update did exactly that actually (not counting the PoF/Elonian hairstyles they added, as those weren't gemstore exclusive hairstyles) But yeah, some more of those would be cool
---
They could have just made the golden key have an exemption to the dye/kit stuff.
---
Yes such as the bloodstone node
---
In early fotm it was often the only way to repair as you couldn't leave
---
Yeah, this reeks of metric driven arguments.  
---
Where they take a metric and make it fit their argument.
---
they were great for fractals back before HoT, loved getting them back then so you could fix up your armour without having to go back to LA
---
Name checks out
---
To be honest, I find the "Mistlock Sanctuary Passkey" to be better value.
---
It's an instanced map with a bank, stylist (if I remember correctly), Mystic Forge etc etc and since it's instanced - you can teleport back to where ever you were before using it (although I'm not sure it works in instanced maps like the Dragon's Stand meta as you'll be put back into a different map if yours was full with a queue. In this situation - the dedicated contract would be better as it spawns an NPC for you). You can also teleport to the major cities for free which is nice for alt characters.
---
I want to craft berserker gear, so I guess it's instant. Thx for the reply :)
---
or be able to trade for black lion statuettes
---
Same here.  I don't get keys often, and when I use a key and get a hairstyle kit instead of good loot, I get grumpy.
---
At least the dumb "bEcAusE eVeRyOnE wOuLd DyE iT sKiN tOnE" argument is finally over
---
Yes.  I used to make my available, but most days don't anymore because I get no takers or maybe one.  So it's like waiting for 3-5 minutes to see if anyone joins when I could have already been mostly done harvesting.  I'd do it more if more people were interested.  It's especially nice when I have done it in the past and people were nice and said thank you. :)
---
I don't take tips, but it's just nice to hear "thank you" sometimes :)
---
But I don't know, the last times I offered I just got no takers or maybe 1.  But then I don't login in when the game resets and i think that's when most people do the harvest.  
---
So if you want that and log in during resets, you'll find it easy I am guessing to find full home instances.
---
This is probably good for is who wants new hairstyles in the long run. Less people getting coincidental makeover kits means that more people will buy them directly. This will in turn signal to ANet that they are a good revenue stream and investing artists to add to them is worthwhile. 
---
Tho I think they regret not making hairstyles unlocks like skins.
---
I guess all us scrubs and casuals still enjoy it 🙄
---
[Huggagagagaga](https://giant.gfycat.com/LegalHandmadeBlesbok.webm)
---
A great change....still doesnt make up for that Legendary Rune UI
---
At least now I have my Halloween outfit ready.
---
Whoever makes their gear just doesn't like getting money for it.  
---
That is the least worst reason I can imagine for the extremely poor design decisions and nonsensical oversights that cripple their fashion system.
---
A lot of gemstore stuff looks Cantha. Which makes me think there are assets being developed behind the scenes that aren’t on the gemstore.
---
Oh wow.  AS someone who's an avid user of the red and blue cele infusions, this really disappoints me.
---
Good thing I have a number of them saved up
---
I personally think that its a good idea to change the Shatters. But they way they did was stupid. First: Shatters on Mirage are the same. Second: Chrono Shatters are mostly an upgrade to the ore ones and don't function entirely different.  
---
My idea for Mirage is more drastically: Just give Clones back the ability to deal damage (just on Mirage ofc) and buff it by alot. I mean before they removed tehe dmg on clones it was allready abyssmal and not worthwihle. With the actual power creep it shouldn't be a problem to give mirage clones dmg back.  
---
The Trade off: Remove Shatters from Mirage completely. Mirage is build about clones. Killing them on purpose seems odd to me. Instead of Shatters the new F abilities could buff clones further for a short duration. (Maybe one who gives bleeding on AA or X% more pDMG on another). This would a game design just like Scourge. It trades Shroud for Shades.   
---
This change would make Mirage more unique and and absolute change to Chrono and Cor wich both avolved around Shatters.
---
Wiki says a skritt trader in Lion's Arch will trade Mystic Forge Stones for tokens, so if you already have a Salvage-O-Matic and have no need to craft Mystic Salvage Kits, you can use those.
---
&gt;why would people who pointed out that issue when star mount skins were released
---
It didn't even start there.  Astralaria uses the same texture as the mounts.  Viiastra has a higher res texture too.  It's just the infusion players get that's garbage.
---
Whichever one did whatever you are trying to do but better.
---
Plus getting down liadri was the equivalent of getting down dhuum cm today. The blazing light was super prestigious at the time.
---
Ranked PvP only requires PvP rank 20.
---
Whatever is coming with season 5, they will need some way to boost sells.
---
They won't, it would jeopardise sales of blakc lion keys. This is just pure loot box shit.
---
Wardrobe unlockers are in the same tier as repair canisters. I will take a thousand of those over the hair kits.
---
That contrast makes me sad.
---
Yep that worked well on engi. Now every engi spec is garbage. Core is garbage, Holo is garbage and Scrapper is garbage. Goal fulfilled ! :D
---
(Not saying I'm against trade offs. Scourge and Rev have good ones.)
---
did anyone have problems with the prev6 legendary stat selection method? why fuck something up that needed no change in the first place
---
Thanks, I hate it
---
oh you sweet summer child........
---
As much as I adore Guild Wars 2, I really hate the direction cosmetics have taken.
---
I don't mind casual content in small amounts, but if I want to play casual content or a single player game, there are much better games than GW2 for that kind of content.
---
It's not even about casual/non casual for me anyway. I just want an engaging and compelling game to play, and a lot of GW2 content isn't that for me.
---
Nevertheless, I'm glad you and others enjoy it.
---
I think everyone who hoarded the crystals is realizing just how much of a joke this "event" is. I haven't seen the bar move much at all. At least the mystic forge ones gave AP.
---
Yeah all that is terrible and your design is much better.
---
But legendary breather? Did I miss when those came out?
---
I wish more players on this sub had your attitude! 
---
I think Dark Harvest was my first ascended weapon too. It’s definitely my favorite of the elite spec weapons.
---
Nice! I like the creative use of the dragon in the middle there.
---
I noticed your GAL guild tag... is that the WvW guild w? If so, Hello!
