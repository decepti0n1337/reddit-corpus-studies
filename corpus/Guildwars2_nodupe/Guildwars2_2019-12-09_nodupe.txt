While nostalgia was the main reason why people swarmed the Classic servers, it's the mechanics that held them there (now, after a certain period of time).
---
But I think what Harmagg meant was simply an expac that's stationed in Cantha, so we could see how GW2 reinterprets it, much like how it reinterpreted Elona. It wouldn't be backwards thinking to include older lore to the game, because as time goes on it feels weirder and weirder how disconnected Cantha is from the rest of the world and story (though there is the lore excuse with the isolationist emperor).
---
---
---
While we don't know specifics about the code for gw2 they have said numerous times that it's not exactly easy for them to go back and change things especially when the people who wrote the code in the first place have left and they have no idea what might/might not break if they start messing with it. Gw2 legitimately has spaghetti code judging by everything we know about it that anet would rather leave be than risk messing with it.
---
still it's not even half of it, besides she admitted at some point she got direction from Maclaine, not going to undervalue Lena, hell no, but Maclaine made this game's music as good as it should have been since 2012.

Why is when people bring bring up cantha people get like annoyed or defensive? I just feel like if they added something in gw2 that’s cantha based it would probably bring back players. How is that bad? Like OOOOF gw2 Reddit is so annoying!
---
I've used custom battle music for years and for me it's still working. I do mostly play pve though, so maybe it's an issue with the pvp maps

What are either of you supposed to be?
---
I really wanted to try out making some YT content but thought what I do in the game probably wouldn't interest most people; completionist stuff, setting goals &amp; achieving them. If anything I figured it would end up just serving as a video log of my progress for myself only, in which case it'd be easier to just create a discord server and track my progress there... which I did.
---
couple of things:
---
- minions are stupid and weak. while they allow you to cheese some fights they generally cause you more trouble than they are worth.
---
- death magic is a notoriously weak trait line, not only because the traits it provides are generally weak or inconsequential, but because choosing it over other trait lines forces you to miss out on the comparatively impactful bonuses other lines provide.
---
- reaper, except for a single trait, is a power focused spec, while curses is a condition damage focused trait line.
---
with that said my advice is to try out a proper power reaper build. maybe with some cheap vampire runes instead of scholar to get some significant boost in survivability. ditch the minions and especially death magic entirely for open world/story type content, you're gonna thank me later. if that doesn't click with you i'd urge you to give scourge another try... though again, with a decent setup.
---
on a side note: i've seen enough people that swore by their custom self-made builds for very long times, until they eventually got persuaded into at least trying out more effective and thought-through builds and got a serious wake-up call out of it.
---
Not sure why this is being downvoted as its a huge issue. I participated 2 years ago and also got nothing from my match and I also got ignored once I pmed the ones running it.

I don't mean people who intentionally make music videos for Youtube...I mean people who make game content into a stupid music video. Like...I don't want to hear whatever stupid weeb music crap people enjoy while I'm watching story clips, or gameplay, or build suggestions. And I certainly don't want to see people ganking someone else's art to use without crediting the artist. It's a crappy thing to do. Especially given that Youtube channels make so much revenue from streams and ads. Send some of that profit to the artist you're stealing from.  
---
Edit: It's as annoying as people who make music videos with porn.
---
You'll want to check more specific sites for meta builds
---
Raids: [Snowcrows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/)
---
Fractals: [Discretize](https://discretize.eu/builds)
---
WvW (Zerg): [Zabbi](https://www.vabbi.eu/builds.html)
---
Metabattle is fine in general, a lot of their builds are pretty cut and paste from the other sites but they also have open world suggestions, more PvP stuff, and roaming builds for WvW.
---
Gs3, sword 2, judges intervention should be enough to get to mobs. You can also use scepter. AA is slow but skill 2 is low cd aoe which should help with tagging
---
I would like to kindly inform you that it's not me who had the joke flew over head. :)
---
Even then, if you really wanted to make one of those harder dungeons easier there were two ways of doing it... raise the party's overall DPS, or MAKE A TRINITY setup.  Just because the game wasn't strictly designed around it... going in to Arah with 3 DPS and a high toughness Guard and healer Ele certainly made it very very doable even if everyone in general was lower competence.  
---
One of the effective strategies for for AC path 1 if your party wasn't able to kill the mounds quickly enough was to put a guardian with healing tome by Hodgins to plop down damaging AoEs and then keep himself and Hodgins healed while he ran around in circles to keep the gravelings kited while the other DPS do the mounds in a specific order.  
---
It is STILL a very effective strategy today (though I use a more DPSy kiter at Hodgins now like a Zerk DH) when I take some of my guildies through all the dungeon paths two-man for their dungeon runner achieves (the ones that can be low manned at least due to mechanics).
---
You don't really learn a bloody thing until level 80 because that's how the game is designed.  I wouldn't worry too much about the leveling process; just try and get DH unlocked as soon as possible / Heart of Thorns.

---
Stack damage multipliers.  They tend to be multiplicative rather than additive. 
---
* Go in with Judges Intervention or Leap of Faith (GS3; also a 5 target blind) ~ blind = next attack misses.  
---
* Put down a symbol on an enemy to synergize with symbolic avenger (either Scepter 2) or (GS 4).  
---
* If you use GS4 then try to spin-inside enemies so that all your "missiles" from GS2 impact the main target *alone*. 
---
* Defensively; if you need to range you've got Scepter (900) range and Focus (5); plenty of blocks for most enemies. 
---
* If you need extra defense you can pop stand-your-ground for a little extra retaliation or stability. 
---
* Stability - each stack of stability will nullify a crowd-control effect; a stun, daze, knockdown, float etc.  
---
* Heal - Most people swear by Litany of Wrath, ("immortal" while doing big DPS) but Shelter (block) is also nice too since you can block (eg; a big smash or knockdown).  You can also "stow-cancel" some of this iirc. 
---
* Virtue of Courage (F3) allows you to strategically apply aegis to you and allies in anticipation of a big attack. 
---
Perfect Inscriptions vs. Righteous Instincts is up to you.  I'd suggest reading over both the major and minor traits.  Some minor traits like Power of the Virtuous or Symbolic Power are actually pretty powerful.  I would have picked up Virtues last in favor of Zeal &amp; Radiance; Unscathed Contender is nice, but if you're new you're going to lose UC pretty quick.  
---
Generally speaking; abuse your utility -- blinds, pulls, knockdowns, stability, reflects, evades/dodges.  For example, with those traits every time you press F1 your next attack will blind up to 5 targets for 3s; which is great for all monsters that are veterans/elites or below.  You also have a lot of blocks due to Shield (5) and F3; also DH F3.  
---
An opener would look something like; Shield (5), Feel My Wrath --&gt; Judge's Intervention (on GS); GS4 =&gt; GS2 inside hitbox; if monster still not dead; weapon swap, F1 (2) (4); and auto-attack and kite back.   If multiple enemies use GS5 to pull them together before the GS 4/2 to maximize the damage from those skills (and stack up symbolic avenger).  Sword of Justice is another utility option that you can use while at high stacks of symbolic avenger for big damage.
---
It's nice if you can solo-break defiance bars (blue break-bars) for extra damage, but that probably won't happen solo.  However, in a group situation if you can break a blue bar with bane signet and share its effects with allies that'll be a dps spike and the boss/champion should go down a little more quickly.
---
What would you recommend in terms of Runes and Sigils?
---
"If you haven't interacted with the game before, it's great!"
---
"If you have any experience with the game, things are in a bad state"
---
The other thing that makes watching people play the game rough is that many of the people that play GW2 casually have no understanding of how to scale their damage or rotation.  It's painful to watch them struggle with easier content not because they're necessarily "bad" at the game, but because they have to spend 3-5x longer on mini-boss &amp; boss fights than someone that does better damage or is more comfortable surviving.
---
You could also try using Sword + Focus; Sword has a teleport and a shield against projectiles and focus has two very good defensive skills.
---
Scepter is also a fantastic weapon on Guardian, so also try that, specially as it's ranged.
---
Thank you for sending this, I appreciate it!
---
I haven't really tried the focus yet either. I will grab both then. Thank you!

Necro builds lean fully into power or condi, so you'll want both sets to get a good gauge for how the build feels.

Oh, wasn't trying to be a dick.  Was just saying, "hey, at least you're not getting screwed out of money."  Sorry it came off wrong.
---
It's all good, I ain't mad either way, but thank you for clarifying.
---
I hate watching story related content just because gw2’s narrative is so lack luster. Im not excited for whats to come. Season 3 was a clusterfuck of being all over the place and not making any sense story wise. The whole PoF story line did not make any sense for me being a gw1 player wherein we help balthazar’s eternals in their war with menzies then all of a sudden boom we need an avengers level threat. Season 4 was so dissapointing, killing aurene then boom reviving aurene 5 min later. And now icebrood saga fiasco. Lets see where this will take us.
---
I play gw2 for its combat as i truly enjoy it, if i want story, i play final fantasy 14. Like holy crap, politics, high fantasy, church coverups, dragonsong war, uprising, liberating nations, fighting the warriors of darkness ( the heroes of light turned darkness from another world ) , saving the other dimension, and now the copied factory.

Guardians are very strong in every game mode, as long as you build it the right way. I do not think the person you replied to knows what he's talking about.
---
Most of your problems honestly just around like the usual growing pains of someone learning a new game. The levels you're hovering around at the moment are far too low to give you a good idea of how classes will perform at 80.
---
Dude even a shade of brown would go a long way. I'm not saying "dye it blood red or venom green or it's Garbo!!!" I'm saying a splash might make it pop more.
---
Like just about every power class, Reaper benefits greatly from full Berserker armor because it has the most offensive stats, along with Scholar runes, and Force and Impact sigils. This is the most offensive-focused setup, and because Reaper is naturally very tanky on its own, going pure offense in traits, stats, runes, and sigils is definitely the way to get the best results with the class.

---
Ok boomer.
---
Yes, the boomers are the ones that support this game, and have done since launch.
---
Out of the box solution, damage wise: reroll to another class.
---
Necro together with all of its elite specs are one of the weakest in terms of damage with very little usefulness, even in end game content. 
---
What they do in end game raids and fractals are nowhere near what other classes can do, like guardians, thieves, mesmers, elementalists, and rangers. Even warriors bringing banners for 10man buffs can do higher than necros. 
---
Sure they're great in open world for survivability but other classes just do more damage and are the same if not better at tagging mobs.
---
Thank you!
---
I appreciate a good story where there is one, but stories in MMOs are pretty much irrelevant to me. Just like they are in multiplayer shooters, fighting games, sports games.. well, anything that isn't mostly story-oriented.
---
The story does sort of create the world the MMO takes place in, but after that it simpy comes down to other content, such as competitive modes, PvE group content, and endless grinding to get the best stats and the coolest fashion. That's what MMOs are *about*. I'm going to make a wild bet and say that most players probably play the story episodes through once or twice, and the rest of their hours come from elsewhere.
---
I play single-player games for the story experiences, and multiplayer games for other reasons. That's why I think any possible GW2 social media creators should focus mostly on the other aspects of the game, since I doubt the great majority of potential new players will be interested in it very much. I believe OP is in the minority here, just as they stated themself.
---
spite/soul reaping are the best traitlines for reaper as it's a very power-based class. if you're still set on keeping death magic, i would pick shrouded removal, deadly strength, and corrupter's fervor, since it's a free condi cleanse, you get up to an additional 300 power, and reaper can apply a lot of vuln and chill so you should also be able to keep your carapace stacks up for the power boost and protection.
---
DIO with the cape coming
---
I'm in the same situation. lol
---
Most arguments of the kind "My game is special, so it doesn't apply to it" are dumb.
---
Most arguments of the kind "I feel like..." / "My friends.../All the players I know..." are also totally unreliable.
---
It's more worth selling the crystaline dust you need for it
---
Yeah, unfortunately. You will need to max those 2 tracks to get shards, but you do *not* need griffon or skyscale to get shards. Of course, if you unlock either (or both) of those, you'll need to max it (or them) as well.
---
As note, it's the same story with Ancient Magics for HoT xp. You'll need to max that along with the 4 main HoT masteries to get shards in HoT areas. Raids is hidden, so (like Griffon and Skyscale) it doesn't count until you unlock it.
---
It's weird that they didn't put all LS masteries as hidden, as before LS3E1 they hid Raids (on HoT release, you had to complete a raid encounter to unlock and max that mastery track, in order to gain shards), and they hid Skyscale when that was released, so they have the tech to do it and they have demostrated that they can hide them after the fact.
---
Usually you cap crit chance with gear, food, fury, and other buffs (at least that's what the build aims to do). The passive 3% damage bonus then becomes better than crit chance. Also even if your build doesn't have many if any stuns or knockdowns, enemies with defiance bars still usually get stunned on when the bar is broken (and usually take more damage too) and other players can still CC enemies.
---
Some you just don't cross, dude

FACTS
---
Are we expecting Wintersday this week? It has been as early as 10th before, but I can't remember if they announce a week prior or not.
---
2 handed melee weapons that do a lot of cleave would help if you are leveling fighting small group of mobs, 2 handed single target range weapons that do conditional damage would do well against bosses. Just follow this simple rule and you should have no problem leveling
---
Also you're a dumb cunt. Die mad about it
---
What is that beautiful armor?
---
Like I said, without unique identification and they have the motivation to do it they will do it. I never have done this before but a quick search online turned up a lot of stuff that probably even one who doesn't know anything about it could follow.
---
So the "another step" wouldn't really help in any way.
---
&gt; Another thing they could do is put the accounts that said accounts send stuff to under a list for watching more closely.
---
How will they get those accounts though? Look at the situation!
---
Not too long ago ArenaNet used and deployed a tool on the players computers to scan for malicious software like CheatEngine, people got banned because of it even though they never used it in GW2 itself a lot of people were also banned because of a bug in the detection software because it hashed an empty string/file [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/aktctr/more_information_on_arenanets_mistake_in_april/). There was a big uproar in the community on how could ArenaNet do this.
---
So you have a conflict here, players don't want to be spied upon but also they want those hackers and botters get caught. Unfortunately, just by the nature of that software is that they want to be hard to detect or they aren't useful. Now, how will the Server, as most likely location for that detection software, distinguish between the data a legit player is sending to the server and a Bot? That is the real problem here.
---
An example, on when those things actually misfired. A while ago there were reports of players getting banned because the detection software thought they were teleporting across the map but in reality, it was that those players were just that fast by using game mechanics like teleports from a thief.
---
Just for clarifications here since I'm always misunderstood. I'm not defending the bots or ArenaNet in their practices I just want to point out that most ideas that the users have are really just that, ideas, which don't work in the real world because there is no global observer that specifically know what someone can do and what not. You would need a highly intelligent AI which would create false positives more often than anything.
---
If there was a 100% way to identify cheaters and hackers and botters then you would think that this would have spread like a wildfire on a dry summer day through the industry but since it hasn't the hunt for those things will always be a cat chasing a mouse.

&gt; so the twists and turns in just GW2 make it hard to flush out the lore.
---
There are no twists and turns in GW2 story. It's plaine and predictable
---
Wait, there are people who play GW2 because of the story? What? GW2 has many good things going for it, but the story was certainly never one of them. It's pretty mediocre overall and there is very little of it. There are other MMOs the blow GW2's story out of the water in both quantity and quality.

The argument is not "they don't have time to watch because they are playing," but more "they don't *want* to watch, but that doesn't mean they don't play." It's typically raised in a counter to the invalid argument that "because GW2 does not do well on Twitch, it is failing as a game."

---
I mainly use greatsword but switch to sword and pistol when my interrupts are on cooldown.
---
I can give you more details when I get home if you like :)
---
Yes, this is precisely what I meant. I agree Arenanet's storytelling has improved amazingly over the past couple years, but in the end it's still a very mediocre story in the grand scheme of things. Especially compared to narrative-focused single player games where the story plays a major part throughout the game, instead of being just a very small part of the overall package.
---
The story of GW2 at this point, to a new player, would feel very messy and unorganized. (The chaotic structure of the releases; expansions, living story, etc. definitely doesn't sound very inviting or newbie-friendly either). Dragons, gods, random characters who sometimes appear in the story episodes and sometimes don't and are thus very hard to bond with. Dragon-slaying, cliches, saving the world over and over again. Your basic average fantasy story. There isn't any kind of a strong backbone to the plot that would separate it from other MMOs story-wise.
---
And before you downvote; I want to emphasize I actually like and enjoy the story, even though I don't think it's anything *special*, and it's definitely not the main reason why I play this game. I'm trying to form my points from a new-player perspective. If I was a new player, the story simply wouldn't sound interesting or different enough for me to try the game out. However, if the gameplay features are inviting and clearly stand out from the masses, a decent story slapped on top of that wouldn't hurt. But again, it's just not special enough to be a major selling point.
---
LB/GS DH using Judge’s Intervention &amp; 4 traps. I pew-pew things from a range, switch to GS, teleport, drop 3 traps (4th is a heal) and melt stuff.

I just got one of those vertical mice to help with wrist strain. The mouse has the functions of the left and right buttons swapped, which Guild Wars 2 has adapted to with no issue...except for the camera controls. Turning is still mapped to the left button, pressing the right button still does free camera. Everything else works as expected. Does anyone know if there's a way to reverse these button functions?
---
1. No 
---
2. Buy PoF, as it, by now, includes HoT.   
---
If buying the XPac will upgrade your Account from F2P, you would obviously get to enjoy full Access to the limited Features during your Play.   
---
Some may argue you should unlock the Raptor Mount in PoF's first mission as soon as possible, but it will influence your pre-PoF experience. I recommend waiting until the story takes you there. 
---
3. Theres a few more ways to get dungeon currency. Dungeons and Fractals are not *that* hard, you just have to know/learn what youre doing.

The #2 on the greatsword feels weird, but once you get to used to trying to rub your body against whatever you are fighting, it does decent damage. The trick is to try to get inside the hitbox of what you are fighting as much as possible so plenty of the projectiles actually connect.
---
As you are levelling, you could probably just as easily take sword+focus/torch instead of greatsword if you prefer the feel of it, and whatever you want in your second weapon set, but the PvE "meta" at level 80 heavily uses greatsword, so it's probably a good idea to get used to how it plays.
---
Fuck no
---
First of all, welcome back! I have a comprehensive guide to the game you may use as a reference [here](https://bit.ly/guidegw2). I recommend bookmarking it and at the bare minimum please read the story section, as it'll probably answer a lot of the questions you'll have in regards to what order to tackle content in. Now to answer your current questions:
---
1. Nope. Living World Seasons 2, 3, 4 and if you're missing the prologue to the current Icebrood Saga will be all you need. As long as you log in while episodes are active, you'll receive future episodes for free. I don't use any of the QoL stuff and I'm fine without it, but that's up to you.
---
2. You won't need to, but for some it's nice to unlock mounts since they will be unlocked account-wide (specifically just the first one, raptor, to avoid most spoilers in the plot). If you can do without, then don't grab 'em yet. They're very affordable though from dlgamer. Here's the [US link](https://www.dlgamer.com/us/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43807) and here's the [EU one](https://www.dlgamer.com/eu/games/buy-guild-wars-2-path-of-fire-43768).
---
3. You won't need the dungeon gear and even if you did want it for the aesthetics or perhaps you want certain runes that come from dungeons, they're much easier due to power creep throughout the years. Fractals were revamped to have 4 tiers, so even if you wanted to do just tier 1, you'll at least get to see all the fractals without seeing the more difficult mechanics. The fractals that were released after your absence are pretty good! Once you start, you might be motivated to keep going though! 
---
4. If you ever plan on getting gen 2 legendaries, you'll need to craft them. Also some stat-combos are difficult to obtain outside of crafting. It's not much work to follow [gw2crafts.net](http://gw2crafts.net/) . But if you want to sell mats, that's fine too. Mid-level mats are the most profitable, such as those obtained from having lvl 49-53 characters open containers you obtain from running events and such (not to be confused with unidentified gear). But that's something you can look more into later.
---
Lastly, I do recommend everyone try raiding at some point during their time playing GW2. It seems very intimidating, but it's honestly a ton of fun as long as you're with people who are positive and are willing to teach you the ropes. There are also strike missions now which serve as a way to bridge the gap between open world PvE and raid difficulty. 
---
That's something to consider down the road! If you have any additional questions, feel free to reply or PM me :)
---
Probably get an announcement for it tomorrow, and it will start on the 17th
---
Please don't listen to that guy, I beg you. Guardian and its two elite specs are probably the most sought-after and well balanced (some would argue overpowered) in the game at the moment. Do not "gear for vitality and toughness", especially whilst levelling. Power (+precision when you get two stats, and +ferocity when you start getting three stats on your gear at around level 60) all the way for levelling.
---
&gt; Dungeons and Fractals are not that hard
---
Perhaps my experience was skewed due to the fact that I always played with randoms. Or maybe I'm just a bad player.
---
I'll assume that my guide answered your questions but if it didn't, or you have more to ask let me know (always looking for feedback on the guide or what sections people want me to work on next)

Oh :( sadness
---
That Guy time.
---
Happi are cut square and don't flare and the trim around the neck and front is the same as the trim on the sleeves and hemline.
---
The pattern is anything goes but it usually used to promote.
---
Another of those post
---
I played free version for &lt;nearly zero time&gt; did it change we?
---
So u can post with your alt account
---
Game is deeeeeead
---
It takes a lot of patience to get it right. Takes me 30 minutes if you really want details...
---
&gt; the subreddit for this game is very anti-Eastern;
---
You're going too far with this statement. Lots of people want to see Cantha again in GW2 but what they don't want is anything that would fill this game with same looking cliche samurai-ninja-Sasuke-whatever characters or in worst case, full of characters wearing school uniforms available thru gemstore (which are still within dat archive).
---
Asura eRP is fun to play. Build is nude with all racial skills
---
We only like spikes, space bikinis and full plate spiky plate with particle vomit.
---
&gt;Vets essentially enable the more complex parts of the game by guiding people through them. Be it collection guides, class builds, raid tactics or team composition. Hell, even commanders. 
---
Yes, Vets do that.
---
&gt;None of those would exist without vets, leading to less and basic doable content, which in turn leads to people leaving earlier out of boredom. 
---
Perhaps, if Vets did leave. 
---
&gt;So saying everything is fine because things work at the moment is equally as silly as doomsayers calling the game already dead.
---
But the thing is, vets aren't going anywhere. Vets are still playing, still having fun, still making guides and leading players around. 
---
The people who are whining constantly *may* be vets themselves, or not, but they do not represent "all the vets," they only represent themselves. And boy do they whine. All day, all night. But they are still irrelevant. They can go, nobody will miss them, plenty of vets will still be here, still playing the game, still enjoying the game, still helping others along. The only thing that's practically changed over the last year or so is that Dulfy is gone, and that had nothing to do with GW2, she left *all* her games due to some sort of personal reasons. We'll make do.
---
Leveling crafting disciplines and crafting exotic gear is soooo much more expensive than just buying the sets named after npcs from the tp. The berserker medium set is called Nika's boots/gloves etc. for example.
---
I think back then, the dungeons really did seem hard in comparison to the open core world, which was (and still is) very easy. HoT really forced people to step up their game, as it was quite a significant difficulty bump. 
---
These days, there also just a lot more knowledge in the player base on how to take on the existing dungeons, so pugging them is pretty easy. Dungeons also have been pretty well put on ice, as a concept, and fractals have taken over as the bite-sized instanced content mode.
---
The new Strike missions are yet another thing, intending to ease people into raids (and fractals perhaps?). They are 20 man, single boss mini-raids.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Open_World has multiple builds for necro which are all predy decent for doing open-world stuff and leveling
---
Yes and no. Ascended gear is Accountbound on Acquire, but the materials to make ascended weapons and armor can be bought and sold on the TP. That being said, you still have to have 500 in the appropriate crafting profession and the appropriate recipes.
---
Ascended trinkets are 'easy' to get, but only the backpacks' mystic forge recipes (ingredients) can be bought from the TP.
---
&gt; It's rare you'll find an MMORPG like GW2 where say, beast races for example don't look like children or sexy cat people.
---
Every single big mmo has that. BDO probably the only exception.
---
Ascended armor can be crafted, or dropped (rarely), not bought.
---
The only thing you can do is get that d912pxy and reduce character limit. Game is just not optimized to run on anything so hardware upgrades will not do anything significant.
---
Its normal to have this variation of Fps in Gw2 and others MMO. When you are in instance with only 5 or 10 players your Fps will be better. But in Open World depending how much players, Npc and how complex the map is will affect your Fps.
---
Even if you have the best computer available, you will have some Fps drop in condition I says.
---
What you could do, drop the graphic for characters or how much you render them. Otherwise graphic option like shadow or reflection.
---
Well, when thing started going south, and the game started to drift more and more away from where many people wanted to see it going, the community responses soured. And Anet doesn't like hearing complains and seeing negative reactions to what they do.
---
The same happened with forums much earlier, by the way.
---
Gw2s official streams have a whole series of problems.
---
I.e.
---
Heavy moderation of chat. Little to no interaction. No memes allowed. 
---
Devs are garbage at their own game. Gameplay is genuinely atrocious and very slow. 
---
No personality, no decent gameplay, no memes, no interaction... why watch? To streamsnipe or to hope they reveal some new info? 
---
It's no suprise they're not popular.
---
Japanese style what?
---
Pvp and wvw tournies were decent at some point in time too.
---
It's just that watching someone do world bosses is almost as braindead as doing world bosses. Maybe as an ASMR fall asleep stream.
---
&gt;The game's population has \*no relation\* to how many streamers it would have.
---
Well I didn't write that, but it has.
---
A game that has 10 players can't have 10.000 streamers.
---
&gt;If ALL he was doing was running content and occasionally narrating his actions, I would have no interest in that whatsoever.
---
True, I didn't say anything against that either, many people feel like that, not just GW2 players.
---
&gt;to break the game trying to appeal to Twitch viewers
---
Again, I didn't say anything on that, I don't expect nor want GW2 to spend resources on appealing to twitch viewers.
---
&gt;No they don't. They scale with viewership.
---
Which scales with player count... Again, the scaling may vary depending on games. But a 10 player game won't have a billion viewers. If that game suddently surged to a billion players, the viewership (and the buzz around the game) would surge too. 
---
You can even check by yourself: Take steam charts, take the top games by players check the twitch subs, the ranking conserves its order. Which is totally logical. There are only 3 possibilities:
---
1) viewership doesn't change with population.
---
2) viewership diminishes as population grows.
---
3) viewership increases as population grows.
---
Which other than n°3 are you defending?
---
Most content creators created content for pvp, wvw and raids / fractals. You know the "hardcore" gamemodes that are neglected entirely.
---
Gw2 isnt worth the effort to make content for.
---
Ok boomer
---
&gt; Black and white has its own charm.
---
If done properly. This was not done properly. So much wasted potential by not using different metallic blacks, other whites and paying more attention to details of the armors. Properly choosing colours for metallic parts, leather or cloth parts. He just slapped darkness and celestial on everything and called it a day.
---
Stagnant would be much better than it is. Viewer numbers arent stagnant, they're slowly but surely declining.
---
Completely agree. Now I wish I could refund all my redundant salvage-o-matics I bought bc it would "never" happen.
---
Food and rune salvaging and un-id'ed drops round out the top of QoLs for me.
---
Fractals are different then when you played last, they have 4 tiers now and only last tier is of similar difficulty of pre HoT/early fractals. Tier 1 fractals are really easy and doing tiers in order will help you learn them and ease you into Tier 4 where best rewards are.
---
About the second point, if you never heard of it, it means you don't need to worry about it. You bought the game before it was free to play, hence you have core account with no features limitations. Only things you would miss are from living seasons and expansions.
---
meta is fun, its fun to be efficient and do big deeps
---
My thoughts exactly! The mass player events are the most fun to play, but it's just a random clusterfuck of colours for anyone watching.
---
It’s not possible to get 60fps full time, nevermind 100. It’s not you, it’s the engine, as others have said. 
---
You can get some stability by increasing single core cpu performance, but there is not any way to brute force it in all situations. I would turn the max player count to low or medium and not try to chase this particular dragon.
---
https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/
---
&gt; No, again, that's not the case. 
---
That's number 1
---
&gt; I think it is likely that there is some degree of loose correlation,
---
That's number 3, although it's crazy to claim "loose correlation" when you can do the experience by yourself with steam charts and twitch. The correlation is not "loose" but overwhelmingly obvious. 
---
&gt; To Twitch viewership is the same way. If Fortnite streams have X people watching them, and Y people playing, while GW2 has X/10 viewers, does that mean that they have Y/10 players? No. That's certainly possible [...]
---
No, indeed, as I said it may vary. But the likely state (which is a verifiable truth) is that Fortnite has more players than GW2, viewer count is one of the many clues.
---
Back then dungeons were hard. Now there's plenty of power creep and people are generally a bit better. Also new mechanics, boons, conditions etc that didn't exist at launch.
---
Please no
---
Wow, this is really awesome! Hell of a job!
---
[removed]
---
Turn the screen upside down
---
The game is nearing maintenance mode as explained by Deroir on this [clip](https://clips.twitch.tv/WildSnappyGoblinSSSsss) so I wouldn't recommend picking it up now.
---
Niceeee. Where did u get that cape?
---
Asian art is welcome, weeb bullshit is not.
---
Sweet sweet loot...
---
&gt; That's number 3, although it's crazy to claim "loose correlation" when you can do the experiment by yourself with steam charts and twitch. 
---
Using Guild Wars 2? Again, what applies to one game does not necessarily translate to another. You could provide evidence that 100 games have Twitch ratings equivalent to their Steam revenues, and still have that not apply at all to a different game. Do you not understand why a player might be more or less interested in watching one game over another, without that being linked to his desire to play it himself? 
---
&gt; But the likely state (which is a verifiable truth) is that Fortnite has more players than GW2,
---
I think that *is* likely, if not certain, I expect that Fornite is probably in a different league in terms of population (and above anywhere GW2 could be expected to be), but if we're dealing with games closer to GW2's *expected" range, I imagine there are plenty of games that have way higher Twitch viewership than GW2, but lower player counts, and games with lower Twitch viewership that might have higher player counts. 
---
&gt;If Fortnite has 10.000 times the viewers of GW2, does that mean that Fortnite has more players: VERY LIKELY.
---
Sure. But does it mean that they have 10,000 *times* more? Or 1,000 times more? Or 100 times more? Or just twice as many? Impossible to tell.
---
&gt;The only thing you're saying is that is is indeed scaling but the factor may vary which is exactly what I said and agree on.
---
Well, again, it depends entirely on what you intend to do with the data. If you use it to say "Fortnite likely has more players than GW2, that's all." Then sure, I think in that case it's likely, at least. If you're using it to say "because Fornight has 10,000 times more viewers, it likely has at least 1,000 times more players," no, I don't think you can make that claim.  My point is that I don't think the Twitch numbers can be used to make *accurate* assumptions about the GW2 playerbase that one could use in supporting other arguments about the direction of the game. If you just want to get into semantic discussions about math terms, I'm not really interested in that. 
---
&gt;But yes it's true that there are MANY reasons that make GW2 less desirable to watch, less interesting to talk about,... not just the population. I just try to avoid criticizing the game too overtly in this subreddit.
---
I just don't see "GW2 is not fun to watch" as a *useful* criticism, because this is a game, not a program. Its watchability is a tertiary concern, and the reasons that it is less watchable than other games does not make it any less fun to play. Making the game more fun to watch would not necessarily make it any more fun to play, and might actually *harm* its playability.
---
i'd suggest aiming for something like [this](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?PSwEE6MssCGC7gtxKxR6qsZD-zRIYRU/XG1mCVUB+NA-e/). i run pretty much the same for open world, just with scholar runes instead. vampirism runes are rather cheap and offer a lot of luxury at the same time for people who still struggle a bit. if conditions become an issue you can swap out well or corruption or spectral grasp, depending on the environement, for spectral walk. anything that isn't upscaled should die in 5s max.
---
Oh hey, that's Magneto!
---
had the same problem with gtx 1050ti,  I updated the bios and set ram timings to 2866  instead of  auto (2400) , which solved it completly
---
That's specieist.
---
Personally, I just wish they'd let us buy keys (or shit even the currencies) with the garbage ascended mats from each map.
---
50 airship oil for a crowbar? Yes please.
---
WP is a years long content creator that  for other MMO standards is still just a dwarf. 
---
Puts things into perspective.
---
I'm personally a fan of playing a core Guardian focused on Symbols  (in open world PvE, lower level fractals and story). Sword/Focus + Scepter/Focus using Zeal / Radiance / Honor and full signets. It might not be meta, it might not be optimal, but it's effective enough for my purposes and I have fun with it. 
---
Since you asked about Engineer I enjoy Scrapper with Alchemy and Firearms, either with a focus on Flamethrower and Condi or with a focus on Hammer and Power. Although 'Nades Engineer with Explosives and Firearms is alright as well.
---
I actually need airship oil lol. The issues of making a bunch of HoT legendaries...
---
Not the bees!
---
i miss this path tbh
---
Honestly, I don't see anyone going through the trouble of engineering a bot to successfully complete roller beetle races, especially when leveling in GW2 is already pretty quick if you know what to do. Just leave a bot killing neutral creatures overnight and you're max level by morning.
---
Besides, does level 80 even benefit botters in any way? The F2P restrictions will still be in place, and the only thing I can think of is parking the toons at high-level zones, at the end of jumping puzzles for example. But you can still reach most if not all JPs in Core Tyria even at level 2 afaik, and I don't believe even that to be lucrative at all. 
---
I think the beetle races should definitely award XP, as it would fit the game's overall theme where pretty much *everything* awards you XP. Maybe limit the XP gain to only one daily completion of bronze, silver and gold to reduce newbies leveling "too fast".
---
I just don't understand why people downvote guides...
---
Ahh Centaur, gotcha. Thanks!
---
Going from 960Ti to 1660Ti is actually a huge upgrade in performance. Sure you will get better graphic but going from a 1660Ti to a 2080Ti will not improve your Fps because right now your Gpu might not reach 100% like your old 960Ti should have. Yeah sure, a 2080Ti could push 4k with supersample, etc... but with high graphic and regular wide screen 1660Ti shouldnt run at 100%.
---
To optimize Gw2 performance you must check Cpu AND Gpu workload when you play, but with modern Gpu and the optimisation does by Anet during those last years, really improve how Gpu influence the Fps. But you get capped with card like GTX1070, GTX980Ti or higher. Same could be apply to Cpu and at the same time Single Thread performance is priority due to how Gw2 is coded. If you lower your graphic, you will notice at some point that your Gpu no longer bottleneck and at this points you will notice a corelation between Cpu load and Fps drop. To minimize those Fps drop you have 2 choices, lower Cpu intensive Graphic option or increase your Cpu to run this workload. At the end, if you still have "drop" even if the workload isn't at 100% on Cpu and/or Gpu. Its due to multiple option, internal speed between memory, board, Cpu, etc...
---
1. No.

2. No.  
---
No.
---
3. No.    
---
No. 
---
4. N- I mean - Both gathering and crafting take some time, and you need to gather the materials to craft. Crafting stuff yourself is cheaper than buying it, and there's something that can only be obtained by crafting. Si I'd just keep th ematerials and slowly use them to learn crafting disciplines until you max them.

Always nice to see heavy plated leggings (since there are only like 2 other pants skins without skirts)

Just figured I'd add to this to emphasise how little difference hardware makes: I have a 9700K with all 8 cores overclocked to 5.2ghz and a 2080ti - I can run the new COD in 4k at 80-90fps and GW2 still runs like absolute shit.

It'd be nice, but I suspect sale length takes into account the player psychology aspect of how people will buy more if the sale is shorter. The "fear of missing out"

It is fascinating watching all the mental gymnastics people go through to be angry at *anything*
---
This is not true. You can buy ascended gear in fractals, raids, WvW and PvP. You can ofc just not step in and buy them you need currency for the game mode and some require ranks or the like.
---
Nice, glad you shared! I feel like I am still trying to figure out what to do with capes since so many outfits were made without having the option of capes. I feel like some experimentation is still needed. Sorry for all the haters in here.

Install it, me 9900KS 50-70 FPS stable even in huge fight
---
WvW, PvP, Fractals and Raids sell ascended gear. But you will have to farm for currency and ranks and in some cases as in WvW it might take way longer then just level your crafting up. But it is possible if you don't want to do crafting at all.
---
I like core power warrior (bannerslave), mostly for how easy it is. The hardest part about the build is not having ranged weapons (axe/axe + mace/mace) but you'll have the ability to break almost any CC bar, lots of support, survivability, and power.
---
It's like a mini wolverine just hacking and slashing and dodging stuff. If you play solo it's also very easy/fast to change banners to something else.
---
One of the reasons i picked GW2 is because it does not look like sexy plush toys where females walk like they are missing a few horses in the stable. 
---
If you want to play that, then you have a shit ton of other mmo some very very popular to go with.
---
If you ask for a few armor skin or the like then sure why not, i can just ignore wearing them, but no puffy tails, my god if i see puffy tails i swear i will revolt and join the pitchfork horde!
---
Mutant scum !
---
I want for guys but this is the picture show more effectiveXD
---
So this is why Anet nerfed the Cat Tonic's Leap. Good find though!
---
&gt; Perfect, nobody made that claim so we're fine.
---
/sigh, aren't you though? *Aren't* you making the the claim that because GW2's Twitch viewerships are lower than certain other games, that its playerbase is significantly lower as well? I'm not saying it's up there with the absolutely *most* popular games out there, but I do think its population is up there with its peers, within the margin of where it reasonably *should* be. 
---
Maybe I'm assuming too much, what point *are* you attempting to make beyond arguing semantics? What important data do *you* believe can be inferred about the game "Guild Wars 2" based on its Twitch streaming statistics?
---
&gt;Nobody made that claim either.
---
You apparently haven't been paying attention to the discussion for long, this claim tends to arise fairly regularly, or at minimum is implied in arguments like "GW2's Twitch viewership is low, the game is in decline and must repent!"
---
There are a few skins to use https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Buccaneer_armor this chest is one that is good on male and asura (who usually get the male version anyway)

---
Well there are a lot more just check your bank tab and you can very likely put together a set that will close to what you look for.
---
1. It's still pretty much just Living World DLC, skins/toys, and QoL items. Though the "types" of skins and similar "cosmetic fun items" have expanded greatly - miniatures, armor, weapon, outfits, gliders, mounts, novelties - and some get rather pricy: too pricy in my books.
---
2. You do not. Expansion content doesn't affect the main story, with the sole exception of the revenant profession since there's still no profession-swap in the game. However, you need expansions to continue the story beyond the main game and Season 2. That said, expansions do add masteries which affect your gameplay in all maps (**NOT** instances!), such as mounts (PoF) or gliding (HoT) though you need to start the expansion stories to unlock the ability to gain them, and play in the expansion maps to further unlock higher tiers.
---
3. Exotics are fairly easy to get all things considered; some generic level 80s you can even buy on the trading post for less than a gold each with ease. But exotics are also no longer the top tier gear, which is not Ascended. The difference between the two is minimal. Dungeons have also suffered from powercreep in the game, and most dungeons don't need full teams anymore - they're also consdered dead content. Fractal difficulty varies based on your tier - it goes up to level 100 now, with the top two levels having challenge modes. Tier 1 and 2 are fairly easy, Tier 3 varies on the fractal and/or team, and Tier 4 varies on the team.
---
4. Varies. There are some things that you can make profit even by buying the materials for, but it requires a bit of research (gw2efficiency will help); however, overall I think it's more lucrative to sell what you get.
---
There is a client that updates the d912pxy ans installs it automatically to save some time

If you like reaper check out wooden potatoes video https://youtu.be/7-Djf9847Lk
---
He breaks down how you want to use it.  My build is pretty close to what he uses and is still very effective.  This build has a few variants.  
---
One warning using a power reaper can make every other character in the game feel super squishy without a little time to readjust to them
---
If you want to use condition damage don't use soul reaping, use death magic with  [Corrupter's Fervor](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Corrupter%27s_Fervor) and  [Deadly Strength](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Deadly_Strength). ["Rise!"](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/%22Rise!%22) is also good defensive skill which not just reduces incoming damage but also takes the agro when you activate it against group of enemies. Also if you are using Chill to the bones for elite skill, use [Augury of Death](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Augury_of_Death) trait since you would be having at least 2 shout skills along with "Rise". For weapons use staff and sceptre.
---
It's mostly people that have invested in the game, seen so much potential be squandered, quit, and are upset to see something like so much be in the state that it's in.
---
It's the hardcore gamers that control the narrative of how good the game is.  You don't see many people playing casually in gaming communities talking about the game or how much they enjoy it.
---
Anet has abandoned this group and many were highly invested and are now salty to see that investment squandered by Anet.  So people are giving thier honest opinion.  And it's not an unreasonable one.
---
This game has had its end game abandoned and is highly casual.  Thier focus is churning out people to try the game and hope they buy some stuff on thier way out.  Long term retention is not a goal at Anet anymore.  The hard truth is, vets are just not profitable for thier business model.
---
This is wonderful news! It’s what I enjoy most but always thought I was waiting my time playing it meta events. Thanks so much, that’s made me quite happy to know it has a place. I’m okay with it not being the absolute must. But viable is good!
---
The subreddit is in this weird state where they want the game to succeed while also wanting Anet to suffer for misusing the trust the players had in this game.
---
The money GW2 generates did not get reinvested into gw2, and still does not, looking at recent releases.
---
Until Anet actually talks about things, it's totally justifyable to tell people to stay away if they seek a proper MMO.

This sub is gone. It's actively sabotaging the game. In a sane world, posts like these would be highly upvoted, even by haters, just to support the game. But everything gets downvoted to oblivion. Especially content creators are being met with an amount of toxicity that's baffles the mind.

It's also basic gw2 design problem. Anet is kind of collecting old content and all what players here can do is to repeat it over and over again. So new player will achieve everything pretty fast. With veterans help. Because they all already did it hundreds of times. In every normal mmorpg both groups: old and new players are learning new things together. So basic gw2 design is problem and it won't be fixed here no matter what Anet do because it's kind of impossible.
---
People are people. They all have noses. I stopped playing back after the Scarlette Attack on LA and just came back last month. Im having a blast tbh.
---
I would imagine it is the uncertain future of the game, along with the playerbase being completely on-edge because of it.
---
Are you going for the raid armor?
---
Yep. For the skin!
---
I never got around to doing any dungeons until after Season 1, so I missed out on this dungeon path completely.  Every time I do TA, I glance over at the Forward-Up path and sigh.
---
Looking to make a healer, what would be the cheapest way for me to craft ascended harrier armor? GW2 efficiency says they cost around 40 gold to craft, but I'm guessing it assumes you already have the recipes—The recipes are around 40-60 gold on the TP. I could convert a set of armor, but I don't have many ascended recipes on me, and the insignias I would need to craft these cost around 40 gold themselves.
---
I think you misunderstand my meaning. I don't mean that the plot was dynamic and interesting, I mean that the story often does things without a correlating line of events. For example, we all knew that we'd face Joko after the PoF storyline, but there was no explanation to how Joko escaped that weird purgatory we found him in. There are also elements that just kind of Dues Ex Machina, like how we just so happen to arrive on Mordremoth's doorstep and we instantly know his "weakness". Even the whole Jormag and Primodious being each other's weakness was kind of lame.
---
If you enjoy the raids you could keep playing them. You'll also swim in ascended gear and don't have to grind lw maps for them.
---
hi Frozen, it was still going on when you sent your message but I've only just now seen it (it ended this morning). do go ahead and joint he server if you're interested in learning to raid though - we still have trainings every week whether or not the event is active.
---
If you're having fun in game with your friends, just dont come to reddit, problem solved.
---
We needed something positive like this what with all the fire going through the subreddit right now. Gotta remember to laugh.
---
Made my day!! Really miss those Times.
---
Thanks a bunch guys!
---
Yesss my favourite guild wars 2 series is back! Loved it as always!
---
I don't think the link you shared is actually for Crossroads Inn - that subreddit is for a different game altogether. But for /u/Biao_str if you go to [Snow Crows](https://snowcrows.com/raids/training/) they have links to the EU discords.
---
you can definitely still join the server - we run trainings every week even when we aren't doing these weekend events.
---
Welcome to GW2 lol
---
When ever I play the game I am actually amazed how many people are in basically every zone. When ever I need to do a meta or group event for any collection there are always enough people for it on the map. I play Gw2 on and off as I do with world of warcraft. In Gw2 I always feel overwhelmed about what I still can do. There are tons of achievements, collections and new stuff to explore. In wow I get bored really fast after new content comes out. Sure wow is the game to go if you like to repeat the same thing over and over again every day. But I enjoy my time in Gw2 a lot more.
---
but the slot from HoT is unique and not counted against the cap.
---
I figured that was it. I’m not generally one to play MMOs heavily during the endgame as I find the journeys much more enjoyable. That’s good to hear then.
---
We realy should start "A jumping puzzle guild tries to raid" videos...
---
Well done, Silver!
---
Yeah that’s about where I was. Two full expansions to run through and mounts and gliders has me excited
---
Get the Firearms specialization and pick the Juggernaut trait, gives you might while you hold the flamethrower.
---
I suck at remembering names, but I'm pretty sure that's where I saw them too!
---
This was a commissioned piece done for a wedding anniversary!

A little late to the party, but I'm gonna disagree a bit and give you a condi-workable reaper instead of just telling you to go power. Sure, it won't be as perfectly efficient as power, but fun in open world is more important. Keep in mind, you should listen to all the other people in this thread if you plan on doing end-game content with this.
---

---
Curse for condi damage, DM cause you want it and it's cool, reaper for reaper. You essentially inflict bleeding anytime you chill someone, which you can do a good bit of. Scepter/dagger will be where you wanna sit for most condition application, when you go into reaper shroud use 5 on the enemies and 4 within in to chill/bleed a lot of people.
---
I chose the skills in there because the 1st two are just great in open world movement and the well will blind-&gt;chill-&gt;bleed. 
---
Runes... maybe lich for health and condi since you said you wanna be survivable. Sigils... I guess bursting and whatever. It ain't that deep in open world.
---
What you *actually* mean is humanoid, I think.
---
The new tab is littered with the corpses of submissions about new content creators.
---
So nice to see this! It’s been too long
---
What an amazing guild !
---
The repeatable content in this game is called PvP and WvW. Someone should tell ArenaNet.
---
Thanks, I hate this.
---
Raids/fractals using drops and raid currency. Then craft and stat convert what you don’t have.
---
Keep in mind that converting ascended gear needs an exotic inscription/insignia - not an ascended one. It’s actually way cheaper than buying the Harrier recipes.
---
The aquatic fractal is annoying because of massive healing debuffs and that stupid life drain in the dark shit. The actual combat itself is fine.
---
&gt;you are just telling 10-20k viewers to not play or watch the game
---
yep. also known as, you know, "not recommending something"
---
&gt;game that you like.
---
that was a looong time ago.
---
how are you putting blame on people for the game dying? people didn't quit for no reason. it's effect of serious problems with the game given how it's mismanaged/underdeveloped.
---
You should be able to craft a full cheap set for 200g and just stat swap
---
I watch a streamer while playing games myself. It's a form of entertainment. 
---
If the streamer is boring I move on to something else.
---
Why would you go to a theatre to watch people talk or a concert to listen to people sing.
---
Entertainment
---
If [PINK] could portal us past the bosses, that would be wonderful!
---
Oh even they play classic now. Sad face. Anyway great fun to watch this.
---
we always do. We thirst for more lol
---
We did the boneskinner with two renegades; turns out that self might buffing and vuln application is really good and there really isn’t anything that can sustain quite like these BIG LEGENDS while dishing out the big damage!  
---
(even with scuffed rotations)
---
**Notable happenings:**  
---
Coordinating legend swaps for soulcleave uptime  
---
Buffing eachother with resistance for damage reduction  
---
Ascended food is very overpowered  
---
Frailty sigil, ashen demeanor &amp; Icerazor for vuln  
---
Heroic command and fire field blasts for might  
---
Rune of tormenting is broken  
---
Double all for one for massive protection uptime  
---
Your left ear will enjoy this
---
I always keep an eye out for a new vid from you. Glad to see you back.
---
Oh the community was very positive for a loooooooong time but at some point of being disappointed it just flipped. Sorry we're not happy instead of an addon after 2 years (which is already a slow cycle) we get this total bs aka templates and 30 fing more minutes of story.
---
True, true. I guess in general I really meant to say that you always see the "weird" races perform worse than the others.
---
They broke it after a patch, then removed it instead of fixing the problem they created.
---
It probably is. I guess it's not a rare occurrence then :D
---
most streamers get nothing out of the companies that make the games they play outside maybe early access and very few game commodities.
---
Nothing can stop the power of SOULCLEAVE.
---
There is Ho-Ho-Tron mini. Blik, blonk, blink, blonk.... (one of the rare minis that drives u crazy)
---
"I can't wait for reddit to tell me how I shouldn't be enjoying this!"
---
Yeah, "traditional elves" tend to perform well, too. Guess as the other comment said, it's more "humanoids".
---
I agree with you, of all the achievements I've tried to go back and do, LW Season 2 was dreadful. Especially that one where you're fighting some Ascalonian ghost in a statue , you need to sit through like 10 minutes of dialogue and other stuff and if you get hit by 1 peice of falling rubble (That also goes through aegis) you have to start all over. 
---
Now my biggest hurdle is trying to do that one in Bitterfrost with the freezing.
---
"one of the least played paths" is what the source says fwiw
---
Impressive
---
Yeah.......so anyways mini-o-tron anyone? XD
---
Yes I know about that insufferable mini bell player, still hoping for a non-wintersday one, besides rytlock has 3 mini versions and aurene and faren have like 7 :P
---
And people still try to force holy trinity on this game.
---
NO CAPES!!!
---
Boon power firebrand. With all the boon duration you get perma quickness, perma retal, might that stacks to 25 and your choices of high uptime on stability, swiftness, protection, regen etc. Quickness is always fun for how burstly it makes your damage but you usually can't reliably maintain it on anything that isn't a support class. Guardian is a glass cannon class type (shares the lowest HP with ele and thief) and has insanely bursty aoe  skills with greatsword.
---
With All the boons this thing poops out I can jump into a WvW camp and blender mode down the scouts, guards and supervisor in less than 2 seconds without doing anything other than symbol+whirl. I haven't found anything that can wreck a camp that quick.
---
This is btw completely ignoring the primary purpose of the build which is to share those tasty boons with 5 allies.
---
Like you could do the same boon gear on a mesmer  or scrapper for quickness but the personal damage output wouldn't be even remotely close to the same.
---
This is typical elitist behavior. posting a record right before meta reset. We've seen this before from qT and SC and now we even see it from SALT. Fucking terrible.
---
Oh right, thanks for the reply. I'd really appreciate it if you are able to give me the details on how to recreate it? Thank you again :)
---
Ok I'll try and do that. Thanks for the reply :)
---
Wtf is a thumbs downed?
---
I had no idea I was doing it, but a quick search showed that it's fine depending on where you are. 1-2% of the US uses "on accident" over "by accident".
---
past tense: downed; past participle: downed. 
---
I wish you were half as clever as you think you are.
---
Forgot to mention the mist factions will be based on the human gods.
---
But what of the balthazar faction?
---
Will we ever know whats going on with lyssa?
---
Tune in as we reveal all this for our Guild Wars 20th anniversary !
---
Mine opens to mini tab fairly often, or just to 'none' of them, and I have to select tab manually. Even if I JUST left equipment tab. It's ruther annoying.
---
Total DPS was 34k. Couldn't a full DPS plus healer achieve a similar number?
---
I normally do a full clear of w1-4 within a few hours (if I’m lucky). The remaining part of week is dead.
---
cant do too much content? every update is like half an hour of content. I'd take 17 wings and bewildered newcomers over a wing maybe every 6 months. and then theres everything other than story and the gem store. when's the last time there were actual updates to pvp or wvw other than slight tweaks? when's the last time a fractal came out? gvg support? guild features in general?
---
Reddit didnt commission this Im sure. Also, since when are ads allowed?
---
and theyre all grammatically wrong. "on" implies intent. You cant have an intentional accident. Thats why its "by". Just like you cant say by purpose.
---
It honestly sounds like your main argument is "ANet can't make a big game because new players might be scared off by it."
---
Which is nonsense.
---
New players already join on this subreddit and ask tons of questions, feel overwhelmed, and it's been that way for a long time. Keeping the existing playerbase engaged does *not* make the game any more daunting than it already is. And some people love the idea of knowing there's a massive amount of content to explore, even if it takes them months or years to see it all.
---
If that's not the point, I totally missed it, because you just keep repeating "they can't. It's bad. They don't want to," which isn't even an argument.
---
With the price of the recipes, converting armour from another stat set is probably the easiest for you.  Get an Exotic Harrier's Insignia recipe from a heart in the early Path of Fire zones for that.
---
I should check and confirm, though, are you making a healer specifically for Fractals?  If you're not intending to do high-level Fractals, then exotic Harrier's Armour will be perfectly fine for you, and save you a lot of gold.
---
Gw2 is designed more like a single player game. Not mmo. That's why this game have already enough content. Gw2 is finished game in some way. Right now it just have to make money, nothing else.
---
You must be lost
---
Good argument. Pick your battles dude. You clearly have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Not without quickness and no mechanics
---
[deleted]
---
Same! Just wish i could put more money into the game like I used to.
---
&gt; repeatable
---
That is actually the biggest problem. If they want something to last a while they focus more on stretching things out with things like time gate or some sort of grind instead of making things people would want to repeat.
---
This is how gw2 is designed and I can agree its not good but they can't change it just like that. It's core of this game.
---
Six wings per year
---
You can do 5-7 and exchange the LD for LI.
---
I mean, I understand what you're trying to say, but there's a difference between releasing 17 raid wings or none at all.
---
They tried PvP already. I would say that failed pretty miserably.
---
My dad's friend is a game developer too and he said no it isn't.
---
They said it because it's possible. Devs know how much they can do but management also knows that they can't put too much content into this game. Because it would be even worse. Because players would see core gw2 design problems. Right now they don't see it.
---
Both are optimal in zerg fights, but FB is generally more needed and provides more utility.
---
No one expect a raid wing one every 3 months , but at least having one guaranteed once a year would be nice , also with fractals , they can keep the cap , just replace fractals that get repeated with new ones so we have 25 different fractals every level , delete jade maw, and add cm's and the problem you introduced is gone , with dungeons they need to balance them, add ascended stuff to buy with the currency and here ya go you got a valid end game content. 
---
I see your point , but just because they don't want to add too much content doesn't  mean they cant work on improving old content   .
---
I literally tried to make something decent-looking out of this face preset and it turned into Wilfred.
---
It's strange how this community is so strongly opposes different ideas. I don't get you people.
---
but then you just had this spider lady that gets sacrificed to the tree for no reason at the end of the other 2 paths
---
What's it for? Hiding strats/ teams setup until they're potentially irrelevant to try to keep the record?
---
So why would opinion of playerbase who did that content 2/4 years ago matter if you havent even scratched the lv 80 content?
---
Exactly. These elitists just dont want any competition.
---
&gt; What do you guys do with your time?
---
Log in, get chest, log out. Play more engaging games. Repeat for 3-4 months till anet adds 1 hour of story. Do story. Repeat.
---
Only if they can muster up the boons to allow the DPS to reach 34k DPS I reckon.
---
It's not an ad, it's an artist posting a piece with correct credits. Awesome piece by the way!
---
my left ear is moist
---
Because you seem to be missing it: There is nothing called a "Thumbs Down" on Reddit. There is on other sites, like perhaps Youtube. Thus, you must be lost.
---
AHHH I MISSED YOU GUYS WB
---
Same here, also a PoF Traders Cache would be nice too, maybe a "bash the dragon" pinata, "lucky Mailbox" that uses luck as a key for a fine envelope. theres so much more id like to get from home instance
---
a mmorpg that is mainly focused on SINGLE PLAYER story mode...
---
all the "hardcore" or "competitive modes" neglected for over 2 years...
---
tons of customers completely ignored....
---
full focus of EANET on cash grabs in the gem store, monetizing even broken products which brought more bugs and errors than solutions...
---
the last man power they got focused on open world maps filled with mindless weak mobs to farm so you can earn gold so you can buy skins...
---
thats what the game has become
---
;)
---
You know exactly what I mean dude. Down votes, thumbs down. It's all the same shit. Are you THAT petty that you really feel the need to argue about this? Get a hobby my man.
---
I used it for a while and I thought i made it look decent but like a lot of the new faces, the eyes don't line up with most helmet skins and that triggered me.

---
Hi, I'm looking to buy some gems in the near future (deciding on the amount when I see whats on sale) and I'm definitely looking to buy 2 living world seasons. Now, my question is which ones are more useful from the non-story perspective. I've read that 3 and 4 but would like to get some sort of confirmation.
---
Concur. If you can afford it, by any means possible, griffon is so worth it.
---
What's wrong with withholding strategies from the competition? Seems fairly logical to not want to give your competition all of your strategies immediately, especially not when going for a record. That's just common sense and *part of the competition.*
---
Unless I'm missing something here, but it sounds like you think people are inherently entitled to know everything these kind of players know and that they have an inherent obligation to hand out their strategies.
---
Idk again, maybe I'm missing the significance of something here, but it seems so odd to me to get so pissed off by this. Coming up with strategies of your own is part of competing with "the best of the best" after all. The top end WoW guilds have been doing the same thing for years as well and only up until recently have the top end guilds started streaming their progress. 
---
Which they didn't even do to share their strategies (since they still mute their mic) but because livestreaming their progress earns them money.
---
1st place in Brisban race, 3 medaillons, none for waiting for the event timer to run out
---
2nd place in Gendarren race, 2 medaillons, another 3 (in a chest) for waiting for the event timer to run out
---
Some give event rewards, others don't. Not in any way connected to being 1st/2nd/3rd to reach the finish line.
---
exactly. Average player don't understand it but Im 100% sure Anet stopped to produce more dungs, fractals and raids because of it and they will never release it fast enough. They just can't. Game is not designed this way.
---
One of the many problems I see is that people dedicate themselves to a specific content and don't invest time into others game types.
---
I would love to see more incentive into trying them.
---
What I'd also want to see is more rewards and more hard content. But given the small percentage of players that do raids and CM fractals I can understand why they don't invest more into this. One thing I've thought about would be DLC, kind of a mini expansion of specific contents, could be a raid dlc that would give us access to some raids, could be a open world dlc (this would be a great way to deliver side stories and even prequel style content where you'd play a different character), could be really anything, just see it as "a mini expansion that for whoever is into X type of content".
---
There are multiple things wrong right now, and multiple ways of fixing it.
---
[Roly-poly holosmith](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/7n36cw/open_world_pve_builds_december_2017/drz4xwb/) was fun. You just dodge your way through the crowd of mobs until they al die.  Idk if this build still works after all the patches.
---
whoooosh
---
Returning player here. Left shortly after PoF. Lots to look forward to between LW4, raids, fractals, WvW, gearing my characters and playing the TP for profit.
---
Has “toon” been a thing for long? I’ve played GW for over a decade and I hadn’t heard it until the other week.

---
That skyscale looks even more like an exotic flower here :3
---
Agree, That feeling of danger on the streets was amazing. I loved the peace of shing jea, the chaos of kaineng, the strength of shiro as a boss. Crazy immersion.
---
When you say weak, what do you feel you lack the most? I can give you much more targeted advice if you can let me know.
---
The easiest way to revitalize the game is to give a new way to play it...aka...you guessed it...ELITE SPECS!!!!!!!!!!@!@!@!11@!@12121#1321!#11!
---
That's extremely weird, as long as i don't put player limit on high/highest performance is pretty good everywhere for me on a 3700x + RX570 (1080p60hz), other games are a different story since most of them require more GPU than CPU.
---
What CPU, GPU, resolution and what's the % GPU use you get? I got a pretty basic GPU (RX570) and it barely utilizes 50% of it at 1080p60hz.
---
And you'll get exactly the same if you suggest you'd like to see more western influence in something like the FFXIV sub (which it actually has in spades if you can ignore all of the men playing cat girls with Japanese names, which isn't even close to lore appropriate if you wanna go full nerd about it lol). Different strokes for different folks.
---
Welcome to reddit =)
---
The state of the game is stagnant.  We are moving foward in only one area of the game, story.  The pace of which is very very slow.  We got maybe a few hours of content out of the last episode.  While the elements of that story were well done, there was not much to be had.
---
There are probably many ideas to be had.  They just need to move forward on something, anything, that is end game. Right now there are two types of players.  Ones that expect nothing but disappointment from this developer and those that are still enjoying parts of the game that are still new to them.
---
Bottom line, they need to get players excited for the game again.  Just do something.  We have another episode coming.  What should we look forward to?  More of the same is not going to get this game moving again.  If this is all Anet could do, people's attitudes are not going to change.
---
Pretty good!
---
Now wait two weeks to enjoy it again.
---
Metabattle gets a bad wrap but most of the time it has up to date builds. Be wary of the "Meta" category, because it isn't kept up to date as frequently as more specialized sites. If you use metabattle look for the highest rated builds for the character you want to play, not just the ones specifically in the meta category.
---
Most people on Reddit don't act like this, might be news to you. I guess you're just that special "toxic minority" that ruins this community.
---
The season 2 maps are Silverwastes and Dry Top, which everyone has access to now without purchasing the season.  S3 and S4 have exclusive maps that require that you buy the seasons.  So just based on that, I'd go with 3 and 4.
---
To add onto the above, the future is looking very bright for competitive balance. I will note that we are currently still in the infinite block things you're talking about which also drives me a little crazy. You learn to deal with it if you try, though.
---
They've said in the future they are planning a very large re-balance of the entire meta. Basically they want to lower everything across the board. Less damage, less heals, less boons, less conditions, less defensive uptime. It's what many PvPers have been asking for for a long time. Obviously that big of a pass is going to take a while so we're not sure when it will drop.
---
yikes.
---
While the aesthetic can be cool, and I'd generally say I enjoy Japanese-style stuff, it's a very commonly used aesthetic in MMOs, due to how many modern MMOs are made in Asian countries. As an FFXIV player, we just this year finished 2 years of Stormblood, which was a fire hose of Asian-themed stuff on multiple vectors, and it's honestly refreshing to be in GW2 and not be bombarded with that.
---
That's the reason I've never wanted the game to go to Cantha. It's extremely well-trod territory, MMO fashion-wise. I liked that the game went to Elona because it offered styles fresher and less commonly seen in games.
---
I think instanced PvE is considered a "finished product" so there isn't really anything we can do to "fix" their mentality.  I think that the Icebrood Saga is an appetizer themed living story season with a more consistent 2-3 month update cadence that allows them to churn out content while simultaneously continuing the development of a 3rd expansion or a new game.
---
Overall, the game is in okay state for everyone but hardcore instanced PvE and competitive players.  The majority of the GW2 player-base *are* casual, story-driven and achievement focused players that are happy to cough up $$$ for the gem-store or buy black lion keys.  They're happy to enjoy the attractions at the GW2 theme park ~~(at everyone else's expense)~~  although they certainly won't come out and say that.  They'll say that, "it sucks, but nothing I can do about" while filling their coffers w/ gems.
---
I'm looking forward to playing Path of Exile come 12/13 and the new Metamorph League.  I'm not really expecting much from Wintersday because the holiday themed stuff hasn't ever been particularly attractive to me.  I might do the JP once or twice for the sheer thrill &amp; challenge of it, but doing the carols and bells?  Not so much.  I'll judge them for what they ship and leave it at that; plenty satisfied to login for occasional fractals or weekly raids.
---
You are assuming two things:
---
* How many people actually play raids.. 
---
* How fast making content actually is. 
---
Just waiting for voice actors alone slows things down a lot.
---
“Toon” has been a thing since the EverQuest days... nearly 2 decades at this point.
---
It would be great if each season got an 'exchange' vendor that trades the currencies of that season for the currencies of others.  
---
And if they eventually decide to give them a cap, it should be weekly rather than daily. Like the festival weekly vendors.
---
thanks alot for this
---
Yes, I can see now that having too much content is bad for the game.
---
Thank you.
---
You enlightened me.
---
What's to fix?
---
I have no idea how I missed that lol. We used to just call our characters “Chars”.
---
The problem is the raid concept is so iconic. When guild wars 2 first released people were legitamately upset there wasn't any large group content outside of merging world bosses. Raids allow us to engage lore-based concepts that we otherwise can't fight outside of Living World Dues Ex Machina. Dhuum, for example, is literally a fallen God. How can you *not* be excited about killing a God for reals? Strike Missions are a way to reset the reward list, but right now they are a bit too easy and not rewarding enough, failing on both accounts. They are also locked into being current-story relevant, so we aren't going to get a Strike Mission to take down the evil pale tree thing or fight the last Stone Summit construct or deal with a Sea Dragon minion besieging Lion's Arch. Everything in the foreseeable future is going to be "take down this ice/bone golem"
---
Some things I think I've figured out over the years:
---
- default tab targeting I think is going to choose a target near the center of your screen (this makes more sense if you've ever used Action Camera).
---
- default setting picks the highest ranking (PVE) mob, so if a champ, many vets, and many normals are clustered you should get the champ to come up on the first tab. Even if it's not in the center of the screen.
---
- you can switch to nearest target first in settings
---
I would stick with default setting, now that you should able to better predict which it's going to pick.
---
Very awesome!
---
**None** of public groups (8-10 players usually) I've joined have managed to kill buffed Boneskinner (most groups barely get past 70%, even with healers) and you duoed it like nothing.
---
Well both PvP and WvW do have big updates in works, but big updates take big time...
---
If Anet was going for expansions instead of living world, the pve would feel same. 2 years of nothing then big single drop...
---
Staff Daredevil.  I bounce here, I bounce there, I dps without needing a rotation, so I get to look around while fighting, I can do something like 1k breakbar by myself.
---
I thought that she was wearin glasses for a sec
---
Out of curiosity, and going really off topic now.   I read this and looked up downvoted and thumbsdowned, and they apparently are used interchangeably and accepted as thus.   I can see how it can be seen as uncommon usage in certain situations.  This content was more fascinating than guild wars 2 is to me at this moment.   Yay, back to topic
---
That is actually why they have gone back to using the same map for multiple releases. Next episode should be expanding Bjora Marches instead of being on a completely new map.
---
I dodge small AoE rings, but usually end up inside another small AoE ring (this means players do stack), so dodging does not really help. I talked before about that huge AoE ring what takes entire instance. It can't be dodged and it kills everyone.
---
Idk if we have designated torches, stacking, planning, strat, composition, healers, buffers, enough DPS, enough players or anything. How do I know it if groups are **public** groups, a non-talking wild players taken randomly from open world with their random non-meta builds, gear and rotations. There is no squad either, just random amount (usually 8-10) of wild players doing what they can do best (mostly autoattack). Those players, what were healers, they stated at beginning that they are healers. No food on anyone. I don't eat food either at strike missions.
---
Keeping that in mind, I wonder how similar wild public groups managed to kill *all other strike bosses* so easily, but this one, it never get past 70%. It is too difficult as a strike mission now. I really like all other strike bosses, because public players can use *whatever build they want* (that's the nature of public wild players) and still manage to kill them.
---
I faintly remember a spot in Miunt Maelstrom too.
---
Honestly, that might be kind of tough depending on the content. It is meant for cleave and for fighting a lot of low-level mobs. If you are trying to do only champs it will be a lot less effective. You could still fall back on the normal power gs chrono rotation for extra dps though. The build doesn't offer a huge amount of survivability or single-target dps so keep that in mind. That's not to say it isn't fun or cool laser beaming everything around you. You just might have an easier time with the other builds I mentioned.
---
Try reading it again. Just try.
---
you get a 10/10 pepega, hold this L
---
They are not free, cause you need to buy an expansion.
---
Try some self reflection here dude. If you had said "I like to play a full bunker fb to run around open world" then I wouldn't have said anything. But here is a new player looking for information, and you are just flat out feeding him misinformation and presenting it as objective. Saying that guardians are a joke is just flat out wrong.
---
No other post here is attracting a negative response, and that's because no other post is doing a disservice to the thread creator. Only yours is.
---
If you're in need of karma, there are the season 4 permanent map buffs you can buy for a couple gold plus map currency (or volatile magic?) and cause kills to permanently drop karma for you.
---
Once you do that, there are plenty of kill-heavy events that will grant you plenty of karma and it's easy to maintain over a million after a few days.
---
Those prices are because nothing matters in this game.
---
There is no materials or anything that are based on some kind of skill lvl. You just walk to boss/tree/ore and AA/click F. Thats all there is.
---
Great example of good material design is runescape where you have to acquire levels before you can get materials.
---
What underlying issue are you talking about?
---
there are like 1230000 thread on the same argument , recent account, you know what they say ...
---
so boring
---
I just wanted to know the opinion of the more experienced community, but I took several downvoted without reason
---
Do you think eternal ice will have more uses later on, or if it is just with the one map? Kinda wondering if i should hold onto it or exchange it for something more useful.
---
I don't think raiders would consider 17 wings "too much content".
---
The issue of course is they would have to put out equivalent amounts of non raid stuff.
---
I do agree that's it's probably not gonna change. 
---
This is why I log in, do all the chapter content and cheevos, do whatever weekly guild stuff is happening,  but otherwise play other games in the content gaps. 
---
Making great progress on my steam backlog.
---
japanese style gear =/ weeb shit alright?
---
People were crying over the fact they had to farm 250 of each currency so anet put this feature in which makes it easier, and now some people are complaining about it... They can't win can they
---
I play Guild Wars 2 because I love playing Guild Wars 2. I don't play any other games anymore. I've been playing GW2 7 years every single day. There is no "state of the game" and "maintenance mode" in my mind. I am also excited about the future. Right now I am waiting for Wintersday and next story chapter after.
---
Patience goes long way...
---
I suspect most of the DEVS are interviewing/submitting resumes ELSEWHERE....
---
There will be a Tier 3 of the Boreal weapons. Quite possible that they require more of your Eternal Ice. And after Skyscale and Vision it's definitely on the table that eternal Ice will be important later.
---
Says 1%
---
Dx9 and single thread only makes horrible optimization for an mmo 2019.
---
Back then (when the game was released) Intel thought we would reach 10,000 Ghz single thread. And while it would solve the issue, i didn't become a reality on consumer  aircooled devices.
---
Thats just reddit
---
ANet actually creates a lot of new zones and interesting instances for the game, but chooses to make them playable only once and then abandons them. So much content could be tweaked slightly by making it replayable and with challenge modes. And so many cool story instance locations could be re-used as Raids, Fractals, or Strikes.
---
Great! You are going to have a blast! There is so much awesome content in this game, even I haven't seen it all yet (been playing 7 years).
---
Well, it all depends on what they enjoy doing and how much time they want to invest.
---
Umm, did you contact support?
---
&gt;what is
---
&gt;how do you fix
---
another post on impending doom.
---
anyway
---
game is good as it is. 
---
they are adding many things and at the end of the "saga" we'll have enough content to fill what it could have been an expansion. 
---
but keep on complaining please
---
That looks amazing, great artwork!
---
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuh whut?
---
&gt; Gliders you get for completing the first story and mastery in HoT. More glider skins are available in the gemstore.
---
Gotcha. Just bought HoT/PoF so guess I will get there soon.
---
Thanks!
---
eek!
---
wow
---
&gt; Greatsword Mirage: This is super unique as it is all about your dodge skill in greatsword. Every time you get a kill it recharges your dodges so you can dodge nonstop while cleaving everything around you. Its a frikin laser lightshow! Super fun in open world with lots of mobs. 
---
This is similar to my "I'm bored of trying to play properly" build, only I use all the mirage skills I can that drop mirage mirrors. Basically, you spam illusions, run about randomly doing anything you can that drops a mirage mirror and then run about between the mirage mirrors turning everything into a giant combat disco.
---
I'll show you simple example. Imagine doing ulduar raid till today in wow. This is what's happening in gw2. People here are still doing wing 1. It's still fully playable content with same rewards as in 2015. That's why they'll never add enough raid wings for raids here. Never.
---
There are players who have been requesting capes since 2012 too. Just sayin'.
---
&gt; Is the game microtransactions heavy? Do I need to pay for anything other than Living Story, skins and QoL items like endless gathering tools?
---
No. I'd say Living Story are the only things that are must-haves. 
---
&gt; Do I need to buy the expansion/s before finishing the main game? Will I miss anything important without them?
---
No, not really. There's some benefit to running the first story bit in Path of Fire to get a mount, but otherwise nah. 
---
&gt; Is grinding out dungeon gear still as tiresome as it was in the past? Are some of the dungeons (Ruined City of Arah... aaargh, the pain) and fractals still as hard as they were?
---
Difficulty hasn't really changed, but gear has become easier to come by a bit and the elite specs that come with the enhancements have a bit of power creep. 
---
&gt; Lazy person, doesn't plan on spending hours every day playing the game - which will I be better off with, crafting or only gathering mats and selling them for profit?
---
Neither are particularly profitable, to be honest. Gathering can get you a bit, but it's not phenomenal and not great money for your time. You'd be better off just doing the dailies. Fractals are a pretty good way of getting some money fast.
---
Fb is more wanted for healing but scrapper does well too.
---
Scrapper and holo can also do amazingly well in small groups.
---
I'm told you can be surprisingly effective with heal renegade traits and diviner gear, but I don't know if that applies to pugs.
---
You fail until you're comfortable with failing.  Then, hopefully, you get a clear/kill with tips/tricks and comfort-zone built upon those failures.  Failing is the easy part.  Learning and staying relaxed is the hard part when you're new.
---
Sure. Right after you change that big diaper you just shit in.
---
I've purchased and used physical HoT keys in the last year without issue.
---
Edit: as for whether you'd get the reward, I would assume you would but can't confirm.
---
&gt;See mounts
---
The WvW mount was pushed out in anticipation of being able to sell Mount Skins for Gems.  Of course no testing was done, because it's just a simple jumble of sprites to make money off of.  No way the marketing team's idea would would go wrong, right?  /s
---
Exactly this, remember when back in 2012 we used a third party website for dungeons and whispers, was a real pain.
---
It's better that the game dies than it cater to people like you.
---
Indeed if you only have time for one, I would recommend scrapper over firebrand.
---
A right build scrapper never die, and, is both tanky and annoying. 2 projectile block, dmg share, protection buff, convert condi and 20s mobi invi is super hard to deal with. 
---
Holo is a full aoe melter elite if you get bored playing support. 
---
Even in pve, a good scrapper can solo any champ boss.
---
That's the most important part. But there are plenty of awesome resources out there to look through like [Snowcrows](https://Snowcrows.com)  that can give an idea of  what people are building for and a couple of links to training discords.
---
As for the other questions.  Since the megaserver thing there hasn't really been dedicated RP servers, but most open RP is sorta centered around Divinity's Reach iirc
---
WvW is a little tough because a lot of the popular ones are obviously full, I think Ferguson's Crossing does pretty well these days and isn't full.
---
This, is really something that the game missing to be complete.
---
Yes, but not everytime the LFG is usefull when guilds organize an event without it, also you need to be lucky when you log-in to catch the event, or if you are late you get pushed out from the map because is full.
---
it literally says ffxiv in the link
---
If I put a energy sigil in a a one handed weapon like a scepter, that is used in both swap weapon sets, will this trigger the energy sigil every time I switch weapons?
---
&gt;Dungeons and Fractals are not that hard
---
That why dungeons have been ignored since launch and there won't be any new Fractals?
---
The emphasis on one-time story missions is a spectacular failure. MMOs need replayable content with worthwhile rewards. Unfortunately, aside from legendary weapons, all the good cosmetic rewards (which is what I mainly play MMOs to obtain) are store bought. So there's no point in playing this game at all unless you want to grind gold to buy store items. If I wanted to work incredibly hard to buy stuff that others can just shell out excess cash for, I'll log off and remember what my life is like.
---
Combat is still mostly fun but stale with so much time now without any new elite specs.
---
I would
---
* Scrap the entire Living Story concept.
---
* Focus on creating or repurposing existing maps with worthwhile unlockable rewards. We don't need story missions, just good events and fun, challenging enemies to fight.
---
* Release an expansion with new elite specs OR release a new elite with each patch.
---
These are fixed in-game events, as other people said, i was asking for a calendar where guilds organize the coming events, for the same day or for the coming days, so you wont miss it.
---
As example is the Triple Trouble event, there is a guild that do it but they have a personal schedule, and not everyday at the same hour they do it. If they can publicize the event in a public calendar under the LFG window you can only log-in at this specific time to finally do it with people who know what to do and not fail or be pushed out from the map because is full if you arrive too late.
---
Well, it is basically a 20 year old game engine (with some tweaks for GW2) - not much to expect here in terms optimizations.
---
Yes, of course that is true, but the implication was buying from players, asking if it was better to “make gold and buy the gear”, which you cannot do.
---
All you need is a storm and psylocke (or doom/vergil) and you'll be ready to go!
---
I'm about to reach that part on my journey to Skyscale but I haven't been to the newest map yet. Is it faster to farm currency there than on LW4 maps? Os it merely an alternative?
---
Hope they can consider it, is easy to code, is just a public calendar board that can be added to the LFG window.
---
It is great but they should also include chilis. Feels lame playing grothmar when you get this currency only used in few skins and niche cooking.
---
If that is what they were trying to fix then why didn't they address the collection directly? Such as changing the collection? 
---
Alternatively if the problem is not specific to the collection but applies to the currency items themselves then why isn't the original sources being addressed?
---
Why is this a bad solution? Well lets assume someone starts playing the game and gets to that collection. Now describe all the ways that someone is supposed to discover that the solution to alleviating their frustration is to ignore it and move on to the next season.
---
Yeah, one of the best things about this map imo.
---
Because of this i completed the Kourna Ascended Backpack very quickly (it requires 500 inscribed shards), just doing hearts and Bjora, took me only a few days lol.
---
Same for Elegy Armor in Jahai, got the entire tier 1 set and the tier 2 heavy/medium set in one week only, and now i'm getting the light set for the achiev and the free ascended armor.
---
Next gonna be Dragonfall armor and Dragonsblood weapons, still have those Istan weapons, but it's still a huge grind even with Bjora help.
---
Pretty sure ANet put this in *because* of the Skyscale collection. They want people playing the new map, this is a great way to get people there and away from older content while still giving a way to complete the huge grind of that collection.
---
Nope, no AR necessary. You don't strictly even need Ascended Gear, though it will make them easier.
---
Arguably the two Fractals Challenge Modes are more difficult than most raids, even.
---
For group content difficulty:
---
Grothmar Strike &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; [...] &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Dungeons &lt; Two of the Bjora Strikes (Kodan and Fraenir) &lt; Early Fractals &lt; Bjora Strike (Boneskinner) &lt; Late Fractals &lt; Raids &lt; Fractals CM
---
(Bjora Strike has 1 available at a time, rotates weekly, will be Kodan in 2 hours)
---
Work your way up until you feel comfortable. Join a raid discord. I don't have links offhand but someone else should or just search this sub.
---
Great question! As a noob to GW2, I was wondering the same. Going to try what's been suggested thus far.
---
It really is fantastic....
---
 Until someone one shots southvine! 🤣
