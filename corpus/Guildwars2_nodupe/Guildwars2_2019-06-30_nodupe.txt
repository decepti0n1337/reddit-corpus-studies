The reason why I am pointing out that it is pathetic is because there is so insanely marginal of a percentage of the population in the game nowadays that has any interest in playing well that it's jarring to me. Like yeah I know this game advertises itself to be casual friendly but the scope with which the community for people that hold interest in minmaxing has deteriorated over the years is enormous. I mean no disrespect to you either but honestly people *should* care about learning how to do something on a class in the game that they play when it's done really well. Maybe it would make more sense for people who don't play thief to have any interest, but anyone who does or plans to at some point should definitely be having a watch to see what their class is capable of doing.

Yes, over 100 years ago. But the city had grown and used it's origins as a source for the unique architecture it had, even though it obviously wasn't just made entirely out of debris by the time we see it in GW2. [This is very obviously not created from a collection of sea-debris, but it very much displays a lot of the character and history of the city.](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/v0MzZyZ-ty8/maxresdefault.jpg)
---
Its a hot bag of mixed opinions for me. On one hand, map design, map objectives and map rewards, generally speaking, improved. However this came at a cost, a big one. Around 60% or so increased release time between eps (almost 2 years to release 6 eps vs 1 year for LS3 to release the same amount of eps). 
---

---
Story instances became easier which is not good, takes away the risk and thrill (or whatever they had left) but despite that bosses and instances were better overall. Which is weird.
---
PoF took too long to fix. Why did it took 2 years to fix it? When the solution was proposed by the community 2 weeks after launch. 
---
Other areas of the game like pvp wvw and instanced pve more less saw the same treatment as before. Balance was worse, specially in WvW, but pve balance is better than ever. 
---
As for the future, some leaks said Season 5 is a scrapped xpac :) just rumors. I would expect at least another xpac. Maybe Season 5 will bring elite specs but I don't think it will. I think those will be saved for the 3rd xpac and in Season 5 we're going to explore a new region and get more mounts and shit.
---
The problem is when there are a lot of mobs all over the place, like some Tangled Depths events (which I just started doing today lol). Though that may be a case where I need to learn how to play better...
---
did you just level it, or did you also put the mastery points into it?
---
Back when Kralk first started GW2 and didn't have any decent skins or enough dye channels for Fashion Wars.
---
Seems a bit much for trespassing
---
1k a year nice one :D

I do not know what this message is even saying... has my post been deleted?
---
Did you make sure you had enough height before hitting the updraft. It may not look like it but you can't use the updraft if you're too close to the bottom of it in midair.
---
It used to be how guilds earned influence but now rep policy is just a pointless relic alot of guilds hang on to. Influence was replaced by favour.
---
Just because people are interested in vapid posts doesn’t mean they should downvote stuff just because it isn’t what they like.  Isn’t the upvote/downvote system supposed to be based off of contribution to the community in general?
---
I had a pause from this game because of my job. Now i restarted playing and as a wvw player: holy shit this is great!
---
What in the world abomination is this
---
You should just have to fly into it, though i've noticed sometimes even if it looks like you're hitting the very bottom of the visual updraft gust thing it still won't carry you up.  Try flying at it from up higher so you hit more towards the middle and it should work.
---
I like all of the new LA except for the main area. The old one was really claustrophobic but the new one is boring.
---
~24 - for different builds and/or fashionwars. I have like 7 mesmers 😂
---
Hi Emi! Just wanted to see if you will be doing this again next Saturday? Looking forward to the train if you are!
---
THATS AWESOME!!
---
We should fill the official English forum with French, German and Spanish posts and comments, since the internet links us all together.
---
homf
---
Have you tried restarting the game? (has anyone watched THE IT CROWD?)  I don't have anything else since your screen shot shows you have the mastery.
---
Holosmith is definitely Asuran, no?
---
When I saw the title I thought it gonna be about ecto gamble :D not the case, but wasn't disappointed
---
I still miss that fella in old LA. He should come back as a ghost or something.
---
Thank you 😊
---
Hahah, a little different 🙃
---
Nah, I just tried another updraft.. guess the one I did was too high up..
---
The one next to the big fallen tree trunk.
---
Yeah. It's an amusement park now.
---
Originally, some guy said that dungeons are harder than raids. I’m saying that speed clearing raids and speed clearing dungeons are similar difficulties, while pugging raids is much much harder than pugging dungeons.
---
I also had 9 then I took 2 more characters for Scourge/Reaper and Chrono/Mirage combo and thinking of getting another guardian so I have a Firebrand/Dragonhunter combo but that doesnt feel needed yet
---
Some guilds require 100% rep. I don't join those, I don't want to slap a name on my character when I have no idea who they are as people or anything. Also, since you can join more than one guild, you might have one with your close friends and be in a few others for raiding or map meta purposes. 
---
Like, I have one with my friends, there's maybe ten of us. There's one I'm in for open world shenigans, and that's around 200? I would prefer to rep my friend's guild rather than the bigger, simply because we're friends, even if he never does any active recruiting.
---
He's so talented. If you told me he was also the voice of Male Skritt, I'd believe it.
---
Try boon herald
---
That one is a little weird. There should be an Orrian chest you can interact with, which will spawn [this event](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Kill_the_Risen_wizard_patrolling_the_Vizier%27s_Tower) that will spawn a Grand chest upon completion. There's also a cooldown on the Orrian chest, wiki says around 10 - 30 minutes.
---
I'm so happy they put in a race for the event, I hope they keep it around honestly. Put some in the other cities (LA and DR comes to mind). Hopefully we get more griffin adventures too! I just honestly love the mounts, and races are an excellent way to play with them :D 
---
(how do I look into a racing guild??)
---
TIL: Jesse Mccree is male norn.
---
Well done!
---
Did he get something better than moot loot?
---
ohh, ok. So the important stat is just condition. The power won't do anything on my dps.
---
I wonder if the LA defense will be as useful as Kormir in a room full of mouse traps this time too
---
It adds up, so power on condi gear is not wasted or anything.
---
Drew is a pretty great looking guardian ;)
---
And Ashe is female sylvari!
---
Wow, thanks for this. It is clear now what will I am for. How about the Precision on condition? Or the precision is for the power in viper's?
---
He is also the voice of Arkk.
---
Happy Birthday Matt &lt;3
---
My life will be incomplete until I do this
---
yeah the start button for time trials is a bit wonky. I do the thing where i start a few feet back from it...hit my boost and as i pass the flag, i trigger it to start it so i have a little extra speed out of the gate.
---
1. Work $8 an hour for 3 hours
---
2. Buy gems for $25
---
3. Convert to ~500g
---
3. Buy bench from tp
---
4. Look like a really good raider
---
Solid 1 unless you actually work for it. If you do it via dhuum and wing 5-7 clears, it’s like, an 8 imo. It’s more tedious and timegated than it is really difficult.
---
This made me think.. What is the in game lore rationale behind Choya piñata? Is that mesmer magic or embiggenig tonic or asura tech??
---
You really nailed those U turns.
---
hug the edge of the mountain on that turn and you will line directly up with the edge of the checkpoint. you don't have to actually go through the checkpoints as long as you are close enough they will trigger
---
I'm also a member of Tyria Drift \[DRFT\]. If you want in, shoot me your account name. We are in the process of making TacO paths for custom open world tracks.

Leggings appear to be from the Strider's armor Set.
---
Like you said, World completion. I craft and sell legendaries regularly. 19 level 80s in total, not all have 100% WC though.
---
He’s one of those premier voice actors. He’s voiced a whooooooole host of stuff.
---
Holy shit I didn’t realize that. Jennifer Hale voices ashe too!?
---
Thank you for this info. It is really hard to search info like this in this forum due to some are really old and I don't know if they are still up-to-date. TY
---
Just a general reply to everyone replying to this thread. 
---
Thanks for the input. Kind of what I expected, with a few exceptions. Giving me some ideas for possibly getting a few other accounts or banging out a few world completions to sell the gifts since that can be decently lucrative. Nice to see so much activity though on this! Seems everyone has solid reasons for having lots of max level characters.
---
Good catch!  The tooltip still says 20, but when eaten it does give 30.
---
now that  chrono is no longer meta from what I've heard, what is an ideal/close to meta raid and fractal comp? druid,  fb, renegade, 2 dps?
---
Still no mistlock huh?
---
15 currently. Working up to one for each elite spec
---
No, it's up now for 1000 gems. Don't think I'll get it though. Would rather spend gems/money on something I'll actually use more of like storage expansions. Already have Lily of Elon pass so no need for another sanctuary pass really...
---
More characters = more birthday gifts.
---
Just noticed!! :) got mine.
---
Met him and Nolan north(human male and Joko!) at Boston comic con a few years ago some of the coolest guys.
---
so wait, my Norn has been DM'ing me all this time?
---
Well the candy corn node costs 5 Candy Corn cobs, so 5 Jorbreakers seem like a reasonable cost for a home Pinata node.
---
I do them because they’re fun! But I know they give pretty good loot, trade contracts, and elegy mosaics to buy PoF gear.
---
24
---
I play on low graphics without hook too.
---
Wonder what I'm missing out on
---
Wow, you're not glowing or anything. Can see the 7yr difference
---
in fractals, both druid and chrono have been replaced by fb/renegade
---
Other than that, the comp hasn't really changed significantly, but you can still check it out for yourself using discretize and snowcrows
---
Doubt it. He has no kids.
---
Damn if my pc didn’t literally just die today.
---
Good man! We need more people like you!
---
And Mad King Thorn!
---
&gt; pugging raids is much much harder than pugging dungeons
---
On an individual basis it's iffy but I would say it depends what you are doing in said raid. There are only a couple of important roles for any given encounter and outside of that everyone else is kind of just filler. But in terms of success rate per attempts then yeah absolutely there's no question about it, raids will have a much lower chance of success for pugging than dungeons.
---
&gt; I’m saying that speed clearing raids and speed clearing dungeons are similar difficulties
---
Nah not even remotely close lol.
---
I actually like EoTM as a map and not as an overflow...
---
Watch as we try to figure out where to place this massive guild hall decoration, Dragon Hologram Generator. xD**SHOW MORE**
---
Greatness. He is becoming greatness.
---
I guide others to treasures I cannot possess
---
Which chest is that? Have only started yesterday with the festival.
---
For ease of use Thief is mostly not in that group. I would highly recommend Necromancer Minion Master for ease of use. Not a lot of story differences aside from 1-30 which is based on your selections at start. Race, go for any you prefer.
---
The most difficult I've found was to gauge the distance between each updraft when doing puzzles..
---
wtf xd
---
You’d only need to do that for WvW. But I’m also in SoS, there’s a fair few there. I’m in Horde of Tyria [HoT] amd I know of a few other guilds as well. If you want an invite to HoT I can give you an invite, DM if interested. 
---
You could also ask in the SoS discord, which I can link you to, if you want.
---
Alternatively, you could ask this question in r/guildrecruitment as well.
---
As a Necromancer, what skills/weapons combination is ideal for PvE?
---
And how does Necromancer actually work, in addition, is ranger a good choice as well? 
---
~~Since I'm opting to play two character so I might as well as look for two classes that's ideal so that I can switch it around when I get bored.~~
---
I see, thanks! 
---
I take it that there isn't any major differences if you play as one gender over the other? Like, the way the characters treat you?
---
I'm looking to upgrade my current system to run GW2 smoothly. Without spending a fortune, what's a reasonable budget I should be looking at to build a pc for this game? Also, would just a gaming laptop suffice?
---
[Hey check it out, a repost](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a127hn/aurenes_son/)
---
when did they fix Lupis auto attack not hitting at close range in phase 2&amp;3?
---
 10,000 Dragon coffers opened. All I want is Gift of Aurene for Scion weapon skins, but RNG God granted me Crystal infusion on \~3000th coffer instead. The rest is just junk items... :(
---
Fixed by leaving squad and opening fresh instance. Instance is rip
---
The 3rd part of the staff auto attack chain reflects missiles. Watch closely, he holds the 3rd swing for when Lupi uses that attack. Very impressive.
---
I for example have 4 Warriors. Warrior is my main class and I just like to change it up a little. I mostly play the Make Charr and Female Human, but the Male Asura or Female Norn sometimes come out to PvP.
---
In General many of my characters are just there to store stuff and because I can't decide between 2 races for a class.
---
So 18 or do you lack an entire class?
---
You get after doing the 3 dailies for 5 days and it's repeatable afaik.
---
Guilds matter in wvw only. There is no practical reason for even being in a guild. There are reduced wp costs etc. but in the end, It's a group of buddies hanging out. If you don't feel the buddy vibe.. keep searching
---
I play on a $900 asus gaming laptop and have no issues. 35-40 fps though (doesn't bother me).
---
nice! always like this more then the new condi food
---
you get one after openeing 1k dragon coffers in dragonfall
---
Generally, if you can consume the achievement item, you won't need it again.
---
yes and no price will probably be the lowest in the 2nd week then slowly rise but not too as fast since supply will still be huge and there are other condi food out there
---
Definitely not no :D
---
&gt; no one does doppelganger, maws of torment or vabbi meta now
---
What? I don't know if you've been under a rock but once they got buffed we do them daily in the rotation.
---
do you plan on using reaper at some time or keep a core build?
---
 
---
since reaper is much better for openworld and fractals
---
I get the Scion shield from 10k Dragon coffer already, Now i want the Sword instead :(
---
Although I get 10k gold from Crystal infusion, I still want Gift of Aurene so badly :((((((((((( RNG God is not with me :(
---
Can you give us a list of everything you got?
---
Not for the most part, however a certain hostile faction of the norn (known as the Sons of Svanir) is incredibly sexist, and their dialogue in the open world will change to be dismissive and discriminatory if you have a female playable character.
---
not that many ppl do them even after the buff   
---
especially maws of torment cuz it can get bugged and vabbi even after the nerf not that many ppl do it like chak gerent it's just 15-20 ppl in lfg or even less
---
I do this  
---
AB -&gt; Piniata -&gt; TD -&gt; AB -&gt; Maw -&gt; Path to ascension + Doppelgänger -&gt; Forged with fire  
---
Easy 7 gemstones
---
haha, 👍 nice
---
if you  really want to keep core necro and range i would try to focus on a axe and shroud build with focus on power.
---
openworld and fractal in general favors burst dmg much much more then anything else (ignoring longer world boss fights)
---
since reaper is much better for openworld and fractals.
---
if you use minons i think shadow fiend should have more dps then shadow bone
---
I dont count all items, but the only super rare item I got is Crystal infusion :( The rest is junk
---
[There are your options](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/85l5d2/personal_story_flow_chart/) done as flowchart - personal story lines are branching depending on your chosen during character creation biography factors and later when you decide on your next move but ultimately all races face the same destiny as pact commander fighting with the *big bad guy*. 
---
Story mode of first expansion has little bit different dialogues for characters of one race - because of lore setting; there's an associated achievement for going thru Heart of Thorns story with that race. Later on, devs decided that characters of certain professions playing within some of Living Story episodes will be granted with additional information - for example, engineers will see more while warrior won't because he's the muscles and not the brain. It was recently reported in sub that characters of different professions may hear slightly different dialogues in second expansion maps.
---
If this game will kick for you, it's possible that within time you'll get additional character slots - I started with 1 character, after few months I had 4 and now I'm holding 15 to do thing differently in game.
---
Choices are up to you and you won't screw if you decide for one thing over another - these are rather cosmetic than shaping your total game experience (tho some may argue that one profession is better or does things better, or race lore is more interesting). You can test out all professions tho on f2p account it may be bit hard and then decide which one fits you best. Mind that each 365 days your character gets a [birthday gift](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Birthday_Gift) which are getting better each year, and it is advised to keep a character for these little bonuses.
---
I sometimes miss the first cycle and can always find people doing them. I don't know if you're on EU or what but there is always people for them.
---
It's Happy Birthday somewhere in the world
---
what pet, golemancer runes
---
Sounds like you're still very much in profit.
---
I saw buy orders for Crystal Infusions at 10k gold.
---
but it can't see them because the forest is in the way D=
---
this
---
yeah, but the round before the vinetooth has branded minions.  
---
all the other rounds, the minions are the same dragon class as the upcoming boss
---
You can join guilds regardless of region, but you cant play with them. Chat and other functions work normally.
---
Seems you had fun getting all of those.
---
I heard that the drop rate of super rare items is 0,0001% :) Perhaps I get lucky, but I want Gift of Aurene instead :(
---
No, I'm happy with this drop, no more gambling :) No one gets super rare item drop twice in a short time :D
---
If I had 1 Gift of Aurene dropped, I would be extremely happy XD
---
GW2 is basically ALL endgame :S  
---
There's essentially no content obsolesence the way there is in most (MMO) games. If i go back to a starting zone and kill level 1 creatures, i get useful materials and (potentially) top level loot.  
---
Granted, there might be more productive uses of my time, but that's still a better model than "The latest raid wing is the only content in the game that matters, everything else is either pointless or just part of the levelling process"
---
Of course, from both I prefer the third, where Zojja finds a cure or another Asura
---
She had so much potential and then they milked her dry..  But that pretty much goes for the entire cast really.
---
Its not that they replaced them, but rather sidelined them. Replaced assumes they're no longer good at doing what they did (which isnt entirely true as they can still be a healer or boon share quite effectively) its just that FB and Ren can both spec as DPS or a Healer without giving up their boon support (for example Quickbrand and some forms of Diviner Renegade are DPS specs of the Healbrand or Healer Renegade builds, providing boons like Might, Quickness, Alacrity, etc) this effectively gives challenging 5 man content like Fractals access to essentially an extra DPS or two instead of relying on 3 DPS and 2 supports.
---
Yikes u already sold it on tp?
---
Holy shit, he did the [red nose day thing with Stephen Colbert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3658C2y4LlA)! I had no idea he was the voice here!
---
If Taimi dies we riot. I will fly out to Anet's offices to personally punch whoever's responsible in the face until they agree to undo it!
---
so if i wanted to play a class that's good/great in both fractals and raids that wouldn't hinder my group, what should i play? I'm looking at chrono, fb. and druid
---
I've already leveled a thief and he is already a Daredevil. Now if you are leveling a thief right now my suggestion is to go p/p. Just spam pistol3 on mobs. For gears this is what I did, I craft gears @ lvl15(precise), 25(hunter's), 35(hunter's-m), 45(strong), 55(knight's) and 65(assassin's-m\[yellow\]). I also put Sigil of Air and Sigil of Acc on my pistols. [Here](http://gw2skills.net/editor/?vZAQJA6al0MhenYjTwyJw+EH+ElvIqiXYHADwZ2Tr1MHA-jhABQAgDCA8BAIKoMC-e) is what my build on leveling thief will looks like. I get Critical Strike traits first then Trickery. The Acrobatics traits is optional I use it so that I have swiftness the moment I dodge back. If your initiatives runs out use weapon swap and steal then pistol3 again until the mobs die. This may be a boring build for you but it is the safest build for me. Enjoy playing.
---
I mainly have to play competitive, and I still have to play GW1 for 550AP :)
---
Got 7 of them now :P
---
I clear up storage and sell materials already
---
I just want to complete as many achieves as I could also the ones that doesnt give me anything. Like I still have to defeat a Dev  :(
---
my husband just helped me make a new norn, and even after 7 years of playing this game, i had no idea that he was the va! neat coincidence, happy birthday matt!
---
Ppl are so easely triggered. It is just a game ffs
---
Ask him.
---
tfw we have 4 different condi food variants and butternut still has no alternative.
---
Thank you!
---
Where is the "I want to end it now" option
---
I would call this being praised for top dps.
---
Haha git gd 😂😂😂
---
Raids r for toxic elitists anyway lmao
---
There is nothing to improve when its abour failing
---
THE BEST MMO COMMUNITY LUL
---
You don't necessarily hinder your group in fractals with Chrono+Druid but this setup is way less powerful than FB+Ren.
---
On the other hand even if it is possible I would not recommend playing Firebrand on ALL the bosses (there are only 2-4 I would really advise against it but for the rest it works pretty well).
---
If you are thinking about doing more Fractals than Raids in the near future I would go for FB (ideally with Power + Condi Quickbrand gear). If you are going to do a more Raids than Fractals I would go for Chrono.
---
If they want a high skillcap farming method, they should make raid cms repeatable and very profitable, much better idea than repeating an underwater fractal 30 times in an hour
---
Those people are stupid.
---
When the game launched, representing the guild actually meant something. Everything you did in the game generated Influence, and that currency went to the guild you were representing. If you represented another guild it would go to that one, if you didn't represent a guild it would de wasted. Also there was a single guild chat. /g chat. It showed the chat of the guild you were currently representing. So basically if you were not representing, you were kinda temporarily out of the guild.
---
But all of this is gone since HoT release. You have /g1 to /g5 to see all guild chats regardless of which one you're currently representing (or not representing any), and Influence system has been removed, and replaced with currencies that don't depend on representation.
---
You still see plenty of guild recruiting ingame and saying they require representation ... it's stupid. Nowadays representation is just a relic of the past, it does basically nothing, except show the guild's chat in a brighter yellow and show its tag near your game.
---
I've been waiting for an update to TacO along these lines. I decided to make my own modification, with a focus on customization. Personally, I like to have a separate line for each map. Feel free to do whatever you want with this.

This happened quite often while i farmed this for the collection. TBH it's just crappy event design. I never understood (a) why the crystal is attackable and (b) why there is this weird loot reset or (c) why there are two different meteor events in the first place. But you are right, players can go crazy about it. They somehow took this NO DMG rule in and absolutely enforce it. It's not like you loose tons of loot when the crystal is destroyed premature.
---
&gt; i was just trolling them
---
That's one of the reasons some guilds have age requirements. Sometimes higher than 18 (I've seen 25 a few times, even 30 once) to avoid teenage behaviors (which exist beyond 18).
---
ok
---
Lol I want Gifr of Aurene so badly. It is one of prettiest weapon skins I have ever seen in this game :))
---
A new street tree, you say? Clearly this is a hint that we'll get a new sylvari cast member with a rough and tumble inner-city background in season 5.
---
Before doing story and meeting Taimi I didn't like asuras. Now I have 7 of them.
---
When I read bat i thought of a literal bat and I was like five minutes looking for that flying thing.
---
No endgame was the case at launch and where folks mostly got that misconception, but the game has been out for over 7 years with several xpacs and content releases several times a year.
---
Three. 80 warrior (hand leveled), 80 necro (boosted), 80 thief (boosted)
---
(plus an obligatory L50 bag opener and L45 crafting bot)
---
You forgot pvp and wvw 😂😂
---
Dear arena net, for 7 years you've been giving us multiple examples of events being more lucrative to fail than complete. Don't you learn at all?
---
Considering the requirements to make this farm efficient it was absolutely unrealistic to think that it could've had an impact on the economy. That said, I understand the nerf
---
The core game adversaries are unfortunally neglected. The fire legion, the nightmare court and svanir never really appear as an organized or interesting enemy again. Even the inquest are just there without offering any depth. Kudu at least had a goal. His daughter appeared in sandswept and I would wish she takes over as an inquest lead and continues kudus storyline instead of this generic inquest do bad things stuff.
---
I know this is a bit of an r/unpopularopinion moment but if you’re new to a farm and you ignore /m, you’re kind of an asshole. When Dragonfall was released people continued to DPS, absolutely ignoring the fact that people spammed in both /m and /s to stop DPSing. Some people say ”well it’s only one minut or two at best” when we have to recoordinate again, but it’s 1-2 minutes wasted on 65+ people. That’s anywhere from an hour to two hours ***per meta event***.
---
All I’m saying is that if you’re new then pay attention to what other people are doing and if you ignore them then you’re the asshole.
---
or if its found to be offensive

From a dps perspective its only cause of the reveal on dagger 4 for mobs he could just use dagger pistol and have a dagger of hand to have d/d for champions

Hello! I'm completely new to GW2, so I have some questions and I checked the newplayers guide which didn't answer my questions. Before I played WoW, Aion, Rift and one or two other mmorpgs.
---
First of all I haven't bought the game, because I play for free. I don't find anything regarding how long I can play. Is there some limitation?
---
Second question would be I read on this subreddit there are healer, but in the "Which class should I play" List there are no healer listed. Are there no healing class? I only read something about the druid as a healing and support spec
---
If you are referring to the moment where all three bosses have to be defeated at the same time, then I would agree with you, because in that case the event will fail and everyone is screwed.
---
In this case, just pinging a skill or yelling at people being monkeys might not be productive.
---
In my experience, it is more effective to write a short sentence as to why a certain action should or should not be done. "Please, do not dps the meteor because it will give everyone less loot" or "Please instead of dpsing  use the multitool. If you don't have one, you can get one at the Astralarium and it will give you more loots!", would probably work better, and new people would understand the reasoning behind it.
---
That would work if people would listen, which they generally don’t. I’m not agreeing with the people who decide to namecall others, but ignoring other players is also bad. No side here is justified imo.
---
I don't understand.
---
38 and counting, all have at least one elite spec, 33 have both elite specs, at least 3 sets of ascended armor for each profession one each for viper, marauder and minstrel specs, and ascended weapons, working on the ascended armor sets now.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Depending on what I am working on I have some parked at JPs to get map currencies, others at quartz nodes (came in handy for the skyscale), several equipped for raids and others for wvw. Of course 6 or 7 are equipped for pve.
---
That's on my main account and their names all start with "Darth", my alt accounts I'd have to look it up because I don't login to those everyday and their names do not necessarily start with Darth. I've boosted some, others leveled the slow way.
---
If he were with me, he would have granted me "Gift of Aurene" as well :D
---
Great number, I have 38 too!
---
Anet have been doing this since the game’s inception. Orr farming, leggie weapon collections etc etc etc
---
You could always climb up the TP without glitches and glide from there to the roof. Both the TP and the bank have those little black footholds because you’re meant to be able to get up there.
---
Necro minion master is incredibly forgiving. I use Axe Warhorn and Dagger Warhorn for rage and melee options and run unholy sanctuary for additional survivability on top of my absurd mountain of HP. unholy sanctuary is a grandmaster trait in the death magic specialization, which is a solid line for running minions anyway.
---
I like the types of quests for the Aurora and mawdrey. Any more that spring to mind?
---
or we thank Anet for having consequences and letting a character that is terminally ill actually die ?
---
her only selling factor is her cuteness and the fact that she more or less needs to be protected. She's very arrogant and stubborn, and gets to save the day with a new asuran device almost every new episode bc no other races can have solutions to anything. 
---
her characteristics are typical for asura, but people excuse way too much stuff she says or does - whereas they'd be weirded out if it was Blish or Phlunt, or even Zojia - especially the one part where she basically filmed the commander high on space shrooms and thought it was fun to send it to everyone. usually when asura go on about how they're the best and all they are looked down upon, whereas with Taimi it's openly celebrated because she's cute and fragile.
---
Personally I feel like Anet is taking Taimi's "something to prove" attitude too far.
---
Ever since after HoT, Dragon's Watch pretty much already regard Taimi as a very valuable member of their team, and many of her peers also regard her as a prodigy.
---
But even so, Anet keeps trying to write her into scenarios where she gives off a "I've got something to prove" vibe as with the whole Season 3 plot, some parts of PoF, and initially in Season 4, before we rescue Blish and Gorrik. 
---
After that, she gets toned down but I the damage is already done for me : She's just there to sound smart and act smart, until she isn't actually needed anymore. 
---
I'm pretty damned sure it's a problem with me on this but god I find the "heh, I'm smart" type of characters annoying as hell.
---
Yes, it's one of the thinsg I meant with 'casters'.
---
Technically it'd e 'scholars', but not that many people use that term for light armor professions.
---
* Here is a [list of restrictions](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Account#Free_accounts) for Free-to-play accounts. You have a few restrictions on inventory space, character slots and communication but that's about it.
---
* There are no *dedicated* healer class in GW2 because a lot of them can do it! They don't all provide the same kind of healing, support or utility but Revenant, Guardian, Engineer, Ranger, Elementalist and Necromancer can all be healers in their own way with the correct elite specialisation (it's a kind of unique sub-class available with expansions for each class).
---
Please destroy LA again Anet and bring back the old style.
---
Not bad, not terrible:-P
---
Yes! I would also love to see mobs use class skills like in GW1
---
OooOOh sounds very interesting, I’ll check it out!
---
In my opinion, the scarlet's armies one is not. 
---
First of all, the pot is only worth using in 100/99 CM fractals. It is VERY good there (but ny no means a necessity), but other factors make buying the recipe not worth it
---
Second, you can buy about 5 full stacks of those pots for the price of the 5 jorbreakers it costs to buy the recipe. Factoring in the cost of the crafting materials makes it even less worth it. 
---
Third, the price of the pots has remained quite consistently low since season 1, when the pots were temporarily made available as drops, even though they were never subsequently available. The leftover supply from season 1 must have been huge, and the demand was apparently quite low, which kept the price low. Now that the potions can be crafted, I can't see the demand exceeding the supply at any point in the future. 
---
Fourth, we can reasonably expect the recipes will return as a purchase in future Dragon Bashes.
---
That said, who knows what anet may ultimately do in the future to artificially increase demand or diminish supply.
---
The other potion recipes I can't see being worth it at all.
---
Those Feels Right in the Tybalt.
---
There's a lot of them in every living story episode and PoF. Skyscale and Vision are similar to those.
---
r/trahearnejokes
---
Thanks! I'll check it out.
---
Yes, support can do it. They say they avoid doing it unless they have to, because it 'breaks stuff', but I saw someone's account name (i.e. account.1234, not character) on my friends list get force changed for an incredibly minor naming infraction, so apparently that's changed at some point. Send a ticket and see what happens.
---
Thanks so much for the replies!
---
I mean I want Gift of Aurene, not infusion :(
---
I bet they'll get spontaneously threatening again when we eventually get the Jormag/Flame Legion Homelands stuff.
---
I also thought that naming that character was interesting. They've used a female norn in the past as the PC in things, so it could possibly be a character they already used. But if they haven't used Anja before, them I think it is likely a tease like you said.
---
No, Monthly is independent of Daily. A quick way to tell is that 40k+ AP is currently achievable in game - without monthly being separate, it is not. 15k is dailies only, which I wrapped into the 32786, but your thinking does apply to the daily achievements that existed before the rework.
---
I severely disagree. Basic villainous concepts 100% be used to write effective villains. Judge Frolo in the Hutchback of Notre Dame was a religious zealot but that doesn't mean wasn't written as a good character. It depends entirely how they're written and what characters are chosen to represent them. Honestly, Palawa Joko is just a power hungry tyrant but good writing and characterization made him one the game's most beloved villains. The same could be done with a new charr leading a reborn Flame Legion if Anet put in the time and effort. To say that there is no potential in any concept is to a lack of understanding of fundamental writing ability.

---
They are already tinkering with cooking(probably streamlining recipes and effects), preparing us for those extra 100lvls
---
Hey it's me ur brother. Could I like, have that infusion? Kthx
---
You know what would be good in this scene? If we get Taimi to cry. You know what players love? Taimi crying. Lets get her to cry here too, that will really trigger dem feels.
---
She went from the one note "asuran exposition" character to the one note "crying sick child" character. No interesting story happens around her, so much story focus is put into her personal drama it really detracts from telling other stories or giving other characters time to be present in the story.
---
Level a class that you don't have maxed yet.
---
Yeah most average groups got all the kills and CMs in 2-3 sittings. It really feels like all the fights were missing one extra mechanic. Great concepts but especially on fights like regular Adina the *only* relevant mechanic is pillars, nothing else really pressures you outside that mechanic.
---

You can do all of these typically within an hour and 15 min after reset
---
The first 3 chapters of the Personal Story is dictated by your race. 
---
* The Story for level 10 is based on what you chose as the first biography question in character creation.
---
* The Story for level 20 is based on the second biography question    
---
* The Story for level 30 is based solely on your race.
---
In addition, the story for Level 50 is limited by your race. There are 5 options, but you can only pick from 3. Which 3 are available depends on your race.
---
The rest of the story (Really the vast majority of it) is the same. You may get minor dialog differences--at one point an Asura will comment that you haven't done any research in a while if you're also an Asura, for example. Same goes for gender. Minor dialog changes, nothing big.
---
When the raid community is more active so is community inclusion, in the Wing 1-3 days the Raid community was active as ever and (anecdotally) I feel people were constantly running training and progression raids. Once the 9 month wait times dropped so did the community.
---
People can't introduce others to raids if all those people quit the game waiting for 3h of content every 9 months.
---
I agree. Only "problem-ish" that I see with LvL80 boosters is that players get their max lvl and don't know what to do and most of them give up. If only they would have read the wikia a bit or seen a few videos from popular YTbers on how to play they will be more than fine even with the booster and less than 5hrs under their belt. 
---
With that said, exploration is also a huuge part of the game. Now all that's left is to tell these new lvl80 players that there are Legendaries in the game, and for them you need map completion. But say in a nicer way than me now. 
---
After all this, new commers will have a maxed lvl toon, start exploring the maps and stop worrying that they will be getting killed every 2nd blow they take. Besides, they won't be a hastle for raiders cause they will only populate lvl1-20 at first and if will enjoy will get what they need for more!
---
IMO, GW2 requires tip manager/assitant like so many other games have it. It will help more than that window of "Here is what you will get when you'll get to lvl 69".
---
If only I got Gift of Aurene instead :)
---
Try gw2crafts 
---
It will give the best route and cheapest/fastest at the time. And you can upload your API key to get even more help from this website. It's safe to use.
---
I really miss Zojja. I'd even take Phlunt over Gorrik, Taimi or Blish. They put so much effort into making us like those three it feels really cheap and detracts from their characters to me (Gorrik and Blish are basically FMA rip offs). Phlunt feels like he has more potential as a character because he is so deeply flawed (similar to Canach but worse). I think Phlunt would be a much better story character as a protagonist because he's challenging to the audience - we aren't supposed to like him but he often makes sense - especially early on.
---
When Taimi has flaws (like keeping all the Elder Dragon research in Rata Novus to herself - not letting other asura or even the Pact use it) they never shift her from a sympathetic character because we are supposed to like her. She gets away with it. Had Phlunt done that he would have the karmic death ending or be banished to Inquest exile.
---
You and me both :-D
---
Itight sound weird, but who's this person? I really don't know.
---
This is a good observation!  According to the wiki, Anja was only added with this recent Dragon Bash patch, so it does seem quite possible that she'll either be the new stand-in for the Commander in promotional material, or she'll be a new upcoming NPC.
---
In either case, it makes it interesting to speculate what that means for Season 5.  Duncan's design is intentionally very Elonian, to tie in with the setting for PoF and most of LS4.  With Anja being a Norn, that potentially means we might be heading up to the Shiverpeaks next, or at least going north in general.  Whether that means Blood Legion Homelands, or Far Shiverpeaks, I'm down.
---
That's a fair point.
---
I still think that it's not ok how we literally need to buy the rewards from the TP (in form of Jorbreakers) instead of being able to farm them by playing the event. What's the point of an event if I spend more time grinding gold as fast as I can instead of playing the time limited content?
---
Get a large storage unit and make it NTFS
---
Fuck you, ArenaNet.
---
Greatest waste of potential I've ever seen.
---
Game Development needs time. Quality is better than quantity. If there's no current content you are interested in just play another game.
---
OR lets have this piece of *fantasy* fiction be hopeful and explore the *fantasy* of living in a world where magic and technology can do things we in reality can't to help people with disabilities live and live well, instead of aiming to be yet another Dark and Gritty attempt at making *fantasy*, that by its very definition is supposed to be *fantastical*, into something realistic. And maybe lets not offer another smart, female, asura character up for doom and misery given that we've already Been there, Done that that with Zojja. 
---
As for arrogant and stubborn, until I hear Rytlock or really any of the other characters (other than Braham, bc everyone hates Braham) get the same criticism to the same extent as Taimi I'm not going to hear a word of it - especially because it's refreshing to see a genius female character who knows she's a genius, which never seems to be a problem for people when the character is male (see TV: The Big Bang Theory, Sherlock Holmes in Sherlock and Elementary, The Mentalist, Lie to Me, Bull, etc.). 
---
If you don't like her that's fine, not everyone loves every character, but maybe recognize that many people do love her and find her important both as a female characters and a character dealing with disability, and don't actively root for her to die. Let people enjoy her and focus your attention elsewhere.
---
So how about you change the storage format?
---
You can get five Jorbreakers every five days by picking them from the repeatable 5x dailies achievement instead of a Holographic precursor skin.  Don't forget about that when considering options to amass Jorbreakers.. or just to make gold.
---
&gt; taking an entire decade to even take down
---
conflicting 
---
&gt; stepping into the arena and getting downed after 2 seconds
---
does not compute
---
...
---
You either have fun, or do the other thing. You want to have fun winning, but to win you have to use the un-fun ways? Staying out of pvp can also be fun. If we are here to talk about options.
---
I sold it immediately lol :)
---
"File is too large, any way I can unpack the file to make it bigger so it'll fit?"
---
Thank you guys ^^
---
Game development needs time, but Arenanet's content pace is abysmally slow compared to most of other studios of a similar size. The 'just play another game' argument is a little frustrating, when the point is obviously that people want to play THIS game instead, but are starved for anything new.
---
And add another one and you have a glorified poo in the middle
---
I get to plat most seasons, which i know isn't amazing, but i have almost 2k matches under my belt... and i have to say i don't hate the meta **that** much... at least not as much as others seem to, and i disagree with a lot of what you've said.
---
&gt; Ele's are non-existent 
---
A good weaver can still carry his team, they're pretty great for solo queue.
---
&gt; necro's are being used as doormats, 
---
Both their elite specs are perfectly viable, and still frequently seen in the highest level of play.
---
Sure they have counters now, but having counters doesn't make them doormats.
---
&gt; mesmers bursting with that fucking pistol like there is no tomorrow, 
---
Good thing pistol shots can be dodged &amp; reflected aye. If a specs burst is reliant on a handful of abilities, that's perfectly balanced since it gives the opportunity for counter-play &amp; punishes them if mismanaged.
---
&gt;  scrappers taking an entire decade to even take down 
---
Spellbreakers absolutely shit on scrappers 100% of the time. Rather quickly too.
---
&gt; guardians being their usual buckets of shit... 
---
Guardians are probably the single most balanced class in the game right now...
---
&gt; I'm honestly tired of stepping into the arena and getting downed after 2 seconds. I can't even use my heal skill without getting perma-stunned by fucking warriors. 
---
Stability? Stun-breaks? Dodge rolls? Re-positioning? Blocks? Evades?
---
Try timing your actions to counter the warriors animations, instead of spamming your own rotation without thinking about your opponent.
---
&gt; But right now, we're getting spammed by mechanic after mechanic and there just is NO time to make the split second decision on what to do next. 
---
I agree it is quite bursty, but counter play **does** exist, and it's easy to see when comparing a plat to a silver/gold.
---
&gt; you have some god damn ranger bursting you down from the other side of the map. 
---
The thing is, that ranger build is literally only good for that one specific thing, and becomes utterly useless in other circumstances.
---
Min/maxing your build to be perfect at **one specific** situation, is actually fair &amp; balanced in my opinion.
---
&gt; I'm only able to survive as a bunker scrapper right now, 
---
This explains why you're salty about warriors &amp; perma-stuns.
---
The whole rant makes a lot more sense to me now.
---
r/ofcoursethatsathing
---
Holy shit this is mid ranged? x.x
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Anja_Inntill got ripped
---
1. Get a format that supports those large files
---
2. use an archive software that can split files into chunks, you know, like WinRar
---
If you want to extract the files from the .dat you also need to reverse the process again which most likely end in the file being broken and you have to replace it and re-download everything again.
---
One of their biggest failures is not introducing characters properly. Some villains, we meet them for the first time, and then they're dead a few minutes later. Happens all the time in the Personal Story, which makes you wonder why they did even bother giving each of them an unique name.
---
Faolain was the only character who had a somewhat decent buildup (still lame she originally only appeared in the dungeon story mode, and nowhere in the PS), and then they butchered her wasting the whole buildup. Like, you build a villain for years, and then she gets killed randomly. What the fuck.
---
Balthazar wasn't even introduced properly, he just appeared out of nowhere. Then we get to know he was freed by Rytlock like an expansion ago. Why didn't we meet him before then? Would have been cool to have him help us during HoT, as a random old man. Screams of poor planning.
---
And don't even get me started on Caudecus and Lazarus, the whole White Mantle storyline portrayed them as absolute clowns, instead of the actual secret society they were supposed to represent.
---
I don't agree with everything said by OP, but realistically speaking Necro IS a doormat. Without a firm support class at their hand they just get pingponged and bursted within seconds. Necros don't have increased endurance regeneration traits, they have no ability to block, none of their skills count as evade and their stability is unreliable as it doesn't last long, is immediately stripped or just 1 stack, which is instantly consumed in the bombardment of ccs that the current meta carries with it. It's not very enjoyable when nearly every class will hunt you and you have nothing to hold against it but your "second health bar" meme.
---
Other classes in the quicktalk: Ranger can't do much else than abuse the shit out of the silly high Gazelle dmg right now while sniping with sickem, as without their ridiculous damage output they'd struggle to find a place in pvp ever since the boonbeast fell off. 
---
Guardians struggle ever since the Righteous Instincts trait nerf which prevents them from effectively running Valk amu. Without it the damage is lacking, as is their survivability. Especially affected is hammer core as hammer was nerfed just before the Instinct changes.
---
Warriors just happily rampage through the matches. Their setup of constant cc pummeling into straight brutal damage at times is completely undermined by the cheer force that rampage carries. Not much you can do when the warrior adds to outnumber you and pulls rampage.
---
Thieves are decap machines and occasionally you find a deadeye that really hurts. Otherwise they are just bothersome flies you swat away.
---
Mesmers. Mesmers are everywhere and every single one of them and their mothers run the rupt mantra. Only gets better with Chaos traitline so you get immobilized when interupted. Upgrades even more if they run Chrono so slow condi also stacks upon you. What fun to not be able to move or play your character, at times. But hey, just dodge 4Head.
---
While eles are there, they did fall off a lot and don't remotely have the impact anymore you make them out to have.
---
Revs just fucking hurt, their insane damage output is only managed by attempting to counter-pressure them with some conditions. Else they just melt anyone in a teamfight. And in order to bring them in line anet nerfed their sword auto attacks LUL
---
And then there's engis. Holo has its firm place right now, bringing good dmg and cc to the table. Meanwhile scrapper just afk on point and you'll have a hard time getting them away from there. And don't forget, they can gamble every few seconds to also get a funny little rampage like their big warrior brothers. So that's fun, I guess.
---
Overall, though, one can complain about individual classes as much as they want, fact is that it would be tough to call this good balance. While core guard fell from the heavens without any compensation and reaper received seemingly unnoticed nerfs, people had complaind about rev damage. We receives a rev auto attack nerf while at the same time they brought scrapper rework and with it a new player in the really unfun pvp scenario. 
---
More frequent balance attempts would be hella appreciated
---
Anja could be the female norn briefly seen in some S2 cinematics.  
---
Both wear heavy armor and have a similar face, but the equipment and the facial tatoos are different. 
---
Anja could also represent S3 even thought S3 didn't have a commander in the trailers, since she wears the Houndskin shoulders.
---
I've ran out of games to cycle through tbh. I have spent a lot of money trying out other games but I will keep coming back. Only GW2 can fill that void and I keep hoping there is something here that will make me want to login every day but there hardly is anymore.
---
And the good guys don't get any better. If GW1 was Lord of the Rings, GW2 is a generic Marvel movie.
---
Play whatever you want until 80, I recommend d/d or p/p or both. When you get to 80, either run d/d all the time or get daredevil elite spec and camp staff, it’s an insane weapon for open world. D/p daredevil is a pvp/wvw build for the most part, in pve you don’t really want the blinds/dazes as much as you want more damage, as thief already has more than enough evasion without weapon skills. Staff also gives you “vault”, a damaging leap that can act as extra dodges.
---
It took longer to get the holo dragon arena to lvl 100 than to get w7 title.
---
Thanks for the approach! I just made sure NTFS can be used on device at my destination, so I will tranform the stick to NTFS for now, and back to FAT32 later, this is easier for me to do.
---
mimimimi
---
Yeah, I know. For the craftstation you needed to stand in very specific spots, co to character select and back in because it would load your character on the higher level
---
Adapt to the meta. just take some stability and/or reflecting and some projectile blocking destroying and youre good honestly. or use your mobility skills to avoid them.
---
no SAB shield, not updoot ÒnÓ
---
That would be interesting and fun, yeah!
---
Necromancers are only good in high tier play because of the coordination in rotations. They aren't all that viable in ranked, and that pushes support firebrand out the door. That's why you end up with a lot more hybrids.
---
Hey now, you got a new fancy WvW mount that got more balance patches in 3 months than PvP in 3 years.
---
Hello! This cosplay will be the last one for awhile. The upcoming cosplay-post will be an update of the previous "Big List Of Cosplays" and contain atleast 125 new ones compared to the old one, but i still have a few more to do :). Here are the skins for this post:
---
Zelda: Stately Circlet, Divinier Mantle, Lunatic Acolyte Coat, Council Ministry Gloves, Aristocrat's Pants and Feathered Boots.
---
Link (Breath of the Wild): Scout's Coat, Rawhide Bracers, Rogue Pants, Seeker Boots and Bronze Shield.
---
Link (Twilight Princess): Festive Hat, Duelist Coat, Rawhide Bracers, Rogue Pants, Seeker Boots, Vigil's Honour Shield and Ebon Vanguard Sword.
---
Ugh, dont get me started on the mount.... And yeah, the game modes balanced around pvp gets no love what so ever.
---
Of the ***OMEGA*** variety
---
This is horrible, take my upvote! &lt;3
---
I have 27 characters that I split between 3, let's call them, families. 
---
One for raw damage, another for conditions and the last one for support.

Hmmm I wonder what this meme would look like if the focus was "the number of people who raid" vs "the number of people who play story releases".
---
It would have been a good idea to have checked up on the lore beforehand.
---
&gt; What if the Tyria itself was created by the six gods or their predecessors (***The Elder Gods***)out of the mists since they can already create their own realm? 
---
We've known since GW1 that the gods are not native to Tyria, Neither are Humans. Tyria existed before the gods arrived as did the Elder Dragons, Though we don't know which of the two groups is older we do know some of the gods replaced a predecessor and that Grenth was born after the gods arrived on Tyria and Kormir ascended to godhood during GW1. 
---
The gods did not create Tyria, But they did have a hand in terraforming it after the destruction of the previous Elder Dragon awakening, They brought humans with them and dispersed them, Balthazar actively encouraged Humans to war with the native races.
---
Community inclusion has easily been the weakest part of the raiding community. Pockets of it exist, but raiding in GW2 is overwhelming known for it's exclusivity. It was intentional design of raids and it is also a leading reason why raids didn't get picked up as easily as they did in games like WoW where anyone can pop LFG and experience raids easily.
---
He's a very prolific voice actor, and is most known for being the DM for a Twich streamed DnD 5E game called Critical Role.

Why should Raids matter when most raiders never use party search or allow anyone to join them that hasn't made playing the raids mechanical and robotic? I mean really. Most raiders expect them to invest in a super small % of players. Makes sense for a business... For sure. I got an idea if the raiding community (Yes, I raid too btw) wants to get dev time then make the community bigger aka don't be total tools. Maybe be nice to players new to raids, maybe use party search, maybe not try to turn a game into mindless clicking of how fast you can farm a boss, maybe hold training for players. You want raids to get better, you want there to be more raids then help make the raid community less pseudo elite and increase the number of players using raids. More than half the people I talk to that stay away from raids don't stay away because it's hard. They don't raid cause they never see groups forming, the raid community is hostile overall and they never get a chance to learn (all groups that do form require high amount of exp). You want the devs to shape up?! How about the raiding community shapes up and gives them a reason to care about raids other than the whining of a few loud lames. Real talk, you're welcome.

I'm having issues shaving seconds down, the best I can do is 1:06:110 - I wish I could 1:05:56

it is. raiding is the contender.

Why go back to Fat32? Why not just stay NTFS, or swap to ExFAT if you need portability?
---
impressive indeed

would be your whole region (eu/na), which i doubt

tyvm for helping lame players
---
Nah, megaservers and all that, it's probably a timing issue
---
Gaheron Baelfire (Former leader of the Flame Legion) was literally trying to turn himself into a God so he could rule over the legions, so he definitely wasn't lacking in selfishness and he sure wasn't just a mindless zealot. This entire argument falls apart with the slightest bit of examination.
---
yeah, top Link should be "Link", and bottom Link should be "Link" instead :p
---
Aight- thx a bunch lad!
---
Maybe there is a behind the scenes cap? Otherwise I'd say like 100 nodes is a small sample size. 6/100 is a 6% drop rate.
---
She could be just an Anet named dev too shrug
---
Raiding in 2019...lol
---
Very helpful! thanks a lot !!
---
It does - thank you!
---
If there's no train active, just do the HPs you can do solo, and if you still need more points, all for help in map chat for the few group-oriented HPs. Almost all of them are intended to be soloable though, so you should be able to unlock your elite spec without help.
---
Ah I see. I’ll keep a lookout then. Thanks for the help lads.
---
That was pretty much my train of thoughts as well. Thanks a lot for sharing!!
---
i'm of another opinion, i don't think that multi dificulty mode would do raid any good, i think that raid SHOULD be a challenge, ends of it.
---
If you are a casual player there is other thing to do in the game, if you are a hardcore gamer raid should be interesting.
---
But as of now it's in a weird middle ground where it is not a dungeon organisation wise, but it's not challenging (when wise my guild roster we take more time waiting for everyone and get ready to raid than to clean a wing ..... when we are not a good raiding guild, you know there is an issu)
---
And for people who say that raid should be doable for everyone i say : no it should not, why would i want to do a fu\*king raid if it can be done by everyone, the thing i was hoping for raid was a feeling of achievment, i got that when i started doing raid, then it was casualise and now it's just the weekly dungeon
---
oH a kIdDy
---
What? Rytlock is a strong character with a lot of back story. If most NPCs would be like him it would be awesome. Lore has nothing to do with ingame gameplay. You are expected to play the game not watch a movie and lean back.
---
TFW a major chunk of the Taco markers for mount skipping don't even work anymore, after Anet went yard on "no fly/no mount" zones and invisible walls when sKyscale dropped.
---
No offence dude but you sound really spoilt.
---
Yeah, especially since major chunk of the Taco markers for mount skipping don't even work anymore, after Anet went yard on "no fly/no mount" zones and invisible walls when sKyscale dropped.

---
Thank you. I saw Nine Rings and was like “Wtf is that?” and remembered the the good old days in gw1
---
It's not 6/100 it's about 6/150 now. The issue is that I got those six in about the first 40. I have not gotten one in over a hundred nodes now. Statistically, this is nearly impossible. What are the chances that a with a 6% chance I would 6 in 40 and then 0 in a hundred nodes? So minuscule that caps are probably the only likely reason. It went from one every 4-5 to 0 in over 100 nodes. Completely unaffected by an increase of 100% magic find from buffs.
---
You can solve any jp with a teleport, gg
---
That's because WoW is famous for its raids and people play the game for the raids more often than not, raids in gw2 feel more like a sideproject and the community will treat it as such in terms if inclusivity. I guarantee you if GW2 had the level of raid releases WoW had there would be a much stronger community for training and progression raids.
---
I remember watching a bunch of youtube videos of a guy trying to get all the vials for his legendary, took him ages too (might have been multiple days). You're not alone. If you're getting frustrated log off and do something else. Come back when you're less frustrated.
---
Yes people shouldn't be able to do anything in a game they paid for... Wait isn't that what loot boxes already do?
---
You made a joke hihi haha but that joke came from a real point of view/opinion which you have. You didn’t make that joke because you don’t actually stand by it, you think it’s true but what nageniff said is more true. The toxic people you see in open world are the same people that do fractals/raids/pvp/wvw.
---
Nice I'll check it out! I figured there would be similar quests for s4. The only thing I don't like so far is the time gate for the druid stone.
---
&gt; for his le
---
I noticed this to. Everyone seems to log off, log back on and finish it leading me to believe it must have some cap as to how many you can get a day. I was just wondering if anyone else has noticed really weird shit going on with the drop rates. Seems like a lot of people have.
---
I’m curious about what you’re wearing! I can tell the bottom piece is Carapace, and the mantle is Raven’s - what’s the top? Either way, I love it!
---
Why you Wana mute Snoop Tiger?
---
What is this non sequitur?
---
Raids are something you can improve your skill to be able to clear. Lootboxes are pure RNG. It's not even close to being the same thing.
---
And then they decided not to make that permanent content but lock it behind a festival instead, further decreasing the number of raids in the game.
---
Looks beautiful!! Are you running ReShade?
---
But its pretty with glittering effect
---
I had to do the one in sirens landing. I don't like the classic way.
---
Had to pause YouTube walkthrough every 15 sec, do it and continue.
---
This will save so much time.
---
I DO NOT enjoy JP. This is a godsend. If you enjoy JP then don't use it. Everybody wins
---
Oh, definitely. Those two are much better characters, in my opinion.
---
It doesn't help when the 'challenge modes' are both non-repeatable, and in W7's case, also not that difficult.
---
Like, seriously. Each of the bosses add only a couple of changes. For each of them, one of those changes is making an already-existing mechanic slightly more punishing (going down on Sabir, falling into quicksand on Adina, and getting hit by lightning on Qadim). The other changes are pathetically minimal; if your static can beat normal mode and can handle the 10% more health on the boss, you can probably adapt to the CM differences in a night, no problem. If CMs are going to be non-repeatable, I want to be spending weeks learning the fight, adapting to the changes, and finally earning that achievement, and that difficulty just wasn't there on the W7 CMs.

Firstly, you keep bringing up gameplay but it has literally nothing to do with what I am talking about. I did not ask why they sucked and if I did then gameplay still wouldn't be an answer. This thread had absolutely nothing to do with gameplay. This discussion was entirely from a story perspective. This was a discussion about the Flame Legion not being competent or intimidating as villains. Gameplay has nothing to do with it. I'm not complaining that they don't do damage. I'm not complaining about a gameplay aspect. 
---
Secondly, the reliance on deities was not a complaint in and of itself but rather a point of comparison to the Grawl, another non-threatening enemy race. The purpose of that section is not to ask "why do they rely on gods". The purpose of that section is to point out that their behavior resembles that of Grawl, a race that habitually and comically seeks out gods in belief that it will make them more powerful, with the implication being behavior that so closely mirrors that of one of the lesser races makes them feel less intimidating. Like if the Inquest began acting like Skritt. 
---
Please avoid strawmaning people in the future and actually address their points.
---
For Fractals you will want some Power gear most of the time (usually the Renegade is the one healing), worst case is that with almost the same gear you will be able to go DH DPS if Power Quickbrand is already taken.
---
Depending on the fight and the group you may need to be able to do both. If you don't want to tank go for the Diviner+Zerk setup and if you want to tank go for Minstrel (but if it's your only gear set you will end up tanking most of the time but not all bosses have toughness tanking or are hard to tank). In the long run you may want to have both and 2 bosses really require 2 tanks (in W5 and W6).
---
Outside of raids there is no clear or consistent tanking: in fractals bosses and mobs will just end up attacking people without too much of a pattern and you will need pay attention to all the attacks whatever your role. For FB+Ren the Ren is usually the one healing because FB can output more DPS than the Ren (partly because it does not have to invest in much/any gear for boon duration). But a FB can totally be the one healing and have a Diviner Ren.
---
In raids, practically, a Chrono is the one tanking because it has access to a lot of blocks/evades without having to move the boss and sometimes a FB. Realistically other classes can end up tanking most bosses.
---
***
---
For build reference take look at [this section](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Builds) of a user guide in GW2 wiki.
---
Gw2 does not strictly have fixed roles assigned to specific classes.
---
A lot of classes can end up being healer with different way of healing and different utility/boons they can give: Renegade, Herald, Firebrand, Scrapper, Druid, Scourge and Tempest are all very good healers that you may want to mix and match depending on the fight and what your group has/want to do.
---
Almost any class can end up tanking bosses (even the harder ones) but only some provide the highest amount of "role compression" for a specific fight. If you check the website of Snowcrows (link can be found in the ressource I linked above) you can see in the Benchmark section that they have recommended "optimal" compositions for each boss and you can see that the support setup can vary from boss to boss. But if you are not going for a try hard run other setup can work just as well.
---
Sometimes it is just getting unbearably bad rng, but it may also be a hardcoded cap. If you have any Item Boosters they may help since you can get multiple harvests from the same node?
---
They're not exclusive to each other at all though.
---
Multiple times a day at least in HoT, I don't spend much time in PoF but some of the ones I see in HoT does both regions.
---
Nope. Monthly **was** independent but got merged when removed. 15k is the combination of dailies and monthlies. When they applied the cap, while monthlies still existed, the cap was split 10k for dailies and 5k for monthlies. When the monthlies were removed, they merged the cap.
---
https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Monthly
---
To quote the announcement about it (because apparently wiki doesn't mention it):
---
&gt; Finally, in a release coming early next year, we will merge the existing daily and monthly achievement point caps into one pool. This will allow players to continue working toward the maximum point totals for the daily achievement system without the existence of monthly achievements. 
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/introducing-the-new-daily-achievement-system/
---
That's a fair point, but the White Mantle's involvement with Living World Season 3 at the very least made them feel like a larger threat.
---
I was more meaning appearance.
---
Enemies using their own skills makes things seem a bit more realistic and makes mobs more unique imo, though it runs the obvious issue that core was hit all over the place in that it can be seriously far too easy to kill such mobs.
---
Except that is not true ...
---
if you buy a book you arent entiteled to undestand it. you need to make a effort to read it and understand the story. same thing with games you buy a game you are entiteled to play not to win.
---
Yeah, I think they're more along the lines of 1 in 100,000 chance.  
---
So you were pretty lucky. \^\^
---
And this is stated where? This just sounds like a bunch of speculation being passed off as truth.
---
If by ignore you mean not spend weeks to days looking for a community that actually communicates XD. I've done the whole looking for a raiding guild so many times and continue to do so. What I've seen so far is a lot of "raiding guilds" looking for new players. When those new players get into the guild they get a hardy welcome then a few hours to a few days later the new members start to find no one really uses discord or chat... community ... communicate... hmm. Most raiders stick to a static if they're in a raiding guild or not. So yeah there are countless "training guilds" and "communities" but you definitely have to put work into finding them. Then once found you get a "community" that doesn't communicate. It's not just a matter of players ignoring stuff. Go to party search right now, just for kicks. Tell me what you see. What squads do you see? Are they even with or outnumbered by raid sellers? The raiding community (if you can call it that) consists of factions of statics and guilds that don't communicate other than to look for more statics. This makes it hard for any player not spending an obscene amount of time looking for a group to actually raid. When it's harder to find a group rather than play the raid you know there is a big problem. I don't think it's soloy the raid community to blame however but they/we are a big part of it. Another big issue with a lot of GW2 group forming is due to a VERY bad UI/UX party system. The UI has way too many steps, poor design and it takes too long to make groups. Most of your time when using the system is watching party members come and go. If Anet truly wants to fix a lot of the issues with the GW2 population then fixing the UI/UX party search should be top of the list.
---
i could have seen it beeing a season 2 or three map considering the sizes, but now that weve moved on to mounts, im afriad we'll never go back to the places in between the maps, and thus, malyck is gone forever, along with critical lore points that have been retconned so that it doesnt matter what happens next
---
For Aurora, the JP have check-in points. 
---
Sirens landing never has a tele mesmer for this. In the valcano map I did get tele help
---
~~Cantha~~New Mesmer Elite specialization confirmed.
---
This isn't illogical but it could be?... In other words it can be considered offensive?
---
As long as there are no raid-exclusive rewards outside of account bound cosmetics, I would be fine with this.
---
So, your premise is flawed. You don't want to drag your team down, but this is arguably the least effective necro build on the planet. You will always be a massive drain on your team. This doesn't mean you can't run this, but if your goal is to survive and not letyour team down, there's some things you should change. I'm not some meta wizard, but I gave it a shot. I also added gear. Since you own both xpacks, I put you in the gear you can get pretty easily via Verdant Brink and the Living World maps.

---
You're still going to be a liability, but I \*think\* this will be better. I moved most of the tankiness off to gear rather than your traits. I replaced the bone fiend with Blood is Power to get your some spammable might to open fights with. Then I replaced your bone fiends with the higher DPS Shadow Fiend. I swapped Master of Corruption with Terror. MoC doesn't really do enough IMO to justify it. I replaced the Death Magic line with Soul Reaping because it lets you have a huge shroud pool, makes your staff worthwhile to use, and increases duration on you new damaging fear condition. Also Dhuumfire. I put you in Trailblazers with Orr runes with Carrion weapons with Earth and Agony sigils. This shouldn't be TOO expensive/hard to get. Armor is exotic because I wouldn't bother with ascended for this build. If you take this into Fractals, use Vipers and avoid attacks.
---
Overall, you're running into big problems if you take even this re-build into anything serious. Mostly because you're fucking with any toughness tank a super organized group is running. Toughness will also tend to get your focused more by enemies in general, so if you want to stay below the radar, just boost your vitality. In this case, go with full Carrion instead of the Trailblazers stuff.
---
Power Overwhelming would like a word.
---
&gt; What's the point of an event if I spend more time grinding gold as fast as I can instead of playing the time limited content?
---
Maybe that is the point.  Maybe it's a sneaky gold sink.
---
Let's all feel completely disappointed together buddy.
---
Yeah,  ReShade is really helpful for my poor  PC hardware\~\~
---
apart from maybe one or two, no server is truly full. while i see that the current population balance is a joke, opening all servers would just increase the issue due to even stronger bandwagoning, some already low-pop servers utterly deserted.
---
frankly this is just yet another symtom of the 7 year long neglect by ANet, one that has existed since before the links were introduced in the first place, and will only grow stronger as time goes by, unless the people in charge finally take a good hard look at what they have at their disposal, do a reality check, and finally understand what an amazing foundation they have created all that time ago, and how much potential it still holds.
---
I watch Critrole every week I didn't even know he did a voice in GW2.  awesome!
---
But not dusk
---
So the polar opposite of Sons Of Svanir with the anti female quirk?
---
Each area displays its monster level on the map screen. You can also go to other maps of the same level. You start off with unlocked waypoints in all 5 starting maps, you just have to find them on the map. If you die you have to respawn at a waypoint.
---
I absolutely love my reaper.  I put him in marauder’s gear and it’s just great.  Definitely still viable.
---
A sentence or two to remind us who Malyck is would be great
---
For gender, I've never seen a difference. Their may be few instances where an npc refers to your character as "he" or "she", but even that's pretty rare. You certainly don't get quests like Guild Wars 1's [Bear Club For Women](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bear_Club_for_Women) (for females) or [Bear Club For Men](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Bear_Club_for_Men) (for males). The dances are the same, and it's really a question of cosmetics: which character model do you prefer looking at?
---
For race, the stories are pretty different - enough that I'd always recommend playing through each race at least once. I don't remember all of them (since they are *somewhat* branching, there's a lot), but (someone else feel free to chime in here!):
---
* The Asura (my personal favorite) come off as a combination of goofy and mad scientist. They're all about the progress of knowledge, sometimes at the expensive of themselves (or more likely, others). They can be a little silly, but also surprisingly poignant: the Asura family and romantic relationships are *incredibly* strong. 
---
* The Charr are *very* militaristic, and they seem to love telling you about it. While both they and the Norn are fight-loving cultures, the Charr go more for fighting as part of a group. Unless you're really, really good at your job (or really, really bad), the Charr aren't interested in your personal accomplishments as much as those of your military group (called a "warband"). If, however, one of your Charr ancestors does something bad, it'll be up to you to fix that.
---
* Humans are a bit of a dying race, according to some, and just holding on, according to others. They've got a surprisingly varied storyline, but most of it centers around political intrigue: in the last major human metropolis in Tyria, there are a lot of people that think stabbing the queen is a good way to get your political opinion heard.
---
* Norn are individualistic, tho not *nearly* as much so as in GW1. That is, Norn (especially those following Wolf) are very willing to work together in 'packs'. However, they still put an emphasis on your personal accomplishments. The first Norn story basically has you doing a Big Thing to prove that you're worth paying attention to. Norn tend to party hard and fight hard, and then be all okay (mostly) in the morning. I personally found the Norn story a bit formulaic, but hey.
---
* Finally, the Sylvari are a combo of naivety and Arthurian legend. They're still figuring themselves out, and are mostly about interpreting their religious text (Ventari's tablet). If you wanna go with the traditional fantasy trope of being the Knight in Shining (or in this case, verdant) Armor, go Sylvari.
---
For profession, I'd probably second what others have said and suggest Necro. Necros have rather large health pools as it is, and in addition have Death Shroud (which can act as an emergency second health pool). In addition, with minions, you can make a very tanky build that still does reasonable damage through sheer numbers. 
---
I'd probably suggest you stay away from thief, at least for a very beginning player. They're not quite as beginner-unfriendly as Elementalist (who are basically the epitome of Glass Cannon, with high damage but very low health), but they're still more about movement and positioning: stuff that a new player might not immediately know.
---
Ranger is also a decent starter class, since you get a pretty useful Friend to help you by tanking some of the damage.
---
The only kmown Sylvari who does not originate from the Pale Tree.
---
The newbie zones are all level 1-15, so at level 13 you can safely explore wherever you like in them.  Level 15 foes will be hard for you but not a death sentence.  To your west is the zone Metrica Province, another newbie zone for the Asura, so you can head there and fully explore it as well.  The zones to your north, Brisban Wildlands and Kessex Hills, are both level 15-25 zones, so you won't want to go there right away, but you can soon once you gain a few levels to face tougher challenges.
---
One other thing to note, the game has level scaling.  If you go to an area that's lower level than you are, your level will be scaled down to match it so that it's not a pushover for you.  This allows you to continue to earn good XP and loot by playing in places that are below your level, if you so desire.  If you introduce a friend to the game when you're level 20 and he starts out at level 2, you can still party with him and play alongside him without massively outclassing him and making him feel useless!
---
And to answer your question about dying, all that means is that you pick a waypoint to return to and you respawn there with one piece of armour damaged.  Damaged armour is no big deal, find an NPC with a Repair symbol over their head (available in most settlements) and talk to them to get your armour repaired for free.  If you wind up being defeated often enough that all your armour is damaged, the next defeat will 'break' a piece of armour.  This doesn't permanently destroy it, but it will stop giving you its stats until you go to see a Repair NPC, so at that point you really should head off to get it fixed.
---
Like 2/3 of the crafting cost is just the ghost peppers and butter anyway.
---
It seems people like daybroker would actually rather have pandering to whatever they want to happen instead of characters behaving realistically and driving their stories organically
---
u tried &lt;3
---
Both of them already have the anti-female thing
---
Is the party search affected by server? Cause I was on when you posted this and saw nowhere near as many as that. No filters on too. Honestly asking btw. Not trying to be rude or anything.
---
It's more than a Google search too :/. That's way over simplify it imo Phoenix. But I do get what you're saying. With a little effort you can find a group but you have to go to a third party for it and once you get a group/community where is the communication? To reiterate what I was saying. I think the two biggest issues are UI/UX and communication on communities' part. Bad UI/UX forces players to look for third party solutions to something that should be in game and designed with simplicity in mind for players. No communication from the community (dead chats, no party search and discord) gives new players the vibe of a dead end when trying to engage with raids.
---
Why do they NEED to be a serious threat still? They were a threat 250 years ago, they were defeated, and now they're not much of a threat anymore. They lost the civil war. The end.
---
This feels like the perfect summary. Well fucking done indeed 👌🏻
---
I got the joke
---
Baseless statement with very little depth to it XD.
---
It actually makes your game run better? Mine sucks
---
Ah the classic no guild wars in guild wars XD . Yeah ... wish there was some guild wars...
---
Even if "that's an absolutely massive amount", does that amount buy cosmetic Gemstore items with real cash, or instead earn enough gold for gold-to-gem conversion? If they do not pay, do they generate enough positive publicity to attract new paying players, or do they only exist in their own closed bubbles, occasionally peaking out to spread how unsatisfactory their experience is and and showing how segregated the overall game community is?
---
Wtf this is too easy
---
They tried that already, in Guild Wars: Eye of the North.  It didn't work out well for them.
---
Spoiler: The Destroyers ate them.
---
Im not that fit in english but i want to understand whats going on.
---
What are these primers?
---
the connection to me is the idea that the new maps we get wont fit into the spaces on the west side of the map in the maguuma jungle, so im afraid the style of content we are getting now will prevent us from ever revisiting stories like his because of the location and small settings between all the maps we do have, unless something happens like their pale tree did something special or created some deus ex thing while no one was looking and the the current events team lets us head back for an instance here and there of collecting items or something
---
Well let’s talk lore then. If you paid attention to CoF. We actually pretty much got rid of the flame legion all together in that dungeon. Yeah sure some (lore wise) may wander around but again, from a lore point of view, we exterminated them. The flame legion is finito. I’m sorry if i tried to look at it reasonably, I didn’t know you didn’t actually pay attention to what happened at the CoF. What happened we killed them, the flame legion arc is done. The nightmare court story is DONE. Just because the mobs still exist in the open world doesn’t mean the story is not concluded. Go to the jungle. The mordrem there seem to still be loyal to Mordremoth, no? It’s hard not to look from the gameplay perspective because that’s a reasonable thing. You want lore. I get it. Do you want all the flame legion mobs/nightmare court mobs/mordremoth minions/zhaitans minions (with them they atleast had some explenation) to be hard deleted from the game because “hurr my immerion”. Because we have the story, we have the lore, and it’s all concluded. You bot paying attention, is on you.

What about people, who just don't have the time to put into the game? Shouldn't they also be able to do it? I guess I get what your are saying. Games are really trivialize a lot so Noone gets left behind, but that's why I'm a fan of the multiple difficulty route
---
What do you mean? Confused on what you're end game is XD.

So basically is Anet sleeping on their money from the gemstore and ignore wvw, raids and pvp? What can we do?

Seems like you don't get it.

I would very much so like to stack 2 at a time just to get those 1-5 minutes some use

Hey, fuck you too.

true but i was talking to and about tekkit's expression of classic, not more than that.
---
LFG is split EU/NA. I've never seen less than 3 groups on LFG at a time, and that was in off hours late week during the abysmally long break between W5 and 6.
---
If youre in a discord or guild, there's always commnication if youre in a good one. Otherwise its easy to take initiative and start it. Even without 3rd party tools its very easy to make your own group though. Just start it and itll fill in no time. Its how most people started in the beginning, including me.
---
Who's Link? Isn't the green one Zelda?
---
I just got the game installed and all of my Reaper gear is Valkyire, is that still good for general use?
---
Your in game graphic settings are set to lowest possible (improving performance) and programs like reshade pretty them up elsewhere (I've never really delved into how/where tbh).  
---
My understanding is that reshade does its work on the GPU, where GW2, and many other games, lean heavily on the CPU for graphics while the CPU is also busy dealing with the rest of the game too.
---
Yep. Its so weird that they make a raidwing of all things temporary, especially an introductory one like that.
---
&gt; It is just not possible...
---
I put this more on anet. Anet is not great when it comes to adding depth to thier lore in GW2. Most things are surface level overviews and recaps, when it comes to making complex characters as a hero or villain they struggle greatly. They are okay with the heroes sometimes but the villains get the short end of the stick and become shallow characters reduced to tropes the get quickly swept aside, prime example is Joko.
---
Not having alts in gw2 is severly gimping yourself and should only be considered if you're only able to play like an hour a week.
---
Thats a weak ass comeback. Maybe try accusing me of being 12 year old for no reason?
---
Exactly. Trying to please everyone with a mode catered to hardcore players pleases nobody. Casuals will always want easier, and once you make it easier its not hardcore content anymore.
---
I still believe there is a chance to implement Malyck. It became a lot less likely with Matt Medina leaving Anet, however, and I don't expect anything. But I would be really, really giddy, if they remembered this story thread. 
---
Not only because it is a loose end. But because HoT fell short as a Sylvari expansion. 
---
HoT was a Mordrem expansion. A thousand things that they could have done with Sylvari were not realized in this expansion, Malyck's tree, his people being one of them. As such, I still see lots of potential in bringing them back. They could tie Malyck into a Living World side arc featuring the Unchained Mordrem. That same arc could see some new Sylvari cultural development and, at long last, a satisfying exploration of Dream and Nightmare. Malyck could have died fighting the Mordrem, which would explain why he never came to us with the army he promised. We could stumble upon a second grove where his memorial greets us and we get an exclusive dialogue option if we knew Malyck via PS. 
---
However, I do not believe any of that will be tapped into anytime soon. Norn and Charr are most likely to get the spotlight next, and that is as it should be. Norn, in particular. 
---
But one day, if we are really, really lucky,
---
Anet will remember the untapped potential of the Sylvari race. And then, they might remember Malyck, too.
---
I love you Noxxi

Some charr commander from the flame legion might rise up and try to redeem it.  The legion arises a new from their ashes and claims their rightful place as one of the high legions. They don't need to be enemies forever.
---
Excluding raids and fractals. You guys know what I mean! More maps, events, worldbosses.
---
the whole Prophecies campaign constantly jerks off to the hero being the chosen savior of Tyria.
---
At least in GW2 the commander gets questioned many times about their acts and how them affect everyone else involved, from[ a Pact member who lost their loved one](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Pact_Medic_Ceera) due to our actions, to Palawa Fucking Joko telling us that we're idiots for killing two dragons without knowing that doing so would doom Tyria (considering that we didn't know about Aurene being able to replacing them yet).
---
Did we play the same games?
---
Mesmer. Obviously. Mesmers can do anything.
---
10% increase != + 10% of user base
---
Im miss the days of SBI wvw, now we are relegated to hanging on to another server
---
I agree and disagree :D. I think Raids should be hard as fucking hell, rewarding, introduce new mechanics, introduce new maps, introduce new lore and offer hard to obtain skill based non-gold base rewards for each Raid. But I believe with the devs/company putting time/money into making all that content should show case it to all player types/levels. In short, get your money's worth for players and company. Making an easy mode, normal mode and challenge mode allows for them utilize assets for all players and for all players to get more content. Mind that there should be some chance of failure and should not be like the Story Mode. La sigh Story Mode :/ . Any who, it should be a low enough skill level where the majority of the player community should be able to access the content (\*but still have a chance of failing\*) and get an emersion experience in the world of tyria.
---
Apart from the fact that it completely changes story of the Sylvari, no reason at all. /s
---
What would alliances be then?
---
Exactly, the whole Balthazar reveal was an insane disappointment.
---
Imagine if we had dealt with a return of the mursaat scenario, with Lazarus pulling the strings of all Tyrian nations through lies and deceit. A new savior god to replace the long gone human gods. What would you do if you were the last living member of your race?
---
Instead we got an angry old dude with fire who shat over all his followers and didn't give a damn in a quest for ultimate power.
---
Which doesn't mean Balthazar couldn't have been interesting on his own way too, but the whole "Lazarus disguise" plot was an absolute disgrace.
---
Honestly though, you can’t make most of the fights any easier without removing the mechanics, because they are the only “challenging” part—there’s nothing even close to like a real dps check or sustain hurdle or whatever. 
---
If you remove the mechanics, there’s nothing to learn.  
---
You can see this principle in action on the different levels of the Shattered Observatory fractal.
---
yeah for some reason, gw2 feels like it's in a very weird limbo. so much emphasis is put on fashion yet there's not nearly enough quality armour pieces or skins available to fill that niche. there would probably be less infusion, aura &amp; particle stackers around wanting to set themselves apart from the crowd. As it stands we just have people going extremely bright and eye catching + embiggening tonic.
---
what guardian needs is focus main-hand so we can introduce fist weapons!! give us a brawler!!
---
The screaming part is 100% based on real events.
---
And how did it work out for you? Do you feel older and wiser?
---
Reducing damage makes ignoring mechanics the optimal strategy, see SO and NM CM vs their normal modes. Wipes are a part of challenging content, without wiping you barely learn since the mechanics are not worth avoiding anyway.
---
They're basically an organization that recruits members who feel disenfranchised or are looking for revenge.  This particular one happened to be in charge of the Charr legions during their most successful conquests against the humans, and similarly to irl groups who use former glory to prop up their image for perspective recruits, they point to the power of their magics and dreams of using them to once again begin their old wars anew.  
---
They don't generally recruit forward thinkers, those who join and are very intelligent generally only seek power over others.  However, a direction in life and the feeling of being wanted will cause groups like this to never completely fade out.  
---
The IRL organizations that this faction's design takes queues from do sometimes fall completely but they're based on a subset of the population that will ALWAYS exist.  If there is no local group, one will be formed.  
---
In the same way, if the flame legion is crushed from existance, another will form that won't be markedly different.
---
The extra loot spawns at about the 1 min (remaining) mark.  If you wham yourself to clip into the meteor, you can gather while mining.  You'll notice you get a second chance with about 1 min left.
---
*Unless they've patched it*, allowing it to fail is what seems to cause the next meteor to bug in a given ip.  So it's probably not worth it even if the extra reward is real.
---
Overall, the ideal is to let it get below about 1 min and then kill.  You should get the same reward and you also won't miss a round due to a bugged meteor.
---
The GW2 story is split up into sets of missions every 10 levels and also 3 larger acts. The first act consisting of the story from levels 10, 20, and 30 deals with your race and the options you picked in character creation. For your human character your story will take you to zones in and around Divinity's reach the human home city. You can explore whatever zones you want but you will need to come back to the story marked areas to do the story instances. 
---
Levels 40, 50, and 60 make up act 2 where characters decide to join one of 3 orders and help out a tribal race. If both of you pick the same order and want the same choices you can do that, otherwise again you can keep it separate or replay to pick other options. The tribal race you pick is one of 3 options based on your race but there is lots of overlap in choices since you always pick from 3/5 of the options.
---
Levels 70 and 80 make up the final act of the personal story where it converges into one story line with just branching choices in the missions.
---
i cant even get 8, i cant seem to control where i land and often get stuck inside walls and have to wait out the timer to try again.
---
I severely dislike alts too, so I'd just pick what you enjoy most. I've personally got one char of each class geared up and ready to fill for raids, but only really play my elementalist unless it's necessary to switch.
---
Oh damn. I have the 550 gw1 so I'm even further from you than I thought hahaha

Just treat the 1- 30 racial storylines as non-canon.

A+
---
Pretty much normal mode in all cases. A lot of non CM encounters already feel incomplete in all cases. Normal can be rebranded easy.
---
I feel like ArenaNet will finally listen and give us some fucking content.
---
We have done God's work.
---
&gt; or instead earn enough gold for gold-to-gem conversion
---
Buying gems with gold drives up the gold/gem rate. Somebody is still out there buying gems with real money.
---
That is really cool
---
Ahh, the old people with different opinions = elitist argument people love in this subreddit. There are enough legitimate reasons against difficulty modes, with development time being a huge one.
---
Living world seasons and expansions both fall under the DLC umbrella.
---
You're asking for an expansion.
---
This game is very alt friendly, why limit yourself??
---
Necro.
---
Same boat here. I wish I took your advice seriously
---
Okay i'm on it.
---
Maybe this is because I'm newer to raids (been mostly consistently raiding for a few months now with a static that makes up most of the group 7/8) but I find the difficulty pretty on point, we wipe when stupid mistakes are made and when everyone is doing well we succeed, perhaps this is just me or is this perhaps a problem with expectations?
---
Guild Wars 2 has always had it's own way of doing certain content and I don't think any of it, even raids, was truly made for the kind of people who raided hardcore stuff in WoW or other MMO's. I don't think raids need that to survive either, as it's lasted this long and seems pretty alive and well, I'd be pretty happy for the friendlier, not top tier but alright groups that exist to be the majority of those raiding as opposed to those coming from other games with ludicrous expectations from a game that's never catered to the kind of content they want.
---
They're called Raids but it doesn't make them the exact same as raids from other MMO's, It's ANet and GW2's take on it which, based on the history of the games core design principles, will be more accessible - I think it's stupid to call them 'really easy' as is and this hyperbolic statement floating around that any group can get boss kills is just so amazingly wrong, yeah okay you don't need to of studied the boss like it was a second job to you to understand it and get a kill (if you and your team play well) but it takes SOME effort to learn a boss, especially from scratch and the fact that the entire community is running top tier speed running builds from the best lads in the game... I mean, what do you expect?
---
Game that is far more accommodating + top tier min maxing and yet everyone is surprised that they finish this stuff quick - why? How about challenging yourself and creating your own comp's for more interesting or versatile fights... or hell how about using the class you enjoy from other game modes and trying to get it to a point that it's hitting reasonable DPS/Heals/Buffs whatever it is - Go full SC and go for runs with lower group sizes, what other MMO is it possible to go for four man runs in ten man raids when the content is still at the stat cap? Not many I imagine, the challenge is there for those that actually, really care about challenging themselves rather than taking the path of least resistance. (this is all of course if you have normally finished and learnt these fights and are getting bored of the usual runs)
---
I hate the idea of turning people away from Guild Wars 2 but I have to say that you are asking for the wrong thing from ArenaNet here, GW2 just isn't that kind of game, it never has been. You'll have more fun (presumably) in WoW or something else that apes that raid format.
---
12:00
---
LOL epic xD
---
Chrono is still meta in raids. Usually a raid group is 2 chronos (one of which is the tank depending on the encounter) a druid, a second healer, and 6 dps. Obviously there are exceptions to this
---
This is pretty incredible, and filled with amazing advice. The thing about going into a slide mid-drift to conserve speed? huh.
---

I think that if we just had some random Mordrem that we could recognize as Malyck it would have been enough. We wouldn't have had some cool plot twist or more story content, but letting Malyck just be a foreshadowing of the Sylvari being dragon minions and hence not exclusive to the Pale Tree in the Grove could be nice enough.
---
And they never talked about a release date or anything that way. They only talked about things they planed to do (-&gt; in the future). 
---
The whole thing is just the result of people screaming for informations and a company who gave anything just to make those people stop crying. 
---
I mean, you could blame Anet for giving out this informations too early. You could also blame those people who demand any kind of information. Both won't be wrong, but to blame only one party would be.
---
I feel like you completely forgot how Eir died and that whole arc with the Faolin vinetooth in HoT. We got to see that the NC pursued the exploration of their free will in contrast of the "Dream" and the concept of the dream explored in greater detail and importance to the sylvari in mass scale.
---
How much more do you expect a fraction to be involved when they had their story arc more or less completed in a vanilla dungeon already? It's like complaining we don't have details on what happened with Zhaitan's minions aside from learning they're still around after the fact and the remaining dragons can now raise the dead.
---
Who?
---
What's the best map for farming Volatile Magic not counting Dragonfall and not counting the free-floating VM balls (since that's got a cap)?
---
I still don't like asuras. But Taimi is the exception.
---
DLC -&gt; Download Content. LS definitely *are* DLCs. Only difference from HoT and PoF is that they are for free (as long as they are active).
---
you
---
I'm not trying to come off as combative, but have you put in the time to try and start learning raids? There are a couple huge training discords that can help you get started
---
A year and a half... They made PoF in less than 2 years, we are aproaching that time. Can you really compare alliances to a full expansion?
---
Vanilla story is dead, accept it.
---
Malyck, the Commander's sister, the blue orb, the de-corrupted chicken. The core story had more lore than all living world updates combined, and nothing has been picked up and expanded on. Anet started an entirely new lore branch with season 1 and never looked back.
---
whatever you feel is, there won't be a new Expancion for as long time. Low budget and low population has confirmed a way too negative slope on the finantial area of Anet. Unless E3 meetings resulted in new invetors, we might settle for 2-3 LW seasons for now and hope the game doens't stall from there.
---
Hardly a trick when it is literally a choice to experience different starting stories and to have some different outcomes to those stories - ever since Mass Effect 3 I've hated this ludicrous notion some people seem to have that somehow EVERYTHING a person has ever done leads into everything else they'll ever do and is of critical importance later down the road all the time.
---
There isn't a single game in existence that has taken this amount of races with a bunch of added story choices on top of each of those and had every single one of those stories lead into something massive or have huge significance later on, beyond it being completely unreasonable when you consider how complicated it would all become, it would also always be very subjective as to how satisfying the conclusion of those stories would be.
---
People are truly spoiled these days when it comes to story telling and fail to just enjoy the story they're experiencing in the moment, you are correct that the racial stories are mostly irrelevant to the main story of Guild Wars 2 when looking at the bigger picture, but you failed to realize that you're playing a video game for entertainment and having a story that evolves and lets you make decisions, minor or not, along the way is fun to an extent and lets you become at least a little more engaged, not to mention having a few interesting little stories leading into and around the main story leaves your character with a little more history.
---
I appreciate you buying all my dragon coffers. Thanks dude.
---
expansion funds the game. wvw doesn't.
---
I think the original topic and WvW suffer from the same core issue: small return on investment.  New raids truly appeal to 10%, or less, of the playerbase while WvW improvements hit even less than that.  Increased work on living world episodes, expansions, or fractals affects Anet's bottom line far more significantly.  In fact, with this being a PvE driven community and game, raids affect things so much more than WvW - by providing a service to the top echelon of players who also tend to run websites, streams, and YouTube channels - that I think we can all see why WvW has been left out in the cold for so very long.
---
At the end of the day Anet simply made their game way too broad to keep up with all of it.  They would have been better served to pick one or two areas and excel in them rather than try to be all things to all people back in 2012.
---
What i want are more difficulty in raid without difficulty mod, with this even casual player can enjoy raid ... not clearing them per say.
---
the issu with your casualist bullshit is that : why would i bother to do the raid more than once if everyone can do them willy nilly without putting in any effort, if you want something like that go play an afk/clicker game, that's gonna be the same
---
I think about people who can't play a lot, i can't play a lot anymore ;(
---
But you also need to think of the bigger picture : if all the player can do raids without putting in any efforts, why do raid at all? you can do them once for the story, twice for the achievment, then goodbye! (like story mod actualy, but in group)
---
What give value to raid is that not all people can do them
---
The easy solution is to transfer to another server
---
i wanted to bring some of my friends in to GW2 to try the game and i hoped we'd run around WvW together too, but since they are gonna use F2P accounts rn they are waiting for Piken to hopefully open up. meanwhile on reset only one border had a queue :T
---
Definitely, unfortunately we have none of that.

It's ok to fail sometimes. Some days it won't work the way you wanted. It's fine to fail. TaCo is awesome. use it if you wish.  but take the challenges as they are for a moment. fail. if you succede you will feel way better than using someone's effort. if you are taking too mucjn time, go for a helping hand with TaCo. mount glide and all .it's fine. but yake the challenge.  first. Bew better.  ....or don't call yourself a Commander.
---
It's hilarious how bad you are at comprehension. Twice in this thread you've misunderstood something and made a fool of yourself.
---
Keep going.
---
Player expecting to be able to do all the content without putting in any effort at all is what really tic me off, i stoped raiding with my guid because some of us were training but i was toping the dps by 10k difference .... so that was a little bit unerving
---
I feel that that's a bit different. That's obviously something that the players should know is wrong. The Aquatic Runes farm didn't necessarily feel wrong. It just felt OP.
---
Wow! That's quality armor!
---
so you just want the story? go watch a youtube video
---
I died at the timegate part, the scream was perfectly timed
---
To add: it's also unclear if the gods knew about the dragons at the start (they did build a city over Zhaitan's magical nexus.
---
On Abaddon: his was not just running around spreading magic to everyone. It was that people had access to too much magic, the gods chose to split the Bloodstone to fix this, and he disagreed. This happened about 10,000 years after the previous Elder Dragon rise and it was *for this reason* that he fought the other gods and lost.

Ok, it's done, but it may take several hours for the change to fully propagate out.

[Blue Orb!](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Blue_Orb)

It's that thing that is part of the Commander's fear/failure plotline in the original campaign's story. It resolves at the Battle for Fort Trinity when a Risen Mesmer infiltrates the fort and disarms the orb.

And that additional devtime, plus the dev time of more raids, will be justified if they get more people to engage with the content. Have people never played an MMO with an actual endgame? Endgame progression should not be exclusive nor overly difficult. That way you get the most people in your game to engage with it. You then create prestigious achievements and hard modes for raids that carry the actual meaning for the community. No one in WoW cares how many times you've cleared a raid boss or how many drops you have as KP, they care about the Cutting Edge and Ahead of the Curve achievements, because *thats* what should be prestigious, difficult goals and achievements. Having *ALL* the endgame PvE content be for a minute amount of players is idiotic. 
---
Every MMO with raids has difficulty tiers, WoW has LFR, Normal, Heroic, and Mythic. FFXIV has regular and Savage raids. The lesser difficulties don't mean that the higher ones are less valid, they just mean that Blizz and Squeenix can allot devs to the mode because a lot of people play it.
---
Give it to Gwen, she'd appreciate it.
---
Very under appreciated comment - I'm an alt junkie, I switch build / class / gear more often than I change my underwear (So at least twice a weak), but I don't expect others to do the same (Not talking about underwear, just for clarification xD).
---
But having them geared (At least on exotic), skilled and kinda knowing how to play them in general is always good, bc it gives you the option to switch if it's really needed (Or if the one class that you have gets nerfed into the ground and farther until it ends up in Australia).
---
y'know i figured i was wrong as soon as i commented but i did it anyways
---
Thanks, i have to say not every strategy in this video was made by me, my friend and fellow [RACE]er shadowincision helped alot with optimizing the track, and most of it is based on our knowledge of beetle racing that we gained by racing together in the past 6 months.

This is awesome :D
---
OTOH this isn't the first time they've done this. They announced that a method of making precursors for legendaries was in the works back in [July 2013](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/news/looking-ahead-guild-wars-2-in-2013/). And I just want to point out that this was within the first year that GW2 was released, since it released in September 2012. (Well, end of August but September set's the expectation a bit better here). That didn't end up happening until over 2 years later when Heart of Thorns came out in October 2015.
---
That's for something the entire player base was screaming about and it *still* took over 2 years from the time it was announced. GL WvW players, I hope you get your alliances but don't lose sleep over it.
---
&gt; It's like complaining we don't have details on what happened with Zhaitan's minions aside from learning they're still around after the fact and the remaining dragons can now raise the dead.
---
But we do. There was an entire LS3 episode dedicated specifically to exploring a zone where that was the main issue, and helping mop up the remnants of the corruption and see what was happening with the surviving Risen.
---
&gt; We got to see that the NC pursued the exploration of their free will in contrast of the "Dream" and the concept of the dream explored in greater detail and importance to the sylvari in mass scale.
---
That... was about four lines in one mission at the start of content that's now two expansions old. We have no idea what the Court are doing now, how their view of the world and the Tree's sylvari has changed since Mordremoth's death, and how Faolain's death and presumably replacement has affected their faction. There's a lot of potential with the Nightmare Court to undergo actual character development due to the enormous impact most societies will tend to undergo if their effective creator deity comes back to enslave them and then gets stabbed in the face - hell, they might even sympathise with Balthazar's followers, having been through a similar experience but without the expectation of there being a positive side to it.
---
Wouldn't be surprised if that was once again a case of multi instancing. Regardless, collection items that can be gathered infinite number of times with vendor value are always problematic.
---
I doubt even BG should really be full based on what constituted full and very high even  a year ago. Anet seem to make the highest pop server on each megaserver full no matter what then scale other server populations based on their populations relative to that. Thus if say BGs pop is continuously decreasing then what constitutes full is always decreasing. This is self defeating and only serves to drive down the overall WvW population.
---
Party and squad member names are ALWAYS shown. Annoying me really in raids.
---
Anet uses play hours as metric for wvw population. One dedicated no-lifer playing 14 hours in wvw every day can rake in as much playtime as seven primetime only players. If your server has a lot of them it may seem that you have a low population but in reality you have high play hours.
---
Technology isn't there yet.
---
I can confirm.

AFAIK That's now how it's measured.

IIRC you are either "active" or not based on X hours played in a month.

Lol yeah I keep making the same joke and getting the same downvotes 😂

Interesting, thanks for the feedback!

Duca is one of our important commanders (and friends). We don't want him or his guild to leave us!

if you zoom in it’s actually really detailed. probably some the art style
---
I hope it’s better not be like what I post ( elder gods created tyria blah blah blah) or the story origin would be much like the The elder scroll.

You've already tried [repairing the game](https://help.guildwars2.com/hc/en-us/articles/201863008-Repairing-the-Game-Client)?

That is the whole appeal of raids. You want content called raids that are what raids have never been in any game.
---
Someone else already asked you why you'd need map completion on each character, so I'll follow that up by likewise asking why you need story completion on each character.  By using the Portal Scrolls available from vendors in Living Story maps, you can get access to those maps with any character without needing to do the story to do so.  Given that, there should be no reason to need to do the story on more than one character unless you really want the rewards it gives (some parts give things like Black Lion Keys, after all).

I tried everything, reinstalling the game, repairing, port forwarding and many other things i'm just wondering if it's really my internet cause i feel like that's non sense.

Uhm...

Two years ago, I would have said HELL NO to varying difficulties.  I would have said a lot of the same things people here have said, largely that they're not really 'hard' to begin with.  
---
Now I'm very much in favor of it, largely because people need to see how fun raid content is in this game.  While largely simplistic, its far more engaging for me than most other games on the market, including FFXIV which everyone shits themselves over the raiding.  Id like to see an easy, a 'regular' and CM's being repeatable and with more mechanics added to them.

The problem then becomes how do you make them rewarding.  There's absolutely no way in hell an 'easy mode' should drop LI or Ascended gear.  Do you still give tokens?  Put a cap on easy mode tokens a week?  What do you do there?  Would players actually play it if they werent getting the gold payout or drops of normal raids?  I'd dare venture a guess of no.  In fact, I bet that would be one of the first complaints that pops up on this reddit, 'theres not enough rewards in easy mode'.  The incentive in easy mode should be getting better to do normal mode, but I can assure you people would want to bypass 'normal' as simply a means of easily acquiring raid specific things.

For no particular reason, this reminds me of a time in gw1 when someone tried to pay for a Droks run with icy lodestones.

That nightcap...

Yah I did, and those thinking are of the extend of the known lore in the “time line” wiki we know.
