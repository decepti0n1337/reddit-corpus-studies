Why do people say this. They are in on weekends. I've received responses to customer service on weekends.

That would have been awesome.

It’s not over. I can’t wait to be aurene’s minion!

---
I haven't touched fractals in a while, have been moving some alts through the HoT maps. I was actually thinking of giving warrior a try, but then I started thinking that I hadn't seen one in a while.
---
Warrior isn’t a bad profession for any PvE related content. Guardians are also helpful. Each has good elite specializations too
---
Alacrity Renegade, Quickness Firebrand, Support Druid, Boon Chrono.
---

---
Should all be relatively meta, and wanted because they're the support classes rather than DPS.
---
Literally any class can solo PoF HPs now since they were made a lot easier than HoT, so it doesn't matter which you pick. Anyone will be able to grab the HPs by themselves.
---
yes
---
not shiny enough!
---
Yeah, it just seems like they added way more Charr lands than they needed to when PoF launched. They didnt't need to add so much to accommodate Elona, so I am almost positive they intend to use it in the near future.
---
[removed]
---
Sounds Legit.
---
It depends a bit on whether you have access to elite specializations or not (and which ones), but generally-speaking I'd say that you probably shouldn't run that stat set if you're looking to do endgame PVE content.
---
Heal druid is absolutely useful in fractals and raids (though no longer the only option), but the meta gear for that is power-based (Harriers). And while you *can* play a condi-based druid in some raids, it's not really a dedicated heal druid -- it uses Viper's and is generally used as a second druid/off-heal with okay damage. I have personally never run into anyone trying to play condi heal druid in fractals, but that's probably because you'd likely have a really difficult time finding a fractal group with such a build. Fractals don't really lend themselves well to condi damage, and I'm not sure a condi/heal hybrid druid would be particularly useful at all.
---
Condi soulbeast is certainly viable for raids that require condi damage, and of course power soulbeast is also viable. There's not really any such thing as heal soulbeast, though (I mean, I suppose there could be, but if you're looking to actually get into groups/raids, they almost certainly won't take you). Power soulbeast does well in fractals, too. I don't generally have trouble getting into a fractal or raid group with a power soulbeast (though personally I find condi soulbeast more fun to play, I have never tried to bring mine to a fractal).
---
If you don't have access to either of the elite specs (through the expansions) and are just playing base ranger, then you're going to have a very hard time finding a raid or T4 fractal group even with optimal gear, and will probably be instakicked for wearing condi/heal/precision. 
---
If you just want to do open world, run whatever you want! But honestly I think that particular set would be inefficient in open world, too. If you enjoy it though, that's totally up to you!
---
Can anyone take some pictures of the armor sets? Cant view Twitter at work
---
so, in any context, there isnt a way that i could perform well as a dps with secondary healing using a longbow in endgame content? just making sure im understanding. if thats the case i guess i will scrap the idea.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
so youre saying power soulbeast is not a bad build as if thats an alternative, what is a normal soulbeast build?   
---
id prefer to play with a longbow. im willing to play any role or any playstyle, as long as i get to use that weapon. whatever is most beneficial to people.
---
based on your input, im giving up on it, and i am going to work towards being a power soulbeast, most likely. thanks a lot for your help.
---
Necessary is a funny word. You can play the entire original game without them. When you run out of content there, the expansions are a no brainer.
---
But having mounts and gliding, while not necessary for the core game areas, are definitely something that improves the game immensely at least for me. 
---
I don't personally like having zones that are locked off to me, or a character class for that matter. Necessary no. Would they improve the game for you dramatically? Most likely.
---
Not arguing with the argument; this is what I saw myself, but not finding gear is such a strange reason not to run an optimal strat.  The winning team's herald for example:
---
http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/?vlAQNAscin3gmNSuQzJRboNlsP0oS4I6UJ4ENskFNFqdABoB2B8gPctJTJLA-jBSBQB9VfgZVCml9HAlKFhV53fVXRfPBAAcKAIFgfzsA-e
---
Could be built with diviner gear, exotic magi, and replace harrier with exotic giver trinkets.  I only mention this as I always found it limiting to see people only run what they have ascended in terms of stat combinations on support builds; opening up to exotics gives you a lot of flexibility with minimal loss in effectiveness.
---
This. Everytime I'm disappointed they go the way of the spike edgelord or the repetitive scale patterns. Basic is best.
---
I knew ANet was BS us! T\_T
---
You can take mortar kit and spam some skills before the fight. Skill 3 is very useful even if it gets reflected back to you since you can convert chill to alacrity. Skill 2 is great for controlling downs and 4 for cleanses+blinds. 5 works as a nice heal and cleanse as well.
---
I agree as an artist it's an annoying consequence that art gets copied and stolen because of the fact that in today's world artists have to make a living, but...
---
  
---
&gt;"Theft/shameless copying is never a compliment"
---
I wholeheartedly disagree. For me personally, my art is not about making money or becoming famous. It's about sharing something cool or beautiful or creepy with the world.
---
I would take it as a mild compliment if someone thought my work was cool enough to copy, even if I was annoyed that they didn't give me credit. Different strokes for different folk, I guess.

---
Not sure why you're getting downvoted; I for one dislike the need to add spiky stuff all over.. it kinda screams unimaginative/repetitive.
---
&gt; So , misunderstanding, or feature intended but not implemented , or it's bugged. 
---
Maybe you need to be on the final tier of all the masteries for this to happen to the xp will "spill over" into shard making and not the next mastery level.  i.e. being stalled on the 3rd step of gliding might be different than being stalled on the final step with all other HoT masteries being trained up.    
---
If I were in that situation, I would focus on getting mastery points as that is the real goal, and this discussion is just a diversion.
---
To be completely fair, "design" does not mean "create." Architects "design" houses made of separate architectural methods that they definitely did not create. Every gothic building is "copying" certain design elements.
---
It's very common for tattoo artists to use other's work, as in the end they are beholden to the desires of the client. If a client brings in a piece they found online a tattoo artist usually "designs" a tattoo that incorporates the pre-existing piece into a tattoo that fits better on the client.
---
Edit: not that I'm defending this artist. Their design sense is absolutely awful imo
---
Same time for when the patch comes out? I was a little shocked when I didn’t get my war eternal supply drop for week 4.
---
If it's any consolation, [Ranger](https://metabattle.com/wiki/Ranger) Longbow is a good weapon for PvP, WvW, and Open World - just not for fractals/dungeon/raids.
---
Shortbow is a good condition damage DPS weapon if you prefer that.
---
It was more a matter of needing the time to work everything out and assemble the pieces. I had a Herald build ready to go that would have gotten the job done, but we never had an opportunity to put it into practice since we had limited overall time. We basically only ended up having two nights to pull on this. (Or is that Friday/Saturday blurring together and then the next Friday as the second "night"? Either way, we had lmited time.)
---
The first night was focused on getting people used to their roles and just scraping together any kill. This honestly took a really long time just for the first near-wipe kill since some people were playing classes they had never played before. We were also still gathering data about whether or not our boon theory would work out in practice and which classes should be running which builds. (There was some debate for Thief and Mesmer on power vs condi.) Much of this time was spent with a dedicated kiter off on the side of the platform since there were so many other variables we were sorting out.
---
The second night was focused on refining what we had into a semi-respectable time (not last!). Much of this time was spent ironing out details for agony and kiting, since we knew we had to get rid of the dedicated kiter in the corner. This isn't specific to the odd composition strats, but our guild doesn't typically do speedruns so there was a lot of stuff to work out. We pulled the time down to sub-3 minutes which we were honestly really happy about considering where we started and how much work (both practice and theory) we had to put in to get there.
---
After this, we sat down and basically figured that we'd need to go all-in on the Herald if we wanted to meaningfully improve the time. I went and got the gear together over the course of the next week, but there was no third night since schedules can be hard to align and we had to cut out a lot of other raiders in the guild to do this stuff. We want to continue investing into our raiders long-term so we will have more people able to do fun stuff like this in the future, and that meant not spending all our time on just the competition.
---
We aren't a hardcore raiding guild, and while we do have some really good vets that came out of the woodwork for this, they're the exception rather than the rule. It's entirely reasonable that a more experienced guild would have started where we ended after our second night, and I have a lot of respect for people with that experience. For example, we typically use an edge-of-platform kiter for our weekly clears, and we didn't even know that you could start the fight on the platform until doing research between our first and second nights!
---
I don't want to sound like I'm complaining because I'm not. When I say we didn't have the gear, I mean we didn't have the gear *on hand* to further optimize in the moment, and we didn't have infinite nights to restructure and try again. This event was awesome, and we are already discussing the new Deimos challenge on our Discord channel.
---
It's not bugged at all and works perfectly fine, getting daily spirit shards.
---
The thing is you have to have completed all "open" masteries (Tyria, Hot or PoF). After completed them, you will start earning spirit shards.
---
12pm as Anet is located in the West Coast
---
Generally you're right, you get way less bags for being a healer as opposed to DPS. The trade off is that in large scale fights in wvw, the team with the more healers is going to win, and thus overall, get more bags.
---
So in conclusion, being a DPS on a team with no healers will cause you to get wiped constantly and you will have no bags. Being a Healer will hopefully cause you to win more fights and that way you will get some bags. Being a DPS on a team with a lot of healers will cause you to win fights, and at the same time tag a lot of kills, so that will net you the most bags.
---
I'm assuming you're on EU, right?
---
They seem to be sending out the supply drops on Tuesdays based on their time, which is in NA. So, check again around when the patch drops and it should probably be there, maybe a little later

Just FYI, Instagram had a big data leak that happened roughly at the same time of the whole kung fu thing. If someone is to blame it's probably Facebook/Instagram.

---
Spellbreaker for open world is  the most solid option for warrior, while berserker is also really good after the rework it's a little more glassy.
---
For spellbreaker take Greatsword, Axe/Axe.
---
Strength 3/2/2
---
Discipline 2/3/1
---
Spellbreaker 1/2/3
---
Start off by using Marauder Gear and after you're comfortable with it go for berserker gear. You want rune of Strength or Rune of the Scholar if you get better with the build. Force and Impact sigils on both weapon sets.
---
Healing Signet/Frenzy/For Great Justice/Bulls Charge/Signet of Rage
---
You can switch out bulls charge for any other 'Physical Skill.'
---
The Grandmaster trait 'Might Makes Right' heals you everytime you gain might, you gain might by using a burst skill on an enemy, which tethers them and three of your utility skills give you might. Critical hits have 50% to give might, and 100% chance on Greatsword.
---
Keep in mind this is not the most optimal build for killing things fast, which  is what most veterans go for in open world, however it does higher than moderate damage and the sustain is extremely good.
---

Ok so to add on to what was already said a "bag opener" character is definitely a thing, mainly used for the loot from farming the silverwastes meta. Mostly you'll be opening [champion loot bags](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Champion_loot_bag) and [bags of gear](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Bag_of_Gear). It's fine to open any bags on a lower level character, worst thing that will happen is that you'll just get level 80 gear anyways.
---
Speaking of getting level 80 gear, unidentified gear will always drop at level 80 and open into level 80 gear. There is no point "opening" it on a lower level character so just ID it and then salvage with the right kits.
---
Perhaps not, but the payoff for that whole thing had better be this episode, and it had better be good. I don't think I'll ever forgive ANet for handling him the way they did, but maybe my thinking can be changed. We'll see.
---
Update video drivers to the latest version and then test.
---
If still crashing, then update the BIOS drivers and test again.
---
First I'd suggest making another character and playing the game normally, but if you're against doing that then you can either craft the weapon or buy it on the trading post (can also get it as a rare drop). Dungeons are also a good option for core stats but as a new player you'll have no idea what you're doing. Fractals should be saved for after you get a handle on the game and are geared. I have a [guide here that you might find helpful](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Dak393/New_player_Guide#Start_Here).
---
I don’t know if this is a stupid question but I would love to buy the 50% off promotional complete version of the game, but I don’t know if I should. I am having fun with it, but am not far enough in the free game to truly know what it has to offer. What drew you all in?
---
How much time does it take to level up from Level 1 - 80 ?
---
Oof my Elonian Leather
---
I think this is it, really. The secret is to play with a lot of variety. Reap all the loot. Don’t be tempted to buy anything, and then sell _everything_.
---
Thanks for tour great answers dark, one last question: should i just do the main quests?
---
You should try getting hit by Norn bear form soulbeast for 40k while you are wearing minstrel armor LOL
---
Canada's only [official retailers](https://www.guildwars2.com/en/retailers/#Canada-physical) are Best Buy and EBGames, they should have physical gem cards but that means going out and getting them. You could get them online through something like amazon but then they have to actually mail you the card... If you can figure out why the payment isn't working that's your best bet, the official store only has gems as part of the ultimate edition as far as I'm aware (though they seem to be hiding it right now?)
---
I'd suggest doing the main story as you level, you'll get a new set of story missions every 10 levels (10, 20, 30, etc) so just do them when you get them. They'll give a decent amount of exp as well.
---
Scarlett's minions?
---
An item with 0.00000000001% chance to drop will still have a 0.00000000001% chance to drop no matter how many boxes you open.
---
Got to hang with some cool players, got a torch skin out of it, and sold a bunch of crap I didn't need for few gold. I count it as a good event.
---
That’s correct. For example, the luminous skins from the 6th birthday gift are not in the wardrobe to be previewed.
---
Hi can i check with you if Heart of Thorns is worth it/necessary? I was thinking of getting both the expansion packs at 27usd.
---
imo it's either both or nothing at all, you get to enjoy so much more of the game with extra stuff (gliding in HoT and mounts in PoF)
---
More like the recipe being only available from the PSNA unless you want to pay 450g for it
---
Yep, will probably buy the time gated mats, if i could buy zinn off the tp I would've.
---
TIME's a guild from SG.
---
ah alright. i'll save on the deluxe then.
---
oh so HoT was the one that brought the 2 elite specialisations for each class (ie firebrand)  thank you! are those unlocked at level1?
---
why extra character slot?  
---
premium lounge worth? it is a permanent access with the deluxe right?
---
Dagger main hand is good for the quickness if you run sun and moon style, which is what I use, however the health gain from the critical strikes on offhand dagger is not enough since spellbreaker doesn't have a lot of crit chance without spotter (druid) and banners, without sacrificing power for precision (assassin instead of berserker), plus axe off hand damage is just too strong to drop, axe 5 does a lot a lot of damage.
---
All I can really say is give the in game shop another shot, it sometimes takes time to load but I'm able to purchase gems right now with no issue. Have you also tried with a credit card directly?
---
HoT and PoF each offers one elite specialisation which you can start unlocking from level 80.
---
For example, for the thief, HoT allows you to change into a staff wielding monkey with (seemingly) unlimited dodges. PoF allows you to change into a long range rifle wielding sniper that can (seemingly) perma stealth and pew pew everyone.
---
Extra character slots makes you a more valuable asset in raids/dungeons due to the fact that you can fill multiple roles with different characters. Basically you're able to swap roles if you have the correct characters.
---
That's what I thought till I just started making stuff, small goals and before you know it you get hooked and you're on your way.
---
oops maybe you can link the GM here, that would be helpful for OP, sorry not very involved with the SG community.
---
You have enough dodges. If you run out of dodges, it's because you dodged something unnecessarily. For Captain Crowe, you only dodge the red circle and her cone, the cone is her only fast attack. The winds have a much longer telegraph, giving you tons of time to just walk out of them.
---
Not to mention their draconian drinking laws.
---
I’m sorry. Gw2 is grindy? Gw2 is is not even rng heavy since it loot system is completely casual- ‘everyone gets a bite’. You are barking at a tree that has no cats on it...not even birds. 
---
Have you ever played any other MMO? I’m willing to bet you haven’t. Out of the big 5 MMOs on the market (WoW, FF14, ESO, RS and GW2) Guild wars is probably the least popular because it caters to casuals the most...yet you want to make it even more casual? He reason WoW is in down fall? Because it started catering to casuals.
---
Yet games that are becomming more and more hardcore, FF14 and RS are picking up huge steam, both of which are speculated ro overthrow even the king, WoW.
---
Thanks for the clarification. Lastly, regarding HoT magic find bags, is it best to open it on a lv80 char with magic find as high as possible, a lv50 char or does it make a significant difference.
---
I don't know what people are on about; your view on this seems to be the most logical.
---
One thing that I find odd about gw2 is that it's a game that so much wants to keep things casual, it's all about daily caps and removing the gear grind.
---
Despite all that, the player base seems to will itself back into the grind. I see people in fractals and all anyone wants to do is avoid the mechanics of each fight through as many skips as possible. 
---
You see an event like this world boss event and instead of seeing it as a fun chance to revisit world boss content, you have groups of people trying to get credit for the same boss four times so they get four times the rewards. 
---
Don't get me wrong, I understand that rewards are cool, but it boggles my mind how much people are willing to do tedious things for maximum output in this game of all games, considering its design motif.
---
alright. thank you for the advise. 
---
i'll start looking around
---
No it's 100% ready. The elder wood and ingots are in the (4) enormous share boxes.
---
Hello brother.
---
Few things you can do to increase lootbags:
---
- you should have bulwark gyro, that gives a dome on the “F-skills” that also gives stability. Pop it before a push.
---
- When you go in elixer gun for condi removal, use after 5 and 4 aswell 3. It’s a good tagging skill.
---
- Hammer 5 inside Spellbreaker bubbles is a good tag skill aswell. It’s a stun, so it’s very good for squad aswell to use it inside a spellbreaker bubble.
---
- Same for Supply Crate as for Hammer 5: it’s a CC.
---
This should help a bit. Enjoy WvW!
---
enjoy the game and welcome to gw2 :)
---
Pharus has been my favorite legendary made. second favorite being verdach
---
So for the HoT specific bags (which are one of the few magic find scaling exceptions) they should all(?) give level 75+ gear so no point opening on a lower character. Since they do scale with magic find it is better to open them at higher values but it's not going to matter much especially with low numbers. If you somehow saved up stacks of them then you'd want to go to silverwastes and run a bunch of boosters to hit 800-1000 magic find and open them. Even then though I don't expect it to be worth all that much since it's hard to get a large number of them to make it worthwhile.
---
I stopped playing after I did all of the dragon blood weapons and then 250 of all currencies.
---
Correct. I own one of each legendary. I'll save it for season 7!
---
Doubt.
---
Only first four Gen2 need a collection. ANet has stated that they are moving away from them because it takes way too much development time. 
---
Instead we get gold sinks. Huge gold sinks.
---
Yeah, several times. It was even already saved payment info on my account as it's what I had used to buy the expansions with.

this site is pretty accurate. Maybe the wow numbers are off, but i will not get surprised if they are actually right...

I don't remember off hand but you should check out this link. It is to an Excel file that someone else made and it is extremely helpful. I highly recommend using it. [LINK](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18NNEbyzNtCdOODp2ujuMJAC0YMgGelbEQvIkkyw4_UY/edit?usp=drivesdk)
---
I'm glad I can play pretty much the whole game for free. I mean it may become my main game in the future but right now it's the second one I play
---
if you are super casual, it doesnt matter just go with the one that you like the most.....
---
So of course you shouldn't be comparing yourself to level 80 characters, but in general, make sure your weapons match your build. sword for example is a power weapon, and doesn't get a lot of output from gear that provides condition damage
---
It's normal, Mesmer have a hard time during lvling, but it will be a whole different story once you are 80.
---
For now, i recommand you going Sword/Sword and GS and try to get as many Berserker gear as possible.
---
I think i contributed to the main post as much as you by showing my opinion, all with a single letter. Yours took 9 capital letters for 2 words and a whole sentence afterwards. You need to up your game.
---
Safety bubble 101: it doesn't work in public.
---
When i compare my self i mean in dungeons where are level is scaled some people completely destroy the things in there
---
I only started 3 days ago what does gs mean?
---
Very healthy playerbase, at least in open world content.
---
There is a World Boss Rush event this week. It brought back so many people that even in the maps where it was not actively happening, the lag was a bit noticeable at times when casting skills.
---
PvP, WvW, Raids, Fractals/Dungeons on the other hand have seen better days in terms of popularity (devs not focusing on them as much as they should), but you can still fill groups very quickly specially in prime time.
---
and that's why I use avocado smoothies, basically free
---
I see big groups of players pretty much everywhere when I play, it's always seemed pretty active
---
Papi chulo came thru.
---
Thanks a lot!
---
The mystic forge was described early on as a puzzle, because recipes for stuff in it are nested and discoverable.
---
As for the recipes, Miyani sells a bunch of them for 10g each recipe that tell you which weapon that they are used to craft.
---
So it was just a matter of puzzling it all together to come up with the comprehensive lists.
---
If anyone has additional Alienware code I'd like to have it pls
---
Thats one of the most beautiful pictures gears2gnomes ever created! Well done!
---
Aurora was separate, Coalescence is tied to raids, is it not?
---
Need more slider info dude..
---
For me, it's guardian. I love playing white mage/holy priest types but I'm so accustomed to my ele, I just can't give up swapping between 4 sets on the F keys. 
---
I know a friend that would have played the game more if mesmer effects weren't pink butterflies. He liked the illusion idea but couldn't stomach the lack of choice with the visual effect.
---
Thats why rare items are still rare and worth anything and good that Anet keeps it that way
---
you can play the unlocked stories whenever you have a need or will, but it's 80 lvl content, so you need to be 80 lvl and own Heart of Thorns (to play Season 3) and Path of Fire (to play Season 4). Season 2 is different, because you don't need to have any expansion unlocked, but only pay 200 gems per episode, it's worth it, because Dry Top and the Silverwastes are still very populated and if you are a story nerd, then it also expands the story of Scarlet, builds up the position of rising heroes like Kasmeer and Canach. 
---
It's the information for everybody, perhaps you know it all already. :) 
---
Have fun playing Living World stories, they are amazing!
---
We're talking about speculated trinket to release that will require achievements from all LS4 episodes that is NOT Aurora or Coalescence. A completely NEW trinket.
---
Sorry, I didn't mean rending, I meant Draining. You can life steal enough equal to a heal skill. 
---
The point of absorption isn't to get boons but to steal them from enemies. This considerably lowers their damage output making their pressure much less worrisome.
---
Yes. Getting ascended light armor can be transferred over to Elementalists and Mesmers if you ever become interested in playing those in the future. Plus, once you start doing things like T4 fractals and raids, ascended gear is much easier to get. You can play using your main and feed any gear drops you don’t need to your alts.
---
For me it's being subscription-free.  You can play when you're interested and stop when you're bored.  The game is excellent to play occasionally.  It might not have enough meat if you're an MMO junkie used to things like WoW raiding.
---
I wish there were dolyak plushies :(
---
If it helps feel more thematically appropriate, Trahearne was also a necromancer who focused almost entirely on minions. Raven shamans, Ash legion, and the asuran college's also make extensive use of necromancy.
---
there are a lot of hardcore level players that have never been in hardcore guilds, plus each squad is allowed 3 hardcore players too. Sellers arent always hardcore and the skillset in sells is very different to that used in record runs: sells use the safest methods as opposed to the fastest/riskiest.
---
It is an armor skin. It's not an armor with stats and rarity, which is what I'm hoping crystalline armor won't be either.
---
Ah yes, the Salt Flats
---
especially with unidentified gear nowadays
---
Peninsula? I hardly know her!
---
Surely you [jest](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Gift_of_Color)
---
What do you say when one day, human race and mosquito can live side by side without harming each other, no more itchy skin and malaria, no more mosquito trap, no more destroying still water and other mosquito nesting place. But the catch is that you have to die first, your kin is ready to stab you to gain peace with mosquito. I personally refuse to die for that.
---
Kinda sounds like youve got your guardian pretty poorly equipped, no offense. I play guardian as well, and I can solo most content no problem. Its probably one of the most self-sustaining classes in the game, considering all of its healing abilities plus the high defense/health pool. What sort of stats on your armor do you have?
---
Probably former starcraft players
---
Full ascended berserkers, GS + Scepter/Focus with scholar runes, ascended backpack, amulet, rings and accessories full berserkers.
---
QqO
---
&gt;but all the dead we met, and standing all as one against Kralkatorrik in the Fissure of Woe. 
---
Plot twist - Scarlet kills Kralk and steal our godhood. Then she kisses with Kormir. They deserve it.
---
Will replacing my current all-in-one zip file with an updated one change any of my preferences for it? Like what I have ticked and unticked. I want the update but it's not that important and I wouldn't want to re-do all those annoying ticks.
---
lets be honest... the team with the most scourges wins
---
You mean watchknights?
---
yeah, fem heavy is just... ugh.
---
so anyone know good times to find an HoT HP train? PST preferred please and thanks
---
It should not delete any of them they are stored in the different file 😊
---
&gt;I think OP meant what Kralk did to Aurene, when he talked about "the unspeakable". And therefore, yes Aurene started it.
---
Even if we ignore Kralkatorrik hunting down and brutally killing Aurene's mother and threatening the world as we know it, Kralkatorrik sent the Death-Branded Shatterer after Aurene before Aurene did anything to Kralkatorrik.
---
&gt; While we’ve attempted to find a new administrator to take over all my responsibilities, as a team we’ve decided that it just isn’t viable. We didn’t feel confident that a new set of administrators could maintain the quality standards that we’ve set ourselves, so we’re instead going out on a resounding high note with the Annual 2018.
---
We deliberately haven't gone into too much detail, but I'd add that I've had almost sole responsibility for driving the design and overall production quality of our magazines since 2012. With me stepping down, the remaining trio of managers who would have stepped up didn't feel like they could match or continue what we've become known for, especially when it came to our physical Annuals. It's unfortunate and we've tried to reduce the reliance on me over the years, but when it came down to turning our writer's content into a magazine, I was the only one who could do it to the standard we wanted - though a big shout out to Miko and Maiirin who both did design work on multiple issues.
---
Thanks for this. For some reason I didn't process that paragraph when I read the article. 
---
Would you be willing to share why you wanted to step down now or what you've got lined up for you next?
---
Hmm... I love thief, but what I don't like is fact, that they're outlaws, bandits and dirty fighters, not assassins - especialy daredevil. I played a lot as a daredevil. Deadeye is more like this - hunter and sniper.
---
Most problems in fullscreen is DXGI lockup due to focus switch(Alt-tab and others). Currently there is only a workaround on this problem, as it looking to be not solvable another way.
---
Obviously they should have done a mount stable array in Sun's Refuge ;p
---
I will Go for it too. But I will start building this evening. Like it more this way. Though I stacked mithril before.
---
Ah yes, The Dark Library.
---
Omg. Maybe I am just not gonna get this legy
---
That drop rate...
---
Subpar food? It's like 1% difference between spicy butternut squash soup, difference is that squash soup is hella expensive while avocado smoothie is a couple silver
---
Ah yes Divinity's Eeach
---
Follow the commander. At some point he'll stop to wait for people to group up together and you'll catch up.
---
I'm new and I played about 2 hours of WvW without a mount and all the fights started after I caught up with the commander
---
For me it was very much a personal decision. I joined when I was 16 and I'm now approaching 25. For most of that time I was a student and had enough free time to dedicate to the project, but now that I'm in a career I just don't have a lot of time outside of the weekends. Many people don't realise it, but GuildMag required a lot of time from me, often several hours each day and up to perhaps 70-80 design hours for each magazine over a 2 week period - those are the hours most people have to work, never mind dedicate into a fan project. I know that I can't put that kind of dedication into the site any more without GuildMag becoming the only thing I do.
---
As for what's next, I'm done producing content. After all those years, I'm definitely feeling a little burned out. I've suddenly got a whole lot of free time back, so I'll be using it to explore some of my other hobbies. :)
---
That's great. Perhaps a bit more time to actually play Guild Wars 2? :)
---
I honestly thought the site was generating an income, so it never occurred to me that the members were doing this in their free time around other commitments.
---
Or they will do a gemstore outfit based on this.... .....
---
 Ah yes, the Sunspear Great Hall.
---
Well, if you have mounts, you can just hop up from the inside.
---
No need for the event chain.
---
edit: yeah... sry reading is hard sometimes... OP said it already xD
---
&gt; being so bad at the game that food is the factor
---
All of SEA cries
---
Your biggest "gate" to the warclaw will be the 7~ hours it will take to finish the reward track. You can get the keep and tower capture achievements in the Edge Of The Mists in which the mount is not useable.
---
 I do agree the design is dumb and clearly aimed for when the mount was brand new, but it is absolutely by no means difficult to get either.
---
You can also always try just asking the commander if it would be fine for them to run without mount. At least on Piken we tend to do that now and then when we know people dont have mounts.
---
I'm torn because i'd like to dye My armor in Black, but a commander can't be a terrific and negative character.
---
Guess your guild is full now XD
---
Palawadan does better and that is telling
---
Hey guys, I want to work on my first legendary weapon which is the Bolt.
---
Any advice on what my first steps should be?
---
I know some people say to buy Zap then craft the rest, but it cost around 550g and I am a newish player so I don't know how long it will take to get that amount at the moment.
---
#whatapity
---
Haven't been keeping up with GW2. Is this new legendary armour? For fractals potentially?
---
Even ranger whirling defense also reflects his balls
---
Mesmer dps with the hot elite chronomancer is the go to solo content clearing class. It has a really long, high burst that is suited for soloing content like dungeons. 
---
It is important to distinguish between casual pve and the hardcore pve. Open world, story, and dungeons are casual; you can play anything with success cuz it’s so ez.
---
In fractals and raids, you want a fit class for each situation.
---
Sword is a power weapon (does upfront damage), whereas sceptre and torch do condition damage (slow damage over time, like poison and burning) so they rely of different stats to do damage. That might be part of it. 
---
Sword/sword is pretty much the standard mesmer weapon set because it does a lot of damage and has a block. Focus is a good secondary. Greatsword is also a good choice if you want some range. 
---
Torch, pistol (to some extent), staff and sceptre work really well on a condi build but don't pair very well with sword because they use different stats to calculate damage.
---
I love Mesmer but it’s just so pink. Why is all the illusionary magic pink and violet?
---
At what time will War Eternal be made active? (Please specify timezone).
---
Thanks
---
I'm sure about that. I played power chrono with assassin's gear not long ago and it feels much better than berserker's. Or at least mixing berserker's and assassin's.
---
Less power but more crit chance (and more critical hits at all). In OW and solo content you have to do it by your gear.
---
Soo nostalgic
---
What's the best way for a F2P (other than expacs) to get the living stories? What is a good farm for enough money to get gems? Also are the old stories broken into seperate purchases? I noticed a pack
---
I'm a returning player that just has the newest Living Story, and the expacs
---
Disable any add blockers you may have. 
---
Don't download it from an unofficial source.
---
Ha ha ha. Hmmm **seriously contemplating**
---
Hey guys, newish player here, 
---
I want to start working on my first legendary weapon the Bolt.
---
What do you guys recommend my first steps should be?
---
I know some people say to buy the first precursor the Zap and craft the rest but it costs 550g and I do not have that amount of gold at the moment. I don't know how long getting that moment will take either so I am going to have to craft it. 
---
But besides that, I was hoping you guys can set a path for me to begin on.
---
Just removed a handful of hateful comments here. Not going to pass out any bans this time but I'm going to say this once and only once. Insulting any member of our community is grounds for a ban.
---
If the only comment you can give is insulting, then **DON'T FUCKING COMMENT.**
---
The puzzle aspect is trying out different combinations of items in the Mystic Forge to see what they make. Because so many people play the game it usually gets found out very quickly, and then they can share that discovery with others. For the rest of the players it's intended that they just look the recipes up on the wiki or kearn them from a guide.
---
Adding to the other comments, you can also do most of the required stuff in edge of the mists where mounts aren't allowed.
---
There's also boons and other such modifiers you may not be receiving because of your placement within the group that can affect damage output too. But yeah, don't compare your dps until you've gotten your full build together.
---
... The comparison really isn't fair. Malaria can be cured and people can be vaccinated against it. Mosquitos aren't as dangerous as Kralkatorrik, and there isn't really a reason to live in harmony with mosquitos. If there were higher stakes, and we weren't talking about essentially mindless creatures doing what they do because they don't know anything else, but rather about intelligent beings like dragons, then shit, if I'm the one that has to die, just let me take some Palawa Joko and Caudecus-like people with me and I'm ready. Planting trees which we know we will never sit under the shade of is how we make change in the world.
---
Playing this game for the rewards is stupid imo, you play healer because you like that role
---
im pretty sure for the new living story you need to have PoF expac to play it
---
No, no, we are kralkatorik, mosquitos are the Tyrian.
---
start with farming gold. as you farm gold you'll start getting the mats you'll need (you'll need a lot... like 1000 gold worth of mats). and just keep grinding. id save the precursor for last cause you never know you might just get it dropped :).. although i wouldn't know anything about that :(
---
I have PoF and HoT
---
Congrats on the exotic
---
Currently Zap costs 403 gold to make, and 490 to put a buy order in for, and 530 gold to buy instantly. So right now it's cheaper to go trough the collections. Have a look on the wiki to see what these collections entail so you can plan out certain things like maybe arranging a fractal evening with friends for the parts that require fractals. You're also going to need 500 of the tokens from Ascalon Catacombs, so factor a few dungeon runs in there at some point. 
---
Other than that it's breaking down what each part is going to take. At some point you'll need a Gift of Battle from WvW, if you go the craft route you're going to need ascended materials so make sure you craft those daily. You'll need 2 crafts at 400 to make a gen 1 legendary, so make sure those needed are at 400. Mapping the world is going to take a while, so chip away at that when you can. Even if you can only knock out half a dozen or so hearts a day it will be something. You'll need the other things too (vistas, pois, etc) but man the hearts suck and take the longest. 
---
GW2efficiency.com has a crafting calculator that breaks down everything you need and gives you a shopping list, so use that to keep track of your progress. 
---
For me I make a spreadsheet and keep track of everything that way. While efficiency is great it doesn't take into account things like the 10g needed to buy 2 recipes, or map completion tracking.
---
Unlikely as season 5 is confirmed to come right after.
---
That's why I don't trust the loot table in GW2.
---
Better or desired loot is so far out of reach and such events are just a way to get a temporary activity.
---
If you try to play the game this way, the drain is so common for players that I doubt I would feeling any joy when finally something drops.
---
Exactly, good commanders will always keep their squad close, or else they would run into outnumbered fights - even if their squad is actually bigger - because they keep dragging their men strength behind like a rat tail
---
right, that's why its only a maybe
---
NEVER!!!
---
Zerk gear i way easier to find during lvling but yes, if you want to optimize your character at lvl 80 Zerk/Assassin mix is the way to go for a DPS variant.

Break things down into what you can work on.  Unless you're an experienced player or a hardcore farmer your 1st legendary could probably take you something like 6 months or more.  The cost of crafting bolt is roughly 1500 gold. The bulk of that is in the precursor itself, Zap (400g) and the Gift of Fortune (800g).  What you need to do is chart out a bunch of baby-steps. 
---
Start on the precursor collection.  It will not be free -- 400g and work on it at your leisure.  Whilst doing that you should also be working on 100% map completion, mystic clovers, obsidian shards, the Gift of Battle (World vs. World) and playing/exploring different parts of the game.  My main suggestion would be to focus on having fun.  Explore areas of the game; open world LS3/LS4, Dungeons, Fractals, Raids (etc).
---
Try PvP &amp; WvW - different game-modes have different stat and gameplay values.  Player vs. Player puts a lot more emphasis on pressure and movement.  PvP/WvW put a lot more emphasis on stun-breaks, support and coming together as a team.  Optimized dungeon running is all about getting around fast.  Fractals are about break &amp; burn.  Raids are about mechanics, distributed pressure and precision.
---
I love Mesmer, it's my main class. It was my main in GW1 as well. But I really do hate the pink/purple theme and the butterflies. Especially considering that wasn't their theme in GW1. Also, I hate that the most viable option for ranged weapon meta is GS, which doesn't really do it for me in terms of theme.
---
With the specializations, I was even more disappointed with the selection of weapons they unlocked - shield for chrono and  axe for mirage. I was hoping for Dagger, and I think especially for Mirage, it would fit the definition of the spec better than axe.
---
It wants you to wait at least one full lunar cycle. You can see the picture of Tyria's moon.

Shrine Jackal Mount is currently sold in the store for 2000 gems, 7 hours left until the sale ends

Sorry to bother, just thought it might interest you, since ive been waiting for ages for that skin to be released again
---
Sons of Svanir and Flame Legion
---
We've had the Nightmare Court (with Scarlet) from season 1 up to HoT, White Mantle in HoT and season 3, and the Inquest in season 4.
---
I think the evil Norns and Charr would be cool to have more lore on, plus they could fit with a fire and ice Primordus vs Jormag thing
---
Play game, use [bag opener](https://silverwastes.loltools.net/index.html). Honestly I find Silverwastes relaxing, fractals challenging and zering in WvW to be always good fun (and my way of getting expensive gear, like minstrel armor or something). Sometimes my friends invite me to some PvP where we run around and try to win. After so long I sometimes wish I bought commander tag so I can run chest-farms in Silverwastes or gather people in WvW when more serious commanders are absent, but there is always some shiny nice skin I want that's way cheaper than 300 gold.
---
They are copying Avengers Endgame with this episode and endgame had similar piano and melancholic trailers.
---
He killed Glint because she betrayed him and helped others to fight him. From his point of view she was a corrupted minion. It's natural to destroy your minion, if it turns against you or have no use anymore. 
---
Don't every Necromancer player do the same, every time the don't need their minions for fights anymore?
---
&gt;Kralkatorrik sent the Death-Branded Shatterer after Aurene before Aurene did anything to Kralkatorrik.
---
Aurene is an offspring of the corrupted minion, who betrayed him. And she is included to the plans of this corrupted minion to kill/replace Kralk. And she is allied with a being that already killed two other Elder Dragons.
---
She is not only a disobediant minion (wich would be enough to kill her), she is also a danger for him *and* willing and able to kill Kralk. He just did something before she could attack him. And it's only natural to do something, if you know that somebody want to hurt you.
---
Playing in order is the best to keep a coherent story, but then you should probably avoid this subreddit for a while, I can guarantee you'll encounter a spoiler sooner or later. Plus, the "forbidden spoiler" timeframe is one month here.
---
That is smart. It's better to create bite-pieces more people will be willing to see all though the year than a large magazine that will put off people.  It'll get more overall views and more attention to GW2.
---
The story progresses through the living story so yes, it's best to tackle them in order. Otherwise it's like just randomly opening a book and starting reading for 50 pages then going to find another random 50 pages to read.
---
For optimal story progression, in order would be best.
---
But there are certain episodes that give better rewards than others, so gameplay wise it might be better to just do those ones first.
---
I personally would just play them in order, they're not overly long individually and you get to meet some fun friends along the way.
---
Flame Legion arc please, unless they do another nod towards fan-requests from GW1 and take us to Cantha... then I'd love to see those Wardens of the Forest and the Luxons and Kurzicks again.
---
But for now, in all likelihood, return to Ascalon and insurgence of Flame Legion!
---
He reminds me of someone but I just can't put my finger on it.
---
The seasons are in story chronological order, so if you wanna go through the story and make sense of it, you should play in order.
---
So you are saying that they are copying something, that wasn't even released before the episode was more or less already done?
---
svanir, flame legion or the renegades
---
I find Holosmith more fun, but my advice would be - make both, go to PvP trainign area and play for a bit to get the gist of their skills, then choose what is more fun. 
---
Honestly I finished more raids and fractals on non-meta but fun and optimized builds than when I was playing top tier meta chore build.
---
Trailers were relased earlier than the movie :)
---
Listen bro, everything youll do in life will look complicated at the beginning, you just gotta improve and understand which buttons to press and know when to dodge, these things take time it doesnt magically happend
---
The Ministry of Purity.
---
Yes, its like seasons of a TV show. Sure you can jump into game of thrones at season 5 but you will probably be pretty lost and miss a bunch of stuff.
---
Might be, but years of experiences plus datamining of every patch makes that unlikely.
---
Agree. Dries up the brain but you can't deny the 100-200g/8hr payout. My friend stays there to grind all day and he's already on his 4th legendary for the month.
---
I guess you meant that you own HoT, so no, you can't get mounts without PoF.
---
Guilds: there is a subreddit for guild recruitment and you can look for guilds in the official forum (login is the same as your login for the game)
---
There is no higher level or gear with the expacs like in WoW, every content is relevant end content for that matter, so grab you expac/s while they are still on sale ;)
---
As a non GW1 player, can you please explain in a few words how mesmer was by then (and its color theme) ?
---
The order is Personal Story &gt; Season 1 movie (episodes no longer available) &gt; Season 2 &gt; Heart of Thorns &gt; Season 3 &gt; Path of Fire &gt; Season 4
---
&gt;!She's also rotting for you, wherever she is!&lt;
---
Actually this example *is* pretty accurate. For Elder Dragons Tyrians *are* nothing more than mosquitos or bugs. 
---
Yes, we brought Kralk to the edge twice, but actually we didn't. First time Balthazar did and he ~~is~~ was an entity which magical power is comparable to Elder Dragon ones. He definitely wouldn't be seen as a bug, but he isn't a Tyrian. 
---
Second time we had help with an army of ghosts, included Kralks own champion, Glint. Also we had help from just another dragon minion and we were many. That said mosquitos (as well as bees, wasps etc.) *can* be dangerous for human, especially if you get stung by many mosquitos. 
---
So this comparion is pretty good.
---
&gt; because you can play almost the entire game without having to buy the expansions
---
Seeing the amount of content in expansions and living world (which requires expansions), that might not be so true anymore.
---
Tybalt, introduction!
---
Yes, commander
---
Welcome to Order of Whispers. Our goal is to gather information for new adventurers to read and help you on your journey. For starters you should take a look at this, [Orders "list of important things recruits should know"](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/newplayers). We also have weekly questioning session every [Saturday at 1pm UTC](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1pm+UTC+Saturday) where you can get answers to questions you might have.
---
There are also few other collections you might find handy:  
---
* [Guides](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/guides)
---
* [Related links](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/links)
---
* [History of changes and Living Story](/r/Guildwars2/wiki/returningplayers)
---
Now get out there and make the Order proud.
---
So what you're saying is, you gotta pay All tomorrow, or Nothing today
---
You should play in order at least the first time, so you get a basic timeline idea and a frame of reference. 
---
It will also help you appreciate more masteries after getting them later, since they make many things much easier and comfortable, like how completing the HoT story after getting mounts is way faster and fluent as you spend less time in traveling between missions.
---
After completing the story once, it won't be different from watching a chapter of Arrow with all the flashbask and flashforwards and whatnot. You will still get it. Mostly.
---
I assume the downvotes are again from ppl that have an attention span of a fruit fly?
---
great read OP!
---
If you own Path of Fire you can use the mounts once you go through some of the PoF story.
---
Is leveling and map completion boring? That's kind of personal. I think its a complete and total snoozer but others clearly don't.
---
Guilds? What are you looking to do? pve? wvw? If wvw you're gonna have to specify your home server. You can have multiple guilds so overlap isn't usually an issue.
---
Is the expansion required for a proper experience? IMO yes. The elite specs from both expacs are widely used and better than the base classes. There are exceptions of course... but it depends on the content.
---
Not only are the expansions useful but some of the living story chapters will get you ascended trinkets quickly and with generally less pain.
---
Is it worth coming back? I dunno man. Give it a shot again without committing yourself first I guess. For pve? I can't say. I haven't done it in a while. For wvw? If you can get a good group on a not dead server.
---
The community has done a lot for this game. I wish I could say the same for anet.
---
The Devs did mention a while ago that there were items no one had found yet. Not very interesting items though.
---
Idk why but this kind of marketing/giveaway is just imo lame.
---
as always, well.
---
still really angry about a lot of outfit, where male versions is interesting and so on, but female is just...well... naked.
---
And you won't have to worry up keeping up. If they're seiging, no one will be mounted long
---
i wasn't even considering the monster factions, like krait. i'd say largos, in that case. maybe an aquatic area can have krait and largos. and an aetherblade boat or submarine, to boot
---
It's also possible to buy Deluxe upgrades with gems in the in-game store, but they are rather expensive, and it would take quite a lot of time for a new player to make that many gems with the gold-gem exchange, specially now that there has been so many interesting items in the gemstore and the BL chests that the exchange hasn't gone under 135 gold for quite some time.
---
Make room for Czech and Slovaks
---
yes yes yes save 5-10 seconds for your clear and reduce your gold per hour by about 10-15% totally worth
---
I think we will need more than one Legendary Divination to craft the ring..
---
Šmrc :(
---
I totally get it and it grinds my gears for years and years of gaming.
---
This particular one looks like... Idek, who creates a heavy armor, and then just cuts holes in it?
---
says Lobster's throwaway lol
---
nodes are 18-24 hour reset from when u harvested
---
Thanks! Just want to share some good this game has brought. Seen too many negative comments and not enough appreciation, even if their criticisms are justified.
---
The Difluorite Crystal you stick in there has a net value of 13.6 silver at the moment.
---
Certainly a discount over the full price BoSnSBSS but not exactly a budget food.
---
If not, it's time to get that achievement for having two of the same legendary!
---
Thank you!
---
I downloaded mine at fluctuating 1-10 MB/s, not sure what's up with the download speed sometimes but don't worry, the game is top notch once it has actually downloaded.
---
This is ingenious. World bosses have never experienced a shortage of people. The original rewards are decent enough for people to regard the additional rare equipment with disdain.
---
People have been complaining about the bounties not being rewarding enough. Moving this event from world bosses to bounties would be a much better use of the rewards. Throw in additional trade contracts in the bonus boxes with a decent 25\~33% rate for Elegy Mosaics and you'll get bounty trains round the clock and bustling PoF maps.
---
We hadn't had anything about the Nightmare Court. Scarlet was Scarlet, she used one Nightmare Court location and took a few Sylvarie from them for experiments, but that's it. 
---
Especially since Mordremoth is dead and the Pale Tree no longer has to protect her Sylvaries against him, the Nightmare Court finally can be free. Without trying to corrupt the dream or fight against the Pale Tree.
---
Maybe use leveling tomes if you have them.
---
What does that even mean? I already cut it in half.
---
Are the flame legion not dead now?
---
ok thank you so much
---
oh, whoops, I meant Faolain :/
---
&gt; He killed Glint because she betrayed him and helped others to fight him. From his point of view she was a corrupted minion. It's natural to destroy your minion, if it turns against you or have no use anymore.
---
Counter argument: Glint wasn't always a minion. She was his daughter and he corrupted her, removing her memories and free will and made her a slave.
---
So really, he did start it all.
---
&gt; Don't every Necromancer player do the same, every time the don't need their minions for fights anymore?
---
Necromancer minions are not sapient nor do they have a will of their own.
---
&gt; Aurene is an offspring of the corrupted minion, who betrayed him. And she is included to the plans of this corrupted minion to kill/replace Kralk. And she is allied with a being that already killed two other Elder Dragons.
---
Kralkatorrik is capable of corrupting the "minions" of Glint though, so he could have settled for corrupting Aurene instead of killing her. He didn't even consider that notion.
---
&gt; She is not only a disobediant minion (wich would be enough to kill her), she is also a danger for him and willing and able to kill Kralk. He just did something before she could attack him. And it's only natural to do something, if you know that somebody want to hurt you.

Aurene wasn't focus on Kralkatorrik at all though. Vlast was, and Kralkatorrik did nothing against him so far as we know. Aurene's purpose wasn't originally to replace Kralkatorrik (as that was Glint's), but seemingly intended to replace Mordremoth (would explain Tarir's odd location; and Vlast for Zhaitan to explain Kesho's location).
---
I just did on hummingbirb
---
Something tells me we'll see her in tonight's season finale. Perhaps we'll even get to ride her in a story instance in the Mists. Hence why ANET said "new mastery" in the trailer when they showed the Skyscale. They didn't call it new mount. What if the final mastery is the bond with dragons that lets you ride them? Would fit with how all the masteries in season 4 are related to the bond with Aurene, and would also let you use the mastery outside of the story by granting you the ability to bond with dragon-like creatures such as the skyscale.
---
Since when can rare unidentified Gear can drop ascended gear?
---
Pfft, what do you mean? This is clearly a high effort, relevant post that contributes to the community :] /s
---
you probably wont need any seasons or story done other than the new episode. To unlock that episode for free, you just need to have PoF expac unlocked on your account and log in after the patch.
---
Then you probably need to do a couple or all of the new story chapters of the new episode and a collection on the new map.
---
[Launch Timer](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/countdown/)
---
We wont know til its released but if its anything like when they added the beetle, you will probably need to complete the newest episode then there will probably be a collection (or a series of collections) to complete to get it.
---
Thanks.
---
I’m near the end of T1 fractals and getting a hang of the mechanics, I’m going to want to start T2’s soon, should I stop buying keys to open encryptions and just collect fractal relics to buy the materials to infuse my rings or is there another way to get the materials other than waiting for them to drop? Or should I try to get the back piece and amulets first?
---
I've just made an Engi  to level to 80. I only played with the class for weekly key runs, and didn't get a feel for it. Doing it now because I have 1 of every other class, and decided to make it a cosplay of Balthier from FF12.
---
But I really don't enjoy the playstyle of core engi so far. From what I've seen, it would be more fun if you had gyros in core instead of turrets/kits. It looks like a simpler playstyle, than placing turrets and picking them up constantly, or switching all your skills by using the different kits.
---
you need to own PoF and the episode and you probably don't even need to finish the episode (if it's like the beetle)
---
I feel like its gonna be a pain to get lmao oh well
---
Right, now that you say it, might have mixed that with other kind of loot pieces.
---
&gt;We can see u payed 13x 250 Mystic coins. Thats what we gave you back.
---
They explicitly stated that they could only see 13x 250 Mystic Coins. I mean even if the scammer sold/deleted them or whatever the logs should still provide evidence of how much were originally sent to the scammer.
---
Yeah but they would completely refund you :D Not only partially.
---
 but they told him that they gave him back everything they see in the logs. But i think they are too stupid to read the fucking logs
---
Yeah that is kind of what i wanted to get through also so i am all with you on that :)
---
The PvP sigils and amulet also aren't stored in your inventory. And aside from skin there isn't any property kept from your original weapon.
---
&gt; Ok how to get a Chak-infusion ?
---
by playing the fucking game
---
Exactly.
---
I definitely think it's poor economic design to have a tradeable item that's so rare you can't buy it, even if you offer the maximum amount of gold that the trading post will allow.
---
10k gold deposit just to go on a waiting list. Yikes.
---
additionally to what OP already answered, there should be a difference between getting straight up scammed, and getting caught in the crossfire of an RMT case.
---
We'll see how they implement build templates, indeed.
---
(Plot twist: they will totally forget it and people will lose items the first days.)
---
Dont hear much regarding the human separators.  Could be a interesting story to see Queensdale taken over in a major story event.
---
Rude man ! If u play the game 24/7 and doing every Chak meta u need to have allot of luck to get it! 
---
So after saving and farming more that 15k gold u are unable to buy a Chak infusion. 
---
So tell me how to get a Chak infu by just playing the game ??
---
&gt; When I got scammed support didn’t moved a muscle.
---
they're not supposed to.
---
YOU got scammed because YOU decided to circumvent the systems put in place to protect players from scams.
---
Yes it did, when I started doing cms about a year ago
---
Maybe I'm wrong but I recall we've had this feature around HoT release. Then it disappeared.
---
convince us of what?
---
Would not be the first time support shittily handled a case and had to be pushed harder to fix it.
---
(And of course not the first time of OP possibly lying/not having all the info.)
---
or 2 CES
---
I liked the pavilion rewards. It seemed at first they were going to suck but I got a total of 45 celebration boosters, perfect to rank up in WvW. 
---
So yeah, I agree with this idea. Alongside the extra chest, a kill counter that awards boosters or other stuff to players.
---
I don't see any star on the mini-map and when I go into my journal it just has a "Begin this Story" next to the main LS4 branch.  I don't see any individual episodes.  I'm currently doing my Personal Story.  Am level 80 and have all expansions.
---
Dont buy stuff NOT from the TP, end of thread thanks for stopping by
---
This system prevents playing, in this case. The item is more valuable than the hard limit. You'll basically lose account value if you go through TP.
---
 I totally agree with you
---
&gt; But that makes no sense economically to create an hard threshold value. 
---
it does when it's a controlled economy.
---
Right. And I would argue that the latter is far more common here on reddit.
---
Skip, do it
---
GW2 story is like a book were you read each chapter after another. There is no ending they just continue the story without cuts, just change of view and/or change of enemie. So if you are interested in the lore you start with season 1 which can not be played through but there is a video of 3 hours that will show you how it all starts. 
---
https://youtu.be/d17gwV4vXOg It is long i know but it will give you the background.
---
After that it is season 2 who leads in to the first expansion Heart of Thorns and the story for that, then season 3 which leads to next expansion Path of Fire and the story for that, and then season 4 were we are at the last chapter, which will lead us to season 5.
---
But that’s a gamble too. If u just want to buy a ces u are unable to do it via tp. 
---
And u as an Exchange mod know exactly why ppl use exchange.
---
There is a time window of 1 minute to ready up after loading into a match. Use that time to check your build.
---
Okay, wild guessing on this one :
---
Since we only can show or hide certain equipment parts, which don't include weapons, there could be conflicts between your actually equipped weapons and your pvp build weapons. So they have to implement a system which automatically hides your equipped weapons ansld shows you build weapons, okay, should work. But we are still in fashionwars, so there should be a way to choose the skins too (which would require a new tab in the build editor) since no one wants to run around with standardized skins, even in pvp.
---
You could just implement a system which switches you weapon skills based on the pvp build, but I guarantee you everyone will abuse it to trick enemy's by showing other weapons than they actually use.
---
So there would be quite a bit of work and testing for a very little QoL update which will be for almost nothing when build templates arrive anyway. So keeping up the work on the templates  right away seems the better option ;)
---
U are not the infame support ! I’ll add screenshots after and if u want some earlier ask souls he has some.
---
planned economy.... like in East Germany? :D :D 
---
Do you know what happend to East Germany? Everyone was rich af, so they decided to break down a wall
---
You are able to do it. Gotten 2 chaks in 7-8months (the egg sac ofc). First one was after a 3month bid, 2nd slightly longer.
---
Requires alot of patience - yes
---
Unable to do it via to - no.
---
Objective &gt; Subjective. Power Chrono doesn't need full assassins gear, maybe one single piece - except you're gimping around in open world. But not like it matters there anyways.
---
Because the game doesn't have hype so there isn't enough people here to move things around
---
After only reading the title I was going to recommend Power Reaper. I regularly pug 100/99CM with it, and I have yet to be kicked from a run. Its burst is great and you are insanely self sufficient due to personal Quickness, Might, Vuln, and healing through the new trait (Soul Eater I think?). If you're getting kicked from groups there is probably more going on that just class selection, so I wouldn't use that to justify class swapping.
---
I wouldn't argue, I'd need stats and facts for that. And as I'm not knowledgeable of every past thread on this sub ...
---
Witch position u had on waiting list ? 
---
7-8 month waiting &lt; insta buying 1 for 16k.
---
Some players leave the game after 7-8 moth so that to much waiting time.
---
Imo swap to sword/focus and Greatsword whilst leveling. Condition damage is very weak on lower levels whilst power damage is not. At lvl 80 you can swap to play anything you want but no condi whilst leveling.
---
It's already controlled with artificial rarity (mystic coins) and gold sinks.
---
A random limit in the middle of a trading post is poor implementation, and that's polite.
---
There are currently two items needing for this limit to be pushed higher. And regarding the prices paid in mail exchange, they wouldn't reach a billion gold.
---
You just cannot justify this limit, there is no valid argument.
---
Buy what, a girlfriend? That's illegal, buddy.
---
I hate when people say that Messmers have a hard time when leveling. They don't, at all. In fact it is one of my favorite to level because they make my life when leveling so easy. Sword/focus/Greatsword and you hav everything you need. You pull them together with focus and you cleave with sword 2.
---
Wh?
---
I play t4 challange motes. At the end of daily run I usually get more chests than I can open. I always buy all discounted keys to open them but still have some left over.
---
You don't need to infuse your rings until you get up to late t4. Full set off ascended and attuned rings (much cheaper to do than infuse) will take you a long way and on that road, the materials will most certainly drop
---
I was position 21 first time, then 24 second, (I'm now 23rd again or something)
---
Eitherway your statement was untrue. You are able to get them from TP, if you can't wait -then take the risk and get it sooner. 
---
Going back to OP, is the RMT support is a mess when u do nothing wrong and well that just sucks but people have been asking about an improvement for this for ages with nothing done about it.
---
The usual "Sorry, this promotion is not available in your country." meh
---
&gt;Aetherblade city
---
All of my yes!
---
If we would place every person that asked this question just the last month that alone would fill up a whole server. Which in it self should tell you that there is a great interest in the game and a lot of players playing it.
---
Good faith ? If we don't assume by default OP is here to deceive us (hard for your natural scepticism, eh eh), then he's a guy (or the friend of a guy) who lost something and whom support didn't help.
---
So he's searching for ... emotional support ? Answers ? What do to ? What did other people in the same situation do ?
---
Not as if the mods ever do their job with the amount of absolute trash threads we have everyday.
---
I use Shiro only for the superspeed because unlike Herald, Renegade doesn't have permanent swiftness. :&lt;
---
Around time everyone goes to work :|
---
Love the condi renegade, surprisingly it's such a good farming toon as well thanks to all the AOE.
---
They do not copy the movie, they copy the trailers.
---
Thanks for ur answer ! 
---
I wish I could report the support :D
---
I play only off chrono for raids. Don't really feel comfortable or hardworking enough to master another class for the end-game content. haha!
---
Haha yeah people forgot the days before Warclaw when thief/ranger would just hide outside spawn and kill anyone who died on the way back to their groups... 
---
Some days if you died you had to wait for a few other guys so you could all go out together and kill the “roamers” camping your spawn before they get you.. (all while WALKING back across the map to the Zerg).
---
You heard right, walking back to the Zerg - in the snow - uphill, both ways (Old days life was hard)
---
Ok, thanks, should i just buy the amulet from the fractal vendor and acquire a back piece?
---
Just like the amulet or the sigils it just wouldn't be in inventory
---
When I was looking at them on snowcrows I was actually happy to see that both of their elites use power instead of having to collect condi gear for one and power gear for the other as some classes are.
---
You should try having your gear with power precision and ferocity. If you do that you should run power weapons for mesmer, which are great sword, sword main and offhand, focus. Pistol is also OK.  The other weapons deal condition damage which is quite weak while leveling.
---
If you use weapons used for burst damage you should have a much easier time killing things faster.
---
Mind that leveling is a time to learn your class. This is the time to experiment. Every mesmer weapon is usable in the endgame in one way or another.
---
Too cute &lt;3
---
I could definitely see the gold legion worshipping primordus and his destroyers.
---
That was a nice read, ma guy. :&gt;&gt;.
---
I think you're confused. You just need to have the player equip a different weapon sets in a PvP zone. Choosing a skin would be an extension of the wardrobe.
---
It's not really tedious to just switch maps to gain another reward, and it's not like they just get the rewards for free but actually have to participate again which can also mean killing the boss again from the beginning, it's just that other people prefer different playstyles it has nothing to do with avoiding anything. Some people just like collecting a bunch of boxes and opening them all at the end to see the chances or just to see the loot rolling in, you might not enjoy it yourself but I and probably a lot of other people do.
---
Because guys obviously never do that *eye roll*
---
For each loose, the number also goes down LUL
---
unlimited fun am I right.
---
I think they should add elonian npc to LA and hoping for cantha NPC, just talking and walking... i think LA should evolve with the game.
---
The warclaw npc is a great example.
---
Add some nahuch frogs or a lost awokened.
---
First thing I'm working on is getting Gift of Battle.
---
Zap costs 550g because of materials you have to put in the way to craft the precursor. If you don't want to farm materials (and craft time-gated ones) simply buy the precursor. I think it could be easier and faster to get that gold for precursor.
---
If everyone else in the group is using best food, it is courtesy to use the best food as well. If they don't care, no need to bother.
---
Thats all I am saying.
---
Thank you ^^ I really did my best on it.
---
Umm, what's a bag opener?
---
Do you spice?
---
Yeah I'm used to seeing SSBSS.
---
Steam is not a charity. They want a profit. Money would have to change hands some how. Most likely they get a percentage of all sales, even if they only offer the free version.
---
I'm pretty sure that Anet or NcSoft know Steam exists and would have done this already if they thought it was beneficial.
---
this is not facebook
---
It's not going to happen because Steam would require Arenanet to use the Steam microtransations API through Steamworks for gem store sales to those customers. Steam would then take a percentage of all of those transactions.
---
Not a theory. Not debatable. A fact of the Steam licensing structure. https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/microtransactions
---
Even though I did not downvote the OP, I can understand the reason behind it. Just like threads saying "ThIs GaMe SuCkS", the ones that just praise it without much contrast in their criticism (and justify themselves with 'I see so much negativity omg' despite praising threads being as present if not more than the 'negative' posts they're talking about) are equally annoying, if not more.
---
Man I’m jealous! I wish I could dive deep into this game like that. I just couldn’t get hooked. Awesome glad you love it! And good luck to you!
---
Check out the Shadow of the Dragon skins, they scratch my Mordrem look itch.
---
Read the wiki article on [command line arguments](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Command_line_arguments) and use */clientport:80*. For me, that eliminated throttling from my ISP and resulted in much faster load times and game play.
---
Now remake it in epuisode 5 style (☆•☆)
---
I hope they release the remaining Corsair skins as well. They look so good on heavy IMO.
---
&gt; gw2 is pretty much just a handful of files with 1 file which is a 40gb(or more)
---
Not true, actually. While the data is stored as a single file on your hard drive, the downloads from Arenanet are multiple smaller files which are then placed in the large .dat database on your computer.
---
Feels much worse now. Can't outrun anyone anymore, one can keep you in combat and his buddies mount up and charge you with an 11k health shield and complete CC immunity. That is when you do have a mount.
---
If you are in it without a warclaw, boy you are screwed. Roamers are running you down much faster of much bigger distance. At least in days of old the Thief had to spam his initiative away if he wanted to catch up over a large distance. Now he can just walk right up to you, get an opening on you, and there is balls you can do.
---
Ye i would never do that... i just a example how i maybe can skip taxes here
---
psna? I feel like I'm missing out on some important information. 4g is a lot different than 450
---
Elementalist and Necromancer
---
At this point it's time for bed and I'll just leave it going but if it's still going in the morning which it's set to be I'll give this a shot thanks.
---
This one I'm going to do before heading to bed thanks dude.
---
Path of Exile microtransaction stuff is also overly expensive in comparison to most other similar systems.
---
Good choices.  I obviously cannot pick for you as I would tell you to play engineer!! :P
---
There multiple ways to play both (really all classes). Now that you have narrowed it down I would highly suggest making one of each and run around until 15ish maybe to see if you like the base class. Understanding that later on you can unlock Elite Specs which alter the gameplay of each one to an extent and unlock different  weapons to use, etc. 
---
Hope this was helpful for you and if you further questions please ask away.
---
As far as I know it has never changed, but I've only been playing for three years.
---
I enjoy it from a nostalgic sort of perspective, but it doesn't really offer anything terribly unique.  I'm not going to aggressively downvote it or anything, but I think I have a pretty solid reason for feeling the way I do. 
---
Pardon my criticism, but I mean, is Guild Wars 2 an MMO or is it an online game that people play alone?  The most interesting part of the game to me isn't the game itself.  It's the people that we play it with, who they are, and the journeys and memories that we weave together with them.  The big reason many veterans play isn't the game itself -- it's the people that make the game fun. 
---
I'm all for celebrating the game itself, but only to a certain point.  I find connections with other players far more meaningful.  There must be a lot of introverts and loners like myself playing online games; people that struggle to, well... be themselves and build confidence and trust in other people and in themselves.  I like hearing about player growth both on a personal, player and sometimes on a professional level.  I like hearing and seeing them achieve things; whether in-game or outside of the game on a community discord.  
---
As an experienced player I look at the game as fun -- as entertainment -- best served with other people.  What I've read here is mostly a single player experience, and if I'm being sincere, that saddens me somewhat.  I've met a lot of awesome people and I hope that everyone is able to forge some new connections in the new map today too.
---
[This guide has all your options](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/User:Tanetris/So_You_Want_To_Gear_a_Character). Do note though that amulets have an enrichment slot and NOT an infusion slot so no AR from them.
---
It's always been like this Cub!
---
He looks a bit like the guy that plays black pather.
---
I'm a new vanilla player that can only make 2 chars - I've already made an engi. Should my other be ranger or thief? If it helps: my biggest draw to the ranger is the mandatory pet that can draw aggro, blah blah, but also keep you company (given I have no friends on this game). I also like the idea of traps and general control while keeping distances. My main draw to the thief is that rogue is far and away my favorite class in most games, but I've heard this is a little different. I also like the idea of lots of quick bursts of damage mixed with stealth/evasion, and the fact that thief can apparently dual wield pistols. Im just not sure here, lol. Any advice or ideas?
---
&gt;I have no idea how down loading works
---
Wow that's incredible, it really shows how much has happened, and how much we've lossed... I'm both extremely sad and extremely hyped ahah! Really good work, congrats!!
---
I totally agree! This game does fall a bit short when it comes to guilds and promoting conversations and personal experiences with other players. Like I mentioned my first experience with a world boss, I was left alone afterwards to try and figure out what the hell just happened. 
---
It doesn't mean the game doesn't allow you to try and be a part of an active guild, it just doesn't seem as important (Unless you need to raid a lot)
---
It does cater to a casual player a lot and whether that is Anet's intention or not I don't know. This game just happened to suit me and my needs perfectly. Many will disagree about how good the game is and that's ok. 
---
But I have had fun nonetheless and that's all I came to share.

oh interesting, first time I ever see this animation! Yeah I'm guessing it's a bug, or lower animation setting, something like that!

 Copy-Pasta from an answer here:  [https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/lore/Necromancers-Minions-and-Society](https://forum-en.gw2archive.eu/forum/game/lore/Necromancers-Minions-and-Society)

I know there have been others but I cannot find them with a quick google.

&gt;The short answer is that death energy is just another form of magic, not inherently evil, and necromancers are likely to be no more icky in society’s view than coroners or forensic examiners are in ours. Which doesn’t mean people want minions wandering around in polite settings any more than we’d want a coroner to plop a jarred heart down on the dining table …
---
That's why necro is lore friendly

I have trouble feeling comfortable with soulbeast. I love the design of combat and the abillity to morph together with your pet. But the visual effect of beeing morphed together is extremely ugly to the point where it kinda crushes my mood, when I see it too much. Would have been a lot cooler, if different pets had different visuals fitting to their theme.
---
Well, you go ahead and organize that! :) I'm sure it'll be a blast.
---
Will doing this naturally unlock masteries for me?
---
Plot Twist. We need 250 kral ingots.
---
My speculation its that this trinket will use the Gift of Desert Mastery.
---
I am actually really sad I missed the whole GW1 experience. From what I have heard from so many people is that it was an amazing game. I was playing a lot of WoW at the time so I was preoccupied anyway.
---
proxy for the win
---
Yeah, I mean, I just think you'd have *more fun* with other people after you've built friendships with them.  The irony being that I've *already* been downvoted for having a different perspective, and even one that you can agree with.  I think I would have quit a long time ago if it weren't for the guilds that I were in -- making memories, laughing and working hard on things together.  This is what "casual toxicity," looks like -- being unable to tolerate even the *slightest* differences of opinion!
---
It says legit right there in the signature, do you really think someone would jist go on the internet and tell lies?
---
How the? Wtf? So many questions in my head
---
Kralk would've moved anyway because of the movement of the world had started.  
---
Only because he woke up and found that Glint had turned is why he raced towards Crystal Desert to hunt her down.  
---
The Elder Dragons are still forces of nature who are not transcendent enough to forget their own place in the cycle. They obey the natural law.
---
Bane of my life. Srsly. I wish they'd QoL this.
---
First of all I would like to thank you on behalf of all GW2 raiders. We would be lost without your benchmarks.   
---
I have a question, 1st and 2nd guilds have only 1 sec between them and while the 1st one started on the platform, 2nd team started on cliff. Should't starting on platform count as unintentional feature or something?
---
P.S I don't know any of the guilds. I just felt sorry for the 2nd guys.
---
Why did you comment then?
---
TIL I'm **not** supposed to see my Revenant jumping around (however it isn't as pronounced as in this video, only half his model seems to render and only for a half-second before moving to the next strike)
---
Interesting...I kinda prefer it tbh
---
I'm never going to waste gold in a pug where it's not even guaranteed that I will even get a single kill and then also spend 2+ gold on the food when I can just use something that is almost as good but costs me far less gold to use. It's pretty common to have people using optimal food and still pull less dps than me. I have no inclination to drastically lower my gph to save 5 seconds of time in a clear, regardless of what anyone else does
---
Nah
---
Triple 😥
---
It’s simply amazing and still is.
---
yes, gets the heart of the point i was trying to make. your wording is better though
---
Hopefully this is also fixed with the new build template system.  Maybe that's why they haven't addressed this yet.
---
&gt; Counter argument: Glint wasn't always a minion. She was his daughter and he corrupted her, removing her memories and free will and made her a slave.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; So really, he did start it all.
---
Glint was created by Kralk as his scion. There are no sources that say he removed her memories, free will or that he corrupted her. 
---
However, it doesn't matter if Glint was created as a minion or created as a scion and were corrupted afterwards. Point is that she was created to serve Kralk. And actually being a bit more than a minion, a daughter. And the Tyrians took her away from him. 
---
&gt;Kralkatorrik is capable of corrupting the "minions" of Glint though, so he could have settled for corrupting Aurene instead of killing her. He didn't even consider that notion.
---
And what would change? It doesn't matter if Kralk corrupt or kill Aurene, the result is the same. 
---
However, since she is a possible replacement for Kralk, ofcourse she is a danger for him and while his corruption could be purified, like the forgotten did with Glint, killing her is the safest way. 
---
&gt;Aurene was never a minion, but on top of that she wasn't focused on Kralkatorrik at all. Vlast was however, and Kralkatorrik did nothing against him so far as we know.
---
Vlast protected humans from branded, when Kralk came to kill Glint, but he never fought Kralk himself. Probably Kralk didn't even knew that Vlast existed.
---
&gt;Aurene's purpose wasn't originally to replace Kralkatorrik (as that was Glint's), but seemingly intended to replace Mordremoth (would explain Tarir's odd location; and Vlast for Zhaitan to explain Kesho's location).
---
That's just speculations, nothing canon. Kesho were built from Glint and the Forgotten to study ascension. Vlast were born later.
---
&gt;Point is: the joking statement that Aurene "started it", is false.
---
Since we went far away from the circumstances I made this statement, now it's no longer the case... obviously. 
---
With all the backstory the correct statement is: Tyrians started it, by turning Kralk's daughter against him.
---
Thanks a lot friend! Can i add you ingame? Also, i started engineer once and it was cool but i wqs afraid i could not master it
---
Yes it happened to me then but not when I was logging into an instance but when I was logging into Kourna.
---
You have to say you will payback 10x times once you get your wealth back, or else doesn't work.

I haven't seen this since 2012/season 1. There have been few isolated instances where the instance itself has been broken "How do you loose a city?" comes to mind somehow :P
---
To actually be booted to character select is really rare though.
---
I think that happens with lower Shaders setting. 
---
The character isn't supposed to disappear completely, but become transparent, leaving a misty outline of their shape.
---
What do you normally use your excess +1 agony infusion for?
---
thank you so much aaaa
---
I forgot the saying was 11 million strong. my bad!
---
I know the episode is coming out today and I may be entirely wrong but  
---
My theory is she may come back with the help of the magic she consumed from Joko, y'know, the magic that kept him *immortal* for at least 200 years. 
---
Ever since the beginning of Living World Season 4 when they brought him back, I was wondering exactly why though. I mean yeah we had to end his reign and stop him from releasing the third generation scarab plague. But that could've happened after we stopped Kralk. 
---
And here's the thing that people seem to forget; Glint herself couldn't see past her own death, just like Aurene. Aurene's death was going to happen whether we liked it or not, more than likely it is needed to be this way. If you remember as well, Glint and Aurene had a one on one talk after the last trial in All or Nothing, saying it was 'a dragon thing' and Glint mentioned Ascension. Likely, Aurene dying is the key to an Ascension. 
---
If that wasn't the case, then why would Aurene still go forward with the plan with her champion? She knew it was going to happen. If you remember, she ran off after seeing her countless visions of her dying and went to seek comfort in Glint's Lair. If her dying was not significant, she probably still not be willing to continue with the plan. She is a *teenager*, she is young and she is afraid. So Glint must've said something and comforted her of her visions to make her go forth. And that's also why she asks of us to be Aurene's hope as well, like I said, Aurene  was probably scared at the fact of her dying but our hope was to keep her going with the plan.  
---
And if you didn't notice, after the trials, Aurene's crystals and scales started glowing as well. Something happened and that this was planned between her and her mother.
---
Also, I quote from Glint's one line when you channel her on a revenant; *"Everything has unfolded as I knew it would".*
---
But that's just my theory.
---
Does your toon Need to be lvl 80? I've been online yesterday and got pof and hot but no 80 toon.
---
ye, that's the main issue, 90% of the content is in the new map...
---
No
---
So, aside from the 574 rares you got...  it seems kinda worthless for the 10-30 minutes each boss takes...  Might as well do fractals, youll get as many exotics, chances for ascended boxes and, more gold...
---
The skins could be selected in the pvp panel too, by right clicking the weapons, or with a smaller extra button.
---
1% of an hour is 36 seconds.
---
If you consider people who take *that* amount of extra time as people who waste yours, I don't want to have anything to do with you
---
Is it already released?
---
It's exactly like a TV series. Did you ever watched a series starting from the end or picking random episodes?
---
I mean there are series like that, say Black Mirror, but gw2 have continuity. 
---
This season have the biggest twists and shocking moments. You still have more than two hours until it. Enough to finish previous one.
---
For example, ep5 ended with the best cliffhanger so far, combined with a twist worth game of thrones.
---
&gt; Inquest seems to be more powerfull than other evil fractions.
---
widespread and potentially powerful maybe; but considering joko made mincemeat of them; i wouldnt put much faith in them effectively utilising their 'power' to nefarious ends
---
Most common DPS classes I see in fractals and raids groups:
---
* Dragonhunter
---
* Holosmith
---
* Soulbeast
---
* Berserker (raids as a BS) or Spellbreaker (more in fractals)
---
* Tempest or Weaver
---
* Scourge
---
Guardian can be quite universal — DPS (both power and condi), Healer, Support.
---
You have to describe how do you want to play.
---
If it were, don't you think there would be some sort off indication of that on the subreddit?
---
That only happens if you are the only power dps in a squad. 
---
Here I have started a strawman, you can finish it:
---
O
---
Most of those shiny auras are from infusions, which can range from a few hundred to several thousand gold (20k+) due to their immensely low drop rate.
---
Happy to be of service.
---
Don't feel like you're doing anything wrong. Levels scales, yes, but they can scale kinda weirdly. Even if you and the 5 year veteran are scaled to Lv.30, they're still going to blow you out of the water. That's not you, that's just how the numbers work out. Keep your head up, sooner or later, you'll be in their shoes soon enough.
---
You don't have to worry about closing the download panel.
---
You can close the client anytime, and when you start it again, it will keep downloading where it left, not from the start. The progress bar will go back to 0, but the bar is for remaining files, not for total ones, and it won't count the ones you already got.
---
Why did they give smokedcales this ability?
---
Don't forget popcron - This will be better than the last GOT episode
---
Stopped reading After "favorite character Taimi"
---
Ehm WoD CMs were really easy tho and you basicly had the entire xpac to get them.
---
I want to play as a spellcaster usually, or some kind of a swordplay with magic.
---
Episodes are unlocked permanently, you can play/replay them whenever you like.
---
Get out of here with your common sense
---
In 2 hours hopefully
---
I believe the Deluxe also comes with a good chunk of Gems, the currency used to purchase things from the store. Mostly aesthetics, nothing with actual "pay-to-win" implications. There's the XP Booster and Lv.80 Boost, but those are mostly conveniences. You can get to level cap in a weekend if you know what you're doing.
---
You're gucci fam. Once unlocked it will always be playable.
---
Yeah, because the event wasn't meant to flush a million egg sacs into the economy.
---
Yes, if you log in, you always unlock the latest episode for free, forever. If not you’ll have to pay for it. So take your time, just watch out for spoilers until you finish.
---
yes its will be playable. you unlock the current episode by log in before the new episode come out, the episode that you unlock can be play whenever you want (its permanently belong to your account).
---
the Gems are the ULTIMATE version, not the deluxe version
---
don't spread fake news
---
Haha. Not everyone's cup of tea I guess. Just curious, who is your favourite?
---
And miss out on consuming players t-stones?  
---
Now we know why they use items...
---
Oh I think I’ve already been spoiled but I don’t mind 😂 thank you! :)
---
its Rox
---
Here i am sitting at work, reading r/GW2
---
That’s fantastic, thanks for the answer :D
---
Great to know! Thanks :)
---
I don't know what it is about druid, but I can't stand it. It doesn't mesh with my idea of my ranger! Soulbeast is great, mostly, but druid is just a big NO! Like touching something gross, the one time I slotted it in to try it. 
---
I've yet to see if I can play druid on a ranger I made to BE a druid, since she's still barely at level 40. I'm hoping it'll work, 'cause druid does seem interesting? But not for my main ranger-- not ever!
---
Oh fantastic! Thanks a bunch for answering :D
---
Woaw never though of this existed WHYRYYYR!
---
Yes if you have PoF and have episode 5 unlocked go ahead and play it. If you are free to play you can still unlock the episode but will need the expansion to play it.
---
Awesome job capturing the SAB feel - this looks like it could be a real level!
---
I want Dhuum in the Lily of Elon so I don't have to do the pre event.
---
Anytime bud. 
---
My display name is BigRamsay.4783 - you can definitely add me if you have in game questions.
---
I just hope the launcher stops working like the first season finale.
---
BibleThump
---
I love the positive environment around this game. It's rare in online games these days, but it's what keeps drawing me back to this game honestly.
---
this one is special to me as its the first time i will ever be in a position to play an "expansion/release" on the day it was released. I either was always sub level 80 or away from the game when things released before. Looking forward to being able to explore a new region and get new tings along with everyone else.
---
Yeah I had sold my pc just before the expansion launched and was busy with university etc, tried to play it on my laptop (low fps), failed miserably and called it a day       
---
        
---
I believe you if you say it was fairly easy, so I take back my statement                
---
Sorry for the misinformation
---
You're still erroneously increasing stats with percent-based stuff. Stats from traits, signets, and class buffs do not get used in percent conversion formulas like the one for superior sharpening stones. (There are only a handful of exceptions for traits, notably the Firebrand gm minor and scourge master minor.)
---
You're also *still* increasing the condi damage stat itself with Berserker/Renegade runes and the Bursting sigil, when those instead apply their boost to the damage as a flat multiplier.
---
This. So much, this. I have created and deleted a few Eles. Im just terrible at stance switching. Weaver just made it worse. I was constantly switching into the wrong elements. I just gave up on it. It is the only class I don't have atm.
---
In the End..... Too soon QQ
---
Well, we cleared their citadel four times, canon. Pretty sure Flame Legion's backbone is broken. Svanirs? Not so much. We missed out on the Nightmare Court with the HoT debacle, Inquest are everywhere, White Mantle have been done. Not really much left but Svanir. Even the centaurs are all dead.
---
Think of this as a TV show on a free channel in an dystopic universe without peer-to-peer sharing: 
---
* If you are there when it shows for free, you get to record it for free and play it for as long as you can keep the records (your account).
---
* If you miss the show, you will have to pay for it. Like buying the DVDs, or pay for it on Netflix.
---
Every shout give 2 might for 10 people (+3 from fire shout) and +3 before double it with 4 in warhorn. You can overload in Fire too to get some.  
---
Me, I use septer to more blast (fury if you have to play fire trait for aura clean) but you can cover might with dagger too.
---
This furthers the mental mixups I have with War of the Sparks and War Eternal.
---
That aside, excellent work! You did a great job matching scenes and cuts to the song!
---
&gt;!Rock don't rot!&lt;
---
Im on quite same boat as you. Ill just add, i want my dragon back !
---
It's always been this way. You only need to login when it's the latest episode.
---
Yeah I was debating taking a sick day but remembered there has never been a smooth launch to a big patch in any game.
---
did the new living story episode come out today?  if so, I didnt log in on time to get the last one
---
Because they hate us.
---
Guardian seems swordplay with magic to me :)
---
FREE INTERNET POINTS!
---
King Vader?
---
You have about an hour and a half, maybe longer to unlock episode 5.
---
Nah. That's ok. I will just keep trying to make it go faster by staring at it. 
---
I'll figure it out eventually.
---
That’s great, thanks so much :)
---
Really nice editing at the end of the video.
---
Not setting a high bar there
---
Higher than the walls of King's Landing, I guess
---
We don't know how far north the flame legion lands stretch. Honestly we know very little about the charr homelands layout outside of what the map and NPCs tell us.
---
If the flame legion tries to worship/subvert primordus / destroyers there isn't much that we would know about that _until_ they strike at us, or we strike at them.
---
Agreed and if you want a different style but same feel you can go Scourge as well
---
Wow, you should have hired Cmaj to play the wedding song.
---
Point taken, I was more than a little upset with what I saw and may have overreacted in the comment.
---
I used to play on satellite internet I think I broke he ping counter cuz it went 9999
---
Did you at least get no fly zone from shat?
---
If you have an issue with a thread or think it should be removed, feel free to report it and we'll take a look at it.
---
Grindyness is usually a casual mechanic.  Instead of requiring people to master complex mechanics, and band their head against a mythic raid boss for X hours they can instead take an easier, but often longer approach to get something instead.  FFXIV for example has high end raid weapons for the hardcore, but also super grindy meathods to get similar weapons via the relic grind.  I've played all of the MMO's you mentioned, and of them I would say GW2 is only second to Runescape.
---
GW2's endgame is self advertised as being around cosmetics.  There are certainly a lot of cosmetics available via raids and such, but the majority of them are generaly locked behind low drop rates or boils down to either ridiculous RNG or grinding enough gold to buy them.  So yeah, GW2 is grindy.  And the majority of its endgame activities revolve around open world content of which most is quite grindy, in particular the events.  
---
And the loot is still heavily RNG dependent.  Just because you get something small and generally worthless as a consolation prize doesn't change that.  That said, this is in regards to the open world content, theres plenty of content in GW2 that isn't super reliant on RNG for you to get what you want, Dungeons for example.
---
"Shut up and *+urrp+* get in the golem, Morty."
---
I was in the same situation as you are, started playing like a week ago after a very long break. After searching for build and guides for every class into an attempt to form an idea of what I would/could enjoy the most, I also stumbled upon this video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhI-G1Yr-Dg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KhI-G1Yr-Dg) ) which was a very neat intro to every class, especially with the new specializations from the expansions (I've played a bit before any expansion was even announced, had a rough idea of what each class was about, but in nowadays endgame i was pretty much clueless).
---
This actually helped me. Short and concise. Hope it helps you as well.
---
Practice the Reaper rotation and learn your class. Good reapers won’t get kicked unless the rest of the party is completely stupid.
---
They are from the dimension where everyone turned into Asuras, but you guys already knew that ofc.
---
If you hate pressing a lot of buttons, daredevil probably your style, just a lot of mashing the same button and only have to manage initiative
---
I get 0 ping, am I doing it right?
---
I have a tab marked "Spoiler free" that only has damage info on it. I use that and a specific party chat until I can do the story.
---
If not from world bosses, is it a complete waste to throw down those hero banners at bosses like Teq?
---
Tybalt, introduction.
---
What is being released with this patch today? I’ve been playing recently just haven’t seen any details
---
\^ What agarie said.
---
Also, remember that the reddit community is a very vocal minority of the total community of GW2. The majority of people you encounter in pug runs will not be the people posting on here or the forums. It might at first seem reasonable to assume that the number of posts with a negative attitude towards Power Reaper (or any class for that matter) would imply the community sharing that viewpoint, though it's important to remember the negative bias that humans have in general; aka, people are a LOT more likely to take to the forums and start complaining about bad pugs using uncommon builds (and generating more activity meaning it's more visible here) than they are to post about a positive experience with uncommon builds (and even if they do, it's less likely to have as much activity).
---
If you can log into the game in the next ~50 min you can unlock S4E5 for free, after that S4E6 releases and will be the free episode.
---
Jump in quickly if you can!
---
I'm just praying for the servers to stay strong and not blow up like they did for the E3
---
This is the question every PVPer has asked since launch.
---
so itd be better to start fresh than keep my main?
---
I have a similar tab for when I just don't wanna deal with irritating map chat and wanna catch what npcs are saying. Called it "SILENCE MORTALS" lol.
---
I'm sure that they had secondary and tertiary bases, when Paris fell in WWII the French didn't all die ;)
---
the new living world episode
---
Thanks I hate it.
---
New Living World episode.
---
it was available in PSNA like 2 weeks ago
---
I want margonites T_T
---
they need to be bigger.
---
That's amazing lol I might need to change the name of my tab now.
---
Start with path of fire, unlock a mount (they unlock for all characters on the account) and then go back to going through the story as it was released. After you finish path of fire there won't be much to do aside from the occasional living world episodes and raiding if you're into that.
---
I really hope we don't... At least 250 isn't terrible (cries in completed stellar/astral weapon sets)
---
I mean, Ep 5 went live without a hitch - hopefully that wasn't a one-time fluke.
---
Start with going through the first few missions of  path of fire with your main, until you unlock a mount (they unlock for all characters on the account) and then go back to going through the story as it was released or start a new character if you want to refamiliarise yourself with the game. After you finish path of fire there won't be much to do aside from the occasional living world episodes and raiding if you're into that.
---
logging in now, install isn't done but im loading lions arch.
---
Do I need to do something to claim it?
---
And is it worth it to go back n buy the season pass?
---
[Nice cosplay bro!](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/397/625/be7.jpg)
---
Don't delete any of your existing characters as you will lose access to their birthday gifts, which get better the older your character becomes.
---
I believe I touched on this topic already but to reiterate: If you're using your shouts/auras for boons, you're not using them to heal. Meaning you rely on WATER skills to heal. Meaning you can't be in FIRE attunement to provide adequate Might stacks yourself. You claim &gt; If you play septer, you will make fire blast finisher and it gives the best might duration than Fire overload. With 4 in warhorn earth, you boost all boons by 10% too. Boons with tempest is slitly best than druid.
---
but you need to realize that if you're relying on those methods to provide proper boons, you can't be using your WATER skills to heal.
---
So I reiterate my previous statement: A Support Tempest cannot *adequately and reliably* provide full offensive boons to five people **and** maintain full healing. It's just not feasible.
---
I mean, if you play pvp you likely have a ton of it already so it really wouldn't make a difference. I have like, 700 transmutation charges and i haven't been pvp'ing since 2016.
---
To build on what others said: It's the *last* living world episode of this season iirc. Afterwards, a new season will start, not an expansion release.
---
Because of this cursed image, my life will now never know peace. Even today, hydras has already started manifesting in my house physically.
---
Keyblah Kan. XD
---
Oh god I'm scared now.
---
So it's not just me who thinks he looks like T'Challa
---
I don't know if it's necessary, but a little star should show up above your minimap in the bottom right corner.  Click to open and hit "ok" (or whatever), just to be sure.
---
I think the LW seasons are worth it, but you can settle in first and catch up on other content first before you decide.  No rush.
---
last episode I played on release day, right after the patch dropped, and other than getting bugged on the first instance...(a minor bug, and progress was saved), I had a fairly smooth experience.
---
hoping to replicate that, since it'll be super late in the night for me by the time I finish lmao (assuming no game-breaking bugs)
---
That rick is terrifying holy shit
---
Extremely cursed
---
If I leave my launcher open, will it automatically start downloading when the new patch drops?
---
This was done by the Dulfy crew during the HoT Betas, so that everyone interested in Rev could get an idea of what was coming. It's from about two months before the final product shipped
---
That's normal, mesmer generally will feel like it doesn't do damage outside of a target dummy/raids because it has a very long ramp up time on all of it's DPS specs.
---
It would just suck to take a sick day and have some instance bug affecting the story. Sure it might be a rare issue but would be a downer if it happened to be that day.
---
The answer that actually matters.... A new mount. A flying mount
---
Check the video date. Could be lower settings, sure, but that was posted August 2015, probably the first or second Rev Beta.
---
SWEET AND SPICY BUTTERNUT SQUASH SOUP WILL INCREASE YOUR POOOOWEEEEEER!!!!!!!
---
I always see fan videos where commenters give pity praise but this one is legit well done. Goosebumps even.
---
Who's the artist for this song remix?
---
Eh, fair point. Let's take it a different way: the entire, whole anti-Flame-Legion-offensive spanning over several maps culminating to the repeated destruction of the Citadel of Flame might not have wiped out their entire population, but their military significance should resemble that of France during WW2.
---
How big is the entire Flame Legion homeland? Is it the whole of the vulcano? In that case we 'only' took like 25% or something.
---
Keep your character for Birthday Gifts, but if you want to start fresh, just create an alt.
---
I feel this. I love the idea of ele I just have a hard time playing it. I had to force myself and I'm still terrible at playing it
---
Yes, you need long live the lich for the roller beetle
---
As long as you login once during the premier of the episode, as in from when it launched to when the next one launched, you get the episode for free.
---
&gt; [Spoilered Text]
---
I still keep my [Token of Affection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Token_of_Affection) on my shared inventory bar...
---
Maps are pretty much frozen in time, tho small changes may happen but nothing on Kessex Hills Tower of Nightmares scale anymore. Lake Regent north from Queensdale and west from Divinity's Reach could be the place for another human-centered story but it's rather unlikely S5 will take us back to this part of Kryta
---
stop
---
giving up what?
---
Well, that settles it. Buying gems it is then, thanks!
---
Awesome! Playing catch-up is taking a bit longer than I thought. One meta event away from my beetle!
---
I'm not crying! You're crying! ;3;
---
You basically need to weigh your options.   
---
Buying the 30 deeply discounted encryption keys per day will put a small dent in your relics income per day, but it'll be good gold income. You have to choose between progress towards Fractal God, or getting gold. 30 relics per day isn't a lot, but it adds up.   
---
As /u/xmandier said, eventually when you get to doing CMs + T4s every day, you get about 45+ encryptions per day, so if you don't stockpile keys now, you will have a net surplus of encryptions every day (assuming you only want to buy keys at Deeply Discounted price).  
---
You can either start buying the 30 keys per day now, or save your relics as progress towards Mist Attunements and eventually Fractal God. You will need A LOT of relics, and relics will be your bottle neck. Either way though, **don't open any encryptions until you've maxed your Fractal Mastery**.
---
Having recently crafted Bolt myself, you'll need *a lot* of mats to do this.  As a starting point, and as suggested below, make a gw2efficiency account and add your API key.  It'll show you what mats you have, and what you need for the complete recipe.  Do the time-gated daily crafting.  I'd also suggest:
---
* Get a set of infinite gathering tools.  You can use the currency to buy mat chests.
---
* (Create and) Park a couple of alts in Malchor's Leap to run around and farm everything.  You can easily do a loop around the east side of the map in 10 mins using a mount.  Use your shared inventory slots to transfer infinite tools between them.  You'll get your elder wood and mithril much faster this way.  Depending on how many char slots you have, I'd also make an alt and park it in Brisban for iron, and another in Timberline Falls for platinum.
---
* Do the leg ley-line anomaly daily for a mystic coin.  These can be used in the mystic forge to get some clovers and T6 mats.  Recipe in the wiki.
---
* Log-in rewards - for the 30 day reward, get the chest of legendary mats
---
* WvW/PvP do the gift of battle reward tracks
---
* You can upgrade mats to T6 in the mystic forge, if you have stacks of T5s.  Recipes in the wiki.
---
* Ley-line matter converter - get the bags of obsidian whenever they're available, or rare trophy bags for a chance on charged lodestones
---
* Gather *everything* while you're doing world completion
---
* Use mystic salvage kits to salvage gear (identify it first).  Recipe in the wiki.  Salvage any rare gear worth less than the price of a glob of ecto.
---
These things can all be done while you're playing the game and having fun, and don't require a lot of dedicated time.  Whatever you do, *don't get consumed by the mat grind*.  It'll burn you out, and you won't enjoy the game.  Good luck!
---
&gt; the first time i will ever be in a position to play an "expansion/release" on the day it was released
---
\*servers laughing in the background*
---
It's probably important to.note that this timer is an educated best guess of the earliest time ANet with launch the patch.
---
They can release it anytime during their working day depending on various factors. 
---
I have waited till 9pm before.
---
So don't use this as a certain thing and start moaning when it doesn't come at time set. Use it as a guide!
---
Beautiful. I’m crying 😭
---
Or convert gold to gems
---
I love it. Really, the music and editing are awesome. Thank you for this gem !
---
Wall Street wants to know your location

 \[apple cider\]!

Baited, like many others including me.

For the millionth time, there are no culinary applications for bloodstone... oh, wait
---
*Insert snide comment on how long it's been since the last release here.*
---
Seriously though, I can't help but agree with you on this one. For better or worse, we're approaching the climax of a major story arc and will likely kill our third Elder Dragon - it's hard to be anything *but* excited. I just hope the nearly eleven months of development time will pay off, giving us our best episode (and map) yet.
---
Same   (づ◡﹏◡)づ
---
Yeah, that as well.
---
Yes, I know about this problem. Unfortunately it could be solved only with major redesign of editor's engine so I'm still working on it.
---
Raid goes very fast if your squad knows how to do it, there's no lvls of raid as in wow, so its always the same lvl of hardness (if I you can call it like that? English isn't my first language). You can also go with pugs (like I do), but it's VERY hard to get into it, since requirements are quite high these days. Better find some training group in lfg or guild with timing that would be comfortable. As for how much fun it is, I really like how different a lot of bosses are and there's is story in raid, and it gives u income and unique skins, and I just like doing it from time to time, for me it fun cause I like fighting style in this game quite a lot.  
---
Also you better have a viable in raid class,  [https://snowcrows.com/](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjGkvn4r5viAhUDt4sKHUGRBkEQFjAAegQIBBAC&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fsnowcrows.com%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw1tysHZkD9Bi8KghbMrSM8_)  should help you with that. That's for raids only, cause in every other part of PvE you can play whatever class you want.
---
As others have said, Cosmetic Auras from infusions.  
---
There is also a [collection](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Requiem_armor) that unlocks upgraded armor skins that have firey glowy effects.  Gunna cost you some gold and time but it's way cheaper than the uber expensive uber rare infusions.
---
Who does story on patch day?

"long story short" does not apply here :|
---
From a more traditional view, virtue and power have been linked in myth and lore in our world since the beginning of stories. The very concept of Mana, a power source coming from the land itself, channeled by mortals, is directly tied to the righteous, pure spirit of the wizard using it. In many traditions, only purity and virtue allow mortals to use magical power, and in more recent memory Faith based magic is often considered the bedrock of magic itself. While to us in our postmodern, anti tradition Western society might find morality to be a weak silly concept to draw power from, our ancestors often found morality and spiritual purity to be the most basic source of power, a force to be reckoned with.
---
Wow, looks dope! I really like your take on his armor
---
What's this image? It comes up blank, maybe it's bc I left a chrome tab open with my mensa test results. IQ89 btw ;)
---
I'll give some of my thoughts as I just came back after playing through Heart of Thorns but missing Living World Season 3 / Path of Fire / and the newest Living World. Each episode of Living World Season 3 and 4 bring with them a whole new map to play through, with achievements, sometimes new armor/wep sets, and other collectible goodies in addition to the story that you get to play through. The maps also add vendors that sell ascended accessories with important stats, if that becomes important to you. I would definitely recommend playing through Heart of thorns story, seeing if you enjoy it, and if you do, buying the Living world (S3) and playing through it so you can 1. unlock the new maps, but 2. play through the story that connects the expansions. It definitely isn't necessary to enjoy the expansions but I think they definitely add their fair share of fun if you have the extra $$/gems to purchase it. 
---
Also in the Path of Fire living world episodes you can unlock the Roller Beetle mount and (in this upcoming episode that comes out today) the Skyscale Dragon mount.
---
Uhhh, the commander resurrected from death.
---
Joko could resurrect.
---
Aurene will likely resurrect due to eating Joko's power.
---
He's right, any death is obsolete, and they only truly kill off characters when their contract is up.
---
Some of us have shit loading times.  I've rerolled to a different class only to realise that I had the wrong weapons on.. no time to change.
---
This is dope thank you. I was just thinking the other day if anyone has made him!

&gt; # **05/14/2019—May 14 Release Notes**
---
&gt;
---
&gt;## **Living World**
---
&gt;### War Eternal
---
&gt;Aurene is slain. Kralkatorrik, victorious. Now Dragon&amp;#39;s Watch must reconcile their defeat and prepare themselves not only for the end of Tyria, but for the end of all things as the Crystal Dragon continues his rampage through the Mists.
---
&gt;### New Legendary Weapon: Exordium
---
&gt;Tyria is on the brink of a new era of magic and technology. Exordium physically embodies this renaissance—a symbol of hope, unity, and a bold way forward. The blade&amp;#39;s form expresses itself in unique ways based on the user&amp;#39;s specific need, taking on different shapes when thrown, thrust, or slammed into a target.
---
&gt;### New Mount: The Skyscale
---
&gt;The Mists are home to many strange and glorious creatures, including Gorrik&amp;#39;s latest field of study: the skyscale. Closely related to dragons, skyscales subsist on magical energy; earn their trust as you once earned Aurene&amp;#39;s, and you&amp;#39;ll be able to ascend into the sky and hover high above Tyria! The skyscale possesses the unique ability to cling to walls and other vertical surfaces, allowing its rider to steadily gain elevation in strategically measured increments. After completing &amp;quot;War Eternal,&amp;quot; meet with Gorrik at the skyscale eyrie to learn how you can acquire this newest addition to the mount roster.

---
&gt;- Prime Light Beam: The recharge time for this skill is now 60 seconds in all game modes.
---
&gt;### Necromancer
---

&gt;- Incensed Response: Reduced might duration from 8 seconds to 4 seconds in PvP.

&gt;### Warrior
---
&gt;- Decapitate: Fixed a bug that caused this skill to activate the Warrior&amp;#39;s Sprint trait.

---
&gt;## **Structured Player vs. Player**
---
&gt;- Exordium has been added to the Tournament of Legends first-place reward box.
---
&gt;- If you&amp;#39;ve unlocked a monthly tournament gizmo in the novelties wardrobe, you can now purchase another gizmo from the PvP tournament vendor once per character.

---
Same. Just requested if I could stay home. Fingers crossed.
---
holy moly rev sword has changed a lot
---
I kinda like story updates as a whole, but after ''All or Nothing'' and its ending, I've been looking forward to this one quuuuuuuite a bit, The whole story bit last time around was phenomenal in my opinion, Lets hope this holds up to it :D
---
You got beat by seconds, seriously.
---
It's chest, legs, and boots, but yeah. If you wear those three pieces, you get the full amount of your armor weight's Defense stat.
---
It happens. :)
---
Rechargeable TP to friend only 800 gems OOF anet did good
---
That's all you need to do. As long as you properly log in (character selection isn't enough, you need to load a character onto a map) you're good.
---
Living World episodes are a major part of the story and add a lot of content. LS2's (Living World Season 2's) worth is debatable because ANet was very generous with it and made the maps introduced in LS2 free for everyone. LS3 and LS4 episodes have one new map each and are absolutely worth it.
---
That said, wait with the purchase. There's a chance the pack might get discounted before you even get that far into the story.
---
Im so excited for this, not only because new content but also because i will finally be done building my pc today and will be able to play with more than 5 fps lol
---
I am hyped for the end of the world, who else is?
---
uhhh, it says the Skyscales live in the Mists so... I'm guessing we're actually getting a map in the mists ??
---
HERE WE GO
---
Dumbledore kills Kralkatorik in the Death Star after Thanos snaps the Inifinity Gauntlet to destroy Bubbles! Sorry to spoil this for anyone who hasn't finished yet...
---
&gt;Tyria is on the brink of a new era of magic and technology.
---
They're gonna turn it into a full-blown scifi game now or something?
---
Infinite teleport to the friend stone? Yes, please!
---
Endless tp to friend only 800 gems wow anet ily
---
Phenomenal.
---
Oohh is that the same charr as recently with the awesome fur?
---
I really like that spiked tail.
---
What pants is the charr wearing?
---
500 new items in the wardrobe unlock &lt;3
---
&gt; The Dominator weapon set and Ley Line weapon set are available as uncommon and rare drops respectively for the duration of this chest.
---
[Oh hey I called it](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/bb9mx8/april_9_release_notes/ekhgcm1/)
---
Looks more like tiny rick.
---
Instanced, most likely.
---
inb4 its a pvp-only mount
---
&gt; The new Recharging Teleport to Friend item is now available in Utility category of the Gem Store for 800 gems.
---
Sound interesting, now they just need to start selling friends too.
---
Yes,
---
You need PoF to play the LWs associated with it.
---
Burn it with fire
---
Quick stupid question : A friend of mine doesn't have PoF yet, but I was curious to know if it was possible for them to still get Roller Beetle and Skyscale from the Living World episodes without having the expansion?
---
&gt; Fixed a bug that allowed continued access to the Glyph of Empowerment effect.
---
Look at how they massacred my boy
---
"Oh my sweet summer child."
---
more like mists colliding with Tyria in some areas of the world?
---
DON'T LET THE CONTENTS OF THIS PATCH LET YOU FORGET ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE COMMANDER BLEW A 3-1 LEAD TO KRALKATORRIK IN EPISODE 5
---
I need friends 1st then  maybe i could see it is worth it,
---
Yeah but it rarely hit that 10, mostly it was 5 or so. Btw I'm actually getting solid 100 mbps download and upload all the time with my net
---
One with no cool down, coming soon to the BLT chest contracts.
---
Heh, nice to meet you again. He's actually got a new mane now, hope you still like it!
---
We're gonna fly through a blackhole and talk to her through a priory book shelf
---
Thank the five they'll finally drop in price. Feel sorry for some of the buy orders.
---
Takes an hour to recharge after use.
---
I hate Quaggan and everyone who likes them. Downvote me all you want but Skritt FTW
---
Anyone who can tell me what the new items on the statuettes are?
---
Enjoying the renown hearts seems to be so out of place today. But I must admit, I also enjoyed them the first time through. Some of them are fun even today. And they are still better than normal questhubs in other games. And you don't need them if you really don't like them. :D
---
Patch literally gave me a BSOD. I'm not talking aboout computers. I mean it literally gave my computer a BSOD.
---
1 hour cooldown
---
Super cute, sweetie game on point. :3
---
Same. Game just freezes solid when I load ingame.
---
Calling it now, Aurene resurrects herself through Joko's magic and then we portal to Kralk in the mists or some shit.
---
Oh the feels
---
Rent me friend.
---
It's so big o.o
---
Nightmare fuel.
---
Hey, is there no special animation for Ranger GS#2 ? Not sure if I keep missing it or there is none.
---
Think the question was along the likes of "how did people figure this out in the beginning.  Like before anything was on the wiki.
---
I thought the same thing, but am not concerned as it's:  
---
1. A guaranteed drop
---
2. You can farm/get keys from in-game anyway
---
I got so many single use ones by now and with 35 characters it is way too easy to re-stock on them. Otherwise I'd definitely get the Recharging one :)
---
Season 5 clearly takes us into space.  
---
That's where the humans came from. They're aliens.
---
It's the thing I got most excited about.  LOL. I use the single use ones quite regularly... So they get my money.
---
A post a month back said next raid is standalone after ep 6 perhaps a month or so out
---
They have said that the new raid wing was not going to ship with the episode but as a separate independent release afterwards.
---
I think there isn't or at least I did not saw any difference
---
It has a 1h cooldown, kinda useless for porting around quickly during a train.
---
Yeah, what has it been, 3 years? I got the staff from a BL ticket when I first started playing.
---
As others have said, try them out in the PvP lobby. 
---
As for thief, since it's my main : It's different from other classes because you do not have any cooldowns from your left-bar skills, instead you use initiative points. It's a fun class to play but the skill ceilling is fairly low. It's by far (to me) the easiest class to master.
---
You better learn to avoid taking damages and evade attacks though lol.
---
Wew, no spoilers, but that storyline didn't held for long.
---
They said the raid would come a few weeks after the episode.
---
The story Journal ;P
---
Looks great! :D
---
You are clearly miss something.  They said that raid no come wif dis patch.
---
Alright, thanks.
---
How much gold is Skyscale?
---
as if holo needed any buffs lol
---
Lol I made 500 Bowls of Sweet and Spicy Butternut Squash Soup recently so this post gets the feels
---
Fucking cliches man. The joko meme is real
---
Yes and i hate it.
---
"Use this mysterious item to grant yourself Teal Crystallization. While the effects are active, defeat enemies for a chance to find Teal Petals, then combine twelve petals to form a valuable Teal Bloom. These beautiful crystalline petals and blooms are highly sought after and will fetch a handsome price from vendors." - sold at vendors only
---
Ah come on, that Aurene rez was just bullshit. Can they be more predictable...
---
After watching detective pikachu, I can't help but to laugh when Aurene started talking.
---
Yes, I think it's worth getting.
---
The recharge is only 1 hour. If I have to use a second teleport to friend within an hour of using the first one, it's a very rare occurrence and worth spending a consumable one.
---
You can see it the moment you start the story so no way how to avoid that I guess:-P
---
IM NOT READY! AHHHHHHHH
---
And again, Joko saves the day.
---
It is, I just sent them a link to the storepage :)
---
Do you have arcdps?
---
GunInMouth emoji
---
Yo, should I complete the last LS before starting this one?
---
Thanks for reply. I have no idea how i miss it :O
---
Anyone knows what happened to Etherbound Footwear? It is datamined by that\_shaman but somehow only the gloves are released.
---
We're going to space in season 5. I knew it.
---
It's not in the achievement panel., so no new trinket.
---
Do you use directx12?
---
It's mostly about collections:-P
---
most pleps wont have more then 10 chars tho
---
Very minor spoiler for the new episode too.
---
&gt; After completing "War Eternal," meet with [X] at the skyscale eyrie
---
which implies that [X](#s Gorrik) survives the episode.
---
Granted it's 'implies' because there's so much Mist-stuff in the plot that they could die and be coming into the map as a ghost, but there's people who care about that sort of thing.
---
Sounds like G2 at MSI today.
---
Yes
---
Or just buy gold with gems?
---
arc dps? if yes, remove it until a new arc build is here
---
Quaggan.  Definitely the Quaggan. We've been lulled into a false sense of security while secretly they've been worshipping Bubbles in their hidden seashell temples.
---
Don't buy into their lies! Quaggan are evil!
---
Thanks. It's not like it was posted as a preview before. /s
---
Try uninstalling it . I believe they need a new version every patch
---
Braham converting to a new religion, love it!
---
You going to work on number 38 now?
---
Yes I do!
---
If you have suspicions about alt accounts and similiar message target. He was pretty helpful nailing out who is allowed to join, think I messaged him like 4 times. 3 players of so called hardcore guilds were allowed per squad.
---
A while ago I saw a legendary amulet Chatcode, i think the journey isn't over yet ;)
---
Which Gift is needed for the Weaponsgift in the MF Recipy?
---
People are downvoting everything in new for no reason. This community really is the best.
---
Yep, start a new one, I did the mistake of using the booster and hated the game and took me few years till PoF came out to give it another go, I don’t know why I did not think of it, but a streamer told me to start a new toon of the same class I boosted and level it until I feel comfortable with it and learn it ^^
---
so you've held on all those precursors untill gen 2 was complete? You truly are a madman. congrats.
---
What’s the final item in the recipe? Also what are the names of the 3 precursors
---
Is the 1 hour recharge bound to the character or the account? If I want to move more than 1 character to a location, will I need to wait 1 hour?
---
They've always done that. It's one of the joys of GW2 Reddit.
---
I can confirm it fixed it
---
same, now i'm stuck with my character loading lion's arch forever, or at least till the "no connection" prompt show up, shutting everything down.
---
Thank you! I'll look forward to seeing the layout later :)
---
I hope we finally get DSD's name!!!
---
It grows fangs like a saw
---
copy first gen weapon.
---
I couldn't hold my excitement as I tested it :o
---
i wasnt sure anymore in what order they got released
---
Not real legendaries. :P
---
Gift of Metal
---
Same. However i just got into LA again, after completing the first chapter.
---
Didn't know GW1 had such a following in New England...
---
Won't be able to fix til at least 5-6pm EST or so
---
same here, same bug from episode 3 release....
---
Same, I finished the first mission and now I can't get in anymore, EU too.
---
Same here. crashed at the end of the first instance and now my main is permanent resident of Lion's Arch.
---
To be honest renaming a guild called "Mom's Spaghetti Lovers" is more than understandable
---
Yes.
---
Still have over 100 of the regular ones ...
---
Oh it's not over.  That Hateful Sworl is the lonliest precursor in my account now.  I lost all of its precursor friends :(
---
Had the same error loading another char and switching to the buggy one fixed it for me
---
Here we go again.
---
Probably a future gemstore item?
---
Same here
---
I may spend the 800 gems just to alleviate the hoarder's mentality on all of the individuals I've picked up over time.
---
all fractals every day for 3 years. plus raids every week for 2 years.
---
Haha. Fair though.
---
The already wrote themselves into a corner. They needed Aurene to kill Kralk because someone has to absorb his magic or the world ends.
---
I only finished all the pres as of about a month and a half ago, spent over a month doing nothing but map completion.
---
wtf aurene is dead???
---
oh its by release order? then i think its correct. thought you wanted to compare the symbols to the gen1 legies.
---
Do you read chapter 5 before chapter 4 in a book?
---
This fixed it for me, thanks
---
I swear, every patch this exact post is made.
---
Haven't played since s4e1, saw the longbow legendary from last episode and really liked it, but from what I can tell the only "meta" build using longbow right now is Condi warrior, and only as a swap for zerk?
---
Are there any builds that use longbows more, or at all? For higher end PvE. 
---
I never really enjoyed pvp so I don't think I could motivate myself to grind that much for a pvp weapon.
---
Best way contact support, fill the ticket with all information you have, and they will get back to you , more information makes it easy for support to investigate ^^ good luck and wish you the best
---
had a very long loading screen, then the new instance loaded, froze again for 2 min but eventually i got through
---
I know. It still needs compensation buffs.
---
damn....thats too much dedication for me
---
... Oh god if the town clothes are on there I will be pissed. I just spent 500g for one.
---
Pay to grind!
---
So... Are you talking about computers then?
---
Now you can play the game
---
The writers have officially become incapable of writing a good story.
---
maybe it isn't intended to be meta there.
---
Shrugs.. I expect a new releasr after with it
---
Yes. You really must.
---
OK, loved that first mission.
---
You don't need to, but for the lore and story, you should at some point.
---
Wasn't the first elder dragon I killed by pressing one button.
---
Great! Now make one for me and send it to my address.  
---
...  
---
Pretty please?!
---
oakheart essence!!
---
Oh no, they're evolving! D:
---
I never thought they can go lower than Zhaitan, jesus fucking christ after all this time this is what you came up with? First mission was single handedly the worst mission i experienced in GW2 over it's 7 years.  
---
You even outdid GoT writers
---
even with the predictable outcome, the first mission still was incredible, even if it was just a glorified cutscene with pressing buttons.
---
i really dont like the voice actor for aurene, though...
---
That rechargeable teleport to friend tho
---
Science is literally defined as "the intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic study of the structure and behaviour of the physical and natural world through observation and experiment."  
---
Tyria's natural world just happens to encompass elements that we'd consider supernatural in our world. By studying those elements, the Asura are literally making magic an extension of science and turning it into technology.
---
First one shows the name of stat combinations while second one shows their name in ascended version. Choose different names in first menu and you'll see the stats on helmet change as well.
---
List of all of them can be found on wiki.
---
Well figures, oh well. Thanks.
---
Sounds to me like you just don't like the direction they went rather than any sort of "bad writing".
---
A Deus Ex Machina would've been derided as much, if not more than, any resurrection of Aurene. Simply put they (for better or worse) wrote themselves into a corner that could only be gotten out of by pissing factions of players off.
---
Lying won't help yours since anyone can see my post history and see i don't "shit on every single game i play", i shit on people saying idiotic crap.
---
Keep trying though.
---
You know, for an MMO all about that FAT STORY... I am very disappointed by this episode. 3 months. Good meme. 
---
"Here at Anet, we will have a panel about creating important and meaningful character deaths, and then we will shove all that down the drain and revive Aurene." 
---
Thanks Anet, I hate it.
---
Oh, it's been going that way for years.
---
I'm still so upset I haven't played since i found out about it. xD
---
Technically by pressing it a lot so it fired a cannon.
---
Please post screenshots of the branded relic package?
---
Another Taimi machine would've been so much worse though.
---
RIP Nerfenant in PvP.
---
That was retarded, lmao.
---
So whats the plot summary recap for anyone thats gone through all the story missions, aurene comes back and we kill the crystal dragon cut to credits?
---
Believe what you want, it won't change the fact spending multiple episodes building up Aurene, only to spend a few more with the fear of her death and finish with her reviving is horrible writing.
---
Yeah this caught my eye too, do we know what it costs?
---
Would've been better than reviving Aurene after spending 2 episodes going "omg, she's gonna die".
---
Are there any signs for a Legendary Trinket like Aurora tied to the Living Story?
---
&gt;Shrine Guardian Ears
---
oh oh... are those what i think it will be? (owo)
---
Nice mtg song
---
1) it's an exotic heavy helmet that you can choose the stats for out of a list of 6.
---
2) Those are all ascended recipes with minstrel's stats, after you pick one, you can learn the recipe to craft the associated ascended armor piece
---
At least this one was set up having her eat Joko's magic, right? Do it's not quite to the level of GOT.
---
Oh man, they're coming out with the Shrine Guardian ears? I wouldn't have bought the outfit if I'd known they'd be coming out later. 
---
But hey, I can't complain. I'm happy to just get them as a stand-alone skin at all ^^
---
Ok now follow my steps.. Delete it all ! All of it !
---
&gt;  Growth of Cauliflower
---
???!
---
yup, ill try my best, its like 85% done too, i just dislike pvp in this game.
---
'Growth of Cauliflower' followed by 'Don't be mad' hmmmmmm
---

does it go into the Mystic forge with the other greatswords?
---
Hi Selici :^)
---
Scion weapons... is that the next gemstore weapon set or ingame
---
I'M PICKL... ASURA RICK!
---
She swallowed a lich king. What did you think that woudn't have any significance at all?
---
It's too easy.  There isn't any real variation in difficulty anymore because everything is a sure thing unless you're in an overflow.
---
More Etherbound armor pieces? And Scion weapons!?  &lt;3\_\_&lt;3
---
I want higher res versions of those loading screens for wallpaper. They're gorgeous.
---
Cant believe it actually happened
---
yeah thx. Crash, after crash, after crash.
---
You complain about bad writing but actually WANT deus ex machina to happen? Seriously? 
---
Aurene at a powerful undead lich who was able to revive himself and dragons absorb the magical properties of those they consume, her resurrection simply makes sense.
---
There's a surprisingly large amount of initial comments that seem put off that Anet set up events to unfold a certain way and then had them unfold in that way. When I was growing up that was called good storytelling. Now I am getting the impression that some people wanted something else, though I'm not entirely sure what.
---
Agreed. This was set up plenty of episodes back, it was a deliberate choice and i know some people wont like it but the fact is it was already set up. And it make sense. maybe it couldve been a more glorious return or  dramatic or something.  But im still ok with it.
---
Sounded a little too forced and raspy, but it also sounds a lot like Glint, no?
---
i have a shit ton of these single use ones :D
---
Glad im not the only one...
---
Yeah but it was way too strong IMO. I think it will still be fine
---
Spoiler Screenshots of items for those of us stuck at work. please and thank you!
---
Who would have guessed the story could have gotten even shittier. Oh wait,everyone,because the writers are in it for the $ at this point.
---

---
I think fire Weaver might be the new meta, or at least will be very strong now
---
It's literally a 15s CD reduction on a skill that only half of Holo players use, and is situational anyways.
---
I too love the new map. It's a gorgeous mashup imo. Beautiful forest, gloomy branded, OH SHIT SOMEONE SET FIRE TO ANOTHER FOREST.
---
surprises/plot twists as tropes are bad because by virtue of their status as tropes they are widely recognizeable and thus unsurprising. Self-obsoletion is as close to objectively bad as storytelling can get imo.
---
also original narrative ideas can exist even if they owe their heritage to tropes.
---
This. Instead of eating a WP fee (it really isn't much but it does build up) I can instead tele to friends I need to get to, on any character (even those with minimal map completion), and free up some bank space while I'm at it.
---
im just hoping this reveals a new expansion.  I havent played since the week PoF came out sadly
---
Trident of the Scion... IS FHAT A  MEW M*THERFUCKING UNDERWATRR WEAPIN?!?!?
---
Anyone know how much the teal blooms sell for?
---
Hmm. I don't see the armor sets. I'd probably be somewhere around this instead of only having about half of them if I skipped the armor. Either way, congrats! That's my ultimate goal right there.
---
Daredevil will be better because of the extra Dodge.  Be prepared to die a lot though in HoT, it's a big jump in difficulty.  The heal on crit trait helps a lot.
---
Being a writer has nothing to do with being aware of what bad writing is. Writing is not plumbing,you need no expertise to realize if it is done properly or not.
---
Aurene reviving is stupid,set-up in a poor way by killing off a loved character in an undignified way,and renders the entirety of this season pointless. Kralkatorrik also got hit with a significant nerf bat,along with some mental retardants.
---
If the party member is already in the instance, ypi wont be able to join. Be on the same map and then let the owner open up the insance.
---
Was I the only one hoping for the erectangle again?
---
I agree with you, it was too fast. I get that sure, okay, she can return, but don't just invalidate her death from last episode so fast. Now I kinda get why they wrote 3 stories for post death, cause this kind of pacing is just, unsatisfying.
---
&gt; Growth of Cauliflower
---
Told you so!
---
This is my ultimate goal for this game. Jeez, I'm not sure I want to anymore.
---
Yes, and now they've had 7 years to rebuild, 5.5 if you count their involvement with Scarlet Briar, which involved technology that they may have been able to recover.
---
i didnt mean that kind if instance, i meant different versions of the same world map, there used to be a button if you rightclicked their name in the topleft corner to join them.
---
Or maybe it's because leaving this uncapped would absolutely murder the remaining population of the other LWS4 maps 🤔
---
Do we have a new node ?
---
I feel like people want foreshadowing, but also plot points that are so incredibly clever that months of speculation on the internet by hundreds of people *still* can't predict it, and yet the foreshadowing perfectly holds together in retrospect.
---
Which... Yeah, that would be nice, but it's kind of a lot to ask for. Not many episodic stories hold up to that standard.
---
If there is meaningful foreshadowing (and I don't mean the "Easter egg" kind like the Balthazar shield, but actual foreshadowing in the story) the internet hive mind is *probably* going to get in the right ballpark.
---
is power tempest good in raids? or is sword weaver the only option?
---
or does it not matter too much?
---
&gt;they have been foreshadowing Aurene's revival for several episodes
---
They've been foreshadowing her DEATH for several episodes, never her revival. Even after she ate Joko, they never implied she may be able to revive because of it.
---
If you want to defend the shitty writing, be my guess, but do not just throw out lies or bad interpretations of the story just to defend your point. People in this reddit are way too easy to dismiss bad writing.
---
Confirmed! this worked for me
---
I remember a few months ago (or maybe even more) there was a reddit post about a new overlay in development. Looked like a completely new window but in the same aesthetic as other gw2 ingame UI, with an asuran golem as a logo IIRC.
---
Does anyone have a name, link to the homepage or to that reddit thread? I'd like to see if it's available already or what's the progress on it.
---
took them long enough.
---
Same except when I get home from not wanting to be working I get to stare at my computer with the blown power supply.
---
And of course the replacement was the only part of my Amazon order that could not be shipped next-day.
---
Well unless Kralk eats her that is, that is how Joko died.
---
It IS bad writing to have Aurene eat Joko and then ignore it for multiple episodes like it didn't even matter until it happened to be necessary to the plot.
---
I am genuinely sorry that happened and I hope your power supply can arrive swiftly :/
---
Anyone know if a vendor has  Endless Shadow Warrior Tonic?
---
so, when do we get sclerite and embellished ? :D
---
hey bro.. do you have more?
---
im new for this game and its too late to the code
---
And like tens of thousands of USD in "man hours."
---
Then answer me o Lord of wisdom.
---
Taking into account she had Joko's power, why did her visions foreshadow HER DEATH and never her Resurrection? There was an entire episode of Aurene freaking the fuck out because every vision she has is of her death, remember that? Why did her visions not show her that she'd come back?
---
Both necro types are vulnerable to bursting with a little cc control. Against a scourge, try and bait out his cc chain. If he catches you in it, good chance he can get enough dots to kill. Reapers generally dont have autoshroud on health, once in shroud he will have about 10 seconds of stability. Kite him around till its out, and kill asap. Do alot of that mesmery crap that drives me up the wall trying to find the right you. Lol

---
&gt;Aurene's death in the moment felt impactful
---
I didn't finish the episode until a couple of weeks ago, so I knew what happened already, but it was still very powerful. Strangely enough, that walk towards Aurene's body reminded of the beginning of Mass Effect 2 after your ship gets wrecked by the Collectors.
---
&gt;the fact that she's back now doesn't change what you felt back playing the previous episode
---
I would argue that just having Aurene swoop down and eat Joko was more of a cop-out than resurrecting her. GW2 writing has never been great, but I also don't know any other MMO with great storytelling.
---
Really?
---
You can only use the new item once per hour. And I still have so many teleports left in my bank.
---
Not entirely, If anyone absorbs enough magic out of anything it dies. So anyone can kill her , they just need the exact way.  Joko couldve been killed by anhthing other than aurene, but it would require to  pretty much absorb or remove all his magic from him, a feat very few creatures in the world can. Apparently Dragons are like that and some other denizes of The Mists ( The Human Gods? Spirits of the Wild maybe?)
---
Finally my Maine Coon can live within the game!
---
Praise Joko!
---
Agreed on the invalidating her death! I would've been happier to see her return further down the line or something, but literally 2 mins in and she's back? What the hell! Can you imagine a new player coming into this and doing the living season stuff back-to-back? That'd be kinda hilarious honestly lol. 
---
Not sure what you mean on the 3 story part, though! I haven't heard of that
---
They're applying it retroactively to non-Asura too. When you defend the egg in S3 for example, the Exalted talk about their *technology* being centuries old.
---
Depends. They have different DPS profiles. Tempest has higher burst but lower long term dps.
---
There is a dedicated reddit thread for story go use that.
---
First of all, if you are gonna shit on something, at least give valid arguments. Of course they did it for the money, because they are employees. Making something for money doesn't mean that it's bad, it's how planet earth works.
---
They've been foreshadowing both death and rebirth for the last 3 episodes. There's such a thing as *implicitly implied*. There was a reason they showed Joko getting back up shortly after you killed him. The only way he was going to die was by being chopped into pieces or eaten. So they had aurene eat him. Those two events, within minutes of each other, imply exactly what happened.
---
Not everything has to be explicitly implied/showed for it to be "good" foreshadowing.
---
I haven't finished, is there really no teaser for season 5? I was looking forward to that.
---
You can tell these are inspired by, or edited from some costumes that exist like ice-encased or viper armour. Still, nice with new armour :)
---
Huge grats! That's an exceedingly large amount of work. How did you get that all done?
---
Oh god please stop
---
I had wished for a bit longer of the episode without Aurene, to feel that the dragon is really gone, but nope, she back so fast, that it's like she wasn't gone at all.
---
Go to your gw2 folder, then into the \bin64\ folder, and delete d3d9.dll and d3d9_arcdps_buildtemplates.dll
---
Burning forests? That sounds magical o.o
---
the corruption steemed from the absurd amounts of magic that Kralk was afflicted with - something Jormag and Primordus probably are also dealing with, since they were both affected by Mordremoth's and Zhaitan's death. Although they got put back to sleep, what made Kralk go completely insane in hunger was Balthazar's magic.
---
Aurene Marvel is probably the best name. Or Captain Aurene.
---
And someone that agrees with me, that the story felt really short. Took me a little over an hour to finish!
---
that was... that was pretty good. left me wanting more, but that entire final sequence was fantastic!
---
Much appreciated!
---
That’s a lot of spare time right there
---
There is a dedicated thread for story use that.
---
let us hope
---
Good to hear!
---
Any word on when we can expect the build templates?
---
Range kills necros. To kill a reaper simply condi them and kite while they're in shroud. You can play defensively from their main damage and let your dots tick down shroud. Avoiding reaper shroud should be hilariously easy for you as a condi mirage since you have access to teleports, invuln and evade on demand, and stealth. As for scrouge it's basically the same thing just watch out for the shade drops and try not to facetank them. All in all you should really never lose to either class as a mesmer but when you say you're running a "condi hybrid" build I suspect this is the reason. Either go full condi and ensure your dots are strong enough to get through necro cleanse/convert or play a man's build and go power shatter. You'll be able to burst shatter necros at range while they are helpless.
---
&gt;OMG  [Mistborn Band](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/421365201397481503/577915830222716970/unknown.png) 's icon is actually Armbrace of Truth from GW1!
---
So no gold sink??? YES!
---
Ok, so, krakatoilks final word was "mother" what makes me really intrigued about that. Maybe he was talking about Lyssa?
---
Copper Fed Salvage O Matic. Really save you the hassle of buying salvage kits, especially during an events. Those green and normal gears will stack, and with this you can salvage them on the fly.
---
This is really bad, sorry. Congrats on the sword and I do enjoy the animations on the weapon, but this video is very poorly done.
---
It's mostly due to camera angles. Whirls should be shown from above, slashes and throws from the side, etc. The way it is now you can barely even see half of the transformations. Just feels like this was done as quickly and with as little thought put into it as possible to get it out and get those sweet sweet views from all the hyped people. Tekkit did a really good job on his video, might learn a thing or two from him.
---
I mean they were worshipping titans and destroyers before. That could happen again
---
Then i'm pretty sure your installation is corrupted, that bug was solved months ago. I've never got it again.
---
I know this might not be an option for everyone, but the bug doesn’t seem to occur when you use mounts skins (I.e. not using the default skin). I run the game on 7ear old Mac hardware and as soon as I use the default skins, say on a new character, the bug reoccurs, but I haven’t seen it on my main ever since getting the exosuit mount pack (high I probably would never have bought if I hadn’t seen a comment on this reddit suggesting that only default skins had the issue).
---
wish the build up in the first instance was a little longer, but otherwise they did a really good job this episode in all fronts
---
that map is nice
---
Full condi mirage or shatter mirage will beat an equal skill necro/scrouge any day of the week. Not even a contest at that. Both scrouge and reaper burst are exceptionally easy to avoid as a mirage with on demand invuln dodges. Being able to burst condi and effectively disengage the fight in stealth or through mobility while the necro dies, then do this repeatedly means a mirage should never die to a necro unless they are utterly wombo combo'd.
---
You really thought showing Joko getting back up as foreshadowing that Aurene would do it too? REALLY? 
---
Thank you for showing how dense you actually are.
---
What are you referring to exactly?
---
Oh my god, this is beautiful.

Sooooo... HPV anyone???

Soooo no mention of what we'll be up to in season 5 right? Kinda disappointing
---
The Elder Dragons are neither good nor evil. They are forces of nature. A part of the worlds natural cycle. Kralkatorrik was doing what an elder dragon does. But by consuming these different kinds of magic, the torment appeared, and he went off the hinges. 
---
Based on Kralks dialogue, their energies are likely within Aurene. "These magics should be within you" or something along those lines. As for upcoming content, my guess is, the death of the old elder dragons, and the rise of a new one, causes major change in the world. Perhaps well see a new era of GW2. Or we just kill Steve since he is still out there.
---
They set up a drama, fed us with sad stories for a half a year and magically in the very first minutes it all doesn't matter, just because of some cheap shit. Even if eating Joko was leading to ressurection of Aurene, then do it in the middle or even in the end of an episode. Give drama time IN GAME to work properly.
---

How often do you use the tp that the cd will be a issue? That and it’s just their so people don’t flood the map with tp merchants

For trinkets.  Only use for them, just like Kourna for backpiece.  After you get all the skins, kralkatite and mistonium are p useless and diviner's gear is the only use for masses.  Difluorite is going to be relevant for as long as people need PoF stats.

A *ton* of foreshadowing happens and then when it happens this episode people get upset. You can't please everyone.

But why do you dislike it? We finished kralks story, which started at path of fire... I wouldn't like it at all if it took 3 more years to just finish kralks story.. Things need to end. Now we move on to one of the remaining elder dragons? A different threat who knows
---
Damn those precursors for Exordium are actually very cool skins.
---
This aint Game of Thrones bro like what were you expecting? I told what was exactly gonna happen in this episode literally like months ago. I'm overall happy with the finale.

Why was Kralk's last word "Mother"?
---
The dodges were nerfed but are still very effective. It is still incredibly difficult to lock down a skilled mirage on any class...and I main cc spam holo. Neither a reaper nor a scourge can lock down a mirage who is awake. Without being cc'd the scourge shade is never going to do enough damage to be relevant as mirage has a plethora of options to mitigate it. Not to mention most scourge simply shade on their own person if you actually push them melee along with utilizing melee range options like that sand trail bs. Melee on a scrouge is asking to die unless you're aware that you're clearly above your opponent. Scourge range is trivial unless we're counting scepter auto as some sort of high damage weapon...which it isn't. Minion masters don't actually do any damage so this issue is because of OP's build being subpar. You would merely need to kill the necro and ignore the minions as they do next to nothing. Whittling through necro barrier/shroud doesn't require timing it simply requires sustain which mirage has plenty of. Applying dots while shroud is active to burn it down while they can't cleanse is key and interrupting the consume conditions will net the win right then and there. The entire issue I can gather from OP's post is he merely doesn't do enough damage which is further evidenced by his "condi hybrid" statement as anything with decent burst paired with stealth/mobility will have zero issue with any necro build. Mirage wins this everytime equal skill.
---
Are you able to upload a video showing all skills, regardless of whether you can detect a difference?
---
Well, yeah. IW+Endgame are multibillion dollar blockbusters build off of a decade of shared storytelling and the whole point if Endgame was to try to bring everyone back.
---
Season 4 chapters 5 and 6 don't seem to be even trying to mirror that. It's fine to have high standards but there was no way these two dofferent stories were going to be directly comparable.
---
How do you have the time/gold? I've been making Binding of Ipos for about a year or so and I'm burnt out - I've only just crafted Ars Goetia!

Little tip: don't use asura mesmers for showing up greatswords, their autoattack animation doesnt make the GS spin around like other classes do.
---
My first mesmer was an asura, i use condi builds on him just for that
---
Well, there was all that season 2 stuff where we play as Caithe and see the events that shaped Faolain's ideology (meeting the asura and Wynne with the centaurs)

theres some kind of meta, but i didnt explore the map past the story yet
---
https://imgur.com/a/zf4nX8E another one
---
Not sure but I was kinda hoping it would end like this. For a long time now, things have just been escalating to a breaking point; we couldn't keep that pace going forever without things starting to lose meaning. Pretty much, since core we made a bomb and every expansion just made it bigger, so it is nice to finally see it defused.
---
I'm sure S5 will start to build up whatever the new threat is. As for what it could be, I wouldn't mind a less world-ending threat for a change; kinda like Joko was... Well, before the world-ending plague was brought into the mix. While I am in no rush to go back to Cantha, tensions there could be the next threat. Also, we did put Jormag and Primordius back to sleep, but for how long? And there is a history of Elder Dragons awakening to destructive effect, so... I suppose that is a smaller but still threatening ticking time bomb.
---
Don't include the new map name in the title...if ArenaNet didn't want to announce the map name, some will find it as a spoiler.
---
 &gt; If OP wants to post his build we could probably help more.
---
Good idea, if they see this hopefully they can!
---
u/whitecr0w, follow this [link](http://en.gw2skills.net/editor/), recreate your build if you can, and share it? Without seeing your exact traits, utilities, and stat combinations it is rather hard from this point to offer any further advice.

It's good that it's secret, it's not like more than 1% of the game population will ever use it.

Even thou whole episode left me with some question, I definitely enjoyed it, visually, music, scenery, well it was a bit rushed but somehow I  liked the idea of him pined down and whole "inside" battle, I know some people expected something else, but same like with books we don't always get what we want and I am happy it ended with "hope" and "happiness" even if it was in a bit obvious way. Also so happy this chapter ended and can't wait what new season will bring, even if it will be another elder dragon.  
---
As off note the new map is gorgeous, some places gives me total Aion vibes with floating lights and plants.

Getting these ears maybe?
---
To the risk of being downvoted to hell and back, I'll say it: this finale was terrible, and a let down after Episode 5's dramatic and climatic ending. For many reasons.
---
For one, Aurene revived. I'm sorry, but no. Last episode had a perfect dramatic climax. Trailer showed that. But in 5 minutes and a clic of a button, here she is, back to life, without a scar. It ruined the climatic ending from last episode, and all its consequences. On top of reducing to zero the threat of failure since now she's more or less invincible until someone sucks all the magic out of her.
---
Adding to above point, Aurene was just revived, and not only does she not bare any sign of setback from this state, but she is stronger than before, to the point of cutting off clean one of Kralkatorrik's wings in a single blast. Where does that even come from?
---
Cutscene to Kralk being downed, falling in the middle of the ocean. The OCEAN. We even hear the splash. Underwater content (even though I despise it)? Nope. Magically out of nowhere, islands, with Kralk's body conveniently laying there. But not only. Also, Pact camps, equipped with doors and holobridges. When was this built? No idea, we don't have time for plotholes, move along please.
---
Cue a series of open world missions that I didn't mind but felt incredibly rushed (I can see previous issues of story pacing resurging), conveniently accessible locations for plot reasons, and a Kralk that isn't all so bad and would almost ask for an anime kind of redemption arc (even though Kralk has always been devouring things left and right without discrimination and that way before even Zhaitan), all to end in a fight that clearly lacked the epicness of Episode 5's fight, with little to no mechanics, and Aurene who becomes some sort of Elder dragon god, leaving to... do Elder dragon things? I guess? No idea, but as mentioned previously, no time for plotholes.
---
I had hoped the layoffs, although dramatic and sad, would be a wake-up call for the writing team, to try and push the quality up. I was sorely mistaken. And at that point, I'm even starting to just give up on the story altogether.
---
Oh dear lord rip charr heavy
---
What am I missing here? Does the new armor set require cauliflowers
---
Twss...
---
Doesn't work.
---
The item says:
---
&gt;Double-click to be taken to a random location in Tyria.
---
And wiki says:
---
&gt;It only takes you to maps in Central Tyria (core-game maps). As such, it does not take you to any maps released with Heart of Thorns, Living World Season 3, Path of Fire or Living World Season 4 etc.
---
So yeah, kinda pointless for trying to unlock expansion WP's
---
Steve.
---
Who the he'll are you and where did you get this kind of time?
---
Guess I didn’t phrase it that well, I’ve since leveled 2 toons to 80 so I got my worth out of it. Just saying when I first started I shouldn’t have done that right away and instead of just spent time learning.
---
Kralkatorriks last word was "mother", wasnt it? Who/What is is mother? Has there ever been a mention of his parents?
---
They ... they more than scratched Kralkatorrik. He was bleeding heavily. The reason Aurene was able to hurt him was because he was in such beatup shape.
---
Just to be sure: You clicked on the green star on the rigth above the map when you logged in, right?
---
Wait, BOLT is your favorite? The Gen 1 sword? 
---
I mean I HAVE Bolt and even I don't like it that much. Would have made the Gen 2 sword instead but I made Bolt ages ago before they had it.
---
Based on him saying previously "But you are of me. And I will be of you", perhaps thats referring to Aurene? Which is kind of confusing, but I guess it makes sense?

Was about to say this same thing. Many people forget that there is a correlation between game time and irl time. In game she has been dead for about as long as it has been since episode 5 dropped.
---
Oh boy.... Any tips for an inspiring Legendary crafter 😅?
---
Did you click the green bouncing star above your map to actually unlock the episode on your account?
---
Is it permanently unlocked or only for a short time?  The vendor(s) I mean
---
Did you try clicking "Continue This Story" under Living World Season 4 to see if it forces it to unlock?

How are the achievements?

Is the achivy meta long?

Thanks for sharing your feelings and experiences. I loved reading through this - I did skip the parts I still haven’t played yet (I’m behind, I know). 
---
I was fully expecting this to be a “goodbye” post, or a “it was fun while it lasted, but [last straw]” type of post. I’m so glad it wasn’t!
---
While I haven’t played since the very beginning, I can relate really really well to a lot of what you talked about, and it made this really fun and satisfying to read. Thanks, OP!
---
yo with the first sentence it makes it look like you like FSP and the underwater weapons better; you got the arrow direction wrong
---
Yeah, it's also a bit of a missed opportunity to have the Commander at complete breaking point and not handling things well. Sure, they were down and hopeless but it didn't last long enough to do anything with and they still leading even then. 
---
But that's just what I would have liked to see and some players wouldn't like that with their character.
---
Love this. Do you do prints?
---
The whole map is one huge Meta as far as I can tell. Feels like a combination of Dragons stand and verdant brink.
---
I haven't actually got to play the new bit yet, but remember it's not just development time. The time between episodes for us is roughly the same length of time in game.
---
The episode did feel a bit short; I think it took me like 2~ hours while previous could take 3~ or so. But perhaps that is just because I expected a finale to be a bit longer. It did follow the normal pattern (opening instance, 3 steps in the new map, closing instance), but others featured more story instances (e.g. S4E1 had 2 at the end back to back); though if you could the epilog separately so did E6. I'm not sure where the story could/should have been longer, so I suppose it did its job.
---
As for Kralk, I think the torment came with the magic. It may be more like Dragon are a sponge for magic than that they eat magic; they may not have much of a choice if they absorb it or not. So when Death Dragon Magic, Nature Dragon Magic, and Fire God Magic all end up in Kralk, I can see how that could be undesirable if they clashed. The mental manipulation of torment... Not sure how exactly that came to be but I see that more as part of Kralk's mind from eons of being an Elder Dragon and dealing with this than some corruption inflicted upon him.
---
And I kinda like that we didn't get any teasers. We've been having things build up and the situation get worse and worse for years now. It is nice to close off this chapter with things resolved without setting up or hinting at some new problem. There is all of S5 to build up a new threat so it is nice to have a resolution for a change.
---
Was thinking the same thing..
---
“This guy must really hate bolt,” until I got to Gen 2 and got even more confused
---
Ok that is the most important part of this release. The MMO part
---
you could have gotten this for free if you played during the last month or so
---
Players had not one, but two chances to obtain the episodes without gems. Further, it's a couple hundred gems. Convert some gold to gems. Don't have the gold? Farm it. Get some achievements for some gems, too. Ta-da, no money spent.
---
I’ve been reloging and going back in but it’s still stuck for me.
---
"I am a casual gamer, I can't afford to farm gold to gems with the 15 minutes I get to play each century"
---
I wish Kralkatorrik shouted "MARTHA" at the end.
---
Aurene wasn't really a part of the actual fight against Joking, though. The fact that she managed to swoop down at the exact moment we needed her, and not earlier, is kind of jarring. To compare it to GoT, it was like Arya jumping in out of no where to kill the Night King.
---
Amen to that!
---
No, her coming back (so soon) makes previous episode absolutely meaningless.
---
It definitively looks like a Menzies servant. Also, I remember some similar looking champion in the new map.
---
Why is that sylvari about to slap the shit out of her “friend”?
---
Unfortunately IMO what they ended up with is a awkward halfway point that doesn't work in either direction. They aren't neutral or blank enough to work as self insert or feel like you can write much of their personality yourself and they don't have enough of personality to be interesting. They  have been progressively less neutral as time goes on.

honestly I have several stacks of consumable ones why in the FUCK would you have me wait 1 hour between uses of this rechargable porter?!
---
That is super nit-picky but I hate how the map fits into the world map. It just looks super out of place.
---
I think it's more about the feeling of sacrifice, where the death of Aurene was way underplayed and was a missed opportunity to a commander who never failed. She came back too quickly for these feelings of defeat to actually affect the story and to grow the characters. 
---
When Peter Parker died, it had a huge effect on Tony, he basically lost his son off the defeat. This mirrors Aurene's death where the commander and caithe lost their daughter. 
---
This had a huge impact on Tony, forcing him to change his world view, from a somewhat selfish person to doing whatever it takes to bring back his son. We did not get any of that feeling here in ep6. Aurene just pops back in 2 minutes into ep6. This is not epic, this is not impactful, this is just a jebait. 
---
It doesn't have to be a billion dollar blockbuster to have a good and impactful story.
---
They literally gave the episodes for free the pasts weeks.
---
uh yeah, that's probably the wildest part of the whole episode to me... THE ORIGIN OF THE ELDER DRAGONS?? oh boy
---
Story only takes around an hour.
---
Rogues, man.
---
Is this mount required for raids? No. For PvP? No. For fractals? No. For fun and cosmetics? Yes. There you go.
---
I don't think they explicitly stated no expansion, but their wording was very heavily loaded towards there won't be one, it's basically confirmed there is no expansion in foreseeable future, just continued story updates.
---
People are going to love the shit out of Dragonfall.
---

4 silver. my best guess is that you use them to buy the mistbloomed armor from the volatile magic vendors.
---
now imagine what you could have done with all that time.
---
Downvoted for using "leggies", but upvoted for typing "legendary" in the description. I almost had you.
---
Glint when she was about to die couldn't see her demise only the battle before it. Aurene actually saw her supposed demise. 
---
&gt; **Glint**: I am not yet prepared to face the Elder Dragon—and distressingly, I cannot see beyond the coming battle.
---
&gt; **Glint**: Is it because I die? I can't die without finishing my work. I have to stop Kralkatorrik.
---
Maybe a new player should get the sweet other 5 mounts first....
---
I mean... Aurene is a fucking Elder Dragon now, that's pretty much enough to me
---
Nothing for us to speculate on for Season 5 :/
---
I like a nice, tidy ending but it feels like I could drop the game forever and it would have a nice ending. I want something to have me wondering, guessing, and watching hundreds of hours of Wooden Potatoes about while waiting for S5.
---
What kind of grind do you mean? Grinding gold to buy a lot of tradeable materials, or doing repetitive activities for items you can't buy?
---
First generation legendary weapons are generally less expensive in terms of raw gold than their second generation counterparts. However, first generation legendary weapons require 100% core world completion, which can take a lot longer than 100% HoT map completion.
---
You can also just outright purchase any first generation legendary weapon on the Trading Post for gold. In some cases it's actually a better deal to do so, most notably in the case of the greatsword Eternity.
---
"MARTHA!"
---
It's not so bad when shes speaking normally, pretty on point. But when she gets excited it's off. More so when Aurene is also talking
---
Pretty much this. Now that the pacing has slowed  down the writers have freedom again to explore new lines of story. So much of this story was a sprint, now we can slow down and maybe explore other places in the world.
---
May I bother you with a question about an issue that appeared after installing d912pxy? It's not something serious and I don't know if it happens because of one or the other.
---
Doesn't lead the story into any direction.
---
Rox probably wants to leave dragon's watch and stay with the ohlmakhan.  Weird she wasn't on the ship though. Poor rox got sided til the end lol
---
That was one of the highlights of the episode honestly.  I just burst out laughing.
---
Aurene sounds like my little pony.
---
Canach made a bet with I think Zalambur’s casino that we’d kill Balthazar. We did so he won, and he went double or nothing on us killing Kralkatorrik. Canach is the cauliflower man
---
* A unique circumstance that didn't use traditional resurrection.
---
* Nope. He never died. There's a difference.
---
* I've not played today's release, so we'll see (please do not spoil in response), but I doubt it based on how all other ED-gaining-new-powers works (Joko is no demigod nor ED candidate, he is just a mere lowly lich and has no special magic domains to gain; ED do not gain others' spells at all, and magic domains from lowly creatures).
---
* Both Trahearne's VA and Eir's VA still does work for GW2, Rox had her VA changed when the original couldn't do it anymore, so the contract thing is BS.

---
They wrote themselves into a corner, the commander has not enough personality to be interesting and allow for character development, but also had just a little too much personality to be relatable. Never had I felt like the commander is myself. I have always thought I'd the Chander as a boring character who never had development.

Kralk's last words were "Mother" so that could be something to speculate about ^^
---
Thats like 6 weapons per year. And maybe 2 per month. Great archivement.
---
Right?! Kind of strange that none of the characters talked about that (when it even is a big deal), but maybe then it would be too obvious...
---
"Mother"
---
gen2 are just more expensive
---
for the stuff that you can't easily put a price on because they are account bound, they are more or less the same
---
you have to complete it.
---
Rox probably wants to tell Braham that she is joining the Olmakhan (and thus won't be able to adventure with him anymore). It was hinted at during the last episode during one of the meta events.
---
I think it’s just that what they tried to pull doesn’t work well with a cliffhanger because the expected emotional response is weakened after the long wait.
---
If this was played literally back to back with the last episode or if Aurene made her return after some quick dramatic moments it works well during the climax to have a low segment where everything was going well but the heroes stumble just to rise back and jump back right into the final fight, which is kind of what happened.
---
But having the last episode ending in a very depressing note and marking a pause in the story heightened the stakes of her death in a way that we expected at least some struggle to overcome Kralkatorik that didn’t happen at all.
---
How does one acquire this resource?
---
Well a lot of times they story has some artificial bloat with renowned hearts, if youre like me you go off the path at those points and explore around which puts me at a couple hours for each chapter the first time through.
---
what about players that start playing in a year?

Final episode of Living World Season 4! It sounds like you have a lot of catching up to do though until touching that.
---
I don't understand why this community has an obsession with Lyssa. Kralkatorrik is a dragon and he is from Tyria, Lyssa is a god who (as far as we know) came from another world like the other gods. How can you see any connection except sharing a color scheme?
---
I hate synthetic bismuth!

True, i do that as well, but i took that out of the ‘few hours’

I tend to spend a week or-so on the entire story, but i also tend to map complete most of it before i do the final chapters (because the drifting to the side stuff)

I will agree with  many people that I didn't like how we went from dead Aurene to Aurene downing Kralky, and the almost too cheesy bowtie ending is almost anime like - Like, this is the time for the filler arcs to happen (maybe that's what the other games were supposed to be) 
---
But I like that we have some kind of ending. That breathing room is needed IMO, maybe we got there a little clunkily, and maybe the threads for the next adventure weren't seeded as obviously as people seem to need, but it allows for a reset of things that never really let up since season 2.
---
 I'll disagree with people that there's 'nothing' to speculate or look forward to.  Imbalance of magic, Cantha, the other Dragons, there's still so much other shit we could cover.
---
How do we break that Stone wall at The 'descent' part?
---
Lmao at least you don't have to ask friends to play through the part of story where aurene is creating portals and then using skill4 because game stops responding after each try of using this skill XD

Long time since I last checked. Are they dirty cheap even if I need 500 of them for each stellar weapon? (I'm a bit of a collectionist myself)

---
Dang, overall I found the episode far more satisfying than a lot of folks here seem to. I would have like a *bit* more build up with Aurene's resurrection and with the introduction of Skyscales, but I feel like the meat of the episode (that is, the everything from arriving in the new map to the end) was well paced and good payoff for the buildup and previous skirmishes with Kralk from the last episode and the rest of the season!

Intrigued to see where we'll go from here.

Yes and if things go south in this places we now have ED Aurene the Immortal Mortal Loving Dragon, ending every conflict as she swoops by. Just in case. Great. I can't wait to see what's up next. Sorry I am just upset about this episode, I'm quitting for today, maybe I can see the positive things tomorrow.
---
Sadly not as fast as these useless threads which pop up daily.
---
That's true, I still think the 1h cooldown is fair, though I personally rarely ever use them(accrued a stack of the regular ones over the years).
---
Even if people use it often, it does save one use of a black lion consumable every hour.
---
Hell yeah! I like the new map's meta. Best of all HoT maps
---
Thing is, gw2 puts a massive dps penalty on ranged weapons since they have such a big pvp advantage with being ranged. But in PvE, range is irrelevant, especially since you need to stay relatively stacks to get buffs and not mess up mechanics. This means you get the dps penalty of range, without any value from being ranged. 
---
Also, if your preferred mode is fractals, if you go condi, you’ll eventually hit a ceiling. Condi works when groups aren’t very good and won’t pump out enough dps to burn down an enemy. In groups that know rotations, mobs in fractals wont live long enough for most condi classes to actually get enough dps ticks in. So in low tiers and normal t4 groups you’ll be mostly fine, but in cm groups, you’ll be useless to the point of being kicked.

Great Story :) I like where this is going :D
---
Loved it, though Anet, why do you hate condi? that 2nd boss in the last quest was stupid...
---
Plus humans have Balth's hounds as a racial skill, and owners of the heroic edition of core GW2 get Mistfire Wolves.
---
*And necromancy*
---
Okay, what about Canach though? Did he have any presence during this Episode?...
---
Polygon Wild.
---
Volatile Magic :)
---
&gt;Not to mention, when Arenanet did that (Taimis machine, dragon energies, all that stuff), people called it a "Deus ex Machina". People just dont know what they want.
---
People know what they want, at absolute minimum, not kindergarden tier storytelling.
---
There's difference between toddler grade predictability and asspulls.
---
Anets forshadowing is either so predictable its not even funny "oooh, she ate the undead lich that comes back from the dead and then she died, i wonder what happens next, only a mastermind could possibly guess our deep plot!"
---
Ya, now that's some DEEP storytelling! You know why so many people including me were surprised when this happened? Because it was so ridiculously cheap and obvious, that we thought anet was TOO competent to use this get out of jail free card. I expected some actual consequences from the story, especially when it came to the death fo a critical character. Not for it to be immediately undone in literally the next mission.
---
Speaking of consequences, the whole point of the episode was that foreign magic in dragons harms them and drives them insane...
---
Unless said dragon is aurene. Then she's free to use and abuse joko as much as she wants!
---
&gt;Taimis machine
---
Ah yes! Everyone's other favourite thing! The are complete unforshadowed asspulls "Oooh, the two elder dragons are about to destroy the world, what's that? Oh a literall god came down and put both of them to sleep using a machine who's parameters were never actually explained or defined?" 
---
To say "people don't know what they want" is beyond retarded. The writing the last few seasons has been bad when you seriously critically examine it.
---
The writing does not have to be breaking bad tier, but this is just embarassing. The core campaign story while very plain, at least had some cause and effect. The consequences of your actions were clear, and how you got to your goals made sense. But from heart of thorns onward it just became asspull after asspull.
---
 For a game that markets itself on its story that's not excuse, especially considering this episode was in the works for half a year.
---
Aight, i got a quick question. After getting myself underleveled by mostly doing heart quests, i found out i should be mainly doing the events and use heart quests as fillers. Is there any way to spot/find the events using the world map, or do i just have to run around and hope for the best whenever i manage to get into an area too high of a level for me?   
---
if that makes sense.

---
My guess is we’ll get some of those current events leading up to the new season
---
adding to what you said...
---
GW2's story has never been incredibly plot-twisty or unpredictable, the good stuff lies in the execution and other than a place or two, they manage to land the story beats as well as they can which is what makes the story enjoyable to me, personally, of course, that's subjective
---

Number 6 is North of Mosswood high in the branches. North West of the Mist Warden Camp and south of Gnarlgrove.

And, funnily enough, daily-gated shit is what drove me away from the game.
---
Glad it at least works on some people.
---
I haven't gotten all the way through but if I understand it correctly the islands are chunks from the three Mist realms we visited while hunting Kralky (Melandru's Domain, The Underworld, Balthazar's(?) land aka Fissure of Woe). They probably tagged along somehow (don't ask me how I wouldn't know) when Kralk shattered the terrain in the mists (aka when we avoided the debris), and fell with him when we shot him back into Tyria. Kralk is pinned down by these islands so common sense says they came after he fell, meaning they weren't there originally.
---
As for the pact being set up, I can't really explain story-wise other than maybe the airships were preparing to set up a base camp and watched Kralk's movements via the tracker.
---
I do agree though that Aurene's revival was kinda lame. But Praise Joko.

Aurene showed us herself, as an elder dragon, a new kind of elder dragon, who loves Tyria and cares about the mortal races...a benevolent elder dragon, if you will
---
kralky did call for his mom, it appears in the text box
---
Aurene revives herself on the first mission, removes the power inhibitor from her neck, chases kralkatorik through the mists and blasts his entire wing clean off with a single blast, he falls back to tyria, we kill him and she becomes a new elder dragon by absorbing his power.
---
Click the gear in the top right corner and select combine bags, also happy cake day!
---
Aurene died in the last chapter and it was the point of absolute destruction for months. It was the loss of hope.
---
Now she just came back from the dead after having been speared and corrupted and turned crystal by a full elder dragon blast because "lol she ate Joko she is invulnerable now". Then she immediately blasts off one of Kralkatorrik's wings even though she's the size of one of his teeth. He gets bombarded and dies while you are busy doing fucking busywork. Then you climb into his mouth and he tells you he never wanted to be evil, it was all that bad magic from the other dragons that made him bad even though he was genociding people for MILLENIA.
---
God, this is the worst collection of plot twists since Onision started writing books.
---
They actually datamined the new skin. [Here's a picture.](https://gamepedia.cursecdn.com/zelda_gamepedia_en/e/ee/Zora_Mask.png?version=769403bde974c0c2c90053185db8f3da)

Define play?
---
I believe there's no gold involved. If there is, it's not much at all
---
:p
---
Scale #13: http://puu.sh/Dsjdi/078e73fd65.jpg It's in a small cave just off of the road that you can see on the map.
---
I'm so happy they played the story straight through! To me it didn't lessen the emotional impact at all.
---
At least it was heavily implied, it wasn’t an asspull or a subversion of expectations
---
It takes a lifetime yea...
---
Can I borrow one? Nice collection though hopefully soon I’ll be able to build one of my own
---
Thanks Ed for writing an amazing article for us :)
---
Praise Joko
---
This forshadowing in specific was insanely lazy, because it was more predictable than a sunrise. 
---
Forshadowing does mean giving yourself a get free out of jail card for 2 episodes later, it's mean to be subtle and fall into place when you see it happen.
---
Its all for fun really, setting your own goals.
---
It realy felt like the game's story was ending indeed, I was waiting for the credits
---
And I bet the 1h cooldown was put in place to prevent farming, unfortunately.
---
I could live with maybe 10min, but 1h is too much.
---
How do I erase my memory?
---
Some issues appeared on Kralkatorrik's theme one, posting better version.
---
Is this the new expansion codename
---
Its next other than wvw armor, and the ring.
---
Nope. Nothing from Salad boy.
---
Who's Kralky's mother?
---
The most disappointing thing about this episode is that Canach has no involvement, not even one line, in the main story. *Dear Anet, WHY?*
---
Have they ever put pure utility items only in the chests?
---
You might want to try different professions to see if you dont like it in general, or the if the profession is the problem. Generaly speaking, Combat is about 50% of what you do in Gw2?
---
Yes engineer has 4 viable elites but sneak gyro has fallen out of favor alot. Elixer X is hit or miss and warrior just has rampage always, with the cdr though it prolly is better with the coin flip. Mortar kit is subpar imo you use it for 2 fields mainly and the rest is filler. Prime light beam is Meh high risk high reward. All viable but none broken imo

Im so glad I have eternity and hate the new greatsword, it seems so damn bland, there's not even a trail on the weapon when attacking, it's the regular weapon trail. I expected one like shining blade's but there's nothing..
---
Uhhh
---
no they said s5 then 3rd expac
---
Pshh hardly just dodge it or die. /s
---
So, have Kasmeer and Marjory quit Dragon's Watch?
---
Tough to say really, seeing as how many of the things to aim for are connected to the combat in one form or another. There are mini games and activities to play which usually try to modify the combat in a way that’s slightly different than what you would do in the open world, 
---
Do you mind me asking what it is that you generally enjoy in an mmo? Seems like you did some research beforehand, so there’s got to be a few key itches you’re trying to scratch-the world has some very beautiful locations to explore and discover if that’s something you’d like
---
Thanks! Take a look.
---
Don't forget you can join commenders and squads and join them
---
Where do I get them?
---
&gt;  some non-combat things to do: story, achievement hunting, fashion (which I don't care for at all, like zero interest whatsoever), gold farming .... something else?
---
All of those things will or at least can involve combat. Most achievements are going to require some combat related things unless you using the word combat to mean something completely different from its usual meaning.
---
You ever play Mass Effect 3's citadel expansion? We need that. An episode following everybody and having a stupidly good time.
---
A legendary every few months is manageable if you play the game a lot. Just budget 1 hour a day or something to something like istan farm, and do daily fractals (if you enjoy them this isn’t even farming). But this many in 3.5 years is insane. Gotta either be a god at tp or spend a lot of irl money or spend a ton of time istan/sw farming
---
I was so happy to find the Oakheart's Essences throughout the map. They're so handy it's a shame they're not placed elsewhere.
---
Palawa Ignacious Joko be praised! /salute
---
So glad MF gear isn't a thing anymore
---
Type /age and let us know what comes up.
---
Teleport to commanders

HoT meta mix map
---
Well, there you go then. I'm the opposite. I don't really like the guns and the industrial advancements side of GW2. I prefer the pure fantasy of GW1. I use pistols and rifles in classes where you have to, like Engi, but it's not my thing.
---
it was foreshadowed, but not blatant. obvioisly the narrative team was playing it up as a surprise given the way this episode was marketed.
---
caithe could have been used as a conduit to transfer kralkatorrik's magic into some other powerful entity (the pale tree, a human god, glint in the mists, take your pick) via a taimi machine or something.
---
it doesn't really matter though, obviously the story was being planned like this from the beginning. There was a plan to instantaneously revive aurene after she died. That's bad no matter how you slice it unless it happens quickly enough that the death isn't a distinct narrative beat from the rebirth.
---
if they wanted to do something that didn't use aurene they could have set it up during the first half of the season. this series had no internal consistency with regards to what can and cant happen and there's always room for an exception (scientific breakthrough, if you prefer).
---
&gt;removes any drama they pushed with previous episode
---
I don't see how it deleted the story you played.. its a new part, you can still play the old one.. Its still there.
---
&gt;there should be an episode between these two
---
Why? Because YOU want it to be like this? but not ANet from what it seems like.
---
Not every death happens with a build up or a big follow up story just to give everything a reason... do you know how many people die in accidents worldwide in an instant? Shit happens, people fuck up, you can't really do much afterwards... This however has been foreshadowed, thats why people call it predictable... but its really not.. people call everything predictable now.. Look up the infinite monkey theorem on google. Now lets turn it around and don't focus on monkeys writing Shakespeare but on people guessing things... If there is just a tiny bit of information about a story piece people tend to "predict" the ending of it because there are too many people. What they do is guessing... guessing, every time... You can never be 100% sure.. Look at how many other "predictions" there were before the the story came out and how wrong they all are now. Sure some others are a bit more likely than others but calling it "predictable" is so fucking moronic.
---
&gt;With direct transition from aurene's death to her resurrection Anet removed any meaning from this arc.
---
So how long do they have to wait mister "either do it my way or its wrong"? ("They need to", "They should")  
---
How many Episodes?  
---
How many months?  
---
Years?
---
At what point becomes Aurenes resurrection just another Deus ex machina instead?
---
It doesn't remove any meaning at all... The commander and everyone around them were devastated and they have to rethink A LOT of things.. her being alive again doesn't change that.
---
They could easily also just add another limit to it later on and state that by having been revived she can't do X later on which will fuck up everything else they may be going to plan but then have to work around in a different way.
---
Do you feel the same about the home instance node?
---
EVERYWHERE I GO I SEE G2 DISAPPOINTMENT
---
Oh I do hope someone picks up that phone...
---
... because [I F****** CALLED IT!](https://www.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/b6ups3/avenge_the_fallen/ejnmils/)
---
They said already in their roadmap that the next raid will be release a few weeks after the LW release.
---
Hi it’s me your new friend. Send gold now. Kthx!
---
I think it should have no cooldown, but cost a significant amount of gold if you use it in quick succession. Like when you use it once, you get a debuff that makes all uses afterward cost like 10g or something for the next hour.
---
shoutout to /u/cyfinity, real nice dude who got me my start in GW2 raiding many moons ago. Congrats on completing your collection.
---
No since I already do the home instance for other stuff.
---
Remember that line about Joko in episode 3 epilogue? Though i think this was more propaganda based on the halloween diaries
---
or he could have just bought gem and convert to gold buy mats and make them
---

---
I didn’t even know you could reflect them. Literally every group I’ve been in for my 250+ runs jumps the balls or yells at the guy who repeatedly doesn’t.
---
Source?
---
I disagree. It's one of the highest dps classes with pretty strong roam and evasion frames. I think it's damage is overturned for how much defense eit has but that's just my opinion. It has a higher skill cap then most classes but feels broken in the right hands.
---
Meanwhile, people on this sub like "finally after five years" making a gen 1.
---
Aurene is supposed to blast through it. People reported that there is some bug that stops it, try resetting instance.
---
There's several ways to find events.  Your Content Guide will point you towards them when they're nearby, they show up on the world map/mini-map with orange icons, and when you're close to one it'll pop up in the UI under the Content Guide at the top-right with a description of the event and its objectives.  You can tinker with what the Content Guide shows you in the F11 options menu and set it to favour map completion (hearts/points of interest/vistas/etc.) or to favour finding events, or to turn it off entirely, though I don't really recommend that.
---
The starting areas should progress you in levels fast enough to keep up via the hearts, so there's also a chance that you simply turned left when the game meant for you to turn right, and there's an area more appropriate for your level in a different direction.  In the mid-level zones, you might run into more trouble keeping up in levels while exploring, but to handle that (and if your newbie zone troubles continue) you have waypoints available in all five of the newbie zones by default.  If you feel you're stuck or just want some different scenery, you can use a waypoint to go to another race's newbie zone (Wayfarer Foothills in the snowy region, Metrica Province and Caledon Forest in the southwest jungle area, Queensdale in the northwest plains, and Plains of Ashford in the eastern brown plains).
---
&gt; Strange Rock
---
I really hope for anything like that.
---
Every bit of story you complain about has a narrative backup. Aurene revived because she absorbed Joko’s magic. The Lich Magic isn’t immortality but rather reviving over and over again. Just like how we killed him in his palace but he revived. She couldn’t revive before because she had a Brand Crystal in her heart blocking her magic. She cut Kralk wing because he was incredibly wounded from the last fight and during the flying fight Aurene hits him in weak spots many times. And Crystal Magic is the weakness of Kralky.
---
The isles came from the mists, they said that in the cutscene. Aurene blasted a portal in the Mists, the mists were scrambled because Kralky was eating the magic and we pass through several destroyed floating isles from all the realms. 
---
Kralky was unhinged because the different Magics were magic him go “insane”, that’s why he had a Torment inside him. Before he just moved through Ascalon. But not trying to conquer everything, because Elder Dragons are a Force of Nature. He was just chilling in Ascalon but Glint betrayed him so he went to kill her, then went to the Crystal Desert, with Zaithan magic inside him, then Mordremorth died and his magic was absorbed too, he was restless and Balthazar tried to kill him but he ended up absorbing more magic. Thus making him be more Tormented and moving again.
---
It is not bad writing when it has a logic behind and it was developed along the entire GW2 Lore.
---
Any giveaways i am unaware of ? How he did soo much map exploration is beyond me tbh.
---
The guide up there should work, but ur still confused and not sure, and want a more personal approach, please reply to this.
---
Nothing to worry about, gearing toons is fun! Hope you enjoy it.
---
There's always an endless repair, bank, hairstyle, and trading post item in the chest. You can't get them anywhere else (but they are tradeable). It would have been reasonable to assume that an endless teleport item would be in the chest with those.
---
I mean it said preferences saved underneath never got an email,  checked all folders
---
*GAMER FUEL*
---
Well if certainly isn’t meta in pve so I’m not sure where else it would be.
---
Its 25 dollars plus tax for one mount skin. You think that's cheap?
---
You're either rich or paid for them in gold.
---
It's where you stab Kralk with your new spear during the story.
---
I had the same issues, no follow-up email and all.
---
Eeesh, I was hoping this would've been as easy as Beetle was
---
I don't understand why they haven't brought it back. I want it so desperately but I think it was only sold the once.
---
That's half an hour of working. Who got time to farm gold?
---
Yeah, it said that for everyone, but the settings didn't 'stick' until they were confirmed through email. It was a big thing when the promotion was announced, because it was confusing as to why the settings kept resetting.
---
I guess you could try asking support about it.
---
I haven't really played Guild Wars 2 since playing for \~8 months or so during launch, but I'm coming back. What exactly is a "new map"? Like a new zone? I see the living story update but I haven't seen anything about a new map, but I'm also trying not to spoil myself too much because I do enjoy Guild Wars 2's story stuff.
---
But it is already for some encounters, if you want a per encounter basis just ask in sc's public discord.
---
The update just arrive ld wtf... There was no new content two weeks ago...
---
&gt;Why? Because YOU want it to be like this? 
---
Because otherwise it displays incompetence by removing any and all consequences, rendering the previous episode meaningless, removing any and all stakes, and asspulling the story (aurene died before, but now she can blow an elder dragon wing clean off with a single shot)
---
&gt;This however has been foreshadowed, thats why people call it predictable... but its really not.. people call everything predictable now.. 
---
Yeah no. Forshadowing =/= Predictable.
---
Wanna see what actual forshadowing looks like? Play bioshock. What anet did is hand themselves is lazy writing. 
---
&gt;Look up the infinite monkey theorem on google. Now lets turn it around and don't focus on monkeys writing Shakespeare but on people guessing things... If there is just a tiny bit of information about a story piece people tend to "predict" the ending of it because there are too many people. What they do is guessing... guessing, every time... You can never be 100% sure.. Look at how many other "predictions" there were before the the story came out and how wrong they all are now. Sure some others are a bit more likely than others but calling it "predictable" is so fucking moronic.
---
I don't know what this tangent is supposed to even mean, but Aurene eating joko and reviving was so predictable even a 5 year old could have seen it coming. Telegraphing your plot harder than a raid boss telegraphs its attacks is not good storytelling.
---
&gt; So how long do they have to wait mister "either do it my way or its wrong"? ("They need to", "They should")
---
&gt; How many Episodes?
---
&gt; How many months?
---
&gt; Years?
---
&gt; At what point becomes Aurenes resurrection just another Deus ex machina instead?
---
Seriously? If you play both episodes back to back aurene isn't even dead for 10 continuous minutes. 
---
&gt;It doesn't remove any meaning at all... The commander and everyone around them were devastated and they have to rethink A LOT of things.. her being alive again doesn't change that.
---
She's now immortal and 10 times stronger than before. What exactly do they have to rethink? They didn't even to rethink their plan. She just solo brought down kralkatorik on her own and served him to them in a silver plater.
---
Optimus Prime works at Anet lol
---
took me two hours on a chronomancer
---
I've contacted Support and they refuse to do anything. It just sucks I'm missing out on a promotional item for something out of my control.
---
I think it means, that after killing Kralk, now Aurene became an Elder Dragon
---
Dude I've been looking for that POI that you are at for at least an hour, thank you!!!
---
I find it mostly about being efficient and not doddling around. I've done full set of armor and 3 Gen1 weapons (twilight, bifrost, bolt). It took a LONG time to do the armor, a good amount to do twilight, less to do bifrost and bolt I did in about a month. It just comes down to learning where to earn your gold efficiently and targeting your play time around that. Now is this the most fun way to play the game? probably not. Each time I finished a legendary I walked away from the game for a good amount of time. 
---
I personally raided when I could, full clear groups were more efficient than picking off single bosses at a time, and I did my fractal recs and stuff daily as best I could (where I would say most of my money came from).
---
Suppose i might go wander about the zone then or visit another newbie zone.  
---
Currently in Kessex hills at level 19,5 ish with every heart quest up to level 23 ones done. Completed queensdale map at level 15 and headed to kessex after, anything in particular i might've missed, besides more events?
---
pants look pretty okay actually
---
I have they refuse to assist because it was a promotion.
---
last post was on april 30.. what exactly happened since then that needed an update on the site?
---
(edit: and the current patch is 6 hours old..)
---
I've been playing since beta. My legendary count is still 0...
---
Ok, but then why do they want to have their cake and eat it too? If they don't want a gritty dark backstory, why even kill aurene only to ressurect her literally 5 minutes later?
---
I don't like that it gives my charr titties
---
Tou can play naked and enjoy the game.
---
Damn
---
I mean
---
**DAMN**
---
I dont farm gold. And you're amongst a very low amount of people who make over 100k a year. Good for you.  Now stop acting like everyone can afford that and are cheap if they cant.
---
Hell even if I did make 100k a year I wouldnt justify spending 25 bucks on one skin
---
yes karmic retribution and also +% experience
---
Magics.
---
Is it extremely spoilery? I havent done anything after pof yet, I want to "binge" it but I really want the skyscale, of course I already know the big spoilers mostly but like, do you think itll ruin my enjoyment of previous Living world chapters to rush this one? Id make it a voluntarely effort to not remeber it too like playing without sound and shit like that.
---
That is actually a good idea. I would be willing to pay for teleports honestly.
---
Same here :/ I mean I kinda heard a hint here and there on this sub, but nothing so in-your-face :S (I'm still playing through PoF's story.)
---
It becomes a huge ass axe? My god I want it
---
Was wondering the same. It just wasn't the same without his snarky remarks.
---
Excuse me, I prefer the term Joko ex machina
---
Haha wow so an entire zone then? That's really interesting, I'm happy it's great stuff.
---
I thought it was "Marvelous"
---
It's not useful for skipping one waypoint an hour, it's useful for getting new characters out in the world or getting past puzzles
---
I wish I could trade unbound magic for volatile magic.
---
How bout you calm down with this legendary stuff
---
That sounds pretty fantastic, I'm glad there's no shortage of content then haha. Does the new map get added to the requirements for 100% world completion? Or are living story maps kept separate?
---
Ok so i just don't have enough diskspace apparently lol.
---
Kralkatorrik was traversing all of these locations with portals, Aurene creating her portal and throwing Kralkatorrik trough it probably kinda messed up the mists and all of it ended up in once place.
---
[Character Death: More Than Just A Plot Device](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWOy0ryFfhc)
---
crafted or purchased?
---
Damn bud, you need to get that deeps up. I think the kralk instance probably took between 20-30min for me plus another 10min because I got myself stuck under the rubble when the dredge come in and had to reload. All in all take as long as you like to do your story, you're not holding anyone back taking an hour on a boss fight and you get to enjoy the content longer than the story racers who are out here putting up guides exactly 1sec after launch.
---
[DIE BRANDED SCUM HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws4IlC7asEI&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
I've been looking into that, but so far I mostly play my Guard until I find a better class. Other classes are Power Herald, Power/Condi War(as needed) and a Power SB.
---
dissapointed but thats cool . Thanks!
---
They won’t have this episode anyways then... like turn on you brain cells yeah?
---
I thought we were referencing the guy that bought over 100,000 cauliflower from the tp last year
---
Edit: nope I'm just a blind idiot
---
Well that's an easy fix at least man. The new living world stuff is pretty nice. Have fun!
---
I'd call that cheesy, trashy and cheap but not a good storytelling.
---
I found it really weird that Aurene was talking without Caithe all of a sudden and no one paid it any mind. Here's me betting Joko is using Aurene as a phylactery and is actually pretending to be her. Who wouldn't want to be an elder dragon to surpass them all?  
---
He must have been sweating bricks when Braham shouted PRAISE JOKO, but luckily no one takes Braham seriously!
---
Original world completion only requires completing the original launch maps. All maps added after, from Southsun onwards, aren't required and just give better rewards than completing the core maps.
---
WvW maps were also removed from world completion requirements a few years ago.
---
LITERALLY the main thing that I keep talking about and the importance about it.
---
Don't worry, I made sure not to include any spoilers :)
---
Braham overall felt like a much better character this episode. I'd like them to keep leaning more towards this "big brother" route, than the "angsty teenage hard-ass" route they've had him on for so long.
---
Yeah it makes you give medicine to sick Skyscales so give their locations too if possible guys!
---
alright, i'll make sure to remember all this. Thank you again, its much appreciated :)
---
I'm just thinking the mods wasted their time making a separate thread for story nobody is listening the them.
---
Then you can go for ascended set with berserker stats. Ascended gear is account bound instead of soul bound as exotics, meaning you if you create a set for guard, you can unequip anytime you want and move it using bank or shared inventory to power herald.
---
Do weapon types give me different spells? I'm playing a Mesmer and got a staff and I got some new spells. 
---
Not sure if the patch earlier changed anything but I'm just a bit confused.
---
Just hopped back into the game after a long hiatus, did I really just miss this by a couple days? :/
---
It appears other people had similar issues trying to show off the weapon ([1](https://redd.it/bolvth), [2](https://redd.it/bokxyv)). Apparently Asura mesmer GS1 doesn't rotate like other races and GS4 was untestable because it requires a target.
---
Anet might need a little feedback from the partners on how to actually showcase all classes and skills. If partners are just given LA as a test instance, they might be able to attack he crabs/birds on the beach.
---
My blood pressure just rose due to the amount of salt I read.
---
The new Mist Armor that just released. 
---
Sans headgear though, because Charr headgear always look wack.
---
Where’s your armor/back pieces/Aurora?
---
Egg 21 https://imgur.com/a/dJf0Was
---
There is a big gate blocking that path. How do I take it out?
---
Nice dude. Niiice
---
I see, thank you!
---
Have the GW2 armor designers studied fashion design...at all? The proportions are awful, and there are so many confusing elements in this set. Not trying to be a brat, but I see a lot of the same mistakes being repeated in recent armor sets/outfits. I hope whoever designed this one can work on editing their designs in the future - sometimes less is more!
---
Super, mega, **extremely** spoilery.
---
Which is awesome
---
I'm going to say this really slowly. There is a dedicated story thread for a reason why else do you think story threads are being removed.
---
Its both
---
Mesmer?! 😔😔 
---
Thank you though, great showcase of the weapon without a commentary or ridiculous intro.
---
Crickey. Maybe if we had forced you into pharma research rather than GW2 we'd have a cure for cancer by now.    
---
     
---
Impressive.
---
Just came back to the game.  Didn't think they'd put big spoilers in the patch notes...  Especially for something so recent.  :(
---
ive long theorized that the elder dragons weren't born, but came to be that way somehow. so Kralkatorrik the Crystal Dragon was born and had a daughter Glint, then he became Kralkatorrik the Elder Dragon somehow and branded Glint as a way to "save" her and make her immortal. 
---
or smth like that.
---
1. I gathered that, story wise, there were only a few days between EP5 and EP6, the threat of Kralk was already established.... without Aurene there was no way to beat him without destroying the world as well.
---
2. The hinted at her death + revival over the last few episodes leading up. If they didn't, the community wouldn't have been talking about it the entire time.
---
3. Kralk was severely injured from the last fight AND Aurene contains the magic he is weak against.... established in EP5 AND at the beginning of EP6. Also, size isn't an indicator of the power of an elder dragon. 3 Have been killed. Kralk and Zhaitan were similar size while Mordremoth and Primordus were huge by comparison. Aurene is probably a lot more powerful than it appears.
---
This is all pretty standard storytelling. Not great nor perfect by any means, but not the "worst writing ever". There are far worse games and movies out there.
---
Been playing since vanilla and I'm still riding high from making Predator a couple months ago.
---
The part they've neglected since LS3?
---
I remember all the Wildstar peeps who trashed GW2 as they left.
---
Am doing a VM farm and ticking off the dailies in the LS4 zones this week. Have seen the Jahai, Thunderhead and Kourna metas all active and I know the Sandswept Isles one is usually active.
---
Upps...
---
Fixed
---
LMAO, enjoy all of this until the game shuts down or GW3 releases! Waste of time!
---
Those eyes, they'll haunt me
---
There are no shoulders and gloves in the wardrobe and they didn't appear in Shaman's data mining post either so it's safe to assume that, sadly, there are no shoulders and gloves (and probably never will be since War Eternal is pretty much a closure of the Elonian chapter).
---
If you think this is overwhelming you should take a look at the exchange subreddit. Some there shit chak egg sacs.
---
It was so good to see our char in a cutscene again... and it looked SO good.
---
Is Thief good for solo, specifically dual-dagger core-game and deadeye later on in HoT/PoF stuff?
---
Playing since launch and i know how to use the TP for gold
---
I’m surprised they manage this with the engine being what it is. Have to give them rep for this!
---
You're asking if the last episode of the season is spoilery?  Really?  Okay.
---
I bought maybe 3 off the TP rest crafted
---
I kind of felt like the entire map/episode was the fight against him and the last part was just finishing the job. Felt better than either of the last two to me but that may be an unpopular opinion.
---
I just checked and it's working fine for me.
---
*cries in 6years*
---
crazy!
---
They just made the odds way too punishing. I get that these are supposed to be rare items, but a 20 silver rare and crap mats jsut doesn't feel good.
---
It's not that I "want" to be, it's that I've played this mechanic so long that I believe it's what makes GW2 feel less satisfying for me. To be fair, I don't like the dodge only classes in any of the trinity based games either.
---
Are the corsair boots the meta reward from the new map? Can you post them too?
---
&gt; Based on Kralks dialogue, their energies are likely within Aurene. "These magics should be within you"
---
Death. Mind. War. Crystal.
---
Long ago, the four magics lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the Balthazar and the elder dragons attacked.
---
Only Aurene, master of all four magics, could stop them. But when the world needed her most, she vanished.
---
Four months passed and my pact and I discovered the new Aurene, an Aurene named Aurene, and although her crystalbending skills are great, she still has a lot to learn before she's ready to save anyone.
---
But I believe Aurene can save the world.
---
Pretty sure they're talking about a season 4 equivalent of Aurora, not the raid trinket, Coalescence, which will most likely come with the next raid.
---
Story is wonderful, nice closure to Season 4. Map is gorgeous, just odd that its completely cubic on the World Map in the middle of the ocean...
---
I think they underestimated how interesting fighting a force of nature would be. I think if the elder dragons had been more... god like.. with scheming and messing with mortals, the entire story arc could have been deeper and more broad. I think they should have spread them out more so we could have traveled to East Tryia, cantha, and the other continents while working for and against various forces that are either trying to align themselves with the dragons or stand up against them.
---
I really thought it was going to happen. It would fit their style of every victory simply leading us into the next battle.
---
Pre HoT a friend of mine also had a big amount of legys and we were pushing each other to go harder and craft more of them just so pne of us could claim to gave more legys than the other.  We both ended up full legy some months before HoT.
---
After that it became easy to craft a weapon every 3 months or so.
---
I agree, with all the variety this map has, it really does feel like a culmination of all the previous living world instances combined.
---
And there are also souleaters. I wonder what if we were clever enough to take one to our fight with Joko?
---
As in the story mission? What is it specifically that gives you trouble? Did you go with Tizlak, or did you stay and defend? If you stayed, did the legendary boss thing give you trouble? If so, don't bother fighting it, but run around and pick up those things lying around and throw them at it. Maybe look up a youtube video on it if you're super confused.
---
I don't see a code for them, and I haven't played the map to completion yet so I don't have any info on that front yet
---
I think the zone meta is one of the most fun for a while, and it's well-designed and the reward are very, very generous so I see people coming back to it... but... the story was a bit meh. 
---
The flying bit was cool, I guess? I don't really feel like I did very much in it. 
---
Aurene went from cute li'l sidekick to generic hero dragon in, what, an episode and a half? She also repeats her lines in the final encounter, which seemed cheap.
---
And then she turned into a pokémon and flew away.
---
I wouldn't be too critical, they're just trying to be polite is all.
---
Yeah there is an official Aurene plush but it's even more chibi and I didn't like it as much. I know I could sell these but this one took me an entire weekend alone to make and I do not ha w the mental will power to do that again ~and again  and again~ ^ ^ ; oh well. That friend was super happy with it so it was all worth it.
---
Every class has 1-2 usable elites (mesmer, necro, rev and ele doesn't have any good elite to use as core). Also, engineer elite skills are so good I can't decide what to use, however other classes have it easy :P
---
* Necromancer: Chilled to the Bone
---
* Guardian: Invulnerable elite, Mantra elite
---
* Revenant: Glint elite
---
* Mesmer: Gravity Well, jaunt needs to be utility, rest are bad (yes, even mass invis) 
---
* Warrior: Rampage needs nerfs, Signet is nice
---
* Elementalist: Weaver's elite is nice, tempest elite was okayish but now it's bad (engineer has tempest elite as aed...)
---
* Ranger: One Wolf Pack and Strength of the Pack (pretty good elites tbh)
---
* Thief: Daggerstorm (needs nerf)
---
Pshhh dont tell anyone
---
OK, so the final product of those drops is just vendor junk, albeit a rewarding one:)  
---
I'm curious if  the duration of the **Teal Branded Mists** is affected by Utility Primer?
---
Those things made me happy too! Bouncy mushrooms, ley-line and updraft gliding, oakhearts, thermal vents (is that what they're called?), teleport shrines..
---
And the Tornado thing from Jahai too!
---
So nice to see those elements used again.
---
Same here! Thinking of maybe trying to make one soon...
---
I can’t even get past exploding the wall, have tried for an hour now reloging and loging. : /
---
It's no Nightfall but it was pretty enjoyable yeah. I'm happy with it.
---
My bad, I forgot when playing gw2, a game that markets itself on storytelling, I should expect nothing from its storytelling.
---
Considering his reddit user has the tag \[SC\] I'm going to assume selling raids also yields quite a bit, along with perhaps advance knowledge of which rune/sigils will become meta (given build website, not talking inside knowledge)
---
This is why I stopped playing GW. There’s literally no way you got all of those without spending IRL money.
---
I dont know why ANYONE is surprised that Aurene would come back from the dead, and why its considered bad writing.
---
After Zhaitan died, Mordremoth gained his power of death and pestilence and used it to create the Mordrem. Once Mordremoth died, Kralkatorrik absorbed his power. When Balthazar died, Kralk absorbed his magic too and gained more abilities. 
---
The moral of the story is DRAGONS ABSORB MAGIC. Joko's magic was eaten by Aurene, so as a undying lich it should stand to reason that she could resurrect because she gained the ability. Sure it was obvious, but is in no means an asspull since the Joko couldnt die normally anyway and the only way to stop him is for Aurene to eat his magic- thus giving way to the defeat of Joko while still staying within the confines of the rules of the story. This has been *heavily* established already.
---
I do agree with you when you say that Aurene got too powerful too quickly, but id attribute that its not that she was too powerful, its that Kralkatorrik was too weakened. This i cant say for sure so we'll agree to disagree. 
---
Kralkatorrik (and none of the Elder Dragons for that matter) arent inherently evil (though Jormag may be debatable), their mere existence causes death and destruction. They are forces of nature. A tornado does not shred homes out of any sense of malice. Kralk didnt genocide people cause he wanted to, it just happens. This changes when the magics of Balthazar and the anguished Zhaitan and Mordremoth conflicted with his own magic. 
---
The same thing mustve happened with Mordremoth when he absorbed Zhaitan. Plus, Kralk was sleeping for a very long time until he was woken up recently. He wasnt killing anyone on purpose until we woke him up by shoving magic down his throat. I honestly think that this isnt a bad reason. 
---
Also idk why you want incredibly high end writing from this. Sure theres some off spots but i dont see whata wrong with it. What we have is fine.
---
Check temperatures both using the sensors and physically (be careful not to burn yourself!), check PSU, check drivers. You might need fan control software or new firmware to manage power or temperature.
---
Okay, no shortcuts this time, ill have to do my story now to get that sweet dragon. Gonna be a good carrot to make me do it too. Thanks.
---
Well if primordius and jormag ever become active again they still have some zhaitan and mordremoth magic but I don't think we'll be dealing with them soon.
---
It said “aww she even looks like a quaggan too.” Or something like that
---
A bit trashy on my side but I do not have the game installed.
---
[&amp;CjAiAAA=]
---
[&amp;CiQiAAA=]
---
 [&amp;Cv4hAAA=]
---
I was thinking about Jormag and Primordus toward the end as well. We were told that they had returned to pre-awakening levels and that may mean they lost all the magic they collected this cycle and are back to normal so to speak. No concrete evidence but it makes sense, at least to me.
---
Gift of Aurene contains the Scion weapons. A guy in map chat got the chest and linked all the weapons.
---
Apparently you can freely select an ascended weapon.
---
Madman :o
---
Naah that wouldn't have been worth it. There already is a lot of variation in the pattern. I just have her twice as many spikes on the back and added extra spikes as well as those jaw things. And I just left out the horns and ears from the pattern. OwO
---
You have the best username
---
i dont think so since its, its own buff on ur buffbar.

Interesting idea...

Doesn't matter, they are right, the writing was incredibly shitty this season. But the burning forest looks cool I guess
---
Maybe after we beat Kralkatorrik's Torment and the 3 facets she reconciled them? Thats what im thinking.
---
thank you for reminding that. It's not the issue. When i play in huge blobs i have no problems. When i go to the Bloomhunger the fans are not even at full speed. Temperature both sides is more than alright
---
I got help with that, I just need help with questing in general
---
Lol just say you dropped insane cash on the game. Youre averted those comments blatantly well.
---
oh yeah, we certainly don't know if Caithe has a natural lifespan, and if so, how long it is!
---
but she can die way easier than Aurene at any rate
---
&gt;Literally any solution that doesnt contradict everything we've seen up until this point.  
---
&gt;The solution to the plotline that has been building up since heart of thorns ended up bineg "Punch it harder" and hope it goes away.  
---
&gt;Kralkatorik was set up as a cosmic horror of universal proportions and aurene took him down in one shot.
---
What about this contradicts what was setup? Nothing contradicted it.
---
1. They SHOW Joko getting back up after being killed.
---
2. They SHOWED Aurene eating him and gaining his magic.
---
3. They established that Kralk and Aurene could enter the Mists due to absorbing Balth's magic, logic would dictacte Aurene inherited Joko abilities as well.
---
4. They stated numerous times that only Dragon spawn could absorb the magic of an Elder Dragon and that the world would end if another one was killed before then AND the world would end if Kralk wasn't stopped. Aurene was the only solution.
---
5. Foreshadowing != required plot twist(s). ANet wasn't trying to create a plot twist, just tension. It worked.
---
&gt;Yes it is.  
---
&gt;Removing consequences from the actions of the characters is objectively bad writing, because it removes tension, it removes stakes, and it means there is no longer a relationship between cause and effect.  
---
&gt;Tension and stakes are important from a story, and they come as a result of the actions of the heroes having consequence, which itself is a result of cause and effect.
---
Consequences aren't just bad, sometimes they are good. The game didn't remove any consequences at all, but instead the consequences ended up being different from what *you* wanted/expected.
---
Also, why is it everyone nowadays seems to think death is the only kind of "real" stake that a story can raise. It can be so much more than that. The stakes can be as simple as someone never getting to return home again due to their actions all the way up to the world-ending stakes. The tension was there, everyone though Aurene had died and had resolved themselves to die. 
---
The stakes have always been that without Glaust or Aurene, there was no way to stop the Elder Dragons. This has been established since LW Season 3. The story's options were to end with EP5 and end the world or bring Aurene back. The stakes were never about the player, but for the characters in the game.... specifically the NPCs. The writing team has talked multiple times about how the story is written around the Commander, but not necessarily about him.  
---
&gt;Yeah except again, GW markets itself on its story. Those games don't.
---
Except SWTOR and FF14 do market on their story and WoW uses story-based cutscenes to promote the game..... that IS marketing on story.
---
Honestly, I had trouble deciphering anything he was saying. Anyone have a transcript of that conversation?
---
&gt; The whole Aurene-Joko thing was so simple-minded and cliche that the whole point of all those memes from last episode was that using that plot point was so unimaginative and lazy that ANET couldn't possibly go forward with that route in mind for the next episode - hence all the jokes. Yet here we are where the joke is actually the reality lol.
---
Honestly, I was GENUINELY surprised when she revived and said it was thanks to joko.
---
In mind that was so predictable, simple minded and cheap that I thought "There's no way anet's writers are gonna do this, they MUST hold themselves to some kind of standard." 
---
I was genuinely taken off guard because of this reason alone. 
---
So, I guess goal accomplished. 
---
Just not in the way they wanted.

Much appreciated, here's the screens in game:

even beetle walls
---
Whatever. you got boring anyway. With your pity party you've got going on.
---
A bit short, but the story did make me tear up a bit and the map is beautiful!
---
But my main complaint about this episode is that we should've had more Canach.
---
I guess I misunderstood what you were asking about.
---
Blabla mist blabla time is going slower blabla magic?
---
yikes
---
that's a bit much
---
They have retired. Now concentrating on making babies.
---
It’s really not that hard, only 5 chapters that doesn’t take much longer than an hour
---
They did such a decent job of establishing kralk as an incredible threat. Maybe a bit too good of a job. Just think about it for a moment, it took months of in-game time and full cooperation of all races to destroy zhaitan and modremoth, yet  kralk swallows their magic as well as Balthazar's. But suddenly all sense of scale and urgency is lost as our two little dei ex machina (Taimi and Aurene) sweeps in and save the day. I still have no idea why didn't a couple of asura crews got together and nuked kralk to death from a portal, would have been more fun to watch atleast.
---
Do you want the skins? If you only need to tweak the head you need a total makeover kit. Then you just choose the anime hairstyle, dye it light-blue, choose the same face as me, expand the mouth, minimize the nose and pull it up, expand the eyes and dye them white and choose the closest human skincolour. Thats about it i think:)
---
I haven’t got time to get home yet and updating the game.. how is the unlocking process for the armor set?
---
But the timing.... man was it poor.
---
thank you so much for this
---
I hated killing Aurene last episode and I loathe it now. One of my least favorite storytelling maneuvers is when you kill a character everyone knows isn't going to be dead forever and then try to turn it into a big emotional arc. The last episode was supposed to have this big emotional ending and this episode was supposed to have a big emotional start, but it's completely undermined by Aurene coming back like five seconds into the episode. It's like watching Batman vs. Superman and expecting anyone to be sad at Superman's death, knowing he's not actually gone from the story. It's just a lame technique and it drives me up the wall.
---
If you're going to kill a character like Aurene, it better result in an actual story arc that requires you to go for an extended period of time without that character or result in some sort of substantial change. Her dying did not serve the story in any way, shape or form.

IKR? That's, like, a mortal sin!

Needs more Canach for sure.
---
Been stuck there with some people before a branded wall. How did you solve this?  
---
Update: map change. Seriously...
---
Blame Windows, and/or the slow drive you likely have.
---
I just ran the repair tool less than 5 minutes ago no problem, on W10, with a SSD.
---
So what we do next ? Any clues ?
---
That sounds awesome.
---
So far I liked it. It's kind of a "best of" of things and places we had, with a new polish.
---
So do you like the gen 1 greatsword more or exordium? Debating if I want to work towards exordium or stick to the gen 1 lol.
---
Seems surprisingly high to me. It seems like the only reason to even have a cooldown is to prevent really crazy shenanigans. I would think 5min would be fair.
---
There's an achievement to unlock all 3 quartermasters from each lane. The achievement is to do 10 events in the corresponding zone. 
---
The quartermaster with the Teleport scroll is at the lane going to the Underworld zone.
---
The home node is from the Burning forest lane.
---
Relog, Aurene was supposed to spawn but she didn't for you it sounds like
---
The new map is probably one of the best designed maps. There are so many different ways to explore it; Gliding, Oaks, Mounts, Dragons, Mushrooms,  thermals, Shrines etc...this is how I imagined every map to be designed like after learning a new mastery — it would carry on to the next map rather than being map exclusive. I love it! It makes future maps more dynamic and it doesn’t make masteries feel useless after you complete a LS episode.
---
For the second time this season... But moving!
---
&gt; Because ANet still thinks daily-locked stuff is fun and engaging.
---
While it might not be fun or engaging its something the game needs. If there is no daily cap players will farm 24/7 and either burnout or get said item(s) and then quit cause there is no incentive to log back on. Some might move to something else but they would farm that and repeat the cycle. Then they will come here to complain about a lack of content which only happens because players are locusts. If you can't control how hard players consume content it creates other issues. I know a lot of you like to see a daily cap as "bad" but I see it as a necessity. 
---
Its why with the most recent boss event I think it should've had one. It would let players earn their rewards but then once done move on to do other things. If there is no cap players just do it 24/7 until they burn out.
---
I've hated them... So much. But when I saw them back, I went to the one next to me and jumped in the air for no reason. Until I decided to climb the east part of the map. (-: Awesome east part!
---
Made a video guide: [https://youtu.be/sMjnQuvKVKg](https://youtu.be/sMjnQuvKVKg)
---
I got kicked out of the last instance once after killing the last phase. When I came back, I made sure I didn't insta-use the special skill that ends the phase. I don't know if that's the reason, but I was able to end the mission.
---
\#7 [https://imgur.com/KgZdFpM](https://imgur.com/KgZdFpM)
---
Yeah I found that out the hard way. I crashed twice, but the first one looked like it was from a client-related issue since it said the application stopped responding after I loaded into LA. The second crash I was able to see an error message pop up from arcdps right beforehand so it was more obvious. Sadly, the second crash was during an instance.
---
On top of that, my modem shit the bed as well and required restarting... so I had to restart that instance 3 times.
---
This ending has some kind of Matrix vibe to it :)
---
I too was rather disappointed with how that resolved, but at least the justification for her revival was amongst the better ones out there. Her eating Joko making her immortal makes sense to some extent and more importantly feels cohesive as it references a key part of the story so far.
---
The main problem I saw was, as you mentioned, just how rushed the entire thing was, with Aurene going from basically dead to top fighting condition within a minute. Had there been an additional chapter, where they discover Aurene is still alive and to reawaken her you'd have to do just about anything meaningful really, rather than just pressing a button, I would have been completely fine with it.
---
For the last one (21), just for info, if the meta has been completed, there's no damage there.
---
Also, thank you for this guide - really appreciate it. :3
---
So 12 petals is 1.08g?
---
That means each petal is worth 8 silver. How's the drop rate on them? How long does the buff last?
---
Speed force
---
Have the same issue, tried over 8 times and I just get dc'd after the cutscene. Guess i'm not getting skyscale
---
So many plot holes!
---
The one that irked me the most was when taimi was talking about how they have several armies amassed ready to attack him... Uh ok? Why didn't we see that? Whrre did this magical army pop up? How did we get so many soldiers to this island that was literally just created?
---
Also the story was so short and had no sense of urgency. Like omg we finally wounded kralkatorrik, an unstoppable dragon God of gargantuan proportions! And all we had to do was get some blood and then hit him like lol...
---
Why did we jump from "oh my God we're gonna die the apocalypse is coming holy shit" right to "actually its all ok let's just kill him right quick which is for some reason ok now"...
---
Not impressed in the slightest.
---
The new meta is fun atleast, doesn't really give you shit in terms of rewards tho... As usual
---
There's only a single pact base hastily thrown together at the start of the meta; establishing more is part of the events. They followed Kralk with airships via the tracker which was established in previous episodes.
---
Lasts 30 minutes. I ran around queensdale for about 10 of those killing random shit and got 12 of the petals. Its probably best to save them for sw or istan farming.
---
&gt;How often do you actually use them?
---
I'm guessing it's geared to newer players.
---
I know my 107 TP to Friend stones will last the duration of Gw2.
---
so it's not only me....
---
Jamocha shake.
---
I wish there would be a black and white version of you combine it with eternity
---
It is absolutely gorgeous. Just skim around the bottom layer with a skimmer, incredible. I love all of the different places that are all represented at once. I think it's the first S4 zone to wow me artistically like all around.
---
Exactly. It is the only explanation and it works perfectly with the realms we have been shown. So the map genesis is actually very cool.
---
As for Aurene, she ate Joko, we knew it was for her to get revived. I'd rather have this than have Taimi build a Kralkatorrik killing machine which also absobrs all the released magic.
---
I absolutely hate that Aurene talks now.
---
With last episode people believed first time ever that Anet's days always going for low hanging fruit and going full cheese are over. And all our hopes got crushed 3 minutes into new episode.
---
\#7 [http://prntscr.com/nomluz](http://prntscr.com/nomluz)
---
Number 16 is linked to number 10
---
A lot of the appeal of this game is the movement and feel of combat. I feel like other MMOs are better in regards to variety of activities.
---
wheres number 10? in the shadow of the wing?
---
Yea, any class can do open world stuff
---
No, because chronos and druids dont exist amirite, whose optimal food costs much less? Keep wasting your gold per encounter.
---
Except trooper story - better than GW2 at least
---
Very impressive
---
Most of my friends told me I was mad for going back to get Leyline Gliding after I had all the HoT masteries save for that and Nuhoch Alchemy. Well, the Alchemy saved my ass in Jahai more times than I'm prepared to admit, and *look who can fly across Kralkatorrik during the meta*.
---
There is no new dialogue from Canach at all, even tho he's present at the start of the episode - he is interactable in first instance in new map, but repeats comments from, I believe LS2? Seems to me like VA was not available.
---
Do all types of mobs drop them? Arenanet likes to remove the ability of some mobs to drop loot to avoid overfarming
---
Did it get to a point where it ever felt like work?
---
Yes, and you don't need to loot them. They just go straight into your inventory.
---
I guess you missed Kralk calling "Mother" before he died...That is probably the hint you wanted.
---
Is that because you have Pact Commander mastery? It has autoloot. Everything goes straight to inventory
---
No, I don't have it enabled.
---
This is why i usually have a chat tab specifically for story conversations open during these.  This is what i have from it:
---
Kralkatorrik: Child of my child...
---
Kralkatorrik: I only hope that you never have to kill what you love.
---
Kralkatorrik: Now mortal, return my blood to my heart
---
&lt;player&gt;: Aurene?
---
Aurene:  Do it.
---
Kralkatorrik: Mother...
---
I bet its a bug or something. Me tilting sideways didnt do anything and the instance failed to put me back onto her after i died and resparned. We were both invisible and useless from then on.
---
I feel like Anet have completely written themselves into a hole:
---
Aurene is now basically an invincible elder dragon that can't die and now has the power of several elder dragons within her.....
---
Literally every conflict we have after this is pointless because couldn't we just call on Aurene to blast our enemies? Even if we face another elder dragon, Aurene can just blast their ass into pieces no problem. I hate power creep like this because its so BORING! Our ally literally absorbed the power of the dragon that was gonna end the world and could travel through space and time ezpz.
---
Either, we use Aurene for all of our future conflicts and it's lame, boring and stupid OR Aurene is suddenly "nowhere to be found even though she's our ally and we can communicate with her oh no".
---
Both are terrible copouts and neither are interesting. Stop power creeping your stories until the end is near holy shit.
---
Quickness by itself isn't a mistake, it's just that over the years the game has become so bloated with boons that you can keep it up 100% of the time without any of its original drawbacks (remember that when the game first launched, quickness gave 100% action speed, however there were only 3 skills that gave it and all had severe drawbacks.)
---
Remove arc too...if you're using it, and haven't removed it, then you deserve to crash endlessly.

Or thousands of Euro’s in gems, or thousands of pounds in gems or...etc.

I didnt have enough time to be bothered by it. They blew up within seconds.

The TP is actually really, really easy to farm. I wrote an excel file a number of years back that told me what the top items to flip were. I would jump on in the morning for 30 minutes just putting in buy orders. Then in the evening I'd spend another 30 minutes selling everything I got, and putting in more buy orders after refreshing the excel file.

I'd make easily 50-100g a day doing that. It didn't take long to tweak the file. Hell, I could have probably written a bot that just sits there and does that. Honestly, I bet there's LOTS of people that do this.

Yeah, I'm glad they brought back the feeling of how big he is. He didn't seem too big while we were on Aurene, but when you get to the map and get around him it puts it into perspective.

New map is tangled depths 2.0 when it comes to navigation. Its great when you got every single mastery, but I wonder how people who don't will get around.

Not bad. Only need 18 rather than 30 something like the other episodes. And you can get a good majority of them just by playing rather than seeking stuff out specifically.

Guys, lots of people can afford to put 100 bucks of their pay check a fortnight/month to buy everything needed straight out. 100/month will get you then in 3 years. I bought my bolt and twilight cause that's like one day of work with overtime compared to the weeks of in game time...

The sicky Skyscales are important, on the 2nd part of the collection you need to feed 14  sick skyscales, I've also found one inside the Crystal Wing
---
Where is the map located

Probably because they don't have it unlocked yet.

[Here you go](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Ascended_equipment)

You're all lifesavers. Thanks a ton for this, seriously.
---
[In contrast to this.](https://i.imgur.com/XfDWHKe.png) Same map. Absolutely stunning. Map design on point!
---
First and foremost, Masteries, Mounts, etc. 
---
Once you unlock your mounts, gliding, anything for the first time in the mastery system its toed to all your characters. That allows you to travel around the world, level in general much quicker.
---
As also mentioned in this topic, you will start finding experience tones from reward tracks in various reward tracks. 
---
Ascended gear which stat wise is pretty much top end for max level  characters can be swapped between characters and stats are cheap to swap (in the case of legendary weapons, free to swap)
---
Recipes are account wise as well, so if you find a recipe you dont have the profession for, you can still use it and use it on an alt woth the profrssion.
---
Your bank and currency is account wide so you dont need to swap characters unless said item is in the characters personal inventory.

yeah I know... but at least its really friggen cool

It makes sense if all the Elder Dragons are related in someway. If you remember Mordremoth wanted Aurene just like Kralky wanted her. I'm guessing if this story was going on when Zhaitan was around he probably wanted her. What if Aurene is the Mother of the Elder Dragons now hear me out she was wanted by everyone in season 2 and HoT. She killed Joko and I don't think we established even Kralk could do that. So what if Mordremoth wanted her dead because the Elder Dragon mother wasn't evil but was good and was destined to kill them.
---
The stuff nightmares are made out of
---
"War Eternal" refers to the grind required to get the skyscale.
---
Doesn't spoil anything pertaining to the story, but ok. I tagged it anyways just in case.

All 2 of them.

Not online right now so I might be wrong, but I'm fairly certain it's the corsair boots in line with the rest of the corsair armor of this season

I've read the wiki and I am still not clear. Can you answer:
---
&gt; Is Ascended just the rarity above Exotic, and all different types of weapons can drop with this rarity, or is Ascended a category of very specific equipment that you can get?
---
Could he be calling Aurene mother. I know it sounds wacky.
---
15 doesn't look right
---
it looks like 6 petals is 24 silver, so each is actually 4 silver
---
i guess combining 12 into a bloom doubles the value of each petal, but only when you make it to 12
---
Is that End Game!? Oh Thanos
---
Eh, that's a key every 5 hours in average.
---
It's not awful, I might still get it, but it isn't amazing either. For me with my limited time to play, it will mean one or two extra keys per week at best.
---
But still probably worth it.
---
Same, just finished up the PoF campaign, went to see what skills were being patched and bam, my dragons dead.

Yup.., exactly this.. Most of them. Don't even give a reason why they dislike it and downvote anyone who do like it....

It's definitely 'Mother', it shows up in the chat tab. I thought he said 'Father' at first so I went back to check.

that she is joining the Olmakhan, she talked about it with Bottica in episode 5.

Taimi's 'you read my thesis?!' line made me smile.

Its the title that spoils it. Some of us would have preferred to find out about that organically when we got to the new map.

Right but like you do that once to say you did it then you move on because there's no long term goal

How were balthazar mordremoth and zhaitan handled?  Their magic is still out there and since elder dragons can't contain them, that means aurene can't either.
---
What I know is from experience is that it can take months of hard work to make a SINGLE legendary without buying any gold. I did it with Bifrost using the collections and it took FOREVER. I just finished Aurora and I spent maybe $40 on gold the last few months to make it less of a grind and it still took a months.
---
thanks

im from new zealand you twat.

USD is the standard internationally just like english is the trade language.
---
Is there any gallery of that? Or can be previewed in the wardrobe?
---
I predict we catch up with Jory and Kas and possibly set up for Steve and Cantha.
---
Really imo one of their best maps they've designed, if the note best. The map looks so nice, the map meta is fun engaging and rewarding, and the map also uses LWS3 and HoT masteries.
---
Yeah i've just really starting doing fractals so I'm trying to understand what I need to do to get this equipment, agony hits like a truck.
---
Loved the callback to GW1.
---
In that case, I wonder what makes her special so that she can handle the different types of magic?
---
Personal theory is that it's because she was exposed to multiple types of magic while still an egg. She naturally has Kralks magic because she is related to him. We killed Zhaitan and Mordy before she hatched so she will have absorbed their magic too. 
---
Maybe being exposed to three types of magic (or even four if she has lay-line magic) while still in the egg affected her development and allowed her to handle a wider range of magic. The only magic she was exposed to post-hatching was Balthazar, and she was still young then so maybe she just grew into using his magic too.
---
I didn't know that! Thanks for the explanation!
---
In one of the Meta Events in Thunderhead Peaks Rox talks about how after all of this is over (if it even ends), that she was going to quit Dragon's Watch and join the Olmakhan. I'm guessing she's on an airship that's taking her and the rest of the tribe back to their home. Would be kind of cool if we get to see her again at some point and properly say our goodbyes.
---
That's awesome
---
You are not even reading my comments.
---
They do it for all kinds of games, not solely MMORPGs...
---
Something that strikes me is that Kralk said something along the lines of “they/it promised relief from this pain if I destroy everything”. What promised that? Is there something bigger out there that bestowed all the original magic into the elder dragons? I don’t have an exact quote, and I might have misheard, but if my assumptions are correct, there could be something sinister and more ancient than the elder dragons out there. Could it be the gods? We only have their word to go on when they say the elder dragons were around when they arrived on Tyria. Unless I’m mistaken, we don’t really know anything beyond 10,000 years ago.
---
Of course, he could have been saying the magic promised him that, but I’m not sure magic itself has a mind of its own. Any thought?
---
Leyline glinding feels so good.
---
Probably meant aurene and how she is the first of the kind, thus mother of all the following dragons now
---
That was 3 episodes ago, that everyone in dragons watch has radios that isn’t even close to a decent excuse for them being absent for all of this
---
Orange Cream Shake.
---
Yes i love the camera Angle they use for the end cinematic !
---
I was spamming the hell out of that screenshot button during the ending cinematic
---
If I wanted to really show it off I would've gotten a good screenshot of it like any normal person would. I already did my showing off by linking it in mapchat along with the 50 others in Lion's Arch this morning and genuinely thought these untouched saplings in a burning forest was funny.
---
They can be previewed in the wardrobe. They have the same weapon design as the regular crafted ascended weapons, but a blue and white theme to match Aurene. [Example of the greatsword](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/421365201397481503/578001312805945344/unknown.png)
---
&gt; I too was rather disappointed with how that resolved, but at least the justification for her revival was amongst the better ones out there. Her eating Joko making her immortal makes sense to some extent and more importantly feels cohesive as it references a key part of the story so far.
---
Except completely predictable and rendered the previous episode moot.
---
I gotta say, the production and cinematography in this episode is off the charts.   
---
The last frames are wallpaper-grade. Just [look at this](https://i.imgur.com/FzFMlvP.jpg)

The mount is going to take a long time
---
Good idea.

Now it kind of begs the question... is there gonna be more collections when the next step unlocks?

yes i think so, and you have also daily reset caps... so first day for the new mount is saturday... gg anet for bad game design...

and normal legs are dime a dozen, can be made in 20 minutes. your list means nothing.

at the end of the day, youre still missing leg backpiece. no way around it...

Get PvE friendly classes to play, such as Necro Minions Master or Bomber Engineer. You can go almost anywhere without dying. Not many keys to press either.
---
[Here](https://imgur.com/a/s5KhZLx) is what we know. Theorycraft it.
---
It's possible that because kralk and mord both gained the extra magic unwillingly and suddenly after they were already an elder dragon it caused friction inside of them and there wasn't enough time for them to harmonize with the magic correctly and be able to control it. Aurene on the other hand was able to grow into each of the magic's she absorbed and given time between to find ways to be comfortable without it causing turmoil. It naturally remains to be seen how she handles the addition of all of the others now, but she was able to take in the power of Balthazar and Joko and control them correctly unlike the other elder dragons so she has experience with it.
---
Whats the Timegate after youve completed everything?
---
Hmm nah
---
I want more Joko now!
---
The torment is probably from all the sudden surge of magics he isn't tied to being forced into him by us killing the other dragons. Either that or something happened to the elder dragons before they became these magical disasters that caused them to view mortals in a very sour way.
---
Well, that's literally what we just delivered with the portal, though I will concede that ANet has a bad habit of designing maps in rectangles and filling every acre possible.
---
Personally, I like how we didn't get a new problem by the end of it. things have been snowballing since S2 with every new Season or Expansion making the problem of magic worse and worse. If Bubbled killed Kralk, it would just replace the world-ending dragon with an even stronger world-ending dragon. After doing that for so long, it can be hard to take it seriously. Also, the opportune time for Bubbles to pop up would have been at the start of the story, which would be an odd time for a sudden change in direction.
---
Curly fries, dude.
---
yea it's at one of the vendors, exp too
---
I think part of it was he absorbed it as an already ancient dragon, long set in how his magic works and what he does.
---
Whereas Aurene absorbed the magic in order to grow up, so they're part of who she is as a dragon. 
---
So Kralk had conflict with who he was and what the magic wanted, Aurene got to grow with the various magics within her and define who she was by including the magic in the first place.

Wait what how

You cannot even unlock Skyscale today from what it seems, after you did newborn skyscale ( which is the scales, the medicine and the eggs, you have to wait for daily reset to do saving skyscales ( cannot tell what it is yet ) and after you did that you have to wait for another daily reset to get to raising skyscales... another reset for troublesome skyscales and another reset for riding skyscales 
---
so earliest you can get the mount on saturday as it seems
---
How ludicrous was that bubble of energy that Aurene popped?
---
Dragon can unleash an H bomb from a fart.
---
So if Kralkatorrik wasn't afraid of the vision of a world without him, what was he feeling?
---
After you finish the Newborn Skyscales collection you have to wait until the next daily reset for the next collection to unlock...
---
There are 4 VM merchants total, and they have a few items in common but mostly offer unique items like trinkets, minis, tonics, GH decorations, etc.
---
What happened to “AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH” - Sugarcube.GW2
---
And again for the next.. and again for the next.. The earliest you can actually get the mount is on saturday.
---
I completed the scales and the medicine, and it unlocked a new one, where I'm supposed to give the medicine to skyscales scattered  throughout the map. I guess I'll have to wait then
---
such talent. I am always impressed with the artists there.

In general, this release feels like a conclusion to...well, everything post-core. The Map is Silverwastes style like S2 (also comparable to DS from HOT), uses Keys like S2 and HOT, features Gliding from HOT, Ancient Magics from S3, of course mounts from POF, and even Roller Bettle from S4. The themes also throwback to the past releases of Core/Orr with Underworld (also the first time The Pact has really shown in since...HOT?), HOT with Melandru, and POF with the Fissure of Woe.
---
How do people already have skyscales than if this is the case, and how do you know about all this if there hasn’t been enough time to complete these?

He's near the skyscale platform where Caithe was hanging out but the opposite wall.

They use rented ones :d

just hold it down for autofire lol
---
I am 99% certain they left no in-game teasers so that people wouldn't blast map chat about it, and that in the coming weeks we are going to get a big show for what is coming in LS5.
---
We'll wait and see though.
