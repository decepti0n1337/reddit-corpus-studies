Use reshade.

---
---
Correct, falcon Au ute.
---
Yes, you can tell me your idea and i'll come up with the execution of it, i'll show you some locations that we can go and poses that you can do... all that, everything included xD
---
/u/Jawgeous , I literally brought some cake and coke to enjoy your rant.
---
It is haha, he has a sticker 
---
She's not done yet. &lt;3
---
That arenanet will introduce nothing for PvP. 
---
Edit= that is a real sticker on his window haha. Not Photoshop.  
---
I mean they only put out a big trailer from the last episode saying what happens in this one basically, it's entirely expected? 
---
With this logic, revenant should also overperform at all times. Which it hasn't.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you that a crew makes more sense than 1 prodigy, I'm just saying that in the grand sceme of things both are very bad and lazy writing.
---
Wait a minute...I think I am very confused after so long away.  Were you even able to bring original GW characters into GW2. Starting to think I never played much GW2...might have all been the expansions to GW.
---

---
Does anyone remember the GW to GW2 migration process?
---
I like how it looks like a bunch of men are reaching up to gently touch him.  &lt;3
---
&gt;
---
&gt;\- Do either the druid spec or DH play similar to a priest in WoW? I always liked running dungeons as support / healer but also providing DPS. 
---
I used to run Zealots druid back in HoT. It was really fun and did a lot of healing while also doing pretty decent dps
---
At least being a main gemstore item means it's not in a RNG box where you could spend thousands of gems buying keys and not getting it?  :D
---
(only good side to it, I know, haha)
---
I5 1060 everything on max and reshade cpu  80%,gpu never over  50%.
---
everything on low without reshade, 70% cpu,gpu under 40% all the time,graphic card in this game in BOOORED.
---
Oh haha amazing :D
---
The reg plate.
---
Most account bound mats and currencies arent designed to be rewards itself but timegates or "tokens" that make sure you have to complete a certain amount of specific content before you earn the final rewards.
---
Dont get me wrong, as someone who salvages alot of bought gear from the tp, I have no shortage of dark matter and already deleted stacks of them, so i wouldnt mind a profitable sink for them. But that is the problem. The more of a account bound currency or material is hoarded by the player base, the harder it gets to introduce new sinks for it that result in tradeable goods because it would mean that something else in the economy would loose alot of value in the process.
---
It would also favor veteran players who stocked up on dark matter for years, while newer players getthe short end of the stick, which isnt good for the health gap in the game.
---
Dark Matter also had another function, when it was introduced with ascended crafting, to (at least temporarily) add additional salvage value to exotic gear because with asc gear available, there would be even less demand for exotic gear than before. That function has mostly run its course by now, so instead of finding new sinks for dark matter, it would probably be the easiest solution to just remove dark matter altogether.
---
There is. Bosses move around. Most players don't. 
---
Nope, it's already done, it's a pain in the neck..
---
It really is :3
---
What professions have a decent ranged option and can be supportive or damage?  really new to the game and probably going to be leveling with a melee engineer. I only have the base game that I bought a couple years ago.
---
One Book doesnt make a Club.
---
How tf is there not a system in place to prevent instancing out of story mode/saving progress? I tried to get 2 friends into this and after buying the xpacs we're doing the story mode of PoF and after receiving the mounts we're trying to find the North gate and accidentally wandered at the edge and got kicked out of the instance having to restart the whole story (30mins+). We did it again and it literally happened to one of them the exact same way while trying to find the gate. Both quit on the spot....
---
GW2 is more of a CPU bound game, and the difference between a 960 and 1070 isn't really big enough to make much of a difference when most of the load is put on other PC components instead.
---
Next time, you may consider upgrading your processor instead, perhaps to an i7. I recommend getting something with high single-core performance, rather than something with multiple weaker cores, for MMO's like GW2 (especially ones that run on DirectX 9.)
---
You're right, it wasn't Ogden.
---
As for Taimi, I took it as a tongue-in-cheek reference for us not knowing anything about the sea dragon, rather than anything more.
---
Also, I actually came with a similar concept regarding that particular dragon's power - ArenaNet could even shove some salvaged scraps of Abaddon's lore inside. I recall in Kormir's library in PoF there was a tome called Book of Secrets, which couldn't be read as the letters distorted and changed shapes as soon as we tried to do so. What if the exact same deal is with any knowledge regarding the Deep Sea Dragon? That would be indeed a terrifying ability - something akin to lovecraftian entities being incomprehensible to humans in such a way that even glancing at them causes insanity etc.
---
It is all coming back to me now...never handled the gw1 to gw2 trasition.  Got stuck in "this sucks it isnt gw1..."  Now I am excited to play a new game!
---
AND stunbreaks. I can think of a few teleport which can be used while stunned but won't stunbreak. 
---
I agree. It would be nice if they had little quests like the Caladbog  one but maybe for stuff like unique ascended amulets or rings that maybe have a subtle infusion. A nice quest for an amulet that uses some of these ignored materials would be a lovely addition to the game.
---
At least he still gives you a hand when you need it.
---
if they played with that, I would be fascinated.
---
Those are my two mains. Sylvari elementalist and Asura mesmer.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; It would also favor veteran players who stocked up on dark matter for years, while newer players getthe short end of the stick, which isnt good for the wealth gap in the game.
---
They didn't seem particularly concerned about that when they reworked runes and sigils. Some people had tens of thousands of them stocked up.
---
I don't think your points are far off, but they're anything but consistent about... anything. I'm not sure there's an economics division so much as they rounded up everyone on the staff roster who took Economics 101 and put them in charge after John Smith left.
---
You're wrong. Mirage is broken for some aspects of the game, but powercreep and skills doing everything is the real issue. In 2v2+ mirage remains irrelevant and other elite specs are stupidly dominant. 
---
Did we just become best friends?
---
You can find pvp dedicated players or even a guild for 1v1, 2v2, or whatever in custom arenas.
---
There was a death match map but it was removed or is only accessible in custom arena (not sure here)
---
Also there is WvW, downside is you have to level and Equip your Charakter, since it uses your actual level and Equip, but you get "openworld" fights on 4 maps (which of 2 look alike) scaled from 1v1 up to 50v50 fights with objectives to capture/hold. Even if you don't want to participate in zerkfights/objectives you can cut off the respawning players or get some self organized 1v1s north of south camp (green or blue borderlands) 
---
Why would you do this.
---
*Why would you do this.*
---
Core Ranger is good on his own for open world. Go for ppwer focused damage with longbow/sword/warhorn. 
---
Pro tip: don't use longbow skill 4 for damage, but for cc when needed.
---
like 2 pistols? 
---
Wintersday (which unfortunately just ended) is the super karma farm of the year. It's pretty straightforward to pull in 2-3 million karma over a few weeks with about 10-15 minutes per day by running around giving gifts to orphans In Divinity's Reach. 
---
For first weapon it's 2 pistols and I'd use either a short bow for open world since you can hit lots of enemies at once or two daggers for the second set since it has higher dps.
---
I suppose the implication in game is that the actual rata sum we access and travel around is the city centre, whilst the rest of the housing, labs,  etc are all located on the ground. Some stuff is already located down there like the ports, but I think the implication is that there’s more.
---
Don't waste karma, buy cultural t3 weapons skins, can use on any race.
---
Still waiting for an effects slider.
---
Well I usually play at 20 FPS, here I'm at 5 feelsbadman.
---
The crafting system in GW2 is long overview for an overhaul.
---
As far as I am aware, the crafting system is largely intact from what was delivered at launch.  A lot of stuff has been bolted onto the crafting systems over the years.  In fact ascended and legendary items are one of things that were bolted on. 
---
The thing about software development is that when you bolt stuff onto a piece of software, you will eventually reach a point in time where you have to properly integrate the things that were bolted on.  
---
Good example of this is one the business applications I used to support at my old software development job.  For many years, our work unit would “bolt on” new error checks on top of the existing error checking logic.  Eventually the error checking logic became so bloated and unstable, we basically had to re-write and build a new error checking engine.  The new error checking engine that we built properly integrated all of the error checks that were bolted on over the years.  
---
To bring this back to GW2, the developers need to re-asses the crafting system as a whole.  The main issue I have with the crafting system is that it is largely unrewarding and grindy until you unlock the ability to craft ascended items.  It’s literally taken me years and hundreds of gold to max out my crafting professions.  I was actually surprised how easy it was to craft ascended items once I hit max crafting levels.  I’d say it was much easier to craft ascended items than it was to level up my crafting professions.  
---
Personally I’d like to see a reduction in cost on the levelling recipes.  As a rule of thumb with MMOs, while you are levelling, you should generally be able to craft basic equipment that matches your level.  I’d also recommend reducing the mat cost for discovery on levelling recipes as well.  
---
Regarding ascended crafting, I’d to see more uses for stuff like Dragonite.  I literally have 50 Dragonite Ingots that I have no idea what to do with.  I also would like to see account bound status removed for some of the ascended mats.  You could still keep the daily crafting restriction for these mats I don’t see any reason why players should not be able to sell them.  I think the materials market is in a bit of a lull at the moment.  Adding more stuff that you can craft and sell on the Trading Post would generally be a good thing.  
---
Caithe is basically a minion to Aurene same thing isn't it.
---
I saw devs in there last week, so it's a known issue.  They're probably trying to figure out what noodle in the spaghetti needs to be tweaked.  
---
In my opinion Blood is the least friendly towards magic users, while Ash is the most friendly, with Iron somewhere in the middle. That's why all my magic users have been Ash. 
---
:(
---
The volatile magic vendors in each map
---
Mesmer is the ONLY class that cannot give regen to allies anymore. It kinda dies as a healer imo.
---
No one was using shield on Rev before the sword OH rework, people were using axe. And the busted sword 4 survived a couple months before being nerfed, definitely not a year or two. 
---
None of which is to say I don't agree with your overall point but yeah. There's also I feel an issue with how some weapons are designed in terms of purpose. You mention Rev shield and it's actually a great example, what exactly is it's purpose for Rev? Where do Anet see it being used? DPS builds? If so why is the 4 a pure support skill? Do they see it as being for support Revs then? In that case what main hand do you pair it with? There's nothing but damage on either main hand. Shield had no purpose. Other weapons have this issue too. 
---
Is it still possible to get the new LS if i log in tmr?

The Book of Secrets was a nod to [this item in GW1](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/Book_of_Secrets), and [the items in Siren's Landing](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Storyteller:_Abaddon#Notes) which have similar description before completing the other five gods' parables.
---
I honestly really hope they don't just re-hash the Abaddon theme under a dragon. It would be very uncreative.
---
Besides, it seems clear people can read the DSD's name, they're just forgetting it when bringing it up. I doubt that Anet will tie it into the dragon's two domains.
---
Music boxes don't come from treasure kits, they come from bleached bones, dwarven chests, etc.
---
Ah yes, the We Four Ver. For fans of the Fant Four Stic.
---
Weaver Specialization . Or Weever, however you want to pronounce it xD 
---
I’ve done this. It’s not fun but it’s also not fun playing a character you don’t like looking at.
---
I get their reasoning for not wanting race changes, it makes sense. However I’d really appreciate them lol
---
Those gifts of exploration for map completion can be quite valuable. I would recommend sticking it out at least to finish that, and if you still want to change afterwards you can. That way the map completion efforts you have made thus far don’t go unrewarded. Just my thoughts at least. Additionally, in the past I have bought extra character slots when I wanted to reroll because having the extra birthday presents later on is quite nice as well.
---
"My Friend"
---
I dont think its crazy. Do think about how long youve had the character, birthday gifts after a couple years can be really nice.
---
Otherwise, delete it make the character you want.asure
---
Asura Master Race though...
---
The ascended gear is not soulbound. Unlocking the elite specs is literally a couple hours farming hero points, and you can get 1 to 80 with tomes in like, 20 minutes. With mounts, having waypoints and map completions everywhere is nearly a trivial task. There's no need to go through the whole personal story if you don't wish.
---
I have multiple characters and multiple classes like this. The only long thing is choosing how to design their look.
---
I'll add you when I'm on tonight! I'll come run around with you for a bit ^_^
---
Can you do largos without mirages?
---
&gt;If I may... Um, I'll tell you the problem with the max level that they're using here, it didn't require any discipline to attain it. They got a max level booster and they took the next step. They didn't earn the knowledge for yourselves, so they don't take any responsibility for it. They stood on the shoulders of vet players to accomplish something as fast as they could, and before they even knew what they had, they patented it, and packaged it, and slapped it on a plastic lunchbox, and now \[bangs on the table\].
---
\*chaos theory noises\*
---
...Anyway, the issue with the level 80 booster is, to paraphrase Dr. Malcolm, that it's available to people that don't have the knowledge to *use* level 80. That is, they reach level instantly and then are immediately lost because, as mediocre as the game tutorial levels *are*, the game *still* expects you to go through them as a new player. Without that, you don't learn the basic techniques (dodging AoE, active damage mitigation) that are instinct to a person that leveled 'normally'.
---
As an example, I remember very vaguely back in 2012, when I first did the betas for GW2, that I was really frustrated at how easy it was for me to die. I'd come from GW1, and as objectively bad as I (still) am at video games, I thought "this is insane! I'm not having fun here at all!" (okay, that's a bit of an overstatement; the game was *beautiful*). If you insta-leveled to 80, you're given mediocre stats (soldier's), a complete lack of intro to important game mechanics (like dodging and such), and it'd be a surprise if it *didn't* make you wanna quit.
---
My suggestion is, and has always been that accounts have a `hasLevelEighty` status, that is false on new accounts and *only* gets set to true when the account has a character leveled to eighty. The level 80 boost, then, is either disabled until this is true (i.e., until the account levels to 80 normally), or at least gives the player a Big Glowing Warning. Something like "Your account does not have any level 80 characters. Leveling using this booster will bypass normal tutorial levels, meaning you won't lrn2play. Are you sure you wish to git rekt?"
---
it just has a really long CD to do that so i didn't count it. Even at 40s i found it long before they made it 50s. It won't be up if a fight requires burst healing time and time again (like let's say VG greens?) 
---
This is not to say fb can't heal vg greens btw, it can, without the tome. It is juts to give a timeframe. 
---
For what, curiously? I have a material storage full of them and can't remember the last time I used them for anything. 
---
This is untrue. I've got the plate after other people have looted and remained. The reverse was true the other day when another party member got the plate the kill after mine. Non grouped people were also in the room at the time.

---
Ultimately the question is one of playstyle, and that will vary by class. Find one with a more comfortable rotation before investing heavily into gear.
---
A lot of times I see people invest a ton of time and gold into getting a raid build off the ground, only to swap within a few weeks, because it turns out that one part where you're supposed to turn around and roll backwards through the boss (fire staff ele cough cough) is really really annoying.
---
If you're going to spend hours on a dedicated build, little things will probably start to annoy you much more, so save most of your gold.
---
Yeah but it's not like the average player has these stats handy/off the top of their heads so they'll answer based on their perception of how it is compared to how they remember, which aren't exactly objective.
---
But on the events being consistently doable that's a yes for the majority of it.
---
There's no number per say. Only thing you'll get is opinion of people. To which mine is that there might be around the same or more people around. But those a more spread out because of all the content that as been added
---
How long you need to tag posts with spoiler tag? The update is out for a long time now lol
---
Straya 
---
I haven't touched pvp much but some skills are labeled as varying between game modes (for balance reasons I assume). Are those significant variations (i.e. different skill mechanics) or just number/buff changes?
---
Mhm. We better start to seek another Scion or we're done and gone!

From the heart vendors after completing their hearts.

---
You should have a waypoint unlocked in the zone, regardless whether or not the portal teleported you there.
---
Only even remotely “meta” build that runs grieving is condi weaver, and calling condi weaver meta is a big stretch
---
Okay i will check later. Thanks for this!
---
the GPU and CPU you mentioned are really better. Let's say I go with them, what motherboard should I pick? 
---
Mega servers, every zone is pretty busy for sure. LFG tool is good to see a snapshot of what ppl are into
---
If I remember correctly those clothes are part of the whole NPC model, and not similar in how we can put clothes on our characters.  Of course they can use the designs to make new clothes for us, but its not something they can give us to wear as is. 
---
Figures it was the CPU.  Thanks for the info.
---
Thanks!
---
Not the middle one ofc, it's me :p 
---
Thanks
---
Hmm alright, thanks,  that makes sense. The nostalgia hit me hard over the past couple days and coming back to the game i was just worried that maybe everyone would have moved on and events wouldn't be doable. I really want to buy path of fire and check out all the new additions to the game.

Legendary Weapons series 3 needs to start using a lot more of these ascended materials. Sacrificing 1 Ascended is barely enough of a sink.
---
Why would I want those?
---
To clarify the plate or plate halves sold on the TP are from the metas in the map, they arent the plates from the puzzle rooms. In fact the plates on the TP *is* how you start the puzzle rooms in the first place ( alternatively do both metas and combine both halves into a single plate).
---
No way in hell. I'm already mad my account is visible to friends and on the forums as it is.
---
I leveled my first two characters and then just boosted all the other ones.
---
It was a fun journey at the beginning but I stopped to enjoy it at the 2nd character. It would only get worse each time I'd repeat it. No regrets. I see leveling in GW2 more as a tutorial.
---
If that is for NA it is the same time and date slot that TTS has scheduled.
---
It's common in fantasy storylines to explore the other side of long-standing villains, specially when they've become powerless. In Path of Fire, there's already a focus given to the stabilizing nature of Joko's empire, but so far, he has only been presented as a threat and a villain.
---
Soon ^tm
---
Well, Balthazar never got far from the "we suspect your fake persona and we aren't really trusting you" phase. Joko's would be more like "oh, we know exactly who you are, and we really have no other recourse, and we know you are going to try to betray us every step of the way".
---
Is it possible to save a build if I want to have different setups so I don't have to do it all manually? 
---
Mirage is best in slot for several fights, is generally good condition DPS, and it's not that hard to learn. It also has the benefit of being in evade frames half the time.
---
Condi holo is excellent in the right hands, but I don't see that happen as often.
---
As far as nerfs go... Build and gear for the current meta, not what you think the game will be some number of months down the road. If you have to regear because class balance shifts, oh well. That's just a part of raiding imo. Besides, raids shower you in more ascended gear than you can deal with once you start clearing stuff regularly.
---
Aurene isn't a McGuffin anymore.
---
&gt; Being a GW1 player I have to say I was very disappointed for not being able to finish Joko accordingly.
---
Uhh yeah, Lazarus got it way worse. Joko had a great arc, great climax, and his monologue is some of the best writing in the game. Us killing him ourselves wouldn't have made sense. He got plenty to be satisfying and complete.
---
People have complained a ton at the idea of bringing Aurene back, but I think bringing Joko back without a *very strong purpose* would be even worse.
---
Charr can be gay, so nothing about them is changed.
---
Yeah I can use google translate.
---
Someone on the dev team is a stoner and this is not the only time your character trips. From Omadd's Machine, to actually consuming literal hallucinogenic Mushrooms and contemplating how soft Rytlock's fur is.
---
You can get Largos weapons from the raid. 
---
I remember being the only one of my friends who believed it was Balthazar before the big reveal. It wasn't a particularly popular theory, but I was hungry to figure it out beforehand.
---
If memory serves, there were a few things:
---
- So we were first tipped off that Lazarus wasn't who he said he was after killing Caudecus. With all the White Mantle stuff going on, we were immediately reminded that "Lazarus" was an entity that could contain an entire Bloodstone (read: nuclear) explosion.
---
- Given that "Lazarus" had to be using illusion magic (we assumed) to mask their identity, people started suggesting that maybe it was Queen Jennah or Countess Anise, both powerful mesmers who were able to root out the White Mantle with this display, but also had both been suspected of being Lyssa in disguise. So the concept of a god was definitely on the table.
---
- Others have mentioned the use of fire magic, which I think was a part of it. They also mentioned the Balthazar shield used in the cutscene where "Lazarus" first appears but I don't personally remember that one being talked about until later.
---
I feel like there's something I'm missing that really honed it on Balthazar, but I could be wrong. I mostly remember feeling like *"I totally believe it's gonna be Balthazar but I don't know why Balthazar would be doing this."* So iirc, we were really lacking a motive to pin on him.
---
Here is how the Graveling Plate works. PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong!
---
Basically, the plate will always drop for the NEWEST player to enter the room. It will continue to drop for that player, wasting it, until that player leaves the room.
---
You can solve it in one of two ways. Either repeatedly ask in say chat, "If you have gotten the plate, PLEASE leave the room, thanks!" but then you have to repeat it everytime someone enters the room.
---
The other solution is to leave the room yourself, move a little distance away from the room, and then re-enter so you are the newest player so it drops for you. This is the part that I am unsure about, since I haven't experienced this fix yet myself, I've only had a guildie tell me it worked for him.
---
Why is Farmville so popular?
---
It's my head canon that "Rata" doesn't actually mean city for Asura. Considering that Humans and Sylvari have homes. Norn are migratory with the occasional homestead. Charr in barrack. Asura don't have **houses**; just labs with bed hidden away or tent.
---
Taking cue from Frank Herbert's "sietch"; "rata" probable means something like "place to exchange ideas".
---
Diagree with other commenter. Don't really feel most are self explanatory. The more you do them the better you'll get though.  And you can always ask the group. Usually someone will chime in if they know. 
---
[Hmm?](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/8xqfzi/the_crossover_no_charr_asked_for/)
---
What about after we kill Caudecus and find the secret notes where he explains why the revival process couldn't have happened? That was our first clear hint that Lazarus wasn't Lazarus.

Isn't it just a bow and a sword? I use neither, though I could be compelled to switch if I actually got one. 
---
Grats ! I'm still at my first completion at 66% x)
---
Everything looks great.  I have a GTX1060 6G and this game only utilizes it to around 60% so that's good.  CPU is good.  I always say, get more RAM than you want, so get 16G (I have 32G, but that's because I never, ever want to have to worry about RAM.  Also I use Chrome as a browser, so there you go).
---
500GB SSD is affordable these days, I would go for that.  750W power supply is safer, but not necessary.
---
And DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON WATERCOOLING UNLESS YOU ARE MEANING TO BE AN OVERCLOCK NERD!  It's unnecessary.  There are very, very good fan/heatsink combos that will do just fine, water cooling adds complication and cost.
---
I am 42 and have been in the IT field for a loooong time.  Trust.

I like the post, but I have to agree. This is a prime example of something not safe for coworkers to see you clicking on.
---
The ones going west.
---
Agree with i7-8700k processor. I upgraded to that last summer, and I'll tell you, it performs like a pure beast. 
---
As for an example, during Tangled Depths Meta event, with 40+ players on the Chak Gerent, I average at solid 45 FPS. 80-85 FPS in Lion's Arch. Now sure, I do have shadow and reflection turned off which gives me an extra 10-15 FPS, and the processor at currently 4.8GhZ as opposed to 4.7GhZ. Anywhoo, you can't go wrong with that processor! 
---
If GW2 became a furry fuckfest then i'm glad i quit playing
---
Has absolutely nothing to do with Gw2
---
It's got a spoiler tag now, not sure about 11h ago.
---
For EST it is Monday, Friday and Saturday. I only do the weekday ones if at all.
---
You can also check their schedule [here](https://ttsgamers.com/event-calendar/).
---
Yep. Core game content only counts towards world completion :)
---
i dun like this city. it puts me to jail many times. sigh.

Weaver - Beautiful to look at, almost like a dance 
---
Holo - feels impactful and futuristic
---
Necro - GS2 oooommmpf, Shroud looks super nice
---
Rev - GW1 fanboi reporting in, could watch mallyx and shiro all day, kalla is nice as well

Thief - acrobatic af, feels very evasive

Can anyone explain  [https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries](https://gw2efficiency.com/crafting/legendaries) tradingpost prices? Some of them have a plus and others a negative sign. What do these mean?

weeeee forever!
---
How am i wrong about roaming and small group fights involving Mirage in WvW? And what elite spec is stupidly dominant in those aspects were Mirage is not?
---
eyes of kormir was the biggest load of bullshit ever.  Item gobblers should be released to fix an overabundant item.  Releasing an item and its respective gobbler at the same time is a complete lack of effort and planning.  Its like they saw how popular mawdrey/etc were and were like, 'oh I guess we should make more junk items so we can have more gobblers'.  Fucking idiotic
---
You have to put yourself in the new player position. When starting out, no crafting disciple max, no proper gears, etc. I fine trinkets easy to get. Just do some hearts, follow some bounty trains and voila, a few trinkets
---
I did it a couple of days ago. Note that whatever advice I give may not be perfect -- it is simply what I experienced.
---
So for Enduring Hatred, the key word is *sequential*. Don't kill the enemies in one go, do it *one after another*. Kill A, then B, then C, and finally D. Make sure to stack the enemies close to each other as well.
---
Like a Wounded Beast can be done by killing everything in one go -- that's how I did it. It's best to use a necro here, I did it with Reaper. When you're at 10% of health, tag them with axe 3 (just in case the buggy achievement requires you to actually deal damage with an axe), then go into shroud (which freezes your HP) and use Soul Spiral. Do not use Blood Magic traits or put down a dark field, either one can leech HP which would heal you and possibly invalidate the achievement.
---
The ideal location is in the spider hallways south of Gorrik -- there's a veteran spider and 4 hatchlings there. I used axe autoattack and axe 2 to lower the vet's HP to about 20%, let them hit me, timed it just right to release an axe 3 blast before I went into shroud and spun the life out of them. I was using the Dragonsblood axe, however I do not think this is required, was just being superstitious. 
---
It may not work the first time, however. I had to try again after reset when I did it, because several attempts before that were not working. But after reset, it was fine, oddly enough. I've since seen a comment on Reddit about how logging out and relogging seems to help? So maybe that was why.
---
I can think of plenty of images without visible genitals that I would not appreciate my boss peeking over my shoulder while I was looking at them.

Nice observation! Haha I dont think so tho x)

I love having post processing turned off &gt;.&gt;

You can go under it without ending up in jail ^^

The grove is my favourite racial city, too! :) I remember how much time I spent there back at launch :D Enjoy your time in Tyria &amp; welcome to GW2! ♡ 
---
Sigil of nullification, karma booster, cooper doubloon, and a bunch of fine crafting mats though.
---
something i did not know! thank you!
---
I have such a soft spot for places that really incorporate nature in their design! So I was blown away by this when I first entered!
---
Thank you &lt;3 Really enjoying the game so far! 
---
you can pvp and get tomes for lvling
---
however pvp is not something new people may enjoy ...  because you are gonna get slammed hard. 
---
Make sure you have the music on there. It’s really quite something.
---
Congratulations! That takes a lot of time to do. I've only completed it once myself so far.
---
Also the outfits on Elonian NPC. My god if they actaully gave them to us i would be ruined because i would want to buy them all. And i especially want the one when i am in prison on Istan, my god my asura looked awsome in it.
---
Even without meta routimg you can do it in ~20h
---
I've suggested this to them already but they seem to already have closed up their mind that  the game is trash because the leveling isn't one-sided dungeon-grinding or  fast travelling and essentially talking to NPCs and turning in quests for 5 hours like in e.g. Maplestory.   
---
Like YasaiTsume above has said in reply to my comment, the game is more complex than most other MMOs where gear is close to the only thing that matters rather than player skill or build / rotations. But didnt build etc. matter even more in guild wars 1 than now in 2?   
---
I've been trying to tell them to watch youtube videos I send them to find out about GW2's endgame, following their reaction of either: "Im gonna buy the xpacks" or "Yeah no im good"  
---
I'm a bit sad really since Gw2 endgame has so much more to offer than for example maplestory, especially in terms of improving your own gameplay 
---
Sounds very interesting, very troll-favored and plain shitty design if it's intended. It should be totally opposite; first come, first in queue.
---
So I doubt this is how it works.
---
I killed that damn graveling 20 times a few days ago and then i raged so much i want to go back unless they fix it. Those keys keep on piling up in my inventory from the meta but (and yes i know i can sell them) and i juse want to get the achivements done without going insane first.
---
Wow I really love this - its beautiful and says a lot a out these characters without a single word
---
When Taimi dies I want Zojja back.  
---
Fractals and raids have literally ZERO appeal to me.  I'm still gunning for a full ascended set for each toon..  Not quite there yet though.
---
Yeah this is a little too rule 34 for the sub. Sorry but there is another sub for that kind of material it if you want to share it there.
---
What if this image is a print-screen shot of a picture take by phone uploaded onto the computer?
---
GW2 leveling is exploration-based. Grinding is the worst way to gain experience. The best way is to ignore experience altogether and, as you said, just play the game. What's over there, what's over there. Hey, let's talk to these NPCs, now let's explore that mountain. Then follow the stream. Hey, a small town. What's going on here. While doing that, you will encounter small riddles, mini-dungeons, NPCs asking for your help, dynamically happening events that you can join, and so on, and so forth.
---
10 years of WoW and its clones conditioned players to follow a red line of quests that lead you from questhub to questhub to zone to dungeon, permanently telling you what to do next.
---
GW2 has a pinch of sandbox gaming. It drops you in its themepark and then tells you to fuck off and have some fun.
---
Instead of exploring and discovering the many rides, a lot of people just stand there staring. Like an ox that spend his whole life in front of a cart.
---
It's a culture shock and can be pretty hard for many people. They equal lack of handholding with lack of content. If the game doesn't lead you to it, it doesn't exist.
---
What you can do is act as that handholding mechanic. Lead them to different ways to level up. Lead them to dungeons, to different zones, to event-heavy regions (Harathi Hinterlands, for example), to a worldboss train, to "activities" (minigames), and so on, and so forth.
---
While all that variety is one of GW2's greatest strength for many people, it is also the reason to hate the game for others. They don't want diversity. They don't want relaxed playing-the-game. They want a strictly defined goal and an efficient way to reach it, and all that fluff, all that IS GW2, is just cutting into their fun of reaching that goal in the most efficent, shortest, most familiar way.
---
These people can be dropped at dungeons, grinding and re-grinding them time and time again. Or drop them at an event-dense map like Harathi Hinterlands, where they can circle the same seven events forever. No need to explore the map's events beyond that.
---
But generally speaking, it'll be very hard to retain that kind of players. Widening someone's horizon isn't an easy task, and sometimes it's not a question of an open mind, but of simple, personal taste. GW2 is leveling is best experienced by casually cruising, and that's simply not for everyone.
---
You got a bunch of efficient ways to grind to lvl80. Someone who really wants to and knows what he is doing can do so within an evening. But you can also just pop a lvl80 booster, assuming that you may have one.
---
 Norn guardian. My first toon and still my favorite. She's a Herald now though. 
---
Disgusting really
---
I doubted this when I first heard it, until I entered purple, didn't even tag the graveling, and there was a plate on the floor for me as the two other guys went again. 
---
Well i have this two wall of text that i paste when people ask about leveling and about endgame content. Since they are wall of text i can not paste both of them so i just give the links to the last time i posted them. Might give you and them some insight. 
---
And to be honest they can grind dungeons if that is what they like. A lvl 30 you open up the first one. Story dungeons do not give as much xp as the exploreble do but the exploreble is often a reality check for low level players. So if they want to grind them they probably need someone level 80 willing to help them out. 
---
You can also level through S-PvP or WvW if they like this game mode better. You wont gain any xp but you do get tomes of knowledge. It is not as fast as level in PvE but if PvP overall is what someone like then playing that and level could be a answer.
---

How to level: https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/a3qzfb/first_mmo_super_intimidated/eb90wxf/
---
And last i am a bit uncertain what you mean with your question. So you might get the wrong answer, let me know if so. Gear progress in GW2 is not something you only get through a gear treadmill like PvE raids. You can infact get the bis gear through every game mode with a lot of game play involved and you can also craft it and very rarely it also drops as boxes from mobs but the rng is not that high for that. 
---
Ascended gear have the highest stats and when you have them they will never expire when a expansion come. What will change is combinations of stats and builds. This happens more frequently. But we have stat swap so doing that wont be a big of a problem. 
---
How ever gear will never carry you. Having the highest gear is not what will make you good. Because GW2 is skill based. So you have to have the gear with the right stats and a build that synergy with it and you have to use your weapon skills and  you can weapon swap in combat so you mostly have two weapon set (unless you are ele or engy) and on top of that you are also expected to manage your health and your personal defense. So there is a lot of skills involved and if you do not work on that endgame will give you issues and you will get hammerd by both mobs and enemies. In core Tyria there is not that much challange happening but the expansions are gonna ask you to step up a bit.
---
So are we going to have THIS hanging over our heads while SAB is up?
---
I hate doing point of interest. Just because there is so much stuff to do always, i tend to ignore world completion. 
---
Who does Caithe actually refer to with “Him”?
---
Yeah , that's actually the OPPOSITE of what I'm saying. That's not alt-friendly , that's stifling your ability to play alts. 
---
Took me 6 years and 2 expansion. Only ended up finding the time for it after mounts last year haha
---
Quick notion about air vs water cooling. Air is low maintenance and if it's a good tower might even be on par or **better** than some water cooling. Take for example a D-15 vs most 240 / 280 rads. Water just warms up (and cools down) much slower, and as result can seem much more effective if you don't stress test it for long enough.   
---
Big importanto for air cooling: Make sure case airflow is at least half decent and to dust it out every now and then. A lot of cases nowadays have this whole WOoO shiny lights design and are actually completely closed off everywhere with close to no air intake and/or fans just sucking directly against hard plastic. Something I'd recommend is a Meshify C and a few Nanoxia or random-brand 140mm fans as intakes/exhausts.   
---
Also, if he's going for a budget build (considering the 8400) I don't think dropping the extra cash on a fancy Z370 board is going to be worth it, but it wouldn't hurt that's for sure. Could always go for a budget Z370 chipset board or run with a B360 board since he doesn't seem like he's going to overclock. I'd say for his purposes the feature set of each board (USB ports, inbuilt lan, blablabla) is going to be the deciding factors.   
---
He could alternatively wait for Ryzen 3000 and/or Navi to finally be released, although I'm unsure of how accurate the leaks are so far. Seems impressive for a 230$ CPU to exceed / match the performance of a 500-600$ flagship Intel model, though.   
---
1060 should be plenty for Gw2 as it isn't exactly very well optimized and usually ends up more CPU dependent (in my experience anyway)  
---
Sorry if my writing sucks I'm horrible at structuring reddit posts.   
---
  
---
Note: I run Gw2 on an old-ass PC and it's doing just fine. 3570k on a fairly bad z77 motherboard overclocked to 4.6-4.8 (Depending on whether it's a hot or freezing day) and a GTX 970. In most areas unless shit is going down I get anything from 60-110 FPS
---
Dont craft ascended when u an get from PvP with just currency especially if you want to craft a legendary save all mats. Do jump puzzles, mini games or all the achievements. Do map and guild events. Triple trouble. Still play HoT maps. Help the noobs. 
---
Got a RTX2080 too, but I think it's my CPU that struggles most in Thunderhead Keep
---
Man, Taimi's voice actress really out-did herself... Hearing Taimi crying first really delivered the gut punch for me.
---
*sighs*
---
*begins digging the grav for Animal00000*
---
I usually just do my time gated crafting from all the salvage materials and gathering. Spiritwood plank, deldrimor ingot, elonian leather square. Mats are easy to come by so gated at 1x per day. Each one sells for about 4g.
---
Well yeah, by removing the *need* for them. Races are purely cosmetic. The only reason to roll an alt is if you want to play on a different region.
---
Ren has never taken Grieving. You're probably thinking of when Firebrand ran Grieving for a time but they currently run full Viper's iirc.
---
Yeah it should be the Observation Deck Waypoint in the very NW section called The Forge.
---
GZ! With mounts its way easier now, but still needs some time to do =D.
---
And now you can start crafting your legendary ;)
---
I know a lot of ppl playing gw on somewhat budget and it’s working just fine
---
The i5 you mentioned is more than enough .. gpu wise even a 1050ti does the job on 1080/60
---
You will have stable 50-60 nearly everywhere apart from world bosses and massive Zerg fights in wvw
---
But even on my i7 8700 gtx1080 Setup my FPS drop there
---
8gb of ram should also be fine if you are not planning to play 2 games simultaneously 
---
About a main board I am personally using a msi a-pro which is one of the cheapest with z370 chipset.. and it is working very well
---
Power supply should be around 350-400 watt I think even if the pc will not consume more than 250 in this setup
---
I highly recommend a m2 ssd, such as a Samsung evo 970 or 960 since they are a huge boost in loading times
---
As I said 1080p would be a cheap and good option as a monitor maybe 24 inch 
---
Or you go for 1440p 27 Inch which will also work fine with the pc I mentioned
---
I love the grove. It's my home base, where I port to at the end of my playing time. Enjoy the game!
---
A word of advice if you wanna give that sigil a try. It’s not working with mantras at the moment. Visually the mantra recharge gets the cool down reduction. But it didn’t get it
---
Let’s say you use your mantra on the moment it gets its second charge back. So now you are getting the frenzy recharge. The charge cooldown jumps a bit ahead visually. Now if it would reach the second charge visually, it’s actually still in last charge. If you hit that button now, you’ll empty that mantra. 
---
I don't mean to be too annoying. But I haven't seen any homes in Rata Sum. Only Jail cells and labs. I mean there's hammocks. Are all Asura just backpacking and living in shared accommodation? 
---
Yeah I use them because the Largos Twins are my nemeses. I spent 6 hours straight learning the fight when the wing came out. 
---
You're new here, aren't you?
---
You'll want a Mirage and a power build of your choice for playing DPS in raids. A fight where you specifically want condi is a fight where Mirage is probably the best condi DPS for that fight or a very solid choice. Mirage is mandatory for DPS mains due to how hard it can outperform other DPS builds on fights like Matthias, Soulless Horror, Cairn, and the Largos Twins.
---
I'd suggest practicing your rotations in the Special Forces Training Arena using the [benchmark guidelines](https://snowcrows.com/benchmarks/) on the Snow Crows website.
---
wish it were higher res so i could tell what the difference between 6, 7, 8, and 9 is. Looks like 9 has a horizontal line in the middle, but i cant tell what else is there in between the X
---
Crafting isnt anything big in gw2 - sadly.
---
To level your crafting disciplines, you can use [http://gw2crafts.net/](http://gw2crafts.net/).
---
After you leveled them, you can use them to ... well ... craft. Its usually cheaper to craft yourself, but make sure to check on wiki or [https://www.gw2bltc.com/](https://www.gw2bltc.com/).
---
As for crafting for profit, thats not really possible. The margins are very low, and usually the tp eats your profits. Its always a good idea to keep a good stock of timegated materials on hand (t7 mats - deldrimor steel ingot etc.), but I wouldnt sell them except if theres a spike in demand (new recipe gets discovered or something like that).
---
It's a decent quality monitor, at least.
---
Rule 34? Are you fucking kidding me? Wanna see some actual rule 34 and see the difference?  
---
This is nothing more than a cute drawing of 2 characters together. Nothing else. Just because it involves gay or furry characters means that it's sexualized or "NSFW" unless you're a fucking mormon or something.  
---
And yet something tells me that if the top character was a male human and the bottom one was a female sylvari there's have been zero complaint at all.
---
Fucking hypocrites
---
omg! how did you remember my ign to call me out like that? lol xdd  
---
i feel like it's a bad thing more than a good thing. lol. but yus, that's me. and i like them xD  
---
I think its great to have all crafting disciplines. Some might say otherwise and say it inefficient and blah blah, but it feels aesthetically nice to be able to craft your own sword or whatever, and there are somethings its just better to craft on your own. 
---
The best way to start off is get whatever discipline you choose up to 400 or 500. Honestly the best way to do this is to google a guild wars 2 crafting guide and follow from there. Going in without a guide can be super inefficient and waste resources, but the guide will walk you through the best items to be crafting and how cheap they are. (Should be noted guides may be outdated, but they havent really changed crafting a lot so really some items just may be cheaper than what a guide lists.)
---
Hunting events was how I got a few friends to lvl80. Mind you, they didnt stay because "no endgame content" (which was more like too much endgame content and nobody telling them what to do, but whatever).
---
Slaying tons of mobs, or going against champions with all exp boosts active you can get easily (guild boost, firework, food, utility) is quite okay in terms of leveling speed, and running around openworld unlocking waypoints while searching for the next event is quite a bit of fun if not done alone :)
---
6 = no horizontal line
---
7 = horizontal line on top
---
8 = horizontal line on top and bottom
---
9 = horizontal line on top, mid and bottom
---
Theres a secret little get away spot in the grove, just to let you know. See if you can find it..
---
Some suggestions: 
---
Run Full Minstrels gear, including your weapons, with a Sigil of Concentration to increase your boon duration by 10%
---
Since you won’t be doing any damage, you should focus on utility and buffing. I recommend dropping the Sword offhand for a shield, for its 5th Skill Tides of Time. This gives your allies almost 8s of alacrity, which can be extended using Signet of Inspiration. 
---
Your second weapon set should be a focus offhand, for its phantasm projectile reflect when traited, and for its ability to group a bunch of enemies together so they can be cc-Ed (I personally like the focus pull into shield 5 combo) . 
---
A staff can be a good alternative to provide other boons, at the cost of projectile reflection and pulls.
---
For your utilities, well of precog is pretty redundant seeing as you’re taking inspiration, meaning that every distort you get (f4, signets) will share aegis to your allies. Take Well if Recall instead, to give that sweet sweet alacrity to your allies. 
---
Traits wise, I would recommend Chronophantasma instead of seize the moment, as it essentially doubles up your phantasms. Shield Phantasm pulses allies with protection, while focus Phantasm reflects enemy projectiles. Being able to double up on them is great.
---
Let me know what you think :) 
---
Glad you got to show off the size of your intellectual penor, I think the point got through though.
---
Get ready to do it a few more times when you need to craft those legendaries :)
---
Prior to megaservers I had to purchase a world transfer because  my home world never won the poi and waypoints required in wvw...
---
to transfer twice cost as much as buying the base game fml
---
Sadly no. What you're describing is called "Pin Sniping" and it's usually looked down upon in most fights as a cheap way to disorganize the enemy group and win without actually fighting.
---
(Not that being hated ever stopped some people from doing something for free loot or lols)
---
http://gw2crafts.net/ has shopping lists and "what to craft in order" lists if you want to do power through.
---
I'd say crafting is mostly used for ascended gear, although there are some exotics that are worth doing by crafting if you have the recipes. Legendaries need crafting too. 
---
Congrats dude
---
because the tech isnt there yet /s
---
Ah Rata Sum, home of the smart!
---
Hey, thanks for the pretty incredibly long comment (so well written too my god)  
---
I think you and Yasai hit the nail on the head, but as much as I'm trying to use up my free time to be their handholding mechanic it's looking more and more like I will just need to let them go play more one-sided / WoW-type games.   
---
Maybe I'll show them your comment and hope they change their mind, although I feel like they'd probably think I'm insulting them more than anything.   
---
One thing I have noticed which you mentioned is the fact that people used to these other games need to be shown and told what to do, as one of my friends when playing earlier even said all he's done so far is "follow the marker" and didn't even realize there was so much stuff to explore until I forced him to come look at it.    
---
I might just need to tell them that GW2 is very heavy on exploration so it really might not be for them (despite imo amazing combat system and raids later on)  
---
For Enduring Hatred I just equipped an axe on my soulbeast and did North meta. Somewhere in there I managed to get it by chance.
---
Oh, I'm sorry I took so long to get back to you.  Second row, second column (only available in makeover kits) on a male charr.  There is also a similar one in the first row, third column (again only available in makeover kits).  I'd post a link to a picture but I'm relatively new to writing posts and comments on reddit/ I don't know how to. 
---
Nice, now you can finally play the game
---
why not just log in for 5 mins each day to do the daily crafting. That's what I've always done. Even when I didn't have enough time to do my dailies, I still logged in to do my daily crafting. So when the time comes that I want to make stuff like ascended, or celestial etc I can just do it straight away. No need to wait. I have like \~500 each of the daily craft material just sitting in my material storage. Be the ant, not the grasshopper.
---
As for the winterberry you could always buy the node or do the pvp/wvw reward tracks. If you don't like either of those game modes, then you can stick to spending 15-30mins doing the easiest of the pvp/wvw dailies. There are lots of PvP dailies room where people actively trade kills and other things to get the daily. And the WvW ones are sometimes as easy as buying one item from a merchant or killing one veteran(sentry, kill vet). This will give you the pvp/wvw reward track potions which you can use to advance the bitterfrost reward track.

That is incorrect. Town clothes are (or rather were) possible to mix and match, even NPCs can be seen with different chest or leg clothing options. Korukhan the Blacksmith, for instance, uses the same chestpiece as many other charr NPCs, but he has different pants.
---
Players were very upset when town clothes were scrapped back in 2014. See [http://i.imgur.com/qrq0jGI.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/qrq0jGI.jpg)

Ayy there you go! Congrats! :D

I'm not sure which concept art you're referring to, but would the below armor work?

I remember that struggle all too well.  Fortunately it was free for me to do at the time.  I finished world completion on my first character around Thanksgiving 2012, and to get the WvW maps, I transferred servers like 5 times.  I can't remember why it was free, but I think if you went to a less populated server it was free to transfer?  Doesn't matter now though.

For someone with a rockface Kralkatorrik can be surprisingly expressive.

u/VacuumViolator u/xanidus u/BaconIsAVeg2 You're badly written. Go away

Dont compare apples with pears. Runes and Sigils arent account bound as Dark Matter is.
---
It is. While elementalists, especially male charr fire elementalists can fall under suspicion of being at least sympathetic with Flame Legion, their skills are too useful to be tossed out entirely.
---
But the Spearmarshal's Lament is a wonderful item. Teleport to Vabbi has saved me a lot of money.

Okay damn, I thought I was the only one. I'm running an i7-7700k and a gtx 1060 6gb, thought something was up with my rig
---
This is the Crystal Champion line of the masteries, right? I didn't know it locked you out of acquiring the masteries if you didn't have the first episode.  
---
I'm not in the same exact position, as I have Istan, but I was able to earn enough experience to activate Volatile Magic acquisition without actually starting the Living story Season 4 (I had just killed the big bad of Path of Fire and was running around for a bit trying to do a map completion for an Ascended Weapon on my Holosmith).
---
Am I correct in inferring you're unable to learn anything Crystal Champion-related because the whole track is locked behind the Istan episode? :(
---
Anyway, dunno if you're strapped for cash, but I'm guessing it's either buy the gathering tools that let you independently grab the volatile magic currency without necessarily buying Istan (2700 gems), or purchase Istan, whichever is cheaper. 
---
Uhm, erotic != sexual. Where do you see something sexual in the pic? Would you consider a pic of two guys kissing sexual? A pic of a guy and a girl? TIL Facebook is full sexual content.  
---
Not to mention I fail to even see the "erotism" in the first place. As I said if it was a straight pic no one would have considered it "heteroerotic as fuck" and would have just rolled with it.
---
Also, just look at the number of downvotes the comments the most likely being from the ones who reported it - that is, the most downvoted ones - and tell me that removing it was what most people actually wanted. And I won't even mention the fair amount of upvote it got

Why... Why are you doing this to us .... :'(

Very very well done !

Understandable have a nice day

&gt;[Here is a preview of a possible build.](https://pcpartpicker.com/list/YXXv7W) 
---
Just curious. Why did you go for an m.2 ssd? are they faster? What are the pros? I've considered switching from my sata ssd. 
---
Yes please. I’d love it if our characters were forced to make a fresh start. Go somewhere unknown to escape the critics in Tyria and Elona. 
---
I did it by my ranger on platinum farm. There are 5 earth elemental who can be easing for kiting, have few HP and few DPS. They stay near each other but cant attack toghether because here the cliffs landscape. I used bristleback as tank bc he have a lot of toughness and get agro of mobs instantly.
---
I set peace mode for my pet, then I waited when one elemental reduce my HP less 1700 (my ranger have \~17000 HP). Then i gave my pet the command "attack" and started kite. 
---
Important note: your HP can be &gt;10% between killings. If you go away from combat mode, don' worry, just let next elemental bit you.
---
God dammit you beat me to it. Granted, I have toons of all races, but my Sylvari Ele will forever and ever be my special leaf boy.
---
I wish they would update this location. The general design is great, but some of the textures are really outdated.
---
&gt; on my deadeye 
---
this is why you were banned
---
Grats
---
I had a guy trying to troll me so I blocked him after I told him what he thought of me was what he actually thought of himself but afaik I have done nothing to warrant a ban, I am in the arena for an hour or two a day to tune my build,  get better etc  and I don't talk alot of smack I just put work in and play . I feel like it was a group of players reporting me over me beating them , that's the only thing I can think of tbh
---
First of all what i learnd u dont need to equip the axe for the two achivment and they are rly buggy. I did the killing fast 4 Mobs in the Northmeta with my longbow by only spaming the 5 in the groupe and bless that it will work. The thrid achivment did i in the cave with the spiders south of the smith Hearth. I simply pull the spiders togehter by the veteran and wait untli i drop under 10%. Then i begun to kill all mobs, to make it safer i was merged with the black baer for 2 Blocks and a higher health and toughness Pool.
---
Can't you somehow get that info from achievements ? I dont know just asking the smart ones here 😀
---
any word from anet security?
---
Thanks for your reply!   
---
What do you mean by buying the node?   
---
I'm definitely gonna look into the daily quest stuff, hopefully this will give me atleast a few more every week.
---
Played since beta 2012, 5 characters at 80 equipped, highest completion rate on my warrior: 68% lol

Sadly this basically tells them "Do no make build templates cause less people will buy character slots" : P

I'd love build templates too though.

This has nothing to do with anet, these are leaks from other services. OP made a general PSA to check if your login details haven't been compromised (if you use unique passwords for all services you're good)
---
so the hibp site has a section where you can type in your password to see if its in the list
---
ok, having found my email has been breached, the site now wants me to type in my password, no way in hell am i ever typing my password into another site after already given it my email address. i dont care how trust worthy the site says it is.
---
It must feel pretty great to sport them as trophies of your victory!
---
Comments like yours do nothing good except promote ignorance.

You were probably banned for talking shit to people.
---
Source: I've had a couple of 48 hours bans for doing the same and they're always 48 hours.
---
New maps and areas have been getting progressively less optimized with time. HoT was awful for this, some of the PoF maps had areas with nasty framedrops for no reason, same with most of the LS maps.
---
They look better than the core Tyria maps but most of that is due to post processing magic, not some incredible visual fidelity so don't let that fool you. It's mostly a question of poor optimization. It's very fair to say GW2 is poorly optimized at this point. The ancient DX9 engine sure doesn't help. 
---
"The sword regrown". The quest that let's you restore caladbolg. 
---
I'd rather they use Vulkan and finally be able to potentially support multiple platforms with just one API. That should make things easier, if they're going to release a Linux client one day.
---
A great engine rework will have to happen at some point in the future, unless Arenanet is planning to switch to using one of the other commercially available engines. However, the current Engine seems to be able to last a few years from now, before technological debt becomes a pressing matter.
---
This allows them to future proof their technology, train their personnel, upgrade their tools and rework the engine when it's most convenient. For now the industry is carefully considering their options and Arenanet is likely doing the same. Reflecting on their mac client, they are likely to work on the engine when they're free to do so, so a situation similar to the switch from GW to GW2, or the time period before a great expansion can be made.

Alright, so you got suspended for breaking the naming policy then. Quite silly to create a thread about how "being good in PvP" got you banned, when you clearly know that wasn't the case. 
---
...Because golems don't have mechanics? Seriously just check the comments of the Deimos record (even there it lost to the one Dragonhunter they had) for people explaining that why Chrono looks good on the Golem, it doesn't too well in many other scenarios. Split phases and long cooldown on its proper burst, invulnerability, as well as taking its sweet time to actually get that burst which is delayed compared to other burst-oriented power DPS. 
---
&gt;only really loses at fights like twin largos to mirages. What do you mean it rarely comes close to it? lol.
---
Why would you take a power DPS to Largos?
---
and I only have reported people for verbal abuse and saying fa\*\*\*t and such so I have no clue what i would  report someone that defeated my character in a video game. but you can judge all you want I dgaf , just wondering how many other players have had this happen to them 
---
Go type it in from another PC/IP/Location shrug
---
The order of the one shown will be the last infusion equipped IF both infusions have the same priority. The reason for it messing up when you switch maps id due to zoning - when this happens it will randomly pick an infusion to prioritize.
---
Sorry to disappoint but I dont PvP in GW2, used to in GW1, but in this game I play PvE mainly with a bit of WvW thrown in. Whoever that was is doing his/her own thing.
---
see, just a bad name. how "well" you play has nothing to do with it.
---
I associated smokescales with [Arcane Shield](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Arcane_Shield) sound over time. I wonder why.
---
you are funny. who would report my name "Stoner" I am a stone mason  so I named my char stoner wtf 
---
just because you cant play a decent chrono doesnt mean its irrelevant
---
all good I'm just a bit miffed abot this ban since I was just fighting in the arena,  as I do every day 
---
Priority and zoning? 
---
But... obviously that is not what you were suspended for, you were suspended for your name, which the notice quite clearly tells you. 
---
I know, but I wanted more minions than scourge can provide. If you want max condi dps just use a meta build.
---
right. my name was reported by players I had beaten I know it , I had a guy scream about my name the other day  and bam herecomes a ban.. but ppl can have names like "Stickit inner" etc and other fucked up names 
---
I suggest reading this: 
---
https://www.guildwars2.com/en/legal/guild-wars-2-naming-policy/
---
Specifically this part would be of interest to you: 
---
&gt;We do not permit names that:

tree's certainly do when youre trying to griphon past them

Very spot on editing, music and visuals selected I loooveeee ittt!! Thanks for sharing &lt;3

I think we are going to the Eye of the North to use the scrying pool

I don't usually venture into that side of things, but you're making me think about it.

haveibeenpwned has been around for *ages*. It's been around literally since back in the days when anyone still actually used "pwned".
---
Amazingly done! 10/10
---
In the past (I means during launch &amp; season 1), there was a mechanic called Town Clothing. It worked like a second set of armor, and could be worn outside of combat (when entering combat, your character automatically switched to your armor's appearance).
---
This mechanic was removed when the devs added the wardrobe in. Some of the existing town clothing was ported over to the wardrobe system (mostly the head gear, like glasses, many hat and the bunny ears), some where readded as outfit, and most of the rest was turned into tonics. 
---
However, even back then, a bunch of NPC Clothing was not available, and some people has been asking for it since forever. I wouldn't hold my breath for them being usable anytime soon.
---
I don't blame you for being skeptical about anything...it *is* the internet, after all. The website in question, and the person who made are it are, however, very much legit, and the website is and has been used by millions of people to check if their details are already stored in an existing list for quite some time. The only alternative is finding the files yourself and seeing if your stuff is listed there.
---
The safest route is probably only checking if your email appears in the list, and if an entry appears (scroll down and it will tell you what has been compromised, unless it's one of the generic lists like the most recent), change the password for every service that email is attached to - you should probably do this regularly anyway.
---
I still haven't done it, my Ranger is 89% and I do a zone every now and then. Will get to it someday.
---
Wait till you get to the HOT maps =)

4,5,6,7 and 8 all look identical sadly... regardless thats some quality post in my eyes! Now if you want the full res just check the wiki with the full alphabet :)

If you are at all concerned about the password entry, and I don't blame you, simply change the password to every service that the email is attached to and you should be safe.
---
I always back them up.  I rather not wait days to play.
---
I kept saying over and over again that "Lazarus" isnt real Lazarus.
---
Yes it is. Maybe they didn't call it "minion" but she is now connected to Aurene in the same way other ED minions are. Not every elder dragon strips his minions from their free will. This is actually only a Primordus and Kralk thing currently. (And Primordus only because his minions are created by fire and stone and not out of living people.)
---
Zaihtans undead minions had still a personality. Mordremoth entered the minds of Sylvari and converted them. Even Mordrem have free will when they are far away from the dragons influence. Svanir chose to get corrupted for power.
---
Every ED that corrupts one of the more intelligent races, leaves them with their personality intact. The difference between Aurene and the other dragons is, that she didn't influence Caithes mind and left her free will untouched. There is really not much differences between a Svanir, that got himself corrupted for power, to Caithe who chose to become the voice of Aurene.
---
I have the same infusion types. They have the same priority, even though their effects aren't applied alike, as the polysaturated doesn't apply the the skin of the player model in most cases.
---
Either Anet has to tweak the infusion priorities or we just have to keep re-equipping the polysaturated infusion when the effects aren't applied the desired way upon zoning.
---
I was referring to the old school Divinity's Reach  NPCs, like in the top picture, those have nothing to do with the town clothes system we used to have 
---
But nothing carries over to that alt , correct ? which makes it more restrictive than the account bound system of GW2. 
---
To add, you don't even need to hit/kill the graveling for it to drop, just be the last to enter the room :/

I don't know, she seemed very interested in the fact that blish got a robot body... I assumed she'd try to golemify herself instead.

At the vendor there is a Winterberry Bush Node, once purchased, you'll get a winterberry bush in your Home Instance that you can harvest once a day.

I see what you mean , it's normal to WANT the best gear , but if you aren't doing fractals , you don't NEED ascended gear anyway.
---
I thought I had this figured out, changed map to an empty one, killed the thing alone, It dropped another purple plate... picked it up, killed again... second purple plate.
---
Is this a joke?
---
Yeah, it was the things you mentioned I was thinking of. I don’t raid nor really do Fractals heavily, but I do like map metas and I wanted to try it out.
---
The Malyck story would be interesting, but I think that half of the community don't even really know about him. He was, after all, only part of the Sylvari personal story and there also only in one particular mission you had to work towards for even meeting him. If he would come out of nowhere with a small army saving the day against Kralk (or whatever enemy) people would be more confused than anything else.
---
We should forget about Malyck... When Arena Net implements his story now, it would feel tucked on like Livias story in LW3. A thing that just happened because now people can finally shut up about it. I personally like to think, that the big Tree we climb at the end of HoT (with the spiral) was Malycks tree and his "tribe" became the first Mordrem under the command of Mordremoth. This is in my opinion an better end to that Storyline than everything else Arena Net could do with it now...
---
Past 80 turn personal story and events to off to still see the map markers to point you to the stuff you have not done

---
While I appreciate your sarcasm, that is not the point. You actually do see a largely alienated core fanbase. And while there has been a massive increase in new gamers, these have been realized through the mobile platform and everyone trying to cash in on that with the cheapest and most horrible software.
---
It is no surprise that mobile gaming has a bad reputation among older fans. It was a new platform with new gullible customers, so managers predictably moved for the lowest cost possible. The demands on mobile gaming quality will go up over time, so whoever managed to cash in on the first wave has a good headstart when it comes to developing new projects.
---
The mobile gaming market in the west is already reaching signs of maturity: Growth rates slow down, investors cut their forecasts back to more realistic expectations. So while it is still growing in total, it may balance out for now. Meanwhile development cost starts to increase (higher budgets) as the mobile gamers move to higher quality games. As competition increases, your reputation becomes important. Pissing people off with cash grabbing becomes dangerous, unless you're too big to fail.
---
Also it's fairly common sense that a greedy monetization scheme can lead to the failure of a game. EAs Battlefront monetization controversy wiped 3bn$ off of their company value.
---
[https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/eas-day-of-reckoning-is-here-after-star-wars-game-uproar.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/28/eas-day-of-reckoning-is-here-after-star-wars-game-uproar.html)
---
A part of Anet's success is that they show restraint when monetizing. This requires managers to know restraint. And a great many TV shows have been milked to death, so the TV fans are right, when they say that. Sure, they have been replaced, the company may still be operational, but excessive greed can and will ruin nice things.
---
My bet is that they only have them modeled (well at any rate) for humanoids, and they don't want to spend the resources to cut holes in them for cats and mice. They have to save those scissors to keep hacking away at Mesmer and Boons, while also sharpening Necro Axes.
---
I wonder, from 1 to 9 it is pretty straight and easy to understand (The number of lines represent the number it is), but from 10 onward is a bit weird.

---
Worth noting that, outside of raids and fractals, Diviner’s is only easily accessible through trinkets - the weapons and armor are a huge pain to craft / stat-swap to. This is because they require an account-bound material that can only be acquired through the meta on the new map. Just something to keep in mind if you plan to get any Diviner’s stuff.

Being a sylvari main from day one made me take a lot of thigns for granted. It's only since playing through again as the other races that the flow isn't quite as good. The fight against Orr is led by Trehearne, the Orrians are right on the Pale Tree's doorstep, Caith - your mentor - is all about getting the team back together again, and then....

You might consider one of the 3000-series Ryzen chips. They've had significant changes that dramatically improve single-thread performance, to the point where there's little or no advantage left for Intel on that front. And they cost much less, too.

Hi guys, netsec professional here, it actually is safe to type passwords into this site to check them. Troy Hunt is legit and a respected member of the field. Though it is of course a good rule of thumb to be skeptical.

I never liked the idea behind the spider mount, because when I speculate about its ability all I can think is 1) climb walls or 2) draconis Mons web swinging.
---
Both of these would render most other mounts useless in my mind. So how do you think it would work? Again sorry if it's too much to ask, I just want to get into the headspace of someone who likes the idea of the mount already. :)
---
You didn't say shit about small scale. As soon as you have 2v2 or higher fb and scourge remain broken. Alternatives don't really exist. In wvw roaming and PvP soulbeast remains busted too.

Going to assume open world Pve
---
So weaver is a complicated, fragile class. And by that I mean a few hits and you can lose your health quickly so it's one of the classes you have to be extremely safe and cunning with. If you absolutely love complexity, weaver is for sure a class you would want to try. Their array of abilities can be overwhelming but provide amazing damage and utility that isn't found in other classes. You'll truly feel like a master once you nail this class down.
---
Now mirage is completely different. It has immense survival once you get familiar with their unique dodge. They have a lot of abilities to escape or avoid combat. They dominate more as a condi class because it's where they're given the most damage, but their power builds are still a good choice for open world pve. Like their theme entails, they use a lot of stealth and clones to make you lose focus and attack an illusion. The ambush techniques that they have are immensely fun that provide great evasion and damage. Playing this class has a unique thief feel that uses magic to get the best of their foe. 
---
I would suggest trying mirage first since you are moving on from ranger which is a safe class. Jumping from ranger to weaver is an immensely skill jump than ranger to mirage. Hope I provided the help you wanted /o\
---
Yeah but its still a 3rd party website...
---
I liked the map completion on the newest map from LS4 because there was a little jumping puzzle involved for one point of interest, which can only be done after getting some specific stuff from the map meta. 
---
Don't like the fact that you can buy those items for a combined 7-8g, but it's your decision to get them by playing the map or just buy them...which means that you'll need to invest the same amount of time for some other content...but as someone who likes completing maps, your propably someone who likes doing map metas anyway.
---
This has nothing to do with hipster gamers. It's simply that new gamers are easier to goad into buying bad games, because they have no previous experience to compare it with. When I was young, my mother used to buy games for my birthday, many of which I never heard from before. Some were great, some not so great, some were garbage, but I never held it against her, since she has no knowledge of gaming. Same with the new mobile gaming crowd, that has been growing ever since Android smartphones became a thing. 
---
It's simply easier to dupe people who are new. That's why people liked to tell the newbies in WoW that the thing they were looking for was in Blackrock Mountain.

Hah, I never said Arenanet did microtransactions "just right"! I'm just stating the obvious: They are not going crazy with it. Compare that to Gameforge, who want you to rent trading post access, or Archeage and their ilk, where socketing could risk losing your items, unless you pay for them to remove the RNG. Or EA, who fired a dev over his refusal to do microtransactions.

Also quite interesting how you flip flop between the stance that greedy managers do not exist:
---
&gt;This is nothing but the same moronic "managers ruin everything" bullshit  that has existed among movie fans for decades. It's fueled by a  complete lack of knowledge and the absence of common sense.
---
To the following stance:
---
&gt;And the old: "Microtransactions are evil unless they are in a game I  like. Then I'll bend over backwards to somehow explain how these are  done just right."
---
I like GW2 and GW mostly for their lore. I appreciate the second game for what it is, despite its flaws.
---
I did and you crying about how none believes in your heal chrono doesn't make it  more relevant. I'm not saying chrono can't heal. I'm saying if it doesn't heal better than fb, because it doesn't. 
---
Please l2p.
---
Pretty simple. About 1/3 chance. 3 times 77 is 231.
---
Yes but wouldn't it make sense the chance the number after a few thousand entries that seems to show this number is wrong.
---
Oh it's definitely a bug I'm sure, there's no way this design is intended. Try it for yourself next time though (until they patch it soon I expect) because I watched it for about 20 minutes and it definitely appeared to be a LIFO queue everytime, the opposite of what you'd expect.
---
You can either use their services or not use them, tbh. Is there a first-party website that provides the same function?

Congratulations

Letting players choose what they'll give will always ensure a use for the cheapest materials of the day.

It's just easier, even if it might not be entirely correct.

Just make them salvageable with the same drop table than ecto and dark matter would be "fixed".

Right on, cheers for the info, I'll just take it one step at a time then.

&gt; What do you think about it?
---
I think that claiming a difference based on brand is stupid. "AMD is bad for GW2 when compared to intel" means it's better to buy an i3-8100 rather than a Ryzen 5 2600X. That's mindless brand nuthugging. CPUs have prices and CPUs have performance metrics. If the sum of the performance metrics for CPU#1 is greater than the sum of the performance metrics for CPU#2, and they have the same cost, then CPU#1 is better regardless of who manufactured it.
---
You pretend heal chrono can keep up with fb in terms of susatined healing and has better burst heal. This is not true. It's sustained healing is more than a little bit behind. It's burst healing isn't better either. So as I stated, misinformed or bs. 
---
You don't actually send the password to the site. Your browser hashes the pass and then sends only the first five characters of that hash to the site. The site then sends back every hash thats starts with those five characters to your browser and the check is done on your computer.
---
well, off cd and spamming often is close enough. I guess. yea you are right.
---
Fairly sure Necromancer axes are sharpened with Shatterstones.
---
Sooo map completion is actually one of my favourite things to do. Got one complete and 2 around 60% (its way easier with griffon, just saying), I do this mainly for key farming.
---
Now my question and suspicion is; do key drop rates lower when the char hits 80? Before that my char gets keys more often than not, but after I hit 80 I never gain anything anymore. Could it be true?
---
Tempest is a lot worse at support than fb in wvw even if it can heal more. It's only advantage is its better for bad players because of its low skill floor.
---
&gt; What about Joko's powers?
---
Joko is a necromancer of high levels - lich, he studied that shit. Rez is not in his magic, it was his knowledge. So no second chances anymore.
---
Aurene on the other hand had to **replace** Big dragon and all that visions mumbo-jumbo, and the fact that big dragon had left the battlefield,  i think that's what happens - He is not him anymore.
---
Having gotten map completion in the new map, I have no idea what you're talking about, unless it's the PoI that they patched shortly after release to be more accessible.
---
Im a student, i dont have money for that :C
---
&gt; saddest event was in guild wars 2
---
Announcing alliances to early.
---
You can adjust your burst to whatever the time of burst is, if you follow the rotation on every phase like a moron then yes you'll do badly. While you still won't do as much as let's say a weaver on KC, the much higher DPS you do at other phases make you on par. If we are talking about something like Samarog then you always repeat the same short burst rotation and still do pretty nicely.
---
You sound like you don't play power chrono and if you do you follow a single rotation at every situtation and wonder it doesn't work.
---
&gt;Why would you take a power DPS to Largos?
---
Because i don't try hard and relog at every boss and it is fun to race with people that do. Even if i get destroyed by mirages due to confusion OPness (not just any "condi".).
---
Show me where chrono is lacking on this full clear logs as a power dps, mind you these are just weekly clears with good people but not perfect runs (unless i personally fucked something up.):

This is an overall fast run with pretty good kill speeds but people are obviously not trying their best, otherwise i'd be a bit lower on the dps ranks but not much.
---
It is one of the top dps and only loses top slot by a small margin. I'd love you to prove me your claim:
---
&gt;rarely actually come anywhere close to
---
tat's some strong crack you've got there. 
---
Okay, if yur looking for full blown damage, Weaver with a staff, hands down.
---
Just blow everything up from range.
---
Mirage has a Condition staff build, abusing Infinite Horizon to apply conditions to enemies, and the auto attack bounce also helps stack might and spread conditions to many enemies.
---
Mirage is abit safer due to mesmer's innate durability through clones and many kiting tools.
---
Weaver is basically looking at playing a glass cannon.
---
Now for melee builds for both : it's the flipped opposite.
---
Weaver Sword/Dagger are one of the most durable builds to play ; building a little healing power is all that is needed to ensure yu can heal to full in 2 skills, and with decently short cooldowns.
---
It also has access to alot of evades, further increasing its survivability.
---
Now with Mirage melee (Axe), it is primarily a condition based build, but in melee range.
---
People will tell yu that Mirage has alot of dodges, so melee is safe, but gonna go ahead and say it's not as safe as yu might think.
---
1. Mirage Axe uses Condi, and in PvE open world, Condi is way weaker than Power due to the fact it needs to ramp up to kill mobs.
---
2. The time taken to kill mobs is increased due to the fact it is a Condi build, therefore, mobs have more opportunities to smack the player.
---
3. Yu don't have infinite dodges, and certain open world mobs are known to deal alot of damage in short amount of time, especially in HoT, and the new LW S4 Branded as well.
---
Of course, this can be dealt with by practicing, and with practice, yu can pull it off without any problems.
---
If yur considering Power Mirage, then just go GS and nuke everything from range, or play Chrono and go for a Phantasm build or Danger Time build. 
---
All i can think of now is attach on titan and that scares the shit out of me.
---
is that a some type of crystal meth?
---

Such an insightful comment, thank you for this.
---
I kinda disagree that it's a big thing, plus I like my plushie griphon fluffy birdo, but... in a way, I agree I suppose?
---
That is to say, much like higher ilvl items trivialize old content in other MMORPGs, the vastly superior movement from mounts being available in old zones **does** trivialize some parts of the old design. Effective size goes down, effective time needed to completel something goes down, etc.
---
Whether I think that's a **bad** thing... hrm... not even sure. I mean on the one hand, I dislike difficulty drops in MMORPGs, OTOH it **is** very old content.
---
Good first reactions from people but HIBP is a very trusted site and built by a leading security developer. Do a quick google on HIBP and Troy hunter if unsure.
---
I guess you could read it as a corrupted "we for(e)ver"
---
This depends on a lot of things. PvE instances when you need a healer means they are relatively hard ones so people can be picky and request certain more popular support classes. In the end you need to get good in order to keep your party alive, and this requires experiences which is hard to get if you run unpopular ones.
---
In terms of just keeping people alive, I'd say the easiest would be tempest or scourge. Both have easy to use long ranged AoE heals/barriers and quick ressurect skills, but they arent that popular.
---
Yeah, that’s the one. You can just walk into the gate to get it now. No need to get past it unless you want to. 
---
Good to know. I did mention the issue where hidden skills weren't cooled down, but I still don't know for sure whether that would affect the internal cooldowns of skills activated by traits. I don't really know how I could find out without getting a bunch of people to stand still and let me kill them while timing the whole thing.
---
I'm working on it right now, basically a zone a day with a order based on feeling like it and Dailies taking place there. 
---
The early zones are a mixture of repetition and quirky little bits. It's quite relaxing, actually, as almost nothing poses a challenge and I'm just playing mini games. 
---
I totally, totally see why free-to-play people burn out and quit, though. It's so mindless unless you actively do dungeons, jumping puzzles and events to break it up. I've started using my mentor tag more and announcing events on map chat to try to break the silence a bit. 
---
I am 100% sure that adding map metas, or even more event chains would actually boost sales as the early maps are so large and aimless. We get a not insignificant number of people posting here saying "I don't know what I'm supposed to do" and probably more just abandoning the game. 
---
I do go on a bit, don't I? Well done! 
---
Staff weaver is still viable? I've changes to sword /dagger for raids and i deal like 10 times the dmg in comparison with my staff build... 
---
So, he was married, got a license plates for "We forever",  
---
then divorced and changed it to "Weaver"
---
you don't need those expansion's builds to get tomes tho
---
You've got a point about Joko. Because he had people do some awakenings for him too. 
---
I have an x470 motherboard, if I wanted to upgrade to Ryzen 3000 will I have to change my motherboard as well?

The little spirit up top was actually a late addition related to legendaries, which gave thr mini JP a purpose.

It's a Spirit of owl Spirit, fragments of her former self*.

Been thinking a lot, and I think Gorik reaction to his brother death was so sad for me.
---
Every time I see a post with Aurene in it and I see somebody saying some negative shit it's always you, VacuumViolator. Who hurt you?
---
... is that "Didya eat yet?" and "No you?"
---
Imagine being the vista designer when 80% of the player base stops viewing the vista in under one second
---
Oh man I saw that gap and thought maybe they've hidden something but gave up after the first attempt I fell
---
Most small trees have collisions for just the trunk, like a stick poking from the ground. You can bunnyhop on top of them.
---
Logs depend on damage taken by your group more than real healing output. "Good enough for anything in the game"... 1 druid is good enough for anything in pve in the game. See how this works? And in PvP wvw where you actually take far more damage, heal chrono isn't even a meme build. 
---
 Funny you won't even argue for what you claim is a no contest but you demand burden of proof from me while refusing to link build or logs or anything yourself. Even your first post stated qq none believes in this build but didn't back the build up at all. 
---
The reason I didn't bother past stating you were misinformed in the first place, no point trying to discuss with people whose ideas arent even close to reality.
---
I do it because I like the class enough to want to explore all over again with it.
---
 We are talkin about open world where it is viable (like almost everything)
---
&gt; if on a budget
---
Yes but as I said, 99% of the time an intel CPU (x+1)z00 basically costs the same as xz00. Replace x with a generation (8 =&gt; 9 here) and z with a range (4 here, but be careful they sometimes change z so that the model of a generation doesn't have the same z as its previous equivalent).
---
So even "on a budget", it's rarely good to buy old generation, unless you're upgrading an existing computer and are locked to that generation because the new one has a new socket.
---
This sounds like a nerf the classes post because of frustrating 1v1 PvP fights.
---
To answer the direct question, no these classes do not have sufficient tools to survive when a melee closes the gap.  You can see this by the fact that generally both Longbow range and Deadeye rifle are considered weak builds WITH the current gap closers in both PvP Conquest and WvW fights that are bigger than 2v2.  
---
Yes the mobility and range make these classes good duelists but still nowhere close to the being able to touch the top duelist classes such as mesmers.
---
If you consider the following game modes: Large Group WvW, Small Group WvW, 1v1/2v2 WvW, Conquest PvP, the mobility on these classes puts them around B+/A Tier on one of the modes, and everywhere else mediocre at best and terrible at worst. 
---
Oh wow, I really love this!
---
The idea of Balthazar being redeemed as we discover that "Balthazar" was really Menzies is great. Though, it does seem a bit silly that Lazarus was Balthazar was Menzies, but I suppose it's in-character. (Plus it'd be a shame not to have a unique reveal/appearance for such a mysterious character, but still, narratively it's cool.)
---
I saw what you were doing the moment Taimi showed up, but honestly that would be heartbreaking regardless and the soft calm reveal sounds like an excellent way to handle it.
---
But all of this sounds like a great catalyst, making sense but still stirring up all kinds of new story elements to launch us into LS5 and beyond. The Mists have so much possibility, and this sounds like a real exploration of that.
---
You're right, probably not gonna happen, but damn.
---
Most farms aren't solo, so the effect of food on an individual is frequently negligible.

You mods are literal nazis for not letting gw2 be a gay fur subreddit.

---
Seeing Rox show up at Eir's wake with Garm at the start of season 3. I was still dealing with a recent loss in my life when I played through all of the HoT content and that scene punched me hard in the feels. 
---
If it's a known issue then no doubt it's server problems. 
---
But Necromancers are really tanky and one of their elite specs can chill if they're already in melee range, so obviously they shouldn't have any decent movement skills! ^/s
---
Jokes aside, it's worth noting the Engineer's Mortar Kit is technically the longest ranged weapon in the game and Rocket Boots are a decent enough escape tool, but there's nothing about the Mortar Kit that feels broken or crappy to play against in WvW. The issue with Deadeye and Soulbeast is that they can down someone in an extraordinarily short time from half a mile away with very little warning and pretty much always get away with it, while you can avoid a mortar just by stepping to one side and then spitting on the shell after it lands in order to prove that you are the fearless orc leader despite your deformity.
---
People generally don't enjoy playing against Deadeyes or Soulbeasts who employ the tactic of: "If I push all my buttons and wait a second, does the guy on the other side of the screen fall over? Yes? Good, I win. No? Run away!", because that's not very fun or interactive gameplay. It also doesn't help that Signet of the Hunt is basically a 'fuck you' button to the most obvious counters and stealth allows for some of the lamest ganks imaginable. At least that's been my experience, I don't play WvW all too often.
---
I like it!
---
Sigh. Let me translate. “Swoop” isn’t the first escape/leap attack that the ranger has. The Greatsword 3 ability is essentially the same thing. So Soulbeast just added the ability to use it twice.
---
Now to the point. Ranger has no place in WvW raid/Zerg meta. We shine in roaming and havoc squads. Now most rangers will play full Zerk with a few opting for boon beast. Regardless, most play Zerk and are squishy. If playing smart, the ranger gets 1 passive to help alleviate any “OH SHIT” damage from Physical attacks and gets a heal to help with Condi. Otherwise, they are fucking dead. So that’s why Soulbeast need the ability to charge away and reposition themselves. 
---
I find it weird OP is complaining about mobility and the Deadeyes/Soulbeast, when there are significantly more OP classes. 
---
Not so hidden it seems, even i did go there xD  
---
You can get to out of bounds in the map in high areas.

&gt; As for crafting for profit, thats not really possible. The margins are very low, and usually the tp eats your profits.

I call this bullshit! Crafting is probably the best and most reliable way to make gold in this game, but i wont go in details. Will just put this here : http://www.gw2profits.com/craft_everything.php

Remove the fractals from your list. You can't go into fractal lobby below level 80. ;) 
---
Do people really not watch them the first time?  It seems like such a waste to not watch the 10 second video once, especially since a lot of them are pretty cool.
---
Hi guys,
---
I started playing GW2 a while ago but stopped because it didnt matter what I did, my FPS went down to 10 in big cities. I followed also online forums and posts and each one says the same: 
---
"GW doesnt scale with GPUs, but with CPUs. If you have a crap CPU, you are f*cked".
---
Can you confirm this? I dont have the money to buy a new PC or new CPU. I really want to come back, but the thoughts of the lag and bad graphics during raids keeps me from doing so...
---
Maybe they just don't like the game.  They seem to like the grind and enhancing their character's stats, not the experience of the world.  It's okay if GW2 isn't for them, and it sounds like it isn't.  They'd just get to 80, blast thru the fractials and raids and then say 'wow that was it' after 2 months
---
But jumping puzzle is the fun part, i enjoy it more than viewing the vista itself ;p
---
Yes. anyway my point is not to buy twice.
---
I mean yeah, I've seen a few of them all the way through for the first time, but that quickly ended in my noob experience when I realized that I've already seen the area and have better things to do
---
Caithe having to kill Wynne in the flashback from S2 - don't ask me why exactly; I simply find it to be oh-so tragic. All Caithe ever loved was Faolain, and as she starts to realize just HOW evil Faolain actually is she's "ordered" by her lover to watch over her fellow firstborn sister so she (Faolain) can get some stuff to torture her ... and then she has to kill her sister to prevent her lover from turning the Sylvari to darkness (Faolain later declares that she doesn't like Mordremoth either; but I bet if she had that bit of information back then she would've activeley sought out contact with her creator) 
---
I generally like the duality of Caithes character, and it really shone through in that moment! 
---
Same here man :/
---
Even if I've seen the area, many have a neat panning shot that shows it to you from a different perspective, and I always liked how it is a 'live' camera (I play a lot with my SO and friends and it's cool to see them bouncing around too).  If I'm just doing one for the daily or it's in core and I've done it on 6 other characters I don't watch it but if I've never seen it before I let it play out.  I think I have that attitude in this game because I never feel like I'm in a rush to do anything.  It's so much more about the experience than grinding / pushing to finish something
---
nice work, i myself am sitting at 80% with no motivation to continue since right when i was about to finish arenanet basically removed staff ele from the game so fuck that, areas south of LA can go in the same corner as wvw's stupid gift
---
Rifle Deadeyes have mobility because they can't survive in melee. They have to sit still to deal damage so they need to be able to reposition. Death's Retreat is to compensate for forcing them to Kneel.
---
1. Keep a archive of essential stuff like 2fa codes, 2fa back up codes, serials, purchase orders and stuff. this is essential in 2019 and easy to do on usb drive.
---
2. - no, you will get answer from support when support answer you.
---
I was just aiming at things for you to look at the bright side of this for.
---
I'm... confused.
---
I assumed it was open world.
---
I would be mad af to suggest Staff Mirage for Raids otherwise.
---
Not entirely true. I've speculated with some friends on this since the first appearance of Lazarus. Arena Net tend to tell a story through skills ingame. It felt strange from the very beginning that Lazarus used fire magic, even tho his GW1 skill set was a mix of necro blood magic and air elemental spells. Both skilltypes are a thing in GW2. But they chose to let him use fire. That was a really big hint that something is not right with him.
---
Actually there were a few voices on Lazarus being Balthazar (I remember myself voting for this theory) but they were very few as most went with Lazarus being Countess Anise or some other stupid kitten...
---
Past tense is yote. 
---
I had gotten world completion of the OG Tyrian before expansions and then have taken a long break since. Just came back and apparently I am missing one point of interest and I have no idea where it is :(
---
I hated getting the dark matter for my ascended sets. I wound up buying cheap exotics to salvage but now I have too many.
---
Yeah, it's true. The engine only really uses the first core of your CPU.
---
Well I mean I did, but it was like 2013 and I could access my account which also had a client download page as well as my serial number for the game. I thought I had it archived in my email but I can't find it 
---
I have 9 characters and haven't leveled any of them with PvE content. When i started the game back in 2014 (with a suggestion of a friend just like you) the motivation to keep me playing was tomes and PvP stuff cause everyone was equal in PvP but builds. So i've made my first character to 80 only using tomes. My first guildmates were shocked when they hear about it cause everybody was telling me that they were waiting for me at Lion's Arc and i had zero idea what the actual fck that Lion's Arc is. Bought HoT and PoF in 2017 summer at the same time while i had like roughly over 250 tomes then as you can imagine, there was no need to level up my characters with PvE stuff. After all these years, i still find PvE leveling sooooo boring, i still suggest every single new player to play PvP when they got bored of PvE.
---
There should be some good core builds around tho. I remember i was playing full crit staff ele and core condi necro and it was all good back in those days. 
---
This is crazy but I actually really like this.
---
Correct - you would need to buy path of fire and start playing that content in the story journal (only accessible on a level 80 character). You will quickly obtain your first mount and the rest will come as you finish the story (except for one special mount that requires some additional achievements).
---
Once you have unlocked a particular mount, all characters on your account can use that mount, even if they are not level 80. Some people boost a character to 80 and play the first episode of path of fire just to get the raptor mount for their low level character; it makes it faster to get around the world.
---
Ya know, I never thought of doing this. I might just do it, but then again using ArcDPS's build templates is so nice. 
---
If you participated in the first Living World, you can say you've been places some people will never get to be!
---
Is it kinda like [Beaker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaker_(Muppet))-speak?
---
Yeah I prefer the -10% damage trait like you, I just like seeing how many lil' critters I have up. It would be nice if that info was visible without using the toughness trait.
---
It broke Evon's heart.
---
3-9 just don't look like something from a numbering system that uses 0 to me.
---
I also feel like the 9 is a bit weird, the progression with the dots and lines from 4-8 feels like it should go on until 12.
---
If all you want is for it to be done, TaCo and 30 minutes here and there will get you through it in no time.
---
Because in few months ppl will open a post with title: Pls anet, give ecto new sink, its vendor value
---
what if i told you that a portal scroll doesn't have to be a gobbler?  My complaint isn't that we have a fucking teleport to vabi, its the fact that Anet designed an item and planned for it to be useless junk, but not a junk item you sell for coins.  
---
And here I am feeling overwhelmed by crafting Ascended gear.
---
A whopping 6 DPS.
---
Yote? http://www.luckyduck.com/yote-coyote/
---
Yeah, that's an odd move. At least make it a viable crafting material, but I didn't really find any use yet.
---
I am guessing it's easier these days to buy it fron raids or fractals than crafting. I remember it took me a while to craft my first set but eventually they started piling up in my bank from fractal and raid drops. I crafted mine when dungeons were still end content so long time ago xD
---
It gets easier once you finish the first one. For example, world completion gives you two of the gifts, so you don't have to redo it for the second legendary. Or for 2nd gen, you'll already have all your Maguuma Mastery completed.
---
are you sure that its on email 2fa and not text or app 2fa?
---
so this is the god emperor of mankind furry counterpart. neat.
---
I feel your pain, but hey, at least we have 6 million glider skins. /s
---
Well then yeah, if you choose to ignore a huge chunk of the pve endgame then obviously the dark matter gobbler wouldn't be designed with a player like you in mind.  Doesn't change the problem that a lot of players have an excess of dark matter and need more sinks.  I don't think sinks should be avoided just so players like you don't have to feel bad about the opportunity cost of using your dark matter on ascended rather than whatever the new sinks would be.  Its not like anyone is proposing everyone in the game just lose 1 dark matter per day or anything stupid like that, we are asking for options to spend them.  You would always have the option to choose how to spend yours.

The sale through the official GW2 website is over, however I’d look at the list of official retailers and see if you can find a good deal with one of them. 
---
Also, in most cases buying both expansions as a bundle will end up being cheaper overall than buying one now and one later. 
---
You can't since ages. They changed that with the fractal lvl 100 update. ;)
---
Unless the change got reverted last patch with the new fractal. But i doubt that.
---
Sorry, after seeing fractal levels reset twice, and then fractal cap raised once, I just sorta take max level fractaling as the starting point now.  Totally forgot people actually play t1-3.  Ill edit my post to say t4
---
Mounts released with the Path of Fire expansion and are a feature you unlock by playing through that expansion. There are 5 mounts to earn in PoF, and a sixth to earn in the Living Story Season 4 Episode 3.
---
You will need to be max level to do the relevant expansion content, but the expansion gives you an instant level 80 scroll + once you unlock a mount to use, you can use it on any alternate character you have.
---
I got that one I was actually missing like 3 POI total for map completion but now just one but I scrolled through every map to check and could not find anything :( 
---
I will go back again and try again. Hopefully the last two times I did that I was just dyslexic haha
---
I'd pay money for the realm of torments. Give us margonites back! 
---
It's the dark future, less a parallel world. The Mysterious stranger is the player character. He joins the inquest and bonds with Scarlet (Steam creatures).

Turns out using a composed password for every site made out a few simple rules creating a really long phrase that is very easy to remember but extremely long works rather well.

I bought the expansions at level 30 when it wouldn't let me enter lion's arch to progress my story until level 35 without them but haven't used any boosts yet.  I did take a break from HoT to go and unlock the raptor though because those HoT zones are fucking nasty in parts and just being able to run past a tricky group of mobs is a godsend
---
More like he's reached the peak of that tree
---
I don't get it
---
&gt; You can still have a quickness tank, however it would be easier for pugs to run an alcarity herald. 
---
No 
---
&gt; Firebrand can also fit the spot of quickness tabk. 
---
No
---
&gt;  Also can you show video your upkeep. The one you have are from golem buff
---
Every time I do it, I kill the thing a few times, then relog, get my plate, and leave.
---
Upvoting this!!
---
Thank you all so much for the answers, really helps give me a direction to go in.
---
Even if it's the most trustfull website... The fact that i have to put my informations there make these informations vulnerable once more... Right ?
---
It's so pretty 😍😍😍
---
We had him for such a short amount of time :(
---
Why isn't Chrono worth taking anywhere for you?
---
I love the guy who’s just sitting on his griffin obviously able to save him but just sits there lol
---
That sounds amazing! What weapon types do you use?
---
Was just coming here to say that this would make an awesome stained glass window or sun catcher.
---
Hello!  
---
I'm doing some legendary collections and realized they changed Gift of Battle to be on the wvw reward track and not bought through badges of honor.  
---
Would doing some eotm with a zerg count as part of the wvw track? 
---
Thanks in advance!!
---
That's what HoT is for,  the "parachute"
---
Probably. Feeding Hal in Ember Bay ring a bell...
---
More like your cpu. GPU is secondary
---
Yes.  Eotm is a popular way for non-WvW players to grind out the gift of battle.  You can also just do WvW dailies each day, or roam and take solo objectives every few minutes so your participation doesn't decay.
---
I once relogged after a few attempts, got into an empty map, killed it and got the plate for the treasure room. It was only my second room, so I skipped one of the rooms somehow.
---
I tried it and got stuck in the rock :(
---
Those are really annoying.
---
This is amazing stuff! I love your textures. There's this great sense of the sublime in them. 
---
I suggest waiting until you got the merchant mastery unlocked.
---
In order of release, while doing the story
---
The problem is right now, that i am not able to recover my account because i don't have the serial code lol? Is there a better way to recover your account?
---
I think the whole, "Lazarus is actually Balthazar, Balthzar is actually Menzies," thing would be overdoing it even for ArenaNet.  I do think that there's a chance we'll go into the mists and that LS5 will deal with either the Realm of Torment, the Fissure of Woe or a new continent.  I wouldn't mind having a "new" enemy in the mists to fight so long as it makes sense lore and continuity wise.  
---
Right now I'm getting a little frustrated with giving Elder Dragon's "mental breakdowns," when they're powerful manifestations of natural forces.  I liked that LS4E5 had us wound Kralkatorrik unlike Destiny's Edge, but I feel very much in-tune with, "If at first you don't succeed, try, **try** again" -- I felt like the opportunity to wound Kralkatorrik was a little too convenient.  I think that whether we're going into a Dragon's Mind (Mordremoth) or the Mists (Kralkatorrik) there's a potential for the strategy to start to feel formulaic. 
---
... and I'd really like to avoid an "Elder Dragon" style template because I believe it's essential to the gravity of the situation.  I think that Dragon's Stand really should set the stage for what taking down an Elder Dragon is *really* about.  I think that the demise or "mental-breakdown" of any Elder Dragon should be precipitated by both a physical, mental or spiritual attack.  I'm okay with going to the mists for lost knowledge, wisdom or consultation, but I'm unsure whether waging a "Mist War" is a good idea. 
---
Grats, I got 6 but have 12 character, I think I'm done.
---
Imo world Vs world would have been acuérdate since there are 3 taking action
---
I began playing one week ago, should I excuse myself for enjoying the game?
---
Quite a handsome charr :D
---
New on Baruch I see, feel free to ask me anything if you're new to WvW, PM me for game tag if u want to talk there ;)
---
Wow, this is great. It has a stained glass feel to it, your style is so unique! Congrats :)
---
Wow I did not think my post would blow up like this thank you guys for my first 1000 up vote post
---
I understand the altoholic angle. Got a Sirens Landing backpack for each of my humans and I’m still stockpiling for my other alts.
---
....all we hear is your shitty background music...
---
Harriers trinkets (the only worthwhile PoF stat set) are the exception to this. You *need* Living World 4 episodes, they're locked behind a heavy time gate, after you have your Difluorite Earring and Ring *what comes next*? The other options are stat-select from Raids or Mist Trinkets which require playing endgame content consistently over time gates.
---
Core Tyria trinkets are easy enough, exotics can be purchased with gold and Ascended can happen through laurels or even low level fractals. HoT trinkets require you to buy LS3 episodes, but you can get everything except an amulet and one earring (if you're not doing fractals) from one map.
---
The original name was WvWvW afaik, we just call it WvW cause it's easier.
---
Shiny!
---
&gt; open world
---
Don't take support classes into open world if you don't want to suffer. You have five character slots, make a simple DPS like a warrior or guardian (ideally Dragonhunter) and use that as your open world main. You can run some toughness and vitality on that class if you don't want to be glassy. Support classes are pretty much only useful for instanced content.
---
Never ;)
---
best traitor primarch you mean?
---
If you just want a way to level quickly, then consider the incursion events:
---
[https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/incursions/](https://www.thatshaman.com/tools/incursions/)
---
They give more exp than normal events and if you are quick to move about you can tag all 6 events.
---
I just waited for my server to have different colors. The only problem was the castle in the middle.
---
I would still make more characters because for me my characters have a personality, kind of, and not all builds fit them. I have a badass survivalist ranger that I use for soulbeast builds, and a kind empathetic one who is my druid.
---
And of course there will always be fashion wars.
---
With how alt friendly this game is, I don't think build templates would have that much of an impact.
---
Actually it was this episode for me. I mean we raised Aurene.
---
Idunno, I have world completion on 2 of my characters and I've never once seen a star by their names.
---
Not very elite anymore, I don't think =p
---
It’s a laggy mess. Shame it’s the best place in the game with nothing coming close. 
---
Well that's 2 each, of core and both elite specs or 3 each of each elite, all 9 classes.
---
I could definitely see someone wanting, say, a condi, power, and specialty (support, heal, skip, or some other novelty purpose) for each.
---
Way too many for ME, but I can see where someone else might be all about it.
---
Right now, the only doubled up class I have where I actually play both is mesmer, where I have a separate chrono and mirage.
---
Only if you do fractals regularly.  If you don't many of the other passes are quieter. 
---
My computer could not run with that many players lmao. It should with a Ryzen 1400 and 1050 ti, but won’t.
---
Definitly a personal highlight for me as well. It explains Caithe so well. And makes you real glad Faolain can't come back. Still have questions about how the Nightmare court works and if it's even still a thing.
---
I wish you got 2 gifts of battle for completing that track...
---
Agreed. I went with 8gb and kinda of regret it already.
---
Guardian is good. Very massive damage. Will also heal your team like super nice. Big fan 
---
The story of Apatia: https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Apatia
---
She's a Lionguard we run past during the battle to retake Claw Island who later joins the Vigil.  We run into her again during one of the Greatest Fear story arcs of the original personal story, where she tells us that seeing us is what got her thinking of the larger world.  Our mission with her is to retrieve an item from the Krait that fends off Zhaitan's corruption, however she ultimately gets captured by the Krait during the mission and our higher calling of returning the orb to Fort Trinity means we leave her behind where she is ultimately tortured to death in a Krait blood ritual.  
---
But this isn't her ultimate end, Zhaitan's forces ultimately follow us and take the Krait tower, turning her tortured remains that had been left in a cage on display into a risen.  We ultimately find her in risen form when we go back after the Battle of Fort Trinity and put her down one final time.  
---
She was Norn, and Norn mostly don't do burials in part because corpses and monuments to loss and sadness being about as inglorious as it gets, so the final piece of this story arc is going to Hoelbrak and telling her tale in the Great Lodge.  This is her legacy, the Norn find immortality through their Legend, and for that legend to live people must tell the tail, and that's what you and Trahearne go and do for her in Hoelbrak.  At the end of our telling, everyone listening shouts her name, and that is the part that always gets me.
---
I used to have this issue as well, and while I do think it's your CPU, my advice to you if you want to get back into the game would be to just avoid going to the bigger cities and play on best performance.  
---
If you need to craft something, instead of going to LA go to claypool or one of the other starting areas with a crafting station, there's usually a TP close by.  
---
HoTs might be a little more difficult as I remember my friend needing to basically port me through the map, but it might be more doable now that there are not as many people on those maps.  
---
I hope that helps!! and GL!!
---
No problem. Just see a lot of people stating that to noobies and it's a bit confusing.
---
Thanks for editing!
---
The materials, if opened on a level 50 character, are expensive and should be sold on the TP. You are not aiming for ectos here- level 80 wood, cloth, metal and leather are quite cheap, you don’t want those 
---
I'm still waiting to get the shoulders Countess Anise got on her outfit.
---
We got the same one without them, why?
---
Is melee mirage good though? I’m level 27 rn and I love melee with the dueling specialization. 
---
I don’t really like the warrior class, and the guardian class doesn’t feel as mechanically fun. So Mesmer is what I’m stuck with haha.
---
&gt; responsive
---
Literal opposite of "afk". Actively monitoring the game and responding to staff when questioned has always been 100% a-ok, the grey area was in **not** being responsive but only using in-game tools to reap rewards.
---
In case someone wants to dig a little deeper, someone asked a related question 15 hours ago on Security.SE.
---
[Why is breach-detection site “Have I Been Pwned” considered safe?](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/201698/why-is-breach-detection-site-have-i-been-pwned-considered-safe)

---
I play a support-ish chronomancer both in fractals and as personal story character (my main so yeah...)
---
And have a condi mirage that doubles as a pvp/wvw character but i never really got into pvp so it only had a few hundred hours
---
Most of my characters are actually just there for fashion wars and most of them run around in 2 greens and a blue, basically...
---
That doesn't exactly work for the Arkk storyline though which shows an external intrusion on the fractals by both a being trapped within a fractal and people from Tyria. 
---
Yup. The best definition I found was "to violently throw an object that you deem to be worthless, inferior or just plain garbage."
---
I'm 18 and I just learned this today.
---
I broke through the map unintentionally within 5 minutes of getting there before i even unlocked the new mastery. Grabbed one of the high chests in the spawn area, flew down then soared right up on the griffin and saw an outright gap in part of the cave ceiling you could fly right through.
---
Jup, you can check on gw2efficiency.com and if i remmember correctly, somewhere it shows the top ‘characters’ someone has and its 54 (iirc that guy even went on reddit or somewhere else to show them off, a lot of them had map completion)
---
After all that job, i will only think "sorry mom".
---
I love Lily of Elon tbh.
---
Much tamer experience, has everything I need save access to Fractals (but I haven't really frequented those much in some months).
---
When I got a 2 week pass to Mistlock a while back, I didn't see the appeal really. The gimmicky jumping got old fast, it doesn't allow for mounting, and people's infusions severely impacted my FPS. All I wanted to do was craft and a glowing massive Norn made even finding the crafting bench under his supernova body difficult. The other perk of "sending you back where you were previously" would be nifty if I don't tend to treat such hubs as gates between locations anyway, and Lily allows me to teleport to any Racial city and Lion's Arch for free, too. I don't recall Mistlock having that feature
---
You can use diving goggles and a loading glitch to mix and match outfits / helmets, but it doesn't mean Anet is going to bother putting in the effort, sadly.
---
I don't get why either one is even posted let alone upvoted. Neither takes skill or crazy amounts of time or resources, so I highly doubt it's about acknowledging particularly impressive achievements^^
---
Well, it's called Final Fantasy ARR!
---
Yes. To all of this. For a portion of the community. I like to think that I don't see stuff this way, even though I'm an experienced raider. I try to let newer players into my groups when I'm just chilling doing w1 or w4 with random pugs. I don't ask for kp or li, but I do expect that they put effort into learning *before* entering the raid, so they don't completely drag us down. I don't expect them to do even half of their benchmark dps or whatever, but I expect them to know the encounter, at least the basics, as that's something you can read online. There has to be a meeting in the middle where both sides are putting in effort. I think that it many cases, one side or the other is putting in no effort. Either the new player expects to be carried, or, ***more often***, the experienced commander sees "bad" dps (often only 2-3k lower than normal pugs but whatever) and kicks.
---
An endless gap year.
---
Skritt love shiny!
---
That's a little different in the sense that Mordremoth's "body" was his corruption. His physical manifestation as a dragon was quite small compared to kralk/primordus. Take a look at the world map somebody drew on the wiki, cantha is literally the size of the entire Maguuma Jungle + Kryta and some other tidbits, if that's Steve's back then when he moved the world would tip over or something.
---
Well now I feel like kind of an ass for wanting to play a offensive based Mesmer when I hit level 80 lol I didn’t know they were so broken.
---
&gt;Lily allows me to teleport to any Racial city and Lion's Arch for free, too. I don't recall Mistlock having that feature
---
It's the floor portal in the center of the island. Quite literally the same menu that gives you the option to return to your previous map. 
---
Me finishing world completion for the first time: "Why the others cities is do not well build like Rata Sum?"
---
Vegetable City a horror, Black Citadel? A Chunk of iron blasted on earth.
---
Nice, do you still play? 
---
Wooooah!!! Niiiiiice
---
If you upgrade the asura backpack enough this is what it becomes...

Thanks for the info! Sounds like ranger is a good starting point to be support or solo. 
---
Okay, really powerful trailer, I'm in love  honestly

AND FINALLY somebody using some in-game gameplay (made by the player).

It's really a good video and I'm absolutely not sad after seeing that ~~it's just the skritt who cut onion~~

Good shit, +1, thanks for the effort, hopefully people make use of it and we see some dope new comps coming to light.
---
Top 10 most dedicated gamers
---
You can never have enough :) Just finished my fifth world completion to make Howler....I have all the Ranger legendary weapons now bar the spear...
---
Mistlock Sanctuary isn't laggy! Most of the scenery is just the skybox/backdrop. It's probably only killing your FPS due to the player model limit being high.
---
The table is not there yet
---
Hold Alt+F4 then start the game and it’s there ^^
---
I'm working on unlocking the Roller Beetle using the [Dulfy guide](http://dulfy.net/2018/06/27/gw2-roller-beetle-mount-unlock-and-collections-guide/). 
---
Currently, I am on the Beetle saddle achievement and I need something called an Anomaly Spark. According to the aforementioned guide, I need to do the Ley-Line Anomaly event that spawns every 2 hours.
---
It mentions a Ley-Infused Lodestone to see which of the 3 maps it spawns in but I haven't had any contact with Ela Makkay NPC to get those yet. 
---
Do I just need to port around the 3 possible maps when it spawns and hope I get lucky?
---
Gratz! As others have mentioned it’s a lot easier now without wvw and with the advent of mounts but it’s still an impressive achievement. 
---
Or just bind it to one single key!
---
New to condi renegade, the usual Mace/axe and Shortbow Mallyx/Kalla build. I only really play open world and fractals these days so in general kill times are fast..
---
What are the high dmg skills I should prioritize?
---
I usually Axe 5 first to group enemies if theres ads   and then; 
---
Mace 2 -&gt; Mace 3 -&gt; Citadel bombardment, Unyielding Anguish -&gt; spam stuff
---
(If big hit box such as Octovine, world boss etc.)
---
Shortbow 4 -&gt; SB 3 -&gt; SB 2 -&gt; Citadel bombardment -&gt; spam stuff
---
Im not really sure how to be efficient with my energy, like what is and isnt worth using (like UA feels a little under par for 30 energy). Kalla I literally only swap to for energy atm.
---
Any insight?
---
Services are closer together and it has a unique aesthetic/soundtrack! I thought Lily of the Elon was good, but I thought Mistlock Sancuary was like *three times* better when I bought it!
---
Coming back from a 6 months break. Was disappointed reading about the recent chrono SoI changes at a first glance, but then I realized it is less pressure and more versatility now (and more fun). No brain dead rotations to spread boons and actual room to breathe and enjoy the gameplay. Am I correct or terribly wrong? 
---
Stood there for 5 minutes to listen to this frog and I love his music. I fell in love with a damn frog.
---
Eh, to each their own I guess. Like I said, I tried out Mistlock and it wasn't that big an improvement that I felt the need to buy the pass. But for those without a pass, or those that do like stopping in and returning to where they were, it might work.
---
Just sort of tired of people trying to push it as almost mandatory when describing it.
---
&gt; Am I correct or terribly wrong?
---
You are neither wrong or right, your opinion is completely subjective but at least you aren't trying to make it some sort of fact. The changes are received well by some people (like me) or seen as complete garbage (the typical "omg anet can't balance shit" ragekid), ultimately they are offering more diversity through them.
---
Ah! Scrapped def got a hit last patch but it kinda took another turn. It’s sadly not wanted anywhere but I still love the build. With the new Scrapper trait you now can have a extremely high CC pressure build and use the own higher superspeed uptime to have one of the best regenerative heal builds. 
---
It sadly has low boon uptime on offensive buffs and doesn’t bring any unique buffs. 
---
lmao I know it's a meme but had to ask: what exactly are you gonna share boon wise that is worth a damn?
---
Does Rune of Speed really give +99% mov speed? How is permanent superspeed not being talked about? Wouldn't this be great in WvW?
---
Hes rank 17 so... probably yeah. It's a cool scene nonetheless 
---
You can also check the timer and map spawn on wiki or any other world boss timer.
---
Not a bug, you have limited supply in your barrel, use your brain and you will find a solution, you have enough oil to do the trick.
---
You can only make 5 puddles of oil, anymore and it won't work. But if you're at the part I'm thinking of, you can make it go through the fence instead of completely around.
---
The Sylvari are undoubtedly the best designed race in the game, not just the character models. I mean, the characters have a dye channel for glowing spots on their body.
---
I'm not 100% on this, but I think there is a limit to how much oil you can put down at once, when it finally works I'm guessing it's because your first oil spot disappeared. Assuming you are going around that big fence, try going through it instead, the oil with connect on each side :) good luck 
---
I love sitting there during the night phase when verdant brink is lit up by fireflies (and fires from mordrem attacks but let’s forget that for now). It’s such a nice environment with his music playing
---
The Ley-Line Anomaly locations and times are shown on the [event timers](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Event_timers) tracker
---
Gah I wish I could trade in my Terrace pass for a discount on that one. Having two passes would feel weird 
---
Your choice, but they don't hurt anything being there so I don't see the point.
---
Yes it is but an indie company called anet can't do better than that.
---
Is it worth it to run pack runes while keeping berserker trinkets? Wouldn't that keep around the same dps while also providing 3 extra boons?
---
You are terribly wrong. Basically support chrono is now pidgeonholed into the "kinda dpsish" build similar to what people used to play on encounters ile sabetha. That build got somewhat buffed by the new soi, but every other possible build got outright ruined and chrono now has next to none  synergy with any other traitline, except for one trait in inspiration that is mandatory in 10ppl content. 
---
Gameplay  didn't get any better, now your boon uptimes largely rely on your squad members (both boon recipients and another chrono) and are potentially much lower (though you still can upkeep q/a at 100%).
---
I can hide the chat with other app you know.
---
Sounds like I have no reason not to really... I have a spare character slot from PoF deluxe or whatever. And I wouldn’t delete the Asura anyway bc of the above stated birthdays and maxed out crafting professions. 
---
Thanks for the info guys!
---
P.S. without and 80 boost (since I wasted mine to get the inventory slot opened). Is there a way to mass unlock WP’s like that perk from the 80 boost? I have plenty of the exp scrolls and tones so the actual leveling isn’t a concern.
---
There is also the one where you start the mission then walk around the cave and enter a small crack in the middle. Just do that 5 times at about a minute and a half each time and you’re done
---
There wasn't, and yes, it was epic, I recorded the entire fight. I love this game just because of these fights as you mentioned
---
You dont go afk on a SA map. Thats when the Shinanighans start.
---
Making those outfits takes time. And when they scrapped the town clothes system whatever NPC clothes they were going to make got scrapped too.
---
That doesn't mean they may never make them. It only means other things have been getting more priority.
---
Let's pull charr's tail!
---
Lot of the new player guide links seem to be broken
---
One of my favorite discoveries. Such a nice addition to the chaotic HoT. I hope they'll add more little "secrets" like him!

Gw2 interactive map.
---
This site displays the map fully completed so you can have it on your second screen. If you click on a poi or vista there are screen shots etc of how to get to it!

You can go about your merry way and then just call upon on on tips on how to get up to a vista, or enter an area with the poi.

Nah they have different ways and actively use them. A common way is to move you a few meters away from the farm spot and watch if you have any automatisms running still or if you realize what happened and walk back to your spot. 
---
Other ways are communicating over whisper chat and analyzing the responsive levels 
---
came back after 2+ years off; was mainly a PvP player -- now they're far and away the worst class for that. feelsbadman.
---
Can confirm. One of the best facets is that it also allows you to port back where you were at. It's also one of the smallest and easiest to traverse VIP lounges, and it doesn't have to load an entire map when porting to it, making it a fast load to boot.
---
I believe this is about accounts
---
challenge accepted.
---
Also notable is that yoink is the opposite of yeet.
---
Now you need to add that you started this jouney in 2012.

Same

And players are warned about third party apps.

You are supposed to be able to see the chat and GM chat messages at all times.

If you use some tool that removes it, you may be shooting yourself in the foot.

Thanks for the heads up! My email was compromised, I wish the hackers luck figuring out the new one lol
---
Home instance if you're human
---
Not really. They depend on reports.
---
So first players do the detection. Then, when someone gets enough reports or they are done with more pressing reports, they whisper.
---
Malyck said his tree was up the river, which would make it being Mordremoth's tree a stretch. I agree that Malyck is not as important as people think. With that said, I think they could absolutely tackle it, not for Kralk maybe, but eventually. They said that they don't want to rush stories to a conclusion and they have generally been good about this. Livia's story would have been fine as a Caladbolg Repair-style side story. The bigger problem was that it was so convoluted a way to get us into Path of Fire and seemed tacked on in that regard. IF they were just using it as a side story, they'd have been fine.
---
You know... back then, people had to play games by trial and error and use their brain. GW2 literally spoonfeds you on every single step to take. All you had to do was just put the oil in between the fence, after all it's mesh and the flames can easily travel through it.

You can enjoy it more with a more useful build.
---
U can create different builds for different games modes, like the minion heal, can use wheel of blood or consume conditions that will heal a lot more and come with a bit of utilities. Try change and test different things to see what can be activated more often e bring more help for the others too. (Y)
---
Maybe it's just that they forgot to put an infusion slot in it has me wary that it might behave differently. Suppose I'll try with my focus once they unbug the collection. :')
---
Pretty much this. A simple ammo counter on the skill wicon ould do.
---
Why don't you write in squad chat where those who took part actually see it?
---
Best capitol city in the game. Yeah, I said it.
---
You should never play Portal or you will lose your mind.
---
I'd like to see it more populated in certain areas. It's nice to relax by the waterfall, in the grass next to the tree above the TP/Bank, or even at the bar area, but people rarely hangout in these places.
---
Interesting what you learn at rather unexpected places :).
---
Farscape! 
---
The actual name is the Mist War, but only NPCs and lore-wise players use that term.
---
What happened to qtfy.eu? It seems to redirect to discretize.eu now.
---
I haven't played for a while. What's the best PvE Scourge build r/n? Is Power Reaper really stronger than Condi Scourge now?
---
My main used to be a Norn. They build this relationship between a Norn PC and Eir throughout the personal story. Her death absolutely broke my heart and I couldn't get myself to play the next parts of the story.
---
I never cared much for Faolin, but I hate her so much.
---
How would it eliminate afk accounts exactly?
---
Yeah, but the in combat cap is around 100% (400u/s), no?
---
Technically you can do with just one DPS. If you get skilled with it your DPS will be good enough for any boss. However, certain bosses and team composition will prefer condi or power. 
---
No kidding, we have one sort-of for the jackal in crystal oasis and that's it. The adventures and griffon challenges aren't the same.
---
Easier. Not better. 
---
That being said, it is much easier to heal on Ren because of Soulcleaver’s Summit’s insane lifesteal. It’s a large radius skill that will pump out loads of healing as long as your allies are attacking. The high-alac uptimes also help ventari pump out those high-health heals every few secs.
---
Hearld buff heals are kinda weak, and most cases the hearld will want to chose the other elite option which makes the passive effect of the facet percist for an aditional 6 seconds and applies the boons to 10 targets over 5, which is mich stronger than the realtively weak heals provided when you recieve a boon.
---
it wouldnt.. i mean.. just afk the rank until seasonstart in unranked..
---
How did you cut the print into the acrylic plate, and how did you setup lighting, if I may ask? Would love to reproduce something like that!
---
This thread is full of big brains
---
Didn't realize that price didn't fill, thanks!  Yeah, still a good value for what you're getting.
---
It was a viable healer, just not a popular choice due to the buffs provided by druid being so strong. Great choice to sustain a group of 4 weavers in fractals back in the day though.
---
I don't trust those websites what ask for account details to check if accounts are compromised. Maybe those websites are the problem in the first place. Never tell your password to anyone!
---
These people in these posts what tell "it is perfectly safe", I can't trust them either. They are just random persons typing random things on the Internet. They have to proof their claims first, show that they are the developers of those websites and show the source code so people can analyze it.
---
Something else worth noting is the ability to convert pristine fractal relics to normal fractal relics at a 1 PFR = 15 FR ratio.  
---
I still get misty when you're at the Eir tribute in Holbreck and Rox comes walking in with Garm, it's something about the way she says he followed Eirs scent and got lost in the jungle. 
---
Yeah, NVMe drives can be 5x faster than SATA SSDs.  Great for a boot drive, but probably unnecessary for anything else.
---
Yeah, I'd want to see some logs on fights that aren't golems like Sabetha or Overseer to back up such claims. 
---
isn't it how you inconvenience new players wanting to try the mode and let it slowly die? I don't do much pvp, but I haven't as of yet encountered many afk accounts if any, but I only do dailies so I don't know.
---
If that was true, we would have this sub filled with such posts everyday I guess. Because for real, everytime I needed to complete something, I gathered people on lfg and actually made it.
---
&gt;  competent people in open world is such rare thing
---
In case you are wondering why my comment, I just find this blatantly false and offensive for gw2 players.
---
Good to know.  I haven't tried it myself, but read reports that said 1440p@144hz was just out of reach for the 1060.  Thanks!
---
I got to 90% some time ago, but just had my first baby a few days ago. Maybe we'll complete it together one day :D
---
Ohh, thank you for the head's up! Been waiting for this to come back around so I could buy it. 
---
Yeah I went with an i7-8700 and a ryzen 2600 and I can't tell much of a functional difference in gw2. I assume based on reports of 9xx vs 10xx for Nvidia cards that a ryzen 580 would have no comparable difference either. Like yeah Intel and Nvidia are objectively better but I can hardly say they're worth hundreds of dollars more unless you just have that kind of disposable income. 
---
Hello, I am the supreme master root administrator of known universe and all the multidimensional universes and I claim that those websites are 1000% perfectly safe. Believe me!
---
&gt;You really want to argue with them
---
Sure. They also say power chrono rotation is:
---
&gt;Power Chronomancer has a high learning curve and is primarily recommended for people who enjoyed playing Condition Engineer in the past. 
---
Which is hilarious to me. It has a very easy rotation to learn, just need to learn a few diff rotations for bursts. It is **nothing** like condi engi in the past. The only "hard" thing is to use your signet with CS trick, so hard indeed.
---
Maybe you should make your own opinion, it does help. I showed you logs of a fast clear, i said i can show even more. If your only real argument is that it may be a bit behind another class on deimos if you farm it for best possible outcome, then i mean... it kinda proves it is really good does it not? Since they bench almost the same, and the diff between them in a real raid is so small. Does DH also not reach its potential or what?
---
And weaver cannot burst as much just the same with their cooldowns at plenty bosses is why you don't see them as much anymore. At bosses like KC where your rotation stops at peak time pre-burst phases you do a lot more than weaver which offsets the lower burst afterwards. But let's ignore that too.
---
Dragonhunter's short burst is amazing, long burst is worse and sustained dps is around the same. Look at how close the dps was till the very end at that deimos you talk about. But you can see the better short burst @ thief while at others not so much.
---
So i agree that DH beats chrono (and weaver too) on short bursts but only weaver at a bit longer bursts since DHs burst drops down fast. And for example do you know how much burst chrono does in 4 seconds vs dh vs weaver? It is behind but it is a very good burster still. It does around 52k burst in 4 seconds, which is plenty. It is enough for all skips in fractals for example the try-hard way.
---
Anyway, sorry for long replies but i try to type as much as possible otherwise people seem to think i randomly say stuff. So TL;DR:
---
In raids it does pretty good, almost as good as a DH on fights that DH is great and better at those DH is not good at. In fractals it won't beat DH or Weaver burst but if you look at fractals as a whole and not just boss by boss, you'll have a better time with chronos than weavers. DH is better still though even at that.
---
So yeah, my problem is you said it "rarely" reaches its potential while it is probably the second best if not the best dps to use if you don't wanna bother relogging at every other boss and be consistently at top of the logs.
---
The origin of the name was as Azeew said.  It is WvWvW but colloquially it’s easier to just say WvW.  Conceptually it is server vs server vs server, but that just shows that someone hasn’t yet been around enough to pick up on the jargon. (Again, perfectly fine, I genuinely hope you enjoy your time playing in it!)
---
Nice job my dude!
---
The last scene where the player character woke up crippling is my most favourite scene of the entire living story. The chat is still enabled so the player can actually immerse into the scene by acting out some RP lines. Not a RPer myself but I enjoy going with the flow by typing out phrases like: "Uggh... Aurene... Where are you? Are you ok?", "Baby, say something!", etc.
---
If you have any specific questions feel free to ask in this thread.  It's what we're here for :D
---
Logs also show what you click and do, but please dodge instead of saying "i don't have any logs". I doubt you ever equipped scepter with healing gear. :) Have a good day.
---
You want to level as DPS, even if your endgame goal is to support, as otherwise you'll just be plinking away tediously. The combat is active, which means you need to dodge, use your invulns, and murder stuff as fast as possible. The glassier you are, the better, as it will teach you how to avoid avoidable damage, to get you ready for when you are needed to heal only the unavoidable stuff in raids, fractals, etc.
---
Does anyone have footage over 3 servers duking it out without added music to the video?  
---
I would love to see that.
---
Any particular reason for the zerker gear on power firebrand? I've been playing with power firebrand for about a week and I've found once I have 100% boon uptime I have enough precision to have 100%crit chance with fury and retaliation up. So I can just run valk gear for my non-diviners gear 
---
My best moments in GW2 were sever vs server vs sever. We had an hour long fight once. Simply amazing. 
---
You must have never played WvW when the game first started.
---
This is also said in New England.
---
Ele glyph? Or did someone manage to land a springer up where he got stuck?
---
[I actually ordered mine from jmmods.](https://www.jmmods.com/gpu-backplates) Mostly because the lighting uses Corsair's iCue system, which makes the LED addressable in software, but uses a diffrent pin-out and connector than a standard LED strip. Also, what they did was engrave the artwork onto the acrylic, not really print it a such (thus the black and white limitation), so the light would shine through. I tried another company, but they simply printed the image and had some RGB accents, which wasn't ideal.
---
There are many tutorials on how to make an RGB backplate on Youtube, but in the end I knew I couldn't cut out such an intricate design by myself.
---
I agree! Never trust any external websites what ask for account info.
---
For those who may be interested:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oadp3nW01G8
---
Hope you do and congrats on that baby
---
That would remove ranked from the game ...
---
That's true too, anyway you slice it, fractals are a great way to increase the value of your account.  
---
Two problems with that, unfortunately.  First, Kormir says they already found a replacement for Balthazar, since when Rytlock says the Six are now the Five, Kormir corrects him saying that Balthazar is no longer part of the Six.  If the replacement is Menzies then he’ll have left Tyria with the others already.  If it isn’t, well the position’s already filled now.
---
Second, assuming [this weapon](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/The_Fate_of_Menzies) isn’t just some random thing a Balthazar follower made, Menzies is dead.  Balthazar killed him and chopped his head off.
---
It should run it very well.  If you're playing at 1440p you might have to turn down an odd setting (like Shadows from ultra to high, or Reflections from all to terrain&amp;sky, or Character Model Limit from highest to high), but you'll be able to run Shaders and Character Model Quality on high which are most important for fashion wars!
---
It's for cost/convenience. From a pure DPS standpoint you generally would want as much diviners as possible to reach your desired boon duration, because diviners provides free stats compared to zerk (4 stat items have a higher stat budget than 3 stat, and none of it is wasted with diviners). So you don't want concentration from other sources if you are absolute min/maxing DPS.
---
I don't understand this RP.
---
I don't, but in my healing build I've used in raids and elsewhere I never use scrapper. And I don't use HGH. But might is really easy on engineer. 
---
Fun fact.  Guild Wars 1 had different world completion titles for each region / expansion.  The more you know.
---
I do. First viewing is a must, but I'll generally skip it the second or third time. It is nice to revisit after a long time, though.
---
That's a nice achievement 
---
Super duper handy, especially in a shared inventory slot. Prob one of the best convenience purchases I've made.
---
K.
---
I don't understand these 1Password and other password storage applications. If they store many passwords on the Internet behind one master password, my logic says if someone hacks that master password, all other passwords gets revealed.
---
If those applications store passwords locally on the computer, maybe encrypts them, what if someone forgets their master password / formats computer / any kind of data corruption happens, how that someone can gain access again to accounts ever again? What if someone else hacks computer and copy&amp;paste all the password info?
---
Too many risks. That's why I never use any kind of password saving anywhere and force myself to remember every single password.
---
Mirage with an axe fights in melee range, so yes, definitely. You won't use a sword like with a normal Mesmer or Chronomancer, but you'll still fight in melee.
---
The Grove is my favorite city, as well as loving all of Maguuma~
---
Welcome to the game, have fun taking time to explore everything! The subreddit’s a great resource if you have any questions too
---
&gt;Open field 3 way orgies are much more fun than Lord room ones.
---
/r/nocontext
---
All the chrono build links are the same and use Mimic (?) I'm confused...
---
Funny stuff. SS isnt a hard or challenging instability imo its just terrible and sucks enjoyment out of playing because your movement is fucked up for the entire duration of the fractal. Yes it has counter play ie re-learn how to move and use any skill that affects your movement.
---
Did you guys still move like SS was on even after you left the fractal? I always move like SS is still on (for a bit) after playing with for a while.
---
I mean the HoT maps provide the gifts if you're going for Gen. 2 Legendary Weapons, but yeah I agree.  I'd like to earn a few gold or some guaranteed Black Lion Keys or something.
---
I still find myself unable to make this armour just because of the fact I would never wear it.
---
It’s like a trenchcoat but worse with all the stuff on it lol.
---
Back in the day we were pidgeonholed into domi-inspiration to distort stuff. Then we got pidgeonholed into insp-chaos for the boons. Now the only freedom u have is how much u wanna min-max for encounters if u wanna bother with min-maxing that is.  Ofc chrono was OP back then u could hard carry even the worst group with timed distortions/stability and ez boonshare.
---
Druids could just camp staff and it wouldnt make any difference. Dps could run around, fail mechanics,position completely wrong, afk and they would still have perma boons. No1 new what cc is cause moa was the most broken thing in the game (boosted with para sigil).
---
Overall chrono gameplay hasnt changed that much since the nerfs,if anything it got harder. U actually have to stick to a rotation now instead of mashing buttons and crapping out boons like a mofo. Dps have to position properly which is their problem and no1 else's. And u can for once actually contribute to dps without running a super min-maxed build that depends on casting tw out of cs and is only usefull on golems such as MO (bosses that will die easily regardless of build), and even then u might even drop boons.  
---
The gameplay used to feel much better b4 cause chrono was the uber, be-all-end-all support in the game hands down. Now its just a support.:(
---
True
---
Good job Tibalt
---
This is excellent.
---
Whats the build for firebrand tank or herald tank.   Give me the ideal comp  no chronotank 
---
The backplate by itself was €70, including shipping from the US. Sure, there was the artist's commission fee, the cost for Corsair's RGB strips and controller, the vertical mount (also shipped from the US). And the computer itself, obviously. Only the finest, dragon-covered motherboards for me.
---
[The full total (as well as extra pictures) can be seen on PcPartpicker.](https://de.pcpartpicker.com/b/49LJ7P) Mind you, I planned all this over the course of a year, I didn't spend it all at once.
---
Is this giftable?
---
Thank you for your insight.
---
Fair point, speaking of which I should probably pick one up for my own alt account.
---
Was thinking would it make sense for random pug runs to use a full set of Diviner's with Pack runes, Concentration sigils and boon duration foods (maybe even Chaos traitline)? Just to make sure they have all the boons they need whole time, because pugs tend to make mistakes etc. other culprits. Chrono of course might make mistakes too.
---
[Yeah, but this guy isn't a new player xD](https://old.reddit.com/r/Guildwars2/comments/ah70tx/just_got_world_completion/eedj78y/)
---
Yeah, the whole Crystal Champion track is locked unless you have Istan.  I have everything *after* Istan, and figured I'd wait to get to it until I get further through the huge pile of stuff I already have to do (maybe it'll have a "complete LS4" bundle discount by then, right?).  I wasn't going to get the tools, since I already got a bundle with unbreakable tools and those things are *way* too pricey to double dip.
---
Just wondering how much VM I might be missing out on if I don't poke around Istan first and get the track unlocked.
---
You only need to lower primarily CPU bound graphics options because the CPU is your bottleneck in 99/100 of clusterfucks like these; lowering options that primarily affect the GPU will result in the game looking drastically worse and won't increase FPS by an appreciable amount.
---
The most important CPU options to turn down are shadow quality and character model limit.
---
I feel like the story and events are the way to go when it comes to leveling. I actually like the story of Guild Wars 2, and have come to like the characters that Anet created. As for events, some are just so engaging, that with enough time in the open world, you'll just get pulled into them without realizing it. 
---
Sometimes, I'm out just farming iron/plat while sitting in the PVP queue, and an event will take place. I'll go, "Eh... why not? It's right here." The next thing I know, I'm leaving the pvp queue to just run around the area and look for quest chains.  
---
The same can be said with doing story. On your way to story events, the world events are so enticing that they may deviate from the quest line to help out a village of Quaggans, encouraging them to explore the area before moving on to the next narrative beat. 
---
Leveling to level is pretty boring. Playing the game's story will eventually just level you. It will lead you to dungeons and just create some world building. By the time you realize it, you're invested. 
---
Cool. I was mostly curious about the backplate and commission. I love the artwork. 
---
ty for the effort my static tried booth the hybrid and FBrigade yesterday, it really feeels like relearning the content lul
---
Dunno, but I'd take one :)
---
wow I didn't know he plays that many variations, feels like rediscovering sth new!
---
Woah, how do I get this done?
---
I think Kobe is more for difficulty/ridiculousness of the shot. Falling backwards on your desk chair while trying to throw a pen into your pen holder is a Kobe.
---
It’s called World vs. World in the UI, so yeah it depends on your context.
---
Valkyrie offers no offensive benefit over zerker and the extra health is considered to be redundant, since you can survive everything in zerker. If you lose reta, however, valkyrie damage will nosedive, while zerker damage takes a minimal hit - and reta coverage generally is worse than stuff like might or fury.
---
This reddit disappoints me.
---
Yeah, the commission fee depends on the artist. It's not cheap by any means, but artists need to eat as well :)
---
So i would say for some encounters it definetly is meta, we tried it a couple of times with 1 chrono for quickness only. I will just list the Problems we encounter while running the comp:
---
* Sloth: Lack of Pulls for small slublings, prob. could be solved with a fb tome 1 pull and druid axe 4 
---
* VG : Lack of 2nd Entagle for Seeker, solved that with running 1 condi sb 
---
* Sabetha: If the Druid kites we lacked quite some might and if the renegade kites we lacked alacrity 
---
* Qadim: If you wanna run the Comp you definetly will need a solo kite
---
For all the other Bosses you can run the comp without any problems.
---
I know the mentioned Problems above can mostly definetly be solved, we just couldn´t since some of our group just lack the motivation to play the game outside of the raid times we have.
---
Also note that if you wanna have the Chrono still tank he can´t run full berserker/assasin/diviner since fb gets 250 tougness via traits + renegade gets 100 toughness while in demon shourd(elite)
---
In general i think for the most bosses you can achive better results with the fb/renegade comp since fb can give perma quickness with dmg on par with the bs + renegade can heal way more than a druid
---
"Humans fear me" XD Really like the glowing effect on his horns, fur definitly give him more necro vibes and from art perspective really good job with fur and shapes ! For some reason my brain thought "but these teeth..." of course in positive note. Feeling like necro gonna go eat sth really soon xD
---
You know, you can open your own arena and invite the best players and play against each other....without afkers and infinitely long.

 This was unintended and we have a fix coming soon™. Individual players should be able to earn achievements even when partied together, as long as it makes sense in the context of the achievement.

Meanwhile i've been eyeing up the sylvari one that's the closest thing to skimpy male armor i've seen lol
---
Holy shit. I've watched this 3 times now, and I can only say....Well done. Well fucking done. It's a masterpiece. It was expertly woven together into something that Arenanet themselves should use to promote their game and current campaign.
---
Why you have the permission to kick players? You sound like a really sucky commander honestly.
---
I think this is a very bad idea. I’m fairly decent at PvP - can push upper tier of gold rank, but I’m only level 53. This would rally out a cap on a lot of players who want to compete but just haven’t put the sheer number of hours it would take to get 50+.
---
That should only really affect the GPU much because it doesn't change anything about the main CPU hog (other players), I haven't tested that setting in particular yet though.
---
"""Technically""" Firebrand does. Stand Your Ground + Stalwart Speed. I wouldn't really count it though, and I do agree that Feel My Wrath should have gone to 10 man over SYG. (Really? The ELITE shout has a lower target count than a utility?)
---
Never been that big on RGB lighting but man. This is a very compelling case..... in both definitions.

How do you get the QR code? im using the text verification and i got no QR code

You won't be laughing when some archaeologist digs up your security code in a thousand years and breaks into your GW2 account.
---
That's sick artwork dude.
---
I'd personally kind of love to see you do Balthazar in this style. With the orange-gold eyes and background.
---
For Sloth, don't forget that FB axe #3 is also a pull. In my experience, as long as you don't tank him in the outer areas and as long as the FBs remember that slublings are their job with axe #3 and F1 #3 (which fits into the rotation by replacing the one #1 cast), he's not a big deal.

"hacking the master password" isn't something that will happen. Barring a keylogger, in which case it's actually safer to have something like 1password as a buffer between everything else. 
---
As far as data corruption goes, a good password manager will encrypt your information locally then store the encryption over the cloud. Outside of that, you can manually store the password data on an external drive as many times as you like. (Which you should be)

How can you be so sure that people is going to hate the commander ?
---
I've read this theory here and there, but given the fact that he saved Tyria and Elona from two dragons and a god already makes him special.
---
People will probably be scared, loose hope or something, but I doN,t think they'll judge the PC as responsible for what happened.
---
&gt;I don't care how it looks that much.
---
There's the difference between you and me.
---
Also, it's 0-2 settings you need to change (depending on what settings you normally use), it's not that hard.
---
Once you hit level 31 you'll have access to the full four per mode (12 total) so you'll have a few more to pick from. Once you hit level 80 with at least one character then your possible options will also increase (Orr gathering and vistas get added among other things) and having an xpac on your account means dailies from those maps will cycle in as well (bounty hunter, adventurer, etc).
---
They make books but dont gather around once a month to discuss the latest best seller

It looks a bit more subdued IRL, but it's hard to capture something like this on video.
---
Agreed, especially the ghostly city. GW2 just does night right!
---
condi is axe/torch + pistol
---
My only regret is not having even more dragons. The fan grills have soem on them, but they really don't stand out as much as I would've wanted.
---
Exactly the place I had in mind hehe
---
Thief in spvp is basically just cap/decap. Your job is not to fight, it's to be agile and mobile and capture/decapture points as fast as possible whilst the enemy focuses mid. In WvW you've got more options though. It's a shame since thief is my main class, but it's just going to lead to people yelling at you if you don't follow the meta.
---
Yeah I did build it on my own 
---
Do we get prints too?
---
What has that to do with tying books all over a large stick and using that to hit people?
---
YES! I can only assume you have suffered too. For a solid 10+ minutes AFTER the fractal I'm still moving as if I have SS on me hahaha

They will most likely kill me

Naaaah you try to kill me :P but I kill you... Reminder we won the war ;)

This video reminds me why I just don't bother with raids or fractals. I like having fun and getting cool skins but it looks too broken to even bother with. If I wanted to get trolled, I'd go fight permanently stealthed thieves or gamble with gems.  It's nice to see someone getting something out of it.

So do dragons have to bang to make a scion or do they just make them out of magic or what?  Is that ever directly addressed?

---
The book club is where you go to find out the heaviest and best books for hitting people with. Thats why its a Norn tradition
---
I don't believe it was ever directly addressed, but now that you mention it I think we should drop the entire current plot and refocus the entirety of LW5 on this topic.
---
It does suck if we kill any more dragons without something to take the magic Tyria is fucked.

Yes, currently gw2skills doesn’t have Diviner’s so Grieving is substituted instead so its easy to calculate (they have the same stat numbers, just with Concentration instead of Condition Damage). Just assume all condition damage points are concentration instead, use formula 15 Concentration = +1% BD, and you can easily calculate what your total boon duration would be.
---
I agree with you, the only place staff feels really great is in WvW zerg fights
---
Unless you're playing deadeye ( i.e. thieves who can't play thief ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) then, sad to say, you won't be pulling off many one shots these days. [Thief has been nerfed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=faDPumqG4D0) so frequently over the last few years that it's a shadow of what it used to be. 
---
Don't let that discourage you though! It's still one of the most fun classes you play imho, and while it hasn't been my main for about a year I still regularly hop on my thief to roam. As another commenter mentioned in sPvP your job is to cap/decap and +1 fights, not fight. 
---
&gt;  Is thief a difficult class to play in general?
---
Along with mesmer it is the most mechanically challenging to play. 
---
There are many tricks and mechanics you need to understand will to effectively play thief - but for the most part none of them are particularly difficult to pull off. You will have to practice your Black Powder + Heartseeker + steal + Backstab combo a fair amount to make it second nature though, this would be the "one shot" combo for D/P thieves. 
---
It's a blast, so much to do 
---
been running rene + firebrand combo instant of chrono +druid in my static fractal group runs and can say that it is definitely much better then the regular comp, group just has much better dmg overall and more useful utility i would say.
---
Esp if you can run with a soulbeast for spirits this should always pull ahead.
---
Yes to everything.
---
Out of all MMOs, GW2 is one of the more friendly to new players. There's a bit of a climb at the beginning of the game for new players, as they learn the ropes, but other than that, you can get caught up pretty quickly
---
Playerbase is healthy and friendly, and the game without expansions is free to play so go ahead and just jump in
---
With MMOs, a big part of it is that you get out what you  put in, because you're part of a large multifaceted world. So if there's something you want to do, then you can spend time doing it. I'm at 2300 ish hours, I know some people are in the 10000+ range, etc.
---
It's honestly better with friends, since MMOs are largely social games. That being said, you can also easily make friends in game itself or at least playing partners by joining guilds (try r/guildrecruitment)
---
1. Very friendly to new players; the main world is pretty easy, and the challenging foes are marked on their portrait.
---
Also the base game is totally free, with a small number of restrictions for being free. 
---
2. The player count is good! The game operates on mega servers, so if you're on a pretty empty map, before long it will ask for you to go to a populated one. And I always see players getting on with the game. Plus some events on maps will bring players their to deal with the event. 
---
3. You can totally spend hundreds of hours on this. But you're also not required to spend tons of hours to keep up. This game uses a horizontal progression rather than vertical -- your stats don't get bigger, they become more focused for what you're trying to achieve (in terms of end game anyway; numbers definitely get bigger as you level 1-80).
---
4. Can be very fun with friends! Group events pop up on maps, and plenty of content you can engage with friends at end game, such as Fractals, Raids, PvP, etc.
---
Wow. I just tabbed out after having flown around the mountains above the Forge,  Auditorium, Grotto and the Grand Lyceum. That place looked wicked from above. All those pieces crumpled together to make something that looks really nice from the inside.
---
  [Here I am on top of the mountain :)](https://i.imgur.com/kHc4eRL.png)
---
I love these kinds of zerg-on-zerg-on-zerg fights. Because they draw whole map queues to a single area, they're the perfect opportunity for a small mayhem group to quickly paper a fully fortified keep or tower, literally anywhere else on the map.
---
What? It beats standing in one area for hours trading loot bags.
---
I've joked more than once about winning a zerg fight by setting the enemies' graphics cards on fire.
---
Removed: Warned you the other day about posting more of these.
---
That being said it is cool - but it's not a topic of discussion. 
---
1) I'd say so, yes. The community is great, and as MMOs go it's pretty easy, particularly early on. Looking up guides can help, but that's true for most games, and I would personally recommend figuring things out for yourself if possible.
---
2) We don't have official numbers, but GW2 is generally accepted to be in the top 5 most popular MMOs so there's no shortage of players. The game also uses a "megaserver" system which helps ensure that even when there aren't a lot of people online, they are all concentrated into a small number of instances.
---
3) As good as any MMO. It's not as grind-focused as WoW, but there's a huge world to explore and loads to do in it. I'm willing to bet that most players who frequent the subreddit are well above 2k hours at this point.
---
4) If your friends enjoy the game, sure. There isn't as much of a focus on Dungeons, Raids and similar late-game group content as many other MMOs, but there are sill plenty of options and playing with a group can be great fun even if you're just exploring the overworld.
---
As an aside, the late game is more focused on horizontal progression than vertical - reaching the level cap is very much just the beginning - so don't expect to be constantly leveling up over a thousand hours of play, or for the level cap to increase when a new expansion comes out. There's still a lot of progression after you hit 80, but it's a decidedly different experience from a more standard MMO.
---
see, r/GuildWars2. this is how you create character development.
---
with very little forethought (all things considered. remember when we *weren't* supposed to kill Elder Dragons?), we as the PC/Commander went headlong into a battle in which the odds were stacked against us. a battle in which we were rushed to prepare for, using a tactic that was thought to be risky by just about everyone who heard it. it was bound to fail, and because of that failure that *we spearheaded*, we should pay the price for it.
---
I think it'd be great for the PC to have a "I failed and I deserve the backlash. how can I make this right," episode, instead of a, "well, that sucks. but we can do this team, just believe." would go a long way to show our character matters to the story in ways other than the "well, they've been there for every major victory," shtick.
---
Nah, you're just stupid. ^^^^/s
---
Yeah, because Harrier does no damage. Harrier Renegade is still good as a healer, while Diviner is more of a DPS/Support (like Warrior)
---
1. It's easy to get into, except end-game group content. The only thing really worth looking up for normal open world play, is some proper builds when you get to max level (just as a basis for making your own; no need to follow it exactly), which will set you up for all the level 80 content, which is most of the game now. If you decide to try end-game group stuff (fractals, raids), then many will expect you to look it up and know what you're doing, or seek people in-game that are willing to run through it with you. However, for the vast majority of the game, you can figure it out at your own pace. 
---
2. Very stable, as far as I can make out. I regularly play a map meta event (good way at making money for a small time investment) which runs once every 2 hours. No matter the time, there's always at least one full map (which is 50+ players I think), and often multiple. And that's just in that area. There's always players around, and even if there aren't as many as normal, the events scale to match the number of people that are participating. Asking in map chat for help at some group event will usually have a few players turn up a couple of minutes later. I have not noticed a decline at all since I started playing over a year ago. 
---
3. Definitely, there is a lot to do (and I'm not just talking about grind). Just looking at how much story content there is now, it will keep you busy for a long time, and just gets better and better as you go through. You've got 9 classes to play, but each expansion adds an elite specialisation to each class which can completely change how it works, so effectively there's 27 now (but since you can change specs at will, you don't need that many characters). There's a massive world to explore too, which you get rewarded for. 
---
4. Can't really answer as I don't have any friends that play, but I would think so. The game makes it very easy to team up with other random people in the world when there are dynamic events, so if you're running around with friends I imagine it would work pretty much the same, except you'll actually know the people you're with. 
---
One extra thing I will say is about the expansions. In addition to the two main ones, there are the Living World seasons. They're free for anyone who logs in while the latest episode is active, but after that, you have to pay with the premium currency. You can transfer in-game currency to pay for it, but as a new player you'll be wanting to spend in-game currency on outfitting your characters. If you want "everything" (which I do recommend if you care at all about the story), then factor this into the price. It does seem like it increases the price a lot, but if you consider the lack of a subscription charge, and the fact that you won't have to pay for any future Living World episodes (just full expansions, which aren't that common), it works out much cheaper than WoW if you're planning on playing over a long period of time. 
---
Congrats it’s feels all worth it when ya get that legendary haha and hope you enjoyed the journey!
---
Before getting ascended Harrier, i suggest you to mix Magi and Giver exotics. It worked for me. You will have enough toughness, healing power and concentration for every content. Just be careful about toughness if you want to do fractals. Don't craft them it's waste of material. You can buy them from TP and they are pretty cheap.
---
Okay that's what I thought. This Diviner build is exciting
---
expect to be disappointed in everything else after you play this.
---
enjoy your new home and new friends.
---
Can I take this shitty pic and repost it every 2 months or so for ez free karma?
---
No worries, and you're new so let me provide a bit of context. We have in the past, and regularly to this day, get people who try to use this sub purely as a means of getting viewers to their videos or streams (mostly wvw roamers). 
---
This is why we have the 80/20 rule: 
---
&gt;For this reason you need to follow the 80/20 rule. To put it simply, the amount of your own content in your history should only be fifth of the total amount of activity in our subreddit. Ignore this rule and your content will be removed until you meet the criteria.
---
Looking at your history you're just getting started with a youtube channel roaming in WvW. It's also apparent that you've only been using reddit, on this account at least, to promote your videos/advance that youtube channel in some way. 
---
There's nothing wrong with this, but you're also not actively participating in this community. You're posting multiple chat covers, and given the above it feels like a roundabout way of self promotion.
---
Whether or not that's true, I would suggest just picking one and start making videos. Personally I don't pay much attention to the chat cover and I doubt many others do either, it's the content that matters. Also as long as you actively participate in the community we won't have any issue with you posting your videos from time to time.  
---
Why has nobody pointed out that your chrono variants all link to the same build?
---
so i've been "pwned" according to this website (surprise?)
---
but this 1password thing only offers a 30 day trial before you have to buy it.
---
so thats outta the picture. 
---
So, do I just go around changing my passwords on everything now and call it done, or what?
---
(Would like to know what other people did here)
---
&gt; Friendly to new Players
---
If say yes with a caveat.
---
From the games side, the tutorials an onboarding process aren't very, well, good. Unfortunately that means your first 10 to 20 levels can be a bit confusing.
---
I have a guide I the together for a friend that I'll edit in here after. Hard to do it on mobile.
---
From the community side? Incredibly. I'd say it's actually more friendly to new Players than to existing ones. No matter the salt or toxicity, pretty much everyone puts that aside to welcome a new player. Tyria is home to a lot of us, and it's always nice to have someone join us.
---
&gt; Population.
---
It's healthy and possibly even growing a bit in the last year.
---
You'll be able to find groups for almost anything, and in a reasonable amount of time unless it's at 3AM (You'll still find groups, just will take longer)
---
There are a few dungeons that you might not find groups for easily, but that's more because they're very long and don't give a proportionately higher reward, not because lack of people.
---
Even on the PvP side which is smaller than PvE, queue times for 5v5 are almost always under 3 minutes, and World vs World (Big open world battlegrounds with seige weapons) you'll usually find at least one person commanding even on lower population teams.
---
&gt; Time Sink
---
Just doing all of the available PvE content once without every repeating anything takes literally hundreds of hours. Just doing all the story (You will have to buy some of it) without doing anything else will take over a hundred.
---
My "hours played" is highly inflated because I often leave the game on at work, but I imagine I have about 2500 hours of active playing. I've taken breaks here and There, but I'm still not done everything Id like to do.
---
&gt; Fun with friends?
---
Absolutely. More fun with friends
---
**Bonus**
---
&gt; Progressing your character
---
GW2 is different than other MMOs in that progression purposely tapers off at max level.
---
It's really really easy to get the second best weapons and armor, and only a slight grind to get the best.
---
It's really about you as a player getting better at that point. There is a gigantic gulf of a difference between a skilled player and someone who doesn't care, even if they're wearing identical armor with identical skills.
---
I enjoy slippery i always wanted more instabilities that effected the environment rather the played. It shouldnt be removed i think stability should negate its effects.
---
gunning for full ascended
---
raids have ZERO appeal
---
Pick one lol.
---
But I can do a very neat panning shot myself... On this cool grif I got here. I don't see why I should watch the vista one instead? 
---
Ahh I understand now :) thank you I won’t post my vids anymore or anything I didn’t realize it was like that and do apologize ! But I do plan on staying in the community for sure 
---
Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
---
I like your idea better.  What if we joined forces with Menzies to kill all the gods...
---
At this point, they all kinda seem undeserving of their power anyway. c;
---
I have a sylvari ranger but I can't get into it...an asura guardian...but they are living cartoons.
---
There is a higher resolution picture, but one needs to really zoom in to see it. There is no way to get to the face of a clock any closer. For those who wonder, it is in the Claypool, Queensdale.

1Password requires an additional key in order to first access the data on a new device. That key is not to be stored anywhere except a secure place (it's in fact delivered so you print it out), and it's not used for anything else. Having only the password won't let anyone access your data. You also get a notification when a new access is done, so you can take countermeasures in the extreme case someone got both your key and your password.
---
Data is encrypted on your device (as well as online), and AgileBits themselves make it very clear, should you ever lose your access data (that includes backup access data in case of password loss), there is no way to get back into your account and encrypted data, ever. Which will never happen if you are responsible with your access data. 
---
Good for you and amazing if you remember all your passwords, I can't and won't remember my more than two hundred different passwords. Yet I know they are secure and will never be exposed. As a positive side effect, I can easily use 2FA anywhere. And should I ever lose my memory, my data can be recovered.
---
So, in other words, the [Khan-Ur](https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Khan-Ur) of Charrkind. ;)
---
...I do hope we learn more about him one day. There's a lot of juicy story potential tied to the Khan-Ur, including his methods of uniting the disparate warbands into legions, his mate(s) who bore his children, and his rather shady assassination and whether it was done by humans (with or without the assistance of the Six) or some ambitious charr who wanted to place the blame on someone else...
---
All the links to chrono builds on gw2skills are the same exact builds with same gear same traits etc etc.Did i do something wrong?
---
It makes perfect sense to run 100% boon duration, contrary to what the clowns at snowcrows say. But BD is capped at 100%, so you can take power food and at least one piece of assassin gear.
---
people played core tyria for years without the expansions. so, yes you could play without the expansions because there's still endless hours of content in the core maps. 
---
Will you be making another video on a new engineer farming build? If not I would like to start working on the build in the guide you made. (I'm talking about this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HiCl2scdnU8))
---
Nope. Not that I can tell.
---
The wallpapers from A Star To Guide Us (top few) are actually broken, nobody can access them. Try older ones?
---
You are unlikely to find anything above 1920x1200 though.
---
Because it's showing you a shot from a direction that the developers intended, to showcase an area or the design of something, in a way that I might not do myself.  And because it costs me nothing but 10 seconds of my time, which I am only spending to look for enjoyable experiences in the game anyway.
---
Scout Acan is probably my favorite character from HoT, and I would just hang out and chill with him.
---
Also, gimme my itzel tonic anet and lemme play instruments while tonic'd.
---
Leg as in pants? Requiem Leggings and Requiem boots :)
---
What's hard to understand about not wanting to waste your limited relaxation time doing something unenjoyable?
---
I'm barely 15 and i never had it in me to get rolled for 4 hours to get to level 20 that would just kill pvp for casual play all together
---
Welcome to the party, pal~
---
Leveling my first character and seeing  Tybalt  death behind the closest gate, I felt proud of him but so heartbroken and was sobbing for a while, also the last episode was so emotional, didn't make me cry but later tribute videos make me felt so sad about it.
---
Do you mean T4 dailies or just running any T4 in general? 
---
Yeah, the entire base game. That's hundreds of hours right there. 
---
Yep I really liked this about gw1. If you completed every expansion you got a title for that too
---
This kind of bullshit is why I just had to stop playing the game.  There's a difference between "challenging" and "retardedly annoying" and this crap was the final straw.
---
Nah, Aurene will take his place as an Elder Dragon (yes, I know she is dead)
---
The only weird thing with Menzies as Balthazar is it doesn't add up with stuff kormir says. She explicitly tells us it's Balthazar, and explicitly tells us they've already replaced him. If it was someone else pretending to be balth the charade would have ended there. Plus, taking over fora Balthazar doesn't " make you Balthazar". Otherwise grenth would be dhuum and kormir would be abbadon.
---
World Class
---
That's probably why snowcrows removed chrono tank from their builds.
---
Compared to asura size , this is one hella big weapon xD 
---
I don't understand why we upvote these threads this hard.... especially one taking a picture of their monitor.
---
No because it won't stop them from playing nor experiencing the game mode.
---
I would like to try out the FB/Ren combination in fractals, but my static was running a druid for some healing before.
---
What's the best way to add a bit of healing to the Power Quickbrand / Power Ren combination in fractals?
---
I'm wondering how much BD Diviner rev actually needs to maintain 100% uptime on alacrity, cause I highly doubt it'd need full diviners.
---
Maybe take some time to look into their lore on the Wiki or something?  Might help make them a bit more relatable.  
---
If its just visually, some people just don't like things that look weird to them.  /shrug
---
I always watch them! Quite beautiful and well done.
---
Try it, will work most likely.
---
It's aesthetics I think.  Nothing to do with lore or backstories.  I just can't get into them
---
The page needs to be updated. Over 6 years the trait lines have changed a lot (and the entire system was overhauled at one point): 
---
Dueling used to have: 
---
- https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Mantra_Mastery (from old system)
---
- https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Protected_Mantras (from old system)
---
- https://wiki.guildwars2.com/wiki/Harmonious_Mantras
---
I'd suggest putting in a support ticket ASAP and mention that you intend on buying this item on sale, and see if you'll give you a rain check.
---
Apples! Come get your apples!
---
And the Mordremoth fight quote 
---
*Tybalt my old friend, grab an apple and let's finish this! *
---
Necro is a good profession for all those aspects. One of the most survivable professions too. Plenty of ranged and close combat builds too. 
---
You missed the part where I said that *everywhere else in the game* depleted bundles disappear on their own.
---
So does it even matter which utility skills I use? I’ve just been using the illusion utility skills.
---
https://metabattle.com/wiki/Build:Renegade_-_Boon_Support_Power_DPS_(Fractal) looks like 85%?
---
This is really cool. I did see land marks I recognized in plains of ashford from gw1. So seeing more comparisons between guild wars and guild wars 2 on other maps is truly interesting. Keep up the good work.
---
No. You need to extend other boons as well --&gt; Prot, Vigor, Swiftness, Stability.
---
SMC 3ways are by far my favourite as well - minus the lag of course. Open field 3ways encourage so much more of waiting for the opponent to engage first which is an absolute bore to me. Although I hear - as I'm not one - as a commander it's more fun because of the mindgames.
---
Hey! Would you be so kind as to put it somewhere (Google Drive / Mega) to download it in high quality without the shitty Youtube compression?
---
You need \~80% BD to maintain it perma on 10 people which is basically Full Diviner's.
---
If you want to play a spellcaster and are new I would say Necromancer. Otherwise Warrior and Ranger are good because all 3 have high health pools.
---
Agree 100% ! 
---
That's what I read, but she seems to argue otherwise lol, I might take the time to watch her play for a while and see if I can spot the issue, she keeps dying trying to do the public quests (orange circles) her necro pet dies really fast then she says it's all over from there. So maybe have her stick with the necro and find a youtube video of how to be a necro lol
---
Chronos main jobs is to provide boons. If your group have to rely on 10k chronos dps in order to meet the DPS check, then your noob group is not worth to lace the chronos boots.
---
Hey, don't you be talking smack about my boy, Grenth
---
You're just boring
---
Dont go back gw2 my friend, its stale and bored right now.
---
Hey, I just started there too! It's my first playthrough. Message me if you'd like to quest together :). Username is Unholy Saucewalka
---
Wow.  How constructive.
---
yeah, I'd say so.
---
I think that it being by design is obvious. I don't see how it could be otherwise.
---
That's a great idea, thanks!
---
3 ways aren't anywhere as fun as having 2 even groups. Unless all three sides are willing to fight without going full lame, openfield three way tactics almost always end up in waiting games followed by assjams. 
---
Watching 3 groups stare at each other because engaging more than range poke is suicide. Źzzzzzzzzz
---
Commander's Dragon Maid
---
Some traits benefit certain skill types. Those are usually stated in the trait's tooltip, in yellow. For example:
---
&gt; &lt;yellow&gt;Signets&lt;/yellow&gt; have improved active effects, and activating one grants you yellow&gt;distortion&lt;/yellow&gt;.
---
Wait is this actually real?
---
&gt;If you want to play a spellcaster and are new I would say Necromancer. Otherwise Warrior and Ranger are good because all 3 have high health pools.
---
Thanks for the advice :)
---
Just to be clear though, I'm more looking for general advice (e.g. avoid this area but certainly do everything in this area because of ..., Ignore proffessions (if they exist) until later, early on they are useless, ...) Stuff like this :)
---
I would recommend using Pack for renegade as it also gives boon duration that it needs. But i would highly recommend that the renegade changes to healing (harrier+zealot combination) and the firebrand plays full zerk with scholar as they dont need any boon duration for perma quickness (u have just enough with frac pots).
---
The reason is because Diviner Ren + heal FB does less damage than Heal Ren (with Salvation instead of Invocation and Ventari) + DPS Qckbrand. You gonna have enough Fury with 1 Pack Rune proc + elite shout. Also dont forget that most meta DPS gives themselves Fury too.
---
I tried both Diviner and Heal Ren and the difference wasnt that much (on Enso with Jalis i was around 8-9k with pugs while with the heal i was around 4-5k on first try so these can be improved probably). I dont know how much heal FB does but my friend with DPS Qckbrand did 15k on Enso with those pugs (we were duo).
---
You can mix and match them regardless of traits you use. Sometimes it's not even worth using traits for utility skills because the spec doesnt add anything useful to your build or because you dont need many utility skills of the same type.
---
For example mantras have use in all kinds of builds, but you only trait them when you play support (chrono) due to healing and cleansing potential of those.
---
Yeah I slowly started to see the importance of dodges and blocks, I'll have to pass on the importance of it. Thanks ya helped out both of us 
---
Learn how to dodge and block attack from mobs. 
---
I play a guardian, so we were hoping to have two different classes to get the most out of thing's, maybe I'll swap and pick a different class
---
Add one more to this round of bullshit. 
---
well, if afkers and bots were such a problem like op things, then having them all on the 50 lvls needed for ranked would impact new players quite drastically. Furthermore it goes without saying that the pool of people for ranked play would be lower and that new players could lose interest in the mode if the rewards are arbitrarily gated behind rank lvl. And it's also not like what op proposes would be a solution for the problem in first place.
---
Absolut fucking legend. This autistic tale shall never be forgotten. 
---
FeelsBaguetteMan.
---
I think you mean springer.
---
It seems like people want different things, actually, and some of them watch and some don't.  I was just explaining why someone would want to watch it.
---
Yup, not gonna happen. Anet confirmed they'll never have an open world map that is not set in Tyria (world). While we'll have instances in the Mists, we'll never have an open world map there.
---
I think they're made out of strong magic users that are associated with the dragons. They could be the human god levels or they might have to be even stronger. I could be wrong about this, but I think the Pale Tree may have grabbed a good chunk of Mordemoth's power. I'm not entirely sure about Zhaitan's, I think all of his went back into the system.
---
I thought it was wear the story was going, too. Aurene becoming the Vessel for Kralk's, Joko &gt;!(before his wonderful demise)!&lt; would be granted Zhaitan's, and the Pale Tree (and other Sylvari Matriarchs) would get Mordemoth's. Primordious would probably be contained by the Charr, Dredge, or Asura. Jormag would have a Kodan or an Icebrood who wasn't fully corrupted.
---
The fractals of the mists are endless loops. As soon as we leave a fractal it resets. This was shown once by the one Asura trying to leave the lobby area, and immediately appearing again without any knowledge of the outsiders who were present.
---
The Arkk storyline was the story of him going into the mists to try to rescue his mother, but ending up becoming part of the fractals. From what I've read, it ends with them both figuring out they are part of the loop and forced to redo the whole thing over and over, never remembering it.
---
That cat's trippin' on some o' that good cat crack - cat nip. 
---
There are two cases of it, things like fractals where it resets at the end of every loop (Similar to the Orr tower event), and others were we can make minor changes, like the tree.
---
Also the commando Easter egg in Jahai bluffs :P.
---
You actually think the average gw2 player is competent at his class? I see you haven't brought a dps meter to any open world boss. 
---
So in order to play the game mode for rewards they should be accessible at early stage? That sounds like next level of stupidity for me. Not only that dedication for competitive part of the pvp doesnt exist, but there's also no dedication to play to reach high level in order to earn those rewards (50 is a bit too much, I agree)? 
---
What's the point of having ranked at that point? I don't get it.
---
All classes have ranged and melee options, so that's not an issue
---
While armor weight does give some extra defense  it usually don't matter that much
---
Rangers have long range without conditions with the longbow, also their pet is great for tanking damage for you.
---
Necromancer is a good tanky class thanks to the Death Shroud mechanic is like a second health bar with more powerful skills. The size of the Life Force bar scales with Vitality.
---
Warrior is the third class that's recommended to new players, they are purely meaty and versatile thanks to the tons of weapons they can use.
---
Guardians aren't that tanky as their name suggests, they have high Toughness (armor) but lower Vitality. They have many skills for protection too.
---
Mesmers have some survivability thanks to their dodges and clones, but I think they are fairly complex.
---
Engineer have some meat, but not many good options for survival.
---
Thief and Elementalist are the most squishy ones. I can give you more details on the classes if you want.
